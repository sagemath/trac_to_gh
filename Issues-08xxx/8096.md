Multiplication of small square matrices is ridiculously slow:

```
sage: for d in range(1, 100):
...    print d
...    A = random_matrix(GF(3), d)
...    B = random_matrix(GF(3), d)
...    timeit("C = A*B")

I'm not sure that I did this in the right place, but it cuts the time to multiply two 1x1 matrices down to 1/3 of the previous time -- which is still dog slow, but significantly better.  As a reference,

```
sage: A = GF(3).random_element()
sage: B = GF(3).random_element()
sage: timeit("C = A*B")
625 loops, best of 3: 142 ns per loop
```

and with this patch, I'm getting:

```
sage: d = 1
sage: A = random_matrix(GF(3), d)
sage: B = random_matrix(GF(3), d)
sage: timeit("C = A*B")
625 loops, best of 3: 32.5 µs per loop

You'll note that the 32.5µs is matrix-by-matrix, whereas the 142ns is element-by-element.  Before my patch, the matrix-by-matrix time was 101µs.

I'd like the 32.5µs to go away, but I don't know how much of that would be possible, at the moment.

Anyway, I still wonder why basic matrix operations in Sage tend to be so slow. I mean, do any complicated operations with parents happen behind the scenes? By "slow", I mean "compared with MeatAxe matrices as provided by my cohomology spkg":

```

sage: B = random_matrix(F,3)
sage: a = MTX(3,[list(r) for r in A.rows()])

625 loops, best of 3: 1.01 Âµs per loop

> Anyway, I still wonder why basic matrix operations in Sage tend to be so slow. I mean, do any complicated operations with parents happen behind the scenes? By "slow", I mean "compared with MeatAxe matrices as provided by my cohomology spkg":

This is because they have only been optimized for large dimension and word-sized p. I bet MeatAxe is slower for 1000 x 1000 matrices.

When I did some benchmarks two years ago, I was often astonished how MeatAxe outperformed the usual matrices in Sage in basic operations such as computing hash, copying, getting the list of coefficients, changing a coefficient, etc: Hash and copying took *seconds* for size 10000x10000!

I complained, and things did improve: hash and copy is alright. But with the above matrix, loads(dumps(A)) did not terminate after a minute, and ate 90% of my computer's memory.

Yes. Over a non-prime field:

```
sage: F = GF(8,'t')
sage: A = random_matrix(F,2000)
sage: B = random_matrix(F,2000)
sage: from pGroupCohomology.mtx import MTX
sage: a = MTX(8,[list(r) for r in A.rows()])
sage: b = MTX(8,[list(r) for r in B.rows()])
sage: %time c = a*b
CPU times: user 5.19 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 5.19 s
Wall time: 5.19 s
sage: %time C = A*B
```
The last line took several minutes, and it was not possible to interrupt with Ctrl-c. So, I had to kill the Python process.

And with a bigger prime, comparing against linbox:

```
sage: F = GF(37)
sage: A = random_matrix(F,2000)
sage: B = random_matrix(F,2000)
sage: a = MTX(37,[list(r) for r in A.rows()])
sage: b = MTX(37,[list(r) for r in B.rows()])
sage: %time c = a*b
CPU times: user 11.83 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 11.84 s
Wall time: 11.87 s
sage: %time C = A._multiply_linbox(B)
CPU times: user 1.82 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 1.82 s
Wall time: 1.82 s
sage: %time C = A*B
CPU times: user 12.65 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 12.65 s
Wall time: 12.70 s
```
In other words, for bigger fields, linbox is clearly better than MeatAxe, but the overhead kills it.

I think it is worth while to revive that ticket!

There has been some work done in the past, e.g., on #10763 (already merged) and #11589. I therefore suggest to start with determining the status quo (performance wise). 

The following is with sage-4.7.rc2 (which contains #10763) and #11589. I provide the timings with sage-4.6.2 in square brackets:

```
sage: F = GF(3)
sage: A = random_matrix(F,3)
sage: B = random_matrix(F,3)
sage: %timeit C = A*B
625 loops, best of 3: 36.6 µs per loop
[625 loops, best of 3: 54.6 µs per loop]
sage: A = random_matrix(F,2000)
sage: B = random_matrix(F,2000)
sage: %timeit C = A*B
5 loops, best of 3: 8.36 s per loop
[5 loops, best of 3: 8.27 s per loop]
```

So, part of the issue with small matrices is resolved. The second patch [attachment: 8096-new_matrix.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8096/8096-new_matrix.patch.gz) is actually obsoleted by #10763 and #11589, and the first patch needs to be rebased.

However, large matrices are still not nice. We have seen that linbox provides a much faster multiplication. Wouldn't it be a valid approach to use linbox more often? Perhaps make it the default over finite fields?

For the record: Today I slightly improved MeatAxe matrix initialisation (my MeatAxe wrapper relies on a modified/improved version of MeatAxe-2.2.4, and today I added memset). 

Now, multiplication of two random 2000x2000 matrices over GF(3) takes 1.72 seconds with MeatAxe (it used to be 11 seconds, without memset), compared to 1.65 seconds with _multiply_linbox and 8.34 seconds with plain Sage matrices.

I really wonder why linbox isn't used by default.

Here is another data point concerning slowness - ridiculous slowness, actually - of matrix multiplication in Sage. The following is with sage-4.7.1.rc1 plus the patches from #11589:

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(64,'a'),5000,5000)
# I think the following is already WAY too slow!
sage: %time A = MS.random_element()
CPU times: user 38.42 s, sys: 0.13 s, total: 38.55 s
Wall time: 38.67 s
sage: B = MS.random_element()
sage: %time C = A*B
^C^C^C^C^C^C^C^C^C^C^C^C^C^C
```

In other words:

1. The computation can not be interrupted, which is a bug.
2. The computation takes more than 45 minutes!!!
3. The computation takes more than 880 MB.

As much as I see, GF(2) is the *only* finite field such that multiplication of square matrices over that field is not blatantly slow in Sage.

It makes me wonder if we shouldn't use a different package for matrix multiplication over finite fields different from GF(2).

As much as I know, there already is an experimental version for matrices over `GF(2^n)`, isn't it, Martin? How fast is it?

Over finite prime fields, we could use Linbox. There are tickets to do so.

But What about finite non-prime fields? Would it be a reasonable idea to use something based on `MeatAxe`?

I will very likely be using a Sage wrapper for `MeatAxe` matrices in my current project. So, I'll do the work anyway. From my perspective, the only question is whether we can/should use it by default in Sage.

Here are some relevant data:

1. I work on top of `MeatAxe 2.2.4`. That version is identic with 2.2.3, with one important difference. While all other meataxe versions are `GPL 2`, version 2.2.4 is `GPL 2+`. In fact, that version was made after I wanted to use meataxe 2.2.3 in my group cohomology package and asked Michael Ringe whether he could provide it in `GPL 2+`. 

2. I am not just wrapping it, in fact I am branching meataxe. I improved the implementation of the "school book" multiplication in meataxe, and I implemented Strassen-Winograd multiplication, which had so far been missing in meataxe.

3. It would provide a vastly better performance. The above 5000x5000 multiplication over GF(4) with the school book method needs 173.68 CPU seconds and about 200 MB. With Strassen-Winograd, it is  only 85.04 CPU seconds, using less than 280 MB.

4. Concerning prime fields: A multiplication of two 5000x5000 matrices A, B over GF(5) using `A._multipliy_linbox(B)` needs 21.49 CPU seconds and 1.2 GB(!). Using school book multiplication in meataxe, it is 46.70 s and 140 MB, or 30.29 CPU seconds and 160 MB using Strassen-Winograd.

__Conclusion__

* The licence of `MeatAxe 2.2.4` would be fine.

* The default matrix multiplication over finite fields that is currently provided in Sage is not competitive at all.

* Over prime fields, Linbox is still faster, but my implementation of Strassen multiplication needs only one tenth of the memory.

* As far as I know, Linbox does not officially support non-prime fields, in contrast to meataxe. And Meataxe is a lot faster than the current implementation in Sage, except for GF(2).

* My meataxe wrapper could still be improved - I have no idea of how to optimize the use of L1 and L2 cache, and would need help to do so.

* Big disadvantage of my current meataxe wrapper: It only supports field sizes less than 256. There is a "big" version of meataxe that can deal with field sizes of up to `2^16-1`, but I did not wrap it yet, and I don't know how difficult it would be.

As I said: I will work on that wrapper anyway, because it seems well suited for my current project. But would it make sense in Sage as a default implementation for matrices over small finite fields (or at least over the non-prime fields)?

Actually, it's not experimental but a fully working patch + library has been around for ages, it was agreed months ago it would go into Sage, there has just not been enough push to finish the review: #9562

Here's a summary of the current approach & performance:

http://martinralbrecht.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/20110330_-_m4ri_-_nancy.pdf

To compare with your results:

**Karatsuba**

```python
sage: K.<a> = GF(4)
sage: A = random_matrix(K,5000,5000)
sage: B = random_matrix(K,5000,5000)
sage: %time C=A*B
CPU times: user 0.51 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.52 s
Wall time: 0.52 s
```

**Travolta**

```python
sage: K.<a> = GF(4)
sage: A = random_matrix(K,5000,5000)
sage: B = random_matrix(K,5000,5000)
sage: %time C=A._multiply_travolta(B)
CPU times: user 1.19 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 1.20 s
Wall time: 1.20 s
```

So both algorithms in M4RIE are much faster than ~80 seconds. I didn't precisely measure memory consumption though. 



> The default matrix multiplication over finite fields that is currently provided in Sage is  not competitive at all.

Very much agreed!

> Over prime fields, Linbox is still faster, but my implementation of Strassen multiplication needs only one tenth of the memory.

I hope to fix this next week at Sage Days, i.e. to wrap LinBox properly.

> As far as I know, Linbox does not officially support non-prime fields, in contrast to meataxe. And Meataxe is a lot faster than the current implementation in Sage, except for GF(2).

Clément told me that LinBox does support non-prime fields we just never wrapped them in Sage.

> My meataxe wrapper could still be improved - I have no idea of how to optimize the use of L1 and L2 cache, and would need help to do so.

Let's move that to e-mail.

> Big disadvantage of my current meataxe wrapper: It only supports field sizes less than 256. 

I don't think it's that big of an issue, a lot of applications need small fields!

One more data point.

Again, this is with #9562:

```python
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(64,'a'),5000,5000)
sage: %time A = MS.random_element()
CPU times: user 0.46 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.46 s
Wall time: 0.47 s
sage: B = MS.random_element()
sage: %time C = A*B 
CPU times: user 22.69 s, sys: 0.06 s, total: 22.75 s
Wall time: 22.84 s
```

Note that we only implemented Travolta for GF(2<sup>6</sup>) so far. With Karatsuba we expect to get close to 4.5 seconds, because:

```python
sage: A = random_matrix(GF(2),5000,5000)
sage: B = random_matrix(GF(2),5000,5000)
sage: %timeit C=A*B
5 loops, best of 3: 249 ms per loop
```

and the best known formula for degree 5 polynomials needs 17 such multiplications:

Martin, I just found that M4RIE just needs 10.42 seconds resp. 8.78 seconds on my computer for multiplying two random 5000x5000 matrices over GF(64).

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(64,'a'),5000,5000)
sage: A = MS.random_element()
sage: type(A)
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_mod2e_dense.Matrix_mod2e_dense'>
sage: B = MS.random_element()
sage: %time C = A*B
CPU times: user 10.42 s, sys: 0.15 s, total: 10.56 s
Wall time: 10.60 s
sage: %time C = A._mult
A._multiply_classical  A._multiply_karatsuba  A._multiply_strassen   A._multiply_travolta
sage: %time C = A._multiply_travolta(B)
CPU times: user 8.73 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 8.75 s
Wall time: 8.78 s
```

That's awesome! For these particular matrices, the Meataxe fork needs 85.26 seconds. Hopefully I'll be able to review #9562 tomorrow.

No surprise that two-year-old patches don't apply anymore. I am rebasing them now, producing a single patch replacing the two. I am not totally sure, but I think the ideas of the second patch are already in Sage - need to verify it, though.

I have rebased the patches, combining them into one patch. In fact, a part (but not all) of the second patch is not needed anymore, since the creation of the zero matrix has been improved in another ticket.

Here is evidence that the patch still does improve the timings for the computation of small matrices - even after we have switched to linbox:

Without patch:

```
sage: d = 1
sage: A = random_matrix(GF(3), d)
sage: B = random_matrix(GF(3), d)
sage: timeit("C = A*B")
625 loops, best of 3: 40.5 µs per loop
```

With the patch:

```
sage: d = 1
sage: A = random_matrix(GF(3), d)
sage: B = random_matrix(GF(3), d)
sage: timeit("C = A*B")
625 loops, best of 3: 18.5 µs per loop
```

I need to run the doctests, though. But needs review.
