From the main notebook help page:

   The file `$HOME/.sage/init.sage` is attached on startup if it exists.

But the file is not `attach`ed --- try evaluating `attached_files()`.  This is a follow-up to #7514.

The attached patch seems to work for me.Â  `DOT_SAGE/init.sage` is equivalent to `os.environ['SAGE_STARTUP_FILE']` (see `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/ipy_profile_sage.py`).
