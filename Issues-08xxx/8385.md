```
Currently, if one runs 

```
$ make test
```

a file

```
$HOME/.sage/tmp/test.log
```

is created with the results of the tests. However, this stops testing two versions of Sage at the same time - even if the tests take place on different machines. 

Hence it would be useful if the log file had the hostname, date and time in it. 

I would suggest a name like

```
test.log-redstart-23:22:57-02:26:2010
```

would be useful to indicate

* The hostname was "redstart"
* The time the tests started was "23:22:57"
* The date the tests started was "02:26:2010"

This would allow multiple versions of Sage to be tested on multiple computers at the same time. 

Adding the Sage version would be nice too, as below for Sage 4.3.3

```
test.log-4.3.3-redstart-23:22:57-02:26:2010
```

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
Given that the original problem (writing to `$HOME`) doesn't occur anymore, given that running `make (p)test(long)` twice in the same installation is unlikely and given that it's nice to have easy, predictable filenames for the logfiles, I propose to close this as invalid.
