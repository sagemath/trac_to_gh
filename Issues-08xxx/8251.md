It's possible to get a traceback for some dumb reason in some cases when computing the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve:

```
...
Traceback (most recent call last):           for K in J.unramified_outside([i],3):
  File "", line 1, in <module>
    
  File "/tmp/tmpSAW9n5/___code___.py", line 6, in <module>
    T=E.torsion_subgroup()
  File "/usr/local/sage2/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py", line 3515, in torsion_subgroup
    self.__torsion_subgroup = ell_torsion.EllipticCurveTorsionSubgroup(self, algorithm)
  File "/usr/local/sage2/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_torsion.py", line 159, in __init__
    if self.__K is RationalField() and algorithm in pari_torsion_algorithms:

    self._assign_names(('x',),normalize=False) # ???

  File "category_object.pyx", line 336, in sage.structure.category_object.CategoryObject._assign_names (sage/structure/category_object.c:3286)
ValueError: variable names cannot be changed after object creation.
```

The above is caused by running this script:

```
J=JonesDatabase()
P=Primes()
for E in cremona_optimal_curves([0..50]):
    T=E.torsion_subgroup()
    i=E.conductor()
    if i.is_prime():
       for K in J.unramified_outside([i],3):
                F=E.base_extend(K)
                T_1=F.torsion_subgroup() 

                if T != T_1:
                    E.label();
                    K.is_galois();
                    T;
                    T_1;
    else:
        j=2 
        while j < i :
            if j.is_prime():
                n=i/j
                if n.is_integral():
                    for K in J.unramified_outside([j],3):
                        F=E.base_extend(K)

                        T_1=F.torsion_subgroup() 
                        if T != T_1:
                            E.label();

                            K.is_galois();
                            T;
                            T_1;
            j=P.next(j)

This may be related to #7930.  In both cases, a sequence of elliptic curves and number fields and reduction mod primes is carried out, and something is getting confused about all the finite fields which getting created.

It would be a great help if we could simplify the script which causes this.  There's an outer look through curves and an inner loop through certain fields, depending on the curve, and then the torsion of the curve over that field is computed.  I'll try to do that.

This error has (a) nothing to do with elliptic curve code and (b) nothing to do with number fields at all!

It is arising because in several places in Sage source code the field of rational numbers is referred to as `RationalField()` instead of as QQ.  This should not matter, since the `RationalField()` call is supposed to return the unique object of its class, which is pre-assigned to QQ, but apparently sometimes it does go through the process of running the code in `RationalField.__init__()`.  That code contains the mysterious line

```
        self._assign_names(('x',),normalize=False) # ???
```
-- note that some one (not me) has added those ??? -- I cannot see any reason for assigning any "names" to QQ.  It is this call to the _assign_names() function which sometimes raises the error.  I do not know why it only happens sometimes.

It might therefore be a good idea to change the title of this ticket.  I will ask other people for their opinion.  Robert?  (You added the ???)  William?  (You added the assign_names line!)

I would like to try commenting out that line and testing the entire Sage library.

As suggested by William, I've converted the pickle `data/jones/jones.sobj` to be less dependent on the version of Sage by storing the polynomials as lists of python ints rather than as actual polynomials. This solves the problem encountered in this ticket, and also prevents similar things in the future.

I'll try to create a new jones spkg soon, but for now I'm attaching the sage patch and the updated `data/jones/jones.sobj`.

There was also a new polynomial on John Jones' webpage, so the contents of this new sobj are slightly different than the previous version of the database.

John, does that mean the bug in question still is a problem?  I only updated this since *you* mentioned it in the sage-devel thread :-) hope the downgrade is okay.

I just risked destroying my Sage build (computer OS upgrade) to try this out, but I think it might not be a problem any longer.

```
sage: RationalField()
Rational Field
sage: from sage.env import SAGE_SHARE
sage: x = load(os.path.join(SAGE_SHARE, 'jones', 'jones.sobj'))
sage: RationalField()
Rational Field
```

Do you think that is the 'modern' equivalent of [comment:5](#comment%3A5)?  For what it's worth, apparently I `sage -i' and loaded the database correctly:

```
sage: list(JonesDatabase().unramified_outside([3], 3))
[Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 - 3*x + 1,
 Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 - 3]
```

It seems that you haves tested that the package database_jones_numfield does work, and I am also now installing it....done, and I see no problem.

Let's close this issue.

I was on the ticket since (I think) William first caused the failure while doing somthing with elliptic curves, so he fingered me.  I then pointed out that the failure had nothing to do with elliptic curves!
