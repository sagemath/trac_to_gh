This patch implements translation for elements of a root lattice and related features and fixes::

- New method `translation` for elements of a root lattice

- New methods `reduced_word_of_alcove_morphism`, `dynkin_diagram_automorphism_of_alcove_morphism`, `reduced_word_of_translation`, `_test_reduced_word_of_translation`

- Added extensive TESTS to compare with Kashiwara's private notes

- Fixed dynkin diagram for type BC

- Fixed CartanType.translation_factors to implement its specification correctly in affine type BC. Imported the full test suite from MuPAD-Combinat. Also fixes and tests for proper typing of the coefficients (ZZ/QQ).

- Bug fix in WeylGroup: the matrices were defined over QQ instead of the base ring of the underlying root lattice realization.

I carefully checked the results of translation_factor, adding extra tests to compare with Kashiwara's private notes. Nicolas and I discussed at length the correct factors for type BC (see the corresponding doc in the code).

All tests passed on massena and all tests in combinat/root_systems passed on my machine.

Positive review.
