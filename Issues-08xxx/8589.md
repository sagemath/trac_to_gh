This patch gives its Hopf algebra structure to the group algebra of `G` over `R` created in the following way

```
   sage: G.algebra(R)
```

Another feature is a method is_central on elements of the algebra (which works also for monoid algebras so is in the file sage.categories.monoids)

Doing this, I have encountered and solved some problems:

* The generators of permutation groups were returned as a list and not as a family, which is the case for other types of groups. They are now returned as a family.

* The Hopf algebra structure didn't include counit. This has been corrected.

* There was a bug in module_morphism which didn't work when the codomain was the ring itself (because it is not considered as a module by sage). It has been corrected.

Hello,

Is there any new progress on this?  

I'd like to help, but I think I have to start by understanding `Family`:  

Replying to [vferay](#comment%3A1):
> * The generators of permutation groups were returned as a list and not as a family, which is the case for other types of groups. They are now returned as a family.


`DihedralGroup` and `CyclicPermutationGroup` both return `gens` as lists, and polynomial/power series rings return `gens` as tuples . . . could someone tell me if there is an effort under way to convert all of these to `Family`, or what sorts of things do already return `gens` as a `Family`?

Are there other work issues for this patch (other than the bug with 4.4.3 reported by nthiery), or is it otherwise ready for review?

thanks,
Niles

If we are only interested with groups, there is no interest to return things as a Family, but it is the natural structure when we work with algebra generators. So the change was to unify this but I confess that I don't remember for which function I wanted to do that.

more soon,

The current convention is for algebra_generators,
semigroup_generators, and the like to return families.

There definitely is a plan for the long run (at least a wish from the
sage-combinat group :-)) to have .gens() return a family as well. But
this will require some serious coordination to maintain backward
compatibility, and I'd rather have it done in a separate patch.

Valentin: do you really need this feature right now?

Hello,

It was needed in the function algebra_generators() which can be called on a group or semi-group algebra. But I changed this function such that it works in both cases.

I splitted the patch in 2 and keep just the part on group algebra and Hopf algebra (and not the part turning group generators into a family).

Everything seems to work now (I have one error in the test of hopf_algebra_with_basis.py :

After investigation, your patch depends on:

- trac_9648_modulemorphism_codomain_extension-cs.patch # Needs review
- free_module_basis_key_initialisation-nb.patch

#9648 just needs a last pass of proofreading + rerunning the tests
with the latest Sage. Do you volunteer for the former?

I just created #10127 for the second. We should be able to finalize it
soon with Nicolas B.

With those patches applied, I only get two trivial errors in sage/categories:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage-combinat/sage/categories/groups.py"

Hi

You mean that you want semigroup_generators to return a list. I assume that this will need to change a few things in all the semigroup file. Another solution is also to overload the algebra_generators function for group algebras.

> #9648 just needs a last pass of proofreading + rerunning the tests with the latest Sage. Do you > volunteer for the former? 

ok I will try to do that.

> With those patches applied, I only get two trivial errors in sage/categories: 

the first one does not appear on my computer (?). I corrected the second one.

Oops, I investigated this too quickly. The culprit is actually Groups.ParentMethods.group_generators which returns self.gens() directly, instead of making the result first into a family.

Hmm. Which patches did you have applied when you tried? Which version of Sage?

ok I have changed this function and every test pass...

I think the patch is ready now, I am waiting that the other patches are included in sage to set it as need_review .

version 4.5.3, patches up to this one were applied. But now, I find the same result as you do (except that now, it has been transformed into a family)...

All test pass on 4.5.3, with the following patches applied:

```
trac_9648_modulemorphism_codomain_extension-cs.patch # Needs review
trac_10127_free_module_basis_key_initialisation-nb.patch # Under review
trac_8589_feature_group_algebras_vf.patch  #-4_5    # Under review
trac_8589_feature_group_algebras-reviewer-nt.patch
```

Generally speaking, the patch is good to go, up to missing documentation and tests for Coalgebras.ElementMethods.counit. Valentin, please fold in my reviewer's patch, add doc and test, check that the documentation compiles smoothly, and upload here. 

Then you can set a positive review on my behalf. Thanks for your work on that!
