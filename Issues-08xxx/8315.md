We add potentially useful features to reference manual HTML pages:

* In the sidebar:
  * Sticky sidebar toggle.
  * Indented list of links to the page's classes, methods, functions.
  * Controls to toggle, hide, or show docstrings.
* In the main content:
  * Click on an argspec to toggle the corresponding docstring.

See [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/a34a80097ad47805/2e57eb60d7f9881d?#2e57eb60d7f9881d) for some background.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

To do:

* Disable or fix the sticky sidebar in the live docs.
* Add hide / show / toggle controls for "all."
* Add a color, etc., for attributes (e.g., aliases), data, exceptions, modules, i.e., the other `autodocumenters`.
* Fix uniform over-indentation in live docs.
* Make (sub)section headings toggle (sub)section display.  We can use this in the other docs.
* Add "larger" and "smaller" font size controls.
* When it's necessary, extend the main content to match the sidebar in length.

Most of these are straightforward to implement, I think.

Good idea!  This should be straightforward.  It may be better to include the link in just the "fast static" documentation.  In this case, we have the server address and port number, so we can insert an analogous "Go live!" link on the fly.

Of course, this only works if the server is still running and works best when the user is logged into the server.  I'm not aware of an easy way for a page to check whether a link is valid before deciding whether to display it or hide it.

For the "offline" docs (e.g., those accessed via `file:///`), perhaps we could prompt for a working server address (and save it in a cookie) or direct the user to `sagenb.org`?
