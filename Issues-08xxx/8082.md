We have a strange behavior

```
sage: point(CC(0))  # plot a point with coordinates (0, 0)
sage: point(CC(1))  # plot a point with coordinates (1, 0)
sage: point([CC(0),CC(1)])  # plot a point with coordinates (0, 1)
```
The patch add a line in plot.py to correct this and get the two points (0,0) and (1,0) when doing

```
sage: point([CC(0), CC(1)])
```
