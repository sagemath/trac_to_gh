It appears to be significantly better for high weights:

On sage-4.6.1, before the patch:

```
sage: time M = ModularSymbols(1, 810, 0, GF(809))
CPU times: user 51.57 s, sys: 0.45 s, total: 52.02 s
Wall time: 52.03 s
```

After the patch:

```
sage: time M = ModularSymbols(1, 810, 0, GF(809))
CPU times: user 16.40 s, sys: 0.17 s, total: 16.57 s
Wall time: 16.58 s
```

This makes me *very* happy.

I agree, and I had noticed the point about `binomial` myself.  It's late (or really early) here, but I'll try to split off the easier bits tomorrow.

OK, so I have split off the part not directly involved in the 2-term relations into two other tickets: #10709 for the binomial coefficients in the matrix actions on Manin symbols, and #10710 for the various docstring/doctest/comment fixes.

I will soon update the patch on this ticket by removing those parts.

**Attachment:** [trac-8614-optimize-modular-symbol-relations-rebase.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8614/trac-8614-optimize-modular-symbol-relations-rebase.patch)

I rebased the patch to 4.7alpha2 (with #10709 applied). Its not true that the new code is slower. I ran the following small tests:

```
%time M = ModularSymbols(1000,2,sign=1).new_subspace().cuspidal_subspace()
%time t3 = M.hecke_matrix(3)
%time time d = t3.decomposition(algorithm='multimodular', height_guess=1)

%time ModularSymbols(2002, 2)
%time ModularSymbols(302, 4)
%time ModularSymbols(Gamma1(33), 4)
%time ModularSymbols(DirichletGroup(308).0, 5)
%time M = ModularSymbols(1, 810, 0, GF(809))
```

Without the patch:

```
Wall time: 2.92 s
Wall time: 0.19 s
Wall time: 0.09 s

Wall time: 1.34 s
Wall time: 4.08 s
Wall time: 2.20 s
Wall time: 10.97 s
Wall time: 16.23 s
```

With the patch applied:

```
Wall time: 2.77 s
Wall time: 0.13 s
Wall time: 0.09 s

Wall time: 1.22 s
Wall time: 4.38 s
Wall time: 2.10 s
Wall time: 11.12 s
Wall time: 15.33 s
```

None of the differences is significant in the sense that %timeit could reproduce it. A profile

```
%prun M = ModularSymbols(Gamma1(52), 4)
```
shows that indeed the new code is three times as fast as the old one. But since the relevant function only needs 0.1s and 0.03s, respectively, this can be hardly tracked.

```
sage: time a=[CremonaModularSymbols(N).dimension() for N in [1000..2000]]
CPU times: user 31.12 s, sys: 0.52 s, total: 31.64 s
Wall time: 31.68 s
sage: time b=[ModularSymbols(N).dimension() for N in [1000..2000]]       
CPU times: user 636.90 s, sys: 0.14 s, total: 637.04 s
Wall time: 637.91 s
sage: a==b
True
```

This is enough to convince me that the implementation is ok.  I tested the complete library too.
