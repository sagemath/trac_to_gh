I don't understand your remark.
My patch appears to be in accordance with the current design.

sage: f = ZZ['x'](4*x)
sage: f.squarefree_decomposition()
(4) * x
sage: f.factor()
2^2 * x

And it works:

sage: f = ZZ['x'](4)
sage: f.factor()
2^2
sage: f.squarefree_decomposition()
4

sage: f = QQbar['x'](4)
sage: f.factor()
4
sage: f.squarefree_decomposition()
4

```

 sage: f.squarefree_decomposition()
 (4) * x

``` 
And it works:

```

 sage: f = QQbar['x'](4)
 sage: f.factor()

 sage: f.squarefree_decomposition()
 4

I tried to review that one, but I have some questions (maybe unrelated to that ticket):

```
sage: R = QQbar['x']
sage: f = R(x)
...
NotImplementedError: symbol
```
This works this way:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQbar)
sage: f = R(x)
```
but then:

```
sage: f = R(x^2)
sage: f.factor()
...
NotImplementedError: 
```
What is the point of being able to factor only constant polynomials over QQbar?

Good point, Paul;  I had forgotten that no-one had done this yet, which is silly since it only takes one line:

```
sage: x = polygen(QQbar)
sage: f = 3*x^2-2
sage: Factorization([(x-r,e) for r,e in f.roots()],unit=f.leading_coefficient())
(3) * (x - 0.8164965809277260?) * (x + 0.8164965809277260?)
```
But doing this for QQbar would also mean doing it for AAbar, which is a little more complicated, which is probably why no-one has done it yet.

```
sage: f = x^4-2
sage: x = polygen(AA)
sage: f = x^4-2      
sage: fr = f.roots(QQbar)
sage: f1 = Factorization([(x-r,e) for r,e in f.roots() if f.imag().is_zero()],unit=f.leading_coefficient())
sage: f2 = Factorization([(x^2-(r+r.conjugate()).real()*x+r.norm(),e) for r,e in fr if f.image()>0])
sage: f1*f2
(x - 1.189207115002722?) * (x + 1.189207115002722?) * (x^2 + 1.414213562373095?)
```

It is very tempting to add this as a second patch to the ticket.  Can you see anything wrong in my worked examples here?

Dear John,

your method seems ok to me, however I can't reproduce your first example in Sage 4.3.3:

```
sage: x = polygen(QQbar)
sage: f = 3*x^2-2
sage: lc = f.leading_coefficient()
sage: Factorization([(x-r,e) for r,e in f.roots()])
(x - 0.8164965809277260?) * (x + 0.8164965809277260?)
sage: Factorization([(x-r,e) for r,e in f.roots()],unit=1)
(x - 0.8164965809277260?) * (x + 0.8164965809277260?)
sage: Factorization([(x-r,e) for r,e in f.roots()],unit=lc)
...
TypeError: Illegal initializer for algebraic number
sage: type(lc), parent(lc)
(<class 'sage.rings.qqbar.AlgebraicNumber'>, Algebraic Field)
```
Does it depend on another ticket?

Shouldn't these roots be exact? (i.e. they should come with intervals isolating them, otherwise one can potentially get
wrong results, mixing numerical noise with true multiplicities --- or is it built-in f.roots() already?)

(same applies to QQbar---although I do not know anything
about isolating complex roots, excuse my ignorance...)

after applying #7984 on vanilla 4.3.3, your first example works, but the second one still fails:

```
sage: f1 = Factorization([(x-r,e) for r,e in f.roots() if f.imag().is_zero()],unit=f.leading_coefficient())

AttributeError: 'Polynomial_generic_dense_field' object has no attribute 'imag'

Any other ticket to apply? (Sorry I have no time to install an alpha version.)
