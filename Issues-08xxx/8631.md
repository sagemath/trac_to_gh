Good idea.  If we do this, we might want to also have an interact control that gives a nice interactive way of choosing a graph from the family of all graphs. This would be what graphs.[tab] gives, but more graphical.

Definitely.  I'll try to recover what I worked up before and post it here in the next couple days.  My work on this got a bit jumbled, which stopped me a few days ago on a final review of the editor itself at #8222.  

So I'll tackle both of these in one shot.

the graph interact is ready. The patches depends on the newest graph_editor which is #8222.

Needs work because i haven't done doctests and haven't decided how to incorporate the overlapping code with the graph_editor into one js graph library (right now i just copied it into a new file graph_interact.js and modified).

In any case it is working for anyone who wants to see how eigenvalues or chromatic numbers change dynamically (as you throw in or throw out vertices and edges). Enjoy!

Rado,

Very nice!  This works for me - I'll upload a screenshot next.

For anybody else testing, you just need a line like

`G=Graph(...)`

in the argument list of the function you are using as the interact.  It seems that you need to specify the initial graph as something other than a null graph, and whatever this graph might be, the routine expects to find position information.  

Nice work!

Rob
