From `sets_cat.py`:

```
FIXME: the above behavior dates back from the first category
writeup. It is not consistent with :meth:`Category.__call__`.
Should we change it to just return ``ZZ`` instead?
```
Also `EnumeratedSets().__call__(...)` is missing.

Keywords: **Category call**

Component: **categories**

I reuploaded a new patche with the following diff folded:

```
diff --git a/sage/categories/enumerated_sets.py b/sage/categories/enumerated_sets.py

```
So now you have to review it ;-)
