A problem with cddlib-094f.p2.spkg is that it patches upstream source using a patch file, rather than copying a patched file over to the appropriate place under the src/ directory. Consequently, there is no clean separation between upstream source and patches that we apply to cddlib-094f. Looking at spkg-install of cddlib-094f.p2.spkg, you get these two lines for applying Sage-specific patches:

```
cp patches/allfaces.c src/src/

patch -p0 < patches/cdd_both_reps-make.patch
```
The first line is the preferred way to patch an upstream source because it copies the patched file patches/allfaces.c over to src/src/. This issue is reported on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/e599fd37de909264).




This depends on #8179.

New version now has unmodified src (except for deleting unnecessary subdirectories). 

http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/cddlib-094f.p4.spkg

To simplify review I'll attach spkg-install in verbatim. 

Changes: 
* libtool-ized, see http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/3304
  After implementing the changes, I found that tabbott proposed a
  similar patch to the automake files earlier:
  http://sagetrac.org/sage_trac/ticket/3304
* renamed configure.in -> configure.ac (preferred usage)
* renamed patches/cdd_both_reps-makefiles.patch -> patches/automake.patch 
* added check for required mpir (aka GMP) to spkg-install
* added spkg-check
* corrected src/patch usage
* removed CFLAGS settings in spkg-install, not required.
* Workaround for spkg-env setting RM="rm"

This runs the function `patch()` in `spkg-install` so that the patching is done before configuring the upstream source under `src/`.

The updated spkg looks good. I longer see any binaries being moved to the script repository at `SAGE_ROOT/local/bin`. All doctests pass.

Here is some relevant information about the machine on which I tried to force a re-installation of the previous version of cddlib-094f.p4.spkg:

* OS version: Ubuntu 8.04.3 LTS
* Machine name: mod.math.washington.edu
* Architecture: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU X7460 @ 2.66GHz
* 32/64 bit: 64-bit
* RAM: 124 GB
* Compiler: GCC 4.2.4

Even with the updated spkg you posted, forcing a re-installation also results in a build failure on the above machine. I have attached an install log.

Sorry for the noise. This was due to a configuration error: no libtool in /usr/bin

On my Open Solaris in VirtualBox no such a problem. There are others!

The .p3 will break polyhedra.py, please don't apply that. You need those two parts:

```
    # Required by sage.geometry.polyhedra
    cp patches/cdd_both_reps.c src/src/
    cp patches/cdd_both_reps.c src/src-gmp/
```

To actually compile these extra .c sources, you need the updated Makefile.am's and rerun autoconf/automake and keep track of the autogenerated files.

Can you be a bit clearer on what you want to separate out? Do you want a spkg with all updates and fixes except the libtools stuff? I can split that out but I don't quite see the point.

Guys, it would be good to know how to do changes in this  framework of patches you created.
The current problem with this spkg is that gmp must be in $SAGE_LOCAL, and not in /usr/local
This stops the thing building on Solaris, see [http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/msg/35b0c600a5ef250f](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/msg/35b0c600a5ef250f) and other messages in this thread.
And gmpdir=/usr/local is hardwired in Makefile.am...

Thanks,
Dima
