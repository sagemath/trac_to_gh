<a id='comment:2'></a>The problem's not in the polynomial ring constructor per se:

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(MatrixSpace(QQ, 2),'x'); R
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Rational Field
```
Almost nothing works with R because printing of elements is broken, but at least you can construct it! 

The problem reported above lies in the `R['x']` syntax; for some reason, the "list" method of the matrix ring is getting called, and this (of course) never terminates. If you try this with a matrix space over a *finite* ring, the list call succeeds, and it tries to get the element of index 'x' -- which fails because the string 'x' isn't an integer:

```

This is "easy" to do for one variable by overriding `MatrixSpace_generic.__getitem__` to check for a string, and then calling `PolynomialRing()`.

But ideally, we would want to offer the same interface that we do when constructing polynomial rings from other rings or fields. Does constructing a polynomial ring over matrix spaces even make sense mathematically? All of the existing code to do this is in `ring.__getitem__`, which sounds right to me, but this is very much not a strong point of mine.

<a id='comment:12'></a>Hi Mark!

I went through the changes, and overall it looks good! Thanks so much for the cleanup!

Some tiny remarks / suggestions:

- Doc of __getitem__
  - TODO -> .. TODO
  - Is Frac nicer than .fraction_field()?
- Doc of _gen_names, line 2: replacing `ZZ['x']` by `ZZ[sqrt(5)]` could make it more meaninful?
- getitem for a matrix space M: could `M[sqrt(5)]` be a meaningful notation to extend the base ring?
  If yes, I'd be in favor of completely deprecating `M[3]` in favor of `M.unrank(3)`, in order to eventually allow for the notation `M[sqrt(5)]` without ambiguity in the corner case `M[1]`.

By the way: shall we use the occasion to also move `PrincipalIdealDomain.__getitem__` in the corresponding category? Or are there some principal ideal domains in Sage that are not yet in the `PrincipalIdealDomains` category?

Speaking of this method: its documentation says "Create a polynomial or power series ring over ``self`` and inject the variables into the global module scope."; the latter statement is wrong, right?

Cheers,
                         Nicolas

Replying to [comment:12 nthiery]:
> - Doc of __getitem__
>   - TODO -> .. TODO


No, that was on purpose: the TODO was part of the SEEALSO block. But I added the missing cross-references and removed the TODO line altogether. (I'll push the new commit in a moment.)

>   - Is Frac nicer than .fraction_field()?


No idea, I didn't touch this part `:-)`.
Let's mention both.

> - Doc of _gen_names, line 2: replacing `ZZ['x']` by `ZZ[sqrt(5)]` could make it more meaninful?


Same thing here.

> - getitem for a matrix space M: could `M[sqrt(5)]` be a meaningful notation to extend the base ring?
>   If yes, I'd be in favor of completely deprecating `M[3]` in favor of `M.unrank(3)`, in order to eventually allow for the notation `M[sqrt(5)]` without ambiguity in the corner case `M[1]`.


I believe `M[sqrt(5)]` would make sense, and I wouldn't mind deprecating the notation `parent[integer]` (as a way of enumerating the elements). But I'd rather do that in another ticket.

What method are you talking about?

Thanks again,

Marc

Fair enough :-) Do you mind creating a ticket for this task?

Sorry, I confused myself with Ring.__getitem__ from another branch ...

Btw: what do you think we should do with IntegerRing.__getitem__ which
calls explicitly PrincipalIdealDomains.__getitem__? Just leave it as
it is?

Cheers,
                           Nicolas

Done (#15885).

For now yes.

Can you please set the ticket to positive review if you are happy with it?
