The problem's not in the polynomial ring constructor per se:

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(MatrixSpace(QQ, 2),'x'); R
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Rational Field
```
Almost nothing works with R because printing of elements is broken, but at least you can construct it! 

The problem reported above lies in the `R['x']` syntax; for some reason, the "list" method of the matrix ring is getting called, and this (of course) never terminates. If you try this with a matrix space over a *finite* ring, the list call succeeds, and it tries to get the element of index 'x' -- which fails because the string 'x' isn't an integer:

```
sage: MatrixSpace(GF(3), 2)['x']

This is "easy" to do for one variable by overriding `MatrixSpace_generic.__getitem__` to check for a string, and then calling `PolynomialRing()`.

But ideally, we would want to offer the same interface that we do when constructing polynomial rings from other rings or fields. Does constructing a polynomial ring over matrix spaces even make sense mathematically? All of the existing code to do this is in `ring.__getitem__`, which sounds right to me, but this is very much not a strong point of mine.

Thoughts?\n\nIn principle, I agree. Unfortunately, matrix spaces currently do not use the category framework by default (one needs to call `M.full_category_initialisation()` first) for efficiency reasons. So the change you are suggesting would not solve the problem with matrix spaces by itself.\n\nAnd I'm honestly at lost as to how to use the category framework with fundamental, widely used parents.\n\nIn our case, it would make sense (despite the issue with matrix rings) to move the definition of `__getitem__` that deals with polynomials rings and the like from `sage.structure.Rings` to `sage.category.rings.Rings.ParentMethods`. But many common rings do not descend from `Rings().parent_class`, so one would need a wrapper in one direction or the other. Since `Rings.ParentMethods` is supposedly the recommended place to add generic stuff for rings in the long run, it would be natural to move the implementation there and provide a compatibility wrapper in `Ring`. Except that `Ring` comes before `Rings.ParentMethods` in the MRO of (most?) rings that use both...\n\n(On the top of that, there is a hack in `Parent.__getitem__` that one needs to be careful not to break...)",

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment:7):
> However what I'm thinking as a solution is that any parent in the category of `Rings` should have a default `__getitem__` which checks for string/list input and returns a polynomial/power series ring resp. Thoughts?

In principle, I agree. Unfortunately, matrix spaces currently do not use the category framework by default (one needs to call `M.full_category_initialisation()` first) for efficiency reasons. So the change you are suggesting would not solve the problem with matrix spaces by itself.

And I'm honestly at lost as to how to use the category framework with fundamental, widely used parents.

In our case, it would make sense (despite the issue with matrix rings) to move the definition of `__getitem__` that deals with polynomials rings and the like from `sage.structure.Rings` to `sage.category.rings.Rings.ParentMethods`. But many common rings do not descend from `Rings().parent_class`, so one would need a wrapper in one direction or the other. Since `Rings.ParentMethods` is supposedly the recommended place to add generic stuff for rings in the long run, it would be natural to move the implementation there and provide a compatibility wrapper in `Ring`. Except that `Ring` comes before `Rings.ParentMethods` in the MRO of (most?) rings that use both...

(On the top of that, there is a hack in `Parent.__getitem__` that one needs to be careful not to break...)

Ok, after talking with Nicolas I think I understand better what is going on and what should be done. Here is an attempt to streamline the implementation of `__getitem__` for general rings.

I *didn't* leave a version `__getitem__` in `ring.Ring` after all, because virtually all rings properly initialize their category by now. The doctests pass, but there is at least one ring (namely `InfinityRing`) rings for which `R['x']` will fail while it used to work, and there may be more. Thoughts?

Hi Mark!

I went through the changes, and overall it looks good! Thanks so much for the cleanup!

Some tiny remarks / suggestions:

- Doc of `__getitem__`
  - TODO -> .. TODO
  - Is Frac nicer than .fraction_field()?
- Doc of _gen_names, line 2: replacing `ZZ['x']` by `ZZ[sqrt(5)]` could make it more meaninful?
- getitem for a matrix space M: could `M[sqrt(5)]` be a meaningful notation to extend the base ring?
  If yes, I'd be in favor of completely deprecating `M[3]` in favor of `M.unrank(3)`, in order to eventually allow for the notation `M[sqrt(5)]` without ambiguity in the corner case `M[1]`.

By the way: shall we use the occasion to also move `PrincipalIdealDomain.__getitem__` in the corresponding category? Or are there some principal ideal domains in Sage that are not yet in the `PrincipalIdealDomains` category?

Speaking of this method: its documentation says "Create a polynomial or power series ring over ``self`` and inject the variables into the global module scope."; the latter statement is wrong, right?

Cheers,
                         Nicolas

Thanks for your review!

No, that was on purpose: the TODO was part of the SEEALSO block. But I added the missing cross-references and removed the TODO line altogether. (I'll push the new commit in a moment.)

> - Is Frac nicer than .fraction_field()?

No idea, I didn't touch this part `:-)`.
Let's mention both.

> - Doc of _gen_names, line 2: replacing `ZZ['x']` by `ZZ[sqrt(5)]` could make it more meaninful?

Same thing here.

> - getitem for a matrix space M: could `M[sqrt(5)]` be a meaningful notation to extend the base ring?
>   If yes, I'd be in favor of completely deprecating `M[3]` in favor of `M.unrank(3)`, in order to eventually allow for the notation `M[sqrt(5)]` without ambiguity in the corner case `M[1]`.

I believe `M[sqrt(5)]` would make sense, and I wouldn't mind deprecating the notation `parent[integer]` (as a way of enumerating the elements). But I'd rather do that in another ticket.

What method are you talking about?

Thanks again,

Fair enough :-) Do you mind creating a ticket for this task?

Sorry, I confused myself with Ring.__getitem__ from another branch ...

Btw: what do you think we should do with IntegerRing.__getitem__ which
calls explicitly PrincipalIdealDomains.__getitem__? Just leave it as
it is?
