Currently, it's quite slow to create an `EllipticCurveIsogeny` object, because it precomputes a huge amount of information about itself. (This blocks the original request at #7262, for instance.) It seems like it would be easy enough (and generally useful!) to speed up creation of isogeny objects, and have them lazily evaluate the appropriate bits as needed. Then one could unify the `multiplication_by_m` and `multiplication_by_m_isogeny` methods, for instance (maybe by deprecating the former?).

That said, I haven't spent much time with the isogeny code -- if there's some obvious reason this is a bad idea, please comment on the ticket.

The performance issues of `multiplication_by_m_isogeny` would be addressed by #32826.
