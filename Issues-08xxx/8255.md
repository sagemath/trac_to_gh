The SageTeX spkg shipped in 4.3.2 has a slightly broken spkg-check: if LaTeX is present, but the tkz-berge.sty file isn't, the example file included with SageTeX cannot be typeset and spkg-check fails. Since I don't assume the user has LaTeX installed, I shouldn't assume that tkz-berge.sty is either.

There are also some documentation fixes, including notably an "egrep" which should be "egrep -v"!

Finally, the license for the documentation is now CC BY-SA; I've dropped the noncommercial clause.

The new spkg is version 2.2.3.p0 in http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/drake/code/sage/st/ . The last version of the spkg is available in the same place, for ease of reviewing.

spkg-check tests whether latex is present, and then it actually runs pdflatex.  I suppose that anyone who has latex will have pdflatex also, but I think this should be fixed anyway: if latex is not found, sage-check exits gracefully, but in the unlikely event that latex is found but pdflatex isn't, then I get

```

Can we run latex instead of pdflatex?  Otherwise, change "which latex" to "which pdflatex", and maybe change the error message from "LaTeX isn't installed" to "PDFLaTeX isn't installed"?

Also, something is wrong with the shell script on Solaris but I don't know what.  If I log into t2.math.washington.edu and try installing with SAGE_CHECK equal to 1, then I get the bad error message even though latex is not found.  Maybe this is because on many systems, 'which latex' produces nothing if latex isn't found, but on t2, 'which latex' does this:

$ which latex                                          
no latex in /usr/local/gcc-4.4.1-sun-linker/bin /usr/local/bin2 /usr/bin /usr/ccs/bin /usr/local/bin /usr/sfw/bin /bin /usr/sbin

I suppose that anyone who has latex will have pdflatex also, but I think this should be fixed anyway:\n\nIn TeXLive (and teTeX), \"latex\" and \"pdflatex\" are just symlinks to pdftex (or pdfetex), so it seems really unlikely that someone would have \"latex\" but not \"pdflatex\".

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A9):
> spkg-check tests whether latex is present, and then it actually runs pdflatex.  I suppose that anyone who has latex will have pdflatex also, but I think this should be fixed anyway:

In TeXLive (and teTeX), "latex" and "pdflatex" are just symlinks to pdftex (or pdfetex), so it seems really unlikely that someone would have "latex" but not "pdflatex". But your idea is correct; I'll change it.

By the way, is that a real example? Do you have a system with latex but not pdflatex? I'm curious to know about it.

It was a contrived example: I renamed pdflatex temporarily but kept latex around.

New spkg up for review at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/drake/code/sage/st/sagetex-2.2.3.p0.spkg.

The spkg-check script now simply tries running latex and kpsewhich, and checks the return code to see if it worked. I think this is more portable, as returning 0 for success is pretty standard. It also uses "latex" throughout, and doesn't use "pdflatex".
