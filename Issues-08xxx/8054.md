Consider the following example:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ComplexField(3322))
sage: p=x^4+54*x^2+154
sage: z=p.roots(algorithm='pari')
sage: e=p-mul([x-z[i][0] for i in range(4)])
sage: n(max(abs(e.coeffs()[i]) for i in range(0,e.degree()+1)))
6.08883742371831e-999
```
This is ok. Compare now with:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ComplexField(3322))
sage: p=x^4+54*x^2+154
sage: z=p.roots(algorithm='numpy')
sage: e=p-mul([x-z[i][0] for i in range(4)])
sage: n(max(abs(e.coeffs()[i]) for i in range(0,e.degree()+1)))
6.06533797844328e-14
```
Clearly the precision given by numpy is only 14 digits, not 1000
digits as expected.

Replying to [@zimmermann6](#comment:8):
> by the way, is there a documentation somewhere explaining how to rebase a patch?

One way is to use [Mercurial queues](http://wiki.sagemath.org/MercurialQueues):

```sh
$ cd SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage
$ hg qimport https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8054/trac_8054.patch.gz
adding trac_8054.patch to series file
$ hg qpush
applying trac_8054.patch
patching file sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx
Hunk #2 FAILED at 4256
1 out of 4 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx.rej
patch failed, unable to continue (try -v)
patch failed, rejects left in working dir
errors during apply, please fix and refresh trac_8054.patch
```
The file `polynomial_element.pyx.rej` is a diff of the changes that Mercurial was unable to apply.  Editing `polynomial_element.pyx` by hand to incorporate the leftover changes and then doing

```sh
$ hg qrefresh
$ hg export qtip > /path/to/trac_8054.2.patch
$ hg qpop
$ hg qdelete trac_8054.patch
```
should write out an updated patch and restore the original state of the repository.  If you choose not to delete the patch from the queue, e.g., for doctesting, then for convenience you can use

```sh
$ hg qrename trac_8054.2.patch
```
to rename it in the queue.  After this, `hg qseries`, `hg qapplied`, and `hg qunapplied` will use the updated name (until you `qdelete` the patch).

There's more on using queues in the [Developer's Guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#being-more-efficient-mercurial-queues), but as far as I can tell, there's no mention of rebasing patches.  Let us know if you have questions.
