My fault from #6647

The method from Gap work only for transitive group.

```
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(3,4)]])
sage: G.strong_generating_system()
[[()], [()], [()], [()]]
sage: G.strong_generating_system(base_of_group=[3,1,2,4])
[[(), (3,4)], [()], [()], [()]]
```

If the first position is not moved by the permutation Group. Errors appears...

I added a patch which solve the problem...

I just changed the stabilizer method because the old version probably didn't point the right record of GAP for StabChain. The new stabilizer method is based form the Schreier's subgroup lemma.

I ran some:

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(10)
sage: H = PermutationGroup([G.random_element() for i in range(randrange(1,3,1))])
sage: prod(map(lambda x : len(x), H.strong_generating_system()),1) == H.cardinality()
True
```
everytimes, it was ok... For the speed, the method strong_generating_system is pretty slow! But I have no better idea and I still misunderstand records from GAP.

Hi Nicolas!

The tests are running.

For the record: I tried to compare the results in the new doctests
with GAP, and I get the following difference:

```
gap> G := Group([ (1,2) (3,4), (1,2,3,4,10) ]);
Group([ (1,2)(3,4), (1,2,3,4,10) ])
gap> Stabilizer(G, 10);                        
Group([ (1,2)(3,4), (2,3,4) ])
```

```
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2),(3,4)], [(1,2,3,4,10)]]) 
sage: G.stabilizer(10) 
Permutation Group with generators [(), (1,2)(3,4), (1,2,3), (1,2,4), (1,3,2), (1,3,4), (1,4,2)] 
```

Well, in fact the results are equal:

```
sage: G2 = PermutationGroup( [ [(1,2),(3,4)], [(2,3,4)] ])
sage: G.stabilizer(10) == G2
True
```

but GAP's result is nicer.

Somehow I thought this needed review, but obviously didn't look close enough.

In any event, I made some improvements to the docstring, which I just added.  I'm going to move them to a new ticket, so as to not mess this up.  Sorry for the confusion.

Release manager - you can remove trac_8030-reviewer-doc-edit.patch - it'll appear elsewhere with a new name.

Hi Misha,

That was a new macro to me, and worked fine in the HTML version of the docs.  Looks like it is part of the AMS packages.  I'll work on a patch as part of #9102, but long-term, does the PDF version need  amsmath or amssymb  packages to be included?  I can investigate later, but have a busy day today, so I'll get a quick fix up first.

Rob
