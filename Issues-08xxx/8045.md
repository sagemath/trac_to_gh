V2 makes the docstrings more consistent and fixes a mistake (I think) in `elliptic_pi`'s docstring.  For comparison, see [Maxima's documentation](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/en/maxima_17.html#SEC68) and [MathWorld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EllipticIntegraloftheThirdKind.html).

Positive review, if my changes are OK.
