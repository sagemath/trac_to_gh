- Perhaps a very short statement about what the row echelon form of matrices over fields look like would be nice.

- line 4035: instead of echelon_form, I think this should be ``echelon_form`` or :meth:`echelon_form`

- line 4085: I'd prefer if this was done in two lines 

    ```
        F = R.fraction_field()
        return self.change_ring(F).echelon_form()
    ```
   so that if an error occurs when creating the fraction field, the line number corresponds to the obvious problem.  (Of course, this would be clear from the traceback anyway...)

Patches install fine, sage builds and runs, docs build without warnings and look fine, passes all tests.

Positive review.  Thanks for everybody's work on this one, my students will appreciate it.  6 lines of code, 4 reviewers.  Hmmm.

Release manager - two patches only, original "rref" and then "rebase-plus-more."  Should be able to kill #3211 also.

You'll notice that my recent patches do that :).

I still think the trac ticket number should be automatically prepended to the commit message by the merge script to prevent mistakes and make it easier for patch authors.
