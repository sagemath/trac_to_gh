I'm not very familiar with [ASTs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) (or [ast](http://docs.python.org/library/ast.html)), but with

```python
import ast
import inspect
import sage.misc.sageinspect as sms

class SageVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor):
    def visit_Name(self, node):
        what = node.id
        if what == 'None':
            return None
        elif what == 'True':
            return True
        elif what == 'False':
            return False
        return node.id

    def visit_Num(self, node):
        return node.n

    def visit_Str(self, node):
        return node.s

    def visit_List(self, node):
        t = []
        for n in node.elts:
            t.append(self.visit(n))
        return t

    def visit_Tuple(self, node):
        t = []
        for n in node.elts:
            t.append(self.visit(n))
        return tuple(t)

    def visit_Dict(self, node):
        d = {}
        for k, v in zip(node.keys, node.values):
            d[self.visit(k)] = self.visit(v)
        return d


def getargspec_via_ast(source):
    if not isinstance(source, basestring):
        source = sms.sage_getsource(source)

    ast_args = ast.parse(source.lstrip()).body[0].args

    args = []
    defaults = []

    for a in ast_args.args:
        args.append(SageVisitor().visit(a))

    for d in ast_args.defaults:
        defaults.append(SageVisitor().visit(d))

    return inspect.ArgSpec(args, ast_args.vararg, ast_args.kwarg,
                           tuple(defaults) if defaults else None)
```
I get

```python
sage: inspect.getargspec(factor) == getargspec_via_ast(factor)
True
sage: getargspec_via_ast(sage.plot.plot3d.base.Graphics3d.export_jmol)
ArgSpec(args=['self', 'filename', 'force_reload', 'zoom', 'spin', 'background', 'stereo', 'mesh', 'dots', 'perspective_depth', 'orientation'], varargs=None, keywords='ignored_kwds', defaults=('jmol_shape.jmol', False, 100, False, (1, 1, 1), False, False, False, True, (-764, -346, -545, 76.390000000000001)))
```
Maybe we can use this as a last resort?  I think we'd first need to remove Cython-specific constructs.

It seems that nearly all of the warnings are from Cython files and that we really need a more robust analogue of `inspect.getargspec` for Cython source.

For the `ElementMethods`, `ParentMethods`, `userchild_download_worksheets.zip` warnings, we can expand the autodoc skip method handler.

The other warnings seem to be reST formatting problems, but I'm not sure about

```
<autodoc>:0: (ERROR/3) Unexpected indentation.

Or for now, a way to suppress all of the error message.

I'm not sure about the `<autodoc>...` errors, either.

Should we copy `autodoc.py` to `SAGE_DOC/common/sage_autodoc.py`, make all of our changes in the latter, and add the custom extension in `SAGE_DOC/common/conf.py`?

I've attached a replacement for the "conf-autodoc" patch that adds all of `autodoc` (as `sage_autodoc`) and, with some redefinition, avoids the `ExtensionError`.

A self-contained `sage_autodoc` should make it less likely that `sage_autodoc` stops working, when we upgrade or test new versions of Sphinx.  (I was just hit by this during experiments with [a development version](http://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/)).

What do you think?
