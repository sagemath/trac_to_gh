alubovsky -

Thanks for the quick review.  Probably best to give the release manager (who makes the final decision about adding this into "official" Sage) some idea of what testing you did.  Such as something about building the developers manual without warnings, output looks fine, mq changes are accurately reported, etc.

Also, please put your real name into the "Reviewer" field and you'll get credit in the release tour and the Trac reports.  ;-)

cc me when you submit that patch of typos you are collecting!

Rob

I was just suggesting you might note the *content* of the changes was correct.  I don't have Mercurial 1.5 installed anywhere, so was working off documantation I could find online (which wsn't always helpful).

In this case, I think the sage-combinat repo is probably OK.
