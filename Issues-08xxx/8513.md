I noticed a few weeks ago while reviewing a patch that important files in the graph theory folder were not appearing anywhere in the reference manual. For instance, functions such as `vertex_cut` or `edge_cut` do not appear, as well as all functions defined only for directed graphs.

At that time, I thought about adding the missing files with the patch, but since there were a lot of warnings displayed by Sphinx while generating the documentation, I changed my mind.

I think it would be a good idea to use this ticket to fix this, but since it touches many files of graph theory, it may be hard to do it in a clean way. Someone has an idea of what would be the best approach ?

Wait until Sage 4.3.4 is released. I expect that release to fix all the warnings relating to building the HTML and PDF versions of the Sage standard documentation. At least, I expect that release to fix such warnings for the reference manual.

Excellent ! Now we appear in the doc, and there are no warnings anymore.

Reviewing your patch, I met a few things that needed fixing in the docs, so if you agree with my modifications, you can set this to positive review.. Thank you !! :-)

I agree with your changes ! I just hope it won't overlap with any other ticket.

By the way, did you test my patch ? When I created it, I used the sage-combinat queue and it worked fine, but here, when I tried to test your patch, I created a clone (with `hg -clone t8513`) to apply your patch on top of mine, but I got the following warning.

It's strange, it doesn't accept to add the two files to the doctree, as if the path was not correct when creating a clone, but was ok with sage-combinat. Does it work fine for you?

Odd.... I applied your patch as usual, and I mean by this not using sage-combinat. It applied fine, and passed all tests. After my modifications, same result O_o

Have you tried cloning the branch using sage -clone instead of doing it manually with hg ?

No, I don't think so. The current organization is a mess.

Yes. The current organization of the graph theory modules, as they appear in the reference manual, is rather unusual. For example, the interface to cliquer appears as the very first link. One would expect something along the following line to be more natural:

   * undirected graph
   * digraph

I have uploaded a reviewer patch that does something about this. With my reviewer patch, the organization of the graph theory modules should be more systematic.

Sure, if you're ok with the result. It's even better if the final reviewer isn't Nathann nor me.

See #8684 for a follow-up ticket, the purpose of which is to organize the graph theory stuff in the reference manual.  I'm not going to do this myself, since I don't know enough about graph theory in general, or the graph theory in Sage, to know how to organize it.
