I noticed a few weeks ago while reviewing a patch that important files in the graph theory folder were not appearing anywhere in the reference manual. For instance, functions such as `vertex_cut` or `edge_cut` do not appear, as well as all functions defined only for directed graphs.

At that time, I thought about adding the missing files with the patch, but since there were a lot of warnings displayed by Sphinx while generating the documentation, I changed my mind.

I think it would be a good idea to use this ticket to fix this, but since it touches many files of graph theory, it may be hard to do it in a clean way. Someone has an idea of what would be the best approach ?

I agree with your changes ! I just hope it won't overlap with any other ticket.

By the way, did you test my patch ? When I created it, I used the sage-combinat queue and it worked fine, but here, when I tried to test your patch, I created a clone (with `hg -clone t8513`) to apply your patch on top of mine, but I got the following warning.

It's strange, it doesn't accept to add the two files to the doctree, as if the path was not correct when creating a clone, but was ok with sage-combinat. Does it work fine for you?

I'm happy with the reviewer patch now.  After rebuilding the docs, all tests pass on sage.math.  Does that mean the whole ticket gets a positive review?
