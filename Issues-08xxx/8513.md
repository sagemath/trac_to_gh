I noticed a few weeks ago while reviewing a patch that important files in the graph theory folder were not appearing anywhere in the reference manual. For instance, functions such as `vertex_cut` or `edge_cut` do not appear, as well as all functions defined only for directed graphs.

At that time, I thought about adding the missing files with the patch, but since there were a lot of warnings displayed by Sphinx while generating the documentation, I changed my mind.

I think it would be a good idea to use this ticket to fix this, but since it touches many files of graph theory, it may be hard to do it in a clean way. Someone has an idea of what would be the best approach ?

Wait until Sage 4.3.4 is released. I expect that release to fix all the warnings relating to building the HTML and PDF versions of the Sage standard documentation. At least, I expect that release to fix such warnings for the reference manual.

Finally, since there weren't too many warnings, I think it's worth trying to fix all of them. This is done in the patch I just submitted.

To summarize, this patch adds the two files digraph.py and generic_graph.py to the reference manual and correct the less than 10 warnings that Sphinx was displaying.

Needs review!

It's strange, it doesn't accept to add the two files to the doctree, as if the path was not correct when creating a clone, but was ok with sage-combinat. Does it work fine for you?

> I don't know much about graph theory, but is there any sense to the current order in the reference manual?  Wouldn't it make more sense for `graph` to come first, for example, rather than `cliquer`?  I don't think alphabetical is the right approach: someone who wants to know about graphs in Sage may very well start at the first link in the "Graph Theory" chapter.  (It might be even better to have an introductory section in the file devel/sage/doc/en/reference/graphs.rst (like matrices.rst, for example).  That probably belongs on another ticket, though.)


I agree with you! There is some cleanup needed in the documentation. But maybe we should wait for it in another ticket. The goal of #8513 is to quickly make the graph documentation available so that one may check if Sphinx builds all right when reviewing related tickets. If it's ok for you, of course.

Sorry for being so late, by the way, Nathann, I'll try to finish this ticket today or at most, during the week.

Yes. The current organization of the graph theory modules, as they appear in the reference manual, is rather unusual. For example, the interface to cliquer appears as the very first link. One would expect something along the following line to be more natural:

   * undirected graph

I have uploaded a reviewer patch that does something about this. With my reviewer patch, the organization of the graph theory modules should be more systematic.

Nod. This needs to wait for another ticket.




After applying [trac_8513_graph_theory_documentation-abm.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8513/trac_8513_graph_theory_documentation-abm.patch) and [trac_8513_graph_theory_documentation-smallfixes.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8513/trac_8513_graph_theory_documentation-smallfixes.patch), I then rebuilt the whole Sage documentation. A long doctest of the whole Sage library resulted in the following failure:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/misc/sagedoc.py
**********************************************************************
File "/dev/shm/mvngu/sandbox/sage-4.3.5-8513-graph-doc/devel/sage-main/sage/misc/sagedoc.py", line 892:

Expected:
    True

```
This is due to adding two new files to the reference manual that happen to be about graph theory, hence the above search returns more matches for the word "tree". My reviewer patch should fix this doctest failure. It needs reviewing by anyone but me. I'm happy with both abmasse and ncohen's patches. Apply patches in the following order:
