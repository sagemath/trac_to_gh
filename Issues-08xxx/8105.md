This is an experimental process for converting Latex documents into Sage worksheets.

Attached archive contains code, configuration files, templates and hints to begin using the system.  See README.txt to get started.

Over time, this should get easier through automation of some of the tasks, and more general with cross-worksheet linking.

Code like the following, added to the Python script, will automate the cut/paste final step, producing a Sage worksheet as the final output.  (Ignore the line outputting W's cells.)

Note that the `.edit_save()` method needs a title as the first line of the string, and this clobbers the title given in the initialization.

```

sage: W = nb.create_new_worksheet('A Weird Worksheet', 'admin')

I am guessing that you'd like this to eventually be an optional spkg, which might let the user do something like

```
sage -tex2sws foo.tex

The notebook code above works for the *old* notebook.  But I've added the right code for the *new* notebook and have the script creating an sws file as output.

So there are now just two inputs to the script (see the README), and one less manual step, but at the small cost that you now need Sage in your path.  Though one could install the new notebook locally and have the script run as pure Python rather than within Sage.

There's now a Mercurial repo in the archive, and I'll work on a bitbucket site soon.

Dan,

Thanks for the testing!  Yes, some sort of optional package that allows for a simple one-step conversion should be the eventual goal.  Next step will be to hack up something that will allow for cross-worksheet links to work and try to convert something book-length.

Can you tell me what you used for the tex4ht routines?  Custom install, or something provided by a distribution?  Either answer will be interesting.  Thanks.

Rob

Hi Robert,

Thanks for testing this out.  I've been basically using tex4ht from source, for the reasons you mentioned above.

My current example uses some tkz-graph code, which builds on the tikz package.

tex4ht complains about some of this code (which I do not think is a surprise since I have no reason to believe tex4ht has any extra support for tkz-graph)

```
l.197 --- TeX4ht warning --- missing \Configure{HColor}{col_lab_a11}{...} (in LaTeX: rgb 0 0 0) --- 
```

this is tkz-graph code to color a vertex label (I think).  I get garbage in the CSS file produced by tex4ht, but everything seems to work - but the labels are absent from the SVG graphics meant for the worksheet.

Do you have lots of experience configuring tex4ht?  It seems a bit of a black art to me sometimes.

Rob

I've updated this considerably over the weekend.  Wiki page now contains my entire linear algebra book as a tar archive of linked worksheets.  There are instructions for creating a scratch notebook and inserting these worksheets into this notebook.

The bitbucket repository is updated, the README.txt is updated and the calling command has changed.  This is now reasonably stable for converting to a single worksheet as an sws file.  Multiple worksheets is still experimental since there is no notebook support.

I'm going to stop posting snapshots here on the assumption that folks can clone and pull from the bitbucket repo - correct me if that is wrong.

I'll probably get a general announcement out later today, and ship Robert an example of the tkz-graph code.

Any testing would be appreciated.  Thanks for everybody's interest.

Robert,

I've posted on the ticket a small example of a combinatorial graph that htlatex complains about, though it does produce a legitimate HTML file and an SVG graphic, though lacking vertex labels.  The calling command is in a comment in the file.  You'll see three complaints, one per vertex, then repeated on each of the three passes.

If you flip the "worksheet" switch it should produce a good PDF version.

Learning how to configure tex4ht to handle this sort of thing would be real helpful.  Thanks for offering to look at this.

Rob, 

I sent you the answer to your email. In short: disable 

```
\SetVertexNoLabel
```
For example, adding something like 

```
\let\SetVertexNoLabel\relax
```
near the end of preamble helps. 

Adding the same to the config file for tex4ht should help as well (config fie not tested).

I wonder, if it is possible to check Typeset button and execute all cells in worksheet before saving into sws file.

Recent changes:

(2) Support for SageTeX (by Robert Marik, very impressive).

(3) Better support for more graphic types.

(4) A pure Python script for greater portability and faster startup.

This should work quite well now for converting article-length latex docs into Sage worksheets.  Multi-section documents (books) are probably busted at the moment due to making single worksheets work better, but it'll come back.
