<div id="comment:0"></div>

For n>2 the answer is correct: 

```
sage: Posets.ChainPoset(3).size()
3
sage: Posets.ChainPoset(4).size()
4
sage: Posets.ChainPoset(5).size()
5
```
However:

```
sage: Posets.ChainPoset(2).size()
1
sage: Posets.ChainPoset(1).size()
...
ValueError: not valid poset data.
```
`AntichainPosets` show the same wrong behavior.
