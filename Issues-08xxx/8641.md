Right now, if I run doctests with "sage -t" and some doctests fail, the exit code is zero -- but it would be very handy to have a nonzero exit code; for example, it would make using Mercurial's bisect command very useful.

In #7995, it seems like sage-doctest is passing back some useful exit codes, so we just need to pass those on in a reasonable way.

I'm following up on the discussion at the end of #7995.

First, the code `err = err // 256` seems okay: putting a print statement at the end of that python function shows that `err` seems to have an appropriate value.

Other parts of the python code in sage-test confuse me, though. It seems to me that the function `test_file` always returns 0 (if the file exists), regardless of the success or failure of the test.  The function `test` has a return value which depends on whether tests passed, but `test_file` never uses the return value from `test`, does it?

In practice, if I run `sage -sh` and then do `sage-doctest` on a file with errors, I get a nonzero return value, but if I run `sage-test` on the same file, I get a return value of 0.

Your patch seems to work as far as hitting Ctrl-C goes, but if doctesting more than one file, if doctests fail, the entire run fails:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/scratch/sage-4.3.5/local/bin/sage-test", line 177, in <module>
    err = test_file(F)
  File "/scratch/sage-4.3.5/local/bin/sage-test", line 125, in test_file
    err = test(F, 'doctest ' + opts + extra_opts)
  File "/scratch/sage-4.3.5/local/bin/sage-test", line 84, in test
    err = check_call(s, shell=True)
  File "/scratch/sage-4.3.5/local/lib/python/subprocess.py", line 488, in check_call
    raise CalledProcessError(retcode, cmd)
subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '/scratch/sage-4.3.5/local/bin/sage-doctest  "devel/sage/sage/combinat/tableau.py"' returned non-zero exit status 100
```
I think we want subprocess.call, not check_call; that will allow us to pass the exit code back up if we want to; "call" returns the exit code, but check_call either returns or raises CalledProcessError. Of course, if you like, we can catch the exception and just use that information.

Also, I think we can avoid the shell=True bit, since our command line is so simple: just do

```
err = call([os.path.join(SAGE_ROOT, 'local', 'bin', 'sage-%s' % cmd), F])
```
and, on line 127, change 'doctest ' (note the space) to 'doctest'.

Finally, if using the subprocess module, I think we get the genuine return code and there's no need for any "err = err // 256" business.

Ah, nice catch. I didn't test with -long. I took your patch and it works properly on my Ubuntu machines and on bsd.math.

wjp, could you take a look at these patches? I think everything is fine, but another opinion would be nice.

I wonder if something else could be happening. Possibly by coincidence, 2 is also SIGINT. Could it be that on sage.math the sage-doctest script itself is being killed by the Ctrl-C instead of the doctest it is running?

After all, if you trigger one of the other error cases (like regular error failures), they are caught on sage.math properly.

Also, a transcript from sage.math:

```
sage: os.system("true")
0
sage: os.system("false")
256
sage: os.system("sleep 100")
[press Ctrl-C]
2
```

So the return values of `os.system` seem to match the specs.

P.S. It does sound like using subprocess.call might be more portable; its docs have fewer warnings about undefined return values.

It does throw a KeyboardInterrupt itself when the called program gets a SIGINT, though, so we may have to catch that to execute the line

```
failed.append(sage_test_command(F)+" # KeyboardInterrupt")
```

I'll take a closer look at the patch later today.

Hmm, on 4.4.4.alpha0, I get a hunk reject: on line 123 or so, my copy of sage-test says

and your patch says

Hrm, I'm not sure this is true -- at least on my Ubuntu machine. With the most recent version of patch, I changed the bit starting at line 84 of sage-test to this:

```
  try:
      err = call(s, shell=True)
      print '%s returned code %s' % (s, err)
  except KeyboardInterrupt:
      print '*****sage-text line 87 caught keyboard interrupt'
      raise
```
I then ran a doctest (combinat/words/finite_word.py) and in another terminal, sent the called process a SIGINT with

```
kill -2 `ps ax | grep finite_word | grep sage-doctest | grep python | awk '{print $1}'
```
The result is:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/combinat/words/finite_word.py"
KeyboardInterrupt -- interrupted after 3.37038588524 seconds!
/home/drake/s/sage-4.4.4.alpha0-test/local/bin/sage-doctest  "devel/sage/sage/combinat/words/finite_word.py" returned code 2
Aborting further tests.
```
The "interrupted after 3.370..." is from sage-doctest, line 668, which then exits with return code 2. It seems like subprocess.call in this instance notes that the process finished, and dutifully passes on the return code -- without raising a KeyboardInterrupt. Then, on line 95 the `failed.append(sage_test_command(F)+" # KeyboardInterrupt")` bit is executed and a KeyboardInterrupt is raised; that causes the "Aborting further tests" to be printed.

If I hit ctrl-c while running the doctest, it gets caught as you would expect:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/combinat/words/finite_word.py"
^CKeyboardInterrupt -- interrupted after 2.75523304939 seconds!
*****sage-text line 87 caught keyboard interrupt
Aborting further tests.
```

What is interesting is, if instead of sending SIGINT to the Python sage-doctest process, I send a SIGINT to the *shell* process created by subprocess.call, it seems to do nothing -- the doctest runs normally, finishes, but the return code is -2; this agrees with [the Popen returncode documentation](http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.returncode). Then, the entire process exits with return code 254, which is a bit strange, but at least it's indicating that something strange happened.

Mpatel pointed out that #9243 already tackles the powers-of-two thing.

I'm giving this a positive review, provided that #9243 is merged too. (I'll review that ticket too.)
