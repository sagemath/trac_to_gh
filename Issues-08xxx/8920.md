Hi Travis,

I rebased the patch (together with Stepan Starosta) and actually we decided to simplify the FiniteEnumeratedSet (the new version was slower). Everything should apply and work on 5.5.rc0.

Vincent

Hey Vincent and Stepan,

In `build_alphabet`, the docstring states that this is an ordered alphabet. I get the following:

```
sage: A = Alphabet([1,3,7,2])
sage: A(3) < A(7)     
True
sage: A(3) < A(2)
False
```
I expected the last one to return `True` since I expected these to be letters in `A` and the comparison to take place in there (not default back to their natural ordering). I also get this:

```
sage: B = Alphabet(['a', 'b'])
sage: B('a')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: Cannot convert str to sage.structure.element.Element
```
and both problems are because the alphabet does not have any element class. These problems were worse before this patch, but I was wondering if you wanted to take care of these here?

`Words` still does proper comparison:

```
sage: W = Words(A); W
Words over {1, 3, 7, 2}
sage: W([2,1]) < W([2,2])
True
sage: W([2,3]) < W([2,2])
True
sage: W([2,2]) < W([2,7])
False
```

Additionally on `is_endomorphism()` (line 1111 in `morphism.py`), it was changed to test equality of the domain and codomain. What was the reasoning for this?

This applied cleanly for me on `5.5.rc0`, I'm curious as to why the patchbot defaulted back to `5.4.rc3`...

Thanks for you work on this,

Travis

Hi Travis,

thanks for reviewing the patch and your comments! I uploaded a new version with two major changes
* a new class TotallyOrderedFiniteSet
* a dependency on #13801

All problems are similar to the ones there are currently with Nathann and posets (#13747) : to be or not to be a facade, that is the question. One major difference with the previous patch is that we provide a class TotallyOrderedFiniteSet which has a facade option behavior and may choose the behavior you prefer.

**How do facades behave**

Facade are the default behavior for alphabets. The disadvantage of having a facade is that the elements need to have their order implemented, i.e., we get

```
sage: A = TotallyOrderedFiniteSet([0,2,1], facade=True)
sage: A(2) < A(1) 
False
```
Another disadvantage of having a facade is that if some elements do not inherit from Element, the constructor raises an error

```
sage: B = TotallyOrderedFiniteSet(['a','b',3],facade=True)
sage: B('a')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Cannot convert str to sage.structure.element.Element
```

**Not using facade ?**

The possible workaround for the two above problems is to have a dedicated element class for TotallyOrderedFiniteSet. If the option facade is set to False, it is what you get

```
sage: C = TotallyOrderedFiniteSet([1, 'a', -4], facade = False)
sage: C(1) < C(-4)
True
sage: C('a')
'a'
```
... but

```
sage: 1 in C
False
sage: 1 == C(1)
False
sage: C(1) == 1
True
```

**Partial conclusion**

 we do prefer having facade = True as a default behavior (as Nathann does).

**About endomorphisms**

Two reason to change is_endomorphism() are: 
  1) the operator <= is not defined on sets
  2) the test was mathematically inaccurate : an endomorphism is a morphism for which domain = codomain (and not just a subset of codomain)

Thanks,
Stepan and Vincent

Yeah, we hit the same problem in Poset, and we worked around it by
having a custom `__call__` function. At some point, we should really fix
it once for all in Parent.__call__.

Hey Stepan and Vincent,

Few more things:

- I get the same doctest failures as the patchbot; you just need to change the tests' output in `finite_word.py`.

- Would it be possible to just have `Alphabet()` (thus removing/renaming the `build_alphabet()`)?

- Could you issue a deprecation warning for `OrderedAlphabet`?

- The `__new__()` function for `OrderedAlphabet` needs a doctest.

- I would recommend for the documentation of `OrderedAlphabet_backward_compatibility`:

```
Versions prior to :trac:`8920` uses the ``Alphabet`` classes with an
argument ``._alphabet()`` instead of ``._elements()`` used in
:class:`TotallyOrderedFiniteSet`. This class is dedicated to handling this
problem which occurs when unpickling :class:`OrderedAlphabet`.
```

- The operator `<=` for `Alphabet` and `Words` did not behave as I expected:

```
# Before
sage: Alphabet('abc') <= Alphabet('12')
False
sage: Alphabet('abc') >= Alphabet('12')
False
sage: Alphabet('abcdef') <= Alphabet('12')
False
sage: Words('a') <= Words('123')           
False
sage: Words('abcdef') <= Words('123')
False
sage: Words('abcdef') >= Words('123')
False

# With the patch
sage: Alphabet('abc') <= Alphabet('12')
True
sage: Alphabet('abc') >= Alphabet('12')
False
sage: Alphabet('abcdef') <= Alphabet('12')
True
sage: Words('a') <= Words('123')     
True
sage: Words('abcdef') <= Words('123')
False
sage: Words('abcdef') >= Words('123')
True
```

- I'm still uncomfortable with the change to `is_endomorphism()` since I would (naively) expect the map `a->a, b->aa, c->aaa` be an endomorphism. The problem is word morphism automatically sets the codomain based on the image. As for the mathematics, yes, if it is a proper subset, it is not an endomorphism, but it naturally extends to one. I believe that having anything that is naturally extendable to an endomorphism should be considered an endomorphism by sage via the coercion model. Also in case you're worried, the above morphism worked with composition.

  If a third party agrees with the changes in the patch, then I would add a warning to `is_endomorphism()` and/or to `WordMorphism` about defining endomorphisms and add the tests

```
sage: w = WordMorphism('a->a,b->aa,c->aaa', codomain=Words('abc'))
sage: w.is_endomorphism()
True
sage: w2 = WordMorphism('a->a,b->aa,c->aaa')                      
sage: w == w2
False
```
  However there is one problem with this, and that is `w == w2` returns `True`. Thus the equality operator will need to be changed to reflect the dependency on the codomain.

Thank you,

Travis

I do not understand the first failure on OS X but I made a small modification in `TotallyOrderedFiniteSet.__cmp__` and made more careful testing.

For the issue about comparisons of "Words", I just removed all related methods as they were needed nowhere and rely on comparison of alphabets which is not possible anymore.
