Based upon Harald Schilly's SPKG for SCIP, here is a patch to enable the use of this solver through the usual interface for LP.

Requires #8172 (though none of GLPK, CBC or CPLEX needs to be installed)

Hi Nathann,

two small things:

* `solve_scip` has no documentation/doctests 
* "the default solver is used (COIN if available, GLPK otherwise)" seems to be inaccurate since you also try SCIP whether it is available
