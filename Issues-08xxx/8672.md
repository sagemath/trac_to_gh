Based upon Harald Schilly's SPKG for SCIP, here is a patch to enable the use of this solver through the usual interface for LP.

Requires #8172 (though none of GLPK, CBC or CPLEX needs to be installed)

wow, thank you!! just one thing, is it possible to enable verbose output if enabled? i don't know which parameter you have to set in Sage's MIP interface, but it is  scip.solver(quiet=False) in scip.

Hi Nathann,

two small things:

* `solve_scip` has no documentation/doctests 
* "the default solver is used (COIN if available, GLPK otherwise)" seems to be inaccurate since you also try SCIP whether it is available
