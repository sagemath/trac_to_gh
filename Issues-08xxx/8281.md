This is not, as I first thought, a coercion problem (there is no coercion between the cyclotomic field of degree 1 aka QQ and a finite field).

The problem is this: when the character eps is not given, it defaults to the trivial character *over QQ*.  It should really be over the base ring of the elements of the given basis instead.  The attached patch fixes this.
