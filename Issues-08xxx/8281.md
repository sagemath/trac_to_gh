This is not, as I first thought, a coercion problem (there is no coercion between the cyclotomic field of degree 1 aka QQ and a finite field).

The problem is this: when the character eps is not given, it defaults to the trivial character *over QQ*.  It should really be over the base ring of the elements of the given basis instead.  The attached patch fixes this.

Looks fine to me. All doctests pass on my system (and I can't imagine any of this behaviour is at all platform-specific); and as an added bonus it doesn't conflict with the other positive-reviewed patches.
