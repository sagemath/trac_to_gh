The `!==` which is causing trouble is due to the

```
if equals_sub:
            s = s.replace('=','==')
```
lines in  `symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string`.  This could be fixed by changing the replace to a regexp, or adding a hack `s = s.replace('!==', '!=')` afterwards.

But all of your tests already work in Sage 5.0, because of the `#` replacement.  It really has to test the original bug report example, otherwise this is trivial.  I suggest

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string as sefms 
sage: sefms("x != 3") == SR(x != 3) 
True
sage: sefms("x # 3") == SR(x != 3) 
True
sage:  solve([2*x==3, x != 5], x)
[[x == (3/2), (-7/2) != 0]]
```
