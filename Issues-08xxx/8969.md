The `!==` which is causing trouble is due to the

```
if equals_sub:
            s = s.replace('=','==')
```
lines in  `symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string`.  This could be fixed by changing the replace to a regexp, or adding a hack `s = s.replace('!==', '!=')` afterwards.

DSM, is this really all one ticket? It's kind of confusing.

-This deals with the obvious problem but not the underlying one, which is that the result is still IMHO underprocessed:
-
-```
-MODIFIED_sage: solve([2*x==3, x != 4], x)
-[[x == (3/2), (-5/2) != 0]]

-[[x == (3/2), 0 != 0]]
-
-when I wanted [].
-```
-In fact, even in cases not involving "!=", it's possible for maxima output -- %union([x = 3/2,  -5/2 # 0]) --  to be insufficiently processed,IMHO:
-
-```
-MODIFIED_sage: solve([2*x==3, (x-4)!^2 > 0], x)

It was all one ticket in my head, but maybe it makes more sense to separate them.  Might as well address the low-hanging fruit.

The problem wasn't really our translation of Maxima's inequality (`#`, which we finally fixed a while ago) but rather that we then had this little hack already.

But all of your tests already work in Sage 5.0, because of the `#` replacement.  It really has to test the original bug report example, otherwise this is trivial.  I suggest

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string as sefms 
sage: sefms("x != 3") == SR(x != 3) 
True
sage: sefms("x # 3") == SR(x != 3) 
True
sage:  solve([2*x==3, x != 5], x)
[[x == (3/2), (-7/2) != 0]]
```
