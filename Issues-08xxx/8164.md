Right now, `plot([x,x^2,log(x)], (x,0,1), fill=True)` does a great job of selecting different colors for the fills.  It would be fantastic if `plot([x,x^2,log(x)], (x,0,1))` also picked a different color for each of the lines.

It would also be nice if `plot([x,x^2,log(x)], (x,0,1), color=<list of colors>)` worked well, just cycling through the list for each plot.

We can just extend `plot([x,x^2,log(x)], (x,0,1), color=<list of colors>)` to do something like `plot([x,x^2,log(x)], (x,0,1), color=colors.rainbow(3))`, or even `plot([x,x^2,log(x)], (x,0,1), color=colors.rainbow)`.

My two cents, regarding making multi-color curves the default...

Perhaps, "Mathematica and Maple do it," is not a convincing enough argument for most (though I think it is), but what about, "because that's what a novice user needs"? Anyhow, this was the impetus for creating #12962, as I was not getting what I expected. I certainly wouldn't expect my (pre-)calculus student to figure out dictionaries and plot-addition to help them distinguish one function from the next.

Regarding B&W readability, yes, this could be a problem with `rainbow()`... and I notice that Mathematica chooses very dark shades for their default colors. However, there is an additional problem with `rainbow()`: sometimes your second function would be plotted with cyan, sometimes your fourth function would be (depending on how many are plotted, in total). For a novice trying to learn the different behavior of assorted functions, this hardly seems like a good idea. 

Regarding alternatives to `rainbow()`, I really like the golden-ratio idea (and it solves my 'additional problem' above). We should start from 'blue' as this is Sage's preferred plot color. Try: 

```
h = golden_ratio_conjugate = 0.618033988749895
graphics_array([circle((.2,.2),.5,facecolor=Color((.666666+i*h)%1,1,.45,space='hsl'),fill=True,edgecolor='white') for i in range(10)]).show(axes=False,figsize=7)
```
and notice that the first ten entries are identical to those here:

```
h = golden_ratio_conjugate = 0.618033988749895
graphics_array([circle((.2,.2),.5,facecolor=Color((.666666+i*h)%1,1,.45, space='hsl'),fill=True,edgecolor='white') for i in range(15)]).show(axes=False,figsize=10)
```

I've implemented the following function in #12962, in case anybody wants to pull that branch and have a look.

```
def rainbow_color(i):
    # note: 'blue' has hue-saturation-lightness values (2/3, 1, 1/2).
    h = golden_ratio_conjugate = 0.618033988749895
    return Color((0.666666666666+i*h) % 1, 1, 0.4, space='hsl')
```

The website [seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/color_palettes.html) suggests we use a "qualitative" color palette, so the [Preiss/Ankerl](http://martin.ankerl.com/2009/12/09/how-to-create-random-colors-programmatically/) idea of using the *golden ratio* is fine. (I actually prefer it to what seaborn does, as the latter would result in the first plot in a list of seven being colored differently than the first plot in a list of six.)

Do we have access to seaborn in Sage? Its attempt to adjust for human perception of hue seems like a good idea. It draws "hue polygons" as a function of brightness, then intersects a given hue's ray with the polygon ([HUSL](http://www.husl-colors.org/)). (If not, one could port over Boronine's [python code](https://github.com/husl-colors/husl-python), on which seaborn is based.)

**Proposed algorithm:**

```
step 1: pick a hue using golden_ratio()
step 2: adjust hue using husl()
```

Note that brightness-level isn't mentioned in the algorithm. We should agree on a level to use, independent of hue. If I understand Boronine's discussion (and [HSL sliders demo](http://www.husl-colors.org/)) correctly, there is only one hue-polygon that contains the color 'blue' (brightness = 32.3).
* We might choose brightness = 32.3, to respect Sage's default plot color. However, the hues along the boundary of the polygon are quite a bit darker than I'd like to see, e.g., "960000" for red, "005900" for green, and "005555" for cyan. 
* Setting brightness = 40.0 gives a pretty good approximation to 'blue' ("3b3bff") with more vibrant colors along the boundary of the polygon, e.g., "c00000" for red, "006e00" for green, and "006a6a" for cyan.
