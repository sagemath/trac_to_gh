In Sage 4.3.2:

```
search_src('is', 'prime', 'field', ignore_case=True)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: search() takes at most 3 arguments (4 given)
```
This is because of a bug in sage.misc.sagedoc: when calling re.search, flags like re.MULTILINE and re.IGNORECASE should be combined using bit-wise or, not by passing them as separate entries in a list.  The attached patch fixes this.

I noticed another `*flags` nearby.  Should we make it `flags`?
