sage: L2.compute_rank()

```

Although for elliptic curves, other programs will be better for analytic rank, I have added this because here it works for any L function

I do get doctest errors due to numerical noise.

The documentation formatting can be improved, see [http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#documentation-strings](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#documentation-strings)

There should be an example for the "rotate" option.

Also, you should probably change the `EllipticCurve.analytic_rank()` function to use the `compute_rank` library call if `algoritm=rubenstein`.
