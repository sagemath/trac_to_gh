I have added two new functions

```

```

Although for elliptic curves, other programs will be better for analytic rank, I have added this because here it works for any L function

I do get doctest errors due to numerical noise.

This is on a Core2 Penryn (Ubuntu 10.04.3 x86_64):

The documentation formatting can be improved, see [http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#documentation-strings](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#documentation-strings)

There should be an example for the "rotate" option.

Also, you should probably change the `EllipticCurve.analytic_rank()` function to use the `compute_rank` library call if `algoritm=rubenstein`.

Positive review.  I have tested this by itself and also checked that when this branch is used to run a copy of the lmfdb website (www.lmfdb.org) the Z-plots work.  Note that the latches on which thie review branch was based have been running on the lmfdb website for more than a year already.

Please can we have this in Sage-6.1!  It will help lmfdb development a lot.
