Hi John,

> A little more data:

{{{
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import _sage_getdoc_unformatted
sage: from sagenb.misc.sphinxify import sphinxify
sage: r = _sage_getdoc_unformatted(Poset)
sage: len(sphinxify(r[:1438], format='text'))
1382
sage: len(sphinxify(r[:1439], format='text'))
0
}}}

I don't know how you got it but this was exactly the problem: an extraneous space at the 1438th character ! Please review.

Note: it would be much better if sphinx raised a warning instead of failing silently. Should we open a ticket for this or report it upstream ?

Binary search: `sphinxify(r[:n], format='text')` for various values of n.

Or maybe it's how we're invoking Sphinx?  I'm not sure.  We could also add the hack I suggested on sage-devel, as a backup plan for similar situations.  That could go on another ticket.
