(sage 4.3.1)

absolute or relative is the default?

```
sage: R = Zp(5)
sage: R
5-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20
sage: R.<a> = Zq(25)
sage: R
Unramified Extension of 5-adic Ring with capped absolute precision 20 in a defined by (1 + O(5^20))*x^2 + (4 + O(5^20))*x + (2 + O(5^20))
sage: R = Zq(5)
sage: R
5-adic Ring with capped absolute precision 20
```
