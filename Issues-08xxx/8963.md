```
The row_stabilizer method of a tableau ignores elements of the tableau which are alone in their row, and this can cause problems.  For example,

```
sage: t = Tableau([[1,2],[3]])
sage: rs = t.row_stabilizer()
sage: PermutationGroupElement([(1,2),(3,)]) in rs
False
sage: rs.one().list()
[1, 2]
```

The expected output is "True" and "[1, 2, 3]".

I will attach a patch fixing this in a few minutes.
