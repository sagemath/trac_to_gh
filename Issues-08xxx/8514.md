 == The solution ==

spkg-install looks a bit of a mess to me. I will need to try to work out what the author intended. SPKG.txt gives no idea of the author or anything very useful. It's contents are just:

```
GAP's databases of finite groups and table of marks.
```

I need to be a bit of a detective to work this out!!

I am happy to test this but I don't have access to a sparc. It seems David Kirkby is saying that it works on a sparc machine but the download+install was a problem?

Anyway, I donloaded it first the installed using sage -i with no problems. Tested that the database of small groups was loaded into the GAP workspace Sage uses and that IdGroup works as expected.

Positive review from me.

Sorry for the delay in replying - I got distracted after the chess game, which I rather annoying only drew against a much weaker opponent. 

Although I can't test the packages, due to a lack of knowledge of gap, it looks fine to me.
