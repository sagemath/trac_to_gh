The spkg has to be brought into place to "merge" it.

Hi William,

Yes, it is just a question of a few extra includes. I haven't fixed it
since I was making a new release of Frobby anyway. That new release
has become rather large since that has been convenient for my
research, and so it is taking longer than expected. I'll submit a fix
once I get back from this conference next week.

Cheers

The error in the ticket mentions srand. What I do is google srand and I get e.g.

 http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstdlib/srand/

it says it is in cstdlib, so add

 #include <cstdlib>

to the cpp file that is having a problem. Then likely another file
will have the same problem due to the same or another missing header,
and after a few iterations of this the problem should be solved. Most
likely all the missing includes are in cpp files, though it is
possible that a header might miss something too. The problem is caused
by older versions of GCC having header A also pull in header B without
the standard saying that it should do so (which is allowed but
unfortunate). The newer version of header A in a newer GCC then stops
pulling in header B, and suddenly it becomes apparent that header B
should have been included where A was also included, but before it was
invisible that this should have happened.

I looked at this for 1 minute:

(1)
There are some tmp ~ files laying around

```
wstein@sage:~/tmp/frobby-0.7.6.p1$ ls
patches  spkg-check  spkg-install  spkg-install~  SPKG.txt  SPKG.txt~  src
wstein@sage:~/tmp/frobby-0.7.6.p1$ rm *~
```

(2) The hg repo has lots of files that have been added but not checked in:

```
wstein@sage:~/tmp/frobby-0.7.6.p1$ ls
patches  spkg-check  spkg-install  SPKG.txt  src
wstein@sage:~/tmp/frobby-0.7.6.p1$ hg status

(3) I don't understand why *upstream* -- i.e., the *author* of frobby-- is adding a ton of patches to his own code.  Why not just fix the src/ directly?

That said, Frobby *does* build with GCC-4.5.0, which is great news!!

I didn't run the build with SAGE_CHECK=yes when I reviewed the package, but I did run the test suite manually. This was on skynet/eno which has GCC 4.6.1 installed. 

I just ran the build under Sage 4.7.2.alpha1 on skynet/eno using `export SAGE_CHECK=yes; ./sage -f frobby-0.7.6.p1.spkg` and both the build and the test suite finish without errors. I'll attach the build log.
