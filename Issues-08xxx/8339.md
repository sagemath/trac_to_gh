From sage-devel 2010-02-22:

Here's a suggestion for the notebook:   allow the admin user to set a
"message of the day" which would be seen either on the login page
itself, or as a pop-up or similar after logging in.

Example:  after the server has just been upgraded to a new version
(like 4.3.3 recently) users could be alerted of this change (and yes,
I know that the version number is displayed right above the login box,
but how many users will actually notice that it has changed)?

As an admin I would also find this useful as a way of communicating
with the user base on my server.

The existence and text of the MOTD should be settable from the usual
admin notebook settings screen.

A great idea. 

If the contents of the message written by the admininstrator could be stored in a plain text file, then it would offer the possibility of generating that file dynamically, to do things like 

* Announce "Merry Christmas" on 25th December 
* Show the load average
* Show the uptime
* etc etc. 

Of the the message was stored as a bit of simple HTML, then again it could be modified outside Sage if wanted.
