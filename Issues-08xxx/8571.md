Currently, the documentation of abstract methods has the following annoying problem, it doesn't appear when asked with "?" from a parent.

```
sage: P = Parent(category=CoxeterGroups())
sage: P.index_set?
Object `P.index_set` not found.
sage:                                
``` 
You have to write:

```
sage: CG = CoxeterGroups()
sage: CG.ParentMethods.index_set?
Type:           AbstractMethod
Base Class:     <class 'sage.misc.abstract_method.AbstractMethod'>
String Form:    <abstract method index_set at 0x219a320>
Namespace:      Interactive
File:           /usr/local/sage/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/misc/abstract_method.py
Definition:     CG.ParentMethods.index_set(self)
Docstring:
       Returns the index set of (the simple reflections of) ``self``, as a
       list (or iterable).

Class Docstring:
       Constructor for abstract methods
[...]
```
This should be fixed.
