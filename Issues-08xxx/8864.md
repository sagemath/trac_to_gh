With attachment:trac_8864-symbolic_zeta.patch you can do this:

```
sage: zeta(3)
zeta(3)
sage: zeta(2)
1/6*pi^2
```

Probably, the changes to `sage/symbolic/random_tests.py` depend on #6949.

I applied that patch to 4.4.1. The new behaviour is ok, I get only one doctest failure in
`lfunctions/dokchitser.py`. With 4.4.1 we got:

```
sage:  h = RR('0.0000000000001') 
sage: (zeta(2+h) - zeta(2))/h
-0.937028232783632
```
With the patch, we get:

```
sage: h = RR('0.0000000000001') 
sage: (zeta(2+h) - zeta(2))/h
-1.66666666666667e12*pi^2 + 1.64493406684813e13
```
I guess the doctest result has to be changed, or zeta(2) changed to zeta(2.), since Sage does not
automatically propagate floats, for example `pi+1.0` remains unchanged.

I uploaded attachment:trac_8864-symbolic_zeta.take2.patch which also includes a fix for the `lfunctions/dokchitser.py` doctest. I simply replaced `zeta(2)` with `zeta(2)` to get a numeric evaluation.

I agree that `pi+1.0` looks strange, but that is not so trivial to fix. :) FWIW, maple also seems to leave that unevaluated:
