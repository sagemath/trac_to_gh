In trying to rid libcocoa-0.9930 of the GNUims that 
prevents this installing on on Solaris (see #8521), I found another problem with this package. It appears that the error codes are not properly checked, so even if there are build failures, the package indicates it has been successfully installed. See below:

There are known test failures that should be listed above.
They are literally 'not yet implemented' errors from the
CoCOA library.   I.e., CoCOA releases purposely don't pass
their own test suite at present.
libcocoa.a built!

To play with libcocoa, type 'sage -sh', then cd to the directory

   /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.3.4.alpha1/local/lib/cocoa-0.9930.p0/src/examples

and try making and running some of the examples.
When you're done, it is completely safe to delete directory:

   /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.3.4.alpha1/local/lib/cocoa-0.9930.p0
