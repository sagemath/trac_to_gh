Consider the following (sage 4.3.3, since 4.3.4 does not compile
on my machine):

```
sage: 2.0^53
9.00719925474099e15
```
This is what we expect: the float `2.0` propagates to the whole
expression.

However:

```
sage: 2^53.0
9007199254740992
```
Note the result is an integer, not a float! Thus the information
about the inexact value has been lost. Same thing with
`2^float(53)` and `2^RR(53)`.

The problem is in the function `__pow__` in sage/rings/integer.pyx.  There we find:

```
        try:
            nn = PyNumber_Index(n)
        except TypeError:
            try:
```
I think PyNumber_Index(53.0) is the long "53".    Thus to change this as you wish, that code must be changed.

William, in fact `nn = PyNumber_Index(n)` raises an error, thus we go to

```
            try:
                nn = Integer(n)
            except TypeError:
                try:
                    s = parent_c(n)(self)
                    return s**n
```
where `nn = Integer(n)` succeeds for n=53.0, but fails for n=53.1:

```
sage: Integer(53.0)
53
sage: Integer(53.1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

TypeError: Attempt to coerce non-integral RealNumber to Integer
```
If `Integer(53.0)` would return an error too, this would fix the problem. However we would
then need a specific method to coerce an integral real number to integer...

On a side note, `int` seems to behave differently:

```
sage: int(53.0)
53
sage: int(53.1)
53
```

Attachment: **[trac_8606_2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8606/trac_8606_2.patch.gz)**

thank you Burcin for your review. I have attached a new patch following your proposal.
However we still get the same (unhelpful) error message for `5^('a')`.
All doctests still pass.

I was referring to the message `"exponent (=%s) must be an integer.\nCoerce your numbers to real or complex numbers first."` as unhelpful. You're right that the message `unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'str' and 'str'` can be confusing as well. It just didn't occur to me since I was staring at the code and expected exactly that.

We could catch the `TypeError` and change the message to "Cannot find a common domain to perform the operation. Please convert your arguments to the desired types explicitly." or something similar.

I'm still changing this to positive review since the patch fixes a bug and a more meaningful error message is just an enhancement.
