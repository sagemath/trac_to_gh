How can one approximate the root of an equation in arbitrary
precision? For example I want the root of log(x+2) = x to
50 digits of precision:

```
sage: (log(x+2)-x).find_root(1,2)
1.1461932206205643
sage: (log(x+2)-x).find_root(1,2,prec=150)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/usr/local/sage-core2/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/symbolic/expression.so in sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.find_root (sage/symbolic/expression.cpp:24383)()

The docs for find_root don't imply that it uses arbitrary precision to me, so I agree it's an omission, but not a bug (i.e., it doesn't claim one thing and do another).  The only mention of precision in the docs (in the xtol and rtol parameters) implies that things work with double precision.

But this is a minor point.  I was trying to clean up the large number of tickets that are classified as "bugs" (which to me means things that Sage claims should work, but don't).

In this case, the error returned indicates that find_root knows nothing about a prec argument, which is appropriate.

I've switched it back so we don't waste any more time fretting about how to classify this ticket.

Attachment: **[trac_8348.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8348/trac_8348.patch.gz)**

the attached patch (produced against Sage 5.9) adds documentation to `find_root`.
Note: I found out that `find_root` is duplicated in `numerical/optimize.py` and in `symbolic/expression.pyx`, which is unfortunate.

Only (part of) the documentation is duplicated; one of the function is a wrapper for the other. It is unfortunate indeed, but that's a problem that occurs everywhere in Sage, so I don't think it really makes sense to open a ticket for that particular instance.
