How can one approximate the root of an equation in arbitrary
precision? For example I want the root of log(x+2) = x to
50 digits of precision:

```
sage: (log(x+2)-x).find_root(1,2)
1.1461932206205643
sage: (log(x+2)-x).find_root(1,2,prec=150)

I do not agree. The documentation does not say that `find_root` only works in double precision,
thus this is a defect (at least of the documentation). Do you agree with that?

In this case, the error returned indicates that find_root knows nothing about a prec argument, which is appropriate.

I've switched it back so we don't waste any more time fretting about how to classify this ticket.

**Attachment:** [trac_8348.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8348/trac_8348.patch.gz)

the attached patch (produced against Sage 5.9) adds documentation to `find_root`.
Note: I found out that `find_root` is duplicated in `numerical/optimize.py` and in `symbolic/expression.pyx`, which is unfortunate.

LGTM.

> Note: I found out that `find_root` is duplicated in `numerical/optimize.py` and in `symbolic/expression.pyx`, which is unfortunate.

Only (part of) the documentation is duplicated; one of the function is a wrapper for the other. It is unfortunate indeed, but that's a problem that occurs everywhere in Sage, so I don't think it really makes sense to open a ticket for that particular instance.
