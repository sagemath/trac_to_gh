How can one approximate the root of an equation in arbitrary
precision? For example I want the root of log(x+2) = x to
50 digits of precision:

```
sage: (log(x+2)-x).find_root(1,2)
1.1461932206205643
sage: (log(x+2)-x).find_root(1,2,prec=150)

I do not agree. The documentation does not say that `find_root` only works in double precision,
thus this is a defect (at least of the documentation). Do you agree with that?

In this case, the error returned indicates that find_root knows nothing about a prec argument, which is appropriate.

I've switched it back so we don't waste any more time fretting about how to classify this ticket.

the attached patch (produced against Sage 5.9) adds documentation to `find_root`.
Note: I found out that `find_root` is duplicated in `numerical/optimize.py` and in `symbolic/expression.pyx`, which is unfortunate.

Only (part of) the documentation is duplicated; one of the function is a wrapper for the other. It is unfortunate indeed, but that's a problem that occurs everywhere in Sage, so I don't think it really makes sense to open a ticket for that particular instance.
