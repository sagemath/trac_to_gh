Sage has Fourier series in the Piecewise class. 

For the FT, I vote to use the normalization so that FT is an isometry from L<sup>2</sup>(R) to itself.

I'll be checking that.

I don't understand what you mean there. Could you explain, perhaps post some latex formulas to show your proposed definition.

The formulas are at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform

I don't think anybody is working on this. I'm changing the milestone to `sage-wishlist`.
