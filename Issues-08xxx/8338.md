Sage has got laplace and inverse_laplace. It should be fairly easy to add fourier and inverse_fourier. An adequate definition for each should be agreed upon though...

Sage has Fourier series in the Piecewise class. 

For the FT, I vote to use the normalization so that FT is an isometry from L<sup>2</sup>(R) to itself.

I'll be checking that.

I don't understand what you mean there. Could you explain, perhaps post some latex formulas to show your proposed definition.

The formulas are at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform
(which in turn refers to Rudin)

I don't think anybody is working on this. I'm changing the milestone to `sage-wishlist`.
