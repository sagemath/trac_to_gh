Looks like I forgot one line in polynomial_rings.rst, indeed (sorry for that). The reviewer patch fixes that and works fine for me. If I understand the previous comment correctly, this means I can give it positive review.

Marc: Avoid putting the following line in your patch file:

```
exporting patch:

It would result in Mercurial ignoring your commit message, so that your commit message won't show up in the changelog.
