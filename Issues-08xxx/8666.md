David Loeffler ran into this bug:

```
sage: K.<zeta4> = CyclotomicField(4) 
sage: m = matrix(K, [186]) 
sage: n = matrix(K, [125]) 
sage: m * n 
[-23087] 
```

(See http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/4f8633d6acf1c4ef# for the full thread.)

The issue is that the bound for what modulus the entries can be computed modulo is off by a factor of 2, because it doesn't take the sign into consideration. (Amusingly, this was basically the same fix as in #4823.)
