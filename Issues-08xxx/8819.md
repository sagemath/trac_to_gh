The same warnings also appear when building the reference manual of Sage 4.4.2.alpha0.

Patch applies fine to 4.4.2.alpha0.  docbuild reference html produced no warnings or errors.  The html files which are changed look ok (not perfect, e.g. some more math markup would be nice, but that is not the issue here).

Hence positive review.
