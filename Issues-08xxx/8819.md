Building the documentation of Sage 4.4.1.alpha2 results in the following warnings in the reference manual:

```
docstring of sage.calculus.interpolators.CCSpline.derivative:7: (WARNING/2) Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
docstring of sage.calculus.interpolators.CCSpline.value:6: (WARNING/2) Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
docstring of sage.calculus.interpolators.PSpline.derivative:7: (WARNING/2) Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
docstring of sage.calculus.interpolators.PSpline.value:7: (WARNING/2) Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

```

The same warnings also appear when building the reference manual of Sage 4.4.2.alpha0.
