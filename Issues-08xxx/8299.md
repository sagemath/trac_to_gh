All good Robert. This patch treats True as 1, False as 0 for arithmetic with non-complex types.

```
sage: [k+True for k in (3, 3r, 3.0, 3.0r, 1/3, 3*I+5)]
[4, 4, 4.00000000000000, 4.0, 4/3, 2]

sage: [k+False for k in (3, 3r, 3.0, 3.0r, 1/3, 3*I+5)]
[3, 3, 3.00000000000000, 3.0, 1/3, 1]

sage: [k*True for k in (3, 3r, 3.0, 3.0r, 1/3, 3*I+5)]
[3, 3, 3.00000000000000, 3.0, 1/3, 1]

sage: [k*False for k in (3, 3r, 3.0, 3.0r, 1/3, 3*I+5)]
[0, 0, 0.000000000000000, 0.0, 0, 0]
