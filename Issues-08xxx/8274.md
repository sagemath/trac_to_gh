The spkg-install file for R would appear to need a bit of an overhaul, and some thought given to what is actually needed. This is hardly surprising, given the version r-2.6.1 of R reached patch level p22 in Sage! 

There appear to be several issues, which perhaps need addressing. 

* The R installation manual http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.pdf documents that fact that there are problems on Linux with early versions of gcc4, but R has been extensively tested with gcc 4.1
* There is a comment the option '--with-libiconv-prefix' is not working on FreeBSD. In fact, this option is not documented at all in the latest R manual, so perhaps that is why it does not work. 
* There is this patch patches/R.sh.in, which does not appear to me do very much at, as the only significant difference between the version in the patches directory and the version in Sage is commented out.

# HACK for Sage to avoid hardcoding.  NOthing
# else has been changed in this file.
#R_HOME_DIR="${SAGE_LOCAL}/lib/R/"
#SAGEHACK#
 }}} 
 The only other change this patch appears to make is probably undesirable, as it overwrites a line of code related to documentation. However, I might be wrong on this, as another patch appears to be related to this. 
* #7865 documents an error on OpenSolaris - I've not verified if this is an issue with the latest R. 
* From a quick read of the R manual, it would appear better performance is possible if certainly libraries exist. It would seem sensible that notices are issues that better performance can be obtained, and how one might go about that. 

Overall, with a previous version having reached patch level 22, I suspect this package needs a bit of a cleanup followed by proper testing on multiple platforms.

#8285 addresses
* SAGE64 problem. Now works on any platform, not just OS X. 
* Removes --with-iconv=no option to configure. 
* Improved testing for X, which allows X to be used on Solaris. 

The other issues with R's spkg-install file still remain.

#9201 and #9668 may also be related. 

Updated the description as well to reflect drkirkby's comment.  However, it is still mystifying to me exactly when R will really compile with png support.

I'm not touching rpy, but you can feel free if you can figure it out.

The problem was with hard-coded paths, not the 
permissions.  Anyway, the fix was easy.  I opened all the files listed 
above by George: 
sage/local/lib/R/bin/R 
sage/local/lib/R/bin/libtool 
sage/local/lib/R/etc/Makeconf 
sage/local/lib/R/etc/ldpath 
sage/local/lib/R/etc/Renviron 
sage/local/bin/R 
and edited obvious lines containing hardcoded paths (using find- 
replace-all at once). 
```

It would be helpful to know what exactly needs to be cleaned up. 
* The hardcoding issues are at #9668.
* The R.sh.in thing is currently used, though it's not clear; #9906 clarifies this

```
+=== Patches ===
+ * src/src/scripts/R.sh.in:
+   Only adds a comment ("#SAGEHACK#") to later, after installation, be
+   replaced with R_HOME_DIR="${SAGE_LOCAL}/lib/R/", by the Python script
+   patches/fix_hardcode.
```
* In fact, #9906 does a LOT of cleanup of the spkg-install.  It looks a lot more readable now.
* #7865 has its own ticket.
* The !FreeBSD issue is something that should have its own ticket, if it's still an issue.
* The gcc4 and "performance" issues aren't really about the spkg-install.

So I propose that this be closed, possibly after opening a ticket for the !FreeBSD issue.  Ideas?
