Hello Florent.

You do exactly what is said in the description. But I noticed a few things that you might want to clean up in **sage/combinat/free_module.py**::

* line 824: change 'depend' to 'depends'
* line 844 mentions 'the argument cc', but there is no argument called 'cc'
* line 847: can you use `isinstance(args[1], (list,tuple))` instead here?
* line 862: there are some formatting issues (indentation; using `:` instead of `::` and missing a blank line afterwards)
* line 893: there is a 'cc' in the comment
* line 902: it seems that the comment `#_prefix = ""` is not necessary

Everything looks good except for one thing. I realize it is not your patch that created the problem, but since you are poking around in this code, I figure you might be able to correct it quickly.

In this block of code:

```
822	        # convert the argument args[2] into a tuple if it is a list. 
823	        # note: if args is too short, we still propagate it down 
824	        # to __init__ to let it handle proper exception raising. 
825	        if len(args) >= 2 and isinstance(args[1], (list, tuple)): 
826	            args = (args[0], FiniteEnumeratedSet(args[1])) + args[2:] 
827	        return super(CombinatorialFreeModule, cls).__classcall__(cls, *args, **keywords) 
```
the comment says that `args[2]` will be converted into a tuple, but I don't actually see it happening. Is this a problem, or just a comment that needs to be deleted?
