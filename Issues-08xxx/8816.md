The documentation states that 

```
        Return the Cremona-Prickett-Siksek height bound. This is a
        floating point number B such that if P is a rational point on
        the curve, then `|h(P) - \hat{h}(P)| \leq B`, where `h(P)` is        the naive logarithmic height of `P` and `\hat{h}(P)` is the
        canonical height.
```

But

```
            sage: E = EllipticCurve("5077a")
            sage: E.CPS_height_bound()
            0.0
```

Clearly that can't be correct as the naive height is not exactly equal to the canonical height. The documentation is incorrect.

It is the documentation which is wrong.  Although the difference h(P) - \hat{h}(P)  is bounded above and below, this function returns the upper bound (since that is the one most used), i.e. it returns B such that h(P) <= \hat{h}(P) + B.

In the example, the generators are (1,0), (2,0), (0,-3).  Naive heights are therefore 0, log(2)=0.693 and 0.  The canonical heights are 0.6682, 0.767, 0.99.  This is consistent with B=0 as that just says that h(P) is no more than \hat{h}(P).

Ah, OK, that makes more sense. I suspected rank, as the first example I tried (and was surprised by) was 389a (which also has integral generators). 

I have implemented some of this (e.g. the computation of alpha) in my min-height stuff, and am hoping to get a ticket up for that soon.
