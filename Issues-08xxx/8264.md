For some reason, swap_row does not work if the elements of the matrix are treated as integers modulo something. The code to reproduce the bug is the following:


```
A = matrix(ZZ, 2,[1,2,3,4])
B = copy(A)
B.swap_rows(0,1)
print B,'\n'
B.swap_columns(0,1) # So far so good
print B,'\n'
C = A.apply_map(lambda x:mod(x,8))
C.swap_rows(0,1) # This line does not work
print C,'\n'
C.swap_columns(0,1) # But this one does
print C
```

The bug reproduces every time on Mac OSX 10.6, SAGE version 4.3.1.
