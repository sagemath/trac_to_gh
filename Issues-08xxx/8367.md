element_class of Subsets is broken

```
sage: s = Subsets(Set([1]))
sage: e = s.first()
sage: isinstance(e, s.element_class)
False
```

Note: this should be caught by setting good categories 

```
sage: s.category()
Category of objects
```

Keywords: **Subsets element_class**

Component: **combinatorics**
