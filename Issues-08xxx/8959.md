Okay, the attached patch lets you specify controls on each side, as well as the width of the interact.  The following code gives the interact in the screenshot attached.

```

var('x')
@interact(layout=dict(top=[['f'],['r','plot_points']], bottom=[['color','thickness'],['adaptive_recursion','adaptive_tolerance']], left=[['gridlines'],['fill'],['frame'],['axes']], right=[['linestyle']]))
def plot_example(f=sin(x^2),r=range_slider(-5,5,step_size=1/4,default=(-3,3)), 
                 color=color_selector(widget='colorpicker'),
                 thickness=(3,(1..10)),
                 adaptive_recursion=(5,(0..10)), adaptive_tolerance=(0.01,(0.001,1)),
                 plot_points=(20,(1..100)),
                 linestyle=['-','--','-.',':'],
                 gridlines=False, fill=False,
                 frame=False, axes=True
                 ):
    show(plot(f, (x,r[0],r[1]), color=color, thickness=thickness, 
                 adaptive_recursion=adaptive_recursion,
                 adaptive_tolerance=adaptive_tolerance, plot_points=plot_points,
                 linestyle=linestyle, fill=fill if fill else None),

Tests pass now and a variety of interacts from the wiki work fine as well.  

It would be nice if there was an easy way to pack things in various ways.  It also makes me desire an option for slider and range_slider to change their lengths, but that's for another day.
