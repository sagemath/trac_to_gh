The layout argument of an interact should also accept a string, maybe a string in the format of either standard python formats (i.e., "<table><tr><td>{a}</td></tr></table>"), or using the simple template classes that come with python (i.e., "<table><tr><td>$a</td></tr></table>").  Whichever convention is chosen, the string is given the dictionary of {'variable name': 'html for variable control'}, or maybe {'variable name': {'label': HTML label, 'control': 'html for control'}}, so you could do "<td>{a.label}</td><td>{a.control}</td>".
