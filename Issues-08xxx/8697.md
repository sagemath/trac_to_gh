In SageObject:

- _test_eq: tests self == self, (self != self) == False, (self == None) == False, self != None (this would have caught #8695)

- _test_hash: test that the result of `__hash__` is an int or that it raises an appropriate exception

- Please Florent, add here what we had thought about

Keywords: **generic tests**
