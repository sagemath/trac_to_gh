Since the upgrade to sage 4.3.2, when one creates a new input cell in the notebook, the cursor is not automatically placed in the new input cell. It is fair to assume that a user that creates a new input cell wants to type in it straight away, so time would be saved if the cursor was put there automatically, as was the case in previous versions of the notebook.

This is a follow-up to #4450.

In fact, there are a *bunch* of situations where suddenly no cell has focus.  I say that there should be *no possible way* to ever make it so that no cell has focus, except maybe something involving `@`interact.
