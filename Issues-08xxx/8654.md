Testing for the exact version number in `sage/tests/cmdline.py` is certainly suboptimal.


`install_scripts()` (in `sage/misc/dist.py`) needs to be updated, too.

Could do some bikeshedding here:

* The following

```sh
    some_program "$@"
    exit $?
```
   should be just

```sh
    exec some_program "$@"
```
   (perhaps followed by `exit $?` if we want to go triple-safe).

* The help messages should use the long option form (`--foo` rather than `-foo`). 

  Stating that `sage -foobar` runs Sage's version of `foobar` foreach foobar \in {A,...,Z} is of questionable value.

* Doing

```sh
if [ foo = bar -o foo = BAR ]; then
    ...
fi

if [ foo = baz -o foo = BAZ ]; then
    ...
fi

if [ foo = whatever ]; then
    ...
fi
```
   is very poor.  It should simply be

```sh
case foo in
    bar|BAR)
        ...
        ;;
    baz|BAZ)
        ...
        ;;
    ...
esac
```
   which is faster, safer, easier to read and also less error-prone.


One could change *all* of these at once on a separate ticket, but it's IMHO dumb to always replicate the same bad code again.  So I'd change it at least in the new parts (and in general those one touches anyway or the ones near to them.)

See #21, although that patch will probably need to get rewritten with argparse now that optparse has been deprecated.
