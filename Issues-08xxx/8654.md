Testing for the exact version number in `sage/tests/cmdline.py` is certainly suboptimal.


`install_scripts()` (in `sage/misc/dist.py`) needs to be updated, too.

Could do some bikeshedding here:

* The following

```sh
    some_program "$@"
    exit $?
```
   should be just

```sh
    exec some_program "$@"
```
   (perhaps followed by `exit $?` if we want to go triple-safe).

* The help messages should use the long option form (`--foo` rather than `-foo`). 

  Stating that `sage -foobar` runs Sage's version of `foobar` foreach foobar \in {A,...,Z} is of questionable value.

* Doing

```sh
if [ foo = bar -o foo = BAR ]; then
    ...
fi

if [ foo = baz -o foo = BAZ ]; then
    ...
fi

if [ foo = whatever ]; then
    ...
fi
```
   is very poor.  It should simply be

```sh
case foo in
    bar|BAR)
        ...
        ;;
    baz|BAZ)
