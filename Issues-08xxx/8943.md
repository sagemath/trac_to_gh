The function *series* can not give the power series expansion of f(x)=(1+arctan(x))**(1/x) , while *taylor* succeeds. Note that the function f can be continuously extended at 0.

```
sage: taylor((1+arctan(x))**(1/x), x, 0, 3)
1/16*x^3*e + 1/8*x^2*e - 1/2*x*e + e
sage: ((1+arctan(x))**(1/x)).series(x==0, 3)
RuntimeError: power::eval(): division by zero
```


Subsidiary question: why the functions *taylor* and *series* perform similar tasks, but differently? 

Depends on #11317

Component: **calculus**

Keywords: **series, taylor**

```
