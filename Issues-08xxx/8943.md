The function *series* can not give the power series expansion of f(x)=(1+arctan(x))**(1/x) , while *taylor* succeeds. Note that the function f can be continuously extended at 0.

```
sage: taylor((1+arctan(x))**(1/x), x, 0, 3)
1/16*x^3*e + 1/8*x^2*e - 1/2*x*e + e
sage: ((1+arctan(x))**(1/x)).series(x==0, 3)
RuntimeError: power::eval(): division by zero
```


Subsidiary question: why the functions *taylor* and *series* perform similar tasks, but differently?

Looks like this is in Ginac/Pynac.  But maybe it makes sense *not* to have an answer here?  After all, the technical definition would imply that f doesn't have a Taylor series there, if it doesn't even exist.  Probably Maxima is more lenient about such things.

This is nice, and the other examples given by the author also did not work before but now do:

```
sage: (cos(x)^(sin(x)/x)).series(x==0,9)
1 + (-1/2)*x^2 + 1/8*x^4 + (-1/30)*x^6 + 631/120960*x^8 + Order(x^9)
sage: ((1+x)^(1/x)).series(x==0,9)
(e) + (-1/2*e)*x + (11/24*e)*x^2 + (-7/16*e)*x^3 + (2447/5760*e)*x^4 + (-959/2304*e)*x^5 + (238043/580608*e)*x^6 + (-67223/165888*e)*x^7 + (559440199/1393459200*e)*x^8 + Order(x^9)
```

Also, the new series does correctly approximate the original function near x=0 :)
