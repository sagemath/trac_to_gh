Cygwin is a lot pickier about missing symbols so more libraries need to be linked in to the extension modules.  This also fixes some issues on other systems: see then end of this thread http://www.mail-archive.com/sage-devel@googlegroups.com/msg38859.html

(i.e. `local/bin/sage-build`, `devel/sage/module_list.py`, `devel/sage/setup.py`, and perhaps `devel/sage/c_lib/SConstruct`)

Btw, at least all Sage library C files (of course including those generated by `cython`) compile with gcc and `-std=c99 [-pedantic]`, though not really standard-conformant. (C++ files currently don't, neither with `-std=c++98` nor `c++0x`.)

How can that be? At least on Linux, there's no `libpng.so`, just `libpng12.so`, so reverting it wouldn't build on other systems.

The problem with c_lib/SConstruct is that nobody to my knowledge knows SCons well. I know it needs something to add the -m64 flag to CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS on platforms other than OS X (darwin). Something like (untested)

```
if env['PLATFORM'] != "darwin" and os.environ['SAGE64']=="yes" 
        env.Append( CFLAGS="-O2 -g -m64" )
        env.Append( CXXFLAGS="-O2 -g -m64" )
        env.Append( LINKFLAGS="-m64" )
```

This seems a problem in general with Sage and SCons - nobody really knows what they are doing with it.

The linked thread does mention some problems with `gmp`, but not in the `symbolic` modules.

PS for @williamstein: the fact that I'm even *able* to ask this question is because I can check the git history to see where this dependency was added. This is exactly what open development is about.

I can only guess this was some kind of overkill, caused by confusing the `pynac` *extension module* with the external Pynac library `libpynac`.  While the former indeed uses GMP and hence needs to get linked with it (*and* in addition `libpynac`), the latter does not.
