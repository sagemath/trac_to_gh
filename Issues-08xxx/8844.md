The reviewer patch actually breaks things on Cygwin.  It should be reverted.

How can that be? At least on Linux, there's no `libpng.so`, just `libpng12.so`, so reverting it wouldn't build on other systems.

The problem with c_lib/SConstruct is that nobody to my knowledge knows SCons well. I know it needs something to add the -m64 flag to CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS on platforms other than OS X (darwin). Something like (untested)

```
if env['PLATFORM'] != "darwin" and os.environ['SAGE64']=="yes" 
        env.Append( CFLAGS="-O2 -g -m64" )
        env.Append( CXXFLAGS="-O2 -g -m64" )
        env.Append( LINKFLAGS="-m64" )
```

This seems a problem in general with Sage and SCons - nobody really knows what they are doing with it.

Oops, I posted my comment about SCons under the wrong comment. It was meant to be under that of leif, who wrote:

*It seems the whole Sage library build process needs clean-ups... (i.e. local/bin/sage-build, devel/sage/module_list.py, devel/sage/setup.py, and perhaps devel/sage/c_lib/SConstruct)*

Did anybody remember why `gmp` was added as dependency to the various `symbolic` modules? I don't believe those actually depend on `gmp`. This change is partially responsible for #19602.

The linked thread does mention some problems with `gmp`, but not in the `symbolic` modules.

PS for @williamstein: the fact that I'm even *able* to ask this question is because I can check the git history to see where this dependency was added. This is exactly what open development is about.

I can only guess this was some kind of overkill, caused by confusing the `pynac` *extension module* with the external Pynac library `libpynac`.  While the former indeed uses GMP and hence needs to get linked with it (*and* in addition `libpynac`), the latter does not.
