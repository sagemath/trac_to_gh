Looks good.

We should (more generally) wrap Singular's slocus function which computes the singular locus of an ideal in a multivariate polynomial ring, but that should be a new ticket.

This doesn't apply cleanly; it apparently conflicts with a patch merged into Sage 4.4.alpha0.  Please rebase it against 4.4.alpha0, and we'll try hard to get this into 4.4.alpha1.
