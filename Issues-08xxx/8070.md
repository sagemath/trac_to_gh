That's fine. In future, it would be helpful if you could show evidence that the package is building ok, as 

```

does not prove very much. Plenty of packages claim to 'sucessfully' install in Open Solaris, yet in practice they do not. In this case, we can see:

```

and using 'file' in the directory, I can indeed see the binaries are now 64-bit.

```

So a positive review from me. 

Sorry to sometimes ask for extra things, but it is easier for the reviewer if he can see evidence this fixes the bug. As I've done many of these Solaris fixes, and see some from  you, I can see ways of improving some things.
