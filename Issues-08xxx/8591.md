Yet another solver, which has been reported to be interesting several times...

It shouldn't be hard to implement as it can be done through Coin's interface, as Cplex and Cbc, so it should mainly consist in a copy of a 15-lines file and a basic update of Cbc's package

Looking at the Gurobi team, it certainly looks interesting!

It looks like a bunch of the CPLEX people split off and started Gurobi.

OOps, I did it again.... Could this ticket be closed ? I created this ticket a loooong time ago, and finally implemented it in a new ticket (#11949) `:-)`
