TypeError: unable to coerce
```

Perhaps this is a "feature request", but it seems like a pretty basic feature...

(It works fine for prime fields)

Previously, Sage performed this reduction without complaint.  Some questions:
* Do we want a coercion from `R` to `S`?  Mathematically, this coercion is very similar to the one from `ZZ` to `Zmod(N)`, so I think the answer is yes.
* If there is a coercion, what should its behavior be on elements without enough precision, as in the example above?  A `PrecisionError` seems reasonable, but normally coercions don't raise errors....
* The coercion model demands that if there is a coercion between two parents, then that morphism should be used as the conversion as well (this is implemented in `discover_convert_map`, which calls `_internal_coerce_map_from` as the first step).  So we can't have different behavior for the coercion and the conversion from `R` to `S`.
* It's pretty annoying to have these kind of `PrecisionError`s in conversions.  For example, conversions are used in `change_ring` on polynomials, and there are plenty of examples in the Sage library where `change_ring` that trigger this kind of `PrecisionError`.

```
sage: R1 = RealIntervalField(10)
sage: C1 = ComplexIntervalField(10)
sage: C1.coerce_map_from(R1)

Call morphism:
  From: Real Interval Field with 10 bits of precision
  To:   Complex Interval Field with 10 bits of precision
sage: C1 = ComplexIntervalField(11)
sage: C1.coerce_map_from(R1)
sage: C1.convert_map_from(R1)

Call morphism:
  From: Real Interval Field with 10 bits of precision
  To:   Complex Interval Field with 11 bits of precision
```
So, there's a precedent in the archimedean code to only have a convert map, not a coerce map, when mapping from a lower precision to a higher precision. For Zp(5) to Zmod(5<sup>5</sup>), you're mapping an inexact ring to an exact ring, so this would suggest that there should be no coercion, only a conversion.

Yeah, I think coercion to the residue field makes sense, though a PrecisionError will still need to be raised for O(5<sup>0</sup>); I think that's reasonable since O(5<sup>0</sup>) basically means you have no idea what element of Zp you have!

The relevant docstring is

```

    EXAMPLES::

 	sage: W.<w> = Zp(5).extension(x^2 - 5)

```
richcmp((type(self), self.domain(), self.codomain()), (type(other), other.domain(), other.codomain()), op)
```
you compare types, which is not allowed in python3.

**EDIT**
Instead you can do something like

```
if type(self) != type(other):
    return NotImplemented
return richcmp(...)
