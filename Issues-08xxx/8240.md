sage: K.<a> = Qq(25)
sage: F = K.residue_field()
sage: F(a)
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
TypeError: unable to coerce
```

Perhaps this is a "feature request", but it seems like a pretty basic feature...

(It works fine for prime fields)

Previously, Sage performed this reduction without complaint.  Some questions:
* Do we want a coercion from `R` to `S`?  Mathematically, this coercion is very similar to the one from `ZZ` to `Zmod(N)`, so I think the answer is yes.
* If there is a coercion, what should its behavior be on elements without enough precision, as in the example above?  A `PrecisionError` seems reasonable, but normally coercions don't raise errors....
* The coercion model demands that if there is a coercion between two parents, then that morphism should be used as the conversion as well (this is implemented in `discover_convert_map`, which calls `_internal_coerce_map_from` as the first step).  So we can't have different behavior for the coercion and the conversion from `R` to `S`.
* It's pretty annoying to have these kind of `PrecisionError`s in conversions.  For example, conversions are used in `change_ring` on polynomials, and there are plenty of examples in the Sage library where `change_ring` that trigger this kind of `PrecisionError`.

Any suggestions?

<a id='comment:9'></a>I just checked the following:

```
sage: R1 = RealIntervalField(10)
sage: C1 = ComplexIntervalField(10)
sage: C1.coerce_map_from(R1)

Call morphism:
  From: Real Interval Field with 10 bits of precision
  To:   Complex Interval Field with 10 bits of precision
sage: C1 = ComplexIntervalField(11)
sage: C1.coerce_map_from(R1)
sage: C1.convert_map_from(R1)

Call morphism:
  From: Real Interval Field with 10 bits of precision
  To:   Complex Interval Field with 11 bits of precision
```
So, there's a precedent in the archimedean code to only have a convert map, not a coerce map, when mapping from a lower precision to a higher precision. For Zp(5) to Zmod(5<sup>5</sup>), you're mapping an inexact ring to an exact ring, so this would suggest that there should be no coercion, only a conversion.

Yeah, I think coercion to the residue field makes sense, though a PrecisionError will still need to be raised for O(5<sup>0</sup>); I think that's reasonable since O(5<sup>0</sup>) basically means you have no idea what element of Zp you have!

I agree that it's kind of weird.  I'd really like for them both to be coercions, but I explain above why that doesn't seem to be possible.

I think it's probably okay to also delete the coercion to the residue field.  For integers, you really want to be able to ask for `a+1` if `a` is an element of `Zmod(N)`, but I think that this is a lot less important for p-adics.

If nobody else has input, I can go ahead and make this change.

richcmp((type(self), self.domain(), self.codomain()), (type(other), other.domain(), other.codomain()), op)

you compare types, which is not allowed in python3.
