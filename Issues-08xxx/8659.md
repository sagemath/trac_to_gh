Here is the thread:

This looks similar to #8540, though it is a long standing issue, not caused by that ticket:

Interestingly, these all work (starting from the above example in my post):

```
sage: b^(1/3)
2
sage: b^(1/4)
8^(1/4)
sage: b^(-1/4)
1/8*8^(3/4)
```

So it seems that b^(1/2) is the only problem?

On the other hand, it seems like the problem is in try_symbolic_power.  When I change that function to:

```
    global __pynac_pow
    print "entering try_symbolic_power: ", obj, p, "; __pynac_pow is ", __pynac_pow
    if __pynac_pow:
        __pynac_pow = False
        print "    set __pynac_pow to False and return None"
        return None
    else:
        try:
            __pynac_pow = True
            print "    Try SR powers: ", ring.SR(obj), ring.SR(p)
            return ring.SR(obj)**ring.SR(p)
        finally:
            print "        and then set __pynac_pow to False"
            __pynac_pow = False
```

then I get:

Now that we have the `hold()` function for symbolic expressions (#9879), we don't need `sage.symbolic.power_helper`. attachment:trac_8659-hold_powers.patch removes this module, and fixes the problem described.

This ticket depends on #9879.

At first I thought I minded this discrepancy, but I think that maybe that's okay, given they really do live in different places.  At the same time, in theory then we should be holding anything that might ever be multivalued.  Like a square root.

```
sage: 8^(1/2)
2*sqrt(2)
sage: I.pyobject().parent()
Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
sage: I.pyobject().parent()(8)^(1/2)
sqrt(8)
```
In particular, what do we want here?

```
sage: a= matrix([[2,2,I],[2,2,-I],[I,-I,0]]).determinant();
sage: b = a.pyobject()
sage: b^(-1/2); a^(-1/2)
1/sqrt(8)
1/8*sqrt(8)
```

Also, is 

```
sage: (t^2)^(1/4) 
64^(1/4) 
```
intended to test

```
return SR(nbase).power(nexp*exp, hold=True)
```
But the powers weren't multiplied, because `SR(base)` already is just 64.  

Similarly, 

```
sage: 8^(-1/5) 
```
can't be to test the change in that file, because 8 isn't rational.  

Or am I missing something?   Sorry if I've misinterpreted something; otherwise this is a good fix, it seems.

attachment:trac_8659-hold_powers.take2.patch should address the issues in [comment:7](#comment%3A7) at the cost of magically changing the type of the coefficients to rational.

The test

```
sage: 8^(-1/5)
```
does test the `__pow__` method of rationals, since the `__pow__` method of `Integer` casts the base to a rational and calls pow again.

Hmm, that didn't format right.  I meant to say, there are two occurrences of 

```
infite loops

I think it would be helpful to have a doctest or two for each branch of the number field code.  Some are no doubt already in there, but all?  For instance, I would have thought that `(t<sup>2)</sup>(1/4)` is testing `return nbase.power(pexp * exp, hold=True) `, but it doesn't give `8^(1/2)` like I would have thought from that (so it must be from the `if not SR` branch); so it would be good to have one for that branch.

Also, can you think of a place where putting the rational power in the denominator could cause something to break?    Is that standard practice in this kind of computer algebra?  For instance, Maxima does not do this.

```
(%i3) 2^(-1/2);
(%o3) 1/sqrt(2)
```

Sorry if these are dumb questions.

I updated the patch to fix the typos.

> I think it would be helpful to have a doctest or two for each branch of the number field code.  Some are no doubt already in there, but all?  For instance, I would have thought that `(t<sup>2)</sup>(1/4)` is testing `return nbase.power(pexp * exp, hold=True) `, but it doesn't give `8^(1/2)` like I would have thought from that (so it must be from the `if not SR` branch); so it would be good to have one for that branch.


That branch is tested by these:

```
            sage: sqrt2^(1/5)
            2^(1/10)
            sage: sqrt2^sqrt2
            2^(1/2*sqrt(2))
```

> Also, can you think of a place where putting the rational power in the denominator could cause something to break?    Is that standard practice in this kind of computer algebra?  For instance, Maxima does not do this.

> ```
> (%i3) 2^(-1/2);
> (%o3) 1/sqrt(2)

AFAICT, GiNaC assumes this normal form.


On another note... IMHO, a simple typo in comments within source code, or not documenting which doctest corresponds to which branch in the code is justification to switch a ticket to `needs_work`. You might not be satisfied with the work, but it is possible that someone else will give a positive review, especially since this is a `critical` ticket.

Okay, I now get all the branches, and it makes sense.  Thanks for hanging in there with me!  Also, good catch and test on the powers less than -1.

I'm not putting 'needs work' :) but also not yet positive review.   In [comment:7](#comment%3A7), we see the equivalent of this inconsistency: 

```
sage: a= matrix([[2,2,I],[2,2,-I],[I,-I,0]]).determinant();
sage: a; type(a)
8
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: b = SR(8)
sage: type(b)
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: a.operands(); a.operator()
[]
sage: b.operands(); b.operator()
[]
sage: b^(-1/2)
1/4*sqrt(2)
sage: a^(-1/2)
1/8*sqrt(8)
sage: a^(1/2)
sqrt(8)
sage: b^(1/2)
2*sqrt(2)
```

I thought that maybe this was because (for reasons unclear to me) we had entered 

```

        if not PY_TYPE_CHECK(self, Rational):
```
but 

```
sage: isinstance(b,Rational)
False
sage: isinstance(a,Rational)
False
```
so I must be missing something obvious.  Anyway, I can't see why these should return different things, and we still have the switch to rational that should take care of this:

```
                res = QQ(base)**exp 
```



Also, the documentation in rational.pyx still says

```

    def __pow__(self, n, dummy):
        """
        Raise self to the integer power n.
        
```
though I think this code has been used for non-integer powers for quite a while.

But perhaps another reviewer will see what is going on in these cases, my apologies if I'm wasting time.
