IDEAS:

1. Look for complex.h on this page:  http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2006-07/threads.html#00763  That has some ideas.

2. I think Mike Hansen said that he recently released (then unreleased!?) numpy-1.4 had a drop-in complex.h?

I put in some fake #defines to get past the complex.h import problem.  Then linking fails due to no libcblas. 

```
gcc -shared -Wl,--enable-auto-image-base build/temp.cygwin-1.7.1-i686-2.6/C/base.o build/temp.cygwin-1.7.1-i686-2.6/C/dense.o build/temp.cygwin-1.7.1-i686-2.6/C/sparse.o -L/home/wstein/build/sage-4.3.3.alpha0/local/lib -L/home/wstein/build/sage-4.3.3.alpha0/local/lib/python2.6/config -lm -llapack -lcblas -lf77blas -latlas -lgfortran -lpython2.6 -o build/lib.cygwin-1.7.1-i686-2.6/cvxopt/base.dll
/usr/lib/gcc/i686-pc-cygwin/4.3.4/../../../../i686-pc-cygwin/bin/ld: cannot find -lcblas
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
```
Changing the libraries= line in setup.py to

```
    libraries = ['m','lapack','blas','gfortran']
```
(like it is for OS X) gets past this problem.

I think it may be easy to implement complex.h, at least enough for cvxopt, just using what is in GSL...  since cvxopt doesn't need much.  

To get cvxopt to build, I replaced all references to atlas and cblas by "blas".    This *did* work.  I've attached my hacked setup.py (based on the one in cvxopt-1.1.2.p2) to this ticket just 'cause:

Replying to [drkirkby](#comment%3A6):
> complex.h is the header file that you need, but you almost certainly need the C99 libraries too. So it's not as simple as just adding a complex.h file.

And the complex.h needs to match the C99 libraries.

> I'm cc'ing Peter on this, as I know he has (or at least did have), C99 issues on FreeBSD.

cephes was introduced to provide C99 functions for Cygwin.  FreeBSD does not provide a complete C99 library and I've written a number of tickets to use cephes to provide the missing functionality.  See trac tickets #9543 and #9601 (both of which include patches, though they haven't been converted to new SPKG files yet).  numpy also needs the same patch as #9601 but I haven't updated the relevant trac ticket for that yet.

Note that the patch in #9543 relies on some ELF shared library magic (and installs a $SAGE_LOCAL/libm.so that includes the cephes functions and automatically falls back to the base libm.so for other functions) that may not work in Cygwin (on Cygwin, cephes installs C99 libraries as $SAGE_LOCAL/libm{c,d,f,l}.a and any other SPKGs needing to reference those libraries will need patches to their link steps).
