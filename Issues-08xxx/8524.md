In order to be easily inherited from, `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets` should have a private `__classcall__` method. Indeed most of the time, when inheriting from it, the family used in the union will be constructed in the `__init__` method of the subclass. Having `__classcall__` inherited force the user to have its own `__classcall__`. 

There isn't yet any example of that in Sage but there are at least three of them comming in sage-combinat (trees, parking functions, Transitive groups). Dozens of them will follow along the cleanup of combinat. 

However, as expected :-), there is already a counterexample (crystal). I took care of it. Due to the need of both behavior, I've written two small demo examples of this two use cases.

I also took the chance to fixe some typos in the doc.

The patch should be ready for review. I've one question: There is a very long doc in the class but nothing in the `__init__` nor in the file itself. Any idea about what is best here ?
