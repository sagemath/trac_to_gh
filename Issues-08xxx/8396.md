element_class of Subsets is broken

```
sage: s = Subsets(Set([1]))
sage: e = s.first()
sage: isinstance(e, s.element_class)
False
```

Note: this should be caught by setting good categories

```
sage: s.category()
Category of objects
```

There is a little mistake I made a lot with the Trac...

Samuele, you have to export your patch and after upload them to the trac. Clic on your patch on the trac and after, read on the top the information : 
*****************************************************************
#8367: fix element_class of Subsets

diff --git a/sage/combinat/subset.py *****************************************************************

It's to short because you probably just upload the patch from .hg/patches/

use: sage -hg trac_8396_subsets_element_class_fix-sg.patch > your_favorite_directory/trac_8396_subsets_element_class_fix-sg.patch

and upload to the trac the exported patch, you will see more hg information at the top of the patch.

Once you do that, I will have a look on your fix!

Bye Samuele.

Perfect! Now to inform any reviewer that you think your job is over on this problem, you should set your ticket as 'needs review' and thus, some people will download it and test it...

If you do so, I will review it. If you don't change the status, we will have the impression you are still working on the problem and you don't want the review now.
