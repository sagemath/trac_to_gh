Looks good, no warnings when building the reference manual for these two files, and the relevant pages look good.  Nice solution.

On one hand, this seems to fix the two particular doctests in question.  On the other, it's not perfect. I can see two problems, one of which I know how to fix:

- if the source has the (unlikely) form `def f({(1,2,3): True}): ...`, then this version (and all previous versions) will think that the arg spec ends after `(1,2,3):`.  The function `_sage_getargspec_from_ast` can actually handle this kind of thing, though, so I think we should pass the entire source code to it, rather than truncate at the first `):`.

```
proxy = 'def dummy' + source[beg:end] + '\n    return'

 to

```
proxy = 'def dummy' + source[beg:] + '\n    return' 
```

- if the docstring has type information, it can't handle it.  I don't know what to do about this, or if it's worth it.

Should we fix the first problem and then go ahead with this?  I also notice that the methods for `SageArgSpecVisitor` don't have doctests.  Is that possible for these sorts of things?  I know nothing about ast.

V3:

* Implements your idea to pass the entire source code.  I've included the previous version as a fallback, since `LLL` has a Cython-only construct:

```python
R = <Matrix_integer_dense>self.new_matrix(entries=map(ZZ,A.list()))
```

* Has extra, more direct doctests of `SageArgSpecVisitor`'s methods.

I don't mind leaving the second problem for another day.
