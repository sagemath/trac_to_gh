* Implements your idea to pass the entire source code.  I've included the previous version as a fallback, since `LLL` has a Cython-only construct:

```python
R = <Matrix_integer_dense>self.new_matrix(entries=map(ZZ,A.list()))
```

* Has extra, more direct doctests of `SageArgSpecVisitor`'s methods.

I don't mind leaving the second problem for another day.
