On one hand, this seems to fix the two particular doctests in question.  On the other, it's not perfect. I can see two problems, one of which I know how to fix:

- if the source has the (unlikely) form `def f({(1,2,3): True}): ...`, then this version (and all previous versions) will think that the arg spec ends after `(1,2,3):`.  The function `_sage_getargspec_from_ast` can actually handle this kind of thing, though, so I think we should pass the entire source code to it, rather than truncate at the first `):`.  That is, delete line 470 and change line 471 from

```
proxy = 'def dummy' + source[beg:end] + '\n    return' 
```
 to

```
proxy = 'def dummy' + source[beg:] + '\n    return' 
```

- if the docstring has type information, it can't handle it.  I don't know what to do about this, or if it's worth it.

Should we fix the first problem and then go ahead with this?  I also notice that the methods for `SageArgSpecVisitor` don't have doctests.  Is that possible for these sorts of things?  I know nothing about ast.

V3:

* Implements your idea to pass the entire source code.  I've included the previous version as a fallback, since `LLL` has a Cython-only construct:

```python
R = <Matrix_integer_dense>self.new_matrix(entries=map(ZZ,A.list()))
```

* Has extra, more direct doctests of `SageArgSpecVisitor`'s methods.

I don't mind leaving the second problem for another day.
