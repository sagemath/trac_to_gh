The attached patch fixes these two failures.

```

An optional test, which currently expoects the same value of e has also been changed.

The patch, which will be attached shortly, also has some notes showing

* A high precision value of e
* The IEEE 754 value
* The correctly rounded result
* The value given on a Sun Blade 1000 with SPARC processors.
