For canonical heights of points on elliptic curves defined over QQ, we call the pari function ellheight(), BUT that function only gives the correct value for global minimal models!  (At primes where the model is not minimal the local component is wrong).

Here is an example to show this:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([-5580472329446114952805505804593498080000,
....:           -157339733785368110382973689903536054787700497223306368000000])
sage: P3=E([204885147732879546487576840131729064308289385547094673627174585676211859152978311600/23625501907057948132262217188983681204856907657753178415430361,92736254270288706000052529616433462503893110244786566575440613880920567197984949809570153263207165494624214991751142500000000/114834283590033957142081201488956527887145361353994063932282392800295014255070987824900081891])
sage: P3.height()
157.086024926474
sage: 4*(P3.height())-(2*P3).height() # should == 0
-1.38629436111989
```
while on the minimal model:

```
sage: Emin = E.minimal_model()
sage: urst = E.isomorphism_to(Emin)
sage: 4*urst(P3).height()-urst(2*P3).height()
0.000000000000000
```

The cure is to compute the minimal model and transfer the point there before computing the height, as illustrated above.  (Of course, pari could do that too, but this behaviour has been tolerated by pari users for many years!)
