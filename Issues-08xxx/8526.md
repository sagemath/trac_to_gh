In a number of emails I get from trac, I see lines like this:

```
Changes (by {'newvalue': u'Fr\xe9d\xe9ric Chapoton', 'oldvalue': ''}):
```

This should be an actual username instead. The problem seems to appear only when non-ASCII characters are involved.

I'm not sure if this is an actual trac bug or if it's something about our configuration. For this ticket, someone should figure that out, and either file a new bug, fix the trac configuration, or file a bug with trac itself (if that's where the issue is).

Comment:

 Here is a git branch with a little bit more documentation for this method.

 I have also taken the opportunity to put raise statement into python3
 format, and to use the trac role to add links to the tickets.
