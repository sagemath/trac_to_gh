Are you sure this is a wise fix? This way, even starting to iterate on the elements of a matrix group involves constructing all its elements. The iterator method on matrix groups previously was the one inherited from `sage.combinat.backtrack.TransitiveIdeal.__iter__`, which seems a little more conservative.

In principle, people can write `iter(SL(next_prime(10^5),2)).next()` to get an example of a determinant 1 matrix. This doesn't need to be expensive (with the current code it is, though. It seems the `semigroup_generators` method is horribly inefficient). With the present patch it's guaranteed to be very expensive.

Iterators and lists have different use cases, so why should G.list() and list(G) give the same result?

It seems to me the correct fix is to amend `TestSuite` to not enforce that iter(G.list()) and iter(G) produce the elements in the same order.
