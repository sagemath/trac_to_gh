```
Since the user is currently very strongly encouraged to use good formatting in #13742, there is no longer a good way to do certain methods which were more designed for words (ex. `robinson_schensted()`)

Before, sage would accept that:

```
sage: Permutation([1,1,1,1,1])
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
sage: Permutation([-12,1,3])
[-12, 1, 3]
```
This ticket is to give an easy way to run RSK on the first one.

More explicitly, this ticket separates out the `RSK` into a global function which takes various types of input and runs the row insertion and also does the same for the inverse.

Hi Nicolas,

If you want your patch to be reviewed please check "needs review"...

For your information your patch breaks posets which use permutations starting from 0:

```
    sage: P = Posets.SymmetricGroupBruhatIntervalPoset([0,1,2,3], [2,3,0,1])
Exception raised:
...
    ValueError: [0, 1, 2, 3] is not a Standard permutations
```

+This ticket is to give an easy way to run RSK on the first one.
 
-This ticket plans to separate out the `RSK` into a global function which takes various types of input and runs the row insertion and also does the same for the inverse. This ticket might also have permutations inherit from `Word`.
+More explicitly, this ticket separates out the `RSK` into a global function which takes various types of input and runs the row insertion and also does the same for the inverse.

Hi,

The name of the ticket has nothing to do with what the ticket contains. You must change either one or the other !

Your changes to Word are not valid. Imagine that I am working on the alphabet of tableaux and I want a word of length two (containing two tableaux)...

Two comments, some others will come later
* sage/combinat/permutation.py, line 2905 you may change the ugly izip(list(range(1, len(self)+1)), self) with izip(xrange(1,len(self)+1), self)

```

[]
sage: Permutation([]).cycle_string()    # OK.
'()'
sage: Permutation('()')    # This should give the S_0 identity back -- but it doesn't.

sage: Permutation('')     # Does this maybe? No.

Travis, why did you replace "standard" by "semi-standard" in ``robinson_schensted``?

Attachment: **[trac_8392-review_patch-dg.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8392/trac_8392-review_patch-dg.patch.gz)**

I've just reviewed the math: [attachment: trac_8392-review_patch-dg.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8392/trac_8392-review_patch-dg.patch.gz).

Documentation extended (please check my formatting!), Edelman-Greene insertion fixed (it used to do the same as normal RSK), an is_increasing() method for tableaux added (since we're already doing Edelman-Greene...), and some more doc fixes made (including the changes that were formerly in #14131).

I have not fixed the issues in my previous comment; I don't know our stance on them.

Hey Darij,

I've folded your review patch in and made some additional tweaks to the docs. I can't believe how badly I coded the EG insertion. I reverted it back to standard since when I first wrote this patch, permutations could take inputs with repetition.

As for your previous comment, that is outside of the scope of this patch since it deals with input for permutations. I think there already is a ticket about this somewhere (or related to it), but I don't remember the number off hand.

Best,

Travis

Travis -

A couple quick comments on the documentation:

In the docstring for sage.combinat.rsk.RSK:

- In the first paragraph "as known as two-line..." should be "also known as two-line..." ?

-In your description of the algorithm p and q are first referenced as your insertion and recording tableaux and then they become P and Q in the next paragraph and in this paragraph p appears to be a generalized permutation.

In the docstring for sage.combinat.rsk.RSK_inverse:

- I think you forgot a colon at the end of the sentence beginning "Same for Edelman-Greene ..."

Haven't played with the functions yet (except for your examples), but plan to soon.

-Jeff

Travis,

Can you add some more checks for invalid input? For example there is no problem doing this:

```
sage: RSK([1],[1,2])  # Words are different length
sage: RSK([2,1],[1,1])  # Not a generalized permutation

```
I am using the definition of generalized permutation in Stanley EC2 Chapter 7.

Thanks for writing this patch. I support the proposed clean up of the code, but I want to raise an objection to choices in the user interface:

- I don't think that it is useful to deprecate the method `robinson_schensted`:

  ```
  DeprecationWarning: p.robinson_schensted() is deprecated. Use instead RSK(p)
  ```

  Telling users to use the RSK function instead of a method is not in the spirit of object-oriented programming. More importantly, it is totally unnecessary to deprecate the method.

- The ability of doing RSK and EG is a great feature, but the documentation isn't very clear. What is `[3,3,2]` mean with EG insertion? Since it isn't a reduced word, how should this be interpreted? It's not invertible either:

```
sage: P, Q = RSK([3,3,2], insertion='EG')
sage: P
[[2, 3], [3]]
sage: Q
[[1, 2], [3]]
sage: RSK_inverse(P, Q, insertion='EG')
word: 232
```

- I would have expected that the output of `RSK` could be used as input to `RSK_inverse`:

```
sage: RSK_inverse(RSK([1,2]))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we wanted to be fully OOP, then there needs to be a class of something like `RSKUsable` which has an abstract method `RSK()` where each type of object implements it's own version of RSK and `RSKUsable` would implement the row-insertion procedure. The problem with this is that we want to be able to handle (pairs of) lists, which we can't modify its class structure and I don't want to have to wrap a list as a word, and I also don't want to clutter up the MRO.

Then what is your proposed interface? If the input is a pair of tableaux as a list or is given as input 2 tableaux, then run the inverse? Hence we should combine two functions which do completely different behavior into one as I think of RSK as a procedure in 1 direction? What about if someone only thinks of this as the Robinson-Schensted bijection and tries `RobinsonSchestead<tab>`? This is why I setup these aliases and imported them.
