```
Since the user is currently very strongly encouraged to use good formatting in #13742, there is no longer a good way to do certain methods which were more designed for words (ex. `robinson_schensted()`)

Before, sage would accept that:

```
sage: Permutation([1,1,1,1,1])
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
sage: Permutation([-12,1,3])
[-12, 1, 3]
```
This ticket is to give an easy way to run RSK on the first one.

More explicitly, this ticket separates out the `RSK` into a global function which takes various types of input and runs the row insertion and also does the same for the inverse.

<a id='comment:1'></a>Hi Nicolas,

If you want your patch to be reviewed please check "needs review"...

For your information your patch breaks posets which use permutations starting from 0:

```
    sage: P = Posets.SymmetricGroupBruhatIntervalPoset([0,1,2,3], [2,3,0,1])
Exception raised:
...
    ValueError: [0, 1, 2, 3] is not a Standard permutations
```

The name of the ticket has nothing to do with what the ticket contains. You must change either one or the other !

Your changes to Word are not valid. Imagine that I am working on the alphabet of tableaux and I want a word of length two (containing two tableaux)...

Two comments, some others will come later
* sage/combinat/permutation.py, line 2905 you may change the ugly izip(list(range(1, len(self)+1)), self) with izip(xrange(1,len(self)+1), self)
* sage/combinat/rsk.py, line 114 "an method" -> "a method"

I've just reviewed the math: [attachment:trac_8392-review_patch-dg.patch].

Documentation extended (please check my formatting!), Edelman-Greene insertion fixed (it used to do the same as normal RSK), an is_increasing() method for tableaux added (since we're already doing Edelman-Greene...), and some more doc fixes made (including the changes that were formerly in #14131).

I have not fixed the issues in my previous comment; I don't know our stance on them.

I've folded your review patch in and made some additional tweaks to the docs. I can't believe how badly I coded the EG insertion. I reverted it back to standard since when I first wrote this patch, permutations could take inputs with repetition.

As for your previous comment, that is outside of the scope of this patch since it deals with input for permutations. I think there already is a ticket about this somewhere (or related to it), but I don't remember the number off hand.

<a id='comment:25'></a>Travis -

A couple quick comments on the documentation:

In the docstring for sage.combinat.rsk.RSK:

- In the first paragraph "as known as two-line..." should be "also known as two-line..." ?

-In your description of the algorithm p and q are first referenced as your insertion and recording tableaux and then they become P and Q in the next paragraph and in this paragraph p appears to be a generalized permutation.

In the docstring for sage.combinat.rsk.RSK_inverse:

- I think you forgot a colon at the end of the sentence beginning "Same for Edelman-Greene ..."

Haven't played with the functions yet (except for your examples), but plan to soon.

Then what is your proposed interface? If the input is a pair of tableaux as a list or is given as input 2 tableaux, then run the inverse? Hence we should combine two functions which do completely different behavior into one as I think of RSK as a procedure in 1 direction? What about if someone only thinks of this as the Robinson-Schensted bijection and tries `RobinsonSchestead<tab>`? This is why I setup these aliases and imported them.

For the full name, probably yes it should be changed. For the shortname `RSK`, it is an acronym, so I think it is better and more likely to be found than `rsk`. See the bottom of [this section of the developers guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html?highlight=camelcase#python-coding-conventions).

> The ability of doing RSK and EG is a great feature, but the documentation isn't very clear. What is [3,3,2] mean with EG insertion? Since it isn't a reduced word, how should this be interpreted?


The documentation could use some expansion.

> I would have expected that the output of RSK could be used as input to RSK_inverse:


This is because it's more logical to me for the input to be 2 arguments where we can explicitly specify what they are (as arguments), than a single parameter taking a list and checking to make sure it has length 2 and explaining the (non-standard IMO) input form in the docsting. We could handle both forms of input, but this seems overly complicated, and I imagine python programmers would simply use the `*` to expand the list as inputs as in the EG examples. This could probably use another example (maybe so far as a docstring explanation, but I'm hesitant about that) that's not for EG insertion.

Best,

Travis

Also, if you want to put all insertion algorithms in one method, it might be better to call it insertion_algorithms rather than RSK since RSK is just one of them and I as a user would not think that Edelman-Greene would be under RSK. Or you should have Edelman-Greene as a different method. Plus the documentation definitely needs more details! At least you need to explain what the input is with the various options.\n\nBest,\n\nAnne",

Another reason why this is better as a function is most of the operation is independent of the type of object being passed in; all it does is it converts it into a pair of lists of the same size. Thus it provides a uniform interface for objects, and the fact that only permutations has such a method conflicts with this, so I think it is worthwhile to deprecate this.


If a user makes a permutation p, it would be natural to try p.<tab completion> to see all methods. Currently p.robinson_schensted() works and it is the most natural entry point. There is no reason to deprecate this method, it can just be a one-line function returning RSK(p).

Couldn't you just use options for the inverse?

Right now it is not clear at all that the input to the Edelman-Greene correspondence are reduced words. Also, if you want to put all insertion algorithms in one method, it might be better to call it insertion_algorithms rather than RSK since RSK is just one of them and I as a user would not think that Edelman-Greene would be under RSK. Or you should have Edelman-Greene as a different method. Plus the documentation definitely needs more details! At least you need to explain what the input is with the various options.
