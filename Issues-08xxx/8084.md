From [this thread in sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/f7961d6de8646b26?tvc=2):

```
when doing in notebook 
sage: show('x^2') 
or 
sage: show(type(factor)) 
I get error Unknown control sequence '\texttt' 
```
There are other problems, too; for example, from the command line (not the notebook), 

```
sage: view(type(factor))
sage: view(identity_matrix)
```
produce odd-looking output -- see the attached pngs.  (The old versions are before the patch, the new ones afterwards.  If you wanted output like the old version of `view(identity_matrix)`, it's probably better to do `browse_sage_doc(identity_matrix)` instead.)

The attached patch should fix these problems.
