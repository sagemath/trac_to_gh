Residue fields and others would like to be able to multiply inherit from finite field parents.  This is the first of the two switches needed to enable that (the other being sage.rings.finite_rings.element_ntl_gf2e.FiniteField_ntl_gf2e).

This depends on #8218.

I applied both patches on top of a 4.3.5 build on 32-bit ubuntu, after previously applying the relevant bundle & patches from #8128.

With the first patch I tested all and found only the one failure mentioned aboue in sage/structures/parent.pyx.  With the second patch this now passes.

Positive review!  Now on to #7880...
