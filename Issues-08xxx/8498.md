Jean Gillibert reported me the following bug. Define

```
E = EllipticCurve('11a1')
K.<t> = NumberField(x^2+47)
EK = E.base_extend(K)
T = EK(5,5)
P = EK(-2, -1/2*t - 1/2)
p = K.ideal(11)
```

Then the following works fine

```
sage: T.has_good_reduction(p)
False
```

but not this one :

```
P.has_good_reduction(p)
```

As you said, the patch fixes the problem for the `has_good_reduction` function, but the same issue may arise else where. Could you open another ticket for the general problem ?
