Right now there are various choices of title format in the categories files: for examples you have "FiniteSemigroups" but
"Finite Weyl Groups". Even worse, files `finite_monoids.py` and `monoids.py` have the same title, namely "Monoids". As a results, in the front page http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/categories.html the link "Monoids" points to `finite_monoids.html` and `monoids.html` is compiled but not linked there. 

I think we should all standardize so that the title of the file is the same as the name of the category with space in it. For example,
file `finite_monoids.py` which defines category `FiniteMonoids()` should have title "Finite Monoids"

+1.

The only issue is for how to do handle it while minimizing the conflicts with other patches.
