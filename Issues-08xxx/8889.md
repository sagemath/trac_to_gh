I would like a function that takes
Input: range (a list)
       dim (a positive integer)
Output: a list of vectors or tuples of length dim including all combinations of range, but with replacement

Example: generate the vertices of the centered unit cube [-1/2,1/2]^dim, where dim is variable

The functions in sage.misc.mrange almost do this, except it seems that they require having dim specified ahead of time, whereas I want a function that I can call in another function where dim will vary.

The function Arrangements in sage.combinat.permutation almost does what I want, but the list that the digits of the tuple are chosen from must be larger than dim, and Arrangements selects without replacement.  I can solve my example problem using Arrangements as follows:

```
prelist=[]
for i in range(2**d):
    if i-2**(d-1) >= 0: prelist.append(1)
        else: prelist.append(-1)
list = (1/2)*matrix(Arrangements(prelist,d).list())
```
but it seems like there should be one specific function for this.

(Combinations and Permutations are also related, but don't quite do what I want.)

Does this do what you want?

```
sage: l = [1/2, -1/2]
sage: CartesianProduct(*([l]*3)).list()
[[1/2, 1/2, 1/2], [1/2, 1/2, -1/2], [1/2, -1/2, 1/2], [1/2, -1/2, -1/2], [-1/2, 1/2, 1/2], [-1/2, 1/2, -1/2], [-1/2, -1/2, 1/2], [-1/2, -1/2, -1/2]]

It would be really nice if CartesianProduct supported a repeat keyword, like the python itertools product function does:

```

sage: import itertools                      
sage: list(itertools.product([1/2,-1/2],repeat=3))
[(1/2, 1/2, 1/2), (1/2, 1/2, -1/2), (1/2, -1/2, 1/2), (1/2, -1/2, -1/2), (-1/2, 1/2, 1/2), (-1/2, 1/2, -1/2), (-1/2, -1/2, 1/2), (-1/2, -1/2, -1/2)]
```

That would make a common case (cartesian product of a set with itself) much easier to read.

Wait!  Are you closing it because no one has reviewed it?  If so, I'll review it.  I've been wanting the repeat keyword for a long time, as it just feels like a big mess when I want to take the cartesian product of a set with itself a number of times.  It's much easier with the repeat keyword, especially since python supports that in the python equivalent.
