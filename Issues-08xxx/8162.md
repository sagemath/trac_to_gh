According to the documentation for Zq, the following code should construct the degree 3 unramified extension of the 5-adic integers, but fails.

```

I guess one should apply 8162.2.patch.

Even though I read the comment above I don't understand under which circumstances one would get a list of the form [(p,n)]. If you factor some q you get a factorization object. If you select one of its coefficients you get a tuple. The only way I could think of is casting a factorization to a list but would this really be useful?

I also find the use of 'check' confusing. One would expect 'check' to actually check whether q is a prime power (which probably the ExtensionFactory does, I haven't checked). Here it is also used to disable some of the input formats:

```
sage: k.<alpha> = Qq((2,1)) #works
sage: k.<alpha> = Qq((2,1),check=False)
TypeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object does not support indexing
```

So, something that works with check does not work without check anymore.

I can go ahead and fix these issues if you don't mind.

Yeah, that was a typo: apply only 8162.2.patch.

I can't think of a good reason to allow a list, but also no particular reason not to allow it, since lists are a common container for objects in Python.  :-)

As for the check parameter, my interpretation of check=False is that it only accepts input of a particular format in order to minimize the time spent in handling different input formats.  So I think it's completely reasonable for your example to fail when you don't pass in something of the form [(p, k)].

So I guess my conclusion is that I don't think the issues you're pointing out are problems.

Replying to [@roed314](#comment%3A7):

Sure, this makes sense.

> As for the check parameter, my interpretation of check=False is that it only accepts input of a particular format in order to minimize the time spent in handling different input formats.  So I think it's completely reasonable for your example to fail when you don't pass in something of the form [(p, k)].

I mostly agree with you. I think that with `check=False` nothing should be done that could be expensive (things like checking whether a minimal polynomial is actually irreducible). However, I believe that `check` should not have an influence on the interface.

I adapted your patch to only make the check trigger whether we check that `p` is actually a prime. All the other checks are just `isinstance` and `len` checks which come essentially for free.

I looked at some timings and the two versions don't really seem to differ with `q=(p,k)` and `check=False`.

Would this patch be acceptable for you?
