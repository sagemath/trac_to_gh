BipartiteGraph needs to override add_vertex() and add_vertices() to properly partition the vertices.

```
sage: bg = BipartiteGraph()
sage: bg.add_vertex('a')  # this vertex should go left or right
sage: (bg.left, bg.right)  # one of these should contain vertex 'a'
([], [])
```

How about this solution:

1(a).  To properly add a vertex to a BipartiteGraph object, specify keyword left or right as True.

```
sage: bg = BipartiteGraph()
sage: bg.add_vertex('a', left=True)  # new syntax
sage: bg.left
['a']
```

1(b).  add_vertices() can use a list for left or right (default right to None).  We could also allow left/right to be a single boolean and apply that to every element in the list.

```
sage: bg = BipartiteGraph()
sage: bg.add_vertices(['a', 'b', 'c'], left=[True, False, True])
```

2.  With no specific instruction, add_vertex will convert the current BipartiteGraph back to a Graph.  (Is this allowed/possible?)

```
sage: g = BipartiteGraph()
sage: g.add_vertex('a')  # no left/right specified, so revert to a Graph
sage: g
Graph on 1 vertex
sage: type(g)
<class 'sage.graphs.graph.Graph'>
```

rhinton: you bring up a very good point about the organization of the graph classes.

The main point behind the bipartite graph class is that it is represented more efficiently than the normal graphs are, right?  That's a storage layer question, which seems like it should be a lower-level thing than the algorithm layer.  Maybe in the long run, it would be better to create a backend for bipartite graphs (like the cgraph backend, or the networkx backend).

Since algorithms should only call functions that are in the public interface of the backend, algorithms should just work.  We might have to augment the public interface between backends and the graph theory code to handle the extra arguments (like in add_vertex) for different backends, though.
