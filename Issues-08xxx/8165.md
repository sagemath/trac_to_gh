I just tried uploading the following worksheet:

http://sagenb.org/home/pub/1139/

by pasting the URL into the middle box of the upload page on a (fairly fresh) 4.3.1 install.  When I opened up the worksheet on the local server, the title was cut off to be about 14 characters long.  This is a bug.

```

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

The problem is the use of [str.rstrip](http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#str.rstrip) in `twist.Worksheet_download`:

```python
sage: '112 - 01 - Review.sws'.rstrip('.sws')
'112 - 01 - Revie'
```
The patch uses `str.endswith` and a slice, instead.

I've reproduced the problem on 4.3.1, then applied the patch on top of sagenb-0.7.4.spkg and the title survives properly when saved to an sws file and subsequently loaded into a notebook.

Positive review.
