In hg.py, strings like `ssh://[user@]host[:port]/[path]` appear in docstrings, and Sphinx turns them into active links in the html documentation (which are obviously broken), and Sphinx produces warnings when producing the latex/pdf documentation:

```
.../devel/sage/doc/en/reference/sage/misc/hg.rst:: WARNING: unusable reference target found: ssh://[user@]host[:port]/[path
```
This patch puts these links into double backquotes, fixing both of these issues.
