Provides autodetect dependent and independent variables in desolve(), desolve_laplace()

Additionally as module which helps to solve first problem provides unified interface for standard python types and sage specific types.
Treats everything as symbolic expression which allows to check its type, take
operator and operands and extract subexpressions by given types.

I absolutely agree with you. It is much better to have class hierarchy or at least some common interface which can help to define type. And wraps or mixins should be used for Python types.

I made sketch to solve some simple de problems I write some common functions in mtype, which can be easily rewritten to extract only diff operators. So just use it if you want to.

I finished with sage for this year, now I need to do smth real. I'm sorry I can't afford to spend some more time to finish this improvements.
