Somehow we don't recognize the conjugate function in the string we get back from maxima, and create a new one. The last line above is the default latex typesetting for symbolic functions.

This patch does not apply to 4.7.1.alpha1 because of a blank line someone must have removed earlier.  Unfortunately, I can't figure out how to fix the patch easily (so that Burcin remains the author of the patch), so it will have to be rebased.  Hopefully that won't be too much trouble :(

This also exposes a different problem - that our variables are assumed to be real.  This is known elsewhere.

```
sage: latex(x.conjugate())
\overline{x}
sage: latex(x.conjugate().simplify())
x
```

Not sure if that needs to be addressed on this ticket, though.

I uploaded a rebased patch with the same name.

If you `qimport` a patch which already has mercurial headers, make changes, then `qrefresh` and `export`, the author shouldn't change. In this case, it wouldn't matter even if you changed it. :)

That is #6882, well beyond the scope of this ticket.

Okay, thanks - and thanks for the tip, in the last few months I've finally started using queues.

I already tried several things yesterday, so all is well.  Positive review.

Incidentally, this has been fixed for a *while*:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.4.4, Release Date: 2010-06-23                       |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Loading Sage library. Current Mercurial branch is: hackbranch
sage: assume(x,'complex')
sage: latex(x.conjugate().simplify())
\overline{x}
sage: 
```
