# Issue 8363: cddlib-094f.p4 has a useless check for mpir which breaks on Solaris

spkg/install/deps shows that cddlib depends on mpir

```
$(INST)/$(CDDLIB): $(BASE) $(INST)/$(MPIR)
        $(SAGE_SPKG) $(CDDLIB) 2>&1
```

but for some reason someone has added a check in cddlib's spkg-install. This seems a bit pointless, but is causing a breakage on Solaris

```
# We depend on mpir, make sure it is installed (GMP fork)
MPIR_VERSION=`cd $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/; ./newest_version mpir`
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Failed to find mpir.  Please install the mpir spkg"
    exit 1
fi
```

They do not even export MPIR_VERSION, so it is a useless bit of code that is breaking on Solaris. 

Also, currently cddlib will not build on 64-bit Solaris, due to the normal check that the platform is OS X: 

```
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" ] && [ "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
   echo "64 bit MacIntel"
   CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -m64 "; export CFLAGS
fi
```

Both these issues are easily resolved. A patch and updated .spkg will follow shortly.

Thinking about this ticket, it does fix what the title says it does. In other words, it removes the useless but broken check for mpir. 

I don't believe the removal of the OS X restriction for a 64-bit build can do any harm and its failure to work probably has more to do with the multiple inclusion of libraries. 

As such, I believe this should get a positive review. 

The fact it does not build on OpenSolaris is another issue.

Thank you Minh. I don't know what I was thinking when I attached the package to the trac ticket. Perhaps I thought it was so small - not sure. Anyway, I will not do it again. 

Thank you for the positive review. 

I've opened another ticket, #8419, to resolve the issue which Jaap found - i.e. cddlib is not building as 64-bit on OpenSolaris.
