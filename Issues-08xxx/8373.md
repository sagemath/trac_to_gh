Replying to [ticket:8373 rkirov]:

In your example, `a` *is* a generator; it's an *algebra generator*.  In fact `a` generates `K` in exactly the same sense in which `x` generates `R`.  What you're looking for is:

```
sage: R.<x> = GF(2)[]
sage: K.<a> = GF(16, modulus=x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)
sage: K.multiplicative_generator()
a + 1
```
It would be a mistake to insist on having a primitive generator.  Of your options: 

(1) could slow Sage down unnecessarily, and what should it do if a user wanted to use a non-primitive generator?

(2) yes, if the documentation is confusing, it should be clarified.

(3) I don't quite understand.  If you mean ignore a given modulus if  it is not primitive, that would be very confusing.

What *is* needed, for non-prime fields of large characteristic, is a much better way of finding a multiplicative generator:

```
sage: p = 65537
sage: K.<a> = GF(p^2)
sage: a.multiplicative_order() == p^2 - 1
False
sage: time K.multiplicative_generator()
CPU times: user 498.03 s, sys: 56.61 s, total: 554.64 s
Wall time: 555.20 s
a + 3
```
What's taking the time here is that the current algorithm, after deciding that `a` isn't a multiplicative generator,  pointlessly computes the multiplicative order of all the non-zero elements in the prime field, before trying `a` (again), `a + 1`, `a + 2`, and succeeding with `a + 3`.

I checked that Magma has similar behavior.

```

```
It also seems to have different algorithm for primitive element,

```

z^3 + z + 1
```

In any case I am leaving this open so someone can work on the bug you found.

This already exists in `PolynomialRing_dense_mod_p.irreducible_element()` under the name `modulus="adleman-lenstra"`.  It is the default if no Conway polynomial is known and the characteristic is odd.

Some finite field implementations accept a string `modulus`, but this should be obsolete; `FiniteFieldFactory.create_key_and_extra_args()` uses the above method to convert a string `modulus` into an actual polynomial.

Why should it be obsolete? I think the syntax

```
k.<a> = GF(p^n, modulus="primitive")
```
is very good to have. Note that the actual modulus polynomial is computed before the implementation is even considered. So it's not that every finite field implementation needs to be aware of this.

Yes, it is certainly not this syntax that needs to be made obsolete!
> Note that the actual modulus polynomial is computed before the implementation is even considered. So it's not that every finite field implementation needs to be aware of this.

That is what I meant; the individual implementation should never need to consider the case where `modulus` is a string, it should all be handled by the factory.
