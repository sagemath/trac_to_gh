```
When I run doctests on the file ell_rational_field.py, I end up with a
small file called PRIMES in the current directory. This shouldn't
happen: running doctests shouldn't produce files in a non-temporary
directory.

This is a follow-up to #7575.  Please see [comment:ticket:7575:24 comment 24+] for some progress.

A new spkg is available at

The quickest quick fix would be just to comment out line 372 in src/procs/marith.cc (in eclib).

Anything else requires thought and testing, which I don't have time for i nthe next several days.

I think the problem is that make sometimes attempts to build a target in `progs` before it's done building a requisite shared library, e.g., `install_so`.  I've updated the "makefiles" patch and spkg with a fix that I'm testing now.

It seems to work and it survives a stress test on sage.math, e.g.,

```sh
export MAKE="make -j20"  # And NTL_PREFIX, etc.
make veryclean && make && make so && make veryclean && make && make so && [lots of reps] && ls
```

It's another temp file which gets left behind, this time after "make check".

If that's too much hassle I'll do it next time I make changes to the eclib spkg, but it would be convenient to do it now.

I noticed a different problem with `make check` on t2:

```
make[3]: Entering directory `/scratch/mpatel/sage-4.3.0.1/spkg/build/eclib-20080310.p10/src/g0n'
rm -f PRIMES t

./homtest < homtest.in > t && diff t homtest.out
./hecketest < hecketest.in > t 2>/dev/null && diff t hecketest.out 
./mhcount < mhcount.in > t && diff t  mhcount.out
rm -rf tmp_nf_dir
mkdir tmp_nf_dir
export NF_DIR=tmp_nf_dir && ./tmanin < tmanin.in > t 2>/dev/null && diff t tmanin.out
/bin/sh: NF_DIR=tmp_nf_dir: is not an identifier
make[3]: *** [check] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/scratch/mpatel/sage-4.3.0.1/spkg/build/eclib-20080310.p10/src/g0n'

I think we can fix this with, e.g.,

```sh
env NF_DIR=tmp_nf_dir ./tmanin < tmanin.in > t 2>/dev/null && diff t tmanin.out
```

I tested the current version of the spkg.  (This does nto have the suggested changes to the handling of NF_DIR).  All was well.

I did not make new changes (for the NF_DIR thing) since I thought that would be too confusing.  But I'll be happy to check the next version of p10 in due course.

There is a  simpler solution to the problem with "export NF_DIR".  The code uses a default directory name for this, namely "newforms",  which can be over-ridden by the use of the environment variable NF_DIR.  For this test therefore we can replace the 2 lines "rm -rf tmp_nf_dir" by "rm -rf newforms" (strictly only the second one is needed) and remove all the starts of lines of the form "export NF_DIR=tmp_nf_dir && ".
(This is in src/g0n/Makefile).

Here's why I did not do this in the first place: by own private copy of this code has a newforms directory which contains 3.4G of data which took many many processor-years to compute.  I do not want a simple "make check" to delete that so I put in this temporary (and non-default) tmp_nf_dir thing instead.  But for the Sage distribution that is not needed.

I can attach a replacement Makefile here if that would be convenient, for yet another version of p10.
