```
When I run doctests on the file ell_rational_field.py, I end up with a
small file called PRIMES in the current directory. This shouldn't
happen: running doctests shouldn't produce files in a non-temporary
directory.

```

This is a follow-up to #7575.  Please see [comment:ticket:7575:24 comment 24+] for some progress.

A new spkg is available at

* http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/8357/eclib-20080310.p10.spkg

It includes the `PRIMES`, `1`, and `make check` fixes mentioned below and parallel build fixes (cf. #8306). 

**Note to release manager:** Merge only the spkg.

The quickest quick fix would be just to comment out line 372 in src/procs/marith.cc (in eclib).

Anything else requires thought and testing, which I don't have time for i nthe next several days.

It seems to work and it survives a stress test on sage.math, e.g.,

```sh
export MAKE="make -j20"  # And NTL_PREFIX, etc.
make veryclean && make && make so && make veryclean && make && make so && [lots of reps] && ls
```

It's another temp file which gets left behind, this time after "make check".

If that's too much hassle I'll do it next time I make changes to the eclib spkg, but it would be convenient to do it now.

I noticed a different problem with `make check` on t2:

```
make[3]: Entering directory `/scratch/mpatel/sage-4.3.0.1/spkg/build/eclib-20080310.p10/src/g0n'

./hecketest < hecketest.in > t 2>/dev/null && diff t hecketest.out 
./mhcount < mhcount.in > t && diff t  mhcount.out
rm -rf tmp_nf_dir
mkdir tmp_nf_dir
export NF_DIR=tmp_nf_dir && ./tmanin < tmanin.in > t 2>/dev/null && diff t tmanin.out
/bin/sh: NF_DIR=tmp_nf_dir: is not an identifier

make[3]: Leaving directory `/scratch/mpatel/sage-4.3.0.1/spkg/build/eclib-20080310.p10/src/g0n'

I think we can fix this with, e.g.,

```sh
env NF_DIR=tmp_nf_dir ./tmanin < tmanin.in > t 2>/dev/null && diff t tmanin.out
```

I tested the current version of the spkg.  (This does nto have the suggested changes to the handling of NF_DIR).  All was well.

I did not make new changes (for the NF_DIR thing) since I thought that would be too confusing.  But I'll be happy to check the next version of p10 in due course.
