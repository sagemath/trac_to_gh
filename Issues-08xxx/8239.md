```
This is kind of misleading:

```
sage: K.<a> = Qq(25)
sage: K.teichmuller(K(2/5))
2*5^-1 + 1 + 2*5 + 5^2 + 3*5^3 + 4*5^4 + 2*5^5 + 3*5^6 + 3*5^8 + 2*5^9 + 2*5^10 + 4*5^12 + 5^13 + 3*5^14 + 2*5^15 + 4*5^16 + 4*5^18 + O(5^19)
```

It should raise an exception.

The prime case behaves as I would expect:

```
sage: K = Qp(5)
sage: K.teichmuller(K(2/5))
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
ValueError: cannot set negative valuation element to Teichmuller
representative.
```
