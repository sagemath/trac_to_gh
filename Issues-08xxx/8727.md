This, on top of the patches 0.8 (#8725) includes, has the ff.:

#693, #7665, #7997, #7633, #7418

All of these have not yet been reviewed, and thus inclusion relegated to this package version.

There is a sage main library patch at #7665 that must be applied when this package is included.

The package can be found at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/timdumol/sagenb-0.8.1.spkg
