This patch adds a new implementation for construction of Christoffel words using continued fraction :

```
sage: %timeit words.ChristoffelWord(5, 9, algorithm='linear')
625 loops, best of 3: 67.7 µs per loop
sage: %timeit words.ChristoffelWord(5, 9, algorithm='cf')
625 loops, best of 3: 309 µs per loop
```

For large words, it is much faster than the actual implementation.

```
sage: %timeit words.ChristoffelWord(500, 90001, algorithm='linear')
5 loops, best of 3: 111 ms per loop
sage: %timeit words.ChristoffelWord(500, 90001, algorithm='cf')
125 loops, best of 3: 4 ms per loop
```

I tested the improved function. It is indeed much faster, especially when the two prime numbers are big. The code makes sense, all tests passed, and I tried also other values with very big prime numbers: no problem. The doc builds fine too.

I made very minor changes (typos, punctuation, etc.). Positive review.
