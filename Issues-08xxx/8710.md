This patch massages the doctests that were causing failures for 4.4.alpha0 on the Skynet machine, sextus.  Its not pretty, but I hope the results are now hardware-neutral.

Alex - you reviewed the original ticket (#4756), so maybe this would be an easy review for you?

John - I don't know if it is easy for you to test this on sextus in advance of merging it?  Sounds like it will be a while before I have that kind of access.

1. John will have to test, since he has the build on sextus. 

2. The doctests actually look much nicer normalized to have first entry 1! 

(I would give this a positive review if this works.)

The output looks nicer because this matrix is out of my textbook and was *designed* to have nice-looking answers.  I don't like the hard-to-decipher code that gets you there, but that's the way it goes.  Thanks for having a look and for the advice on getting this squared away.

Tests pass on sextus.  I'll test it on a few more machines, and if it works, I'll give it a positive review and merge it into 4.4.alpha1.

Hi John,

Did this eventually past muster on skynet, or does it need more testing?

I still haven't done the `SciPy` tests I'd like to do skynet yet, but hope to get to that soon.
