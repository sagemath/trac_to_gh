1. Below "ring" should be "modular symbols space":

```
 	117	    def change_ring(self, R): 
 	118	        r""" 
 	119	        Return this ring with the base ring changed to the ring R. 
```

2. Here I think the sentence should end with ::

```
 	419	    A more complicated example involving both a nontrivial character, and a 
 	420	    base field that is not minimal for that character: 
```


It's really awesome that you sphinxified a bunch of docs, in addition to fixing the bug in this ticket.
