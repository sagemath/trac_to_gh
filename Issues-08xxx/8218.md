Has this been checked on Solaris? The patches are huge, so there is a good chance this will break on one platform or another. 

There's general information about building on Solaris at

http://wiki.sagemath.org/solaris

Information specifically for 't2' at

http://wiki.sagemath.org/devel/Building-Sage-on-the-T5240-t2

Both the source (4.3.0.1 is the latest to build on Solaris) and a binary
which will run on any SPARC can be found at http://www.sagemath.org/download-source.html

You may need to clear out old files in the $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-8218/build directory.

Sorry about this.  I made a new clone of 4.3.4.alpha1 and followed the instructions to the letter, but the final qpush gave this:

```

It might be better if someone who had any idea what they were doing took over this review -- I am clearly not competent!  For a start, if I depart in the slightest way from the list of commands then it does not work at all, but I don't understand why.

Meanwhile I'll keep this clone in case sending any of the files will help (but despite the message here, there is nothing left in the "working directory").

There are not two different forks of the code base.  There are no Mercurial branches. 

Be aware, given 4.3.4.alpha1 builds on Solaris, and passes all the doc tests, so I suspect if this breaks the build it will not be merged.

David,

Can you list here exactly what needs to be applied (and how)?  I want to start looking at the derivative patches for finite fields, so I have to get a clone with this one installed first -- and as you can see from earlier comments, I have not had much success so far.

Hi John,

First apply the bundle trac_8218_move_433.bundle, using the commands:

```
hg unbundle https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8218/trac_8218_move_433.bundle.gz
hg merge
hg ci -m "merged finite field bundle"
```
Then use queues in the normal way to import the patches `trac_8218_fixes_434alpha1.patch` and `trac_8218_doc.patch` (in that order). This does work on 4.3.5, I just checked.

But the ball is in David Roe's court as far as the finite field patches are concerned. The sequence is #8218 --> #8332 -> #7880 -> #7883 -> #8333 -> #8334 -> #8335. So far

- #8218 has a positive review
- #7880 has a positive review
- #7883 has been looked at by both me and Rob Bradshaw and we both agree that it needs more work.

Further downstream, #8333 builds independently of #7883, but many things in #8333 are horribly broken unless you also apply #8334, which does *not* build independently of #7883.

David

Thanks!  I saw that some of the later patches had had positive reviews too, so maybe it's a bit late for me to join in.  But I thought that for a complicated interrelated set of patches like this, which non-trivial mathematical content, it would be good to have a small set of people looking at it rather than individuals.

Is this fixed later in the series?  If not, it should be fixed here.  So I am putting this back to "needs work".
