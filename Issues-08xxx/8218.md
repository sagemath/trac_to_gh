I created the bundle with 

```
sage -hg bundle -r 13801 --base 13800 ~/patches-out/trac_8218_move.bundle
```
I believe this is right, but it's been a while since I used bundles.

Has this been checked on Solaris? The patches are huge, so there is a good chance this will break on one platform or another. 

There's general information about building on Solaris at

http://wiki.sagemath.org/solaris

Information specifically for 't2' at

http://wiki.sagemath.org/devel/Building-Sage-on-the-T5240-t2

Both the source (4.3.0.1 is the latest to build on Solaris) and a binary
which will run on any SPARC can be found at http://www.sagemath.org/download-source.html

If you could post the exact sequence of commands needs to go from a fresh 4.3.3, starting with (say) sage -clone 8218  and ending with sage -br (or similar), then I'll willingly test it.

There are not two different forks of the code base.  There are no Mercurial branches. 

Be aware, given 4.3.4.alpha1 builds on Solaris, and passes all the doc tests, so I suspect if this breaks the build it will not be merged.

That's a totally different story then. Somehow I had got the incorrect impression that 4.3.0.1 was the latest Solaris version. I will run some tests on T2 and see what happens.

Ah! That's a totally different story then. Somehow I had got the incorrect impression that 4.3.0.1 was the latest Solaris version. I will run some tests on T2 and see what happens. Perhaps I had better do the same for the other tickets I have reviewed lately. My apologies!

David,

Can you list here exactly what needs to be applied (and how)?  I want to start looking at the derivative patches for finite fields, so I have to get a clone with this one installed first -- and as you can see from earlier comments, I have not had much success so far.

Hi John,

First apply the bundle trac_8218_move_433.bundle, using the commands:

```
hg unbundle http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/8218/trac_8218_move_433.bundle
hg merge
hg ci -m "merged finite field bundle"
```
Then use queues in the normal way to import the patches `trac_8218_fixes_434alpha1.patch` and `trac_8218_doc.patch` (in that order). This does work on 4.3.5, I just checked.

But the ball is in David Roe's court as far as the finite field patches are concerned. The sequence is #8218 --> #8332 -> #7880 -> #7883 -> #8333 -> #8334 -> #8335. So far

- #8218 has a positive review
- #7880 has a positive review
- #7883 has been looked at by both me and Rob Bradshaw and we both agree that it needs more work.

Further downstream, #8333 builds independently of #7883, but many things in #8333 are horribly broken unless you also apply #8334, which does *not* build independently of #7883.

David
