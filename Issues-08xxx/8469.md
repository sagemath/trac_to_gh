Two comments: 
* In this tutorial, euler_phi(n) is called several times. The whole security of RSA lies in the fact that euler_phi takes a long time if you don't know the factorization. I'd suggest using a variable:

```
phi = (p-1)*(q-1)
```

When I've taught about RSA, I've used big primes:

```
p = next_prime(randint(10^100,10^101))
q = next_prime(randint(10^100,10^101))
```

and euler_phi would take for ever, of course. If this is reasonable to you, I'll be glad to write a patch, of course.

* A missing space was generating a minor problem with latex. I attach a patch only for that, waiting for your opinions on the first item.

That would be nice. Thank you.

Your patch looks OK to me.



Also, could you put your real name in the "Reviewer(s):" field? That way, it makes it easier to credit you for your contribution.

When applying the previous version of my patch on top of Sage 4.5.2.rc0, I got the following failure:

```sh
[mvngu@sage sage-main]$ hg qimport http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/8469/trac_8469-rsa.patch && hg qpush

```
I have rebased my patch against Sage 4.5.2.rc0 in order to resolve the above failure.



The content of pang's patch [attachment:trac_8469_review_final.patch] is mostly OK, but the way the patch itself is structured is frowned upon. From the way it looks, I guess that the patch was put together by concatenating many patches together into one file. That's not how you should put patches together. Use Mercurial queue to concatenate patches into one patch. I have done this and uploaded an updated version of pang's patch, which also fixes some typos found in his original patch. For reference, here are the fixed typos:

Pang's updated patch and the typo fixes are all rolled into one patch. See the ticket description for instructions on applying the relevant patches.



For ticket to be closed, the following must happen:

1. Someone needs to sign off on [attachment:trac_8469-rsa.patch]. This is my patch, so it requires a reviewer other than myself.
2. Someone needs to sign off on [attachment:trac_8469-review-rebased.patch]. This is pang's original patch together with some typo fixes by me. I'm happy with pang's content. But someone other than myself needs to go over the fixes I included in this updated patch.

Forgot to post the rebased patch.  That is fixed.

"rebase" patch:  removes RSA bibliography file from top-level.  Reviewer should check that there is no "bibliography.html" at the same level as the four or five other tutorial files.  Still fixes rebasing problem.

"bibliography" patch:  moves RSA bibliography to the end of the actual tutorial file.  Removed duplicate citation from the Lie group bibliography file.
