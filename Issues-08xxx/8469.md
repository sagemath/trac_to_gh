<a id='comment:5'></a>Two comments: 
* In this tutorial, euler_phi(n) is called several times. The whole security of RSA lies in the fact that euler_phi takes a long time if you don't know the factorization. I'd suggest using a variable:

```
phi = (p-1)*(q-1)
```

When I've taught about RSA, I've used big primes:

```
p = next_prime(randint(10^100,10^101))
q = next_prime(randint(10^100,10^101))
```

and euler_phi would take for ever, of course. If this is reasonable to you, I'll be glad to write a patch, of course.

* A missing space was generating a minor problem with latex. I attach a patch only for that, waiting for your opinions on the first item.

Your patch looks OK to me.



Also, could you put your real name in the "Reviewer(s):" field? That way, it makes it easier to credit you for your contribution.

```
Pang's updated patch and the typo fixes are all rolled into one patch. See the ticket description for instructions on applying the relevant patches.



For ticket to be closed, the following must happen:

1. Someone needs to sign off on [attachment:trac_8469-rsa.patch]. This is my patch, so it requires a reviewer other than myself.
2. Someone needs to sign off on [attachment:trac_8469-review-rebased.patch]. This is pang's original patch together with some typo fixes by me. I'm happy with pang's content. But someone other than myself needs to go over the fixes I included in this updated patch.
