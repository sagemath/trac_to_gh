Two comments: 
* In this tutorial, euler_phi(n) is called several times. The whole security of RSA lies in the fact that euler_phi takes a long time if you don't know the factorization. I'd suggest using a variable:

```
phi = (p-1)*(q-1)
```

When I've taught about RSA, I've used big primes:

```
p = next_prime(randint(10^100,10^101))
q = next_prime(randint(10^100,10^101))
```

and euler_phi would take for ever, of course. If this is reasonable to you, I'll be glad to write a patch, of course.

* A missing space was generating a minor problem with latex. I attach a patch only for that, waiting for your opinions on the first item.

Your patch looks OK to me.



Also, could you put your real name in the "Reviewer(s):" field? That way, it makes it easier to credit you for your contribution.

I have rebased my patch against Sage 4.5.2.rc0 in order to resolve the above failure.



The content of pang's patch [attachment:trac_8469_review_final.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8469/trac_8469_review_final.patch) is mostly OK, but the way the patch itself is structured is frowned upon. From the way it looks, I guess that the patch was put together by concatenating many patches together into one file. That's not how you should put patches together. Use Mercurial queue to concatenate patches into one patch. I have done this and uploaded an updated version of pang's patch, which also fixes some typos found in his original patch. For reference, here are the fixed typos:

Pang's updated patch and the typo fixes are all rolled into one patch. See the ticket description for instructions on applying the relevant patches.



For ticket to be closed, the following must happen:

1. Someone needs to sign off on [attachment:trac_8469-rsa.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8469/trac_8469-rsa.patch). This is my patch, so it requires a reviewer other than myself.
2. Someone needs to sign off on [attachment:trac_8469-review-rebased.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8469/trac_8469-review-rebased.patch). This is pang's original patch together with some typo fixes by me. I'm happy with pang's content. But someone other than myself needs to go over the fixes I included in this updated patch.

This all looks very good.  I have posted a rebase of the main patch, it was just a matter of getting the table of contents aligned with new additions.

The "Menezes" citation appears twice, it seems to be in the bibliography for the Lie group stuff, so that needs to be removed.

The RSA bibliography appears as a section of its own at the same level as the different topics.  Maybe it should just be added directly into the new file of RSA material at the end?  (In other words, not in its own file that is included at a level I think is one too high.)
