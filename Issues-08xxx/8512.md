sage: An error occurred while installing database_stein_watkins_mini

```

 == The solution ==
This is because 'cp' uses an illegal option -v, which is not defined by POSIX. 

http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/cp.html

Since the GNU version of 'cp' only uses the -v option to show what is being done, it is not important. Consulting rom the 'cp' man page on Linux:

```
       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done
```

The -v option can simply be removed.

<a id='comment:1'></a>The solution to this GNUism was very easy - just remove the -v option.

I also added a **very incomplete** SPKG.txt file - previously there was no file called SPKG.txt. I leave it up to William or others with more knowledge to fill this in. It does at least document the change I made. 

The database can be found at http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/optional/database_stein_watkins_mini.p0/database_stein_watkins_mini.p0.spkg

Attached are a diff of the spkg-install and the new SPKG.txt

 == Note to the release manager. == 

There is no Mercurial repository - I this will have to be integrated manually.
