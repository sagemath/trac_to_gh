When building the reference manual, I get these warnings (among others):

```
.../devel/sage/doc/en/reference/sage/misc/attach.rst:: WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree
.../devel/sage/doc/en/reference/sage/geometry/polytope.rst:: WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree
```
The fix is easy: delete (by hand) the files `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/sage/misc/attach.rst` and `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/sage/geometry/polytope.rst`.  (These files are not under revision control, so can't be removed by a patch.)

(polytope.rst was removed from the reference manual in #7109.  I'm not sure what happened to attach.rst: #7514, maybe?)

Yes, it looks like polytope.rst was removed from the reference manual in #7109.  Let's delete that file, too; I'll change the description of this ticket to reflect this.

There are no patches to merge, so I "merged" as follows:

* `rm -rf SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main/doc/en/reference/sage`

For Sage 4.3.2.alpha1, originally the number of warnings for building the reference manual was 157. After following the above deletion step, the total number of warnings dropped down to 155.

**Correction:** I only removed the file `polytope.rst`:

* `rm SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main/doc/en/reference/sage/geometry/polytope.rst`
