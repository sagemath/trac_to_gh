I think this should work:

```
sage: CRT(Mod(3,19), Mod(5, 13))
...
ValueError: arguments a and b must be coprime
```

This fix is to check the gcd precondition more carefully.

<a id='comment:5'></a>
I have tried 

```
sage: CRT(Mod(3,19), Mod(5, 13))
```

The error is because of the return type of Mod is sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_int, not integer which is desire. 

if you try this

```
sage: CRT(int(Mod(3,19)), int(Mod(5, 13)))
```
it's working, is my suggestion right? or am I missing something.

I used Sage version 8.1, which was released on 2017-12-07.

Thanks,\\
Harsh
