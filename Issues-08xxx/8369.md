The sentence: "Or enter the url of a worksheet file on the web:" at "Upload or Create Data File to attach to worksheet "image histogram"" in the notebook is wrong.  It should be: "Or enter the url of a file on the web:".  This is the page you get by clicking Data --> Upload from a worksheet.  

This is a really easy bug to fix.
