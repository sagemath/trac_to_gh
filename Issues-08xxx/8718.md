<a id='comment:2'></a>One suggestion---the names of the new functions do not seem to indicate to me that they only operate on the nonzero coefficients, so it would be hard for me to remember what the difference between map_coefficients and apply_map is.

How about just adding an argument to apply_map:

p.apply_map(nonzero_only=True)

or something like that?
