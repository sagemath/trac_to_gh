The attached patch adds naive implementations of apply_map() and of a second similar method, map_coefficients(), modeled after that of multivariate polynomials.

Note that I have as good as no experience with Python or Sage developmentâ€”so sorry for any newbie errors... and please review carefully! :-)

One suggestion---the names of the new functions do not seem to indicate to me that they only operate on the nonzero coefficients, so it would be hard for me to remember what the difference between map_coefficients and apply_map is.

How about just adding an argument to apply_map:

p.apply_map(nonzero_only=True)

or something like that?

I agree that mapping 0 to non-zero should not be a part of map_coefficients().

I rewrote the patch to only contain map_coefficients() for polynomial elements.

Was there any reason for distinguishing between polynomial_element and polynomial_element_generic? I removed the distinction and it turned out that this implementation is even faster for the example polynomials.
