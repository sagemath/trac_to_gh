I should be able to coerce elements of the residue field of a p-adic ring back into the ring, but I can't:

```
sage: R.<z> = Zq(9)
sage: F = R.residue_class_field()
sage: F
Finite Field in z0 of size 3^2
sage: a = F.gen()
sage: R(a)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError
```
