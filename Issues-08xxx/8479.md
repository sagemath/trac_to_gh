done in the new patch

> * All the examples in the doctests are for functions with a single argument. Is there any reason to move the check in `sage.symbolic.function.Function.__call__()` to try all arguments?

In the original patch I forgot to add tests for atan2, which also didn't work with numpy before. The tests are now included.

> We should also consider moving this check to `sage.symbolic.function.BuiltinFunction.__call__()`.

Why would this be better? It currently does not have a `__call__` method.

Checking the type of each argument introduces a penalty for functions with a single argument.\n\n> It currently does not have a `__call__` method.\n\nSorry about that. I confused it with the `__call__()` method of `GinacFunction`, which also checks if there is only one argument, and it has a method with the same name as the function. Now I wonder why isn't that in `BuiltinFunction`...\n\n\nYour patch was missing an empty line after line 165 in `sage/functions/other.py`. [attachment: trac-8479-numpy_functions.take2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8479/trac-8479-numpy_functions.take2.patch.gz) fixes this.

Thanks!

Fair enough.

This code path is speed critical since it gets called thousands of times for many applications like plotting. Checking the type of each argument introduces a penalty for functions with a single argument.

> It currently does not have a `__call__` method.

Sorry about that. I confused it with the `__call__()` method of `GinacFunction`, which also checks if there is only one argument, and it has a method with the same name as the function. Now I wonder why isn't that in `BuiltinFunction`...


Your patch was missing an empty line after line 165 in `sage/functions/other.py`. [attachment: trac-8479-numpy_functions.take2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8479/trac-8479-numpy_functions.take2.patch.gz) fixes this. Only [attachment: trac-8479-numpy_functions.take2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8479/trac-8479-numpy_functions.take2.patch.gz) should be applied.


Great work!
