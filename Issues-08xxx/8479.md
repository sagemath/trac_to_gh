The patch looks really good and addresses an important problem. I have a few minor remarks/questions before I give a positive review:

* Can we change the test in sage.functions.other.sqrt() to work without importing numpy? I didn't check the effects on performance, but `sqrt()` gets used a lot, so keeping it free of `numpy` unless absolutely necessary would be good.
* All the examples in the doctests are for functions with a single argument. Is there any reason to move the check in `sage.symbolic.function.Function.__call__()` to try all arguments? We should also consider moving this check to `sage.symbolic.function.BuiltinFunction.__call__()`.

In the original patch I forgot to add tests for atan2, which also didn't work with numpy before. The tests are now included.

> We should also consider moving this check to `sage.symbolic.function.BuiltinFunction.__call__()`.

Why would this be better? It currently does not have a `__call__` method.

Checking the type of each argument introduces a penalty for functions with a single argument.\n\n> It currently does not have a `__call__` method.\n\nSorry about that. I confused it with the `__call__()` method of `GinacFunction`, which also checks if there is only one argument, and it has a method with the same name as the function. Now I wonder why isn't that in `BuiltinFunction`...\n\n\nYour patch was missing an empty line after line 165 in `sage/functions/other.py`.

Thanks for the quick response.

Thanks!

Fair enough.

This code path is speed critical since it gets called thousands of times for many applications like plotting. Checking the type of each argument introduces a penalty for functions with a single argument.

> It currently does not have a `__call__` method.

Sorry about that. I confused it with the `__call__()` method of `GinacFunction`, which also checks if there is only one argument, and it has a method with the same name as the function. Now I wonder why isn't that in `BuiltinFunction`...
