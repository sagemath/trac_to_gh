I hadn't seen this before! It's an enhancement to symbolic functions, so I'm changing the component to `symbolics`.

The patch looks really good and addresses an important problem. I have a few minor remarks/questions before I give a positive review:

* Can we change the test in sage.functions.other.sqrt() to work without importing numpy? I didn't check the effects on performance, but `sqrt()` gets used a lot, so keeping it free of `numpy` unless absolutely necessary would be good.
* All the examples in the doctests are for functions with a single argument. Is there any reason to move the check in `sage.symbolic.function.Function.__call__()` to try all arguments? We should also consider moving this check to `sage.symbolic.function.BuiltinFunction.__call__()`.

Why would this be better? It currently does not have a `__call__` method.

Fair enough.

This code path is speed critical since it gets called thousands of times for many applications like plotting. Checking the type of each argument introduces a penalty for functions with a single argument.

> It currently does not have a `__call__` method.


Sorry about that. I confused it with the `__call__()` method of `GinacFunction`, which also checks if there is only one argument, and it has a method with the same name as the function. Now I wonder why isn't that in `BuiltinFunction`...


Your patch was missing an empty line after line 165 in `sage/functions/other.py`. attachment:trac-8479-numpy_functions.take2.patch fixes this. Only attachment:trac-8479-numpy_functions.take2.patch should be applied.


Great work!
