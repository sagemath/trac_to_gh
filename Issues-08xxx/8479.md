* All the examples in the doctests are for functions with a single argument. Is there any reason to move the check in `sage.symbolic.function.Function.__call__()` to try all arguments? We should also consider moving this check to `sage.symbolic.function.BuiltinFunction.__call__()`.

Why would this be better? It currently does not have a `__call__` method.

Fair enough.

>

This code path is speed critical since it gets called thousands of times for many applications like plotting. Checking the type of each argument introduces a penalty for functions with a single argument.

> It currently does not have a `__call__` method.

Sorry about that. I confused it with the `__call__()` method of `GinacFunction`, which also checks if there is only one argument, and it has a method with the same name as the function. Now I wonder why isn't that in `BuiltinFunction`...


Your patch was missing an empty line after line 165 in `sage/functions/other.py`. [attachment:trac-8479-numpy_functions.take2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8479/trac-8479-numpy_functions.take2.patch) fixes this. Only [attachment:trac-8479-numpy_functions.take2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8479/trac-8479-numpy_functions.take2.patch) should be applied.


Great work!
