There is a pickle error with the nested class RauzyDiagram.Path in sage.combinat.iet.template

```
sage: p = iet.Permutation('a b c','c b a')
sage: r = p.rauzy_diagram()
sage: g = r.path(p, 't', 'b')
sage: dumps(g)
PicklingError Traceback(most recent call last)
...
PicklingError: Can't pickle <class 'sage.combinat.iet.labelled.Path'>: attribute lookup sage.combinat.iet.labelled.Path failed
```

A `__metaclass__` must be defined for RauzyDiagram.

The ticket depends on #8386 which moves the module for interval exchange transformations from sage.combinat.iet to sage.dynamics.interval_exchanges

Apply only [attachment: trac_8388_pickling_path.v2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8388/trac_8388_pickling_path.v2.patch.gz)

Depends on #8386

Hellooo !!!!

This ticket can be set to positive review after two changes :

* That it be rebased against a recent version of Sage. The patch applies with a hunk right now
* That the commit message be changed so as to contain the ticket's number, or the release manager will have to shout `:-D`
