There is a pickle error with the nested class RauzyDiagram.Path in sage.combinat.iet.template

```
sage: p = iet.Permutation('a b c','c b a')
sage: r = p.rauzy_diagram()
sage: g = r.path(p, 't', 'b')
sage: dumps(g)
PicklingError Traceback(most recent call last)
...
PicklingError: Can't pickle <class 'sage.combinat.iet.labelled.Path'>: attribute lookup sage.combinat.iet.labelled.Path failed
```

A __metaclass__ must be defined for RauzyDiagram.

The ticket depends on #8386 which moves the module for interval exchange transformations from sage.combinat.iet to sage.dynamics.interval_exchanges
