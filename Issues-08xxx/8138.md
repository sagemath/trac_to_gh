Wow, the index looks *terrible* before applying this patch, much better afterwards.  This adds 51 pages to the reference manual, but that's just a little over 1% of its total length, so I'm not concerned by that. 

One small error: you need an "r" before the triple quotes; otherwise the latex file says "enewenvironment" instead of "\renewenvironment".  I added it to the patch.
