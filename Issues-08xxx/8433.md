```
The following plot command fails (tachyon gets all CPU usage and no picture is shown)

```
y=var('y')
B=plot3d(sqrt(sin(x)*sin(y)),(x,-2*pi,2*pi),(y,-2*pi,2*pi),viewer='tachyon')
B.show()
```
This works fine

```
y=var('y')
B=plot3d(sqrt(sin(x)*sin(y)),(x,0,2),(y,0,2), viewer='tachyon')
B.show()
```
and this does not work

```
y=var('y')
B=plot3d(sqrt(sin(x)*sin(y)),(x,-2,2),(y,-2,2), viewer='tachyon')
B.show()
```
Related trac is #8424, but the problem seems to be independent.

This sounds like the NaNs are giving tachyon (or the triangle constructing routine) problems.  That's where I would look first for the problem, anyway.

Yep, seems to work for me too (sage 4.6).  I think this has been fixed.

Ccing the release manager.  I don't know if he wants to close it as invalid or fixed.  Also CCing Minh, who knows the policy for closing these sorts of things.

It's better to add the above doctests to the documentation for `plot3d.py` just to be safe. See the attachment.
