```
The following plot command fails (tachyon gets all CPU usage and no picture is shown)

```
y=var('y')
B=plot3d(sqrt(sin(x)*sin(y)),(x,-2*pi,2*pi),(y,-2*pi,2*pi),viewer='tachyon')
B.show()
```
This works fine

```
y=var('y')
B=plot3d(sqrt(sin(x)*sin(y)),(x,0,2),(y,0,2), viewer='tachyon')
B.show()
```
and this does not work

```
y=var('y')
B=plot3d(sqrt(sin(x)*sin(y)),(x,-2,2),(y,-2,2), viewer='tachyon')
B.show()
```
Related trac is #8424, but the problem seems to be independent.

I don't think this would be useful
