Why does this function use a dictionary instead of a list? Is it done for functions that can get values for "large" n without computing all of the previous?

Since it does use a dictionary, why does it assume ``base`` to be like [a_0, a_1, a_2]? It seems to me that it would be more reasonable then to take a dictionary as  ``base`` in case I want to give [a_1, a_2, a_3] or [a_{-2}, a_0] or even [entry_{"a"}, entry_{"b"}]. That would allow even for multidimensional sequences indexed by tuples!

The documentation is not quite clear to me. I don't understand what exactly does the description of ``f`` mean and I think that while lambda-form is probably the way to use this function (so the included examples must stay), it would be nice if examples were also written in an "expanded" way with each internal function having a meaningful name and some explanation what exactly should it take as an argument and what should it return. I didn't understand how to use this function until I looked at the source code.

Finally, the examples test only that the function does not crush. There should be comparison with expected output. E.g. show that it is possible to compute Fibonacci numbers that were not given as input and that actually even required computing some intermediate ones!

As a possible improvement to consider (but I don't know if it should be done): what about admissible indices? What is the (-10)-th Fibonacci number? Infinite recursion? Maybe there should an optional parameter for a function that will check that there exists the corresponding element. And maybe there can be some way to see which values are already computed to determine if they will be enough to evaluate the new one or in case when it is possible to use several ways.

Sparseness. Some sequences jump around... a lot. I have no clue how you could write an implementation using a list: you'd need to calculate the terms in order which is often not possible!

> Since it does use a dictionary, why does it assume base to be like [a_0, a_1, a_2]? It seems to me that it would be more reasonable then to take a dictionary as base in case I want to give [a_1, a_2, a_3] or [a_{-2}, a_0] or even [entry_{"a"}, entry_{"b"}]. That would allow even for multidimensional sequences indexed by tuples!


This is perhaps a poor design choice. I'll make it so you can give `_either_` a list of dictionary. My thought was that writing {0:1,1:1} was more tedious than [1,1]. Convenience is its own quality.

> The documentation is not quite clear to me.

OK. I'll try to make this more clear.

You mean like:

sage: fib = construct_sequence([1,1],lambda t: lambda n: t(n-1)+t(n-2) )
sage: [fib(n) for n in range(50)]
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765,10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, 75025, 121393, 196418, 317811, 514229, 832040, 1346269, 2178309, 3524578, 5702887, 9227465, 14930352, 24157817, 39088169, 63245986, 102334155, 165580141, 267914296, 433494437, 701408733, 1134903170, 1836311903, 2971215073, 4807526976, 7778742049, 12586269025]


> As a possible improvement to consider (but I don't know if it should be done): what about admissible indices?


Depends on the sequence, ideally.

> What is the (-10)-th Fibonacci number? Infinite recursion? Maybe there should an optional parameter for a function that will check that there exists the corresponding element.


It isn't possible to tell from the function. Testing whether a function will necessarily exit from its definition is NP. We could have an option to give the sequences domain. One nice thing about the dictionary is the flexibility it gives: the index could be reals, or just about anything else.

> And maybe there can be some way to see which values are already computed to determine if they will be enough to evaluate the new one or in case when it is possible to use several ways.
