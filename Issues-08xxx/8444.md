At [sage-support](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/a145a02c8d379b11), Ben Linowitz reported a problem with memory. Apparently it boils down to the following problem:

```

```
This is with sage 4.3.3 on sage.math.

So, the first 6673 everything is good. Then, regularly after 2112 rounds there is a leak of 135168 Byte. As Yann has observed, we have `135168==2112*64`. Thus it seems that the memory is allocated in chunks, but the leak is 64 Byte in each round.

The leak does not occur for multivariate rings:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: M = get_memory_usage()
sage: for n in range(50000):
....:     Mnew = get_memory_usage()
....:     if Mnew > M:
....:         print n, Mnew-M
....:         M=Mnew
....:     a = R(1)
....:
0 1.5
```

In fact, both count as calls to `_sig_on` (actually `_sig_on` is\nequivalent to `_sig_str(NULL)`) and these are *not* reentrant, i.e. nesting is not\nsupported (anyway, there's only one implicit `_sig_off` in the call to new_gen).\n\nA double `_sig_on`, as defined in `interrupt.h`, is usually equivalent to a single\none -- however, for the pari library these macros are overrided as `_pari_sig_on`\n(defined in `misc.h` and `pari_err.h`) adding a call to pari's own error catching\nfunction.  Calling the `err_catch()` function twice without the corresponding\ncall to `err_leave()` results in a memory leak which is reported in #8444.\n\nThe patch is one-liner: removing the first `_sig_on` fixes the memory leak.\n\nNote: this line was added by changeset `10536:423520e7d069` as part of a large\neffort to add lots of missing calls to `_sig_on` in pari interface. However, I\nthink in this case it was just an oversight because the already existing call to\n`_sig_on` was only implicit in the call to `_sig_str`.",

Here's the full commit log which explains the patch:

#8444: fix memory leak due to dup call to `_sig_on` in the bottom part of `PariInstance.__call__`

At the bottom of `PariInstance.__call__` both `_sig_on` (first) and `_sig_str`
(later) are used. In fact, both count as calls to `_sig_on` (actually `_sig_on` is
equivalent to `_sig_str(NULL)`) and these are *not* reentrant, i.e. nesting is not
supported (anyway, there's only one implicit `_sig_off` in the call to new_gen).

A double `_sig_on`, as defined in `interrupt.h`, is usually equivalent to a single
one -- however, for the pari library these macros are overrided as `_pari_sig_on`
(defined in `misc.h` and `pari_err.h`) adding a call to pari's own error catching
function.  Calling the `err_catch()` function twice without the corresponding
call to `err_leave()` results in a memory leak which is reported in #8444.

The patch is one-liner: removing the first `_sig_on` fixes the memory leak.

Note: this line was added by changeset `10536:423520e7d069` as part of a large
effort to add lots of missing calls to `_sig_on` in pari interface. However, I
think in this case it was just an oversight because the already existing call to
`_sig_on` was only implicit in the call to `_sig_str`.
