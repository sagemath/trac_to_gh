Generic `__call__` function for parents has a default value for its first argument. This prevents from making a difference between A() and A(0). This causes problems for crystal code, where the typical input is A(2,1,4,3,0,...). For example:

```
    sage: T = CrystalOfTableaux(['B',3], shape=[3])
    sage: t=T(1,2,0)
    sage: t
    [[1, 2, 0]]

    sage: T = CrystalOfTableaux(['B',3], shape=[])
    sage: t=T()
    sage: t     # goes boom
    sage: t._list # this list should be empty
    [0]
```

Suggestion: self.__call__() could instead call right away self._element_constructor_().

An alternate suggestion: in CrystalOfTableaux define

```

    def __call__(self, x=[], *args, **kwds):
        return Parent.__call__(self, x, *args, **kwds)

Oh, I see.  The issue is that the generic call is constructing a morphism from the parent of x, and so x can't be non-existent.  You may need to just completely override the generic `Parent.__call__`.

Hi David!

Thanks for your feedback!

Replying to [@roed314](#comment%3A2):

I'd rather not duplicate that rather technical code :-) And still we want to benefit from coercion ... 

Do you see an inconvenient to the first approach suggested?

I think the 

```
    def __call__(self, x=[], *args, **kwds):
        return Parent.__call__(self, x, *args, **kwds)
```

approach is probably the best.  I had to do this recently when converting some old code to use the new `Parent.__call__`.

I'm not sure why that's much different.  The whole point is that calling with no arguments should be the same as calling with the empty list.
