various fixes needed to move to GAP 4.4.12, mostly concerning
TESTS:: and EXAMPLES::
Due to apparent changes in GAP internals, some things like the order
of irreducible characters of a group can change from a previous
release. I made comparisons in docstrings as foolproof as possible.

These changes break gap-4.4.10.spkg.

Dependencies: #8076.

`# random order` is preferable to `#not tested`. I think a lot of these could be tested in sensible ways. For example, if word_problem returned a list of *tuples* rather than lists (which is more natural), then one could do

```
sage: w = word_problem([a*b,a*c], b*c)
sage: set(w) == set([(a*b, 1), (a*c, 1)])
```

Even better, 

```
sage: w = word_problem([a*b,a*c], b*c); w # random solution
[[a*b, 1], [a*c, 1]]
sage: w == prod(g^e for g,e in w)
True
```

which demonstrates that w is indeed a solution. 

Also, it's clearer to us any and all instead of reduce, if you need to. Having huge blocks of `#not tested` should be avoided unless there's no clean way around it.

There is no clean way around them without a major redesign.

I applied the patch and tested this. Yes, this is basically correct, except for the gap.version() tests.

I now will test the patch after the 4.4.12 spkg is applied.

Sorry, I should have added that the last failure I reported was unrelated (it was on a mac 10.6.2, where this segfault wasthe only failure on a clean install of 4.3.2.a1). Looks like you have fixed everything then!

just uploaded new patch 13805 here, that should be applied on top of 13804.
Note that these updates are now gap-4.4.12-only - they will break 4.4.10!

This should be it...

With both patches applied (and the 4.4.12 gap spkg) , this now passes sage -testall except for the segfault already reported.

Positive review but maybe this should be tested on other platforms?

Thanks Dima!

I think you misunderstood what I was going for. A test like

```
        sage: G.<a,b,c> = AbelianGroup(3,[2,3,4]); G 
        Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to C2 x C3 x C4 
        sage: w = word_problem([a*b,a*c], b*c); w  # random solution
        [[a*b, 1], [a*c, 1]]   
        sage: prod([x^i for x,i in w]) == a  
        sage: True
```

is perfectly fine to have in the EXAMPLES section, perfectly illustrating the math and the implementation. Much preferable to having a separate TEST section and a bunch of examples with a #random or #not tested marker. (FYI, what the #random marker means is "run this test, but ignore the output" so you don't need it for the "setup" steps. Also, in terms of patch naming, 13804 is only unique to you--it's usually easier for others if the patches are named with the ticket number in them.

I have fixed all this (only one TEST is left, in class_function.py, as I think it's
too ugly to have in EXAMPLES) in just uploaded here cumulative patch named trac-8150. (so it subsumes the previous two that are to be discarded.)
The rest are re-done as you suggest.
Please take a look.
