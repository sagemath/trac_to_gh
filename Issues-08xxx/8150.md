various fixes needed to move to GAP 4.4.12, mostly concerning
TESTS:: and EXAMPLES::
Due to apparent changes in GAP internals, some things like the order
of irreducible characters of a group can change from a previous
release. I made comparisons in docstrings as foolproof as possible.

These changes break gap-4.4.10.spkg.

Dependencies: #8076.

`# random order` is preferable to `#not tested`. I think a lot of these could be tested in sensible ways. For example, if word_problem returned a list of *tuples* rather than lists (which is more natural), then one could do

```
sage: w = word_problem([a*b,a*c], b*c)
sage: set(w) == set([(a*b, 1), (a*c, 1)])
```

Even better, 

```
sage: w = word_problem([a*b,a*c], b*c); w # random solution
[[a*b, 1], [a*c, 1]]
sage: w == prod(g^e for g,e in w)
True
```

which demonstrates that w is indeed a solution. 

Also, it's clearer to us any and all instead of reduce, if you need to. Having huge blocks of `#not tested` should be avoided unless there's no clean way around it.

There is no clean way around them without a major redesign.

I now will test the patch after the 4.4.12 spkg is applied.

The following tests failed:
 
         sage -t  "devel/sage/doc/en/constructions/polynomials.rst"
         sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py"
         sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/misc/sage_eval.py"
         sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py"
         sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element.pyx"
         sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/structure/element_wrapper.py" # Segfault
```

the first 5 are trivial to fix (already done). I am unable to reproduce
the last one:

```
dima@boxen:~/sage$ ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/structure/element_wrapper.py 
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/structure/element_wrapper.py"
	 [4.7 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
```

Are we testing on the same codebase?
(4.3.2.alpha1 with my gap-4.4.12 and other related (database_gap and gap_packages) spkgs)

What hardware/OS/compiler? 
here:

```
Linux boxen 2.6.24-24-server #1 SMP Sat Aug 22 00:59:57 UTC 2009 x86_64 GNU/Linux
gcc version 4.2.4 (Ubuntu 4.2.4-1ubuntu4)

just uploaded new patch 13805 here, that should be applied on top of 13804.
Note that these updates are now gap-4.4.12-only - they will break 4.4.10!

This should be it...

I have fixed all this (only one TEST is left, in class_function.py, as I think it's
too ugly to have in EXAMPLES) in just uploaded here cumulative patch named trac-8150. (so it subsumes the previous two that are to be discarded.)
The rest are re-done as you suggest.
