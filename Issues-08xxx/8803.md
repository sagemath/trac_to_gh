Thoughts?

With Sage 5.0 being the next major release, perhaps it's now time to remove any deprecated functions/classes/methods that are over 6 months old. Such removal could happen after Sage 4.4.2 is out next week.

I agree that it would be a good time to remove old deprecated code.

Since many of our users are on an academic cycle, maybe we ought to adjust the deprecation schedule so that deprecated things won't be removed during the academic year, but could be removed after the next big release after the later of 6 months or the end of the academic year?

Oh, I didn't realize it was 6 months - somehow I read on a thread that it was 12 months.  I don't think that axes.py creates any problems other than lowering our sage -coverage score :)  But Sage 5.0 does seem like an allowable time to remove things that have been deprecated for the requisite time.

The deprecation has been in place for a LONG time, (over 18 months), and this module does not have any remaining functionality, nor was it ever really very end-user available.  We thought at one point that 5.0 would be in the near future, so we thought that was a good goal for when to remove it, but that was over a year ago.    This should be removed.  Jason?
