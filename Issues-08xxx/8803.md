Thoughts?

With Sage 5.0 being the next major release, perhaps it's now time to remove any deprecated functions/classes/methods that are over 6 months old. Such removal could happen after Sage 4.4.2 is out next week.

I agree that it would be a good time to remove old deprecated code.

Since many of our users are on an academic cycle, maybe we ought to adjust the deprecation schedule so that deprecated things won't be removed during the academic year, but could be removed after the next big release after the later of 6 months or the end of the academic year?
