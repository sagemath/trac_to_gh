oops, careless renaming of files... It's not just a tar file ;-)

I created gap_packages-4.4.12_2.spkg using sage -spkg (takes looong time on t2 :))
and then renamed the file gap_packages-4.4.12_3.spkg

And this does not fly, as sage does some checking on the spkg filename...
If you still have that downloaded file, rename it please to gap_packages-4.4.12_2.spkg and try 
spkg -f again.
Otherwise, please download and sage -f
 http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/gap_packages-4.4.12_2.spkg
(this is the updated version)

I would have thought it needed to be called gap_packages-4.4.12_2.p0 and an entry added to SPKG.txt to indicate what changes have been made. 

Is this likely to fix the other gap issue? If so, I'll try that later, but I have other things to do today, so can't spend long over it. By the weekend, I should have more time.

Regarding SPKG.txt, I followed the predecessors, who didn't bother with it. :-)

Well, it's an optional package, and I will to update it soon with more GAP
packages (and make SPKG.txt good and proper...).

most of them a very specialised, and people would be better off usign them in 
GAP directly. Some of them, moreover, as just interfaces to other CA systems, 
or contain such interfaces, and thus are largely useless within Sage.

At least one GAP package, ace, is packaged as a separate spkg
(and needs to be installed after gap_packages)
 
ace was broken since 4.3.3, and noone complained, so that's about how wide
the user base of a typical GAP package is in Sage.
(I fixed ace, by the way, there is a recent ticket opened by my, with a ready fix)

I basically only have enough time to maintain and improve what I need in Sage for my research and teaching. I am on a tenure-track...

That is fine. 

* The bug is fixed, so the packages install on Solaris.
* There is now a SPKG.txt
* There is now a Mercurial repository.

Positve review. I'm not sure how to get the old package removed and this one put in its place. I better ask on sage-devel.

You confirmed what I thought about the speciality of the packages. 

I did notice ace failed to install, though I realise the method I used to install them was working through them alphabetically, so ace would have been tried before gap_packages. I don't think there is any automatic way for a package to install its dependencies. 

I'll look for your ace package and will review that. 

Thank you for fixing this. Not that I personally will be using it, but its nice to know it installs correctly now. 

Realistically these optional packages should be checked before a release is made, so things like the breakage of ace since 4.3.3 do not happen. I can not believe Wolfram Research would release a new release of Mathematica without verifying the 'AddOns' install properly. If sage is going to be a viable alternative to Mathematica, for me at least there needs to be a bit more emphasis on quality control.
