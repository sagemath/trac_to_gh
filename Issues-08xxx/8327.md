This patch provides the universal cyclotomic field

```
    sage: UCF.<E> = UniversalCyclotomicField(); UCF
    Universal Cyclotomic Field endowed with the Zumbroich basis
```

in sage. This field is the smallest field extension of QQ which contains all roots of unity.

```
    sage: E(3); E(3)^3
    E(3)
    1
    sage: E(6); E(6)^2; E(6)^3; E(6)^6
    -E(3)^2
    E(3)
    -1
    1
```

It comes equipped with a distinguished basis, called the Zumbroich
basis, which gives, for any n, A basis of QQ( E(n) ) over QQ, where (n,k) stands for E(n)^k.

```
    sage: UCF.zumbroich_basis(6)
    [(6, 2), (6, 4)]
```

As seen for E(6), every element in UCF is expressed in terms of the smallest cyclotomic field in which it is contained.

```
sage: E(6)*E(4)
-E(12)^11
```

It provides arithmetics on UCF as addition, multiplication, and inverses:

```
    sage: E(3)+E(4)
    E(12)^4 - E(12)^7 - E(12)^11
    sage: E(3)*E(4)
    E(12)^7
    sage: (E(3)+E(4)).inverse()
    E(12)^4 + E(12)^8 + E(12)^11
    sage: (E(3)+E(4))*(E(3)+E(4)).inverse()
    1
```

And also things like Galois conjugates.

```
    sage: (E(3)+E(4)).galois_conjugates()
    [E(12)^4 - E(12)^7 - E(12)^11, -E(12)^7 + E(12)^8 - E(12)^11, E(12)^4 + E(12)^7 + E(12)^11, E(12)^7 + E(12)^8 + E(12)^11]
```

The ticket does not use the gap interface.

Depends on #13765

True. Maybe it's a bit too "cutesy," but using `n=0` might be nice -- after all, the `n`th cyclotomic field has roots of unity for all divisors of `n`, so this would still hold for the universal cyclotomic field and `n=0`.

There is a nice version of a modified Zumbroich basis in the article I used (both are implemented in the attached file) but I don't see how the author expresses any root of unity in terms of the basis (probably just due to my lack of knowledge). But Zumbroich should describe it in more detail in his thesis.

The attached class NewCyclotomicField uses the modified Zumbroich basis and behaves already somehow as it should (beside pretty printing).

If people think the Zumbroich basis itself is nicer, it's easy to change. I personally think the modified version as defined in Breuer - "Integral bases for subfields of cyclotomic fields" AAECC8, 279--289 (1997) has nicer properties (see the definition of the set S_n and Remark 1).

Here are some implementation problems I have:

- how can I replace CombinatorialAlgebra by a new field constructor (I haven't found a description how to define a field)?

- how can I embed a CombinatorialAlgebra into another one (here: NewCyclotomicField(m) into NewCyclotomicField(n) for m | n)?

- how can I define a new class UniversalCyclotomicField containing all cyclotomic fields?

- how can I define the attribute self._one in the constructor of NewCyclotomicField properly?

(for patchbot -- I hope that's right!). 

This doesn't quite look ready to me. I haven't tried applying the patch, but just on a visual check, I can see that lots of methods aren't documented or have no tests (*every* function added to Sage must be doctested, even those whose entire body is `"raise NotImplementedError"`). Also, the new module should be added to the reference manual, and the formatting should be valid ReST markup. 

I very much hope you can get this code into shape -- it'd be a great thing to have in Sage -- but for now I'm afraid it's a thumbs down.

This was only as cython booleans changed in the meantime. Beside that, the code was always working properly. I changed this minor problem, and it should be working now again.

I improved the documentation but there are still some things to be done...

My patch seems to fix the problem. At least, when one uses the new Cython spkg and applies the combinat queue up to and including Christian's patch and adds my patch as well (which is also in the combinat queue, I think), then sage builds and starts.

Note that the my patch does not add the new  Cython as a dependency - it should run with the old Cython as well.

However, I already get a doctest error in `devel/sage-combinat/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/sandpile.rst`. Now it is needed to test whether this error is due to the patches from here, or due to some other patch in the combinat queue.

Since it is not sure whether THIS ticket is the culprit, and since it builds with the new cython, I am promiting it to "needs review".

I did the same mistake the other way round: I did changes about 5 weeks ago, and only putted it on trac but not on the combinat queue...

I just merged both versions, and the doctest should pass now, and it should be rebased (both only if I didn't do any mistakes...).

Sorry, lazy_import *is* used. So, don't delete the patch. However, it does not apply. Reason: The first line of sage/categories/all.py currently is

```
from category import    is_Category, Category, HomCategory, AbstractCategory

My guess is that you worked on top of Nicolas's "multiple realizations" patch.

So, either submit a patch on trac that differs from the one in the combinat queue, or name #7980 as a dependency.

Suggestion: I can manually rebase your patch, so that I can test (and review) it now. The merge conflict is trivial and can be sorted out later.

The patch that is attached here does not apply on pure sage-4.7.2 or sage-4.8.alpha0. The reason is that this patch depends on Nicolas's patch from #7980.

So, at some point, the merge conflict has to be sorted out. However, for my review I don't need that you rebase it now.

OK, done.

When applying both patches, one gets

```
sage: 'numpy' in sys.modules
False
sage: sage0("'numpy' in sys.modules")
False
sage: UCF
Universal Cyclotomic Field endowed with the Zumbroich basis
sage: 'numpy' in sys.modules
True
sage: sage0("'numpy' in sys.modules")
False
```
So, numpy is only imported when needed, and this is what #11714 was about.

Apply trac_8327_universal_cyclotomic_field-cs.patch trac8327_lazy_import_UCF.patch

UCF.is_subring(UCF) just returns

```
sage: UCF is UCF

That's independent of UniqueRepresentation: ``X is X`` is true for any
Python object X.

So the test above breaks, my best bet is that the is_ring method that
gets called is the wrong one.

Good chase!

It is rebased and applies now on a new 4.8.alpha1 (NOT alpha0, but alpha1!)

There was a syntax error on the plain 4.8.alpha1, which I first had to get rid off.

Concerning the is_subring method, I get the following behaviour:

```
sage: UCF is UCF
True

sage: UCF.is_subring??
    def is_subring(self,other):
        r"""
        Returns currently True if ``self`` and ``other`` coincide.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: UCF.is_subring(UCF)
            True
        """
        return other is self

sage: UCF.is_subring(UCF)
False
```

This behaviour seems to be wired! But when replacing the lazy import of the UCF by a proper import in sage.rings.all, the wired behaviour disappears, so the problem must be something with the lazy import!

Ach ja! Sorry, I should have thought about this: it is an instance of
#10906: "lazy import can break unique representation". So UCF should
not be lazy imported. One probably can't lazy cimport numpy in
universal_cyclotomic_field_c.pyx. Hopefully one could replace, in
universal_cyclotomic_field.py:

```
from sage.rings.universal_cyclotomic_field.universal_cyclotomic_field_c import * 
```

by explicit lazy imports of the various functions:

```
lazy_import('sage.rings.universal_cyclotomic_field.universal_cyclotomic_field_c', 'ZumbroichBasis...')
```

or maybe just lazy import that module as, say, ucfc, and qualify all
its functions with it.

I don't have a working Sage in which I could insert the UCF patch
right now. But let me know if you need help!

Cheers,
				Nicolas

sorry for not deleting them, I fixed both 4 weeks ago (though I don't know if there is another rebase needed for

If you just didn't want to confuse the patchbot, you should insert a line in some comment, stating what patches have to be applied in what order:

Apply trac_8327_universal_cyclotomic_field-cs.patch

Apply trac_8327-rebased_for_v5.patch

(for the patchbot).

The previous patch conflicts with #4539, so I have done a new rebased patch. There was one change in `free_module.py` which was rejected, and whose purpose was not at all clear to me, so I didn't include it in the rebased patch -- all doctests seem to pass without it.

Hi,

Thanks for pushing the patch forward - I actually don't care whose name appears in the authors field, but I would appreciate if we can get the patch ready soon (maybe even for 5.0)!

I have a slightly newer version of the patch locally containing some missing docstrings and stuff. Do you mind if I delete all 4 attached patches and push one patch containing

+ all my new docstrings

+ rebased for 5.0.beta6 (is that recent enough? I haven't build anything newer, so I cannot rebase the patch for beta11; I could do that tomorrow after building.)

+ David's improvements in the docstrings

?

Best, Christian

These were not fixed in the docfix patch but in the rebase patch, so I didn't see them. (I actually fixed the first, but forgot to refresh the patch afterwards.)

I now attached the new version that should have the issues fixed. including the last which seems to me like not related to this patch, is it?

This is even worse, since the element involved isn't cyclotomic in the first place:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - 7)
sage: UCF(a)                      
a
sage: UCF(a) in UCF
True
```

In fact UCF will attempt to construct an element from anything whatsoever:

```
sage: UCF(None)
None
sage: UCF(QQ)
Rational Field
sage: UCF('hello')
'hello'
```

The following are not great either:

```
sage: UCF.has_coerce_map_from(CyclotomicField(3))
False
sage: QQbar.has_coerce_map_from(UCF)
False
```

Oh, I don't know, maybe the same behaviour as every other parent object in the Sage library? The default <code> \`__call__\` </code> calls <code> \`_element_constructor_\` </code>, which you should override, in order to create an element of self from the given arguments. This includes checking whether the given arguments are reasonable, and raising a TypeError otherwise.

You should also set the attribute wrapped_class for your element class to something other than the default (which is "object"), so the ` __init__` it inherits from ElementWrapper knows what it's supposed to be wrapping and doesn't wrap obviously bogus objects as in the examples above.

I don't quite understand the question, but if you're going to implement a class and call it "universal cyclotomic field", surely it had better satisfy a universal property with respect to cyclotomic fields? If your question is "how do I recognise a cyclotomic field", you might find ` isinstance(K, sage.rings.number_field.number_field.NumberField_cyclotomic) ` or perhaps ` sage.rings.number_field.number_field.is_CyclotomicField(K) ` helpful. You should also check ` K.coerce_embedding`, since it's possible to create cyclotomic fields with complex embeddings other than the standard one.

The idea is that one should *not* construct elements of the universal cyclotomic field using `UCF(arg)` but only through the function `E`, e.g., `E(5)`. So `UCF(arg)` should only be called for coercion.

I could overwrite `_element_constructor_` by

```
def _element_constructor_(self,arg):
    raise TypeError, "No coercion found for %s"%str(arg)
```

This would prevent `UCF` from ever constructing any element, and only using the coercion model to coerce objects if possible.

> You should also set the attribute wrapped_class for your element class to something other than the default (which is "object"), so the ` __init__` it inherits from ElementWrapper knows what it's supposed to be wrapping and doesn't wrap obviously bogus objects as in the examples above.

Do I see it right that this would then also be obsolete?

Let me define one coercion:

```
sage: from sage.rings.number_field.number_field_morphisms import NumberFieldEmbedding
sage: n = 5
sage: X = CyclotomicField(n)
sage: f = NumberFieldEmbedding(X,UCF,E(n))
sage: UCF.register_coercion(f)
sage: x = X.gen()
sage: UCF(x)
E(5)
```

First, how can I register this coercion for all `n`? Second, are there further number fields I should have a coercion from?

First, I consider this strongly unfriendly.

Second, after looking again at the coercion section of the reference manual, I still don't see what is so disastrously wrong (which obviously doesn't mean that it is not wrong), and how to tell a parent to register coercion from an infinite family of other parents.

Thanks, I now see how I can do the coercion here - except that I do not know how to handle non-standard embeddings. I do not know how to test if a non-standard embedding is used, and if so, I also do not know how to coerce then into the `UCF`.

` _element_constructor_`

I want that an element of `UCF` is never constructed using the `__call__` method but only using the function `E`. In the 4 steps in http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/coercion.html#provided-methods `__call__`, I want the first 3 to proceed, and if no coercion is found, that an error is raised. The idea here is that `UCF` has an infinite number of generators, and the easiest to play with them seems to be the same way this is done in `GAP`; simply doing things like

```
sage: E(3)     
E(3)
sage: E(3)+E(4)
E(12)^4 - E(12)^7 - E(12)^11
```

Also, I want to see

```
sage: UCF(5)
5
sage: UCF(5).parent()
Universal Cyclotomic Field endowed with the Zumbroich basis
sage: X = CyclotomicField(6)
sage: UCF(X.gen())
-E(3)^2
```

Is this generally wrong, or is the way I proposed to define `_element_constructor_` in my last comment just not the way to do that?

The patch is finally ready for review. The only issue with the patchbot is currently that I do load the module at startup - which is what I'd prefer (as long as no one else has a better idea of how to handle it).

Beside that, I added 100% coverage everywhere, and excluded 4 very small side tickets to be reviewed directly.

Cheers, Christian

let me start with a few simple remarks

- why are we changing the import of hecke_modules in this patch ?

- the doc of prime_subfield has a mistake : ZZ should be QQ

- in from_dict, only one parameter is documented

- the docs of `_eq_` and `_ne_` are strange, and look like a copy and paste

- is_unit should be removed, as already implemented in the class of Field elements

- it would be worth adding some of the methods of QQbar elements : minpoly and abs maybe

- maybe consider a coercion of real elements to the field AA ?

- somewhere near the beginning of the doc, it should be explained the following important points

  1 the field UCF is contained in the complex field
  
  2 how to coerce z to QQbar : QQbar(z)

  3 how to coerce z to the minimal cyclotomic field containing it : z.to_cyclotomic_field()

That's all for today.

Replying to [@fchapoton](#comment%3A115):

Thanks for your first look!

- I deleted the two later dependencies, since they are not really necessary (I only needed them at some point to work with the universal cyclotomics).

- I took your remarks into account:

> - why are we changing the import of hecke_modules in this patch ?

because the import of hecke_modules and of universal_cyclotomic_field causes an import loop. Since we want to use `UCF`, it was easier and cleaner to lazily import hecke_modules.

> - is_unit should be removed, as already implemented in the class of Field elements

the inherited `is_unit` method is not capturing the situation. It's implementation is

```
    def is_unit(self):
        if self == 1 or self == -1:
            return True
        raise NotImplementedError
```

> - it would be worth adding some of the methods of QQbar elements : minpoly and abs maybe

not yet done!

> - maybe consider a coercion of real elements to the field AA ?

This is impossible, isn't it? Here is a quote from the documentation:

"Another consequence of the consistency condition is that coercions can only go from exact rings (e.g., the rationals QQ) to inexact rings (e.g., real numbers with a fixed precision RR), but not the other way around."

Or am I misunderstanding something?

>   1 the field UCF is contained in the complex field

This coercion is going through QQbar, so I only documented the later.

Best, Christian

Well, I do not know. The point is that we can currently use QQbar(z) for z in UCF. I wonder wether one could do AA(z) for z in UCF and real, because AA is just the set of real elements of QQbar. But maybe I do not understand something..

Yes, But I rather meant the mathematical point : the field is defined as an embedded field, not as an abstract field..

That's right, but even though UCF knows that it is a field, its elements do not know that they are field elements. Do you happen to know how to solve that?

(I thought you meant the other way round...) It was easy to implement the conversion to QQ and ZZ, and to set the coercion to QQbar. But I don't quite know how to do conversion to AA.

```
sage: AA(QQbar(E(5) + E(5)^4))  
0.618033988749895?

works, but one currently has to pass through QQbar.

A few more comments

* this import is apparently not used :

from sage.rings.complex_field import ComplexField 

* the sort of elements is backwards compared to the order for cyclotomic fields

```
sage: v=UCF.random_element(7);v
-5*E(7) - 4*E(7)^3 + 4*E(7)^4 + E(7)^5
sage: v.to_cyclotomic_field()
zeta7^5 + 4*zeta7^4 - 4*zeta7^3 - 5*zeta7
```
maybe it would be better to go the same way ? but maybe this is the same as gap ?

* Is the is_subring method necessary ? it is almost empty !

* in the element constructor, maybe one could answer by something like

"no coercion found for elements of XXX"

with XXX the parent of the argument ? It would be more informative, no ?

* maybe zumbroich_basis should be called zumbroich_basis_indices ? I would expect that something called zumbroich_basis would return elements of the field, which is not really the case. Well, this is not that important..

* more generally, maybe one could try to avoid using assert, and better raise precise Exceptions ?

I used the same order as gap (the increasing ordering on the exponents). I think I would prefer this ordering...

I don't quite remember where but I needed this (indeed trivially implemented) method at some point to not catch an error. Maybe it was when working with matrices over UCF?

done, I had to distinguish between objects having a parent and those not having one.

If I am not mistaken, the hash is only unique in a given Sage session.

It is not required that the hash value of an object be unique across
Sage session. However the implementation usually guarantees this,
which is a good feature. In fact, most of the time in Sage, the hash
value only depends on the architecture (32bits/64bits) and when this
is the case, it is good to test it explicitly in order to get noticed
in case the hash value would change for some reason (which could be a
bug or a long distance consequence of something else), as in:

            sage: e = RootSystem(['A',2]).ambient_space()
            sage: hash(e.simple_root(0))
            -4601450286177489034          # 64-bit
            549810038                     # 32-bit

Just a side note: as discussed on sage-combinat-devel, assertions are
preferable in the following situations:

- For checking the internal state of the program
- When the caller should *not* catch the exception
- In time critical locations

Beside, nothing prevents from writing a meaningful message in an
assertion check.

Did you try implementing the (partial) morphism from UCF to AA (using SetMorphism and the category of SetsWithPartialMaps), and register it as a conversion?

If yes, this could possibly be done during the initialization of UCF.

Good call, it works now! Thanks!

One more thing: do you also know how to do the same for the cyclotomic fields ? What I would need is something like

```
        SetMorphism(
                Hom(self, CyclotomicField(n), SetsWithPartialMaps()),
                lambda elem: elem.to_cyclotomic_field()
            ).register_as_conversion()
```

The problem is that the parameter `n` is not determined a priori, and I want the conversion to exist for any `n`.

two minor suggestions :

* I would write "smallest subfield of the complex field" instead of "smallest subfield of the complex plane"

* I think one should explain somewhere at the beginning of the doc of E that the constant exp(1) can be found as the lowercase letter 'e'

There is no perfect support for this. But I guess you could change the initializtion of CyclotomicField so that, when the n-th Cyclotomic field F is constructed, the partial conversion UCF->F is constructed and registered as a conversion (and possibly the reverse coercion as well).

Hi --

I think we are now some big steps forward!

- I took care of everything Fred was asking for, in particular the partial conversion to `AA`.

and

- I implemented conversion to the cyclotomic field ! There is still an issue left, which I cannot take care off. Namely, the embedding of the cyclotomic field into the complex numbers can be given in the constructor. But I didn't find a way to capture this embedding to send an element of the universal cyclotomics into the cyclotomic field AND preserve the embedding.

Ready for another review!

Best, Christian

Well, I do indeed have this failing test :

sage -t -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_number_field.py"
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

with the patch applied, and it disappears when the patch is removed.

So I guess there **is** a problem somewhere..

I just rechecked on my machine, and I get `All tests passed!` in both cases. So, what might be the difference between Frédérics and my machine? I am running 5.5.rc0 on a 64bit Linux machine.

Lots of good code here!

Some comments:

* Why is get_parent_of_embedding in the pyx file when it's only used in the py file?

* No need to lazily import universal_cyclotomic_field_c, it's already behind another lazy import.

* CyclotomicField._coerce_map_from_ # TODO: use the embedding of other properly: you could use the method introduced in #13765, but if you don't want to do that then at least check it has the "standard" embedding sending the generator to the primitive root of unity CC or return None rather than silently producing wrong answers.

* Shouldn't `_coerce_map_from_` accept QQ?

* Does "endowed with the Zumbroich basis" need to be part of the printed name? Also, what about a nice `_latex_` representation?

* Using `<>` for != is deprecated, and I think goes away in python 3.

* Any reason not to inherit from Field?

* The `if bracket == ...` list might be better done with a dictionary mapping left to right, with a good exception on KeyError. Even better, IMHO, is to accept any even-character string (so one would pass "" or "[]" or "<<>>" or whatever one wanted). 

* `_gap_init = _repr_`  Not now that we've allowed different printing options.

* `__hash__` will fail on a 32-bit machine. Instead, test making a dict with UCF items then retrieving one.

* is ZumbroichBasisIndices really a Parent?

Hi Robert,

I told him to :-)

We want to move away from the static class hierarchy (Monoid, Field,
...) when there is not a strong compelling reason to use it (i.e. it
makes a difference speed wise, e.g. for element arithmetic), since
that duplicates the far more flexible category hierarchy.

Cheers,

+1 to this. Then why is is_Field not obtained by default?  I think there's performance benefit in moving to Ring at least, for multiplication (but I'd have to check that this is still the case).

> * The `if bracket == ...` list might be better done with a dictionary mapping left to right, with a good exception on KeyError. Even better, IMHO, is to accept any even-character string (so one would pass "" or "[]" or "<<>>" or whatever one wanted). 

done.

done.

still open.

I am not the specialist here, so feel free to modify this. Now, ZBI is a parent, and the tuples `(n,k)` are indeed elements thereof.

> * I agree with nbruin, there's a lot of caching going on that never gets freed. I would suggest having capped size caches, if you determine that you really need them. (Also, for CyclotomicFieldCached, better to fix this to make CyclotomicField faster, possibly using a weakref cache or one of the unique parent factories.)

done.

Best, Christian

It would be best to move those almost empty methods to the Fields
category. That being said, I totally understand if you prefer to get
done with this patch without risking conflicts with ongoing category
development. Can you just leave a quick note in the code like:

```
    .. TODO::

       Remove the inheritance from Field and FieldElement as soon as
       the methods X,Y,Z are implemented in the Fields category.
```

Ideally you would also make a quick benchmark to check my guess that
inheriting from FieldElement does not make a speed difference.

Thanks!

I only found hashes for elements in your patch. Hash values are supposed to be machine-length integers associated to an object, consistent within one session, equal for objects that compare as equal (and preferably not equal to much else) [sage has to violate this due to equality being too lax and not transitive in the presence of coercion] and very little structure otherwise. In particular, the actual numerical values returned don't matter. It's better to check the properties that actually matter than particular values that are produced (which should be dependent on 32/64 bits because otherwise you're creating unnecessarily weak hashes on 64 bit)

Don't test the actual value returned by hash, but test its functionality. Something like (do we have some example that exercises hashes appropriately?):

```
sage: a = ...
sage: b = ...
sage: c = ...
sage: V = set([a,b])
sage: <definition for a> in V
true
sage: b in V
true
sage: c in V
false
```
and perhaps test your hash function is not the constant function and has a reasonable distribution:

```
sage: L = [<object> for i in [1..100]]
sage: set(hash(x) for x in L).len() >= 98
true
```
You did mark the tests as `64 bit` which may or may not elicit the right action from the doctesting framework, but it would be way better if your test actually did work (and did test) on 32 bit as well, which you can do by testing functionality, not value.

Right, but there is a `__hash__` function returning the id, that's why I wasn't quite sure... I now do test the hash by functionality, do you think it's better now?

Btw: As with the hash for elements in the CyclotomicField, it does not depend on the embedding of the parent. Do you think this might cause problems?

Hi Christian,

Sorry that your code review is devolving into a kind of "how to vet newly introduced parents" experiment. Please don't take it personally! I think we're still getting useful contributions to Sage at large from this for now, though.

For doing good (generic) tests for how hash performs:

```
sage: any( E(n) in L for n in [1001..2000] ) 
False
```
This test doesn't really test the non-constantness of hashes. This code would still work if `hash(E(n))==0` would hold for all `n`. After equality of hash value, `in` will still fall back on `__eq__`, with one exception: identical objects will be found with `in`:

```
sage: n = float(NaN)
sage: n == n
False
sage: n in set([n])
True
sage: m = float(NaN)
sage: m in set([n])
False
```
It's an optimization that is necessary for python to have reasonable performance that leads to nasty consequences for objects that are not equal to themselves (which is really an odd edgecase anyway)

Hello Christian,

in the file number_field.py, the documentation of the parameter bracket is wrong : you say

Can be ``None``, ``"("``, or ``"["``, with 

this is not consistent with the documentation in UCF, where it is an even-length chain

Do you think there are still important problems that need to be solved ? Maybe some caching questions ? And of course the patchbot is not happy with latest version.

In those cases, don't just look at the summary at the bottom.
There is a bit more info in the log file (use text search on the file name to find the relevant locations. The errors that arise are of the form:

```
  File "/mnt/storage2TB/patchbot/Sage/sage-5.5.rc0/local/lib/python/site-packages/sage/rings/all.py", line 169, in <module>
    lazy_import("sage.rings.universal_cyclotomic_field.all","*")
  File "lazy_import.pyx", line 850, in sage.misc.lazy_import.lazy_import (sage/misc/lazy_import.c:5168)
  File "lazy_import.pyx", line 900, in sage.misc.lazy_import.get_star_imports (sage/misc/lazy_import.c:5924)
EOFError
```
so apparently the lazy import fails for some reason. If it's a real issue, perhaps it's due to the order in which the lazy imports get triggered? Otherwise it might just be a temporary issue with that particular patchbot.

You can "kick" the patchbot by putting `?kick` after the URL of the ticket page at the patchbot. This has already happened and the errors keep shifting (look at the last couple of reports).

I suspect it's due to the lazy import (that's where the error occurs). I have no idea whether the lazy import here is done inappropriately, whether there's a subtle bug in lazy import that gets triggered here, or whether the patchbot has troubles that just happen to be triggered by this patch (sounds unlikely).

Have you taken into account that the first time running, lazy star imports are not lazy at all? It executes the actual import to cache which symbols get defined by the star import (the files in `.sage/cache`). I think this cache presently always gets deleted after `sage -b`. If testing `startup.py` is the first sage run after that, you cannot expect lazy behaviour.

This caching strategy has its flaws, but presently we'll have to live with it.

Well, if two consecutive runs still show the same behaviour, it's not the caching. Anyway, if you can avoid star-import altogether, caching doesn't come into play at all.

You'll have to avoid importing numpy on startup, since that has caused big startup delays previously (hence that doctest).

I think the main thing you're finding now is that we don't have much experience in how to use lazy import in more complicated scenarios, in particular in the whole `from ...all import *` scenarios that sage seems to use everywhere upon startup.

Thanks for the comment, I fixed this by removing some of the `except`'s, and used `KeyError`'s in two remaining places. I also fixed a bug, namely

```
sage: UCF(0).is_rational()
False
```
and added the doctests rechecking this. Since the patchbot doesn't like to apply #13765 (which was merged in 5.7.beta2), I wonder if you could have another look and either rebase the patch, or - if you don't plan to merge it - to wait until I have a new version compiled to rebase it myself.

A general comment concerning several complaints on this ticket from various directions: If you ask mathematicians to contribute to Sage, you get mathematicians writing code and code that is not necessarily perfect. This does have disadvantages! But please don't blame them (i.e. me here) for not being perfect programmers!

Beside that, I fixed the complaint concerning error messages and their Python 3 syntax, but I am not going to go into interruption handling in cython. This can be handled in another ticket by someone more advanced.

Finally: I already spent much too much time on this ticket (i.e., I implemented the stuff I actually needed for my research 2 years ago, all further hours and days were not spent anymore for my primary research). I would very much appreciate if we could get this ticket into Sage, and then solve further issues in other patches.

No problem, note that I purposely did not set the status to needs_work for this.  Your code is certainly not the only part of Sage with this problem.

It's simply a fact that going from proof-of-concept-research-code to actual good code to be included in Sage is a non-trivial step.  You could say it's unfortunate, but that's the way it is.
