If you run `sage-spkg PKG_NAME` and hit ctrl-c during downloading, you end up with a partial spkg file.  Then if you run `sage-spkg PKG_NAME` again, it just opens up that file and then crashes because the file is incomplete.

The attached patch attempts to fix this.  It seems to work, deleting the partially downloaded file, but for reasons I don't understand, it's not printing any of the accompanying messages.

The reason for the "non-printing" is simple:

In `local/bin/sage-sage`, the output of `sage-spkg` is piped to `tee`, which is run from the same subshell and so gets the same signal.

(`sage-spkg` *does* print the messages, but `tee` *does not* "wait" for the *post-*`Ctrl-C` output.)

Any ideas how to fix this?  I tried using "pipestatus" from #8306, but it doesn't seem to help: when I hit ctrl-C, it prints
