I can solve this by wrapping the fast-callable casts in a try except block, but of course that means that it isn't using them for unusual functions like the interpolators.

I've uploaded a new version of the fast_callable patch. It now properly avoids failing with lambda functions, although it doesn't work optimally for them. I'll add some notes on that in #10945. It also is updated to work properly with the numpy 1.5.1 version. Therefore tickets #10792 and #10821 should be applied first. I don't think the current patch is dependent on #5572, although I'm sure that faster fast_callables would help.

<a id='comment:16'></a>This seems to be faster and less buggy than before, although I still have a pretty easy time tripping it up.  For example, the following crescent region causes problems if its not translated as I do below, but even when its translated so that 0 is in the interior the spiderweb plot looks wrong:

```
npi = N(pi)
crescent = [(cos(t)+.9,sin(t)) for t in srange(npi/2,3*npi/2,npi/12)]
crescent = crescent + [(5.0*cos(t)/6+.9,sin(t)) for t in srange(3*npi/2,npi/2,-npi/12)]
ps = polygon_spline(crescent) 
f = lambda t: ps.value(real(t)) 
fprime = lambda t: ps.derivative(real(t)) 
m = Riemann_Map([f], [fprime], 0.25, ncorners=24) 
show(m.plot_colored() + m.plot_spiderweb(pts=100),figsize=[6,6])
``` 

But maybe that sort of problem should be in a seperate ticket.
