This patch speeds up the riemann mapping functionality by automatically trying to call fast_callable on the functions passed in.

Apply [attachment: trac-8867-riemann-fastcallable.2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8867/trac-8867-riemann-fastcallable.2.patch.gz).  Depends on  #10792 and #10821.

I believe that it is no longer true that this depends on #5572 (patch "improve_fast_callable.patch")

Did all of the tests work for you? The riemann tests go fine, but the interpolators do this:

```

  sage: m = Riemann_Map([lambda x: ps.value(real(x))], [lambda x: ps.derivative(real(x))],0)

Exception raised:

      m = Riemann_Map([lambda x: ps.value(real(x))], [lambda x: ps.derivative(real(x))],Integer(0))###line 52:
  sage: m = Riemann_Map([lambda x: ps.value(real(x))], [lambda x: ps.derivative(real(x))],0)

  AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'variables'
```

I can solve this by wrapping the fast-callable casts in a try except block, but of course that means that it isn't using them for unusual functions like the interpolators.

My big patch to fast_callable should also be able to handle the error, but it probably won't be finished or ready for testing for at least another couple of weeks, so if you have time now, don't wait for it.

This seems to be faster and less buggy than before, although I still have a pretty easy time tripping it up.  For example, the following crescent region causes problems if its not translated as I do below, but even when its translated so that 0 is in the interior the spiderweb plot looks wrong:

```
npi = N(pi)
crescent = [(cos(t)+.9,sin(t)) for t in srange(npi/2,3*npi/2,npi/12)]
crescent = crescent + [(5.0*cos(t)/6+.9,sin(t)) for t in srange(3*npi/2,npi/2,-npi/12)]
ps = polygon_spline(crescent) 
f = lambda t: ps.value(real(t)) 
fprime = lambda t: ps.derivative(real(t)) 
m = Riemann_Map([f], [fprime], 0.25, ncorners=24) 
show(m.plot_colored() + m.plot_spiderweb(pts=100),figsize=[6,6])
``` 

But maybe that sort of problem should be in a seperate ticket.
