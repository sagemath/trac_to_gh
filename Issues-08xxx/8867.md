This patch speeds up the riemann mapping functionality by automatically trying to call fast_callable on the functions passed in.

Apply [attachment: trac-8867-riemann-fastcallable.2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8867/trac-8867-riemann-fastcallable.2.patch.gz).  Depends on  #10792 and #10821.

I believe that it is no longer true that this depends on #5572 (patch "improve_fast_callable.patch")

Did all of the tests work for you? The riemann tests go fine, but the interpolators do this:

```
File "/home/ethan/sage-4.5.3/devel/sage/sage/calculus/interpolators.pyx", line 52:

  sage: m = Riemann_Map([lambda x: ps.value(real(x))], [lambda x: ps.derivative(real(x))],0)

Exception raised:

    File "<doctest __main__.example_1[7]>", line 1, in <module>
      m = Riemann_Map([lambda x: ps.value(real(x))], [lambda x: ps.derivative(real(x))],Integer(0))###line 52:
  sage: m = Riemann_Map([lambda x: ps.value(real(x))], [lambda x: ps.derivative(real(x))],0)
    File "riemann.pyx", line 164, in sage.calculus.riemann.Riemann_Map.__init__ (sage/calculus/riemann.c:1443) File "fast_callable.pyx", line 399, in sage.ext.fast_callable.fast_callable (sage/ext/fast_callable.c:2668)
  AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'variables'
```

I can solve this by wrapping the fast-callable casts in a try except block, but of course that means that it isn't using them for unusual functions like the interpolators.

I've uploaded a new version of the fast_callable patch. It now properly avoids failing with lambda functions, although it doesn't work optimally for them. I'll add some notes on that in #10945. It also is updated to work properly with the numpy 1.5.1 version. Therefore tickets #10792 and #10821 should be applied first. I don't think the current patch is dependent on #5572, although I'm sure that faster fast_callables would help.

This seems to be faster and less buggy than before, although I still have a pretty easy time tripping it up.  For example, the following crescent region causes problems if its not translated as I do below, but even when its translated so that 0 is in the interior the spiderweb plot looks wrong:

```
npi = N(pi)
crescent = [(cos(t)+.9,sin(t)) for t in srange(npi/2,3*npi/2,npi/12)]
crescent = crescent + [(5.0*cos(t)/6+.9,sin(t)) for t in srange(3*npi/2,npi/2,-npi/12)]
ps = polygon_spline(crescent) 
f = lambda t: ps.value(real(t)) 
fprime = lambda t: ps.derivative(real(t)) 
m = Riemann_Map([f], [fprime], 0.25, ncorners=24) 
show(m.plot_colored() + m.plot_spiderweb(pts=100),figsize=[6,6])
``` 

But maybe that sort of problem should be in a seperate ticket.

The crescent is a polygon with 24 vertices, so I thought using ncorners=24 would make sense.

To be honest, I didn't read the documentation very carefully.  This is a good simulation of general users :)  Now that I have, I am happy with the behavior of this function.
