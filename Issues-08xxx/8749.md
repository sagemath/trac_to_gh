The first is a timeout issue of some sort, and perhaps could be fixed by putting in some dots `...` in case the timeout message appears.  (I've also seen more failures of this type from the same file, so ellipses in several places might be needed.  Test on t2 several times to see.)

I have no idea about the second issue.  Presumably it's not a counterexample to BSD.
