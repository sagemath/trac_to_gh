Ok updated version now copies a suitable Makefile.in file from patches/ instead of the sed hack:

http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/opencdk-0.6.6.p4.spkg

The Makefile.am is not needed, so I did not change it. Hopefully upstream will make a new release before we have to edit this again. The Fedora people are trying to push these changes upstream.
