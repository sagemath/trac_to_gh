I want to solve f''/f=k with k in R


```
sage:  x=var('x')
sage: f=function('f',x)
sage: k=var('k')
sage: assume(k>0)
sage:  desolve(diff(f(x),x,2)/f(x)==k,[f,x]) 
```

and sage keeps answering :


```
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

   1452         self._session_number = parent._session_number
   1453 

TypeError: Computation failed since Maxima requested additional constraints (try the command 'assume(k>0)' before integral or limit evaluation, for example):
Is  k  positive, negative, or zero?
```

so I tried :




```
sage:  desolve(diff(f(x),x,2)/f(x)==k^2+1,[f,x])
```

and I got :

```
k1*e^(I*sqrt(-k^2 - 1)*x) + k2*e^(-I*sqrt(-k^2 - 1)*x)
```

<a id='comment:1'></a>I have the same problem solving a different equation:

```
var('L1 L2 C1 C2 L3 C3 t')
forget()
assume(L2 > 0)
assume(L3 > 0)
assume(C2 > 0)
assume(C3 > 0)
j = function('j',t)
eqn = diff(v_i,t) - L2*diff(j,t,2) - j/C2 == L3*diff(j,t,2) + j/C3
desolve(eqn,[j,t],[0,1])
```

returns

```
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
Is  C2*C3*(C3+C2)*(L3+L2)  positive, negative, or zero?
```

The only quick workaround I have found is to specify the values of the constants, but I really need them to be symbolic.  The best I can do is use primes for values of constants and after several such sets you can get a picture of how the constants are related to the numbers in the solution terms, but it's an ass-ache.

I think the best solution would be to have an optional argument to desolve which answers the question posed if there are not sufficient assumptions/conditions to already determine the correct answer.

Really appreciate the great work so far guys! :D
