I would rephrase the question and ask why are people adding -D_XPG6? Can they justify it? 

We can justify adding -std=c99, as we want to make use of a feature that was not defined until the C99 standard.  I don't know of any justification for adding -D_XPG6. (That is not to say there is not any, but I think the onus should be on someone who adds -D_XPG6 to justify why they add it.) 

There are quite a few bits of code in Sage which appear to be added just because someone else did so before, without anyone understanding why they did it. One sees things like 

```
path="$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin
```

when it should be:

```
path="$SAGE_LOCAL/bin"
```
I suspect people are just cutting/pasting without any understanding. 

I think it is better to just leave it as -std=c99, until such time as someone can justify why -D_XPG6 is best added. 

Please note, I'm not saying -D_XPG6 might not be right, but only that I'd rather not add things we don't understand.

Regarding chmm: That makes sense, because I use isfinite in chmm.pyx:

```
cdef extern from "math.h":
    double log(double)
    double sqrt(double)
    double exp(double)
    int isnormal(double)
    int isfinite(double)
```

So I'm fine with building it with c99.
