WeylGroups and WeylGroupElements have a method lattice() and also an attribute _lattice. At one time this pointed to the ambient lattice, but now it points to the ambient space.

After some discussion here:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/ad0c77557e78313f/9cfd6f09bcd1de2f?#9cfd6f09bcd1de2f

it has been decided that the method and attribute should be called `domain`.

The patch also makes reflections of the Weyl group a
family and adds methods `inverse_family` and `has_key` to
the method family, per Nicolas' suggestion.

Hi Dan!

Sorry for the late reply; I am just back from vacations.

Depending on how the Weyl group is constructed, W.lattice() can actually be a lattice:

```
sage: WeylGroup(RootSystem(["A",3]).root_lattice())
Weyl Group of type ['A', 3] (as a matrix group acting on the root lattice)
sage: WeylGroup(RootSystem(["A",3]).root_lattice()).lattice()
Root lattice of the Root system of type ['A', 3]
```

In fact, the name was meant as short hand for "which realization of the root lattice the group is naturally acting upon".

That being said, I agree that this name is not good. In particular, we probably will want to generalize this soon to handle Coxeter groups implemented as permutation groups (e.g. acting on the roots) instead of matrix groups. So the semantic of this method should probably be to return which ever natural space (or set) the group is naturally acting on. Its name should reflect that.

Any good suggestions?

- natural_action_space?
- root_system_realization?
- ...?

As for the reflections: this sounds like a useful feature, thanks! May I suggest an alternative implementation, namely to:

- make reflections to be a family (still with the roots as keys) instead of a dictionary

- Add an "inverse" feature to finite families (at least those without duplicates) returning the family with the keys and values exchanged.

Then, you would do W.reflections().inverse_family() instead of W.reflections(keys=reflections). This would solve the problem at hand, be of general usefulness, and not clutter the Weyl group interface.

Thanks in advance!

Best,
           Nicolas

An alternative term would be *module*.

I have revised the patch taking into account Nicolas' suggestion that  reflections be a family, and that finite families should have inverse  families as a method.

I did not revise the change lattice -> space pending further discussion of the matter. As I said in my last message, it seems that 
it might sometimes be a misnomer but still an improvement over calling the method "lattice".

Hi Dan,

I had a quick look at your patch. It looks good but I'm not sure I'll find time to formally review it so if someone else wants to formally review it please go. I just want to mention a small problem which forbid it to go into sage: there is no examples or doctests for `inverse_family`. Moreover I think that `has_key`  probably deserve a negative (i.e. returning `False`) examples.

Sorry for not having the time to do it...
