The attached patch uses Sphinx to produce docstrings from the command line.  The docstrings are still plain text, but among other things, all double colons should be turned into single colons.  The patch also (by hand) changes <code>\`\`text\`\`</code> to `"text"`, which I think looks better and conveys the same information.

It also no longer replaces `\\` with `\\\\` for docstrings in the notebook, since there is a line in sphinxify that just undoes this.

This depends on #8160.

I think the idea is good, but this needs work; I'm getting some doctest failures with this patch:

```
The following tests failed:

	sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/structure/element.pyx # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx # 6 doctests failed

	sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/structure/dynamic_class.py # 1 doctests failed
```
I'll try to work on them, and anyone else who is interested can do the same.

This looks good.  I noticed an existing problem with Unicode docstrings.  With #8051 and with or without #8167,

```python
sage: sagenb.notebook.worksheet.Worksheet.name?
sage: sagenb.misc.misc.unicode_str?
```
have `'<no docstring>'`.  V2 should fix this.

<div id="comment:6" align="right">comment:6</div>

On further reflection, I've decided that replacing <code>\`\`</code> with `"` is a bad idea.  It's complicated, and it can make some docstrings less clear.  For example, should <code>\`\`"text"\`\`</code> be turned into `"text"` or `"'text'"`?  What about <code>\`\`algorithm="gap"\`\`</code>: turn it into `"algorithm='gap'"`?  What about (from sage.interfaces.sage0.Sage) the beautiful <code>\`\`s('"x"')\`\`</code>?

If we eventually decide this is a good idea, we can do it in another ticket (or submit it as a possible customization for text output in Sphinx), but I'm taking it out for now.

A few doctests in sage and sagenb need to be changed as a consequence; see the new patches.
