Consider the following setting:

```
sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
sage: Q1 = P.quo([(x^2+1)^2*(x^2-3)])
sage: Q2 = P.quo([(x^2+1)^2*(x^5+3)])
```

The gcd of the moduli is `(x<sup>2+1)</sup>2`, and so it should be true that the pushout of Q1 and Q2 is the quotient ring with this gcd as modulus. Currently, the pushout raises an error, but with #8800 one has:

```
sage: from sage.categories.pushout import pushout
sage: Q = pushout(Q1,Q2); Q
Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in xbar over Rational Field with modulus x^4 + 2*x^2 + 1
```

However, there remain two bugs that are not covered in #8800 and that prevent a proper coercion of Q1 and Q2.

First bug:

```
sage: Q.has_coerce_map_from(Q1)
False
sage: Q.has_coerce_map_from(Q2)
False
```

Second bug:

```
sage: Q(Q1.gen())
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (932, 0))

ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input

I think I found one source of the problem. The call method (that will become an element_constructor method) says:

```
        if isinstance(x, PolynomialQuotientRingElement):
            P = x.parent()
            if P is self:
                return x
            elif P == self:
                return PolynomialQuotientRingElement(self, self.__ring(x.lift()), check=False)
```

In other words: *Only* if the parent of x is equal to self, it is attempted to convert x into self via conversion in the polynomial ring. I think this condition should simply be dropped.

Furthermore, after the above code block

```
        return PolynomialQuotientRingElement(self, self.__ring(x) , check=True)
```
Hence, it is again tried to interprete x in the polynomial ring of self. But the problem is that the variable names in self and in `self.__ring` are usually different. So, conversion of strings must fail.

<a id='comment:4'>Comment 4:</a>
OK, I have a ticket. I worked on top of my patches for #8807 and #8800, but *if* this new patch applies then it should be stand-alone (simply try).

What does it provide?

1. Polynomial quotient rings had a call method instead of an _element_constructor_. My patch provides one.

2. Previously, a coercion between polynomial quotient rings was not used, even though it clearly should exist when the modulus of the codomain divides the modulus of the domain. This is now solved, by adding a `_coerce_map_from_` method.

3. The old call method relied on the variable names of the underlying polynomial ring, when processing a string. That's obviously wrong, because the variable names of the *quotient* ring may be different.

4. String evaluation is possible even when one has a polynomial quotient ring over a polynomial ring (example below). This is possible by using `GenDictWithBasering`, which I had originally introduced for infinite polynomial rings.

**__Examples__**

Conversion between two quotient rings (coercion exists only in one direction):

```
sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
sage: Q1 = P.quo([(x^2+1)^2*(x^2-3)])
sage: Q2 = P.quo([(x^2+1)^2])
sage: Q2(Q1.gen())
xbar
sage: Q1(Q2.gen())
xbar
sage: Q1.has_coerce_map_from(Q2)
False
sage: Q2.has_coerce_map_from(Q1)
True
```

Here the underlying polynomial ring has a basering that by itself is a polynomial ring:

```
sage: R.<y> = P[]
sage: Q3 = R.quo([(y^2+1)]); Q3
Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in ybar over Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field with modulus y^2 + 1
sage: Q3(Q1.gen())  # this uses the lift into the underlying polynomial ring
x
```

String evaluation works (if you think about it, this is non-trivial, since it involves generator names of both Q3 and R):

```
sage: Q3('x*ybar^2')
-x
```

Now, back to the example from the ticket description. If #8807 and #8800 are used as well, one obtains:

```
sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
sage: Q1 = P.quo([(x^2+1)^2*(x^2-3)])
sage: Q2 = P.quo([(x^2+1)^2*(x^5+3)])
sage: Q1.gen()^2*Q2.gen()^2 + 2*Q1.gen()^2 + 1
0
sage: (Q1.gen()^2*Q2.gen()^2 + 2*Q1.gen()^2 + 1).parent()
Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in xbar over Rational Field with modulus x^4 + 2*x^2 + 1
```

I just realise that I forgot to provide a doc test for _coerce_map_from_. I will post it in a few minutes, and then it's ready for review!

Apparently, all but the last problem mentioned in the ticket description have already been fixed in other tickets. Namely, with vanilla sage-5.0.beta7, one has

```
sage: P.<x> = QQ[]

```

Also, the `__call__` method of quotient rings has already been replaced by an `_element_constructor_`, as it should.

So, I wouldn't say that the patch needs to be rebased: It has to be rewritten,  or better, it needs to be reduced to those parts that are responsible for making a quotient ring understand the string representation of its generators.

That bug also exists in sage-4.6.2, but apparently it has not been present when I wrote the old patch.

Anyway, I think that bug could be fixed here, I see no need to open yet another ticket.

<a id='comment:9'>Comment 9:</a>
The reason for my complaint about `y.divides(y)` is that the following example from a comment above would not work with the patch that I am now preparing:

```
sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
sage: Q1 = P.quo([(x^2+1)^2*(x^2-3)])
sage: R.<y> = P[]
sage: Q3 = R.quo([(y^2+1)]); Q3
Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in ybar over Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field with modulus y^2 + 1
sage: Q3(Q1.gen())  # uses the lift from Q1 to P, which is the base ring of Q3
x
```

The problem is that the coercion framework is not able to find out whether `Q3` has a coerce map from `Q1`.

So, I guess I should add a "try-except" clause in `Q3._coerce_map_from_`, so that an error in division is caught and results in the answer "no, there is no coerce map".

<a id='comment:10'>Comment 10:</a>
I have produced a new patch.

Recall that most problems mentioned in the ticket description have already been solved in sage-5.0.beta7. The only remaining was conversion from strings.

Here, I suggest to use a tool that I have introduced in my code for infinite polynomial rings: It is a generalisation of the gens_dict of polynomial rings. In contrast to gens_dict, it not only considers the generator names of the ring, but it also considers (recursively) the generator names of the base ring. This recursive version of gens_dict is then passed to sage_eval.

Hence, if Q has generator 'xbar' and is the quotient ring of some polynomial ring P with generator 'x', then `Q('x*xbar')` will be correctly evaluated as `P.gen()*Q.gen()`, which in turn evaluates as `Q(P.gen())*Q.gen()`.

Concerning the problem with `y.divides(...)`: The problem can arise, if Q1 and Q2 are two polynomial quotient rings and one asks `Q1.has_coerce_map_from(Q2)`. It will try to divide the moduli of Q1 and Q2. My suggestion is: If that division fails with an error, then there is no coerce map.

After these changes, the tests in sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_quotient_ring.py and .../polynomial_quotient_ring_element.py pass.

Let's see if the patchbot finds a reason to complain...

I'd like to make that work as well, and then add a test for the correct parent.

Funny. The code was an attempt to convert into the cover ring. But it says

```
        try: 
            return sage_eval(x, GenDictWithBasering(self,self.gens_dict())) 
        except TypeError, NameError:

        except TypeError:

```
In the third line, the `NameError` raised by sage_eval is not caught, because I forgot brackets. Arrgh.
