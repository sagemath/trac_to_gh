The adaptive refinement code in tri_plot.py has almost no docstrings or tests.  However, there are a lot of helpful comments in the code, and the file is not very long, so it should be pretty easy to bring this up to 100% coverage.

The patch formally gets coverage of tri_plot.py from 0 to 100%.  Since I still don't completely understand this module, the tests and descriptions could be better but this is an improvement.

The documentation is OK by me. I have just one trivial patch to add, which requires another pair of eyes other than mine. So if that reviewer patch gets a positive review, the whole ticket is good to go.



When the module `plot/plot3d/tri_plot.py` is added to the reference manual, building the reference manual with that newly added module would result in some warnings. But fixing that is another ticket.
