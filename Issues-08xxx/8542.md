Both patches, for pynac and Sage, look good to me.

Building the new pynac package fails with the following error:

```

Do we have a python package that uses `-fPIC`?

It works! I'll put your changes on the latest spkg included in sage (including the patch for #8753), merge some other fixes (#8651, maybe #8775), bump the version to 2.0 and make a new package.
