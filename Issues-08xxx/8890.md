```
sage: B = CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ, ['a','b'])
sage: B.an_element().map_support(lambda i: i)
2*B['a'] + 2*B['b']
sage: B.zero()
2*B['a'] + 2*B['b']
```

Looking at the code exposes the problem:

```
        res = self.parent()(0)
        z_elt = {}
        for m,c in self.monomial_coefficients().iteritems():
            z_elt[f(m)] = c
        res._monomial_coefficients = z_elt
        return res
```

We should not change the dictionary of zero!

The patch fixes this by rewriting the code in a generic way; this fixes by the way another bug when the function f is not injective, and moves the code to ModulesWithBasis. It also deprecates map_term, map_mc in favor of map_item, and also moves _repr_ to ModulesWithBasis to enable subcategories to override it.

Depends on #8881
