The patch looks good (I'll run doctests once my update is done) but we usually do not implement `__iadd__` and `__imul__` since objects in Sage are generally supposed to be immutable. There are some exceptions like matrices where this wouldn't make any sense.

Patch updated. I removed the inplace versions `__iadd__` and `__imul__`.

Apply only the last patch.
