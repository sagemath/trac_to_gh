This package was building 64-bit before, so it's not entirely clear this is 100% necessary. But I agree it is desirable. It should make it more reliable. 

But it is echoing 'Mac Intel' which is incorrect.

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.3.1$ file local/lib/libgpg-error*
local/lib/libgpg-error.a:	current ar archive, not a dynamic executable or shared object
local/lib/libgpg-error.la:	commands text
local/lib/libgpg-error.so:	ELF 64-bit LSB dynamic lib AMD64 Version 1, dynamically linked, not stripped

```

Libraries are building 64-bit, so positive review. 

It's probably worth showing the output of the 'file' command, to show the libraries, or executables are building 64-bit. I must admit I've rarely if ever done that, but it will show that the problem is fixed, as not all packages are building properly, even with the -m64 flag added.
