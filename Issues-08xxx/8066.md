This package was building 64-bit before, so it's not entirely clear this is 100% necessary. But I agree it is desirable. It should make it more reliable. 

But it is echoing 'Mac Intel' which is incorrect.

It would have been wiser to overwrite the patch file in this case I think. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.3.1$ file local/lib/libgpg-error*
local/lib/libgpg-error.a:	current ar archive, not a dynamic executable or shared object
local/lib/libgpg-error.la:	commands text
local/lib/libgpg-error.so:	ELF 64-bit LSB dynamic lib AMD64 Version 1, dynamically linked, not stripped
local/lib/libgpg-error.so.0:	ELF 64-bit LSB dynamic lib AMD64 Version 1, dynamically linked, not stripped
local/lib/libgpg-error.so.0.4.0:	ELF 64-bit LSB dynamic lib AMD64 Version 1, dynamically linked, not stripped
```

Libraries are building 64-bit, so positive review. 

It's probably worth showing the output of the 'file' command, to show the libraries, or executables are building 64-bit. I must admit I've rarely if ever done that, but it will show that the problem is fixed, as not all packages are building properly, even with the -m64 flag added.
