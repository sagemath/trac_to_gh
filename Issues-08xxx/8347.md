Hi Paul,

This is a question of design. As Nicolas Thiery and Jean Michel got a look on the two first propositions, they ask me to do the third one. You can just look the two first and confirm the disign was not the better... But if you want to test, just test the last one which seems to be the better solution (No error and just True/Flase answering...).

So, just review the third patch.

Thanks for all.

I've reviewed the 3rd patch.

I noticed a few typos: `dependant` should be `dependent`, `embendding` should be
`embedding`.

Also I don't understand why `long time` since the tests are fast.

Finally a test is missing with a `None` result (apparently the last test should return None
instead of False).

Small documentation suggestion:

- First state what the function does mathematically
- Then give the algorithm, and mention that the result is guaranteed to be correct, and that this is achieved by increasing the approximation order until the decision can be taken. It would be nice to include a complexity result (given the order of a root, and the size of the rational coefficient, one should be able to give an upper bound on the required approximation order)

Thanks for your useful work on this!
