Here comes a third version which say True if an algebraic complex number is a real positive and False otherwise. (Another suggest from another people....)

Feel free to give some advises about :
- the name of this method
- the test (usable not only in Coxeter Group theory)
- the way to implement this
- ....

Hi Paul,

This is a question of design. As Nicolas Thiery and Jean Michel got a look on the two first propositions, they ask me to do the third one. You can just look the two first and confirm the disign was not the better... But if you want to test, just test the last one which seems to be the better solution (No error and just True/Flase answering...).

So, just review the third patch.

Thanks for all.

I've reviewed the 3rd patch.

I noticed a few typos: `dependant` should be `dependent`, `embendding` should be
`embedding`.

Also I don't understand why `long time` since the tests are fast.

Finally a test is missing with a `None` result (apparently the last test should return None
instead of False).

It would be nice to include a complexity result (given the order of a root, and the size of the rational coefficient, one should be able to give an upper bound on the required approximation order)
