This ticket is about at least three bugs related with inversion of elements of power series rings.

Here is the first:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[[]]
sage: (1/x).parent()
Laurent Series Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: (x/x).parent()
Power Series Ring in x over Integer Ring
```
*Both* parents are wrong. Usually, the parent of ``a/b`` is the fraction field of the parent of ``a,b``, even if ``a==b``. And neither above parent is a field.

Next bug:

```
sage: (1/(2*x)).parent()
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (919, 0))

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
... very long traceback
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```

And the third:

```
sage: F = FractionField(R)
sage: 1/x in F
False
```

With the proposed patch, we solve all bugs except

```
sage: (x/x).parent()
Power Series Ring in x over Integer Ring
```

OK, here is a patch.

Idea: 

* Introduce a fraction_field method to power series rings that returns the Laurent series ring over the fraction field of the base ring. I hope that the base_extend method for Laurent polynomials works stably enough, otherwise it should be rewritten.
* In the division method of power serise, construct the fraction field of the parent, move numerator and denominator into the fraction field, and divide there. The original form of the method is preserved as a fail safe.

With the patch, I get:

```
sage: P.<t> = ZZ[]
sage: R.<x> = P[[]]
sage: FractionField(R)
Laurent Series Ring in x over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Integer Ring
```

O dear. I just realise that there will be more work. There is a segmentation fault, as follows:

```
sage: R1.<x> = ZZ[[]]
sage: F = FractionField(R1)
sage: F
Laurent Series Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: F(x)
x
sage: ~F(x)
/home/king/SAGE/sage-4.3.1/local/bin/sage-sage: line 206:  4437 Segmentation fault      sage-ipython "$@" -i
```

So, the division of elements of a Laurent series ring fails with a segmentation fault. By consequence, division of power series segfaults as well, with the patch. "Needs work", I presume.

Strangely, without the patch, the construction works:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[[]]
sage: F = LaurentSeriesRing(FractionField(R.base()),R.variable_names())
sage: 1/F(x)
x^-1
```

The patch does this construction as well -- but segfaults. There seems to be a nasty side effect.

OK, I replaced the old patch, and now it seems to work!

For example:

```
sage: P.<t> = ZZ[]
sage: R.<x> = P[[]]
sage: 1/(t*x)
1/t*x^-1
sage: (1/x).parent() is FractionField(R)
True
sage: Frac(R)
Laurent Series Ring in x over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Integer Ring
```

The doc tests for the two modified files pass. So, ready for review!

You are right, timing should be taken into account, and this is something my patch doesn't provide. Without the patch:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[[]]
sage: timeit('a=1/(1+x)')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.08 ms per loop
```
With the patch

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[[]]
sage: timeit('a=1/(1+x)')
125 loops, best of 3: 6 ms per loop
```
So, it is slower by more than a factor five.

One more thing: The old code is quick if the result actually belongs to the power series ring, which is quite often the case; if this is not the case then often an error results. And I guess the parent should always be the fraction field, eventually.

What I just tested (but I really should get some sleep now...) is to cache the fraction_field method, and to *try* to use the old code if the valuation of the denominator is not bigger than the valuation of the numerator; if this fails, then put numerator and denominator into the fraction field, and try again.

Doing so brings the above timing to about 2ms, which is still a loss of factor two, but two is less than 5 or 6. I'll submit another patch after trying to lift the dependency of the two div methods on each other.

The second patch does several things:

1. It turned out that in several places it is assumed that the quotient of two power series is a power series, not a Laurent series. I tried to take care of this.

2. I improved the timings, so that (according to the timings below) the performance is competitive (sometimes clearly better, sometimes very little worse) then the original performance.

The reason why the old timings were good was some kind of lazyness: The result of a division was not in the fraction field (as it should be!), but in a simpler ring, so that subsequent computations became easier. On the other hand, transformation into a Laurent polynomial was quite expensive, since there *always* was a transformation into the Laurent Series Ring's underlying Power Series Ring -- even if the given data already belong to it.

Solution (as usual): Add an optional argument "check" to the init method of Laurent Series.

And then I tried to benefit from keeping the results as simple as possible (like the old code did), but in a more proper way. Let ``f`` be a Laurent series in a Laurent series ring ``L``. In the old code, one always had ``L.power_series_ring() is f.valuation_zero_part().parent()``. I suggest to relax this condition: It is sufficient to have a coercion:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[[]]
sage: f = 1/(1+2*x)
sage: f.parent()
Laurent Series Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: f.parent().power_series_ring()
Power Series Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: f.power_series().parent()
Power Series Ring in x over Integer Ring
```

**__Timings__**

Without the two patches:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[[]]

sage: timeit('a=(1+x)/x')

```

With the two patches:

```

sage: timeit('a=1/x')
625 loops, best of 3: 220 µs per loop
sage: timeit('a=(1+x)/x')

625 loops, best of 3: 1.25 ms per loop

625 loops, best of 3: 1.26 ms per loop
sage: y = (3*x+2)/(1+x)
sage: y=y/x

625 loops, best of 3: 191 µs per loop
sage: timeit('y/z')
25 loops, best of 3: 9.35 ms per loop
```

So, my patches not only fix some bugs, but they also slightly improve the performance.

I tested all files that I have changed, but I can not exclude errors in other files.

I forgot to insert my name as an author, but presumably there will be a revision needed anyway, after comments of referees...

I forgot one remark:

I don't know how this happens, but the ``truncate`` method of Laurent series behaves different than before, although the ``truncate`` method of power series did not change:

```
sage: A.<t> = QQ[[]]
sage: f = (1+t)^100
sage: f.truncate(5)
3921225*t^4 + 161700*t^3 + 4950*t^2 + 100*t + 1
sage: f.truncate(5).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
sage: g = 1/f
sage: g.truncate(5)
1 - 100*t + 5050*t^2 - 171700*t^3 + 4421275*t^4 + O(t^5)
sage: g.truncate(5).parent()
Laurent Series Ring in t over Rational Field
```

In other words, ``g.truncate(5)`` is now returning a Laurent series, but without the patch it used to return return a univariate polynomial, similar to ``f.truncate(5)``.

I don't know if this is acceptable, and also I don't understand how that happened. Shall I change it?

Outch, now I see my mistake.

* The documentation of ``LaurentSeries.truncate`` states that indeed it returns a Laurent series. It does not have a doc test, so, I will add one.

* The old doc test of ``PowerSeries.truncate`` fails with my patch. The reason is that the *power* series constructed in this doc test is now in fact a *Laurent* series; this is what made me believe that the behaviour of the method has changed. So, I only have to change the doc test.

But before submitting a patch to add/correct these doc tests, I'll wait for input of a referee.

So, over QQ, there is a slight regression (both with exact and inexact input). Over ZZ, it only works with my patch, even for a polynomial that is quadratic by definition.

I will have a closer look at sqrt - perhaps I'll find something.

It seems so. 

First, the reason why the old version failed for a power series over ZZ is the fact that the invert method raises an error if the result has coefficients in QQ rather than ZZ. I guess this must change.

Second, there is a division inside the sqrt method. By my patch, this division returns a Laurent series, which slows things slightly down. If I do ``a*s.__invert__()`` instead of ``a/s`` then the timings are as good as with the old code.

So, there will soon be a third patch...

It was worth it!

First, I found one division bug for Laurent series left, which is now fixed (and doc tested):

```
sage: L.<x> = LaurentSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: 1/(2+x)
1/2 - 1/4*x + 1/8*x^2 - 1/16*x^3 + 1/32*x^4 - 1/64*x^5 + 1/128*x^6 - 1/256*x^7 + 1/512*x^8 - 1/1024*x^9 + 1/2048*x^10 - 1/4096*x^11 + 1/8192*x^12 - 1/16384*x^13 + 1/32768*x^14 - 1/65536*x^15 + 1/131072*x^16 - 1/262144*x^17 + 1/524288*x^18 - 1/1048576*x^19 + O(x^20)
```
This used to result in an error.

Second, I added more doc tests (and inserted my name to the author list).

Third, the new timings for sqrt are fully competitive (even very slightly faster than before), and we still have the bug fix:

```
Loading Sage library. Current Mercurial branch is: powerseries
sage: P.<t> = QQ[[]]
sage: p = 9 - 33*t - 13*t^2 - 155*t^3 - 429*t^4 - 137*t^5 + 170*t^6 + 81*t^7 - 132*t^8 + 179*t^9 + O(t^10)
sage: p.sqrt()
3 - 11/2*t - 173/24*t^2 - 5623/144*t^3 - 174815/1152*t^4 - 8187925/20736*t^5 - 12112939/9216*t^6 - 7942852751/1492992*t^7 - 1570233970141/71663616*t^8 - 12900142229635/143327232*t^9 + O(t^10)
sage: timeit('q = p.sqrt()')
25 loops, best of 3: 13.2 ms per loop
sage: timeit('q = (p^2).sqrt()')
25 loops, best of 3: 13.5 ms per loop
sage: timeit('q = (p^4).sqrt()')
25 loops, best of 3: 14.5 ms per loop
sage: PZ = ZZ[['t']]
sage: timeit('q = (PZ(p)^2).sqrt()')
25 loops, best of 3: 16.4 ms per loop
sage: p = 9 - 33*t - 13*t^2 - 155*t^3 - 429*t^4 - 137*t^5 + 170*t^6 + 81*t^7 - 132*t^8 + 179*t^9
sage: timeit('q = p.sqrt()')
25 loops, best of 3: 20.6 ms per loop
sage: timeit('q = (p^2).sqrt()')
25 loops, best of 3: 21.7 ms per loop
```

The trick is that I do ``s*a.__invert__()`` instead of ``s/a``, where ``s`` and ``a`` are power series. This helps, because (after a little change) the invert method returns a power series whenever possible -- and since I know that ``a.valuation()>=0``, I can use fast multiplication of power series rather than slow multiplication of Laurent series.

OK, the last (hopefully the last...) patch fixes this. I was verifying the timings for basic arithmetic (the timings without patches are posted above), and here is the positive result:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[[]]
sage: timeit('a=1/x')

sage: timeit('a=(1+x)/x')
625 loops, best of 3: 228 µs per loop

625 loops, best of 3: 1.22 ms per loop
sage: timeit('a=(1+x)/(1-x)')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.24 ms per loop
sage: y = (3*x+2)/(1+x)
sage: y=y/x
sage: z = (x+x^2+1)/(1+x^4+2*x^3+4*x)
sage: z=y/x

Hi Mike!

That probably means that the elliptic curves code expects the result of a division of two power series to be another power series. But now, the division yields a Laurent series.

I see two possibilities to proceed:

1. Search for all occurences of power series in Sage, see if a division occurs, and change it so that things still work.
2. Change/extend the methods provided by Laurent series so that they match those provided by power series. In that way, the code in schemes/elliptic_curves still has a chance to work.

I'll see what I can do.

Best regards,
Simon

After fixing what I mentioned above, I get for `sage -testall`:

```
The following tests failed:


        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/crypto/lfsr.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/modular/modform/find_generators.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_padic_field.py"
```

This seems doable.

Perhaps I was too strict when I implemented `_div_`: I wanted that the result *always* lives in the fraction field, and I wanted that an error is raised if no fraction field exists. But I guess it is better to proceed as it is known from other rings that are no integral domains:

```
sage: K = ZZ.quo(15)
sage: parent(K(3)/K(4))
Ring of integers modulo 15
sage: parent(K(4)/K(3))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ZeroDivisionError: Inverse does not exist.
```

So, rule:

1. *If* a fraction field exists then the result of a division must live in it (example: 1/1 is a rational, not an integer).
2. If no fraction field exists, then devision shall yield an element of the original ring, if that's possible, and raise a `ZeroDivisionError` otherwise.

Attachment [8972_elliptic_doctest_fix.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket8972/8972_elliptic_doctest_fix.patch) by @simon-king-jena created at 2010-06-07 18:55:23

I think the problems are now solved. With the last patch, that is to be applied after all others, `sage -testall` works without errors (at least in version sage-4.4.2).

**__Changes introduced by the patch__**

* In some cases, if the code expects a power series, I replaced `a/b` for power series `a,b` by `a*~b`. Namely, the latter returns a power series (not a Laurent series), if possible. 

* I added a method `exp` for Laurent series, that returns the exponential if the Laurent series happens to be a power series.

* With my previous patches, the underlying data of a Laurent series is not necessarily a power series. Therefore `add_bigoh` (similarly `_rmul_` and `_lmul_`) did in some cases not work. This is now fixed and doctested.

* Some Power Series Rings still returned a *formal* fraction field. This is now fixed, they return a Laurent series ring.

* If `a,b` are elements of a power series ring `R`, the rule is now:

  1. If `R` is an integral domain, then `a/b` always belongs to `Frac(R)`. This is similar to `1/1` being rational, not integer.

  2. If `R` is no integral domain, then `a/b` is an element of `R` or of the Laurent series ring over the base ring of `R`, if `b` is invertible. This is similar to division in `ZZ.quo(15)`.

  3. If possible, `~b` is a power series (possibly over the fraction field of the base of `R`). So, we always have `~b==1/b`, but the parents may be different. I hope this is acceptable.

* A change in the default `_div_` method of `RingElement`: Previously, the default for `a._div_(b)` was to return `a.parent().fraction_field()(a,b)`. But this may be a problem (e.g., if the fraction field is not a formal fraction field but a Laurent series ring). Therefore, if the old default results in an error, `a.parent().fraction_field(a)/a.parent().fraction_field(b)` is tried.

**__Timings__**

Robert was worried about potential slowdowns in the Monsky-Washnitzer code. It seems to me that my patches actually provide a considerably speedup.

Without my patches:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage-powerseries/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/monsky_washnitzer.py"
         [3.9 s]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 3.9 seconds
```

With my patches:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage-powerseries/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/monsky_washnitzer.py"
         [2.3 s]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 2.3 seconds
```

So, the code seems to become faster by more than 33%!

Ready for review again...

I upgraded to sage-4.4.3.

I verified that all patches still apply.

With the patches, `sage -testall` passes.

On sage-devel, Robert asked how stable my Monsky-Washnitzer timing is. Here is the answer:

Without the patches, I was running `sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/monsky_washnitzer.py"` 5 times, and got
 
  7.9 s, 2.4 s, 2.4 s, 2.4 s, 2.4 s

With the patches, I obtain

  2.4 s, 2.5 s, 2.4 s, 2.4 s, 2.4 s

So, the timing did not improve, except for the first run. But at least there was no slowdown.

Accidentally, I found that this ticket is rotting.

Recall that it used to be "fixed", but then it was reopened by mhansen, since there was a problem in sage-4.4.alpha0. Subsequently, I fixed these problems, but still the resolution is set to "fixed".

I guess this is why nobody took care of the ticket afterwards.

I don't know if the patch would still apply (probably not), but at least I verified that the original problem did not disappear.

For simplicity, I produced a patch that combines all previous patches and is rebased to sage-4.6.2.alpha4.

I will now try to take care about the failing doc tests.

```

So, in some cases the patch brings a big speedup (such as 38.4 µs versus 167 µs), in other cases it brings a mild slowdown (such as 962 µs versus 791 µs)

Obvious question to the referee: Should I try to squeeze even more µs out of it, or can it stay as it is (assuming that the long tests pass, as I will try now).

I have rebased the patch. The test suite needs to be run, but the patch should now apply to sage-5.0.beta10. Here is some supporting evidence:

**__First section: The bugs to be fixed__**

*sage-5.0.beta10-gcc without the patch*

```

I think, given that various bugs are fixed, and I think the timings tend to be better (not in all examples, but it seems to me that the loss is less than the gain), I guess it is "needs review", modulo doc test suite.

Arrgh. That's nasty. The reason for the doctest problems is that meanwhile there are multivariate power series rings -- but there are still no multivariate Laurent series rings.

Spontaneously, I suggest a temporary work-around: In the case of multivariate case, the old behaviour (namely: using a formal fraction field) should be used, until multivariate Laurent series are available.

I have a question about the description of this issue. Please forgive that I'm no algebraist.

```
sage: (1/(2*x)).parent()
...
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```
Isn't this correct, with the ring over ZZ? With QQ there is no error.

If so, the description should be corrected.

There are a few details that still fixing:

This seems strange:

```
:doc:`laurent_series_ring_element`.
```
Wouldn't it be better to be a specific reference to the class? Although I am not sure it is worth the direct reference.

This is wrong:

```
        If we try a non-zero, non-unit leading coefficient, we end up in the in
        the fraction field, i.e. Laurent series ring::
```
Even for units, you still end up in the fraction field.
