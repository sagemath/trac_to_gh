Overall this is very nice.  I have two questions.

1. If I do type(u) (for instance), I just get 'instance' as the type, whereas for something like t._maxima_() I get type giving a Maxima interface element or something.  Is there any way to make type(u) give something more useful (perhaps inheriting from another class?  I don't know.).

2. Tab-completion works great, and just like as with other Maxima things (which means getting functions which don't actually apply, such as triangularize, but whatever, since it's the same behavior).
