Attached patch provides a `.maxima_methods()` function in symbolic expressions to give access to various methods of simplification, etc. available in Maxima. The return values of functions called through this interface are Sage expressions. Tab completion and docstrings work as expected.

Overall this is very nice.  I have two questions.

1. If I do type(u) (for instance), I just get 'instance' as the type, whereas for something like t._maxima_() I get type giving a Maxima interface element or something.  Is there any way to make type(u) give something more useful (perhaps inheriting from another class?  I don't know.).

2.
