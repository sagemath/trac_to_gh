Clicking on the left of a cell output in the notebook used to cycle wrapped-unwrapped-hidden for text output and typeset-LaTeX_code-hidden for typeset output.

After upgrade to 4.3.3 in the second case I get typeset-typeset-hidden cycle.

The previous behaviour is very convenient for inserting a bunch of expressions generated by some cycle into papers.

We made the change at #3083.  I think I did this for the sake of new Sage users, who might evaluate `sage.algebras.steenrod_algebra?` (via shift-enter), when the cell is in the "unwrapped" mode.

Just in case: You can also double-click on typeset output to see the source.

This is not the same. Double-click shows a gray window with the source of ONE typeset output and if you have used several show(...) in one cell (or in a cycle), you need to do if for each of them separately.
