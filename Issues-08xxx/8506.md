Hi robert, 

The problem is not only for homset ! See #8119

```
sage: h = Hom(ZZ, QQ)
sage: hash(h)
-8106914618552251573
sage: h.rename("toto")
sage: hash(h)
2314052222105390764
```
I don't know exactly what would be a generic solution of this problem. There is one if the parent inherits from `UniqueRepresentation` (see ##8120) instead of using one of the at least three other mechanisms I've seen troughout sage library. Not that as I said in that ticket, I'm not sure how robust my solution is I've a proposal for a better option. If you have any comment, please do not hesitate.

Cheers,

Florent
