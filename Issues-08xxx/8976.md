This is easy to fix, but I'm not sure if one should simply replace

```
n = x.parent()(1)
```
by

```
n = parent(x)(1)
```
or e.g. test for `isinstance(x,(int,long,float))` instead.

Btw, wouldn't it be convenient to have `squarefree_prime_divisors()` (i.e. a generator/list of just those prime factors with exponent=1), too?

(Currently, there's only `squarefree_divisors()`.)
