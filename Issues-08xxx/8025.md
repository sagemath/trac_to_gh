Definitely "sage -upgrade" doesn't work right now (from 4.3 to 4.3.1).  
Definitely doing

```
  sage -f spkg/standard/scipy_sandbox-20071020.p4.spkg
  sage -f spkg/standard/scipy-0.7.p3.spkg
```
fixes the problem.  But I'm confused since scipy and scipy_sandbox depend on fortran, so they should be forced to be rebuilt anyways.  Hmm..

More precisely, the following fixes the problem:

```
./sage -f numpy-1.3.0.p2.spkg scipy_sandbox-20071020.p4.spkg scipy-0.7.p3.spkg
```
