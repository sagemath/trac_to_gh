Definitely "sage -upgrade" doesn't work right now (from 4.3 to 4.3.1).  
Definitely doing

```
  sage -f spkg/standard/scipy_sandbox-20071020.p4.spkg
  sage -f spkg/standard/scipy-0.7.p3.spkg
```
fixes the problem.  But I'm confused since scipy and scipy_sandbox depend on fortran, so they should be forced to be rebuilt anyways.  Hmm..
