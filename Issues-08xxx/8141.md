<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
The main purpose of the patch is to use the SASS font stack mixins in `sagenb/sass/src/partials/_mixins.sass` throughout the notebook stylesheets.

I've replaced the original sans-serif stack

```
"Gill Sans", "Gill Sans MT", "Myriad Pro", Myriad, "Liberation Sans", "Nimbus Sans L", Tahoma, Geneva, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif
```
with

```
'Arial', 'Helvetica', sans-serif
```
in an attempt to reproduce the pre-#7786 fonts.  But I don't have a strong opinion on what we should use.  Feel free to use other sets!
