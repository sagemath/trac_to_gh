Using the properties of LLL and a height bound, we can prove (given sufficient precision) that an integer relation of bounded height either doesn't exist or is unique. This is needed, e.g.,  for provable computations of Heegner points though could be useful elsewhere as well. It is also faster.

Looks good, applies to 4.3.5 (with a small amount of fuzz).  Tests in sage/rings all pass.  Docs build and look good.  I did some random testing of my own and the results seem fine.

Small question:  why does algdep? not display the docstring?  algdep?? works fine though.
