```
sage: f = Family(Zmod(3), lambda i: 2*i, lazy=False)
sage: f
Lazy family (<lambda>(i))_{i in Ring of integers modulo 3}
```

Should we really just silently ignore the intent here, or should

`Family(S, f, lazy=False)` always return `Family([i for i in S], f)`

(I guess the default for lazy should then be made 'None' so that 'True',
'False' and 'None' could all have different behaviors.)
