The Singular team accepted most of our patches upstream. They are in the 3-1-0-9 release, which also is a first step to make things easier for library developers.

How to apply the patches to [sage-4.5.3.alpha0](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.5.3.alpha0/sage-4.5.3.alpha0.tar):

* Install the new Singular spkg: [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/8059/singular-3-1-1-4.p0.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/8059/singular-3-1-1-4.p0.spkg)
* Apply [singular-3-1-1-4.2.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/8059/singular-3-1-1-4.2.patch) to `devel/sage`

**CC:**  PolyBoRi drkirkby @aghitza @jaapspies @kiwifb @alexanderdreyer

**Author:** Martin Albrecht

**Reviewer:** David Kirkby, Simon King, William Stein, John Palmieri

**Upstream:** Reported upstream. Little or no feedback.

Here's the new SPKG:

   http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/singular-3-1-0-9-20100125.spkg

You also need to apply the patch I am going to upload in a second.

* CCing Dave so we can make sure there is no regression w.r.t. Solaris etc. 
* CCing PolyBoRi so Michael can take a look at my changes (he knows the code base)
* CCing Alex since he reviewed Singular SPKGs before :)

**Doctests on sage.math**:

The only failure is in gen.pyx. I don't see how this can be caused by my changes.

I'm testing this on a couple of machines and will report.

I have two questions about the spkg:

1. Should we remove dist/, see #5903 ?
2. In src/, should we remove doc/ and emacs/ ?  It's really just a question of making the spkg smaller by about 10%, since AFAIK these won't get used from Sage.  We routinely do this with other spkgs.

I'm happy to do this and post a new spkg, but I wanted to see what Martin thought about it.

Yes, that sounds reasonable.

I just checked and it still builds with these two directories removed. 

Thus, I've updated the SPKG accordingly. Same place, same name.

I did not have any time to test it.
But most changes introduce passing the ring explicitly to Singular.
This avoid current ring problems (which can be quite annoying and hard to debug).

nlGetNumerator seems a new addition in Singular (maybe, a special wish of Martin?).

But they are also okay as napoly is just a typedef for polyrec*.
So, from reading Malbs code, it looks good.
Still someone needs to test it and check it for Sages formal criteria

Unless I am looking at the wrong SPKG, you forgot to take `dist/` out of version control:

```
[ghitza@cartan singular-3-1-0-9-20100125]$ hg status
! dist/debian/changelog
! dist/debian/compat
! dist/debian/control
! dist/debian/control.in
! dist/debian/copyright
! dist/debian/libsingular-dev.install

! dist/debian/patches/change-library-search-path.patch
! dist/debian/patches/sage-bugfixes.patch
! dist/debian/patches/series
! dist/debian/rules
! dist/debian/singular.install
```

Apart from this, I'm happy.

There used to be a `naIter` function which is gone in 3-1-0-9 and Singular internally uses `pNext()` as well. Thus I feel my casting is justified :)

Maybe it will install a some FLAGS are set globally (-m64) in this case).

As Open Solaris is not a supported platform I'll not interfere with the positive review.

Did the previous Singular spkg build properly on Open Solaris?  If so, I wonder if it's just a problem in spkg-install, or a more serious issue with Singular itself.

Actually this is the same failure I had before.

What is the use of -gp in building singular for sage?

If I remove -gp in Makefile and Makefile.in all, over singular builds on
Open Solaris x64 64 bit

I think it need upstream work. In the former release it was in patches.
Now it is in source :(

Removing -gp will not break anything in sage. We do no profiling!

Looking at Jaap's error again it comes from omalloc. For omalloc all targets are built which are
* libomalloc (normal)
* libomalloc_ndebug (no debugging symbols)
* libomalloc_p (for profiling)

We shouldn't mess with the `-pg` switch but should convince omalloc's autotools not to build the profiling version on top of the other two.

I would also add I think adding profiling information by default is a bad idea. 
 
* Adding profiling information will slow the code quite considerably.
* The -pg option is not portable, so it would hamper efforts to build with a non-GNU compiler.
* The purposely add an option which is breaking a build on Open Solaris, when an Open Solaris port is in progress, seems a bad idea. 
* As Jaap points out, only developers want this information - not end users. 

I would be tempted to set it to 'needs work', but feel I can't really do so, since Open Solaris is not supported on Sage. So the fact an option breaks on an unsupported operating system is not a sufficiently good reason for rejecting it. But I would urge the person that created the ticket, or the reviewer to do so. (BTW, the Reviewer field is not filled in).

Guys,

no one wants to add -pg to the default options for Singular and no one did! Most Singular libraries are built in several flavours as explained above but not all of them are used of course. It's the build of an unused library that is going wrong.

There is a discussion on this issue on [libsingular-devel]:

  http://groups.google.com/group/libsingular-devel/browse_thread/thread/43d157fe730e8798

where Hans Schönemann suggested to patch omalloc. It is still puzzling why the build breaks now since IIRC nothing changed in that area.

If there are a lot of Makefiles, then patching would be tedious and require more work with upgrades. However, it should not be too hard to create a small script which patches the Makefiles and call that script from spkg-install. 

I've not checked this on the Singular sources, but this sed script, which I called 'nopg' could be used to replace ' -pg ' with nothing

```
#!/bin/sh 
sed 's/ -pg //g' $1 > /tmp/Makefile-without-pg-option.$$
mv /tmp/Makefile-without-pg-option.$$  $1
```

then in spkg-install have:

```
find src -name Makefile -exec /path/to/nopg {} \;
```

I tried it on a gcc source distribution, which has loads of 'configure' scripts, replacing 'echo' with 'zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz' and sure enough, all the configure script have strings of zzzzz's in them. 


It would be necessary to check the files have the required changes, and no other changes, but that should be a simple solution.

After fixing a typo in a Singular routine

I get a bit further, but I need some help now:

I assume '32' is wrong in the failure below?

```python
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/schemes/plane_curves/constructor.py"

Got:
    32
```


Am I correct that the following is also wrong?

```python
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/schemes/plane_curves/curve.py"
   ? ideal defines not a curve
   ? leaving normal.lib::genus
**********************************************************************

Martin, I just tried the new spkg but I'm running into trouble very quickly: after doing `sage -f ...`, I'm getting errors when doing `sage -b`

This is under sage-4.3.4.alpha0, and I got it now on two machines (including sage.math)

Reply from upstream:

```
This is not a bug, Singular computes only the genus
of a curve, as is said in the manual:

genus(i) or genus(i,1); I a 1-dimensional ideal

In the example the ideal defines a surface.

Dear Martin,

I realize that the example was a homogeneous
polynomial in 3 variables. So, this can be interpreted
as an affine surface but also as a homogeneous curve.

Probably the second was meant. In this case it makes
sense to compute the genus. We shall take care
about this in the next release.

Hi Martin Albrecht , 
A few comments. 

* Is it possible you could request the upstream developers distribute the source code so the files generated by tools like autoconf, flex, actually have later modification times of the generated file newer than the file they are generated from? 

Currently libparse.cc, which is the output from 'flex' has exactly the same modification time (to the ns) as the file it was supposedly generated from (libparse.l). I doubt 'flex' actually run in < 1 ns!

```
-rw-r-----   1 drkirkby staff     109422 2010-02-03 13:58:03.000000000 +0000 src/Singular/libparse.cc
-rw-r-----   1 drkirkby staff      30875 2010-02-03 13:58:03.000000000 +0000 src/Singular/libparse.l
```
Likewise for these files. Clearly autoconf did not run in under a ns. 

```
-rwxr-x---   1 drkirkby staff      85614 2010-03-03 11:36:23.000000000 +0000 src/factory/configure
-rw-r-----   1 drkirkby staff      13992 2010-03-03 11:36:23.000000000 +0000 src/factory/configure.in
```

This will save us having to 'touch' the files. 

* There's a problem with the `build()` part of spkg-install. 

The script author probably assumes that if any one of the items in `build()` fail, then `build()` will fail and so the error will be reported. However, that is not the case. As long as the last item in `build()`, which is (`install_docs`), does not fail, the return code from `build()` will be 0. So if for example I modify the `build()` section to:

```
build()
{
    clean_headers
    # This SHOULD break the build
    rm /non-existant-file

    patch

    distclean

    config 

    build_singular

    build_libsingular
 
    build_factory

    build_libfac

    create_singular_script

    install_docs
}

build

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error somewhere building Singular."
    exit 1
fi

```

then when I build Singular, I see:

```
Building a 64-bit version of Singular
rm: /non-existant-file: No such file or directory
make: *** No rule to make target `distclean'.  Stop.
creating cache ./config.cache
checking uname for singular... ix86-SunOS
checking for gcc... gcc -m64
...
Successfully installed singular-3-1-1-3.p1
```

In other words, the error of trying to delete  /non-existant-file does not cause the build to fail, as it should do. That means if the library fails to build, but the docuemtation installs ok, then the script will not show the error. Each part should be checked individually. 

I've not checked this, but believe the following would work:

```
build()
{
   for i in clean_headers patch distclean config build_singular build_libsingular build_factory build_libfac create_singular_script install_docs ; do
   $i
   if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
     echo "Error building Singular when running '$i'."
     exit 1
   fi
   done
}
```

* There are in fact a lot of parts in spkg-install which are not checked for errors. 

* François Bissey has said the previous version of Singular built some unnecessary targets, which adds to the build time of Singular. Given this is the longest package to build (taking almost 6 minutes on my PC), it would be worth reducing them if you have not already done so. I've cc'ed François on the ticket, as he knows a lot more about this package than me. 

* It does built on OpenSolaris, though I've not checked it on anything else. I'll wait until you have sorted out the segfaults first!

PS, The first 3-1-1-3 to go into Sage should be called singular-3-1-1-3.spkg and not have a '.p0' in the name. 

Dave

Thanks for adding me Dave I will update my patch to simplify slightly
the build to this version of singular. I know from experience in sage-on-gentoo
that sage will build and the tests will be ok if you remove the build_factory
and build_libfac targets. 
As a bonus the creation of the link LIB to lib is 1) bogus 2) useless.
In a build of singular LIB usually contains the the *.lib files. Those files
are installed in share/singular thanks to some of the instructions in the build.
Before being removed and recreated the link actually points to share/singular.
Removing the link didn't harm any tests.

The only issue with removing these 2 targets may be the optional Macaulay2
spkg. We have some discussions atm in gentoo about singular - the components
it provides - and Macaulay2. So while sage builds ok, Macaulay2 should be checked.

Hi Martin, 

do you see this warning message about `warning: returning reference to temporary`? I got that warnings when building on OpenSolaris - see below. 

```
g++ -m64 -O2 -g -m64 -fPIC -pipe -fno-implicit-templates -I. -I../kernel -I/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.5.alpha4/local/include -I/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.5.alpha4/local/include -I/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.5.alpha4/local/include -O2 -g -m64 -DNDEBUG -DOM_NDEBUG -Dix86_SunOS -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -c iparith.cc

                 from iparith.cc:20:

../kernel/int64vec.h: In member function 'const int& int64vec::operator[](int) const':
../kernel/int64vec.h:51: warning: returning reference to temporary
```

That sounds the sort of error which could result in segfaults. 

I'm attaching a patch which gives much improved error checking.

Dave

It would be good if this Macaulay2 could be made to rebuild Singular in this case. Perhaps have an environment variable that determines if those two targets are built or not. 

```
build() 
{
    patch
    distclean
    config 
    build_singular
    build_libsingular
    if [ "x$SAGE_USING_Macaulay2" = xyes  ] ; then  
       build_factory
       build_libfac
    fi
    create_singular_script
    install_docs
} 
```
Then ensure Macaulay2 

* exports SAGE_USING_Macaulay2 = "yes"
* Rebuilds Singular. This time build_factory & build_libfac would built, due to the environment variable being set to "yes"

I guess this depends on the popularity of Macaulay2. If 20% of people install it, then we might as well build all targets. If however only 1% of people install Macaulay2, then I doubt it warrants slowing the build process for everyone. 

Currently I believe Singular is the slowest package to build in Sage (at least on my OpenSolaris machine), though neither R or Maxima are building, so I can't say for sure. But Singular definately takes a long time to build, so if that could be improved, it would be nice. Of course, it depends on how long those targets take to build. If the savings from not building them are only small, we might as well build them. 

Another option might be to let an environment variable be used to stop those two targets building, but by default build them all.

To build both singular and Macaulay2 our current approach
is too try to build omalloc factory and libfac first, and then move on to the 
rest of singular/Macaulay2. That approach makes sense in the context of Gentoo.
If it works I may try to adapt the singular spkg build process to match it.

It is not a done deal that this approach will work however.

I can't tell you that for sure - you would need to test it. However, the fact it has used 67 minutes of CPU time, but took 37 minutes to build, suggests the parallel build is working. I doubt any overhead could explain that difference. 

That should be quite useful, as Singular is probably in the top 3 of packages taking the longest to build. In fact, it might have the !#1 spot. So it's worth making Singular work in parallel, whereas for some packages, it's hardly worth the bother.

There are a bunch of .cvsignore files all over:

I will give this a positive review if:

- build testing passes on everything

Hey, I'm wrong -- you got *rid* of the .cvsignores!

This gets a positive so long as it builds on stuff.

This currently has positive review, and I'm listed as the reviewer, though I have not given it positive review.

From what I see above, the only evidence of this working on Solaris is that the package builds. It's not clear Sage can even build on Solaris with this.

Sorry, I had been working on different things. 

On t2, I have applied the patch to sage 4.5.1 and installed the singular-3-1-1-4.spkg. Then, I did `make ptestlong`. Result:

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_fiel
d.py # File not found
        sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_curve_isogeny
.py # File not found
        sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/modular/ssmod/ssmod.py # File not found
```

This seems a bit strange to me.

First, why can the files not be found?

Second, why is it not mentioned in the summary that some tests in fact timed out? Namely:

```
sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! PROCESS KILLED! *** ***
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! *** ***
         [1801.8 s]

*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! PROCESS KILLED! *** ***
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! *** ***
         [1800.9 s]
```

Since I am not experienced with t2, I don't know if this doctest result is good or bad.

I'v'e just edited 

```

```

the file I recommend people source, and added to it:

```
SAGE_TIMEOUT=1000 
export SAGE_TIMEOUT
SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG=6000
export SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG
```

I've found on my own 900 MHz SPARC that the default SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG (1800 s) is **just** about long enough, but the SAGE_TIMEOUT (360 s) is too far too short. I'm not even sure if 1000 seconds for SAGE_TIMEOUT is enough on t2, but it probably is. 

Obviously one can unset those variables if one wants, but it would seem sensible to have the defaults so tests should pass.

Again, the setting is: Sage 4.5.1 plus singular-3-1-1-4.patch plus singular-3-1-1-4.spkg. `sage -ptestlong` on t2 with `export SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG=6000` results in exactly one doctest failure:

So, not enough space. Does that mean the hard disc (or at least `/scratch` or my home directory) is too full?

Anyway, I repeated the failing test separately, and then it succeeded:

```
sage subshell$ sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py"
         [48.8 s]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 48.8 seconds
```

So, can one say that all tests pass on t2?


Looking at the previous posts, it seems that the status is:

- "builds and passes all tests with sage-4.5" on sage.math (William)
- "All tests pass on bsd.math" (Martin)
- "Amazingly, this fully works on Cygwin!!" (William)
- With a little effort (extending timeout and running one test separately) all tests of sage-4.5.1+patch+spkg pass on t2.
- "the patch doesn't apply cleanly to Sage 4.5.2.alpha0" (John).

Do you agree that this is a positive review **once the patch is rebased**, and that William, John and myself should be added to the list of referees?

Cheers,

Simon

I don't think that much co-ordination is needed here. Apparently this ticket is more important than #9599, and #9599 will certainly not happen without the patch from  here. 

So, I'll simply wait until a rebased version of singular-3-1-1-4.patch is available, and will then base on it a new version of my patch from #1396 for re-merging -- which then needs to be tested for segfault on t2, of course.

With #1396 backed out, this applies, so it doesn't need to be rebased.  (One hunk applies "with fuzz".)  The commit message doesn't include the trac number, but that's the only problem.

So should it get a positive review now?

There might still be a problem with parallel builds.  With 4.5.2 on sage.math, I applied [attachment:singular-3-1-1-4.2.patch], copied [singular-3-1-1-4.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/singular-3-1-1-4.spkg) to `SAGE_ROOT`, and ran

```sh
#!/bin/bash

set -o pipefail

JOBS=20
RUNS=50
for I in `seq $RUNS`;
do
    LOG="singular-3-1-1-4-j$JOBS.log.$I"
    if [ ! -f "$LOG" ]; then
        env MAKE="make -j$JOBS" ./sage -f singular-3-1-1-4.spkg 2>&1 | tee "$LOG"
        CODE=$?
        echo $0 run $I of $RUNS: code= $CODE
    fi
done
```
All runs ended with exit code 0 (maybe I didn't retrieve the code correctly?), but

```sh
grep "An error occurred" singular-3-1-1-4*log* | sort -n
```
shows that 21 of the 50 runs failed.

I've put the logs [here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/8059/).

According to

```sh
$ grep "No such file or dir" sing*log* | grep -v "cannot remove" | cut -d ':' -f 2- | sort | uniq -c
      1 abs_fac.cc:2:21: error: factory.h: No such file or directory

Please see `singular-3-1-1-4-j20.log.47` for the `factory.h` errors.

If I didn't make a mistake:  What if we return to serial builds for this ticket but open a new one for building Singular in parallel?

That looks a very trivial change. If I understand correctly, just one line

```
$(basefactorysrc:.cc=.o):      factory.h
```

is added. But it might be better to put it on another ticket, otherwise this could drag on for ages - the ticket is already 7-months old. 

Singular is one of the slowest packages build for me on my Ultra 27, taking about 8 minutes if I recall correctly. But I'm concerned that delaying this much longer will cause more problems than a few minutes of wall time will make. 

BTW, I've run with 1000 threads on systems with only 4 cores. It's not optimal, but does allow a reasonable simulation of larger parallel builds to be made. 

A big problem in my opinion, is that the server disk.math, which serves all the home directories has been mis-configured to increase the speed of NFS. So failures on home directories might not be code errors, but simply mis-configuration of the server.

I don't know what method they use to create the tarball, but its hard to see how this can happen. Unless they touch all files before releasing, it's hard to understand how they can created a configure script with the same timestamp as the file it is generated from. 

Perhaps they copy them with `cp` at one point, and don't preserve modification times (`cp -p`). Whatever it is they are doing, it is wrong.

Anything that should be touched should be.

No comment. 


BTW, is this really 3-1-1-4, or is it a snapshot? If the latter, then it's quite possible someone in the Sage community created the configure script and did not preserve modification times. In which case, the upstream developers are not to blame.

These files **can** be generated, but there is no need to do so (if you are not a Singular-kernel developer). In fact they are pre-generated in the repo:
http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/svn/trunk/
(That's why the time stamps are equal.)

The reason for this is that the generators for these files (e.g. **specific** version of autotools and lex) are not available on all supported platforms.

Of course, there are attempts to change this, but this cannot be done within 2,5 days. If (and only if) the tools of Sage distribution are capable of generating these files, then the correct solution would be to to remove them complete during patching.

IIRC, I got a message that it would try to generate the files using my autoconf, which is an older version, but it might not work. That's very dangerous. 

Also, this means if the tools exist, the file get generated needlessly, slowing the build. 

But it will not take 2.5 days to touch them in the spkg-install file.

And exactly **that** can (and did) cause problems; the distributed generated files should be
* **newer** than their sources,
* up-to-date.

See http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9160#comment:22 (and http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9160#comment:20 for the latter issue, or the whole ticket...) and also [this thread on sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/fbf5b7f781c3f523#).

Unfortunately we hadn't had the time to add more comments on this to `SPKG.txt`, but I expected the people further working on the Singular spkg to be aware of these issues, or take a look at previous tickets related to the spkg. (And I didn't edit the SD 23.5 wiki page, because at that time it didn't seem appropriate, but asked for other people propagating these things.)

Obviously unfortunately not, see above. I expected it to be one.

Well, the spkg maintainer (and some of the people involved in this ticket here) actually participated the discussion on sage-devel (which referred to #9160).

(And I remember the spkg maintainer telling me *"You don't need to cc anybody, we'll look through the tickets anyway..."* ;-) )

That's why I had been a bit annoyed or disappointed, and the reason for the flame.

No reason to flam the upstream developers. In particular, as the ticket stated, that it had not been reported to them.
