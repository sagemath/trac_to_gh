Hi Jason,

Nice patch.

1.  Do you think this should be called "free_module_element_callable_symbolic_dense"?  Technically these don't have to be vectors, and they do have entries over a ring?  Yes, that's an unwieldy name.  ;-)  Just asking.

2.  Do you want to add it into the documentation, doesn't seem to be included when I build the docs?

3.  Docstring for `_latex_` looks like it has an indentation problem that needs fixing.

Running tests right now.

Rob

Well, Sage thinks that it is a field:

```

sage: f(x,y)=x^2+y                             
sage: R=f.parent()
sage: R 
Callable function ring with arguments (x, y)
sage: R.is_field()
True
```

Looks like (2) and (3) both probably need to be fixed.

And I trusted the `_repr_` output?

Failing a few tests, in the obvious way, in 

```
/sage/dev/devel/sage-main/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx
/sage/dev/devel/sage-main/sage/calculus/calculus.py
```

(and not done testing).

On 4.4.2.rc0 I get the following failures.  The one for R is totally unrelated I believe, the others I saw are just the obvious differences in format for functions involved in this patch.

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx # 4 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/calculus/calculus.py # 2 doctests failed
