As discussed on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/t/5d9c32390ffe3c96) it could be good to have an "Unkown" value in sage which semantic is a truth value. Here are the intended truth table:

```
      and             or
    F  U  T         F  U  T
 F [F, F, F]     F [F, U, T]
 U [F, U, U]     U [U, U, T]
 T [F, U, T]     T [T, T, T]
```
Unfortunately, without [PEP 335](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0335/), there is no way to achieve this with python's "and" and "or".
