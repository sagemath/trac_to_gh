This patch defines the (very short) function is_overfull (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfull_graph), and updates the edge_coloring function to support it. 

I also fixed a mistake in this code : I had mixed g.order() with max(g.degree()) for complete graphs ^^;

This is a prerequisite for #9230.

1. #8166

For the patch [trac_8781.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8781/trac_8781.patch.gz), I'm OK with the part dealing with defining the new method `is_overfull()`. I have attached reviewer patch that adds some more doctests to that method, fixes some formatting styles, and adds a comment about optimizing that method for speed. 



Now to the part I don't like about [trac_8781.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8781/trac_8781.patch.gz). It's the part of that patch that deals with the module `sage/graphs/graph_coloring.py`. While testing that part of ncohen's patch, I came across this failure:

```sh
sage: from sage.graphs.graph_coloring import edge_coloring
sage: g = graphs.ClawGraph()
sage: edge_coloring(g, value_only=True)

This also came up even though I had installed the optional GLPK spkg. One possibility here is to split off the part of the patch that deals with edge coloring and put that part in another ticket. That ticket could also be about resolving the failure I reported above. Other possibility is to resolve the above failure in the current ticket.

Oops.... That's totally unrelated, and is caused by the recent upgrade of NetworkX. The default graphs from NetworkX (of which ClawGraph() is an example) now have {} instead of None as default edge labels... And as {} is not hashable, Sage does not like to find it as part of a dictionary key ;-)

There was already a patch waiting for review to fix it, which is #8892, but I had forgotten this file and only fixed generic_graph and graph... Well, I updated that patch, which is now a dependency of this very one, and fixes the bug you found.

Thank you very much Minh, and sorry again for that :-)

It's ok for me !! I thought for a time it also needed to be rebased, but I has just forgotten to apply my patch before yours ;-)

I noticed an error in the docstrings though... so positive review to your patch, and this ticket is still waiting for review because of mine.

and by the way... It's a bit odd that I did not notice this problem before, and I'm afraid tis may come from the fact I used CPLEX as a default solver before, while only GLPK is installed on my current copy of Sage O_o

Your fix is OK by me. However, note that it requires GLPK or CBC. (I have only tested with those two spkg's.) Without any of those packages installed, I got the following failure:

```
So I have made the doctest optional. And as I said before: Anyone for a final review of the whole ticket? :-) See the ticket description for instructions on how to apply patches.
