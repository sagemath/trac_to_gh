This was fixed when we improved our recognition of Maxima's unsigned infinity.

```
sage: sage: limit(f(x), x = pi/4, dir='minus')           
+Infinity
sage: sage: limit(f(x), x = pi/4, dir='plus')            
-Infinity
sage: sage:limit(f(x), x = pi/4) 
Infinity
```
So I guess this can be closed?  Or should we whip up a patch to document this...?

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

positive review (I've checked that all doctests still pass).

A small comment: maybe the documentation could say more explicitly that the output `Infinity`
indicates a complex infinity, whereas `+Infinity` means plus infinity.

By the way, there is a problem since Sage parses `Infinity` as `+Infinity`:

```
sage: Infinity
+Infinity
sage: Infinity == +Infinity
True
sage: a=limit(1/x, x=0)
sage: a == +Infinity
True
```
but this could be in a different ticket.
