A call to `matrix` does not change the sparsity:

```
    sage: mat = matrix(ZZ, [[1,1],[1,1]], sparse=False)
    sage: type(mat)
    <type 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense'>
    sage: mat2 = matrix(ZZ, mat, sparse=True)
    sage: type(mat2)
    <type 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense'>
```

Component: **linear algebra**

Keywords: **sparse matrix conversion**
