In some cases, for example when an enumerated list is ill formated, in text mode ouput sphinx returns silently an empty string. It should at least raise some warning. See #8572 for an instance of the problem.
At this point, I don't know if it's a bug of sphinx or the way we call it.

There is a very good chance that this is a bug of sphinx. I asked it on
sphinx-dev. I'm waiting for their answer.

For the info, here is a ReST file that triggers the problem:

```
**************************
List Bug Triggering Module
**************************

    - list item 1 -- this item is correctly formated. So that there should be
      no problem with it..

    - list item 2 -- this item is ill formated. Sphinx should raise a warning
       when typesetting in in text mode.
```

I'm not sure what to do now with this ticket... Should we back port the bugfix or wait for the next release ? Should this ticket be left open ?

I would think wait for the next release, as that is (maybe) much easier than backporting. If you can backport, then by all means do so. Until the issue is fixed by upgrading to the new release with the bug fixed, or backporting, this ticket would remain open.

According to Georg Brandl, Sphinx should make a new bugfix release "soon"... So I'm in favor of waiting for it.
