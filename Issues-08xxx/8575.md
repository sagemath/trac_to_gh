In some cases, for example when an enumerated list is ill formated, in text mode ouput sphinx returns silently an empty string. It should at least raise some warning. See #8572 for an instance of the problem.
At this point, I don't know if it's a bug of sphinx or the way we call it.

There is a very good chance that this is a bug of sphinx. I asked it on
sphinx-dev. I'm waiting for their answer.

For the info, here is a ReST file that triggers the problem:

```
**************************
List Bug Triggering Module
**************************

    - list item 1 -- this item is correctly formated. So that there should be
      no problem with it..

    - list item 2 -- this item is ill formated. Sphinx should raise a warning
       when typesetting in in text mode.
```

I'm not sure what to do now with this ticket... Should we back port the bugfix or wait for the next release ? Should this ticket be left open ?
