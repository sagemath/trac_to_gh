For the Givaro and the NTL implementations, one can use modulus='random' but not for the Pari implementation.
Moreover, according to the documentation in finite_field.py, modulus must be a polynomial, but in fact it can also be a string.

There's one doctest that needs modifying after this patch is applied:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/structure/factory.pyx"            
**********************************************************************
File "/Users/mafwc/sage-4.3.2/devel/sage/sage/structure/factory.pyx", line 234:
    sage: key, _ = GF.create_key_and_extra_args(27, 'k'); key
Expected:
    (27, ('k',), None, None, '{}')
Got:
    (27, ('k',), 'conway', None, '{}')
**********************************************************************
```
Otherwise it seems fine.
