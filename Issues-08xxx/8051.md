I don't understand why the spkg is not managed by Mercurial:

```
[mvngu@mod sagenb-0.7.2]$ hg st
abort: There is no Mercurial repository here (.hg not found)!
```
The file `spkg-install` should have its executable bits on:

```
[mvngu@mod sagenb-0.7.2]$ ls -g spkg-install
-rw-r--r-- 1 mvngu 348 2010-01-30 16:37 spkg-install
```
And `SPKG.txt` is very sketchy about update details.

I suggest

* Checking that the package installs and the notebook runs.
* Checking the repo for unchecked-in changes, queued patches, etc.
* Checking that the claimed merged tickets appear in `hg log`.
* Running the doctests: `sage -t -sagenb`.

Ideally, you should run the SageNB Selenium tests, too.  But they require special extra setup.  I'll make simplifying that setup a separate ticket.

Thanks for pointing out the link error.  I've updated it.

The repository is in `sagenb-0.7.2/src/sagenb`.  We auto-generate the package with `sagenb-0.7.2/src/sagenb/spkg-dist`.

I suggest that I make a separate ticket to update SPKG.txt.

See #7784 about

```
$ hg stat

The release deadline for Sage 4.3.2 is Saturday 06th February 2010, which means there's not much time for sorting out failures when building the PDF version of the reference manual.

We install the sagenb package with [setuptools](http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools) ([PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)), which updates `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python/site-packages/easy-install.pth`.  This file contains paths prepended to `sys.path` on startup.

You can query the installed version with

```python
sage: from sagenb.misc.misc import SAGENB_VERSION
sage: SAGENB_VERSION
```
which is essentially

```python
sage: from pkg_resources import Requirement, working_set
sage: w = working_set.find(Requirement.parse('sagenb'))
sage: w.version
```
Moreover, `w.location` gives the install directory.

I'm checking the fonts now...
