All tickets got positive review and have been merged. So what should be reviewed in this ticket?

I installed the spkg, seems to work fine (but I did not test everything), is this enough to give positive review?

I don't understand why the spkg is not managed by Mercurial:

```
[mvngu@mod sagenb-0.7.2]$ hg st
abort: There is no Mercurial repository here (.hg not found)!
```
The file `spkg-install` should have its executable bits on:

```
[mvngu@mod sagenb-0.7.2]$ ls -g spkg-install
-rw-r--r-- 1 mvngu 348 2010-01-30 16:37 spkg-install
```
And `SPKG.txt` is very sketchy about update details.

I suggest

* Checking that the package installs and the notebook runs.
* Checking the repo for unchecked-in changes, queued patches, etc.
* Checking that the claimed merged tickets appear in `hg log`.
* Running the doctests: `sage -t -sagenb`.

Ideally, you should run the SageNB Selenium tests, too.  But they require special extra setup.  I'll make simplifying that setup a separate ticket.

The release deadline for Sage 4.3.2 is Saturday 06th February 2010, which means there's not much time for sorting out failures when building the PDF version of the reference manual. I think [sagenb-0.7.3.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/8051/sagenb-0.7.3.spkg) needs to wait for after Sage 4.3.2 is done.

We install the sagenb package with [setuptools](http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools) ([PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)), which updates `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python/site-packages/easy-install.pth`.  This file contains paths prepended to `sys.path` on startup.

You can query the installed version with

```python
sage: from sagenb.misc.misc import SAGENB_VERSION
sage: SAGENB_VERSION
```
which is essentially

```python
sage: from pkg_resources import Requirement, working_set
sage: w = working_set.find(Requirement.parse('sagenb'))
sage: w.version
```
Moreover, `w.location` gives the install directory.

I'm checking the fonts now...

It turns out that I merged #4217, not #3154, into SageNB 0.7.  I didn't notice that #4217's commit string was copied from #3154 by mistake.  I used `hg log` to make the list of merged tickets in the description.
