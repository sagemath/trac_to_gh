I don't understand why the spkg is not managed by Mercurial:

```
[mvngu@mod sagenb-0.7.2]$ hg st
abort: There is no Mercurial repository here (.hg not found)!
```
The file `spkg-install` should have its executable bits on:

```
[mvngu@mod sagenb-0.7.2]$ ls -g spkg-install
-rw-r--r-- 1 mvngu 348 2010-01-30 16:37 spkg-install
```
And `SPKG.txt` is very sketchy about update details.

I suggest

* Checking that the package installs and the notebook runs.
* Checking the repo for unchecked-in changes, queued patches, etc.
* Checking that the claimed merged tickets appear in `hg log`.
* Running the doctests: `sage -t -sagenb`.

Ideally, you should run the SageNB Selenium tests, too.  But they require special extra setup.  I'll make simplifying that setup a separate ticket.

Thanks for pointing out the link error.  I've updated it.

The repository is in `sagenb-0.7.2/src/sagenb`.  We auto-generate the package with `sagenb-0.7.2/src/sagenb/spkg-dist`.

I suggest that I make a separate ticket to update SPKG.txt.

We install the sagenb package with [setuptools](http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools) ([PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)), which updates `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python/site-packages/easy-install.pth`.  This file contains paths prepended to `sys.path` on startup.

You can query the installed version with

```python
sage: from sagenb.misc.misc import SAGENB_VERSION
sage: SAGENB_VERSION
```
which is essentially

```python
sage: from pkg_resources import Requirement, working_set
sage: w = working_set.find(Requirement.parse('sagenb'))
sage: w.version
```
Moreover, `w.location` gives the install directory.

I'm checking the fonts now...
