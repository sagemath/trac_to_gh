Currently computing faces of a non-full-dimensional lattice polytopes causes and exception, because when I was implementing support for such polytopes I missed a parameter in one place. The attached little patch fixes it and adds a doctest for the future.

I'm pretty sure you need the double colon in 

```
line 545:"     Check that Trac 8934 is fixed::"
```
or the example will not be typeset correctly.

A special case of non-full-dimensional polytopes is the zero-dimensional case. This one is also broken, but in a slightly different way:

```
sage: p = LatticePolytope(matrix([[0]]))
sage: p.poly_x("i", reduce_dimension=True)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

   2226 
   2227     def skeleton(self):

    772         if self.dim() == 0:
    773             raise ValueError, ("Cannot run \"%s\" for the zero-dimensional "
--> 774                 + "polytope!\nPolytope: %s") % (command, self)
    775         if self.dim() < self.ambient_dim() and not reduce_dimension:
    776             raise ValueError(("Cannot run PALP for a %d-dimensional polytope " +

ValueError: Cannot run "poly.x -fi" for the zero-dimensional polytope!

```
Also, `p.points()` fails for the same reason. It would be great if you could fix this case as well.
