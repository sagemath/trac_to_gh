Python manuals says:

    There are no implied relationships among the comparison operators. The truth of x==y does not imply that x!=y is false. Accordingly, when defining __eq__(), one should also define __ne__() so that the operators will behave as expected.

UniqueRepresentation fails to comply with this. As a consequence:

```
sage: G6 = GL(6, QQ)
sage: G6 == G6
True
sage: G6 != G6
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: Matrix group over Rational Field not implemented.
```

Actually that exactly how I caught it except that it was with _test_self_equal which is implemented in #8402. I think #8697 should be closed as a duplicate of #8402.

Yup! So there is particularly no point about forcing it explicitly, since it will be automatically the case later, and in the mean time there is no reason to fix something that ain't broken.
