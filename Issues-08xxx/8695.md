Python manuals says:

    There are no implied relationships among the comparison operators. The truth of x==y does not imply that x!=y is false. Accordingly, when defining `__eq__`(), one should also define `__ne__`() so that the operators will behave as expected.

UniqueRepresentation fails to comply with this. As a consequence:

```
sage: G6 = GL(6, QQ)
sage: G6 == G6
True
sage: G6 != G6
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: Matrix group over Rational Field not implemented.
```

Actually that exactly how I caught it except that it was with `_test_self_`equal which is implemented in #8402. I think #8697 should be closed as a duplicate of #8402.
