As stated in the documentation of Parent._an_element_, this method
need not be blazingly fast since an_element is cached anyway. Also,
having it implemented in Parent, rather than in the categories makes
it impossible for categories to override this default implementation
with something more meaningful. Therefore it would be best moved to
the ParentMethods of Sets().

This first patch is a step in that direction. It just makes
`_an_element_` a def method rather than a cpdef method. This little
change by itself causes the recompilation of a big part of Sage, which
makes it completely impractical to work on a patch containing it (or
in a patch queue containing it). So it would be nice to have this
patch merged in Sage 4.4, so that we can start working comfortably on
the moving of `_an_element_` once it has been merged in.
