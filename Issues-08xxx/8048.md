Maybe you should add a command to sage, e.g.,

  sage: _build_report()

or

  sage -buildreport

that runs a script, gathers relevant information, then submits it
somewhere.  The resulting submission could then be summarized on a web
page.   This is a perfect example of where it would be far, far better
to spend time writing some code than doing something manually.

Mathematica actually provides one called 

```
  SystemInformation[]
```
http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/SystemInformation.html

http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/guide/SystemInformation.html

It also provides information on the machine precision. A look at what they provide might be useful.

I would suggest we also include the value of exp(1.0), as that is system dependent, though care needs to be used in computing that so compilers don't inline the result. 

Some possible sources of information would be:

 == Solaris ==

* $ /usr/sbin/prtconf | grep Memory (gives you memory information)
* $ /usr/platform/`uname -i`/sbin/prtdiag (More hardware information)
* $ showrev (more information)
* $ /usr/sbin/psrinfo -v (gives you processor information)
* $ prstat (like top, but more accurate on Solaris)
* $ cat /etc/release (gives operating system information)
* $ uname -a (gives you the usual things)
* $ uptime (how long the system has been up, and load average)
* $ dmesg (system messages)
* $ df -h (gives you some information about disk usage)
 
The best way to find out if a Solaris system is running out of memory is to use the scan rate ('sr' column) of 'vmstat'. (Don't even think about believing top)

 == Linux ==

* $ uname -a
* $ cat /etc/issue
* $ cat /proc/cpuinfo
* $ cat /proc/meminfo

 == OS X ==
* $ uname -a
* $ /usr/sbin/system_profiler

I will take this and try to write it for linux and sunos. It should
1) Be capable of being called from within Sage after installation.
2) Be capable of being called from command line outside Sage assuming an installation failure. (Assuming python exists.)
3) Be capable of returning precision,etc information from within Sage.
4) Be scalable to a new OS.
 

Stay tuned.

There are several things to consider: * Pruning info from /etc is not safe. It is not standardized, subject to user modifications, subject to lack of updates between distros (Ubuntu -> Mint etc). But, when the info exists it can be useful. It can also be badly formatted... with \r and \n explicit in the file. I used some 'sed' commands to get around this a bit.

Questions I have: * Can you test it, break it?

* What looks useful? What doesn't? What looks left out? Why?
* How would something like this be used? I'm under the impression that this can get written to a log and the user can paste that log... where?

I'll post a link with sample output since it isn't formatting nicely in this forum wysiwyg editor.

I had a look at this and have a few comments. 
* Overall, I was very impressed. It has nice output. 
* I believe it should be released under "GPL 2, or at your option, any later version". 
* It would be useful to know if CPU throttling is enabled or not. This can cause problems building ATLAS for example. 
* I would see if `pwd`/local/bin/sage-banner exists, and if so grab the sage version from there.

* It would be useful to know if there is a server listening on port 8000 (default for Sage). I don't know how to do that though - I could find out on Solaris no doubt. 
* I would show the output of the following three commands:

```
drkirkby@hawk:~$ command -v gcc
/usr/local/gcc-4.4.4-multilib/bin/gcc
drkirkby@hawk:~$ command -v g++
/usr/local/gcc-4.4.4-multilib/bin/g++
drkirkby@hawk:~$ command -v gfortran
/usr/local/gcc-4.4.4-multilib/bin/gfortran
```

 ('command -v' is portable - the use of 'which' is not). This will allow us to see if the compilers are a mix of compilers from places like `/usr/bin` and `/usr/local/bin`.

 ```
 HW_RELEASE=$(cat /etc/lsb-release | sed -e "s/DISTRIB_/ /g" | tr -d '\r\n' | sed -e "s/^ //g" 2> /dev/null)
 ```
 could be changed to:

 ```
 HW_RELEASE=$(sed "s/DISTRIB_/ /g" /etc/lsb-release | tr -d '\r\n' | sed "s/^ //g" 2> /dev/null)
 ```
 (There is no need for the -e option to `sed` if there is only one command like here).  One could even combine the `sed` into one, but that gets more complex to write. Likewise

 fred
 hello
 jim
 ```
* Given the number of different linux systems, I wonder if it might not be better to simply print the contents of `/etc/lsb-release`, `/etc/release` or whatever else exists, rather than try to parse them to get a distribution from them. It might be safer. 
* The comment on line 148 (`# function to return memory info for linux`) is wrong. 
* Although it would take 1 second to run, I think the output of:

 ```
  vmstat 1 2
 ```
 could be useful, as it allows one to see more what is happening on a system at the point of failure. 

Overall, this looks very useful. I was quite impressed with it.

On two machines, both with processors described by `arch` as "ia64" (is that itanium?), there is no line "model name" in /proc/cpuinfo, so the corresponding line in the summary printed by the script ends up blank.  Otherwise, it seems to work well on all of the linux machines I tried.

On Mac OS X, I think a lot of the relevant information can be extracted by running the command `sysctl -a`.  See [http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/sysctl.8.html](http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/sysctl.8.html) and [http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/sysctl.3.html](http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/sysctl.3.html).

I attached a new file. I made the 'useless cat' and other changes. (Thanks Dave!)

Some more notes:

* cpu throttling: It is easy to determine if a cpu supports throttling, but can be a pain to determine (across various linux distributions) if it is enabled. Even from Ubuntu 9.10 to 10.04, this changed, and both are inconsistent with the Debian installations I've tried. So, I'm not incredibly optimistic here.
* Getting the sage banner isn't a problem, so long as I know my pwd and how that relates to the banner's location. I haven't yet assumed that this script is executed anywhere specific.
* I changed the gcc version command to output the entire output. The extra lines now included are only copyright info though, and so I'd question if we'd want them.
* I'll add the netstat command (and/or equivalent).
* diskspace is relatively easy. I'll add that as well.

It looks like the OS-X commands are somewhat straightforward, and the hardware is much more standardized there. Dave: We have a couple of lists of relevant Sunos commands... can we develop a single list of what is useful and what isn't? I have Open Solaris on a machine and so testing won't be an issue.

John:

You are welcome.

Even from Ubuntu 9.10 to 10.04, this changed, and both are inconsistent with the Debian installations I've tried. So, I'm not incredibly optimistic here.


You do not surprise me. I came to the same conclusion on Solaris too.

We should be able to get all the parameters that gcc was configured with

```
drkirkby@hawk:~$ gcc -v
Using built-in specs.
Target: i386-pc-solaris2.11
Configured with: /export/home/drkirkby/gcc-4.4.4/configure --prefix=/usr/local/gcc-4.4.4-multilib --enable-languages=c,c++,fortran --with-gmp=/usr/local/gcc-4.4.4-multilib --with-mpfr=/usr/local/gcc-4.4.4-multilib --disable-nls --enable-checking=release --enable-werror=no --enable-multilib --with-system-zlib --enable-bootstrap --with-gnu-as --with-as=/usr/local/binutils-2.20/bin/as --without-gnu-ld --with-ld=/usr/ccs/bin/ld
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.4.4 (GCC) 
```

that lot can be very useful to know.

OK.

How do you propose to get the disk space? I came to the conclusion that was quite difficult, and have not found a way.

Yes. It's late here. I will get onto that after some sleep.

It might be worth giving memconf a try, to see what it finds. I'm not suggesting including that, but it might confirm your guesses. 

If that's not the case, then it's buggy and there just aren't enough people using those cpus to make it worth fixing.

Thanks, I've done that.

memconf doesn't seem to be installed on the skynet machines, or at least I haven't found it.

On some systems it runs as a normal user process. It can be downloaded in a few seconds, change the permission to make it executable and you are ready to go. It does not need compiling- its just a perl script. 

On 't2' it needs root access. I have no idea on other systems. I think it would work on mark without root access.
