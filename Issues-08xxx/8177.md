Integer assumes the following invariant:

    x.parent() == ZZ     <==>    x.__class__ == Integer

Breaking this invariant (which is easy to do using plain Python) can lead to a segfault.

See the following discussion for how it was detected:

From [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/7754a347b837fad6) and also [reported here](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/7c920d26ddad3345):

```
> built fine on mac 10.6.2 but one failure for sage -testall :

> The following tests failed:

>        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/structure/element_wrapper.py" # Segfault

I get the same result on bsd.math (Mac OS X 10.6.2). Doing a verbose
long doctest, I get:

Trying:
    Integer(1) < l11###line 213:_sage_    >>> 1 < l11
Expecting:
    False

------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------ 
```

See #8200 which improves the doctests of ElementWrapper to not trigger this bug anymore. #8200 does not resolve the issue though!

Hi there !

I uploaded a patch where a replaced `ZZ` as a parent to `Sets().example("facade")` which is much closer to a meaningfull parent. It should hide the segfault problem which is actually a problem in Integer. However, I don't have access to a Max OS machine so please tell me if it doesn't work.

Cheers,

Florent

I strongly second Nicolas -1. 

Moreover, if the segfault is not removed the invariant 

```
    x.parent() == ZZ <==> x.class == Integer
```
must be clearly stated with a _big warning_ in the doc. My opinion is that the segfault must be left only if there is a very large performance penalty fixing it.
By the way is this invariant an equivalence ? As far as I understood the segfault only came because we where breaking the `==>` part. 

Cheers,

Florent

By the way, I've removed myself as author since I won't be hacking in integers (my work in integrated in #8200).

I looked at the code of Integer._rich_cmp, and indeed it now tests that the right hand side is indeed in the Integer class which fixes the issue.

In an ideal world, we would have added a regression test, but oh well, let's move on.
