As reported:

```
E = EllipticCurve(GF(3), [0,0,0,2,2])
E.random_element()
```
Hangs since

```
sage: E.rational_points()
[(0 : 1 : 0)]
```
so unless the point at infinity is picked (probability 1/(q+1)=1/4) no point will be found.

This can only happen for q=2,3,4 (try Hasse_bounds(q)) so these cases need separate treatment.

Patch coming up.
