I have started a discussion about this patch in sage-devel: http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/26d80fb37461ac19#

I think that accepting this enhancement should be deferred until that discussion is concluded.

I should have put the need work myself...

I opened it a long time ago but in fact, the main reason was try to play with the SearchForest feature. As I have no mathematical specific argument or idea, anyone would make a better work than my old proposition.

This is clearly free to assign. Thanks for your comments and the start of a discussion.
