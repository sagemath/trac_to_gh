There are a number of inefficiencies in the critical path (i.e., the code path when values have already been cached) that are addressed in this patch.

PS:
The latest patch does in fact much more: Both the critical and the non-critical path are improved, using various tricks.

Might it not be better for `@`cached_method to store its cache as an attribute of the instance object, rather than having a single cache which stores the values for all instances of that class?

E.g. the following code works for methods with no arguments:

```
def fast_cached_method(func):
    def fast_func(some_instance):
        try:
            return getattr(some_instance, '_cache_' + func.__name__)
        except AttributeError:
            result = func(some_instance)
            foo_instance.__dict__['_cache_' + func.__name__] = result
            return result
    return fast_func
```

I tested this and it's only about 1.5 times slower than doing the caching "by hand", while your speeded-up version above is still about 40 times slower.

Hi Jason,

Note also that your patch would break the cache in the case of default/named arguments. Namely, when you have a function `def f(n=3): return n^2` then the values of `f()`, `f(3)` and `f(n=3)` should be identical, but they aren't when you have a special case for `f()`.

The patch that I am now preparing is quite thorough, attacking several spots that created overhead. It can now nearly compete with manual caching. I am currently adding more doctests and hope that I will be able to provide a patch later today.

Best regards,

Simon

{
    "body": "<div id=\"comment:7\" align=\"right\">comment:7</div>\n\nReplying to [@loefflerd](#comment:4):\n> Might it not be better for `@`cached_method to store its cache as an attribute of the instance object, rather than having a single cache which stores the values for all instances of that class?\n\nIt was not the case that there was a single cache for all instances (the cache was in the instance for `cached_method` resp. in the parent of the instance for `cached_in_parent_method`). However, a part of the overhead came from the fact that the cached method *itself* has not been an attribute of the instance but of its class.\n\nI just attached a new patch that goes far beyond Jason's approach.\n\nThese examples show how the cached method performance is\nimproved by my patch:\n\n**__Using instance attributes__**\n\nPolynomial ideals have a cached method `groebner_basis`. Without\nmy patch, asking for `I.groebner_basis` would return a\n`CachedMethodCaller` - always a *new instance* whenever the cached\nmethod is requested. Of course, that's a waste of time. Therefore,\nI store the cached method caller as an attribute of the instance,\nwhich is done when the attribute is first requested:\n\n```\nsage: R.<x, y, z> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 3)\nsage: I = R*(x^3 + y^3 + z^3,x^4-y^4)\nsage: I.__dict__.has_key('groebner_basis')\nFalse\nsage: I.groebner_basis\nCached version of <function groebner_basis at 0x15a0668>\nsage: I.__dict__['groebner_basis']\nCached version of <function groebner_basis at 0x15a0668>\nsage: I.groebner_basis is I.groebner_basis # False without my patch\nTrue\n```\n\nThis already yields a considerable speedup. However, pickling posed\na problem: Since the cached method caller is in the instance's\ndictionary, it would be attempted to pickle it when the instance is\npickled. But functions can not be pickled.\n\nThe solution is \"creative\" (I hope you don't find it crazy - at least\nit works!):\n\n* `CachedMethodCaller` has a `__reduce__` method, that\n  creates a pickle - but when unpickling it, something else is created,\n  namely an instance of the new class `CachedMethodPickle`. It only knows\n  the name of the original cached method, and it knows the instance to\n  which it belongs.\n\n* Now, after unpickling, one wants to work with the cached method.\n  Working means: Requesting attributes (like `__call__`). `CachedMethodPickle`\n  has a `__getattr__` method, which first removes the entry of the\n  instance's dictionary pointing to it; so, it effectively commits suicide.\n\n* Since the `CachedMethodPickle` has been removed, the original cached\n  method is again available from the class of the instance.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```\nsage: I.groebner_basis()\n[y^5*z^3 - 1/4*x^2*z^6 + 1/2*x*y*z^6 + 1/4*y^2*z^6, x^2*y*z^3 - x*y^2*z^3 + 2*y^3*z^3 + z^6, x*y^3 + y^4 + x*z^3, x^3 + y^3 + z^3]\n```\nWe now pickle and unpickle the ideal. The cached method\n`groebner_basis` is replaced by a placeholder::\n\n```\nsage: J = loads(dumps(I))\nsage: J.groebner_basis\nPickle of the cached method \"groebner_basis\"\n```\n\nBut as soon as any other attribute is requested from the\nplaceholder, it replaces itself by the cached method, and\nthe entries of the cache are actually preserved::\n\n```\nsage: J.groebner_basis.is_in_cache()\nTrue\nsage: J.groebner_basis\nCached version of <function groebner_basis at 0x...>\nsage: J.groebner_basis() == I.groebner_basis()\nTrue\n```\n\n**__Creating the cache key__**\n\n1. I found that most of the overhead comes from the computation\nof the cache key. It relies on `sage.misc.function_mangling.ArgumentFixer`.\nInternally, it works on lists and has some loops. So, I thought\nit would benefit from Cython - and indeed it does!\n\nMoreover, I made a shortpath in the method `fix_to_pos`: If there\nare no named arguments then the result is essentially the list of\npositional arguments plus the list of arguments with default value.\n\n2. Some more cache key improvements take place inside `sage.misc.cachefunc`.\nOriginally, the key was obtained by a method `get_key`, which was then\ncalling `_get_instance_key`. In order to reduce the overhead of calling\ntwo methods, I directly inserted the code of `_get_instance_key` and\nremoved that method.\n\n3.

Replying to [@loefflerd](#comment:4):
> Might it not be better for `@`cached_method to store its cache as an attribute of the instance object, rather than having a single cache which stores the values for all instances of that class?

It was not the case that there was a single cache for all instances (the cache was in the instance for `cached_method` resp. in the parent of the instance for `cached_in_parent_method`). However, a part of the overhead came from the fact that the cached method *itself* has not been an attribute of the instance but of its class.

I just attached a new patch that goes far beyond Jason's approach.

These examples show how the cached method performance is
improved by my patch:

**__Using instance attributes__**

Polynomial ideals have a cached method `groebner_basis`. Without
my patch, asking for `I.groebner_basis` would return a
`CachedMethodCaller` - always a *new instance* whenever the cached
method is requested. Of course, that's a waste of time. Therefore,
I store the cached method caller as an attribute of the instance,
which is done when the attribute is first requested:

```
sage: R.<x, y, z> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 3)
sage: I = R*(x^3 + y^3 + z^3,x^4-y^4)
sage: I.__dict__.has_key('groebner_basis')
False
sage: I.groebner_basis
Cached version of <function groebner_basis at 0x15a0668>
sage: I.__dict__['groebner_basis']
Cached version of <function groebner_basis at 0x15a0668>
sage: I.groebner_basis is I.groebner_basis # False without my patch
True
```

This already yields a considerable speedup. However, pickling posed
a problem: Since the cached method caller is in the instance's
dictionary, it would be attempted to pickle it when the instance is
pickled. But functions can not be pickled.

The solution is "creative" (I hope you don't find it crazy - at least
it works!):

* `CachedMethodCaller` has a `__reduce__` method, that
  creates a pickle - but when unpickling it, something else is created,
  namely an instance of the new class `CachedMethodPickle`. It only knows
  the name of the original cached method, and it knows the instance to
  which it belongs.

* Now, after unpickling, one wants to work with the cached method.
  Working means: Requesting attributes (like `__call__`). `CachedMethodPickle`
  has a `__getattr__` method, which first removes the entry of the
  instance's dictionary pointing to it; so, it effectively commits suicide.

* Since the `CachedMethodPickle` has been removed, the original cached
  method is again available from the class of the instance.

Here is an example:

```
sage: I.groebner_basis()
[y^5*z^3 - 1/4*x^2*z^6 + 1/2*x*y*z^6 + 1/4*y^2*z^6, x^2*y*z^3 - x*y^2*z^3 + 2*y^3*z^3 + z^6, x*y^3 + y^4 + x*z^3, x^3 + y^3 + z^3]
```
We now pickle and unpickle the ideal. The cached method
`groebner_basis` is replaced by a placeholder::

```
sage: J = loads(dumps(I))
sage: J.groebner_basis
Pickle of the cached method "groebner_basis"
```

But as soon as any other attribute is requested from the
placeholder, it replaces itself by the cached method, and
the entries of the cache are actually preserved::

```
sage: J.groebner_basis.is_in_cache()
True
sage: J.groebner_basis
Cached version of <function groebner_basis at 0x...>
sage: J.groebner_basis() == I.groebner_basis()
True
```

**__Creating the cache key__**

1. I found that most of the overhead comes from the computation
of the cache key. It relies on `sage.misc.function_mangling.ArgumentFixer`.
Internally, it works on lists and has some loops. So, I thought
it would benefit from Cython - and indeed it does!

Moreover, I made a shortpath in the method `fix_to_pos`: If there
are no named arguments then the result is essentially the list of
positional arguments plus the list of arguments with default value.

2. Some more cache key improvements take place inside `sage.misc.cachefunc`.
Originally, the key was obtained by a method `get_key`, which was then
calling `_get_instance_key`. In order to reduce the overhead of calling
two methods, I directly inserted the code of `_get_instance_key` and
removed that method.

3. I also use Jason's idea of creating a shortpath for the common case
of an empty argument list. However, if the argument list is empty,
there might still be arguments with a default value. But we want
that explicitly providing these default values yields the same cache
key - hence, the following would not work with Jason's patch (continuing
the example above):

```
sage: I.groebner_basis(algorithm='') is I.groebner_basis()
True
```

The solution is to compute the cache key for an empty argument list
*once*, and store the result for later. That's another reason why it
is good to have one `CachedMethodCaller` permanently attached to an
instance (rather than always creating a new one), since otherwise
caching of the default key would be difficult.

**__Accessing the cache__**

Originally, a method `get_cache` was used to get the cache dictionary.
In some cases, that method used to call another one, `_get_instance_cache`.
Hence, again, there was an overhead of calling two methods.

By my patch, the cache is *always* available as an attribute of
the `CachedMethodCaller` instance - hence, access is superfast. There is
almost no memory problem, since it is simply a new pointer to a
dictionary that is an attribute of the instance (resp. of its parent):

```
sage: I.groebner_basis.cache is I._cache__groebner_basis
True
```

There is an additional benefit of this approach: If the instance has
no `__dict__` and does not accept an attribute to be set, it is still
possible to cache the method. Similarly, if the parent of the instance
does not accept attributes to be set, `cached_in_parent_method` would
still result in a cached method (but it would be cached in the instance,
not in its parent).

**__Documentation__**

I extended the documentation - but I did not cover `ClearCacheOnPickle`,
which my patch does not change. Apart from that, the doctest coverage
of `sage.misc.cachefunc` is complete. For `sage.misc.function_mangling`,
the coverage script complains "Please add a `TestSuite(s).run()` doctest."
I don't know were that comes from.

Of course, all doctests pass for me. I did not test whether the documentation
looks nice in html.

**__Performance__**

Last but not least, what the ticket is about: Performance!

Here is the setting:

```
sage: class Foo:
....:     def __init__(self,P=None):
....:         if P is None:
....:             self._parent=self
....:         else:
....:             self._parent=P
....:     @cached_method
....:     def bar(self,m,n=3):
....:         return m^n
....:     @cached_in_parent_method
....:     def barP(self,m,n=3):
....:         return m^n
....:     def parent(self):
....:         return self._parent
....:
sage: F = Foo()
sage: F_ZZ = Foo(ZZ)
```

```

10000 loops, best of 3: 20.4 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit('B.bar()', number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 17.1 Âµs per loop
```

With my patch:

```
sage: timeit('B.bar(n=2,m=3)', number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 3.73 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit('B.bar()', number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 1.95 Âµs per loop
```

I forgot to provide a comparison against an explicitly coded cache:

```
sage: class Foo:
....:     @cached_method
....:     def decorator_bar(self, n=15):
....:         return sum(range(2**n))
....:     def manual_bar(self, n=15):
....:         try:
....:             D = self._my_cache
....:         except AttributeError:
....:             D = self._my_cache = {}
....:             D[n] = sum(range(2**n))
....:         return D[n]
....:
sage: F = Foo()
sage: F.decorator_bar() is F.decorator_bar()
True
sage: F.decorator_bar() == F.manual_bar()
True
sage: F.manual_bar() is F.manual_bar()
True
sage: timeit('F.manual_bar()', number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 1.02 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit('F.decorator_bar()', number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 1.71 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit('F.decorator_bar(15)', number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 3.05 Âµs per loop
```

Hence, the new version of cached methods can almost compete with an explicitly coded cache, but is of course much more comfortable for the programmer.

I forgot to mention another bug fix (that is also doctested). It is about the comparison of representations of symmetric groups:

```
sage: spc = SymmetricGroupRepresentation([3])
sage: spc.important_info = 'Sage rules'
sage: spc == SymmetricGroupRepresentation([3]) # this used to return False!
True
```

The ticket description states that the improvements concern the *critical* path (i.e., the value is already caught). Here is one more comparison, that also shows what happens in the non-critical path.

Setting:

```
sage: class A:
....:     @cached_method
....:     def bar(self,x):
....:         return x
....:     @cached_in_parent_method
....:     def barP(self,x):
....:         return x
....:     def parent(self):
....:         return self
....:     
sage: a = A()
```

Without my patch:

```
# The non-critical path:
sage: time for x in range(10^6): b=a.bar(x)
CPU times: user 24.97 s, sys: 0.16 s, total: 25.13 s
Wall time: 25.13 s
sage: time for x in range(10^6): b=a.barP(x)
CPU times: user 41.03 s, sys: 0.13 s, total: 41.16 s
Wall time: 41.17 s

# The critical path (now the values are cached):
sage: time for x in range(10^6): b=a.bar(x)
CPU times: user 16.45 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 16.47 s
Wall time: 16.47 s
sage: time for x in range(10^6): b=a.barP(x)
CPU times: user 20.47 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 20.50 s
Wall time: 20.50 s
```

With my patch:

```
# The non-critical path:
sage: time for x in range(10^6): b=a.bar(x)
CPU times: user 11.40 s, sys: 0.08 s, total: 11.48 s
Wall time: 11.48 s
sage: time for x in range(10^6): b=a.barP(x)
CPU times: user 27.89 s, sys: 0.12 s, total: 28.01 s
Wall time: 28.02 s

# The critical path (now the values are cached):
sage: time for x in range(10^6): b=a.bar(x)
CPU times: user 3.09 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 3.10 s
Wall time: 3.10 s
sage: time for x in range(10^6): b=a.barP(x)
CPU times: user 5.25 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 5.26 s
Wall time: 5.26 s
```

Hence, the patch improves all cases.

Attachment: **[trac8611_cached_method_overhaul.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8611/trac8611_cached_method_overhaul.patch.gz)**

I slightly changed the patch. But the small change has in fact a big impact:

The method `sage.categories.category.Category.is_subcategory` is used to test whether something is an object of a given category. Due to the omnipresence of categories in Sage, this test occurs very often. So, it should be optimised!

I suggest that `is_subcategory` should be cached. I.e., the new patch version differs from the old one only in the line "@cached_method" in front of that method.

I believe that the additional memory consumption is affordable: When starting Sage, there are precisely 55 categories, so, in the worst case, caching `is_subcategory` adds 55 cache dictionaries with 55 entries.

The impact on the overall performance is obvious:
On my machine, `sage -tp 4 sage` takes 1721.2 seconds without my patch, but 1643.8 seconds with my patch.

Hence, the average improvement is about 4.5%.

There already was such message for the patchbot.

But one question: On sage-devel, Robert Bradshaw reported that I need to rebase the patch. But the patchbot - at least in one attempt - succeeded. So, what is the status?

Unfortunately, I seriously screwed up my Sage installations. Currently, my two ol installations are broken, and sadly I was unablee to build either sage-4.6.1 or sage-4.6.2.alpha0/1.

Patchbot's a bit pedantic about formatting of such messages. If you look at the records of the test runs it's done, you'll see that prior to today it was trying to apply both patches at once, and thus failing, and after I prodded it earlier, it did a new run which passed.

I've got a working 4.6.2.alpha0 build, so I can test it against that tomorrow morning.
