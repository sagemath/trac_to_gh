Run the following:

```

@parallel(4)
def sleeper(x):
    sleep(x)

for _ in sleeper([10]*100):
    pass

```

and interrupt it with ctrl-c (or esc in the notebook).   We get

```
Killing any remaining workers...
[Errno 3] No such process
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyboardInterrupt                         Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/boothby/<ipython console> in <module>()

     98                         signal.alarm(int(walltime() - oldest)+1)
     99                     try:
--> 100                         pid = os.wait()[0]
    101                         signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, signal.SIG_IGN)
    102                     except RuntimeError:

      7 
      8 def my_sigint(x, n):
----> 9     raise KeyboardInterrupt
     10 
     11 def my_sigfpe(x, n):

KeyboardInterrupt: 
``` 

and then, let's restart the computation:

```
sage: for _ in sleeper([10]*100):
    print "hello"
    pass
....: 
15775
[Errno 39] Directory not empty: '/home/boothby/.sage/temp/sage.math.washington.edu/15401/dir_0'
Killing any remaining workers...
```

All I can do here is restart Sage.
