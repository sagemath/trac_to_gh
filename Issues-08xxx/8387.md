Using Sage 4.3.3

help(notebook) shows 

```
 |      - ``interface`` -- string (default: ``'localhost'``), address
 |        of network interface to listen on; give ``''`` to listen on
 |        all interfaces.  You may use ``address`` here for backwards
 |        compatibility, but this is deprecated and will be removed in
 |        the future.

```

Then the second and fourth examples use 'address'. 

```
 |         notebook(address='', secure=True)

 |         notebook(address='', server_pool=['sage1@localhost'],
 |         ulimit='-v 500000', accounts=True)

I see you have changed one bit to 

```
notebook(interface='', server_pool=['sage1@localhost'], 
```

Does the server_pool bit actually work? It certainly does not for me. I find the only way to Sage to use another account is to put something like in a python file, and get python to load it at startup. Otherwise, ussing server_pool in the way documented fails. 

{{{server_pool=['sage1@localhost']

n.notebook('sage_notebook', port=8000, accounts=True, address='',
         server_pool = server_pool, ulimit='-u 1000 -v 1000000 -t 3600',
    open_viewer=False, timeout=20*60, secure=False, port_tries=0)

}}}



Perhaps this is outside the ticket, but if it does not work, perhaps its better to remove any examples showing how to user server_pool.

My god, I did manage to make a few mistakes in that lot!! I should have re-read before posting!

```
import sagenb.notebook.notebook_object as n

server_pool=['sage1@localhost']

n.notebook('sage_notebook', port=8000, accounts=True, address='',
         server_pool = server_pool, ulimit='-u 1000 -v 1000000 -t 3600',
    open_viewer=False, timeout=20*60, secure=False, port_tries=0)

``` 

works, but specifying a server pool at the Sage prompt with something like: 

```
notebook(interface='', server_pool=['sage1@localhost'], 
```

does not work for me. It might be a Solaris specific issue of course.

I'm 99% sure that supplying the serverpool on the command line with:

$ sage -notebook 

fails, but I believe the problem I had last night (see below) goes away if I don't use a server pool. 

```             
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
NameError: name '_interact_' is not defined

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "_sage_input_3.py", line 8, in <module>
    _interact_.SAGE_CELL_ID=1
NameError: name '_interact_' is not defined 
```

Perhaps I need to spend more time double-checking this, but my belief was the options were not propagating properly.
