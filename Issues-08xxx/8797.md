As the subject says. Currently, the modules under `sage/logic/` are not in the reference manual. Clean up the documentation of all modules under `sage/logic/` and get those modules in the reference manual. But before adding them to the reference manual, first we need to clean up their documentation. This clean-up task is spread across the following tickets:

* #8790 --- improve doctest coverage of logic/logic.py
* #8792 --- clean up documentation of logic/booleval.py

* #8794 --- clean up documentation of logic/logicparser.py
* #8795 --- clean up documentation of logic/logictable.py
* #8796 --- clean up documentation of logic/propcalc.py
* #15768 --- clean up documentation of logic/* (which also takes care of #8790, #8794 and #8795)
