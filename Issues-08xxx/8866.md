Here is a rough patch which enables the following:

```
sage: T(r,theta)=[r*cos(theta),r*sin(theta)]

sage: T.diff() # Jacobian matrix

sage: diff(T) # Jacobian matrix
[   (r, theta) |--> cos(theta) (r, theta) |--> -r*sin(theta)]
[   (r, theta) |--> sin(theta)  (r, theta) |--> r*cos(theta)]
sage: T.diff().det() # Jacobian 
(r, theta) |--> r*sin(theta)^2 + r*cos(theta)^2

sage: f(x,y)=x^2+y
sage: f.diff() # gradient
((x, y) |--> 2*x, (x, y) |--> 1)
sage: f.diff().diff() # Hessian matrix
[(x, y) |--> 2 (x, y) |--> 0]
[(x, y) |--> 0 (x, y) |--> 0]
sage: r(t)=[cos(t),sin(t)]
sage: parametric_plot(r(t), (t,0,2*pi))

sage: # multivariable 2nd derivative test
sage: f(x,y)=x^2*y+y^2+y
sage: f.diff() # gradient
((x, y) |--> 2*x*y, (x, y) |--> x^2 + 2*y + 1)
sage: solve(list(f.diff()),[x,y])

sage: f.diff(2)  # Hessian matrix

sage: f.diff(2)(x=0,y=-1/2)

That's stemming from this, of course:

```

sage: SR(4)(2)

```

I don't know what should be done about that to make it prettier.  Usually you wouldn't "call" an integer by itself (as just a symbolic integer is not a function...)

Note that making matrices callable is just extending the existing behavior for vectors.


>I didn't know you could create a vector space of functions.  Complete with a basis.  ;-) 

Yes, interesting.  That stems from callable expressions being just normal expressions with a bit of extra information (default variable order for calls).  Of course, it gave you back a basis for symbolic expressions.
