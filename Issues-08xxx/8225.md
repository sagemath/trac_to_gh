Wow, what a horrible, horrible regression!   Indeed, I've confirmed that what happens is that doing %time causes the notebook to hang forever, and be pretty broken thereafter.   Ouch. The issue was reported at these [sage-support](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_frm/thread/354b7d759e48a326) and [sage-notebook](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-notebook/browse_frm/thread/aaa9d029f57e372c) threads.

I can confirm that this patch fixes the problem with `%time` on 4.3.3, and `%timeit` also works, but doesn't work as it does on the command line -- there, `%timeit` runs multiple loops and so on. Is that how `%timeit` has always worked in the notebook?

I don't know this particular code very well, but the patch appears to fix the problem and seems okay. So consider this a quite weak positive review.
