The docs to misc/misc.py, deprecation() say to put the current version of Sage, but the message that is printed says that the function has been deprecated "Since Sage <version>".  The "since" can be construed as >=, instead of just >.  I suggest we change "Since" to "After" to make the meaning more clear.
