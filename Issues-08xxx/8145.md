```
For those of you who are fans of Joe Culberson's graph theory software
[1], he just gave us the go-ahead [2] to start doing what is necessary
to incorporate it into Sage. I think this might be faster than
anything we ship standard for graph coloring/chromatic number,
although I don't have time to investigate. I'd be more than happy to
answer questions if someone else wanted to give this a try.
