I just tried building the ratpoints package on Cygwin, and 

```
gcc main.c -o ratpoints -I/home/wstein/build/sage-4.3.3.alpha0/local/include -Wall -O2 -fPIC -DRATPOINTS_MAX_BITS_IN_PRIME=7 -DUSE_SSE -L/home/wstein/build/sage-4.3.3.alpha0/local/lib -lgmp -lm -L. -lratpoints                                     
main.c:1: warning: -fPIC ignored for target (all code is position independent)                                             
./libratpoints.a(find_points.o):find_points.c:(.text+0x170): undefined reference to `__imp____gmpz_mul_si' 
BOOM!
```

Thus the fixed that got in from #7015 has been broken before it ever really got to live :-(. 

So this ticket is to implement that fix again.

Here are a few changes to William's spkg:

* I renamed it to `ratpoints-2.1.3.p0`, which is the patch level that comes after `ratpoints-2.1.3`.
* Turned on the executable bits of `spkg-install`.
* Separate the changelog for `ratpoints-2.1.3.p0` and `ratpoints-2.1.3`. The changelog now reads:

 ```
 === ratpoints-2.1.3.p0 (William Stein, 14 Feb 2010) ===
  * Include change to spkg-install so that build works on Cygwin,
    a fix that was in (trac #7015), and somehow got list.  See
    trac #8267.
 
 === ratpoints-2.1.3 (William Stein, 14 Feb 2010) ===
  * Evidently somebody updated ratpoints to 2.1.3 and didn't
    update the SPKG.txt.  Oops.
 ```

An updated spkg with the above changes is available at
