The newly "improved" rational_points function for projective plane curves (#8193) has a bug; if for some (Y,Z) the polynomial defining the curve becomes identically 0, it returns a ValueError caused by the function trying to factorise 0 as a polynomial.

Here is an example

```
sage: F = GF(2)
sage: P2.<X,Y,Z> = ProjectiveSpace(F,2)
sage: C = Curve(X*Y)
sage: a = C.rational_points_iterator()
sage: a.next()
(1 : 0 : 0)
sage: a.next()
(0 : 1 : 0)
sage: a.next()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

```

I propose to write new rational_points_iterator function that will return an iterator over the set of rational points of the projective plane curve. It will avoid this bug. It will be called by rational_points to return a list of all these rational points. A patch to do all of this is on its way.
