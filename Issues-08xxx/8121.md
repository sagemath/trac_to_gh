On the Sage (=IPython) command line:

```
sage: time (2+2)/3
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00 s
4/3
sage: time(2+2)/3
...
NameError: name 'time' is not defined
```

In the notebook

```
sage: time     (2+2)/3
...
NameError: name 'time' is not defined
```

This is happening because in some cases Sage treats "time <foo>" as a function call, and sometimes not.  In the notebook it is always a function, when <foo> starts with a paren, but on the command line it is a function only if there is no space between time and (.   

FIX: Make the notebook work exactly the same was as the command line, in this instance.  That seems like a reasonable solution or compromise.
