Few if any environment variables are documented fully. #8262 is supposed to do this for MAKE_CHECK, but I'm aware of some others which need documenting. 
 
* SAGE_PORT (Allows one to build on any rare (unsupported) platform, like AIX, FreeBSD, HP-UX, Solaris on x86 hardware etc. 
* SAGE_USE_OLD_GCC (Allows use of gcc 3.4.x) 
* CFLAG64 (Flag to build 64-bit binary, defaults to -m64) 
* SAGE_ATLAS_LIB (I've not much idea, but found it when looking)
* INCLUDE_MPFR_PATCH - (Adds a patch to MPFR to bypass a bug in the Solaris memset on sun4v machines.  Note, if Sun patch 142542-01 is installed on sun4v machines, this is not needed, as that fixes the bug. Values are: 
  * INCLUDE_MPFR_PATCH=0 will never include the patch - useful if you know any sun4v machines MPFR will be used on, are patched. 
  * INCLUDE_MPFR_PATCH=1 will include, so binary will work on a sun4v machine, even if created on an older sun4u machine.
  * If unset, will include patch on sun4v machines only.
* SAGE_FAT_BINARY
* Some VALGRIND variable - perhaps SAGE_VALGRIND. 

From sage-doctest -- these are the times, specified in seconds, used by sage -t, sage -t -long, and sage -t -valgrind (and other similar tools), to determine when a doctest times out:

* SAGE_DOCTEST_ALLOW_TABS --- introduced by #8680
* SAGE_TIMEOUT, default 360 seconds (6 minutes)
* SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG, default 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
* SAGE_TIMEOUT_VALGRIND, default 1024 * 1024 seconds

There are probably others too. Some like CC, are fairly obvious, but in many cases do not work, so in some ways, they might be best either undocumented, or documented with a warning that not all packages accept them. 

Some, like SAGE_PORT and SAGE_USE_OLD_GCC are sort of self-documenting, as the build of Sage will quickly terminate if these need to be set, and how to set them is fully explained. 

Perhaps others can update this list with others.

Thank you for adding this. I'm not sure of the best place to document these environment variables, but I created the ticket with a view that the Sage documentation should document the variables. Adding them to a ticket was not really my long term aim of the ticket!

Perhaps README.txt is a good place to document these. 

With the exception of SAGE_USE_OLD_GCC and SAGE_USE_OLD_GCC which are "self-documenting", in that a message will soon appear after typing "make" if you need them, the others shold be documented. 

At the moment, peple are more likely to erroneously set CC (which does not work 100%) than they are most of these.

Or maybe the [Installation Guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/index.html) or [Developer's Guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/index.html)?

I *think* `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` allows one to use pre-existing ATLAS libraries (system-wide or part of a different Sage installation), instead of compiling them from scratch.

Here's a patch to the installation guide.  I'm marking this as "needs work" because I don't know what SAGE_FAT_BINARY and SAGE_VALGRIND do.

Also, is this the right place to put this information?  I also tried it in just before the Fortran section in the same document.  Other suggestions?

I don't know the format of the .rst file, so there is not a lot of point me trying to edit it, but I can make some comments based on the the text of it.

```

I've basically changed all those to 

```
if [ "x$SAGE64" = xyes ] ;

In other words, the variable is now platform independent. So I think something like this would be better:

Here's a new patch which deals with some of these comments.  This is still "needs work"; for example, I don't suggest we keep the text surrounding "SAGE_FAT_BINARY".

Replying to [@sagetrac-drkirkby](#comment%3A13):

> * I would say that "SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD" is experimental 

Okay.

> * I think to say setting CC and CXX **may** be unreliable is an understatement.

Okay.

> * CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS - I'd make the point that these do not work for all packages, so are of limited use and setting them may cause build problems. 

Okay.

> * The meaning of the SAGE64 variable is not correctly described. 

Sorry, I got this straight out of the sage-env script.
SAGE64 does not work on only on Solaris. The original aim of SAGE64 was to force a 64-bit build on **OS X** systems where 

> Some versions of OS X default to 64-bit binaries

This is either OS X 10.6, or maybe just 64-bit machines on OS X 10.6.  Must be the latter.  But we should check with William or sage-devel.

> * SAGE_USE_OLD_GCC. I would add the fact Sage will not build with versions of gcc older than 4.0.1, so this is only of use if you intend changing the Sage source code to allow it to build with older versions of GCC. I think we need to stop people wasting their time thinking it might work, because it most certainly will not. 

I've changed this part a bit, but maybe it should be more strongly worded.

> * CFLAG64. I would add that it is unnecessary to set this on any mainstream operating system, and the only use would be if attempting to port Sage to a platform like AIX or HP-UX using a non-GNU compiler. 

Okay.

> * INCLUDE_MPFR_PATCH. There is a space missing between at this point "sun4v machines.If" 

Okay

> * SAGE_MATPLOTLIB_GUI. There is a 't' missing from the word 'attempt'. 

Okay

> * SAGE_PORT. I would add that any attempt to build Sage with a compiler other than GCC will need this set, and furthermore than Sage has never been successfully built with any compiler other than GCC. (This variable is sort of self-documenting, as it explains exactly what to do, so perhaps we don't need to spell it out too much.) 

Okay.

> * SAGE_TIMEOUT & SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG are not described. 

They deal with doctesting, not the build process, so I'm not sure they belong here.  I've added them now.

> * SAGE_CHECK. I would add that only a small subset of Sage packages support this, but this is being expanded. A reasonably upto date list of packages supporting this may be found at https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9281 

I don't know if we should mention this or just work hard at #9281.  This particular piece of documentation doesn't seem to get updated very much -- see the statements at the top of the page I'm editing about Sage not working on Solaris, for example -- so I don't want to post information which is too time-sensitive.

> * Should these variables be listed alphabetically? In categories? At the moment, the order seems a bit random. I would think put them in categories, but then sort them alphabetically in there. 

I've put them in categories, and then within each category I've started the ones that seem most useful.

Thanks John. A couple of minor changes I would suggest. I don't have an install of Sage handy, so are not going to apply a review patch.

Here's a new patch, and I've also updated the web page.

Replying to [@sagetrac-drkirkby](#comment%3A19):
> * Line 202. The comment "you need to check this" can be removed. What you have is correct. 

(It was there before, it wasn't me.  But I changed it anyway.)

> * Line 495 - commmonly -> commonly 
> * Line 500 - invididual -> individual 

Sorry for all of the typos.  My editor is really sluggish when editing rst files -- several seconds delay between when I type things and when they appear, I don't know why.  So I don't get the usual instant feedback, and so I miss things I shouldn't.

I've fixed all of the other comments, and done a bit more rewording.

> * Line 644. It would be useful to state what directory packages are expected to be in. 

I looked this up and documented it.

Positive review. 

There is one embarrassing (for me) mistake on line 592, as the word "than" appears twice. Perhaps you can fix that, but positive review.
