sqrt(-3) 
For conjugation, power objects just compute the conjugate of the basis 
and the exponent, and construct a new power object from these. Here is 
the relevant function: 
http://pynac.sagemath.org/hg/file/3ece9ba22005/ginac/power.cpp#l805 
```
I'm changing this to "not yet reported upstream".

This is fixed by the new pynac package at #8903. attachment:trac_8775-conjugate.patch contains doctest fixes.

Note that the new pynac version also fixes #8542, #8651, and #8688. Patches from these tickets should be applied before running doctests.

That patched was backed out since it caused some problems with doctests in `sage/rings/qqbar.py`.

I merged the upstream patch from GiNaC fixing this problem in the latest version of pynac. I will upload a new patch with doctest fixes later.
