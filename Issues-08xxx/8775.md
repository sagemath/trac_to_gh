From [http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/9f941378a95c0191](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/9f941378a95c0191):

```
sage: a = sqrt(-3) 
sage: a 
sqrt(-3) 
sage: a.conjugate() 
sqrt(-3) 
sage: bool(a==a.conjugate()) 
True 
```
Could this be related to #6244?  Anyway, presumably conjugate should remain unevaluated on this sort of thing, while still being evaluated on things like a+I or 33.

sqrt(-3) 
For conjugation, power objects just compute the conjugate of the basis 
and the exponent, and construct a new power object from these. Here is 
the relevant function: 
http://pynac.sagemath.org/hg/file/3ece9ba22005/ginac/power.cpp#l805 
```
I'm changing this to "not yet reported upstream".

That patched was backed out since it caused some problems with doctests in `sage/rings/qqbar.py`.

I merged the upstream patch from GiNaC fixing this problem in the latest version of pynac. I will upload a new patch with doctest fixes later.

I uploaded a new patch to add doctests for the fixes in Pynac. Only [attachment: trac_8775-conjugate.take2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8775/trac_8775-conjugate.take2.patch.gz) should be applied.

This depends on #9901.
