Here's the failure on sage.math, when building Sage 4.4.2.alpha0 from source:

```
sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/misc/sagedoc.py # 3 doctests failed
```
The failure with sagedoc.py is due ticket #8468, whose patch was merged without also merging the relevant Sphinx configuration files.

Component: **doctest coverage**
