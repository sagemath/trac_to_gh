Look at the inconsistency:

```
sage: RR(0)
0.000000000000000
sage: RDF(0)
0.0
```

versus

```
sage: CDF(0)
0
sage: CC(0)
0
```

<a id='comment:2'></a>since I was asked to review this ticket, I first notice that some doctests do not pass any more,
for example:

```

thus some more work is needed. Please check all doctests still pass.

<a id='comment:15'></a>Note that the second patch applies with a little fuzz.

```
$ hg qpush
applying trac_8720-doctests.patch
patching file sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx
Hunk #1 succeeded at 189 with fuzz 2 (offset 9 lines).
now at: trac_8720-doctests.patch
```
I'll run tests and check.  I should have set `sage -b` to do parallel building

<a id='comment:19'></a>> Can you double-check to make sure that test was passing before the patches?  It seems odd to me that error would have been triggered by this patch.

Notice that the test now fails because we used to ignore all digits before the exponent, not because of the stack thing - the doc even points out that warnings might happen, it's no big deal for now.

```
        Sometimes warnings are printed (by lcalc) when this command is
        run::
        
            sage: E = EllipticCurve('389a')
            sage: E.lseries().values_along_line(0.5, 3, 5)
            [(0, 0.209951303),
             (0.500000000, -...e-16),
             (1.00000000, 0.133768433),
             (1.50000000, 0.360092864),
             (2.00000000, 0.552975867)]
```
Here is 5.0.beta1:

```
$ ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/lfunctions/lcalc.py 
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/lfunctions/lcalc.py"         
	 [20.4 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 20.5 seconds
<snip>
sage:             sage: E = EllipticCurve('389a')
sage:             sage: E.lseries().values_along_line(0.5, 3, 5)
  ***   Warning: new stack size = 1003360 (0.957 Mbytes).
[(0, 0.209951303), (0.500000000, -2.92081723e-16), (1.00000000, 0.133768433), (1.50000000, 0.360092864), (2.00000000, 0.552975867)]
```
so we can see that all that has to be done is go back to the previous doctest for that one number (not even the whole list).
