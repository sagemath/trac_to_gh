Look at the inconsistency:

sage: RR(0)

sage: RDF(0)
0.0
```

versus

```
sage: CDF(0)
0
sage: CC(0)
0

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
since I was asked to review this ticket, I first notice that some doctests do not pass any more,
for example:

```
sage -t  gsl/dft.py
**********************************************************************
File "/usr/local/sage-4.3.5-core2/devel/sage-8720/sage/gsl/dft.py", line 528:
    sage: t = s.fft(); t
Expected:
    Indexed sequence: [5.00000000000000, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     indexed by [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Got:
    Indexed sequence: [5.00000000000000, 0.000000000000000, 0.000000000000000, \
0.000000000000000, 0.000000000000000]
        indexed by [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```
thus some more work is needed. Please check all doctests still pass.

Thanks for looking at it.  When I ran the doctests, a number of them failed, so I posted to sage-devel and kept this ticket as "needs work".  I will set it to "needs review" when I've taken care of the failing doctests.

Thanks again.

<a id='comment:7'>Comment 7:</a>
note that a consequence of that ticket is that coefficients 0 that were not displayed in Taylor
series are now displayed, for example:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a')
sage: L = E.lseries().dokchitser()
sage: L.taylor_series(1,4)
0.0000000000000 + 0.305999773834052*z + 0.186547797268162*z^2 - 0.136791463097188*z^3 + O(z^4)
```
(Before this ticket, the leading `0.000000000000000` was not printed.)

I find it good, since those 0.0 values can come from numerical cancellation.

> Can you double-check to make sure that test was passing before the patches?  It seems odd to me that error would have been triggered by this patch.

Notice that the test now fails because we used to ignore all digits before the exponent, not because of the stack thing - the doc even points out that warnings might happen, it's no big deal for now.

```
        Sometimes warnings are printed (by lcalc) when this command is
        run::
        
            sage: E = EllipticCurve('389a')
            sage: E.lseries().values_along_line(0.5, 3, 5)
            [(0, 0.209951303),
             (0.500000000, -...e-16),
             (1.00000000, 0.133768433),
             (1.50000000, 0.360092864),
             (2.00000000, 0.552975867)]
```
Here is 5.0.beta1:

```
$ ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/lfunctions/lcalc.py 
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/lfunctions/lcalc.py"         
	 [20.4 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 20.5 seconds
<snip>
sage:             sage: E = EllipticCurve('389a')
sage:             sage: E.lseries().values_along_line(0.5, 3, 5)
  ***   Warning: new stack size = 1003360 (0.957 Mbytes).
[(0, 0.209951303), (0.500000000, -2.92081723e-16), (1.00000000, 0.133768433), (1.50000000, 0.360092864), (2.00000000, 0.552975867)]
```
so we can see that all that has to be done is go back to the previous doctest for that one number (not even the whole list).
