This works fine. In fact, the library was already building 64-bit for me, without this patch, but I believe it is safer to have this. I suspect mpfr might actually ignore the CFLAGS and work out what it needs itself, as it is uses mpir, and that would already be configured 64-bit. But I would agree this is desirable to add this. 

Positive review.
