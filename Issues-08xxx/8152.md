# Issue 8152: Python needs to search /usr/sfw/lib on Solaris for OpenSSL libraries.

Sage currently depends on OpenSSL to build the haslib module in Python. OpenSSL is not distributed with Sage due to license issues. However, the GPL allows us to link to the libraries if they are part of the core operating system, such as the kernel or compilers. (Someone could argue OpenSSL is not part of the core operating system, so even if it comes with the operating system, we can't use it. However, that is another issue.)

The OpenSSL libraries are installed on Solaris 10 in /usr/sfw/lib.  The problem is, python does not currently look there for the libraries. I've submitted an enhancement request to the Python bug database. 

http://bugs.python.org/issue7836

that they add that directory to the list of directories searched. 

Until this gets fixed, I believe we should add the directory /usr/sfw/lib to the top-level setup.py. Then Sage should build on Solaris 10 (but not Open Solaris) without installation of any OpenSSL libraries. 

There is no point making this patch operating system specific, as the code in python is only a search path: 

```
       ssl_libs = find_library_file(self.compiler, 'ssl',lib_dirs,
                                     ['/usr/local/ssl/lib',
                                      '/usr/contrib/ssl/lib/'
                                     ] )

```

I'm not sure if we need to know the location of the include directories, but they are in /usr/src/include/openssl. There is again similar code in setup.py to search for the include files:

```
        # Detect SSL support for the socket module (via _ssl)
        search_for_ssl_incs_in = [
                              '/usr/local/ssl/include',
                              '/usr/contrib/ssl/include/'
                             ]

```

Any comments, before I go to the trouble of making a patch, which just appends the search path for the OpenSSL directories?  Does this seem a reasonable thing to do?

As I mentioned on the list, are we sure about this ?

Here's one example of this failing on Solaris 10 03/2005. I freshly installed Solaris 10 on this machine yesterday. All that has been added are 

* Sun patch 123647-04 to overcome a bug in the supplied gcc 3.4.3
* Installed gmp-4.3.2
* Installed mpfr-2.4.2
* Built gcc 4.4.3

Clearly there are failures on Solaris 10, which can be remidied by to LD_LIBRARY_PATH a directory containing the OpenSSL libraries.
