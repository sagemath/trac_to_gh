```
Thank you.

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html

also needs updating, as it says

-----------------------------------------------------
Solaris? FreeBSD? OS X 10.5 in 64 bit mode?: Complete compilation of Sage is
currently not supported on Solaris or *BSD. It is possible to compile most of
Sage on Solaris machines and to fill in the extra parts using standard packages;
please email sage-devel if you desperately need to run Sage on Solaris. We do
plan to fully support Solaris - it s a very important platform. Work is ongoing.
-----------------------------------------------------

It's clearly now possible to compile all of Sage on Solaris 10 on SPARC hardware.
