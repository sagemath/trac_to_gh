I'm getting noise on doctests on Solaris.  One is straightforward to fix (chmm.pyx).  For the other (time_series.pyx), on Solaris I get

```
sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/finance/time_series.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "/home/palmieri/t2/sage-4.4.alpha2/devel/sage-main/sage/finance/time_series.pyx", line 691:
    sage: finance.TimeSeries([1,0,3]).log()
Expected:
    [0.0000, -inf, 1.0986]
Got:
    [0.0000, -Inf, 1.0986]
**********************************************************************
```
So instead of `-inf`, it's printing `-Inf`.  However, if I do

```
   sage: finance.TimeSeries([1,0,3]).log()[1]
```
then I see `-inf`.  So I've changed the doctest to use this instead.

Two questions: 

* Is sage/finance/time_series.pyx failing on every platform? I'm trying to understand why Solaris would give -inf and other system(s) -Inf. It seems to me that:

```
finance.TimeSeries([1,0,3]).log()
```
is a lot nicer than 

```
 finance.TimeSeries([1,0,3]).log()[1]
```

So is it right to change the test to a more complicated one, just to get the answer we want? If this comes from python, I find it hard to understand why there should be the difference. Would a case-insensitive test be a better method? 

* Do we know what an exact (or high numerical precision value) to the answer of the problem in sage/stats/hmm/chmm.pyx is? I'm always a bit reluctant seeing numerical results, with no justification of the answer. The approach taken in these doc tests seems to be: "The answer is X, since I got X on my computer." Then someone gets a different answer on their computer, so the precision of the test is reduced. But rarely do I see much justification for the answer. (An exception has been in some problems like exp(1.0), where the exact answer is known, and we can be sure the problems are numerical rounding issues. 

When one reads things like how SQLite (Open Source) is tested

http://sqlite.org/testing.html

or how Wolfram Research claim Mathematica (closed source) is tested

http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/TestingAndVerification.html

I'm personally left with the feeling the testing in Sage leaves a lot to be desired.

This is the only one, and I don't know why.  I could try compiling time_series.py with "-std=c99"; maybe that would help?

> So is it right to change the test to a more complicated one, just to get the answer we want?


If the difference are for trivial but insurmountable reasons, I don't have an issue with this.

> If this comes from python, I find it hard to understand why there should be the difference. 


Maybe it comes from math.h somehow?

>  * Do we know what an exact (or high numerical precision value) to the answer of the problem in sage/stats/hmm/chmm.pyx is? 


This is essentially a new file in the Sage library: in previous versions, it was marked with "nodoctest" at the top of the file.  I think that it no longer uses an external library either.  So I view this sort of change as working kinks out, and it doesn't bother me.


I'm always a bit reluctant seeing numerical results, with no justification of the answer. The approach taken in these doc tests seems to be: "The answer is X, since I got X on my computer." Then someone gets a different answer on their computer, so the precision of the test is reduced. But rarely do I see much justification for the answer. (An exception has been in some problems like exp(1.0), where the exact answer is known, and we can be sure the problems are numerical rounding issues.

Actually, it didn't help.  I wonder why log is imported from math.h rather than from Python's math module.

By the way, several of us have come to the conclusion that the "inf" vs. "Inf" thing is actually a bug in Python.
