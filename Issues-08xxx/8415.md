The fault is when refine_embedding is called;  and in that function (in sage.rings.number_field.number_field) the line which hangs is

```
elist = K.embeddings(sage.rings.qqbar.QQbar)
```

So a minimal hang-causing session is simply

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(-7)
sage: K.embeddings(QQbar)
```

sage: r = QQbar(-7).sqrt()

```

It's  in the QQbqr code...    The actual hanging is happening in a call to pari's nffactor on line 1632 of qqbar.py.  So I think it's yet another manifestation of pari's nnffactor bugs:

```

           compiled: Feb 22 2010, gcc-4.3.3 (Ubuntu 4.3.3-5ubuntu4) 
               (readline v6.0 enabled, extended help available)

? nffactor(nf,x^2-x+2)                                                        
  *** nffactor: the PARI stack overflows !
  current stack size: 8000000 (7.629 Mbytes)
  [hint] you can increase GP stack with allocatemem()
```
( from inside sage, this just hangs).

According to http://old.nabble.com/New-PARI-stable-release-2.3.5-td27467266.html there are 3 bug-fixes to nffactor in 2.3.5 which is a bug-fix release.  Current development version is 2.4.3, in which the above example works fine.  I have not tried 2.3.5.
