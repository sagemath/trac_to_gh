I am attaching notebook printouts with old and new output in text and typeset mode.

(In the "before" file typeset versions are for some reason on top of the last lines of text - this happens only after pressing "Print" button in the notebook, the usual editable version looks fine.)

Current situation:
* schemes don't have `_latex_` methods, so typesetting just outputs the usual text representation;
* this is not only not very good looking, but actually can be confusing since polynomials that were on different lines before are now separated just by a space, which may look like an omitted multiplication.

The patch provides `_latex_` methods for pretty yet compact typesetting. In addition, while working on this I made the following changes to `_repr_` methods:
* put commas between polynomials: this may be important even in text mode if polynomials are long and some of them are printed on several lines;
* replaced (no equations) by (no polynomials) for schemes that do not have defining polynomials: since the output does not include "=0", this seems to be more correct;
* compactified printing of quasi-schemes: since both components are schemes in the same ambient space, there is no need to print it twice.

Apply on top of #8675 and #8682.

You're too fast. ;-) (I wanted to remind you changing the doctests, too.)

Updated patch looks fine. (But haven't yet applied/tested it.)
