Multiplying matrices over cyclotomic fields sometimes returns wrong answers:

```
sage: K.<zeta4> = CyclotomicField(4)
sage: m = matrix(K, [186])
sage: n = matrix(K, [125])
sage: m * n
[-23087]
```

Similar errors occur with other cyclotomic fields. Experiments with random 1 x 1 matrices with integer entries up to 10<sup>5</sup>, coerced into the cyclotomic field of order 4, suggest that the answer is wrong about 15-20% of the time. The problem also occurs (less often) for certain examples of multiplying a 2x2 matrix by a 2x2 matrix, and I also found an error in one case of a 1 x 3 multiplied by a 3 x 1.

(This bug first manifested itself in the modular forms code, as was reported by Paul Nelson, a grad student at Caltech: 

```
sage: f = CuspForms(DirichletGroup(5).0,5).0
sage: f[15] # Boom!
ArithmeticError: subspace is not invariant under matrix (vector is not in free module)
``` 
)

The problem is in the multimodular algorithm that's used for computing matrix multiplication over cyclotomic fields:

```
sage: K.<zeta4> = CyclotomicField(4)
sage: m = matrix(K, 1, 1, [186])
sage: n = matrix(K, 1, 2, [1, -6/125*zeta4 - 117/125])
sage: m * n
[                 -23087/125 -1116/125*zeta4 - 21762/125]
```

According to the output of verbose, it works modulo a single prime (split in K), in this case 46337; and the result is indeed correct modulo this prime. But that's not enough, clearly. I'm very suspicious about the method `sage.matrix.matrix_cyclo_dense.Matrix_cyclo_dense.height()`. It returns the maximum absolute value of any entry (in any complex embedding), so n has height 1. Shouldn't it return the maximum absolute value of the numerator or denominator of any element, as with the corresponding method for dense rational matrices? (What does this even mean when K doesn't have class number 1?)

Arguably, the correct statement is that #8666 is a duplicate of this :-).

Just to be safe, it might be worth adding a doctest to the modular forms code to show that the computation that triggered the problem in the original bug report does now work -- I will write a mini-patch tomorrow morning. When that is reviewed and merged then we can close this ticket, but in any case the ticket "priority" flag can safely be reduced.
