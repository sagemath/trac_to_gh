The spkg format for Sage requires that:

   (1) the sagenb-*/ directory (that contains spkg-install, SPKG.txt, etc.) has its own hg report, which has spkg-install and SPKG.txt checked in.

   (2) SPKG.txt gets regularly updated with a log message for each new spkg release.

The goal of this ticket it to change the file src/sagenb/spkg-dist, so that when it it run to create a new spkg, the resulting spkg is *valid* as explained above.  That's it.
