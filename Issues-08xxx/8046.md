The source file `matrix/matrix_double_dense.py` is not included in the documentation.  It appears that it should be, since it has functions that are of interest to users.  Patch simply adds it to the right place in the documentation tree.

The file itself needs some love.  After #4756 goes in, the following four functions should be in good shape.  The remainder needs work.

```
left_eigenvectors()
right_eigenvectors()
eigenspaces_left()
eigenspaces_right()
```

I made a new patch. This one includes the matrix double dense to the documentation like the last one, and it also edits the file a lot to get rid of almost all of the syntax errors. I am still getting 2 warnings however:

One is:

docstring of sage.matrix.matrix_double_dense:8: (WARNING/2) Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

I cannot, however find what the error message is talking about, even after multiple people examined it for quite a while.

The other one is:

WARNING: dvipng command 'dvipng' cannot be run (needed for math display), check the pngmath_dvipng setting

which I am told can be ignored.

So really there is just one warning that could still be fixed.

I'm attaching a 'referee' patch to fix up some docstrings.  The first change in that patch fixes the warning message about the unexpected unindent; the others just tidy some things up.
