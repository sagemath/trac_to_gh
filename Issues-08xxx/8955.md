Reported by Roberto Nóbrega on [sage-devel]:

```
Hello, all!

After running

random_matrix(GF(2), 2, 1)

I always get the same matrix, [[1][1]].

Also, the following code

freq = {}
for _ in range(1000):
    M = random_matrix(GF(2), 2, 2)
    M.set_immutable()
    if M not in freq:
        freq[M] = 1
    else:
        freq[M] += 1
show(freq)

gives a very different result from the uniform distribution that I was
expecting. For example, the all-ones 2x2 matrix is the more probable,
and matrices with a full-zero-row does not appear, although matrices
with a full-zero-column does. In general, I noticed that the more
"1's" the matrix has, the more probable it is.

Am I missing something?

Regards,
Roberto.

Hum, I don't think it's ok now...
My understanding is that:

* we should stare that default is None
* we should explain that in this case each element is random and **can be 0**
* if a density is given, it's the rate of **nonzero** element (thus for GF(2) a density of 1 means an all 1 matrix)
* by the way, density should be float, not Integer, or?
