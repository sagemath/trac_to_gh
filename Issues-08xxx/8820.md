Perhaps Pari doesn't support curve not over Q?

Rats, I thought I had implemented this properly.  The elliptic log does have examples over number fields with complex embeddings!  This should be a lot easier...

The period lattice has an embedding into CC (or RR) stored with it.  That should be used to create a pari elliptic curve defined over RR or CC, there the pari function would work.

I would much prefer to have our own Weierstrass functions implemented, but that's the situation right now.

Note that this will involve some of the same code as #8815.

The patch implements this.  I left the old code (using ellztopoint) for curves over QQ though the new code (using ellwp) works fine too, since the the output of many doctests would have changed (in insignificant bits), especially in heegner.py.

I also documented a couple of functions in period_lattice.py which were not, so that file now has 100% coverage.

It is 4.5.3 on my office computer. 

Not that I believe that it matters. It is just numerical noise. Both results are correct with an error 2.e-16. My question is whether we should change it to 2.2.... e-16, while we could take as an example a point (1,1) where 1.000000... would be a better illustration of the computations.

Am I too picky ?

<a id='comment:22'>**Comment 22:**</a>
A few comments:

* I think the help for `elliptic_exponential` (lines 1379--1385) is not so well written.  I would write something like

```
OUTPUT:

- If ``to_curve`` is False, a 2-tuple of real or complex numbers
representing the point `(x,y) = (\wp(z),\wp'(z))` where `\wp` denotes the Weierstrass
`\wp`-function with respect to this lattice.

- If ``to_curve`` is True, the point `(x-b_2/12,y-(a_1(x-b_2/12)-a_3)/2)`
as a point in `E(\RR)` or `E(\CC)`, with `(x,y) = (\wp(z),\wp'(z))` as above.

If the lattice is real...
```

* The comment

```
       # the next lines compute [P(w), P'(w)] when flag=1
       # or [x:y:1] in E(C) when flag=2
```
 seems to refer to old code.

* Is there a good reason to distinguish between QQ and general number fields?  The number-field code seems simpler, so you could consider removing the special-case code for QQ.

* lines 1503 and 1530: `C(t.real().python(),t.imag().python())` can be simplified as `C(t)`.

* it doesn't work for the point at infinity (and there should be a doctest for that case anyway):

I like this solution. The `elliptic_exponential()` code looks fine to me.  However, I would like somebody else to review the heegner stuff.

One small suggestion: the doctest for `elliptic_exponential()` is quite long, so I would separate it in an `EXAMPLES` part and a `TESTS` part.

> Well, my **personal opinion** on this differs a bit.  I think we should remember that doctests not only serve as tests, but also as documentation.  I think it is always a difficult excercise to balance these two.  For me personally, the balance always goes in favour of documentation.  When needed, one can still add true tests in a `TESTS` section of a doctest.

Fair enough.  In the heegner file, which I did not write any of, I did not want to re-think documentation/tests from scratch, although that might be a good idea;  I just wanted to get things to work!  (And I would not have had to do anything, I think, if I had not followed the suggestion to eliminate the specific QQ code from elliptic_exponential.)

There is a doctest failure on a 32-bit machine:

```

When this is fixed (just write -1.261...), this ticket can finally gets its positive_review.

**Attachment:** [8820_rebase_after_9931-new.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8820/8820_rebase_after_9931-new.patch.gz)

Thanks to all, and apologies for missing that one.  I have changed the patch as suggested and just tested it on a 32-bit machine as well as a 64-bit.

That failing test is exactly the kind of thing it would be nice to avoid altogether in doctests, since the "true" value of the x-coordinate is 0, so all nonzero digits, and the sign, are completely spurious.

Jeroen, if you are happy with this now could you mark it as "positive review"?  Thanks.

Release manager: only the last patch is to be applied.
