Has this been checked on Solaris?

There's general information about building on Solaris at

 http://wiki.sagemath.org/solaris

Information specifically for 't2' at

 http://wiki.sagemath.org/devel/Building-Sage-on-the-T5240-t2

Both the source (4.3.0.1 is the latest to build on Solaris) and a binary which will run on any SPARC can be found at http://www.sagemath.org/download-source.html

Dave,

Are you sure you posted this comment to the correct ticket?

If so, could you please comment on the relevance of Solaris to 
the code?

Thanks,

The fix to crystals.py doesn't apply to either sage 4.3.2 or sage 4.3.3.  Can it be removed from this patch?

Hi Jason,

I attached a revised patch which includes your suggestion to add the option to test
whether the polynomial is symmetric.

For me the patch applied to sage-4.3.3. It depends on trac tickets #7978 and #8154
which have been merged in sage-4.3.3. Hence it might not apply cleanly to sage-4.3.2.

Hi Jason,

As we just discussed on the phone, I did revert the indentation of class Element
in /combinat/sf/monomial.py back to the same level as
class SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_monomial

However, I did change the indentation to be multiples of 4 rather than multiples 
of 3. I sent an e-mail to sage-combinat-devel to ask about the indentation issues
in sf.

Just two tiny remarks:

- One can write `assert a==b` instead of `assert(a==b)`
- One could be a bit more specific:  `assert a==b, "not a symmetric polynomial"
- Assertion are not *always* checked (see http://docs.python.org/reference/simple_stmts.html).
  So I am not sure it is the appropriate idiom here.

That's minor, so I let you see if you want to add a quick review patch, or just leave things as is.

Thanks!
