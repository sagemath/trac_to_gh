Has this been checked on Solaris?

There's general information about building on Solaris at

 http://wiki.sagemath.org/solaris

Information specifically for 't2' at

 http://wiki.sagemath.org/devel/Building-Sage-on-the-T5240-t2

Both the source (4.3.0.1 is the latest to build on Solaris) and a binary which will run on any SPARC can be found at http://www.sagemath.org/download-source.html

Hi Jason,

I attached a revised patch which includes your suggestion to add the option to test
whether the polynomial is symmetric.

For me the patch applied to sage-4.3.3. It depends on trac tickets #7978 and #8154
which have been merged in sage-4.3.3. Hence it might not apply cleanly to sage-4.3.2.

Anne

Hi Jason,

As we just discussed on the phone, I did revert the indentation of class Element
in /combinat/sf/monomial.py back to the same level as
class SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_monomial

However, I did change the indentation to be multiples of 4 rather than multiples 
of 3. I sent an e-mail to sage-combinat-devel to ask about the indentation issues
in sf.

Just two tiny remarks:

- One can write `assert a==b` instead of `assert(a==b)`
- One could be a bit more specific:  `assert a==b, "not a symmetric polynomial"
- Assertion are not *always* checked (see http://docs.python.org/reference/simple_stmts.html).
  So I am not sure it is the appropriate idiom here.

That's minor, so I let you see if you want to add a quick review patch, or just leave things as is.

Thanks!
