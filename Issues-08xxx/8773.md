```
[wstein@lena sage-4.4]$ ./sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: gap('2+3')
A workspace appears to have been corrupted... automatically rebuilding (this is harmless).

Exactly the same thing works fine with Sage-4.3.3 built using GCC-4.4.x on lena:

```
[wstein@lena sage-4.4]$ ../sage-4.3.3/sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: gap('2+3')

Deleting workspaces, etc., doesn't help.   The GAP spkg is unchanged between these two versions of Sage.

I think that ideally this method of returning values should be removed entirely (since it seems to serve no purpose), and `SyFindOrLinkGapRootFile` should just get an extra argument of type `StructInitInfo**` for returning this pointer.


Incidentally gcc 4.5.0 also complains about a similar issue in `SaveDouble`, `LoadDouble`. Although that seems to be currently working, using a union there might be safer than casting directly.

this needs to be tested on every platform Sage supports, (itaniums, macs, sparcs...).

This is quite a drastic change, and there is no telling how older versions of gcc would cope!
I think it should get seen by real GAP kernel folks before we start even think of shipping this.

Should I post this on GAP-support, of which I happen to be a member?

Finally, I do not understand why it is a blocker. Is 4.4.1 going to support gcc-4.5.0 ?!
I would say that attempting to support gcc-***.0 is a waste of time.
Let it ripe to at least .1 or better .2...
I therefore lower the priority of this to major.

I would also propose another way to get it in Sage:   make these new patches conditional on gcc version >=4.5.

If you could, that would be great. Thanks.

In my opinion writing such a check would cause more potential for trouble than the changes.

Hoezo, Willem Jan? :-)

You don't need to do #if 's in the code...
Get gcc version in spkg-install, and only apply new patches in case you get right version.
And print a warning that it's a new, not quite tested, stuff.
A couple lines of shell code...

Yes.

Not if it's what our clients want.

Let me rephrase it: I don't think the changes are risky enough to justify having two separate versions of the code.

Well done Willem. The diagnosis looks correct. This is old code and clearly the nice solution is to use a suitable union type so as to be more honest with the C compiler about what is actually being passed back and forth. Is there an easy way to pass me the proposed patch and I'll either apply it to GAP development branch or send you a preferred version if I want to do it a little differently.

SaveDouble/LoadDouble can probably also be handled correctly with unions, so long as, in

union { char bytes[sizeof(double)], double d};


one can rely on bytes including all the data of double. Does anyone know anything about this? Otherwise might be better to use void * and memcopy or something like that.

the saveload.patch is still needed on ia64 (Itanium).
The symptom (corrupt GAP workspace names created
by GAP's SaveWorkspace) reappears if I unapply it, 
so the problem didn't go away after the strict aliases patch.
