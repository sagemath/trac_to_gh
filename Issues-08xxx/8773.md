Exactly the same thing works fine with Sage-4.3.3 built using GCC-4.4.x on lena:

```
[wstein@lena sage-4.4]$ ../sage-4.3.3/sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.3.3, Release Date: 2010-02-21                       |

----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: gap('2+3')
5
```

Deleting workspaces, etc., doesn't help.   The GAP spkg is unchanged between these two versions of Sage.

We've had this sort of problem (many times) before...

The issue here seems to be that gap is returning a `StructInitInfo*` from `SyFindOrLinkGapRootFile` inside a char buffer. In the process of extracting the pointer again in `READ_GAP_ROOT`, gap might be breaking strict aliasing rules.

I think that ideally this method of returning values should be removed entirely (since it seems to serve no purpose), and `SyFindOrLinkGapRootFile` should just get an extra argument of type `StructInitInfo**` for returning this pointer.


Incidentally gcc 4.5.0 also complains about a similar issue in `SaveDouble`, `LoadDouble`. Although that seems to be currently working, using a union there might be safer than casting directly.

this needs to be tested on every platform Sage supports, (itaniums, macs, sparcs...).

This is quite a drastic change, and there is no telling how older versions of gcc would cope!
I think it should get seen by real GAP kernel folks before we start even think of shipping this.

Should I post this on GAP-support, of which I happen to be a member?

Finally, I do not understand why it is a blocker. Is 4.4.1 going to support gcc-4.5.0 ?!
I would say that attempting to support gcc-***.0 is a waste of time.
Let it ripe to at least .1 or better .2...
I therefore lower the priority of this to major.

I would also propose another way to get it in Sage:   make these new patches conditional on gcc version >=4.5.
 
Dima

Not so drastic, really. The changes are very much localised, and the new code is *far* less risky than the current version. Older versions of gcc should have no problem with it.I agree it needs testing on more platforms, of course.

If you could, that would be great. Thanks.

In my opinion writing such a check would cause more potential for trouble than the changes.

Hoezo, Willem Jan? :-)

You don't need to do #if 's in the code...
Get gcc version in spkg-install, and only apply new patches in case you get right version.
And print a warning that it's a new, not quite tested, stuff.
A couple lines of shell code...

Well done Willem. The diagnosis looks correct. This is old code and clearly the nice solution is to use a suitable union type so as to be more honest with the C compiler about what is actually being passed back and forth. Is there an easy way to pass me the proposed patch and I'll either apply it to GAP development branch or send you a preferred version if I want to do it a little differently.

SaveDouble/LoadDouble can probably also be handled correctly with unions, so long as, in

union { char bytes[sizeof(double)], double d};
