The latest version of SQLAlchemy is now 0.7.6. This brings a bunch of changes, notably a native unicode mode, which would be a lot faster for unicode rich applications, such as the Sage Notebook.

The new package is at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhansen/sqlalchemy-0.7.6.spkg

Fine on OS X. No doctests to run or break and there is currently no SPKG check but that should be another ticket provided that sqlalchemy has some self-tests. Positive review from me.

Ok, last version of sqlalchemy is now 0.9.4. Does not make much sense to run behind versions of pire Python modules. The following works perfectly on my computer

```
sage -sh
easy_install pip
pip install sqlalchemy==0.9.4
```
We should rather include `pip` in Sage as proposed in [this thread in sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/e48IruDu7Kg) and make 'sage -i sqlalchemy` points to the last version.
