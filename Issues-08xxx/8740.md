Ok, last version of sqlalchemy is now 0.9.4. Does not make much sense to run behind versions of pire Python modules. The following works perfectly on my computer

```
sage -sh
easy_install pip
pip install sqlalchemy==0.9.4
```
We should rather include `pip` in Sage as proposed in [this thread in sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/e48IruDu7Kg) and make 'sage -i sqlalchemy` points to the last version.
