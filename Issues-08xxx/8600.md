I find the placement of the nodes strange (and even more if the tree is big).

I would prefer an implementation using Fibonacci numbers all over the construction:

```
def FibonacciTree(n):
    T = Graph(name="Fibonacci-Tree-%d"%n)
    if n==1: T.add_vertex(0)
    if n<2: return T

    F = list(fibonacci_sequence(n + 2))
    s = 2.0 ** (n / 2.0 - 2)
    pos = {}

    def fib(level, node, y):
        pos[node] = (node, y)
        if level < 2: return
        level -= 1
        y -= s
        diff = F[level]
        T.add_edge(node, node-diff)
        if level == 1: # only one child
            pos[node - diff] = (node, y)
            return
        T.add_edge(node, node + diff)
        fib(level, node - diff, y)
        fib(level - 1, node + diff, y)

    T.add_vertices(xrange(sum(F[:-1])))
    fib(n, F[n + 1] - 1, 0)
    T.set_pos(pos)

    return T
```

but maybe it's just a matter of taste.

With `n=7` you obtain the same graph as http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/avl/avlmuchbal.png .
Notice that the name of each node is also it's x-coordinate (except for the only children where I prefer to put them under their father).
