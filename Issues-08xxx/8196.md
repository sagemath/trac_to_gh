Clearly the math formulae are not displayed correctly in tty mode.

How would you expect them to be displayed, given that it's tty mode?

the "mathtt{...}" should not appear, thus we should get something like:

```
            ALGORITHM: Calculate the Jacobi symbol
            `(self/p)` at each prime `p`
            dividing `n`. It must be 1 or 0 for each prime, and if it
            is 0 mod `p`, where `p^k || n`, then
            `ord_p(self)` must be even or greater than
```

The patch at #8209 does this, but really only because mathtt is broken everywhere: broken in notebook documentation and in the reference manual, so might as well fix it from the command line, too.  I really don't think we want to write what would essentially be a LaTeX --> text converter, so there are limits to how good the help strings will look from the command line.

I suggest we close this, since #8209 takes care of the specific issue here.
