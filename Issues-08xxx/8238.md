<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

Robert,

I think the point of this patch is to change the function so it is no longer off by factors of 2 by default. 
Note that the documentation, even after applying your patch, says:

```
    r"""
    Return an interval that contains the index of the Heegner
    point `y_K` in the group of `K`-rational points modulo torsion
    on this elliptic curve, computed using the Gross-Zagier
    formula and/or a point search, or the index divided by `2`.

    .. note::

       If ``min_p`` is bigger than 2 then the index can be off by
       any prime less than ``min_p``. This function returns the
       index divided by `2` exactly when the rank of `E(K)` is
       greater than 1 and `E(\QQ)_{/tor} \oplus E^D(\QQ)_{/tor}`
       has index `2` in `E(K)_{/tor}`, where the second factor
       undergoes a twist.
```

If you've really fixed the "factor of 2" issue, as it seems you have, then the documentation should be changed to reflect this.  Moreover, this is an enhancement, rather than a bug fix.

I applied the patch to 4.4.3 and it worked fine (patch applies cleanly, all long tests in heegner.py pass, 

Some minor quibbles:
1. on line 6365:  instead of "an interval that contains the index, or the index over 2" say "... or half the index".
2. line 6454++:  this code is reached whe then rank is 0 (or it appears to be) but then F.gens()[0] would fail.  If it is the case that the rank would never be 0 here. I would prefer a comment to that effect and change the test to if F.rank() == 1.  (I assume that in this context calling F.rank() and F.gens() is not expensive?)
3. After setting a=2 in line 6460 the loop should break.  (OK, so there will not be that many torsion points o nEK, but still.)  Even better would be to first compute EK.torsion_points() and only run the loop at all if it has even length?  (But still test if z itself can be divided by 2).  I'm sure I once wrote a function which returned a list of points generating torsion modulo 2*torsion....if you did

```
sage: for T in EK.torsion_subgroup().gens():
....:     if T.order()%2==0:
```
you would have at most 2 points to check.

I'll give this a positive review once these have been fixed.
