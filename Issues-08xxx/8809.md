```
When building binaries that include fortran, etc., it would give developers and users a lot more control if the local/bin/sage_fortran script were changed from

```
!/bin/sh

/usr/bin/gfortran -fPIC $@
```
to

```
!/bin/sh

if [ x"$SAGE_FORTRAN" != x ]; then
     "$SAGE_FORTRAN" -fPIC $@
else
     /usr/bin/gfortran -fPIC $@
fi
```

where /usr/bin/gfortran just happens to what was hardcoded.
