Mostly of this sort:

```
categories/examples/finite_semigroups.rst:6: (WARNING/2) error while formatting signature for sage.categories.examples.finite_semigroups.LeftRegularBand.Element.wrapped_class.center: arg is not a module, class, method, function, traceback, frame, or code object
```
This may happen because `wrapped_class = str` is [an alias of] a builtin.
