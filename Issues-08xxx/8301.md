Type in

```
sage: b = random_matrix(GF(2),4,200); b[3] = b[0]; b.rank()
```
and get an absolutely stupendous segfault!

For the first time ever I finally get to use GF(2) matrix algebra for some actually interesting number theory research.  So I wrote a program that creates some fairly simple GF(2) matrices (using modular symbols), and tried the first somewhat nontrivial thing (computing the rank of a 4xn matrix) and got segfaults.  This is on 64-bit Ubuntu Linux.  Yikes.   So:

1. These need to get fixed, obviously.

2. Is there an easy way to completely turn off m4ri?  Seeing how easily it fell over, I don't trust it, and though it is fast I definitely want to rerun all my calculations m4ri free once I have everything setup.  These are calculations for a published paper that will play a key role in a "proof by computer" of a potentially important result in number theory.  

Regarding 2, here is a way that I seem to be able to get a matrix mod n dense, and I can then compute the rank, which in this case uses linbox, and is probably fast enough for my application:

```
sage: c = sage.matrix.matrix_modn_dense.Matrix_modn_dense(b.parent(),b.list(),False,True)
sage: c.rank()
3
sage: timeit('c.rank()')
625 loops, best of 3: 534 ns per loop
sage: timeit('c._clear_cache(); c.rank()')
625 loops, best of 3: 161 µs per loop
```

A new SPKG is available at:

   http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/libm4ri-20100221.spkg

FWIW, I just ran

```python
sage: for i in range(10^4):
    b = random_matrix(GF(2),4,200); b[3] = b[0]
    c = sage.matrix.matrix_modn_dense.Matrix_modn_dense(b.parent(),b.list(),False,True)
    assert(b.rank() == c.rank())
....:
```
without errors.
