<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
eah, this is my fault:

```
+        This example saves a plot to the standard R output, usually 
+        a filename like ``Rplot001.png`` - from the command line, in 
+        the current directory, and in the cell directory in the notebook::
+
+            sage: r.plot("1:10")
+            null device 
+                      1 
+
```
I actually put this one in to show users how to actually get a file in a directory that they have access to, as opposed to a temp directory, but forgot we can't do that.  Is it legitimate to put #not tested with this doctest as a fix, since it is important to have the example there?

From was:

```
Another option:

1. make sufpre the png file you are about to write doesn't exist in the current directory, then write it.
2. then delete it!


# not tested should be avoided at all costs.
