Sage with patch #7325 fails to solve some simple ineqaulitites

```
sage: solve(x^4+2>0,x)
[[x > -(-1)^(1/4)*2^(1/4), x < (-1)^(1/4)*2^(1/4)]]
```
This should be fixed in Maxima and has been reported on [maxima list](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.maxima.general/29593). Update Maxima (has been fixed in CVS in [solve_rat_ineq](http://maxima.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/maxima/maxima/share/contrib/solve_rat_ineq.mac?view=log)).
