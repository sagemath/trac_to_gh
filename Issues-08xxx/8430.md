Since the other issues have there own tickets I don't think another one is necessary.

There is one doctest failure still:

```
File "/Volumes/E/sage-4.3.4.alpha0/devel/sage-t1/sage/categories/finite_semigroups.py", line 229:
    sage: sorted(S.j_transversal_of_idempotents())
Expected:
    ['a', 'ab', 'ac', 'acb', 'b', 'bc', 'c']
Got:
    ['a', 'ab', 'ac', 'acb', 'b', 'c', 'cb']
*********************************************
```

which is not covered by the patch.  Seems like maybe the expected string is wrong, unless the sorted function has varying behavior.

I'm not sure to understand:
- why I missed this one;
- why the result of sorted changed between 4.3.3 and 4.3.4;
- why despite of this change it seems to be stable on both version...
Anyway the newly uploaded patch passed the tests 10 times in a raw on the machine sage. Maybe it could be worth checking of it is also stable on other architectures.

Sorry for the mess and please review.

SageNB 0.7.5.2 includes fixes for the first two failures in the description (see #8435).

An important note:  It's best to test SageNB files with `-force_lib`, e.g.,

```sh
sage -t -long -force_lib local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sagenb-0.7.5.1-py2.6.egg/sagenb/notebook/interact.py
```

Running `sage -t -sagenb` or `make test` and its friends will set it implicitly.  If the option is set, `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-doctest` will treat the file(s) as Sage library code, even if it does not live under `SAGE_ROOT/devel`.  In particular, `sage-doctest` will not attempt the equivalent of `from filebase import *`, which can raise false errors or cause segfaults.

I suppose I should have called it `-library_code`, instead.

Please remember to fillin
