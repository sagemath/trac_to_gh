I'd like to propose that certain special names should be protected so that they could not become variable names (for example pi, e, and i)

if by accident you assign them like:

```
sage: e=factorial(10)
```

and then you need to need to use e with it's standard meaning, like

```
sage: e^100
```

you will have a very hard time finding the error ( `factorial(10)^100` ).

I see that this would be a desirable feature for users of symbolics. I don't think the implementation is related to the symbolics subsystem however. I'm assigning this back to the misc component.
