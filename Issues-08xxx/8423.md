I have only minor issues with this

- I see that when you pass in a period you are giving a random root of the dynatomic. I'm not opposed to this, but it should definitely be documented. Especially since some of the roots are actually lower period points when the tail is not 0, for example `julia_plot(period=[1,1])` returns a c value of a fixed point sometimes.

- return_points - This seems to return the c value associated to a particular period. If I've understood this correctly, it is not needed.

- In several places you say you are iterating `c` for the Julia set. You are not, you are iterating the complex point corresponding to that pixel for the fixed c value defining the map.

The idea behind `return_points` was to provide a way for the user to find all of the Julia sets of a certain cycle structure instead of just getting a random one. For example, if I wanted to find all of Julia sets with cycle structure (2,3) I can run the following code:

```python
c_values = julia_plot(period=[2,3], return_points=True)
for c in c_values:
    julia_plot(c)
```

I wasn't sure if this would be useful or not so if it isn't practical, I can remove it.

That sounds like a good idea. I'll remove the extra function and add the following example to the `julia_plot` documentation:

```python
sage: period = [2,3] # not tested
....: R.<c> = QQ[]
....: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(R,1)
....: R = P.coordinate_ring()
....: H = End(P)
....: f = H([x^2+c*y^2,y^2])
....: L = f.dynatomic_polynomial(period).subs({x:0,y:1}).roots(ring=CC)
....: c_values = [k[0] for k in L]
....: for c in c_values:
....:     julia_plot(c)
```

Is that what you had in mind?

Note that there is a merge conflict now.

Also, there are a few more minor things in the docs

- misspelling - 'diplay'

- You don't have all the instances of `c` and `p` right. It should be `Q_c(p)` and you are coloring `p`.

- you need to wrap some of the kwds descriptions as those lines are too long

- I'd also suggest saying that the period: `with (formal) cycle structure` to indicted that you are using the dynatomic polynomial

- `if period is not None` I guess is ok, but I'm used to seeing `if not period is None`.
