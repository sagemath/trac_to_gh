Oups, intersection with #8429 which refactors the code of sage.combinat.words.

I post soon a new patch that apply only after #8429 and I think it's better.

The same bug was occuring with `is_cube_free` :

```
sage: Word('111').is_cube_free()
True
sage: Word('2111').is_cube_free()
True
sage: Word('32111').is_cube_free()
True
```

I just applied a patch which fixes this problem. I changed some doctests of both `is_square_free` and `is_cube_free`. I also removed a useless slice in the code of both functions and this gives good improvements in timings :

BEFORE:

```
sage: t = words.ThueMorseWord()
sage: %timeit t[:100].is_cube_free()
5 loops, best of 3: 3.13 s per loop
```

AFTER:

```
sage: t = words.ThueMorseWord()
sage: %timeit t[:100].is_cube_free()
5 loops, best of 3: 1.18 s per loop
```

Hello !! This patch is finem except for a small unimportant thing which bothered me :

```
for end in xrange(start+3, L+1, 3): 
```

Why go up to L+1 when the last letter is L-1 ? The algorithm is still correct as 

```
Word("abc")[:50000]
```

raises no exception, but as there is no reason to.... So I give a positive review to the patches above, and trac_8490_review-ncohen.patch is left to be reviewed by anyone other than me (quoting Minh) :-)

Thank you for this patch !!

First, xrange returns a left-closed and right-open interval. Hence, one needs to write something like `xrange(0,L+1)` if one wants to go up to `L` :

```
sage: list(xrange(0,5))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Second, the variable `end` is not used to get a specific item in self but for slicing self. Hence, if one wants to consider all the slicing possibilities, the variable `end` must take the last possible value `L`:

```
sage: list(xrange(0,5)) [2:5]   #is good
[2, 3, 4]
sage: list(xrange(0,5)) [2:4]   #forgets the last letter
[2, 3]
```

Hence, your patch is strange in the sense that doctests should not pass!

We made the choice of following the Python behavior for slices that goes too far:

```
sage: L = range(10)
sage: L
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
sage: L[:100]
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

The patch `trac_8490_review-ncohen.patch` reintroduce the same bug as the current ticket is trying to solve. Hence, I think the patches are to be reviewed in this order again :

* trac_8490-square_free-vd.patch
* trac_8490_review-sl.patch
