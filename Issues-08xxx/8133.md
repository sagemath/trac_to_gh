The current representation of Dirichlet characters as something like `[1,zeta6,-1]` is not very helpful, especially because it is not even clear what generator we are talking about in (Z/N)*.

I put this in the component 'modular forms' since the relevant file dirichlet.py is there. But I think it is a bit odd that this file is there; it should be with number fields, I believe. 

The attached patch changes the string representation of a Dirichlet character to 

```
sage: G = DirichletGroup(12)
sage: chi = G.0
sage: chi
Dirichlet character modulo 12 of conductor 4 mapping the generators to {5: 1, 7: -1}
```

I have also created a shorter representation that is used in other `_repr_` like in

```
sage: ModularForms(chi,7)
Modular Forms space of dimension 14, character {5: 1, 7: -1} and weight 7 over Rational Field
```

William, what is the verdict on such a change ?

I have concerns:

1. First, you can easily get the generators of the Dirichlet group.   I do not think they have to be given explicitly in the print representation (just like the basis for a vector space doesn't have to be given in a matrix).   See below -- just use the `unit_gens()` method to find out the gens that are being mapped. 

```
sage: G.<a,b,c> = DirichletGroup(40)
sage: b
[1, -1, 1]
sage: a
[-1, 1, 1]
sage: c
[1, 1, zeta4]
sage: G.unit_gens()
[31, 21, 17]
```
 
2. There are potential issues with your suggested change:

```
Dirichlet character modulo 12 of conductor 4 mapping the generators to {5: 1, 7: -1}
```
The problem is that it literally makes no sense to read it.  The generators don't get mapped to a Python dictionary.   It's like a mixed metaphor.   Moreover, if you use Python dictionary notation, maybe you really have a dictionary there, so the keys can come in random order, which is bad. 

3. If we're going to make some big change, it would be better to make it consistent with ring homomorphisms, which all do print in the same way:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]}}} 
sage: phi = R.hom([y^3,x-3]); phi
Ring endomorphism of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
  Defn: x |--> y^3
        y |--> x - 3
```
However, this notation is definitely too heavy as is for Dirichlet characters.  


I'm not going to suggest a change, since I actually like how Dirichlet characters are currently printed.

Thanks a lot for the valuable comments. Sorry to insist a bit more on this change. I have been using Dirichlet characters quite a lot recently for p-adic L-functions (of elliptic curves and for zeta functions) and I thought the current printing was not useful.

I almost agree with you, only with a few minor points :

* The group (Z/N)* is not a vector space, for instance for N=16, we have Z/2 + Z/4 and so the two generators have different order and it would be great to recognise that immediately in the string representation. 

* Usually, in a vector space the elements do not have canonical names as the residue classes in Z/N have.

Yes, I agree with both. So as a second attempt I would propose a long representation of the form

```
sage: chi
Dirichlet character modulo 12 of conductor 4 mapping 5 |--> 1, 7  |--> -1
```

or maybe one could print the order, too.
And a short representation as in 

```
sage: ModularForms(chi,7)
Modular Forms space of dimension 14, character 5 |--> 1, 7 |--> -1 and weight 7 over Rational Field
```

or maybe with () around it. Or we could leave it there as values_on_gens().

> I'm not going to suggest a change, since I actually like how Dirichlet characters are currently printed. 


... this is of course a valid poitn of taste about which I won't argue about at all.

So, here is a new version of the patch. This one is ready to be reviewed. It changes the string representation of a Dirichlet character to 

```
sage: chi
Dirichlet character modulo 12 of conductor 4 mapping 5 |--> 1, 7  |--> -1
```

but leaves the usual representation within modular form etc, like 

```
sage: ModularForms(chi,7)
Modular Forms space of dimension 14, character [1,-1] and weight 7 over Rational Field
```

If this change is not approved by some, I would propose to make a vote on sage-nt.

After 4 days, there were two responses on sage-nt:  a positive one from William, and a suggestion for a few further changes from Robert Bradshaw (see http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sage-nt/browse_thread/thread/be56e6f0e29b44e8).

```
I certainly like the new representation better. Perhaps the `_latex_`   
method should use \mapsto rather than the ASCII art |-->, but it   
should certainly produce \zeta_{n}^{k} rather than returning just   
plain `_repr_`. Another alternative short representation would be   
something like 
(31, 41, 37) |--> (1, 1, zeta4) 
- Robert 
```

Latexing of Dirichlet characters is being tracked at #8584. I have uploaded a new patch there which implements Robert's suggestions (using `\mapsto` and the latex representation of roots of unity). 

For what it's worth, I'm also in favour of the change.
