I think that is reasonable. In most cases, it is safe for a new SageNB spkg to go into an alpha release. But I would refrain from putting a new SageNB spkg into an rc release. Anyway, John's argument convinces me.

Strange - I get the same Selenium failures on 0.7.5.3 as the ones listed above.

My setup:
* FF 3.5.8 on Ubuntu 32-bit 9.10
* Selenium Server 1.0.3 run with `java -jar selenium-server.jar`
* `sagenb-0.7.5.3/src/sagenb/sagenb/testing$ sage -python run_tests.py`
* sage version 4.3.4.alpha0
* SAGENB_VERSION is '0.7.5.3'
* All doctests pass (`sage -t -sagenb`).

You're right. I just upgraded to Selenium 1.0.3 (from 1.0.1) and now they don't all pass.  I'll investigate.

To run the [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/) tests with Firefox, check that Java is installed and [download Selenium RC](http://seleniumhq.org/download/):

```sh
wget http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-remote-control-1.0.3.zip
mkdir selenium
cd selenium
unzip selenium-remote-control-1.0.3.zip
cd selenium-server-1.0.3
java -jar selenium-server.jar
```
To run the SageNB tests, I usually do the following, e.g., in a script:

```python
sage: import sagenb.testing.run_tests as rt
sage: brow = '*firefox3 /usr/lib64/firefox-3.5.8/firefox'  
sage: rt.setup_tests('localhost', False, brow)
sage: rt.run_any()
```
The `setup_tests` step may not be necessary, but I think it helps to give the path to the actual Firefox binary.  See docstrings for a few examples.
