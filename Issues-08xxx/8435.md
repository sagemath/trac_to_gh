I don't think that's true.  I think that William, Tim Dumol, and myself are all pretty comfortable with the code.  I think it's more of any issue that other people haven't put time in trying to work on it.

Which version of Sage is this?  Those doctest failures sound like consequences of patches to keep up with changes in Sage 4.3.4.alpha0, so you might get errors if you run this version of sagenb with an older version of Sage.

I think that is reasonable. In most cases, it is safe for a new SageNB spkg to go into an alpha release. But I would refrain from putting a new SageNB spkg into an rc release. Anyway, John's argument convinces me.

Strange - I get the same Selenium failures on 0.7.5.3 as the ones listed above.

My setup:
* FF 3.5.8 on Ubuntu 32-bit 9.10
* Selenium Server 1.0.3 run with `java -jar selenium-server.jar`
* `sagenb-0.7.5.3/src/sagenb/sagenb/testing$ sage -python run_tests.py`
* sage version 4.3.4.alpha0
* SAGENB_VERSION is '0.7.5.3'
* All doctests pass (`sage -t -sagenb`).

You're right. I just upgraded to Selenium 1.0.3 (from 1.0.1) and now they don't all pass.  I'll investigate.

To run the [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/) tests with Firefox, check that Java is installed and [download Selenium RC](http://seleniumhq.org/download/):

```sh
wget http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-remote-control-1.0.3.zip
mkdir selenium
cd selenium
unzip selenium-remote-control-1.0.3.zip
cd selenium-server-1.0.3
java -jar selenium-server.jar
```
To run the SageNB tests, I usually do the following, e.g., in a script:

```python
sage: import sagenb.testing.run_tests as rt
sage: brow = '*firefox3 /usr/lib64/firefox-3.5.8/firefox'  
sage: rt.setup_tests('localhost', False, brow)
sage: rt.run_any()
```
The `setup_tests` step may not be necessary, but I think it helps to give the path to the actual Firefox binary.  See docstrings for a few examples.
