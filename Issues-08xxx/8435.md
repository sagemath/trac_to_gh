You're right. I just upgraded to Selenium 1.0.3 (from 1.0.1) and now they don't all pass.  I'll investigate.

To run the [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/) tests with Firefox, check that Java is installed and [download Selenium RC](http://seleniumhq.org/download/):

```sh
wget http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-remote-control-1.0.3.zip
mkdir selenium
cd selenium
unzip selenium-remote-control-1.0.3.zip
cd selenium-server-1.0.3
java -jar selenium-server.jar
```
To run the SageNB tests, I usually do the following, e.g., in a script:

```python
sage: import sagenb.testing.run_tests as rt
sage: brow = '*firefox3 /usr/lib64/firefox-3.5.8/firefox'  
sage: rt.setup_tests('localhost', False, brow)
sage: rt.run_any()
```
The `setup_tests` step may not be necessary, but I think it helps to give the path to the actual Firefox binary.  See docstrings for a few examples.

I'm going to merge 0.7.5.3 into alpha1 since it seems like the issue is more with the Selenium code than the actual SageNB code.  A ticket can be opened for that.

I agree.  The tests fail because the new Se creates *two* worksheets when we call `selenium.open('/new_worksheet')`.  I don't know if this is a Se bug.
