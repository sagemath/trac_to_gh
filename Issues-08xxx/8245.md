```
In the section, "A Guided Tour"->"Basic Algebra and Calculus"-
>"Euler’s Method for Systems of Differential Equations", I found that

the answer of the example is z(1)≈0.75, which seems to be wrong.

The calculation is
------------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: t,x,y = PolynomialRing(RealField(10),3,"txy").gens()
sage: f = y; g = -x - y * t
sage: eulers_method_2x2(f,g, 0, 1, 0, 1/4, 1)
         t                    x                h*f(t,x,y)                    y           h*g(t,x,y)
         0                    1                      0.00                    0                -0.25
       1/4                  1.0                    -0.062                -0.25                -0.23
       1/2                 0.94                     -0.12                -0.48                -0.17
       3/4                 0.82                     -0.16                -0.66               -0.081
         1                 0.65                     -0.18                -0.74                0.022
------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I think the right answer should be z(1)≈0.65

Curious as to why we have both `:math:` and the backticks... but anyway, that would be a general overhaul of the tutorial.

Within Sage, ``foo`` is equivalent to `:math:`foo``.  In general ReST code, this is not true.
