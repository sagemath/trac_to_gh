and

```
sage: GF(5).extension(x^2 - 2, name='a')
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression' object has no attribute 'list'
```
The patch solves both these problems, and provides a more useful error  message for mistakes like `GF(5).extension("not_a_poly", name='a'),` by  splicing in code from the number field version.

This patch does what it says. It did however take over a bad habit of "extension" for number fields. See the examples below, where I think the behavior of QQ is preferred.

```
sage: QQ.extension(x^2-2, ('a', 'b'))
IndexError: the number of names must equal the number of generators
sage: GF(3).extension(x^2-2, ('a', 'b'))
Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in a over Finite Field of size 3 with modulus a^2 + 1
sage: QuadraticField(-1, 'i').extension(x^2 - 2, ('a', 'b'))
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2 over its base field

sage: QQ.extension(x^2 - 2, ('a', QQ))
ValueError: variable names must be alphanumeric, but one is 'Rational Field' which is not.
sage: GF(3).extension(x^2 - 2, ('a', QQ))
Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in a over Finite Field of size 3 with modulus a^2 + 1
sage: QuadraticField(-1, 'i').extension(x^2 - 2, ('a', QQ))
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2 over its base field
```

All tests pass, and as I said before: the patch does what it claims. I've tried a couple more examples and everything seems fine.

The bad behavior in my previous comment was there for number fields already and I don't consider it to be a blocker for this patch.
