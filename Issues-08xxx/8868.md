Some comments from #8834:
R install guide says:

```
Unless you do not want to view graphs on-screen you need ‘X11’ installed, including its headers and client libraries. For recent Fedora distributions it means (at least) ‘libX11’, ‘libX11-devel’, ‘libXt’ and ‘libXt-devel’. On Debian we recommend the meta-package ‘xorg-dev’. If you really do not want these you will need to explicitly configure R without X11, using --with-x=no.
```
But see [this](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/grDevices/html/Devices.html), which talks about the devices more generally, as well as the R_DEFAULT_DEVICE variable.  In particular, the [pdf](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/grDevices/html/pdf.html) output, or png via the [bitmap](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/grDevices/html/dev2bitmap.html) function, could be platform-independent enough to reinstate doctests for R graphics.  Though the bitmap function apparently needs ghostscript, though, which we also can't always count on being present, I don't think.

Using Sage 4.6.1.alpha0 on my OpenSolaris 06/2009 machine, I just run those two commands given on ask.sagemath.question:

```
sage:  r.eval('capabilities("png")')
'  png \nFALSE '
sage: r.eval('capabilities("X11")')
'  X11 \nFALSE '
sage: 
```

looks like I have neither PNG or X support built in. This is odd. When I check `spkg/logs/r-2.10.1.p4.log` I see:

```
checking if libpng version >= 1.0.5... yes
```

then later 

```
R is now configured for i386-pc-solaris2.11

  Source directory:          .
  Installation directory:    /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.6.1.alpha0/local

  C compiler:                gcc -std=gnu99  -I/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.6.1.alpha0/local/include -L/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.6.1.alpha0/local/lib/
  Fortran 77 compiler:       sage_fortran  -g -O2

  C++ compiler:              g++  -g -O2
  Fortran 90/95 compiler:    sage_fortran -g -O2
  Obj-C compiler:

  Interfaces supported:
  External libraries:        readline
  Additional capabilities:   PNG, JPEG, TIFF, NLS
  Options enabled:           shared R library, shared BLAS, R profiling, Java

  Recommended packages:      yes
```

So despite PNG support apparently built in, `r.eval('capabilities("png")')` indicates otherwise. 

It's difficult to know what to trust. 

Dave
