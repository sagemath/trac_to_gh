Hi alltogether,
I currently work with the sage-4.3.3-linux-64bit-opensuse_11.1_x86_64-x86_64-Linux.tar.gz binary from sagemath.org on SuSE 11.1/x86_64.

```
./sage
./sage -b
```
installs stuff the users PYTHONPATH, not in the corresponding path of sage.

For instance, see:

```
byte-compiling /u/d/dreyer/.local//lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/ext/gen_interpreters.py to gen_interpreters.pyc
running install_egg_info
Writing /u/d/dreyer/.local//lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage-0.0.0-py2.6.egg-info
```

I think, sage should overwrite PYTHONPATH in its own environment, doesn't it?

Regards,
  Alexander Dreyer

Hello, I think this is just the same as #9536. Its fix should cures this problem.

`./sage -b` uses the right path here.

No additional appearance of `PYTHONPATH` in `src/`. Let's assume that the env is always sourced, so the ticket seems invalid to me.
