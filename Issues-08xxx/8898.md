Various files in the sage spkg have dos line ending rather than unix ones.

I found about this while trying to build sage with python-2.6.5
which absolutely refused to parse these files as is.
Not sure how to submit a patch for line endings.

just checked sage/logic/booleval.py is actually in "mac format" in sage-4.4
I will check sage-4.4.1 later.
But those are pure python files, they may be ok but cython with
python-2.6.5 refused to deal with the other 4.

The attached patch converts the following files to use Unix line endings:

* `sage/libs/mpmath/ext_impl.pxd`
* `sage/libs/mpmath/ext_main.pyx`
* `sage/libs/mpmath/ext_main.pxd`
* `sage/libs/mpmath/ext_libmp.pyx`
* `sage/logic/booleval.py`

I used the Perl script at

http://www.obviously.com/tech_tips/dos2unix.html

to convert to Unix end lines. Fredrik Johansson is a main developer of mpmath. I have CC'd him so he is aware of this Unix line endings issue.

* It fails to apply on Sage 4.6.1.alpha0; I got the following failure:

* The attachment [attachment:trac_8898-unix-endlines.2.patch] doesn't convert the file `sage/logic/booleval.py` to use Unix line ending.

My rebased patch should take care of the above issues for Sage 4.6.1.alpha0. See the ticket description for which patch to apply.

4.6.1.alpha0 took me for a little ride.
Anyway, Minh's new patch applies cleanly to 4.6.1.alpha0 and it compiles
cleanly with a python-2.6.5 install as expected. sage starts without problems.
For safety I also did a run of sage -t --long in the sage/libs/mpmath/ and
sage/logic/ and everything ran ok.

I am putting this back to positive review, hopefully no one messed up with those
files in alpha1 so it will apply cleanly there as well.
