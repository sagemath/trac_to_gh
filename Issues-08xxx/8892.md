Hello everybody !!!

I noticed working on something quite different that many doctests were failing in Sage's graph library because of the recent update of NetworkX... The reason is easy : the default edge label is not "None" anymore but {}. Besides, dictionary are not hashable !!!

This patch fixes it !

<a id='comment:1'></a>Apparently now, networkx has moved to having a dictionary of edge attributes, rather than a specific "label".  See http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/api_1.0.html#edge-attributes

I'm not saying we should follow the convention, but it does seem to make sense.  Instead of just storing a single value, store a dict of attributes.

Why is it important that dictionaries are not hashable?

Thanks for uncovering this one.  Not sure right now I have a good idea about what should be done.

However, is there a patch to go on this?  I'm not seeing one.
