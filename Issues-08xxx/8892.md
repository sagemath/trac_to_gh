Hello everybody !!!

I noticed working on something quite different that many doctests were failing in Sage's graph library because of the recent update of NetworkX... The reason is easy : the default edge label is not "None" anymore but {}. Besides, dictionary are not hashable !!!

This patch fixes it !

Apparently now, networkx has moved to having a dictionary of edge attributes, rather than a specific "label".  See http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/api_1.0.html#edge-attributes

I'm not saying we should follow the convention, but it does seem to make sense.  Instead of just storing a single value, store a dict of attributes.

Why is it important that dictionaries are not hashable?

A little farther down the networkx page listed, we find http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/api_1.0.html#converting-your-existing-code-to-networkx-1-0, which says that now all algorithms (in Networkx) look for the "weight" edge attribute.

Sounds like that would be a huge change for Sage code, though...

Hi Nathann,

Thanks for uncovering this one.  Not sure right now I have a good idea about what should be done.

However, is there a patch to go on this?  I'm not seeing one.

Not yet. For the moment, my patch is a nasty one : replaces tests "is None" by "is None or == {}". I thought it may be better to settle on what we want to do with these labels, but I can upload it otherwise (somewhere on another computer at the moment) :-)
