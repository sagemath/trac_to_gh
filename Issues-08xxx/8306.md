Along with a primed [ccache](http://ccache.samba.org/), compiling multiple spkgs in parallel may significantly speed up Sage builds on multicore machines.  See [sage-release](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_thread/thread/4c915ae814dd6514) for some information.

To build multiple spkgs in parallel:

* Start with Sage 4.4.4.
* Update [attachment:makefile], `spkg/`[attachment:install], and `spkg/standard/`[attachment:deps].
* Copy [attachment:pipestatus] to `spkg/`.
* Copy the latest spkgs from #8645 (Maxima), #9185 (Singular), #9186 (R), and #9264 (ECL) to `spkg/standard`.
* `export SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD="yes"`
* `export MAKE="make -jX"` where `X > 1`
* `make`

Also:

* Apply [attachment:trac_8306_scripts-spkg_log_files.2.patch] to the scripts repository.  This makes `sage -i foo-X.Y.spkg` *also* append to `spkg/logs/foo-X.Y.log`.

* Apply [attachment:trac_8306_scripts-pipestatus.patch] to the scripts repository.  This ensures that `sage -sdist <VERSION>` includes `pipestatus` in a new Sage source distribution.

Oops.  That was an attempt at humor.

I don't know why the build fails.  [Here's a log](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/8306/eclib-20080310.p9.log) from building eclib with `+`.

A possibly related problem is that the top-level make doesn't notice the error.  It keeps going until "Sage build/upgrade complete!".  I'll see what happens if I add `$(INST)/$(ECLIB)` to "all"'s list of dependencies.

I didn't write eclib's spkg-install, and I know that several people have changed it in the past -- there's at least one ticket out there specifically about managing eclib's Makefiles.

Thanks!  I'll get an account on bsd and try to test on both bsd and t2, as well.

`SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD` looks good.

My motivation for making the new feature optional, for now, is so we can get feedback (via sage-devel) from early testers about a much wider range of build conditions and configurations.  It's likely they'll report problems, and we can attempt to solve them before we make it the default for everyone.

Again, against 4.3.3 on sage.math, this appears to work well.  With `SAGE_CHECK="yes"`, I get the same known errors

```
     sage: An error occurred while testing sagetex-2.2.3
     sage: An error occurred while testing pyprocessing-0.52.p0
     sage: An error occurred while testing sqlalchemy-0.4.6.p1
```
with and without parallel spkg builds.  All the docs build and the long doctests pass.

Against 4.3.0.1 on t2: It builds and runs --- I used a stand-in atlas spkg that just copies the files from the [existing binary build](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/sage/solaris/index.html).  "Several" doctests still fail or segfault.  With `SAGE_CHECK="yes"`, I get the known testing errors, a known testing error with eclib (see #8357),  and *maybe* a testing error with R.  I ran out of patience with the latter.  I don't have time to test further on t2 / *Solaris.  It's probably better that someone else test with 4.3.3+ on a capable machine.

If I have time (and an account), I'll run a few tests on `bsd.math`.

Note: With `SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD="yes"`, I find it useful to run one of

```sh
grep "An error occurred" SAGE_ROOT/install.log
ls -l SAGE_ROOT/spkg/installed | wc
```
when I see `"Sage build/upgrade complete!"`.  Maybe we should add a similar check at the end of `install`?

Please test and let us know what happens.  I didn't log detailed statistics, but with a warm compiler cache, I noticed a roughly three-fold speedup.  From a recent run on sage.math:

```
Sage build/upgrade complete!

What exactly is a "warm compiler cache" ? A Google on the term only shows only references to Sage.

Please see the [documentation](http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/make/MAKE-Variable.html) (and the bottom of [this page](http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/make/Error-Messages.html#Error-Messages)) for an exceptionally clear explanation. :)
 
-* In order to determine which commands could "handle" `+`, I prefixed them all and went through many build / test / edit cycles on sage.math.  Besides the setuptools packages (see below), the packages that are not built with `+` are atlas, ecl, maxima, R, and singular.  Note: It may be possible to build in parallel without any plus signs, but when I try this, I get an error with palp.

 * I put packages installed by setuptools (twisted, zodb, pygments, jinja, jinja2, sphinx, sqlalchemy, sagenb) in a linear chain, because setuptools does not consistently update `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python/site-packages/easy-install.pth` in parallel.

The problem is that the exit status `$?` of

```sh
$(SAGE_SPKG) $(FOO) 2>&1 | tee -a $(SAGE_LOGS)/$(FOO).log
```
is the exit status of `tee`, but we need the exit status of `sage-spkg`.  (I found some other workarounds [here](http://www.unix.com/shell-programming-scripting/92163-command-does-not-return-exit-status-due-tee.html).)  We can get this with `$PIPESTATUS` in `bash`.  We could add a helper script somewhere that runs the pipeline and exits with the status of `sage-spkg`.

Or we could use

```sh
$(SAGE_SPKG) $(FOO) 2>&1 | tee -a $(SAGE_LOGS)/$(FOO).log | grep "sage: An error occurred while"
```
if we test the status of `grep`.  The `sage-spkg` script prints this error string when `spkg-install` or `spkg-check` fails.   We could also print the string in a few other places in `sage-spkg` (search for `exit 1`).

Thoughts?

I have a helper script that I'm testing.  So far, it's working well, *if* I force palp to build serially.  The spkg at #8477 does this.

See my comment on #329. The problem with md5 is that there is no standard command for getting the md5 checksum. I've seen

* md5
* md5sum
* digest -a md5 ('digest' is part of OpenSSL, and is what I use on Solaris)

It is not a standard POSIX command. In contrast, 'cksum' is much more portable, as it is defined by POSIX. 

http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/cksum.html

It is a 32-bit bit number, so the probability of an error not being detected is around 2.3 x 10^-10.  

Avoid using 'sum' - that is not portable, as the algorithm is implementation dependent. 

Dave

Running "sage -sdist" with these changes doesn't work because pipestatus doesn't get copied over.  The patch "trac_8306_scripts-pipestatus.patch" fixes this.

I was able to successfully build this on sage.math, but I had problems on my mac (with two cores, using "make -j2").  I think it's with singular; I get lots of lines like

```
sage/libs/singular/singular.cpp:162:21: error: factory.h: No such file or directory
```
It seems to be building singular at the same time as the main Sage spkg; does that sound okay?

The `bash` ChangeLog states it was introduced in version 3.0-alpha.

To avoid side effects, the setting should be done just for a/the subshell, i.e. replacing

```
    cmd1 | cmd2 | ... | cmdN | tee logfile
```
by

```
    (set -o pipefail; cmd1 | cmd2 | ... | cmdN | tee logfile)
```

Sufficiently recent versions of bash should at least be *available* for all OSs currently supported by Sage (including OS X).

Recent versions may be available, but we don't necessarily want to require people to install a newer version of bash just to use Sage.  So (if for example OS X 10.4 is officially supported by Sage) we would have to write a script that tests the version of bash (using `${BASH_VERSINFO[0]`}, I guess), and if less than 3, then do something else.

Or since parallel building is an enhancement, I suppose we could make bash 3 a prerequisite for it.  We would have to write SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/deps in a way which works with all versions, though.

Well, `bash` 3.0 was released nearly six years ago (and there are pre-built binaries of it available), so I'd say it *should* be OK to make it a prerequisite - it's central and ubiquitous, and I'd call 2.x deprecated.

But that's only *my* opinion, though in general I'd prefer omitting as much GNUism as possible, trying to stay within POSIX scope (which for example the shell's `trap` mechanism is).

I read that comment to be about "set -o" with no further options, not about "set -o OPTION". "pipefail" is documented here, by the way:

 http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#The-Set-Builtin

I don't see anything wrong with bashisms, as long as we have #!/usr/bin/env bash at the top of the file. In any case, I'm happy for *any* solution to the pipe situation here: in a command of the form ($1) | ($2), we want the exit code of ($1).

I'm posting experimental versions of pipestatus and deps which test for the bash version and if at least 3, use pipefail.

By the way, I still can't get singular and ecl to compile on my iMac if SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD is set to "yes". Any help with that issue would be appreciated.

It appears that `deps-new` is based on a version of `deps` that predates the [latest] version at

* http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/8306/

(last modified on 8 March).  Is there a particular reason for this?

I've attached updated versions of `deps`, `install`, and `pipestatus` to accompany the `makefile` and the two `trac_8306_scripts-*` patches.  With these and the forthcoming spkgs at #9185, #9186, and #9187, I can build 4.4.4.alpha0 with SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD="yes"`.

-* I put packages installed by setuptools (twisted, zodb, pygments, jinja, jinja2, sphinx, sqlalchemy, sagenb) in a linear chain, because setuptools does not consistently update `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python/site-packages/easy-install.pth` in parallel.
+To build multiple spkgs in parallel:
 
-* I dropped mpir from gap's dependencies (see [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/c97a99f23ea576b7)).
-
-To test the changes:
-
-* Update `spkg/install` and `spkg/standard/deps` from [here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/8306).
-* Copy [pipestatus](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/8306/pipestatus) to `spkg/`.
-* Add #8357's `eclib-*.spkg`.
-* Add #8477's `palp-*.spkg`.
+* Start with Sage 4.4.4.alpha0.
+* Update [attachment:makefile], `spkg/`[attachment:install], and `spkg/standard/`[attachment:deps].
+* Copy [attachment:pipestatus] to `spkg/`.
+* Copy the latest spkgs from #8731 (Maxima), #9185 (Singular), #9186 (R), and #9187 (ECL) to `spkg/standard`.
 * `export SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD="yes"`
 * `export MAKE="make -jX"` where `X > 1`

From R's `make check` on t2:

Running examples in package ‘stats’
Error: testing 'stats' failed

Some detail from `src/tests/Examples/stats-Ex.Rout.fail`:

Error in .Diag(levels, sparse = sparse) :

According to [this log](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/8306/r-2.10.1.p2.log), R's Matrix package isn't built/installed successfully on t2:

```
Loading required package: Matrix

  ld.so.1: R: fatal: libgcc_s.so.1: open failed: No such file or directory
Error : require(Matrix, save = FALSE) is not TRUE
```
An alternative is to compare the output of `ls SAGE_LOCAL/lib/R/library` on non-#8306 sage.math and t2 builds.  I think we're also missing class, mgcv, nnet, rpart, spatial, and survival on t2.

But I think this is independent of this ticket --- see, e.g., `/rootpool2/local/kirkby/sage-4.4.3/install.log` on t2.

For what it's worth, I think that your "diff" files for deps and install are backwards, showing the diffs from the new version to the old, rather than from the old to the new.

The deps file is a bit off: first, under the target "all", `$(INST)/$(SAGENB)` is listed, but it's not in the "real" version of deps.  I think this is good, and I think it's a bug in the version of deps distributed with Sage.  Other targets are missing from "all", though:

```
  $(INST)/$(JINJA)
  $(INST)/$(JINJA2)
  $(INST)/$(PYGMENTS)
  $(INST)/$(SPHINX)
  $(INST)/$(SQLALCHEMY)
  $(INST)/$(TWISTED)
  $(INST)/$(TWISTEDWEB2)
```  
Also, the following lines are missing:

```
$(INST)/$(TWISTEDWEB2): $(INST)/$(TWISTED)
	$(INSTALL) "$(SAGE_SPKG) $(TWISTEDWEB2) 2>&1" "tee -a $(SAGE_LOGS)/$(TWISTEDWEB2).log"
```
I'm attaching "deps-new" and "deps-new.diff" to fix this.

I mentioned twistedweb2 in an [older version of the description](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/8306?action=diff&version=70&old_version=3).

Maybe we should add the missing targets (Sphinx, etc.) at #9274?  It does seem better to be explicit about the dependencies.
