This is in devel/sage/sage/graphs/graph.py:

```
class Graph(GenericGraph):
    r"""
    Undirected graph.

    A graph is a set of vertices connected by edges
    (cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics) ).
```

If you look at http://sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/graphs/graph.html and search for "mathematics", then click the link, you'll see it is broken.  Fix this by:

1. fixing sphinx?  too tricky, maybe

2. finding sphinx docs and figuring out how to explicitly specify a URL.

Apply patches in the following order:

1. [trac_8786-wikipedia-links.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8786/trac_8786-wikipedia-links.patch)

And here are a few more corrections (to be applied on top of Minh's)... Some were not a problem as they contained no parenthesis, but as I had an Emacs macro available... :-)

By the way, I noticed something funny while working on this patch :

```
~/sage/sage-doc/sage/graphs$ grep -e "def.*eedback" *
digraph.py:    def feedback_edge_set(self,value_only=False):
digraph.py:    def feedback_vertex_set(self,value_only=False):
generic_graph.py:    def feedback_edge_set(self,value_only=False):
generic_graph.py:    def feedback_vertex_set(self,value_only=False):
~/sage/sage-doc/sage/graphs$ 
```

It must have occurred during the splitting of graph.py... I'll create another ticket to take care of it :-)

* [trac_8786-wikipedia-links.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8786/trac_8786-wikipedia-links.patch)

And there is nothing wrong to report on alpha2. And I did not notice any other link we could have missed in the documentation :-)
