How to get monomial with large exponent in the polynomial rings?

For example I hsave polynomial ring over large finite field:
p = next_prime(10^20)
R.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(p), sparse=True)

Monomial x^(10^7) construction takes 2 seconds:
time tmp = x^(10^7)

Monomial x^(10^8) construction uses all 6 Gb server memory and cannot
finish.
And without 'sparse=True' option I cannot even get x^(10^6).

What is the limitations for monomial exponents in polynomial rings?
What can be done in my case? For example GAP handles this case without
any problem.

Seems like the sparse=True flag is horribly broken for GF(p)[x]:

sage: p = next_prime(10^20)
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(p), sparse=True)
sage: type(x)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_zz_pex.Polynomial_ZZ_pEX'>

sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ, sparse=True)
sage: x^(10^8)
x^100000000

I don't have the grand overview of this, but it seems that simply adding the condition to only use NTL whenever sparse=False works and was the original intention. I'm uploading the (simple) patch for this, so you can see what I mean.

This patch seems ok to me, but could you please add some doctest to show the bug is gone?

I also opened another ticket for the pAdics problem ( #9929 ).
