There is a problem with this patch, in that tests for CCFLAG64, not CFLAG64 as others do. So it needs work. 

However, there are other problems with ratpoints that I am aware of. It is using the compiler option 

```
-DUSE_SSE 
```

on SPARC, even though the SPARC processor has no SSE instructions. That does not appear to be a serious issue, but ratpoints has been implicated as the reason the Sage library does not build - see #7867, which is **very** serious.

It might be better if you leave this one to me to try to sort out, as the SPARC issues are more serious.

Ok, I can do that though CFLAG64 is not used in this spkg.

Yes, please solve the problems on SPARC, but that is certainly an other ticket.
Let this spkg work on Open Solaris x64 is the only issue solved with this ticket.

Sorry, I should have noted this earlier, but the package says 

"Building with extra 64-bit flags for OS X and Open Solaris"

Whereas a more accurate description would be 

"Building with the compiler flag(s) $CFLAG64 for a 64-bit build"

Hopefully this should work at the very least on Solaris 10, and hopefully other platforms such as Cygwin, perhaps HP-UX and/or AIX.

I would avoid mentioning Solaris specifically unless it is necessary. In this case it is not.

It is very much a Sage goal. There is every reason to believe a Solaris 10 port will be 64-bit. The only reason the port was first 32-bit is that gcc tends to be less reliable on 64-bit SPARC. 

It could even beat the Open Solaris port, though my interest is more in Open Solaris now.
