This is a work in progress.




>  - there is a typo in one of the links (found by using "sage -docbuild faq linkcheck", which I just discovered!).  This is fixed in my small patch.  


Thank you.




>  - should this be added to the "website" docbuild target?  (I'm not sure; arguments could be made either way, I think.)


The docbuild target "faq" is automatically added. The index.html page of the website has been changed to include the FAQ.




>  - this document doesn't match up very well with the FAQ on the wiki.  Why?


The FAQ on the Sage wiki is a mess. The current ticket is an attempt to pull together information from the FAQ on the wiki and other sources. The resulting information is then to be organized following the model of the [Django FAQ](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/faq/).
