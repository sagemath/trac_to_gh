I don't know if this is ready for review yet, but here are a few comments:

- there is a typo in one of the links (found by using "sage -docbuild faq linkcheck", which I just discovered!).  This is fixed in my small patch.  

- should this be added to the "website" docbuild target?  (I'm not sure; arguments could be made either way, I think.)

- this document doesn't match up very well with the FAQ on the wiki.  Why?

Thank you.




> - should this be added to the "website" docbuild target?  (I'm not sure; arguments could be made either way, I think.)

The docbuild target "faq" is automatically added. The index.html page of the website has been changed to include the FAQ.




> - this document doesn't match up very well with the FAQ on the wiki.  Why?

The FAQ on the Sage wiki is a mess. The current ticket is an attempt to pull together information from the FAQ on the wiki and other sources. The resulting information is then to be organized following the model of the [Django FAQ](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/faq/).

The documents build without error and they look good, in both html and pdf.  I have a few comments about the content:

- in faq-general.rst, at the end: do we need to include instructions for building the documentation, since it is downloadable, included in any binary distribution, and automatically built when building any source distribution?  Note that you can also build the docs using

```
make doc   or    make doc-html

Also in the same part, in the spirit of #21 and standard GNU-style command line options, how about changing `sage -docbuild ...` to `sage --docbuild ...`, and similarly for `sage -help` and `sage -advanced`?  (Same issue with "you need to invoke Sage with the option ``-python``" in faq-usage.rst, and perhaps elsewhere -- I haven't done a careful search.)

- for faq-usage.rst, the prerequisites: should we mention LaTeX as a suggested package?

If I hit the "index" button on the top right, a page appears with a link to "Full index on one page  (can be huge)", which then yields a blank page. It also happens in the thematic tutorials, as they don't add words from the faq to the index.

That's perfectly normal, so I give a positive review.
