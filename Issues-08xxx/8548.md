Obviously, the instructions

```
pp = Permutation([3, 1, 2])
pp.hyperoctahedral_double_coset_type()
```
lead to an error because the permutation has an odd size. However, there is an error in the raised error message : 

```
NameError: global name 'p' is not defined
```
The string should be

```
ValueError: [3, 1, 2] is a permutation of odd size and has no coset-type
```
