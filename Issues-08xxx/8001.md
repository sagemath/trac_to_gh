I'm uploading a small trivial review patch. Here are the comment:
- Add a missing "`";
- Improve the layout of an enumeration;
- replace `ZZ._tester` with `QQ._tester` to show that the gadget is automatically attached (Noting to do with the previous call on `ZZ`.

Otherwise the patch is ready to go. 

Nicolas: You can add positive review once you had a look on my review patch.
