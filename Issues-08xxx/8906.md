Here is a (new) spkg which contains Jean Michel's "pre-packaged GAP3 with everything you need". From his webpage:

  To help people who are just interested in GAP3 because they need a package which has not been ported to GAP4, I have prepared an easy-to install minimal GAP3 distribution containing an up-to-date versions of the packages:

  anusq, arep, autag, chevie, cryst, dce, grim, matrix, meataxe, monoid, nq, pcqa, sisyphos, specht, ve, vkcurve.

  These packages have been chosen since most have no equivalent in GAP4. They are autoloaded when starting gap.This distribution includes only partial lists of small groups, 2-groups, 3-groups, character tables from the Atlas and tables of marks. It does not include either the packages:

  anupq, grape, kbmag, xgap, cohomolo, gliss, guava, xmod

  which have some equivalent in GAP4. You can get these extra features at

Thanks a lot for the package, and a good example of how to write `spkg-install` in Python.

Here are a few comments:
* Version numbers for the GAP4 package are of the form gap-4.4.10.p17, so we should name this gap.3.4.4.p0 and keep increasing the "patch level" at the end for updates.
* The package has a single mercurial repository at the top, which contains spkg-install, SPKG.txt, etc. and the GAP3 source files. The convention is to keep two separate repositories, one with only "packaging" material, spkg-install and so on, another one to track changes to the upstream sources.
* Does GAP3 have a test suite? Can we add an spkg-check which runs this? Another option is to copy the spkg-check which just tries to start GAP from the spkg mentioned in[comment:9](#comment%3A9):ticket:8380.
* SPKG.txt should be based on the template here: http://wiki.sagemath.org/spkgTemplate
  In particular:
  * the changelog should have an entry conforming to the standard
  * TODO list (in the file TODO) should be moved in the SPKG.txt
  * There should be an explanation of what changes were made to the upstream sources, even though they are already documented in the mercurial repository log.
  * SPKG.txt should note that src/bin/gap.sh hardcodes version `gap3r4p4` in the `GAP_DIR` variable
* I don't see why these lines at the end of `spkg-install` are necessary:
 {{{
 if not os.path.exists(gap3_base):
     os.makedirs(gap3_base)
 }}}

Fair enough, I didn't check these again myself. Note that the COPYING file doesn't exist in the original gap3 distribution. We decided to make one after it took us a while to discover the license has a non-commercial use restriction.

>  1. The directory `src/` contains one package within another:


This is just how the gap3 source is laid out. There are gap library files, and gap packages in the other directories. I don't see why this is a problem.

What is in the spkg is very far from the original gap3 distribution. The changes couldn't be tracked with patches, so there is a mercurial repository in the src directory.

Could you document that in the file `SPKG.txt`? Future reviewers/maintainers might not know about this.

As you can tell, I raised the above objections because the file `SPKG.txt` did not document the reasons why the spkg was structured as given.

Hi!

Thanks Marco for your work!

With Jean-Michel, we have merged Marco's changes into our original spkg (with the changes to the sources upstreamed in Jean's distribution). We will upload the result shortly here.

About the spkg name. Since the gap3 spkg is completely different from the gap4 one, and is supposed to cohabit with it, I would argue for calling the spkg gap3-???? to make a clear distinction. It is further based on Jean's gap3 distribution. So, would you recommend:
calling it `gap3-jm2.spkg` or `gap3-3.4.4-jm2.spkg` ?

Jean would prefer the first option, since anyway gap3's version has not changed since 1997, and won't ever change again.

Hi!

I just obtained the following with gap3 on winxp1 (win XP + cygwin host in the Sage build farm):

```
gap> W := CoxeterGroup("E",8);
CoxeterGroup("E",8)
gap> Size(W);                
696729600
```

For the record: I did not have Sage installed, so I did not try directly the spkg. Instead, I built and ran it by hand, using something like:

```
tar xvf gap3-jm2.spkg
cd gap3-jm2/src/src
make ibm-i386-linux-gcc
cd ..
cp src/gap.exe bin
<EDIT bin/gap.sh>
bin/gap.sh
```

In bin/gap.sh, I set GAP_PRG=gap.exe, and downgraded GAP_MEM=512m to GAP_MEM=64m (otherwise I was getting an error Gasman: can not get memory for the initial workspace).

So I assume that it should be easy to adapt the spkg to also work on windows+cygwin once sage will be more publicly available there (windows 7 still to be tested).

To get yourself up and running quickly without waiting for this spkg to be finalized, just install GAP3 system-wide using one of the following options and you should be good to go.

From what I gather from [Frank Leubeck's site](http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/gap/GAP3/index.html):
* Frank Leubeck's package includes some optimizations and is statically linked;
* Jean Michel's version has a newer version of CHEVIE;
* Andrew Mathas provided a Makefile target to compile GAP3 on Mac OSX machines.

I guess these should all be combined at some point?

I'm adding Andrew Mathas to the CC list. Andrew, what is your opinion on this?

OK, so besides the fact that I don't know what I am doing, I think this is ready for review.

Here is what you have to do to test this.

1. Checkout this branch: use your favourite method; for instance, with git-trac,

```
git trac checkout 8906
```

2. Download the upstream tarball http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~jean.michel/gap3/gap3-jm5.tar.gz and copy it into `SAGE_ROOT/upstream`; or just run the following commands:

```
cd $(sage --root)/upstream
curl -O http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~jean.michel/gap3/gap3-jm5.tar.gz
```

3. Install the spkg:

```
sage -i gap3
```

**Question:** where do I put the upstream tarball so that people don't have to do step 2?

This is not an issue with the proposed SPKG. In fact, it is a problem even with the first proposed SPKG from Marco Robado.

So this should be a separate ticket.

Edit: I created a ticket: #18971.

-Here is an spkg wich contains a patched version of gap3 that compiles on linux/x86 and macosx/x86.
+Here is a (new) spkg which contains Jean Michel's "pre-packaged GAP3 with everything you need". From his webpage:
 
-[http://thales.math.uqam.ca/~robado/gap3-0.3.spkg](http://thales.math.uqam.ca/~robado/gap3-0.3.spkg)
+  To help people who are just interested in GAP3 because they need a package which has not been ported to GAP4, I have prepared an easy-to install minimal GAP3 distribution containing an up-to-date versions of the packages:
 
-Jean's spkg merged with the above:
+  anusq, arep, autag, chevie, cryst, dce, grim, matrix, meataxe, monoid, nq, pcqa, sisyphos, specht, ve, vkcurve.
 
-[http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nthiery/gap3-jm2.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nthiery/gap3-jm2.spkg)
+  These packages have been chosen since most have no equivalent in GAP4. They are autoloaded when starting gap.This distribution includes only partial lists of small groups, 2-groups, 3-groups, character tables from the Atlas and tables of marks. It does not include either the packages:
+
+  anupq, grape, kbmag, xgap, cohomolo, gliss, guava, xmod
+
+  which have some equivalent in GAP4. You can get these extra features at
