The comment in SPKG.txt is inaccurate, as the patch is not specific to Open Solaris.

A more accurate comment would be. 

* #8097 Ensures the compiler flag -m64 is added at any time SAGE64 was set to "yes" - previously this was only happening on OS X. This should aid building 64-bit on any platform, although it has only been tested on Open Solaris. 

It's far better to open a ticket for the bug first, before trying to fix it. Then the ticket number can be placed in the comments in SPKG.txt. 

It would be good to see some evidence the patch actually works. Such as by showing the output of the 'ldd' command, that the library and/or binary is now a 64-bit one. For some packages, it is unnecessary to add -m64 and for others, adding it does not generate 64-bit binaries. 

For zlib, adding -m64 stops the build of shared libraries.

Changed SPKG.txt to reflect the comments from David.

No change of patch level applied.

termcap only builds a static library local/lib/libtermcap.a containing

64 bit *.o files (I double checked that).
