Try the following:

```
sage: name
'KodairaSymbol'
sage: type(name)
<type 'str'>
```

I'm not sure where this gets imported, but it seems wrong.

It's coming from near line 150 in `sage/all.py`: 

```
#Deprecate the is_* functions from the top level
#All of these functions should be removed from the top level
#after a few releases, and this code should be removed.
#--Mike Hansen 9/25/2008
globs = globals()
from functools import wraps, partial
for name,func in globs.items():
```

... but then `name` and `func` are never deleted. (Ahh, scoping in Python.) Sure enough, `func` is defined, too:

```
sage: func
<function KodairaSymbol at 0x10940daa0>
```

So I'm attaching an obvious patch -- there might be something classier, but this works. (And yes, this is still necessary in Py3.)

After applying the patch, `sage -t` gives the same 22 failures as with vanilla 4.3.3
(see #7773). However it would be good to add one test to check that `name` and `func`
are undefined at start.

I've added a test and a new version of the patch.
