When one does sage -f (or -i) from a remote location, the
spkg file is not stored locally in the appropriate place,
even if an upgrade of a standard spkg has taken place.
As a result, the script spkg/standard/newest_version may fail
to detect that the upgrade has taken place.

As a solution, one can either store the full downloaded spkg, or
just a placeholder with (almost) the same name as the spkg file.

Or, perhaps, sage -i (-f) can call spkg/standard/newest_version to see if an upgrade is happening, and act accordingly.

This bug has cost me and wdj hours of wasted time, see #8229.

in a nutshell, newest_version should not be used for these tasks, 
and a new script has to be written.
