The doc of `words.CharacteristicSturmianWord` says :

```
INPUT:
-  ``cf`` - an iterator outputting integers (thought of as a
               continued fraction)
```

But it does not do what it says. In fact the following 

```
sage: cf = CFF(1/golden_ratio^2)
sage: words.CharacteristicSturmianWord(cf)
word: 0010001001000100010010001001000100010010...
```

should output the same as

```
sage: words.FibonacciWord()
word: 0100101001001010010100100101001001010010...
```

I reviewed this patch and made the following minor modifications, mostly in the documentation:
- I gave three different equivalent definitions of characteristic Sturmian word as presented in the Lothaire book.
- I changed the name of the variable `cf` for `slope` in the characteristic Sturmian.
- I modified the NotImplementedError raised by the three functions by a ValueError. It seems more appropriate since values of slope are in general assumed to be in (0,1). Sébastien, if you still insist on keeping NotImplementedError, I would put a different message, something like "not implemented for values out of (0,1)"
- I made other minor changes and updated the examples in consequence.
All tests passed, the code seems good and correct the problem mentionned in this ticket. The doc is alright too.
