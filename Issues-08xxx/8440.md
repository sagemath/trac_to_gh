Further down the log, the fact the _multiprocessing module has failed to build is clearly stated:

```
Failed to find the necessary bits to build these modules:
_bsddb		   _hashlib		_ssl
_tkinter	   bsddb185		gdbm
linuxaudiodev	   ossaudiodev
To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.


Failed to build these modules:
_curses		   _curses_panel	_multiprocessing
```

The solution to this problem is found in the old pyprocessing package, where it says:

```
#   HAVE_FD_TRANSFER
#     Set this to 1 to compile functions for transferring file
#     descriptors between processes over an AF_UNIX socket using a
#     control message with type SCM_RIGHTS.  On Unix the pickling of 
#     of socket and connection objects depends on this feature.
#
#     If you get errors about missing CMSG_* macros then you should
#     set this to 0.
```

This is not as well documented in Python's setup.py, but by setting 

```
HAVE_FD_TRANSFER=0
```

in Python's top-level setup.py, the problem goes away. Python's build then reports:

```
Failed to build these modules:
_curses		_curses_panel
```
The _multiprocessing module is now building ok. 

The new setup.py has a Solaris-specific section, which I added. However, so reviewers can be even more confident this will only affect Solaris, the patch is only applied on Solaris. 

I also took time to address a minor issue at #8356, where '--without-libpng' was used, despite the fact the option is no longer recognised. 

 == Notes for Release Manager ==
**Prerequisites:**

* #7867 (This already has positive review)

This patch should be applied on top of the changes at #7867

Once this ticket is closed, #8356 may be closed too. 

It would be appreciated if #8374, #8375, 8391 and #8404 could also be integrated into the next alpha, as that would have a high probability of allowing all doc tests to pass. All these tickets have positive review.

Hi Minh, 
I need to go out very soon and get a train, so don't have time to fully investigate this, but there appears there may be something wrong on the math's computer setup, as what I am putting there, and what I can see in the browser are not the same. (This could be the fact the ZIL log is disabled - complex story, and one I need to discuss again with William). 


There **should** be a .spkg in the directory http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/portability/python-2.6.4.p7/ 

which does (for me at least) **not** have any such file or problem. There **should** be a directory below that where I extracted the file. But when I look with the browser, I can **not**  see any of it! So in summary. 

* I don't see the problem you do. 
* Changes I am making on the file system do not appear to be reflected in what I can see from my browser. 

If you look at this location, you might find the package, but I'm totally confused. I think the file system might be messed up. 

```
kirkby@t2:[/home/kirkby/portability/python-2.6.4.p7] $ ls 
python-2.6.4.p7       python-2.6.4.p7.spkg
kirkby@t2:[/home/kirkby/portability/python-2.6.4.p7] $ 
```

I will have to look later, as I need to go out now.

I managed to look at this in more detail today. The reason the directory was not visable was a permissions problem, and nothing to do with file system errors. 

I still can't understand why you see this odd file, as I don't:

```
kirkby@sage:~/portability/python-2.6.4.p7/python-2.6.4.p7$ ls patches/locale.pyc
ls: cannot access patches/locale.pyc: No such file or directory
kirkby@sage:~/portability/python-2.6.4.p7/python-2.6.4.p7$ hg status

Minh, 

could you double- check you are using the same package as me, since I simply can't see this spurious file.
