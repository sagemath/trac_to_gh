These patches depend on the "v2" patch at #8486.
         
Please look this patch over. I think I've tested all the execution paths and have everything working, but I only tested it on one system, so it needs some review and testing.

A design decision that needs to be addressed: it's easiest to just do `subprocess.call()`, which waits for the command to finish; there are a few places where the `os.system` call ended with `&` to put the command in the background. I can reproduce that behavior with the subprocess module, but it's not as convenient, since I have to spawn the process and poll and so on. I can't detect much of a pattern or necessity to those places that possibly put the command in the background; is it okay if we just eliminate that option?

Another issue: the viewer commands from `misc.viewer` on Linux all return strings with a space in them: `'sage-native-execute xdg-open'`, which does not play nicely with subprocess; when you put that string into its call list, it tries to execute a single command with a space in it, named "sage-native-execute xdg-open" and this does not work well. It's easy enough to snag the "xdg-open" part, but if we eventually are using subprocess everywhere, we should switch the viewer commands to returning lists of strings.

Overall, it looks good.

I think line 615, `debug=True` should be deleted.  I also think that before line 1793

```
print 'viewer: "{0}"'.format(viewer)
```
we should have `if debug:`

I notice that you don't seem to be using "base" in the switch from 

```
lt = 'cd "%s"&& sage-native-execute %s \\\\nonstopmode \\\\input{%s.tex} %s'%(base, command, filename, redirect)
```
to

```
lt = ['sage-native-execute', command, r'\nonstopmode', r'\input{' + filename + '.tex}'] 
```
But it seems to work with your patch, so I guess it's okay.

> is it okay if we just eliminate that [background] option?

If "s" is the output of one of these commands, can we do s.split() to turn it into a list, split at spaces (if there are any)?  Oh, I guess that's what you're doing.

Summary: fix the debugging issues (the print statement), and document the fact that "do_in_background" now has no effect, and I think this is ready to go.
