I'm missing in Sage a function equivalent to "readdata" in Maple,
which reads a file with one object per line, and convert it to a
list of the given type. Here is a tentative implementation:

```
def readdata(f,typ):
   fp = open(f,"r")
   l = []
   while true:
      s = fp.readline()
      if s == '':
         break
      l.append(typ(s))
   fp.close()
   return l
```
For example readdata("integers", ZZ) will read a file containing one
integer per line, and convert it to a list of integers. One could
also extend the function to read n objects per line.

If a similar function already exists in Sage, please forgive me.

The function name might be renamed to read_data.

I'd like to propose a patch, but since I never created a new function in Sage I don't know in
which file I should add this function (and how to do so that it is available to the user).
Should I add it in a specialized package (like io)? Any advice would be welcome.
Should I add it in misc/misc.py??

Sounds like a useful addition to me. Are you saying this will only read in files for which data entries are separated by newline characters? It seems to me that this could be made more general rather easily, though without more details it is hard to say how exactly.

In any case, I would like to suggest adding it to the interfaces subdirectory.

ok, I have prepared a patch with a new file interfaces/readdata.py. However hg_sage.diff()
does not show this new file. How to tell Mercurial to consider it?

For portability, it might be better to use Python for the doctests: something like

```
sage: f = open("in.data", "w")
sage: f.write("17\n42")
sage: f.close()
   etc.
```
Also, line 29, `[17. 42]` looks suspicious: should that period be a comma?

tested it on 4.3.5. A minor issue is that in the documentation f.write("17\n42") is split

not quite. It solves the line break problem, but "17\n42\n" appears as "17n42n" in the ascii
documentation. Anyway this is a different issue, since it also happens with (for example):

```
sage: from sage.combinat.matrices.latin import *
sage: B = back_circulant(4)
sage: B.find_disjoint_mates?
```
where `print B0, "\n,\n", B1` appears as `print B0, "n,n", B1`.

To reviewers and release manager: only apply the last patch `trac_8156b.patch`.

It saves a lot of headache for a program to clean up after itself. This happens when you exit a Sage session; temporary files/directories created under `SAGE_TMP` would automatically be deleted when Sage exits. So there's no need to explicitly delete stuff under `SAGE_TMP`.
