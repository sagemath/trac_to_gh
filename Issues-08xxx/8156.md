I'm missing in Sage a function equivalent to "readdata" in Maple,
which reads a file with one object per line, and convert it to a
list of the given type. Here is a tentative implementation:

```
def readdata(f,typ):
   fp = open(f,"r")
   l = []
   while true:
      s = fp.readline()
      if s == '':
         break
      l.append(typ(s))
   fp.close()
   return l
```
For example readdata("integers", ZZ) will read a file containing one
integer per line, and convert it to a list of integers. One could
also extend the function to read n objects per line.

If a similar function already exists in Sage, please forgive me.

The function name might be renamed to read_data.

I'd like to propose a patch, but since I never created a new function in Sage I don't know in
which file I should add this function (and how to do so that it is available to the user).
Should I add it in a specialized package (like io)? Any advice would be welcome.
Should I add it in misc/misc.py??

ok, I have prepared a patch with a new file interfaces/readdata.py. However hg_sage.diff()
does not show this new file. How to tell Mercurial to consider it?

For portability, it might be better to use Python for the doctests: something like

```
sage: f = open("in.data", "w")
sage: f.write("17\n42")
sage: f.close()
   etc.
```
Also, line 29, `[17. 42]` looks suspicious: should that period be a comma?

not quite. It solves the line break problem, but "17\n42\n" appears as "17n42n" in the ascii
documentation. Anyway this is a different issue, since it also happens with (for example):

```
sage: from sage.combinat.matrices.latin import *
sage: B = back_circulant(4)
sage: B.find_disjoint_mates?
```
where `print B0, "\n,\n", B1` appears as `print B0, "n,n", B1`.

To reviewers and release manager: only apply the last patch `trac_8156b.patch`.

I think it's OK if we don't delete the file explicitly.  But maybe it's better to use `tmp_filename`, which increments an internal counter and checks whether the file already exists?
