When I wrote the wiki and trac command, there was no .sage/* folder, and the SAge notebook was stored in sage_notebook in the current directory.   The notebook has moved over to be in .sage, but nobody moved the wiki and trac yet.   It would be reasonable to do so.  HOWEVER, note that this would break all my wiki's, since a typical situation is:

```
sage@sagemath:~/wiki/sage$ ls
nohup.err  nohup.out  sage_wiki  start
sage@sagemath:~/wiki/sage$ more start
ulimit -v 2000000; nohup echo "wiki(port=9001, address='')" | sage-new  > nohup.out 2>nohup.err &
sage@sagemath:~/wiki/sage$
```

If you change the wiki to be in $HOME/.sage by default, then suddenly all my wiki's will get started on top of each other (hence all but one will fail to start). 

So it might be worth checking if there is a wiki directory "sage_wiki" in the current directory, and only if there isn't then default to $HOME/.sage/moinmoin.
