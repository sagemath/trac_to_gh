<a id='comment:50'></a>Hi Franco,

I believe I have taken care of everything we discussed on Monday. So back to needs review!
There remains to little points to be discussed in Davis:

- Should the user documentation about triangular morphisms
  be in the class or in module_morphism?

- triangular=True led to triangular="lower" while the
  default value for triangular is "upper"

Cheers from warm Davis!
                                                    Nicolas

<a id='comment:60'></a>Here is my review. I pushed some typo fixes, improved some of the documentation and added a few doctests. Here are a few issues and questions:

- I don't understand the comment in ``src/sage/categories/finitely_generated_semigroups.py``:

```
# TODO: update transitive ideal
```

- a couple of doctests include the following line:

```
sage: import __main__; __main__.f = f  
```
can you explain why this is necessary?

- line 1015 of ``src/sage/modules/module_with_basis_morphism.py``: the doc says this should work over an ring, so perhaps the following is not a valid assumption?

```
c = c / s[j]  # the base ring is a field
```

- the doctests don't pass, but this seems to be related to #17160

Thanks! I double checked your changes and am happy with them. This
prompted a second pass of little things here and there to make the doc
more uniform. I also implemented the two we had discussed.

> Here are a few issues and questions:
> 
> - I don't understand the comment in ``src/sage/categories/finitely_generated_semigroups.py``:

> # TODO: update transitive ideal
> ```


The code uses TransitiveIdeal which is being deprecated in favor of
RecursivelyEnumeratedSet. I have added this as comment on #17160.

> - a couple of doctests include the following line:
> 
> ```
> sage: import __main__; __main__.f = f  
> ```
> can you explain why this is necessary?


A function defined interactively is not picklable, which prevents us
from using it to test the pickling of objects built upon them. This
classical trick fakes f being defined in a Python module.

> - line 1015 of ``src/sage/modules/module_with_basis_morphism.py``: the doc says this should work over an ring, so perhaps the following is not a valid assumption?
> 
> ```
> c = c / s[j]  # the base ring is a field
> ```


The documentation mentions:

```
        - ``self`` -- a triangular morphism over a field, or a
          unitriangular morphism over a ring
```
which is tested a couple lines above:

```
        if G.base_ring() not in Fields and not self._unitriangular:
            raise NotImplementedError, "coreduce for a triangular but not unitriangular morphism over a ring"
```

> - the doctests don't pass, but this seems to be related to #17160


Yup. Next step is to cleanup #17160. And then we will know better if
there are a couple trivial doctests that need to be updated here.

Cheers,
                                Nicolas

<a id='comment:76'></a>On {{{Linux sagange 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.2.63-2+deb7u1 x86_64
GNU/Linux}}}, and after merging in 6.6.rc0, I am getting only those
errors with `make ptestlong`:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/doctest/control.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/calculus/calculus.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/misc/trace.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/modular/arithgroup/arithgroup_perm.py  # Timed out
sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

Sounds like they are all maxima related, and I doubt there is any
relation to this ticket; rc0 fails similarly. Hence I am setting
this to positive review on behalf of Franco.
