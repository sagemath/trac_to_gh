<a id='comment:30'></a>Humph, so two points:

1- The last push correct a bug in TriangularModuleMorphism with on_basis.

2- I did not know that my push would have change the branch (but I should as it is a 'private' one) and do not know how to replace back the right branch, which is *u/nthiery/categories/module-morphisms-8678*. Sorry for the noise :s

At least, if my correction is wrong it should be very easy to reset :)

<a id='comment:50'></a>Hi Franco,

I believe I have taken care of everything we discussed on Monday. So back to needs review!
There remains to little points to be discussed in Davis:

- Should the user documentation about triangular morphisms
  be in the class or in module_morphism?

- triangular=True led to triangular="lower" while the
  default value for triangular is "upper"

Cheers from warm Davis!
                                                    Nicolas

<a id='comment:60'></a>Here is my review. I pushed some typo fixes, improved some of the documentation and added a few doctests. Here are a few issues and questions:

- I don't understand the comment in ``src/sage/categories/finitely_generated_semigroups.py``:

```
# TODO: update transitive ideal
```

- a couple of doctests include the following line:

```
sage: import __main__; __main__.f = f  
```
can you explain why this is necessary?

- line 1015 of ``src/sage/modules/module_with_basis_morphism.py``: the doc says this should work over an ring, so perhaps the following is not a valid assumption?

```
c = c / s[j]  # the base ring is a field
```

- the doctests don't pass, but this seems to be related to #17160

Thanks! I double checked your changes and am happy with them. This
prompted a second pass of little things here and there to make the doc
more uniform. I also implemented the two we had discussed.

> Here are a few issues and questions:
> 
> - I don't understand the comment in ``src/sage/categories/finitely_generated_semigroups.py``:

The code uses TransitiveIdeal which is being deprecated in favor of
RecursivelyEnumeratedSet. I have added this as comment on #17160.

> - a couple of doctests include the following line:
> 
> ```
> sage: import __main__; __main__.f = f  
> ```
> can you explain why this is necessary?


A function defined interactively is not picklable, which prevents us
from using it to test the pickling of objects built upon them. This
classical trick fakes f being defined in a Python module.

> - line 1015 of ``src/sage/modules/module_with_basis_morphism.py``: the doc says this should work over an ring, so perhaps the following is not a valid assumption?
> 
> ```
> c = c / s[j]  # the base ring is a field
> ```


The documentation mentions:

```
        - ``self`` -- a triangular morphism over a field, or a
          unitriangular morphism over a ring
```
which is tested a couple lines above:

```
        if G.base_ring() not in Fields and not self._unitriangular:
            raise NotImplementedError, "coreduce for a triangular but not unitriangular morphism over a ring"
```

> - the doctests don't pass, but this seems to be related to #17160


Yup. Next step is to cleanup #17160. And then we will know better if
there are a couple trivial doctests that need to be updated here.

Cheers,
                                Nicolas
