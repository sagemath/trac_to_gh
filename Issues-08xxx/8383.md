I hit the following problem:

```
sage: f(x) = sigma(x)-x
...
TypeError: unable to convert x (=x) to an integer
```
Wouldn't it better to keep sigma(x) unevaluated for x not an integer?
Note that `f = lambda(x):sigma(x)-x` works but it less nice.

yes, in Maple for example numtheory[sigma](x) remains symbolic, and does not produce an error.

doesn't Sage provide such a list? It would then be easy to do a loop over all functions and
determine those which don't work with symbolic arguments.

<a id='comment:14'></a>Hi, thanks for working on this!

One solution (this is one I'm using on #4102), is to write a wrapper function `sigma` that will take either one or two arguments and return the general symbolic function of two arguments accordingly:

```
sage: sigma(5)
symbolic_sigma(5, 1)
sage: sigma(x, 2)
symbolic_sigma(x, 2)
```

The symbolic function `symbolic_sigma` would inherit from `BuiltinFunction` and have two arguments. It's printed name could be just `sigma` instead of `symbolic_sigma` to lessen confusion.
