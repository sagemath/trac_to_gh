I hit the following problem:

```
sage: f(x) = sigma(x)-x
...
TypeError: unable to convert x (=x) to an integer
```
Wouldn't it better to keep sigma(x) unevaluated for x not an integer?
Note that `f = lambda(x):sigma(x)-x` works but it less nice.

We'd have to produce a symbolic version of sigma somewhere.  Do you want this for all arithmetic functions?  We really should have an arithmetic function class anyway, but it's probably more trouble than it's worth to actually do it.

yes, in Maple for example numtheory[sigma](x) remains symbolic, and does not produce an error.

Can you either provide a list of "arithmetic functions" which should be made symbolic, or just make this ticket about `sigma()`?

Tickets with blanket statements about symbolic functions (see #4102, #1158, #4229) are hard to attack since nobody takes on the task of making a list of functions which need to be fixed.

doesn't Sage provide such a list? It would then be easy to do a loop over all functions and
determine those which don't work with symbolic arguments.

As I'm writing the symbolic version of sigma, it appears that a symbolic function created using BuiltinFunction has to have an explicit number of arguments. It is a little more work to write

```
sage: sigma(5, 1)
```
than just

```
sage: sigma(5)
```
but I'm not sure if there's a way around it.

Hi, thanks for working on this!

One solution (this is one I'm using on #4102), is to write a wrapper function `sigma` that will take either one or two arguments and return the general symbolic function of two arguments accordingly:

```
sage: sigma(5)
symbolic_sigma(5, 1)
sage: sigma(x, 2)
symbolic_sigma(x, 2)
```

The symbolic function `symbolic_sigma` would inherit from `BuiltinFunction` and have two arguments. It's printed name could be just `sigma` instead of `symbolic_sigma` to lessen confusion.
