Preliminary version.

note: this is mostly a copy of existing files for wrapping ZZ_pE and ZZ_pEX with
'sed s/ZZ/zz/g' applied.

warning: there is no test (yet) for checking that the modulus is < NTL_SP_BOUND

still, doctests pass and here are some results:

```
sage: c=ntl.zz_pEContext(ntl.zz_pX([1,1,1,1,1], 19800713)) 
sage: a = ntl.zz_pE([3,2], c); b = ntl.zz_pE([1,2], c)
sage: f = ntl.zz_pEX([a, b, b])
sage: p = f**123
sage: q = p+f**77+f
sage: 
sage: C=ntl.ZZ_pEContext(ntl.ZZ_pX([1,1,1,1,1], 19800713)) 
sage: A = ntl.ZZ_pE([3,2], C); B = ntl.ZZ_pE([1,2], C)
sage: F = ntl.ZZ_pEX([A, B, B])

I must be tired... there is a check, it's done in the lzz_p class.

I guess this one is ready for review then. I will open another ticket to do the same as #7841 latter.

Finally, this is such a small patch that I add it here.
With both patches applied, the default implementation for polynomial ring is now based on NTL, and uses type ZZ or lzz depending on the characteristic (tested against NTL_SP_BOUND).

I get doctest failures on sage.math:

```
sage -t  devel/sage/sage/graphs/graph_list.py # 0 doctests failed
sage -t  devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_curve_isogeny.py # Killed/crashed
sage -t  devel/sage/sage/libs/ntl/ntl_lzz_pX.pyx # 5 doctests failed
sage -t  devel/sage/sage/libs/ntl/ntl_lzz_pEX_linkage.pxi # 3 doctests failed
```

Looks like a 64-bit thing?

```
sage -t  devel/sage/sage/libs/ntl/ntl_lzz_pEX_linkage.pxi
