Graph.topological_minor ! 

I hope it will be useful, though the performances of GLPK are veeeery bad on this kind of problem... CPLEX can solve immediately problems GLPK can not handle (find there is no topological K5 minor in a Petersen Graph for example, or the same in a Grid2d graph). 

I mentionned it in the docstring.

Even though the patch applies (with fuzz and large offset), you should rebase it to sage-4.6.2.alpha0:

```
patching file sage/graphs/graph.py
Hunk #1 succeeded at 2960 with fuzz 2 (offset 461 lines).
