Recent ticket #8650 (required for the output below) fixed a bug in face_lattice computation for polytopes. However, I think that both of the following examples for unbounded polyhedra are incorrect.

```
sage: for lset in Polyhedron(rays=[(1,0)]).face_lattice().level_sets(): lset
[(None, (0, 1))]
[((0,), (0,)), ((1,), (0, 1))]
[((0, 1), (0,))]
[((0, 1), None)]
```
This ray has three faces: empty, vertex, and the whole ray (including the vertex at which it originates). Five are shown, including a face containing the ray, but not the vertex from which it originates.

```
sage: for lset in Polyhedron(rays=[(1,0), (0,1)]).face_lattice().level_sets(): lset
[(None, (0, 1))]
[((1,), (0,)), ((0,), (1,)), ((2,), (0, 1))]
[((1, 2), (0,)), ((0, 2), (1,))]
[((0, 1, 2), None)]
```
For the quadrant we have five faces: empty, vertex, two rays, and the whole quadrant. The above output has seven.

The easiest fix is probably to raise an exception if the polyhedron is unbounded and state in the documentation that face_lattice works only for polytopes, but of course it would be nice to be able to compute correct faces in all cases.

The non-compactness is not the issue, the 1-d interval in a 2-d ambient space fails as well:

```
sage: for lset in Polyhedron(vertices=[(1,0),(0,1)]).face_lattice().level_sets(): print lset
....: 
[(None, (0, 1, 2))]
[((1,), (0, 2)), ((0,), (0, 1))]
[((0, 1), (0,))]
[((0, 1), None)]
```

On the other hand, I would argue that the novoselt's Quadrant example is correct: The rays stand for points at infinite distance and are properly counted as points. A triangle would have 8 faces. The edge at infinity is not counted as a face of the quadrant (=double infinite triangle), hence the quadrant does have 7 faces.

The fundamental flaw of the face_lattice() function is that 
1) its description does not explain in detail what is computed
2) The result should be returned by means of the H/Vrepresentation objects, and not by their indices.

Well, what exactly is a face of a convex polyhedron in an affine space? I take as the definition "an intersection of a supporting hyperplane with the polyhedron." In this case rays cannot appear "by themselves," without the vertex from which they are going.

I think that you actually agree with me ;-) Why did you throw away the "edge at infinity?" I think, because it is "completely at infinity." But the same is true for a standalone ray representing "a vertex at infinity" - this face has no points in the affine space. On the other hand, "a half-infinite" edge defined by a vertex and a ray lives in the affine space except for one endpoint. So I would argue that we should throw away all faces generated by infinite point only. Or at least do this by default and have an option to include them, but then I think that ALL infinite faces should be included.

Actually, just a couple of days ago I have implemented the algorithm used for face_lattice following the reference in the documentation (and my implementation seems to be faster, but it is not yet ready for inclusion).

This algorithm computes the Hasse diagram of an atomic and coatomic lattice starting from incidences. In the case of a bounded full-dimensional polyhedron vertices are atoms and facets are coatoms. If the polytope includes rays and lines in addition to vertices and equations in addition to inequalities, one should be more careful.
