Sorry,

I don't know which behaviour you want for the last example I gave...

I ran : 

```
sage: for i in range(10):
....:     for S in SkewPartitions(i):
....:         if S != from_row_and_column_length(S.row_lengths(),S.column_lengths()):
....:             print S
....:             
sage:
```
That works! For the example comming from my last comment... I don't know.

Otherwise, the patch is correct (apply, test and doc.). I am not an expert with Skew Partitions...

The cases with 0 row and columns length are ambiguous (see the example in the doc). I now raise a proper error:

```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I re-uploaded the new patch ! Please review.

Ok, no more corner case from my point of view....

The patch apply, the doc is perfect, all test passed. The rst construction with ..warning:: produces a very very nice html output.

Positive review from me.
