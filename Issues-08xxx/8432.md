From [sage-release](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/msg/2c501eca0da2a056):

```
As expected based on my experience with 4.3.3, I got a build error
building 4.3.4.alpha0, though this time it was a linking error with gd
rather than cddlib. Again, this is Fedora 10 on a 64-bit system, but
on a 32-bit network, so there exist 32-bit libraries findable via NFS
(under /usr/local). But this time I don't see any obvious evidence
that this is the source of the trouble.

```
This is due to gd being built before iconv. mpatel suggested at [#8191](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/8191#comment:10) to make iconv a dependency for building gd. See also #8306 which implements this dependency rule.

I'll make a patch for that. Sorry, I overlooked the importance of this. I'm still somewhat puzzled how it ever built on Fedora if it needs an iconv - unless gd has been recently updated to need iconv too. 

There is, as yet an untested file on 't2' 

/rootpool2/local/kirkby/sage-4.3.4.alpha0.Solaris-untested.tar

which has

* sage-4.3.4.alpha0 source
* All the patches list at https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/8409 applied
* This item addressed. 

That may or may not build on 't2', but if it does, it should have all known bug fixes that allow all doctests (including the long ones) to pass.
