To generate the certificate required for secure (https) notebooks, openssl is called (in Linux, at least). By default, openssl generates 512bit RSA keys, which are far too weak to be used with any degree of confidence.

The offending code is in the sagenb module, in the run_notebook.py file, line 100. A simple fix is to change the line to:

    cmd = ['openssl genrsa 2048 > %s' % private_pem]
