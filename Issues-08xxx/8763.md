As discussed in http://groups.google.com/group/sage-edu/browse_thread/thread/aa651032bb34a285, it would be very nice if published worksheets could include licensing information, so that we could collect, modify, and redistribute excellent worksheets.

So, when publishing worksheets, there should be a mechanism to choose a license; as a start, maybe just hard-code four choices: CC by-sa-nc, by-sa, GFDL, and no licensing information at all. If a license is chosen, this would put something like this into the worksheet:

```
<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/">
<img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" 
src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/3.0/us/80x15.png" 
/></a><br />This worksheet is licensed under a <a rel="license" 
href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/">Creative 
Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 United States License</a>.
```
The rel="license" bit is a microformat that will make the licensing information computer-readable, so that eventually one could search for worksheets available with a certain license.
