sage: prod(primes_first_n(64)).divisors()
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Sage will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
The crash is due to the fact that the number has exactly `2^64` divisors and this overflows a C integer.


Keywords: **integer divisors**
