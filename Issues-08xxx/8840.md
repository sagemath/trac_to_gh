sage contain Multiple cross site reference vulnerability
because authority does not checked before preforming an action

**CSRF attacks explain:**
If create a file on my domain called "blah.jpg". It's really a php file, renamed.
The PHP file redirects you back to the referring host (or any host I want to really), to a special URL.
That URL takes an action based on the submitted data.
I then use an img  tag <img> to link to my "image" on your site.

When you view the page, your browser makes a request to that image, and that request is then redirected to the page on your site. Your browser won't display the image (or will display a broken image) but that's not important. What's important is that you just executed an action without knowing it.

Some examples of  CSRF attacks in sage :

1) upload a worksheet
2) create worksheet
3) change email 
4) .............
...........
.............
...........


**example:**
1- login in at
http://alpha.sagenb.org/

2- open this published worksheet
http://alpha.sagenb.org/home/pub/16/

3-go to your home you will see that I uploaded a worksheet to your account .
