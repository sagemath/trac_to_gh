I don't like the inconsistency. After all, matrices have base rings too, and your argument applies identically to the matrices rather than the endomorphism objects.

If you don't like the way it's currently implemented for matrices, you can start a debate on sage-devel if you want. It's perfectly possible that it could be changed, with an optional argument called something like "base_extend" to give users the option to choose whichever behaviour they want. But I absolutely insist that the behaviour should be the same for matrices and for morphisms of vector spaces represented by matrices.

In view that the discusion about the change of the matrix functions is idle, i have implemented it.

So with this patch, the functions eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be called on matrices with the option extend=False (although i have noted that they are broken in matrices over the reals). I didn't change anything in the computation process; just parse the output to select the values in the base ring.

With that change, i have redone my implementation of these functions for homomorphism objects (an erased the eigenspaces functions, which i don't think make much sense to be translated directly from matrices such as it is). Now they just call the corresponding functions of the underlying matrices, and parse the output to convert the eigenvectors into elements of the corresponding vector space.

With your new patches, eigenvectors_left accepts the extend parameter but eigenvectors_right doesn't; and bases for free module morphism eigenspaces are returned as lists, while bases for matrix eigenspaces are returned as sequences. I've done a tiny patch that fixes these slight inconsistencies and tidies up the docstrings a bit. Marco: if you're happy with my changes please feel free to set this to "positive_review".
