There used to be blank space (via CSS) at the bottom of the notebook that would prevent interacts from jumping when updated.  See  #4963 for the CSS code that was used and the reason for it.  In 4.3.2, it seems that the blank space was removed.

Is there a suitable place to document this? Other than in trac? I can see this as something that can get changed as people forget the reason for it. Perhaps just a suitable comment in the source is all that is needed.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Possibly in `sagenb.notebook.interact`, I think.  The space is useful for other reasons, of course, but we should try to fix the flickering interact problem.  I had what *may* be a promising solution at #7908.  I'll try to rebase it in the near future.
