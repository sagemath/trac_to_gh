There used to be blank space (via CSS) at the bottom of the notebook that would prevent interacts from jumping when updated.  See  #4963 for the CSS code that was used and the reason for it.  In 4.3.2, it seems that the blank space was removed.

Works as advertised. I tried before/after with a worksheet with an interact as the last block. In this case the cell about is fairly large. The page would jump significantly every time the interact updated. Adding the space stopped the jumping.

Is there a suitable place to document this? Other than in trac? I can see this as something that can get changed as people forget the reason for it. Perhaps just a suitable comment in the source is all that is needed.

Possibly in `sagenb.notebook.interact`, I think.  The space is useful for other reasons, of course, but we should try to fix the flickering interact problem.  I had what *may* be a promising solution at #7908.  I'll try to rebase it in the near future.
