I think Cremona's email says it best:

```
For the first time, I just tried using the "Undo" function on a
worksheet since I had messed something up.  But all the revisions I
was offered, even those from a day ago, look the same as the current
version!

This is 4.3.5 running on a 64-bit ubuntu server.

I have found it very useful that my students can work on something in
a worksheet owned by them, and then share it with me, so that when
they come to see me to talk about it we can go through it in detail on
my own computer at our meeting.  (This is really a fantastic feature).
 But just now I was having a look at a student's worksheet the day
before our meeting, and made some changed to it which I later
regretted and tried to revert.  Without success....

Any suggestions welcome!

John Cremona

Maybe it was a stupid thing to try, but the patch does not apply to sage 4.7.1. Here is the output I get:

or mercurial@selenic.com
/home/uname/Programs/sage-test/local/bin/patch: **** Only garbage was found in the patch input.

```

Is this a problem with mercurial as suggested in the output, or with the patch under the current sage?

Yes, because you didn't follow my instructions exactly ;-) though those were on the sage-notebook list, not this ticket.

* Log in to a command line Sage.
* type **exactly** the following:

```
hg_sagenb.import_patch("https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8776/trac_8776-sagenb-undo.2.patch")
```
   and see what happens.  

Note the "hg_sagenb" instead of "hg_sage".  We moved a lot of stuff outside of the devel/sage/ directory into the devel/sagenb directory a while ago, so this is necessary.  Hopefully this will at least give a more informative message.  Thanks for trying it out - you're on your way to becoming a Sage developer!

I still don't understand why downloading the raw patch and then patching did not work, whereas using the link did, but thanks for the explicit tip, kcrisman! Here is the output:

```
applying /home/uname/.sage/temp/cname/14067/tmp_0.patch

Hunk #3 succeeded at 1986 with fuzz 2 (offset -8 lines).

```
Does this imply that the patch is applied now? If it does, then it also implies that the patch does not solve the issue of identical snapshots, as they are still all identical if I create a few while making changes to a worksheet.

Okay, good to know.  I assume that you are referring to snapshots "created" *after* the time you applied the patch; obviously, previous snapshots wouldn't magically change!

> Is it normal that sage-0.0.0-py2.6.egg-info is re-built every time, or does it imply that the patch was not fully applied and lingers somewhere in the queue? Is there a way to check from within sage that the new code is actually used? E.g. by typing "sagenb-undo??" or something along these lines?


No, this is actually what is supposed to happen.   I wouldn't worry about whether the code is used; that's the job of those writing patches :)

I have reported this at https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/issues/236 - eventually I should go sift through the Google code bug reports too.  But this is one of the very few things I think really makes the notebook unusable for certain people - it's fine for most of my and other more casual needs, but without revision control at the very least we can have revisions that actually work!

That said, I don't know that the current code here will have anything useful with the flask notebook - but who knows?
