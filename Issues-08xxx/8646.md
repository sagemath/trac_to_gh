I am running windows 7 64 bit, and have installed 
virtualbox 3.1.6.  Sage 4.3 does not import into virtualbox   right near the end of the import process it fails with the following error

Runtime error: -35 (Unresolved (unknown) host platform error.).

The error occurs on line 3325 of the source file VirtualBoxImpl.cpp .

This may be a virtualbox issue,  but it does mean that perhaps a lot of windows users can't get the default sage virtual environment to run.  I have not seen this issue reported elsewhere.

Component: **build**
