Some scripts in SAGE_ROOT/local/bin expect spkg names to have the form 

```
my_package-2.3.spkg
```
but not 

```
my-package-2.3.spkg   (first hyphen is bad)
```
See [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/8597ce93b420afe4) for some discussion.

The attached patches do three things:

- Rewrite sage-pkg (in python instead of bash) to test whether the name has the right form.
- Remove sage-pkg-nocompress, using sage-pkg instead (and thus unifying the two scripts sage-pkg and sage-pkg-nocompress).
- Add some comments about this to the developer's guide (hence the cc for mvngu).

I used python because in the old version of sage-pkg, we were already calling sed and perl, and we might need to call perl again (or something else?) to test whether the name has the right form.  It seems easier to maintain if it's all plain Python.

Here is the standard suggested by this patch: each Sage spkg should have a name of the following form:

```
BASENAME-VERSION.spkg
```
where BASENAME may contain lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores, but **no hyphens**.  VERSION **must be present** and **should start with a number**; it may contain numbers, letters, dots, and hyphens; it may end in a string of the form "pNUM", where "NUM" is a non-negative integer.  The new version of sage-pkg sets BASENAME to be everything up to the first hyphen, but it does not check to make sure only numbers, lowercase letters, and underscores are used.  It checks that VERSION is present, starts with a number, and contains only numbers, letters, periods, hyphens.  If not, it prints a warning and creates an spkg anyway.

I've tried to implement the change at #2522, but I'm not sure how to test it.  Any suggestions?  What sort of "OS X junk" should I try to put in my directory, to make sure it is not put into the resulting spkg file?

* trac_8679-scripts.patch will of course probably cause some other patches to need rebases. 

-- So to finish a review, trac_8679-sage.patch needs to be tested:

1. make an spkg

2. make a non-compressed spkg

3. Do a full build of all of sage.

Anything else?

If somebody (e.g., me) reports the above works, then I would give this a positive review.

And moving to Python is *great*, since now we can use this script in other scripts, and option parsing is done right.

Oops, you're right.  (The tar_file function used to be part of "main", so "file" was defined there.)

Here's a new patch; it just changes `file` to `"%s.spkg" % dir`.

First of all, what's widely used *in Sage* is the convention here: everything after the first hyphen is the version number.  Look at the names of the standard spkgs to see this.

Second, you might be right, but this is not the right place to discuss design decisions like this: sage-devel is.

Third, this is an issue which will only arise for developers -- people producing new spkgs -- and they should be able to handle using hyphens or underscores according to the conventions.  So it's not a big deal.

Well, I didn't talk about common *spkg* names (of course they follow the old rule).
Note that many spkgs are patched upstream packages, so their (original) names won't necessarily follow *Sage's* naming convention; there are indeed yet packages that had to be renamed.

> Second, you might be right, but this is not the right place to discuss design decisions like this: sage-devel is.

The thread "ends" with a link to this ticket, whose description (re-)states the convention, while the thread's title only mentions the *mode* package;
but never mind, I'll repost it there. ;-)

> Third, this is an issue which will only arise for developers -- people producing new spkgs -- and they should be able to handle using hyphens or underscores according to the conventions.

I think there's (with intent) no sharp line between Sage developers/contributors/users; think of optional "third party" (s)pkgs.

I'm doing a full build of Sage right now. I took all the spkgs in spkg/standard, extracted them, and re-made them with "sage -pkg" (and "sage -pkg_nc") after applying the patch here. I'll report the results of the build, although so far it seems fine.

The build went fine and all tests pass, so the new script produces spkgs that work perfectly well.

Just as an idea, would it make sense to have "sage -pkg" add checksums, as in #329?

I think that sounds good, but it belongs on another ticket.

By the way, I also applied this patch and then ran "sage -sdist" and built Sage from the resulting tar file without problems.

Oh, of course. I've created #8690 for that.

It seems we've met William's criteria for a positive review. I've created some spkgs (in Linux and OS X) with this patch applied, and everything works properly. I think we can call this a positive review.

jhpalmieri's patch rewrites an existing script with no changes in semantics, except to give an error if the package name breaks other parts of the Sage build system.  I think it should go in as is.  

Your suggestions to change the package naming convention is reasonable consider.  However, I think that should be done independently of this particular ticket.  Keeping focus on one issue at a time is really important in order to make solid progress.

I didn't want to blame John's work nor give it a negative review.

Relaxing the naming convention of course requires locating the code parts that (currently can't) deal with such names, so if at all tbd in another ticket.
