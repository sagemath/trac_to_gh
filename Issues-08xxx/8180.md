But these are the only patches applied between a version which did not generate the error, and one which does.

Upon loading this alpha3, it now shows that kpsewhich is not found:

I think the culprit is #1321.  If you want evidence: in `sage/graphs/all.py`, change the end of the file from

```
from graph_database import graph_db_info
from graph_editor import graph_editor
```
to

```
from graph_database import graph_db_info

print "no kpsewhich error message yet"

from graph_editor import graph_editor

print "now you just saw the error message"
```
Note that if you use the version of graph_editor in Sage 4.3.2.alpha1, then I think you don't get this message, so the problem seems to have been fixed at some point.  I can't find the ticket, though...

Actually, I think using the newer version of graph_editor just delays the error message until you run some graph theory command like `graphs.CompleteGraph(2)`.  

Here's a patch which does fix the problem, I think.
