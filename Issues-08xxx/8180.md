Minh created a 4.3.0.1.alpha3 which should have really been called 4.3.0.2.alpha3, as it was based on the 4.3.0.1 sources, with patches applied. It was  created to sort out what broke the Sage build between 4.3.0 and 4.3.1. The issue was reported to [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/1029907a9ddd125c).

The previous version, 4.3.0.1.alpha2 did not have this issue, but 4.3.0.1.alpha3 is reporting the error message about kpsewhich is not found. From what I can gather, this kpsewhich is part of Latex. Since Latex is not a requirement to build Sage, this error should not be happening. It would appear one of the following patches is causing this, though none of them look as though they are likely to caused the problem. 

#5174, #1321, #6595, #6820, #6965


But these are the only patches applied between a version which did not generate the error, and one which does. 

```
Upon loading this alpha3, it now shows that kpsewhich is not found:

I think the culprit is #1321.  If you want evidence: in `sage/graphs/all.py`, change the end of the file from

```
from graph_database import graph_db_info
from graph_editor import graph_editor
```
to

```
from graph_database import graph_db_info

print "no kpsewhich error message yet"

from graph_editor import graph_editor

print "now you just saw the error message"
```
Note that if you use the version of graph_editor in Sage 4.3.2.alpha1, then I think you don't get this message, so the problem seems to have been fixed at some point.  I can't find the ticket, though...
