Thank you for implementing the alcove path model by Lenart and Postnikov.
This will be a useful addition to sage.

It might be useful to add a few more words about the model you implemented
in the documentation of ClassicalCrystalOfAlcovePaths. For example, you could
add that these are highest weight crystals for classical types
`A_n`, `B_n`, `C_n`, `D_n` and the exceptional types `F_4`, `G_2`, `E_6`,
`E_7`, `E_8`.

Also, for the user it would be helpful to say how precisely one should
enter the input data. For example, you could say

INPUT:
  
- ``cartan_type`` is the Cartan type of a classical Dynkin diagram 
- ``highest_weight`` is a dominant weight as a list of coefficients of 
   the fundamental weights `Lambda_i`

It might also be good to briefly describe how the crystal elements
are represented so that the user can interpret the output.

Some technical comments:

(1) In combinat/crystals/alcove_path.py, it might be safer to only 
import the methods/classes that you really need for:

from sage.rings.integer import * (which appears twice, so please remove one!)
from sage.misc.misc import *
from sage.calculus.calculus import *

(2) All methods need EXAMPLES or TESTS. Please add them to the following
methods in combinat/crystals/alcove_path.py for

__classcall__
get_initial_chain
fold
compare_graphs

(3) Perhaps remove the commented out lines by # in

__init__
list

(4) Add extra line after EXAMPLES:: get_chain_from_subset

(5) Remove the commented out `weight` function

(6) You need TESTS or EXAMPLES to_coroot_lattice_morphism in 
sage/combinat/root_system/root_lattice_realization.py

This patch implements the Lenart-Postnikov model for highest weight crystals for finite-dimensional Lie algebras. There are extensive tests to test that this gives the same crystal graph as other models.

All tests pass with sage-4.4.2 and the sage-combinat queue applied to this patch.

sage-4.5 is in feature freeze mode. Nothing but essential fixes will be merged until final release. I am strongly suggesting that the next release be patches to the sage library only (other than essential spkg fixes), and tickets like these deserve to go in then. (I would have had an alpha for such tickets in the 4.5 series, but the spkg issues are already holding things up long enough.)
