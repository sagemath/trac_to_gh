Thank you for implementing the alcove path model by Lenart and Postnikov.
This will be a useful addition to sage.

It might be useful to add a few more words about the model you implemented
in the documentation of ClassicalCrystalOfAlcovePaths. For example, you could
add that these are highest weight crystals for classical types
`A_n`, `B_n`, `C_n`, `D_n` and the exceptional types `F_4`, `G_2`, `E_6`,
`E_7`, `E_8`.

Also, for the user it would be helpful to say how precisely one should
enter the input data. For example, you could say

INPUT:
  
- ``cartan_type`` is the Cartan type of a classical Dynkin diagram 
- ``highest_weight`` is a dominant weight as a list of coefficients of 
   the fundamental weights `Lambda_i`

It might also be good to briefly describe how the crystal elements
are represented so that the user can interpret the output.

Some technical comments:

(1) In combinat/crystals/alcove_path.py, it might be safer to only 
import the methods/classes that you really need for:

from sage.rings.integer import * (which appears twice, so please remove one!)
from sage.misc.misc import *
from sage.calculus.calculus import *

(2) All methods need EXAMPLES or TESTS. Please add them to the following
methods in combinat/crystals/alcove_path.py for

__classcall__
get_initial_chain
fold
compare_graphs

(3) Perhaps remove the commented out lines by # in

__init__
list

(4) Add extra line after EXAMPLES:: get_chain_from_subset

(5) Remove the commented out `weight` function

(6) You need TESTS or EXAMPLES to_coroot_lattice_morphism in 
sage/combinat/root_system/root_lattice_realization.py

This patch implements the Lenart-Postnikov model for highest weight crystals for finite-dimensional Lie algebras. There are extensive tests to test that this gives the same crystal graph as other models.

All tests pass with sage-4.4.2 and the sage-combinat queue applied to this patch.
