```
In the module `sage/combinat/integer_vector.py`, the documentation for the function `gale_ryser_theorem()` should be fixed as per the following suggestion:

```
On the recently added
gale_ryser_theorem()
there's a documentation bug (also present on the changelog)

"The Gale Ryser theorem asserts that if p1;p2  are two partitions of
n  of respective lengths k1;k2 , then there is a binary k1Ã‚k2  matrix
M  such that p1  is the vector of row sums and p2  is the vector of
column sums of M , if and only if p2  dominates p1 ."

At the end it should say

"p2  conjugate (transpose) dominates p1"

The theorem is mis-stated yet the function seems to be working
```
See this [sage-devel thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/5014758cac3b9e5d) for the original bug report.
