The patch switches AmbientSpace and Scheme to inherit from Parent rather than old-style classes. I used to get random segfaults in "sage -testall" with this patch applied, but with 4.3.3 it seems to be smooth and in anyway the patch is very simple and should not introduce new bugs.

To "fix" broken doctests because of the missing list() method I have just removed them, since they were in functions not directly related to list() anyway.

Yeah, I should have probably explained it better. I am working on support for (Fano) toric varieties and Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces/complete intersections inside (with a hope to finish by this summer). So when I was going over schemes/general to figure out what is already there and what do I need to do to fit nicely into existing framework, I got this question:

and wrote the patch. It took me a while to post it due to those Segfaults that ALWAYS were appearing with the patch during non-parallel testing, although in different/unrelated places. Now I did manage to get at least one clean run and think that it should go in. After all, as I understand it, if this patch causes problems, it is because it exposes some deeper bugs in Sage and it actually can be nice if they become more visible...

I also wanted to make the following change (I don't have a ready-to-review patch for this one, but can make one quickly), but nobody got interested in discussing it and I don't think such changes should happen silently:
