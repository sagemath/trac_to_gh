The documentation for the function norm currently does not mention that different kinds of norms are used for complex numbers and vectors of complex numbers.

I was very surprised that for a complex number z, 
norm(z) == norm(vector([z]))<sup>2</sup>, and no hint of this is available from the documentation available through executing "sage: norm?".

See this [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/9f941378a95c0191) thread for some background information.

I've attached a screen capture: the norm reads |*v*| in the notebook (norm?). However, if I read:

$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/reference/sage/misc/functional.html

it looks fine.

Another comment: when read in the notebook, it says:

```
See also

    * norm – the p -norm of a matrix.
    * norm – the p -norm of a vector.
    * norm – the norm of a double precision complex number.
    * norm – the norm of an arbitrary precision complex number.
    * norm – the complex norm of a symbolic expression.
```

which is confusing. Maybe instead of norm it could say sage.matrix.matrix2.Matrix.norm, etcetera. A cool possibility would be to put hyperlinks, but this would probably interfere with the automatic generation of doc, wouldn't it?

My updated patch takes care of this. As for the weirdness in the notebook, I don't know how to fix that.

These would certainly help people like me, who are not mathmaticians and might want to find out a bit more about a topic. 

2) Document the nearest Mathematica, Maple, MATLAB and Macsyma commands when possible. 

For Mathematica, it is Norm[] See:

http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Norm.html

For MATLAB it is norm()

http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/norm.html

I'm not sure about Maple - but  Norm() might be the right one. 

http://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/Maple/view.aspx?path=VectorCalculus%2fNorm

(Please check *'all* these - I'm not a mathematician). 

Having a list of the nearest equivalent commands in the commercial packages would be useful if we ever provide any documentation helping people migrate from those packages to Sage. 

I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this ticket, and my comments should certainly **not** be interpreted as need_work. But I think the documentation could be made more useful by having links and names of the commands in the external packages.

Oops. I mean the documentation could be made more useful by having the name of the nearest command in the commercial packages. Not necessarily links to them, though that might be worth considering too. Some are non-obvious. For example factor() in Sage can factor an integer:

```
sage: factor(12)
2^2 * 3
```

but in Mathematica one would use `FactorInteger`

```
In[1]:= FactorInteger[12]

Out[1]= {{2, 2}, {3, 1}}
```

Note that one has to perhaps change the locale (e.g. `LC_ALL`) to some UTF-8 one before importing the first patch:

```
applying ../../../patches/trac_8825_norm_docstring.patch
transaction abort!
rollback completed
abort: decoding near 'Johan Grönqvist <': 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 8: ordinal not in range(128)!

I do not know what is easiest, but changing my name to Johan Gronqvist (if that is the only problem) is another solution, that may work better. (Those dots are not important to me.)
