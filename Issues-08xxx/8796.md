*"Parentheses may be used to explicitly **show** order of operation."*

I usually use brackets to **express** (i.e. force) [desired/intended] "order of operation", too. ;-)

*"... variables that consist of a leading letter and trailing underscores and alphanumerics"* sounds a bit strange.

I'd say *"... whose names can be made up of alphanumerics and underscores but must start with a letter"* or something like that.

[Haven't applied the patch yet.]
