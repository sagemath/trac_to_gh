I'm suddenly very concerned that Sage binaries won't work at all on computers without libgfortran.so installed. Does Sage even start up on such a box?

Yep.  If I take one of the Sage build machines, remove libgfortran, then start Sage I get:

$ sage
BOOM!

.... ImportError: libgfortran.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

----------------

Not good, since most Linux installs won't have libgfortran.  If I then reinstall gfortran, and copy libgfortran.so  to SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/, then uninstall gfortran, then Sage works fine again.

cp /usr/lib/libgfortran.so.3.0.0 local/lib/libgfortran.so.3

I made the point the other day, that the library should be included in the binary, along with C++ library.

Actually, I think the C library too. The C library is very small anyway. If Sage is linked with a new library, and someone has an older one on their system, it could be a problem. 

'ldd' might be useful to get the location on Solaris, Linux or HP-UX, but not on OS X. Perhaps there is a more widely supported command, but I don't know of it. 

The configure script for gcc has these options. 

```
Fine tuning of the installation directories:
  --bindir=DIR           user executables [EPREFIX/bin]
  --libdir=DIR           object code libraries [EPREFIX/lib]
```

so while one could guess at the location of libraries from the location of the gfortran binary, it is not guaranteed to be right. 

On Solaris, in 64-bit mode, it will be in a subdirectory too

```
drkirkby@hawk:~$ find /usr/local -name libgfortran.so
/usr/local/gcc-4.3.4/lib/amd64/libgfortran.so
/usr/local/gcc-4.3.4/lib/libgfortran.so
/usr/local/gcc-4.5-20100114/lib/amd64/libgfortran.so

To help your particular installation, you can just do 

```
sudo apt-get install libgfortran3
```

We'll have to look into this more carefully, though.

In sage-5.3, libgfortran is shipped with the official Sage binaries, except for Ubuntu 12.04.  In sage-5.4, libgfortran will also be shipped with the Ubuntu 12.04 binaries, see #13515.

I imagine libgfortran comes from the gcc spkg nowadays, and this binary has no trace of gcc in it.

Does that make sense for distros with a more recent toolchain than Sage currently ships?

Well, these should be the "native" ones from the distro the binary was built on (and for).

So unless the distro's toolchain is exceptionally outdated or broken (I also wouldn't say Lucid's is), I think we shouldn't `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC`.

If we ship older libraries than the distro by default comes with / uses, we're IMHO just asking for trouble.  (Not all of them are properly versioned w.r.t. dynamically loading the "correct" one, IIRC.  So running other applications from within the Sage environment might fail.)




Requiring the user installing a Sage binary to eventually also install some stuff with the distro's package manager first isn't too much to ask for, provided that's sufficiently documented and/or a (start-up) script tells her/him to do so...

After all, the whole point of building binaries for *specific* distros is that we know  which, or can expect that such and such (versions of) libraries and programs are present (or at least available through the package manager).

"Installing [with the distro's package manager]" (usually) doesn't mean building/compiling something, which is the point of bdists.

The Sage binary for Foonux 17.12 shouldn't contain any *part of that* distro, because that'd just be redundant (not to mention potentially bypassing security updates etc.).

But my main point was that *using Sage's GCC* for building bdists in general is not the same as shipping *the distro's* libraries -- the former may cause further (or different) trouble.  So if you think we should ship libgfortran, just copy the system's one into `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib`; no need to install Sage's GCC just for that reason, whose libgfortran might (or typically will) be even older than the system's.

P.S.:  If you want to run Sage really "out of the box", use one of the Live CDs (or probably the VirtualBox image), or SMC... ;-)

The only flaw with the bdists currently is that Sage apparently doesn't check on (first) start-up whether its prerequisites are present, instead a probably mysterious or hard to understand error might(!) occur.  That's the bug.

I was thinking of replying there, but thought it was more on topic (or had the right audience) here.

We should probably invite fbissey, Snark and Jan Groenewald et al. to the party, in case they're not already cc'ed (haven't checked).
