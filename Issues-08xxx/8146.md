This is due to the deletion of the line

```
latex_preamble = '\usepackage{amsmath}\n\usepackage{amsfonts}\n'

We need to upgrade `SAGE_DOC/fr/tutorial/conf.py` to use `latex_elements['preamble']` instead of `latex_preamble`, which is [deprecated](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/config.html#confval-latex_preamble).  I'll check the other documents.
