Ticket #8036 fixes some issues with non-ASCII characters in the reference manual. But it breaks the building of the HTML version of the French tutorial:

```

The full traceback has been saved in /tmp/sphinx-err-6XQBIT.log, if you want to report the issue to the author.

This is due to the deletion of the line

```
latex_preamble = '\usepackage{amsmath}\n\usepackage{amsfonts}\n' 
```
in [trac_8036-docbuild_utf8x.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8036/trac_8036-docbuild_utf8x.patch.gz). I'm making this a blocker against Sage 4.3.2.
