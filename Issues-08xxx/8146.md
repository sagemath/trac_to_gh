Ticket #8036 fixes some issues with non-ASCII characters in the reference manual. But it breaks the building of the HTML version of the French tutorial:

```
sphinx-build -b html -d /scratch/mvngu/release/sage-4.3.2.alpha1/devel/sage/doc/output/doctrees/fr/tutorial    /scratch/mvngu/release/sage-4.3.2.alpha1/devel/sage/doc/fr/tutorial /scratch/mvngu/release/sage-4.3.2.alpha1/devel/sage/doc/output/html/fr/tutorial
Running Sphinx v0.6.3

Exception occurred:
  File "/scratch/mvngu/release/sage-4.3.2.alpha1/devel/sage/doc/fr/tutorial/conf.py", line 38, in <module>
    latex_preamble += '\\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{00A0}{\\nobreakspace}\n'
NameError: name 'latex_preamble' is not defined
The full traceback has been saved in /tmp/sphinx-err-6XQBIT.log, if you want to report the issue to the author.
Please also report this if it was a user error, so that a better error message can be provided next time.
Send reports to sphinx-dev@googlegroups.com. Thanks!
Build finished.  The built documents can be found in /scratch/mvngu/release/sage-4.3.2.alpha1/devel/sage/doc/output/html/fr/tutorial
```
This is due to the deletion of the line

```
latex_preamble = '\usepackage{amsmath}\n\usepackage{amsfonts}\n' 
```
in [trac_8036-docbuild_utf8x.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8036/trac_8036-docbuild_utf8x.patch.gz). I'm making this a blocker against Sage 4.3.2.
