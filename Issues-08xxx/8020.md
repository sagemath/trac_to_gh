This appears to be trivial to fix.  In spkg-install change:

```
# The following patch for fixing broken readline behavior on Itanium
# Linux definitely does *not* work on anything else.
if [ "`uname -m`" = "ia64" -a "`uname`" = "Linux" ]; then
    echo "Updating readline.c for Linux/Itanium"
    cp patches/readline.c-Itanium-fix Modules/readline.c
```   

to

```
# The following patch for fixing broken readline behavior on Itanium
# Linux definitely does *not* work on anything else.
if [ "`uname -m`" = "ia64" -a "`uname`" = "Linux" ]; then
    echo "Updating readline.c for Linux/Itanium"
    cp patches/readline.c-Itanium-fix src/Modules/readline.c
