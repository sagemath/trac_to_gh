The patch [trac_8511-unexpected-indentation.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8511/trac_8511-unexpected-indentation.patch) solves the three warnings reported at #8492. However, note that the formatting in the following snippet won't properly render in the HTML version as one would expect TESTS and EXAMPLES block to render:
