The patch [trac_8511-unexpected-indentation.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8511/trac_8511-unexpected-indentation.patch) solves the three warnings reported at #8492.

This is due to the comment

To get this TESTS block to render with colours as one would expect of a TESTS block, prefix that comment with "sage: ".
