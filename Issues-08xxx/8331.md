The BipartiteGraph constructor does not create partitions for dict inputs.

```
sage: t1 = BipartiteGraph({'a': ['b'], 'b':['c']})
sage: t1.left
...
AttributeError: 'BipartiteGraph' object has no attribute 'left'
```

The problem comes in the constructor in the "other inputs" case.  A Graph object is created, but not all the control paths find a bipartition.
