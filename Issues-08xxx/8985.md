I looked in COPYING.txt in SAGE_ROOT and it has:

```
...
gmp                                  LGPL
...
mpfi                                 GPL
mpfr                                 LGPL
...
```

so it includes gmp, but shouldn't, and it doesn't include mpir.  It might be out of date in other ways.

See this [wiki page](http://wiki.sagemath.org/ticket/8985) for work in progress.
