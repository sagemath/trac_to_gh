Trying to resolve #4656, I found the following unpleasant bug.

this looks good :

```
sage: R = Qp(5,5)
sage: x = R(5).add_bigoh(1)
sage: x
O(5)
sage: x*R(1)
O(5)
```

But when multiplied with the identity matrix the precision is lost

```
sage: I = matrix(R, [[1,0],[0,1]])
sage: v = vector([R(1),x])
sage: v
(1 + O(5^5), O(5))
sage: v*I
(1 + O(5^5), 0)
sage: v[0]*I[1,0] + v[1]*I[1,1]
O(5)
```

This causes things like

```
sage: M = matrix(R,[[1,2],[3,4]])
sage: M*v
(1 + O(5^5), 3 + O(5^5))
sage: v[0]*M[0,0] + v[1]*M[0,1]
1 + O(5)
sage: v[0]*M[1,0] + v[1]*M[1,1]
3 + O(5)
```

This is an even worse example, which could be a different bug

```
sage: vv = vector(x)
sage: vv
(0)
sage: vv[0]
0
sage: x
O(5)
```

I must admit that I have not searched through the tracs to see if this is a duplicate. Sorry.

Resolving the bug would result in the resolution of #4656, too, I believe.

I found this bug also, while working on #9457.  After a fair bit of struggling with elliptic curve code, I now think this is a significant part of the problem.

I noticed the following also; I can't tell if it's the same bug or not.

```
sage: R = QQ.completion(5,5)
sage: P.<T> = R[]
sage: Q.<T> = R[[]]
sage: P(R(0).add_bigoh(-1))
(O(5^-1))
sage: Q(R(0).add_bigoh(-1))
0
sage: P(R(0).add_bigoh(2))
(O(5^2))
sage: Q(R(0).add_bigoh(2))
0
sage: Q(R(1).add_bigoh(2))
1 + O(5^2)
sage: Q(R(1).add_bigoh(-1))
0
sage: Q(R(1/25).add_bigoh(-1))
5^-2 + O(5^-1)
```

I narrowed down the last issue above. (vector calls Sequence which calls list):

```
sage: R = Qp(5,5)
sage: x = R(5).add_bigoh(1)
sage: list(x)
[0]
```

again the element is set to zero. The problem here is different than the original case. In fact list(x) should raise an error, just like list(0) does. 

```
sage: list([x,x]) 
[O(5), O(5)]
```

works correctly. So this is really about matrix multiplication.

Note the very last bug, is not longer a problem in 6.1 as `vv = vector(x)`
raises the error
 `TypeError: this local element is not iterable`
and that should be ok.

In `sage/matrix/matrix0.pyx` (I discovered this when working on #804).  It tries to be too smart for its own good and skips entries of the vector that are equal to 0...  I made a patch and am now testing it.
