Very good. I was hoping that someone would implemented it soon ! Thanks a lot.

I will have a look at it. (And add more documentation to it : You normalised the height to be independent of the base field, which is one of the two possible normalisations, and it should be documented)

Excellent -- I will look at it too.  I have implemented this more than once, so know the algorithm well.

Any reason not to use ticket #360 which has been patiently waiting for 3 years?

The patch did not apply to 4.3.4.alpha1.

A rebase is needed.

Hmm... #360 looks like it's also about implementing height bounds as well, which I also plan to do if no one beats me to it, but don't want to wait up to get this in. 

I'll have to get ahold of an alpha to try and rebase it (and document the normalization choice).

I noticed in the docstrings that you specify INPUT variables like this:

```
        1824         INPUT:: 
        1825	            v - a non-archimedean place of the base field of the curve, 
 	1826	                or None, in which case the total nonarchimedian contribution 
 	1827	                is returned 
 	1828	         
 	1829	            prec - working precision, or None in which case the height  
 	1830	                is returned symbolically 
```

I don't think this is so nice in Sphinx, since it is just preformated.  The vast majority of docstrings are formatted like as a list:

```
        1824            INPUT:
        1825	            - ``v`` - a non-archimedean place of the base field of the curve, 
 	1826	              or None, in which case the total nonarchimedian contribution 
 	1827	              is returned 
 	1828	         
 	1829	            - ``prec`` - working precision, or None in which case the height  
 	1830	              is returned symbolically 
```

Note that:
   
* only one colon after "INPUT"
* a dash at the start of each line
* the indentation is two spaces after the dash.

I will later modify this, because I will need the exp() of the local heights for non-archimedean primes as an element in QQ, if I want to implement the p-adic heights over number fields.

You can do exp of an element of QQ just fine.
