Very good. I was hoping that someone would implemented it soon ! Thanks a lot.

I will have a look at it. (And add more documentation to it : You normalised the height to be independent of the base field, which is one of the two possible normalisations, and it should be documented)

Excellent -- I will look at it too.  I have implemented this more than once, so know the algorithm well.

Any reason not to use ticket #360 which has been patiently waiting for 3 years?

Hmm... #360 looks like it's also about implementing height bounds as well, which I also plan to do if no one beats me to it, but don't want to wait up to get this in. 

I'll have to get ahold of an alpha to try and rebase it (and document the normalization choice).

I noticed in the docstrings that you specify INPUT variables like this:

```
        1824         INPUT:: 
        1825	            v - a non-archimedean place of the base field of the curve, 
 	1826	                or None, in which case the total nonarchimedian contribution 
 	1827	                is returned 
 	1828	         
 	1829	            prec - working precision, or None in which case the height  
 	1830	                is returned symbolically 
```

I don't think this is so nice in Sphinx, since it is just preformated.  The vast majority of docstrings are formatted like as a list:

```
        1824            INPUT:
        1825	            - ``v`` - a non-archimedean place of the base field of the curve, 
 	1826	              or None, in which case the total nonarchimedian contribution 
 	1827	              is returned 
 	1828	         
 	1829	            - ``prec`` - working precision, or None in which case the height  
 	1830	              is returned symbolically 
```

Note that:
   
* only one colon after "INPUT"
* a dash at the start of each line
* the indentation is two spaces after the dash.

For consistency with the original code, and for speed (not that it should matter much).

You can do exp of an element of QQ just fine.

Replying to [@categorie](#comment:11):
> I have put up a rebased patch with a few minor changes. But I have not included yet the documentation on the normalization. You write "THE BSD formula", but there is not a unique standard way of stating the conjecture, I fear. Also the question is whether or not you divide the height pairing by two or not. Could you clarify this ?

OK, I have expanded the normalization section, borrowing heavily from the explanation found in John Cremona's book. 

> I deleted the assumption that E was defined over Q. I don't think you will need that. Maybe it is needed that the model is integral, but I do not see where you would require the curve to be defined over Q. Please correct me if I am wrong.

Yes, you are correct. (There are examples to this effect.) 

> By the way the diff of our two patches comes mainly from converting tabs to spaces.

They were not of my doing, but thanks for expunging them.
