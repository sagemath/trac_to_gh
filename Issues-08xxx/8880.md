<a id='comment:4'></a>Design-wise, it seems a little uncomfortable to have all extra keywords passed on to the solvers.  How annoying would it be to have a solver_opt keyword for options passed down?  So something like:

edge_cut(solver_opt=dict(option1=true, option2='solve fast', option3=5))

or

edge_cut(solver_opt={'option1': true, 'option2': 'solve fast', 'option3': 5})

instead of 

edge_cut(option1=true, option2='solve fast', option3=5)

It involves a bit more typing, but it seems like a much cleaner design.

My concerns are:

1. the options are not related to the actual function, so logically they should be separated out from the function options
2. Anytime we implement a new option for the function (say we make a graph-theoretic algorithm to do the same thing), we have to check all solvers to see if we are accidentally overriding a keyword option for the solver.

You could also make the options part of the solver keyword, like this:

edge_cut(solver=("CPLEX", dict(option1=True, option2=False)))

or

edge_cut(solver=dict(option1=True, option2=False)) # pick the default solver, pass in these options.

About #8364, well.. I still agree with you when you say a dict is cleaner, but it will definitely be very quickly annoying to do all this when you just want to change the solver.. And to be honest, there are only 2 different arguments which can be passed down to the MixedIntegerLinearProgram at the moment :

* log ( verbosity)
* solver (change the default solver)

It may be beter though, to satisfy all of us, to just replace this **kwds by these two parameters... So I will completely rewrite #8364 like this if you agree, which needed to be done anyway as its patch is not based on the latest version of sage :-)

(And now I replace the patch contained in this ticket with the good onem you'll see it is much easier to review :-) )

Thank you again !!

Good point.  "log" didn't seem to be the usual convention.  It would be more conventional to use a "verbose" keyword for printing out lots of intermediate information.
