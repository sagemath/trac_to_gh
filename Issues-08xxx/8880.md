<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

Design-wise, it seems a little uncomfortable to have all extra keywords passed on to the solvers.  How annoying would it be to have a solver_opt keyword for options passed down?  So something like:

edge_cut(solver_opt=dict(option1=true, option2='solve fast', option3=5))

or

edge_cut(solver_opt={'option1': true, 'option2': 'solve fast', 'option3': 5})

instead of 

edge_cut(option1=true, option2='solve fast', option3=5)

It involves a bit more typing, but it seems like a much cleaner design.

(I guess my comment is the same here as it is on #8364.  I still think it's a better design, but I haven't used these options in practice, so if you think that it is way too annoying, then say so.

My concerns are:

1. the options are not related to the actual function, so logically they should be separated out from the function options
2. Anytime we implement a new option for the function (say we make a graph-theoretic algorithm to do the same thing), we have to check all solvers to see if we are accidentally overriding a keyword option for the solver.

You could also make the options part of the solver keyword, like this:

edge_cut(solver=("CPLEX", dict(option1=True, option2=False)))

or

edge_cut(solver=dict(option1=True, option2=False)) # pick the default solver, pass in these options.

About #8364, well.. I still agree with you when you say a dict is cleaner, but it will definitely be very quickly annoying to do all this when you just want to change the solver.. And to be honest, there are only 2 different arguments which can be passed down to the MixedIntegerLinearProgram at the moment :

* log ( verbosity)
* solver (change the default solver)

It may be beter though, to satisfy all of us, to just replace this **kwds by these two parameters... So I will completely rewrite #8364 like this if you agree, which needed to be done anyway as its patch is not based on the latest version of sage :-)

Good point.  "log" didn't seem to be the usual convention.  It would be more conventional to use a "verbose" keyword for printing out lots of intermediate information.

Even with this patch, the first time I use p.solve(), I see this from CPLEX:

```
IBM ILOG License Manager: "IBM ILOG Optimization Suite for Academic Initiative" is accessing CPLEX 12 with option(s): "e m b q ".
```

Is that unavoidable?  (Maybe it's desirable, I don't know)

I had thought during my first tests that this message was a nice way to debug, though it's true the user only needs to incrase the verbosity to see it... Thank you for this "finally" keyword which I ignored :-)

Patch updated.
