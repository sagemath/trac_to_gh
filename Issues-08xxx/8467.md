Move the document "Linear Programming in Sage", found [here](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/constructions/linear_programming.html) and [here](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nathann.Cohen/tut/LP/), to the classification "Thematic Tutorials". The original proposal can be found on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/95afb345e872f9af) and [sage-combinat-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/msg/662eb0246c7bf9fc).



**Notes:** The current ticket needs to be coordinated with #8470.

Depends on #7311

The methods detailed in this Howto, along with some features used, makes it dependent also on :

* #2203
* #7311
* #7476

Here is where I have for the moment. I still need to rewrite LP examples for some problems, but at least I reformatted everything for Sphinx.

It will require the new LP patch enabling a new syntax for constraints #7311

I've read up to the "Maximum average degree" problem, and I have some found some errata:

* line 63: Errata on example LP
* line 161: maximization instead of minimization
* line 177: missing objective function
* line 200-204: problem not written properly
* line 204: alternative formulation with only one variable for each edge

I adjoint a rst file with corrections. The example on "Maximum average degree" is correct but I find it harder to follow than the previous ones, for a non-expert in graph-theory. I don't know which is the target audience...

Attachment: **[linear_programming2_some_changes.rst.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8467/linear_programming2_some_changes.rst.gz)**

Thank you very much for reading it until then !!! Actually, I will need to change some parts of it now that GLPK is a standard SPKG. I will also update the end of it, to give more natural examples :-)

I am setting it to "needs work" until this is done !!
