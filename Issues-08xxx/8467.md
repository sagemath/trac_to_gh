Here is where I have for the moment. I still need to rewrite LP examples for some problems, but at least I reformatted everything for Sphinx.

It will require the new LP patch enabling a new syntax for constraints #7311

<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
I've read up to the "Maximum average degree" problem, and I have some found some errata:

* line 63: Errata on example LP
* line 161: maximization instead of minimization
* line 177: missing objective function
* line 200-204: problem not written properly
* line 204: alternative formulation with only one variable for each edge

I adjoint a rst file with corrections. The example on "Maximum average degree" is correct but I find it harder to follow than the previous ones, for a non-expert in graph-theory. I don't know which is the target audience...

Thank you very much for reading it until then !!! Actually, I will need to change some parts of it now that GLPK is a standard SPKG. I will also update the end of it, to give more natural examples :-)

I am setting it to "needs work" until this is done !!
