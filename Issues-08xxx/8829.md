Implementation of saturation of points on elliptic curves over number fields.  Original patch by Robert Bradshaw in 2010, refactored and made into a git branch by John Cremona in 2015.

I also implemented the simple case of E.gens() for E(K) when E/Q and [K:Q] = 2.

I have had a quick look and will go through this in more detail later (after #8828 is completed, probably).  I spent a long time on my C++ implementation of this (over QQ but the algorithm is general) so am quite familiar with the details.

Here are two references you should give:  [1] S. Siksek "Infinite descent on elliptic curves", Rocky Mountain J of M, Vol 25 No. 4 (1995), 1501-1538.  [2] M. Prickett, "Saturation of Mordell-Weil groups of elliptic curves over number fields", U of Nottingham PhD thesis (2004), http://etheses.nottingham.ac.uk/52/.

Martin Prickett implemented this in Magma, but the code was very slow and hard to read so it never got incorporated into Magma releases.

Incidentally, it was for this that I implemented group structure for curves over GF(q) in the first place!  In my C++ implementation I cache a lot of the information of this group structure so that when you do p-saturation for larger and larger p, the structures are already there.  A good example is to take one of those curves of very high rank:  I think I once successfully p-saturated the rank 24 curve at all p < `10^6`  (the bound was totally out of reach, something like `10^100`).

Another point which might be useful over number fields:  it suffices to use degree one primes to reduce modulo.

The way I do it is consider many p at once, and for each curve over GF(q) I see which primes in my set it could help with, though this won't scale as far. I'm sure there's still lots of room for improvement. 

> A good example is to take one of those curves of very high rank:  I think I once successfully p-saturated the rank 24 curve at all p < `10^6`  (the bound was totally out of reach, something like `10^100`).


That reminds me--I was wondering if there's any way to go from min(h(P)) to a bound on the regulator for rank > 1. 

> Another point which might be useful over number fields:  it suffices to use degree one primes to reduce modulo.


Good point. Those get pretty rare for large degree number fields though, right?

Patch applies fine to 4.4.1 and tests pass.

This functionality is badly needed!

We now have heights for points on curves defined over number_fields
but no associated regulator function.  I suggest that the function
regulator_of_points() be moved up from ell_rational_field to
ell_number_field.  This tcan then be called instead of the code in
lines 424-432 [line numbers are from the patched file, not the patch].

Line 439 uses a function self.height_function() which does not exist.
This block needs to be replaced by something sensible.  If one has a lower bound on the height of non-torsion
points, then a bound on the index can be deduced from standard
geometry of numbers estimates.   To get such a lower bound, see papers
of Cremona & Siksek (over Q) and Thongjunthug (over number fields) for
an algorithm which would need to be implemented.  (Not hard over Q,
not much harder for totally real fields, quite a lot worse over fields
with a complex embedding).  Until this is done, I don't think this
saturation function can allow maxprime==0.

In the rank one code:   when large primes p (say, over 20!) are being
tested then the division_points code will be expensive since it
involves constructing the multiplication-by-p map.  I would recommend
using a reduction strategy here just as in the general case.  To check
p-saturation just find primes q such that #E(Fq) is divisible by p and
then see if the reduction of P mod q is a multiple of p.  This will
almost always prove saturation very quickly.  If it fails for several
(say 5) q then try to divide P by p;  else use more q, and so on.
There is one theoretical drawback here:  this strategy might fail if
there is a rational p-isogeny.  Over Q,  we know which p this might
happen for and I would first test for the existence of isogenies of
primes degree, and use the division test (as here) for any primes that
show up.  Over number fields that's harder to deal with, but again we
can fall back on the division test to rpove that P cannot be divided
by p.

The function list_of_multiples(P,n) duplicated the generic function
multiples() which I wrote for just this sort of purpose!

I don't like the loop through all linear combinations for small
primes.  Even with p=2 there are curves with 24 independent points out
there and `2^24` divisions is not nice to contemplate.  If you want this
short cut, do it based on the size of `p^r`.

The main code with reduction etc looks fine to me (but I did not check
the logic rigorously).

The gens function for E(K) when E is defined over Q and [K:Q]=2 looks
fine.  For a more general case we could always try using
simon_two_descent (followed by saturation).  Trying such an examples
led me to:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-2)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([a,0])
sage: P = E(0,0)
sage: P.has_finite_order()
True
sage: P.order()
2
sage: P.height()
0
sage: E.saturation([P], verbose=True, max_prime=5)
## infinite loop
```
This is caused as follows:   The height matrix is [0] with det=0 but
reg / min(heights) is NaN so reg / min(heights) < 1e-6 is False!.
This will need fixing.  At the very least, I would discard any points
of finite order before doing anything else with them.  Then
min(heights) will never be 0.

Most of the above is easy to deal with.  The hard part is computing a
suitable max_prime form a lower height bound on points.  I suggest
that for now you make it compulsory to have a positive max_prime and
add a TODO.

I found the loop through all linear combinations to be much faster in practice for small primes, but the hard coded `p == 2` case was left by accident, I meant to cap that on `p^r` as I did the others.

OK -- looking forward to it!  I'll take a look at #8828 by then as well.

Current branch works but more doctests and testing are needed; so not ready for review yet.

I did a lot of rewriting of the main saturation routine, separating off p-saturation and also allowing saturation to be done at just one prime.  This is a useful special case, since if you take the images of some saturated points under a p-isogeny the images may not be p-saturated but will still be saturated at all other primes.

In the sieve I restrict to primes of degree 1.  It is a Theorem (see http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/10052/) that this will suffice to prove p-saturation, provided that one does use reductions with p-rank 2 and not just those of p-rank 1 as originally suggested by Siksek in https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/8323 .

I will mark this as ready for review so the bots get to work on it, and of course humans are welcome to look at the new code, but I will now test it thoroughly on the LMFDB curves and report back.

Hello,

1) indent correctly the INPUT and OUTPUT fields:

```
INPUT:

- first thing
  goes one there (note the shift of 2 characters)
```

2) use the new syntax for raise:

```
raise MyError("is rich")
```

Point 1 may be the source of the doc build failure found by the bot:

OSError: [plane_cur] /home/patchbot/sage-patchbot/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_number_field.py:docstring of sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_number_field.EllipticCurve_number_field.saturation:9: WARNING: Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

Progress report:  I am currently running the p-saturation (for single primes) on lots of LMFDB curves and all is well so far.  This is almost always for very small p (mainly 2 and 3) though, since I am starting with some saturated points on one curve (provided by Magma) and using p-isogenies to map to other curves in the isogeny class.  Higher degree isogenies are not so common.

I did start to veryify that the points from Magma were fully saturated, but ran into problems computing the saturation index, using (line 3717) the lower bound on the height of all non-torsion points -- previously implemented and merged i n6.3 (see #8828).

K.<phi> = NumberField(x^2-x-1) # Q(sqrt(5))
E = EllipticCurve([phi + 1, -phi + 1, 1, 20*phi - 39, 196*phi + 237])
H = E.height_function()
H.min(.1,10,verbose=True) #  does not appear to terminate
```

Strictly this is about the code merged in #8828, but it will need fixing here before we can let this (useful!) function out into the world.

The latest branch I just pushed has some merges in it which were not intended but I hope that will not cause any problems -- as well as merging 6.9.beta6 I also merged by branch 'isogs' which has been merged into beta7.

One bug fix addresses the previous comment -- after re-reading my own 2006 paper I found that the original implementer from #8828 had missed one point (when mu is halved one must increment n_max in order to guarantee termination).   A small additional improvement in the same place (the method min_gr() in height.py) now gives a small improvement in the bound, which is why one doctest there has been changed.

The second bug was to do with mutability of lists giving unwanted side effects, and is commented at the point in the source which has changed.

It is likely that users who call the saturation() method will also want to lll_reduce() the output but I have not made that automatic.

I will set this to needs_review once my own full test has completed.

Hello ! some dollars there :

```
+        For rank 1 subgroups, simply do trial divison up to the maximal
+        prime divisor. For higher rank subgroups, perform trial divison
+        on all linear combinations for small primes, and look for
+        projections $E(K) \rightarrow \oplus E(k) \otimes \FF_p$ which
+        are either full rank or provide p-divisble linear combinations,

```
+    def projections(Q, p):

which is indeed an inner function, but quite a complicated one. Maybe just explain its input and output ?

* There's something weird with the indentation at `for Q in K.primes_above(q, degree=1):` in `p_saturation` (it looks only indented one space).
* There are various points where you don't have spaces around `==` and `+=`.  If you feel like fixing it, I think that spaces are the Python coding standard.
* At various points you add commented out code (either verbose print statements or the definition of `pair_max`).  I'm fine with what you have, but I could also see just deleting it.  I just wanted to make sure that the decision to include it, commented out, was conscious.

I first merged in the current develop (and fixed one small conflict).  this required a rebuild (i.e. 'make' not just './sage -b' which failed).

I fixed that indentation issue -- logically correct but of course non-standard to have just one space of indentation.  I hope the result is OK, that indented block was very long and had a lot of subsidiary indented parts.

I have fixed all (I hope) the == and += spacing.

I changed some commented-out debugging print statements into comments.  I like having lots of comments since the logic is quite complicated (and if further bugs are found it may well be me who has to fix them so I might as well be helpful).

I'll test the example from comment 5 once the rebuild has finished.
