The aim is to enhance the `/sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx` file with cython's properties to call `self.transpose()` and other methods more quickly. A shortcut like` self.T` is resolved to `self.transpose()`. Shortcuts should be similar to other environments like `numpy`.  Shortcuts added are:

* m.T -> m.transpose()
* m.I -> m.inverse()
* m.C -> m.conjugate()
* m.H -> m.conjugate().transpose()

Robert, is there an efficiency gain or some reason why one would prefer the Cython property statement to what is in this patch?

I see one doctest in matrix2.pyx failing, but that's because the expected output was wrong (it's the test for M.H in the conjugate() method).

Okay, maybe my changes should be reviewed (since they fix some of the doc issues).  

Doctests pass in matrix/*.py[x] with these patches applied, and Harald's code looks good, so positive review for his patch (given that my doctest patch is applied).  

Someone should verify my doctest changes are good.

Jason and Harald,

Thanks for putting this together.  I'd like to finish up getting this reviewed.  But two questions:

1.  It seems like there is evidence of the shortcuts in each of the associated docstrings for the methods, but maybe it isn't always obvious.  Like  `A.I` seems to be buried along with the `~` version and has no real explanation that it is a property.  I find students get very confused with method calls with empty parentheses, and a property will just add to that, so I think it would be better to have some explanation.

2.  #10471  implements `conjugate_transpose()` until we reclaim `adjoint()`.  So that would be the place to add in the shortcut.  Should we add that here since #10471 has a positive review, and maybe change the definition?

I can do the above on a reviewer patch in the next day or two if necessary.

Rob

These are some of the earliest entries in the reference manual for `sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx`, so I think the documentation should include some examples, especially since the syntax is different (no parentheses).  However, INPUT and OUTPUT blocks feel like make-work, so I have not included that.

I can give a positive review to everything up to my latest patch.  If somebody would review my (documentation-only) changes, this could be done.

Maybe on another ticket, but can I ask for one more enhancement on this?  Can we make the following work:

```
matrix("""

""")

(i.e., any "]" or "[" next to row delimiters are stripped).  That would mean that I could cut and paste output from Sage back into Sage to make a matrix.
