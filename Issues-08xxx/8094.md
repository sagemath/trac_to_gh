The aim is to enhance the `/sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx` file with cython's properties to call `self.transpose()` and other methods more quickly. A shortcut like` self.T` is resolved to `self.transpose()`. Shortcuts should be similar to other environments like `numpy`.  Shortcuts added are:

* m.T -> m.transpose()
* m.I -> m.inverse()
* m.C -> m.conjugate()
* m.H -> m.conjugate().transpose()

Okay, maybe my changes should be reviewed (since they fix some of the doc issues).  

Doctests pass in matrix/*.py[x] with these patches applied, and Harald's code looks good, so positive review for his patch (given that my doctest patch is applied).  

Someone should verify my doctest changes are good.

<a id='comment:17'></a>Jason and Harald,

Thanks for putting this together.  I'd like to finish up getting this reviewed.  But two questions:

1.  It seems like there is evidence of the shortcuts in each of the associated docstrings for the methods, but maybe it isn't always obvious.  Like  `A.I` seems to be buried along with the `~` version and has no real explanation that it is a property.  I find students get very confused with method calls with empty parentheses, and a property will just add to that, so I think it would be better to have some explanation.

2.  #10471  implements `conjugate_transpose()` until we reclaim `adjoint()`.  So that would be the place to add in the shortcut.  Should we add that here since #10471 has a positive review, and maybe change the definition?

I can do the above on a reviewer patch in the next day or two if necessary.

Rob

<a id='comment:19'></a>These are some of the earliest entries in the reference manual for `sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx`, so I think the documentation should include some examples, especially since the syntax is different (no parentheses).  However, INPUT and OUTPUT blocks feel like make-work, so I have not included that.

I can give a positive review to everything up to my latest patch.  If somebody would review my (documentation-only) changes, this could be done.

I did some maintenance on the main patch, naming it "v2".  Has Harald's user info and is now a proper hg patch.  I hope.  

Should now be ready to go, since I did not change any code, so should not need a review.

Yep, sorry. I would have done it myself but failed to recall Harald's e-mail address that moment; then later was simply too busy to search which ticket it was...

Think so. Only meta data (including line numbers) differ.

As I had other trouble with the release, I think I can still include it.
