When quitting we see

```
Exiting SAGE (CPU time 0m0.04s, Wall time 0m0.63s).
```
and there are several other places where "SAGE" is output instead of "Sage".

The patch changes these.  I tested the whole library: no doctests needed changing at all.  But maybe there are other issues which I did not think of.

I don't know how to change the file c_lib/src/interrupt.c safely since it is not included in the cloning system.  Can you either tell me how to do that, or do it yourself?

Meanwhile I have added to the patch to deal with file misc/sagedoc.py so that the latex control sequences \sage and \SAGE (and also \Sage) convert to 'Sage' instead of 'SAGE'.  I am not too sure of the reperucssions of this (it will surely change a lot o the documentation, but not affect doctests), so I am cc-ing jpalmieri and hope that he will comment.

I testing the whole sage library and all tests passed.
