This patch is a part of the following series adding support for cones/fans and toric varieties to Sage:

Prerequisites:

#8675 - Remove `AmbientSpace._constructor` and fix consequences

#8682 - Improve `AlgebraicScheme_subscheme.__init__` and `AmbientSpace._validate`

#8694 - Improve schemes printing and LaTeXing

#8934 - Trivial bug in computing faces of non-full-dimensional lattice polytopes

#8936 - Expose facet inequalities for lattice polytopes

#8941 - `_latex_` and `origin` for lattice polytopes

#9514 - sage/symbolic/random_tests.py wrongly depends on order of dict.values()

Main patches adding new modules:

#9062 - Add support for toric lattices

#8986 - Add support for convex rational polyhedral cones

#8987 - Add support for rational polyhedral fans

#8988 - Add support for toric varieties

#8989 - Add support for Fano toric varieties

Known issues:

- The last two patches show a doctest coverage error about `TestSuite`. This doctest does not work yet for other schemes and therefore should not be expected to work for these derived classes (and indeed - it does not work). According to
http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/a42ace80078373b4
this should not be an obstacle to include these patches.

I've read through the code and it looks good. 

One minor issue is that the `_repr_()` is not very descriptive. For example

```
sage: p0 = P1xP1.affine_patch(0)
sage: p0
Toric variety of dimension 2
sage: p0.embedding_morphism()
Scheme morphism:
  From: Toric variety of dimension 2
  To:   Toric variety of dimension 2
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending [z0 : z3] to
        [z0 : 1 : 1 : z3]
```
Maybe we could return `Toric variety (dim=2, #cones=4)` or so and include the number of generating cones to be able to distinguish the different varieties.

Apart from that I'd be happy to review it positively once the rewritten `Fan` is incorporated!

How about this?

```
Toric variety of dimension 2 with 4 affine patches
```
I would like to have a description in "plain English" and also patches seem to be more intrinsic to varieties than cones.

It may be good also to add an option for "extra" name, so that varieties from a named database (which is not there yet but I hope to have it eventually based on your code) can print as 

```
Toric variety of dimension 2 with 4 affine patches (P1xP1)
```
or maybe

```
P1xP1 (Toric variety of dimension 2 with 4 affine patches)
```
will be better. There is a way to rename anything in Sage, so

```
P1xP1
```
is very easy to do, but seems to be too different from the default one. Which one of three do you prefer?

It is also possible to print the base field, but I deliberately didn't do it so far because I always think of toric varieties as being defined over complex field. Plus, when the base field is a fraction field of a multivariable polynomial ring (as is the case with ambient spaces of anticanonical hypersurfaces in the next patch), the the description of the field gets really big and distracts from the toric variety itself.

Hi Volker,

I have done some work on the documentation from your patch and got completely stuck at `Mori_vectors`. Problems from smaller to bigger ones:

* Are we allowed to use non-standard characters? I mean "a with dots" in Kaehler. I vaguely remember some discussion about it, but don't recall the result. Personally I prefer to use only characters that are easy to type and display for everyone. It does mean that some names are not accurately represented, but having one of such names I can vote in favour of it ;-) 

* Your doctest uses toric varieties library which depends on this patch. It is a good non-trivial doctest, so I have no desire to remove it.

* Why does it return vectors rather than cone (in the same way as `Kaehler_cone`)?

* Kaehler and Mori cones are supposed to be dual, but they are not. Because Kaehler cone is given in some coordinates on the class group and Mori cone is given embedded into a higher dimensional space without a choice of a basis for its "real space". Both representations are probably useful and should be available, but it should be done consistently.

So:

* I have removed my `kaehler_cone` method from the main patch, hopefully now you can give it a positive review together with symbolic doctest fixes only.

* I have uploaded a new patch which contains your rebased changes and my edits to the documentation. It should NOT be applied here, I just wanted to save this code. As a patch it now just contains three new functions and can be easily moved to other tickets, where the library of toric varieties will be available to use in doctests. We will also need to take care of the last two points above.

Let me know what you think of all this.

Andrey

I think (strongly ;-)) that `Kaehler_cone` method should return a cone in the class group in some basis, since such cones with some additions form a complete fan of the GKZ decomposition.

We should, however, have a clear way of going from divisors associated to rays to this basis and, perhaps, a way to go back. The first is easy, the i-th ray is represented by the i-th column of the Gale transform matrix. However, it may not be obvious and does not feel natural, since one has to involve functions of the fan, rather than toric variety directly.

For `Mori_cone` I would prefer to get the "traditional dual" of the `Kaehler_cone`, i.e. just the cone formed by facet normals, because it is confusing otherwise.

Again, there should be a clean way to go from any vector in the ambient space of `Mori_cone` to the longer vector with clear interpretation of each entry. I am OK with having a special function for the generators of the Mori cone and your proposed name is fine (although I have always seen this abbreviation as GLSM and would prefer all-capital version).

**Regarding this ticket**, my main point is that these functions require some more work and since they operate with divisors, perhaps we can move them to the ticket implementing divisors? Or, in order to avoid adding more stuff there and therefore potentially delaying it, I can create a new ticket for implementing all of the above (including, finally, `cone.dual` to make `Mori_cone` trivial).

In #9337 I did implement a `divisor.rational_class()` method that returns what you want. But there is no canonical way to go from divisor class -> divisor, so the computation of Kahler cones does not depend on the implementation of toric divisors.

I agree that `Mori_cone()` should return just `Kahler_cone().dual()` and we can implement that later.

GLSM is fine with me, too.

If you want to split off the Kahler cone computation from this ticket then thats fine with me. But we should then make it an independent ticket and not lump into toric divisors.

<a id='comment:34'>Comment 34:</a>
The order of the output of `sage_getvariablename` is in the memory order of some python `dict`, so the doctest had to fail at one point. I grepped through the sage library and the only use of `sage_getvariablename` is in `sage/matrix/matrix0.pyx` where the order of items is actually not used. 

So davidloeffler's fix of sorting the output of `sage_getvariablename` is safe and the right thing to do to return a deterministic output. I give it a positive review.
