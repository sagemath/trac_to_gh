This patch:

- Introduces two new categories: FiniteGroups and FinitePermutationGroups
- As a result, this standardizes the interface of those groups
  (cardinality, one, ...).

- Puts all pari, permutation, and matrix groups in the corresponding
  categories. There remains to handle Galois groups in
  sage/rings/number_field/.

- Deprecates the abstract class sage.groups.group.FiniteGroup.
  Content moved to the FiniteGroups category (see ``cayley_graph``).
  It is not used anymore anywhere in Sage's library.

- Merges cayley_graph with that for FiniteSemigroups:
  - Generalization to any Semigroups with an ``elements`` option
    (should this be vertices?) to handle large/infinite semigroups
  - The call:
        sage: G.cayley_graph(connecting_set = [a,b,c])
    is deprecated in favor of:
        sage: G.cayley_graph(generators     = [a,b,c])
  - The following feature is removed:
      sage: G.cayley_graph(connecting_set = a)
  - side = "right" is now the default (was "twosided" for semigroups).
  - Removed forcing ``implementation = "networkx"`` in the produced graph.
    Note: this changed the order of the edges, which required fixing
    a test in sage.graphs.generic_graphs (color_by_label)

- Adds cool examples of Cayley graphs plots, courtesy of Sebastien Labbe

- Provides group_generators defined from gens, as well as
  semigroup_generators defined from group_generators in the finite
  and coxeter cases.

- Puts the SymmetricGroup in the FiniteWeylGroups category.
  Beware: as all Sage's permutation groups, this uses GAP's product
  convention coming from left-to-right composition of permutations,
  which can be surprising for combinatorists.
  Beware: the generators of SymmetricGroup(n) are now its canonical
  Weyl group generators, namely the elementary transpositions
- Adds an has_descent method to permutation group elements

- Makes all named permutation groups, as well as GL and SL have
  UniqueRepresentation,

- Makes more systematic use of TestSuite(...).run()
- Makes a minor improvement to FiniteEnumeratedSets tests for
  large finite enumerated sets
- Strips away some unused imports
- Updates a couple doctests here and there

Further debatable changes:

- The underlying set of an alternating or symmetric group is now a
  tuple. This is safer and helps UniqueRepresentation. However, this
  could break backward compatibility.  Also, the repr is now of the
  form SymmetricGroup((1,3,4)) instead of SymmetricGroup([1,3,4]).

- Due to the switch to UniqueRepresentation, with:

       sage: F = GF(3); MS = MatrixSpace(F,2,2)
       sage: gens = [MS([[0,1],[1,0]]),MS([[1,1],[0,1]])]
       sage: G = MatrixGroup(gens)
       sage: H = GL(2,F)

  the following equality test fails:

       sage: H == G
	True

   Do we really want this feature? If yes, than the equality test
   inherited from UniqueRepresentation will have to be fixed.

Attachment: **[trac_8044_cayley_graph-sl.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8044/trac_8044_cayley_graph-sl.patch.gz)**

I just added a patch which adds some examples of cayley graphs.

It also adds `FiniteGroup` to the base classes of `MatrixGroup_gap_finite_field`.

:-) 

Being able to choose at run time the category, and therefore the class hierarchy, as we could do in MuPAD, was one of my big incentive for writing the category code, and going for dynamic classes.

The category part looks fine to me. This is an amazing patch, btw!

I am getting some doctests failures:


```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


        sage -t  "devel/sage/doc/en/tutorial/tour_advanced.rst"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/doc/fr/tutorial/tour_advanced.rst"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/categories/finite_groups.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/categories/finite_permutation_groups.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/groups/pari_group.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/r.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/groebner_fan.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py"
```

though they don't seem too serious.

There are a couple of "The category of (multiplicative) finite semigroups" in the docstrings that should be corrected.

For the rest, assuming that the doctest pass (it might be something with my sage, will try with a clean install at the office in a couple of hours), positive review.

For the record, could you please post or attach here the complete log of the failures, even if it works at your office?

Oops, good catch. The updated patch fixes this.
