On Cygwin, Sage needs c99 complex support which can be provided by the cephes library from netlib.org / www.moshier.net

There is an spkg at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhansen/cygwin_port/cephes-2.8.spkg


We need to decide the best way to include this since it is only need on Cygwin (and maybe FreeBSD, etc.).

If yes, then it might be good to include Solaris in the list of architectures for which cephes is installed.

Also, this is a little different than the Solaris issue since Cygwin doesn't have a complex.h, which is what the spkg provides.
