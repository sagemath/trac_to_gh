The symmerica package says in SPKG.txt

```
== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

Against common policy the patches in the patches directory have been applied to 
the src directory:

 * de.patch (Turn off banner)
 * macro.h.patch (Change some return types, this can be avoided)
 * makefile.patch (Fix compiler, inject CFLAGS)
 * sort_sum_rename.patch (rename sort tp sym_sort, sum to sym_sum) 
```

It would appear various patches have been made to the source code. 


http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/portability/symmetrica-2.0.p5/

has an updated version of symmetica, which will build with any compiler, and in 64-bit mode. However, it does not resolve the issue of patching the source directly. I modified the makefile, which had already been modified before. A patch was left, so I have tried to recreate the original makefile. But other files have been changed too. The packages is basically a bit of a mess

Has this been fixed already? Looks like the text you quoted no longer exists in SPKG.txt in symmetrica-2.0.p7.spkg, which currently ships with Sage.
