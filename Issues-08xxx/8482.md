Task: in the static documentation that appears embedded in the
notebook upon, say,

        sage: sage.categories.primer?

add a link to the corresponding live documentation page
(e.g. http://localhost:8000/doc/live/reference/sage/categories/primer.html)

This would be very handy, and make a strong advertisement for the live
documentation (a really cool feature that I had never stumbled upon
until Mike hinted me about it; and apparently, no one at Sage 20 knew
about it either).
