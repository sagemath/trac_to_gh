Hi,

The following seems like strange behavior to me.

In [1]: V=VectorSpace(GF(2),2)
In [2]: V([1,3])
Out[2]: (1, 1)
In [3]: V([1,-3])
Out[3]: (1, 0)

I would expect the last answer to be (1,1).
```

If after line 150 of vector_mod2_dense.pyx, you put the line:

```
print xi, type(xi), xi%2
```
you see that the problem happens because in the Cython file, -1%2 is -1, not 1.  Apparently the C standard doesn't specify what happens if you mod with a negative number; some compilers return positive numbers, some return negative numbers.

Here is a patch which fixes the issue.  I don't have time to formalize it and upload it right now.
