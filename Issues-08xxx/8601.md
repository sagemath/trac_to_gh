Hi,

The following seems like strange behavior to me.

In [1]: V=VectorSpace(GF(2),2)
In [2]: V([1,3])
Out[2]: (1, 1)
In [3]: V([1,-3])
Out[3]: (1, 0)

I would expect the last answer to be (1,1).
```

As a workaround:

```
sage: vector(GF(2),[1,-3])

```

Note that the category seems autogenerated or something since I can't get the source:

```
sage: type(GF(2)^2)

sage: sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule_ambient_field_with_category??
Object `sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule_ambient_field_with_category` not found.

```

```
sage: (GF(2)^10)(range(-5,5))

If after line 150 of vector_mod2_dense.pyx, you put the line:

```
print xi, type(xi), xi%2
```
you see that the problem happens because in the Cython file, -1%2 is -1, not 1.  Apparently the C standard doesn't specify what happens if you mod with a negative number; some compilers return positive numbers, some return negative numbers.

Here is a patch which fixes the issue.  I don't have time to formalize it and upload it right now.
