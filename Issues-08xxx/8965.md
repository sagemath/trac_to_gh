The only patch needed now is trac_8965_decorate.patch.  (I couldn't figure out how to delete the others.)  It reverts to the original implementation of Parallel.__call__, since the simpler one didn't handle the case where the function being wrapped can be called with no arguments.  The latest patch includes doctests for this situation.

The latest patch only changes documentation or comments, besides one whitespace change to the code.
