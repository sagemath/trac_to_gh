Without some way to be able to see what you have changed, it is difficult to review. Again, without a patch, it could never be integrated with anyone else that might change this package. 

I really like the fact that you have made a complete .spkg file, as patches are difficult to review too. But having both, it's possible to see the changes, and test it complete.
