Without some way to be able to see what you have changed, it is difficult to review. Again, without a patch, it could never be integrated with anyone else that might change this package. 

I really like the fact that you have made a complete .spkg file, as patches are difficult to review too. But having both, it's possible to see the changes, and test it complete.

That's fine. My only long-term concern is that hard-coding -m64 is not a great idea, since it is not portable, but hopefully we will have a solution to that. 

I've changed it to 'defect'  rather than 'enhancement', as the latter is supposed to be used where you have enhanced Sage - i.e normally by adding functionality, or similar. But in this case you have corrected a defect.
