Something is wrong with the post_isomorphism of isogenies of elliptic curves :

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(17), [0,-1,0,-3,-1])
sage: P = E([16,0])
sage: phi = E.isogeny(P,codomain=E)
sage: phi(P)
(9 : 11 : 1)
sage: phi(P) in E
False
```

Wow. That was **very** quick. But maybe a bit too quick.

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a1')
sage: phi = E.isogeny(None,codomain=EllipticCurve('11a2'),degree=5)
sage: [phi(P) for P in E.torsion_points()]
[(0 : 1 : 0), (1/3 : 1/2 : 1), (1/3 : 1/2 : 1), (1/3 : 1/2 : 1), (1/3 : 1/2 : 1)]
```

again the images are not even on the `codomain()`. I.e. there is probably a second spot that needs a small change.

What about lines 981, 1002, in the patched file?  They both say 

 ```
           return self.__E2(0)
```
so shouldn't they also be changed to return 0 on the correct codomain?

OK, I trust you -- I tried to find an example where they did not do the right thing, and could not.
