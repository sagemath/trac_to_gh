With #7249 merged, it now seems that no Sage component depends on the "slightly outdated version" of [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/).  If this is indeed true, we can remove `jinja-*.spkg` from the Sage distribution.

Of course, we'll keep the "awesome version", `jinja2-*.spkg`.

With V1 of the patch, `sage -b` gives

```python
[...]

```
The docstring for `jinja2.runtime.TemplateReference` is "The `self` in templates."  But I'm not sure why this happens.  Does Jinja2 not allow `self=self`?

V2 of the patch appears to be OK: `sage -b` works, Sage builds from scratch with `SAGE_CHECK`, the long tests pass.  Did I miss any `self` --> `myself` conversions?  Should I run some other tests?

I'm not familiar with `ext/`, so I've included some names from `hg log gen_interpreters.py` in the Cc: list.

Thanks for fixing up gen_interpreters.py, your changes look fine (and the template output from the patched gen_interpreters.py using jinja2 is byte-for-byte identical to the previous output using jinja).

I tested by starting from sage-4.5.rc1.tar, removing the jinja spkg, and applying install.diff and 4.5.rc1-deps.diff (the original deps.diff would no longer apply, so I rebased it).  I then typed "make", waited for the build to fail, applied trac_8316-remove_jinja.2.patch, and restarted the build.  The build was successfull, and all (long) tests passed.

Positive review.
