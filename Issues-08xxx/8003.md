<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

This patch solves the issues above.

I have also worked a bit on an_padic. I made a short-cut for rank 0 curves. In this case the leading term of the p-adic series is known to be L_ratio, so there is no need to compute the p-adic L-series, the modular symbol at 0 suffices. This speeds up the computation.

The -long doctest decreased to a half of the length, without -long it is a little bit faster. Most of the time for -long is taken up by one example. But it needs to be there as it is the fastest example of a positive rank supersingular case.

Also. I did NOT include a doctest that tests this particular bug here. This is against the rules I know, but I believe that the shortest case in which it can be reproduced would take longer than what is allowed for a doctest. In particular the above axample is not adequate.
