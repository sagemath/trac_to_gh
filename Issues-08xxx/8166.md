Since the new version of NetworkX is being merged into Sage #7608, we could use their max matching algorithm. We already have one, though it uses Linear Programming and is optional :

The efficiency of these two algorithms have to be compared !

Based upon this, the default behaviour could be :
* To always use NetworkX
* Only use it if there is no LP available
* Not to use it if not asked explicitely

**Apply:**

1. #8364

As max_weight_matching had been exposed while I wasn't looking, this ticket now merges the two function into only one, for the better I hope ! :-)

From now on, maximum matching are not optional anymore, and are way faster !

```
sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(50,.3)
sage: %timeit g.matching(algorithm="LP",solver="GLPK")
5 loops, best of 3: 248 ms per loop
sage: %timeit g.matching()
25 loops, best of 3: 16.9 ms per loop
```

The two different ways to solve matchings are kept, just in case.... But network'x version is now the default one, obviously :-)

Requires #8364
