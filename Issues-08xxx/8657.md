The libgcrypt src/tests/ have a subtle linker bug which is exposed by the DSO linking changes for Fedora 13, see https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/UnderstandingDSOLinkChange. This version adds libgpg-error to the link command line.

The change is completely safe and is required to compile libgcrypt on Fedora 13 (beta).
