univariate gcd is performed using euclidean algorithm, which causes explosion of coefficients and is slow but for trivial examples.

For relative number fields, pass to an absolute representation. This may be slow. But for the cases where this is slow the current implementation may be unfeasible.

The pari algorithm is not fast enough. I have implemented a modular algorithm using ntl.

The patch needs doctest and integration in sage (it is, right now, a separate function).

It adds a new function modular_gcd

To test it, apply the patch and

from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_absolute_number_field import modular_gcd

<a id='comment:3'></a>Here there is a cleaner patch.

The patch adds a new class of univariate polynomials whose ground field is an absolute number field. There is a new _gcd method for this class. It actually implements several approaches to the modular gcd algorithm:

Langemyr-McCallum algorithm
Encarnacion
a mixture of the two previous (default)

moreover, a call to pari method and the old Euclidean method.

I think that there should be only one modular algorithm, but, as usual, there are cases in which any of them beats the others. So suggestions are welcome. It should probably be Encarnacion or the mixture of boths

some timmings for harder problems:


```
sage: N = NumberField(ZZ[x].random_element(15).monic(),'a')    
sage: K = N[x]
sage: f = K.random_element(100)
sage: g1 = K.random_element(100)
sage: g2 = K.random_element(100)
sage: g1 *= f
sage: g2 *= f
sage: %time _=gcd(g1,g2)
CPU times: user 7.32 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 7.34 s
Wall time: 7.42 s
```

This example with the old implementation or even pari is unfeasible.

Now that #4000 has possitive review, I raise the priority of this one.

Updated patch to work in 4.5.3

Now, it works also for relative number fields, passing to an absolute representation and performing there the computations. This is not optimal but it is usable.

If the extension of the field is one, then the gcd of QQ[x] is used wich is faster.

There are some minor problems with the documentation (just punctuation) -- now I am studying the code, since this looks like very useful functionality!

<a id='comment:18'></a>Several comments:
1. Why the name `lift_pm()`?  In PARI, this function is called `centerlift()` which is more understandable in my opinion.  On the other hand, having the name *begin* with `lift` is more friendly for TAB-completion, so why not `lift_centered` or something?
2. A special class for polynomials over number fields looks like a good idea, but please put it in a separate file `polynomial_number_field.pyx` instead of adding to `polynomial_element_generic.pyx`.
3. I have a hard time understand the text below. What is `c`? What is `n`? Probably "reduction" is a better word than "project". And I also think the name `K` for a polynomial ring is badly chosen:

```
    def lift_to_poly_QQ(self,K):
        """
        Compute a lift of poly to K.
            
        INPUT:
    
        - K: an univariate polynomial ring over an absolute number field QQ[a].
        In order to make sense of this algorithm, the minimum polynomial of 'a'
        should project onto `c` modulo `m`.
      
        OUTPUT:
    
        -A polynomial in QQ[a] such that its projection coefficientwise is poly.
        This algorithm uses rational reconstruction, so it may fail.
```
4. Why `_gcd()` instead of `gcd()`?
5. Add some tests using the global `gcd()` function instead of always calling your `_gcd()` method.
6. Thanks to #11904, the line
 {{{
 h1 = pari([coeff._pari_('y') for coeff in self.list()]).Polrev() 
 }}}
 can be changed to
 {{{
 h1 = pari(self)
 }}}
7. This looks very fishy:
 {{{
 #Experimental bound IMPROVE
 }}}
8. With
 {{{
 p = p.next_prime(False)
 }}}
 do you mean
 {{{
 p = p.next_prime(proof=False)
 }}}
 which is much clearer?
9. I believe the keyword argument `algoritm=` is usually used instead of `method =` (note also the spacing!).

<a id='comment:21'></a>Back to business.

I have updated the patch with Jeroen's suggestions. Still I have to do something with 

```
#Experimental bound IMPROVE
p = ZZ(3+min(2**255, (max(map(abs,Bound.list())).n()**(0.4)).floor())).next_prime(proof=False)
```

p is the first prime to perform a modular gcd. If p=2, we will have to use a lot of primes and will be inefficient. On the other hand, if p is too big, we lose the advantages of modular gcd. So we have to give a sane, intermediate default.

The prime above is based on some experiments I made two years ago, the idea is to use a prime such that we will have to use few modular gcd, but limiting our stating prime to the interval `[3, 2^255]`.

Ideas welcomed.

I don't really have time to review any of this at the moment, but I agree with earlier reviewers that this looks like a very nice addition.  I was just wondering whether it would make sense to do this via a `NumberField._gcd_univariate_polynomial()` method as introduced by #13442.  On the one hand, this would mean you didn't have to introduce new classes (potentially many of them: we have absolute and relative number fields, quadratic fields, cyclotomic fields, sparse and dense polynomials, who knows what other distinctions we'll have in the future).  On the other hand, the code of this ticket has already been written and #13442 is still at `needs_work`, so it probably isn't worth the effort for now.

<a id='comment:53'></a>- I have added mor cdef, however, I cannot do that in polynomial_number_field since the class inherist from a python class. I was not able to cdef, rings or number field elements. The latter has at least two classes and I was not able to cdef the common parent.
- I have fixed types, more verbose method names, clean unusued variables.
- modular method can be further improved for high degree using half-gcd algorithms in ntl.

- Some more examples:

Pari seems to use either Euclid or some subresultant variation. I would expect pari to perform better when the gcd is big with respect to the degree of the inputs. Or, when the input has small degree.

The polynomials are generated with K.random_element() so small coefficients. This benefits pari.

Small extension, not impressing except for huge polynomials

I thought about an implementation in ntl, but I do not touch C++ since 15 years ago. Flint would also be a good place to put a similar code.\n\nAccording to the documentation:\n\ngcd uses:\n\n* integers: use modified right-shift binary (\"plus-minus\" variant).\n\n* univariate polynomials with coefficients in the same number field (in particular rational): use modular gcd algorithm.\n\n* general polynomials: use the subresultant algorithm if coefficient explosion is likely (non modular coefficients).\n\nSo, it may be the case that we are not translating polynomials to the correct pari setting and so I get bad timings?

<a id='comment:56'></a>I am not a pari developer, it would certainly benefit more people than an implementation in Sage. I thought about an implementation in ntl, but I do not touch C++ since 15 years ago. Flint would also be a good place to put a similar code.

According to the documentation:

gcd uses:

* integers: use modified right-shift binary ("plus-minus" variant).

* univariate polynomials with coefficients in the same number field (in particular rational): use modular gcd algorithm.

* general polynomials: use the subresultant algorithm if coefficient explosion is likely (non modular coefficients).

So, it may be the case that we are not translating polynomials to the correct pari setting and so I get bad timings? It may be the case, in order not to compute the discriminant of the number field we are dealing with...

I have tried to write polynomials in pure gp as

`f= Mod(3*y,y<sup>2-1)*x</sup>2+Mod(1,y<sup>2-1)*x+Mod(y,y</sup>2-1)`

or as 

```
w=quadgen(-4)
f= 3*w*x^2+1*x+w

in both cases I get bad timing. Reading the documentation now to see how to deal with polynomials with number field coefficients in pari...
