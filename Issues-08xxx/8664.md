Hi,

OK, after all this, the build finally completed.  The only changes I made were:

* Updated mpir to rc3
* patched ecm as explained here:
    http://lists.gforge.inria.fr/pipermail/ecm-discuss/2009-August/004070.html
   (Though this had to be slightly modified -- just search for the same command, which moved.)


I then ran the long Sage test suite, and some tests fail.  

  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/build/mpir2/sage-4.3.5/testlong.log

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


        sage -t  -long "devel/sage/doc/en/tutorial/tour_numtheory.rst"
        sage -t  -long "devel/sage/doc/fr/tutorial/tour_numtheory.rst"
        sage -t  -long "devel/sage/sage/modular/cusps.py"
        sage -t  -long "devel/sage/sage/modular/modsym/boundary.py"
        sage -t  -long "devel/sage/sage/modular/modsym/ambient.py"
        sage -t  -long "devel/sage/sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx"
        sage -t  -long "devel/sage/sage/rings/arith.py"
        sage -t  -long "devel/sage/sage/rings/integer.pyx"
        sage -t  -long "devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py"
        sage -t  -long "devel/sage/sage/tests/book_stein_ent.py"
        sage -t  -long "devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/heegner.py"
Total time for all tests: 7170.6 seconds

I looked and it appears that maybe all of these are the result of the XGCD behavior in MPIR changing again.  Has it changed to be like GMP now?  That would be convenient.

The XGCD issue needs some work w.r.t. doctests (but not only, see below), maybe David Harvey has something done already in this direction when preparing the optional "true" GMP spkg he maintains. (I don't find the thread right now, but I seem to remember he said something in this direction).

Snippet from a private communication by Bill Hart (MPIR upstream):

```
MPIR 2.0.1 will be required for Sage because it brings the gcdext
normalisation in line with GMP's (which is what Pari needs). I think
people have skipped MPIR 1.3.0 in favour of waiting for MPIR 2.0.1.
We're in the release phase of MPIR 2.0.1 ...
```
Also note that as soon as this ticket here is closed, we should mark #8455 as invalid.

Hmmm, `spkg-install` could be cleaned up further, e.g.
* Dave's comment has somehow been truncated(?) a while ago (*"... if"* what?)
* <code>s/\`uname\`/$UNAME/</code>
* Especially for parallel builds, it's more convenient to begin *every* error message with `"Error"` (or at least the message should contain that word).
* Simplify the "fat binary" section for Linux; it doesn't make sense to call `uname -m` three times, nor does it to compare its result again if it already matched one of the tested. A `case`-`esac` would be appropriate, also merging the identical `i386` and `i686` then-branches. Btw, `uname -m` can also be `i486` or `i586` on 32-bit Linuces.
* Is the `! [ $? -eq 0 ]` some required Cygwin "idiom"?

Also, `spkg-check` doesn't print any messages, and uses `make` instead of `$MAKE`.

The dependencies ("None") in `SPKG.txt` are wrong; MPIR at least depends on iconv, which Sage ships, though Sage's version is only used/built on some systems. I'm not sure if readline should be added to `spkg/standard/deps`. (MPIR's `configure` looks for much more, but apparently - as currently shipped - doesn't need/use all of that.) The Changelog could perhaps mention further changes, too.

If nobody else wants to, I could make the changes, i.e. a reviewer patch. Just let me know...

Going to test the new spkg with Sage 4.5.3.alpha2 and 4.6.prealpha3 (on Linuces only).

I guess unless we bump the patch levels of all packages that depend on GMP/MPIR (and ECM), this package breaks upgrading Sage (at least with the current upgrade process), due to interface change (in conjunction with shared library versioning).

The same applies to testing this package (and/with ECM 6.3 from #5847); one has to either build from scratch or delete `spkg/installed/<package-name>` for all packages that depend on those two.

Perhaps one could simply (conditionally) do the latter in `spkg/install`, which also gets updated during upgrade.

I think this could be fixed by making extension modules also depend on (some of) the libraries they use (in `module_list.py`), with the disadvantage that these modules would get rebuilt whenever their libraries "change", even if the interfaces stay the same (and even if just the modification time changed due to a rebuild/reinstallation).

Same for Fedora 13 x86 (parallel build with 6 jobs), also `ptestlong`.

Unfortunately, there seems to be some incompatibility between the new PARI (2.4.3.svn-12577.p4) or - more precisely - the required changes to Sage's interface to PARI in order to upgrade PARI (Sage 4.6.prealpha3, see #9343 and [the NewPARI Wiki page](http://wiki.sagemath.org/NewPARI)) and MPIR 2.1.1:

On Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64 (Core2, gcc 4.4.3) exactly two of all doctests (`ptestlong`) **segfault** (in `sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_point.py`).

On Fedora 13 x86 (Pentium 4 Prescott, gcc 4.4.4) the same two doctests and another one in `ell_rational_field.py` segfault, and in addition one doctest in the latter file raises an unexpected exception (`TypeError`), which seems to be the result of some other failure.

Maybe all are due to memory (or stack) corruption. See https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9343#comment:327 ff. for details; we haven't yet opened a separate ticket.

(For testing with Sage 4.6.prealpha3, I copied the MPIR 2.1.1 and ECM 6.3 spkgs to `spkg/standard`, and built Sage from scratch - without problems. I also reinstalled the PARI, MPIR and ECM packages later with `env SAGE_CHECK=yes ./sage -f ...`; all test suites passed.)

This is not necessarily the (only) cause. Jeroen has found a definite bug in MPIR 2.1.1 he'll report upstream; see #9837.

At least passes all (long) tests in `sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/` with Sage 4.6.prealpha3 on Fedora 13 x86 (Pentium 4 Prescott, gcc 4.4.4), where previously the segfaults occurred.

The diff shows they just fixed that single bug, bumped the MPIR version number (patch level) and incremented the revision numbers of both shared libraries.

Before the 4.6.alphaX build fails on the ia64 Skynet machines cleo and iras because of a bug in GCC 4.5.1 (see #9863), there's an apparent parallel `make install` failure with MPIR:

```

Sorry for the delay; I frequently see this since a while on Ubuntus (9.04 & 10.04) when building Sage with e.g. 16 or 32 jobs, with the **old** MPIR, too; also reported elsewhere (but incidentally also first saw this with MPIR 2.1.1 and the new PARI).

I cannot find obvious errors in the Makefile though; the relevant parts are identical to those of GMP btw, IIRC.

As another incident, I ran into this race condition again yesterday when building Sage 4.4.4 (!) from scratch with `MAKE="make -j16"`.

A trivial fix for the executable stack issue is to add the following to `spkg-install`:

```sh
case "$UNAME" in
    Linux) # implies a GNU linker
        LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -Wl,z,noexecstack"
        # already exported by sage-env

esac

**New spkg: http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/mpir-2.1.3.p0.spkg**

**md5sum:** `f65cbb309ee471d2a64f59e52e592494  mpir-2.1.3.p0.spkg`

New spkg with updated upstream, "reviewer" changes, fix for Fedora 14 (based on Mike's 2.1.1 spkg).

Setting this to needs review though we still need a patch to the Sage library to fix the extension module dependencies. Can be tested "stand-alone" (with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`), but should be installed together with the new ECM 6.3 spkg from #5847 (also needing review by a third person), since otherwise ECM doesn't build (i.e., the old version doesn't work with GMP 5.x or MPIR 2.x).

Steps to install:
* Download the new MPIR spkg and the [ecm-6.3.p0.spkg](http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/ecm-6.3.p0.spkg) from #5847.
* Copy both files into `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard` (such that 'make' will "see" them).
* Then do:

```sh
$ export SAGE_CHECK=yes                # optional, but recommended
$ export SAGE_UPGRADING=yes            # required to rebuild all dependent spkgs, too

$ export SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD=yes  # optional
$ export MAKE="make -jN"               # optional; N: number of 'make' jobs

$ time make build                      # just rebuild Sage (without the documentation)
$                                      # (logs go to install.log and spkg/logs/*)
$ ./sage -ba-force                     # rebuild the whole Sage library, necessary until
                                       # we fix the dependencies in module_list.py
$ time make ptestlong NUM_THREADS=N    # Use N threads instead of the default number
                                       # (also rebuilds the documentation as needed)
```
* Report back... ;-)

(I've so far tested both packages with Sage 4.6.1.alpha0 on Ubuntu 9.04 x86 and Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64.)

> Setting this to needs review though we still need a patch to the Sage library to fix the extension module dependencies. [...]

I've attached a patch that fixes the dependency issue with extension modules of the Sage library.


**Updated steps to test / install:**
* Download the [new MPIR spkg](http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/mpir-2.1.3.p0.spkg) and the [ecm-6.3.p0.spkg](http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/ecm-6.3.p0.spkg) from #5847.
* Copy both files into `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard` (such that `make` will "see" them).
* Download the [patch to the Sage library](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8664/trac_8664-fix_extmod_deps_for_MPIR_generically-sagelib.patch.gz). **Do not yet apply the patch.** (We first rebuild / reinstall dependent spkgs, of which the Sage library is one, so the patched version could get overwritten.)
* Then do:

```sh
$ export SAGE_CHECK=yes                # optional, but recommended
$ export SAGE_UPGRADING=yes            # required to rebuild all dependent spkgs, too

$ export SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD=yes  # optional
$ export MAKE="make -jN"               # optional; N: number of 'make' jobs

$ time make build                      # just rebuild Sage (without the documentation)
$                                      # (logs go to install.log and spkg/logs/*)
$ cd devel/sage
$ hg import /path/to/trac_8664-fix_extmod_deps_for_MPIR_generically-sagelib.patch
$ cd ../..
$ ./sage -b                            # rebuild the Sage library; only dependent modules

$ time make ptestlong NUM_THREADS=N    # Use N threads instead of the default number
                                       # (also rebuilds the documentation as needed)
```
* Report back... ;-)

I can only cite from the Sage library's `spkg-install`: ;-)

```python
...
    sage -sync-build

    # Pull in changes from the archive just downloaded. 
    hg pull "$CUR"
    hg merge tip
    hg ci -m "merge"
    # Make the pulled in changes take effect. 
    hg update 
...
```

`sage -sync-build` calls `local/bin/sage-sync-build.py`.

I have not encountered this problem (yet), I've built on `sage.math.washington.edu` without problems.

If you feel like it, you could put [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/release/sage-4.6.1.alpha0-mpir/sage-4.6.1.alpha0-mpir.tar](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/release/sage-4.6.1.alpha0-mpir/sage-4.6.1.alpha0-mpir.tar) on the buildbots and see what happens...

Thanks for testing this.

Would adding `-Wa,-force_cpusubtype_ALL` on MacOS PPCs work? (Unless `SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes`... Don't know what to do in that case, i.e. if `--enable-fat` works in that case, too.)

(I think PPC implies [32-bit] MacOS X 10.4 or 10.5 in Sage.)

Or do we have to make further distinctions on the CPU type?

For 32-bit **x86** builds on MacOS X < 10.6 we currently remove a lot of assembly files:

```sh
remove_pic_osx_32_bit()
{
    # Assumes we are in src/
    echo "Deleting assembly files which depend on PIC assembly" \
        "working or 32 bit OSX on Intel hardware..."
    rm mpn/x86/dive_1.asm 
    rm mpn/x86/diveby3.asm 
    rm mpn/x86/pentium4/sse2/dive_1.asm 
    rm mpn/x86/pentium4/sse2/mode1o.asm 
    rm mpn/x86/pentium4/sse2/diveby3.asm 
    rm mpn/x86/pentium4/mmx/popham.asm 
    rm mpn/x86/pentium4/mmx/rshift.asm
    rm mpn/x86/p6/mode1o.asm
    rm mpn/x86/p6/dive_1.asm
    rm mpn/x86/pentium/hamdist.asm
    rm mpn/x86/pentium/mod_1.asm
    rm mpn/x86/pentium/popcount.asm
    rm mpn/x86/pentium/mode1o.asm
    rm mpn/x86/pentium/dive_1.asm
}
```

We should report this upstream. Bill, can you forward this?

Even if this works for you, I'm not sure if MPIR only enables that code on CPUs that really support these instructions. Jeroen apparently has built this spkg on a MacOS X 10.4 PPC G5.

Nice, thanks.

Did you run MPIR's test suite (i.e., installed with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`)?

I'll update the ECM package (#5847) with the upstream patch, then you could also test this.

I don't know if you already broke your Sage installation by now having successfully installed the new MPIR, since we delete all older versions, which other parts of Sage will still try to use unless you also rebuild the dependent packages.

You can of course always force the reinstallation of the old MPIR (and ECM) package with `sage -f ...`, then Sage will again work as before.

P.S.: Does Apple's XCode `gcc` understand `-force_cpusubtype_ALL` (i.e., without `-Wa,`)?

I just noticed at least recent "originals" do on Darwin, but it's perhaps safer to directly pass it to the assembler.

Still need to now what happens on *Linux* PPC (with `gas`)...

so it's not 'ppc', it's 'Power Macintosh' on OSX 10.5, apparently...

I just re-run the installation of p0 with SAGE_CHECK=yes, and all the tests passed.
So I suppose it's very close, only that small config fix remains...

yes Apple's gcc 4.2.1 does. As well as gcc-4.0.1, which is probably more usual on OSX PPC...

What do `/bin/uname` and `/usr/local/bin/uname` give? 

(Consider installing GNU coreutils, and / or perhaps changing the `PATH`... ;-) )

There are other packages in Sage that won't recognize "Power Macintosh".


> The choice  "Power Macintosh" is undoubtedly the result of an out of court settlement between IBM and Apple :-)

Well, POWER<sup>TM</sup> is IBMs; the PowerPC was a later joint venture of Apple, IBM and Motorola.

p1 builds and passes all tests on OSX 10.5 PPC (G4), with gcc-4.2.1.
Except that somewhere in the log I see:

```
...
make[4]: Entering directory `/usr/local/src/sage/sage-4.6/spkg/build/mpir-2.1.3.p1/src/tests/cxx'
...
PASS: t-istream
Replacing decimal point didn't work, tests skipped
PASS: t-locale
...
 ```
This does not happen on Debian x64.
Probably a harmless (for Sage) C++-specific issue. Can this be ignored?

Did you rebuild all dependent packages, i.e. use `SAGE_UPGRADING=yes`?

What MPIR versions do you have in `local/lib/`?

I guess the locale issue is a minor thing (hopefully). Perhaps Bill knows better.

(I almost always build with `LC_ALL=C`.)

> Did you rebuild all dependent packages, i.e. use `SAGE_UPGRADING=yes`?

I tried

```
$ SAGE_UPGRADING=yes ../../sage -f mpir-2.1.3.p1.spkg
$ ../../sage -b
```
with the same outcome. 
Installing the version 1.* mpir spkg cures the installation, i.e. I get a working copy of Sage back.

So the patch to the Sage library apparently works for you. :)

The `libcsage` linker error occurs because some other library (NTL or PARI) still refers to the old MPIR library, i.e. hasn't been rebuilt.

Can you check the modification times of `spkg/installed/*` (e.g. `ls -rtl spkg/installed`)?
(Or just `ls -1rt local/lib/lib{gmp,ntl,pari}*`; all PARI and NTL libraries should be *below* MPIR's.)

Is ecm-6.2.1 compatible with  mpir 2.1.3?
Just wondering.

I'm going to rebuild Sage from scratch and with mpir 2.1.3.
It will take a night, but it's already pretty later over here.

You could try faking ecm-6.3.p0.spkg (or the old one if you haven't copied the new spkg) was already installed, then at least the build should pass.

I tried a vanilla build from the source, i.e. untarred the spkg, then

```
$ cd src/
$ ./configure
$ make
```
and it just works, picking up the flag -force_cpusubtype_ALL without any help.

rebuilt Sage 4.6 from scratch with p1 spk of this ticket, the Sage library patch of this ticket applied to sage spkg, and with tweaked ECM spkg (see the ECM ticket). All works, as well as passes testlong (>12 hours on this machine).

Dima

It all worked, as well as all

The one I made from the spkg on the ticket that 1) avoids the linker crash by supplying a longer assembler program in configure 2) runs ./configure --disable-asm-redc in spkg-install.

I did not yet try the configure patch suggested by Paul:

```
in fact this bug is already fixed upstream (in revision 1516), see

This has now been fixed in MPIR 2.1.4 (released today), but I'm not going to make any further changes *on this ticket*.

(I'll open a follow-up ticket anyway, since I already have an MPIR 2.1.3.p2 spkg with other improvements; MPIR 2.2 is on the way, too.)

A problem with `SAGE_UPGRADING` (whose "external" use is inofficial anyway) is that if the Sage library gets reinstalled because some of its dependencies got rebuilt (which is the typical case), Sage unconditionally switches back to the `main` branch without any warning, so previously applied patches to a clone take no longer effect (though they are still there, but no longer in the afterwards current branch, `sage-main`). It took me some time to realize that (or in fact track down weird errors caused by this)... ;-)

The Sage library's `spkg-install` should at least issue a warning when it switches the current branch; perhaps there should be some option to avoid this, since it is IMHO convenient to do e.g. `env SAGE_UPGRADING=yes make ptestlong` rather than patching the `main` branch or first building a new source distribution to build from scratch (or a new patched Sage library spkg to be installed).

8S See [my comment above](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/8664#comment:90).

I still can't believe this ticket didn't get merged *month* ago, just because (apparently) nobody felt able to give the ECM one (#5847) a final positive review.

The `CFLAGS` (or `-march=`) issue is IMHO completely unrelated -- if not irrelevant. ;-)

It's easy to extract and merge the *relevant* parts of MPIR's `CFLAGS` without ignoring a user's settings, which I did in the follow-up spkg (IIRC), mentioned above.

I'll try to take a look at its state during the next days; I'm currently not even sure if I hadn't already uploaded it onto google code...

Cheers.

Give me a *realistic* showcase where that matters... (i.e., causes a significant decrease in performance) ;-)

First of all, the important parts of MPIR are (more or less) hand-optimized assembly code, selected by MPIR's `configure` (or its parameters*) to best match the detected architecture (where MPIR's `config.guess` doesn't always necessarily choose the current nearest one btw.).

A properly configured GCC is usually sufficient, i.e. should default to something like `-march=native` (or a small subset of processors the actual CPU fits into), at least for people to whom performance is really crucial.

With my *current* spkg here, the user can always (intentionally or not) use the "global" `CFLAGS`, i.e. specify whatever is most appropriate to him or her.

The spkg had been extensively tested -- as is, month ago. As always: New changes, new pitfalls. [And even more delay due to a new test / review cycle. That's why I did not make any further changes *on this ticket*. Speaking of the devil, can someone **please** give #5847 a positive review?]

* If I haven't already, one (or me) should implement `MPIR_EXTRA_OPTS` or whatever it was called (but I think I already did).

P.S.: Ah, I see. It's already in the p1 here.

Ok, I've asked Mercurial about my p2 (which was intended to be a follow-up):

```
+=== mpir-2.1.3.p2 (Leif Leonhardy, November 24th, 2010) ===
+ * #8664: Upgrade Sage's MPIR spkg to version 2.1.3
+ * Further improvements:
+   - Let MPIR select CPU-specific code generation parameters (for CFLAGS) even
+     if we (also) pass our own (or user-specified) CC and CFLAGS; these might
+     be used by MPFR and GMP-ECM later, too, since MPIR's settings are recorded
+     in 'gmp.h' / 'mpir.h'.
+     Don't override user-settings (and respect SAGE_FAT_BINARY, SAGE_DEBUG
+     etc.) though. Add '-march-native' if appropriate and supported.
+  * Recognize also lower-case 'power*' arch (from 'uname -m').
+  * Major restructuring / reformatting; more comments and messages added.
```

I'm not sure right now if it's ready for release, at least it is functional as far as I remember; haven't yet committed all changes though.

Still believe we could [and maybe should] merge the p1 as is; upstream has to be updated anyway (once again, sooner or later, but IMHO definitely on a follow-up ticket).

Well, we could have merged this last year...

Further upstream upgrades should IMHO be made on follow-ups, but shouldn't be a problem once this is in.

Hopefully I can make a FLINT 1.5.2 spkg (cf. #9858) this week, rebasing the one I already have on the latest changes to our 1.5.0, and check / finish the p2 mentioned above which fixes the "`CFLAGS` issue" (though I still consider that kind of ridiculous, at least not a reason to delay an overdue major upgrade for month).

The also required new GMP-ECM package at #5847 was reverted from positive review to "needs work" just because a more or less optional patch to the Sage library would have to be rebased on another that had not even been merged into the at that time current devel release. I did so, but it now again technically needs review.

I have a new p3, but now I'm having the "usual" trouble with PPL (in Sage 4.7.1.rc0).

I.e., installing MPIR works, but after the installation GCC is broken inside Sage, because it tries to use Sage's PPL which still refers to the old `libgmpxx.so.3` which got deleted upon installation. (Others are having trouble with unresolved symbols not provided by Sage's PPL.)

It was IMHO a very bad idea to include PPL into Sage using the same name for the shared library, apparently without taking any care of these issues. (GMP / MPIR, MPFR and the -- currently optional IIRC -- MPC, all used by more recent versions of GCC, are in principle likely dangerous.)

Fortunately<sup>TM</sup> I can just change my `CC` setting to cure the installation, not deleting or copying any libraries or creating symbolic links...

(Apropos, I by incident saw that GAP's `spkg-install` is **unsetting `CC`** because not doing so is said to "break the install". That's very very odd as well.)

I'll update the MPIR spkg again to not delete its old shared libraries as a quick fix.

New spkg is up:

 http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/mpir-2.1.3.p4.spkg

 md5sum: `f84278504f4e1b696030c41cac6e4719  mpir-2.1.3.p4.spkg`

From a user's view, fixes the "`CFLAGS` issue", adds support for MacOS X 10.7 and some messages.

Installation instructions remain the same; I'll perhaps put them into the description later.

### mpir-2.1.3.p4 (Leif Leonhardy, July 19th, 2011)
* #8664: Upgrade Sage's MPIR spkg to version 2.1.3
* Do not delete old GMP/MPIR shared libraries as Sage's versions of libraries
  used by GCC might still refer to them, such that their deletion would break
  GCC inside Sage. (PPL e.g. refers to libgmpxx; MPFR and MPC are equally
  dangerous, since they're [also] used by recent versions of GCC.)
* Some more messages (e.g on rebuilding the Sage library and other packages
  after installation) and comments added.
* "Patches" section added.
* Also refreshed the patched gmp-h.in for SunOS. ;-)

### mpir-2.1.3.p3 (Leif Leonhardy, July 18th, 2011)
* #8664: Upgrade Sage's MPIR spkg to version 2.1.3
* Support MacOS 10.7 (Darwin 11) and later.
* Add warning if SAGE_DEBUG=yes since we then disable optimization.

### mpir-2.1.3.p2 (Leif Leonhardy, November 24th, 2010)
* #8664: Upgrade Sage's MPIR spkg to version 2.1.3
* Further improvements:
  - Let MPIR select CPU-specific code generation parameters (for CFLAGS) even
    if we (also) pass our own (or user-specified) CC and CFLAGS; these might
    be used by MPFR and GMP-ECM later, too, since MPIR's settings are recorded
    in 'gmp.h' / 'mpir.h'.
    Don't override user-settings (and respect SAGE_FAT_BINARY, SAGE_DEBUG
    etc.) though. Add '-march-native' if appropriate and supported.
  * Recognize also lower-case 'power*' arch (from 'uname -m').
  * Major restructuring / reformatting; more comments and messages added.

(Changes I made relative to the p1 which already had positive review, but got unmerged later.)

---

Further upstream upgrade to MPIR 2.4.0 (or 2.3.1 if more upstream issues should arise) will come soon *on another ticket*. We IMHO first should get this well-tested upstream release in.

Ok, to ease testing, I've uploaded a [Sage 4.7.1.rc0 library spkg](http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/sage-4.7.1.rc0-8664-5847.spkg) with both patches (from here and #5847) already applied.

You can either build Sage 4.7.1.rc0 from scratch with these three spkgs, or take a Sage 4.7.1.rc0 installation and just install them, automatically rebuilding (only) the dependent spkgs.

1. Copy [the MPIR spkg](http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/mpir-2.1.3.p4.spkg) and [the GMP-ECM spkg](http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/ecm-6.3.p2.spkg) into `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/`.
2. **Replace** the `sage-4.7.1.rc0.spkg` with [this one](http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/sage-4.7.1.rc0-8664-5847.spkg) (i.e., copy it to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard` and **delete** the original since `newest_version` would otherwise take the wrong one).
3. Build:
   * For a build from scratch, simply type `make`.
   * For rebuilding an existing installation with the new spkgs, type

```sh
env SAGE_UPGRADING=yes make
```

Note that you currently must not set `SAGE_CHECK` to `yes` in the above procedures, since the test suite of our current FLINT won't build with the new MPIR.

To run MPIR's and GMP-ECM's test suites, I'd suggest to simply reinstall them afterwards with `env SAGE_CHECK=yes ./sage -f mpir-2.1.3.p4 ecm-6.3.p2`. Likewise, you can also play with different `CFLAGS` settings (empty, some non-processor-specific flags, with some `-march=...` or `-mtune=...` etc. included).

Then preferably run `make testlong` or `make ptestlong`, though both upstream releases have IMHO already been quite excessively tested.

Well, can't you re-review #5847, which you set back to "needs work"?

The only single thing that has changed there is that the one-line patch to `module_list.py` got rebased to Sage 4.7.1.alpha4, in particular it is the same patch, differing just in line numbers (or, more precisely, a single after-context line):

I've never seen this before. The machine is running debian, but the sage build was done from within a gentoo prefix. So the build is basically one using gentoo. There doesn't seem to be a problem on amd64. I still have the build log.

See [sage-release](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/msg/c560179ee11e8692) and [this mpir-devel thread](http://groups.google.com/group/mpir-devel/browse_thread/thread/46ccdc5dfc3485cd#).

I'm sorry I didn't catch this earlier, but it's a waste of resources to run 32-bit operating systems (or software in general) on 64-bit processors... ;-)

I'll provide follow-up spkgs (also at #11616) that will fix this without the need to set `ABI`, but perhaps not that very soon.

By the way, MPIR 2.5.0 should get released in the next days as well, so I'll presumably also make an spkg based on that.

Another cyclic dependency... ;-) (#11698 depends on this ticket)

---

A new FLINT spkg (still 1.5.0, a p10) fixing the FLINT test suite build error (occurring in combination with any recent GMP / MPIR version like the one here) by just applying an upstream patch from FLINT 1.5.2 is ready for review at #9858.

(FLINT 1.5.2 and 1.6 spkgs will now most probably be on follow-up tickets to #9858.)
