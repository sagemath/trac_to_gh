A general tool to define:
* PositiveInteger
* NonNegativeInteger
* More.....

The idea is :
Range(begin, end, step) returns a proper finite/infinite set with categories of the defined set as you think...

(12:37:41) hivert: For example but not only: Range(5, 2**1321312, 3)...

(12:38:09) hivert: Range(0, Infinity, 1) <=> NonNegativeIntegers

(12:38:18) hivert: Range(1, Infinity, 1) <=> PositiveIntegers

+1!

That will be useful for NCSF too (see the beginning of sage/combinat/ncsf/categories.py).

Just mind the 's': PositiveIntegers

Let me guess: TransitiveGroup(0,1) does not work, right? Maybe it should actually?

So guys,

I add a patch with a first implementation...

Questions:
- First, if you find a language mistake, please tell me.
- What should I keep, what should I drop in NonNegativeIntegers ?
- Does IntegerRange need an `_element_constructor_` method ?
- What should I had in PositiveIntegers (easy thing please) ?
- Do you want to tell me about your day ?
- Any comment ....

Thanks for further advises.

Ok, after think a while...

I will update this code and give IntegerRange the behavior of range() if and only if someone (else than me) can give me an empty set with categories which can pass the tests....

```
sage: TestSuite(Set([])).run()
The following tests failed: _test_an_element, _test_category, _test_elements, _test_some_elements
```
I need this feature for coherence!! Python range easily give out an empty list like:

```
sage: range(1,20,-1)
[]
sage: range(20,1,1)
[]
```
Adding - and + Infinity, we will have a lot of arguments which will build an emptyset. Currently, I did not find a good empty set with categories.

My code does not allow negative ``step`` and check that ``begin`` < ``end`` to avoid the empty case.

On other hand, my current status is:
Benchmarks for my PhD Thesis --> add number_of_transitive_group --> Add enumerated set of TransitiveGroups() --> Add PositiveInteger --> Add IntegerRange feature --> MAX DEPTH OF RECURSION...

As this EmptySet (with categories) is an empty thing, I have an idea of who can implemented that ?

Replying to [@sagetrac-nborie](#comment%3A10):
> I will update this code and give IntegerRange the behavior of range() if and only if someone (else than me) can give me an empty set with categories which can pass the tests....
> 
> ```
> sage: TestSuite(Set([])).run()
> The following tests failed: _test_an_element, _test_category, _test_elements, _test_some_elements
> ```

For consintency of the category you should use an `EnumeratedSet` rather than a `Set`:

```
sage: f = FiniteEnumeratedSet([])
sage: TestSuite(f).run()
[...]
The following tests failed: _test_an_element, _test_elements, _test_some_elements
```
You can't expect to get anything better than that with the current specification of sets: All those three tests are buggy in the sense that they suppose that there is at least one element in the set. So forget about it and don't run TestSuite on an empty set until we fix this.
