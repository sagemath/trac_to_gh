## Details of the computer
* Sun Blade 1000
* 2 x 900 MHz UltraSPARC III+ CPUs
* 2 GB RAM
* Solaris 10 03/2005 (first release of Solaris 10)
* gcc 4.4.3 (uses Sun linker and assembler)

 == Sage version 4.3.3 (with several patches) ==
I'm using a patched version of Sage 4.3.3, built as a 32-bit binary. The patches include:

* #7867 Python patch, to allow Sage library to build. 
* #8191 Addition of iconv, which is needed for R
* #8285 Update R's spkg-install to work on Solaris
* #8363 Remove a useless check for mpir in cddlib 
* #8375 Numerical noise in devel/sage/sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx
* #8374 Numerical noise in devel/sage/sage/symbolic/constants_c.pyx
* #8371 Patch to allow pyprocessing to build - it failed after python was patched as #7867. (Note #6503 aims to remove pyprocessing completely). 

 == The problem ==
There are 8 test failures on this rather old SPARC. Increasing SAGE_TIMEOUT allowed 3 to pass. The longest is "devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/symmetric_ideal.py" which takes 459.4 s. 

However, 5 failures remain outstanding.
