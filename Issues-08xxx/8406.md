```
two examples:

```
sage: G=Graph()
sage: R.<a>=GF(3^3)
sage: G.add_vertex(a^2)
sage: G.vertices()
[9]
```
This should be `[a]`, but `int(a)=9`

```
sage: R.<x>=GF(3^3,'a')[]
sage: G.add_vertex(x)
ValueError
```
This should work as `x` is hashable.

`int(x)` return a `ValueError`, but the code only tests for `TypeError`.

line 638 of c_graph.pyx, we find:

```
try:
    u_int = u
except TypeError:
    return -1
```

I think we should instead do an explicit test:

```
if isinstance(u,(int,long,Integer))
```
to avoid coercions.

Thoughts?

Every patch fixing a bug should include a doctest illustrating that bug. Can you make doctests for the two bugs you noted at the top of the page?
