 == The computer hardware & software ==
* Sun Blade 1000
* 2 x 900 MHz UltraSPARC III+ CPUs
* 2 GB RAM 
* Solaris 10 03/2005 - the first release of Solaris 10. 

 == The Sage software ==
Sage 4.3.3 which comes with python-2.6.4.p5 and pyprocessing-0.52.p0
 
 == The problem ==
This is a long story, so I'll keep it short. 
* #6583 "Implement 2-isogeny descent over QQ natively in Sage using ratpoints" was integrated into Sage 4.3.1.
* The above patch, which was not properly checked on Solaris, broke the Solaris build as reported at #7867
* Jaap Spies found this link http://bugs.python.org/issue1759169  which suggests this is a bug in python, which will be fixed in the next 2.6 release. But a patch is provided on the python web site.
