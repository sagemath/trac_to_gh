This new spkg for Cbc includes several new lines in spkg-install to activate CPLEX support in the Coin Library.

It is to be found at : ~ncohen/cbc-2.3.p2.spkg

This functionality can be used with the corresponding patch #8172

Sorry, there is some confusion here.

Replying to [@sagetrac-drkirkby](#comment:3):

The package is intended for optional, because that's where CBC is right now.

> Also, since this is new, you should remove the .p2 from the spkg name and instead 
> call it cbc-2.3.spkg.

As hinted above the SPKG is indeed not new but an update. The CPLEX support in the ticket #8172 is new but *this* ticket only updates the CBC SPKG to work with the new interface. A true update. There is and never will be a CPLEX SPKG because CPLEX is proprietary.

Hope that clarifies the situation somewhat.
