This new spkg for Cbc includes several new lines in spkg-install to activate CPLEX support in the Coin Library.

It is to be found at : ~ncohen/cbc-2.3.p2.spkg

This functionality can be used with the corresponding patch #8172

Sorry, there is some confusion here.

> Since this is new, you need to state whether it is intended to go into experimental or optional. 

The package is intended for optional, because that's where CBC is right now.

> Also, since this is new, you should remove the .p2 from the spkg name and instead 
> call it cbc-2.3.spkg.

As hinted above the SPKG is indeed not new but an update. The CPLEX support in the ticket #8172 is new but *this* ticket only updates the CBC SPKG to work with the new interface. A true update. There is and never will be a CPLEX SPKG because CPLEX is proprietary.

Hope that clarifies the situation somewhat.
