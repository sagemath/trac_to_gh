All test passed in `sage/plot/misc.py`. I tested it on a keyword I changed recently and everything works as expected. I tested the sphinx docbuild and no new warning are created... but that is because the doc of the affected file is not generated. To me this is a positive review.

I added a patch where I make use of the `rename_keyword` with deprecation warning and where I fixed some small sphinx syntax. If Jason aggrees with my patch, I allow him to change the status of this ticket to positive review.

Positive review on the documentation changes.  I'm not qualified to comment on the deprecation you did in the word code, though, so I'll let someone else review that deprecation.

One last idea (for another ticket) since I am thinking about it. Maybe this `rename_keyword` decorator could move up in `sage/misc` because I think it will be used by more than the plot code.

+1.  In fact, the other decorators in that file probably ought to be moved up to sage/misc as well.
