All test passed in `sage/plot/misc.py`. I tested it on a keyword I changed recently and everything works as expected. I tested the sphinx docbuild and no new warning are created... but that is because the doc of the affected file is not generated. To me this is a positive review.

I added a patch where I make use of the `rename_keyword` with deprecation warning and where I fixed some small sphinx syntax. If Jason aggrees with my patch, I allow him to change the status of this ticket to positive review.

One last idea (for another ticket) since I am thinking about it. Maybe this `rename_keyword` decorator could move up in `sage/misc` because I think it will be used by more than the plot code.

+1.  In fact, the other decorators in that file probably ought to be moved up to sage/misc as well.
