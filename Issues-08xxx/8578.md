For a finite field of, say 2^6 elements, an object representing an
element of such a field has a method called int_repr() that returns
the object's integer representation. However, if we are dealing with,
say GF(7^100), an object representing an element of such a field
doesn't have a corresponding int_repr() method. The report below
includes such a method, which is meant to work for a finite field of
any order.
