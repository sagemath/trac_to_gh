I tried to make each of these mostly self contained, with doctests passing after every ticket, but I didn't entirely succeed.  If you're reviewing one of these tickets, applying later tickets will hopefully fix doctest failures that you're seeing.

I'm sorry that this has been so difficult to review.  I've tended to work in chunks: I just start ripping things apart and changing lots of stuff, and then I need to fix it all; by the time I've managed to make all the doctests pass it's turned into a patch-bomb.  I've tried to split things into logically consistent chunks, but it's really frustrating trying to backport fixes.  I also really shouldn't be working on Sage right now: I should be working on my thesis, which has nothing to do with this.

I've tried to get these tickets working against 4.6.alpha1 (in particular, I think they should now).  If they don't get reviewed, I'll try your approach.  In the mean time, the sequence of patches should be 

```

David, I'm not very satisfied with the change in `french_book/numbertheory.py` done by this patch, for two reasons:

(1) the previous error message was better. (In the book we wanted to show that the isomorphism
    between two instances of GF(3<sup>2</sup>) is not automatic in Sage.)

(2) this is more serious. We have put this doctest in Sage so that the examples of our book (which
    is now published) still work with future versions of Sage. By changing the error message you
    did break the examples on http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/. Moreover you did not even contact
    us to discuss this change.

For (1) is it possible to revert to the previous error message?

For (2) in case you want to change some file in the tests directory, please first inform the
corresponding author.

David (Loeffler), I didn't write to you, but to David Roe... You are just the reviewer.
This policy is explained in http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/msg/3ea7ed2eeab0824a :

```

Note that you could also submit a patch to Sage with the code you're doctesting.
I did that with all the tests from both of the books I published, and
I encourage you and many others to do the same with the code from your
article.  The code would go in a file

    devel/sage/sage/tests/

like the file devel/sage/sage/tests/book_stein_modform.py

In fact, I could imagine having dozens of files in that directory, and
when doctests break there, we could notify the authors before
releasing the version of Sage that breaks their doctests for feedback
-- then they could update their papers or Sage.
```

My personal opinion is that "we could notify" should read "we should notify"...

Paul
