Part of a series:

```

I tried to make each of these mostly self contained, with doctests passing after every ticket, but I didn't entirely succeed.  If you're reviewing one of these tickets, applying later tickets will hopefully fix doctest failures that you're seeing.

David, I'm not very satisfied with the change in `french_book/numbertheory.py` done by this patch, for two reasons:

(1) the previous error message was better. (In the book we wanted to show that the isomorphism
    between two instances of GF(3<sup>2</sup>) is not automatic in Sage.)

(2) this is more serious. We have put this doctest in Sage so that the examples of our book (which
    is now published) still work with future versions of Sage. By changing the error message you
    did break the examples on http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/. Moreover you did not even contact
    us to discuss this change.

For (1) is it possible to revert to the previous error message?

For (2) in case you want to change some file in the tests directory, please first inform the
corresponding author.

Paul Zimmermann

David (Loeffler), I didn't write to you, but to David Roe... You are just the reviewer.
This policy is explained in http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/msg/3ea7ed2eeab0824a :

```

Note that you could also submit a patch to Sage with the code you're doctesting.
I did that with all the tests from both of the books I published, and
I encourage you and many others to do the same with the code from your
article.  The code would go in a file

    devel/sage/sage/tests/

like the file devel/sage/sage/tests/book_stein_modform.py

In fact, I could imagine having dozens of files in that directory, and
when doctests break there, we could notify the authors before
releasing the version of Sage that breaks their doctests for feedback
-- then they could update their papers or Sage.
```

My personal opinion is that "we could notify" should read "we should notify"...

Paul
