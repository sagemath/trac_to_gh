Moves residue fields to the coercion model, makes the reduction and lifting maps morphisms, prepares the way for #7885 (Tate's algorithm for function fields).

Depends on #7883, #9898, #9753, #9764. Prerequisite for #8335.

I tried to make each of these mostly self contained, with doctests passing after every ticket, but I didn't entirely succeed.  If you're reviewing one of these tickets, applying later tickets will hopefully fix doctest failures that you're seeing.

I think the problem is caused by #9343/#9400 which both make extensive changes to residue fields.\n\nJust a general observation: you've managed to virtually guarantee that these patches are impossible to review, because they're all linked together in such a way that they fail doctests unless you apply the whole series. So the effect is a huge patch bomb, which is unappealing to review; hence it sits around for ages, and inevitably bitrots. Please, please, please back-port the doctest fixes etc, so each ticket in the series passes doctests on its own. Otherwise this will really never get merged and all of your hard work writing this excellent code (not to mention the work of those who have attempted to review it) will be for nothing.",

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
It doesn't work. On vanilla 4.6.alpha1, if I apply 

```
7883_ideals.patch
7883_fixes.patch
8333_parent_init.patch
8333_finite_fields_to_new_coercion.2.patch
7585_9_1_frac_and_coerce_updates.patch
8334_residue_fields-rebased_for_8446.patch
```
then the first five apply (with minor fuzz) but the last one is completely knackered, with 23 out of 27 hunks failing. I think the problem is caused by #9343/#9400 which both make extensive changes to residue fields.

Just a general observation: you've managed to virtually guarantee that these patches are impossible to review, because they're all linked together in such a way that they fail doctests unless you apply the whole series. So the effect is a huge patch bomb, which is unappealing to review; hence it sits around for ages, and inevitably bitrots. Please, please, please back-port the doctest fixes etc, so each ticket in the series passes doctests on its own. Otherwise this will really never get merged and all of your hard work writing this excellent code (not to mention the work of those who have attempted to review it) will be for nothing.

Right, so I have rebased roed's last patch and uploaded my rebased patch as `8333_8334_ALL-rebased_for_9764.patch`. This patch will apply cleanly to 4.6.alpha1 on top of the folded patch from #7883 and the series #9898/#9753/#9764.

This patch incorporates everything from #8333 as well, so this is the only patch that needs to be applied to close both #8333 and this ticket.

Incidentally, are you running a 32-bit or a 64-bit machine? I don't have access to any 32-bit boxes. If you have access to a 32-bit machine, it would be great if you could do the following:

- Install #9898/#9753/#9764 and test everything in sage/rings.
- Then install #7883 and the combined patch from this ticket, and do sage/rings again.
- Then install #9359 and repeat.

I'm a little nervous about silly doctest failures coming up from Pari's unpredictable choices of generators of ideals, and this would set my mind at rest a bit :-)

David, I'm not very satisfied with the change in `french_book/numbertheory.py` done by this patch, for two reasons:

(1) the previous error message was better. (In the book we wanted to show that the isomorphism
    between two instances of GF(3<sup>2</sup>) is not automatic in Sage.)

(2) this is more serious. We have put this doctest in Sage so that the examples of our book (which
    is now published) still work with future versions of Sage. By changing the error message you
    did break the examples on http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/. Moreover you did not even contact
    us to discuss this change.

For (1) is it possible to revert to the previous error message?

For (2) in case you want to change some file in the tests directory, please first inform the
corresponding author.

Paul Zimmermann

This policy is explained in http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/msg/3ea7ed2eeab0824a :

Note that you could also submit a patch to Sage with the code you're doctesting.
I did that with all the tests from both of the books I published, and
I encourage you and many others to do the same with the code from your
article.  The code would go in a file

    devel/sage/sage/tests/

like the file devel/sage/sage/tests/book_stein_modform.py

In fact, I could imagine having dozens of files in that directory, and
when doctests break there, we could notify the authors before
releasing the version of Sage that breaks their doctests for feedback
-- then they could update their papers or Sage.
```

My personal opinion is that "we could notify" should read "we should notify"...
