Perhaps this is a bit silly, but the banner at the top of the trac pages says "Sage developer trac", but links to sagemath.org. When I see a link that says "Sage developer trac", I expect the link to go to, well, the trac site. On many occasions I've clicked that banner, wanting to go to the main trac page, and had to backtrack from the main Sage page.

Can someone with trac admin access change the link to trac.sagemath.org?
