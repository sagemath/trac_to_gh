Thanks, Minh - those are some good additions, and I've learned a couple more fine-points.  And, as always, thanks for cleaning up my grammar. ;-)

The reviewer patch looks good to me, thankfully I had a guide to show me how to apply it.  I think I'm allowed to give such a thing a review, and if so, it's a positive review.

So it sounds like this is ready to go, and I'll mark it "positive review" - change it back if I missed something procedurally.

That was a nice collaboration - thanks for prodding me into action.

Rob
