a sage (4.3.3) notebook shows the correct picture of

```
plot(x^2-5,(x,0,5),ymin=0)

```

See line 1732 of your patch for #7981 ;-)  - `kwds.setdefault('filename', sage.misc.misc.tmp_filename() + '.png') `
> Also, what exactly should the test do? How do I verify that images from `show` and `save` are the same? It seems like a waste of time on tests if it is only checked that these commands don't raise an exception - they were working before as well, just not as they should.

Sadly, we can't do that yet.  (Matplotlib apparently does do this with Nose, but we don't have the capability yet.)   Partly this could be useful for the future day when we CAN check things like this...

But for now the point is that at least someone can visually verify that there is a different min than $y=-5$ if they care to look.  We want to document that we have done something about the particular one.
