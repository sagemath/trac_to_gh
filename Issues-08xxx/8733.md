<a id='comment:4'></a>Well.. What can I say besides "good work" ? :-)

Definitely cleaner, still passes all tests, the documentation is clearly improved, and I was responsible for some of the mistakes you corrected (the dictionaries, for examples) :-)

Positive review, and thank you very muuuuuuuuch !
