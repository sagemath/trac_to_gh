the documentation of `simplify_radical` says:

```
sage: x.simplify_radical?
...
       Simplifies this symbolic expression, which can contain logs,
       exponentials, and radicals, by converting it into a form which is
       canonical over a large class of expressions and a given ordering of
       variables
```
however if indeed it is able to recognize zero:

```
sage: a=1/(sqrt(5)+sqrt(2))-(sqrt(5)-sqrt(2))/3
sage: a.simplify_radical()
0
```
it does *not* return a canonical expression:

```
sage: a1=1/(sqrt(5)+sqrt(2))
sage: a2=(sqrt(5)-sqrt(2))/3
sage: a1.simplify_radical()
1/(sqrt(2) + sqrt(5))
sage: a2.simplify_radical()
-1/3*sqrt(2) + 1/3*sqrt(5)
sage: (a1-a2).simplify_radical()
0
```

yes (unless of course upstream finds a way to get a real canonical form).

For me, a "canonical expression" means that two mathematically identical expressions simplify to
the *exactly same* expression. Thus it is clearly not canonical. Feel free to ask on the Maxima
list, but this should not delay this ticket.

I agree but somebody needs to review my reformatting of the documentation.

I am not well versed in ReST, but AFAICT, Jeroen's changes make sense.

Maxima documentation on `radcan()` (below) is rather vague. Based on this text, we shouldn't make bold claims about canonical results in the Sage documentation. I am switching this back to positive review.

```
Simplifies expr, which can contain logs, exponentials, and radicals, by
converting it into a form which is canonical over a large class of expressions
and a given ordering of variables; that is, all functionally equivalent forms
are mapped into a unique form. For a somewhat larger class of expressions,
radcan produces a regular form. Two equivalent expressions in this class do
not necessarily have the same appearance, but their difference can be
simplified by radcan to zero.

For some expressions radcan is quite time consuming. This is the cost of
exploring certain relationships among the components of the expression for
simplifications based on factoring and partial-fraction expansions of
exponents. 
```

We can open an enhancement ticket to clarify what 
* * a large class of expressions*
* *functionally equivalent*
* * regular form*
mean in the text above, and how the ordering of the variables effect the final result. Ideally, we should have references to a description of the underlying algorithm as well.
