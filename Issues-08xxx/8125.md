This seems to be a bug in matplotlib; I just reported it to the matplotlib-devel mailing list, and I'll report any answers I get.

Meanwhile, this arises in "real life" as follows:

```
sage: var("y R") 
sage: a(y,R) = pi * (2*R - y) * y 
sage: latex(a(y,R))
{\left(2 \, R - y\right)} \pi y
```
Therefore 

```
sage: lbl = text(r"$\int \  " + latex(a(y,R)) + "$",(3,20)) 
```
won't work with matplotlib.  Should we get rid of the "\," in the latex output?

No response at all.   From python:

```

<matplotlib.text.Text object at 0x1020aa450>

>>> pylab.text(0.2, 0.2, r"$(2a \, = b)$")
<matplotlib.text.Text object at 0x101e22a50>

<matplotlib.text.Text object at 0x1020b5750>
>>> pylab.savefig('c.png')
BOOM
```
Combining `\left(`, `\right)}]}, and {{{\,` seems to lead to problems.  So now what?  Do we get rid of the `\,`?
