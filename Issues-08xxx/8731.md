This update fixes #8729.  It also includes the fixes noted in #8645 (so this spkg supersedes the maxima spkg at #8645).

The spkg is up at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/maxima-5.21.1.spkg

A patch needs to be applied to fix some doctests.  In particular, apparently maxima has gotten better at integration.

There are no less than three different styles in the other dates in the changelog, so apparently it's okay to have inconsistent date styles, so I did the dates in a much more standard notation.  However, I'll change it to spell out April since the date is wrong anyway.

Oops, seems that solving inequalities is completely broken with this new version of Maxima.

Yes, though I wouldn't say completely broken, since not every doctest fails, correct?  

Other issues:

In symbolic/integration/integral.py, there is one integral which has been improved, and one which seems to affected by the rational approximation thing, but wasn't before.   There is also an integral (in that file, I think) which Maxima can now do, and we need to replace it with one Maxima can't do.  There is also a slight change in the numeric value because of this, but that wasn't the  point of that doctest.

The binomial issue seems easy to fix, but apparently now binomial(n,n)=1 for all n in Sage, but not in Maxima.  Should we change Sage, or do what Jason recommends (assume n>0 or something)?

And in interfaces/maxima.py there are a lot of erros where Maxima loads like

```
    ;;; Loading #P".../local/lib/ecl/cmp.fas"
    ;;; Loading #P".../local/lib/ecl/sysfun.lsp"
```
as well as of course the Maxima version being wrong and, oddly, the following:

```
sage: maxima.eval('sage0: x == x;')
Expected <Error>
Got:
    'x'
```
which is not good at all if real, but maybe just means Maxima changed something minor?

The plot3d one is not too significant, I think.  I haven't looked at the other ones.

Anyway, obviously 'needs work' until someone posts a fairly comprehensive patch.

The next doctest is testing that #780 is fixed.  Here, it appears that #780 is *not* fixed again.  However, the actual maxima bug that was fixed for #780 is still fixed.  The problem seems to be that we use keepfloat: true, and when we have keepfloat: true, the erroneous question pops up.

There is some output mismatch in transform.pyx.  This occurs in an explanatory section of the docs, and just consists of simplifying a horrendous matrix.  The matrix just simplifies differently now (we get explicit imaginary values now, for some reason).  Does anyone want to check that the simplifications are actually correct now?

There are a few errors in the interfaces/maxima.py file.  These seem to all stem from more output, rather than actual errors.

Thanks for the comprehensive report; I had my own private list of these from a few weeks ago, but had not had time to look into all of them yet.

I think with the last two things there must have been internal changes in Maxima which lead to different handling - in particular, that gcd must now load some modules?  I'm going to check what maxima_console() does with these things.

With the new ECL and the new Maxima, I no longer get the error messages about installing a .fas or .fasb file.  That is good.

Anyway, doctest should just be changed for the loading thing, regardless of where it does it.  All documentation requests do that, as does running maxima_console().  Unless... before, maxima_console() gave three loading statements, the last two of which are the ones which show up in your examples.  Now there are five, but the top two are new... are we stripping away three load statements in the output, but not more?  Just a wild idea.

As for the last error, here it is in the maxima_console() - something's not going right.

which sure looks the same to me, yet Sage catches it correctly before and not now!  What the heck?

Before, there was a lowercase "i", now it is upper-case in "Incorrect".  Maybe that's the problem.

This is true if the cosine integral ci(x) (Ci in Mma) is 1/2*(Ei(I*x)+Ei(-I*x).  Several online references imply it, and also noting that cos(x) is 1/2*(exp(i*x)+exp(-i*x)) (by Taylor series or whatever you like) suffices.

I believe this is all related to a change made in how sqrt behaves with respect to factors (sqrt(ab) and sqrt(a), sqrt(b)) and whether an I gets factored out or not. They all come down to the same essential things:

```
-(cos(theta) - 1)*sqrt(-x^2 - z^2 + 1)*x
-((cos(theta) - 1)*sqrt(-x^2 + 1)*sqrt(-x^2 - z^2 + 1)*x*sqrt(z^(-2)) 
```

```
- sqrt(z^2)*sin(theta)
- I*sqrt(x^2 - 1)*sin(theta))*sqrt(z^2)/sqrt(-x^2 + 1)
```
The latter seems ok immediately (or at least no worse than other decision made for us about which root of -1 to choose), but even given that $x<sup>2+y</sup>2+z^2=1$, which is asserted earlier in the file, I can't quite make out the former. I'll look into this a little more.

> This is true if the cosine integral ci(x) (Ci in Mma) is 1/2*(Ei(I*x)+Ei(-I*x).  Several online references imply it, and also noting that cos(x) is 1/2*(exp(i*x)+exp(-i*x)) (by Taylor series or whatever you like) suffices.

 
Burcin has also already pointed this out at #8624.

It's actually possible to turn messages like this off. If you're driving maxima via a pexpect interface, that might be the proper thing to do. The key is the "Common Lisp HyperSpec", the de facto official CL documentation. Looking at `load` leads to the global variable `*load-verbose*`:

Hi, I;ve tagged version-5_22_0 in CVS and built rpms
and tar.gz and upload them all to SF.
Should be available real soon now at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/maxima/files/
(looks like the list hasn't been refreshed yet, I don't
know what the refresh schedule is)

If someone can build & upload a Windows installer that
would be great.

As ever please give the new version a try and if/when
there aren't too many complaints I'll make a general announcement.

best

Robert Dodier
```
So maybe we should change this ticket to 5.22.0 if they don't get too many problems with it?

As sooner or later maxima would have to be updated to 5.22 or newer I decided to share my experiences of first approach to update to it. I wanted to try 5.22 because it's first version that supports inversion of error function, and first to support integrals of form abs(x) from 0 to a without assumptions. I based on patch by Jason for 5.21 and wanted to reach at least same level of failures as with 5.21. Unfortunately, I got stuck at one place - maxima hangs in some situations. I tracked that to this difference:

before it was

which makes Sage wait for "<sage-display>" forever.

I made spkg: http://lab15.im.pwr.wroc.pl/~giniew/maxima-5.22.1.spkg and patch - http://lab15.im.pwr.wroc.pl/~giniew/trac-8731-maxima-upgrade-to-5.22.1.patch - those are not working but I'm attaching them in case someone wants to pick up from here - as I said I gave up for now.

(btw, the doctest that was failing in devel/sage/sage/calculus/calculus.py is just different grouping, checked it and added new version to doctest, and there is one new doctest failure in devel/sage/sage/calculus/calculus.py that fails because maxima can integrate abs(x) in x from 0 to any a and returns correct 1/2*a*abs(a). There was also change to how logcontract works, they don't make full rational simplification now. I added one more step of rational simplification to simplify_full to simplify it more, though it might change some results.)
