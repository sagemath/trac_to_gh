I noticed the following with Sage 4.3.5:

```
sage: R = GF(9,name='x')
sage: Q.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(3))
sage: R2 = GF(9,name='x',modulus=x^2+1)
sage: a=R(x+1)
sage: R2(a)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/users/caramel/zimmerma/svn/sagebook/tex/<ipython console> in <module>()

/usr/local/sage-core2/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/rings/finite_field_givaro.so in sage.rings.finite_field_givaro.FiniteField_givaro.__call__ (sage/rings/finite_field_givaro.cpp:4754)()

TypeError: unable to coerce from a finite field other than the prime subfield
```
This is ok since indeed a=x+1 is not in the prime subfield.
But:

```
sage: b=R(1)
sage: R2(b)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/users/caramel/zimmerma/svn/sagebook/tex/<ipython console> in <module>()

TypeError: unable to coerce from a finite field other than the prime subfield
```
In this case b=1 ***is*** in the prime subfield!!!

Side question: is there a (simple) way to get the isomorphism between R and R2?

Since he is a lead developer of pari and says in the paper that he has implemented his algorithm in pari, can we not just use that implementation by wrapping it?

Of course, but that will not give us "lattices of compatible finite fields".

The way I see it, we should get the following tickets merged in that order:
* #8335 David Roe's for lattices using (pseudo) Conway polynomials, this only goes up and is obviously inefficient for large fields,
* #11938 which implements going down for finite field using Givaro, 
* maybe extend it to all fields using pseudo-Conway polynomials in a follow-up ticket,
* #13214 by Xavier Caruso, not sure how useful that will be, but that can give a nice code basis to start upon,
* this ticket to implement general lattices of compatible finite fields.

Since it has been mentioned in the tickets related to this one, here's some more literature (by Doliskani, Schost and myself):

- 2-adic towers http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.4350
- l-adic (small l) towers http://defeo.lu/towers/ (the github repo includes a Sage toy implementation)
- p-adic (Artin-Schreier) towers http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717111002008, with a C++ implementation https://github.com/defeo/FAAST

...still quite far from the complete picture.

We've been indenpendently working on computation of embeddings with Luca and others at:

Inspired by this, the code in PARI/GP should be much better than 4 years ago as well.
