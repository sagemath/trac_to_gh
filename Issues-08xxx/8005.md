Reported by Ronald van Luijk:

The following seems inconsistent:

```
sage: F = GF(5)
sage: R.<x,y>=F[]
sage: I=Ideal(R, [x, y])
sage: S.<x1,y1>=QuotientRing(R,I)
sage: print x1^2
x1^2
sage: print x1^3
x1^3
sage: print (x1^2)^2
x1^4
sage: print x1^4
NotImplementedError
```

The traceback is:

```

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

This is with Sage 5.7beta0 where everything seems to work as expected:

```
sage: F = GF(5)
sage: R.<x,y>=F[]
sage: I=Ideal(R, [x, y])
sage: S.<x1,y1>=QuotientRing(R,I)
sage: print x1^2
0
sage: print (x1^2)^2
0
sage: print x1^4
0
sage: print x1
0
sage: S
Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Finite Field of size 5 by the ideal (x, y)
```
I wouldn't know how to create a meaningful doctest for this problem, so I'm giving the 'wontfix' a positive review.

Huh. This has been on my TODO list for quite a while I guess! It looks like this was fixed as part of #9138.

I've added a doctest for it, and cleaned up a little.
