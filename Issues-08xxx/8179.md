The package cddlib-094f.p?.spkg places two new binaries under the directory $SAGE_LOCAL/bin, in particular:

```
[mvngu@mod bin]$ pwd
/scratch/mvngu/release/sage-4.3.2.alpha1/local/bin
[mvngu@mod bin]$ hg st
? cdd_both_reps
? cdd_both_reps_gmp
```
These are required by the rewritten polyhedra package at #7109. A patch to $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/.hgignore is attached. This ticket is a prerequisite for #8115.
