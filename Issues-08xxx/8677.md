My suspicion is, that the reason is some race condition in checking, whether during the build some directory has to be newly added, or already exists.

<a id='comment:1'></a>That is consistent with the fact that I have previously built Sage successfully: this was exactly the same version of Sage, on exactly the same hardware.Â  The only difference between the two situations was that before the unsuccessful build I did 'export MAKE="make -j6"' to make the build process use 6 jobs in parallel, whereas the successful build used only one build job.

<a id='comment:7'></a>A correctly working NFSv3 shouldn't need the `async` options to achieve fast writes, but maybe some older servers/clients are being used? With `async`, data will be corrupted if the server crashes, but thats probably acceptable on a build system.

I take issue with the patch, however. The current race seems to be 

```
    if not os.path.exists(path): 
        # another process can create path here
        os.makedirs(path) 
        # error!
```
The correct fix would be to replace the whole if clause with 

```
    try: 
        os.makedirs(path) 
    except OSError: 
        pass 
```
But the patch mixes up both. It still contains the original race and then hacks around it to trap the error.

Are you just making this up, or?!

> The correct fix would be to replace the whole if clause with ...


I strongly disagree.  I see no point in not including the

```
if not os.path.exists(dirname):
```
code, since that makes perfect sense when doing a serial build, which is what most people do.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Replying to [comment:8 was]:
> Are you just making this up, or?!


Thats what the aforementioned FAQ says:

```
For the Linux implementation of NFS Version 3, using the "async" export option to allow faster writes is no longer necessary. NFS Version 3 explicitly allows a server to reply before writing data to disk, under controlled circumstances.
```

> I strongly disagree.  I see no point in not including the
> if not os.path.exists(dirname):


The point is that the pattern "if (look at filesystem) then (modify filesystem)" is fundamentally flawed. Its the origin of countless security problems from temp races etc. The world is a better place without it :-) And the only way to make it die is to stomp it out wherever we encounter it...

What if we use William's solution for the first "hunk" and Volker's for the second?  Then we can avoid many unnecessary exceptions in the first.  In the second, we only call `os.makedirs` if copying the Cython-compiled file fails.

I've add a patch that does this.

In any case, I think mixing the two patterns is taking the worst of both worlds ;-) I'll attach my version of the patch in case I wasn't clear enough.

With a clean, built-from-scratch 4.6.alpha3 on sage.math, I applied v3, did `rm -rf devel/sage/build/` and then `env MAKE="make -j20" ./sage -ba-force`.  The latter fails after a number of 
`python `which cython`` commands:

```python
[...]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 799, in <module>

  File "setup.py", line 319, in execute_list_of_commands

    process_command_results(p.imap(apply_pair, command_list))
  File "setup.py", line 256, in process_command_results
    for r in result_values:

    raise value

sage: There was an error installing modified sage library code.
```
This doesn't happen with v1 or v2, but I'm not sure why.  Thoughts?

Probably on lines 687-690, "path" should be "dirname"?  I'm attaching a new version with this change.  Since all of the other patches list William as the author, I'm doing the same for this one...

Though I've seen this not very often (I think the first time with 4.6.alpha2), I can confirm that running into the race condition wasn't limited to NFS-mounted file systems...
