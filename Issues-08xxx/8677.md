If you want to try to fix the problem yourself, *don't* just cd to

Instead, the following commands setup all environment variables

When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the

My suspicion is, that the reason is some race condition in checking, whether during the build some directory has to be newly added, or already exists.

That is consistent with the fact that I have previously built Sage successfully: this was exactly the same version of Sage, on exactly the same hardware.  The only difference between the two situations was that before the unsuccessful build I did 'export MAKE="make -j6"' to make the build process use 6 jobs in parallel, whereas the successful build used only one build job.

I setup NFS on disk.math and sage.math, and when I export an NSF share using the async option two things happen: 

    (1) the filesystem is noticeably *much* faster,

    (2) I can repeatedly get the error that is being discussed here with, e.g., MAKE="make -j8" on sage.math. 

Probably the RedHat system Tom Coates was using has a similar NFS setup.

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
With `async` set, do we need to worry more than usual about data corruption?  According to [this Linux NFS FAQ](http://nfs.sourceforge.net/#faq_b6), `async` is potentially unsafe.

Should we do as Craig suggests above, e.g., `pass` in the `except` block if `dirname` now exists, but `raise` otherwise?

A correctly working NFSv3 shouldn't need the `async` options to achieve fast writes, but maybe some older servers/clients are being used? With `async`, data will be corrupted if the server crashes, but thats probably acceptable on a build system.

I take issue with the patch, however. The current race seems to be 

```
    if not os.path.exists(path): 
        # another process can create path here
        os.makedirs(path) 
        # error!
```
The correct fix would be to replace the whole if clause with 

```
    try: 
        os.makedirs(path) 
    except OSError: 
        pass 
```
But the patch mixes up both. It still contains the original race and then hacks around it to trap the error.

Are you just making this up, or?!

I strongly disagree.  I see no point in not including the

```
if not os.path.exists(dirname):
```
code, since that makes perfect sense when doing a serial build, which is what most people do.

Thats what the aforementioned FAQ says:

```
For the Linux implementation of NFS Version 3, using the "async" export option to allow faster writes is no longer necessary. NFS Version 3 explicitly allows a server to reply before writing data to disk, under controlled circumstances.
```

> I strongly disagree.  I see no point in not including the

The point is that the pattern "if (look at filesystem) then (modify filesystem)" is fundamentally flawed. Its the origin of countless security problems from temp races etc. The world is a better place without it :-) And the only way to make it die is to stomp it out wherever we encounter it...

With a clean, built-from-scratch 4.6.alpha3 on sage.math, I applied v3, did `rm -rf devel/sage/build/` and then `env MAKE="make -j20" ./sage -ba-force`.  The latter fails after a number of 
<code>python \`which cython\`</code> commands:

```python

This doesn't happen with v1 or v2, but I'm not sure why.  Thoughts?
