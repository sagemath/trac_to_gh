I've found myself taking the height of the same points over and over again, and have been starting to wish they were cached (especially over number fields). This patch does it.

I can't believe that we never cached heights before!  (Perhaps we did when they were only implemented over QQ, but I'm not going to go back and check).

Note that this is one case where the caching is slightly less trivial since we need to recompute of the desired precision is > the cached precision.  The patched code does that properly.

Applies fine to 4.4 and all elliptic_curves tests pass.
