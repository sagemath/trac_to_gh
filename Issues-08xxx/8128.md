Attachment [trac_8128-latex_cell_unicode.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket8128/trac_8128-latex_cell_unicode.patch) by @qed777 created at 2010-01-30 03:00:55

The patch uses the recently added (cf. #7249, #8051) `sagenb.misc.encoded_str` to avoid attempting to re-encode encoded strings.

I haven't tested this extensively, but it appears to fix the problem above.

From `sagenb.misc.misc`:

```python
def encoded_str(obj, encoding='utf-8'):
    if isinstance(obj, unicode):
        return obj.encode(encoding, 'ignore')
    return str(obj)

def unicode_str(obj, encoding='utf-8'):
