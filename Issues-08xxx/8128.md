Attachment: **[trac_8128-latex_cell_unicode.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8128/trac_8128-latex_cell_unicode.patch.gz)**

The patch uses the recently added (cf. #7249, #8051) `sagenb.misc.encoded_str` to avoid attempting to re-encode encoded strings.

I haven't tested this extensively, but it appears to fix the problem above.
