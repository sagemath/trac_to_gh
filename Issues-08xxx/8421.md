The documentation describes the 'left' and 'right' attributes of BipartiteGrpah as sets.  And deleting vertices is much more efficient if they are.  But they are currently stored as lists.

```
sage: bg = BipartiteGraph(graphs.CycleGraph(4))
sage: bg.left
[0, 2]
```

Of course, it's easy to change from one to the other.  But we will get better performance from sets.

Patch implements change.  It sits on my MQ stack on top of #8331 and #8329, but I don't think either of these are required.
