It would be great if the best-practices for patching sage packages were better (at all) documented. The following blog post should be definitely included into the developer manual:

http://mvngu.wordpress.com/2010/01/20/how-to-patch-a-sage-package/

See also [this discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/e599fd37de909264) on sage-devel for an example on how not to patch an spkg. The blog post [Evil spkgs?](http://wdjoyner.wordpress.com/2009/08/01/evil-spkgs/) lists some actions that an spkg must never do.

In addition, I'd like to know how to deal with updated configure scripts. Some issues are:
* The automake sources (configure.ac, Makefile.am, more?) are small and their changes need to be recorded in case upstream makes a new release.
* The automake sources might be automake-version dependent.
* Not everyone has all versions of automake installed, so spkg-install can't call automake.
* Running autoconf/automake generates big shell scripts (configure, makefile). Differences in these need not be recorded.   
* But different versions of automake will produce different scripts, which would clutter up naive patches.
