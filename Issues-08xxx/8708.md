This doesn't work for me: it skips all doctests in a typical file.  The issue is the line

```
min_ind = min(dq_ind, sq_ind)
```
which means that if either (not just both) search fails, then `min_ind` is `-1`, so the loop exits.

I also don't think we need to modify `doc_prefix` and `doc_suffix`, since this is part of the string written to the temporary doctesting file.  Do the triple quotes in that file have to match the original ones, or can they all be `"""`?

Good catch! Thanks for looking into this.

What happens if you have something like:

```
def f(arg):
    '''
    some text
        
    """
    some more text
    """

    '''
```

<div id="comment:8" align="right">Comment 8</div>

We missed an or two issue in #9739: with non-library files, first we just had a bug, using "source" instead of "file_name" or "root_name" or something.  Second, in the import statement added to the file,

```
s += "from %s import *\n\n" % target_name
```
we need to replace `target_name` with `os.path.basename(target_name)`.

In the new patch, I've made these two changes and also rebased.  Given that there is actually new content, this needs a new review.  Without the new content, doctesting .py non-library files completely fails, so I'm marking this as a blocker.  Feel free to downgrade if you think it's appropriate.

Oh, I also realized that the attached file for testing purposes has a bad name: replace the hyphen with an underscore.

Can anybody [else] review this [quickly]?

I now get the following doctest failures, certainly due to the triple single quote patch / modification:

```
The following tests failed:

Thanks; just the commit message there refers to this ticket (and its subject), i.e., is unrelated.

Unless nobody else reopens or closes tickets, or attaches files to / updates files on tickets I've already closed (and I didn't ask him to) I don't really care.

Reopening tickets IMHO only makes sense if I'm going to actually back it out.

The test failure in interacts/libary_cython.pyx is because of a doctest which would have failed in the past, but it was enclosed in triple single quotes, and so was skipped by the doctesting framework.  (There is a line saying `sage: print cellular(rule, 3)` with no output after it.)  We can certainly just stick in the output, but I have no idea if it's right.

I have a fix for sageinspect.py, but I'm not sure about worksheet.py.  I can work on it some more, but we should check whether there are failures in the flask notebook before working too hard on this one: if the file is going to go away soon, it's not worth working too hard fixing it.

I'm attaching a patch for the Sage library fixing the two files there; I'll try to get information about whether the patch to library_cython.pyx is actually the right thing to do.
