PALP fails to build in parallel with GNU `make`.  Some output from `make -d` (debug):

Error building PALP.
sage: An error occurred while installing palp-1.1.p2
```

It's not clear why this happens, but it breaks building spkgs in parallel (#8306).  As we've done with other packages, forcing a serial build helps.

PALP has a `Makefile` and a `GNUmakefile`.  GNU `make` prefers the latter.  It seems that `export MAKE="make"` in `spkg-install` is not enough to suppress a parallel build, but adding the special target [.NOTPARALLEL](http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/make/Special-Targets.html#index-g_t_002eNOTPARALLEL-248) to `GNUmakefile` works.

Building in parallel appears to work if I replace `GNUmakefile` with `Makefile`, but the compiler and compiler flags are different.  The package does not have an [obvious] test suite.

#7071 is another PALP ticket.

There's a similar problem on bsd.  Simply deleting `GNUmakefile` or copying it to `Makefile` fixes it.

Maybe it'll help to fix this and #7071 together?

Your changes to SPKG.txt are good, but the mention of only "GPL" did cause me to check the license. 

A look at the file src/COPYING shows only a link to the GPL, which is of course now version 3. The file does not contain the usual contents of the file COPYING. 

Looking at the history of PALP

http://hep.itp.tuwien.ac.at/~kreuzer/CY/CYpalp.html#History

I can see that version 1.1 (the latest, and the release in Sage) is dated November 2, 2006, which was before the GPL 3 existed. 

I believe SPKG.txt's license information should indicate the license is GPL2+, rather than GPL, but the reason for this needs to be given. Something along the lines of 

* When released, GPL 2 was in force. 
* There is a link to a web page, which now points to GPL 3, but would have pointed to GPL 2 at the time of the package was released. 
* Therefore one can deduce the authors were happy for this to be released under GPL 2 or a later version. 

One other minor point, it would be good to remove the line:

CC=gcc

from Makefile, as that would then allow one to at least attempt to build this with any compiler. The Makefile refers to $(CC) everywhere, so since CC is set by the Sage environment, this line could be usefully removed, but I realise this is unrelated to the main part of the change, so don't bother unless you feel inclined to. 

I will need to check the changes don't break the build (I can't believe they can do any harm whatsoever, but I can't actually check them just now). But once the SPKG.txt is revised, I'll give this a positive review, subject to me checking it does not break a serial build, which will take me a minute or two. (I'll check the parallel build issues as part of the #7071). 

Perhaps you could also attach a Mercurical patch file, which makes reviewing a little easier. 

Once those changes are made, I'll check that the package builds serially. Then I'll revisit #7071, as that relies on this anyway. Hopefully this will allow #7071 to be resolved soon, as I believe that is a great enhancement, but we need to be sure it can't break anything.

I've updated

* http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/8477/palp-1.1.p2.spkg

with your suggestions, except for removing `CC=gcc`.  See the attached the patch, which also has a workaround for parallel spkg builds that seems to work on sage.math and bsd (at least).  The makefiles differ by

```diff
 NEF_SRC= E_Poly.c Nefpart.c LG.c
 NEF_OBJ= $(NEF_SRC:.c=.o)
 
-CC=cc 
+CC=gcc
 
-CFLAGS=-O3 -fast
+CFLAGS=-O3 -g -W -Wall -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE
 # CFLAGS=-O3 -g                                      # add -g for GNU debugger gdb
 # CFLAGS=-Ofast -O3 -mips4 -n32                      # SGI / 32 bit
 # CFLAGS=-Ofast -O3 -mips4 -64                # SGI / 64 bit
```
Looking at the source, I think `-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64` and `-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE` are intended for 32-bit architectures.  But it appears the first definition is not used and the makefiles don't check the architecture.
