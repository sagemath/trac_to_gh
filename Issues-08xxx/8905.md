Apparently there is a memory leak in Sage-4.4 when one echelonizes a matrix over ``QQ``:

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ,8)
sage: M = MS.random_element()
sage: N = copy(M)
sage: N.echelonize()
sage: N==M
False
sage: mem = get_memory_usage()
sage: n = 0
sage: while(1):
....:     n+=1
....:     if get_memory_usage()>mem:
....:         mem = get_memory_usage()
....:         print mem,n
....:     N = copy(M)
....:     N.echelonize()
....:
797.95703125 1
798.0859375 32
798.21484375 71
798.34375 110
798.47265625 155
798.6015625 199
798.8515625 202
798.98046875 243
799.109375 292
799.23828125 329
799.37109375 371
799.5 406
799.79296875 426
799.921875 471
800.05078125 530
800.1796875 582
800.30859375 634
800.61328125 666
...
```

Here I show that the critical step really is the echelon form:

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ,8)
sage: M = MS.random_element()
sage: N = copy(M)
sage: mem = get_memory_usage()
sage: n = 0
sage: while(1):
....:     n+=1
....:     if get_memory_usage()>mem:
....:         mem = get_memory_usage()
....:         print mem,n
....:     N = copy(M)
....:
797.92578125 1
```
The memory consumption is stable at that point. So, copying ``M`` is no problem, but computing the echelon form is!

I guess #10262 might explain both of these leaks. I wouldn't find it strange that somewhere in both algorithms scalar*vector multiplication happens.

I wouldn't be so quick to conclude linear behaviour from so few data points. I'm getting:

```
1130.9375 1
1131.1875 5107
1131.4375 22580
1131.6875 39743
```
and no further increase up to `n=738068` (after which I gave up). Echelonization over QQ likely leads to very complicated memory use (lots of allocation/deallocation), so together with non-deterministic gc (because parents only clear on triggered GC) you expect that the memory layout shows a lot of short-term fluctuations: fragmentation will lead to slowly increasing memory footprint; hopefully stabilizing over long periods. The numbers above are quite consistent with that. Certainly gc.objects() is not showing any significant object accumulation, so any leak would have to be outside python.

I see no indication of a memory leak here anymore, but I guess you could valgrind it to be certain.
