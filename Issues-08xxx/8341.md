It seems like this should show a vertical asymptote at x=1, but it doesn't:

```
plot(1/((x-1)^2), (x, -3.5, 3.5), detect_poles='show', ymin = -5, ymax = 5) 
```

<a id='comment:1'></a>It would be nice to fix this. But current detect_poles simply skips the lines with slope close to pi/2 and draws the vertical asyptote, if the function changes sign (skips from -infinity to +infinity). I think that using this idea it is not possible to detect vertical asymptote. 

Just some attempts: If we drop the condition which requires change in sign, 
we get "interval of asymptotes" - the asymptote is too thick.
Making epsilon smaller introduces problems with other graphs.

This is the diff with my experiments, if someone is interested
