```

        The following example illustrates that the Riemann-Roch space
        function in Singular doesn't *not* work correctly.
        
        ::
        
            sage: R.<x,y,z> = GF(5)[]
            sage: f = x^7 + y^7 + z^7
            sage: C = Curve(f); pts = C.rational_points()
            sage: D = C.divisor([ (3, pts[0]), (-1,pts[1]), (10, pts[5]) ])
            sage: C.riemann_roch_basis(D)    # output is random (!!!!)
            [x/(y + x), (z + y)/(y + x)]
        
        The answer has dimension 2 (confirmed via Magma). But it varies
        between 1 and quite large with Singular.
```

The problem can be solved by learning how the relevant code in Singular works then correctly wrapping it.

I'm leaving it as needs work for now since I want to test it on more machines. I'm posting it in case others want to test it too.

My impression is that the problem lies with Singular. I adapted the example in the description above and typed directly into Singular the following:

```
kill s, C, Ctemp, temp, G, R, LG;

LIB "brnoeth.lib";
int plevel=printlevel;
printlevel=-1;
system("random", 1);

ring s=5,(x,y),lp;
list C=Adj_div(x7+y7+1);
C=NSplaces(1,C);
def R=C[1][2];

# I want to look at the points to be able to define
# the same divisor each time, see below
def Ctemp=extcurve(1,C);
def temp=Ctemp[1][5];
setring temp;
print(POINTS);

setring R;

# adapt the line below according to the ordering of the points
# i always chose the divisor 3(0,-1,1)-1(1,2,1)+10(2,1,1)
intvec G = ;

list LG=BrillNoether(G,C);
LG;

printlevel=plevel;
```

Not only did the bases vary each time I ran this code (even though I fixed the random seed in the sixth line), the resulting bases also had different cardinality (either 0 or 2).

(I also tried to post this on the Singular trac server, but failed to do so. Maybe someone else is able to update the Singular ticket?)

Following Jose's explanations on the Singular trac server, the modified Sage wrapper should now work with the new patch. What the unmodified wrapper did wrong was how it defined the divisor in Singular. There's actually two lists that are important: The divisor needs to be defined relative to the list of points C[3] (in the above example), but to know which point the k-th entry of this list actually refers to, one has to parse the list POINTS of the rings C[5][d][1], where d is the degree of the point. -- The patch also modifies the documentation to illustrate this with an example.
