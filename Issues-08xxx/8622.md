In ticket #5262 I implemented a method to find the Atkin-Lehner eigenvalue of a modular form. Sadly this does not work if the form has odd weight:

```
sage: f = Newforms(Gamma1(13),3,names='a')[0]
sage: f
q + a0*q^2 + (1/7*a0^3 + 2/7*a0^2 - 3/7*a0 - 27/7)*q^3 + (-8/21*a0^3 - 23/21*a0^2 - 88/21*a0 + 16/7)*q^4 + (2/7*a0^3 + 11/7*a0^2 + 29/7*a0 + 9/7)*q^5 + O(q^6)
sage: f.atkin_lehner_eigenvalue()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ArithmeticError                           Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ArithmeticError: subspace is not invariant under matrix
```

This comes up because for modular symbols of any odd weight, the Atkin-Lehner involution doesn't commute with the star involution and hence doesn't restrict to an operator on the plus submodule of the modular symbols (hence "subspace not invariant under matrix"). In fact they *anti-commute*:

```
sage: N = f.modular_symbols(sign=0)
sage: a = N.atkin_lehner_operator(13).matrix()
sage: b = N.star_involution().matrix()
sage: a * b * ~a * ~b
[-1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0]
[ 0 -1  0  0  0  0  0  0]
[ 0  0 -1  0  0  0  0  0]

[ 0  0  0  0  0  0 -1  0]
[ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0 -1]
```

A morally right fix would probably also allow us to implement pseudo-eigenvalues for Atkin-Lehner operators when the character is not trivial or quadratic. See also the [sage-nt thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-nt/browse_thread/thread/3c7bd65248e3b0c8/f8b9f3595f38788b).

What's worse is the following:

```
sage: f = Newforms(Gamma1(7),3,names='a')[0]
sage: f
q - 3*q^2 + 5*q^4 + O(q^6)
sage: f.atkin_lehner_eigenvalue()
3
```
Here, f is a CM form with CM by its own Nebentype and hence has totally real coefficients. It is therefore an eigenvector of Atkin–Lehner. But the eigenvalue is certainly not 3, since it must be i or -i. This function should at least raise an NotImplementedError for odd weights. Note that the documentation for this function says that it always returns 1 or -1 (which would be wrong even if it was properly implemented).

Would it be silly to simply compute a ratio of L-values?

I have some old code lying around which prevents obviously bogus values being returned; I'll see if I can dig it up as a stopgap.

The trouble with the trick you mention is that (unless I've misunderstood) you would only get a numerical approximation to the eigenvalue, and you'd have to choose an embedding of the coefficient field into CC; and it is difficult to recognise a number field element from a numerical approximation to it, as always. 

One of the PhD students here at Warwick, Barinder Banwait, has been working on calculating Atkin-Lehner eigenvalues and he may have some code ready soon.

Well, you do only get a numerical approximation to the eigenvalue, but in the odd weight case, you know the eigenvalue is i or -i, since the square of Atkin–Lehner acts by (-1)<sup>k</sup> (where k is the weight).

As for embeddings, I think I'd have to consider it more carefully to be sure, but my feeling is that this shouldn't matter. The functional equation relates the L-function of f at s to the L-function of W(f) at k-s and W(f) = w*f', where f' is the newform whose coefficients are the complex conjugates of those of f. The newforms we are discussing have totally real coefficients, so f'=f and L(s,f) is related to L(k-s,f) by a functional equation, and w, the Atkin–Lehner eigenvalue, appears in that functional equation (and w<sup>2</sup> = -1). Now, L(s,f) really depends on a complex embedding of the Hecke eigenvalue field of f into C, but such a dependancy shouldn't change the sign of the functional equation (right?). Now, I found a newform with CM by its own Nebentypus and Hecke eigenvalue field a totally real cubic extension and tried this out and the answer I got was independent of the complex embedding:

```

    K = selfe.hecke_eigenvalue_field()
    iotas = K.complex_embeddings()
    Ls = []
    i = 0
    for iota in iotas:
        Ls.append(Dokchitser(conductor = selfe.level(), gammaV = [0, 1], weight = selfe.weight(), eps = 1, prec = prec))
        coeffs = 'coeff = %s;'%[iota(a_n) for a_n in selfe.q_expansion(prec).list()]
        #print coeffs
        Ls[-1].init_coeffs('coeff[k+1]', pari_precode = coeffs, max_imaginary_part = max_imaginary_part, max_asymp_coeffs = max_asymp_coeffs)

Obviously, it would be nice to be able to deal with the pseudo-eigenvalues in the general case, but in the meantime, if this makes sense, it would be nice.

> Well, you do only get a numerical approximation to the eigenvalue, but in the odd weight case, you know the eigenvalue is i or -i, since the square of Atkin–Lehner acts by (-1)k (where k is the weight). 

Just to be clear: are you referring here to your very specific case of odd weight CM forms with CM by their own nebentypus? Otherwise this statement is false: you know the product of the pseudo-eigenvalues of f and f*, but there is no reason why these two numbers should be equal.

Right. I'm only referring to that specific case. And while it does seem like an extremely specific case, it is also true that the only newforms on Γ<sub>1</sub> that are actual eigenvectors of Atkin–Lehner are those of trivial character and those with CM by their own Nebentypus. Since the function in question is atkin_lehner_eigenvalue, and it seems like we can deal with all cases in which it makes sense to call this function, I think it makes sense it implement it. For the pseudoeigenvalues, it might be better to make a new function atkin_lehner_pseudoeigenvalue which can return the eigenvalue in the above cases.

This will hopefully be solved by #18061 (I didn't know about this ticket when I opened that one), although currently it isn't.  With #18061 applied I now get (choosing the base ring such that `gauss_sum()` has a chance of working)

```
sage: f = Newforms(Gamma1(13), 3, CyclotomicField(40), names='a')[0]
sage: f.atkin_lehner_eigenvalue()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Cannot coerce zeta52 into Cyclotomic Field of order 40 and degree 16
```
This seems to be caused by `gauss_sum()` working in the wrong cyclotomic field; doing `f.character().gauss_sum()` leads to the same error.  Applying #19056 does not solve this (yet).
