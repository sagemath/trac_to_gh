Setting SAGE64=yes has only effect in this package in OSX Darwin.

To let this work on Open Solaris and evt. other platforms we changed
spkg-install and patches/makemakefile.py a little bit.

A patch is coming up.

I think it is pritty harmless to add $LDFLAGS here. If you don't agree I leave this one to you. I've enough of -m64 :)

One more comment. Look at this from the spkg-install file:


```
if [ "x$SAGE64" = xyes ]; then
   echo "64 bit build"
   CFLAGS="-O3 -g -m64 -fPIC -L."; export CFLAGS
   LDFLAGS="-m64 "; export LDFLAGS
   cp patches/makemakefile.py src/makemakefile.py
elif [ `uname` = "SunOS" -a "`ld  --version  2>&1  | grep GNU`" = ""  ]; then
   # Change -soname to -h if the Sun linker is used. 
   sed 's/-soname/-h/g' src/makemakefile.py > /tmp/makemakefile.py.$$
   mv /tmp/makemakefile.py.$$ src/makemakefile.py
   CFLAGS="-fPIC -O3 -L."; export CFLAGS
   LDFLAGS=""; export LDFLAGS
else
   CFLAGS="-fPIC -O3 -L."; export CFLAGS
   LDFLAGS=""; export LDFLAGS
fi

```

You see LDFAGS is empty except when SAGE64=yes. For now Darwin and SunOS x64 64 bit.

Only in this case the patches/makemakefile.py is copied. The darwin case is resolved first (even without using the LDFLAGS :) ), see the makefile.

Remains the building of the .so file in our case and that definitely needs the
LDFLAGS set to -m64.

If you don't accept this reasoning, I rest my case.


Cheers,

Jaap

OK, I accept your reasoning. However #8280 got .p2 first, so you will need to create a version against that. 

Once you have done that, I'll convert this to a positive review.
