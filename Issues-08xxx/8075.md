The sage/eclib interface is rather old and could be simplified and made more efficient, probably after a major change to eclib to remove the NTL/LiDIA duality which has never been used by Sage and is essentially dead.

Yes.  It would be nice to expose more of the modular symbol functionality of eclib to Sage, more than the minimal `CremonaModularSymbols()` which was done a long time ago:

```
sage: %time M = ModularSymbols(10001)
CPU times: user 6.42 s, sys: 196 ms, total: 6.62 s
Wall time: 6.61 s
sage: %time M = CremonaModularSymbols(10001)
CPU times: user 139 ms, sys: 3.87 ms, total: 143 ms
Wall time: 142 ms
```
There is no reason in principle for Sage not to be able to access all the functionality which is used to produce all the modular elliptic curves of conductor `N` for reasonable `N`.

I am going to close this since the specific things mentioned were done long ago, though certainly there is more eclib functionality which could be exposed to Sage but is not.
