The sage/eclib interface is rather old and could be simplified and made more efficient, probably after a major change to eclib to remove the NTL/LiDIA duality which has never been used by Sage and is essentially dead.

Is this still of any actual pertinence ?

Yes.  It would be nice to expose more of the modular symbol functionality of eclib to Sage, more than the minimal `CremonaModularSymbols()` which was done a long time ago:

```
sage: %time M = ModularSymbols(10001)
CPU times: user 6.42 s, sys: 196 ms, total: 6.62 s
Wall time: 6.61 s
sage: %time M = CremonaModularSymbols(10001)
CPU times: user 139 ms, sys: 3.87 ms, total: 143 ms
Wall time: 142 ms
```
There is no reason in principle for Sage not to be able to access all the functionality which is used to produce all the modular elliptic curves of conductor `N` for reasonable `N`.

I am going to close this since the specific things mentioned were done long ago, though certainly there is more eclib functionality which could be exposed to Sage but is not.
