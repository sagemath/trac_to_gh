<a id='comment:2'></a>Hi Dima!

I saw at this ticket when it was created, but I understood from the ticket description that it was not possible to install database_gap.

Are you saying that you can install database_gap, but the install script of the group cohomology package does not recognise it? What did you change to make it recognise database_gap?

I am currently preparing a major upgrade of the group cohomology package. I expect it to be ready in about 2 weeks. Probably it would be easiest to incorporate the necessary  changes in the new version.

What do you think?

Best regards,

Simon

Hi Simon,

no, it was a Solaris-only problem, on the other patforms it worked just fine.
(and the fix is trivial and available already)

> 
> Are you saying that you can install database_gap, but the install script of the group cohomology package does not recognise it? What did you change to make it recognise database_gap?


well, when did it work last time, with which Sage release?
Probably since then the semantics of the script newest_version that you call in spkg-install has changed.
It MUST be called from SAGE_ROOT/spkg --- if you call it from somewhere else it reports nonsense.

So here is the diff:

Starting with an spkg, I installed it in sage-4.3.1 to the least. And calling spkg-install directly is what I do all the time, with the newest sage.

Simon, 

calling spkg-install directly is certainly NOT the way it is meant to be installed.
It is meant to be installed either from within sage by calling install_package, or by calling
sage -i (or sage -f) at the shell prompt.
If this does not work, 99.9% of the users won't have a clue what to do.

Please check that this works for you now, too.

you better just grab the spkg linked above, and tell Minh (and/or the release manager) to upgrade the sagemath.org repository
using this file. There this diff is already applied and the changes reflected in SPKG.txt
and in the Mercurial:
the repository was off in your spkg, I had to do a hg add and a hg commit; I aslo created .hgignore to ignore src/db files (having huge files in hg isn't good, and you have an online database with these, anyway).

This way, I could give it a positive review (pretending you did it all:-)).

Best,
Dima

I think we talk about totally different situations. You seem to talk about version 1.2, which is published and should certainly be installable by a user doing sage -i.

But IMO, sage -i is the way to go **only if the package is finished**. I am talking about the yet-to-be-published version 2.0. I am still not finished with all details of the new algorithms and documentation, and it has not being packaged yet.

I will certainly not do sage -i while developing new algorithms. Namely, before doing sage -i, one has to have a spkg. Thus, I would have to do sage -pkg after each tiny little change, 20-50 times a day! That's clumsy! 

Moreover, sage -i should be equivalent to unpacking the spkg (well, it is unpacked since I didn't pack my development version yet) and calling spkg-install (plus, perhaps, spkg-check) in the sage environment. So, if spkg-install works (which it does for me) then sage -i should work as well.

So, testing whether sage -i still works will only be the last step before publishing version 2.0. 

> Please check that this works for you now, too.


You seem to talk about version 1.2. This version *did* work, on quite a broad range of platforms. I never had the problem that you describe. 

In fact, I just tested (sage 4.3.4 on Opensuse; you said that the problem is not platform specific), and sage -f p_group_cohomology-1.2.spkg (without your changes) came easily beyond the point where the existence of database_gap is tested. Then, I interrupted with Ctrl-C.

So, can you please tell me how I can reproduce the problem that you met?

I don't plan to re-publish version 1.2, unless I can reproduce the problem. But I will pull it into version 2.0.

> and in the Mercurial:

WHAT? 

Sorry for shouting, but certainly the repository was not off. I don't know if you ever did sage -pkg, but it gives an unmistakable warning if the repository is not fine.

That you had to do hg commit is clear. But certainly spkg-install was in the repository. So, why hg add?

> I aslo created .hgignore to ignore src/db files (having huge files in hg isn't good, and you have an online database with these, anyway).


Here I am not so sure, but I thought that I did not include src/db in the repository, for this reason. BTW, the online database does *not* contain the cohomology rings for the groups of order 64 -- these are only provided by the database in the package. 

> This way, I could give it a positive review (pretending you did it all:-)).


Now I am totally confused.

First of all, I think that this ticket is a "wontfix", because it will soon be superseded by another ticket that I will open when I publish version 2.0.

Moreover, it is about a problem that I can not reproduce.

Then you say you will give a positive review -- to changes that you did yourself?

Best regards,

Simon

I just verified that SPKG.txt and spkg-install are tracked in the spkg's repository, and that the database for the groups of order 64 is not tracked.

So, I can not reproduce any of the issues that you are reporting.

Simon,

In http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/p_group_cohomology-1.2.spkg
(do you talk about the same repository?) hg  reports

```
? mtxoriginal/COPYING
? mtxoriginal/README
? mtxoriginal/bin/Makefile
? mtxoriginal/bin/proggy/f1
? mtxoriginal/bin/proggy/f2
[...edited out...]
```
the "?" status means something like "hg does not know about this file; it is there, but I have no clue how to deal with it" which is obviously not what one likes to have, even if sage -spkg
does not complain. Moreover in SPKG.txt you say 

```
Note that most of the code is original. Therefore we included the files from
src into the Mercurial repository.
```
Probably it slipped through when the package was reviewed.

Best,
Dima

Sure, I do talk about 1.2 (and I was baffled by what you wrote). And 1.2 is broken, it does not install on any Sage 4.3.4 I have (as I was busy with updating gap-related spkgs and cvxopt spkg, I have a large supply presently :-)).
For instance, one compiled from source on boxen.math 

```
dima@boxen:~/sage/sage-4.3.4/spkg/standard$ ls database_g*
database_gap-4.4.12.p0.spkg
```
ok, so SmallGroups are there, but I cannot install the package (I just copied the canonical 1.2 version to /tmp)

as I explained in another reply, to bring it in line to what you wrote in SPKG.txt.
By the way, I was pointed out few times by spkg reviewers that having hg-"?"-marked files in the spkg is not good, and they insisted on fixing this.

well, 2.0 is still at least weeks away, and then reviewing, etc etc. Meanwhile there is a broken spkg on the list of optional packages, and the fix is ready. So, please, please, let us fix it, and be done with.

  In http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/p_group_cohomology-1.2.spkg (do you talk about the same repository?) hg  reports

```
  ? mtxoriginal/COPYING 
  ? mtxoriginal/README 
  ? mtxoriginal/bin/Makefile 
  ...
```

Ah, now I understand. In fact, these files do not belong into the hg repository, IMO.

The `mtxoriginal/` folder is just a reference to the original `C-MeatAxe`, as it was downloaded from upstream. And if I remember correctly, as a rule of thumb, any SPKG should provide third party code in its original form.

On the other hand, look into the `src/` folder. As a subfolder, you will find another copy of `C-MeatAxe`. This one contains many modifications made by David Green and myself. Since these modifications are, to some extent, original code, I've put it under version control: You will find that this subfolder *is* in the hg repository.

Changes to third party code should be made transparent, and I thought that if there are many changes then the resulting large diff file would be less transparent than having both versions simultaneously: The version from third party, and our modified version.

Only the code in `src/` is compiled, and it may change when upgrading the package. But the stuff in `mtxoriginal/` is not compiled, and it will not be touched. So, there is no point of putting `mtxoriginall/` under version control.

> Moreover in SPKG.txt you say  ` Note that most of the code is original.  Therefore we included the files from src into the Mercurial repository. `


Exactly. And it also says:

```
The package includes a modified version of the Aachen C-MeatAxe. Since the
changes are major, we included the modified sources into the Mercurial
repository. A MeatAxe version that comes closest to what we started with
is provided in the folder mtxoriginal.
```
I thought this is clear enough.

IIRC, the developer's guide says that the `src/` folder of an SPKG should *not* be under version control. I asked why, and got the reply that *normally* it contains third party code that is simply dropped in, so that version control does not make sense.

Here, we have original code, and therefore `src/` is under version control, in contrast to most other SPKGs.

Probably I should better add a `.hgignore`, so that `mtxoriginal/` gets ignored...

Best regards,

Simon

Really? OK, then something needs to be done. 

It did compile on several platforms. Personally, I tested Suse linux (two different machines at my university), sage-math, and Intel mac (Darwin). David Joyner and William Stein tested it on various other platforms, like Ubuntu. The issues found there had been sorted out.

 For instance, one compiled from source on boxen.math

See my reply there: These files, I think, do not belong under version control, but making this clear by .hgignore might be a good idea.

Right, that makes sense.

So, I will test on boxen. If successful, I will probably then do the following:

* Adopt your changes to spkg-install
* Mention these changes in SPKG.txt
* Putting mtxoriginal under .hgignore
* Ask whether this change can be put into the sage repository.

The question is, though: Should this still be p_group_cohomology-1.2, or better p_group_cohomology-1.2.1? And who is giving a positive review? :)

Best regards,

Simon

Right. Indeed, the most sensible thing seems to have .hgignore as follows:

```
mtxoriginal
src/db
```
(and do not forget to "hg add .hgignore", so that "hg status" would not report anything at all)

OK, so my complaint was about "hg status" reporting lots of "?"-marked files, I didn't 
look more carefully what exactly was there --- my guess was it's the entire directory, as also .hgignore file wasn't 
there at all.

Best,

Dima

Apparently since the release of your spkg there was a semantics change in some Sage scripts that now causes us this headache.

there is a ready binary install for sage.math, you can just grab it instead, and try out on sage.math (not on boxen)
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.3.4/sage-4.3.4-sage.math.washington.edu-x86_64-Linux.tar.gz
This would be much faster.

p_group_cohomology-1.2.p0 seems to be the proper name.

That's a tough one :-)
well, if you do not mention my name in the changes then I won't be a co-author, and will be able to review, IMHO.
We could also ask Dave, the initiator of the ticket...

<a id='comment:15'></a>Hi Dima!

Now I am even more puzzled.

I did precisely the following steps:

* I copied and unpacked the sage-4.3.4 binary for sage.math on sage.math
* I started ./sage and waited until it had updated paths. Then I quit sage.
* I edited ./sage, replacing "......" by the correct value of SAGE_ROOT
* I started ./sage again, testing it with "2+gap(2)"
* I did install_package('database_gap') followed by install_package('gap_packages').
* Then, I did install_package('p_group_cohomology'), and could then do "from pGroupCohomology import CohomologyRing"


It installed fine, there was no error. I think this is how a user is supposed to install things, and so I can still not reproduce the error.

Cheers,

Simon

I can confirm that indeed this way it works for me (on boxen with a compiled Sage 4.3.4-version), too.

OK, so it appears to be an inconsistency in the Sage behaviour, when the option -i (or -f) is used to install the package. (AFAIK, these options are not something for experts only, they should work just the same...)

It is, perhaps, a bug in newest_version script.
I'll see if I can find it quickly...

But if one of the two usual ways of installing the package does work, then it might be acceptable to leave it as it is, and then to take care that *both* ways of installation work for p_group_cohomology-2.0.

What do you think?

I spent an hour trying to sort this out, and my only conclusion is that on a clean and fresh install things work both ways.
Apparently there is a subtle bug that only manifests itself after unsuccessful installs of spkgs, something gets inconsistent...

I propose to mark this ticket as "won't fix", as this is certainly nothing wrong
with this spkg (except that hg inconsistency one can live with, at least if a new spkg release is coming).

... and this is what I did in my spkg-install (for exactly the reason you explain):

```
SMALL_GROUPS=`cd $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/optional/; $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/newest_version database_gap`
if [ "$SMALL_GROUPS" = "" ]; then
    SMALL_GROUPS=`cd $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/installed/; $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/newest_version database_gap`

if [ -f "$INSTALLED/$PKG_NAME" -a $FORCE -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "sage: $1 is already installed"
    touch "$INSTALLED/$PKG_NAME"
    exit 0
fi
```
where $INSTALLED is SAGE_ROOT/spkg/installed, $PKG_NAME is the name without "spkg", and you could omit "-a $FORCE", I think.

Good, I'll check this.

What are the opinions: Can this wait until p_group_cohomology-2.0 is finished (since version 1.2 does work, provided the users install everything the "normal" way)? Or should there been a version 1.2.p0?

Best regards,

Simon

<a id='comment:25'></a>Hi John!

I don't know how it works what you suggested. First of all, $INSTALLED has no value in the sage shell:

```
sage subshell$ echo $INSTALLED

```

Could it be that it is only defined inside `SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-spkg`?

And one problem with this method is that (if I understand correctly) one has to provide the exact version of the package whose existence is being tested. 

But I don't want a method to test for the presence of database_gap-4.4.12 (so that it wouldn't work if database_gap-4.4.10 is installed). I want to test if *any* version of database_gap is there. 

And I think that this is exactly the purpose of the script `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/newest_version`.

Cheers,

Simon

Hi Simon,

OK, so it seems that I provided a "fix" that does not always work from within Sage, and your original package setup
does not always work with sage -i.

In your case, the safest would be just to call "sage -gap" and see if it has SmallGroups stuff loaded.
E.g. just check that the output of

```
echo "SmallGroup(13,1); quit;" | $SAGE_ROOT/sage -gap -b -T | grep "13"
```
is nonempty.

Best,
Dima

That's right.

> And one problem with this method is that (if I understand correctly) one has to provide the exact version of the package whose existence is being tested. 


I think that's right, too.  I don't know much about writing shell scripts, but this seems to work:

```/usr/bin/env bash

INSTALLED="$SAGE_PACKAGES/installed/"
PKG_NAME=`echo "$1" | sed -e "s/\.spkg$//"`
PKG_NAME=`basename "$PKG_NAME"`
PKG_BASE=`echo "$PKG_NAME" | sed -e "s/-.*//"`

cd "$SAGE_PACKAGES/installed"

if [ `echo $PKG_BASE*` ]; then
    echo "sage: $PKG_BASE is already installed"
    exit 0
fi
```
($SAGE_PACKAGES is defined by running "sage -sh".)  This script defines PKG_BASE to be the name of the package without the version number: everything up to the first hyphen or period, whichever comes first.

<a id='comment:29'></a>Hi!

I created a new patch level version, which I was able to install on sage.math by

```
./sage -i http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/p_group_cohomology-1.2.p0.spkg
```

Changes: 
- adding .hgignore
- modifying SPKG.txt (adding this change to the changelog, and putting the changelog in reverse chronological order)
- modifying spkg-install.

The test for the presence of Small Groups is now

```
SMALL_GROUPS=`echo "SmallGroup(13,1); quit;" | $SAGE_ROOT/sage -gap -b -T | grep "13"`
if [ "$SMALL_GROUPS" = "" ]; then
   echo "It seems that GAP's SmallGroups library is missing."
   echo "One way to install it is by doing"
   echo "    sage: install_package('database_gap')"
   echo "in a Sage session."
   exit 1
fi
```

Note that this is *really* a test for the Small Groups library, rather than for the database_gap spkg. The error message is a bit more descriptive as well.

hg status does not return question marks.

So, ready for review!

Cheers,

Simon

Hi,

OK, good, I checked that it also works on boxen and Solaris (Sparc)(t2).
On t2 I also tried few things from the package:

```
sage: from pGroupCohomology.dickson import DICKSON
sage: D = DICKSON(3)
sage: d_3_1 = D(3,1)
sage: d_3_1
y0^18*y1^6 + ...
```

I give it a positive review (despite my name mentioned in SPKG, I only contributed an idea for a fix, but I didn't touch the code).

Best,
