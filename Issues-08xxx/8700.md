Looking in the changelog, the last person to work on the spkg left this message:

```
=== libpng-1.2.35.p0 (Jaap Spies, Feb 1th, 2010) ===
 *
```

What was done?  It doesn't say.    The log shows this though:

```
changeset:   13:ae01944f408c
tag:         tip
user:        Jaap Spies <jaapspies@gmail.com>
date:        Thu Feb 04 19:32:51 2010 +0100
summary:     Corrected stupid typo I thought I had corrected earlier.

changeset:   12:329a8eb6dd2e
user:        Jaap Spies <jaapspies@gmail.com>
date:        Wed Feb 03 19:09:41 2010 +0100
summary:     Let SAGE64=yes work not only on OSX, but also on Open Solaris and possibly on other platform
```

Anyway, somebody was sloppy refereeing this, etc.

I'm downgrading this from a blocker to critical: the current spkg makes the Sage source distribution a little bigger, but causes no bugs or test failures.
