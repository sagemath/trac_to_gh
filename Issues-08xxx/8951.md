As reported here

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/54544d8649bd027a

there is a problem when temp files created during the build of ECL. A correct fix requires changes made to ECL source code, but as a temporary fix, it may be sufficient to remove /tmp/ECL* after building ecl.

<a id='comment:1'></a>I've attached a patch. It removes the files only on Solaris. It also has a couple of minor corrections 

* It no longer reports a 32-bit build. Previously it reported a 32-bit build unless a 64-bit build was requested, but on some systems the default is 64-bit, so the message was incorrect. 
* Checks for SAGE64 being 'yes' and not 'yes' and '1' as before, as there is other code in Sage which prevents '1' being used. 

These two are just very minor changes - the main change is to delete /tmp/ECL*

What I find a bit odd, is that I don't see these tmp files on my own Sun Blade 2000 SPARC, which runs Solaris 10 update 8 (05/2009). I can only assume they are created them removed by ecl, so why this should not happen on 't2' is a mystery.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Here's a revised ecl-10.4.1. 


http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/ecl-10.4.1/ecl-10.4.1.spkg

It includes 

* The latest release of ecl - taken from the package posted at #8808
* Removes /tmp/ECL* on Solaris. 
* Corrected minor issue with SAGE64, which would have in theory worked if SAGE64 was set to '1', but earlier bits of sage force SAGE64 to be only 'yes' or 'no', so there was no point checking for this. 
* Comment in the code about this SAGE64 change is now more accurate. 

I've tested this on sage.math and it works fine.

My package should work fine.

My reason for saying to add #8808 first is because my patch was based on the patch applied in #8088, so assumed the wording of SPKG.txt in #8088 as a starting point and used the Mercurial repository in #8088 as a starting point. Also, since William updated the package, he should get credit for that ticket. It has already got positive review. 

From the point of view of actual code, it would have made no difference whatsoever.

Anyway, you have now posted another version, based on #8645. Someone needs to review it. I looked over spkg-install and SPKG.txt and they look OK to me, but I can hardly review it.

That Maxima ticket has not been updated for 3 weeks. If ECL & Maxima need to be updated together, that leaves a whole load of issues unresolved about ECL. Some I can think of are\n\n* The original aim of the ticket, which was to clear the tmp files - a trivial change, that does not need ECL updated, but allows Sage to build more relieably on 't2'\n* The minor SAGE64 issue - again, a trivial (cosmetic) change that does not need ECL updated.\n* It stops the building of spkg's in parallel, as the ECL makefile needs a trivial edit for that - see #9187. Again, that does not need a new version of ECL for this. \n* It stops a build of ECL on 64-bit OpenSolaris - see #8089. Again, the option to permit this does not need a new upstream version of ECL. \n\nIt seems to me we have three choices here:\n\n* Update ECL, without updating Maxima, which I think you are saying is not possible.  \n* Update both Maxima and ECL to the latest versions **quickly**. \n* Apply all the other very small changes to the ECL 10.2.1 that is in Sage now. So leaving updating ECL to 10.4.1 until a later date. \n\nI've created #9264 to update ECL to 10.4.1 and apply all changes. \n\nIt might however be wiser to create another ticket to just apply all the small changes to ECL 10.2.1. \n\nDave",

Jason, 

what is there about this ticket that means it can only be merged simultaneously with the new Maxima at #8731? That Maxima ticket has not been updated for 3 weeks. If ECL & Maxima need to be updated together, that leaves a whole load of issues unresolved about ECL. Some I can think of are

* The original aim of the ticket, which was to clear the tmp files - a trivial change, that does not need ECL updated, but allows Sage to build more relieably on 't2'
* The minor SAGE64 issue - again, a trivial (cosmetic) change that does not need ECL updated.
* It stops the building of spkg's in parallel, as the ECL makefile needs a trivial edit for that - see #9187. Again, that does not need a new version of ECL for this. 
* It stops a build of ECL on 64-bit OpenSolaris - see #8089. Again, the option to permit this does not need a new upstream version of ECL. 

It seems to me we have three choices here:

* Update ECL, without updating Maxima, which I think you are saying is not possible.  
* Update both Maxima and ECL to the latest versions **quickly**. 
* Apply all the other very small changes to the ECL 10.2.1 that is in Sage now. So leaving updating ECL to 10.4.1 until a later date. 

I've created #9264 to update ECL to 10.4.1 and apply all changes. 

It might however be wiser to create another ticket to just apply all the small changes to ECL 10.2.1. 

Dave
