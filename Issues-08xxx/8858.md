Hi, while watching the compilation of 4.4.1 I saw that it stopped
compiling and waited for a package to download. I'm curious if this is
intended or just a strange glitch. At least my idea of a self
containing source package is that it doesn't need to download software
from the internet!

And well, it waits the usual 2 minutes socket timeout in each line and
the pocoo website is really down.

I think that's not the notebook component, because it affects the sphinx package. john cremona had another problem with the notebook spkg. So, there are at least two issues like that and probably even more?

From Tim, who also points out that I was wrong:

```
This isn't related to my new package includes. Jinja2 wasn't one of those new packages. 
The problem is that SageNB is installed before Jinja2 is installed, so it's more of
a problem in the dependency script.
```
