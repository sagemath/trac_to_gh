There is a mistake in thematic_tutorials/conf.py which prevents math like `\QQ` from being rendered properly.  This is fixed in #11632, so I've made that a dependency for this ticket.  (Please review it!)

I've fixed some typos and grammatical errors.  See the "delta" patch for the differences between my patch and the previous one.  I'm happy with what you've done, so if you're happy with my changes, give the ticket a positive review.

Thanks for correcting my bad English. I'm mostly happy with your change. The
only remark I have is the removal of the link
<code>:ref:\`tutorial-programming-python\`</code>. It is an up coming tutorial which is
not yet fully finished. I'm creating a new ticket (#11633) and reinstating the pointer
there.

Thanks for your careful review.
