Thanks for correcting my bad English. I'm mostly happy with your change. The
only remark I have is the removal of the link
<code>:ref:\`tutorial-programming-python\`</code>. It is an up coming tutorial which is
not yet fully finished. I'm creating a new ticket (#11633) and reinstating the pointer
there.

Thanks for your careful review.

Nicolas pointed out the following typo:

line 14: 

``functions (see the "Programming" section of the Sage tutorial) -- but now further
+knowledge``

"now" should be "no". I'm updating a corrected patch.
