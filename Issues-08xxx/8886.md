Thanks for correcting my bad English. I'm mostly happy with your change. The
only remark I have is the removal of the link
`:ref:`tutorial-programming-python``. It is an up coming tutorial which is
not yet fully finished. I'm creating a new ticket (#11633) and reinstating the pointer
there.

Thanks for your careful review.
