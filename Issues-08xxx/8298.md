The user has to run sage -b after installing GLPK or CBC because of recent modifications in the mip.pyx file.... As he may not be aware of it, Harald Schilly suggested a *** LARGE *** message, which will be printed after the package is installed.

On the way, I also updated the sources of glpk, as the most recent is the 4.42 while we were using 4.38

It can be downloaded on sage.math at :

~/ncohen/glpk-4.42.p0.spkg

* The package 4.38 will have to be removed when this one is made available *
