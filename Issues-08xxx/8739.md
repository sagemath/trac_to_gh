The Kolakoski words are important in combinatorics on words and there are many interesting conjectures that one would like to solve using Sage.

This ticket intends to add a constructor of such words.

By definition, the Kolakoski word is the infinite word `K = 22112122...` fixed under the `Delta` operator. The `Delta` of a word is simply the word describing its runs. For instance, if `w = 122112 = 1^1 2^2 1^2 2^1`, then `Delta(w) = 1221`. One can see that over the alphabet '{1,2}', the unique words fixed by `Delta` are `K` and `1K`. Moreover, this notion is naturally generalized to any alphabet `{a,b}` where `a` and `b` are two distinct positive integers.

Looks nice ! :-)

Several remarks though, that I do not dare implement myself :

* You specify in the private function `_KolakoskiWord_iterator` that the alphabet must be composed of two positive integers, but not in `KolakoskiWord`. Are the users supposed to know they should not use anything else ? (honest question, Words are not my field at all even if I can understand the construction :-) )

* You write `current_letter = bar(w[-1])`, thus accessing the -1'th element. What about writing `current_letter = bar(current_letter)` at the end of the loop ?

* You maintain a variable named `current_run`, and keep in memory a list of letters you already used (`w[:current_run]`). Wouldn't it be easier to forget about the current run variable, and just use your list as a queue with append() and pop(0) operations ? :-)

As I did not know the construction, I thought a bit about how I would write the algorithm and could not find any way to do it without keeping a lot of things in memory, what your `w` variable actually contains. Do you know if there exists a way to get rid of it ? I'm just being curious :-)

You're right, I forgot to document it in the main function.

Right again. I think I did it to avoid initializing `current_letter` in the basis, but this is less readable and we're not sure if `w[-1]` is performed in constant time. Is it ?

> * You maintain a variable named `current_run`, and keep in memory a list of letters you already used (`w[:current_run]`). Wouldn't it be easier to forget about the current run variable, and just use your list as a queue with append() and pop(0) operations ? :-)

I feel it would be hard, but I don't have any proof. On the other hand, I can get rid of all values of `w` that have already been read by the `current_run` cursor, as you mentionned above.

I couldn't tell you whether it is performed in constant time, but even if it is, from the point of view of complexity, I expect bar(your variable) to be faster than using a dictionnary's structure :-)

I'll ask google whether there is anything around about generating this word without needing an increasing amount of memory :-)

I just added a new patch which applies on the two precedent. All tests passed. Documentation builds fine. The Kolakoski word satisfies its definition for prefixes up to 100000.

To me it is a positive review. I let Alexandre change the status of the ticket to positive review if he agrees with my changes.

Maybe Nathann wants to take a look?

Hi,

since the Kolakoski sequence can also be seen as a sequence of integers, it appears in Sloane : http://oeis.org/A000002

Hence, it could be a good idea to integrate this in `sage/combinat/sloane_functions.py` and create the class A000002.
