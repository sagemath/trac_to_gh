The Kolakoski words are important in combinatorics on words and there are many interesting conjectures that one would like to solve using Sage.

This ticket intends to add a constructor of such words.

By definition, the Kolakoski word is the infinite word `K = 22112122...` fixed under the `Delta` operator. The `Delta` of a word is simply the word describing its runs. For instance, if `w = 122112 = 1^1 2^2 1^2 2^1`, then `Delta(w) = 1221`. One can see that over the alphabet '{1,2}', the unique words fixed by `Delta` are `K` and `1K`. Moreover, this notion is naturally generalized to any alphabet `{a,b}` where `a` and `b` are two distinct positive integers.

Looks nice ! :-)

Several remarks though, that I do not dare implement myself :

* You specify in the private function `_KolakoskiWord_iterator` that the alphabet must be composed of two positive integers, but not in `KolakoskiWord`. Are the users supposed to know they should not use anything else ? (honest question, Words are not my field at all even if I can understand the construction :-) )

* You write `current_letter = bar(w[-1])`, thus accessing the -1'th element. What about writing `current_letter = bar(current_letter)` at the end of the loop ?

* You maintain a variable named `current_run`, and keep in memory a list of letters you already used (`w[:current_run]`). Wouldn't it be easier to forget about the current run variable, and just use your list as a queue with append() and pop(0) operations ? :-)

As I did not know the construction, I thought a bit about how I would write the algorithm and could not find any way to do it without keeping a lot of things in memory, what your `w` variable actually contains. Do you know if there exists a way to get rid of it ? I'm just being curious :-)

I couldn't tell you whether it is performed in constant time, but even if it is, from the point of view of complexity, I expect bar(your variable) to be faster than using a dictionnary's structure :-)

I'll ask google whether there is anything around about generating this word without needing an increasing amount of memory :-)

I just added a new patch which applies on the two precedent. All tests passed. Documentation builds fine. The Kolakoski word satisfies its definition for prefixes up to 100000.

To me it is a positive review. I let Alexandre change the status of the ticket to positive review if he agrees with my changes.

Maybe Nathann wants to take a look?

Hi Sébastien and Nathann!

Thank you for the review. I agree with Sébastien's changes. I retested all of it on sage-4.6 and all tests still pass. I also took a look at the documentation, which builds fine and is clearer than before. I'll wait for Nathann to see if he agrees with both our modifications and if he's satisfied with my answers to his comments.

Hello !! 

Same result for me : all is nice on the doctest's side, and the documentation has no fault that I could spot `:-)`... Nothing to add for the code either, and so this patch is good to go `:-)`

Hi,

since the Kolakoski sequence can also be seen as a sequence of integers, it appears in Sloane : http://oeis.org/A000002

Hence, it could be a good idea to integrate this in `sage/combinat/sloane_functions.py` and create the class A000002.
