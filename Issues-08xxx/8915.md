The patch [trac8915.2.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8915/trac8915.2.patch) is the same as [trac8915.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8915/trac8915.patch), but with the ticket number and a commit message. Changes proposed by the reviewer patch:

* Explain the input wherever possible.
* Don't go over 79 characters per line wherever possible. This is in accordance with the style guide [PEP 008](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
* Cross reference functions wherever possible.
* Some typo fixes.
 
So only my patch needs review by anyone but me. If my reviewer patch is OK, then the whole ticket is good to go.
