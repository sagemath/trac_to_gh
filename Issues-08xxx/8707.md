latex(x) calls x._latex_() twice, and view(x) 5 times!!!

For small objects, that's fine, but when x is a graph, and latex'ing it requires calling graphviz, dot2tex, ... it is not reasonable!

```
sage: class blah():
....:     def _latex_(x):
....:         print "coucou"
....:         return "x"
....: 
sage: latex(blah())
coucou
coucou
x
sage: view(blah())
coucou
coucou
coucou
coucou
coucou
```

Analysis:
- latex makes use of has_latex_expr which makes a call to `_latex_` but discards the result

- latex_file does not reuse its calls to latex(x)

Now, e.g.

```
sage: g = sage.categories.category.category_graph()
sage: g.set_latex_options(format = "dot2tex")
sage: view(g, viewer="pdf", tightpage = True)
```
takes 6 seconds instead of .5 minutes, which makes it finally usable!
