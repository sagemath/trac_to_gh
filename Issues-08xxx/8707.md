latex(x) calls x._latex_() twice, and view(x) 5 times!!!

For small objects, that's fine, but when x is a graph, and latex'ing it requires calling graphviz, dot2tex, ... it is not reasonable!

```
sage: class blah():
....:     def _latex_(x):
....:         print "coucou"
....:         return "x"
....: 
sage: latex(blah())
coucou
coucou
x
sage: view(blah())
coucou
coucou
coucou
coucou
coucou
```

Analysis:
- latex makes use of has_latex_expr which makes a call to _latex_ but discards the result

- latex_file does not reuse its calls to latex(x)

Now, e.g.

```
sage: g = sage.categories.category.category_graph()
sage: g.set_latex_options(format = "dot2tex")
sage: view(g, viewer="pdf", tightpage = True)
```
takes 6 seconds instead of .5 minutes, which makes it finally usable!

Do we know for sure that types are the only sorts of objects which have this problem (that is, which seem to inherit a `_latex_` method according to hasattr, but which actually don't when you try to call it)?
