sage: QQ[x].categories()
[Category of commutative rings, Category of rings, ...]
```

This list should at least contain `EuclideanDomains()` and `GradedAlgebrasWithBasis(QQ)`. Maybe even `GradedHopfAlgebrasWithBasis(QQ)`.

At that occasion, the various accessors (term, ...) here and in ModulesWithBasis should be made consistent.

Partially, but polynomial rings are not yet considered to be graded (we already have this implemented because of the `degree` method).
