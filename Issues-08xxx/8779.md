sage: QQ[x].categories()
[Category of commutative rings, Category of rings, ...]
```

This list should at least contain `EuclideanDomains()` and `GradedAlgebrasWithBasis(QQ)`. Maybe even `GradedHopfAlgebrasWithBasis(QQ)`.

At that occasion, the various accessors (term, ...) here and in ModulesWithBasis should be made consistent.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

Partially, but polynomial rings are not yet considered to be graded (we already have this implemented because of the `degree` method).
