Mike, I will give this a try.  Unfortunately I have not been able to build 4.3.3 on my 64-bit machine (it builds but thousands of tests fail) so I'll be limited to testing on a 32-bit.

Can we try to collect from other tickets problems which have been attributed to bugs in the pari library, to see if this upgrade fixes them?  If so, there ought tobe appropriate doctests to prove it, and cross-referencing the other tickets, which might therefore be closed.

FWIW: I've just checked and it *does* build and run OK on Solaris, by the way.
