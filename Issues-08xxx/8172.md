This patch enables support for Cplex, when the new package #8171 for CBC is installed. It also includes several lines of documentation to explain how CPLEX can be used, and fixes a bad docstring which I noticed while testing this package :-)

Nathann does have access to 't2'. Minh has made it clear the last alpha (4.3.4.alpha1) builds ok on 't2', so testing this should be possible for Nathann.

The code from mip_cplex is a pure copy of mip_coin ( I only needed to change the types from OsiCbcSolverInterface to OsiCplexSolverInterface, etc .... )

This code has already been reviewed, by the way.....

Fixed ! Thank you :-)

<a id='comment:10'></a>What platforms has this been tested on? It needs to work on OS X, Linux and Solaris. It's not clear from reading this that anyone has actually checked it works on Solaris. 

There's general information about building on Solaris at

  http://wiki.sagemath.org/solaris

 Information specifically for 't2' at

  http://wiki.sagemath.org/devel/Building-Sage-on-the-T5240-t2

 Both the source (4.3.0.1 is the latest to build on Solaris) and a binary
 which will run on any SPARC can be found at http://www.sagemath.org
 /download-source.html

Since it is optional, I think this can go without it building on Solaris. But I would draw Nathann's attention to the developers guide, in particular:

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/inclusion.html?highlight=solaris

**Some Sage developers are willing to help you port to OS X, Solaris and Windows. But this is no guarantee and you or your project are expected to do the heavy lifting and also support those ports upstream if there is no Sage developer who is willing to share the burden.**

However, since this is not a standard package, then I think it can go. 

It was not clear to me on the #8171 whether that was intended to be experimental or optional. I believe the requirements for optional are more stringent than experimental, but I don't know exactly that they are. I believe Building on Solaris and OS X might be a requirement for optional, but are certainly not for experimental. I think that point needs clarification at some point in the future. 

I'm feel unable to review this, as it is outside my area, so if Micheal feels it deserves a positive review, then go ahead, but do not put my name on it. 

Note also the "Author" field is not completed.

<a id='comment:26'></a>Hello !!

As Martin mentionned it on #8171, the Cbc package is to be optional, exactly as it currently is. After all, #8171 is just an update. The .p2 is present precisely because it is an update. I hesitated before writing it, though, as the version of Cbc also changed. Do we increase the p# when the version of the source is fixed, and change it otherwise ? As the source changed (I updated it), do I need to "go back" to p0 ?

To be frank, I have in the end no idea of what exactly Solaris is. I know I can check it on the internet very quickly, and this is exactly what I intend to do, but in the end this is where my knowledge of it will stop. I have absolutely no idea how to deal with it...

Solaris is a Unix operating system. Unlike Linux, which is a Unix-like operating system, Solaris is officially classified as a POSIX compliant Unix operating system. It was created by Sun, who were recently bought by Oracle for $7 billion. Sage builds on Solaris 10 and soon will be an officially supported operating system, just as some linux distributions are. 

't2', which people refer to is a Sun T5240 machine with two SPARC processors. (The SPARC processor is similar to the Intel/AMD processors, though not identical). Each processor has 64-threads (128 in total). 

For any package to become a standard part of Sage, then it will need to build on Solaris 10 on SPARC. I'm unsure of the situation with optional packages. I don't mind helping if you have specific problems, but I am not going to do all the testing for you. 

When I checked the IBM web site, the library was available for Solaris.

OK, I figured it out:
here are the details:

[http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/dw/university/support/ILOGQuickStart.pdf](http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/dw/university/support/ILOGQuickStart.pdf)

First, one has to register here:
[https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/university/software/get_software.html](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/university/software/get_software.html)

and after somewhat tedious registration get to download a zip archive, that
contains tarballs of several Linux, MacOS, and Solaris binary installations.
Install the right tarball somewhere.

Licence can be requested here:
[https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/university/support/ilog.html](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/university/support/ilog.html)

you will get a file named access.ilm that you e.g. can place into /usr/ilog/ilm/
(or you can go for a custom location and an environment variable to hold it (see the quickstart pdf linked above)
