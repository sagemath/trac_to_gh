Adding parallel edges to a graph never changes the minimal genus.  I'm concerned that genus() might be entirely broken... but maybe it's just on multigraphs?  At the very least, removing parallel edges will speed things up and fix this bug.

Strangely, the code works correctly on the graph with 2 parallel edges, but the bug occurs on the graph with 3 parallel edges.

Regarding "line 231 -> probably a bitset way to do this faster", I agree, there probably is, but I'd rather not peek any further into the cgraph structure than necessary.
