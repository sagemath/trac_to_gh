I think I want, e.g., the following works in Sage notebook.

%latex

The example Sage notebook use the font AppleGothic which is perhaps only found in Mac OS.

This looks pretty good. I have some comments and it will need some minor changes, but already it seems to work!

For anyone else wanting to test this who's using Linux, you can replace the `latex.extra_preamble` with something like

```
latex.extra_preamble("\\"+r"usepackage{fontspec,xunicode,xltxtra}\setmainfont[Mapping=tex-text]{UnBatang}\setmonofont[Mapping=tex-text,Colour=0000AA]{UnDotum}")
```
In Linux, you should be able to do `fc-list :lang=ko` to get a list of fonts installed that support Korean; pick one and put that in and try this out. XeTeX is a standard part of TeXLive as of TL 2008, so it's not too hard to get.

I'll look over this patch and post my comments soon.

Hrm, this doesn't pass doctests. The first problem is that the "official" way to do deprecation is like this: for the `pdflatex` function (line 1188), you should do:

```
from sage.misc.misc import deprecation
deprecation('Use engine("pdflatex") instead.')
if t is None:
    return _Latex_prefs._option["engine"] == "pdflatex"
self.engine("pdflatex")
```
and then in the first doctest that uses the function:

```
sage: latex.pdflatex()
doctest:1: DeprecationWarning: Use engine("pdflatex") instead.
False
```
Also, I see that the `pdflatex` function never unsets the pdflatex engine -- I think we need

```
if t is None:
    return _Latex_prefs._option["engine"] == "pdflatex"
elif t:
    self.engine("pdflatex")
else:
    self.engine("latex")
```
so that `pdflatex(False)` does properly reset the engine.

Finally, in the `png` function (line 1749 or so), you need to change the pdflatex keyword to engine, and change the `_run_latex_` command on line 1795 or so.

Hmmm, it seems like the `view` command can call {{{png}} with the pdflatex keyword: see line 1721 or so (I've fiddled with latex.py, so my line numbers are a bit off):

```
png(objects, os.path.join(base_dir, png_file),
                debug=debug, do_in_background=False, pdflatex=pdflatex)
```
I think you'll need to move up the little snippet where you use the pdflatex keyword to decide what engine to use.

With these changes, doctests should pass.

I did write up a little bit of extra documentation; I'll post that patch in a moment. Could you look it over? It just adds a bit of explanation about adding to the preamble.

If I rebase his patch, will you do a quick review?

I looked at Dan's extra documentation. It is nice. But I deleted the last comment in the doc of "engine" because r"\usepackage..." only fails in the notebook. See the discussion in 

!http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_frm/thread/71cd8ec6313b7e16/da96b8c19ab45224#da96b8c19ab45224

See also the ticket 3154 at 

http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/3154

So I think the problem of "\u" in the raw string in notebook is only temporary, assuming the ticket 3154 is reviewed sooner or later.
