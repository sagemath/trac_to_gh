This patch adds a tutorial about Lie Methods and Related Combinatorics to Sage.

A copy of the html documentation built with dvipng may be found at:

http://match.stanford.edu/bump/thematic_tutorials/lie.html

or built with jsmath:

http://match.stanford.edu/bump/thematic_tutorials-js/lie.html

Note: only the second js version is up to date. I will update the other one later.

Apply:

1. [attachment: trac_8442-rebased-4.6.1.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8442/trac_8442-rebased-4.6.1.patch.gz)

4. [attachment: 8442_manifest.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8442/8442_manifest.patch.gz)

Then build the doc with

```
sage -docbuild thematic_tutorials html
```

add the `-j` flag to use jsmath.

1. Remove the use of ":math:". That is not necessary, as the Sage docbuilder can handle typeset mathematics without that syntax. Also, the resulting text is easier to read without heaps of ":math:" scattered throughout a ReST document.
2. Some stylistic clean-ups.
3. Make the formatting consistent.
4. Using the syntax ".. MATH::" to center math expressions.

Both Dan's rebased patch and my reviewer patch need reviewing. This ticket now depends on #8468.

Looks very good after the rebased patch and the reviewer's patch.

The three .png files must be in `doc/en/thematic_tutorials/static/` .

The patch will require minor revision if #8414 is not merged. (There
is also a dependence on #8411 but less important.) If this proves
necessary I will provide a revision. It is a matter of changing "space"
back to "lattice" in a few places.

I give a positive review to the rebased and reviewer's patch. I am not
changing the patch status since I am the author of the original patch.

I have uploaded the patch trac_8442-lie-rebased-to-4.4.2.alpha0.

This contains the three patches:

```
trac_8442-lie-rebased.patch 
trac_8442-reviewer.patch-reviewer patch
trac_8442-weyl_groups-revision.patch
```

The purpose of this patch is simply to address mjordan's comment that the patch does not apply cleanly. In order to accomplish a clean this the patch
adds files doc/en/thematic_tutorials/index.rst and bibliography.rst.
These files presume that three other thematic tutorials will also be included in sage - otherwise they will produce broken links. 

The release manager may prefer to work with the original three patches.

Note that in addition to the patch three .png files must be included.

This is a very impressive contribution to the documentation and will be a great example for the thematic section.  Applied #8464, the two patches, and the added the three PNG's.  Everything applied and built cleanly, once I caught the proper location for the three PNG files.

However, running doctests produced 22 errors across several of the files.  On 4.4.2.rc0

```
sage -t doc/en/thematic_tutorials/lie
```

yields

```
The following tests failed:


        sage -t  "devel/sage-main/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/lie/weyl_groups.rst"
        sage -t  "devel/sage-main/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/lie/weight_ring.rst"
        sage -t  "devel/sage-main/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/lie/crystals.rst"
        sage -t  "devel/sage-main/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/lie/weyl_character_ring.rst" # Exception from doctest framework
        sage -t  "devel/sage-main/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/lie/branching_rules.rst"
```

I did not investigate the source of the failures very carefully, Many of them were of the "name 'foo' not defined" variety rather than mis-matched outputs.  Hopefully this isn't a false alarm.

I'd be happy to give this another look after somebody investigates/fixes the doctests.

<div id="comment:18" align="right">comment:18</div>

In addition to the doctest failures, here are some other issues:

The documentation page that you get by clicking "help" in the notebook, then "fast static versions ...", does not look good with the new section on thematic tutorials: I don't think the three-column layout looks good.

The command `\mathfrak` is not recognized by jsMath, so if you make the documentation with the `--jsmath` flag, it has a lot of errors.

Also, I would suggest creating a directory `doc/en/thematic_tutorials/media/` (just like in the `reference` directory, and we put pictures there.   Wherever the pictures go, they need to be included in SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/MANIFEST.in so they get included in the Sage library spkg -- you need a line like

```
recursive-include doc/en/thematic_tutorials/media *
```

By the way, you can include the png files in the patch by using the command

```
$ hg add (path to file)/standard1.png
$ hg commit ...
$ hg export -g ...
```
(See [https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9074#comment:4](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9074#comment:4) for a similar explanation.)

I have added two revised patches:

```
trac_8442-lie-rebased-4.5.2.patch
trac_8442-png-files.patch
```

By mistake I added the first patch twice.

These address most of the problems found by rbeezer and jhpalmieri.

* Now passes `sage -t`

* New `doc/en/thematic_tutorials/media/*png`

* `doc/en/thematic_tutorials/*png` added to MANIFEST.in

* `.png` files are in a patch.

The one matter I did not try to address is the problem with jsMath. Is there a jsMath way to get fraktur fonts?

MathJAX is slated to replace jsMath.  It has been released, but I can't guess at how much work it will be to get it into the notebook.
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9774

It would appear from the discussion below that Fraktur fonts will be possible (maybe standard) then.
http://meta.mathoverflow.net/discussion/473/help-test-mathjax/

It seems Fraktur is available now for jsMath, but maybe we don't ship that with the notebook?
http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/download/extra-fonts/welcome.html

I'll look closer at reviewing this again when I've got a bit more time.

Regarding the --jsmath issue, the \mathfrak problem is not the end of the story. There are further problems.

Hi Dan,

I've had good luck with jsMath if I use \begin{tabular}\end{tabular} and then wrap individual entries with dollar signs.  Then the \hline's seem to workout OK.  The PDF doesn't really seem to suffer too much from this abuse.

I don't know if MathJAX or jsMath will ever be too happy about a \raisebox - the notion of a precise length doesn't always translate from printed page to web page very well.

Anyway, I didn't even look at your tableau, but you might experiment with a single one using the tabular environment and decide from there.

I have revised the patch. The resulting patch produces a tutorial that looks OK with both dvipng and jsmath. This addressed three problems.

(1) For \mathfrak, it includes trac_8442-mathfrak.patch (thanks!)

(2) The problems with matrices turned out to be only on a particular machine. On this machine, every browser I've tried (firefox, seamonkey and konqueror) makes jsmath matrices look very broken. But the same html looks OK on other machines.

(3) For the tableaux, I hand-made png images for all of these. I also did some other rewriting of the section on crystals.

-**Notes:** The current ticket needs to be coordinated with #8470.
-
-A copy of the html documentation may be found at:
-
-http://sporadic.stanford.edu/bump/trac_8442/
-
-There are three patches to merge:
-
-```
- trac_8442-lie-rebased.patch
- trac_8442-reviewer.patch
- trac_8442-weyl_groups-revision.patch
-```
-
-The patches do not apply to sage-4.4.2.alpha0 because two files 
-in doc/en/thematic_tutorials are missing: index.rst and bibliography.rst.
-An alternative patch
-
-```
-trac_8442-lie-rebased-to-4.4.2.alpha0
-```
-
-includes these files, and applies cleanly to sage-4.4.2.alpha0. Otherwise it is
-identical to the union of the three patches.
-
-In addition, the three .png files must be where they get properly linked.

This looks like an amazing document to include with Sage.  Thanks for working on it.

First, all doctests pass for me.

I get three warnings when building the docs, two of which anyone can fix:

```
/Applications/sage/devel/sage/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/lie/weyl_character_ring.rst:397: (WARNING/2) Title underline too short.

Integration
-------
/Applications/sage/devel/sage/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/lie/weyl_character_ring.rst:397: (WARNING/2) Title underline too short.

Integration
-------
```
The third one I think Dan has to do:

```
/Applications/sage/devel/sage/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/lie/weyl_groups.rst:: WARNING: citation not found: BumpNakasuji2010
```

A few questions and comments about the text: first, the style in the Sage documentation is to use `\Bold{C`} for the complex numbers, and similarly for R and Q.  This is more of an issue for docstrings for methods, functions, etc., but you might consider changing it.

In introduction.rst, 

```
For example, we could take `G = SU(n)`,
`\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{sl}(n, \mathbb{R})`,
`\mathfrak{g}_{\mathbb{C}} = \mathfrak{sl}(n, \mathbb{C})` and
`G = SL(n, \mathbb{C})`.
```
Should the last "G" be "G_{\mathbb{C}}" (or "G_{\Bold{C}}")?

In lie_basics.rst, on line 141: `However Parabolic subgroups do not exist for compact Lie groups.`  Don't capitalize "Parabolic".

On line 150: 

```
Such a type is implemented in Sage as a pair ``[`X`,r]``
```  
I would use plain quotes around the X, not backquotes: <code>\`\`['X',r]\`\`</code>

A few lines later:

```
The exceptional types are::

    ['G',2],  ['F',4],  ['E',6], ['E',7] or ['E',8].
```
The indented block is verbatim text, so spacing matters.  The inconsistency between double-spacing and single-spacing looks odd to me, and I would just put single spaces after all of the commas.

weyl_character_ring.rst, line 239, <code>with Cartan type \`['B',r]\`</code>: I would use double back quotes here instead of single ones.

> One is about a way to connecting Lie functionality in GAP to the one in Sage. Anything on this?

One issue with GAP on Sage is that the interface needs a lot of work. There is a lot of power in GAP that can't be accessed from Sage because of this.

The Lie theory in Sage is mostly written from scratch. But here is an example where GAP is
involved in the background. We have a class for WeylGroups in weyl_group.py. This
class inherits from MatrixGroup_gens which in turn inherits from MatrixGroup_gap. So
GAP is involved in Weyl Groups.

In particular, lie can compute decompositions of, say, a tensor product of two representations into irreducibles. It's not clear to me whether one can do this in Sage (without lie).

I am not sure whether everything that is doable with LiE is doable with Sage but I do think that anything that is needed from LiE is either in Sage already or (if needed) should be reimplemented. What is in Sage is a pretty complete toolkit for finite-dimensional representations of Lie groups. Decomposing a tensor product into irreducibles is just the multiplication in the WeylCharacterRing.

One particular thing I was able to do using Lie was to compute things in classical invariant theory, such as the dimension of the space of invariants of degree k
of the m-ary form of degree d (for fixed k,m,d). Basically, that meant computing certain symmetric power of certain representation of GL_m (or SL_m), and finding out whether there was a 1-dimensional sub-representation.

Is this doable in Sage?
Thanks!

> Basically, that meant computing certain symmetric power of certain representation of GL_m (or SL_m), and finding out whether there was a 1-dimensional sub-representation. 

For symmetric (or exterior) square you can use the frobenius_schur_indicator method. For higher symmetric powers, here is a way. Suppose we want to compute the symmetric 5-th power of the 8-dimensional adjoint representation of SL(3). The relevant groups are SL(3) and SL(8), so we need Weyl Character rings A2 and A7.

```
sage: A2=WeylCharacterRing("A2",style="coroots")
sage: A7=WeylCharacterRing("A7",style="coroots",cache="true")
sage: s = A7.fundamental_weights()[1]
sage: A7(5*s)
A7(5,0,0,0,0,0,0)
sage: A7(5*s)
A7(5,0,0,0,0,0,0)
sage: A7(5*s).degree()
792
```

This is the symmetric 5-th power of the standard representation of SL(8), which we want to branch down to SL(3) along the adjoint representation, which is a homomorphism SL(3) --> SL(8). So we create the adjoint representation, then branch the symmetric 5-th power representation of SL(8) down to SL(3).

```
sage: ad=A2(1,1); ad.degree()
8
sage: A7(5*s).branch(A2,rule=branching_rule_from_plethysm(ad,"A7"))
A2(0,0) + 2*A2(1,1) + A2(0,3) + A2(3,0) + 2*A2(2,2) + A2(1,4) + A2(4,1) + 2*A2(3,3) + A2(2,5) + A2(5,2) + A2(4,4) + A2(5,5)
```

There is your decomposition into irreducibles. You can see that there is a copy of the trivial representation.

I just noticed that the trac_8442-png-files containing the .png files is not
the right patch!

The files are in the wrong directory (should be doc/en/thematic_tutorials/media)
and some of the images are missing. I am puzzled as to how this happened since
everything was built and tested.

I am changing the status back to needs_work until I can fix this.

> Setting milestone to sage-feature because of #8470.

At some point Minh Nguyen added the words "needs to be coordinated with #8470" to the description. However #8470 has not been touched for 8 months. It appears to me that #8470 is an orphaned ticket.

I propose that the milestone for this patch should be changed back to 4.6.2.

I second this. #8470 is a meta-ticket meant for coordinating documentation. Closing the current ticket is a prereq to closing it. So, please close the current ticket, which in no ways depends on #8470.
