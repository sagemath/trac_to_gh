It would have been nice to have had some description of what the patch contains!

I am happy with the main part: applies fine to 4.3.4.alpha1, and all tests in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves pass.

But I am puzzled about the need for your small_rank_curves function:  we already have cremona_curves() and cremona_optimal_curves(), as defined in ell_rational_field but using an iterator defined in sage/databases/cremona.  Would it not be more sensible to add an option to that (specifically, to iter_optimal(), list_optimal()) which gives optional filtering data such as a list of ranks?  (Other posibilities, in addition:  list of possible torsion, etc).

If you can justify this function's existence, then it should go in another place, probably in ell_rational_field just after cremona_optimal_curves.

But for that I would give this a positive review!

That was entirely for my own convenience in doing my research. I didn't want to have to keep typing so much, so I made a short name for it... I can pull that out of the patch and just keep it on my local queue if you'd prefer.

I guessed that.  If you agree that it would be good to have options to the existing database iterators, we could open up a new ticket for that.

Now I should really test the new patch, just in case...
