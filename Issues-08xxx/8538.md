As reported before (#8522) Open MPI fails to build on Solaris. The version is old, so I opened a ticket for an update to Open MPI (#8537). William indicated that mpi4py depends on Open MPI, so I might as well update mpi4py too.

After updating openmpi (see #8537) mpi4py has to be updated.
The the spkg for the latest stable releas (v. 1.2.2) can be found under: http://code.google.com/p/spkg-upload/downloads/detail?name=mpi4py-1.2.2.spkg
There were no troubles with installation on linux ubuntu 10.04

Have Fun!
