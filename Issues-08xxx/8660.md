A German translation of the Sage installation guide is complete. See [sage-support](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/cc2232f6cba3386f) for background information. What needs to be done now is to use Sphinx for the markup so that the translated guide could be included in the Sage standard documentation. Attached is the ODF version of the German translation.

It's very likely that #8698 would be merged first, prior to merging the current ticket. In that case, the patch on this ticket would need to be rebased against #8698.

Sorry to say, but this translation **really** needs (more) work.

There are still lots of typos, inconsistently chosen terms and style, and some errors regarding the content (some information seems not to be up-to-date in the original either, haven't checked that yet). IMHO the translation is too much one-to-one in many places. (I would also add some things, perhaps leaving out other issues, since German documentation is rare if not non-existent anyway.)

The question is which format to edit: convert to ReST and rework that version or change the ODT source?

Bernhard, were you willing to edit/review/maintain a ReST version?

I'd personally prefer typesetting it in LaTeX... ;-)
(and perhaps restructuring the text *before* it gets converted to .rst)

Unfortunately I currently don't feel having the time to maintain the "whole thing", otherwise I would some time ago have started providing a few translated documents. And -- I'm unfortunately *not* a mathematician; so I can only offer sporadic and limited help, not continuous collaboration, at least at the moment.

Pardon me,
hope my first impression doesn't embarrass you too much,
and nevertheless thanks for your initiative,

-Leif

ok, i looked at the rest text and yes, i could proofread it, but i think first of all we have to settle what kind of translation we want. there are some german words i'm not happy with. they sound very artificial and it is from my point of view absolutely ok to keep english words (or near-english words) because more users will know what they mean than a "forced" translation that just sounds funny.

my background is that i did english to german translations for openoffice many years ago and there we had the same problems. i also know that others view that differently, especially from upper and eastern germany. so, we should settle this first.

First of all, could we *please* change its title to a *German* term, which is e.g. *Installationsanleitung*...

There are other flaws like *Polynomiale* instead of *Polynome*, the meaning of (symbolic) links is "inverted", and much more I don't remember at the moment.

I strongly suggest splitting off a ticket to discuss the contents (or style) *in German*.

Can someone please tell me what commands are needed to produce the German documentation (in html or pdf), so that I can do some proof reading?

And how should corrections be suggested/made? Should one state one's suggestions here in trac comments, so that Bernhard can take them into account? Should one post a patch that builds on top of the original patch? Or should one create a "big" patch that could replace the original patch?

Cheers,
Simon

Apply the patch [trac_8660-installation-de.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8660/trac_8660-installation-de.patch.gz), then issue the following command to build the HTML version:

```
./sage -docbuild de/installation html
```

Or do the following to get the PDF version:

```
./sage -docbuild de/installation pdf
```

Yes, something like that. In that case, you would be posting a reviewer patch.

I agree. I read introduction.rst (which describes the components of Sage) and found several mathematical notions that are different in German. Just two examples: 
* "toric varieties" are not "Torus-Varianten" but "torische Varietäten".
* "ghmm: Modellbibliothek für versteckte Markov-Prozesse": ghmm is in fact a library that is concerned with hidden Markov models (so, the word "model" refers to Markov and not to the library). 

I hope that Monday I can provide a patch on top of trac_8660-installation-de.patch.

Best regards,
Simon

Earlier than I thought, I can provide a reviewer patch trac_8660-installation-de_reviewer.patch, which is to be applied after trac_8660-installation-de.patch

The changes also concern the parts that are the topic of ticket #8698, so, perhaps the two tickets can be united?

I inserted a lot more back ticks for marking code snippets, as in the English text. I slightly updated some version numbers (for example when the Singular or Gap consoles are demonstrated: Singular is now version 3-1-0, not 3-0-1). And I changed several notions to what I believe is correct in German. However, I am not sure in all cases. 

So, I feel it would be necessary for more native speakers to have a look on it!

Where should my name be inserted: Author(s)? Reviewer(s)?

Some general questions, that also regard the English text: What is the status of Sage on Mac OS-X? I recently had no problems to build Sage in either 32 or 64 bit mode on bsd.math, so, perhaps the problem reports are outdated? And what about gcc versions?

Best regards,

Simon

Habe den Patch lediglich ueberflogen, sieht aber schon ganz gut aus.

Einige Ungereimtheiten und Fehler sind allerdings noch drin, und wie Harald (schilly) bemerkte, sollte man vielleicht die Uebersetzung einiger Begriffe abklaeren.

Also das PDF ist zum K...: 38 Seiten für eine "kurze Anleitung für die Erstinstallation".

Sollte vielleicht erst sammeln, aber hier ist schon mal das Komma falsch gesetzt:

  *Bestimmen Sie den Typ Ihrer CPU (32-bit, 64-bit oder “atom” für Linux und Intel, oder PowerPC für Mac OS X).*

Die Beschreibung ist ohnehin etwas unsinnig, da für die Wahl zwischen 32-Bit- und 64-Bit-Version *das Betriebssystem* und nicht die vorliegende CPU maßgeblich ist.

Naja das Problem ist vorallem auch die Formatierung. "kurz" zu streichen wäre schon sinnvoll.

Man könnte auch die Reihenfolge ändern, sodass die wichtigen Punkte (baumfreundlich ausdruckbar) am Anfang stehen. Die Paketliste könnte man beispielsweise in einen Anhang verfrachten.

Denke aber eher, eine zusätzliche, *wirklich kurze* Installationsanleitung (1 bis 2 DIN-A4-Seiten) zum Ausdrucken wäre praktischer. Auf besonderen, für den 08/15-Benutzer eher irrelevanten Kram könnte man dort einfach verweisen.

"mergen sollen" - schon wieder so was eingedeutscht... Ist "Installationsführer" denn so viel schlimmer als Airport BER/FRA/...? ;-)

#9725 ist auch längst "eingemergt", falls man es so formulieren kann...

Ich habe die "patches" "rebasiert", d.h. die zwei überflüssigen Zeilen entfernt.   Volkers Kommentar betrachte ich als Erlaubnis, "positive review" zu "clicken".  Ich sehe keine schlimme Formatierung in die "gebaute" Dokumentation.
