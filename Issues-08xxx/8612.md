I was browsing the code in matrix/misc.pyx, and noticed:

```
These lines are in misc.pyx:

        if not proof:
            verbose("Not checking validity of result (since proof=False).", level=2, caller_name="multimod echelon")
            break
        d   = E.denominator()
        hdE = long(E.height())
        if True or hdE * self.ncols() * height < prod:
            break
        M = prod * p*p*p

```

Notice the "if True" -- that disables proof checking no matter what!!  This must be removed.  This could get hit in rare cased by, e.g., the modular symbols code, and it would lead to weird inconsistencies later on.... which is something we've seen on big examples.

I'm guessing this was the result of disabling proof checking while developing the code, then never switching it back.

In 

```
d   = E.denominator()
hdE = long(E.height())
if True or hdE * self.ncols() * height < prod:
    break
```

does  d  need to multiply  E.height()  at some point in the computation of hdE?  

It seems so in the algorithm as outlined in step (5) in the docstring.  And if not, does  d  then not need to be computed?  Hopefully, there's something mildly amiss here, but I've not studied the whole routine carefully.

Yes, you're right, it needs to be 

```
hdE = long((d*E).height())
```

The algorithm is described with proof here: http://wstein.org/books/modform/modform/linear_algebra.html#echelon-forms-over

I've posted a part2 patch that fixes the issue you've pointed out.

OK, looks good then.  Wasn't sure just where to stuff the d.  ;-)

I'm going to run tests, but it may be morning before I have a report.
