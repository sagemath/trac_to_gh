**Attachment:** [8814-ec-group-speedup.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8814/8814-ec-group-speedup.patch.gz)

Before: 

```
sage: F.<a>=GF(101^3,'a')
sage: timeit("EllipticCurve([2*a^2 + 48*a + 27, 89*a^2 + 76*a + 24]).abelian_group()")
5 loops, best of 3: 1.37 s per loop
sage: timeit("EllipticCurve(GF(1009), [2, 1]).abelian_group()")
25 loops, best of 3: 21.1 ms per loop
```

After:

```
sage: F.<a>=GF(101^3,'a')
sage: timeit("EllipticCurve([2*a^2 + 48*a + 27, 89*a^2 + 76*a + 24]).abelian_group()")
5 loops, best of 3: 1.28 s per loop
sage: timeit("EllipticCurve(GF(1009), [2, 1]).abelian_group()")
5 loops, best of 3: 15.2 ms per loop
```

Of course, this is just low hanging fruit (I've gotten 40x or more speedup in EC point arithmetic alone via Cython) but every little bit helps.
