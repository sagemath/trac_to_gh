I just attached a patch which implements a "sage_wraps" decorator which mirrors the functools wraps decorator, but also adds the sage-specific `_sage_src_` attribute, so that `interacts.demo??` works.

This is still "needs work", since the sage_wraps function needs some doctests.

We can now simplify the code in sage/plot/misc.py and a few other places that call the `@`wraps decorator using `@`sage_wraps.

REVIEW:

* very nice using the python wrapping stuff, and making source code introspection work, in theory!

* In practice, source code introspection does not work, though this is due to a lazy assumption *I* made I think when implementing interact in the notebook, namely I think when the notebook server sees "@interact" in the output, it does something funny with formatting.  Anyway, if you try:

```
interacts.calculus.taylor_polynomial??
```
in a cell then shift-enter, you'll see the source is all on one long line, which isn't good.  That said, fixing this shouldn't be part of this patch, since it's a very different issue in the sage notebook itself, and maybe quite tricky to deal with.

* Important. Try this in an input cell:

```
interacts.calculus.[tab]
```
Instead of getting *one* thing, you get 15.  This *has* to be fixed. 

* Otherwise, I'm happy with this patch.

Ah, that makes sense.  I saw this, and even started writing a ticket for it, but I couldn't reproduce it with anything besides the interact stuff (see my comment above about ReST formatting), and then I ran out of time.

I'm attaching a new patch which takes care of the namespace issue you mentioned.  Basically, I lump everything into a library file, and then just import into calculus.py the actual interact. I'm sure there's a fancy object we could make that would nicely categorize everything, but this quick solution takes advantage of the nice namespace framework we already have.

Yes.  It's just some internal counter.   That's a stupid doctest though, since an unrelated change anywhere else in Sage could break it.  Can you change the output to
