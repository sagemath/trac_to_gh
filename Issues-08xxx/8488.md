<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

I just attached a patch which implements a "sage_wraps" decorator which mirrors the functools wraps decorator, but also adds the sage-specific `_sage_src_` attribute, so that `interacts.demo??` works.

This is still "needs work", since the sage_wraps function needs some doctests.

We can now simplify the code in sage/plot/misc.py and a few other places that call the `@`wraps decorator using `@`sage_wraps.

REVIEW:

* very nice using the python wrapping stuff, and making source code introspection work, in theory!

* In practice, source code introspection does not work, though this is due to a lazy assumption *I* made I think when implementing interact in the notebook, namely I think when the notebook server sees "@interact" in the output, it does something funny with formatting.  Anyway, if you try:

```
interacts.calculus.taylor_polynomial??
```
in a cell then shift-enter, you'll see the source is all on one long line, which isn't good.  That said, fixing this shouldn't be part of this patch, since it's a very different issue in the sage notebook itself, and maybe quite tricky to deal with.

* Important. Try this in an input cell:

```
interacts.calculus.[tab]
```
Instead of getting *one* thing, you get 15.  This *has* to be fixed. 

* Otherwise, I'm happy with this patch.

I'm attaching a new patch which takes care of the namespace issue you mentioned.  Basically, I lump everything into a library file, and then just import into calculus.py the actual interact. I'm sure there's a fancy object we could make that would nicely categorize everything, but this quick solution takes advantage of the nice namespace framework we already have.

When I apply this, I get a new doctest failure:

```
**********************************************************************
File "/Applications/sage_builds/sage-4.4.alpha0/devel/sage-new/sage/symbolic/ring.pyx", line 443:
    sage: SR.symbol() # temporary variable
Expected:
    symbol160
Got:
    symbol162
**********************************************************************
```
I don't know why these patches cause this file to file.  Can we just change "160" to "162"?

Yes.  It's just some internal counter.   That's a stupid doctest though, since an unrelated change anywhere else in Sage could break it.  Can you change the output to
