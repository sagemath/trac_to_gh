<a id='comment:5'></a>I just attached a patch which implements a "sage_wraps" decorator which mirrors the functools wraps decorator, but also adds the sage-specific _sage_src_ attribute, so that `interacts.demo??` works.

This is still "needs work", since the sage_wraps function needs some doctests.

We can now simplify the code in sage/plot/misc.py and a few other places that call the `@`wraps decorator using `@`sage_wraps.

* very nice using the python wrapping stuff, and making source code introspection work, in theory!

* In practice, source code introspection does not work, though this is due to a lazy assumption *I* made I think when implementing interact in the notebook, namely I think when the notebook server sees "`@`interact" in the output, it does something funny with formatting.  Anyway, if you try:

```

* Important. Try this in an input cell:

```
interacts.calculus.[tab]
```
Instead of getting *one* thing, you get 15.  This *has* to be fixed. 

* Otherwise, I'm happy with this patch.

I'm attaching a new patch which takes care of the namespace issue you mentioned.  Basically, I lump everything into a library file, and then just import into calculus.py the actual interact. I'm sure there's a fancy object we could make that would nicely categorize everything, but this quick solution takes advantage of the nice namespace framework we already have.
