A comment by e-mail from Nicolas Borie:

> 1. Est-ce qu'on change ce comportement ?


Trans: Should we change this behavior

```
> sage: SymmetricGroup(-12)
> Symmetric group of order 0! as a permutation group
```

> 2. Ce serait bien de changer ce message d'erreur :


Trans: This error message is wrong:

```
> sage: SymmetricGroup('bla')
>[...]
> ValueError: n (=bla) must be an integer >= 1 or a list (but n has type
> <type 'str'>)
```

> --> n must be an integer >= 0 now !!!
