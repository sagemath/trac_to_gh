I have attached a reviewer patch that includes the following changes:

* Some stylistic clean-ups.
* Get rid of trailing white spaces.
* Put in some headings to make the organization of the module clear when you're skimming the reference manual.
* Some cross-referencing within the Sage library.

John's patch is OK by me. If my reviewer patch is OK, then the whole ticket gets a positive review.
