One can use the `digits()` method to go from an integer to a list of digits, but it would be nice if the docstring explained how to do the inverse:

```
ZZ(x.digits(base), base)
```
Also, the ZZ() docstring doesn't seem to mention that this is a way to create an integer, so we should add some documentation there, too.

Also, there's an obvious doctest that should be added, to make sure that these functions are inverses; something like:

```
x = some integer
x == ZZ(x.digits())
x == ZZ(x.digits(base=13), 13)
```

I took the liberty of fixing up some of the ReST formatting, and also removed a comment that says "s = 2003^100300000" crashes Sage, because it doesn't anymore. (On my machine, at any rate.)
