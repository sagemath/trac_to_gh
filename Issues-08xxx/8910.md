**Attachment:** [trac_8910-combinatorial_class_parent-fh.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8910/trac_8910-combinatorial_class_parent-fh.patch.gz)

The patch has been reviewed by Nicolas on the patch queue. I folded the review patches:

```
$ hg qgoto trac_8910-subsets_an_element-fh.patch
$ hg qfold trac_8910-subsets_an_element-review-nt.patch
$ hg qfold trac_8910-subsets_an_element-review-review-fh.patch
```
And Nicolas said by e-mail

```
> Dès que j'ai ton feu vert, je folde tout, et met la positive review sur trac.

Feu vert!
```
Meaning: (FH) as soon as I have your green light I fold the whole bunch, and set positive review on trac. (Answer from Nicolas) Green Light.

Therefore I allowed myself to put the positive review.
