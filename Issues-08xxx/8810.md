#8810: Implementation of Stanley symmetric functions for types A,B and A/B/C/D affine

Depends on #8811.

Based on the combinatorics of Pieri factors (sage/combinat/root_systems/pieri_factors.py)

Currently, there are two implementations of the maximal Pieri factors:
a combinatorial implementation and a type-free implementation using translations in the affine Weyl group.  Type D affine Stanley symmetric functions are still conjectural, but type D affine Pieri factors have been established rigorously.

<a id='comment:8'></a>Hi Steve!

I pushed a reviewers patch on the Sage-Combinat server. It fixes a bug
or two, improves doctests, removes some unneeded imports, and removes
some unneeded code. By the way, I have rebased the Grothendieck patch.

There are still quite a few missing doctests:

```
> sage -coverage combinat/root_system/pieri_factors.py                          
----------------------------------------------------------------------
combinat/root_system/pieri_factors.py
SCORE combinat/root_system/pieri_factors.py: 77% (28 of 36)
Missing documentation:
	 * elements(self):
	 * __classcall__(cls, W, min_length = 0, max_length = infinity, min_support = frozenset([]), max_support = None):
	 * maximal_elements_combinatorial(self):
Missing doctests:
	 * __iter__(self):
	 * __iter__(self):
	 * stanley_symm_poly_weight(self,w):
	 * maximal_elements_combinatorial(self):
	 * stanley_symm_poly_weight(self, w):
```

Please fix them, and look for TODO's in the file!

See `hg qfold`, in the patch server documentation.

I have just added a new reviewer's patch, fixing the lack of tests for `__classcall__`, and a couple other small issues. Please review, fold, and reupload here. With that, this patch is good to go from a technical view point. I am now running all tests.

Anne: do you think we need further review from the mathematical view point? If yes, do you have suggestions for a reviewer?
