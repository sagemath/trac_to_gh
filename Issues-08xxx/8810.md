#8810: Implementation of Stanley symmetric functions for types A,B and A/B/C/D affine

Depends on #8811.

Based on the combinatorics of Pieri factors (sage/combinat/root_systems/pieri_factors.py)

Currently, there are two implementations of the maximal Pieri factors:
a combinatorial implementation and a type-free implementation using translations in the affine Weyl group.  Type D affine Stanley symmetric functions are still conjectural, but type D affine Pieri factors have been established rigorously.

I'm just starting this review, and I will probably have more to say, but here some initial issues.  In the file weyl_groups.py:
* The methods `exp_poly_to_sym`, `pieri_factors`, and `is_pieri_factor` are missing doctests.
* Do you think `exp_poly_to_sym` has general use?  If so, it should probably be placed in the symmetric function code somewhere.  If not, it should probably be made private (eg. `_exp_poly_to_sym`)
* In `exp_poly_to_sym`, you should replace
` R._from_dict(dict( ... ) `
with
` R.sum_of_terms( ... ) `
* In the doc for `pieri_factors`:  "Those are used.." should be "These are used..", "For any types" should be "For any type"
* In each of the methods `pieri_factors`, `is_pieri_factor`, and `left_pieri_factorizations` a reference in the doc to the 'pieri_factors.py` file (where pieri factors are described in more detail) would be nice.
* Some reference to a definition of a Stanley symmetric function should be given in the doc to the `stanley_symmetric_..` methods.
* The latex in the doc for `left_pieri_factoriztions` is not properly marked up.
* In the doc for `stanley_symmetric_function_as_polynomial`, I don't understand the phrase "The results is given in the ring of symmetric functions in the elementary basis, each factorization having weight prod_i x_i". Can you explain this more fully?

There is a lot of really cool new functionality here.  I'm looking forward to it getting in to sage.  I'll try to finish this review soon.

```
    sage: W = WeylGroup(['B',3,1])

The coefficients should be in QQ, I think.  Probably you can replace

Hi Steve!

I pushed a reviewers patch on the Sage-Combinat server. It fixes a bug
or two, improves doctests, removes some unneeded imports, and removes
some unneeded code. By the way, I have rebased the Grothendieck patch.

There are still quite a few missing doctests:

```
> sage -coverage combinat/root_system/pieri_factors.py                          
----------------------------------------------------------------------
combinat/root_system/pieri_factors.py
SCORE combinat/root_system/pieri_factors.py: 77% (28 of 36)
Missing documentation:
	 * elements(self):
	 * __classcall__(cls, W, min_length = 0, max_length = infinity, min_support = frozenset([]), max_support = None):
	 * maximal_elements_combinatorial(self):
Missing doctests:
	 * __iter__(self):
	 * __iter__(self):
	 * stanley_symm_poly_weight(self,w):
	 * maximal_elements_combinatorial(self):
	 * stanley_symm_poly_weight(self, w):
```

Please fix them, and look for TODO's in the file!

See `hg qfold`, in the patch server documentation.

I have just added a new reviewer's patch, fixing the lack of tests for `__classcall__`, and a couple other small issues. Please review, fold, and reupload here. With that, this patch is good to go from a technical view point. I am now running all tests.

Anne: do you think we need further review from the mathematical view point? If yes, do you have suggestions for a reviewer?
