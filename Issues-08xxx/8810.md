#8810: Implementation of Stanley symmetric functions for types A,B and A/B/C/D affine

Depends on #8811.

Based on the combinatorics of Pieri factors (sage/combinat/root_systems/pieri_factors.py)

Currently, there are two implementations of the maximal Pieri factors:
a combinatorial implementation and a type-free implementation using translations in the affine Weyl group.  Type D affine Stanley symmetric functions are still conjectural, but type D affine Pieri factors have been established rigorously.

I'm just starting this review, and I will probably have more to say, but here some initial issues.  In the file weyl_groups.py:
* The methods `exp_poly_to_sym`, `pieri_factors`, and `is_pieri_factor` are missing doctests.
* Do you think `exp_poly_to_sym` has general use?  If so, it should probably be placed in the symmetric function code somewhere.  If not, it should probably be made private (eg. `_exp_poly_to_sym`)
* In `exp_poly_to_sym`, you should replace
` R._from_dict(dict( ... ) `
with
` R.sum_of_terms( ... ) `
* In the doc for `pieri_factors`:  "Those are used.." should be "These are used..", "For any types" should be "For any type"
* In each of the methods `pieri_factors`, `is_pieri_factor`, and `left_pieri_factorizations` a reference in the doc to the 'pieri_factors.py` file (where pieri factors are described in more detail) would be nice.
* Some reference to a definition of a Stanley symmetric function should be given in the doc to the `stanley_symmetric_..` methods.
* The latex in the doc for `left_pieri_factoriztions` is not properly marked up.
* In the doc for `stanley_symmetric_function_as_polynomial`, I don't understand the phrase "The results is given in the ring of symmetric functions in the elementary basis, each factorization having weight prod_i x_i". Can you explain this more fully?

There is a lot of really cool new functionality here.  I'm looking forward to it getting in to sage.  I'll try to finish this review soon.

Hi Steve!

I pushed a reviewers patch on the Sage-Combinat server. It fixes a bug
or two, improves doctests, removes some unneeded imports, and removes
some unneeded code. By the way, I have rebased the Grothendieck patch.

There are still quite a few missing doctests:

```
> sage -coverage combinat/root_system/pieri_factors.py                          
----------------------------------------------------------------------
combinat/root_system/pieri_factors.py
SCORE combinat/root_system/pieri_factors.py: 77% (28 of 36)
Missing documentation:
	 * elements(self):
	 * __classcall__(cls, W, min_length = 0, max_length = infinity, min_support = frozenset([]), max_support = None):
	 * maximal_elements_combinatorial(self):
Missing doctests:
	 * __iter__(self):
	 * __iter__(self):
	 * stanley_symm_poly_weight(self,w):
	 * maximal_elements_combinatorial(self):
	 * stanley_symm_poly_weight(self, w):
```

Please fix them, and look for TODO's in the file!

> Thanks Nicolas!
> 
> I was not sure how one usually goes about incorporating modifications from a reviewer's patch, so I hope what I did was alright.  I incorporated your changes into my patch, added documentation and fixed the TODO's, and then disabled your reviewer patch in the combinat queue.  The latest patch is now in the combinat queue and on the trac server.

See `hg qfold`, in the patch server documentation.

I have just added a new reviewer's patch, fixing the lack of tests for `__classcall__`, and a couple other small issues. Please review, fold, and reupload here. With that, this patch is good to go from a technical view point. I am now running all tests.

Anne: do you think we need further review from the mathematical view point? If yes, do you have suggestions for a reviewer?
