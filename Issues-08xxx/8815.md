Patch applies to 4.4;  tests pass (I checked all sage/schemes/elliptic_curves).

In the first file patched, was there a reason for not changing the TypeError in lines 1093/4 to another ValueError?

In the second:  there are essentially identical blocks of code in lines 1052-1068 and 1360-1376.  But the typo (s to z) was only fixed in one place.  So the other needs fixing too.

In the "logic simplification" bit of the patch -- this is not correct now!  If z's parent is (say) QQ then after the patch, z will have been coerced into CC but C will be set to QQ.  So this now fails:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('14a1')
sage: L = E.period_lattice()
sage: L.coordinates(1)
```

Finally, your description is a little unkind!  I spent a long time trying this out -- though I do admit, of course, that I clearly did not test every line.  Perhaps we need to add some more doctests?

I used to be one of the tab culprits but I have now properly configured emacs on all the machines I use not to use them!

Well, I feel it's my duty to do so...

I am looking at the new patch now.

New patch fixes the issues I had with the first patch, applies fine to 4.4 and all tests in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves pass.

Positive review:  apply second patch only.
