The documentation of `UniqueRepresentation` says 

```
    Similarly, the identity is used as hash function, which is also as
    fast as it can get. However this means that the hash function may
    change in between Sage sessions, or even within the same Sage
    session (see below). Subclasses should overload :meth:`__hash__`
    if this could be a problem.
```
But there is no implementation of `__hash__`.

I'm adding one.

Hi Paul,

Replying to [@zimmermann6](#comment%3A3):
> I'd like to review that patch but I'm missing an example to try.

I'm not sure what you want: in the patch you have the following tests example:

```
sage: class bla(UniqueRepresentation, SageObject): pass 
sage: x = bla(); hx = hash(x) 
sage: x.rename("toto")    
sage: hx == hash(x) 
True 
```
If you want more elaborated examples using `UniqueRepresentation`, they are dozens of them through sage library (the ultimate goal is that nearly each parent inherits from this). Pick you favorite one (prime.py is a good example see #7397):

Just one thing Florent: please fix the following doctest:

```
sage: hash(x) # random 
True
```
so that the reader expects some integer result.

Maybe some test like:

```
sage: type(hash(x))
int
```
could be added.
