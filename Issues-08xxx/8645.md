With the recent ECL update #8275, maxima package doesn't install the ECL library (which was added in #7287). The library is built, but put in an unexpected location. Here is the end of the log:

```

Note that the return value of the cp command is not checked.

The files are here:

```

libmaxima.a  maxima.fasb  
```

Any ideas why?

I checked and between maxima 5.19 and maxima 5.20 none of the "lisp" files have changed in src/src, so it seems very unlikely that the change in location of maxima.fasb is due to the maxima upgrade.

On the other hand, between ECL 9 and ECL 10, there seems to be a lot of activity in the ASDF module, which is responsible for the building:

http://ecls.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ecls/ecl/src/CHANGELOG?view=markup

so I can easily believe that the cause is here.

In particular, they are advertising a new option ":move-here" which allows the destination to be specified. I tried this with the presently packaged ECL 10.2.1 without luck, so perhaps upgrading ECL would be a good idea (and then hope they don't touch ASDF for a while).

On the plus side: The "fasb" file type is always recognised by ECL 10.4.2, so the ugly (and risky?) renaming should not be necessary anymore.

If after upgrading you still can't manage getting maxima.fasb in a sane location, perhaps drop Juanjo a line.

This may be of some help. I tried building with ECL 10.4.1. As announced in
http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/e094589b2d99be8a/ab26bd29b3a8990a
we need a patch (attached there) to Maxima 5.20.1 to let it build.

The following instruction *should* do the trick

```
(require 'asdf)
(load "maxima-build.lisp")
(asdf:make-build :maxima :type :fasl :move-here ".")
```
but for me they lead to an error

```
Cannot rename the file #P"/home/nbruin/.cache/common-lisp/ecl-10.4.1-linux-x86-64/usr/local/sage/4.3.4/spkg/build/maxima-5.20.1/src/src/maxima.fasb" to #P"/usr/local/sage/4.3.4/spkg/build/maxima-5.20.1/src/src/maxima.fasb".
Explanation: Invalid cross-device link.
```
This error message indicates:
* that ECL is trying to do exactly the right thing
* that it's trying to do the move with a hard link, which it shouldn't try. That's a straightforward error, which will probably be fixed in ECL 10.4.2.

So my guess is that this issue should be fixable quite soon by upgrading.

Oh, and the line

```
cp maxima.fasb $ECLLIB/maxima.fas
```
should be changed to

```
cp maxima.fasb $ECLLIB || echo "Failed to build maxima.fasb"; exit 1
```
so that errors like this get caught next time and because ECL 10.4 supposedly natively recognizes .fasb files.

This should solve the problem:

```
mkdir ./lisp-cache
```
then in lisp:

```
(require 'asdf)
(setf asdf::*user-cache* (truename "./lisp-cache"))
(load "maxima-build.lisp")
(asdf:make-build :maxima :type :fasl :move-here ".")
```

* this directory is guaranteed to be on the same file system
* the cache is not accidentally on a slower (/home) file system
* the cache gets wiped when spkg/build/maxima-5.20.1 does.
* no interference with a possible cache that the user privately might have in ecl

So, what needs to be done is:

* upgrade to ecl 10.4.1
* patch Maxima to build with ecl 10.4.1
* patch maxima's spkg-install with the above changes so that maxima.fasb gets built in the right place.

Updated spkgs up at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nbruin/maxima-5.20.1.p1.spkg

I haven't extensively tested them but at least on sage.math they seem to work and changes are small otherwise. Someone probably wants to test maxima on ecl-10.4.1 extensively (although maxima is part of the regular ecl buildfarm testsuite)

For reference, I have also attached the patches for the spkgs. *These are already applied to the above spkgs*.

The maxima package at #8731 supersedes the maxima spkg here.

I'm just building sage-4.4.4.alpha1 on Solaris 10 SPARC and will test this as soon as that is finished. What other machines has it been tested on? 

I can't spend any more time on this just now - my wife wants me to do something which is going to take a few hours. 

I think it is sensible to upgrade the maxima in this way, but there are various small changes to ECL which could (should) be merged into the ecl update. 

Would you consider making merging these patches 

* On #8951, the patch which removes the tmp files and has a minor (really cosmetic) changes to spkg-install. The removal of the tmp files is quite important, as it often stops builds on 't2'
* On #8089 the patch to disable assembly code on OpenSolaris
* On #9187 the patch to allow parallel building of .spkgs. 

I think if a new .spkg with ECL 10.4.1 is created, and the Maxima changed to work properly with that, then these should be merged. Then hopefully the maxima update can be separated. 

One of the issues I will have reviewing this is the fact I don't know lisp, but I doubt many people will so I will do my best. 

But just now I need to do other things.

Except for the "Important" section and the comment in the positive review. Only upgrading ECL will lead to maxima not building, so no doctests will pass. A successful merge has to include a change to maxima.

That was my point - upgrading just ECL would not have worked.

OK, point taken. 

It would be good if there was a list of doc tests associated with each package, so its possible to quickly test if changes break any tests. 

Anyway, positive review. 

 == Note to release manager ==
This ticket, and #9264 need to be merged together. Merging  #9264 without this one will cause problems.

This is marked as minor, but I've found it causes Maxima to fail to install on bsd.math, so it breaks the build.

The package maxima-5.20.1.p1 is designed to be built on ecl 10.4.1 or later. In order to use the :MOVE-HERE keyword, I had to upgrade to ecl 10.4.1.

I think sage is still shipping maxima-5.20.1.p0 with ecl 10.2.1, which silently fails to build maxima.fasb. Hence the original filing as "minor": a library that by default isn't used silently fails to build.

Thank you, it seem whenever we need to update we need to 

* Update maxima
* Update ecl
* Update the doctests

which is a bit annoying. It often does not seem possible to update ecl or maxima independently.

Yes, but the current Sage build (and upgrade) process doesn't really reflect this... ;-)

(We use `make`, but `sage-spkg` usually just reports a dependent package was already installed; our current scheme lacks version requirements almost completely.)

For the *rebuild dependent packages on upgrade* issue, there's #9896 (needs review; not limited to MacOS X). :)
