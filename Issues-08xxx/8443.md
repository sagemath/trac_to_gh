The problem seems to be duplicate cell IDs.  The function `Worksheet.edit_save` parses a worksheet's text into a list of cells.  If the worksheet ends with a text cell, the function appends a compute cell.  But the existing code does not update the cell counter, which is the ID of the next new cell, **before** it appends the cell.  The appended cell's ID could match an existing ID.  If two cells have the same ID, the browser can jump to the second one, at the end of the worksheet, after you evaluate the predecessor of the first.

This patch looks good. It fixes the problem for me with the worksheet I attached in that sage-notebook thread. I think it could use a doctest, though. Here's my idea:

```
sage: nb = sagenb.notebook.notebook.Notebook(tmp_dir()+'.sagenb')
sage: nb.add_user('sage','sage','sage@sagemath.org',force=True)
sage: W = nb.create_new_worksheet('Test trac #8443', 'sage')
sage: W.edit_save("{{{\n1+1\n///\n}}}\n\n<p>a text cell</p>")
sage: len(set(W.cell_id_list())) == 3
True
```

The idea is that if a duplicate cell id gets added, making a set out of the id list will be shorter than the plain id list. Does this seem like a reasonable test that will prevent a regression on this issue?

Yes, definitely.  I should have written a test.  I've tweaked your example a bit, since it also passes without the patch.  Please see V2.

**Without** the patch, I get

```python
sage: nb = sagenb.notebook.notebook.Notebook(tmp_dir() + '.sagenb')
sage: nb.add_user('sage', 'sage', 'sage@sagemath.org', force=True)
sage: W = nb.create_new_worksheet('Test trac #8443', 'sage')
sage: W.edit_save('{{{\n1+1\n///\n}}}')
sage: W.cell_id_list()
[0]
sage: W.next_id()
1
sage: W.edit_save("{{{\n1+1\n///\n}}}\n\n<p>a text cell</p>")
sage: len(set(W.cell_id_list())) == 3    # oops!
False
sage: W.cell_id_list()                   # oops!
[0, 1, 1]
sage: W.next_id()                        # oops!
2
```
As far as it goes, my review of the test is positive.
