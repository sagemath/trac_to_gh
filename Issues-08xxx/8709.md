On one platform (an itanium machine running red hat), I see this:

```
File "/home/palmieri/cleo/sage-4.4.alpha0/devel/sage/sage/geometry/polyhedra.py", line 3147:
    sage: for lset in polytopes.cross_polytope(2).face_lattice().level_sets(): print lset[0]
Expected:
    (None, (0, 1, 2, 3))
    ((1,), (2, 3))
    ((1, 2), (3,))
    ((0, 1, 2, 3), None)
Got:
    (None, (0, 1, 2, 3))
    ((0,), (1, 2))
    ((1, 2), (3,))
    ((0, 1, 2, 3), None)
```
This is with Sage 4.4.alpha0, and it comes from the patch in ticket #8650.

The attached patch avoids this sorting issue by only examining the extremes of the face lattice, which is where the problems from 8650 were.
