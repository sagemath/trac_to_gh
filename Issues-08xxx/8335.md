Implements coercion within lattices of finite fields lying above the same prime when implemented with Conway polynomials.

```
sage: k = GF(9, conway=True, prefix='z')
sage: l = GF(27, conway=True, prefix='z')
sage: x = k.gen() + l.gen(); x
z6^5 + 2*z6^4 + 2*z6^3 + z6^2 + 2*z6 + 1
sage: x.parent()
Finite Field in z6 of size 3^6
```

When using the `conway` and `prefix` parameters, one does not need to specify an explicit variable name; if no variable name is given, it is constructed from the `prefix` and the degree (as in the above code snippet).

In the future, the functionality of this ticket will be incorporated into that for algebraic closures of finite fields.  It will then be possible to construct compatible systems of finite fields outside the range of the Conway polynomial database using the pseudo-Conway polynomials from #14958: polynomials that satisfy all of the algebraic constraints on Conway polynomials without the lexicographic constraint that imposes uniqueness.

These patches were quite old and things have moved around since they were written.
As a consequence, part of the old patches now apply to different files, that is the case of the NTL GF2E implementation which has been split in a Python and a Cython file.

Some pseudo Conway polys changed so that two doctests now fail (not corrected in the patches cause I did not take the time to think about it, feel free to do it).
As these pseudo Conway polynomials are not unique, I'm not sure if the procedure to generate them is deterministic or to which point randomness comes into play and if the failing doctests are just due to some routine called during the generation which may give a different result since the patches were originally written.

Not really sure how to cast restriction on the is_square and squarefree_decomposition methods, nor what I've changed makes sense, I've come up with this quickly, feel free to correct it.
The basic problem was that now Sage supports function fields where we have no p-th roots and that raised an AttributeError when calling is_square which called squarefree_decomposition in some doctests.

The doc now builds ok and looks nice (although I did not have LaTeX on my computer), but may need some revamping.
Nonetheless it would be great to get this in quickly.

There were problem doing coercion because Sage now tried to define algebraic extension of Integers(1) and failed on ArithmeticError when trying 0^0, or depth of recursion if that was changed to return 1.

I've added an extension method to the IntegerModring_generic class to handle separatly this ring.

Did not check everything is fine though.

We have some Sage meeting near Paris in France today, with a tutorial about ... finite fields.
We'll try to polish this one up there.

I've fixed some additional stuff and have new two concerns (in addition to the matrix2 stuff I've not dealt with):
* the cunningham tables did not get standard so we cannot really use them (or we'll get that warning which will make one doctest fail), not sure we can trigger their use iff they are installed to avoid this spurious warning
* as of now, if no name is provided when an extension field is trigerred and modulus is 'default' then it becomes 'conway' and that will potentially need the factorization (or the prime factors) of (p^n - 1), which might not be a good idea, so i'd prefer to just look to raise an error as before, or at least trigger a warning.

This is caused by the "fix" I proposed before to return IntegerMod(1) for algebraic extension of IntegerMod(1), because now I feel a common parent is chosen as IntegerMod(1), but this is a prime field and the element from the extension field "cannot" be cast there.

A proper solution could be to investigate the infinite loop we get when the ArithmeticError is replaced with returning a unit when computing 0^0.
Another solution might be to forbid extension of IntegerMod(1) so that we don't get crappy common parents.

Forget my rant about something becoming conway and having potential performance issues.
It only occurs if we have the conway polynomial precomputed, so no worries.

I've removed the code calling factor_cunningham unconditionally (or rather, not through an option as in finite_rings/element_base.pyx).
At some point this should get automatically triggered when cunningham tables are included (#7240, #12133) and integer factorization is improved (#12125, #12117), so calling factor_cunningham directly won't be that useful anyway.

The patches should be quite ok now.
This needs 5.8.beta0, or at least > 5.7.beta4.
I've made quite a bit of changes to all the coercion stuff, so that definitely needs review.
With a minimal set of changes to sources files you can now create algebraic extensions of the Integers(1) and let it be considered as a quotient of a univariate poly ring, etc. and everything that came up when I was trying to rebase the patches.
In particular, now the modulus var of an AlgebraicExtensionFunctor is always a polynomial, but I've added an additional optional field named conway to encode the fact we're dealing with pseudo-conway extensions of ff.

Please test, rant, whatever!

Did anyone actually had the time to look at this?
It would have been great to have that in Sage during the FLINT workshop last week to check some results using Sage rather than Magma.

I'm ok with what David initially did modulo what had to be fixed and that I hopefully fixed.
So what's left to do is to review the rebasing and changes I introduced.
Note that I did not check that the patches still cleanly apply, that may be an issue now.

Hi,

The doc in `constructor.py` says

```
 - ``modulus`` - blabla
   - 'default': a Conway polynomial is used if in the database. Otherwise 
     a sparse polynomial is used for binary fields and a 
     random polynomial is used for other characteristics. 
```

but I got the impression that the default is to use pseudo-conway. By the way, is it reasonable to use pseudo-conway as default ? It is utterly slow !

```
sage: %time k = GF(next_prime(100000)^2) 
CPU times: user 16.41 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 16.45 s
Wall time: 16.18 s
sage: %time l = GF(next_prime(100000)^3) 
CPU times: user 60.19 s, sys: 0.07 s, total: 60.26 s
Wall time: 59.97 s
sage: %time (k.gen() + l.gen()).parent()
CPU times: user 0.08 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.09 s
Wall time: 0.07 s
Finite Field in z6 of size 100003^6
```

Compare this with Magma

```
> time k := GF(NextPrime(100000)^2);                                                                                                  
Time: 0.000
> time l := GF(NextPrime(100000)^3); 
Time: 0.000

> time CommonOverfield(l, k);              
Time: 0.030
```

Wouldn't it be better to keep using ``random`` as default, and give error messages suggesting to use ``conway`` when the user tries to add/multiply/whatever two elements in different fields?


On another note, I get the following messages (I suppressed them from the output above for readability).

```
sage: k = GF(next_prime(10000)^11)
  ***   Warning: Mod(a,b)^n with n >> b : wasteful.
  ***   Warning: Mod(a,b)^n with n >> b : wasteful.

```

Any ideas on these?

I think the rationale is that Sage did not support finite fields with unnamed generator before this patch.
So IIRC you could simply not do the above.
If you do something which used to work like

```
K.<a> = GF(182918291829182918291892819)
```
(assuming the random typing is some prime power)
I think it still picks up a random modulus as before (and is fast enough).

I agree it's kind of a bad thing to provide a new (but still natural, especially for Magma's users) way to create finite fields which is horribly slow.
So we might want to fix this.

Also note that this ticket only provides lattices for finite fields created with pseudo-conway polynomials.
The goal is not to provide (compatible) embeddings for all finite fields (as Magma is capable of).

<div id="comment:51" align="right">comment:51</div>

There was some actual bug in the code which triggered the computation of the pseudo-Conway polynomials tree twice in the case where the extension degree was prime.
First the way it should, and then using the same arguments as in the case where this degree is not prime which at some point triggered the computation of the power of modular integer with a small modulus and a huge exponent and PARI rants when you do that;
just try

```
Mod(3,5)._pari_()**28172187218728127182718271821982918291829182918291
```

So the newly uploaded patch makes it so we only build the tree once as we always should have, and at least in Luca's example it prevents PARI rants to get on the screen.

If you try

which is a non-prime extension you still get PARI's rants on-screen.

More worrying is that

```
GF(next_prime(10000)^14)

Ok, the last tests I added:

```

        sage: old_exists_cp = sage.rings.finite_rings.constructor.exists_conway_polynomial
        sage: sage.rings.finite_rings.constructor.exists_conway_polynomial = lambda p, n: False
        sage: k = GF(3**10)
        sage: l = GF(3**20)
        sage: k.modulus() == conway_polynomial(3, 10)
        False
        sage: l(k.gen()**10) == l(k.gen())**10
        True
        sage: del k, l
        sage: import gc
        sage: gc.collect();
        sage: sage.rings.finite_rings.constructor.exists_conway_polynomial = old_exists_cp
```
introduced some failures in the test:

```
sage: GF.other_keys(key, K)
            [(9, ('a',), x^2 + 2*x + 2, None, '{}', 3, 2, True),
             (9, ('a',), x^2 + 2*x + 2, 'givaro', '{}', 3, 2, True)]
```
Indeed, although I explicitely asked to delete k and l and restored a proper exists_... function, the field GF(3**20) stay cached and so the pseudo-Conway, but not Conway, modulus used to build GF(3**2).

The reason for that is that we performed arithmetic on elements of k and l which triggered creation of an embedding of k into l which prevents the collection of k and l.
This is bad and is surely the same problem as in #14711.

So I just removed the hack forcing the use of pseudo-Conway polynomials.

Beware that the last patch which contains my modification to the two original patches by David changes quite a lot of thing.
In particular, I think that with it modulus contains the real modulus as well and I use additional attributes to check for pseudo-Conway construction.

Also note that the real nice addition of this patch is mainly the compatible embeddings.
Indeed, for practical purposes, it seems that only the Conway polynomials from the databse will be used.
Constructing pseudo-Conway polynomials is quite as  slow as contructions genuine Conway polynomials so when you will actually use them, i.e. for quite large parameters because you have to be outside of the Conway database, it will already be quite slow and unpractical.

OK, I'll try to find out if and how my ideas about making the choice of polynomial independently of the finite field implementation can be harmonised with your patch.  At first sight there does not seem to be a huge clash.  I am mostly worried about the use of strings like 'conwayz' as a modulus, which really seems to be overloading this parameter too much.

I agree that this is a very desirable thing to have, and it is also nice to be able to simply type ``F = GF(p<sup>n</sup>)`` without having to care about variable names and embeddings.  I do think it is good to think carefully about how exactly to accomplish this.

In particular, I am not sure if it is wise to say in the documentation/specification that this compatibility is achieved using (pseudo-)Conway polynomials, since different implementations are imaginable.  I am thinking of the standard models for finite fields by Lenstra and de Smit, which are constructed in a way that does not seem to be related to Conway polynomials.

From a conceptual point of view, it is desirable that GF(p<sup>n</sup>) without any arguments should refer to the unique subfield of cardinality p<sup>n</sup> *inside a chosen algebraic closure* of GF(p).  This gives 'compatible embeddings' the very simple meaning of 'inclusions within an algebraic closure'.

Such an algebraic closure could be implemented in different ways, for example via (pseudo-)Conway polynomials; algebraic closures of GF(p) resulting from different methods would be non-canonically isomorphic.  There might be a default choice that could change in the future, and the user should be able to specify which algebraic closure should be taken.

Here is how I would hope a hypothetical future Sage session to look like:

```
sage: p = 5
sage: Fpbar = GF(p).algebraic_closure()
sage: Fpbar
Algebraic closure of Finite Field of size 5
sage: Fa = GF(p^2, 'a')
sage: Fa
Finite field in a of size 5^2
sage: is_subfield(Fa, Fpbar)
False
sage: Fb = GF(p^2)
Subfield of size 5^2 of Algebraic closure of Finite Field of size 5
sage: is_subfield(Fb, Fpbar)
True
sage: type(Fpbar)
<class 'sage.rings.AlgebraicClosureFiniteField_pseudo_conway'>
```
Would something like this be easy to achieve once this ticket has been implemented?

Agreed.
But it just happened I stumled upon this ticket which already looked usable (and was two years old) and thought "oh, let's already get this in; later on we can design better constructions of compatible embeddings and get something more general and fast".
So I decided to postpone the design of a cool and fast system in #8751 and only deal with "lattices using (pseudo) Conway polynomials" here.
It's better to have something than nothing.

I completely agree that using Conway polynomials is a no go as soon as you quit fields of small cardinalities.
I've met Eric Rains who participated in the Magma implementation (or at least the algos behind it) and he was nice enough to share with me a draft describing the algos used.

De Feo and Schost and others are also producing nice paper on how to build p- or l-adic towers of finite fields.
What is very nice is that they avoid linear algebra (what Magma may not completely do).

I started to look at the patches, but was immediately struck by a problem that has nothing to do with finite fields.  In `QuotientFunctor._apply_functor`, the functor R -> R/IR (where I is an ideal of the base ring) to arbitrary rings.  This makes perfect sense for any R; you just happen to get the zero ring when IR = R.  The existing behaviour is certainly correct (although it is debatable whether the zero ring should be represented as `Integers(1)`).  Why would you want to raise an exception if R is a field?

I think it was the historical Sage behavior until some recent ticket (don't really remember, you should be able to devise which one by looking at the hg log).

I also agree returning the zero ring would be a better thing to do.
But then it breaks a bunch of generic constructions in Sage such as polynomial rings over {0} and quotients of it...

Of course.
But avoiding the coercion model is not that easy.

I'll give it a shot, but I cannot promise to come up with anything working.
Obviously I would have done that earlier if it was really easy.

In fact I think that putting back the correct behavior gives no problems and I added all needed fixes to make it work.

The real problem was that the quotient functor was applied before the fraction field one or the other way around and you always ended up working in the trivial ring.
So the easy way was raising an error.
But now the functors are applied in a more sensible it should not be a problem.

I'll upload a fixed patch when I make sure no tests fail.

Certainly; both this ticket and #13214 are already large enough.  The question is whether (a draft of) a categorical framework (i.e. algebraic closure of **F**<sub>*p*</sub>) should be made first, or whether the new code from this ticket should be inserted into the current framework (which implements the first of the two categories) and be moved to a new framework as soon as we have it.

I would personally prefer the first option to keep things better packaged; this patch seems to make (pseudo-)Conway polynomials pop up in many different places, and moving them all to one place would require another intrusive Trac ticket later.

As far as functionalities are concerned, remember that Sage currently does not support 

```
K = GF(p^n)
```
So pseudo Conway polynomials never appear where they did not use to.
If you issue the command line which is currently supported:

```
K.<a> = GF(p^n)
```
you will get the exact same behavior as before, unless he specifies modulus="conway" and wants an extension of too large cardinality; maybe that should be changed back.

Nevertheless I agree that a user coming from Magma where

```
K := GF(p, n);
```
works might be confused...
Though the user might although expect embeddings of finite fields to work out of the box.

But as I just realized I guess your concern is about the dissemination of code.
From what I see, apart from code in finite_field_base.py, changes to specific finite field implementations mostly consists in replacing the part about Conway polynomials and tweak it to work with pseudo-Conway ones as well.
Nonetheless it's true that properly moving all of that later will be intrusive.

But what about plain Conway polynomials? Shouldn't that be moved as well?
Or do we consider they are standard enough to belong in the FiniteFields() category?
But if they do it would be a waste not to use automagically the fact that they provide simple embeddings into each other, wouldn't it? though it would make the separation between the plain finite fields and subfields of a given algebraic closure blurrier.

(As you can guess, I'd prefer to get this merged first especially because I hate seeing functional code bitrotting for years on trac, but I get your point :))

Deciding what exactly `GF(p^n)` should mean (if it should mean anything at all) is an important design decision, and it is not at all obvious that Sage should make the same choice as Magma.  Probably it is better not to make this decision in this ticket, which already adds a lot of code.  Besides, letting an important change of behaviour depend whether the user specify a variable name or not sounds like a risky idea.

They certainly belong to the general finite fields code, but not in any specific implementation, in my opinion.  In fact, the goal of the (by now 2) patches that I'm about to post is as follows:

- write a method `PolynomialRing_dense_finite_field.irreducible_element` (somewhat surprisingly the class did not exist yet) to generate an irreducible polynomial in that polynomial ring, allowing the user to optionally specify an algorithm (Adleman-Lenstra, Conway, random, lexicographically first, sparse);

- modify the `FiniteField` constructor to call this algorithm if the `modulus` argument is a string or `None`, and always pass an actual polynomial to the implementation class.

For backward compatibility (unpickling), the existing implementations will continue to accept string values for the parameter `modulus`, but new ones (such as the new PARI interface, see #12142) won't have to.  The idea is that the specific implementations should "concentrate on doing their job", and things related to magic values of `modulus` should be in only one place.

> But if they do it would be a waste not to use automagically the fact that they provide simple embeddings into each other, wouldn't it?

As I see it, that should depend on whether you are in the category of all finite fields or in the category of subfields of an algebraic closure of **F**<sub>*p*</sub>.

> (As you can guess, I'd prefer to get this merged first especially because I hate seeing functional code bitrotting for years on trac, but I get your point :))

Of course I understand that you want to see this finally appear in Sage, and I agree that it is a shame that Sage could have had something like this for years and still doesn't.  I guess it will be easier if this big ticket is split into smaller pieces.  It tries to do many rather different things at once: implement pseudo-Conway polynomials, adapt the construction of finite fields to use these, implement automatic coercion between the resulting fields, give a meaning to `GF(p^n)`, and in the process add some new methods to polynomial elements.

There are many solutions to the compatibly embedded finite fields problem, no one being ideal. I'm more in favor of seeing them emerge in parallel, being developed in different tickets under different namespaces and APIs, rather than fixing the API now, and than realizing that it needs to be amended. Once a construction clearly stands out, then we can thrash it upon the user as the default ``GF(p<sup>n</sup>)`` construction (ok, this ticket is already thrashing, but it has the merit of being the first one!).

Not quite; I am not at all advocating long specification design, and quick integration of new features (which I am all for) is in fact easier if they are smaller and don't intrude in places where they don't have to.

> Having some kind of support for lattices of finite fields has been a long standing request. I agree with pbruin that a better interface between generic finite fields and their actual implementation would be beneficial. But this ticket is ready for review, while pbruin's is not.

The part that is relevant for this ticket is now ready for review: see #14832 and #14833.

I am actually in favour of quickly solving the main things that this ticket does (implementing pseudo-Conway polynomials and coercion between different finite fields).  I just think it shouldn't add more code to the finite fields implementations (Givaro, PARI etc.), and should not (or at least not yet) fix a meaning for `GF(p^n)`.

I've begun rebasing, cleaning and splitting in a better way the patches here.

I have one question: in several finite field constructors based on a given implementation (let's say FiniteField_givaro), you can still pass the "modulus" parameter as a string and the routine corresponding to the given type of modulus is called.
IMHO this kind of defeats what Peter tried to do in #14832 and #14833 (though it predates these patcehs of course).
Any objection to change this behavior and instead more or less call the new irreducible_element function with the appropriate "algorithm" parameter?

Ok so let's go this way.

As I'll be cut from the internet next week while the workshop in Leiden is taking place and I'm not sure what I'll be able to achieve today, here are some hints on what I plan to do.
Of course feel free to do something completely different and merge the ticket next week!

* rebase David's first patch (PC polys construction) on top of Peter's patches and include the relevant fixes (i.e. those only related to Conway and pseudo-Conway polynomials construction) from the "fixes" patch I posted here, move all the conway and pseudo-conway construction stuff to a separate file (I feel two files, one for Conway, one for pseudo-Conway, would be overkill, but all that stuff currently in constructor.py seems too much), maybe use two algo names "conway" for using the database and pseudo-conway to use the new code (and still use the database when possible).

(though the polynomial does not really care it's pseudo-Conway whereas the FF does). I don't think modifying irreducible_element() to return more stuff would be a good idea, any other advice welcomed!
* rebase David's second patch (coercion) on top of Peter's patches, include relevant fixes, do not define "GF" without names.
* keep the design of the AlgebraicClosure stuff for later, note that it should not be too hard to move later to the new framework, much less hard than implementing FFs through templates as for the p-adics and polynomial rings :)

 This feature is implemented for fields outside the range of the Conway polynomial database by the implementation of a function for finding pseudo-Conway polynomials: polynomials that satisfy all of the algebraic constraints on Conway polynomials without the lexicographic constraint that imposes uniqueness.
 
-Finite fields no longer require an explicit variable name (though they still accept one).  If a variable name is given, then outside the range of the Conway polynomial database a random or sparse polynomial is used for speed reasons; if no variable name is given then either a Conway polynomial or pseudo-Conway polynomial is used.

Besides everything else, the latest patch moves `_coerce_map_from_()` from the various finite field implementations to the `FiniteField` base class; it is now implementation-independent.  For this reason, this ticket now depends on #12142.  Various other changes have been made.

The syntax for constructing finite fields using Conway polynomials that admit automatic coercion is now

```
sage: F.<a> = FiniteField(5^3, conway=True, prefix='z')
```
This is not too pretty, but it is meant as a temporary solution until we have algebraic closures of finite fields.

Older patches on this ticket contained various changes that were in older attachments and that do not seem immediately relevant to this ticket.  I deleted those changes that seemed superfluous and kept those that I thought could be necessary after all.

This ticket should be reviewed once #14958 is done.

My bad.
I thought you still cached the lattice in the finite field but you don't.
(Un)fortunately when the lattice is built it is only weak-cached in conway_polynomials.py (so that it can be gc'ed when no finite field uses it anymore).

So either we have to store the lattice in the finite field to keep it alive and be able to use it when building extensions/pushouts and so on, or strongly cache it in conway_polynomials.py (I don't like that solution, in fact I hate caching things too much; note that currently everything is strongly cached anyway because of [comment:69](#comment%3A69), #14711).

I dislike it too.  It is problematic to store pseudo-Conway lattices globally in a Sage session (at least until they are garbage-collected) given that they are not uniquely defined.

It appears that the user could do the following:
- create a finite field *k*<sub>0</sub> using a primitive polynomial *f*<sub>0</sub>
- throw away *k*<sub>0</sub>, causing the pseudo-Conway lattice containing *f*<sub>0</sub> to be garbage-collected
- create a field *k*<sub>1</sub> using exactly the same command as for *k*<sub>0</sub>; this will be isomorphic to *k*<sub>0</sub>, but will in general be defined by a polynomial *f*<sub>1</sub> that is different from *f*<sub>0</sub>
- end up with a *k*<sub>1</sub> that is incompatible with things that were constructed with the help of *k*<sub>0</sub> (e.g. extensions of *k*<sub>0</sub>), even though both of them were generated using pseudo-Conway polynomials.

I was also worried that storing the pseudo-Conway lattice in the finite field would mean that we would forever have to keep suitable pickling/unpickling code around to deal with this.  Actually, this is not necessary, since the pseudo-Conway lattice can be reconstructed from the defining polynomial.  However, this does not seem to solve the above problem.  Using strong references does not solve it either.  In both cases, the user may pickle *k*<sub>0</sub>, restart Sage, create *k*<sub>1</sub>, and finally unpickle *k*<sub>0</sub>; then again *k*<sub>0</sub> and *k*<sub>1</sub> will be different in general.

All of this is basically a manifestation of the fact that "the" field of *p<sup>n</sup>* elements is only defined up to non-canonical isomorphism.

We could do that to make garbage collection less likely, but it won't really solve the problem, see [comment:108](#comment%3A108).

Yes, the more I think about it, the more convinced I am that algebraic closures are the only real solution to the problem of compatible embeddings.

Jenny Cooley suggested the following idea, which I think is a good compromise: implement this ticket only for standard (not pseudo-) Conway polynomials.  Hopefully this would suffice for most practical purposes, and since they are uniquely determined, we wouldn't have to come up with half-baked solutions to the caching problem.

-In the future, the functionality of this ticket will be incorporated into that for algebraic closures of finite fields.
+In the future, the functionality of this ticket will be incorporated into that for algebraic closures of finite fields.  It will then be possible to construct compatible systems of finite fields outside the range of the Conway polynomial database using the pseudo-Conway polynomials from #14958: polynomials that satisfy all of the algebraic constraints on Conway polynomials without the lexicographic constraint that imposes uniqueness.
