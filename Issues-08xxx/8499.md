How can one compute a partial fraction decomposition over the
complex numbers? Consider the following:

```
sage: x = PolynomialRing(RationalField(), 'x').gen()
sage: r = 1 /(x^4 + 1)
sage: r.partial_fraction_decomposition()
(0, [1/(x^4 + 1)])
```
This is ok since we explicitely work over QQ. Now compare with:

```
sage: P.<y> = PolynomialRing(RationalField())
sage: Qbar.<y> = QuotientRing(P, y^2+1)
sage: x = PolynomialRing(Qbar, 'x').gen()
sage: r = 1 /(x^4 + 1)
sage: r.partial_fraction_decomposition()

I found out the solution by myself. If one wants say a decomposition over Q[sqrt(2)] or Q[I], then simply use `QQ[sqrt(2)]` or `QQ[sqrt(-1)]`:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[sqrt(2)][]
sage: r=1/(x^4+1)
sage: r.partial_fraction_decomposition()
(0,
 [(-1/4*sqrt2*x + 1/2)/(x^2 - sqrt2*x + 1),
  (1/4*sqrt2*x + 1/2)/(x^2 + sqrt2*x + 1)])
```
or:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[sqrt(-1)][]            
sage: r=1/(x^4+1)                       
sage: r.partial_fraction_decomposition()
(0, [(-1/2*I)/(x^2 - I), 1/2*I/(x^2 + I)])
```
Now if you want Sage to automatically find the extension where the denominator fully factors, use
`QQbar`:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQbar[]                   
sage: r=1/(x^4+1)                       
sage: r.partial_fraction_decomposition()
(0,
 [([-0.17677669529663690 .. -0.17677669529663686] - [0.17677669529663686 .. 0.17677669529663690]*I)/(x + [-0.70710678118654758 .. -0.70710678118654746] - [0.70710678118654746 .. 0.70710678118654758]*I),
  ([-0.17677669529663690 .. -0.17677669529663686] + [0.17677669529663686 .. 0.17677669529663690]*I)/(x + [-0.70710678118654758 .. -0.70710678118654746] + [0.70710678118654746 .. 0.70710678118654758]*I),
  ([0.17677669529663686 .. 0.17677669529663690] - [0.17677669529663686 .. 0.17677669529663690]*I)/(x + [0.70710678118654746 .. 0.70710678118654758] - [0.70710678118654746 .. 0.70710678118654758]*I),
  ([0.17677669529663686 .. 0.17677669529663690] + [0.17677669529663686 .. 0.17677669529663690]*I)/(x + [0.70710678118654746 .. 0.70710678118654758] + [0.70710678118654746 .. 0.70710678118654758]*I)])
```
I'll add some examples to the documentation and then we can close this ticket.

thank you for your feedback. You have two questions in fact:

> How is computing the rational fraction decomposition over QQbar gives you the extension where the denominator splits?


this is given in the denominators of the output.

> The extension would be in any case the splitting field of the denominator, isn't it? 


yes.

Feel free to propose a reviewer patch!

I get an error when I try this example:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: r = 1/(x^4+2)
sage: N = r.denominator().splitting_field('a')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
