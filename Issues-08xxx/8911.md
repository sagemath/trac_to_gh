This patch let the crystal code use the category framework

New crystal categories:

* Crystals
* FiniteCrystals
* HighestWeightCrystals
* ClassicalCrystals

together with a template in categories/example/crystals on how to
implement a new crystal.

The files

* combinat/crystals/letters.py
* combinat/crystals/tensor_product.py
* combinat/crystals/spins.py
* combinat/crystals/fast_crystals.py
* combinat/crystals/highest_weight_crystals.py
* combinat/crystals/direct_sum.py
* combinat/crystals/affine.py
* combinat/crystals/kirillov_reshetikhin.py

have been categorified. What was before in

* combinat/crystals

is now mostly in the various categories except for the BackTracker class and the documentation about crystals.

This patch breaks old crystal pickles. Well, those were actually
silently broken since #7978 four months ago, and no-one voted for
against this on sage-combinat-devel.

Depends on #8881. Requires updating Sage's pickle jar.
