Thanks for spotting and fixing this!

Please add an:

```
OUTPUT: integer
```
line in the documentation, as per http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#documentation-strings, as well an
example in the doctests showing/testing that property, and I'll set a positive review!

Note: you may want to use the method divide_knowing_divisible_by on ZZ elements.

Replying to [@nthiery](#comment%3A2):

In the replacement patch I've improved the documentation and added a doctest as suggested.

In addition, I've simplified an existing doctest and slightly modified another (because `divide_knowing_divisible_by` gives a different error when trying to divide by zero).  I've made one more adjustment to the documentation so that the mathematics displays properly; at least it does in the notebook now.

<a id='comment:7'>**Comment 7:**</a>
Replying to [@pelegm](#comment%3A6):

The trouble with using the keyword 'catalan' is that it makes it look as though it concerns the Catalan constant rather than the Catalan numbers:

```
sage: catalan.n()
0.915965594177219
sage: catalan_number(7)
429
```
