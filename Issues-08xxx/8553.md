`solve()` raises an `IndexError` on empty solutions if a list of solution *dictionaries* is requested.

The description/examples may mislead w.r.t. the result type.

Please correct me, but I do not see any difference to your former suggestion.
In what sense does this relax the inputs?

That's perhaps what one would expect.

But `solution_dict=1` evaluates to `True` in all versions, while `solution_dict=42` surprisingly evaluates to `False`, even in your latter version.

no, that's a feature and notice there is an "r" behind the 42! 

```
sage: preparse('42r + 42')
'42 + Integer(42)'

Ok, but I still don't understand the different behavior of Mike's and my machine:

```
sage: kwds = {'solution_dict': 42}
sage: {} if 'solution_dict' in kwds and kwds['solution_dict']==True else []
```

While Mike gets the empty set, I get the empty list, and if the doctests passed on your 4.3.4.rc0, your version behaves like my 4.3.4.alpha1 (on Ubuntu 9.04 x86_64), because I added the `solution_dict=42` case with an expected empty **list**.

AFAICT, `solve` returns a list of possible solutions to the given equality. When the `solution_dict` parameter is `True`, this list is populated by dictionaries instead of symbolic relations.

With this reasoning the current behavior of returning an empty list if we can't find any solutions even if the `solution_dict` parameter is `True` seems correct to me.

That's really a matter of design; one could equally well specify the function to return a list containing an empty dictionary in that case; i.e., the current specification is not precise (and that's not the only one).

But you're right, unless we change the *informal* "prototype" (its signature), it should in any case return a ***list** of something*.


I'd change the patch to reflect whatever behavior you want... ;-)

I uploaded a revised version of Leif's patch, [attachment:trac_8553_solve_fix_IndexError.3.patch,](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8553/ab49713915069e8943062d0eb750bc81.patch,) which cuts down on these examples.

[attachment:trac_8553-review.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8553/trac_8553-review.patch) adds a new test condition to check if the first argument is a list, after the statement that handles a single symbolic expression.

:-) Adding `# optional` or `# long` would have been possible, too.

(Now the tests of Python `int`s vs. Sage's `Integer`s are omitted.)

Since they weren't testing the functionality of `solve()`, but a convenience in Python, I think it's OK if they are not so extensive. I run doctests on these files very often, so it's rather important that even the long tests take a reasonable time.

Can you review my changes BTW?

`m.to_poly_solve(variables)` might be called twice.

Btw, I think the patch should be finally reviewed by someone else, not me, as I'm one of the authors.

It is, but only in the unusual situation that Maxima's solve gave an error and `to_poly_solve` gave the empty list.  More to the point, this was there before, and should be a different ticket.

Not at all - usually it is appropriate to review a reviewer patch.  This reviewer patch really is pretty minimally invasive, and in fact provides a much more useful error message.

It is true that 

```
sage: solve(x==1,x,solution_dict=int(3))
[{x: 1}]
sage: solve([0==1],x,solution_dict=int(3))
[]
sage: solve(0==1,x,solution_dict=int(3))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/Users/karl-dietercrisman/Downloads/sage-4.7.rc1/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/symbolic/relation.pyc in solve(f, *args, **kwds)
    652 
    653     if not isinstance(f, (list, tuple)):
--> 654         raise TypeError("The first argument must be a symbolic expression or a list of symbolic expressions.")
    655 
    656     if len(f)==1 and is_Expression(f[0]):

TypeError: The first argument must be a symbolic expression or a list of symbolic expressions.
```
which is not ideal.  However, this is still better behavior than the mysterious message about bools and len before, so that could be another ticket.  

In any case, this (somewhat surprisingly) still applies fine to 4.7.rc2!  And does what it says.  And passes tests. Positive review.
