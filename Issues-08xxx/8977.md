The function rational_diagonal_form() fails in some quadratic forms. For example:

```
sage: Q = QuadraticForm(ZZ,2,[0,1,-1])
sage: Q
Quadratic form in 2 variables over Integer Ring with coefficients: 
[ 0 1 ]
[ * -1 ]


sage: Q.rational_diagonal_form()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ZeroDivisionError: Rational division by zero
```
When an element of the diagonal is zero the algorithm tries, with a tranformation, to eliminate it. But in the case that Q[i,i]=0, Q[i,j]!=0 and Q[j,j]=-Q[i,j] the tranformation brings the zero back.

The fix changes the transformation, in the case mentioned above, so that doesn't happen.

I don't think the issue you reported above (about matrix groups `random_element()`) is related in any way to this ticket.

The patch is pretty straightforward, is almost one-liner, and clearly changes only the `rational_diagonal_form()` method.

I've just tried on 4.6.1 and:
a. the bug is reproducible
b. the doctest in the patch triggers the bug
c. after applying the patch, the bug is fixed, and the doctest passes.

---

I also tried long-doctesting the `matrix_group.py` file (with the patch applied) but got no error.

Maybe it's showing randomly for you (and you think it's correlated to the patch in this ticket, but is not). Or perhaps something in 4.6.2.alpha3 is affecting this.

---

In my opinion, the patch is ready. I'll switch to "needs_review", in the hope that somebody else gives the positive review soon.

Fresh install, no more failing doctests.

I already clicked "positive_review", and then noticed that the first line of the patch only says "Trac" instead of giving the ticket number and a description of the patch. I'm afraid it would only be set back to "needs_work" by the release manager, as happened [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/10702#comment:3).
