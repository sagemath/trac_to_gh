Hi Mariah,

Replying to [@sagetrac-mariah](#comment%3A3):
> I applied the patch to sage-4.7.1.alpha1, did 'sage -b', and rebuilt the
> documentation.  Yet when I look at the doc of

`sage.combinat.partition.associated`,
> I do not see anything saying that the function is deprecated.  Am I missing something?

This is what I got under the command line

```
sage: P.associated?
Type:           DeprecatedFunctionAlias
Base Class:     <class 'sage.misc.misc.DeprecatedFunctionAlias'>
String Form:    <sage.misc.misc.DeprecatedFunctionAlias object at 0x30c6210>
Namespace:      Interactive
File:           /home/florent/src/Sage/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/misc/misc.py
Definition:     P.associated(self, *args, **kwds)
Docstring:
    Deprecated since version Sage: Version 4.4. Use ``conjugate()``
    instead.
[...]
```
It also work under the notebook and the html built doc.

How did you rebuild the documentation ? If you just did {{{sage -docbuild
reference html}}} then without touching `partitions.py` Sphinx consider it
upto date and doesn't rebuild the documentation. Is that what you did ?
