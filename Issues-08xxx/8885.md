This is what I got under the command line

```
sage: P.associated?
Type:           DeprecatedFunctionAlias
Base Class:     <class 'sage.misc.misc.DeprecatedFunctionAlias'>
String Form:    <sage.misc.misc.DeprecatedFunctionAlias object at 0x30c6210>
Namespace:      Interactive
File:           /home/florent/src/Sage/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/misc/misc.py
Definition:     P.associated(self, *args, **kwds)
Docstring:
    Deprecated since version Sage: Version 4.4. Use ``conjugate()``
    instead.
[...]
```
It also work under the notebook and the html built doc.

How did you rebuild the documentation ? If you just did {{{sage -docbuild
reference html}}} then without touching `partitions.py` Sphinx consider it
upto date and doesn't rebuild the documentation. Is that what you did ?

Florent
