Looks good! I have two comments:

## Strict subcone

I find `ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone.strict_subcone()` confusing: It does return a quotient cone, not a subcone. Maybe we can call it `strict_quotient()`?

## point in cone

`IntegralRayCollection.__contains__(ray)` tests whether `ray` is a reference to one of the generating rays. But this is then inherited by `ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone` Naively, I would have expected that it tests whether something is in the cone:

```
sage: octant = Cone([(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)]) 
sage: N = octant.lattice()
sage: n = N(1,1,1)
sage: n.set_immutable()
sage: n in octant
False
sage: (1,0,0) in octant
False
```
Similarly there are issues with the immutablity as shown in the doctest.

I would suggest the following:

1) get rid of `IntegralRayCollection.__contains__(ray)`. If you need to test membership, its easy enough to search `self.rays()` or `self.rays_set()`:

```
sage: octant = Cone([(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)]) 
sage: N = octant.lattice()
sage: N(1,0,0) in octant.rays()  # no problem with immutability
True
sage: n = N(1,0,0)
sage: n.set_immutable()
sage: n in octant.ray_set()  # slightly more efficient and its clear why n must be immutable
True
```

2) tighten the rules for comparison of N/M-lattice objects:

```
sage: M = N.dual()
sage: M(1,0,0) == N(1,0,0)   # this should raise an error
False
sage: (1,0,0) == N(1,0,0)    # should probably return true
False
sage: M(1,0,0) == (1,0,0)    # should probably return true as well
False
sage: (1,0,0) == (1,0,0)     # works as expected
True
```
This would fix the following:

```
sage: (1,0,0) in octant.rays()  # this should return true
False
sage: M(1,0,0) in octant.rays()  # this should definitely raise an error
False
```

3) add methods `contains(n)` to `ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone` to test whether a N-lattice point is contained in the cone, e.g. (untested)

```
   def contains(self, *Nlist):
      """
      Returns whether the cone contains the N-lattice points ``*Nlist``.
      
      EXAMPLES::

          sage: cone = Cone([[1,0],[0,1]])
          sage: n = cone.ray(0) + cone.ray(1)
          sage: cone.contains(n)
          True
          sage: cone.contains( N(1,1), N(-1,1) )
          False
          sage: cone.contains([ N(1,1), N(-1,1) ])
          False
      """
      pts = flatten(Nlist)
      assert all(n in self._lattice() for n in pts), 'The points '+str(pts)+' must be in the N-lattice.'
      return all( self.polyhedron().contains(n) for n in pts )
``` 

4) `ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone.__contains__()` just calls `contains()`. This is syntactic sugar, but `__` methods alone don't show up in the documentation.

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A5):
> I find `ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone.strict_subcone()` confusing: It does return a quotient cone, not a subcone. Maybe we can call it `strict_quotient()`?


Agreed. I just had to construct this object for equivalence checks and didn't really know how to call it.

> 1) get rid of `IntegralRayCollection.__contains__(ray)`. If you need to test membership, its easy enough to search `self.rays()` or `self.rays_set()`:
Agreed. 

> 2) tighten the rules for comparison of N/M-lattice objects:


```
 sage: M(1,0,0) == N(1,0,0)   # this should raise an error
 False
```

Disagreed. Maybe it is silly to ask if an apple is equal to a car, but there is nothing criminal in it. I think that in general in Python you can compare any two objects and sort lists containing arbitrary objects. So I think that `False` is the correct answer in this case.

>

```
 sage: (1,0,0) == N(1,0,0)    # should probably return true
 False
 sage: M(1,0,0) == (1,0,0)    # should probably return true as well
 False
```

I kind of don't like that we have here a==b and c==a, but b!=c... Do you really want to have it in? It may be actually non-trivial to implement. I already had to tweak the coercion system so that sometimes it allows "non-toric-lattice" objects to be involved and sometimes it does not. In particular I had to make sure that elements of toric lattices are NOT coerced into ZZ^n.

So if you insist, I will try to make it work, but I cannot guarantee that I will be successful and personally I think that we should not change it, as long as this behaviour is clearly documented. (Probably it is not, but that's something which definitely can be fixed ;-))

>

```
 sage: M(1,0,0) in octant.rays()  # this should definitely raise an error
 False
```

Again, I don't think that there should be any errors raised by comparison operations. `False` is an accurate answer to this question - and octant in the N-lattice does not contain any points of the M-lattice.

> 3) add methods `contains(n)` to `ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone` to test whether a N-lattice point is contained in the cone, e.g. (untested)


Agreed. It was on my list of things to do in the future, might as well do it now. 

> 4) `ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone.__contains__()` just calls `contains()`. This is syntactic sugar, but `__` methods alone don't show up in the documentation.


Very good point!!! I knew that they don't show up, but didn't think about just making a "common method" alias.

Please comment on the points of disagreement and I will try to fix the issues in a couple of days. Thanks for a careful review!

One could narrow it down to only raise an exception on tests that run into this problem, like a test along the lines of

```
if (!is_ToricLatticeElement(n)):
  try:
    [ ZZ(i) for i in n ]
    raise ValueError, 'You probably want '+str(n)+' to be a N-lattice element.'
  except:
    return False   # whatever n is, its not in the cone

sage: 2 == F5(2)

So the code from your comment will work like this:

sage: (1,0,0) == (1,0,0)     # works as expected - YES

sage: (1,0,0) in octant.rays()  # this should return true - YES

```
I think this way it's OK to be sloppy about lattices, especially if one just does not care about them. If one uses the very last command, then clearly (s)he is aware of toric lattices and should be able to interpret this `False` correctly.

although this does not bother me too much and I would suggest leaving this as is until we see where and how it can cause problems. (Making the second line return `N(2,0,0)` can be a bit tricky.)

OK, I think I have addressed all the points in the original review except 2) which is pretty much impossible to realize completely (originally I was thinking of (1,1,1) as vectors, but they are just tuples, see the above comment for vector behaviour in this situation). I have added a general warning about tuples in the main `ToricLattice` documentation.

I added `__contains__` to `ToricLattice`, since I discovered that the inherited implementation is not suitable.

I added `__contains__`, `_contains`, and `contains` to cones. The real job is done in `_contains`, two others call it. The reason for the third function is an attempt to make warnings show where the actual potential mistake was, which requires the same calling depth. Unfortunately, in my tests it worked as I wanted only if it was triggered by some library code, in the notebook for created functions and attached files it just shows `main`. But that may change and maybe the terminal behaves differently. Now `cone.contains(stuff)` will try its best to return `True` by interpreting `stuff` as a point in the ambient space of `cone`, i.e. in `cone.lattice().base_extend(RR)`. However, it will catch points from foreign lattices first and return `False` with a warning, visible the first time for each location.

That's how reviewer's code works with the new version of the patch:

```
sage: octant = Cone([(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)]) 
sage: N = octant.lattice()
sage: n = N(1,1,1)
sage: n.set_immutable()
sage: n in octant # True was desired
True
sage: (1,0,0) in octant # True was desired
True
sage: N(1,0,0) in octant.rays()  # was and should be True
True
sage: n = N(1,0,0)
sage: n.set_immutable()
sage: n in octant.ray_set()  # was and should be True
True
sage: M = N.dual()
sage: M(1,0,0) == N(1,0,0)   # Error was desired
False
sage: (1,0,0) == N(1,0,0)    # True was desired, but difficult to get
False
sage: M(1,0,0) == (1,0,0)    # True was desired, but difficult to get
False
sage: (1,0,0) == (1,0,0)     # works as expected
True
sage: (1,0,0) in octant.rays()  # True was desired, but difficult to get
False
sage: M(1,0,0) in octant.rays()  # Error was desired
False
sage: cone = Cone([[1,0],[0,1]])
sage: (1,1) in cone # Was False
True
sage: M = cone.lattice().dual()
sage: M(1,1) in cone # Now gives warning on the first attempt
__main__:1: UserWarning: you have checked if a cone contains a point from another lattice, this is always False!
False
```
I suppose two lines marked "Error was desired" can also give a warning the first time they are invoked, if we implement a custom `__eq__` in addition to `__cmp__` for `ToricLatticeElement`. Should this be done?

Thank you!

Dimension limit is exactly why I started using `Polyhedra`, however I didn't quite like the timings. For example, this is what I get on geom.math with toric patches applied:

```
sage: %time
sage: o = lattice_polytope.octahedron(6) # no PALP calls
CPU time: 0.00 s,  Wall time: 0.00 s
sage: %time
sage: len(o.faces()) # PALP call to get incidences (no Hasse diagram)
6
CPU time: 0.07 s,  Wall time: 0.13 s
sage: %time
sage: f = FaceFan(o)
CPU time: 0.03 s,  Wall time: 0.06 s
sage: %time
sage: f.cone_lattice() # some calls to PALP
Finite poset containing 730 elements
CPU time: 0.18 s,  Wall time: 0.32 s
sage: %time
sage: p = Polyhedron(vertices=o.vertices().columns()) # almost all time is in cdd
CPU time: 0.02 s,  Wall time: 3.84 s
sage: %time
sage: p.face_lattice() # all time in Sage
Finite poset containing 730 elements
CPU time: 8.36 s,  Wall time: 8.36 s
```

Given the construction time of `p`, I am not even sure if calling cdd as a library will help a lot, but you mentioned that you also had some other library in mind. So while I am definitely interested in going to dimensions higher than 6, so far PALP seems to be the way to go. One possible modification for the future is to use PALP when possible and switch to alternatives when it does not work.
