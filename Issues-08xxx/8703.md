```
The patch defines several new classes for dealing with 

- rooted recursive ordered trees (labelled and not)

- binary trees (labelled and not)

It also add the computation of the binary search tree and the decreasing or increasing tree for a permutation

It finally defines the bijection to Dyck words

Yes ! There is already something in sage which is called `BinaryTree`. I
just asked for an incompatible change on
[sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/1856db31a5cc54f2?hl=fr) and

Hellooooooo Florent !

Here is a patch with some more documentation for the class. We discussed it a lot already, and there were two more things I had stored in a file while beginning the review.

Some notes before we forget :
* The symmetry_factor should not be there, and only works for RootedTrees (not OrderedDDTrees)
* What about the name itself ? I know "automorphism_group_size" is a bit long, but it woul be nice to find something more meaningful.
* And I probably already forgot what I should have written there. Well, we wll find it again `^^;`

Nathann

P.S. : I updated the combinat queue -- how unusual for me !

Hello,

Nathan, your review patch has 2 problems :

* there lacks the ticket number in the first line of the description

* there is a trailing whitespace, see the bot report for the exact location

Florent, it seems the you are using several non-existing options for DiGraph, unless these options are introduced in another ticket ?

```
DiGraph(loop=False, layout='tree', tree_root=0)
```

I guess it has to be replaced by

```
DiGraph(loops=False)
```

The patch looks very complete, thanks you!

One thing I noticed: I would like to be able to reconstruct a tree from its string representation. I.e.,

```
sage: BinaryTree("[., [[., [., .]], .]]")
```
Unfortunately, this resulted in an infinite recursion. It would be great if you could fix this.

All the combinatorial objects are currently imported (not lazily). So I'd rather switching this once for all. Also there are some problems with lazy import (see eg #10906). 

> - an_example / some_examples do not exist, so how am I supposed to get some binary tree to see what I can do with it?

For combinatorial sets the convention is element rather than example which is
for categories. Anyway, if I had forgotten, `TestSuite` would had
complained.

```
sage: BinaryTrees().an_element()
.
sage: list(BinaryTrees().some_elements())
[., [., .],
...
[., [[[., .], [[., .], .]], .]]]
```

> btw: I would be okay with folding trac_8703-additional-feature-fh.patch and

I kept thing separated to ease the review, planning to fold everything at the

<div id="comment:28" align="right">comment:28</div>

This is mostly way over my head, but I'm adding myself to cc because I'm highly interested in what comes out of this.

A bug: The as_digraph method yields not what it should yield when some labels are equal. Example:

```
sage: Q = LBT([LBT([],label=2),LBT([],label=4)],label=2) 
sage: Q.as_digraph()                                     
Digraph on 2 vertices
sage: Q
2[2[., .], 4[., .]]
```

While small examples suggest that this doesn't happen with "None" labels, this isn't actually the case (even though they somehow magically become nonnegative integers):

```
sage: Z = LabelledOrderedTree([[],[[[],[]], []]])
sage: Z   
None[None[], None[None[None[], None[]], None[]]]
sage: Z.as_digraph()
Digraph on 5 vertices
```

I suggest rewriting as_digraph from scratch, no longer using the labels as unique identifiers for nodes; independently, I think there should be more doctests checking what happens to trees with equal labels.

Some docstring gripes:

- I would add "BinaryTree([])" and "BinaryTree(None)" to the examples in te docstring of the BinaryTree class. Also, in the "INPUT" section, maybe add that [] is the same as [None, None]? I must say the "INPUT" part of the docstring for BinaryTree doesn't exactly explain to me how exactly the "children" argument is getting parsed; I am used to constructors for trees being free (in the sense of, no two different inputs lead to the same tree), so I wouldn't say this is very intuitive. It's "explained" in the `__init__` sourcecode, but that's uncommented and I have no idea what it does :(

Might also want to point out that these binary trees are planar aka what you call ordered, i. e., the order of the children on each node matters. 

- In the "show" method of BinaryTree, can the tree_orientation be passed as a keyword? I know a lot of people who don't draw trees upside down...

- I don't understand from the docstrings what "make_node" and "make_leaf" do... Just replace the tree by a node resp. leaf? If so, what's the advantage over just redefining the tree?

- Docstring for "to_dyck_word": replace "where `T(l)` and `T(r)` are the trees" by "where `T(l)` and `T(r)` are the Dyck words".

- The docstring for "canopee" has a grammar error ("`1` is a left leaf" should be "`1` if the leaf is a left leaf").

- ordered_tree.py: Isn't this kind of "ordered trees" usually called planar trees? (Not like I want anything renamed. But it might be good to point out in the docstring that these ordered trees are not, e. g., Foissy's ordered trees.)

- Couple of typos in the docstring for OrderedTree: "a constructed" and "the the order".

- This appears weird to me: "The actual canonical labelling is currently unspecified." Isn't it just the left-to-right labelling, or are you saying that we shouldn't count on it staying that way?

Suggestions (I can figure myself working on them as well):

Do we have a checker function that looks if a given labelled binary tree is a binary search tree? A decreasing tree? The RSK-like algorithms from http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0401089 ? An binary_search_tree and an increasing_tree method for arbitrary words, not just permutations? (The "gen = self[::-1]" trick won't work here anymore, though.) Oh, well, and forests, of course, even if they can be internally the same as trees with one more vertex...

Hi,

Thanks for all these comments. Before replying point by point, let me mention
that there is a lot of work done around the trees and that several patch are
waiting between this one. So we don't need to write everything in this patch
and we hope to have it in Sage soon.

When I wrote this function I plan to use it only for graph with distinct
label. I'm not sure what we want when there are repeated label. This must be
discussed. The particular case of None is by chance handled by the graph but
I'm not sure we should rely on it. In the mean time, I'd like to document that
the function currently only work for graph with disctinct label and open a new
ticket for more general cases. What do you think ?

The idea is that to allows for short input, None can be omitted where there is
no ambiguity. Please, feel free to suggest a patch for doc improvements.

When you see tree from the graph point of view, all trees are of course planar
(IE: can be embedded in the plane without crossing). So I rather call them
ordered trees. From this point of view, the proper name is plane tree (See eg
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28graph_theory%29#Plane_Tree). Note that
they freely mix plane and ordered there. I feel (and I wasn't alone when
discussed on Sage-combinat-devel) that OrderedBinaryTree is too long.

Unless a quick fix is proposed, I'd rather leave it for a forthcomming patch.

Some times it could be useful for algorithmic reason to modify a tree in place
without allocating a new object.

See my former comment on planar being improper.

Yes it is for ordered trees, but it is defined in an abtract class and soon
after this patch there is another one for rooted unordered tree. Then
left-to-right labelling doesn't mean anything. There is also another
forthcoming patch where you can specify which order you want. I don't want to
choose the default now.

There is also several other patch done around those question. In the
Sage-combinat queue there are implementation of the Loday-Ronco algebra, the
dendriform, prelie operads and more. As I said, this is just the beginning :-).

Can we have a docstring warning about this, or a _ in the function name so as to avoid people getting a wrong impression?

> The particular case of None is by chance handled by the graph

As my second example shows, we should definitely *not* rely on it. Apparently None labels get translated into 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., but this translation starts anew for every subtree, so the resulting graph isn't the one you would expect.

> In the mean time, I'd like to document that the function

Good idea.

I completely agree with you that planar/plane aren't good terms for this kind of trees. What I'd like is a mention in the docstring that these terms are occasionally used, whereas "ordered" is occasionally used for something else.

I can't wait to work with a real Loday-Ronco Hopf algebra rather than my hacky implementation from a year ago...

I think if it's just docstring, there will only be trivial rebasing. Anyway,
they must be fixed. Unfortunately, I'm moving from my flat from a new house on
Saturday and Sunday so I won't have a lot of time working on trees... If you
can take care of all the docstring problem you mentioned once for all in a

Here's something else I'm finding weird:

```
sage: a = []
sage: BinaryTree(a)
[., .]
sage: b = ()
sage: BinaryTree(b)
.
```
Or shouldn't lists and tuples behave alike here?

Hi Darij,

I looked at your files, but you seemed to have also other patches applied because I see methods in your file that are not in mine. I don't want to mess everything up, so I would prefer if you put your changes into a patch: the reason it was not working is because the right command is "hg qrefresh". Thank's for reading the doc by the way.

Also, does anyone have sage 5.8.b2 to see why it is not applying ?

I think you should
- build the main Sage branch

```
$ sage -b main
```
- and clone it

```
$ sage -clone 8703
```
- then apply the patches

```
$ cd SAGEROOT/devel/sage-8703
$ hg qimport https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8703/trac_8703-trees-fh.patch.gz
$ hg qimport https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8703/trac_8703-additional-feature-fh.patch.gz
```
You should then have everything set to work on your features...

Thanks a lot Frédéric.

I just uploaded a new version of "additional feature", it's just a small fix about the "eval" function. I was using the "eval" function to transform a string into an object, I changed it to use "litteral_eval" which is more secured (it won't eval just any python code, it is restricted to simple objects).

Once the bot is happy, is there anything else to do on this patch or can it go with "positive review" ?

 for the bot:
