Even after applying #8021, the PDF version of the reference manual for Sage 4.3.1 failed to build. This is due to non-ASCII characters in the docstring of the method `prove_BSD()` of the class `EllipticCurve_rational_field` in

```
sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py
```
Here's a snippet of the error message:

```

`LaTeX` is perfectly fine with utf8 if one uses the inputenc package:

```
\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}
```
IOW, it's the latex preamble which needs fixing.

In case you're interested in this, the documentation says

   For other languages that do not fit well into LaTeX font selection scheme, ... the outlined inputenc approach will not work. If that is the case one can try using Dominique Unruh’s option utf8x for inputenc which has a somewhat different approach and encodes many more UTF-8 characters than the standard utf8 option. However, we recommend to do so only if you really need such alphabets as there are problems with this extended approach which were precisely the reason that we decided to limit the support to what is properly supported within the boundaries of LaTeX’s font selection.

I don't know what the "problems with this extended approach" are.

I use [utf8x] on a daily basis, without issues. As you quoted above, it is well known that [utf8] supports a reduced set of characters. Not that utf8x supports arbitrary unicode characters, but I think a proper superset of those supported by utf8.

The option [utf8x] is part of latex package "ucs".

Your proposal (according to the posted patch) would be to special-case any characters not supported by [utf8] option? The patch only handles that particular letter.

> Your proposal (according to the posted patch) would be to special-case any characters not supported by [utf8] option? The patch only handles that particular letter.

It's either that or patch Sphinx -- not hard, but I'm reluctant to patch external packages if there are other alternatives.  I don't know how often we are likely to come across characters not supported by [utf8], so I don't know which option is better.

I've attached a [patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8036/trac_8036-docbuild_utf8x.patch.gz) that does this.  It appears to solve the problem in this ticket's description.

I like `trac_8036-docbuild_utf8x.patch`.  I didn't know about the `latex_elements` customization; very nice.

To the release manager: apply only `trac_8036-docbuild_utf8x.patch`.
