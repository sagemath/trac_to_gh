The two commits up to 307891b implement the original patch with one small additional rebasing edit.  This now passes all tests, but that is not saying a lot since there are very few doctests in the new code.

My next job: add docstrings and doctests.

Robert, I spent some time on this a mnth or two ago (how do you find out when a branch was last modified?) and I'm sure some of what I did will be useful -- certain, in fact, since at least one doctest revealed a bug.

What is the best way of sharing my branch with you?  There are 2 or 3 commits on top of 6.1.beta2.

> I merged your branch into mine, so you should be able to merge that in easily with whatever future work you do.

Git is not clever enough for you to lift by last commit off my own computer though.   I had one more commit with a lot of stuff.  I made a patch from it and put it in boxen:/home/cremona/8828.patch, and it might be worth looking at.

Could you please check if you agree with the changes in the new branch (which is based on yours)?  Here is a summary of the changes:

- The first commit ("reviewer patch") consists mostly of formatting changes, spelling fixes and Python style issues.  It also adds the new files to the reference manual.  Because of this I had to change one of the references [TT] to [T].  I also changed [Cremona2010] to [CT] to be more consistent.

- The documentation of the existing method `NumberField_absolute.places()` is wrong; in fact it never returns an embedding into `RIF` or `CIF`, it just uses these to determine the required precision if `prec=None`.  I have not changed the documentation; it could be done in an additional commit here or in a new ticket.  For the new method `RationalField.places()`, I just added the `prec=Infinity` option.

- For consistency, `RDF` is now used instead for all bounds (there were two places where `RR` was used).

- The two coefficients of the Laurent series of the Weierstrass p-function that are needed can be obtained more easily as suitable multiples of the usual modular forms *c*<sub>4</sub> and *c*<sub>6</sub>.

- Added documentation for the functions mentioned in [comment:32](#comment%3A32).

All tests pass, so if you are happy with the changes you can set this to positive review.

> It is indeed red; this is because the blob shows the patchbot result for the latest stable release (6.2) instead of the latest development version, and the patchbot failed to build with 6.2, for reasons unrelated to this ticket.  Clicking on the blob will give you the result of all patchbot runs; the latest patchbot build (with 6.3.beta2) succeeded and passed tests.

Yes, I saw that green one.  It makes the blob on the ticket itself rather misleading!

Please be more specific.  I don't know how to build the pdf docs for just the files created here, and a complete build (which I did do) produced such vast output that I cannot look for anything relevant in it.

This shows nothing, even after several rounds of make doc-clean and make doc-pdf etc.
The log shows that the build quits after

```
OSError: [combinat ] /home/jec/sage/src/doc/en/reference/combinat/algebra.rst:4: WARNING: toctree contains reference to nonexisting document u'sage/combinat/free_module'
```
which has nothing to do with this ticket!
