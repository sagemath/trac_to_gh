<a id='comment:21'></a>The automatic merge worked fine: the two new commits are my work + the merge commit.  This gives us a new basis for further work (adding doctests etc): I will not touch this again for 10 days or so at least!

Here is a summary of the changes:\n\n- The first commit (\"reviewer patch\") consists mostly of formatting changes, spelling fixes and Python style issues.  It also adds the new files to the reference manual.  Because of this I had to change one of the references [TT] to [T].  I also changed [Cremona2010] to [CT] to be more consistent.\n\n- The documentation of the existing method `NumberField_absolute.places()` is wrong; in fact it never returns an embedding into `RIF` or `CIF`, it just uses these to determine the required precision if `prec=None`.  I have not changed the documentation; it could be done in an additional commit here or in a new ticket.  For the new method `RationalField.places()`, I just added the `prec=Infinity` option.\n\n- For consistency, `RDF` is now used instead for all bounds (there were two places where `RR` was used).\n\n- The two coefficients of the Laurent series of the Weierstrass p-function that are needed can be obtained more easily as suitable multiples of the usual modular forms *c*<sub>4</sub> and *c*<sub>6</sub>.\n\n- Added documentation for the functions mentioned in[comment:32](#comment%3A32).\n\nAll tests pass, so if you are happy with the changes you can set this to positive review.",

<a id='comment:38'></a>Could you please check if you agree with the changes in the new branch (which is based on yours)?  Here is a summary of the changes:

- The first commit ("reviewer patch") consists mostly of formatting changes, spelling fixes and Python style issues.  It also adds the new files to the reference manual.  Because of this I had to change one of the references [TT] to [T].  I also changed [Cremona2010] to [CT] to be more consistent.

- The documentation of the existing method `NumberField_absolute.places()` is wrong; in fact it never returns an embedding into `RIF` or `CIF`, it just uses these to determine the required precision if `prec=None`.  I have not changed the documentation; it could be done in an additional commit here or in a new ticket.  For the new method `RationalField.places()`, I just added the `prec=Infinity` option.

- For consistency, `RDF` is now used instead for all bounds (there were two places where `RR` was used).

- The two coefficients of the Laurent series of the Weierstrass p-function that are needed can be obtained more easily as suitable multiples of the usual modular forms *c*<sub>4</sub> and *c*<sub>6</sub>.

- Added documentation for the functions mentioned in[comment:32](#comment%3A32).

All tests pass, so if you are happy with the changes you can set this to positive review.

It is indeed red; this is because the blob shows the patchbot result for the latest stable release (6.2) instead of the latest development version, and the patchbot failed to build with 6.2, for reasons unrelated to this ticket.

This shows nothing, even after several rounds of make doc-clean and make doc-pdf etc.
The log shows that the build quits after

```
OSError: [combinat ] /home/jec/sage/src/doc/en/reference/combinat/algebra.rst:4: WARNING: toctree contains reference to nonexisting document u'sage/combinat/free_module'
```
which has nothing to do with this ticket!
