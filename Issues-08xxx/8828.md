The two commits up to 307891b implement the original patch with one small additional rebasing edit.  This now passes all tests, but that is not saying a lot since there are very few doctests in the new code.

My next job: add docstrings and doctests.

Robert, I spent some time on this a mnth or two ago (how do you find out when a branch was last modified?) and I'm sure some of what I did will be useful -- certain, in fact, since at least one doctest revealed a bug.

What is the best way of sharing my branch with you?  There are 2 or 3 commits on top of 6.1.beta2.

Git is not clever enough for you to lift by last commit off my own computer though.   I had one more commit with a lot of stuff.  I made a patch from it and put it in boxen:/home/cremona/8828.patch, and it might be worth looking at.

I have finished workin on height.py,  adding a large amount of documentation and examples.  There were some bugs revealed by this, which have been fixed.  One was in the function `non_neg_region` and was a simple slip, I forget the details.  The second was due to wrong normalisation of period lattice basis (for real embeddings):  L.basis() gives w1, w2 with w1 real, while L.normalised_basis() gives w1,w2 with w2 minimal and tau=w1/w2 in the fundamental region.  To avoid this catching people out in future I added a method tau() to the period lattice class.  The effect here is that in some of the tests the error is now better than it was;  but also the test results (for fk and wp) are different since they work with respect to the normalised lattice [1,tau] and so are different when the correct value of tau is used!

I added more examples from the papers cited, and also give more specific references to those papers throughout, especially the paper [TT] by Nook (Thotsaphon Thonjungthug);  the theory here was developed by himself with me and Samir Siksek while Nook was our PhD student.

It seems to be four years since Robert Bradshaw implemented this (Nook himself implemented it too, in Magma) so it seem rather unreasonable to ask him to look at it again.  Peter Bruin would be a good person, since his own recent paper improves Nook's results (and makes some of this redundant perhaps?)

I will set this to "needs review" as soon as I have added a couple of missing doctests in the file `period_lattice_region.pyx` to bring the two files up to 100%.

I'm now reading the code and documentation.  Apart from a number of small spelling/typographical things (for which I'll just make a reviewer patch), there are a few functions of which the documentation is missing:
- `EllipticCurve_number_field.height_function()`
- the functions `frame_data()` and `unframe_data()` in `period_lattice_region.pyx`
By the way, I don't think my paper of last year makes any of this redundant.

Could you please check if you agree with the changes in the new branch (which is based on yours)?  Here is a summary of the changes:

- The first commit ("reviewer patch") consists mostly of formatting changes, spelling fixes and Python style issues.  It also adds the new files to the reference manual.  Because of this I had to change one of the references [TT] to [T].  I also changed [Cremona2010] to [CT] to be more consistent.

- The documentation of the existing method `NumberField_absolute.places()` is wrong; in fact it never returns an embedding into `RIF` or `CIF`, it just uses these to determine the required precision if `prec=None`.  I have not changed the documentation; it could be done in an additional commit here or in a new ticket.  For the new method `RationalField.places()`, I just added the `prec=Infinity` option.

- For consistency, `RDF` is now used instead for all bounds (there were two places where `RR` was used).

- The two coefficients of the Laurent series of the Weierstrass p-function that are needed can be obtained more easily as suitable multiples of the usual modular forms *c*<sub>4</sub> and *c*<sub>6</sub>.

- Added documentation for the functions mentioned in [comment:32](#comment%3A32).

All tests pass, so if you are happy with the changes you can set this to positive review.

It is indeed red; this is because the blob shows the patchbot result for the latest stable release (6.2) instead of the latest development version, and the patchbot failed to build with 6.2, for reasons unrelated to this ticket.

This shows nothing, even after several rounds of make doc-clean and make doc-pdf etc.
The log shows that the build quits after

```
OSError: [combinat ] /home/jec/sage/src/doc/en/reference/combinat/algebra.rst:4: WARNING: toctree contains reference to nonexisting document u'sage/combinat/free_module'
