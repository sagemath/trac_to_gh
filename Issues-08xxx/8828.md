- The first commit ("reviewer patch") consists mostly of formatting changes, spelling fixes and Python style issues.  It also adds the new files to the reference manual.  Because of this I had to change one of the references [TT] to [T].  I also changed [Cremona2010] to [CT] to be more consistent.

- The two coefficients of the Laurent series of the Weierstrass p-function that are needed can be obtained more easily as suitable multiples of the usual modular forms *c*<sub>4</sub> and *c*<sub>6</sub>.

- Added documentation for the functions mentioned in comment:32.

All tests pass, so if you are happy with the changes you can set this to positive review.

Please be more specific.  I don't know how to build the pdf docs for just the files created here, and a complete build (which I did do) produced such vast output that I cannot look for anything relevant in it.

This shows nothing, even after several rounds of make doc-clean and make doc-pdf etc.
The log shows that the build quits after

```
OSError: [combinat ] /home/jec/sage/src/doc/en/reference/combinat/algebra.rst:4: WARNING: toctree contains reference to nonexisting document u'sage/combinat/free_module'
```
which has nothing to do with this ticket!
