Currently there is no representation of univariate polynomial quotient rings in the Singular interface; it was only implemented for the multivariate case.

The attached patch implements it:

```
sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
sage: Q.<xi> = P.quo([(x^2+1)])
sage: singular(xi)
xi
sage: singular(Q)
//   characteristic : 0
//   number of vars : 1
//        block   1 : ordering lp
//                  : names    xi
//        block   2 : ordering C
// quotient ring from ideal
_[1]=xi^2+1
sage: (singular(xi)*singular(xi)).NF('std(0)')
-1
```

Mostly looks good, the only issue is that you should never "import sage" (or sage.all) from within the sage library.

Do I understand correctly:

It is OK that I do `from sage.all import singular` inside one method, but I should not do `import sage` on top of the file?

I'll submit a correction soon.

Cheers,

Simon
