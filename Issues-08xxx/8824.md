Sage should set the `__array_priority__` attribute to something very
high in its base class(es), then let the coercion model decide how
NumPy objects should be handled (in this case, coerce to RDF or CDF).

NumPy uses the custom convention that `__array_priority__` decides which
operand gets to handle the operation.

Example:

```
import numpy as np

class MagicOne:
    __array_priority__ = 1000
    def __cmp__(self, other):
        print 'MagicOne has control'
        return cmp(1, other)

one = MagicOne()

print one < np.float64(63.3)
print np.float64(63.3) < one
```
This prints

```
MagicOne has control
True
MagicOne has control
False
```

This might be a fitting place to record a wish: If Sage decides to do something with NumPy arrays (not just scalars), I think the behaviour should be something like:

```
sage: M = random_matrix(RDF, 4, 3)
sage: A = np.random.normal(size=(12, 10, 4)).astype(np.float32)
sage: type(A * M)
<type np.ndarray...>
sage: (A * M).shape
(12, 10, 3)
sage: (A * M).dtype
float64
```
I.e. let matrices be operators acting on data, operating along the vectors along the rightmost dimension (matrix on right) or leftmost dimension (matrix on left).

In particular, I think it would be very bad to coerce NumPy arrays to Sage matrices!
