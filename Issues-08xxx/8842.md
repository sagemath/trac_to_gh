```
If I write a function in a cell of a notebook like:

@interact
def foo(a = input_box(default=0, type=Integer)):
    # do something here
    pass

And the user enters something that cannot be coerced to Integer, then
I get a verbose (and rather unhelpful) exception, which, as far as I
can see, can't be caught inside of foo.  So, I would suggest that if a
type is specified in input_box, and the coercion fails that a nicer
looking message be given (perhaps next to the box that a specifies).
