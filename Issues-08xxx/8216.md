Recently the sandpile-1.51 spkg was included in the experimental components.  This ticket updates the source to version 2.2.

In addition to updating the source, the installation script has been simplified and the SPKG.txt has been improved in an effort to get this package to optional status.  

This package does depend on the 4ti2.p0 spkg, which is currently experimental.  As a separate but dependent ticket 4ti2 will be upgraded to an optional package as well to harmonize this dependency.

New package is at:
[http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhampton/sandpile-2.2.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhampton/sandpile-2.2.spkg)

Yes, I guess this does depend on 8217, although for review purposes it isn't in the sense that "sage -i 4ti2.p0" will work wether or not its experimental or optional.

What would you like the review to consist of? 

I have read the documentation and used the functions in the spkg and the sandpile.sage file. Is sandpile.sage in this spkg?

This is severely broken on Solaris, but reports it is successfully installed. One obvious problem is the use of a non-POSIX option to grep.

It would need to be able to build on Solaris before it could be incorporated into Sage

There's general information about building on Solaris at

  http://wiki.sagemath.org/solaris

 Information specifically for 't2' at

  http://wiki.sagemath.org/devel/Building-Sage-on-the-T5240-t2

 Both the source (4.3.0.1 is the latest to build on Solaris) and a binary
 which will run on any SPARC can be found at http://www.sagemath.org
 /download-source.html

I'm not sure where these grep calls are coming from, they look like the installation script uses them somehow when adding glpk and 4ti2 but it just uses "sage -i".

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:9'></a>Replying to [mhampton](#comment%3A8):\n> No, optional packages do not require a vote. \n\n\nThank you for clarification on this. \n\nSo what (if any) additional requirements are there for 'optional' as opposed to 'experimental' packages? \n\nhttp://www.sagemath.org/packages/optional/\n\ngives no warnings that the optional packages may be seriously broken, whereas 'experimental'\n\nhttp://www.sagemath.org/packages/experimental/\n\nhas in great big bold letters that **These are EXPERIMENTAL! They probably won't work at all for you! Use at your own risk! Many of these have *never* been successfully built on any platform! (But still, if you can figure out how to build them, I'd like to know about it.) These also may not be available under a GPL-compatible license**\n\n> Making a package standard does.  \n\n\nYes, I was aware of that. There would be complete chaos if not. \n\n> However, the expectations for an optional package keep rising.  I think building on Solaris is probably considered a requirement.\n\n \nI'd hope so. http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/inclusion.html says \n\n**Some Sage developers are willing to help you port to OS X, Solaris and Windows. But this is no guarantee and you or your project are expected to do the heavy lifting and also support those ports upstream if there is no Sage developer who is willing to share the burden.**\n\nI feel at the minute that I'm personally sharing too much responsibility for making sure the packages don't break on Solaris. William sends me a recent email:\n\n'''David,\n\n**(1) I couldn't get anywhere building Sage on x86 Solaris on skynet (fulvia).  Can you?  This was pretty annoying to the people that bought us fulvia.**\n\n**(2) Sun wants to know if we have a Sage available yet for t2.  See below.**\n\n**I really need to shift into the mode of actually providing something that *works* on Solaris, despite hickups, rather than just polishing foundations...**\n\nUnfortunately, without more testing on Solaris, this is just not going to happen. I'm personally not in a position to test everyones patches on Solaris. \n\n> I'm not sure where these grep calls are coming from, they look like the installation script uses them somehow when adding glpk and 4ti2 but it just uses \"sage -i\".  \n\n\nMe neither. But neither do I have the time to resolve this. A quick check on the man page for 'grep' on Linux shows the option 'o' being:\n\n```\n      -o, --only-matching\n              Print  only  the  matched  (non-empty) parts of a matching line,\n              with each such part on a separate output line.\n```\n\nI'll leave it to others to work out how to implement this in a POSIX compatible way. The POSIX options for 'grep' can be found at http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/grep.html \n\nI hope these comments are helpful, and I'll answer any questions I can, but I'm simply not in a position to sort out these issues. \n\n**PS I realise the author of this package has not requested any help on Solaris, so I'm not suggesting he is personally to blame for my frustration.**\n\nDave",

> No, optional packages do not require a vote. 


Thank you for clarification on this. 

So what (if any) additional requirements are there for 'optional' as opposed to 'experimental' packages? 

http://www.sagemath.org/packages/optional/

gives no warnings that the optional packages may be seriously broken, whereas 'experimental'

http://www.sagemath.org/packages/experimental/

has in great big bold letters that **These are EXPERIMENTAL! They probably won't work at all for you! Use at your own risk! Many of these have *never* been successfully built on any platform! (But still, if you can figure out how to build them, I'd like to know about it.) These also may not be available under a GPL-compatible license**

> Making a package standard does.  


Yes, I was aware of that. There would be complete chaos if not. 

> However, the expectations for an optional package keep rising.  I think building on Solaris is probably considered a requirement.

 
I'd hope so. http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/inclusion.html says 

**Some Sage developers are willing to help you port to OS X, Solaris and Windows. But this is no guarantee and you or your project are expected to do the heavy lifting and also support those ports upstream if there is no Sage developer who is willing to share the burden.**

I feel at the minute that I'm personally sharing too much responsibility for making sure the packages don't break on Solaris. William sends me a recent email:

'''David,

**(1) I couldn't get anywhere building Sage on x86 Solaris on skynet (fulvia).  Can you?  This was pretty annoying to the people that bought us fulvia.**

**(2) Sun wants to know if we have a Sage available yet for t2.  See below.**

**I really need to shift into the mode of actually providing something that *works* on Solaris, despite hickups, rather than just polishing foundations...**

Unfortunately, without more testing on Solaris, this is just not going to happen. I'm personally not in a position to test everyones patches on Solaris. 

> I'm not sure where these grep calls are coming from, they look like the installation script uses them somehow when adding glpk and 4ti2 but it just uses "sage -i".  


Me neither. But neither do I have the time to resolve this. A quick check on the man page for 'grep' on Linux shows the option 'o' being:

```
      -o, --only-matching
              Print  only  the  matched  (non-empty) parts of a matching line,
              with each such part on a separate output line.
```

I'll leave it to others to work out how to implement this in a POSIX compatible way. The POSIX options for 'grep' can be found at http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/grep.html 

I hope these comments are helpful, and I'll answer any questions I can, but I'm simply not in a position to sort out these issues. 

**PS I realise the author of this package has not requested any help on Solaris, so I'm not suggesting he is personally to blame for my frustration.**

Dave

It's not yet in the developers guide, but soon will be - see #9690. 

Since one requirement for optional is **sage project as a whole is responsible** I think that probably means there should be a vote. I would think that pretty much a formality, but it does not seem reasonable for others to support a package if nobody feels it's worth having.

I can work on trying to update that file, since it seems to be

Because of this, I'm marking this as "needs info", so as to

this is a useful optional package at least for some.

This bit of code is a bit dubious. First it's not a good idea to test on an empty string (though I'm aware lots of bits of Sage do it, but also there's an unnecessary semi-colon. 


```

Better would be

```

That semi-colon obviously got put in one file at one point, and has been copy/pasted to lots of spkg-install files, but it serves no useful function.
