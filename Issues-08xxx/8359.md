This patch adds a function:

```
    CoxeterGroup(cartan_type, implementation = "matrix" / "permutation")
``` 
to construct Coxeter groups. Whenever possible, the Coxeter group is constructed as a permutation group, using data from GAP3/Chevie; otherwise a Weyl group is returned, as a matrix group. An upcoming implementation is by reduced words, using the Coxeter 3 package.

Hi Jeroen,

Should we ignore jehova's patchbot failure (the log and shortlog seem empty)?

Is the plugin.startup failure a suggestion for lazy importing CoxeterGroup?

Thanks!
