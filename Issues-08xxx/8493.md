<div id="comment:0"></div>

The attached patch contains some simple code which will return the element of the Galois group of a number field corresponding to complex conjugation (at a specified complex place, or the "default" complex embedding where that exists).

The code also uses embeddings into QQbar, so I've moved QQbar over to the new coercion model (a simple case of renaming the ``__call__`` method to ``_element_constructor_``).

The new patch is actually functionally identical to the old one -- it's only one of the "context" marker lines that has changed, due to another patch changing import statements in `galois_group.py` -- so I'm taking the liberty of setting it straight back to "positive_review".

I think that's fine.  It applies cleanly to 4.4.alpha0; I'm checking doctests and will report if there are any problems.  Otherwise, it will get merged into 4.4.alpha1.
