The help message reads:

```
Usage: sage -merge [options] [ticket-number]

Tries to automate the process of merging tickets in release management.
See http://wiki.sagemath.org/devel/ReleaseManagement for more info.

Example usage:

sage -merge -c or sage -merge --candidates

    * List all candidates for merging, i.e. all trac tickets with positive review. 

sage -merge <ticket_number> <options>

    * Download patches from trac for the given ticket number, merge them, run tests, and report the results. 

sage -merge -a <options> or sage -merge --all <options>

    * For each ticket on trac with a positive review, download the patches, apply them, and run doctests. At the end, report which tickets passed, which failed, and which didn't have any files to doctest (as is commonly the case with tickets for new spkg's). 


Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a, --all             For each ticket on trac with a positive review,
                        download, apply, and test each. At the end, report
                        which pass, fail, and have no files to doctest
  -c, --candidates      List all candidates for merging, i.e., all trac
                        tickets with positive review
  -v, --verbose         Display the results of each test
  -n NUM_THREADS, --num-threads=NUM_THREADS
                        Number of threads to work with
  -r REPOSITORY, --repository=REPOSITORY
                        Which repository to apply to. Choices: ['bin',
                        'extcode', 'sage', 'examples', 'scripts', 'main']
  -t TEST, --test=TEST  What things to doctest. Choices: ['none', 'files',
                        'directory', 'long'] or any prefix of a choice.
  -o, --overwrite       Whether to overwrite files when downloading.
  -d DIRECTORY, --directory=DIRECTORY
                        Directory to store patches in.

  Behavior:
    Behavior after merging. Default is to pop after merging

    -l, --leave-in-queue
                        Leaves the patches in mercurial queue. Conflicts with
                        --finish.
    -f, --finish        Performs qfinish, commiting the patches. Conflicts
                        with --leave-in-queue.
