As the subject says. Currently, the coverage of `sage/logic/logic.py` in Sage 4.4 is:

```

Missing documentation:

Functions `simplify`, `combine` and `prove` are actually not implemented: the code is a stub. Patch ` sage-issue-8790-not-implemented.diff` provides a docstring stating that.

I'm not sure how doctests should be provided here: one could probably change the code to raise a `NotImplemented` exception and look for that in the doctest.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Attachment [sage-issue-8790-module-private-funcs.diff](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket8790/sage-issue-8790-module-private-funcs.diff) by @riccardomurri created at 2013-08-25 11:51:49

The `get_bits`, `eval_*`, `reduce_*` and `tokenize` functions are
explictly described as "for internal use only".  It is inconvenient to
provide a doctest for them, as arguments are the internal
data structures used in the `SymbolicLogic` class.  

Patch ` sage-issue-8790-module-private-funcs.diffâ€‹`
renames the functions to begin with an underscore to make their
non-public nature more evident, in the hope to silence the coverage
warning.
