As the subject says. Currently, the coverage of `sage/logic/logic.py` in Sage 4.4 is:

```
[mvngu@sage sage-4.4]$ ./sage -coverage devel/sage-main/sage/logic/logic.py 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
devel/sage-main/sage/logic/logic.py
ERROR: Please add a `TestSuite(s).run()` doctest.
SCORE devel/sage-main/sage/logic/logic.py: 16% (3 of 18)

Missing documentation:
 * combine(self, statement1, statement2):   see #15262
 * simplify(self, table):
 * prove(self, statement):


Missing doctests:
 * get_bit(x, c):
 * eval(toks):
 * eval_ltor_toks(lrtoks):
 * reduce_bins(lrtoks):
 * reduce_monos(lrtoks):
 * eval_mon_op(args):
 * eval_bin_op(args):
 * eval_and_op(lval, rval):
 * eval_or_op(lval, rval):
 * eval_ifthen_op(lval, rval):
 * eval_iff_op(lval, rval):
 * tokenize(s, toks):
```
This needs to be coordinated with #8797.

Functions `simplify`, `combine` and `prove` are actually not implemented: the code is a stub. Patch ` sage-issue-8790-not-implemented.diff` provides a docstring stating that.

I'm not sure how doctests should be provided here: one could probably change the code to raise a `NotImplemented` exception and look for that in the doctest.

The `get_bits`, `eval_*`, `reduce_*` and `tokenize` functions are
explictly described as "for internal use only".  It is inconvenient to
provide a doctest for them, as arguments are the internal
data structures used in the `SymbolicLogic` class.  

Patch ` sage-issue-8790-module-private-funcs.diffâ€‹`
renames the functions to begin with an underscore to make their
non-public nature more evident, in the hope to silence the coverage
warning.
