I was the one who made Eisenstein series "work" over arbitrary fields.  It turns out that I didn't do a very good job, and you don't have to go very far to break it:

A side note: the workaround at the end of the method is not necessary any more, and can be removed.

This bug appears to be gone in sage-4.6.  I'm not sure at what point it was fixed, but it was most likely when Martin Raum or David Loeffler touched the code recently.

In any case, I am attaching a mini-patch with a doctest that verifies that it is fixed.

This has been indeed fixed by David from what I see in googlecodes, and he also added the doctest right before yours. It's a good a idea to introduce another explicit test and it won't cost much time. So this gets a positive review.
