<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

It builds fine, and Gap seems to work.   The major workspaces issue seems gone.    Bravo!  Thanks to Steve Linton and dimpase!

The repo needs to have its changed checked in:

```
wstein@iras:~/screen/iras/sage-4.3.1/gap-4.4.12.p2> ../sage -hg status
M .hgignore
M SPKG.txt
? patches/saveload.patch
wstein@iras:~/screen/iras/sage-4.3.1/gap-4.4.12.p2>
```

This needs an `hg ci`.

The changes to the spkg look fine.  I'm guess I'm OK with the comment "(not using the usual patches/* procedure, as this is an upstream patch.)", though I would personally never do things that way -- to me src/ should be pristine.    

I give this a positive review, subject to the other doctests in the core Sage library being fixed to reflect the new package update, e.g., things like

```
wstein@iras:~/screen/iras/sage-4.3.1> ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/interfaces/gap.py 
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/gap.py"

it could be, but this is a new version of the spkg's in question, that
in particular incorporated a new patch by Steve Linton and fixed the stopper problem (crashes on Linux ia64 that occured with
previous spkg vesrions)

I am about to open up a new trac ticket with a grand patch fixing the doctrings
affected.

Something is wrong with the package [gap-4.4.12.p2.spkg](http://www1.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~dima/tmp/gap-4.4.12.p2.spkg). First, all changes are not checked in:

```
[mvngu@sage gap-4.4.12.p2]$ hg st
M .hgignore
M SPKG.txt
```
Second, the directory `patches/` must be under revision control, so the file `.hgignore` must not contain the line `patches/`:

```
[mvngu@sage gap-4.4.12.p2]$ cat .hgignore 
src/
patches/
```
Third, I can't check anything in:

```
[mvngu@sage gap-4.4.12.p2]$ hg ci

abort: data/.hgignore.i@bc8f0f49e4a4: no node!
```
Am I using the correct version of the spkg to be updated?

The question is which version is "right". Gap 4.4.12 was never a part of Sage,
so perhaps the proper package name is
gap-4.4.12.spkg ?

If yes, can I just wipe out .hg directory there and re-initialise hg ?

It's better to use the files located at
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/
rather than at http://www1.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~dima/tmp/
(the connection is not always stable, etc. http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/
contains copies of spkg's on http://www1.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~dima/tmp/)

Well, the .hg/ broke down, as you have noticed.
So I wiped it out. 
Now I copied .hg/ from gap-4.4.10.p13.spkg
and merged the changes there. Please check the updated spkg file.

> * The changelog `SPKG.txt` does not conform to the requirements as documented in the [Developer's Guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_spkgs.html#the-file-spkg-txt).

This seems to apply fine and pass the same tests as before. at least on a mac 10.6.2. Again, I guess I leave this to Minh to give a positive review.

Someone reading the changelog of the GAP spkg would come across this snippet:

```
=== gap-4.4.12.p2 (Dima Pasechnik, 2010-1-25) ===

 * Added .hgignore.
 *  Applied Steve Linton's Itanium patch to GAP_ROOT/src/saveload.c
   (not using the usual patches/* procedure, as this is
   an upstream patch.)
 *  Removed a stray binary file "patch" at the top level.
 *  Replaced $LN, $MKDIR, etc as done in gap-4.4.10.p13 (see below)

=== gap-4.4.12.p0 (David Joyner, 2009-6-17) ===

Upgraded to gap-4.4.12. Removed guava compilation. From the source
GAP tarball, removed tomlib, small, prim, trans.
```
and wonder what happened to `gap-4.4.12.p1`. The updated spkg is OK by me, but I have changed its name to `gap-4.4.12.p1` and its changelog now reads:

```
=== gap-4.4.12.p1 (Dima Pasechnik, 2010-1-25) ===
 * See ticket #8076 for full details.
 * Added .hgignore.
 * Applied Steve Linton's Itanium patch to GAP_ROOT/src/saveload.c
   (not using the usual patches/* procedure, as this is
   an upstream patch.)
 *  Removed a stray binary file "patch" at the top level.
 *  Replaced $LN, $MKDIR, etc as done in gap-4.4.10.p13 (see below)

 * Upgraded to gap-4.4.12. Removed guava compilation. From the source

```
