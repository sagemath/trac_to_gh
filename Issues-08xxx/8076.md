<a id='comment:1'></a>It builds fine, and Gap seems to work.   The major workspaces issue seems gone.    Bravo!  Thanks to Steve Linton and dimpase!

The repo needs to have its changed checked in:

```
wstein@iras:~/screen/iras/sage-4.3.1/gap-4.4.12.p2> ../sage -hg status
M .hgignore
M SPKG.txt
? patches/saveload.patch
wstein@iras:~/screen/iras/sage-4.3.1/gap-4.4.12.p2>
```

This needs an `hg ci`.

The changes to the spkg look fine.  I'm guess I'm OK with the comment "(not using the usual patches/* procedure, as this is an upstream patch.)", though I would personally never do things that way -- to me src/ should be pristine.    

I give this a positive review, subject to the other doctests in the core Sage library being fixed to reflect the new package update, e.g., things like

```
wstein@iras:~/screen/iras/sage-4.3.1> ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/interfaces/gap.py 
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/gap.py"

it could be, but this is a new version of the spkg's in question, that
in particular incorporated a new patch by Steve Linton and fixed the stopper problem (crashes on Linux ia64 that occured with
previous spkg vesrions)

I am about to open up a new trac ticket with a grand patch fixing the doctrings
affected.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Replying to [mvngu](#comment%3A12):

The question is which version is "right". Gap 4.4.12 was never a part of Sage,
so perhaps the proper package name is
gap-4.4.12.spkg ?

If yes, can I just wipe out .hg directory there and re-initialise hg ?

It's better to use the files located at
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/
rather than at http://www1.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~dima/tmp/
(the connection is not always stable, etc. http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/
contains copies of spkg's on http://www1.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~dima/tmp/)

That's correct, I just changed the hg-related files, and updated the trac ticket descriptions. 

I changed URLs there, so now they point to the files on boxen in my
account there, rather than to anything else. But this is just administration, the code did not change. I imagine there would be more testing done when they go into a Sage pre-release, and you have already tested the updated gap_packages spkg.

I picked up the package made by wdj and did a bit of fixing.
None of p0, p1 ever made it to Sage.

Well, the .hg/ broke down, as you have noticed.
So I wiped it out. 
Now I copied .hg/ from gap-4.4.10.p13.spkg
and merged the changes there. Please check the updated spkg file.
