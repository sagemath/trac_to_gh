The default polynomials chosen by Sage to perform arithmetic over
GF(2**n) have sometimes Hamming weight 7 or more, which is not optimal.
Consider for example:

```
sage: T.<a> = GF(2^211)
sage: T.modulus()
x^211 + x^9 + x^6 + x^5 + x^3 + x + 1

def bar(n):
   f = a
   for i in range(n):
      f = f^2
   return f

sage: %timeit bar(10000)
5 loops, best of 3: 88.5 ms per loop
```
With the following pentanomial, we get a nice speedup:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(2))
sage: T.<a> = GF(2^211,name='a',modulus=x^211 + x^11 + x^10 + x^8 + 1)

sage: %timeit bar(10000)
5 loops, best of 3: 57.3 ms per loop
```

thanks for the explanation. Would it make sense to have an option GF(p<sup>n</sup>,minimalWeight=true)
to produce a polynomial of minimal weight?

great! A few remarks before a complete review: (i) it would be best to write Conway instead of
conway (maybe except for the option name, if small letters are mandatory); (ii) I get an error
for 2<sup>n</sup> for 2 <= n <= 15:

```

Agreed. I modified the docstring, but didn't touch the conway_polynomial functions (and therefore the RuntimeError).

(ii) I get an error
> for 2<sup>n</sup> for 2 <= n <= 15:


This is expected, that's why I specified implemented with NTL.
For smaller fields, Sage uses Givaro.
The options available for creating fields with Givaro, NTL and Pari are different. Another ticket should probably be opened to add some consistency.

I'm not sure we can let this patch in, which might break some code doing
`T.<a> = GF(q, modulus='conway')`. If the limit for smaller fields is
documented somewhere, I suggest you disable the new options in that case,
and document it in GF?.

This won't break anything because the option modulus='conway' is new as well.

The limit for the different implementations is documented at the begining of the file finite_field.py
(see http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/rings/finite_field.html )

Finally, I opened another ticket (#8220) you might review after this one:

* it cleans the code and the documentation for finite field creation;
* modulus = 'conway' and modulus = 'random' are available for all implementations;
* modulus = 'minimal_weight' is available for all binary fields;
* it adds modulus = 'first_lexicographic' for all binary fields.

PS: a related question is the following over GF(2): when no irreducible trinomial exists for a 
given degree n, instead of using a pentanomial, one can use an "almost irreducible" trinomial,
i.e., a trinomial x<sup>n+d</sup>+x<sup>s</sup>+1 which has an irreducible factor of degree n. For example for
n=211, x<sup>214</sup>+x<sup>103</sup>+1 works. I tried this with QuotientRing, but it is much slower:

```
R.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(2),x)
T.<x> = QuotientRing(R, x^214 + x^103 + 1)

def bar(n):
   f = x
   for i in range(n):
      f = f^2
   return f
sage: %timeit bar(10000)
10 loops, best of 3: 191 ms per loop
```
