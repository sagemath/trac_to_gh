The patch should apply cleanly to SageNB 0.7.4 (cf. #8051), which will be part of Sage 4.3.2.  But it may also work with SageNB 0.6.

I've tested this on 4.3.1 with SageNB 0.7.4 (cf. #8051).  It behaves as expected with patch applied (and behavior reverts when I pop it off).  This is a big help with rendering my textbook-conversion experiments.  Thanks for the help.

Positive review.
