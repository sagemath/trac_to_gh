Here is a patch containing the function Graph.steiner_tree.

It consists in finding in a graph, given a set S of vertices, a tree in G of minimum weight/cardinality containing the vertices from S. 

Everything is explained in the docstrings anyway :-)

I don't think spanning tree is linear: the standard method is a BFS/DFS, which is still worst case quadratic. I know this is no longer relevant here, but I want to make sure I have this right. If you do know of a linear time spanning tree algorithm, I'm curious about it.

That's what I call linear -- not according to the the number of vertices, but according to the size of the input : n+m :-)
