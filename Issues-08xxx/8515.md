## Hardware & associated software

* Sun Blade 1000
* 2 x 900 MHz UltraSPARC III+ CPUs
* 2 GB RAM
* Solaris 10 03/2005 (first release of Solaris 10)
* gcc 4.4.3 (uses Sun linker and assembler)

 == Sage version ==
* 4.3.4.alpha1
* Patch #8509 removing the -o option to grep to allow optional packages to install. 

This builds fully on Solaris 10, and passes all doc tests. This is the first version of Sage to do this.
