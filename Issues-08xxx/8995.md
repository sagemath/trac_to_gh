See the thread by Dennis Watson here:

In particular, some tinymce javascript files were trying to download from a URL that included the username, like:

http://sagenb.org/home/usernamewith@/javascript/tiny_mce/langs/en.js

dimpase just pointed out that #11343 is a dup of this.  However, there is a lot more discussion there, as well as a patch, so I'm recommending this be the one closed.  I'm copying the description material above there.
