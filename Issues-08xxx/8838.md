A convention we have is that graphics commands do the right thing depending on if 2d or 3d input is passed.  We should make arrow() take 3-tuples to produce a 3d plot (by calling arrow3d).

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

This looks great.  However, for backwards compatibility, could you name the arguments to arrow() "tailpoint" and "headpoint".  Now, this command won't work, whereas before it would:

```
arrow(tailpoint=(0,1), headpoint=(2,3))
```

We should keep our API unless there is a very good reason to change it.
