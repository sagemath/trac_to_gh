A convention we have is that graphics commands do the right thing depending on if 2d or 3d input is passed.  We should make arrow() take 3-tuples to produce a 3d plot (by calling arrow3d).

In other words, this should work:

```
sage: arrow(vector([1,2,3]), vector([2,3,4]))
```

and should draw a 3d arrow.

here is a patch that changes the behavior of arrow() to be more like line().  

If 2d coordinates are passed, arrow() returns an arrow2d() (the old arrow() function).  If 3d coordinates are passed, arrow() will now return an arrow3d().

This looks great.  However, for backwards compatibility, could you name the arguments to arrow() "tailpoint" and "headpoint".  Now, this command won't work, whereas before it would:

```
arrow(tailpoint=(0,1), headpoint=(2,3))
```

We should keep our API unless there is a very good reason to change it.
