```
After this patch, QQ,ZZ,... inherit properly from categories: 

```
sage: QQ.category()
Category of fields
sage: TestSuite(QQ).run()
```

This patch also documents the following effect discovered by TestSuite:

```
    sage: CDF = ComplexDoubleField()
    sage: x = CDF.an_element()
    sage: x
    1.0*I
    sage: x*x, x**2, x*x == x**2
    (-1.0, -1.0 + 1.22460635382e-16*I, False)
```
This effect won't be touched by this patch. Should anyone consider this as a bug, please open a new ticket.
