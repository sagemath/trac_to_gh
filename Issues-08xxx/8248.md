When an isogeny is constructed from a kernel polynomial, by default (unless check=False) it is checked whether the given kernel polynomial divides the appropriate division polynomial.  This is expensive when the degree is large (e.g. 163!).

We provide a small patch which does this checking more efficiently.

The example in the patch which now takes 20s, used to take many minutes.

Applies fine to 4.3.3.aplha0.
All tests pass. (execpt heegner.py, which has nothing to do with this patch).

Thanks, John, for this improvement.

Chris.
