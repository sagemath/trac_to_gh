When an isogeny is constructed from a kernel polynomial, by default (unless check=False) it is checked whether the given kernel polynomial divides the appropriate division polynomial.  This is expensive when the degree is large (e.g. 163!).

We provide a small patch which does this checking more efficiently.

The example in the patch which now takes 20s, used to take many minutes.

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
Applies fine to 4.3.3.aplha0.
All tests pass. (execpt heegner.py, which has nothing to do with this patch).

Thanks, John, for this improvement.

Chris.
