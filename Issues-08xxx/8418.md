Hello Julien ! Thanks for this new function that will be really helpful ! I have some minor comments, though.

1. When using the notation `u[i,j]` with Latex formatting, it is better not to put `[i,j]` in index position.

2. There is a typo in IMPUT.

3. Since the output is a directed graph, I would put "digraph" instead of "a graph". The "a" is not necessary and "digraph" is more precise.

4. You should put some text between your example blocks, to explain what you're doing and what you want to show. For instance, between blocks 1 and 2, you could write "For the Fibonacci word..." and between blocks 2 and 3, something like "It works also for periodic words.". Note that this is optional, it just helps the user to understand how you would use the function.

Short of that, your code looks good. Next time will probably be a positive review !

I am adding some more comments :

5. There is two blankline after EXAMPLES:: (one is enough).

6. The last :: is not necessary.

7. I would replace the UNICODE characters in references by simple ascii characters.

8. I would put the line "# In this case, the Rauzy graph is simply a cycle." on the line after inside the indentation.

9. I would try to remove the utilisation of the function "Word" inside of the function. This creates a dependance that we want to avoid.

10. 

The following result seem broken. There should be 3 edges :

```
sage: w = words.FibonacciWord()[:100]
sage: h = w.reduced_rauzy_graph(9)
sage: for e in h.edges(): print e
(word: 001010010, word: 010010100, word: 010100)
(word: 010010100, word: 001010010, word: 10)
```

Once it is fixed. This example should be added to the documentation.

There is maybe a last remark I have... Sorry if I'm being over-meticulous. While I was looking at the INPUT block, I noticed that "integer" was not a precise enough explanation of the parameter `n`.

Then I tried it on the word `aba` with `n = 0` and it yielded a graph of one vertex and two edges having labels `word: a` and `word: b`. Is that what we want ?

Anyway, the last thing that needs to be done would be to be more precise about `n`. Is it a positive integer (we don't want `0`) or a non negative integer (we want `0`) ? Moreover, we need to specify what `n` means. It is the order of the reduced rauzy graph, i.e. the length of the considered factors.

Julien, if you want to make the changes, make sure you create another patch that applies on top of Sébastien's.
