Hi,

I'm new to development and thought this patch looked like a good place to start. I got the same error message as Nathann. Is this patch still receiving attention?

By commenting on the ticket, it does. ;-)

Though I personally currently have no time for it. Feel free to review it / upload a reviewer patch and we'll see...

P.S.: If the current patch doesn't apply cleanly, the ticket's status should be set to "needs work" until the patch has been rebased.

Positive review, though there was one test timeout failure which passed when isolated from --testall.

--testall --long led to 

```
sage -t  --long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/modular/ssmod/ssmod.py"
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! PROCESS KILLED! *** ***
```

I isolated this test, it passed:

```
07:36:53johnthurber~/sage/sage-4.6$ sage -t  --long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/modular/ssmod/ssmod.py"
sage -t --long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/modular/ssmod/ssmod.py"
	 [276.0 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 276.0 seconds
