By commenting on the ticket, it does. ;-)

Though I personally currently have no time for it. Feel free to review it / upload a reviewer patch and we'll see...

P.S.: If the current patch doesn't apply cleanly, the ticket's status should be set to "needs work" until the patch has been rebased.

patch failed, rejects left in working dir
errors during apply, please fix and refresh trac_8792-booleval-clean-ups-2.patch
```

I wondered if it was my download technique, but I've tried it a couple of ways, including 

```
hg qimport http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/8792/trac_8792-booleval-clean-ups.patch
```

so, unless someone has another suggestion, I will go ahead and suggest this needs to be rebased.

Hi,

I figured it out.  jthurber is using hg version 1.6, whereas Sage uses hg version 1.3.  With 1.6 the algorithm for accepting hunks has been tightened (surely a good thing!) and the patch fails to apply, whereas it does apply with hg version 1.3.

Positive review, though there was one test timeout failure which passed when isolated from --testall.

--testall --long led to 

```
sage -t  --long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/modular/ssmod/ssmod.py"
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! PROCESS KILLED! *** ***
```

I isolated this test, it passed:

```
07:36:53johnthurber~/sage/sage-4.6$ sage -t  --long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/modular/ssmod/ssmod.py"
sage -t --long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/modular/ssmod/ssmod.py"
	 [276.0 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 276.0 seconds
}}
