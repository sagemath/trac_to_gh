i hope that's the correct place to point out some ideas i have:
(at least, i found them
very useful to know when i coded something recently)

1. reduce will be part of the functools module in python 3. might be
helpful to import it from there to make it forward compatible
http://docs.python.org/library/functools.html <- or at least you might
wanna add a link to that module in the bottom section.

2. http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html#itertools.starmap is
quite cool if you have "izip"ed values for the function arguments.
i.e.
starmap(pow, [(2,5), (3,2), (10,3)]) --> 32 9 1000. it's like f(a,b) vs. f(*c)

3. Besides that, have you explained the generator concept with the
"yield" keyword? I'm not sure if that counts as functional programming
but it is a nice topic in that context.
