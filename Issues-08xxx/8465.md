<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

i hope that's the correct place to point out some ideas i have:
(at least, i found them
very useful to know when i coded something recently)

1. reduce will be part of the functools module in python 3. might be
helpful to import it from there to make it forward compatible
http://docs.python.org/library/functools.html <- or at least you might
wanna add a link to that module in the bottom section.

2. http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html#itertools.starmap is
quite cool if you have "izip"ed values for the function arguments.
i.e.
starmap(pow, [(2,5), (3,2), (10,3)]) --> 32 9 1000. it's like f(a,b) vs. f(*c)

3. Besides that, have you explained the generator concept with the
"yield" keyword? I'm not sure if that counts as functional programming
but it is a nice topic in that context.

Here is a new patch.  This removes the file `Makefile` and adds `group_theory` and a descriptive sentence to `index.rst`.

As far as the comments above, they are beyond the scope of this ticket.  The point of this ticket was to move the file `functional_programming.rst` from the constructions document to the thematic tutorials document.  I think that some of the comments have some merit, but they involve revising that document.  I've opened #9612 for those revisions.

So I'm returning this to "needs review".  I'm actually happy with the original ticket, so the only things that need reviewing are the changes I made to index.rst, as well as the removal of Makefile.

So just little work needed (dangling reference).

Thanks though for fixing this "eternal" error... ;-)
