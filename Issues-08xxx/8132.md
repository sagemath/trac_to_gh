This seems to be an excellent and extremely welcomed collection of docstring fixes related to solving differential equations in Sage.

 Am I missing something or is it odd that calculus/desolver is not listed http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/modindex.html? Using
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/sage_manuals.html#building-the-manuals
I see how to rebuild the manual but how do I see what the changes in the patch look like if 
desolver isn't even in the manual in the first place?

Can a patch be added to include desolver in the manual?

Fixed thanks. Thanks for the links how to do it.
Two new chapters are at the end of Symbolic Calculus.

PDF manual does not build, partly due to #8036, patly due to another problem not related to this ticket (unknown command \cross used in some file related to polynomials). The ODE part of PDF manual looks good, anyway.

Html version looks good for me.

Three patches apply fine to 4.3.2.a0 and passes sage -testall, except for apparently unrelated failures already reported, on a mac 10.6.2.

Very nice docstring patch Robert!

Positive review.
