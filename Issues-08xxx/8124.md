I forgot to include this function in my big S-units and S-class groups patch.

I've tested on my laptop and on sage.math, so I think this passes on 32 and 64 bit systems.

Would it be much more work to make this function to give back a finite abelian group ? In the long run, we should make sure that these sort of functions return groups. It may be better to try get the correct type from the beginning as not to break later things that use it.

It looks like someone has already fixed the issue John's patch here fixes, so the release manager should merge the original patch.

If there are no objections, I will remove the second patch.

Actually, it looks like someone changed this to `\times` in rc0, so I've updated the patch to change `\times` instead of `\cross` to `*`.

Patch  trac_8124-selmer-nf.review.patch applies fine to 4.3.2.alpha1 and tests pass and doc build ok!

The tag was already at review, and I'm happy to leave it there.

That should have said "positive review".

I checked that this applies fine to 4.3.2 + #8184 spkg & patches + #8155 patches;  all tests pass (on 64-bit).
