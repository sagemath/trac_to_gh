I forgot to include this function in my big S-units and S-class groups patch.

I've tested on my laptop and on sage.math, so I think this passes on 32 and 64 bit systems.

It looks like someone has already fixed the issue John's patch here fixes, so the release manager should merge the original patch.

If there are no objections, I will remove the second patch.

Actually, it looks like someone changed this to `\times` in rc0, so I've updated the patch to change `\times` instead of `\cross` to `*`.

Patch  trac_8124-selmer-nf.review.patch applies fine to 4.3.2.alpha1 and tests pass and doc build ok!

The tag was already at review, and I'm happy to leave it there.

That should have said "positive review".
