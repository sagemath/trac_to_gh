If K is an unramified extension of Qp, there should be a function that computes the canonical Witt p-Frobenius:

```
sage: K.<a> = Qp(25)
sage: a.witt_frobenius()
???
```

Here's a new patch with the docstrings straightened out and trailing whitespace removed. I've also added a doctest to show that an error is raised when "frobenius" is called on an element of a ramified extension. I'm happy with the rest of the code, so if David's happy with my changes we can call this that's a positive review.
