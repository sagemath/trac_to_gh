The bot is not happy: one doctest is missing in dynamics/interval_exchanges/constructors.py

I also complains about the startup, but I do no know what to do about that..

Let me try to do something for this ticket.

Here is a new patch, that **only** moves the files from "combinat/iet" to a new folder "dynamics".

This has been done by starting with the code in 5.10.beta3. So there is something lost, which is the refactoring of datatype.

But it pass all tests.

Well, I did not now about hg mv.

I have done a lot of work to make the re-location function, including some work on the toc-trees that was rather painful.

And I has also taken the opportunity to 
- put all the raise syntax into python3 form
- correct orthographic errors
- make the code much closer to pep8 level
- removed unused import statements
- make the desired separation into interval_exchanges and flat_surfaces

I spent a few **hours** today on that, and I have already spent a lot of time on this ticket some **months** ago, but nobody did react at that time.

So, given that all tests pass **now**, it would be great if my work is not lost again.

You can quickly recreate your patch using `hg mv` as follow:

- With your patch applied, backup the files that have been moved/modified
- Unapply the patch
- Replay the moving the files using `hg mv`
- Reinstate the backed-up files on top of it.
- hg qnew a new patch with those, and discard the other one.

You might want to actually do two patches, one with just the moving,
and the other with the changes.

Btw: thanks Frédéric for all the hard work you are doing lately
(cleaning, reviewing and more ...)!

Cheers,
                                 Nicolas

There is even an option

```
hg mv --after
```
which allows one to mark the move after it has happened. But it doesn't work well with queues, as a patch which has been `qrefresh`ed is considered committed. So you need a non-committed version of the patch: apply the patch "by hand" using `patch -p1 <x.patch`, then `hg mv --after`, then `hg commit` should work (but I haven't really tried).

ok, here it is. It seems that my doc framework is now completely broken (I have by mistake removed the output directory and now docbuild complains a lot about intersphinx and missing files), so I do not know if the doc is ok.

Never use `assert` to check user input, use `raise TypeError()` or other exceptions for that.
An `AssertionError` appearing in a public function is by definition a bug.

Example:

```

here is patch that

* removes all "assert" statements, using some "raise xxxError()" instead

* makes an effort to doctest more of the "raise xxxError()"

There remains to make sure all "raise" are doctested, but I would prefer to keep that for another ticket, given the age of this one.

Needs review
