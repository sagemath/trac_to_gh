<a id='comment:21'></a>Let me try to do something for this ticket.

Here is a new patch, that **only** moves the files from "combinat/iet" to a new folder "dynamics".

This has been done by starting with the code in 5.10.beta3. So there is something lost, which is the refactoring of datatype.

But it pass all tests.

<a id='comment:25'></a>Well, I did not now about hg mv.

I have done a lot of work to make the re-location function, including some work on the toc-trees that was rather painful.

And I has also taken the opportunity to 
- put all the raise syntax into python3 form
- correct orthographic errors
- make the code much closer to pep8 level
- removed unused import statements
- make the desired separation into interval_exchanges and flat_surfaces

I spent a few **hours** today on that, and I have already spent a lot of time on this ticket some **months** ago, but nobody did react at that time.

So, given that all tests pass **now**, it would be great if my work is not lost again.

I will have a closer look **right now** at your patch. Nevertheless patchbot complains (blue color instead of green) because the doctest framework now wants "....:" instead of "..." in multiline doctests.

You can quickly recreate your patch using `hg mv` as follow:

- With your patch applied, backup the files that have been moved/modified
- Unapply the patch
- Replay the moving the files using `hg mv`
- Reinstate the backed-up files on top of it.
- hg qnew a new patch with those, and discard the other one.

You might want to actually do two patches, one with just the moving,
and the other with the changes.

Btw: thanks Frédéric for all the hard work you are doing lately
(cleaning, reviewing and more ...)!

Cheers,
                                 Nicolas

<a id='comment:39'></a>Never use `assert` to check user input, use `raise TypeError()` or other exceptions for that.
An `AssertionError` appearing in a public function is by definition a bug.

Example:

```
sage: QuadraticStratum("foo")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

<a id='comment:40'></a>here is patch that

* removes all "assert" statements, using some "raise xxxError()" instead

* makes an effort to doctest more of the "raise xxxError()"

There remains to make sure all "raise" are doctested, but I would prefer to keep that for another ticket, given the age of this one.

Needs review
