Here is the thread:

Incidentally, it's almost a year since this was deprecated, #5413. Maybe we can remove the deprecation message for good. :)

Burcin, I agree with your observation that the shortcut notation has now been deprecated for a long time. However the shortcut notation has not actually been disabled yet. Perhaps the warning should stay until that has happened.

```
Maybe, but that message is not so helpful.  I guarantee you that you don't need to know the history of Sage to do

sage: f=x^2
sage: f(2)

and expect 4.  You just need to attend an insufficiently pedantic algebra or calculus lecture :)
