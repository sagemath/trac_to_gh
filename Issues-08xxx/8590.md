There is a failure in the test of the file

sage.categories.hopf_algebras_with_basis

The problem occurs during the test suite of an hopf algebra and returns the error

```
   RuntimeError: `A` still using old coercion framework
```

I am unfortunately not able to solve really this problem, but, if the competent people have no time right now, I can write a small patch predicting the error in the test so that the tests pass
