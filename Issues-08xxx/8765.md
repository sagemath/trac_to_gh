Much room for extensions, e.g.: ;-)

* accept (also) list of symbols of arbitrary alphabet
  (type should be checked anyway)
* binary file (stream) I/O..., with or without encoding table
* **generate** encoding/decoding functions

There's actually a possible application within Sage itself: compression of prime_pi and nth_prime tables. (The table-based functions are still work in progress.)

OT:
- I could perhaps contribute FAX G3 en/decoding, too, if I'm able to find my dead old implementation... :)
- Another nice thing is encoding and decoding of machine instructions (assembling, disassembling).

Hi, I only had a very quick look and I'm a bit concerned about where to put this code in the library.

`sage.coding` is about channel coding (error correcting code) but this ticket is about source coding (data compression) and I think it's a bad idea to mix those in the library and in the doc.

I would feel a lot more confortable with `sage.coding.source_coding.huffman`.

Try putting a comment in that `__init__.py` file. For example, the content of that init file might be:

# Just a comment so that __init__.py is not an empty file.

We *should* do that before giving a positive review, I guess... :)

> Are the other reviewers satisfied with the changes in this last patch?

There are still typos in the description:

* s/occurence/occurrence/
* s/frquency/frequency/
* s/its its/its/ (two times)
* s/occurencies/occurrences/ (two times)
* s/eah/each/

`encoding_table()`:
  s/each letter/each trained letter/

`__init__`:
  It's not tested if **both** `string` and `frequencies` are given (=> error).

And as I said before I'd prefer type checks on the parameters (rather than relying on *automatically* raised exceptions later in the code).

I also prefer having the return type documented at the top rather than (more or less) implicitly in the examples (e.g. in `frequency_table()`; `tree()` actually returns a `DiGraph` which happens to also be a tree.)


Doctests?

(Still haven't tested the code, just read the patches, sorry.)

The patch [trac_8765-huffman.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8765/trac_8765-huffman.patch) replaces the earlier one [trac_8765.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8765/trac_8765.patch). Now the Huffman module is in the directory `source_coding/`. Nothing has changed in the replacement patch, except for changes to get Sage to recognize this new module.

Changes in the reviewer patch include:

1. Add substantially more documentation to the module.
2. Clean-ups in accordance with [PEP 008](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
3. Don't use the module `string` nor its `join` function. These have been deprecated. You should now use `str` and the function `"".join`.
4. Get the whole module to 100% coverage.

This means I have reviewed [trac_8765-huffman.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8765/trac_8765-huffman.patch), so only my patch needs review by anyone but me.

That patch looks **very** good.
(I wished all module documentations had that quality.)

I'll only add some more doctests and perhaps edit some comments.

I think improvements to the algorithm can be done on another ticket.

The only reason why I still read your patches, apply them, check they are correct, check the docstrings, build the documentation and read it, is that I fear some God may be watching over my shoulder.

Another perfect patch from Minh :-D

Thank you very much !
