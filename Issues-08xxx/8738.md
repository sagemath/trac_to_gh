Try this interact:

```
@interact
def f(M = ("matrix ", random_matrix(QQ,3,4)), n=("an int", 5)):
    print "The echelon form of the above matrix is:"
    print M.echelon_form()
```

The first input control should be labeled "matrix", but it isn't.  Whoever added the matrix control for `@`interact, somehow did it in a way that breaks control labels. 

**Assignee:** @jasongrout, @williamstein

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.

**Reviewer:** Jeroen Demeyer

**Resolution:** fixed

I added the matrix control.  I had no idea that you could pass a tuple of ("label", control), so it's likely that it broke from ignorance.  Thanks for pointing out this feature!

I don't have a development copy of sagenb right now (it'd be nice of the local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sagenb.../sagenb/notebook directory contained the mercurial repository so we could easily just change things and make a patch, without having to go get the spkg, extract it, install it with the develop option, etc.)

However, to fix this, just change line 3750 of interact.py from:

```
        C = input_grid(default.nrows(), default.ncols(), default=default.list(), to_value=default.parent())

```


to

```
        C = input_grid(default.nrows(), default.ncols(), default=default.list(), to_value=default.parent(), label=label)

```

I have a comment about the design feature.  I notice from the code that this sets a default value *sometimes* (depending on the control):

```
@interact
def f(n=(2,[1,2,3,4,5])):
    print n
```

However, this does *not set the default, because the first spot is overloaded to mean "label" and "default value", and "label" takes precedence:

```
@interact
def f(n=("b",["a","b","c"])):
    print n
```

I think this interplay and double-meaning of the first argument confuses things too much.
