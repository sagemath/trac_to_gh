I got this from the "report a problem" bugtracker:

Feature request: rename data files in the notebook

If you upload a data file to the notebook and make a mistake in the
"What do you want to call it?" field, there is no way to change the
name from within the notebook, except for deleting the file and
re-uploading it.        It would be convenient if one could rename data files
from within the notebook.
