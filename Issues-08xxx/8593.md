The goal of this ticket is to implement Lehmer_codes as a parent (InfiniteEnumeratedSets()). One of the goal is to use this features to index Schubert evaluation points and Schubert polynomials.

There is also an iterator over all codes, and two methods for elements
is_dominant() (easy Schubert) and is_anti_dominant() (symmetric Schubert).

**Assignee:** nborie

**CC:**  sage-combinat

**Keywords:** code, permutation

**Status:** needs_work

Hi Nicolas,

One quick remark. Since they are many different interesting code for permutations. I'd rather call this file permutations codes and maybe make an abstract class for those. For all the other code, the bijection is different. If you are interested you can have a look at
