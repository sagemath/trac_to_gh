Nicolas(s),

This is a nice addition, and I can already think of a use for it in a classroom example.

Some small comments/suggestions:

1.  One small bit of language, in

```
Here are the cycle index of some permutation groups
```

I would write the plural as "cycle indices."  Nicely written otherwise.


2.  Would there be some way to qualify a value for the parent keyword as being legitimate?  For example, with `D=DihedralGroup(7)`, `14*D.cycle_index(parent=QQ)` goes boom.  It doesn't seem that there is a simple type to test on (but maybe I'm wrong on this), but it does look like parent need only implement  term() and sum().  Would it work to put something like  `parent.term(Partition([1]), 1)` in a try/except block?


3.  Documentation.

(a)  Do you want to add this into the reference manual?

(b)  Last doctest block needs a preceding "::" to make it render as verbatim.

(c)  Two instances of "cycle_type" near the top print weird due to the underscore.


Important stuff:  builds and passes long tests, works as advertised.  So I'm ready to give this a positive review subject to the above minor items.

Rob
