Let G a permutation group. Each permutation of G has a cycle type. The goal of this ticket is to add a method for permutation group which returns a symmetric function in the monomial symmetric functions whose terms are the numbers of permutation in G having the cycle type (Partition) indexing the corresponding monomial.

Nicolas(s),

This is a nice addition, and I can already think of a use for it in a classroom example.

Some small comments/suggestions:

1.  One small bit of language, in

```
Here are the cycle index of some permutation groups
```

I would write the plural as "cycle indices."  Nicely written otherwise.


2.  Would there be some way to qualify a value for the parent keyword as being legitimate?  For example, with `D=DihedralGroup(7)`, `14*D.cycle_index(parent=QQ)` goes boom.  It doesn't seem that there is a simple type to test on (but maybe I'm wrong on this), but it does look like parent need only implement  term() and sum().  Would it work to put something like  `parent.term(Partition([1]), 1)` in a try/except block?


3.  Documentation.

(a)  Do you want to add this into the reference manual?

(b)  Last doctest block needs a preceding "::" to make it render as verbatim.

(c)  Two instances of "cycle_type" near the top print weird due to the underscore.


Important stuff:  builds and passes long tests, works as advertised.  So I'm ready to give this a positive review subject to the above minor items.

Rob

Attachment: **[trac_8549_cycle_enumerator-nb.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8549/trac_8549_cycle_enumerator-nb.patch.gz)**

Thanks very much for these fix.

All tests pass for sage, all tests long and optionnal pass for the finite_permutation_groups, the doc is well built... New comments for parent argument make also more clear the doc.

Positive Review from me. Thanks you Rob for pointing improvements and fix.

I change two times the status of this patch but I precise the last change come from Nicolas Thiéry.

This positive review is also modulo the comment

I currently have no possible access to any OS X machine. All my tests was computing from Ubuntu machines.
