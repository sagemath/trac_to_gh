The docstring to apply_simple_projection method of CoxeterGroups
contains `\opi` which is not a valid latex symbol.

As a consequence the pdf version of the reference manual does
not build cleanly. Thus 

`sage -docbuild reference pdf`

eventually halts with the line:

```
! Undefined control sequence.
<recently read> \opi 
                     
l.185462 projection $\pi_i$ (resp. $\opi
                                        _i$) on self.
```

Evidently <code>\`\opi\`</code> is supposed to be <code>\`\overline\pi\`</code>, as elsewhere in the file around line 379 in coxeter_groups.py.
