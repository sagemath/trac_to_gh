## Build environment
* Sun Ultra 27 3.33 GHz Intel W3580 Xeon. Quad core. 8 threads. 12 GB RAM
* OpenSolaris 2009.06 snv_111b X86
* Sage 4.3.1 (with a few packages hacked to work on 64-bit)
* gcc 4.3.4 configured with Sun linker and GNU assembler from binutils version 2.20.
* 64-bit build. SAGE64 was set to yes, plus various other tricks to get -m64 into packages.

```

It does finally build, but obviously as a 32-bit object, not a 64-bit one. 

It believes the hardware is not x86. so disables the assembly. This is untrue of course, as this is an Intel Xeon processor.

<a id='comment:1'></a>I also have a 32 bit executable. I wonder is this a real problem.

Tachyon builds as a 32 bit executable too. But runs as well.
