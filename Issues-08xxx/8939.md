Attached patch adds templated matrix classes for FLINT's `fmpz_poly` and `zmod_poly` structs.

At the moment there is no extra functionality provided by the classes, but fast nullspace (over the fraction field), and hopefully inverse implementations will be coming soon. In any case, this should be a good basis for implementing fast algorithms for these matrices.

Done. I added a new file `sage/libs/flint/fmpz_poly_linkage_tests.pyx` with python functions wrapping the `celement_*()` functions. I don't know how to test the `celement_{construct,destruct}()` functions, so they are omitted.

Done, with a brief description at the beginning of `matrix_dense_template.pxi`.

>  *  I cannot see the "fast nullspace"


This will be on a different ticket, when I get around to cleaning it up...
