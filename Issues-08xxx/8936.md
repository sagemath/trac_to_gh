While lattice polytopes compute and store facet normals and shifts internally, there were no functions to access them. This patch adds functions facet_normal and facet_constant to fix the situation.

I have also fixed a typo in the docstring of ReflexivePolytope, which has probably occurred during automatic conversion of docstrings.
