Here is an implementation by David Joyner:

```
def bellman_ford(Gamma, s):
    """
    Computes the shortest distance from s to all other vertices in Gamma.
    If Gamma has a negative weight cycle, then return an error.

    INPUT:

    - Gamma -- a graph.
    - s -- the source vertex.

    OUTPUT:

    - (d,p) -- pair of dictionaries keyed on the list of vertices,
      which store the distance and shortest paths.

    REFERENCE:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman-Ford_algorithm
    """
    P = []
    dist = {}
    predecessor = {}
    V = Gamma.vertices()
    E = Gamma.edges()
    for v in V:
        if v == s:
            dist[v] = 0
        else:
            dist[v] = infinity
        predecessor[v] = 0
    for i in range(1, len(V)):
        for e in E:
            u = e[0]
            v = e[1]
            wt = e[2]
            if dist[u] + wt < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = dist[u] + wt
                predecessor[v] = u
    # check for negative-weight cycles
    for e in E:

        v = e[1]

        if dist[u] + wt < dist[v]:
            raise ValueError("Graph contains a negative-weight cycle")
    return dist, predecessor
```

And some examples:

```
sage: M = matrix([[0,1,4,0], [0,0,1,5], [0,0,0,3], [0,0,0,0]])
sage: G = Graph(M, format="weighted_adjacency_matrix")
sage: bellman_ford(G, G.vertices()[0])
  {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 5}
```

and 

```
sage: M = matrix([[0,1,0,0],[1,0,-4,1],[1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0]])
sage: G = DiGraph(M, format = "weighted_adjacency_matrix")
sage: bellman_ford(G, G.vertices()[0])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
ValueError: Graph contains a negative-weight cycle

Bellman-Ford is available in `networkx 1.6`. I added the dependency #12806, where the upgrade to 1.6 happens.

When #12806 is done, we can add an interface in the graph class for Bellman-Ford algorithm, which should be done with this ticket here.

Hello,

I have checked the networkx implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm ([See here](https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/browser/networkx/networkx/algorithms/shortest_paths/weighted.py)) and we can propose a better implementation.

This is a first implementation that can certainly be improved. Its advantage is that in the best case the time complexity is in O(|V|+|E|) and in the worst case, it is O(|V|.|E|). It uses a set to maintain the set of active vertices, that is vertices for which a change has been performed during previous round.

```
def bellman_ford(G, s):
    """
    some documentation
    """
    from sage.rings.infinity import Infinity
    P = []
    dist = {}
    predecessor = {}
    V = G.vertices()
    N = G.num_verts()
    E = G.edges()
    for v in V:
        if v == s:
            dist[v] = 0
        else:
            dist[v] = Infinity
        predecessor[v] = 0
    W = {}
    for e in E:
        W[(e[0],e[1])] = e[2]
        W[(e[1],e[0])] = e[2]
    A = set([s])
    B = set()
    cpt = 0
    while len(A) > 0 and cpt < N:
        while len(A) > 0:
            u = A.pop()
            for v in G.neighbor_iterator(u):
                if dist[u] + W[(u,v)] < dist[v]:
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + W[u,v]
                    predecessor[v] = u
                    B.add(v)
        A = B.copy()
        B.clear()
        cpt += 1
    # check for negative-weight cycles
    for e in E:
	u = e[0]
        v = e[1]
        wt = e[2]
        if dist[u] + wt < dist[v]:
            raise ValueError("Graph contains a negative-weight cycle")
    return dist, predecessor
```

The implementation can be adapted to graphs and digraphs.

Let me know if you think it is a good idea to write this patch.

Best,
D.

Well, it depends on whether you want to optimize it in C a bit or not.. In this case the choice is made for you as you would need a Cython file.

You could also use the "distance_all_pairs" file.

I would say that the best name would be.... no name ? A hidden function. Then function would then be accessed through the usual methods of graphs/digraphs, like "distance", "shortest path", "distances all pairs", with a special flag or just automatically if there happen to be negative weights on the edges... What do you think ? It would be weird to create a new function for that if we have many already, especially if you wonder what it should return -- in this case it would have to return what the function calling it expects... 

We should be able to talk about in in a few days `:-)`

I will propose a patch over the week end.

It remains the long/boring part to call that function from other functions, add optional arguments and tests, etc. I don't have time to do it now, so anyone is welcome to contribute.

I set the patch to needs review, but it should be needs work.

Yoooooooooooo !

I just reviewed this patch, and I don't see anything wrong. Several questions/remarks, though :
- the `weights` dictionary is actually (in memory) a copy of the whole graph. Isn't it better to create a normalized copy of the graph and work on this only ?
- Why `__bellman_ford__` and not just `_bellman_ford` ? Isn't the `__` only for special Python functions ?
- You say that loops are supported, but I don't see how. Where do you detect if there is a negative loop somewhere, for instance ?
- your function `ee` compares the vertices' name, and that's tricky. Sometimes the vertices of a graph are not integers, can be sets (KneserGraph for instance) and comparing them doesn't work as expected.

Besides:
- I modified a bit the behaviour of your modifications to `shortest_paths`, as this dictionary only needs to contain an entry for a target when such a path exists. I also used the fact that your Bellman Ford implementation satisfies `pred[t] = [t]` whenever `dist[t] == Infinity`.
- From the looks of `.all_pairs_shortest_path`, perhaps we should create a hidden function for the code of `Floyd-Warshall_Python`. Not urgent, just cleaning stuff.

I added my patch as a git commit, to which the two previous hg patches belong. The new branch is u/ncohen/8714.

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun ! `;-)`

Nathann

If there is a negative loop somewhere, `max_number_of_loops` is reached and the code raises a `ValueError`.

Thank you for pushing this patch. I had no time to do it in the last months, and I still don't know how to use git...

I had a quick look at proposed changes.

typo: algorith -> algorithm

```
- INPUTS:

```

I have some doubt about the recursive function  `def build_paths(v):`.
I suggest to have a loop instead of recursive calls. You never know how long will be the path, and its never a good idea to have 1000 or more recursive calls...


Thanks.

Apparently, the function `ee` serves to orient an undirected graph. One could probably replace the comparison of the labels by a comparison of the `id` which would serve the same purpose (have a unique orientation).

However: is there any advantage of using the Bellman-Ford algorithm (as compared to Dijkstra) in the undirected case? If all edges have non-negative weight, Dijkstra should be more efficient. If there is an edge with negative weight (and this edge is reachable from the start vertex), then Bellman-Ford will detect it as a negative circuit (just take this edge in both directions repeatedly) and fail anyway.

Corollary 12.13 in Korte and Vygen, Combinatorial Optimization (5th edition). But this has nothing to do with Bellman-Ford.

My proposal would be to remove the code for undirected graphs in this proposed patch, which would increase readability IMHO, remove the problem with this `ee` function and would, in my opinion, not loose any useful functionality. I do not know whether this would still belong to `generic_graph`, though.

I fixed two issues with the code. This includes a simple doctest for the (previously broken for negative edge weights) function shortest_paths. IMHO, doctests should be included for the other
changed functions, too.

Bellman-Ford has now been implemented in #18931. As discussed in [#18931 comment 15](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/18931#comment:15), the performance has not yet been compared with the code here.

However, the branch attached to this ticket no longer merges with develop and very much work would be needed. Moreover, this ticket has not had any activity for 15 months. My suggestion is to close this ticket here as a duplicate.

Actually I tried this patch a few days ago and I fully agree that it has to be fully rewritten. Moreover, to be competitive with respect to #18931, the algorithm has to be cythonized.
So let's close this ticket, and if later we decide to give a try to a fresh cython implementation, we can do it in another ticket.
Best,
David.
