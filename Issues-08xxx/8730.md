The current problem with this spkg is that gmp must be in SAGE_LOCAL, and not in /usr/local This stops the thing building on Solaris, see http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/msg/35b0c600a5ef250f and other messages in this thread. And gmpdir=/usr/local is hardwired in Makefile.am.

Updated spkg is at 

http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/cddlib-094f.p6.spkg

I changed gmplib in Makefile.am, re-ran autotools, and added the updated files to patches/. It should work now, but I have no Solaris machine to test on. Please let us know if this fixes the build problem.

IMHO there should be a short explanation (in SPKG.txt?) on how to make modifications to patches. The whole autoconf/automake machinery is not so trivial...

IMHO it is unusual to have sources and configuration files reside in a directory tree like this one.
E.g. it's unclear in which directory autoreconf must be run...
Although I must admit last time I messed around with autotools config files 11 years ago. :-)

What I find strange is that libgmp has been in /usr/local/lib for almost 10 months on 't2'

kirkby`@`t2:[/usr/local/lib] $ ls -l /usr/local/lib/libgmp*
-rw-r--r--   1 nobody   nobody    659804 Jun 27  2009 /usr/local/lib/libgmp.a
-rwxr-xr-x   1 nobody   nobody       785 Jun 27  2009 /usr/local/lib/libgmp.la
lrwxrwxrwx   1 nobody   nobody        15 Jun 27  2009 /usr/local/lib/libgmp.so -> libgmp.so.3.5.0

-rwxr-xr-x   1 nobody   nobody    355108 Jun 27  2009 /usr/local/lib/libgmp.so.3.5.0
kirkby`@`t2:[/usr/local/lib] $

Why this should suddenly be a problem is a bit puzzling to me, given cddlib-094f.p5.spkg was merged into sage 4.3.4 and 4.3.4 built on 't2' OK.

Does anyone know why this suddenly stops working?

But in principle, I think changing Kakefile.am and regenerating the files with autoreconf is the way to go. I'm just a bit concerned that the autom4te.cache directory is not included. 

I think it is important to point out to the upstream developers that having a site customisation file Makefile.am goes totally against the principle of using autoconf/automake.

I happen to know Komei Fukuda, the cdd(lib) author, (even had a joint paper with him quite a while ago).
I'll write to him, once the spkg is ready.

For the record, I started having those problems on my Fedora box already at 4.3.4 (probably when the cddlib spkg was merged).

I think he needs to add an AC_ARG_WITH into configure.ac. There must be many packages in Sage which allow the location of gmp to be specified, so there must be plenty of examples of how to do it. I suspect mpfr is probably the best place to look, as the mpfr developers seem to know what they are doing with autoconf/automake. 

But I agree with Dima, that there should be an explanation of what files are in the patches/autogenerated directory. 

There also needs to be a Mercurial patch added on the ticket once the wording is sorted out.
