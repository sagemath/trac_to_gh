We have an artificial limitation in that contour labels and linestyles don't work when fill=True.  This patch lets these options work with filling.  Furthermore, it draws the contour lines on top of filled plots by default, which (at least I think) makes the plot look a little nicer anyway.

Works as advertaised, but region_plot gives error after installing this patch.

```
sage: x,y=var('x y')
sage: region_plot(cos(x^2+y^2) <= 0, (x, -3, 3), (y, -3, 3))

Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
KeyError: 'linewidths'
```

did you try this?

```
./sage -t devel/sage/sage/plot/contour_plot.py
```

My patch fixes long lines (which make help for contour_plot too wide for typical screen) and split contour_plot exmaples into groups (this allows to try commands immediatelly when reading live reference manual).

One suggestion: could we set label_colors to something resonable (gray? red? blue?) when both fill and labels are True, but label_color is not specified?

Weird---I thought I did.  Well, the new patch fixes this error.

> One suggestion: could we set label_colors to something resonable (gray? red? blue?) when both fill and labels are True, but label_color is not specified?

The new patch addresses this issue as well.

Can you look at this and review it again?

Thanks
