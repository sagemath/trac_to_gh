From `algebra_with_basis.py`:

```
#@cached_method   # todo: reinstate once #5843 is fixed
def one_from_one_basis(self):
    """
    Returns the one of the algebra, as per
            ``Monoids.ParentMethods.one``
    [...]
    """
    return self.monomial(self.one_basis()) #.
```
So I'm removing the comment since #5843 is fixed.

I had ask for this change, and the extra tests are good. Thanks for handling this!

Please double check that all test pass (they should), and then you can put a positive review on my behalf.
