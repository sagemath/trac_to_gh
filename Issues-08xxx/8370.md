Hello, Marc !

This is a good idea. If I'm alright, this patch is adding a missing section to the French tutorial that is mainly a translation of the same section (already present) in English ?

I'll start looking at your patch today.

Hello again Marc !
I reviewed your patch. Everything is ok, I made a few changes which are not errors, but mainly suggestions, so if you don't agree with any of it, feel very free to remove them or tell me to remove them. To summarize, I did the following modifications.

1. Since the tabbing is four spaces for Python code in general (not mandatory, but encouraged), I reformatted your examples so that they all start at distance four from the beginning of the lines.

2. For the sage blocks illustrating your examples, you always put `::` alone on a line, while you could put it at the end of the preceding text explaining the example. The effect is that the sentence ends with `:` and the block example follows. This is not a mistake, but this is what I've seen in other patches.

3. I did some rephrasing. These are only suggestions, if you don't agree with all or some of it, let me know.

4. You forgot to put the word "plot" between backticks in one place. I corrected that.

That's pretty much it. As soon as you confirm my changes, I'll be ready to set this ticket to positive review.

Hello !!! This new patch is a concatenation of the two previous given, plus two unimportant fixes for a broken doctest :-)

Do you agree to set it to positive review ? It applied fine, it is indeed french and everything is nicely formatted !!

Hello, everyone !

I'm very sorry for the delay... I just moved back to Montreal and haven't had much time lately to work on Sage patches. I looked once again at the three patches, applied them, checked the documentation generated by Sage and run `sage -t` on the `tour_functions.rst` file. Everything looked fine and all tests passed. Therefore, I give this patch a positive review.

For the release manager, please apply the patches in the following order

```
trac_8370_tour_functions_french.patch
trac_8370_review-abm.patch
trac_8370_fixes.patch
```

and disregard `trac_8370_merged+doctest_fixes.patch`.

Thank you for your patience!
