These group functions use the GAP interface and return unsorted lists.  This makes them prone to doctest breakage when GAP is upgraded (and the order of things changes) or when GAP uses non-deterministic algorithms (and the order of things is ill-defined).

The patch fixes `irreducible_characters` and `word_problem`.  There might be more functions in `sage/groups` that require the same treatment, but that can go on a different ticket.
