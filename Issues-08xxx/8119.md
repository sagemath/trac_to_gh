For many objects the hash value is computed from `__repr__`. This is a bad idea since renaming the object change its hash value.

```
sage: bla = PolynomialRing(ZZ,"x")

Hi Robert,

I've one question related to this and I like to have the confirmation from an expert. After your patch, upon pickling/unpickling the hash value can change because it is not pickled and neither is the name, right ? As far as I manage to test this is not harmful to pickle a dict containing a renamed parent. Indeed, trying to read `cPickle.c`, I understood that the dict is reconstructed from it's items and thus even if the hash changed the element is inserted correctly in the dict during unpickling. Can you confirm this ?

If this is not both this patch and #8120 are broken.

Also, after this, do you still need #8506 ?

Florent

Yes, #8506 is still important--in my case I'm reducing a curve mod many, many primes, doing just a bit of stuff on each before throwing them away. I suppose eventually caching the hash value would eventually be a win, but that's a separate optimization.

Sure ! I completely forgot about this one. Sorry !

They are a few place where we should remove the bad implementation using `__repr__` since they all inherits from `CategoryObject`: 

```
popcorn-*ge-combinat/sage $ grep "hash(self.__repr__())" **/*.py*
groups/group.pyx:        return hash(self.__repr__())
modules/module.pyx:        return hash(self.__repr__())
modules/module.pyx:        return hash(self.__repr__())
rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx:        return hash(self.__repr__())
rings/ring.pyx:        return hash(self.__repr__())
structure/sage_object.pyx:        return hash(self.__repr__())
```
I don't have time to do it right now. I'll do it soon if you don't beat me.

I just added a review patch which removes the wrong hash methods.

Please review. I'm ok with the original patch, so if my review patch is ok
you can put a positive review on my behalf.

Florent's review patch looks good. However ``consistant* should be written ``consistent* in the first patch. I also did not yet set a positive review because of the ongoing discussion on sage-devel. Please feel free to go ahead and set a positive review once the typo is fixed and if it is decided that the PolynomialRing issue shall be fixed in a follow up patch.

Bonjour Florent!

I am not sure the log message for 8119-parent-hash-review.patch is proper. While you are at it, I'd suggest to just fold it in the other patch. The review history does not bring much information here, so having a single patch will give a better overview to the future reader.

I'll set a positive review right after.

Weird, I get here the same result as you on boxen, both with 4.8 and 5.0.beta8. I don't know how a wrong return value ended up in the patch. 

Oh well, I updated the patch to expect the result obtained on boxen.

Hi there,

I'm setting a positive review here but I uploaded a new patch removing a
trailling whitespace which bothered the patchbot. The only difference between
[attachment:8119-parent-hash-final-fix32.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8119/8119-parent-hash-final-fix32.patch) and
[attachment:8119-parent-hash-final.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8119/8119-parent-hash-final.patch) is the trailling space (and of course
Mercurials header), so I don't think a new review is needed.
