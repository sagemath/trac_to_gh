See http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_frm/thread/f82e24efdfe23b07/d9e563f086b1136d for a solution

```
sage: a=sqrt((sin(t))^2 + (cos(t))^2)
sage: integrate(a, t, 0, 2*pi) # WRONG!
pi
sage: a.simplify_full().simplify_trig()
1
sage: integrate(a.simplify_full().simplify_trig(), t, 0, 2*pi)
2*pi 
```
