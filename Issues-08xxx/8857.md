* `a.lcm(b)` where `a` and `b` are constant polynomials is broken over a variety of rings:
  {{{
  sage: R.<x,y> = RR[]
  sage: R(2^31).lcm(R(2*x+1)) # Boom

* In other cases (including the original example of the above problem, reported by Manuel Kauers and now fixed, presumably by #4000), the output is inconsistent with the gcd over the base ring:
  {{{
  sage: R.<x> = QQ[x]
  sage: R(1/2).lcm(R(1))
  1
  sage: (1/2).lcm(QQ(1))
  1

We're halfway there:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[x]
sage: R(1/2).lcm(R(1))
1
sage: R(2^31).lcm(R(1))
1
```

but the second result is clearly wrong.

I think that this is very counter-intuitive behavior and is inconsistent. Compare:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ['x']
sage: R(2^31).lcm(2*x + 1)
4294967296*x + 2147483648
sage: R(2^31).lcm(1)
2147483648

sage: QQ(2^31).lcm(QQ(1))
2147483648

sage: R.<x,y> = QQ['x,y']
sage: R(2^31).lcm(2*x + 1)
4294967296*x + 2147483648
sage: R(2^31).lcm(1)
2147483648
```
with

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ['x']
sage: R(2^31).lcm(2*x + 1)
x + 1/2
```

However, I do think that this should have a doctest nevertheless.

What part do you find counter-intuitive? That `p.lcm(q)`� for `p, q ∈ QQ[x]` returns the monic lcm of `p` and `q` is clearly what I would expect, even though it might make sense to ask that `gcd·lcm = p·q`. However, I do find the definition of `gcd` and `lcm` over `QQ` counter-intuitive.

It's just not what my naive/non-number-theorist self expects, but I can see why `lcm` would be counter-intuitive. However you do agree that this behavior is inconsistent? Also, a similar problem with using `RR` (and other like fields) as in the this ticket:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = RR[]
sage: R(2^31).lcm(R(2*x+1)) # Boom
```
and `R.<x,y> = FractionField(QQ['t'])[]`. So should we use this ticket as one to fix this as well since it essentially is the same bug?

From a user interface point of view, yes, I do. From a mathematical (or programming) point of view I am not sure.

Yes, why not.
