* `a.lcm(b)` where `a` and `b` are constant polynomials is broken over a variety of rings:
  {{{
  sage: R.<x,y> = RR[]
  sage: R(2^31).lcm(R(2*x+1)) # Boom

  sage: R(1/2).lcm(R(1))
  1
  sage: (1/2).lcm(QQ(1))
  1
  }}}

What part do you find counter-intuitive? That `p.lcm(q)`� for `p, q ∈ QQ[x]` returns the monic lcm of `p` and `q` is clearly what I would expect, even though it might make sense to ask that `gcd·lcm = p·q`. However, I do find the definition of `gcd` and `lcm` over `QQ` counter-intuitive.
