Note that 2!^24 bits is only slightly above 5M digits, which is
quite small (Fabrice Bellard recently computed 2700 billions of digits of Pi on a personal desktop, i.e., about 500,000 times more).

Looks good and passes tests.

The referee patch adds a couple of doctests (bug fixes should be accompanied by doctests so that we don't regress again).  The slightly weird "OverflowError: ..." in the second test is due to the fact that the error messages are slightly different on 32-bit than on 64-bit machines.
