The attachment [trac_8246-carmichael.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8246/trac_8246-carmichael.patch) provides a non-recursive implementation of the Carmichael function. This is in contrast to the recursive implementation as contained in [BBScrypto.sage](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8246/BBScrypto.sage).

The following generates some timing statistics for both Hogan & Joyner's implementation, and the non-recursive implementation. Here are some timing statistics for the recursive implementation, where the timing results (in microseconds) are saved to [carmichael.old](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8246/carmichael.old):

```
sage: load("/home/mvngu/BBScrypto.sage")
sage: T = []
sage: for n in xrange(1, 1001):
....:     t = %timeit carmichael(n)
....:     T.append(t.stats[3])

sage: f = open("/home/mvngu/carmichael.old", "w")
sage: for t in T:
....:     f.write(str(t) + "\n")
....:     
sage: f.close()
```

The following are some timing statistics for the non-recursive implementation. Timing results (in microseconds) are saved to [carmichael.new](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8246/carmichael.new):

```
sage: from sage.crypto.util import carmichael_lambda

sage: # First 10 elements of T are timings in nanoseconds. 
sage: # So convert them to microseconds.
sage: for i in xrange(10):

sage: Yold = []
sage: f = open("/home/mvngu/carmichael.old", "r")

Applies fine to 4.3.3.a0 on a mac 10.6.2. Passes sage -testall and the reference manual/documentation looks good.

Positive review. 

I should add that this is a completely different, and much faster, implementation that the Wikipedia one (which is the one originally submitted). 

Thanks again Minh!

Sorry to comment that late, but there are a few things in this patch I dislike:

* Why hard code the first ten values?
* `carmichael_lambda(16)` is of type `sage.rings.rational.Rational`
* why use generic_power to compute the power of an integer?

here's my 2-cents implementation:

```

def carmichael_lambda(n):
    n = Integer(n)

    if n < 1: 
        raise ValueError("Input n must be a positive integer.")

    F = n.factor()
    L = []

    # first get rid of the even part
    if n & 1 == 0:
        e = F[0][1]
        F = F[1:]
        if e < 3:
            e = e-1
        else:
            e = e-2
        L.append(1<<e)
    
    # then other prime factors
    L += [ p**(k-1)*(p-1) for p,k in F]

    # finish the job
    return lcm(L)

```

Did you test to see if your implementation was faster than the current one. If so, what were the results?

Except if n<=10, timings are very similar, mine being slightly faster.
To obtain an even faster version one can replace the final lcm with `sage.rings.integer.LCM_list(L)`.

e.g.

```
sage: %timeit carmichael_lambda(1000)     # Minh's version
625 loops, best of 3: 270 µs per loop
sage: %timeit my_carmichael_lambda(1000)  # mine with lcm
625 loops, best of 3: 244 µs per loop
sage: %timeit my_carmichael_lambda2(1000) # mine with sage.rings.integer.LCM_list
625 loops, best of 3: 214 µs per loop
sage: %timeit factor(1000)                # just to compare
625 loops, best of 3: 177 µs per loop
```

we can see that most of the time is spent factoring.

I totally agree on this, but you asked for speed results! I didn't mentionned speed at all in my first message.

It's definitely not what I'm trying to do.

> it is just that it is more important for the function to exist in Sage that for it to be fast. But if someone wants me to referee a new patch, that is fine too.


My point was:

* there is a bug: e.g. carmichael_lambda(16) is of type sage.rings.rational.Rational ;
* a small speed up does not matter: therefore no need to hard code the first 10 cases, it just makes the code less readable ;
* my code is IMHO just easier to read.
