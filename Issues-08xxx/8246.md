Add a new function to calculate the Carmichael lambda function of a positive integer n. The Carmichael lambda function is related to the Blum-Blum-Shub pseudorandom bit generator. See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmichael_function) for a definition, and [Mathematica documentation center](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/CarmichaelLambda.html) for examples.

The attachment [trac_8246-carmichael.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8246/trac_8246-carmichael.patch.gz) provides a non-recursive implementation of the Carmichael function. This is in contrast to the recursive implementation as contained in [BBScrypto.sage](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8246/BBScrypto.sage.gz).

Here are some timing statistics for the recursive implementation, where the timing results (in microseconds) are saved to [carmichael.old](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8246/carmichael.old.gz):

```
sage: load("/home/mvngu/BBScrypto.sage")
sage: T = []

sage: for t in T:

The following are some timing statistics for the non-recursive implementation. Timing results (in microseconds) are saved to [carmichael.new](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8246/carmichael.new.gz):

```

Applies fine to 4.3.3.a0 on a mac 10.6.2. Passes sage -testall and the reference manual/documentation looks good.

Positive review. 

I should add that this is a completely different, and much faster, implementation that the Wikipedia one (which is the one originally submitted). 

Thanks again Minh!

Sorry to comment that late, but there are a few things in this patch I dislike:

* Why hard code the first ten values?
* `carmichael_lambda(16)` is of type `sage.rings.rational.Rational`
* why use generic_power to compute the power of an integer?

here's my 2-cents implementation:

```

def carmichael_lambda(n):
    n = Integer(n)

    if n < 1: 
        raise ValueError("Input n must be a positive integer.")

    F = n.factor()
    L = []

    # first get rid of the even part
    if n & 1 == 0:
        e = F[0][1]
        F = F[1:]
        if e < 3:
            e = e-1
        else:
            e = e-2
        L.append(1<<e)
    
    # then other prime factors
    L += [ p**(k-1)*(p-1) for p,k in F]

    # finish the job
    return lcm(L)

```

Did you test to see if your implementation was faster than the current one. If so, what were the results?

Except if n<=10, timings are very similar, mine being slightly faster.
To obtain an even faster version one can replace the final lcm with `sage.rings.integer.LCM_list(L)`.

e.g.

```
sage: %timeit carmichael_lambda(1000)     # Minh's version
625 loops, best of 3: 270 µs per loop
sage: %timeit my_carmichael_lambda(1000)  # mine with lcm
625 loops, best of 3: 244 µs per loop
sage: %timeit my_carmichael_lambda2(1000) # mine with sage.rings.integer.LCM_list
625 loops, best of 3: 214 µs per loop
sage: %timeit factor(1000)                # just to compare
625 loops, best of 3: 177 µs per loop
```

we can see that most of the time is spent factoring.

I totally agree on this, but you asked for speed results! I didn't mentionned speed at all in my first message.

It's definitely not what I'm trying to do.

> it is just that it is more important for the function to exist in Sage that for it to be fast. But if someone wants me to referee a new patch, that is fine too.

My point was:

* there is a bug: e.g. carmichael_lambda(16) is of type sage.rings.rational.Rational ;
* a small speed up does not matter: therefore no need to hard code the first 10 cases, it just makes the code less readable ;
* my code is IMHO just easier to read.

The patch is already merged. To reopen this ticket would result in confusion for release managers. Can I persuade you to open a ticket to get your implementation into Sage? It's always nice to have an expert look over a novice's work.
