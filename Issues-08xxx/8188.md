Please make the following changes

(1) fix the patch so that it applies correctly
(2) Add you name to AUTHOR
(3) Add a short definition of systematic and information set to the docstrings.

If you do all these, and the patch applies and passes sage -testall then I'll give this a positive review.

Thanks for working on this!
