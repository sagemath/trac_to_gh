Here is the spkg:

http://wstein.org/home/wstein/patches/openssl-1.0.0.spkg

I fixed things to be "modern" and up to snuff -- a formatted SPKG.txt file, a .hg directory, error messages not all messed up in spkg-install, a src/ directory, etc.

Sadly, building sage-4.3.5 with gcc-4.4.3 and openssl-1.0.0.spkg 
did NOT work on one of my company's computers (not connected to
the Internet).  The machine is similar hardware to Skynet/taurus, 
but running Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server.

First I installed openssl-1.0.0.spkg.  Then I did 'make testlong'.
The build failed while trying to build python-2.6.4.p7 with the
message
  
  import _md5
Import Error: No module named _md5
hashlib module failed to import

Can you post the log that results from doing

  sage -f openssl-1.0.0

and also the log that results from building python, e.g.,

  sage -f python-2.6.4.p7


Also, did you get this failure on taurus?  If so, I can just test there.

I do not believe I am allowed to export the logs.
This problem is happening on one of our internal 
company machines.

I tried to reproduce the problem on taurus, but sadly the 
problem does NOT seem to be reproducible on taurus.

I have investigated the problem and found that 
the reason for the failure is that openssl-1.0.0
puts libraries in $SAGE_ROOT/local/lib64 on 64-bit 
machines. Sage does not add $SAGE_ROOT/local/lib64
to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

If you add

  --libdir=lib

to the ./config line in spkg-install, then sage
builds with openssl-1.0.0 and all tests pass.

On the machine where I previously was having problems, 
openssl-1.0.0.p0.spkg builds and 'make testlong' on
sage-4.4.3 passes all tests.

Thus I give this package a positive review!
