As reported by Jaap Spies, one of the reviewers of #8363, the package is not building properly as a 64-bit binary on OpenSolaris. This is despite the fact that CFLAGS includes -m64. It might be the lack of LDFLAGS being exported which is causing this problem. Whatever the cause is, this needs to work for a complete port to OpenSolaris.
