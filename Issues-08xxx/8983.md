Here is the relevant thread on sage-devel:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/t/d236e80bf7826bff

The main problem is this:

```
sage: erf(0)
erf(0)
```

We should just return 0.

Beginner reporting for duty!  So I have a patch which sets erf(0) to 0 -- or, rather, to parent(x)(0) if x==0, so that it's the "right" zero; I think this is the right idiom -- and adds complex arguments from mpmath.

But I have a few questions that came up along the way:

(1) In 4.6.1, solve(erf(x)==0,x) seems to work for me already, before the patch.  Did I get my binaries confused somehow, or did something change elsewhere?

(2) It'd be nice if #8720 (fixing str(CC(0))) were finished, it surprised me when writing tests for the zero type preservation. Maybe I should have a look, I think it's mostly fixing some doctests left.

(3) My patch broke a doctest in functions/special.py, which expected erf(0.5) to be evaluated to 0.520499877813047, but the existing doctests for erf demand that erf(2) = erf(2). I can get that behaviour, namely to evaluate for reals and to hold for integers except for zero, but I don't quite follow it.

(4) Since I'm doing a bit more, should I open an enhancement ticket instead?

I believe there already is a ticket for the complex pieces at #1173, similarly at #9044.  If you have a good solution to the whole thing, you could do it at one of those and then say this ticket can be closed when they are (if you have also documented that it's fixed.

If #1173 isn't going to happen anytime soon because of #11513, a very simple patch here would be nice.  It would document

```
sage: solve(erf(x)==0,x)
[x == 0]

as mentioned above already works, and take care of the issue in the summary, of course.

Thanks for the patch Benjamin. It looks great and gets the job done. However, I'd be much happier if there were a couple more doctests. There are quite a few branches in the new `_eval_()` function, but the patch adds only one doctest.

One more suggestion: It might be better to leave the last `return None` statement outside the `if`s. IMHO, the following is more compact and readable.

```
if not isinstance(x, Expression): 
    if is_inexact(x): 
        return self._evalf_(x, parent=parent(x)) 
    elif x == 0: 
        return x 
elif x.is_trivial_zero(): 
        return x 
return None 
```

Is this what you were referring to at [#10133 comment:2](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/10133#comment:2), dsm?

More generally, does anyone think the present way of ensuring `erf(0)` returns an Integer (or even Symbolic Expression) is a good one for #10133?  Or is it better to address this at the Pynac level?

It's not overkill at all, after adding `_a_` doctest to every function, perhaps we will measure the coverage in terms of percentage of lines executed with those tests. Thanks for spending the time and giving this function 100% coverage. :)

BTW, `erf(SR(0))` should be a simple way of hitting the `is_trivially_zero()` branch.
