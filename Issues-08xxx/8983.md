The main problem is this:

```

<a id='comment:5'></a>Beginner reporting for duty!  So I have a patch which sets erf(0) to 0 -- or, rather, to parent(x)(0) if x==0, so that it's the "right" zero; I think this is the right idiom -- and adds complex arguments from mpmath.

But I have a few questions that came up along the way:

(1) In 4.6.1, solve(erf(x)==0,x) seems to work for me already, before the patch.  Did I get my binaries confused somehow, or did something change elsewhere?

(2) It'd be nice if #8720 (fixing str(CC(0))) were finished, it surprised me when writing tests for the zero type preservation. Maybe I should have a look, I think it's mostly fixing some doctests left.

(3) My patch broke a doctest in functions/special.py, which expected erf(0.5) to be evaluated to 0.520499877813047, but the existing doctests for erf demand that erf(2) = erf(2). I can get that behaviour, namely to evaluate for reals and to hold for integers except for zero, but I don't quite follow it.

(4) Since I'm doing a bit more, should I open an enhancement ticket instead?

I believe there already is a ticket for the complex pieces at #1173, similarly at #9044.  If you have a good solution to the whole thing, you could do it at one of those and then say this ticket can be closed when they are (if you have also documented that it's fixed.

Is this what you were referring to at comment:2:ticket:10133, dsm?

More generally, does anyone think the present way of ensuring `erf(0)` returns an Integer (or even Symbolic Expression) is a good one for #10133?  Or is it better to address this at the Pynac level?

It's not overkill at all, after adding _a_ doctest to every function, perhaps we will measure the coverage in terms of percentage of lines executed with those tests. Thanks for spending the time and giving this function 100% coverage. :)

BTW, `erf(SR(0))` should be a simple way of hitting the `is_trivially_zero()` branch.
