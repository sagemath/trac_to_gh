Nicolas on sage-combinat series file:

```
trac_8902-subsets_call_fix-fh.patch               # Positive review, assuming tests pass (NT)
```
I got a all test passes on massena.

Note: the category related problem we discussed on the phone is postponed until #8910 in the patch `trac_8910-subsets_an_element-fh.patch`. 

If you are ok with that can you put a positive review ?
