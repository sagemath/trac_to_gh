```
sage: S2 = Subsets(2)
sage: S2([])
<type 'sage.structure.parent.Set_generic'>
sage: S2([1])
<type 'sage.structure.parent.Set_generic'>
```

Nicolas on sage-combinat series file:

```
trac_8902-subsets_call_fix-fh.patch               # Positive review, assuming tests pass (NT)
```
I got a all test passes on massena.

Note: the category related problem we discussed on the phone is postponed until #8910 in the patch `trac_8910-subsets_an_element-fh.patch`. 

If you are ok with that can you put a positive review ?
