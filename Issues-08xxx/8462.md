Running Solaris 10 on a SPARC, I get some numerical noise on this. Since these are RGB values. 

```

File "/export/home/drkirkby/32/sage-4.3.4.alpha0/devel/sage/sage/plot/colors.py", line 660:
    sage: gold / pi + yellow * e
Expected:
    RGB color (0.51829585732141792, 0.49333037605210095, 0.0)
Got:
    RGB color (0.51829585732141814, 0.49333037605210117, 0.0)
**********************************************************************
```

The test makes use of 'e'. As has been shown on various other trac tickets (e.g. #8374, #8375), the value of 'e' returned by the SPARC processor is less accurate then the Intel/ADM chips.
