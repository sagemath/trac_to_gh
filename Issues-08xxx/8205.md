I upgraded sagenb.org to sagenb-0.7.4, and excitedly hoped that when I click publish to publish a worksheet it would give me the correct URL.    Now it says:

"Worksheet is publicly viewable at http://localhost:8888/home/pub/1153"

This is wrong.  This might even be considered worse than before, since before it did "... http://:8888/home/pub/1153" which was obviously wrong.  The above looks less obviously wrong.

I think the most robust fix may be to just add another option to the notebook command that specifies the correct URL base instead of trying to cleverly figure it out.

Adding [ProxyPreserveHost On](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypreservehost) to the notebook server `VirtualHost`s in `/etc/apache2/httpd.conf` on `boxen` seems to work.Â  If it works well, we should mention it in the `notebook?` docstring.
