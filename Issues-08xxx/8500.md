```
This patch implements the finite enumerated set of transitive
permutation groups of a given degree, and the infinite enumerated set
of all transitive permutation groups. The later is built as a disjoint
union of the former.

This allows a user to do:

```
sage: TransitiveGroups(4).cardinality()

sage: for G in TransitiveGroups(i):
...       any_test(G)  # any test over all transitive groups of a given degree

sage: for G in TransitiveGroups():
...       other_test(G) # test over all transitive groups
```

This requires the optional database_gap which contains all the
transitive permutation groups of degree <= 30. Therefore, in practice,
the enumeration stops with a NonImplementedError at degree 30.

Depends on #8524.

Wow,that was quick, thanks!

I browsed through the patch, which looks good. Some minor comments before I do the final review:

- Change "trac 8500 Add the finite enumerated set of TransitiveGroups" to "#8500 Add the enumerated set of TransitiveGroups"

- Keep number_of_transitive_groups a private function (i.e. not in all.py)

- TransitiveGroups() would better model the mathematical set of all transitive groups, even if this is only partially implemented. Hence TransitiveGroups() should be in InfiniteEnumeratedSets (and therefore TransitiveGroups().cardinality() will return infinity). As a side effect, the #long time should not be needed anymore for the TestSuite(TransitiveGroups()).run().

- You may actually want to implement TransitiveGroups() as a DisjointUnionOfEnumeratedSets, which should essentially do all the work for you.

Hi,

* Commit message : will do!

* Private function : Why not? There is no reference page built for permgroup_named.py... It will be used by the very private club...

* Ok, Do you prefer a StopIteration or a NotImplementedError for the `__iter__` method ?

* DisjointUnionOfEnumeratedSets????? I don't know this toy but I already like the name. Will play with it (and hope it is robust (like children, when I play....))

Thanks for these advises...

Hmm, I guess NotImplementedError. And I assume that should be what occurs by default with DisjointUnionOfEnumeratedSets.

Note: you'll have a micro-issue with classcall, which Florent is supposed to fix shortly (he stumbled into it yesterday.

Oh, by the way: what gap is providing you is actually an unrank function (see enumeratedSets). You just need to implement TransitiveGroups(3).unrank(5), and `__iter__` will be provided to you for free.

I included all yours recommendations. I just didn't remove the # long time for the test :
TestSuite(TransitiveGroups()).run()
Even it is now an Infinite Enumerated Set, the test still need around 20 seconds.

+The goal of this patch is implement a proper infinite set of category InfiniteEnumeratedSet of transitive groups. This set is built as a disjoint union of Finite Enumerated Sets of all set of Transitive groups of a given degree.
+
+This allows a user to do:
 
 ```
-sage: TransitiveGroup(7,7)
-Transitive group number 7 of degree 7
-sage: TransitiveGroup(7,8)
-verbose 0 (846: permgroup_named.py, __init__) Warning: Computing with TransitiveGroups requires the optional database_gap package. Please install it.
-Transitive group number 8 of degree 7

+    any_test(G)  # any test over all transitive groups of a given degree
+
+for G in TransitiveGroups():
+    other_test(G) # test over all transitive groups
 ```
 
-I had also the set of TransitiveGroups() (The whole Gap database as a set with categories) and TransitiveGroups(degree) (The set of TransitiveGroup of a given degree with categories).
+This will requires the optional database_gap.
+
+As the database of Gap is finite, the enumeration stop with a NonImplementedError at degree 30.

I clearly set a positive review on your reviewer patch!

I had a failure in :
sage -t sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.py --optional --long

```
sage -t --optional --long "devel/sage-review/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.py"
**********************************************************************
File "/opt/sage/devel/sage-review/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.py", line 884:
    sage: TransitiveGroup(5,0)                 # requires optional database_gap
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: n should be in {1,..,5}
Got:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
        assert n > 0
    AssertionError
```

Thus I propose you a final patch (very easy to review) with a fix of the doc of TransitiveGroupsAll and a move of an assert on the index of a transitive group.

Now, all tests long and optional passes. I hope we don't leave any error in the doc too.

Oops, I let that one slip through. Thanks for the report!

I merged your doc fix in my patch. For the assertion, I fixed the doctest instead. The message is not as nice, but using assert n>0 has the (admittedly limited) advantage of failing even if the database is not there.

With this the patch is good to go. Positive review. Thanks for your work on this!

I'll now fold the two patches together and upload the final version here.

I asked Jason Grout via IRC to test #8500 and #8549 on hyperelliptic_finite_field.py with OSX 10.6 and the file passed tests.  Slightly edited IRC discussion.

```
[21:34] <rbeezer> jason-: ping
[21:34] <jason-> pong
[21:35] <rbeezer> could you do a simple OSX 10.6 test?
[21:35] <rbeezer> #8500, #8549, apply one patch from each, then
[21:35] <rbeezer> sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_finite_field.py"
[21:35] <rbeezer> ???
[21:36] <jason-> Let me see
[21:37] <rbeezer> thanks - this particular combo is holding up both tickets
[21:39] <jason-> all tests passed!
[21:40] <rbeezer> thanks
[21:41] <jason-> rbeezer: that's osx 10.6
```

Same combination passed all long tests on 64-bit Ubuntu 9.04, in addition to the one file passing tests for Mike Hansen.

I ran long tests on `devel/sage/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.py` with the gap database installed and it all passed tests.

Given that this seemed ready for a positive review and now passes tests on the OSX combination, I am going to set this to positive review and add Jason to the reviewer list.
