After I found the following bug, it was decided on sage-devel that in a `MatrixSpace` the methods `.one()`, `.identity_matrix()` and `.zero_matrix()` should returns a cached immutable matrix. I had to update sage's library accordingly. 

```
sage: A = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 3)
sage: A.one()
[1 0 0]
[0 1 0]
[0 0 1]
sage: A.one()[1,2] = 1
sage: A.one()
[1 0 0]
[0 1 1]
[0 0 1]
```

So here is now the current behavior:

```
sage: MM = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 3,3)
sage: MM(0).is_mutable()
True
sage: MM.zero_matrix().is_mutable()
False
sage: MM(1).is_mutable()
True
sage: MM.identity_matrix().is_mutable()
False
```

Note that calling `MM(0)` or `MM(1)` was a bad idea:

```
sage: timeit("MM(0)")
625 loops, best of 3: 72.4 µs per loop
sage: timeit("copy(MM.zero_matrix())")
625 loops, best of 3: 15.6 µs per loop
```
And for identity:

```
sage: timeit("MM(1)")
625 loops, best of 3: 67.4 µs per loop
sage: timeit("copy(MM.identity_matrix())")
625 loops, best of 3: 41.1 µs per loop
```
I took the chance to optimize those. The extra cost of calling `MM()` or `M(0)` instead of `copy(MM.zero_matrix())` is now very small.

Correcting MatrixSpace is easy, however there are a lot of places in sage where people create a matrix from the one or zero and modify it after that. I nearly corrected all these occurences. However, I'm stuck with those three files which are very complicated and depend one of each other:

```
    sage/modular/quatalg/brandt.py
    sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra.py
    sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/heegner.py
```
There are a lot of error but I can't find where it's coming from. I really
could use the help of a specialist. 

Apply the patch in the following order:

```
    trac_8276-MatrixSpace_one-fh.patch
    trac_8276-fix_sagelib-fh.patch
```
Thanks for any suggestion.

At last thing should be OK ! Please apply in the following order:

```
trac_8276-MatrixSpace_one-fh.patch
trac_8276-fix_sagelib-fh.patch
trac_8276-fix_zero_matrix_creation-fh.patch

Depends on #8294

The first patch makes the matrices immutable, the second one fixes Sage's lib accordingly the thirds patch simplifies and optimizes the creation of the zero matrix.

trac_8276-fix_zero_matrix_creation-fh.patch

*Almost* everything seems straightforward and correct but... Seems that MM(0) which has a "mutable == True" property/value should be updatable but the example "MM(0)[1,2] = 3" doesnt update MM(0) (see example below) Is that right?

What wasn't straightforward was to correctly find all the places which needed to be patched and to distinguish them from those who doesn't.\n\nNote that the speed regression when calling `copy(MM.zero_matrix())` is due to a missing optimization in cached_method which should be added soon.\n\n> Seems that MM(0) which has a \"mutable == True\" property/value should be updatable but the example \"MM(0)[1,2] = 3\" doesnt update MM(0) (see example below) Is that right?\n\n```\n> sage: MM(0)\n> [0 0 0]\n> [0 0 0]\n> [0 0 0]\n> \n> sage: MM(0)[1,2]=3 \n> \n> # this behavior is the same before and after patches were applied\n> # is this right? isnt MM(0) mutable and should be = 3 at row/col=[1,2]? \n> sage: MM(0)\n> [0 0 0]\n> [0 0 0]\n> [0 0 0]\n```\nThis is perfectly normal. `MM(0)` does not design a particular matrix object. It construct a brand new matrix. So that \n\n```\nsage: MM(0)[1,2]=3\n``` \nConstruct a matrix, modify it and forget about the result so that the next call to\n`MM(0)` gives you a brand new zero matrix. To achieve what you want you should write\n\n```\nsage: MM = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 3,3)\nsage: mat = MM(0); mat[1,2]=3\nsage: mat\n[0 0 0]\n[0 0 3]\n[0 0 0]\n```\n\nFlorent",

> *Almost* everything seems straightforward and correct but... 

Sure ! What wasn't straightforward was to correctly find all the places which needed to be patched and to distinguish them from those who doesn't.

Note that the speed regression when calling `copy(MM.zero_matrix())` is due to a missing optimization in cached_method which should be added soon.

> Seems that MM(0) which has a "mutable == True" property/value should be updatable but the example "MM(0)[1,2] = 3" doesnt update MM(0) (see example below) Is that right?

```

> [0 0 0]

```
This is perfectly normal. `MM(0)` does not design a particular matrix object. It construct a brand new matrix. So that 

```
sage: MM(0)[1,2]=3
``` 
Construct a matrix, modify it and forget about the result so that the next call to
`MM(0)` gives you a brand new zero matrix. To achieve what you want you should write

```
sage: MM = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 3,3)
sage: mat = MM(0); mat[1,2]=3
sage: mat
[0 0 0]
[0 0 3]
[0 0 0]
```

Used the new patches (as well as trac_8294-matrix_2x2_copy_mutability_fix-fh.patch). All were applied and compiled with no errors.

```
The following tests failed:
	sage -t  devel/sage/sage/groups/abelian_gps/dual_abelian_group_element.py # Segfault
	sage -t  devel/sage/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_2x2.pyx # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  devel/sage/doc/fr/tutorial/programming.rst # Segfault
```
Re-tested each and got the following for the first 2 (but the 3rd one passed).

```
A mysterious error (perhaps a memory error?) occurred, which may have crashed doctest.
```
I get this "mysterious error" a number of times and have seen many tickets mention it. Can anyone give any advice about it? Given its not always reproduceable, should it block a positive review if the tickets functionality proves good?

Note that my last version of the patch also implement 

```
zero = zero_matrix
```

Ok, I didn't read this thread this way, but yes, you're right, a majority seems to want exactly this behaviour.
The review patches now include also your last change.

I'm personally strongly opposed to this, so I am going to open a brief discussion on sage-devel, just to make sure that this is a general policy towards the categories framework. I hope to read your opinion there, too.

rossk: I guess it's fair to say, that you also contributed to this review, so please expand your name in the review field.
