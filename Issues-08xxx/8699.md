The two patches on this ticket provide documentation for the doctest coverage script, in addition to allowing that script to handle docstrings that are delimited by triple single quotes. Incidentally, using those patches I found that throughout the whole Sage library, only one method uses triple single quotes. The method in question is `BubbleSortGraph()` of the module `sage.graphs.graph_generators.py`. This means that for the 90% doctest coverage goal of Sage 5.0, we have one less method to document because it's already documented. See the following command line transcript:

Replying to [timdumol](#comment%3A6):
> attachment:trac_8699-documentation.patch works as advertised, but I believe attachment:trac_8699-single-quotes.patch will choke on something like this:


I don't think I understand your test case. Say I put your test case in a module, e.g. devel/sage-main/sage/graphs/graph_generators.py:

```diff
[mvngu@sage sage-main]$ hg diff
diff --git a/sage/graphs/graph_generators.py b/sage/graphs/graph_generators.py

+   [..]
+   bar baz
+   '''
+   pass
+
 class GraphGenerators():
     r"""

```

Running the doctest coverage script over this modified module reported the following:

```sh
[mvngu@sage sage-4.4.alpha0-8699-quotes]$ ./sage -coverage devel/sage-main/sage/graphs/graph_generators.py 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Missing doctests:
	 * foo():

----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

So we have added another function, which is missing doctests. Or do you mean that the coverage script needs to ensure a balance of triple single/double quotes? In that case, I think a decent text editor that supports Python/Cython syntax would do a better job to highlight if we have, say, a triple single quotes for starting a docstring but triple double quotes to end the docstring.

I realize that test case is wrong. Here's what I meant:

Inserting this:

```python

def foo():
   '''

   """

   """
   [..]
   
   EXAMPLES::

      sage: print 5
      5

```

into a file will result in a missing doctests warning, despite the fact that it does have a doctest. This is because the first triple single quote is matched with the first triple double quote, instead of the second triple single quote. It may be an extremely unlikely test case, but it is probably better to get this right now rather than puzzle over it in the far future.

Missing documentation:

```
with #14061 applied:

```
------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCORE test_8699.py: 50.0% (2 of 4)

Missing doctests:

Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):
     * line 18: def baz()
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
My test file:

```
def foo():
    '''

    bar baz
