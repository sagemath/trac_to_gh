Missing doctests:
	 * foo():

----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

So we have added another function, which is missing doctests. Or do you mean that the coverage script needs to ensure a balance of triple single/double quotes? In that case, I think a decent text editor that supports Python/Cython syntax would do a better job to highlight if we have, say, a triple single quotes for starting a docstring but triple double quotes to end the docstring.

<a id='comment:9'></a>I realize that test case is wrong. Here's what I meant:

Inserting this:

```python

def foo():
   '''
   foobarbaz
   """

   """
   [..]
   
   EXAMPLES::

      sage: print 5
      5
   '''
   pass
```

into a file will result in a missing doctests warning, despite the fact that it does have a doctest. This is because the first triple single quote is matched with the first triple double quote, instead of the second triple single quote. It may be an extremely unlikely test case, but it is probably better to get this right now rather than puzzle over it in the far future.
