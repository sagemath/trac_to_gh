I realize that test case is wrong. Here's what I meant:

Inserting this:

```python

def foo():
   '''
   foobarbaz
   """

   """
   [..]
   
   EXAMPLES::

      sage: print 5
      5
   '''
   pass
```

into a file will result in a missing doctests warning, despite the fact that it does have a doctest. This is because the first triple single quote is matched with the first triple double quote, instead of the second triple single quote. It may be an extremely unlikely test case, but it is probably better to get this right now rather than puzzle over it in the far future.

This seems to be fixed by #14061:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
test_8699.py
SCORE test_8699.py: 0% (0 of 4)

Missing documentation:
	 * foo():
	 * bar():
	 * baz():
	 * correct():

----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
with #14061 applied:

```
------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCORE test_8699.py: 50.0% (2 of 4)

Missing doctests:
     * line 1: def foo()
     * line 12: def bar()

Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):
     * line 18: def baz()
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
My test file:

```
def foo():
    '''
    foobarbaz
    """

    """
    [..]
    bar baz
    '''
    pass

def bar():
    '''
