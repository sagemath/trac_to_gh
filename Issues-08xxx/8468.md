Do the new review require more than just looking at 
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/8470-newdoc/thematic_tutorials/group_theory.html
and checking if it looks okay?

It looks okay to me by maybe Rob Beezer is a better judge since he wrote the original version.

Since you ask:-)
Other topics could be 

* automorphism groups of various structures (graphs, designs, codes, ...) 

* Cayley graphs of groups
 
* actions of groups on sets, 

* action of groups on polynomials and invariant theory.

* applications to the Rubik's cube.

I'm not saying you *should* do this or that it really needs to be done but you asked:-)

To summarize the thread, the tutorial could be expanded later but that is not the purpose of this patch. I have built the html and pdf documentation. The only defect I see is long lines in the pdf file.
I would suggest breaking these even though Sage output does not. However I don't think this is a prerequisite to
merging the patch and I am changing status to positive review.
