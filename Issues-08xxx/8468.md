Do the new review require more than just looking at 
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/8470-newdoc/thematic_tutorials/group_theory.html
and checking if it looks okay?

It looks okay to me by maybe Rob Beezer is a better judge since he wrote the original version.

One point is that it would be nice if the primer showed how to construct character tables. (I don't think that should be a prerequisite for positive review.)

Anything else anybody would want to see in an "advanced" section?

Since you ask:-)
Other topics could be 

* automorphism groups of various structures (graphs, designs, codes, ...) 

* Cayley graphs of groups
 
* actions of groups on sets, 

* action of groups on polynomials and invariant theory.

* applications to the Rubik's cube.

I'm not saying you *should* do this or that it really needs to be done but you asked:-)

To summarize the thread, the tutorial could be expanded later but that is not the purpose of this patch. I have built the html and pdf documentation. The only defect I see is long lines in the pdf file.
I would suggest breaking these even though Sage output does not. However I don't think this is a prerequisite to
merging the patch and I am changing status to positive review.
