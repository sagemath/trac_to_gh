The size of G is 1 because there is one edge, i.e. the single
self-loop. As shown by the above session, Sage reports the size of G
as 0. I believe this is a bug.

Notice that `degree()` reports the degree of a self-loop as one, when in fact it should be 2. That's because both `SparseGraphBackend` and `DenseGraphBackend` inherit the same `degree()` function from `CGraphBackend`. I think the implementation of `degree()` in `CGraphBackend` needs to take into account the existence of self-loops.
