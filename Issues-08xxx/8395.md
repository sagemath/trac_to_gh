sage: G = Graph({1:[1]}); G
Looped graph on 1 vertex

sage: G = Graph({1:[1]}, loops=True); G

sage: G = Graph({1:[1]}, loops=True, multiedges=True); G
Looped multi-graph on 1 vertex

0

The size of G is 1 because there is one edge, i.e. the single
self-loop. As shown by the above session, Sage reports the size of G
as 0. I believe this is a bug. 
```

See also the discussion at this [other sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/63b3c775da0421a8) thread. This also happens in the C graph backends for sparse and dense graphs:

```

Notice that `degree()` reports the degree of a self-loop as one, when in fact it should be 2. That's because both `SparseGraphBackend` and `DenseGraphBackend` inherit the same `degree()` function from `CGraphBackend`. I think the implementation of `degree()` in `CGraphBackend` needs to take into account the existence of self-loops.
