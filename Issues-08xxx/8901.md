IntegerVectors() seems to only include vectors with positive integer entries:

```
sage: [-1,4] in IntegerVectors()
False
```

Can the class be changed to include vectors with some/all negative integer entries as well, or create a new, larger class for all integer vectors (since I can imagine that having a class for positive integer vectors would be useful in some applications)?

Thanks,
Eva
