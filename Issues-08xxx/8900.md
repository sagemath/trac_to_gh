I noticed that this ticket was mentioned in `hopf_algebras.py` in a commented out TODO note for `antipode_by_coercion`, and it seemed like it would be used to do what ticket: 15573 is attempting to achieve (have product/coproduct/antipode for Hopf algebras automatically choose a realization where the corresponding method is defined). Did this ever make it into Sage, and if not, are there still any plans to put it in?
