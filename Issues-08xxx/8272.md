R has long since wanted iconv support, although there was an option to disable it. That option has now been removed, and R **must** have iconv. However, there is junk left over in R's spkg-install which tries to disable iconv, and reports it is doing so. 

```
Disabling libiconv support on Solaris
```

It likewise tries to do that same on OS X.
