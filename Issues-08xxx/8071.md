Matrices with zero rows or zero columns, over rings that are not fields, try to construct vector spaces as return values.  The return value should be built as a `FreeModule` which seems to promote the result to a vector space when the ring is a field.

Patch applies cleanly, looks good, doctests pass. The only nitpick I have is: shouldn't <code>:meth:\`sage.modules.free_module.VectorSpace\`</code> be `class:...`?

If that's fixed then this patch gets a positive review.

Hi Martin,

Thanks for the review on this one.  New patch contains everything, plus two changes in the docstring for `_right_kernel_trivial()` in `sage/matrix/matrix2.py` - both substitute "class" for "meth".  I am forever making that mistake - thanks for catching these.

Release manager - apply only the "dash-2" patch.

Rob
