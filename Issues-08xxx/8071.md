Matrices with zero rows or zero columns, over rings that are not fields, try to construct vector spaces as return values.  The return value should be built as a `FreeModule` which seems to promote the result to a vector space when the ring is a field.

```

sage: A.right_kernel()

When the ring is not a field or a PID, it is not always possible to create the submodule needed as a return value.

This function has been called in four places, and various doctests have been added.  This is the first step in refactoring and cleaning up some of the matrix code for kernels of matrices.

Patch applies cleanly, looks good, doctests pass. The only nitpick I have is: shouldn't `:meth:`sage.modules.free_module.VectorSpace`` be `class:...`?

If that's fixed then this patch gets a positive review.

Hi Martin,

Thanks for the review on this one.  New patch contains everything, plus two changes in the docstring for `_right_kernel_trivial()` in `sage/matrix/matrix2.py` - both substitute "class" for "meth".  I am forever making that mistake - thanks for catching these.

Release manager - apply only the "dash-2" patch.

Rob
