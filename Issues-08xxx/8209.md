Two issues: several docstrings contain `\mathtt{self`}, and jsMath doesn't recognize this command, so it's not typeset correctly, either with introspection from the notebook or in the reference manual.  Do this in the notebook, for example:

```
sage: a = 5
sage: a.is_power_of?
```
Or look at the docstring for `is_power_of` in sage.rings.integer in the reference manual (assuming you've built the ref manual with the '--jsmath' option).

Second, several docstrings use dollar signs, and while these are processed correctly for the reference manual (turning `$x=y$` into <code>\`x=y\`</code>), they are not dealt with in introspection in the notebook.  Evaluate `sage.categories.g_sets.GSets?`, for example: you'll see `$G$` rather than *G*.

The attached patch therefore does these things:

- moves the function `process_dollars` from SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/common/conf.py to SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/misc/sagedoc.py, where it can be used to format each docstring before displaying it.

- implements a similar function `process_mathtt` which converts `\mathtt{blah`} to `\verb|blah|`, which jsMath can handle.  Oh, except on the command line, it just turns `\mathtt{blah`} to `blah`, which I think is easier to read.
