Robert, this seems to be great work! However a small question: for *exact* symbolic input,
the truncated continued fraction should not depend on the initial floating-point
approximation, and should be a truncation of the (finite or infinite) continued fraction:

```
sage: continued_fraction(22/7,bits=4)
[3, 4]
sage: continued_fraction(22/7,bits=5)
[3, 8]
```
I guess the above should give instead:

```
sage: continued_fraction(RealIntervalField(4)(22/7))
[3]
sage: continued_fraction(RealIntervalField(5)(22/7))
[3]
```
Can the same problem happen with say sqrt(2), or is it only for rationals?

while I'm running the doctests, a few comments: (1) maybe the documentation should say that the
terms of the truncated continued fraction are (now) guaranteed exact (using interval arithmetic);
(2) `If nterms is given, the precision is increased until the specified number of terms can be computed`: if possible, for example 22/7 will give only two terms.

I also suggest giving an additional example showing that we can give as input a floating-point
interval, and the difference with a floating-point number (where initial rounding error can
give an incorrect result):

```
sage: continued_fraction(RealField(39)(e))
[2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 10, 2]
sage: continued_fraction(RealIntervalField(39)(e))
[2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 10]
```

In the meantime the doctests finished, and I get two failures:

```
sage -t  core2/devel/sage-8017/sage/combinat/words/word_generators.py # 1 doctests failed
sage -t  core2/devel/sage-8017/sage/tests/book_stein_ent.py # 13 doctests failed

positive review, good work, Robert! However I see as a side effect you had to change the doctests
in William's book, which has the consequence that those examples will not work any more as in the
book (but better now). This is a concern for me with the book we wrote about Sage (btw, the
doctest of the number theory chapter is ready for review, see #9395).
