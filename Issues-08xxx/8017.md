This does change the definition from "continued fraction expansion of a real approximation" to "truncation of continued fraction expansion." It also adds an nterms option to compute a specified number of terms.

Robert, this seems to be great work! However a small question: for *exact* symbolic input,
the truncated continued fraction should not depend on the initial floating-point
approximation, and should be a truncation of the (finite or infinite) continued fraction:

```
sage: continued_fraction(22/7,bits=4)
[3, 4]
sage: continued_fraction(22/7,bits=5)
[3, 8]
```
I guess the above should give instead:

```
sage: continued_fraction(RealIntervalField(4)(22/7))
[3]
sage: continued_fraction(RealIntervalField(5)(22/7))
[3]
```
Can the same problem happen with say sqrt(2), or is it only for rationals?

while I'm running the doctests, a few comments: (1) maybe the documentation should say that the
terms of the truncated continued fraction are (now) guaranteed exact (using interval arithmetic);
(2) `If nterms is given, the precision is increased until the specified number of terms can be computed`: if possible, for example 22/7 will give only two terms.

I also suggest giving an additional example showing that we can give as input a floating-point
interval, and the difference with a floating-point number (where initial rounding error can
give an incorrect result):

```
sage: continued_fraction(RealField(39)(e))
[2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 10, 2]
sage: continued_fraction(RealIntervalField(39)(e))
[2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 10]
```

In the meantime the doctests finished, and I get two failures:

```
sage -t  core2/devel/sage-8017/sage/combinat/words/word_generators.py # 1 doctests failed
sage -t  core2/devel/sage-8017/sage/tests/book_stein_ent.py # 13 doctests failed
