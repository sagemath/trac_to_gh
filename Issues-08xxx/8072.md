Asking for a kernel of a matrix over an integral domain has a dedicated chunk of code that tries to create a submodule as a return value.  Only there is no support for submodules over domains (just PIDs and fields).

I'll be going after this as part of a larger overhaul of matrix kernels generally.

sage: R.is_integral_domain()

sage: W
Ambient free module of rank 2 over the integral domain Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring

AttributeError: 'FreeModule_ambient_domain' object has no attribute 'submodule'
