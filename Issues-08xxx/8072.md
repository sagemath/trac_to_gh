Asking for a kernel of a matrix over an integral domain has a dedicated chunk of code that tries to create a submodule as a return value.  Only there is no support for submodules over domains (just PIDs and fields).

I'll be going after this as part of a larger overhaul of matrix kernels generally.

```
sage: R=ZZ['x']
sage: R.is_integral_domain()
True
sage: W=R^2
sage: W
Ambient free module of rank 2 over the integral domain Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: A=matrix(R,[1,2,3])
sage: A.right_kernel()

AttributeError: 'FreeModule_ambient_domain' object has no attribute 'submodule'
