When calculating the center of a group, GAP returns an empty list of generators if the center is trivial.  This however throws off the creation of the MatrixGroup in Sage which checks to ensure that there is at least one generator.

I added a patch which checks for a trivial center, and uses the identity for the group as a generator in this case.  

Sorry for the trailing whitespace differences.

Thank you for noticing this problem and submitting a patch.

I have not tested your patch yet, but it does not seem form reading the patch code that you have also added an example to the docstring which *tests* your new patch. If this is correct, can you please consider doing that?
