Hello!

Attached is the patch that should perform the required task. odd_girth() computes the odd girth of a graph using a property of the characteristic polynomial of the adjacency matrix. Its (theoretic) computational complexity is optimal.

Azi,

I took a quick look and it looks promising, especially since characteristic polynomials are quite fast in Sage.  I can look closer when I have a bit more time.

For now, documentation needs some work.  For example:

```
Any complete graph on more than 2 vertices contains a triangle and has thus odd girth 3 

	            G = graphs.CompleteGraph(10) 
	            sage: G.odd_girth() 
	            3
```

needs a double colon after the lead-in sentence (all 3 of your verbatim blocks need this).  And your line creating the complete graph needs a `sage:` preceding it.

Current documentation style needs "INPUT" and "OUTPUT" blocks - look around for examples.  They will be pretty simple in this case.

You can catch some of these yourself:

```
sage -b
sage -docbuild reference html
```

will rebuild the documentation and you can view the html file for mess-ups with the doc string.

And

```
sage -t <source file>
```

will find broken tests.

Rob

Dear Azi,

Your "literal block expected" error is caused by a double-colon after "EXAMPLES".  It should be a single, just to be typeset as-is.  A double-colon says verbatim (literal) stuff comes next.

The patch looks severely messed-up to me.  ;-(  I am not all sure how you got it to that state, but I think I can fix it.  Are you using clones or Mercurial queues?  Queues are much easier to deal with, and easier for iterative changes like this.

Don't try to fix the double-colon until I fix the patch (maybe later today).

Rob

Well, I sort of hope not, since I wrote that guide.  ;-)  It looks like something wasn't done quite right.

Guide discusses two approaches:  clones and queues.  I cannot even begin to help if I don't know which approach you are taking.  Let me know.

"consolidated" patch has previous work in one (proper) patch - still has azi's name on it, too.

See new "Apply" section in ticket description.

Azi -

1.  Start with a clean Sage installation (even if it means installing from source).
2.  Install a system version of Mercurial, or replace "hg" commands with "sage -hg"
3.  hg import <URL-to-consolidated-patch> (get URL from tiny download icon, not web-view of patch)
4.  hg qpush  (to apply patch)
5.  Rebuild sage, edit source, make changes, etc, etc.
6.  hg qrefresh -m "<A possible new message for patch summary goes here>"
7.  hg export qtip > <file-name-for-revised-patch>
8.  hg qpop (to move changes out of the way, and get back to original Sage, rebuild, etc)

You can use "hg qnew <private-name-for-patch>" to initiate a new project with no interference from previous one.  You can easily manage several activities with qpop/qpush, and "hg qpush --move" will allow applying patches out of order.  "hg qapplied", "hg qunapplied" are informative.  Hope this is helpful.
