The `sage-ptest` parallel doctesting script has some dead code in it: a function `run` that's unused, and a `-sage` flag that triggers a call to a no longer existing `sage-doctest_tex` script.

I'm attaching a patch that cleans this up, and as a side effect allows `sage-ptest` to test files with a `.sage` extension.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

Written as advertised, `run()` routine is never called, `doctest_tex` is no longer shipped as part of Sage.

Applies cleanly and works fine in limited testing.

Positive review.
