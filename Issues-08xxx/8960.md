I've split off changing the latex representation to #8962.

This patch also changes a deprecated call to MPFR, and redefines several functions to be aliases when it is more appropriate (e.g., self.prec is an alias to self.precision)

**Attachment:** [trac_8960-reviewer.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8960/trac_8960-reviewer.patch)

Changes in the reviewer patch include:

* Typo fixes.
* Fix errors/warnings with LaTeX markups in docstrings.
* Use error types, e.g. IndexError, etc., as callables in accordance with Python 3.x.
* Don't LaTeX expressions wherever that makes sense. For example, something like

 ```
 `self`
 ```
 would actually LaTeX the word "self".

Incidentally, I came across the following line

```
elif PY_TYPE_CHECK(x, gen) and typ((<gen>x).g) == t_REAL:
```
from the function

```
cdef _set(self, x, int base):
        # This should not be called except when the number is being created.    
        # Real Numbers are supposed to be immutable.
<...>
```
Notice the call

```
typ((<gen>x).g)
```
Should this be

```
type((<gen>x).g)
```
That is, use "type" instead of "typ"?



Apart from the above, I'm OK with Jason's changes. So only my patch needs review by anyone but me.
