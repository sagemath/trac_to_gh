Currently, there's no obvious way to pass the marker option to matplotlib when plotting individual points, which would be mostly with this option.

It appears that plot() has deviated from other plot types, since it does allow the marker option, but apparently only for function plots.

using plot(points(point_list),marker='x') ignores the marker option
using list_plot(point_list,marker='x') or points(point_list,marker='x') gives a warning:
  verbose 0 (136: primitive.py, options) WARNING: Ignoring option 'marker'=x
but displays the points nevertheless, though ignoring the marker option.

Also, setting plot.options['marker'] = 'x' or Graphics().SHOW_OPTIONS['marker'] = 'x' do not work.

Somewhat related to #4529, #1431 and #5448, which seem to be related to not passing kwargs to matplotlib.

So far, I haven't been able to find a way to seamless join matplotlib's system with the sage.plot options.
