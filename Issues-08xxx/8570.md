Currently, there's no obvious way to pass the marker option to matplotlib when plotting individual points, which would be mostly with this option.

It appears that plot() has deviated from other plot types, since it does allow the marker option, but apparently only for function plots.

using plot(points(point_list),marker='x') ignores the marker option
using list_plot(point_list,marker='x') or points(point_list,marker='x') gives a warning:
  verbose 0 (136: primitive.py, options) WARNING: Ignoring option 'marker'=x
but displays the points nevertheless, though ignoring the marker option.

Also, setting plot.options['marker'] = 'x' or Graphics().SHOW_OPTIONS['marker'] = 'x' do not work.

Somewhat related to #4529, #1431 and #5448, which seem to be related to not passing kwargs to matplotlib.

So far, I haven't been able to find a way to seamless join matplotlib's system with the sage.plot options.

I think it would be a good design decision to just bundle the plotjoined=True features in with line() (i.e., eliminate the plotjoined=True features in listplot, and just make listplot about plotting points).

In fact, scatter_plot should be deprecated in favor of just points().  If we do that, then we need to make points() have more options (like edgecolor, markerstyle, etc.).

Incidentally, I think the `list_plot` syntax in 2 and 3 dims is because Mma uses this, right?  We'd need a deprecation period or to keep the alias.

See also #13830.
