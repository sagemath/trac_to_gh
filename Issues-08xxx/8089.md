```

 == Possible solution ==
I note from the ECL mailing list, that this option to configure might fix this, though it might need a later CVS snapshot. 

\# --with-dffi=no is required to bypass inline assembly errors

The latest version of Sage has ECL 10.2.1. Whilst the problem observed above still exists, the configure option 

```
--with-dffi=no
```
is implemented in this version of ECL. 

A new spkg which resolves this problem by adding that option can be found at:

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/ecl-10.2.1.p0.spkg

All I needed to do was add this bit of code:

```
if [ "x`uname -rsm`" = "xSunOS 5.11 i86pc" ] && [ "x$SAGE64" = xyes ]  ; then
   # Need to add --with-dffi=no to disable assembly code on OpenSolaris x64. 
   # This may be needed for other variants of Solaris, but for now at least
   # the option is only given if all the following are true
   # 1) OpenSolaris (SunOS 5.11)
   # 2) Intel or AMD CPU 
   # 3) 64-bit build
   ./configure --prefix=$SAGE_LOCAL --with-dffi=no
else
   ./configure --prefix=$SAGE_LOCAL 
fi
```

to ensure the option is only given on OpenSolaris (SunOS 5.11) with an Intel/AMD CPU if built in 64-bit mode. Whether the option would be needed on Solaris 10, or with SPARC processors I don't know. So for now it is applied in very specific circumstances. 

With that configure option added, ECL then builds properly.
