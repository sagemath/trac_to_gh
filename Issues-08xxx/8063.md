I'm not sure I'd personally bother sorting out SAGE64 issues in packages unless they are building 32-bit, which this one is not. 

But you have also removed Michael Abshoff as a maintainer, and also removed the 

```
echo "64 bit MacIntel"
```

so I would agree the fixes are desirable. 

I would search for packages which are building 32-bit. 

```
$ file local/lib/* | grep 32-bit
$ file local/lib/* | grep 32-bit
```

and only bother fixing them.
