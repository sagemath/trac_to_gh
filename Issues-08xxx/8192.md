* gat parser added
* Disabled keyboard interrupt handling (but re-raised)
* Fixed critical bug in normal form
* Naming convention: `minimalElements` -> `minimal_elements`
* has_constant_part for variable/monomial
* `lead/lex_lead/lead_deg/lex_lead_deg` also for Variable/Monomial
* iterator for literal factorization
* Added treatment of customizable settings for `BOOST_LIBRARY`,`SHCFLAGS`, `SHCCFLAGS`, and `SHCXXFLAGS`
* Improved Sun Studio compatibility
* Fix for hpux (CUDD needs `pwd.h`)

This should be relatively straight forward then.

Indeed, the polybori-0-6-3*spkg's contain a clone of PolyBoRi's mercurial repository as well a a mercurial repository of the Sage-related patches,  The polybori-0-6-4.spkg only has the patch repo. 

What is Sage's policy here?

Best regards,

Hi Mike,

I'm afraid your SPKG will need a new ticket since this one was merged in 4.4 already. 

Your SPKG builds fine on sage.math, however I get

```
Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m0.06s, Wall time 0m0.88s).

```

which is likely unrelated to your SPKG? I will build a fresh 4.4 to check.

Yep, I think using that one would be fine for now.  I'll look into these segfaults and make a new ticket.

Both the 0.6.4.spkgs here give those crashes reported above, but only once in every 10-15 runs.

Hi Willem Jan,

The crashes are probably caused by the fact that I disabled the code that statically links polybori in the new package. IIRC, we were doing that exactly because of these double free errors. We tested the new package on different platforms, and didn't see the crashes, so we assumed the problem was fixed.

I don't have time to reproduce the problem, or test new packages at the moment. Can you try enabling the static build and try again?

From the diff of the changes (of an earlier version of the package in Alexander Dreyer's home dir), this looks like the relevant change:

```
diff --git a/patches/SConstruct b/patches/SConstruct
--- a/patches/SConstruct
+++ b/patches/SConstruct

+gb=env.StaticLibrary(GBPath('groebner'), gb_src)#+[libpb])
 
 #print "gb:", gb, dir(gb)

```


BTW, this also looks suspect to me:

Hi Burcin,

I think, we removed  the call of` remove_dylib`  from `spkg-install`. So reintroducing `remove_dylib` may fit it already.

Hi Willem Jan,

I changed than remove_dynlib only at:

!http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/polybori-0.6.4-p1.spkg

Is this enough to fix the problem?

Since I was not able to reproduce the problem: Can you test it? (How do you run it?)

Best regards,

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:30'></a>\nHi Alexander,\n\nYes, I don't get the errors anymore with that package. (After renaming the spkg to polybori-0.6.4.p1.spkg and the directory inside it to match the spkg filename.)\n\nI test it by running sage through valgrind and seeing if there are any errors on exit in polybori files, since the actual crashes happen here only once every 10-15 runs or so.\n\n\nStill I can't help but wonder if there's something subtle going wrong with sage's interface to polybori or in polybori itself on exit to require static linking.

Hi Alexander,

Yes, I don't get the errors anymore with that package. (After renaming the spkg to polybori-0.6.4.p1.spkg and the directory inside it to match the spkg filename.)

I test it by running sage through valgrind and seeing if there are any errors on exit in polybori files, since the actual crashes happen here only once every 10-15 runs or so.


Still I can't help but wonder if there's something subtle going wrong with sage's interface to polybori or in polybori itself on exit to require static linking. Maybe something like multiple libraries sharing a global memory manager and each of them trying to clean up global structures on quit or something similar...


Thanks!
-Willem Jan

From [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/ff294013a41ea05c):



Sage 4.4.1.alpha2 contains two PolyBoRi spkg's:

* polybori-0.6.3-20091028.spkg
* polybori-0.6.4.spkg

I think polybori-0.6.4.spkg is the newer one, so I deleted the other one from `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/`. Here's a diff between the `spkg-install` of polybori-0.6.3-20091028.spkg and polybori-0.6.4.spkg:

I replaced polybori-0.6.4.spkg with

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/spkg/standard/polybori/polybori-0.6.4.p0.spkg

The latter spkg restores the command "remove_dynlib". I then built Sage 4.4.1.alpha2 from scratch on sage.math with polybori-0.6.4.p0.spkg. Doctesting resulted in the following failure:

I have wrapped up a sage.math binary of this patched version of Sage 4.4.1.alpha2. You can find it at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/sage.math-bin/sage-4.4.1.alpha2-patched-sage.math.washington.edu-x86_64-Linux.tar.gz

I removed the directory

`SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/`

and wrapped up a source distribution, which can be found at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/sage-src/sage-4.4.1.alpha2-patched.tar

I'm wondering if we should create a new ticket for this new polybori p0 spkg.
In any case, I tested it, and it works fine for me.
