This is a possible problem when using an external maxima, that uses a backend other then ecl.

clisp has some peculiar ways to figure out there is an associated pty, that is created by pty.py from pexpect interface.

gcl hangs due to an "unexcaped" ecl specific command at the start of maxima interface; this took quite some time to find, as I was thinking it was a clisp like related issue, and tried to correct the problem in gcl and/or sage-maxima.lisp.

With the attached patch, going to be used in mandriva rpm, all currently maxima backends works in sage. (When installing sagemath, unless using --auto-select, the installation process will ask what package that provides maxima-backend the user wants, and the options are sbcl, clisp, gcl and ecl).

[The first chunk of the patch is not applicable to sage, as I use a modified clisp and maxima, that checks the --disable-readline option]

I asked in http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gcl-devel/2010-03/msg00000.html about some possible solution for the issue of gcl backend hanging, but now I believe I found a better workaround, so that, maxima gcl backend has the same behavior as other lisps.

The problem is that adapting the solution used for clisp in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-maxima.lisp `was not enough, as for some reason, the predicate `(output-stream-p *standard-input*) `was still true in the maxima parsing error message code.

The new patch should correct the issue, or at least, now it doesn't hang in the doctect

`sage: maxima.eval('sage0: x == x;')`

Here's what happens in Maxima.

```

(%i4) 1+1;;

(%o4) 2

stdin:76667:incorrect syntax: Premature termination of input at ;.
;
 ^
```
I'm just going to make a ticket for that - it's #12372.

This is still a somewhat weird ticket.  I didn't even know we allowed other Maxima backends officially.

I do not remember the exact reason I used the "1+1;;" example. Maybe as a hint to show that the interface was very fragile.

I did the initial work to make maxima clisp backend functional because at the time I worked in the first sagemath package it was the lisp used by sage.

I just tested, and all backends (clisp, gcl, ecl, and sbcl) appear functional in my sagemath package.

The patch used is still sage-4.3.3-maxima.patch (renamed/rediffed) and the related maxima patch is http://svn.mandriva.com/viewvc/packages/cooker/maxima/current/SOURCES/maxima-5.23.0-clisp-noreadline.patch?view=markup that should need a somewhat recent clisp, that understands the -disable-readline option (it was added upstream due to my bug report about this same issue).

In the case of my sagemath rpm package, for quite some time it requires maxima-runtime-ecl, so, only experienced users should usually install other backends in normal conditions due to never being asked to choose one, at least when installing sagemath.
