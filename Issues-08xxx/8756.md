------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in Sage.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

Whoever investigates this, here was another segfault in the planarity testing that was fixed a while ago: #4509

I hope they're not related, but it might be something to keep in mind if someone is investigating the issue (maybe someone can try *just* running the code on connected graphs, or just on disconnected graphs to try to narrow things down). In that case, according to John Boyer (the author of the C code we use):

"I'll say up front that you're absolutely right that my reference implementation does not pay any real attention to isolated vertices as they have nothing really to do with the correctness of the algorithm."

The problem in that case was that we were segfaulting on graphs with vertices of degree zero (i.e., isolated vertices).  I wonder if that is causing a problem somewhere else in his code, or if somehow we are seeing the same issue again (was that code changed recently?).

One possible option is to upgrade to John Boyer's latest complete rewrite of planarity testing code, of which he says:

"the only code on which I am comfortable with claiming support for disconnected graphs is the new "version 2.0" code.

"The reason I say it is possibly fortunate is that it should be precious little effort for you to consider adopting this new code since I kept backwards compatibility at a high priority. You are quite unlikely to have done anything that is not supported under the new code, though I can help you if there are *any* issues. Best of all, you can actually get the code because I've made it publicly available from a Google Code project.

I attached three patches.  The first removes the current version of the planarity code from Sage.  The second updates the planarity C code to the most recent SVN version of John Boyer's code (at  http://code.google.com/p/planarity).  The third makes some changes in Sage so that it will compile and build.

These patches are against 4.3.4, and are after the networkx upgrading patches in my queue, so they may depend on upgrading networkx to 1.0.1 (see #7608).

The patches do not conform to the standards (no good commit messages; no trac number noted), and may possibly break other stuff.  However, -long doctests pass in graphs/*.py[x], and John Boyer said that he worked hard to make the new code compatible with the old code, so I *hope* the patches work.

I mainly post these to provide a starting point for someone to finish fixing this.  I'll probably do it in several weeks (after the semester ends) if someone else hasn't done it.

Ideally, we'd make this a standard spkg at this point, instead of including this code in Sage.  ncohen I think would know how to do that (i.e., make a standard spkg that a pyx file in Sage depends on to compile).

This was because I haven't submitted a paper covering this one, though I do now have the write-up for it as part of a larger paper.  Anyway, sorry about the inconvenience here. I've amended the files to apply the bsd license to the K4 search, so if you simply download the trunk again, using your patch technique to get rid of nauty, you should be good to go."

So the above patch should be rebased on the current SVN sources of the planarity code (with the right license statements on those files).

Previously, **every** long test run on planarity.pyx failed on my Ubuntu 9.04 x86/Prescott (gcc 4.3.3) (see http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/msg/560824983a71627f).

After applying the three patches on top of 4.4.2.rc0 (no rejects), all seems fine: 
Running 100 times

```
./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/graphs/planarity.pyx
```
no errors occurred. (Also `devel/sage/sage/graphs` passed.)

Just for the record, the (second) patch contains two Eclipse project files (and some text files for comparing the output of tests I guess).

I tried ~5 times to get the new ones (I saw the changes in trac) but the browser always "downloaded" the old ones... 8/

The new ones still work with Ubuntu 9.04 x86/Prescott. :)

I don't have apples here (besides a IIe), so somebody else has to test/fix that.

The patch just `#define`s `_XOPEN_SOURCE` (if not already defined) and includes `stdlib.h` instead of `malloc.h` in two files.

Note that compiling with `-std=c99` (ISO C99) already implies presence of `stdlib.h` (and `malloc()` being defined *there*).
