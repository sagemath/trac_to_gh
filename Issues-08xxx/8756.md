------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in Sage.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:6\" align=\"right\">comment:6</div>\n\nWhoever investigates this, here was another segfault in the planarity testing that was fixed a while ago: #4509\n\nI hope they're not related, but it might be something to keep in mind if someone is investigating the issue (maybe someone can try *just* running the code on connected graphs, or just on disconnected graphs to try to narrow things down). In that case, according to John Boyer (the author of the C code we use):\n\n\"I'll say up front that you're absolutely right that my reference implementation does not pay any real attention to isolated vertices as they have nothing really to do with the correctness of the algorithm.\"\n\nThe problem in that case was that we were segfaulting on graphs with vertices of degree zero (i.e., isolated vertices).  I wonder if that is causing a problem somewhere else in his code, or if somehow we are seeing the same issue again (was that code changed recently?).\n\nOne possible option is to upgrade to John Boyer's latest complete rewrite of planarity testing code, of which he says:\n\n\"the only code on which I am comfortable with claiming support for disconnected graphs is the new \"version 2.0\" code.\n\n\"The reason I say it is possibly fortunate is that it should be precious little effort for you to consider adopting this new code since I kept backwards compatibility at a high priority. You are quite unlikely to have done anything that is not supported under the new code, though I can help you if there are *any* issues.

Whoever investigates this, here was another segfault in the planarity testing that was fixed a while ago: #4509

I hope they're not related, but it might be something to keep in mind if someone is investigating the issue (maybe someone can try *just* running the code on connected graphs, or just on disconnected graphs to try to narrow things down). In that case, according to John Boyer (the author of the C code we use):

"I'll say up front that you're absolutely right that my reference implementation does not pay any real attention to isolated vertices as they have nothing really to do with the correctness of the algorithm."

The problem in that case was that we were segfaulting on graphs with vertices of degree zero (i.e., isolated vertices).  I wonder if that is causing a problem somewhere else in his code, or if somehow we are seeing the same issue again (was that code changed recently?).

One possible option is to upgrade to John Boyer's latest complete rewrite of planarity testing code, of which he says:

"the only code on which I am comfortable with claiming support for disconnected graphs is the new "version 2.0" code.

"The reason I say it is possibly fortunate is that it should be precious little effort for you to consider adopting this new code since I kept backwards compatibility at a high priority. You are quite unlikely to have done anything that is not supported under the new code, though I can help you if there are *any* issues. Best of all, you can actually get the code because I've made it publicly available from a Google Code project.

Ideally, we'd make this a standard spkg at this point, instead of including this code in Sage.  ncohen I think would know how to do that (i.e., make a standard spkg that a pyx file in Sage depends on to compile).

I tried ~5 times to get the new ones (I saw the changes in trac) but the browser always "downloaded" the old ones... 8/

The new ones still work with Ubuntu 9.04 x86/Prescott. :)

I don't have apples here (besides a IIe), so somebody else has to test/fix that.

Funny, I just realized that *this* doctest failure seemed to have vanished in 4.4.3.alpha0 (again on Ubuntu 9.04 x86/32-bit, ptestlong), because there's now *another* test failing, but in `sage/graphs/generic_graph.py`.

Testing only the single file `sage/graphs/planarity.pyx` on vanilla 4.4.3.alpha0, it reproducably shows up again.

I'll apply this patch to 4.4.3.alpha0 later...
