With that in mind, you should probably change README.txt.  It is
woefully out of date, and not tracked by HG as far as I can tell.
E.g.,

NOT OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED, BUT NEARLY WORKS
------------------------------------------

PROCESSOR  OPERATING SYSTEM
SPARC      Solaris 10 -- nearly works
x86        Apple Mac OS X 10.6.x (64-bit) -- see trac #7095.
x86_64     Solaris 10 -- does not work
x86_64     Apple Mac OS X 10.5.x (64-bit) -- needs 64-bit gFortran
          instead of g95

It should also say something about removing /sw from your PATH on Mac.

Just a very minor point to go along with Minh's potential followup ticket for the "q":

```
PPC              Apple Mac OS X 10.5.x, 10.6.x 
```
is wrong as well, since of course Apple intentionally removed PPC support from OS X 10.6.
