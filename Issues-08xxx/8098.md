I was just grading papers in my class and one student (Andrew Ohana) pointed out in his solution that Sage's solve_mod is massively broken.  For example:

```
sage: var('x')
sage: solve_mod([x^2==1], 9)
[]         # WTF?
```
and:

```
sage: solve_mod([x^2==1], 8)
[(1,), (3,), (4,), (5,), (7,)]
```

Etc.

I tried to chase down the bug but it seems the rabbit hole goes deeper (all the way to multivariate singular polynomial evaluation). 

```
sage: P.<x,y> = Zmod(3^2)[]
sage: f=P(x*x)
sage: f(3,0)
1

sage: P.<x,y> = Zmod(10)[]
sage: f=P(x*y)
sage: f(2,5)
1
```

I think the problem is in the `__call__` method in http://sagenb.org/src/libs/singular/polynomial.pyx/ but its all Cython land there, so I can't do much. In any case seems that Singular is fine, and something gets lost in the translation.

```
> ring R= (integer,9),(x,y),dp;
> poly f=x2;
> subst(f,x,3,y,0);
0
```

We need a Singular expert to comment on this.

Note that the function we call is `fast_map()` and it returns `1` as the generator of the ideal in this case.

The Singular map works fine in my somewhat ancient Singular version here...

```

```

Does this fail with newer versions?

There's a discussion on this matter on [libsingular-devel], cf. http://groups.google.com/group/libsingular-devel/browse_thread/thread/bd0aa6c4d7b6ecc3

This still doesn't explain why subst works but I guess it uses a different code path.

I tried the doctests, but unfortunately one more test is Segfaulting wrt #7773:

```
[zimmerma@coing sage]$ sage -t -verbose rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx
...
Trying:
    f(Integer(0),Integer(0),Integer(0))###line 1725:_sage_    >>> f(0,0,0)
Expecting:
    0


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------
```
Since this is precisely linked to the modified file, I give a negative review.
