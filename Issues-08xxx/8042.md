Well, I can tell you what's going wrong here, and ways to work around it -- but I'll wait until I'm more coherent to post a patch.

Here's what's happening: despite the fact that you're on a 64-bit machine, C says `sizeof(int)` is still `4`. However, Python knows it's a 64-bit box, so Python's `int` type is now a full 64 bits. So in the bit of code you called, and in several places in the NTL interface, we convert from Python `int`s to C `int`s. That's the underlying problem: we really want to be using `long` in this case, because it actually has room to store the values we care about. The NTL `ZZ` constructor is more than happy to take a long as input, so there's also no problem there.

The easiest fix is just to switch the type of the constructor in `sage/libs/cremona/defs.pxi` ... here's a diff:

```
diff -r 868098cc41e9 sage/libs/cremona/defs.pxi
--- a/sage/libs/cremona/defs.pxi        Sat Jan 23 00:06:24 2010 -0800
+++ b/sage/libs/cremona/defs.pxi        Sat Jan 23 00:18:48 2010 -0800
@@ -1,7 +1,7 @@
 cdef extern from "eclib/interface.h":
     ctypedef struct bigint:  #eclib uses NTL in Sage -- we call Cremona's "bigint" ZZ_c.
         pass

+    ZZ_c new_bigint "to_ZZ"(long)
     int I2int(ZZ_c)
 
 cdef extern from "eclib/bigrat.h":
```
That fixes the issue. 

However, I suspect that this is something that pops up elsewhere -- so I'd like to at least look a few other places and fix this issue there, too. For instance, we have exactly the same issue in the NTL interface ... and it's easy enough to fix there, too.

Thanks a lot for the quick resolution. I am glad that you picked this up so quickly for I would not have found this error myself.

I will do the test and review this afternoon - even if, as a non-specialists in the ntl interface, I am maybe not the right person to do this review.

At the moment I am putting in some bug fixes into mwrank (so, part of eclib, but not in facte relevant to modular symbols), and after that is done Robert Miller and I will be working on the sage/eclib interface anyway.  So a ticket to develop the sage/eclib interface would be good to have in place.\n\nRegarding LiDIA, in effect I no longer support it, and it would be possible to recode mwrank to avoid this dual support.  That would not, of course, be difficult, but it would also not add any functionality, so it's not a high priority for me.  But it would be good to do that before doing much to the sage/eclib interface, since surely that would be easier if all the ZZs actually looked like the ZZs they really are!",

That sounds like a good idea.  At the moment I am putting in some bug fixes into mwrank (so, part of eclib, but not in facte relevant to modular symbols), and after that is done Robert Miller and I will be working on the sage/eclib interface anyway.  So a ticket to develop the sage/eclib interface would be good to have in place.

Regarding LiDIA, in effect I no longer support it, and it would be possible to recode mwrank to avoid this dual support.  That would not, of course, be difficult, but it would also not add any functionality, so it's not a high priority for me.  But it would be good to do that before doing much to the sage/eclib interface, since surely that would be easier if all the ZZs actually looked like the ZZs they really are!
