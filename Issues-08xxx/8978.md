There has been a recent report about Sage not building on (64bit) OpenSuse 11., see 

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/6947016a2d3f664e#

One issue is readline, and if one looks at the following snippet from the readline-6.0.p1 spkg-install:

```
if [ -f /etc/SuSE-release ]; then
    if [ `grep 11.1 /etc/SuSE-release > /dev/null; echo $?` -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "OpenSUSE 11.1 detected"
        if [ -d /usr/include/readline/ ]; then
            echo "The development version of libreadline is installed -> copying"
            if [ `uname -p` = "x86_64" ]; then
                cp /lib64/libreadline.so.* "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib
            else
                cp /lib/libreadline.so.* "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib
            fi
            cp -r /usr/include/readline  "$SAGE_LOCAL"/include
            exit 0
```
it seems clear why this did work for OpenSuse 11.1 --- but not OpenSuse 11.2.
The user report mentioned also a problem with building Symmetrica (probably $SAGE64 is not set, but should).
Maybe there are even more problems lurking.

Can someone confirm these issues (I don't have access to a 64bit OpenSuse 11.2 installation myself)?

Update:

It turned out (see the above thread) the Symmetrica spkg needed a change to its makefile:

```
... move the math library link option "-lm" somewhere *after*
the object file "nb.o", but before (I did it *right* before) the last
"-o test"". ...
```
and also applying #8844 was necessary. With these three changes (new readline.spkg, new symmetrica.spkg, patched module_list.py), Sage seems to build and start up the Sage interpreter OK. Starting the Sage notebook seems to have one more issue left:

```
I am now seeing an error message when starting the sage notebook - see below.

If I display http://localhost:8000 instead of
http://localhost:8000/?startup_token=ae62addaf110060a2765c595ea17d16
the notebook works OK.
Best, Paul

Just for the record, the position of `-o foo` is irrelevant; it's usually safe to put libraries (in the right order if appropriate, perhaps interspersed with `-L`s) just at the end of the line.
