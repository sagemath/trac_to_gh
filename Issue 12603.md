I will review this patch as soon as I get the doctests to pass without the patch applied...

This doesn't seem to apply to 5.0.beta11 (or to beta3, or to 4.8). The relevant code hasn't changed for years, so my guess is that you built this patch on top of some other patch and forgot to note the dependency?

Patchbot says doctests pass. Looks good to me.
