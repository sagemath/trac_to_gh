Assignee: mhampton

CC:  @mstreng

Keywords: rational point points conic quadratic form number field

The patch at #727 is very big and most of it does not need #9334, so I will move all number field functionality here.

Requires #727, #2329, #9334

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10621

Sorry I didn't make the September deadline...

Looks basically good, but I get some doctest failures after applying (successfully) to 4.8.alpha4:

```
	sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/plane_conics/con_rational_field.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/plane_conics/con_field.py # 2 doctests failed
	sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/plane_conics/con_number_field.py # 6 doctests failed
```
Mostly they are this:

```
     File "/home/jec/sage-4.8.alpha4/local/lib/python/site-packages/sage/schemes/plane_conics/con_number_field.py", line 249, in has_rational_point
        pt = self.point(T*vector([KtoB(isnorm[1][0]),
    NameError: global name 'vector' is not defined
```
and also there is this:

```
File "/home/jec/sage-4.8.alpha4/devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/plane_conics/con_number_field.py", line 290:
    sage: f = (2*O).factor(); f
Expected:
    (Fractional ideal (-a^2 - a + 1)) * (Fractional ideal (-a^2 + 2*a - 3))
Got:
    (Fractional ideal (-a^2 - a + 1)) * (Fractional ideal (a^2 - 2*a + 3))
```
which is of course trivial, and probably due to a Pari change in the interim. 

Fix these and I'll give it a positive review!
