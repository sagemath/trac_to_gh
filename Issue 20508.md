This looks like a lot of very nice and very useful code! I have just started to play around with it and have two quick comments:

- `SimplicialSets` is not in the global namespace, whereas `SimplicialComplex` is globally available per default. 

- I tried `TestSuite(RP7).run()` and got lots of errors, presumably because `an_element` is not implemented.

I have no fixed opinion whether these observations count as faults or facts, though.

I didn't try that. It might be worth looking into.

I just tried (and eventually succeeded) to construct the quotient `RP7/RP4` and to compute its cohomology. My first approach failed, since I found no way to define the inclusion map:


```
sage: RP4 = sage.homology.simplicial_set_catalog.RealProjectiveSpace(4)
sage: RP7 = sage.homology.simplicial_set_catalog.RealProjectiveSpace(7)
sage: X=Hom(RP4,RP7)
sage: X({i:i for i in RP4.nondegenerate_simplices()})
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: this simplex is not in this simplicial set
```

Can this be done somehow?

A possibly related problem is that the ambient spaces are different; maybe they (and the projective spaces) should have unique representation?

```
sage: RP4.ambient_space() is RP7.ambient_space()
False
```


(Apologies if this is explained in the documentation somewhere - I usually only read documentation as a last resort.)

I thought about unique representation; my conclusion was that it was the wrong thing to do. If you construct two 4-spheres, you want them to be different so you can take their disjoint union, etc. A related implementation detail is that when you construct an abstract n-simplex, it is always distinct from previously created ones.

The easiest way to do what you're talking about is

```
sage: RP7 = simplicial_sets.RealProjectiveSpace(7)
sage: RP4 = RP7.n_skeleton(4)
sage: RP4.inclusion_map()
...
sage: RP7.quotient(RP4)
...
```

Or I think you also do

```
sage: C2 = groups.misc.MultiplicativeAbelian([2])
sage: BC2 = simplicial_sets.ClassifyingSpace(C2)
sage: RP7 = BC2.n_skeleton(7)
sage: RP4 = BC2.n_skeleton(4)
```

to get a common ambient space.

I get your point and I now see that this is also very well explained in the documentation.

I don't understand the origin of the term `f_vector`: I can see that this is also used in the other cell complex related parts, but what might the "f" stand for? I'm just curious here...

I have just tried to implement the "Catalan simplicial set", modeled on your code for the nerve of a monoid. It seems to work fine, but I get this error from `all_n_simplices`:


```
sage: Cat.all_n_simplices(3)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: this simplicial set may be infinite, so specify max_dim
```


I think this could be fixed by changing one line in the definition of `all_n_simplices`, i.e. change

```
 non_degen = [_ for _ in self.nondegenerate_simplices() if _.dimension() <= n]
```

to 

```
 non_degen = [_ for _ in self.nondegenerate_simplices(max_dim=n) if _.dimension() <= n]
```


I have noted that the classifying spaces currently do not have an "all_n_simplices" method.

```
sage: X
Classifying space of Finite Field of size 3
sage: X.all_n_simplices(5)
...
AttributeError: 'Nerve_with_category' object has no attribute 'all_n_simplices'
```

Is this deliberate?

It seems there are some other calls to `nondegenerate_simplices(...)` that should have an approriate `max_dim` value: if I try to compute the homology of this Catalan simplicial set I otherwise get an error:

```
sage: Cat.chain_complex(dimensions=range(5))
...
NotImplementedError: this simplicial set may be infinite, so specify max_dim
```

I'm attaching my code so that you can see what I'm doing.

One strange thing is that my `Cat` has a couple of useful methods (e.g. `homology`) that are missing from the classifying spaces. The only relevant difference that I'm aware of is their categories, though that should add *more* methods, not hide them:

```
sage: Cat.categories()
[Category of simplicial sets,
 Category of sets,
 Category of sets with partial maps,
 Category of objects]
sage: simplicial_sets.ClassifyingSpace(GF(3)).categories()
[Category of pointed simplicial sets,
 Category of simplicial sets,
 Category of sets,
 Category of sets with partial maps,
 Category of objects]
```

I think something like 

```
simplicial_sets.ClassifyingSpace(GF(3)).betti(3)
```

should probably work out of the box (i.e. without explicitly taking a skeleton).

> It seems there are some other calls to `nondegenerate_simplices(...)` that should have an approriate `max_dim` value: if I try to compute the homology of this Catalan simplicial set I otherwise get an error:

The issue here is that your `Cat` inherits from `SimplicialSet`:

```
sage: sage.homology.simplicial_set.SimplicialSet?
Init signature: sage.homology.simplicial_set.SimplicialSet(self, data, base_point=None, name=None, check=True, category=None)
Docstring:     
   A finite simplicial set.

   ...
```

So it is assumed to be finite, which means it has more methods defined for it, like `chain_complex`, which are not defined for (for example) classifying spaces. Classifying spaces instead inherit from `SimplicialSet_arbitrary`. Note that `SimplicialSet` is just an alias for `SimplicialSet_finite`, and we could get rid of this alias and delete `SimplicialSet` if it would be clearer that way.

Methods like `betti` come from the class `GenericCellComplex`, and those are assumed to be finite. So we would need to implement `betti` for `SimplicialSet_arbitrary`, which we could do. Maybe also `chain_complex` and `n_chains`.

I'm puzzled by the following output: the zeroeth cohomology only comes out right once:


```

Classifying space of Finite Field of size 3

I could imagine that this is a pointed vs. non-pointed issue, but I see the same behaviour for my Catalan set, which has no basepoint.

I think it would be valuable if one could construct simplices in a classifying space from the corresponding sequence of monoid elements. Here's how I currently construct a map from RP2 to BD8:

```
sage: D8=DihedralGroup(4)
sage: X=simplicial_sets.ClassifyingSpace(D8)
sage: g=D8((1,3))
sage: RP2=simplicial_sets.RealProjectiveSpace(2)
sage: e0,e1,e2 = RP2.nondegenerate_simplices()
sage: H=Hom(RP2,X)
sage: X.n_skeleton(2) ;# hack to create X._simplex_data
Simplicial set with 57 non-degenerate simplices
sage: i=H({e0:X.base_point(),e1:dict(X._simplex_data)[(g,)],e2:dict(X._simplex_data)[(g,g)]}) ; i
Simplicial set morphism:
  From: RP^2
  To:   Classifying space of Dihedral group of order 8 as a permutation group
  Defn: [1, f, f * f] --> [(), (1,3), (1,3) * (1,3)]
```

It would be nice to have a method on X that wraps the `dict(X._simplex_data)[(g1,g2,...)]` (and is able to recognize degenerate simplices and implicitly constructs the required n-skeleton).

I would also like to use the universal covering space for BD8 here, but since this is infinite there would currently be no way to construct the ED8 -> BD8 as a simplical map. I'll add this to the description of this ticket as a possible follow-up topic.

The standard way of printing a nondegenerate simplex is "Non-degenerate simplex of dimension d". I don't think that "s_0 (Non-degenerate simplex ...)" looks very good. I suppose we could check if the nondegenerate simplex has a custom name and use "s_0 (name)" if so, the verbose version if not.

One thing that strikes me as problematic is that you're not using the Parent/Element framework for the simplicial sets: currently, the sets themselves are declared to be Parent objects, but their simplices are implemented by a separate AbstractSimplex class. Shouldn't it be "better" (and more in line with the general Sage "philosophy") to realize the simplices as Element instances? or is there maybe a good reason why you did not take that course?

I actually feel a bit bad about bringing this up, because re-wiring the code to use the Element framework would not just be a lot of work, but also potentially open a can of worms with somewhat unclear benefits.

But anyway, regarding the latex representation of cells in a BG, for example, it would be nice to have a dedicated element class for simplices in a nerve; these elements would remember the chain of monoid elements used to construct them and forward calls to _repr_ and _latex_ to those monoid elements. Among other things, this avoids setting a custom_name for all (nondegenerate) simplices, which might be regarded a little wasteful. [Of course, it does set a custom "_chain" attribute then, which takes up the same space - but this is arguably more "valuable"]

Actually, I just tried this approach out (i.e. the Nerve with a custom Element subclass). It seems to work fine - except that for the life of me I cannot get the sorting of these elements in line with the existing code from AbstractSimplex... so plenty of doctests fail. This is probably just a small indication of the nasty suprises that might be lurking here.

Anyway, I'm just curious to hear what your view on this is!

I have to think about these questions a bit longer. You are probably referring to constructions like these from the doctests:

```
sage: v = AbstractSimplex(0, name='v')

sage: b = AbstractSimplex(0, name='b')

My feeling is that `AbstractSimplex` could maybe become a `SimplicialSet` itself, namely an alias for a generic `n-simplex`.

Oh, I see. For some of the examples of simplicial sets, like the `n`-sphere, I have lines like

```
    S._latex_ = lambda: 'S^``'.format(n)
    return S
```

So maybe the class `SimplicialSet_finite` (or `SimplicialSet_arbitrary`) should have a custom `latex_name` argument which gets used in its `_latex_` method, to avoid this sort of thing.

> My feeling is that `AbstractSimplex` could maybe become a `SimplicialSet` itself, namely an alias for a generic `n-simplex`. Whether this works out seems hard to say without actually trying to implement it.  I think there are potential benefits of sticking closer to the Sage parent/element framework, but whether this is worthwhile depends on the pain implied by the implementation. 

This idea was somehwat off, but the following seems to work:
  1) create a new parent singleton `SetOfAbstractSimplices` as a parent for all `AbstractSimplex` objects

  2) make `SimplicialSets` a subcategory of `FacadeSets`, so they can all share their elements with the `SetOfAbstractSimplices`

I have implemented this (very roughly) and think this might be a feasible approach. My changes are shown in this commit:
   https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=bcc53e3b9100163d7c1c2d0a42aceb9458f83c8a
One of the benefits is that simplicial sets can then have custom element classes: this is illustrated in the Nerve, where simplices only remember the chain of group elements, not their "custom name" or "custom latex name". And their names are only computed when somebody actually asks for them. 

(caveat: "latex(degeneration(nerve-simplex))" is still wrong with this code: there should probably be a _latex_nondegenerate_ method that the Nerve.Element class should override, but these are details left for later).

Pickling remains a problem because of the lack of unique representation; I suggest to disable the _test_pickling for the simplicial stuff (have done that for elements in that commit).

In case you could warm up to these suggestions there might be a few further rearrangements, that might prove useful; much of the AbstractSimplex code should probably moved into the ElementMethods of the SimplicialSets category, for example.

I don't think there's a chance to make pickling work to the satisfaction of the `TestSuite`: you can never have "`loads(dumps(simplex)) == simplex`" since both sides are different python objects and equality of `AbstractSimplex` objects is tied to their `id`. And since `SimplicialSet` objects are uniquely determined by their simplices this means that they too can't be recovered from their pickle.

Of course, the "loads(dumps(...))" call itself should eventually work. It seems `pickle` takes the hash before the object is fully constructed:

```
sage: from sage.structure.sage_object import StringIO
sage: pickle.load(StringIO(dumps(CP2,compress=false)))

I have no idea why this might be the case, though... a hidden recursive reference, maybe...? FWIW, pickling succeeds if the `__hash__` routine returns -1 in case of a missing `_data` member.

The problem seems to be that every `AbstractSimplex` in a `SimplicialSet` keeps a list of its parents in the `_faces` attribute. I just deactivated these lines and "loads(dumps(...))" works again:

```
        # Finally, store the faces of each nondegenerate simplex as an
        # attribute of the simplex itself.
        for x in simplices:
            x._faces[self] = data[x]
```
 
I think during unpickling python tries to re-populate the `x._faces` for each x in its `_data`, and here it needs the hash of `self` even though `self` is not fully reconstructed, yet.

FWIW, I think this `_faces` attribute in the `AbstractSimplex` should probably be removed. The category should specify a "`faces(element)`" parent method, while the actual parent implementations are free to implement this in whatever way they like.

I like your basic approach to construct a simplicial set from a collection of simplices + additional face information. However, instead of creating a `PreSimplex` class without faces we could also just *add* faces to the `AbstractSimplex`, which turns them into regular $n$-simplices (this should also be easier to explain). Consider the code

```
sage: a,b = [AbstractSimplex(0,name=x) for x in "ab"]
sage: e,f = [AbstractSimplex(1,name=x) for x in "ef"]
sage: X = SimplicialSet_finite({e:(a,b),f:(a,b)})
sage: Y = SimplicialSet_finite({e:(e.face(0),e.face(1)),f:(e.face(0),e.face(1))})
sage: Z = SimplicialSet_finite({e:(f.face(0),f.face(0)),f:(f.face(0),f.face(1))})
```


As far as the `Parent/Element` framework is concerned, none of $a,b,e,f$ would be actual elements of $X$, $Y$, or $Z$; rather they would be Elements of the `SetOfAbstractSimplices` singleton (which models the infinite coproduct of all `\Delta_n^{(x)}` where $x$ can be, say, any python object).

To create elements you would have to cast them to the parent (which might sometimes happen implicitly):

```
sage: X.n_cells(0) == [a,b]
False
sage: X.n_cells(0) == [X(a), X(b)]
True
sage: Y.n_cells(0)
[ Face d0 of e, Face d1 of e]
sage: Z.n_cells(0)
[ Face d0 of f, Face d1 of f ]
sage: Z(e.face(1)) == Z(e).face(1)
True
sage: Z(e).faces()
( Face d0 of f, Face d0 of f )
```


Here my assumption is that we're *not* following my earlier suggestion to use `FacadeSets`; rather every element/simplex belongs to a unique parent, following the advice of Travis in comment 56.

So an `AbstractSimplex` may or may not have faces, right? In your example, `e` and `f` do not have faces at the start, but after defining `X`, they do. So I guess at the start, `e.face(0)` would raise an error.

```
sage: a,b,c = [AbstractSimplex(0,name=x) for x in "abc"]
sage: e,f = [AbstractSimplex(1,name=x) for x in "ef"]
sage: K = SimplicialSet_finite({e:(a,b)})
sage: L = SimplicialSet_finite({e:(b,c)})
```

Raise an error because of the inconsistent face data for `e`?

Should you also be able to do

```
sage: M = SimplicialSet_finite({f:(a,b), e:True})
```

or some other non-iterable value for `e`, which would just mean: `e` has already been defined, so use its existing faces? Or pass a tuple instead of a dictionary as defining data, where each entry is either a full-fledged simplex or a pair `(instance of AbstractSimplex, list of its faces)`? Maybe implement the latter as follows: if `sigma` is an instance of `AbstractSimplex`, then `sigma[0]` would return `sigma` while `sigma[1]` would return its tuple of faces. Then you could easily deal with a tuple which has entries either of the form `(f: (a,b))` or `e`.

Is the point of the `SetOfAbstractSimplices` construction is just to have a parent around, so that `AbstractSimplex` can inherit from `Element`?

No, no error: the point is that `e` is neither a simplex of `K` nor of `L`, it can just be coerced into those sets. Then `K(e) != L(e)` since these simplices belong to different parents. And there's no problem with `K(e.face(0)) = K(e).face(0) != L(e).face(0)`.

Yes, I think that sounds like a good idea. This should be equivalent to `{f:(a,b), e:(e.face(0),e.face(1))}`, so `e` defines a disjoint 1-simplex (assuming that a,b are not faces of e).

This sounds like a nice way to make the defining data a bit simpler to specify (although it's probably just syntactic sugar).

> Is the point of the `SetOfAbstractSimplices` construction is just to have a parent around, so that `AbstractSimplex` can inherit from `Element`?
Essentially yes. And it might make the AbstractSimplex business easier to grasp from a mathematical point of view: the face data defining a `SimplicialSet_finite` $X$ amount to the specification of an assembly map

```
\coprod_{i\in I} \Delta_{n_i}  \rightarrow   X
```

An `AbstractSimplex` should be the tautological simplex $\iota_n\in\Delta_n$ for one of these summands.

- We could just create a class `FaceOfAbstractSimplex` for any (iterated) face of one of the `\Delta_n`'s. It wouldn't have to do much, since most manipulations will occur within a simplicial set other than `SetOfAbstractSimplices`.

- Or we could think that when we define the `n`-dimensional `AbstractSimplex` indexed by `x`, we in fact define a family of `i`-simplices, `i <= n`, namely the actual simplex `\Delta_{n,x}` and all of its faces, all indexed by `x`. Thus `e.face(0)` would be an `AbstractSimplex` with the same indexing element as `e`, but of one dimensional lower.

Internally, we still have classes for the abstract simplicies, but the equality/construction is checking the set of vertices, degenerices, and (latex) name.

Perhaps I'm oversimplifying things because I didn't see a complicated example.

In a simplicial set, simplices are not determined by their vertices, and not everything is determined by the top-dimensional faces. You can have an edge starting and ending at the same vertex, and then you can have a 2-simplex which has that edge for one of its faces. You can also have degenerate simplices, for example a vertex determines a degenerate 1-simplex. And then you can have a 2-simplex which has the same degenerate 1-simplex for all of its faces: this gives a 2-sphere, where you are collapsing the boundary of the 2-simplex to a single vertex.

Note also that you have to distinguish between a 2-simplex one of whose faces is a degenerate 1-simplex (imagine a triangle where you collapse one edge to a point) and a 2-simplex one of whose faces is a non-degenerate edge starting and ending at the same vertex (a triangle where you have glued two corners together).

For every non-degenerate simplex in a simplicial set, you have to specify each of its faces, and each of those faces might be non-degenerate or might be obtained by applying a sequence of degeneracies to a lower-dimensional non-degenerate simplex. So I think you need a good way to define simplices of various dimensions so that you can have a specification like

```
{sigma: (face_0, face_1, ..., face_n)}
```

as part of the dictionary defining a simplicial set.

Pong (and sorry for the prolonged delay)!

Part of me still thinks that it would be nice to use the Parent/Element framework, but since I don't see any non-intrusive way to incorporate this myself I think it is the wise choice to just go ahead with the code as it is. This is a significant amount of valuable code, after all, and it would be a pity if its inclusion into Sage would be delayed much further.

I went over the code once more and noted a couple of very minor possible improvements; these are outlined in the file "suggestions.diff" that I have just attached. Please let me know what you think about those and let's hope to then close this ticket before christmas.

Cheers,
Christian

I don't know if this is a bug. The intended way to construct products is with the `product` method for simplicial sets. If you want to use a class constructor, you should use `ProductOfSimplicialSets_finite` if all of the arguments are finite. When I do that, I don't see any problems.
