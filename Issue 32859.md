Did you mean png and PNG instead of twice png?

One per line, sorted alphabetically,
might be easier to inspect visually.

Here with lowercase and uppercase
jpeg jpg pdf png, just in case:

```
commands = find {posargs:{toxinidir}/sage/} \
    -name "*#*" -prune -o \
    -name "*.a" -prune -o \
    -name "*.bak" -prune -o \
    -name "*.dia" -prune -o \
    -name "*.gz" -prune -o \
    -name "*.ico" -prune -o \
    -name "*.inv" -prune -o \
    -name "*.JPEG" -prune -o \
    -name "*.jpeg" -prune -o \

This is coming directly from the list in `testenv:codespell` a few lines below in the file. The duplicate `.png` can just be removed -- my mistake.
Feel free to push the proposed change to the ticket, it's a nice cleanup
