This ticket stands for allowing numpy arrays (over `float`/`complex`) in fast callable (over `float`/`RDF/`complex`/`CDF`). Namely, the following should work

```
sage: import numpy as np
sage: f(x) = cos(x) * sin(x)
sage: g = fast_callable(f, vars=[x], domain=float)
sage: g(np.array([1,2,3]))
array([ 0.45464871, -0.37840125, -0.13970775])
sage: g(np.array([[1,2], [3,4]]))
[[0.4546487134128409, -0.37840124765396416],
 [-0.13970774909946293, 0.4946791233116909]]
