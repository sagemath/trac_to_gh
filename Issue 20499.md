Not related to installation problem, but in the `dependencies` file you should put

```
$(PYTHON) | setuptools
```


That is, if `setuptools` is reinstalled it's not necessary to reinstall a Python package that happens to use it.  But it is a prerequisite to installing.

"build dep" is probably the wrong description--but I just meant a developer tool for development of Sage, outside the sage distribution.

To be clear, this is a case where the term "package" is often overloaded in Python:

* Here the package, as in the name of what you import in Python is `patchbot`

* The name in the `setup.py` is different from the package name, and as sometimes referred to as the "distribution name" or the "PyPI name" to reduce confusion.  Often the package name and the distribution name are the same, but they don't have to be.  Either way it shouldn't be relevant here.

I think the main takeaway here is that the patchbot should not be a Sage spkg at all.  It's not a part of sage, the distribution.  It's a tool for testing sage the distribution and as such should be entirely external to it.

So to install the patchbot on say a Linux system one would use `sudo pip install <path/to/tarball>` or even just `sudo pip install sage-patchbot` if the latest version is uploaded to PyPI.

Alternatively this can be done within a virtualenv if we prefer to avoid the system install.

I am doing what I can, but this is a bit too complicated for me to handle easily.

I changed all the imports in such a way that patchbot must now be used a a python package. The simpplest way (and it works) is what I suggest above.

Why do you so strongly object to pip installation in the system python ?

Now if you have better suggestions, I would appreciate help.

Relative imports are not allowed when a python file is run as a script, it seems.

How is it compatible with not installing in the sage python ?

Is there any way to install somewhere inside sage a python package using the system python ? Is there any existing case ? Where should it go ? How should I do that ?

yes, I agree.

And there is an `__init__.py` in the package.

Well, if you want me to have a look, I need more details. But if it works as intended outside of Sage with a *user* install, that's good enough.

As I've written before on this thread the patchbot should not be a Sage spkg.

I did have to manually change `PYTHONPATH` for it to work in a user install.

I think you should be able to do

```
./sage --pip install --user patchbot
```


However, since Sage sets `PYTHONUSERBASE` (no idea why), this patchbot is installed in a directory different from what the system Python expects. To get it working, I had to set `PYTHONPATH` to the `site-packages` directory in `~/.sage/local`. Because of confusion between `lib` and `lib64`, just setting `PYTHONUSERBASE` system-wide was not sufficient.

For this reason, I believe that `./sage --patchbot` should set `PYTHONPATH` before running the patchbot.

Why not put it on PyPI, and put out some proper releases?

Alternatively, pip allows download direct from a git repository, including specific tags.

> pip install --user tarball.tar.gz

Whatever; people can `pip install` however they're comfortable with.

> I am not completely sure if this already works with this branch, but it was my vision of things. I think that I did (1) or (2) on my own patchbot client, which seems to be running well.

I don't know.  Is there anything in the patchbot that tries to import `sage`?  I don't *think* there is--as far as I can tell the patchbot can run entirely outside of the sage environment, as it should.

> Now Jeroen and Eric do not seem to agree on what to do. Please consider that I have not a lot of time to spend on that.

AFAICT the only disagreement is over whether or not running `sudo pip install` is ever appropriate.  My point is that it doesn't really matter--as long as the user is installing into a Python outside of the Sage distribution (be it a virtualenv, a `--user` install, or whatever) it should work fine.  It doesn't really matter and the most appropriate choice depends on the context.

For that matter, there's probably nothing wrong with installing the patchbot package into Sage's Python too, again just using `pip install`.  But in general it should not be necessary to.

Thanks for the feedback.

These are not the instructions on how to run the patchbot given in the ticket description.

But this will be another possible way.

Librae is meeting a whole bunch of doctest failure with lrslib. Maybe it should be checked that the bot is not causing them.

Concerning pypi, it may be simpler once done, but I am not really ready to add yet another layer of complexity.

Concerning the log, I would prefer to postpone the problem, once the new setting is in place.

I don't think it's deeply necessary--`pip` can install fine from a git repository for example (including specific tags).  But it's not a big deal either way.

And like I also wrote earlier it shouldn't matter where `pathbot` is installed either as long as it's installed correctly and running `patchbot` from the command-line works.

You've already fixed up the patchbot to use distutils properly, so this is a matter of making an account on PyPI, setting up your credentials, and running `./setup.py register upload`.  There's no additional layer of complexity.

Indeed. If the patchbot is a Python package it is much more natural to use it without the Sage environment variables set.

> Librae is meeting a whole bunch of doctest failure with lrslib. Maybe it should be checked that the bot is not causing them.

Not the bot: #21012

> Concerning pypi, it may be simpler once done, but I am not really ready to add yet another layer of complexity.

It is not a new layer. It is simply a way to distribute the module. Instead of having a tarball on your webpage there is a tarball on PyPI. It is just simpler because for installation you would just have to do `pip install sage-patchbot --user` (downloading would be automatic). And for upgrade `pip install sage-patchbot --upgrade`.

Of course this was not intended to be for this ticket. Still it is a question.

Mainly just for convenience. It's easier to type `./sage --patchbot` than `python -m sage_patchbot.patchbot --sage-root=SAGE_ROOT`.

Second reason: on most systems, `python` is installed system-wide. But `pip` often is not.

Instead of a sloppy script, I would be very much happier with `sage -patchbot` returning an informative error message.

As I understand it the purpose of `./sage -foo` is to run the `foo` program that's installed in the sage environment.  I don't see why it should be doing anything else.  At most if `./sage -patchbot` is meant to do *something* it can raise an error if `patchbot` does not happen to be installed in the Sage environment.  Then if one wants they can `./sage -pip install sage-patchbot` and get it in their Sage environment, at which point `./sage -patchbot` is the equivalent of `. sage-env; patchbot`, etc...

Otherwise all one needs to do to run the patchbot is to run `patchbot` however it happens to be installed on a (correctly configured) system.

It effectively is.  `pip` is the official installer for Python packages and comes with modern distributions of Python (including most system distributions).  While you can have a "working" Python installation *without* pip, a Python installation with a non-working pip installation is not a working Python installation.

`pip install --user git+https://github.com/sagemath/sage-patchbot.git`
installs the latest patchbot, why does the statement in the wiki specify the version, which would be outdated sooner or later?

I don't see it as invoking Sage. I consider `sage --patchbot` just a simple convenience command. I changed it such that it should work in all cases: the `sage_patchbot` can be installed system-wide, by the user, or inside Sage. Why should we not support that?

Then pip becomes an additional requirement for running the Sage patchbot. Many systems come with Python installed system-wide, but without pip.

+1 on using the system Python.

-1 on including the patchbot as part of the sage distribution in any way.

-1 on supporting `sage --patchbot`.

Just FYI: that doesn't apply to unsafe tickets (EDITED). Those get built in a sandbox under /tmp. But they don't work anyway atm.

>`--sage-root=`
1. the parameter should be called `--sage-testing-root=` (or similar) rather than `sage-root`: several sage installations may exists on a system. Especially sage-root might be menthally associated with the production-sage root directory.

2. The option `sage-testing-root` should be added as a config file parameter.

If supporting `'sage -patchbot'` works as expected (starts the user-local or system installation of the patchbot and also uses the system python) and does not cause any serious harm (including maintenance issues) I would not insist on the complete removal of 'sage -patchbot'.
A compromise between the two different opinions here could be to print a message that running `'sage -patchbot'` is no longer the preferred way to run the patchbot and point to the buildbot wiki.

If I want to test a sage installation I just type './sage -t --all ' 

Of course you mean that 'sage-root' is here the folder where patchbot will test various tickets (and thus various sage versions)

> IMHO, it's obvious that the `--sage-root` when running the patchbot is the Sage installation that you want to test.  

Since you formally failed to correcly explain what `--sage-root` means, I do not buy that 'it is obvious', at least not for a new patchbot user.  So I find the 'sage-root' patchbot option should be at lieast documented (what it does) on the wiki and in the software and the inconsistency between 'sage_root' and 'sage-root' should be removed (underscore vs dash) 

By the way; it is well known that naming is one important part of software development and it may create mental blockades or misunderstandings.

In summary: 
I expect as minimal action to gain positive review that 'sage_root' gets documented in the software and in the wiki
(https://wiki.sagemath.org/buildbot/details) and the inconsistency between 'sage_root' and 'sage-root' is removed (underscore in config file vs dash in command line option)

Doesn't "deprecate the related `sage -patchbot` command" relate more to the second point instead of the first?

1. remove patchbot optional spkg

OK, I did not deprecate the command, but since the current `sage -patchbot` command does not work anyway, i replaced it with a short sentence pointing to https://wiki.sagemath.org/buildbot#Installing_the_patchbot (which are the most up-to-date instructions). It is just a suggestion until the current ticket get fixed, i can undo the last commit about the `sage -patchbot` command if required.
