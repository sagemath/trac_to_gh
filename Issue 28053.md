In the first one, it suffices to change the message of the doctest. In the second one, the multiple edges are ignored by the Graph constructor, and we have

```
sage: G = Graph(multiedges=False)
sage: G.add_edge(1,2)

sage:

Also, the default values for `loops` and `multiedges` should be changed to `False` instead of `None`.
