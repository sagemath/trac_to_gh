Assignee: @burcin

Keywords: symbolic, limit

Sage incorrectly computes:


```
var('n')
l  = (3^n + (-2)^n) / (3^(n+1) + (-2)^(n+1))
l.limit(n=oo)
```

gives 0.

However, 



```
var('n')
l  = (3^n + (-2.0)^n) / (3^(n+1) + (-2)^(n+1))
l.limit(n=oo)
```


gives the correct result 1/3, and


```
var('n')
assume(n,'integer')
l  = (3^n + (-2)^n) / (3^(n+1) + (-2)^(n+1))
l.limit(n=oo)
```


also does.

maxima also gives the value 0 to the corresponding limits, but changing (-2)\^n by (-2.0)\^n only produce meaningless results.

I'd rather say: did you try this with maxima 5.28.0 ? (Sage still uses 5.26.0)
