Ralf, I'm curious as to how you recognized the bug. Is there a previous Trac ticket?

After Volker gave me a function argument that showed the problem I traced what Pynac was doing. It called the fixed function and then it was obvious. How I know that this is 8 year old? You can use git blame to see when a specific line was changed.
