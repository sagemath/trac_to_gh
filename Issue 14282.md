Oh, I see... Well, unless you see a more generic way to avoid the problem, could you also add floats to the list ?


```
sage: Set(float(0))      
Set of elements of 0.0
sage: list(Set(float(0)))
...
AttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute '__iter__'
```


I don't see anything else that we should avoid, but one never knows... ^^;

Oh !


```
sage: Set(True) 
...
ValueError: underlying object cannot be an integer
```


What about doing it on a "whitelist" base ? Something like "if is an iterable we accept to build a Set from it", and otherwise we refuse ?

Looks lke it is what `frozenset` does

```
sage: frozenset(1)
...
TypeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object is not iterable
```


I'm sorry for only coming with problems and not solutions `^^;`

Those are all problems with the `Set` factory function and not with the `Set_object.__init__` constructor. Feel free to open a separate ticket for them.

The Set function should check that its argument is iterable using `isinstance(X, collections.Iterable)`. This will probably uncover bugs in sage where iterables are not deriving from collections.Iterable that then need to be fixed up. 

In a different ticket.
