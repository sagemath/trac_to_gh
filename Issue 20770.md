```
sage: 1/r^(1/3)
...
/home/ralf/sage/src/sage/symbolic/ring.pyx in sage.symbolic.ring.SymbolicRing._element_constructor_ (build/cythonized/sage/symbolic/ring.cpp:6620)()
    340             return prod([SR(p)**e for p,e in x], SR(x.unit()))
    341         else:
--> 342             raise TypeError
    343
    344         return new_Expression_from_GEx(self, exp)

TypeError:
```

Fresh Sage has `r` defined as the R interpreter. Granted I only stumbled over this only after years but still, this exception should print `r` like when you do `r+1` and get `TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+': '<class 'sage.interfaces.r.R'>' and 'Integer Ring'`.
