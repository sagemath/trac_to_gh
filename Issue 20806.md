Various functions dealing with support take a `cmp` parameter. This should be changed to a `key` parameter.

I do not plan to fix this now, I'm just creating the ticket in case anybody feels like working on this.

This is likely to be a non-trivial change as we will probably also have to do work with the module morphisms as well. However, this will be good to get done at some point soon.

Shall we deprecate as usual ? It would be simpler to just replace by key, of course..

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Not yet finished.

This triggers deprecations in

Then why needs_review?

This was just as a step to "needs_work". Sorry for not being as fast as light.

I see you try to avoid some boilerplate by separating the `cmp_deprecation` function.

However, you could simplify a lot more (not tested):

```python
def max_kwds(iterable, **kwds)
    if 'cmp' in kwds:
        deprecation(21043, "the 'cmp' keyword is deprecated, use 'key' instead")
        return max_cmp(iterable, kwds['cmp'])
    return max(iterable, **kwds)

def min_kwds(iterable, **kwds)
    # analogous

def leading_support(self, **kwds):
    return max_kwds(self.support(), **kwds)
```

which is simpler code with less boilerplate. If we ever remove the `cmp` flag, we just need to replace `max_kwds` by `max` and `min_kwds` by `min`.

oh, well. Really needed ?

Both `min_cmp` and `max_cmp` are used only here, and you want to wrap them again ?
It would be better to change them directly. But I do not really see the point.

Fine for me!

> But I do not really see the point.

Two points:

1. Less code duplication.

2. Simpler code (by avoiding duplication and using `**kwds` to remove the `if key is not None` branch).

All tests pass. I will not be able to work on this for at least one or two weeks.

ok, thanks for doing the job. Your changes looks good to me and all tests pass.

You can set a positive review if you want.
