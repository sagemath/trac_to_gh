# Issue 13511: documentation for "attach" should mention load_attach_path()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13715

Original creator: ddrake

Original creation time: 2012-11-15 18:49:03

Assignee: mvngu

Keywords: load attach path

The documentation for `attach` doesn't say anything about `load_attach_path`, so if you try to attach a file and Sage complains, it's hard to figure out how to fix it. The docstring for `attach` should mention `load_attach_path()`.

Related: #378.

The patch adds `session.pyx` to the documentation so that the docstring for attach appears in the HTML version. I rearranged the docstring  for attach, added links, improved formatting, and removed some trailing whitespace. I also added links and removed trailing whitespace in `preparser.py`.

There are some Sphinx errors:

```
docstring of sage.misc.session:12: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
docstring of sage.misc.session:14: WARNING: Definition list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
docstring of sage.misc.session:11: ERROR: Unexpected indentation.
```

These errors were caused from `session.pyx` being imported into the manual (and not by the patch itself). I've attached a reviewer patch which cleans up the rest of the documentation in the file.

The patches here bitrotted, so I rebased them for 5.9.beta0 and uploaded attachment:trac13715.2.patch and attachment:trac_13715-review-ts.2.patch (I can't overwrite the original patches).
