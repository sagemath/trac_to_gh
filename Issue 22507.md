# Issue 22507: tiling a polyomino with polyominoes

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: slabbe

Original creation time: 2017-04-03 04:33:21

Here is a small example:


```
sage: b = Polyomino([(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (1,2), (2,2), (0,3), (1,3)])      
sage: p = Polyomino([(0,0), (1,0)])                                                
sage: T = TilingSolver([p], box=b, reusable=True)                                                                                             
sage: next(T.solve()) 
[Polyomino: [(0, 0), (1, 0)], Color: gray,               
 Polyomino: [(0, 3), (1, 3)], Color: gray,               
 Polyomino: [(1, 1), (2, 1)], Color: gray,             
 Polyomino: [(1, 2), (2, 2)], Color: gray]              
```


Before, the code allowed only to tile a d-dimensional rectangular box.

What is the point of a cached_method that always raises an error!?

You are right! I will fix this.

The coverage was not perfect and some doctests are failing. I will work on that right now.

Quick comments:

- I don't understand the change in class names. Plus, I would expect `RectanglePolyomino` to be a subclass of `Polyomino`. Could you explain why you need this class hierarchy?
- Since these are subclasses of `SageObject`, you should use `_repr_`.
- When you show the one solution, those should still be marked as `# long time`, which will have valid output when run as a test.

As of now, I wrote:


```
class Polyomino_generic(SageObject):
class Polyomino(Polyomino_generic):
class RectanglePolyomino(Polyomino_generic):
```


> Could you explain why you need this class hierarchy?

Good question. I thought there was one when I started to split the classes. I just double checked, and there is no reason. We need to enumerate all the elements of a rectangle polyomino anyway, so there is no reason to store it in a more efficient way. Thank you very much for this comment!

> - Since these are subclasses of `SageObject`, you should use `_repr_`.

OK.

> - When you show the one solution, those should still be marked as `# long time`, which will have valid output when run as a test.

There was some other place where show was tested. I will change them to long time.

One last little thing: Change `8x8` to ``8 \times 8`` (the `\times` is replaced by `x` automatically by the interactive doc). Once that is done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
