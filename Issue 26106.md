The test suite for sagetex should unset `TEXINPUTS` when testing. As it is, it runs `latex` on the wrong file `example.tex`: it tests one from that happens to lie in a path in `TEXINPUTS`, and then it uses the version of `sagetex.sty` from elsewhere, also. (My `TEXINPUTS` has `.` at the end of the list of paths, not the beginning, so it looks there last.)

I don't know why `latex file.tex` looks for `file.tex` in places other than the current working directory, but it seems to. I knew it looked for style files elsewhere, but not the actual LaTeX files. I found that out by examining the `sagetex-3.0` log file after running `./sage -f -c sagetex`.
