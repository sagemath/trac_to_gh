consider the following (both with Sage 4.8 and Sage 5.0.beta13 without `proof=False`):

```
sage: R.<x,y>=GF(2)[]
sage: factor(x^6 + y^6 + x^5 + x^3 + x + 1,proof=False)
x^6 + y^6 + x^5 + x^3 + x + 1
sage: (x^4+y^2*x^2+x^2+y^2*x+y^4+y^2+1)*(x^2+x+y^2+1)     
x^6 + y^6 + x^5 + x^3 + x + 1
```

This seems to be a bug in Singular factorization. I set the priority to "critical" since this is really a very basic routine.

here is another example:

```
sage: R.<x,t> = GF(2)[]
sage: f=x^6 + (t^5 + t^2)*x + t^5 + t^4 + t^3 + 1
sage: factor(f,proof=False)                      
x^6 + x*t^5 + t^5 + t^4 + x*t^2 + t^3 + 1
sage: f % (x+t+1)
0
```

Note that the factorization algorithm seems not to be deterministic, thus some times the
factorization is correct.

Note that for the example given in the description, the "bug" seems to be deterministic.

Hi, can you guys report this upstream? I am travelling this week.
