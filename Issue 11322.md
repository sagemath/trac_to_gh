According to [the wiki](CygwinPort), 

```
libblas.dll.a is not copied to $SAGE_LOCAL/lib when ATLAS is "installed" (breaks linbox)
```

From Mike Hansen:

```
To fix the problem, just do

cp /usr/lib/libblas.dll.a $SAGE_LOCAL/lib

and then run "make" again.
```

So this would require a new ATLAS spkg-install and spkg, I guess.

Would using the atlas spkg from #10226 work?

I don't know.  I'm just trying to make Sage build on Cygwin :)

Mike?

Francois, I don't think so

```
if conf['CYGWIN?']:
    if os.path.exists('/usr/lib/libblas.a'):
        sys.exit(0)
    print "*"*75
    print "On Cygwin you must install the standard LAPACK Cygwin package"
    print "via the Cygwin setup.exe program in the 'Math' category."
    print "*"*75 
    sys.exit(1)
```

No mention of moving any libraries anywhere.  But I may be missing something in that long spkg-install.

By the way, why does that spkg-install check for libblas.a?  I can only find libblas.dll.a and libblas.la.

I only copied what there already was for Cygwin, I never tested it on that platform.

I updated the atlas-3.8.4.spkg from #10226 to say

```
if conf['CYGWIN?']:
    lib = '/usr/lib/libblas.dll.a'
    if not os.path.exists(lib):
        print '*'*75
        print 'On Cygwin you must install the standard LAPACK Cygwin package'
        print 'via the Cygwin setup.exe program in the "Math" category.'
        print '*'*75 
        sys.exit(1)
    cp(lib, os.path.join(conf['SAGE_LOCAL'], 'lib'))
    sys.exit(0)
```


Please test and let us know whether it works.

Does the new atlas spkg works? We are kind of waiting on this one before putting a positive review to #10226.

Sorry, I thought I had reviewed this.  It does work on XP.  I can't get Win7 to even build Python, so who knows there.  However, the fix is just to use the Cygwin versions of these things, so I don't see why it wouldn't.  

At any rate, this fixed the problem here, and I think that is enough.  It certainly wouldn't make the problem worse!   Cygwin is enough of a moving target that even getting it to build on XP is going to be a big accomplishment, so get this in.
