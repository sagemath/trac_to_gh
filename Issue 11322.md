So this would require a new ATLAS spkg-install and spkg, I guess.

Francois, I don't think so

```
if conf['CYGWIN?']:
    if os.path.exists('/usr/lib/libblas.a'):
        sys.exit(0)
    print "*"*75
    print "On Cygwin you must install the standard LAPACK Cygwin package"
    print "via the Cygwin setup.exe program in the 'Math' category."
    print "*"*75 
    sys.exit(1)
```

No mention of moving any libraries anywhere.  But I may be missing something in that long spkg-install.

I only copied what there already was for Cygwin, I never tested it on that platform.

I updated the atlas-3.8.4.spkg from #10226 to say

```
if conf['CYGWIN?']:
    lib = '/usr/lib/libblas.dll.a'
    if not os.path.exists(lib):
        print '*'*75
        print 'On Cygwin you must install the standard LAPACK Cygwin package'
        print 'via the Cygwin setup.exe program in the "Math" category.'
        print '*'*75 
        sys.exit(1)
    cp(lib, os.path.join(conf['SAGE_LOCAL'], 'lib'))
    sys.exit(0)
```


Please test and let us know whether it works.

Does the new atlas spkg works? We are kind of waiting on this one before putting a positive review to #10226.
