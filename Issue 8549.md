# Issue 8549: Add a cycle enumerator for Permutation Group

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: nborie

Keywords: permutation, cycle, enumeration

Let G a permutation group. Each permutation of G has a cycle type. The goal of this ticket is to add a method for permutation group which return a dictionary associating for each cycle pattern, the number of permutation in G having this pattern.

This should allow to do some plethysm very easily.

Suggestion welcome to improve the latex math line and make it more nice and understandable.

Changing keywords from "permutation, cycle, enumeration" to "permutation groups, cycle index, Polya enumeration".

If I apply "trac_8549_cycle_enumerator-nb.patch" on top of 4.4.alpha1, all tests pass.  If I instead apply the patch from #8500, all tests pass.  If I apply _both_ patches, though, then I get a doctest failure:

I'm sorry, I forgot to say that I've only seen this on a Mac (OS X 10.6.3).  On sage.math, all tests pass.

Replying to [comment:7 jhpalmieri]:
> I'm sorry, I forgot to say that I've only seen this on a Mac (OS X 10.6.3).  On sage.math, all tests pass.

#8500 and #8549 together pass all long tests on 64-bit Ubuntu 9.04.  I also saw Mike Hansen at Sage Days 21 test just the file `sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_finite_field.py` with both patches and it passed all tests as well.  I'll be working on a review at some point today.

Nicolas(s),

This is a nice addition, and I can already think of a use for it in a classroom example.

Some small comments/suggestions:

1.  One small bit of language, in


```
Here are the cycle index of some permutation groups
```


I would write the plural as "cycle indices."  Nicely written otherwise.


2.  Would there be some way to qualify a value for the parent keyword as being legitimate?  For example, with `D=DihedralGroup(7)`, `14*D.cycle_index(parent=QQ)` goes boom.  It doesn't seem that there is a simple type to test on (but maybe I'm wrong on this), but it does look like parent need only implement  term() and sum().  Would it work to put something like  `parent.term(Partition([1]), 1)` in a try/except block?


3.  Documentation.

(a)  Do you want to add this into the reference manual?

(b)  Last doctest block needs a preceding "::" to make it render as verbatim.

(c)  Two instances of "cycle_type" near the top print weird due to the underscore.


Important stuff:  builds and passes long tests, works as advertised.  So I'm ready to give this a positive review subject to the above minor items.

Rob

See #8500 for the results of further OSX testing on this combination.

Hi,

I just wrote a quick patch in the queue implementing the requested changes, and adding FinitePermutationGroups to the ref manual where it was missing. Nicolas, please double check, fold, and reupload.

Attachment

Thanks very much for these fix.

All tests pass for sage, all tests long and optionnal pass for the finite_permutation_groups, the doc is well built... New comments for parent argument make also more clear the doc.

Positive Review from me. Thanks you Rob for pointing improvements and fix.

I change two times the status of this patch but I precise the last change come from Nicolas ThiÃ©ry.

This positive review is also modulo the comment 

> If I apply "trac_8549_cycle_enumerator-nb.patch" on top of 4.4.alpha1, all tests pass. If I instead apply the patch from #8500, all tests pass. If I apply both patches, though, then I get a doctest failure

I currently have no possible access to any OS X machine. All my tests was computing from Ubuntu machines.
