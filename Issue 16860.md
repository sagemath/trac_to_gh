# Issue 16860: Don't use "is" with strings

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17097

Original creator: jdemeyer

There are surprisingly many places in Sage where strings are compared with `is` instead of `==`. This actually works in simple cases:

```
sage: "foo" is "foo"
True
sage: "foo" is "foox"[:3]
False
sage: "foo" == "foox"[:3]
True
```
