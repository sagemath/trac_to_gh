# Issue 19198: Poset documentation polishing: New posets from old ones

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19435

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2015-10-19 12:42:43

Check documentation for `product()`, `dual()` and so on.

This continues the serie of #18925, #18941, #18959, #19141 and #19360.

This is a long but quite trivial patch. Mostly bikeshedding.

I don't know easy way to make `with_bounds()` work with non-facade posets. At least now the code gives nicer error message. I also changed `completion_by_cuts()` to return the empty lattice from the empty poset. It is now consistent with definition "smallest lattice containing..."

* Potential issue with the example in `connected_components()` giving the covering relations of the first connected component, since `cover_relations()` returns an ordered list, but strictly speaking is an unordered set. Not really an issue, since I imagine the code will always return it in the order given, but it's something to think about.

* When talking about dual/ordinal sum of a lattice (resp join-/meet- semilattices), the documentation appears to use 'lattice' etc. as adjectives (ie, 'the dual of a lattice is lattice').  All of those should be like 'the dual of a lattice is a lattice'.

* I'm not happy about the definition of Dedekind-Macneille completion being vague about the concept of 'smallest' and not being explicit about the original poset being an induced subposet of the lattice, but I suppose it matches what Wikipedia has, and does link to the full Wikipedia article.

This is true, and I do not know a good way to overcome this. `# random order` is one possibility. For a user perspective I see no problem when documentation says that a function returns `[3, 5]`, but he/she gots `[5, 3]`; if the user has any clue at all, he will understand that the list represents a set.

For some posets we could use `linear_extension=True`, but it only applies to list of elements, and is kind of noise to the user.

Could we have an option to show this clearly? I.e. somehow show what are "original" and "added" elements on the completion?
