This is a long but quite trivial patch. Mostly bikeshedding.

I don't know easy way to make `with_bounds()` work with non-facade posets. At least now the code gives nicer error message. I also changed `completion_by_cuts()` to return the empty lattice from the empty poset. It is now consistent with definition "smallest lattice containing..."

Could we have an option to show this clearly? I.e. somehow show what are "original" and "added" elements on the completion?
