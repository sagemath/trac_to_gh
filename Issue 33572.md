LGTM.

I didn't know the `Path` class and so the notation `file = path / 'cluster_algebra_quiver' / f'mutation_classes_{n}.dig6'`.

I think this ticket caused the reported failures `AttributeError: 'PosixPath' object has no attribute '_libgap_init_'` when `gap_packages` is installed. https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/JZ5WOz2BNvA/m/GgIt-_3vAwAJ
