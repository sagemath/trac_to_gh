Fails to build with `SPKG_CHECK=yes` with the vexing

```
Successfully installed symmetrica-2.0.p9
Running the test suite for symmetrica-2.0.p9...

>  960000.000000.000000.000000.000000
Error: The Symmetrica check failed.
```

Closer inspection shows the difference is due to trailing whitespace.

This change fixes the problem for me. Does symmetrica need a version bump because of this?

No, its just the `spkg-check` file that changed.
