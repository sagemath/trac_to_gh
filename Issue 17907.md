Looks good to me. I would have called this an "overgroup" rather than a "surgroup", but it seems that both notations are common enough. It's possibly not ideal that so much general group-theoretic functionality is getting added to permutation arithmetic subgroups that isn't available from the top-level `ArithmeticSubgroup` classes, and thus might not be noticed by the average user, but that is an issue for another ticket.
