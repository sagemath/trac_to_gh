As range is not a class in python2 the new `isinstance` is supposed to fail and the cythonize seems to be a little inconsistent if you use isinstance with a tuple as a second argument:
`elif isinstance(v, (list, tuple, range)):`
generate 

```
__pyx_t_1 = PyObject_IsInstance(__pyx_v_v, __pyx_builtin_range); 
__pyx_t_4 = (__pyx_t_1 != 0);
```

and 
`elif isinstance(v, (list, tuple)) or isinstance(v, range):` generate

```
pyx_t_4 = PyObject_IsInstance(__pyx_v_v, __pyx_builtin_range); 
if (unlikely(__pyx_t_4 == ((int)-1))) __PYX_ERR(0, 96, __pyx_L1_error)
```

The latest is the consistent behaviour for me.

For the errors generated by this ticket with python2 the object return -1 on `PyObject_IsInstance(__pyx_v_v, __pyx_builtin_range)` and then `isinstance(v, (list, tuple, range)` return `True`.

True
sage: type(xrange(2))
