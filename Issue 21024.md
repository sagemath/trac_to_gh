`entrypoints` is officially a dependency of the Jupyter `nbconvert` module, so Sage should also have it.

This distribution is missing a `setup.py` ([upstream denies this is a bug](https://github.com/takluyver/entrypoints/issues/8)), so we provide one within Sage.

`configparser` is a dependency of `entrypoints`.

**Tarballs**:
- http://sage.ugent.be/www/jdemeyer/sage/entrypoints-0.2.2.tar.gz (renamed from tarball provided by github)
- https://pypi.python.org/packages/7c/69/c2ce7e91c89dc073eb1aa74c0621c3eefbffe8216b3f9af9d3885265c01c/configparser-3.5.0.tar.gz

This is a very strange package, it doesn't even have `setup.py`...

Yeah I'm not crazy about flit in part because it doesn't provide any backwards-compatibility.

I think a better thing to do would be to just pip install the wheel directly, though that would mean adding support for wheels as upstream packages (not a bad idea IMO).

If I'd seen this sooner I coulda saved you the time of submitting the issue.  This is what I've been saying all along--`setup.py` is going away, eventually.  This is an example of being a bit overly aggressive about it I think but it's not wrong either.
