`entrypoints` is officially a dependency of the Jupyter `nbconvert` module, so Sage should also have it.

This is a very strange package, it doesn't even have `setup.py`...

Yeah I'm not crazy about flit in part because it doesn't provide any backwards-compatibility.

I think a better thing to do would be to just pip install the wheel directly, though that would mean adding support for wheels as upstream packages (not a bad idea IMO).

If I'd seen this sooner I coulda saved you the time of submitting the issue.  This is what I've been saying all along--`setup.py` is going away, eventually.  This is an example of being a bit overly aggressive about it I think but it's not wrong either.
