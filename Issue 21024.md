Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21261

If I'd seen this sooner I coulda saved you the time of submitting the issue.  This is what I've been saying all along--`setup.py` is going away, eventually.  This is an example of being a bit overly aggressive about it I think but it's not wrong either.
