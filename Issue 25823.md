# Issue 25823: Wrong limit calculation

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: pelegm

Original creation time: 2018-08-14 06:02:05

CC:  slelievre

Keywords: limit,maxima


```python
sage: (x / (x+2^x+cos(x))).limit(x=-infinity)
und
```

Should clearly be 1.

SymPy returns the correct result:

```python
sage: (x / (x+2^x+cos(x))).limit(x=-infinity, algorithm='sympy')
1
```


So is it a bug in Maxima?

Apparently yes.

I've reported this at [Maxima bug 3459](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3459/).

(That was pretty fast work!)

Changing keywords from "limit,maxima" to "limit, maxima".

After the upgrade to Maxima 5.42.2 in #26625, we should add a doctest here.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

Looks fine to me (assuming patchbot says it's fine), though all the other changes in typesetting could have occurred on another ticket.  Thanks for doctesting!

Sorry!  Haven't been keeping "Trac" as much lately.
