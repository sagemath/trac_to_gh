Here is a long list of current TODOs:

1) Add test cases and examples for almost every method in SymplecticTableau and SymplecticTableaux factory classes. \\
2) In particular, add tests for Sheats bijection. \\
3) Add iterator for tableau of type DeConciniProcesi (currently it just iterators over KashiwaraNakashima tableaux using crystals, and then converts.) \\
4) Change everything from ``DeConciniProcesi`` to ``DeConcini`` (I'm not sure how we started using this terminology, but I think in the literature these tableau are only called DeConcini tableau.) \\
5) Write method for reverse berele bump. \\
6) Write method for a symplectic bender-knuth involution. \\
7) Write method for inverse of Sheats algorithm.
