# Issue 27749: Add function to return the nth s-gonal number

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27986

Original creator: @sheareralexj

Original creation time: 2019-06-14 00:16:20

This ticket adds a function to return elements of the s-gonal sequences. For example, this enables:

```
sage: tri = [polygonal_number(3, n) for n in [0..9]]
sage: tri
[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]
```


```
square: square = [polygonal_number(4, n) for n in [0..9]]
square: square
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

Three minor things.


```diff
-    OUTPUT:
-
-    integer
+    OUTPUT: an integer
```

and


```diff
-    - ``s`` -- integer; the size of the polygon. For example, s = 3
+    - ``s`` -- integer; the size of the polygon. For example, `s = 3`
```


and


```diff
-    return (((n**2) * (s-2)) - (n * (s-4))) / 2
+    return (((n**2) * (s-2)) - (n * (s-4))) // 2
```


(the output should be an integer and not a rational).

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.

Some more minor things I missed before.

- The arguments in the INPUT block are usually not sentences and end not with a period. See https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#input

- I would propose the following:


```diff
-    - ``s`` -- integer; the size of the polygon. For example, `s = 3`
-      returns a 3-gonal (triangular) number. `s` must be greater than 1.
+    - ``s`` -- integer greater than 1; the number of sides of the polygon
```


- The details from the input block about `s` are probably easier to read for a user on the example block as in:


```
EXAMPLES:

The triangular numbers::

    sage: [polygonal_number(3, n) for n in range(10)]
    [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]

The square numbers::

    sage: [polygonal_number(4, n) for n in range(10)]
    [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

The pentagonal numbers::

    sage: [polygonal_number(5, n) for n in range(10)]
    [0, 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117]

The hexagonal numbers::

    sage: [polygonal_number(6, n) for n in range(10)]
    [0, 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, 66, 91, 120, 153]
```


- It would be great if the other examples could be shortly illustrated by half a sentence or so. (Maybe something as `The input is converted to an integer`).

One other trivial thing:

```diff
     REFERENCES:
 
-        :wikipedia:`Polygonal_number`
+    :wikipedia:`Polygonal_number`
```

(or possibly with a bullet point `- :wikipedia:...`).
