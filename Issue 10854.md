The test should have been v in data[u]. I'll attach soon a patch doing this:


```
     sage: DiGraph([(1, 2, 0), (1,2,1)])
     Multi-digraph on 2 vertices
     sage: DiGraph([(1, 2, 0)])
     Digraph on 2 vertices
```

Btw: pyflakes complains about ``choice`` not being defined on l. 602 of this file. But I leave that to someone else to investigate this further.

I thought there would be a similar problem in graph.py, but the situation there is obviously more... symmetric `:-)`
