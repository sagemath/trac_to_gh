hey,

I download a piece of python code to test the WEBSITEs I used to trust to see on which i should change my password. When I come to trac.sage, the bug is still there. I think a update for openssl is anyway good.

see http://heartbleed.com/

However, it seems we dont need to be panic, the buy return random 64K RAM of the server. As far as i can see the RAM of the server are all the cache of pages.

AND the https service is likely closed now. Have a nice day!
