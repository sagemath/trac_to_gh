Keywords: polynomials, padics

This patch implements some useful functions (actually, essentialy, slope factorisation) for polynomials over padics.

Note: I don't know what is exactly the current status of ticket #6084 (David, are you still working on it?). Are there a conflit between these two tickets?

I've basically abandoned the code at #6084, but I would like to extract pieces of it into other tickets.  I'll try to take a look at this ticket once its prerequisites are fixed and see if I can extract anything useful from #6084 to add here.

Hello,

maybe it would be a good idea to close first the simpler ticket #6667 ?

I have made there a patch which is rather "local" but also careless about precision issues.

I see that here you are changing the behaviour of the general Newton polygon, which I would prefer to avoid. 

What would you think of trying to use for #6667 a mixture of my patch there and the part of your patch here dealing with that ?

It seems that the NewtonPolygon class is not doing what I would have expected. It gives

```
sage: NP = NewtonPolygon([ (0,0), (1,45), (3,6) ]); NP
Finite Newton polygon with 2 vertices: (0, 0), (3, 6)
```

So it is implicitely assuming that the polytope is rather a kind of "lower envelope". In my opinion, the doc needs to be enhanced, with more explanations and a link to the newton_polytope method below.

Compare to

```
sage: x,y=polygen(QQ,'x, y')
sage: p = 1 + x*y**45 + x**3*y**6
sage: p.newton_polytope()
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^2 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices
sage: p.newton_polytope().vertices()
(A vertex at (0, 0), A vertex at (1, 45), A vertex at (3, 6))
```

which is for me the expected behavior.

Anyway, I still think that this has rather to be solved in #6667.

I agree. I nevertheless prefer my patch than yours because it basically deals with precision issues.
Hence, I've extracted the relevant parts of my patch and submitted them to ticket #6667 (and I've also taken into account your remarks). If you are happy with this solution, please give a positive review to #6667 so that we can close this ticket.
