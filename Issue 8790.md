Functions `simplify`, `combine` and `prove` are actually not implemented: the code is a stub. Patch ` sage-issue-8790-not-implemented.diff` provides a docstring stating that.

I'm not sure how doctests should be provided here: one could probably change the code to raise a `NotImplemented` exception and look for that in the doctest.

The `get_bits`, `eval_*`, `reduce_*` and `tokenize` functions are
explictly described as "for internal use only".  It is inconvenient to
provide a doctest for them, as arguments are the internal
data structures used in the `SymbolicLogic` class.  

Patch ` sage-issue-8790-module-private-funcs.diffâ€‹`
renames the functions to begin with an underscore to make their
non-public nature more evident, in the hope to silence the coverage
warning.
