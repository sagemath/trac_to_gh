This patch makes the print representation of lists of elements of SL2Z more legible.
Before:

```
sage: SL2Z.gens()
([ 0 -1]
[ 1  0], [1 1]
[0 1])
```

After:

```
sage: SL2Z.gens()
(
[ 0 -1]  [1 1]
[ 1  0], [0 1]
)
```

This is a good idea. The patch looks good. All test pass here, and the patch bot on beta7 is also fine with it.
