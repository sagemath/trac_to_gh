The file sage/rings/factint.pyx needs to add `libraries=['gmp']` as a dependency now.

This apparently still isn't quite the right fix.

This needs review.  Given the troubles building on Win7, checking that this doesn't break our 'normal' builds and one other person checking on XP should be sufficient to review.

I've now checked this a number of times on Cygwin in the course of building Sage.  It would be really nice for someone to make sure this doesn't break anything on 'normal' systems, and hopefully to check it on at least one Windows box - if only so that I don't have to manually fix it whenever I get to the middle of building the Sage spkg!

User "RegB" was able to use this successfully for this - see [this sage-windows thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-windows/browse_thread/thread/b7d6ed4902914726).  

So this should have positive review.  Hopefully I can get a "real" name for this person.

Reg confirmed this attribution by real name was ok in a private email.  Welcome to the Sage community, Reg!
