There will be an automatically generated list of all tickets worked on during Sage Days 52. Please add sd52 to the keyword field of every ticket you work on during [Sage Days 52](http://wiki.sagemath.org/sagedays-padics-Rennes) so that it appears in this list.

## Developing Sage

* the old workflow is explained [here](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/)

* for the new workflow, you need to build sage following this [guide](http://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/QuickStartSageGit). The slides of the [sage-git talk](http://drugtestbots.info/rennes.pdf).
