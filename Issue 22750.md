# Issue 22750: bug in cardinality of vector space

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22987

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2017-05-12 11:37:32


```
sage: VectorSpace(QQ, 0).cardinality()
A positive finite number
```


(this is because in Sage `+Infinity ^ 0 = A positive finite number`).
