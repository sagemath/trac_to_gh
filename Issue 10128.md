If you build Sage in a path containing "numpy", then `get_systems` in citation.pyx will think that numpy is used in every command, because it does a regular expression search for "numpy" using full pathnames.  The attached patch replaces SAGE_ROOT with an empty string, to avoid such false positives.

Mike: It would be good to add your real name to the Sage Trac wiki at [http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/)
