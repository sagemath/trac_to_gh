The patch contains some module-level parsing of the Cygwin version number, but this is not actually used by the patch or anywhere in Sage that I can tell.

Unfortunately this broke in Cygwin 3.0 which changed the version number format.

I have been working on a complete revamp of the Cygwin port of psutil that will hopefully be accepted upstream.  It isn't finished yet so in the meantime it is easiest to just update the old patch to remove the unused version parsing stuff.

As I predicted, this was straightforward, and removing the broken (but unused) version parsing didn't affect anything else.

Hope to have the new psutil port in a few weeks' time.
