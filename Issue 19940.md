Some checks on the output on `decode_to_code` for Gao, Berlekamp-Welch and Key-Equation Syndrome decoders are actually useless.

I also noticed that the nature of the input code of GRS decoders is never checked: one can perform the following:

```
C = codes.RandomLinearCode(10, 4, GF(7))
D = codes.decoders.GRSGaoDecoder(C)
```

and actually construct the decoder... Whose decoding methods will utterly fail with a terrible error message!

I removed one useless check, fixed the bizarre ones, and added input sanitization on `__init__` in every GRS decoder.

This is now open for review.

```

I regrouped the checks in a private method `_decode_to_code_and_message` which returns both the message and the corresponding codeword.

That way, if one does `D.decode_to_code(r)`, it wont compute the codeword twice.

It's still open for review.

It looks good. I modified the tests that showed failure behaviour under too many errors: "too many errors" is of course not well-defined (since the receiver doesn't know the sent codeword); the relevant measure is the distance to *any* codeword.
