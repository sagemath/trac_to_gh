This did allow BRiAl to build for my on Cygwin32, but I would prefer someone who has a bit more experience than me in these things (JP) to check to make sure this is the right fix.

This looks ok.
Actually better would be to only add `-no-undefined` on Cygwin.
But that should not hurt anywhere alse (except in rare situations where undefined symbol are wanted at link time, that should not be the case here).
Did someone reported it upstream?

I did not report it upstream because the status of upstream is not clear: https://github.com/BRiAl/BRiAl only mentions polybori, and polybori maintainers. Let me cc ohanar, as he created the brial ticket in #18437.

Sure, adding -no-undefined only on cygwin would be better, but I do not see how it could hurt in any case.

I agree it's maybe not worth the pain specializing for Cygwin.
I still do remember a ticket where compilation failed on OS X for an obscure package (Singular maybe...) because on OS X you needed undefined stuff.
But here I'll live without it.
