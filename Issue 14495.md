There is no ATLAS symbols in the file you pointed because we now use a shared version of ATLAS.
But if I run ldd on the file it points to the ATLAS libs.

This doesn't at all work with `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` [unless the headers happen to be installed system-wide, which is the same situation as before], since headers don't get copied / symlinked.




What happens on MacOS X (where Sage's ATLAS by default doesn't get built)?

(Similar for Cygwin perhaps.)
