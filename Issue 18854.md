# Issue 18854: eclib upgrade to version 20150826 (bugfix)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19091

Original creator: cremona

Original creation time: 2015-08-26 11:50:06

CC:  was

Keywords: mwrank elliptic curves

I fixed a bug in mwrank reported by William Stein and Jen Balakrishnan.
Before:

```
sage: "Warning" in mwrank("[0, 0, 0, -532, -4374]")
True
```

and

```
sage: E.rank()
!!! n3 = 5 not a power of 2, rounding up to 8
Unable to compute the rank with certainty (lower bound=1).
This could be because Sha(E/Q)[2] is nontrivial.
Try calling something like two_descent(second_limit=13) on the
curve then trying this command again.  You could also try rank
with only_use_mwrank=False.
...
RuntimeError: Rank not provably correct.
```


I have made a new eclib release and will post a patch/branch and a link to the new source shortly.

After:

```
sage: "Warning" in mwrank("[0, 0, 0, -532, -4374]")
False
```


```
sage: E = EllipticCurve( [0, 0, 0, -532, -4374])
sage: E.rank()
Unable to compute the rank with certainty (lower bound=1).
This could be because Sha(E/Q)[2] is nontrivial.
Try calling something like two_descent(second_limit=13) on the
curve then trying this command again.  You could also try rank
with only_use_mwrank=False.
```


This may not look good, but mwrank is unable to compute the rank in this case since there 2-Selmer rank is 3 while the Mordell-Weil rank is in fact 1 (as can be checked independently, either by computing the analytic rank:

```
sage: E.rank(only_use_mwrank=False)
1
```

or by using 3-descent -- not available in Sage, sadly.

Is there any kind of test (doctest or unit test) for this bugfix?

No -- as the fix was entirely outside Sage I did not think that necessary.  However if you build eclib wiuth the CHECK option (as I did, using sage -i -f -c eclib) then there is a check for the curve William reported, as you can see from near the bottom of https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib/commit/aeda5ebcc5d6fa115c61e94350c01e010c5e2369

So, there is a test in upstream, not in Sage? Fine for me.

Then the only thing which remains to check is that the new version actually works in Sage.

Good.

OK, so I did and now I hope that you or someone else will too....

Thanks -- but I just saw that I had forgotten to increase the library version number from 2.0.1 so I had better change that....

OK now -- literally the conly change to the tarball is in the configure.ac file (see the diffs here: https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib/commit/aff43cf478eb35fa7ea6fb267faa56d5e595c564).  When installed, the file in SAGE_ROOT/local/lib is now libec.so.2.0.2 (was 2.0.1) with the correct links.

Of course I also changed the tarball link, the package-version.txt and checksum in the commit.
