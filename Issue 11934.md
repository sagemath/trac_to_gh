This is a script to create an *rsyncable Sage tarball*.  The spkgs are stored extracted: instead of `atlas-3.8.4.spkg`, there is a directory `atlas/`.

What about an internet-access distribution?  The spkgs could include everything except the `src` directory, which would be downloaded when you build.

Unless you mean to do the downloading/installing in parallel to save time (you could start building Sage after donwloading just a few megabytes).",

Well, I don't immediately see the "use case" for that.  Unless you mean to do the downloading/installing in parallel to save time (you could start building Sage after donwloading just a few megabytes).

Just a thought, but this would be a major step towards consolidating sage development into a small number of repositories, like how sage-on-gentoo has a single repository for all the ebuilds that do spkg installation, for example.

Looks good to me. 

Any further discussion about packaging should probably move to sage-devel or to a trac ticket once there is a concrete implementation. This ticket is mostly useful for testing, so lets leave it at that.

Don't have a gzip with --rsyncable on Gentoo :( 

A typo in sage-rsyncdist:

```
spkg/standard/atlas-3.8.4.spkg, there is a directory
spkg/standrd/atlas/ (note the directory has no version number).
```

it should be "spkg/standard" as well on the second line.
Still same file on line 44

```
if ! gzip --rsyncable </dev/null >/dev/null 2>/dev/null; then
```

Shouldn't there be some bracket somewhere?

I know, it's annoying this isn't in upstream gzip.

> A typo in sage-rsyncdist:

Thanks.

> Shouldn't there be some bracket somewhere?
No, brackets are for test operators, not for running executables, see
`help test`
in bash.
