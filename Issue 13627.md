Assignee: @williamstein

CC:  @nexttime @zimmermann6

Keywords: maxima

How to reproduce:
In a clean directory, put the following makefile

```
truc:
	/opt/sage-5.2/sage crash-maxima.sage
```

(editing the location of sage to your local setup)

In a file crash-maxima.sage, put

```
x, y = var('x y')
desolve_rk4(x*y*(2-y), y, ics=[0,1], end_points=[0, 1], step=0.5)
```


then type:

```
    make truc
```


I did not manage to reduce this further, and in particular to reproduce the issue without going through ``make``. I tried the obvious things like checking what had changed in the environment and which shell was used to run the make recipe.

This is on Ubuntu 11.10, with Sage 5.3, 5.4, 5.4.1, and 5.5.rc0. With Sage 5.3 the memory seems to be eaten up at a faster speed. A few colleagues got the same crash on slightly different platforms (it appeared in our build process for the book Calcul MathÃ©matique avec Sage).

Changing keywords from "maxima" to "maxima orphans".

FWIW, I can reproduce this on Ubuntu 10.04.4 x86, Sage 5.5.rc0, GCC 4.7.2, ...

(I killed the Maxima process after a while, before running out of swap space.)

Same behavior when running `sage -c '...'` (replacing the single-quotes in `var(...)` by double-quotes of course) from a Sage subshell invoked by `make`, but not when starting `sage` interactively, pasting the commands, from such a subshell.

No idea yet what's really going on (i.e., what Maxima or ECL end up doing), but apparently some Sage scripts indeed "get confused" (or behave differently) when run from a `make` environment, probably then triggering some Maxima bug.

Still no idea, but it doesn't seem related to environment variables (set by `make`); the only ones that differ here are `MAKE`, `MAKEFLAGS`, `MFLAGS` (the latter both empty), and `MAKELEVEL`.  (And I can't reproduce Maxima running mad with `env MAKE=... MAKEFLAGS="" MFLAGS="" MAKELEVEL=1 /path/to/sage -c '...'`.)

Wonder whether some file descriptors *somehow<sup>TM</sup>* get messed up...  (Although adding `print` to the Sage command line, the result is shown in all cases; using e.g. `make -j1` doesn't make any difference. )

Hmmm, at least using the following `Makefile` works as expected (no orphans, nor Maxima eating up all memory):


```make
maxima:
        /path/to/sage --maxima --very-quiet -r "rk(-x*(y-2)*y,y,1,[x,0,1,0.500000000000000]);"
```


So apparently *the pexpect interface* (when run from `make`, but not in an interactive Sage session) causes Maxima to do something weird afterwards...

Incidentally(?) the issue is fixed in / by installing Maxima 5.29.1 (#13364), along with ECL 12.12.1 (#13324).

Both tickets are still work in progress atm, or at least needing review... :P
