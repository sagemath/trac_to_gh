Isn't this a noop, the dylib fqn is the default install name? Maybe thats OSX version specific? I have (without this ticket)

```
$ otool -D local/lib/libarb.dylib
local/lib/libarb.dylib:
/Users/vbraun/Sage/local/lib/libarb.dylib
```

It looks like I missed a line in the configure script. That explains why there is no problems. I couldn't understand how you could get this without giving hint to the the linker on where the final library would be installed. But it is there and I missed it. This is invalid.
