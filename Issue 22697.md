I didn't see this before I did my own revisions which are now in the 8.0rc series (related to the Jupyter notebook becoming semi-default).  So no longer applies to develop.   However, most of this is still quite useful - especially if done in all translations of the tutorials.

There are 3 failing doctests in `src/doc/en/tutorial/interactive_shell.rst` related to `BackgroundJobManager`.

Currently, that part of the documentation describes an IPython magic command `%bg` which no longer exists. The examples currently there are all marked as `# not tested`. 

I'm not sure whether it makes sense to keep your update of this section since now it is about using `IPython.lib.backgroundjobs.BackgroundJobManager` and thus feels a bit out of place in a section focused on IPython magic commands.

If you (or others) feel strongly about keeping this section, then you could simply add `.. skip` before the blocks of code there to keep them out of the tests, since the code they are replacing is not being tested anyways.

Also note that you should put your real name in the "Authors:" field of this ticket.
