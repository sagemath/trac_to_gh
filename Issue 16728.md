An example:

```
# old code
sage: Q = TernaryQF([127, 2, 471, 9, 450, -8])
sage: %timeit Q.reduced_form_eisenstein(matrix = True)
10000 loops, best of 3: 140 µs per loop
# new code
sage: Q = TernaryQF([127, 2, 471, 9, 450, -8])
sage: %timeit Q.reduced_form_eisenstein(matrix = True)
10000 loops, best of 3: 40 µs per loop
```
