```
Keywords: incorrect type, factors

We have

```
sage: type(falling_factorial(x,0))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: type(falling_factorial(x,1))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```

This is inconsistent and we want

```
sage: type(falling_factorial(x,0))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```
