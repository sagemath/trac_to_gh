# Issue 16533: incorrect type of falling_factorial and rising_factorial with zero factors

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16770

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2014-08-06 08:52:45

Keywords: incorrect type, factors

We have

```
sage: type(falling_factorial(x,0))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: type(falling_factorial(x,1))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```

This is inconsistent and we want

```
sage: type(falling_factorial(x,0))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```
