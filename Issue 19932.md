# Issue 19932: Graph Generators: CompleteMultipartiteGraph plotting

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: mcognetta

Original creation time: 2016-03-05 19:24:45

Keywords: graph theory

This patch would add code to make the plot layout of complete multipartite graphs a little nicer. Currently the vertices are just scattered, making it hard to see what is in what partition. This patch would make it so that the layout was similar to this picture: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Turan_13-4.svg/180px-Turan_13-4.svg.png
