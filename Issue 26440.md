Not clear the exact issue right now, but it looks like a bad prime is being used.

Miraculously this works for the curve that is currently doctested `37a`,

Ok I added a patch, let me know if anyone thinks of a better solution, or if this should be somewhere more generic that elliptic_curve_number_field (thats just the situation I care about where I believe rational points is most common).

I didn't pull the branch to test, but don't you need to coerce the points back to original elliptic curve before returning.

You need to get the keyword 'F' before it can be used.

Maybe change the last example to

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1,0])
sage: E.rational_points(F=QuadraticField(-1))
```

so an error like this shows up.
