Not clear the exact issue right now, but it looks like a bad prime is being used.

Miraculously this works for the curve that is currently doctested `37a`,

Ok I added a patch, let me know if anyone thinks of a better solution, or if this should be somewhere more generic that elliptic_curve_number_field (thats just the situation I care about where I believe rational points is most common).

Actually this requires some more code as we need to allow


```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1,0])
sage: E.rational_points(bound=2, F= QuadraticField(-1))
```


 which currently fails

You need to get the keyword 'F' before it can be used.

Maybe change the last example to

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1,0])
sage: E.rational_points(F=QuadraticField(-1))
```

so an error like this shows up.
