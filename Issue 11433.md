Someone should have noticed this:

```
./spkg-install: line 185: [: missing `]'
Installing PARI/GP...
```


Here's the culprit:

```sh
build()
{
    ...

    $MAKE $PARI_MAKEFLAGS gp
    if [ $? -ne 0]; then
        echo >&2 "Error: building PARI/GP failed."
    fi
}
```

Note that also an `exit 1`(!) is missing there.

(Two patches apply with fuzz 2 btw.)

Oh, just came across #10240, which also provided a p6 spkg, but now is marked duplicate since the change made there (for Cygwin) should go into a new PARI 2.5.0 at #11130.

Maybe I should merge that patch (which had positive review already) into my spkg and rename it to p7.

I cannot actually test this package on Cygwin for at least two weeks (in fact, I can't on any computer right now), but the change in question for Cygwin looks right still (see #10240, as mentioned), and #10240 does in fact work (I've used it numerous times, and !RegB on the sage-windows list also was able to use it properly).    That's as close as I can get to positive review for now, I'm sorry - is that enough?  I would say that #10240 would have positive review regardless of whether it is "duplicate" or not.

As for the rest, it looks right, but I have not actually tested any of it, including the quoting etc.  I'm sure that someone even a little more advanced in shell script could give it an immediate positive review (or needs work if there is something obvious missed).

Thanks so much for merging the #10240 stuff, by the way!
