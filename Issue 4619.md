This depends on me finishing the release notes, but I am 80% done and currently working on this.

Changing status from new to assigned.

The patch doesn't apply against a repo, but shows the changes added to HISTORY.txt by adding the release notes of 3.1.3, 3.1.4 and 3.2 as well as some minimal formatting.

Cheers,

Michael
