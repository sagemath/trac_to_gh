Keywords: cached_method

A `cached_method`'s `clear_cache()` clears the entire dictionary of a `cached_method`. Currently, there is no way to only remove some keys. This is sometimes necessary if values in the cache are not usable anymore (e.g. because they are defined in some external expect interface but the external session is not running anymore, #16369).

This tickets adds an optional parameter to `clear_cache()` which removes only the specified keys from the dictionary.

From the looks of the function `set_cache` just above the one that you define, it seems that you should also handle the case of non-hashable keys.

> Currently, there is no way to only remove some keys. This is sometimes necessary if values in the cache are not usable anymore

For this use case, I see no reason to raise `KeyError` when the key does not exist: I would just ignore non-existing keys.

You should add doctests showing that this also works for a weak cached function and a cached method (not just plain cached functions).
