From the documentation:


```
    sage: F = AlgebrasWithBasis(QQ).example(); F
    An example of an algebra with basis: the free algebra on the generators ('a', 'b', 'c') over Rational Field
    sage: a,b,c = FF.algebra_generators()
    sage: F.bracket(a,b)
    B[word: ab] - B[word: ba]
```

The patch implements the Lie bracket and it would be good to merge it into sage soon. However, the tests in /categories/rings.py line 70 do not pass due to the misprint
{{
                sage: a,b,c = FF.algebra_generators()
}}
should be
{{
                sage: a,b,c = F.algebra_generators()
