```
sage: a,b,c,d,e=var('a,b,c,d,e')
sage: (e + c/a - b*c^2/(a^2*(b*c/a-d)) + c*d/(a*(b*c/a-d))).numerator()
a^2*b*c*e - a^3*d*e
sage: (c/a - b*c^2/(a^2*(b*c/a-d)) + c*d/(a*(b*c/a-d))).numerator()
0

sage: (e + c/a - b*c^2/(a^2*(b*c/a-d)) + c*d/(a*(b*c/a-d))).normalize()
(a^2*b*c*e - a^3*d*e)/((b*c - a*d)*a^2)
```
