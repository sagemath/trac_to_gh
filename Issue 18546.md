Keywords: differentiable manifolds

This is the first ticket about the implementation of differentiable manifolds resulting from the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/). See the metaticket #18528 for an overview.

The base field K of the differentiable manifolds is generic, so that the user may specify K=*R* (real manifolds) or K=*C* (complex manifolds). This ticket implements the following Python classes, all of them being subclasses of classes introduced for topological manifolds (tickets #18529, #18640, #18725):

- `DiffManifold` (subclass of `TopManifold`, cf. #18529): differentiable manifold over 
  a topological field K (Parent class)
- `DiffChart` (subclass of `Chart`, cf. #18529): chart of a K-differentiable atlas
  - `RealDiffChart` (subclass of `RealChart`, cf. #18529): chart of a K-differentiable atlas 
    for K=*R*
- `DiffCoordChange` (subclass of `CoordChange`, cf. #18529): differentiable transition map
- `DiffScalarFieldAlgebra` (subclass of `ScalarFieldAlgebra`, cf. #18640): set C<sup>k</sup>(M) of
  k-times continuously K-differentiable functions M --> K, where M is a differentiable manifold
  over K, C<sup>k</sup>(M) being a commutative algebra over K (Parent class)
- `DiffScalarField` (subclass of `ScalarField`, cf. #18640): k-times continuously 
  K-differentiable function M --> K (Element class)
- `DiffManifoldHomset` (subclass of `TopManifoldHomset`, cf. #18725): set Hom(M,N) of
  differentiable maps between the differentiable manifolds M and N over the same topological
  field K (Parent class)
- `DiffMap` (subclass of `ContinuousMap`, cf. #18725): differentiable map M --> N (Element class)
