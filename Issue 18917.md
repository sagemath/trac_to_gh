I think this ticket should be closed. It would need to be re-written to agree with the actual version of Sage and I don't think StÃ©phanie (or someone else) would do it. Moreover, I'm not convinced that creating a new function is the right thing to do to solve that problem.

I agree, but the issue still exists, so I'm setting the ticket to needs_work instead.

I proposed a new solution that makes the slower version use the faster one and at the same time deprecates the slower method.
