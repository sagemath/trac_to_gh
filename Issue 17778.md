When the graph is empty, `xmax` and `ymax` were both set to 0 but none of `xmin` and `ymin` were assigned, resulting in an error when computing `xmax - xmin` or `ymax - ymin`.

I simply defined `xmin` and `ymin` to 0 when there are no vertices.

With this change the output of `view(Graph())` is a pdf of dimensions 0x0.

Can you add a doctest showing this passes (corner cases like this are really good to have as doctests IMO)? Also, you will need to add your (real) name to the authors field.
