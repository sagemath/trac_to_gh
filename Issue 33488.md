Please don't. In terms of infrastructure, the wiki is pretty well hosted, while the VM that hosts the trac+wiki is unmaintained, so this looks like a regression to me (at least right now).

I think that trac is better, as it allows contributions with github logins. And the bus factor of the present wiki hosting is rather small.

It's critical that we get rid of the old Sage wiki. As Dima says - it excludes new developers. 

Trac is maintained because it has to be (thanks to all who keep it running!) The wiki part of it places no additional burden on maintaining Trac.

Some pages, for example https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageMathExternalPackages, are written in RST.

The Trac wiki also supports RST - https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiRestructuredText - but it looks like it is not activated.

What's the reason why a wiki is necessary in addition to the main website and the documentation in the main repo? I think this leads only to possible duplication and confusion on where to put what.

By the way, sphinx accepts also markdown as input: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/markdown.html

In the past the wiki was very useful for organizing Sage Days and generally doing things that required quick updates by many people.   I think there are much better tools for such activities these days.

If we end up running self-hosted gitlab (for mirroring, archiving, or replacing github) instead of trac, then we can move wiki to the gitlab as it also has wiki system.
