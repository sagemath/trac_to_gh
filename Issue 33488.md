Please don't. In terms of infrastructure, the wiki is pretty well hosted, while the VM that hosts the trac+wiki is unmaintained, so this looks like a regression to me (at least right now).

It's critical that we get rid of the old Sage wiki. As Dima says - it excludes new developers. 

Trac is maintained because it has to be (thanks to all who keep it running!) The wiki part of it places no additional burden on maintaining Trac.

What's the reason why a wiki is necessary in addition to the main website and the documentation in the main repo? I think this leads only to possible duplication and confusion on where to put what.
