Please don't. In terms of infrastructure, the wiki is pretty well hosted, while the VM that hosts the trac+wiki is unmaintained, so this looks like a regression to me (at least right now).

I think that trac is better, as it allows contributions with github logins. And the bus factor of the present wiki hosting is rather small.

It's critical that we get rid of the old Sage wiki. As Dima says - it excludes new developers. 

Trac is maintained because it has to be (thanks to all who keep it running!) The wiki part of it places no additional burden on maintaining Trac.

Changing priority from major to critical.

Some pages, for example https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageMathExternalPackages, are written in RST.

The Trac wiki also supports RST - https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiRestructuredText - but it looks like it is not activated. 

`@`dimpase, could you install `docutils` (as per https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiRestructuredText#Requirements)?

`@`tmonteil, would you be able to provide me with a snapshot of the moinmoin wiki data, so I can try out the script https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/MoinToTracScript?

Do you have response to this other than repeating that you're against it?

What's the reason why a wiki is necessary in addition to the main website and the documentation in the main repo? I think this leads only to possible duplication and confusion on where to put what.

By the way, sphinx accepts also markdown as input: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/markdown.html

In the past the wiki was very useful for organizing Sage Days and generally doing things that required quick updates by many people.   I think there are much better tools for such activities these days.

Yes, I agree with you. My proposal is that we can move everything to (1) Trac tickets / GitHub issues, (2) our documentation, (3) www.sagemath.org, and nothing else is needed.

Assuming github migration, Github Pages may be used to build a website to host wiki contents. It seems this website may be maintained by our developer community just like our sage repo.

Just an idea, as I have zero experience with all these. What do you think?

Ah... This is not different using the current sagemath website as this is in github as well. 

Sorry for noise.

I went through the same steps of thinking.
The only thing that's missing is support for .md files in our website scripts.

That is an important point. Together with liberal write permission to developers, that will make a search-engine-indexed website close to a wiki site...

one can hopefully have the content versioned in git (on GitHub), and then updating automatically, via [GitHub](GitHub) Actions, is doable (it's not instant WYSIWYG, but OK)

Yes, the source code of our website is maintained on github. https://github.com/sagemath/website

I agree, it would be good to add GH Actions that runs what Harald currently runs manually after merging PRs, with a preview of the generated HTML on PRs.

If we end up running self-hosted gitlab (for mirroring, archiving, or replacing github) instead of trac, then we can move wiki to the gitlab as it also has wiki system.
