Some experiment shows that this is possible to reduce the size of all cached
function by changing the seldom attribute `__module__` to a property. This
reduce in particular the size of the `CachedMethodCallerNoArgs` which is
used in a lot of places. One probably can do even better...

Oops! I just see that it is not set to needs_review. Should it be?

Some questions to Florent:

- Is there evidence that the memory footprint of cached methods currently is a problem?
- How would one measure that footprint?
- Do I understand correctly that the current branch won't merge?
