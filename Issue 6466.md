One of the elementary tool that is often needed to compute equation of motion in Physics, is functional derivative. This along with the implementation of Euler-Lagrange equation will make Sage extremely useful for physicists.

Would a good step toward this be adding dynamicsymbols from here? https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/physics/mechanics/lagrange.html

Sorry for bumping old thread, but I'm interested in working on this.
