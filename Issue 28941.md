Keywords: documentation, authentication, beginner, developer

One can authenticate themselves on the trac server in two ways. Either they have a trac username and password, or via [GitHub](GitHub). 

To be authenticated via [GitHub](GitHub), following the steps on the `Collaborative Development with Git-Trac`[https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/git_trac.html](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/git_trac.html) page, one would log onto the trac server and generate a token, and then type the following command in the terminal as given in the documentation:

`git trac config --user=<username> --token=<token>`

However, it is extremely easy to miss the fact that the username to be entered here is NOT the [GitHub](GitHub) username, but rather the trac username which is `gh-<GitHub-username>` as given on the top right corner of the trac server.

This ticket is basically to add a note in the page: [https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/git_trac.html](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/git_trac.html) reminding new developers of their trac username. 

One would have to find where in the sage directory structure the documentation file exists, make the relevant changes and commit.

If you are authenticating through **GitHub** on trac server then it's better you use OAuth directly provided by **Github** which is a much easier way of authenticating.
