(split out from #31396)

We refactor `sage_conf` to make it easier to maintain variants of it, both the 2 in-tree variants (and another one to be added in #31396) and downstream variants:'''
- The `configure`-generated configuration file is now `pkgs/sage-conf/_sage_conf/_conf.py`
- The file `pkgs/sage-conf/sage_conf.py` is now static


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33295

Three version of `sage_conf`? So

when is each one used or intended to be used? Ideally, I want something from pypi or some other repo that will give me a source tarball of the package (and only that one package).

I have spoken too soon. I see there is a file `pkgs/sage_conf/sage_conf.py.in` and its link in `sage_conf_pypi` that may still need removal. I believe it is functionally fully replaced by `_sage_conf/conf.py.in`.

Similarly, we have `pkgs/sage_conf/setup.cfg` and `pkgs/sage_conf/setup.cfg.in`, and the `.in` is not used anymore by `configure` either

Thanks for bearing with my ignorance.

This is what happens for me every time on macOS 12.4 (but not on macOS 11.6.7).

These downloaded files are unsuitable - they don't fit with the changes in the ticket.

Install the bootstrapping prerequisites (https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/spkg/_bootstrap.html#spkg-bootstrap)

Thanks Matthias and François.

Now I understand what happened.
I had uninstalled Homebrew because of some problems, and I thought I had reinstalled all that was needed. But I was wrong.

Once again, sorry for the noise.

Volker is trying to merge the ticket and I ended finding a problem. Not sure if it will have an impact on the mergability.

```
$ sage-config
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python-exec/python3.10/sage-config", line 5, in <module>
    from sage_conf.__main__ import _main
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sage_conf.__main__'; 'sage_conf' is not a package
```

It originates from `setup.cfg`

```
[options.entry_points]
console_scripts =
    sage-config = sage_conf.__main__:_main

I tried to change the last line to `sage-config = _sage_conf.__main__:_main` but it leads to a new error
