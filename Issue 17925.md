Given #16647, I think adding the java3d is not necessary, or at least not a good idea until it's working properly.

Here are two review commits.

Mainly details, but I remove the module plot3d/help from the doc because it was also about java 3D.

If you agree with my changes, set to positive review.

ok, I will allow myself to put this back to positive review. I have double-checked the diff, and the bot is happy.
