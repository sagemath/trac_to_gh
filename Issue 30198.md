From #27103#comment:10

A small improvement that speeds up the current popcount.

Before:


```
sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(8, backend='field')                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
sage: C = CombinatorialPolyhedron(P)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
sage: %time C.is_simple()

```


Eventually combinatorial polyhedron should use `data_structures/bitset.pxi`, but not before #27122 is merged.
