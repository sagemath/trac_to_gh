The following looks like a bug to me, but feel free to correct me if I'm mistaken.


```
sage: var('z')
sage: g1 = z^5 - (2 - I)*z^4 - (34 + 13*I)*z^3 + (22 - 51*I)*z^2 \
+ (53 - I)*z - 728 - 196*I == 0
sage:
sage: solve([g1], z)
[0 == z^5 + (I - 2)*z^4 - (13*I + 34)*z^3 - (51*I - 22)*z^2 -
(I - 53)*z - 196*I - 728]
sage:
sage: solve([g1, I == I], z)
[[z == (-4.00420663449 - 1.03443096055*I)], [z == (7.03872088238 +
1.11154206861*I)], [z == (1.40276621 - 2.70758376454*I)], [z == (
-3.78854832152 - 0.122376366114*I)], [z == (1.35126786363 +
1.7528490226*I)]]
sage:
sage: solve([g1, z == z], z)
[[z == (-4.00420663449 - 1.03443096055*I)], [z == (7.03872088238 +
1.11154206861*I)], [z == (1.40276621 - 2.70758376454*I)], [z == (
-3.78854832152 - 0.122376366114*I)], [z == (1.35126786363 +
1.7528490226*I)]]
```


I think the problem is that `solve()` refuses to solve equation systems with more variables than equations, even if some of the variables are already known.

Changing component from linear algebra to symbolics.

Changing assignee from jason, was to burcin.

Yes, that looks suspicious to me.  I tried replacing all the instances of I in g1 by `imag=CC((0,1))`, with no better luck.

This is not really a linear algebra problem, but more of something to do with symbolics (where g1 lives) so I am going to change the component on this so it might get noticed sooner.  If you haven't already, you might bring this up on sage-devel or sage-support - somebody might be able to confirm this as undesirable behavior, or offer a workaround.

This _could_ be related to #10750.

Should be addressed by #18900.
