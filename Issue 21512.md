OK first batch as we discussed on #12426. I presume you have some additions to that lot.

Sorry for overwriting your branch, I was working on it at the same time as you. I haven't looked at `src/module_list.py` yet (I see that you did), I'll do that now.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-10-23 20:14:45

I removed `c99` from `src/sage/arith/multi_modular.pxd` without moving it to the `.pyx` file since I couldn't see why it was needed.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-10-23 20:18:56

OK, some of the moving in `linbox` from `pxd` to `pyx` will reduce the number of files that flops from `c` to `cpp` too I presume. It will be interesting to do a new clang run with this branch.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-10-23 20:21:27

I would also like to move some `language = 'c++'` from `src/module_list.py` to `# distutils: language = c++` in `.pxd`/`.pyx` files. Should I add that to this branch?


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-10-23 20:24:17

Absolutely. `m4ri` could be given the pkg-config treatment, should we do that too?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-10-23 20:28:27

I was thinking about fixing just a few small things. No big changes like adding `pkg-config`.

Another thing I noticed: many extensions are compiled with `gmpxx` but don't seem to use it...

OK, another ticket later then.

I'll check that. Wait a minute.

I'll stop here for this ticket. Please review (and try not to insist on adding more stuff. I know this is far from perfect but at least it's a step).

Cool, for your question

```
readelf -d `find /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage -name \*.so` | grep -C 6 libgmpxx

File: /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage/modular/arithgroup/farey_symbol.so

Dynamic section at offset 0x5bb88 contains 29 entries:
  Tag        Type                         Name/Value
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libgmp.so.10]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libgmpxx.so.4]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libstdc++.so.6]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libpython2.7.so.1.0]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libgcc_s.so.1]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libc.so.6]
```

That's the only hit with libgmpxx when compiled with `-as-needed`.

Will review this today.

Was `NTL` at some point in the past compiled with `gmpxx`? That might explain...

Could, but I cannot answer that without doing sage archeology. Gentoo side as far back as ntl-5.5.2, `gmpxx` wasn't a requirement in dependency. So if it was in sage, that was probably a mistake.

I'm getting lots of bad stuff like on the patchbot 

```
[sagelib-7.5.beta0] /home/kevin/sage-patchbot/local/include/m4ri/mzd.h:1287:3: error: 'for' loop initial declarations are only allowed in C99 or C11 mode
```



---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-10-30 02:14:57

Looks like we should have put back `-std=c99` in `matrix_integer_dense.pyx`. We probably have compilers defaulting to the right standard or higher when we tested. The C/C++ confusion has gone away after moving the linbox stuff from the .pxd to the .pyx.

Acting on my comment to see what the bots do.

Seems like the latest patchbot failures are unrelated to this ticket.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-11-01 09:14:53

I don't think you should review your own commit (unless it is trivial, which is not the case here).

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-11-01 09:17:23

Anyway, the _right_ solution would be to add the flags to the file `src/sage/libs/m4ri.pxd`. If m4ri needs C99, then everything which uses that header should be compiled as C99.

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-11-01 09:39:43

OK. We already have 

```
m4ri_extra_compile_args = pkgconfig.cflags('m4ri').split()
```

if C99 is needed for `m4ri` we should get upstream to include it in the CFLAGS it sets, separately from fixing it for now.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-11-01 10:43:21

For now, I would suggest to just add `-std=c99` to `src/sage/libs/m4ri.pxd` and postpone more fundamental fixes to a new ticket.

Not suggesting we do something fundamental here, sorry if it wasn't clear. Adding looking at `m4ri` .pc file upstream to my TODO list.

Seems to work fine on the patchbot.
