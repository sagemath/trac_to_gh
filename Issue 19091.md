See [this math.SX question](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1458109/compute-automorphism-group-using-computer-software).  


```
G = CyclicPermutationGroup(4)
H = CyclicPermutationGroup(2)
D=G.direct_product(H)
D.AutomorphismGroup()
<boom>
```

Okay, that's because you receive a tuple back.  But

```
d = D[0]
d.AutomorphismGroup()
<boom for different and more annoying reason>
```

Also, there is no `gap()` method for such groups, only a `_gap_()` method, which most people will not know about.
