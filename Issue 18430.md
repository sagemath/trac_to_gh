Nobody uses

```
make build-serial
```

(what's the point anyway?)

It only clutters `Makefile`, so let's remove it.

Just to make sure: you want to remove this build rule, but you don't want to remove support for the `SAGE_PARALLEL_BUILD_SPKG` environment variable?

Yes. I don't care much about the environment variable, it doesn't bother me.

What would you think of removing both? If the grounds for removing that rule are that it is useless, why wouldn't we get rid of the variable (and its documentation) at the same time?

OK. I checked all environment variables and noticed that `SAGE_SPKG_LIST_FILES` is also completely pointless, so I'm removing that also.

Goooooooood to go. And I had no idea that you could set default values for variables in bash, i.e. `${my_variable:-3}` `:-P`
