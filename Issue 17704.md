Hello,

Shouldn't

```

be

```
if matrix[i*n+j] < l:

This suggest to add an example with `lambd > 1`.

Both work. Consider the whole matrix: for the design to be a GDD, it must have two types of entries only: `0` or `l`.

1) If the matrix is a real GDD, you can see that the two are equivalent
2) If the matrix is not a GDD, the 'error' message will differ. (wrong size of groups, or a pair not present the right number of times, or two points of a group contained in the same set, ...)

Do you have an example in mind?
