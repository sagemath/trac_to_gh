# Issue 22630: LatticePoset: Reverse completion_by_cuts()

Dedekind-MacNeille completion can be defined as a smallest lattice containing given partial order. However, in Sage `completion_by_cuts()` gives the dual; try


```
Y = Poset({1: [2], 2: [3, 4]})
Y.completion_by_cuts()
```


Hence I suggest that we reverse the output of this function.

I think we should add a doctest. Otherwise LGTM.

Added, but now compiling on a slow machine and so not tested.

I also added a non-related correction to a docstring in `lattices.py`.
