# Issue 15338: Remove deprecated functions from symmetric functions

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: zabrocki

Original creation time: 2013-12-23 17:12:34

CC:  aschilling combinat

Keywords: deprecate, sf

The class for each basis of the symmetric functions was deprecated from the global name space in #5457 and the ticket was merged in sage-5.4.

The this ticket will remove the following functions:

`SFAPower`, `SFAElementary`, `SFAHomogeneous`, `SFASchur`, `SFAMonomial`

`JackPolynomialsP`, `JackPolynomialsQ`, `JackPolynomialsJ`, `JackPolynomialsQp`, `ZonalPolynomials`

`HallLittlewoodP`, `HallLittlewoodQ`, `HallLittlewoodQp`

`MacdonaldPolynomialsP`, `MacdonaldPolynomialsQ`, `MacdonaldPolynomialsJ`, `MacdonaldPolynomialsH`, `MacdonaldPolynomialsHt`, `MacdonaldPolynomialsS`

`LLT`, `LLTHSpin`, `LLTHCospin`

all of `kschur.py`

The way of accessing these functions since sage-5.4 is to get the basis from within `SymmetricFunctions(R)`.

Darij and I have already taken care of a chunk of this in #15473. I believe all that's left is removing `kschur.py`.

`src/sage/combinat/sf/classical.py` still imports kschur, crashing Sage on startup.

Strange.  I did not get an error from that import statement.  Certainly no startup crash.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2014-01-05 16:56:29

Ack, we forgot to run `sage -sync-build` (I can't believe I forgot this again, sorry!), so the `kschur.py` still existed in the compiled part of Sage. I'm just waiting for things to recompile (I had bumped develop versions) and will double-check.

Okay, after running `sage -sync-build`, Sage starts. Running some greps for importing the old kschur file also comes up empty.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-01-06 08:48:42

Can you run "make ptestlong", too? Its still not working. For example, `src/sage/tests/book_schilling_zabrocki_kschur_primer.py` fails.

`sage -sync-build` fails for me because it tells me that it cannot remove some non-empty directory.  I just went in and deleted the `kschur.py` and `kschur.pyc` before rerunning tests and even being able to trigger the error.  Conclusion: I am not 100% confident that I got it all so please rerun tests on your machine too.

I have run all tests (including long ones) in `sage/combinat` and `sage/algebras` with the `kschur.py` file replaced by a mostly empty file instead of deleted. They passed.

I've also re-introduced doctests from the old kschur.py with new syntax (whenever they still made sense).

Replying to [comment:14 zabrocki]:
> `sage -sync-build` fails for me because it tells me that it cannot remove some non-empty directory.

See #15566.

I must have done my grep-ing accidentally just in the combinat folder... `:/` Anyways the tests pass for me. I'll let Mike and/or Anne verify Darij's changes before we set this back to positive review.


---

Comment by zabrocki created at 2014-01-06 16:20:52

Those doc tests were updated and moved to `sf.py`.  I think it is not a bad idea to keep some of them in `new_kschur.py` but statements like "This fact is not currently incorporated into the Sage design" is now false.


---

Comment by darij created at 2014-01-06 16:23:36

Why is it false? `ks3([2,1]) * ks3([2,1])` does not return an element of `ks6`...


---

Comment by zabrocki created at 2014-01-06 16:29:56

You no longer need to lift it up to the ambient symmetric function space in order to do the multiplication (as is shown in that example with `f = s(ks2([2,1]))^2; ks4(f)`.  Before `ks4( ks2([2,1])^2 )` would have raised an error. Instead now you can compute directly `ks4( ks2[2,1] * ks2[2,1] )` and this was made clearer in the updated examples.


---

Comment by darij created at 2014-01-06 16:33:55

Actually, this is still somewhat unsolved... `ks3([2,1]) * ks2([1])` returns a TypeError. Is there a way to fix this? (Also, the exponentiation syntax doesn't work when t != 1, even if the answer would be in the k-Schur.)


---

Comment by zabrocki created at 2014-01-06 16:39:10

You are right.  These things are bad.  But I wouldn't want to do that in this ticket.


---

Comment by aschilling created at 2014-01-06 16:49:12

Well, I think just writing ks3([2,1])*ks3([3,2]) would be ambiguous. At t=1 it could either be in the 3-space or in the 6-space. I think it is better to leave it up to the user to decide what (s)he wants to do. 

Also the comment about returning 0 when the partition is not k-bounded I think should be removed. The k-Schur functions are not defined in this case.

You probably should do the register unpickle override thing to make this unpickle-able.

Hi Volker,

I do not seem to get this error

```
$structure anne$ pwd
/Applications/sage/src/sage/structure
$structure anne$ sage -t --long sage_object.pyx

The command that is suggested in your error message does not work for us. Are we supposed to update the pickle jar?

Can you try "sage -sync-build" or "make distclean" and rebuild? It's prey clear that something kschur-related is in the pickle jar. Ideally you'd override it to unpickle to the new code...

Hi Volker,

Ok, I can reproduce the error now. But how are we supposed to fix it? Here are three scenarios and none of them work:

```

See also "The Pickle Jar" in the developer guide. I don't know how much the new and old kschur diverge, so its not clear whether this can be patched up. You want the following to work:

```

You'd definitely have to override `kSchurFunctions_t` and `kSchurFunction_t`. If you want to remove the pickle since everything has been properly deprecated post to sage-devel.

Mike removed the old kSchur pickle jars. For me the tests pass now, so I am setting this back to positive review.

Will this ticket get merged?

Yes, but since it is not particularly pressing I'll wait for 6.2.beta0.

sage-6.2.beta1 is out and this still does not seem to be merged :-(
