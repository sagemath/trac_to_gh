CC:  aschilling combinat

Keywords: deprecate, sf

The class for each basis of the symmetric functions was deprecated from the global name space in #5457 and the ticket was merged in sage-5.4.

The this ticket will remove the following functions:

`SFAPower`, `SFAElementary`, `SFAHomogeneous`, `SFASchur`, `SFAMonomial`

`JackPolynomialsP`, `JackPolynomialsQ`, `JackPolynomialsJ`, `JackPolynomialsQp`, `ZonalPolynomials`

`HallLittlewoodP`, `HallLittlewoodQ`, `HallLittlewoodQp`

`MacdonaldPolynomialsP`, `MacdonaldPolynomialsQ`, `MacdonaldPolynomialsJ`, `MacdonaldPolynomialsH`, `MacdonaldPolynomialsHt`, `MacdonaldPolynomialsS`

`LLT`, `LLTHSpin`, `LLTHCospin`

all of `kschur.py`

The way of accessing these functions since sage-5.4 is to get the basis from within `SymmetricFunctions(R)`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15575
