**Every** doctest failure should be a blocker. That's why I care so much to not introduce artificial doctest failures in #18904.

It's a bit weird to say that something is a blocker even though our automated testing (patchbots, Volker's tests before each release) does not even detect it.

> That's why I care so much to not introduce artificial doctest failures in #18904.

If only you did not try to hid bugs under the carpet in order to preserve the appearance of reliability ...

I also want all doctests to pass. My method to do so is to let them scream when they want to, and to fix the problems.

Sigh... Well, the good thing about this bug is that it says that there are reasons for me to re-run my patchbot again. With many packages.
