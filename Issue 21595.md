# Issue 21595: correct latex representation of variable in LaurentPolynomial

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21832

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2016-11-07 09:53:34

We want

```
sage: L.<lambda2> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: latex(L.an_element())
\lambda_{2}
```

which is currently not the case.

Unless I'm misunderstanding something, the description was incorrect: the univariate case already works.

Merged in 7.5.beta2: non-trivial merge, but easy to merge. Needs_review again (to be sure).
