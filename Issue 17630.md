Ticket #14288 added a feature meant for educational purposes only which can *very easily* be confused with Sage's support of Linear Programming, as the two classes it creates are named LPProblem and LPProblemStandardForm *AND* imported in the global namespace.

That's suicidal.

With this branch, the two classes are renamed to something more meaningful, pointers are added toward MixedIntegerLinearProgram, and the old import are deprecated.

Hello,

I expect.

Definitely, and these certificates are produced for free when using simplex method, one should just get them out - do solvers interfaces from Sage support providing them?

Commercial solvers like CPLEX and GUROBI do provide these certs, as well as CVXOPT, but GLPK apparently not, cf https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-glpk/2010-11/msg00062.html
Apparently this is still the case, although the latter conversation took place in 2010.

Not sure about PPL.

for ineasibility, a Farkas certificate (i.e. coefficients of a nonnegative linear
combination of inequalities producing a contradiction) seems to be an obvious choice.

floats, or the other appropriate base ring (e.g. rationals for PPL).

Anything that maps correctly into the list of constraints would do.
