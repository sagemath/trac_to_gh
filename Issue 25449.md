```
sage: UCF = UniversalCyclotomicField()
sage: UCF.is_finite()
True
```


This is explicitly given in the code of universal_cyclotomic_field.py:


```
    def is_finite(self):
        r"""
        Returns ``True``.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: UniversalCyclotomicField().is_finite()
            True

        .. TODO::

            this method should be provided by the category.
        """
        return True
```


This has been correct before a change in April 2015 (Trac #1852). It looks like a mistake in connection with that ticket. The old code from git looked like this:

Thus the task might be to restore the old code!

We (Travis and me) tried to move the `is_finite` method to the category framework. But this lead into difficulties. Thus, we let it fall back to `is_finite` in rings.pyx replacing the raise of `NotImplementedError` to a `super(Ring, self).is_finite()`-call.
