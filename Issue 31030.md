CC:  @dimpase @zlscherr @kliem

running on Ubuntu 18.04

config-log and build-log is attached.

The bug seems to have something to do with this error message:

[python3-3.8.5] Following modules built successfully but were removed because they could not be imported:
[python3-3.8.5] readline

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31267

From `python3...log`:

```
checking for getc_unlocked() and friends... yes
checking how to link readline libs... -lreadline -ltinfo

```

but when python3 actually links readline, it is doing something else:

The issue likely arises because `find_library_file` inspects the system library but then the Sage-built library is used for linking https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/setup.py#L977

I think this is a limitation of distutils - it does not know about `LIBRARY_PATH`

This looks like `make singular-clean sagelib-clean build` could fix it
