Hello Christian,

Indeed! The (1,k) should be changed in other places as well

```
sage: UCF = UniversalCyclotomicField()
sage: UCFtoQQbar = UCF.coerce_embedding()
sage: UCFtoQQbar(UCF.gen(4)+1)
1*I
sage: UCFtoQQbar(UCF.gen(4))
1*I
```

also 

```
sage: CC(UCF.gen(4))
1.00000000000000*I
sage: CC(UCF.gen(4)+1)
1.00000000000000*I
```
