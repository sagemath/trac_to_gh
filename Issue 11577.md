Nice. Positive review from me.

BTW for future reference you can syntax-highlight python code in trac comments by putting `#!python` on the first line of the raw content inside triple braces (see the main page of Sage trac which I added some examples of this to).

*Ooops. I wrote this a few hours ago, but forgot to click the submit button.*

> I generated the patch with this code, plus a handful (less than a dozen) manual touch-ups where, e.g., symbols were used in eval() strings but not directly. 

Ok, so it is rather conservative with the exception of `eval()` and friends.

We should perhaps especially inspect those files modified that have a low "coverage"(though I strongly doubt the doctests of others will cover most execution paths...).


I think more sophisticated detection of superfluous imports can be left for follow-up tickets, just like the inclusion of Cython files.

The patch is certainly a big step forwards as is.

P.S.: I'm pretty sure Robert knows about trac's wiki markup for source code etc. ;)
