Python's `multiprocessing.Pool` hangs when a `BaseException` that is not an `Excepion` happens in the function it runs; we need to wrap these in "normal" Exception's so they get thrown correctly by the pool's `get`.

I think I've seen a similar issue before, albeit rarely.  Last year I started working on a generalized version of the parallel doctest runner from `sage.doctest.forker` that could also be used in docbuilds (and provided better exception handling for free).  

However, I had some minor bugs in my implementation that I never quite finished working out, and then got distracted and never finished it.  I'd really like that get that project up and running again...

Do you have any idea what's causing a non-`Exception` exception to be raised from the docbuild?

The only thing I can think of is if it's an exception coming from Cysignals, and even then it's not clear what the exception would be in that case (an alarm, maybe?)

Otherwise the fix certainly makes sense.

Huge +1 (disclaimer: I wrote that doctest forker).

`multiprocessing` is broken in many ways. For this ticket, wouldn't it be possible to patch `multiprocessing` instead? That way, all users of `multiprocessing` would benefit, not only the docbuilder.

`KeyboardInterrupt` is a likely candidate. This probably explains why interrupting the docbuilder is unreliable.

Maybe something coming out of cysignals. But I have no clue really.

This is only slightly related, but I wanted to bring this other patch to your attention:

If that is adopted, a side-effect (I think) would be to avoid the need for this patch, since all errors would instead become CalledProcessErrors.

I think what Jeroen means is as a more robust alternative to using `multiprocessing.Pool.map` and the like, as is currently used by the docbuilder.

My prototype implementation was compatible with (and this is why it was a bit difficult to get right) [concurrent.futures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html) API, albeit extended to cover the additional features that the doctest runner has, such as capturing standard I/O from the worker processes.

It's possible that if a process is taking too long, or otherwise going beyond its allowed resource usage the CI runner tries to stop it, and it might start out "nice" and just send Ctrl-Cs, though it also might move on to SIGTERM and/or SIGKILL.

It sounds to me like the enormous memory usage of the docbuild might still be a problem for #24655.  We may need to try to do more work on fixing that...

So, the underlying problem here was really the memory usage of the sequential docbuild, see #24655. Anyway, I think the change proposed here still makes sense.
