There is a flatsurf package now developed as an independent package that provides much more than what is currently in Sage. This ticket propose to remove all source code in `sage.dynamics.flat_surfaces` and `sage.dynamics.interval_exchanges`. What is in the package is more complete and reliable.

Reading `Permutation is deprecated and will be removed from Sage` is quite funny but we understand that it is the one in `iet` that is meant.
