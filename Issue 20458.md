Reading `Permutation is deprecated and will be removed from Sage` is quite funny but we understand that it is the one in `iet` that is meant.


```

/home/slabbe/GitBox/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/dynamics/interval_exchanges/constructors.py:985: DeprecationWarning: IntervalExchangeTransformation is deprecated and will be removed from Sage.
You are advised to install the surface_dynamics package via:
    sage -pip install surface_dynamics
If you do not have write access to the Sage installation you can
alternatively do
    sage -pip install surface_dynamics --user

computation that are currently available in Sage. See more
