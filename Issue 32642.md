It works well. I am positive with the branch.

One small comment: I am dimly aware that there was a discussion somewhere(perhaps on sage-devel) on using two space characters (vs. one space character) to separate sentences. I don't remember the conclusion, but I feel uncomfortable with it, just like a typo. Hence please fix:

```diff
 - name: 'namespace_pkg_all_import: import from .all of a namespace package'
   hint: |
     Sage library code should not import from sage.PAC.KAGE.all when sage.PAC.KAGE is an implicit
-    Hint: namespace package.  Type import_statements("SOME_IDENTIFIER") to find a more specific import.
+    Hint: namespace package. Type import_statements("SOME_IDENTIFIER") to find a more specific import.
   pattern: 'from\s+sage[.](categories|misc|rings|combinat|graphs|interfaces|libs)[.]all\s+import'
   filePattern: '.*[.](py|pyx)$'
```

Resolution: fixed

Imho, it is a very bad idea to introduce a check before it has been fully fixed. This just makes the linter useless.

Useless, I don't think so. Sorry for ruining the green linter checkmarks on the tickets though

I have to agree. Now the linter workflow is falling for each ticket and it's no longer clear if that's because the ticket introduced some new issues or because of the all imports. 

I propose to either remove the all imports soon or demote this check to a warning instead of an error (if that's possible with relint).

+1, help welcome

Sorry, but if you don't plan to work on this yourself I would say we should demote it for now to a warning and fully activate it later.
