The Sage installation guide has a section on installing Sage from source

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html

but it is inaccurate, incomplete and dangerous in certain places. Specific problems are below. These are roughly listed in the order they appear in the manual. 

* It fails to point out one of the advantages of building from source is that certain parts of Sage get optimised for ones own computer. 
* It has a list of supported systems, which is outdated, so I replaced that with a link to http://wiki.sagemath.org/SupportedPlatforms. Current it has outdated comments like:
  * *We hope to support OS X 10.5 in our next release* and 
  * *We do plan to fully support Solaris - itâ€™s a very important platform.* 
* The information about `perl` is inaccurate. This is also needed for R, and it must be at least `perl 5.8.0`. I added the list of versions of software where appropriate.
* It suggests use of the `which` command, but a more portable version is to use `command -v`, as `which` is not a required component of a UNIX operating system - it is not defined by POSIX and was the source of one issue on Solaris. 
* It says if `which m4` returns nothing or an error than `m4` is not installed. But it could well be installed, but not in the PATH. 
* There's a comment about the `m4` command. I added a note this was installed in `/usr/ccs/bin` on Solaris, as this is far from obvious. There are a few other Solaris notes I made. 
* It says you need to have `ssh-keygen` installed to run the server in secure mode, which is true. It then says *To run it in insecure mode, run the command notebook(secure=False) instead of notebook()* but this is incorrect, as the default is to run in insecure mode. 
* It recommends on installs the readline package, yet this is part of Sage.
* It says *Sage is currently being developed using GCC version 4.3.x*, whereas in fact Sage tends to be developed with pretty recent versions of the compilers. 
* There's a reference to a system wide `gFortran`, whereas the command has no capital F. 
* It says starting Sage for the **first** time can take a few seconds. I changed that to a few minutes, as running Sage for the n<sup>th</sup> time, where n>1 can take more than a minute on some systems.

* Since there were some comments about building Sage from source as root, mainly due to Luis Finotti, I felt obliged to add my own comment that I think building Sage as root is dangerous, and provided a link to a trac bug (#9551) where Sage would have overwritten a system file had I been stupid enough to build as root. 
* As much as I think it's silly building Sage as root in `/usr/local`, I updated the version of the example from 2.5.2 to 4.6.2.
 

I've put quite a bit of work into this, and I think generally it is an improvement. I'll be receptive to constructive comments. But **PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE** can we avoid what happens on tickets some times, when tons of people argue about the smallest of details and tickets drag on for months.

A few comments for improvement:
* I think it would be nice to have at least the main "fully supported" versions here.  No need to go clicking through if you are on a normal system, then, and also it will be clear that e.g. Windows 7 is not on that list just by looking at it.  Something like "supported on many Linux distributions, Mac OS X, and 32-bit Solaris; see ... for details and status of other systems." I'm not wedded to that phrasing, but it's reasonable to have at least minimal info.
* A minor note should be added that gfortran is not provided by Xcode on OS X, but that Sage provides a suitable Fortran compiler for OS X.
* Even for my ancient < 1 GHz Emac (probably from around 2003), it takes less than a minute for Sage to start up the first time (though it's close!).  I think it is more reasonable to say "starting the first time may take more than a few seconds; a few platforms will take longer for reason X" where it is clear that reason X is something about the platform, not Sage.
* "**Note from David Kirkby.** " - is that going to look ok in the docs?  Maybe instead using the ".. note:" syntax...

All the updates etc. and changes for more accurate documentation look fine, though I'm sure more knowledgeable folks will have some minor changes there, since it's a rule that any patch longer than 1 character has a bug :-)

Nice work cleaning this up, Dave.  We are very fortunate that Sage has enough people who care about this kind of thing that we do eventually clean them up!

OK, point taken. I'll keep that to the bare minimum though. I don't think its true to say Sage is "supported on many Linux distributions" when we only test on a few. The issue we had before was a huge range of "supported" Linux distributions, which nobody had tested on for ages, if at all. 

>  * A minor note should be added that gfortran is not provided by Xcode on OS X, but that Sage provides a suitable Fortran compiler for OS X.


I can add that, though the current documentation does say in this very file:

*On Mac OS X, you are not required to have a Fortran compiler on your system. The Sage source distribution is shipped with a Fortran compiler for Mac OS X. This Fortran compiler is used, unless you specify another Fortran compiler via the variable SAGE_FORTRAN.*

>  * Even for my ancient < 1 GHz Emac (probably from around 2003), it takes less than a minute for Sage to start up the first time (though it's close!).  I think it is more reasonable to say "starting the first time may take more than a few seconds; a few platforms will take longer for reason X" where it is clear that reason X is something about the platform, not Sage.


I hear plenty of complaints on sage-devel of Sage taking a very long time to start. 

>  * "**Note from David Kirkby.** " - is that going to look ok in the docs?  Maybe instead using the ".. note:" syntax...


In my opinion it looked ok, but perhaps I'm biased. I don't know how to use the *note syntax*. I wanted to make this quite prominent, as I think its a pretty important point. We are documenting how to do something that any decent system administer knows one should never do.

Yes, I just want to avoid it becoming like tickets have become. I feel quite sorry for John, as I feel that reviewers have requested changes far outside the scope of some of John's tickets. 

> Nice work cleaning this up, Dave.  We are very fortunate that Sage has enough people who care about this kind of thing that we do eventually clean them up!


I think documentation will always tend to be out of date. We can however limit that by not being too specific. The original version saying developers use gcc 4.3.x was just asking for trouble.

Is it anywhere near where your thing is?  My concern was people on OS X thinking they needed to get/had gfortran.

Fair enough. As a matter of interest, William wrote here

some slow filesystems), then this wouldn't help at all"''

but I guess that is the exception rather than the rule. It takes 30 s on my 2.0 GHz laptop. It appears to be I/O limited. I'll mention that.

I'll make some revisions and post an update. Then perhaps you can generate the documentation and look at in a browser.

How about saying: 

*"Sage should take well under a minute to start for the first time, but it can take a few minutes on a slow or busy file system?"* 

I did also think of putting something to the effect of 

*If possible install Sage on a local disk or fast system, as Sage loads a large number of files, which can mean Sage is slow to start on some file systems*. 

The trouble with these changes is that they are subjective. Most of the other points are just correcting indisputable facts.

I think one useful addition to the bottom of a page might be

*"Last updated on x/y/z"* 

so hopefully we can find pages that are well out of date. 

It's hard to believe that a page as important as describing how to build Sage from source has so many inaccuracies in it. I suspect this has not been properly updated for a few years.

Do you know a relieable automated way?

Well, hopefully either the author or reviewer would notice. 

The worst that can happen if someone forgets to update the line (and the reviewer does not notice), is that users will think the information is more outdated than it really is. 

> Also, I don't see much usefulness in such a line.


Users can determine if the information is current, which is quite important with information like this. It can tend to go out of date. If users see the information was written a year or more ago, they might realise its probably inaccurate. 

> It would be really good to have this in sage-4.7.

Would it be better to change the paragraph on supported systems from

```
Sage is supported on ...
```
to

```
As of April 2011, Sage is supported on ...
```
Then anyone who changes the list of supported platforms are more likely to see the date than if the date is at the bottom of the document.  (I know the other information in the document is also time-sensitive, but not quite as much as the list of supported platforms.)

Alternatively, we could add something like this to the very top of the file:

```
.. comment:
   ****************************
   If you alter this document, please change the last line ("This page
   was last updated on ...")
   ****************************

Hi Dave,

```
tar        (GNU tar, version 1.17 or later)
```
is not quite right. On MacOSX the tar is a BSD tar:

```
$ tar --version
bsdtar 2.6.2 - libarchive 2.6.2
```

Perhaps GNU tar is a Solaris-only requirement...
