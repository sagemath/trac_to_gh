This SPKG is a disaster - uncommitted changes, untracked files, no .hgignore, SPKG.txt not containing any of the required information, patches that are actually full files to be copied, `src/` directory that has already been halfway patched, dependency on bison not mentioned anywhere, package is built in-place in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` and left there with all sources...

feel free to unify this with #8151
and close the latter...

Cool, even the upstream source is screwed up...

Will do.

Well, here's an SPKG: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/keshav/files/lie-2.2.2.p4.spkg

Questions: should the files really be put in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/LiE`? They are not exactly libraries. But they are not exactly "architecture-independent" (since they contain binaries), so the FHS says they shouldn't go in `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/LiE` either. Or should I try to strip all the source and put the resulting stuff in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/LiE`? That seems like maybe the most reasonable option, but then I need to figure out which files are unnecessary for the final binary.
