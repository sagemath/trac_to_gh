This SPKG is a disaster - uncommitted changes, untracked files, no .hgignore, SPKG.txt not containing any of the required information, patches that are actually full files to be copied, `src/` directory that has already been halfway patched, dependency on bison not mentioned anywhere, package is built in-place in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` and left there with all sources...

Well, here's an SPKG: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/keshav/files/lie-2.2.2.p4.spkg
