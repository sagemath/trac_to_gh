# Issue 19958: Minor documentation bug in limit

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2016-03-11 09:30:51

The `dir='above'` option for `limit` has been deprecated since #9200, but the first example in the docstring still uses it, instead of `dir='+'`.
