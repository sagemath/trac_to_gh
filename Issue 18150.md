# Issue 18150: Use type(x) instead of x.__class__ when assigning to cdef type

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

In cython code, replace

```
cdef type t = x.__class__
```

by

```
cdef type t = type(x)
```

For Cython extension types, we know that `type(x)` is `x.__class__`, so this code should be equivalent, but `type(x)` is a lot faster because Cython optimizes it.
