Apparently we don't have such a thing, or only the very rudimentary general interface one.

```
sage: b = octave("[ 1, 1, 2; 3, 5, 8; 13, 21, 33 ]")
sage: b._sage_repr()
'   1 1 2  3 5 8  13 21 33  '
sage: b._sage_()
<snip>
NotImplementedError: Unable to parse output:    1 1 2  3 5 8  13 21 33
```

See [this tex.stackexchange question](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/43706/octave-to-latex) for why people want this (to make Octave turn into LaTeX).
