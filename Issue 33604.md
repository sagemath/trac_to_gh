Now with this simplification, were it not for the "relocate-once" code (which is only needed for Volker's binary packaging), we can just replace `SAGE_ROOT/sage` by a symlink to `src/bin/sage`.

https://github.com/sagemath/binary-pkg
could just replace the symlink by the custom script that runs relocate-once.

Not sure if this is really an improvement, but it's a simplification of sorts.
