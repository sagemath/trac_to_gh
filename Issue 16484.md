Here's another example, which seems to put this in the "mathematically wrong answer" category:

```
sage: sum(gcd(x, 4), x, 1, 4)
4
```

I would expect the answer to be 8 instead of 4:

```
sage: [gcd(x, 4) for x in range(1, 5)]
[1, 2, 1, 4]
sage: sum(gcd(x, 4) for x in range(1, 5))
8

I think the problem is that while we do get the "right" thing when two polynomials are involved, we somehow don't for a polynomial and an integer, and this isn't well documented.  I agree that the end user may not care and that we should find a way to fix it (or at least to raise an error when a symbolic thing shows up in it).  This won't be completely trivial, though.

You'd first need to decide what "gcd(A,B)" of two symbolic expressions is:
- if it's "integer" gcd then it can be evaluated for integers entries, it's an error if you feed it something else ostensibly numeric, and it can be left unevaluated if there are variables in there.
- if it's (univariate) polynomial gcd, there needs to be some heuristic to choose the variable wrt. which it would be the gcd (or better, this variable would be part of the input). Anything else would be considered an (invertible) coefficient. This would never be left unevaluated. This is close to what we have now. 

We have too little information to define gcd on SR properly. Currently even this doesn't work:

```
gcd(x,sqrt(2)*x)
```

The gcd we are currently interfacing with is:

```
x.gcd
```
which is limited to polynomials over QQ, but at least it fixes the choice: it's polynomial gcd.
That means `gcd(x,4)` should indeed be `1` (or at least a constant).

In any setting, gcd tends to be not stable under evaluation, meaning that if

```
G(x) = gcd (a(x),b(x))
```
then for a specialization `x0` of x, one can easily have that `gcd(a(x0),b(x0)) != G(x0)`. That means a "symbolic" gcd will always be problematic.

How do you control when `hold=True` is triggered to be expanded? In particular, in

```
sum( gcd( x^2+n,x,hold=True),n,-2,2,hold=True )
```
what do you do to clear to "unhold" the expression and how do you control the order in which that happens? In particular, for your application, you'd need the values of `n` to be substituted *before* the hold on `gcd` is cleared.

I do not understand. In what way is this different from

sum(sin(n*pi,hold=True),n,1,5,hold=True)

TypeError: symbolic_sum() got an unexpected keyword argument 'hold'
```
which simply does not work, and from which one usually comes to this:

sin(pi) + sin(5*pi) + sin(4*pi) + sin(3*pi) + sin(2*pi)

You can usually get an implicit hold by doing something like\n\n```\nf(N)=sum(...,n,1,N)\n```\nand with that transform you see that your suggested iterator expression is NOT the same:\n\n```\nsage: var(\"t,T\")\n(t, T)\nsage: sum(sin(t*pi,hold=True),t,1,T)\n0\n```\nThe hold apparently gets lifted by \"sum\" already (because our \"hold\" doesn't get translated to maxima, perhaps because a corresponding notion doesn't exist for sine there) and apparently, sum simplifies the expression under the assumption that t is an integer.\n\nThat's why I think \"hold\" is not an appropriate mechanism for a wildly non-continuous function such as \"gcd\". It's meant to be a manipulation on (polynomial) expressions, not a symbolic function. I don't think SR is equipped to handle operations like that \"symbolically\".\n\nI know systems like maple and mathematica tend to not make a distinction between \"operations\" and \"symbolic expressions\", allowing deferred evaluation on pretty much anything, and in my experience predictability and debuggability of code suffers from it.\n\nNothing prevents you from defining `function(\"completely_inert_gcd\")` and writing expressions with that. The problem arises when you start trying to use simplification/evaluation rules on this expression. Normally, you'd from the inside to the outside; for your sum example you'd need it from the outside to the inside. We can't really have both if we don't have a way to indicate which method to use where.",

The problem is that "hold" semantics aren't well-defined, so you'd better make sure that for "held" expressions, the answers aren't wildly different depending on when the "hold" is lifted. Never mind that "hold" isn't implemented for sums. You can usually get an implicit hold by doing something like

```
f(N)=sum(...,n,1,N)
```
and with that transform you see that your suggested iterator expression is NOT the same:

```
sage: var("t,T")
(t, T)
sage: sum(sin(t*pi,hold=True),t,1,T)
0
```
The hold apparently gets lifted by "sum" already (because our "hold" doesn't get translated to maxima, perhaps because a corresponding notion doesn't exist for sine there) and apparently, sum simplifies the expression under the assumption that t is an integer.

That's why I think "hold" is not an appropriate mechanism for a wildly non-continuous function such as "gcd". It's meant to be a manipulation on (polynomial) expressions, not a symbolic function. I don't think SR is equipped to handle operations like that "symbolically".

I know systems like maple and mathematica tend to not make a distinction between "operations" and "symbolic expressions", allowing deferred evaluation on pretty much anything, and in my experience predictability and debuggability of code suffers from it.

Nothing prevents you from defining `function("completely_inert_gcd")` and writing expressions with that. The problem arises when you start trying to use simplification/evaluation rules on this expression. Normally, you'd from the inside to the outside; for your sum example you'd need it from the outside to the inside. We can't really have both if we don't have a way to indicate which method to use where.

So, summarily, `gcd` itself has nothing to enhance in this direction, and this ticket should not be stretched to implement something only marginally useful.
