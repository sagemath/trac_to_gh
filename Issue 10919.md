To reproduce the bug:

 * open a new worksheet. 
 * make a text cell with some text.
 * make another text cell right after the previous one.
 * open the worksheet in another window, then 'save&quit'.
----- 
desyncronization occurs, because the two text cells are merged in server, but not in the first user window.
 * back in the first window, try to edit one of the two text cells. The text will either disappear or become a code cell.
