# Issue 28099: Genus outputs -1 sometimes.

Sage outputs -1 as the genus of a curve, it should probably throw an error instead. The genus function doesn't seem to check if the function is irreducible, and it just attempts to calculate the genus anyway. 

sage: FF.<c>=QQ[] \\
sage: R.<x>=FF[]\\
sage: K=QQ[c,x]\\
sage: poly2=K(x<sup>2-c</sup>4)\\
sage: C2=Curve(poly2)\\
sage: C2.genus()\\
-1
