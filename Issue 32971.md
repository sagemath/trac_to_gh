# Issue 32971: Remove unused code from sage/rings/padics/pow_computer_ext.pyt

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33208

Original creator: mjo

Original creation time: 2022-01-20 13:25:51

The declaration of `tmp` and the reading of its value into the void below clearly serve no purpose, and raise a cython warning:


```python
def polynomial(self):
    ...
    cdef ZZ_pX_Modulus_c* tmp
    tmp.val()
    self.restore_top_context()
    cdef ntl_ZZ_pX r = ntl_ZZ_pX.__new__(ntl_ZZ_pX)
    r.c = self.get_top_context()
    r.x = (self.get_top_modulus()[0]).val()
    return r
```
