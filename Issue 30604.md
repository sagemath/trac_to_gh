# Issue 30604: bootstrap: Do not depend on sage-env, sage-env-config

Follow-up from #30795, #30128, #29174.

We make bootstrap independent of `sage-env` and `sage-env-config`. 
(This dependency was introduced in #21214 to get autotools from `SAGE_LOCAL` into `PATH`. This is no longer needed after the removal of the `autotools` spkg.)

well, this appears to cause a possible change in behavour, as `sage-env-config` etc potentially sets variables affecting `./configure`, no?

`bootstrap` does not run `configure`

yes, but sourcing `sage-env-config` exports variables, and thus has effect on the environment, no?

Yes, eliminating these (unneeded) environment settings is the point of this ticket.
