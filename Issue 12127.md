Keywords: Jmol, 3D, notebook

This ticket provides the following advanced interactive features to Jmol in the notebook:

1. Initial display is a static image created by Tachyon (This means all browsers and devices will at least be able to see a 3-D image)
2. The live applet can be loaded by clicking on a "Make Interactive..." button.
3. Colors can be changed without recalculating
4. spin on checkbox
5. high quality checkbox
6. Meshes can be displayed without recalculating
7. Transparency can be adjusted without recalculating
8. Applet size can be adjusted
9. Applet can be displayed in its own window
10. Can download a file that the Jmol application can open to recreate the exact view shown on the web page.  This allows for more sophisticated manipulation and the semi-automatic creation of web pages that include this live 3-D image.
11. Solves memory problems associated with opening too many Jmols at once, by automatically putting Jmols that are not being used to sleep.

Two patches are necessary:

A patch to plot3d in Sage:

A patch to a number of files in sagenb:

The second patch is very big, but I think it is best to do it as a patch to make sure that I haven't somehow rebased against the wrong versions of the files.

I've tried these patches on top 5.0.beta6 and #11080. I believe the patch to jmol_lib.js in [trac_12299_adv_jmol_nb.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/12299/trac_12299_adv_jmol_nb.patch) appears twice. If I delete the first occurrence everything applies and the png images generated by Tachyon appear in the notebook. If I click the "Make Interactive" button then the 3-D jmol images appear. I noticed that the first image to always appear, even if a cell is reevaluated, is the png generated image. "Make Interactive" must be clicked to get the jmol image.

If you are running locally you should see the JmolData application launch to generate the static image.  So I think that answers my question about your test environment (local with a JVM available, right?).  What browser are you running and did you run the notebook in secure mode?

This is odd.  I only see one patch in the file...I'll check it again.  I also don't understand how you can get multiple patches if you only make one commit.  Is something finicky about hg within sage?

I will work on the doctest.  That's not a big deal.  Thanks for pointing it out.  I missed that one.

Okay, I will still have to look at what happens if "old" Jmols live in a directory, but at least it does, in fact, work.  

I have to say that it is already, even after limited testing:
* Really cool to be able to do the mesh, color, spin, everything from that advanced screen immediately - I don't think three.js will do all that right away.  I remember this from testing last summer, too, but it's still nice it still works.  And the extra features of the right-click menu - setting x, y, z spin separately?  Nice.
* Really *annoying* that even the very first Jmol on a worksheet, even a new one I create on a new worksheet (!) has the clunky "make active" thing which takes ages.  We have to wait a while for 3D graphics anyway; let's not make it longer.  Is there *any* way to make at least the first Jmol detected be a real Jmol, or is that a pipe dream?

Other minor things noticed thus far: 
* If you resize the applet using the right-click menu (say, to 200%) then the advanced menu on the right does not resize with it, which can lead to things being not very visible.  Also makes it very hard to find the right-click menu.

These are the steps you can follow:
1. If you don't have a fork of the [sagemath/sagenb](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb) github, then go to this page and click on "fork" on the top right. This will create a fork of this git repository inside your account.

3. Next, make the changes to the files you want (for instance you may apply your patch manually) and then commit your changes using

```
git add <filenames> # In case you have introduced new files
git commit -a -m "commit message"

5. Finally go to your github page and click on "Pull Request" on the top. This will create the pull request to sagemath/sagenb repository.

You can commit and push changes to the github page and the pull request will be updated automatically with your new changes. Because of this feature you can also decide to create a separate git branch and put a pull request only from that branch, so that other changes that you are working on don't get affected or included in the pull request.

I believe the sphere is a sphere object, which is not a surface defined by a bunch of vertices and triangles, thus there is no mesh to display.  If Sage were to calculate it as a pmesh surface rather than use the Jmol builtin, then there would be a mesh.

You were right, it was the Jmol placeholder.  I really find that annoying.

> * Nothing else worked - lots of messages about restarting Jmol and so forth. At one point I even got a JmolData java applet starting outside the browser window.

I had the same problems on the same worksheet.  This worksheet had only five Jmols, but took a million years to load (well, over a minute) and then I get the following.

```
Jmol Applet #0 is having trouble loading.  Will retry once.

Second attempt to finish launch of Jmol Applet #0 failed.  Recommend reevaluating the cell manually.
```

Same for all Jmols.  Some didn't even make the static images.  Even re-evaluating doesn't help at all - it does create the image, but as soon as I make it "live" I get the same horrible messages.

Note that in the new worksheet, I am just fine, and the little Jmol logo shows up properly in the upper left corner - not ever in this old worksheet, or only with the briefest of appearances.  Notice that in old **interacts** everything works fine, presumably because these are indeed newly generated!

----

Question about implementation.  How much work does Jmol have to do to generate all those static images **every** time that one opens a worksheet?  In theory, once there is an image (png, I guess) generated, it should just stay in the cell's folder and be displayed; we certainly don't want to create a new one each time, any more than we do this for 2D plots.  Though even with a largish sheet it doesn't seem to take super long, a little delay.

Have you tried using this on "old" worksheets with Jmols?  This seems to be the problem I have, consistently; any Jmols from the old notebook (by which old Jmol is presumably meant) don't work.

More minor issues.
* When I sleep an image, it doesn't come back with the advanced controls if I had them up.  Is there any way to "save" that state, or is it too hard?

* When doing 

```
implicit_plot3d(x^2+y^2+z^2==16,(x,-5,5),(y,-5,5),(z,-5,5),color='green',plot_points=200)
```

   I got

```
viewer handling error condition: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
```

   Maybe I'm being overoptimistic; the docs don't even have any with 100 `plot_points`.
* On the plus side, the thing where only four Jmols are active at a time is working fine.  I notice that it deactivates the one furthest down or something, not the oldest one.

I have to say that I'm by far the most concerned about the "old worksheets" issue.  Second is the "automatically every image is static" - couldn't at least the *first* one be "live"? - but nearly everything else could be considered an enhancement request.

Jmol only generates the image when a cell is evaluated.  When you open a worksheet that was previously evaluated using these enhancements the images are already there.

Right, and I assume that passing it new info would be a pretty sizable change in how we use it.

Now that I understand the technical issue better, I guess I would agree in some sense, but I figure it's buyer beware on the `@`interact cells.  Having to do an extra click every time would get really old really fast with them.  Maybe we could ask on sage-devel about the tradeoff, though perhaps (as usual with polls on sage-devel) we wouldn't get many takers...

We definitely need to fix this.  Again, I even had trouble with some worksheets even after re-evaluation.

It should be pretty easy for you to test this.  Just open an old Sage, make a new worksheet with Jmols, close it, stop Sage, restart your new Jmol Sage, and see what happens.   I figure you have more diagnostic tools than I will.

> Jmol only generates the image when a cell is evaluated.  When you open a worksheet that was previously evaluated using these enhancements the images are already there.
Great.

> The application can certainly handle more.  I'll see if I can change the memory allocation to allow for larger images...That is a little odd as we use Jmol in web pages to look at things with many more points, atoms and surfaces...

No, it's 100 points *per axis*, so one million points are evaluated and the presumably however many of them are on the sphere must be plotted.  I think that's why we don't even have it in the docs, because it would take a long time.  But it does seem to work in the old Jmol in Sage (just tried it in vanilla 5.0).

Definitely not 3.  1 also seems less than desirable unless it was only when there had been a Jmol before, and one could reliably detect it was from an earlier version of Jmol.  How would 2 work?

The major issue I am worried about is reliability of the applets when an unsigned applet is used in a secure environment.  Browsers and Java are getting much more finicky about mixed modes.  I've seen some cases where the applet will not launch under https if it is not signed.  I need to know whether this is enough of a problem to spend some time on.

In the past you had done some pretty extensive testing.   I figure we should at least test on Safari, FF, Chrome on Mac, FF and Chrome on Linux, IE and FF on Windows.  I don't know how easy that will be for me unless you set up a remote server again, which I figure would be quite a pain.

Is the test server you link to with `secure=True` or `False`?  I guess since it's http, not https, it's `False`?

I uploaded it to the test server first.  I tried to share it with you, but maybe you didn't have an account on it.  I'll email it as well.  It doesn't work right there, either.

By the way, I got

```
Jmol Applet #0 is having trouble loading.  Will retry once.
```

on the test server for a new worksheet, but then it eventually did come up fine and so forth.

Remind me why we aren't loading the "High Quality" view right away?  I'm sure there's a good reason, but it just looks so much nicer that I'm surprised we don't just use it by default.

Different note.  It's possible to mess things up (empty Jmol areas, unable to load messages, dying areas) by clicking to wake up applets really quickly, six or seven in a row.  I don't think that's really a regression, because before they would have just been awake and taking up memory, but at any rate I wanted to let you know.  This is on FF on Mac, the worst-case scenario (though it does work despite the nasty-sounding warning message I get!).

On Chrome on Mac, no problems.

Did you at least get the warning that things were not likely to work?  It should have read something like:
"Many of the advanced 3-D viewing functions DO NOT work in Internet Explorer..."
Or are things failing before then?

Update: gutow discovered this was due to a weird Geogebra applet embedding attempt left in that particular worksheet that for some reason was causing the trouble.

Also, based on the sage-devel discussion, sounds like people are ok with not having immediate interaction, and obviously Jonathan is worry about overlapping requests to Jmol.  I'm still not sure this is advisable, but be it on their heads.

I'd still ask for some reorganization of the menus but that is probably for another ticket, given the current state of the applet in 5.0 being much more difficult to follow than this new one, which only needs tweaking.

At least some people are reporting success on FF on Linux.  Apparently some Opera has trouble there.  But maybe Linux is okay, then, at least many of them.

What remains to look at:

 You're right, it's failing before that.

I've been able to reproduce the "signed/unsigned" applet issue under comment:41 and comment:42  on ubuntu 12.04. I don't ususally use ubuntu but had access to an installation.

I can reproduce this on Mac OS with Safari.

```
could not find applet jmolApplet1
```

After that once in a while I was able to get one to show up interactive, but most just have

```
Loading Jmol 3-D viewer...
```

where the applet would be, and then of course eventually, as it's Safari,

```
More than 9 Jmols have been launched on the worksheet since it was last openned. Unable to get a static image from Jmol#1 You might want to try Chrome as this problem does not exist with Chrome on MacOS.

Thank you now I've got it...This may take a bit to fix.  It appears to be a discrepancy between the server and javascript applet numbers.  There are many places where the update could be getting messed up.  At least I know what to look for now.  And  you are correct, this should have nothing to do with whether the applets are signed or not.

The last command was just for me to check that the author/date/etc. looked correct, as well as the number of lines added/removed and number of files changed. There was a minor discrepancy in the larger patch, but it looks like it was just an instance of trailing whitespace being added which disappeared when git fixed the whitespace changes.

I've been messing with the "high quality" issue.  So, it does look enough better that it's hard not to want it, especially since memory should not be an issue at this point.  I do see the speckles with the mesh on.  However, they only appear with the mesh, and only with the *black* mesh - I can't get it with any other mesh, not even the darker grays.

Maybe we could keep the high-quality if the mesh defaults to one of those colors?  Or is there an "xor" we could set, not allowed to use high quality and mesh at the same time if the color is so and so?  That seems to be a little limiting, though.

The black mesh speckles have their value too - we could hypnotize people at the Joint Meetings booths...

And I concur with kini. I always see yellow warning signs on right click menu (and the right click menu is slow too). But that is also with the current jmol in sage-5 (in opera/firefox), so I didn't think much about it. I almost never need to use the right click with jmol anyway.

Yup, this happens to everybody!  Great, though - I would have been surprised had this been different.

> Decided to keep JmolData specific error as may need it for movie generation.

Sorry, still 'needs work'.  *Every* method needs doctesting.  In particular, the JmolDataError needs a docstring and test in its `__init__` and `__str__` methods.  I'm really sorry this is so annoying.  For the init, just print `self.value` or something; you can also put `# indirect doctest` as a comment after the test (not the result) for the ones that don't use the actual name of the method.

Also, you'll need to change things like

```
EXAMPLES:: 
Create a JmolData object 
:: 
    sage: from sage.interfaces.jmoldata import JmolData 
```

should look like

```
EXAMPLES:

Create a JmolData object:: 

    sage: from sage.interfaces.jmoldata import JmolData 
```

Note the single colon except directly before the doctest, and the blank line before the actual test.

Will increasing the Jmol memory cause problems?   I don't have time to do any more Jmol testing right now, how much more memory are we talking, where does it live?

Okay, I've created a reviewer patch.  Now I know the formatting is right because I added this to the reference manual and looked.

I also made some linebreaks earlier, made one set of tests optional because they require the internet (I've checked this), and made the file temporary that wasn't before.

So in theory, this should be wonderful.  Only now I've horribly broken something, because these files in the `os.path.exists` tests no longer exist and those tests fail!  I have precisely zero explanation; every time I made them live in the current directory, like just `DNA.png`, it worked, every time I put them someplace else it didn't.

What's particularly odd about this is that the other test which imports `SAGE_TMP` used to pass, and then started failing.  For no discernible reason.  So I'm wondering if I just destroyed something else on my computer (how, I don't know - I've just been working on this patch).

So 'needs review' still.  I really am stumped, as this should be completely done now, but isn't.

On the plus side, it looks like people like the functionality!

Your problem is in line 163.  I ran into this when I was writing the test code.  You have too many layers of escaping on the endofline.  This is why I used the form:

```
sage: script = 'set defaultdirectory "'+archive_name+'"\n script SCRIPT\n' 
```

rather than the

```
sage: script = 'set defaultdirectory "%s"\\n script SCRIPT\\n'%archive_name
```

you used. Alternatively, your code works if you change it to:

```
sage: script = 'set defaultdirectory "%s"\n script SCRIPT\n'%archive_name
```

Thanks for reporting this.  I cannot reproduce this error once I fix the double backslash issue in the tests.  However, it suggests I should to be more careful about how I specify the memory allocation for the JVM.  I will set a maximum, rather than a minimum.

Incidentally, John's patch looks good, especially since sometimes `DOT_SAGE` is indeed set differently.

Jonathan, what would you say still needs review?    The user interface piece certainly seems to be in good shape, based on strogdon, ppurka, and my testing.

I guess once this is ready we'd need an updated pull request; kini has graciously offered to do this, I think.

Duh.  You wouldn't believe how many variants of `r` in the actual set default directory script I tried; that the issue was the entire docstring somehow didn't occur to me. Thank you very much.

There is still

```
Image file , .png, .gif or .jpg (default .png) 
```

but removing the space or the comma or anything now *really* seems too trivial to deal with.

Sorry, kini, I didn't realize that the only remaining updates were on the sage library end.

Well, I don't know how much is really left to review here.  gutow, let us know what you think might not have been looked at carefully enough.

I like the Sage library patch.  We've certainly tested all of it a fair amount as well.

I don't have access to a computer without JVM, I guess, so maybe someone should make sure the error message really appears in the notebook and is friendly?

The tests now behave properly again.

Line [2416](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/64/files#L2R2416) could use an `os.path.join`, I guess, but that's probably not crucial.

This is not really a Java security error.  It appears that something happened to the code allowing Jmol to launch without a GUI (aka windowserver).  Looking at the patches it appears that somewhere along the line the necessary option in the Java launch command got lost.  I will put up a patch as soon as I double check the syntax.

Good catch!

The first  is the expected error on machines without JVMs installed.  I had trouble writing doctests for this because of the multiple possible outcomes.  Could we rewrite the doctests to output something like: "JVM was/was not detected, thus an image was/was not generated?"  If I understand the doctest mechanism correctly it is flexible enough to check for just the "JVM was..." part, right?  Then it could produce some other text if the JVM was found, but image generation failed.  This last case would be the only failure mode.  Would that be better?

I have access to this very, very old redhat machine for which:

```
[strogdon@bwulf sage-5.2.beta0]$ java -version

and when I run the testsuite the only failing test is

```
sage -t -long -force_lib "devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/jmoldata.py"

So I think you've answered my question.  The failures occurred on arando (no java, failure expected) and rosmary (Java 1.4.2), so I need to test for java >=1.5.  Testing for this will require changes to the Jmol spkg.  Could we make that another ticket?  I don't think it will take me very long, but I don't want to hold things up or have to start the review process for this ticket again.

It seems the java tests depend on running an external script "testjava.sh". I believe what's done in that script can be moved into jmoldata.py by locating the system bash:

```
sage: from twisted.python.procutils import which
sage: which("bash")[0]
'/bin/bash'
```

John Palmieri told me that the testjava.sh shell script is one of the holdups, and it's not working properly for me on a machine with no Java installed.

The doctest uses `subprocess.call`, which returns the return code of the executed program. But `testjava.sh` isn't exiting with useful return codes. Should the script look like this?

```/usr/bin/env bash

# is Java even installed?
type -atp java
if [ $? -gt 0 ]
then
    echo Java does not appear to be installed. Exiting.
    exit 1
fi

# we support versions 1.5 to 1.7
java -version 2>&1 | grep -q version.*[1]\.[567]
if [ $? -gt 0 ]
then
    echo You do not have a supported version of Java. Exiting.
    exit 1
fi

echo Java is available and is a supported version.
```

Then it gives informative error messages and exits with the proper exit codes.

I think the shell script with the added version checking and the typo related to patch level of previous versions of the spkg in SPKG.txt were the last issues.

The `#!/usr/bin/env bash` syntax is [recommended for portability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)#Portability).

As for the bash script, are you looking at the output of the bash script or only at the return status. In the former case, you probably want to echo back only the $OUT. In this case, the script can be shortened significantly

```/usr/bin/env bash
type -atp java > /dev/null && java -version 2>&1 | grep version.*[1]\.[567] > /dev/null
echo $?
```


EDIT: Sorry, sage doesn't ship bash. I was recalling something incorrectly (mixed it up with bzip2).

There's a doctest in sage/interfaces/jmoldata.py (line 90) that looks like this:

```
result = subprocess.call([testjavapath],stdout=jout)
```

[The documentation for subprocess.call](http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.call) says it returns the returncode attribute, but the current script AFAICT always returns 0. I think we should be using `check_output` if we want the output.  We can do either thing, but it seems like right now the script and the doctest are not consistent.

That's certainly an option, but perhaps the verbose-but-obvious script would be easier to maintain, in case someone who's not much of a bash expert needs to change it. :)

Then my version will *always* have a return code of 0. This is why I asked the question. So we have the following choices:

1. For python based solution: the python method in comment:173 looks good.

2. For bash based solution: the simple bash version in the case you use `subprocess.call` is below. This will have the proper **return code** of 0 or 1, depending on whether java is present and is version `1.[5-7]` or otherwise.

```/usr/bin/env bash
type -atp java  && java -version 2>&1 | grep version.*[1]\.[567]
exit $?
```


3. A slightly more verbose bash version (again assuming you are using `subprocess.call`)

```/usr/bin/env bash
type -atp java || exit 1  # exit if java is not found
java -version 2>&1 | grep version.*[1]\.[567]
exit $?
```


4. Even more verbose bash script (assuming usage of `subprocess.call`) - the one in comment:166

The bash script currently shipped in the spkg does not return the correct exit codes.

Yes it does.  It does not send them to the standard output, but it does return the correct values to the $? variable that `subprocess.call` gets the result value from.

On a machine with a different java or no java you will see

```
>./testjava.sh
>echo $?
1
```

 
If you don't have a machine without java you can check it by changing the grep statement to

```
grep version.*[1]\.[2]
```


Then run the script again.  You will find an exit code of 1.

I verified this on Ubuntu and MacOS.

Well, the behavior I am getting on Linux is different (and what I expected). Let me first ensure that we are talking about the same script - `jmol-12.3.27.p1/patches/testjava.sh` (removing redundant lines):

```/bin/bash
type -atp java
OUT=$?
if [ $OUT -eq 0 ]; then
  java -version 2>&1|grep version.*[1]\.[567]
fi
```


The problem is that if the `type` statement exits with a nonzero status, then `OUT` will be nonzero. The `if` statement will not execute and hence it will never reach the grep statement so as to give a nonzero return status. This can be checked by changing the line `type -atp java` with `type -atp not_present_command`. I get the following behavior

```
...z/jmol-12.3.27.p1/patches» bash -x ./testjava.sh
