Since you are going to do the category imports in the `__init__` (which I'm not 100% in agreement with), I would make it in as small as scope as possible:

```diff
         from sage.categories.rings import Rings
         from sage.categories.integral_domains import IntegralDomains
         from sage.categories.fields import Fields
-        from sage.categories.complete_discrete_valuation import (
-                CompleteDiscreteValuationRings, CompleteDiscreteValuationFields)
 
         base_ring = power_series.base_ring()
         if base_ring in Fields():
+            from sage.categories.complete_discrete_valuation import CompleteDiscreteValuationFields
             category = CompleteDiscreteValuationFields()
         elif base_ring in IntegralDomains():
             category = IntegralDomains()
         elif base_ring in Rings().Commutative():
             category = Rings().Commutative()
         else:
             raise ValueError('unrecognized base ring')
```

Also, don't we want to use `names=power_series.variable_names()` in case we (eventually support) have multiple variable names. Otherwise LGTM.
