It's in my todo list since several months now... but I don't know how to do that.

We should also expose other algorithms from this library (heuristics, cuset, etc.). I plan to move the treewidth method into a new `tree_decomposition.pyx` file and add an exact algorithm for treelength (I have one). But one step at a time.

I opened https://github.com/freetdi/tdlib/issues/34

it principle, all the C++ headers as in the current package are still there, whether they are compatible is another question. I asked the upstream to make a release.
