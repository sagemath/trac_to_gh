Keywords: finite word, defect, palindrome, pseudopalindrome

Update defect() method of a finite word to calculate the defect for generalized palindromes.

Details: the defect is the difference between the maximum number of palindromic factors in a word and their actual count. If we count generalized palindromes (or f-palindromes, theta-palindromes, pseudopalindromes...), the upper bound needs to be corrected according to [1].

Hello,

**1) About documentation**

I think you should consider two parts in the documentation. The first paragraph should describe the function with the argument set to None (which is the general behavior that a user would like). And another one for the generalized version. (I made a proposition in the patch)

I also rewrite the examples in order to include a theorem and a conjecture.

You should add references to (see the "NEED REFERENCE")
* the fact that the maximal number of palindromic factors in a word is the length of the word +1
* the fact that Sturmian words are full of palindrome
* the conjecture about defect 0 or infinity for Sturmian words

**2) About the algorithm**

I change the construction of the "real" alphabet of the word. You used w.factor_set(1) which need the computation of the suffix_trie. I suggest set(w). I rewrite the function, I find it better that way. I hope you agree. (see in the patch)

**3) TODO**

It could be very nice to have a function which returns the "defects of prefixes". In other word, in one call I would like to be able to get the following:

```
sage: w=words.ThueMorseWord()[:20]
sage: [w[:i].defect() for i in xrange(20)]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
```

Hi,

thanks a lot for the review.

**1.** Ok, thanks. I gladly accept. I made a few modifications to you proposition, added the references and some more examples.

**2.** Nice python/sage magic, I wasn't able to get it working that way. Thank you.

**3.** Nice suggestion. In fact, this would be the output of a different (and mainly faster) algorithm to calculate the defect. I am planning on doing in for the defected generalized to more symmetries at a time. I will open a ticket for that.

Hi,

Extending the definition of full for f-palindromes is a good question. That is the reason why I left it coded that way. Now that Stepan studied the question in a paper, I agree to adapt the definition in Sage as what Stepan suggests. On two letters a and b, am I right to say that abababab... and babababab... are the only two words that are E-full where E is the exchange of a and b?

> **3) TODO**

> It could be very nice to have a function which returns the "defects of prefixes". In other word, in one call I would like to be able to get the following:
> {{{
> sage: w=words.ThueMorseWord()[:20]
> sage: [w[:i].defect() for i in xrange(20)]
> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
> }}}

This is already done by the method lacunas (from which you can regenerate the above list of repeated numbers). A lacuna is a position where there are no new palindrome finishing there or equivalently, the defect goes up by one. Here are some examples from the doctests :


```
sage: w = Word([0,1,1,2,3,4,5,1,13,3])                              
sage: w.lacunas()                                                   
[7, 9]                                                              
sage: words.ThueMorseWord()[:100].lacunas()                         
[8, 9, 24, 25, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 96, 97, 98, 99]      
sage: f = WordMorphism({0:[1],1:[0]})                               
sage: words.ThueMorseWord()[:50].lacunas(f)
[0, 2, 4, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 48, 49]
```


By merging both patches, Stepan becomes author of what Vincent did. Usually, we keep both patches separated. Anyway, which patche(s) should be reviewed? the last one only? Right now, the patchbot tries to apply all of them which fails...

Hi SÃ©bastien,

thanks for the comment.

>  On two letters a and b, am I right to say that abababab... and babababab... are the only two words that are E-full where E is the exchange of a and b?

Yes. To have finite defect implies some other properties, for instance, there have to be overlaps at some point (in the infinite word).
