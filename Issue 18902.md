Keywords: crystals, KR

The aim of this ticket is to implement a category for KR crystals and their tensor products. We do so by implementing a category for (abstract) U<sub>q</sub>'(*g*)-crystals, which I have called `AffineDerivedSubaglebraCrystals`. Tthere will be a regular affine derived subalgebra crystals subcategory, and from that, the subcategories with be KR crystals and their tensor products (which do not have a subcategory relationship).

This allows for a uniform interface for all KR crystals, allowing us to define things like `energy_function` for only tensor products of KR crystals where we don't have to check types. This also makes the default weight lattice for general crystals of affine type be the extended affine weight lattice, but anything in the affine derived subalgebra category will use the non-extended weight lattice. As a consequence, it removes duplication of trivial `weight_lattice_realization` methods. This category also allows a better interface which to draw 0-arrows in reverse for digraphs.

I'm not completely set on the name "affine derived subalgebra crystals", but it was the best I could come up with to stay as general as possible. I didn't want to do "* derived crystals" because derived has special meaning in terms of category theory, and nothing else I came up with kept the generality I wanted. Suggestions welcomed.

Was there ever any opposition to the name "affine derived subalgebra crystals" that didn't make it to the discussion here?  If so, is there a better suggestion for naming these objects?

The other thought I had was "Weyl crystals," thinking of them as being crystals associated to (local) Weyl modules, but that would be more for tensor products of KR crystals. Although in that direction, what about "loop crystals," in reference to the loop algebra? Another name that comes to mind is "(affine?) prime crystals" (although that is more tongue-in-cheek).

"Weyl crystals" probably isn't a good idea.  If tongue-in-cheek suggestions are in play, then how about "AffiniteCrystals"?!

First, the documentation does not build.

Second, I merged beta5, removed a typo introduced in `monomial_crystals.py`, and added `loop_crystals` to the `src/doc/en/reference/categories/index.rst`.

Some comments/questions:

- In `affinization.py`, there is a `#TODO` which suggests that the `digraph` method should be removed when this category gets implemented.  Probably either that `#TODO` or the method should be deleted?

- While not added on this ticket, there is a reference to "pg. 48 of Kac" under the `affine_weight` method in `KR_type_E6`.  That reference should be explicit, and why not fix it now?

I'll read through the html documentation of `LoopCrystals` after it's been added to rst file.

Fixed. There was an extra space. I also merged in the latest #22429.

Thank you.

Good point; it was there to get rid of the up arrows. Done.

Done.

There were some documentation errors which caused the docbuild to fail.  These are now fixed with the last push.  

Now all tests passed and both HTML and PDF documentation build.  I read through the documentation, and it looks good.  In particular, it doesn't look like any doctests were lost in the conversion to this ticket.  

Some more comments/questions regarding `loop_crystals.py`:

- Should ":meth:`module_generator()`" result in a hyperlink in the R-matrix documentation?

- Why are the subscripts missing from ":meth:`local energy function <...>`"?  Should this be ":meth:`local_energy_function <...>`"?

- `#TODO: Implement a version of tensor products for KR crystals.` remains in the documentation.  Should this now be removed?

Thank you.

A better link would be to `:meth:`maximal_vector``; changed.

> - Why are the subscripts missing from ":meth:`local energy function <...>`"?  Should this be ":meth:`local_energy_function <...>`"?

Because the stuff not in `<...>` is what is actually displayed (which could be anything). For comparison, if you have `:meth:`foo <bar>``, it is like the html `<a href="bar">foo</a>`.

> - `#TODO: Implement a version of tensor products for KR crystals.` remains in the documentation.  Should this now be removed?

No, because the method is currently only implemented for non-tensor products.

In other places, they usually just do `:meth:`~foo.bar``, which shortens the output to `bar`. However, there is no standard AFAIK, but I think this looks a little better.
