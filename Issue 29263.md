Would that be `gambit`, `numpy` and `pillow`?

And is this how to find them?

```
$ git grep "setup.py" build/pkgs
```

I did this to emphasize the analogy to `sage-pip-install`.

> - This function should be documented in `developer/packaging.rst`.

Good idea, will do.

> - Does `sage-pip-uninstall` leave the old wheels lying around?

`sage-pip-uninstall` is not really used for regular uninstalls. Rather, it "force-uninstalls" previously installed versions - in case the site-packages directory was somehow messed up. (This code was previously part of `sage-pip-install`.)

The wheels are installed with the staging mechanism (DESTDIR), which records the installed files. In this way, the `-clean` targets etc. automatically install the wheel.

> - Typo in `sage-pip-uninstall` (copied from `sage-pip-install`): "this command hould use"

Thanks
