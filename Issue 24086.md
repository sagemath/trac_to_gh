I can set to a positive review if you agree with my documentation changes.

Resetting due to accidental push to the wrong branch.

There was a failing doctest that somehow we didn't catch. Fixed; please re-review.

Double-checked the doctest; checked corner cases, and double-checked that options no longer defined for `PartitionAlgebra`, etc.
All looks good.
