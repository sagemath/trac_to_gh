The "Automatically re-publish when changes are made" feature does not work in flask notebook.

This is not quite correct.  They do show up, but one has to save the worksheet first (not necessarily quit).  Maybe we could just add some verbiage making this clear in the instructions 

```
Automatically re-publish when changes are made (after saving)
```

Pong, if you see this, let me know if you think this is an acceptable compromise.

Proposing to close all sagenb tickets as outdated, so that all remaining open tickets in the notebook component are about the Jupyter notebook.
