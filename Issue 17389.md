# Issue 17389: inherite Group from Monoid

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2015-01-12 17:34:30

The class `Group` in sage.groups.group is inherited from `Parent` but not from `Monoid` since no "nice" monoid-class exists. There is only `Monoid_class` which seems to be very simplified.

The aim of this ticket is to create a class `Monoid` and use it as a base-class for `Group`.

in c51a914 the importing of `Monoid` in group.pyx fails (`sage -t`) with

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'all'
```

Need help... :)
