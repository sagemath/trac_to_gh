# Issue 12253: Twisted uses non-standard C generated by old Pyrex

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2012-02-04 12:46:53

Assignee: tbd

The file `twisted/internet/cfsupport/cfsupport.c` is generated by an old version of Pyrex and contains non-standard C.  Re-generating this file with Pyrex 0.9.4 solves the problem.

We also add a fix for #12422 (add '-Dformat_arg(x)=' to `CFLAGS`).

#11874 might also fix this.

Indeed, that file doesn't appear in Twisted 11.1, so it appears that #11874 might fix this.

Good.  The main motivation for this ticket is #12369, so I don't really care _how_ it gets fixed.
