The file `twisted/internet/cfsupport/cfsupport.c` is generated by an old version of Pyrex and contains non-standard C.  Re-generating this file with Pyrex 0.9.4 solves the problem.

We also add a fix for #12422 (add '-Dformat_arg(x)=' to `CFLAGS`).

#11874 might also fix this.

Indeed, that file doesn't appear in Twisted 11.1, so it appears that #11874 might fix this.

Good.  The main motivation for this ticket is #12369, so I don't really care *how* it gets fixed.
