Here is an initial rebase over the recent changes. I had the manually add stuff in because the backporting was removing stuff from this branch, so it didn't actually add the code under a `git merge`. However, I believe I got everything.

There are a number of doctests that are failing, as well as additional work to bring it fully in line with the other tickets. Likely nearly all of the failures are related to a single issue as they all have error messages of the form:

```
TypeError: Could not find a mapping of the passed element to this ring.
```

However, I have yet to investigate.

Same here. `:)`

I have added this and fixed up other failing doctests.

I recall it was very specific with the `series()` implementation when it was passed in a `coefficient` function. I don't remember anything about `__call__` having a (potential) memleak, but I might be forgetting something. (I think we can use `R.zero()` instead of `R(0)` though.) Perhaps I wanted to use the underlying stream to build the new stream instead of the element class?

They are attributes that are fairly self-documented and an implementation detail. So I don't feel the need to put much more in, especially in the public documentation. If you want to add a (code) comment, feel free to do so.

> * it might be good to have an overview somewhere, describing which gems we have created!

I agree that having a nice (thematic?) tutorial will be good. Although we can do it on a separate ticket.

2. Pyflakes fixes (see, e.g., patchbot).

We currently distinguish between fully lazy and "exact" objects (where the underlying stream is eventually constant).

The advantage of keeping track of "exact" objects is, that we can test for zero in some cases, and possibly speed.

However, some operations on "exact" objects which in principle would produce "exact" objects again, such as multiplication in the Dirichlet ring, may produce objects of very large degree.  In such a case the full computation would be very time-consuming, so we switched it off, see `LazyDirichletSeries._mul_`.

Would it be feasible, and make sense, to introduce another class in the hierarchy of streams, which only asserts that the stream is eventually constant (possibly keeping track of the degree from which this must be the case), but does not perform the computations?

I am not sure how much performance we gain in the "exact" case in practice.  It is a fair bit of code.  (in `lazy_series.py`, we check 35 times `isinstance(*, Stream_exact)`.  If the performance gain is not important, maybe it would be even better to only keep track of the degree.

There is a difference between an element of a different ring and an element of the lazy ring, which is *independent* of the internal implementation details of the lazy ring elements. The issue at hand is about how to handle elements in a different ring converting to coercing in. I just want to make sure you are not accidentally mixing the two issues.

I strongly believe we should keep the special cases for when it is exact. I agree that Dirichlet series is a special case because of the product structure. Even if (and that is a huge if) we agree to not support true exact arithmetic when possible, I don't think you are proposing will reduce much of the code because you still want to check the cases when we know it is exact (e.g., checking if an element is `0` or not). We could add support for this in `Stream_dirichlet_convolve`, but that should be a followup ticket.

Here is also a small demo of the speed improvements:

```
sage: R.<z> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: f = R(lambda n: 1 if n < 3 else 0, valuation=0)
sage: f  # this caches the values
1 + z + z^2 + O(z^7)
sage: g = 1 + z + z^2
sage: %timeit (f * f)[0:5]
16.7 µs ± 66.6 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)
sage: %timeit (g * g)[0:5]
14.1 µs ± 88.2 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)

sage: f = R(lambda n: 1 if n < 6 else 0, valuation=0)
sage: f
1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 + z^5 + O(z^7)
sage: g = 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 + z^5
sage: %timeit (f * f)[0:11]
52.5 µs ± 244 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)
sage: %timeit (g * g)[0:11]
32.1 µs ± 411 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)
```

Of course, the non-exact computation could likely be made faster, but I doubt in a way that could compare to the exact one.

It is correct. Note also that `__pow__()` calls `generic_power()` calls `__invert__()`, which we can see by

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: S = LazySymmetricFunctions(s)
sage: elt = 1 + S(s[2])
sage: f = elt^-1
sage: type(f._coeff_stream)
<class 'sage.data_structures.stream.Stream_cauchy_invert'>

sage: f = 1 / elt
sage: type(f._coeff_stream)

In the Frobenius character of unlabeled trees test, I need to explicitly declare the `valuation = 1` when I add in a test for composing that the valuation is positive.

The bug is in `LazyTaylorSeries.__call__`:

```
    def __call__(self, *g):
    ...
        coeff_stream = Stream_function(coefficient, R, P._sparse, 0)
        return P.element_class(P, coeff_stream)
```

It is not good enough to set the valuation to 0 here.

That should not really be necessary, because the valuation of `X*E(A)` (in fact, of `X*anything`)  is positive.

There were actually a lot of issues with `LazyTaylorSeries.__call__` with handling different inputs to make it (mostly?) compatible with the lazy Laurent series. So most of the code added there is to handle when `f` is an infinite series but `g` is finite. I added more examples for compositions.

A principle of Sage is that the result of `__call__` should not depend on the elements, only the parents. Of course, we deliberately break this (infinite versus finite series), but it is mostly consistent now I believe.

I implemented an `is_exact` because it is not an exact ring when the base ring is not exact.

Added alias `plethysm = __call__`.

I moved the plethysm code into `Stream_plethysm`. I also made it smarter with only computing the terms in the necessary degrees. I couldn't do anything smarter than going through the power sums either.

Thank you so much!

Indeed, there is work that can likely be done. I wonder how much of it is because it is done in Python versus some of the other safety checks we do on objects versus actual implementation/algorithm. Seems that we are roughly 5x slower in this example.

My 2 cents of a wild guess where we can improve is in the composition. Perhaps we would be better squaring things to reduce the number of multiplications.

I don't think that FriCAS does anything extraordinarily intelligent.  It's just that the FriCAS language is much more efficient than python.

Frédéric, while I appreciate what you have done standardizing the code within Sage and trying to keep it consistent, I don't think this should warrant reverting a positive review for adding one blankline that, IMO, makes the code less readable because it disassociates the internal function definition from the use. Nevertheless, I have made the change requested.

oops, sorry for the inconvenience, apologies

I understand your point of view ; maybe we are going too far with the linter and should be more careful in choosing what to check.

My point is that the linter is going to be useful if and only if every single ticket makes sure not to break it again and again.
