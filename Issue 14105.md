See [comment:ticket:14265:26] ff.

(Previously, e.g. in Sage 5.2, and probably later releases as well, this didn't cause any problems.)

I've so far only seen this on Solaris SPARC (with GCC 4.7.0), presumably just because it's the only configuration where Python currently fails to build `_ctypes` (which in my case is a Python bug, to be fixed on another ticket).
