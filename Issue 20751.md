# Issue 20751: Minor fixes to spkg-install for scipy

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2016-07-08 13:51:51

Keywords: scipy

These are some fixes I made while getting scipy built in Cygwin.

The first fix is more important since without it build outright fails (but only, as far as I can tell, with `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`).

Wow, this is an old one. Part of this was already fixed in #22324.  I need to check whether the other fix in this ticket is really needed or not.

As far as I can tell there's nothing else needed in this old branch that hasn't already been merged as part of other work.
