As a part of #11731, transfer the code which does the factorization over `CDF` and `RDF` from `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial.factor()` to `CDF._factor_univariate_polynomial()` and `RDF._factor_univariate_polynomial()` respectively.

This will also fix the following bug:

```
sage: R.<x> = CDF[]
sage: (x^2).factor()
AssertionError
```

This patch depends on #13274, which no longer applies to Sage 5.10.rc1.

Converted patch to a Git branch, only trivial merge conflicts and whitespace edits. Looks good, all test pass.
