Usually a vote on sage-devel. The package has been optional long enough that it should be the only requirement.

For info, the only case new packages go straight to standard without vote or questions is when they are new dependency of a standard package.

Thank you for this ticket.
NB: if the vote is favorable we need to remove all the:

```
optional - giacpy_sage
```
in the comments of the doctests in the following files:

```
src/sage/libs/giac.py
src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py
```

NB: the **random** and **long time** comments should stay. 

There is also a flag in the following

```
build/pkgs/giacpy_sage/type
```
but I don't know if the ticket should change it or let the Release Manager do it himself.

I have found 2 doctest failure in sage 9.1.beta3 due to python3. So we also need to upgrade the upstream source to giacpy_sage-0.7.0.

I have started a new public branch with this upstream fix. But let all the optional flags in the sage code. If the vote turn out to be positive we will have to remove them.

I have issues with this going to standard by just flipping the switch. It risks to become a circular dependency madness.

Currently `giacpy_sage` requires sage at build time to figure out the include directory by importing `sage_include_directory` from `sage.env`. That part is not needed and should probably be simplified. If you are installing via `sage -i` the environment should be set correctly for finding the headers. If you are on a distro they also are in reach. Similarly `library_dirs` doesn't need to be set (in fact the current setup is annoying on systems with lib/lib64 split). But sage is needed when compiling the .pyx files as it imports a fair deal of sage bits.

`sage` is needed at runtime and test time.

If `sage` needs the package at runtime or to build the documentation you create a scenario where building sage look like:

1. build sagelib
2. build giacpy_sage
3. optional: test giacpy_sage
4. build sagelib documentation
5. test sagelib

So `giacpy_sage` is inserting itself in the middle of the traditional build cycle. 

`sage_brial` look superficially similar but in its case it can be installed independently of sage so it can go as step 1 (it cannot be tested however). `sage_brial` should in fact be merged into sagelib and I believe merging `giacpy_sage` inside sagelib is the only way to get out what looks like circular dependency in the future.
