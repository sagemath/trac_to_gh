Buckygen has been an optional package since May 2013. It has a minimal footprint: just installs one executable that is quite small and compiles quickly. It is the fastest generator for fullerenes and it is GPLv3.

Nico, making a package standard should be discussed on `sage-devel`. And to be honest, I think your package is much too specialized to be standard.

I somewhat agree with Jeroen, the reason for having a set of standard packages is also that other parts of Sage can build on it. Its certainly interesting in its own way, but its not really interconnected with the rest to always compile it. Though we do have a few standard packages that fit that description, too... (e.g. rubiks). 

On a legal note, standard packages must be at GPLv3+ compatible (including the *or later*). Just GPLv3 is not OK. Its fine for optional packages, though.

Yes, William once said that package was included for historical reasons. Today it probably wouldn't be added as standard package.

Really? `zn_poly` has:

OK, no problem. The package works fine as an optional package. I just thought that this was the 'natural' evulotion. If specialised packages stay optional, then I'm not going to argue with that.

I wanted to close the ticket, but apparently I can't. I have removed the needs_review status in any case.
