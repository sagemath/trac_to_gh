# Issue 25572: sage --info tries to write to SAGE_SPKG_SCRIPTS

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25809

sage --info currently unnecessarily needs write access to SAGE_SPKG_SCRIPTS, which typically will be in a read-only or root owned location for distros. This fixes that by moving the mkdir commands to the appropriate section of the file, after `--info` has exited.

CC'ing fbissey since you'll probably have the same error on gentoo.

On a related note, it might be nice to make the sage installation read-only when doctesting in CI.

Yikes, I didn't even know about `sage --info`.  Yes, this definitely makes more sense.
