sage --info currently unnecessarily needs write access to SAGE_SPKG_SCRIPTS, which typically will be in a read-only or root owned location for distros. This fixes that by moving the mkdir commands to the appropriate section of the file, after `--info` has exited.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25809
