ADD DESCRIPTION
Giving a list of the generators of the group in some algebra, the fox derivative can be computed in that
algebra:


```
sage: F=FreeGroup(3)
sage: a=F([2,1,3,-1,2])
sage: a.fox_derivative(F([1]))
B[x1] - B[x1*x0*x2*x0^-1]
sage: R.<t>=LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: a.fox_derivative(F([1]),[t,t,t])
-t^2 + t
sage: S.<t1,t2,t3>=LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: a.fox_derivative(F([1]),[t1,t2,t3])
-t2*t3 + t2
```

In fact i don't like much the documentation, but i couldn't come out with something better. So, any suggestions?

Can you use the standard docstring markup (http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#docstring-markup-with-rest-and-sphinx) for the INPUT sections? Also, whitespace in the EXAMPLES should follow the usual code style. Apart from that looks fine.

Changing keywords from "" to "days57".

Sorry, i messed with the graph editor, this should fix it.

Please always check if the documentation builds.

I've uploaded a review patch. If you are fine with my changes, please set this ticket to positive_review.

your last commit doesn't pass the doctests. Mainly because `F([])` is not a generator of the free group. Also `tuple((0 for _ in self.ngens()))` fails, since you cannot iterate over a number.

Yeah, I somehow uploaded an unfinished version. Let me fix this quickly.
