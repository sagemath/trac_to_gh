# Issue 25293: maxima library interface creates $HOME/.maxima

Issue created by migration from Trac.

This is a regression since the Maxima upgrade. the `maxima_lib` interface now wants to create the directory `$HOME/.maxima`. Instead, it should use `$DOT_SAGE/maxima` just like the pexpect interface.
