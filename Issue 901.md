To view a hg patch bundle as a text file, you can use the
hg_sage.inspect('patchname.hg') command. This was added to 

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/html/prog/node72.html

The patch is at
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/patches/prog.tex.hg

Though "inspect" seems to work on "source code" patches, it does not 
seem to work on doc patches.
