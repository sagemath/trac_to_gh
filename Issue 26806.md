# Issue 26806: py3: minor sage.geometry.polyhedron.palp_database cleanup

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27043

Original creator: embray

Minor cleanup from my python3 branch.  This module is already working now on Python 3, but I had previously fixed it by passing encoding arguments to `subprocess.Popen` on Python 3.

Also pep8 cleanup and delinting.

Just continuing to try to clean up my python3 branch and get more bits from it upstream.
