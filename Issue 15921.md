# Issue 15921: Make Spec into a functor

Keywords: Spec functor affine scheme

Sage's `Spec` command currently produces a `Spec` object that derives from, but is not the same as, an `AffineScheme`.  The goal of this ticket is
- merge the existing `Spec` with `AffineScheme` by moving all existing methods of `Spec` to `AffineScheme`;
- upgrade `Spec` to a functor from `CommutativeRings` to `Schemes` (or `Schemes(A)` if a base ring _A_ is specified), returning objects of type `AffineScheme`.

Example of the new functionality:

```
sage: A.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: Spec(A)
Spectrum of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
sage: type(Spec(A))
<class 'sage.schemes.generic.scheme.AffineScheme_with_category'>
sage: B.<t> = QQ[]
sage: f = A.hom((t^2, t^3))
sage: Spec(f)
Affine Scheme morphism:
  From: Spectrum of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
  To:   Spectrum of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
  Defn: Ring morphism:
          From: Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
          To:   Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
          Defn: x |--> t^2
                y |--> t^3
```

Two small user-visible changes had to be made to accommodate the new situation:
- If _S_ = Spec(_A_) is an affine scheme, then the syntax `S(a_1, ..., a_n)` to construct the topological point of _S_ defined by the prime ideal _P_ = (_a_<sub>1</sub>, ..., _a<sub>n</sub>_) of _A_ is no longer supported.  The syntax `S(A.ideal(a_1, ..., a_n))` now has to be used instead.  This is because it conflicts with the much more useful application of this syntax to construct the point with coordinates (_a_<sub>1</sub>, ..., _a<sub>n</sub>_) if _S_ is (a subscheme of) an affine space *A*<sup>_n_</sup>.
- Given _S_ = Spec(_A_) and another scheme _X_, the result of `X(A)` is the same as before (a point homset), but `X(S)`, which used to be identical to this, now returns the standard scheme homset.  To get the point homset, one now has to type `X(A)` or `X(S.coordinate_ring())`.  This seems the "principle of least surprise" convention to me, and it is consistent with the fact that `X.point_homset()` only accepts rings, not affine schemes.

For easier reviewing (until #15990 is merged), it is probably helpful to look at the individual commits or at the output of `git diff bf9f3f4a 68f25537`.  [Edit: not necessary anymore.]

LGTM modulo some minor review tweaks I did. If you're happy with my changes, then positive review.

I am fairly sure that this is not caused by this ticket, but by #11474.  The order is also computed in a doctest a few lines above; if the elliptic curve is still in the cache of the `UniqueFactory` from #11474, then it never looks at the `algorithm` parameter.

Hmm...despite not making any changes to that file, it's somehow falling back to the cached version because it wasn't garbage collected. There doesn't seem to be a memory leak as far as I can tell, so I'm thinking it's just hanging around longer in the doctest. In either case, I made the check of the algorithm more robust.

This should be solved by #16680.

Argh, didn't see this in time and made a different fix in #16680.  I think it is a bit silly to check the `algorithm` keyword if we are going to return the cached version anyway.  Maybe we can continue the discussion at #16680?

Well then for dependencies, should we then have #11474 and #16680?

It seems to me that this ticket actually has nothing to do with the problem Volker found; it is #11474 that should have had #16680 as a dependency if it hadn't been closed already.  Would you agree with setting this one back to positive review and finishing #16680 before the next beta?

I can't reproduce the error Volker got with this ticket alone, so I agree with your assessment. Positive review and lets (quickly) finish #16680.
