# Issue 26982: bootstrap should fail gracefully, if there is no pkg-config available

./bootstrap requires pkg-config to run properly. It should switch to downloading configure spkg not only if there are no autotools, but also if there is no pkg-config.

OK, Volker, how about this?

Comment by vbraun created at 2019-02-06 23:34:39

IMHO whether or not there is a pkg-config binary isn't the same as autoconf understanding PKG_CHECK_MODULES.

PKG.m4 - macros are a part of pkg-config. (a sufficiently new one - we can add a version check in bootstrap...)

We can also add a call to `PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG` to `configure.ac`.

It is of course perfectly possible to have a mangled install of pkg-config, without the needed m4 macros.

I agree. The right thing to check then is whether the macro `PKG_CHECK_MODULES` is expanded.

Also, what goes wrong when `pkg-config` is not installed? The bug report should say that.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2019-02-07 06:40:47

`m4_pattern_forbid` may be the correct solution here. See https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf.html#Forbidden-Patterns

from the latest commit message:

```
    check that pkg-config and its m4 macros are installed
    
    use m4_ifndef() in configure.ac to check that PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG
    is provided.
    
    just in case, also check that pkg-config is present
    
    calling PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG in configure.ac
    
    renaming of clashing with PKG_* m4 names in m4/*
    (otherwise PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG cannot be mentioned at all)

```

took a while to figure out weird errors caused by m4 vars name clashes.

Not 100% sure whether we ought to call `PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG`. I do this in the current branch,
I suppose it cannot hurt.

Right, so all that you need is something like `m4_pattern_forbid([^PKG_])`.

What's the point of checking for `pkgconf` in `bootstrap`? Generating the `./configure` script should be orthogonal to whether or not `pkgconf` is installed.

OK, so this should be the correct fix, merging cleanly with #27114, too.

Generating configure needs pkg-config since #27114, which uses PKG_* m4 macros, why not?
The resulting ./configure does not need pkg-config, it can do without just fine.

> Generating configure needs pkg-config since #27219

You need to distinguish between _generating_ `configure` and _running_ configure. In this ticket, we are only concerned with the `bootstrap` script which runs `autoconf` to _generate_ `configure`.

Now `autoconf` is a macro processor, so it would be surprising that it would run `pkg-config`. Even if it does, what happens if `pkg-config` is not installed? I would assume that it fails gracefully, so I still don't see the point of the extra `pkg-config --version` check.

By the way, if you want to use `m4_ifndef`, at least make sure that error message is correct:

```
m4_ifndef([PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG],
    [m4_fatal([Could not locate the pkg-config autoconf macros.
    These are usually located in /usr/share/aclocal/pkg.m4. If your
    macros are in a different location, try setting the environment
    variable ACLOCAL="aclocal -I/other/macro/dir" before running
    autoreconf/autogen.sh.])])
```

The script in Sage is called `bootstrap`.

In general, your commit history on this ticket is a mess, so I suggest to rebase and squash.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2019-02-07 12:57:58

I am certainly distinguishing between generating and running configure. Generating configure only needs m4 macros, this is correct. 

Would you like me to take out from bootstrap the test for `pkg-config` presence?

the problem is that for this to work, I need changes to `m4/sage_spkg_collect.m4`
akin to ones done on #27114. (I first did my own, without using #27114, only to find out that merging #27114 gets painful with them; so I decided to use a part of #27114, but haven't done it quite right...).

After I'm done here, #27114 will have to be rebased on top of this one.

Indeed, this is more or less what I meant.

For the record, the message when the `pkg-config` macros are not installed:

```
configure.ac:219: error: Could not locate the pkg-config autoconf macros.
    These are usually located in /usr/share/aclocal/pkg.m4. If your
    macros are in a different location, try setting the environment
    variable ACLOCAL="aclocal -I/other/macro/dir" before running
    ./bootstrap
configure.ac:219: the top level
autom4te: /usr/bin/m4 failed with exit status: 1
aclocal-1.15: error: echo failed with exit status: 1
Bootstrap failed. Either install pkg-config m4 macros for autotools or run bootstrap with                                                                               
the -d option to download the auto-generated files instead.                                                                                                             
```


So it fails correctly.

One more detail: it would be better to reserve a specific exit code for that case. I'll prepare a review commit.

I'm happy with this now. Feel free to set to positive review if you agree.

I've been AFK, else I would've chimed in sooner.  But this looks good to me now.

Indeed, there's no need to actually have `pkg-config` to build anything, just the `PKG_` macros that are typically installed alongside pkg-config.  I had also just suggested adding a copy of `pkg.m4` to our `m4/` directory but I like this even better (I see no reason a build machine, except maybe on OSX, shouldn't have pkg-config installed anyways).
