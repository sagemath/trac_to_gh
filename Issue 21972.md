At the moment the result from differentiation of the functions `conj`, `real`, `imag` is preliminary, and from `abs` is wrong.

```
sage: _ = var('x', domain='real')
sage: _ = var('z')

sage: (x^z).conjugate().diff(x)
x^(z - 1)*z*D[0](conjugate)(x^z)
sage: atan(x).imag_part().diff(x)
D[0](imag_part)(arctan(x))/(x^2 + 1)
sage: abs(log(z)).diff(z)
log(z)/(z*abs(log(z)))
```


GiNaC has functionality that is only now included in Pynac. The ticket should doctest it when it is implemented.
