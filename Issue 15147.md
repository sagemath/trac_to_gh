Hey Dan,

I've fixed it. The (first `r`) columns are given by `P.simple_roots()`, and it's the inverse matrix should have the Kac labels (which it does).

The scalar product that was implemented is fundamental in Kac' book and for that alone this is an important patch.

I got one doctest failure in weight_space.py:


```
sage -t weight_space.py
**********************************************************************
File "weight_space.py", line 131, in sage.combinat.root_system.weight_space.WeightSpace

Expected nothing
Got:
    Failure in _test_not_implemented_methods:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    [snip]
    AssertionError: Not implemented method: _symmetric_form_matrix
```

In `cartan_type.py` you could delete the sentence on line 108 since you do implement Coxeter numbers!

For the positive roots, imaginary roots, etc. The user might like to know how to get a list of them. For *untwisted* types you can do this.


```
sage: PR=RootSystem(['A',3,1]).root_lattice().positive_real_roots()
sage: [PR.unrank(i) for i in [0..4]]
[alpha[1], alpha[2], alpha[3], alpha[1] + alpha[2], alpha[2] + alpha[3]]
```


Is there a more obvious way? And should something like this be in the doctest?

In the method basic_imaginary_roots the docstring still refers to simple imaginary roots (twice).

It would be good if there were pointers to Kac' book in some places. For example, in symmetric_form, the doc could have a pointer to Chapter 6. The Coxeter number method could have a pointer to Bourbaki, Lie Groups and Lie Algebras V.6.1.

I'm not sure if at the end of the day we want to keep using `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets` and possibly adding better general support for those or making our own special subclasses and having them be better targeted for the roots here.

The following breaks:

[RootSystem(['A',2,2]).root_lattice().positive_roots().unrank(x) for x in [0..10]]

It works for untwisted types. Is this a limitation of the patch or an unexpected failure?

If it is a limitation of the patch maybe it should be noted in the patch description. Also it
might be better to fail with a not implemented error than with:


```
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for //: 'RootSpace_with_category.element_class' and 'int'

What about this?

AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'dual'
```


BTW Sage reports this root system as Root lattice of the Root system of type ['C', 3, 1]^*

If I have my facts straight Macdonald introduced a classification of affine root systems in his
paper "Affine root systems and the Dedekind eta function" Inventiones 1972 but
Kac didn't follow Macdonald. He introduced his own classification. So we are
entering root systems in Kac' notation and they are getting converted automatically
to Macdonald's notation. Of course that policy was not introduced by this patch but
I mention that I've personally found it a little confusing.

Another (stupid) error on my part. Fixed.

Also if you want to display in Kac's notation, you can do the following (it's somewhat hidden at the bottom of `CatanType?`):

```
sage: CartanType.global_options(notation='Kac')
sage: CartanType(['D',4,2])
['D', 4, 2]
```

Hey Dan,

I've fixed the issue; the matrix `stack()` command doesn't coerce (well, it's more of I've worked around it and is now #16399). I've added some more doctests about this. I'll merge in the latest beta later tonight.
