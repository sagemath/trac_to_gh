In vanilla Python it's prefectly possible to generate docstrings of a class or a function with a decorator, they will be doctested just fine.

However, in Sage it's not so - such amendments are ignored. Example:
running `sage -t c.py` on the following file

```python
# c.py
def docstr(f):
    """
    amends the docstring
    """
    f.__doc__ += """
    sage: len(tst.__subclasses__()) > 0
    True
    """
    return f

@docstr
class tst:
    '''testing
    sage: len(tst.__subclasses__()) <= 1
    True
    '''
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

results in

```
sage -t --warn-long 123.3 --random-seed=313143694260561478650367732388987074616 c1.py
    [1 test, 0.01 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
```

If we modify `c.py` to correct prompts in doctests to vanilla Python,
and doctest:

```
$ sed -r "s/sage\:/>>>/" c1.py > ccc.py
$ python3 ccc.py
$ python3 ccc.py 
**********************************************************************
File "/tmp/ccc.py", line 17, in __main__.tst
Failed example:
    len(tst.__subclasses__()) > 0
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of   2 in __main__.tst
***Test Failed*** 1 failures.
```


we see that the doctest added by the decorator gets run (it fails by design, that's OK).

As we often have a lot of repeated boilerplate in docstrings, we're doing too much copy-paste, intstead of using decorators (it appears to be a common belief that doctest frameworks scrape code from files - it's not true, they operate on `__doc__` attributes, as we see).

So something should be fixed in Sage doctest framework here.

Sage's doctesting framework creates the tests by reading the file and searching for triple quoted strings; it does not actually execute python code.  So I don't think there's an easy fix for this issue.

Here's the function that actually creates the doctests: https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/doctest/sources.py#n230

The only reason for this I can imagine is wanting one tool for Python and Cython.
For Python, it seems that one only needs to teach Python's doctest framework that the prompts in doctests are `sage:`, not `>>>`, no?

For Cython - I actually don't know why one can't run a preprocessor of your choice on Cython, before doctesting...

> In the long run, I would hope that we can replace our own doctest discovery by a pytest plugin - see #33546 and the open follow-up tickets (such as #33826).

I tried `sage --pytest c.py` on examples with decorator as above and it worked just fine, like the vanilla Python doctests. This is still with `>>>` prompts. With `sage:` prompts everything was ignored - I think it's because it's out of Sage tree (is it a Sage bug?)

On the other hand, if on the git branch
`u/dimpase/deprecate_sage_interfaces_is____element_functions`, where I have `src/sage/interfaces/abc.py` with some decorator - generated docstrings, it all works:

```
$ ./sage --pytest src/sage/interfaces/abc.py 
===================================== test session starts ======================================
platform linux -- Python 3.9.2, pytest-7.1.3, pluggy-1.0.0
rootdir: /home/dimpase/work/software/sage/src, configfile: tox.ini
collected 4 items                                                                              

src/sage/interfaces/abc.py ....                                                          [100%]

====================================== 4 passed in 0.06s =======================================
```


4 is the total number of classes there, 2 with decorater-generated docstrings, and 2 with "normal" ones. Note that `pytest` counts everything in one docstring as one test -  in this case anyway there is just one test per class.
