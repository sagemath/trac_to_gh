In vanilla Python it's prefectly possible to generate docstrings of a class or a function with a decorator, they will be doctested just fine.

However, in Sage it's not so - such amendments are ignored. Example:
running `sage -t c.py` on the following file

```python
# c.py
def docstr(f):
    """
    amends the docstring
    """
    f.__doc__ += """
    sage: len(tst.__subclasses__()) > 0
    True
    """
    return f

@docstr
class tst:
    '''testing
    sage: len(tst.__subclasses__()) <= 1
    True
    '''
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

results in

```
sage -t --warn-long 123.3 --random-seed=313143694260561478650367732388987074616 c1.py
    [1 test, 0.01 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
```

If we modify `c.py` to correct prompts in doctests to vanilla Python,
and doctest:

```
$ sed -r "s/sage\:/>>>/" c1.py > ccc.py
$ python3 ccc.py
$ python3 ccc.py 
**********************************************************************
File "/tmp/ccc.py", line 17, in __main__.tst
Failed example:
    len(tst.__subclasses__()) > 0
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of   2 in __main__.tst
***Test Failed*** 1 failures.
```


we see that the doctest added by the decorator gets run (it fails by design, that's OK).

As we often have a lot of repeated boilerplate in docstrings, we're doing too much copy-paste, intstead of using decorators (it appears to be a common belief that doctest frameworks scrape code from files - it's not true, they operate on `__doc__` attributes, as we see).

So something should be fixed in Sage doctest framework here.

cc'ing the authors of Sage's doctest framework

I would phrase this as an enhancement, not a defect. Sage's doctesting works by, as you say, scraping code from files, and you're asking that it instead read `__doc__` attributes. Seems like a good idea, but I'm probably missing some subtleties.

Maybe William can fill in some of the history. I wonder if in Sage's early days, Python's doctesting framework was underdeveloped, or maybe even nonexistent, so Sage created its own? By the time David Roe updated the framework, he used some of Python's `doctest` module, and maybe now, ten years later, it's time to revisit the whole thing. I'm not volunteering, though.

In the long run, I would hope that we can replace our own doctest discovery by a pytest plugin - see #33546 and the open follow-up tickets (such as #33826).

Sage's doctesting framework creates the tests by reading the file and searching for triple quoted strings; it does not actually execute python code.  So I don't think there's an easy fix for this issue.

Here's the function that actually creates the doctests: https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/doctest/sources.py#n230

The only reason for this I can imagine is wanting one tool for Python and Cython.
For Python, it seems that one only needs to teach Python's doctest framework that the prompts in doctests are `sage:`, not `>>>`, no?

For Cython - I actually don't know why one can't run a preprocessor of your choice on Cython, before doctesting...

I'm not saying it's not possible to change how the tests are created. But that's not currently how we interact with Python's doctest module.

I'm not going to be able to look at this much anytime soon (giving a talk in mid January that I still have a TON of work to do for, and then multiple trips after that).  I think if I was trying to add this capability to Sage's doctest framework, I would try to create a new subclass of `DoctestSource` that actually executed the file and then extracted tests from it.  But I don't know what issues might arise when you try to do that.

I tried `sage --pytest c.py` on examples with decorator as above and it worked just fine, like the vanilla Python doctests. This is still with `>>>` prompts. With `sage:` prompts everything was ignored - I think it's because it's out of Sage tree (is it a Sage bug?)

On the other hand, if on the git branch
`u/dimpase/deprecate_sage_interfaces_is____element_functions`, where I have `src/sage/interfaces/abc.py` with some decorator - generated docstrings, it all works:

```
$ ./sage --pytest src/sage/interfaces/abc.py 
===================================== test session starts ======================================
platform linux -- Python 3.9.2, pytest-7.1.3, pluggy-1.0.0
rootdir: /home/dimpase/work/software/sage/src, configfile: tox.ini
collected 4 items                                                                              

src/sage/interfaces/abc.py ....                                                          [100%]

====================================== 4 passed in 0.06s =======================================
```


4 is the total number of classes there, 2 with decorater-generated docstrings, and 2 with "normal" ones. Note that `pytest` counts everything in one docstring as one test -  in this case anyway there is just one test per class.
