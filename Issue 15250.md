[This sage-support post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-support/lpqzCOja6kg/lWVdmInFa8gJ) points out that our error message isn't very helpful when trying to use matrices in symbolic expressions.

```
sage: P=x^2                                       
sage: P(x=4)                                      
16
sage: M=matrix([(1, -3, -1),(0, 1, 1),(-1, 2, 1)])
sage: P(x=M)                           
<boom that doesn't tell you do use polynomial rings>
```

Let's improve this.  If we can even get this to work properly (no boom) that would be even better.
