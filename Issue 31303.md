# Issue 31303: Implement the alternating central extension of the q-Onsager algebra

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31540

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2021-03-22 23:58:57

CC:  chapoton

Keywords: q-Onsager, quantum group

This was recently shown to have a PBW basis (https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03028). We provide the implementation using those reduction rules.

pyflakes is not happy

in the reference file, `P. Baseilhac` should be `\P. Baseilhac`

in the header, please use `https://www.gnu.org/licenses/` with https

Thank you. I have fixed all of these.

This looks strange

```
[l for l in x.to_word_list()]
```


Typo here (or > of)

```
PBW generator or the
```


Concerning dagger, the codomain should be the opposite algebra. But we do not have any way to explain that, do we ?

Indeed, that could be simplified.

Fixed.

Not really, no. Since we want to identify the opposite algebra with the original algebra as vector spaces, the best we can do here is think of it as a linear map (rather than an algebra morphism).
