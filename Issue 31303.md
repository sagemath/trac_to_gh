CC:  @fchapoton

Keywords: q-Onsager, quantum group

This was recently shown to have a PBW basis (https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03028). We provide the implementation using those reduction rules.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31540

pyflakes is not happy

in the reference file, `P. Baseilhac` should be `\P. Baseilhac`

in the header, please use `https://www.gnu.org/licenses/` with https

This looks strange

```
[l for l in x.to_word_list()]
```


Typo here (or > of)

```
PBW generator or the
```


Concerning dagger, the codomain should be the opposite algebra. But we do not have any way to explain that, do we ?

Indeed, that could be simplified.

Fixed.

Not really, no. Since we want to identify the opposite algebra with the original algebra as vector spaces, the best we can do here is think of it as a linear map (rather than an algebra morphism).
