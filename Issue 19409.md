This ticket is mostly just copying stuff from #14304 and #16664. I did add a few more changes, so somebody should still look at the branch.

Thanks for splitting this out of the other tickets.
A note on the `fq` bindings, could you add the `fq_div` functions?
They were mysteriously left out of the release when I started #16664, but should be in now.

I saw them commented out, so I didn't know what to do with them.

Note that there was no need to comment them out in the first place: it's not a problem to declare functions which don't actually exist. You will get a compiler error when you use them, but not if you just declare them.

There is still no `fq_nmod_div`...

Yes indeed...
And I see

```
FLINT_DLL void fq_div(fq_t rop, const fq_t op1, const fq_t op2, const fq_ctx_t ctx);
FLINT_DLL void fq_sqr(fq_t rop, const fq_t op, const fq_ctx_t ctx);
FLINT_DLL void fq_div(fq_t rop, const fq_t op1, const fq_t op2, const fq_ctx_t ctx);
FLINT_DLL void fq_sqr(fq_t rop, const fq_t op, const fq_ctx_t ctx);
```

in the trunk version of `fq.h`.
I'll make a pull request upstream.

Actually there is a `fq_nmod_div` prototype which gets defined through the inclusion of `fq_templates.h`.
