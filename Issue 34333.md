As it turns out, I fail to make runsnake work with sage on ubuntu 2.04.1.

After `sudo apt-get install runsnakerun` I get

```
  File "/usr/bin/runsnake", line 15, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
ImportError: No module named pkg_resources
```
Internet tells me to install `python-setuptools`, which then gets me

```
sage: runsnake("primes_first_n(1000)")
sage: Traceback (most recent call last):

OK, I did:

```
sudo apt-get remove runsnakerun 
sudo apt remove python2
sudo apt autoremove 
sudo apt-get install python-is-python3 
sudo apt-get install runsnakerun 
```
All of these went smooth (python2 actually had no dependencies)

Now it almost works:

It seems that this is really a runsnake problem, I get the same errors by invoking runsnake directly.
