As it turns out, I fail to make runsnake work with sage on ubuntu 2.04.1.

After `sudo apt-get install runsnakerun` I get

```
  File "/usr/bin/runsnake", line 15, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
ImportError: No module named pkg_resources
```

Internet tells me to install `python-setuptools`, which then gets me

```
sage: runsnake("primes_first_n(1000)")
sage: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/runsnake", line 15, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point

    needed = self.resolve(parse_requirements(requirements))

    raise DistributionNotFound(req, requirers)

```

which ubuntu ?

using python2.7 is certainly not a good idea

```
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS"
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION_ID="22.04"
VERSION="22.04.1 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)"
```

Do you know how I can instruct ubuntu to use the correct python?

there is a package python-is-python3

OK, I did:

```
sudo apt-get remove runsnakerun 
sudo apt remove python2
sudo apt autoremove 
sudo apt-get install python-is-python3 
sudo apt-get install runsnakerun 
```

All of these went smooth (python2 actually had no dependencies)

Now it almost works:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: runsnake("s[2,1](s[4])")
sage: 10:53:52: Debug: Adding duplicate image handler for 'PNG file'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/wx/core.py", line 3282, in <lambda>
    lambda event: event.callable(*event.args, **event.kw) )
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/runsnakerun/runsnake.py", line 701, in load
    self.SetModel(self.loader)
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/runsnakerun/runsnake.py", line 738, in SetModel
    self.squareMap.SetModel(tree, self.adapter)
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/squaremap/squaremap.py", line 221, in SetModel
    self.UpdateDrawing()
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/squaremap/squaremap.py", line 247, in UpdateDrawing
    self.Draw(dc)
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/squaremap/squaremap.py", line 257, in Draw
    font = self.FontForLabels(dc)
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/squaremap/squaremap.py", line 267, in FontForLabels
    font.SetPointSize(scale * font.GetPointSize())
TypeError: Font.SetPointSize(): argument 1 has unexpected type 'float'
```

(and the runsnake window contains, in particular, no graphics)

It seems that this is really a runsnake problem, I get the same errors by invoking runsnake directly.
