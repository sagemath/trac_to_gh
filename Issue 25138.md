With Sage 8.3.beta1, I have seen the same failures as reported in #20222:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 224.1 src/sage/plot/hyperbolic_regular_polygon.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 224.1 src/sage/repl/rich_output/backend_sagenb.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 224.1 src/sage/combinat/crystals/crystals.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 224.1 src/sage/game_theory/matching_game.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

where a typical example is

```

Failed example:
    g.plot()
Expected:

Naturally I can't figure out how to reproduce this. The only time it happened, I built from a fresh 8.3.beta1 tarball on a machine on which I have built and run Sage many times. The file `.sage/matplotlib-1.5.1/fontList.json` has a recent modification time. I tried rebuilding from scratch and I tried deleting the directory `./sage/matplotlib-1.5.1/`, but I can not reproduce the error.
