# Issue 20883: Silence the logging when running "sage -b", for example

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2016-07-28 19:13:01

Because of the changes in #20712, running `sage -b` prints many lines of debugging information:

```
python_packages = ...
python_modules = ...
python_data_files = ...
```

Let's silence these messages.

Cool, thanks!  (Thought of the same, but hadn't had the time yet.)
