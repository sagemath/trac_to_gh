# Issue 22309: Improve combinatorial_automorphism_group in polyhedra class

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22546

Keywords: polyhedron, days84

Currently, the `combinatorial_automorphism_group` method in the polyhedron class returns the a group isomorphic to the automorphism group of the vertex-edge graph of the polyhedron. I propose to changes two the method:

 (1) don't return a permutation group on the number `1, 2,.. self.n_vertices()`, but rather a permutation group on the actual objects (vertices of the polyhedron)

 (2) wide the functionality to not only return the automorphism group of the vertex-edge graph, but also of the vertex-facet graph.

The second improvement has the advantage that the automorphism group of the vertex-facet graph is the same as the automorphism of the face lattice. 

Since the vertex-facet graph is also used in the related `.is_combinatorially_isomorphic` method (see #22500)

This addition does everything I propose to do and illustrate the differences with examples.

- Aren't the vertices actually numbered from `0` up to `n-1`?

```
sage: p = polytopes.associahedron(['A',2])
sage: p.faces(0)
(<0>, <1>, <2>, <3>, <4>)
```


- typo in the ticket description `returns the a group isomorphic`

- in the docstring, I am not sure that `whether to the graph` is proper english

- Why `_vertex_facet_graph` starts with a underscore?

Thanks for the comments, Vincent!

 - about the numbering: yes the vertices have their labeling from `0` to `n-1`, and also the facets of dimension `P.dim()-1` have their labeling. From this it is not quite clear to me, what the best labeling for the nodes in the vertex_facet_graph would be. if `labels=True`, we get consistent result with the `.graph` method:

```
sage: p = polytopes.associahedron(['A',2])
sage: p.graph().vertices()

[A vertex at (-1, 0),
 A vertex at (-1, 1),
 A vertex at (0, -1),
 A vertex at (1, -1),
 A vertex at (1, 1)]
sage: p.vertex_facet_graph().vertices()

[An inequality (-1, 0) x + 1 >= 0,
 An inequality (0, -1) x + 1 >= 0,
 An inequality (0, 1) x + 1 >= 0,
 An inequality (1, 0) x + 1 >= 0,
 An inequality (1, 1) x + 1 >= 0,
 A vertex at (-1, 0),
 A vertex at (-1, 1),
 A vertex at (0, -1),
 A vertex at (1, -1),
 A vertex at (1, 1)]
```

  The reason to have the options `labels=False` is basically only for internal use by the .is_combinatorially_isomorphic method. 

 - typo in the description fixed
 - changed  the sentence to "decide how the nodes of the graph are labelled. Either with the original vertices/facets  of the Polyhedron or with integers."
 - I have no strong opinion if this method should be public or start with an underscore, I guess there are reasons for both. (Now I removed the underscore).

Is the description of the ticket missing a sentence at the end?

- There is a space missing here:


```
sage: O=polytopes.octahedron(); O
```


- There is an indentation too much it seems in the OUTPUT field of `combinatorial_automorphism_group`

Thanks for looking at the ticket, JP! I fixed up the things you mentioned and added some little improvements in the docstring. Also I rebased on the current rc0.
