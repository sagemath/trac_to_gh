CC:  @JohnCremona

Keywords: pellian, integers, solution

In sympy solution of Diophantine equations is available for several types of equations. This meta-ticket aims at

* making the resp. sympy functions fully usable with Sage
  1. symbolic expressions
  2. univariate polynomials
  3. multivariate polynomials
  4. quadratic forms
  5. lists of linear 1/2/3
* implementing a global `solve_diophantine()` function that wraps the sympy functionality
* where useful implementing member functions `solve_diophantine()`

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16590

However, the last solution shown in the workaround is incomplete, see https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/7671. Still, it would be good to have the functionality at hand in Sage.

OK, so this ticket is really an interface to Sympy code and all the tests pass. 

A suggestion that you might want to consider: Pell's equation is in no reasonable sense a correct attribution. I would prefer Brahmagupta-Pell equation. For historic comments, see A. Weil's book "Number Theory, An approach through history from Hammurapi to Legendre" or Whitford's book "Pell's equation" for some of the early history. 

Modulo this, positive review.

This test

```python
all(sol[i] == res[i] for i in range(len(sol)))
```

still depends on the order of the *solutions* (which is machine dependent as per Volker's note), not the (only) print order of the `dict`s. So I think a better test would be

```python
all(solution in res for solution in sol)
```

Sorry, I just realized this isn't quite sufficient. We should also add an `and len(res) == len(sol)` as there could be more "solutions" in `sol` than there should be. Once you add that, you can set positive review. Thanks.
