This adds syntax highlighting for the notebook debugger of ticket #7509.

Depends on patch attachment:trac_7509.5.patch:ticket:7509.

For reasons of speed only a small part of the source code around the current position is loaded and highlighted. We detect when the
code fragment starts in the middle of a docstring to ensure correct
highlighting in this case.

Needs rebase, and probably an upstream request...

Proposing to close all sagenb tickets as outdated, so that all remaining open tickets in the notebook component are about the Jupyter notebook.
