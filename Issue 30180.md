As of the IPython 7 upgrade #28197, preparsing multiline strings does not work anymore. The preparser alters multiline strings, even though it should not:

```
sage: """
....: abc-1-2
....: """
'\nabc-Integer(1)-Integer(2)\n'    # expected: '\nabc-1-2\n'
```

Note that this only happens in the sage shell not during doctesting. If you run this during a doctest, you get the following:

```
File "src/sage/__init__.py", line 54, in sage.isfunction
Failed example:
    '''

    '''
Expected nothing
Got:
    '\nabc-1-2\n'
```

So this is exactly what we want. #29139 has a doctest that works find during doctesting but not in real life.

I assume that is because `BackendDoctest` does not inherit from `BackendIPython`, so doctesting alone will not in general detect this kind of IPython issues.

I think I was able to track this down and have pushed a branch with an attempt at a fix. The state of whether/which set of quotes we were in wasn't being carried over across lines of input.

Apparently this does the job. Looks fine to me.

We could remove an unused import, while we are touching the file anyway:

```

Sorry, sorry. When I commented out the import, I forgot that in Python you need a `pass` statement in an empty block. That's what broke the doctests, not removing the import.

That said, I think my understanding of the import's intent is still correct, and thus it shouldn't be removed. Here's the full block of code for context:

```python
# Load the %lprun extension if available
try:
    import line_profiler
except ImportError:
    pass
else:
    self.extensions.append('line_profiler')
```
