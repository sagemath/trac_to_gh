Keywords: hyperelliptic curve, singular

We have

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(3))
sage: H=HyperellipticCurve(x^5+1)
sage: H.is_singular()
True
```

but `H` is a non-singular hyperelliptic curve. Although this is **not** an error, since all hyperelliptic curves, where the degree of the defining polynomial is at least 5, have a singularity at infinity. 

The term non-singular hyperelliptic curve is used to say that all finite points are non-singular. Therefore it would be nice to have a function that returns the (non-)singularity of the finite points of an hyperelliptic curve.

Disagreement with Magma, there should still be some condition at infinity for this to be a nice hyperelliptic curve. We are now figuring out what that condition should be.

```
sage: P.<x> = GF(2)[]
sage: H = HyperellipticCurve(x^6+1, 1)
sage: H.is_singular()
False
sage: magma(H)
TypeError: Error evaluating Magma code.
Runtime error in 'HyperellipticCurve': Curve is singular at infinity
```


Also, it seems from the code in HyperellipticCurve that some partial check for singularity is performed there. Should that be a full check or no check at all?

Apply 11930_singular_hyperelliptic.patch and 11930_is_singular.patch

The first of these patches (written by Damiano and I) adds tests to the HyperellipticCurve constructor. It tests whether the input polynomials f(x) and h(x) really make sense. In other words, it checks if there is some g such that, when f and h are homogenized wrt x to degrees 2g+2 and g+1 respectively, one gets a smooth projective curve. We compared it with the independent implementation in Magma, and the test turns out to be equivalent to Magma's test for all input polynomials over GF(2) and GF(3) where deg(f) is 5 or 6 and deg(h) <= 3.

The second patch is Daniel's function, but with a simpler algorithm that uses the fact that only smooth curves are constructed.

To check whether a polynomial has repeated roots, this patch uses both GCDs and resultants. It tries the GCD first, because that is fastest. If that fails, it tries the resultant.

The reason for needing both gcds and resultants is actually quite funny: Qp has no gcd currently implemented in Sage, while extensions of Qp have no resultants in Sage!

With 4.8.alpha4, I get

```
sage: P.<x> = Qp(5,7)[]
sage: x.gcd(x)

Hi David,

This "NOTE" is just a warning that we added about the code as it was. It is not about a change that we are making. We decided to leave support for conics and elliptic curves intact, as people may be running a loop over general double covers, or not care too much.

Removing support for conics and elliptic curves would be something for a discussion on sage-nt, and then a new ticket. I can remove this note if you'd like, and leave the rest of the patch as it is. Would that be an improvement?

I tested this on Sage 4.8.

There is a method is_smooth() which can be applied to a hyperelliptic curve. With the patches applied:


```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(3))
sage: H=HyperellipticCurve(x^5+1)
sage: H.is_singular()
False
sage: H.is_smooth()
False
```


Maybe these two methods should give consistent results. The is_smooth() method seems to be defined in the class AlgebraicScheme_subscheme_projective in algebraic_scheme.py.

When applying the patch, mercurial will look for a certain block of code and replace it by another. The code to look for also has three surrounding unchanged lines on each side. Fuzz means that there is a slight mismatch in the surrounding code, due to changes in Sage between after I wrote the patch. More precisely, fuzz n means that a block can only be matched if the outermost n lines of the surrounding code are ignored. I've seen patches be rejected because of fuzz 2, but I think fuzz 1 is fine: there are still 2 lines unchanged around every patched line.

In this particular case, it means that a doctest nearby one of the changed doctests in hyperelliptic_finite_field.py has changed since I wrote the patch.

To get rid of the fuzz, the patch can be rebased (apply to latest version, then qrefresh and export), but I don't think it is necessary with fuzz 1.

I'm not sure whether just using the patchbot is ok. According to the [developer's guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#reviewing-a-patch), you are supposed to run the tests marked "#long" as well, and I don't see where the patchbot does this.

As for your failing tests, any tests that fail on an unpatched Sage can be safely ignored, they are not due to the patch.

In this particular case, it is ok.

In detail: it seems that many people are very annoyed by trailing whitespaces on non-empty lines (see [here](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/f6a783b3a52bfa5d/30809dba7cfb13dd)), hence don't want any new ones to be introduced.

```

All tests pass except one which fails on an unaltered Sage 5.0 (on OS X 10.7.3). 

The failure was with "rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx" and the tests are not flagged # long time and so are covered by the tests run by the patchbot on this ticket.

This all looks good. If the other reviewers agree, we can change the status to positive review.

I only have two small comments on the patches:

Yes, and we should not allow that.

The other reviewers are the authors of the current version, so you don't need to consult us (we are the ones who set this to "needs review" in the first place). If you agree with the new patch, you can set it to "positive review" yourself.
