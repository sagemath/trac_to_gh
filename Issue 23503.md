# Issue 23503: Plotting Julia Sets for General Polynomials

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23740

Original creator: bbarros

Original creation time: 2017-08-28 21:24:20

CC:  bhutz atowsley

Keywords: gsoc2017, complexdynamics

This is the final ticket in a series of tickets that I have opened this summer in an effort to improve the functionality for complex dynamics in Sage. With this ticket, I plan to modify the `julia_plot` function to support general polynomial functions. The map z^2 + c will still be hardcoded so the function will not lose any speed for the z^2 + c case. This ticket is dependent on #23720 which implements the plotting of the Mandelbrot set for general polynomials.

docs fail to build

TODO is to implement the side-by-side general mandlebrot/julia plot, *not* to implement an interactive.

functionality worked in my testing.

Looks good to me. I made some additional minor doc fixes.

DO NOT IMPORT ANYTHING FROM sagenb, please !

Because sagenb is going to disappear very soon, with the switch to Python3

Further changes to `julia_plot` are tracked at #28923.
