# Issue 25391: translation errors from fricas to sage

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: fricas

Sorry that I do not know if these are known issues or not. Thought to report them. If there are known, feel free to close this.

Using Sage `version 8.3.beta6`
 
This one seems to be that there is no translation from fricas to sage. Is this due to the `atan` ?



```
           sage:  var('x a')
           sage:  integrate(1/(1+a*cos(x)),x,algorithm="fricas")

    NotImplementedError: The translation of the FriCAS Expression "atan(((cos(x)+a)*((-1)*a^2+1)^(1/2))/((a^2+(-1))*sin(x)))/(((-1)*a^2+1)^(1/2)) to sage is not yet implemented.

```



And this one



```
    sage: var('x a b')
    sage: anti=integrate(1/(b*x^2+a),x,algorithm="fricas")

    NotImplementedError: The translation of the FriCAS Expression "log(((b*x^2+(-1)*a)*((-1)*a*b)^(1/2)+2*a*b*x)/(b*x^2+a))/(2*((-1)*a*b)^(1/2)) to sage is not yet implemented.

```

Thank you for reporting!

Both are fixed with #25606...

Martin, one should add doctests for these.

Hm, would you mind looking also at #25602?

Hello;
Fyi. I installed sagemath 8.3 beta7 and also installed Fricas 1.3.4 and the above error are no longer there. So this confirms your fixes worked.

Working very well. Thank you for making this fix.
