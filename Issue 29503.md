The following happens with sage 9.1, and certainly with previous versions as well.

```
sage: g = Graph('O{e[{}^~z`MDZBZBkXzE^')
sage: g.is_line_graph()

I think the bug was introduced in #26444. A note in the documentation of `root_graph` says that `is_line_graph` first verifies that the graph is indeed a line graph, before calling `root_graph`, but that's not true any more: `line_graph` calls `root_graph`, without doing any checking, and returns `False` if `root_graph` raises a `ValueError`. The bug is that `root_graph` sometimes raises `Exception(error_message)`, instead of `ValueError`, when the graph is not a line graph. This error is not caught by `is_line_graph`. 

The PR fixes the bug, but it is not ready for review yet, because the documentation needs to be updated. I'll do that soon.

- You did this change without updating the rest of the method.

```diff
-def line_graph(self, labels=True):
+def line_graph(g, labels=True):
```


- Also, make sure that comments are in 80 columns mode.

- A minor issue:

```diff
-    Test whether the graph `g` is a line graph.
+    Check whether the graph `g` is a line graph.
```
