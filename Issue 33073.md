# Issue 33073: Add support to save RealBalls

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33310

Original creator: @David-Berghaus

Original creation time: 2022-02-07 10:48:32

Keywords: arb, RealBallField

Saving RealBalls (and analogously ComplexBalls) is currently not supported (tested on SageMath/9.4):

```
sage: tmp = RBF(pi)
sage: save(tmp,"test")
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.real_arb.RealBall' object has no attribute '__dict__'
```

One current workaround (though not very satisfying) is to convert the elements to RealIntervalFields before saving them.
