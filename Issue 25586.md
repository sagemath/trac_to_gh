Maybe it's best if #25636 just tracks the issue with `integrate(x^m/sqrt(a + b*x^(2 - m)), x)`
and the present ticket tracks the issue with `integrate(log(sin(x))*sin(x)^2, x)`.
Unless they come from the same underlying bug in Maxima?

I see you're reporting this example as "reported upstream". I don't think the particular example is there. You could post it as well, either on a separate maxima ticket or on the maxima ticket that is tracking one of these other failing integrals.

tmonteil, did you set the upstream field to "Reported upstream" when you opened the ticket?
Did you have a reference in mind for the upstream bug report?

Thanks for noticing, here is a branch with a doctest.

By the way, note that we get an example where `full_simplify()` is not idempotent.
