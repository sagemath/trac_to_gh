I'd give it a positive review, but it says be be depending on #14302, which doesn't apply currently... I'll likely find the time to review both tomorrow.

Replying to [comment:7 jdemeyer]:

Dear Jeroen,

since you just merged #14123 into sage-5.10.rc0, I wonder if it would be a big deal to also merge this ticket. We have a workshop on www.FindStat.org in two weeks, and having this as well merged would make life a bit easier there.

Cheers, Christian
