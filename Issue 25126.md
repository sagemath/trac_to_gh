CC:  slelievre embray jdemeyer charpent dimpase

Keywords: ipython

IPython accept --simple-prompt argument, that change prompt_toolkit to raw_input for input handler.

It very usufull, if sage could pass this argument to ipython, likewise -gthread, -qthread, -q4thread, -wthread and -pylab arguments, because there is program Cantor - frontend for mathematical packages and this feature will fix broken Sage backend for Cantor.

I could attach format patch with my suggestion for changing the sage, if it needed.

P.S. I am not too familiar with trac, so if I have created ticket incorrect or I even shouldn't to create a ticket for this suggestion, please, correct me.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25363

Now, Sage backend use KPtyProcess. Common in Cantor we use QProcess or C API, but in Sage case we have bash script, which run sage program by using `exac`, and, as I know, QProcess don't work with bash `exac`, so it's just a necessity.

This is a little tricky to get just right.  While I believe it's desirable to be able to pass any IPython option on to Sage, we can't easily "pre-parse" those options without digging directly into IPython's command-line parsing.  This will be a bit easier to deal with if/when I redo the `sage` CLI, which does badly need to be modernized.

In the meantime this still has the "correct" behavior, but it causes Sage to "partially" start up (it displays the banner and everything) and then outputs `Unrecognized flag --zzfoobar` preceded by the entire *ipython* help message, which would be confusing to users who don't necessarily understand that ipython is underlying the `sage` CLI.

Let me see if I can do something a bit better in the meantime...
