Following #29514 (see also #27788 and #29212), this ticket implements `__format__` for real and complex numbers.

```
sage: '{:.4f}'.format(1.2)
'1.2000'
sage: '{:.4f}'.format(CC(1.2, 0))
'1.2000 + 0.0000*I'
```


The complex case is implemented by reusing the code from `CDF`.

The real case is implemented by delegating to Python's arbitrary precision `Decimal` numbers. This works quite well, but has the caveat that the output is not completely the same as for the `repr` of real numbers. Compare for example:


```
sage: from decimal import Decimal
sage: '{!r} {!s}'.format(RR(oo), Decimal(float(oo)))
'+infinity Infinity'
sage: '{!r} {!s}'.format(RR(-oo), Decimal(float(-oo)))
'-infinity -Infinity'
sage: '{!r} {!s}'.format(RR(0), Decimal(str(RR(0))))
'0.00000000000000 0E-15'
sage: '{!r} {:.10}'.format(RR(1e10), Decimal(float(1e10)))
'1.00000000000000e10 1.000000000E+10'
```


It looks like this can only be avoided by a custom implementation of the [format specification](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec), rather than delegating to `Decimal`, which is quite a complex task.

As those differences are small, I would suggest to leave that for a follow-up ticket and merge this ticket as is.

#30689 should fix this. It is nice to see that the format specification seems to be more fully implemented in your Python version. On my end, I cannot reproduce it with 3.8.5 though.
