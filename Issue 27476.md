There are some bits in plain GMP not present for some reason in MPIR such that Cygwin gets some configure-time flags set differently than the defaults on Linux.  Cygwin's system package for GMP is configured with these different defaults, leading to a build failure in pynac that I don't get on other platforms.

See the upstream PR for more details: https://github.com/pynac/pynac/pull/342

To add, this started of course since #27212.  Not sure why I didn't catch the problem before since I have recollection of testing this on Cygwin, but maybe I just never rebuilt everything (including pynac?) from scratch for some reason.
