I have not looked at the details, but this sort can fail if the points are not comparable:

```
                sortkey = lambda e: [(0 if x is None else 2 if isinstance(x, str) else 1, x) for x in e]\
                    if isinstance(e, tuple) else e
                self._points = sorted(points, key=sortkey)
```

The strange `sortkey` doesn't make it easy to understand what is going on...

A mix of points of strings type and integers type will not make this function fail. 

This work in python3:

```
>>> (1, 3) < (2, 'a string')
True
```


The comparison stops if the first element of each tuple are different.

Indeed, pep8 says so, my bad.

Apparently, it does. See the patchbot report on #22029. I have not looked at the details.

On #22029, I do get

```
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for >: 'Integer Ring' and '<type 'str'>'
```

and it's pointing to the line

```
self._points = sorted(points, key=sortkey)
```
