Hi Nathann,

Globally looks good. Documentation builds and all test pass.

1) Could we make it go after #16272? There is a moderately trivial rebase to do. I think it would be easier in that direction.

2) Could we also move the `TD_6_12` into the database module?

3) In the doctests of database, I would rather call directly the function themselves followed by `is_transversal_design`. We have no idea (at least me) that the corresponding design is actually returned when we call `designs.orthogonal_array` with the good parameters. Nevertheless it is a good test to check that the latter actually return a value for those parameters (and to see whether or not it is the corresponding value).

4) (semi-stupid remark) For the 6 construction of OA from Vmt, the function is rather trivial. One way to avoid duplication is to modify the dictionnary into `n -> (k, constructor, extra_args)`. For the Vmt the entries would look like

```
OA_constructions = {
...
46: (6, OA_from_Vmt, (4,9,[0, 1, 3, 2, 8])),
50: (8, OA_from_Vmt, (6,7,[0, 1, 3, 16, 35, 26, 36])),
...
}
```

Yepyep, I will do that.

If we do that the OA will be built when Sage starts. Plus I would like to thank Julian R. Abel somewhere.

Agreed. And it is better to test the corresponding code in the docstring of the function.

For the moment it still uses the `availability` keyword, and this ticket has not been merged on tpo of #16272. This is because the #16272 is not finished and I don't want to merge it before that.

Hi Nathann,

In the doctest, I would like to see:

```
sage: TD = TD_6_12()
sage: TDbis = designs.transversal_design(6,12)
sage: TD == TDbis
True
```

It is worth it to see if the individual designs are actually used in the construction, isn't it? Even if the answer is `False` at some point, it still makes sense to keep the function and the doctest.

I do not mind too much as it is painful to edit all doctests in `database.py`.

Hi Nathann,

In `orthogonal_arrays.py` in the function `transversal_design` you added a test

```
`TD(6,12)` ::

    sage: _ = designs.transversal_design(6,12)
```

which is actually already tested in the block above it **and** in `database.py`. So if you don't mind, you can simply remove it.

Otherwise, everything is fine and it could go to positive review after that!
