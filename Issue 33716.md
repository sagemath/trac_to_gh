There seems to be some real doctest failures reported by the patchbot:

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=28903988791302297014049808319140034392 src/sage/schemes/projective/projective_morphism.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

which I can reproduce. The others

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=28903988791302297014049808319140034392 src/sage/homology/graded_resolution.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --random-seed=28903988791302297014049808319140034392 src/sage/homology/free_resolution.py  # 5 doctests failed
```

I cannot.

Here are my comments:

Since `projective_degrees()` potentially is an expensive computation, I would cache the result (which would also mean it returns a `tuple`).

Perhaps we should call `morphism()` instead `as_morphim()` to indicate that it is an equivalent but different type of object?

Yes. It is related with a deep-rooted problem of conic curves modules. I am working on it. If I fail, then I would simply change the doctest slightly.

Done. Also `graph()` is cached.
