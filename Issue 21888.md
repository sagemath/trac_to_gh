I just went through the diff which seems to do just what it claims. IIRC, that's an important upgrade bringing the new Jupyter widgets which will enable backward compatibility with the interacts of the legacy Sage notebook. So I am all for getting this in as soon as possible. Thanks Jeroen.

I haven't triple checked the technical details yet though, nor actually tested the branch, and am not sure to have the time before a couple days. So if anyone is up for it, that would be great.

I am active at all those versions except two (enum34 and nbformat are currently lower) in sage-on-gentoo, and I have no complaints from users on unstable who would have the last two as well. So positive from me.

I did run tests on this branch, and also checked that the jupyter notebook works. Looks good to go.
