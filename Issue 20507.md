The following:

```
sage: F = GF(11)
sage: Fy.<y> = F[]
sage: n, k = 10 , 5
sage: C = codes.GeneralizedReedSolomonCode(F.list()[:n], k)
sage: E = C.encoder("EvaluationPolynomial")
sage: p = y^2 + 3*y + 10
sage: c = E.encode(p);

<BOOM>
```

fails because the polynomial to encode has to be in `'x'` with the actual implementation.

This ticket fixes it, by allowing the user to specify a variable name when creating the encoder.

I was wondering whether it would make more sense to have an option to give the polynomial ring? But I'm not sure it would. For `ReedMullerCodes` (which are in the making), one could argue that it *does* make sense (since we otherwise need many names), and in this case, it would be consistent that `ReedSolomonCode` follows the same pattern.

One could also, for usability, make a method `polynomial_ring()` on the encoder which is an alias of `message_space()`.

Yes, I think it's important to be consistent between similar modules.
I'll change this so it now asks for a polynomial ring and not the variable.
I'll also add a method `polynomial_ring()`.

Cool. You also need a check that `polynomial_ring.base_ring()` is the field of the code.

> This method `polynomial_ring` feels like code duplication with `message_space`, but it makes sense to provide it, so even if it's not über-clean, I can live with that.


Yes, that's why I suggested making it an "alias of `message_space`". But now you've made a full function anyway. However, can you add in the doc-string that this is the same as the message space?

Hi David

This new feature is not examplified when typing `codes.encoders.GRSEvaluationPolynomialEncoder?`


I suggest there should be an example with 'y' or 'my_variable' in the EXAMPLE section of the docstring. 

That could be quickly done by migrating part of the existing code in the TEST section to the EXAMPLE section.
