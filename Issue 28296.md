Adding this to CPATH, interferes with sysrooted GCC compilers which have their own sysroot. For example, the conda compilers.

I'm not sure why this was added and it seems unnecessary.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28533

This old hack was added on #13515, as can be found by doing `git blame src/bin/sage-env | grep Debian`, which will show `d746e260b7c` and then `git show d746e260b7c`.

Perhaps, even if it was needed, it's for long gone Ubuntu 12.

If it was for ubuntu 12 and nothing else, yes we can absolutely remove it. Upstream support for that expired in 2017 after all.
