Throughout the linear algebra code, `characteristic_polynomial()` and `charpoly()` are aliases.  Patch makes it so for graphs (their adjacency matrices, really).

Passes doctests and does nothing dangerous. The Graph class does not really need any new method right now (more than 250 already), but well `:-D`

This one's good to go `:-)`
