Keywords: palp nef.x cygwin segfault

On my Windows 7 x64 install of 5.6.rc0 I get segfaults in nef.x.

After rebuilding with CFLAGS="-g -O0" I get the following backtrace

```
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

It seems the stack is too small.
Recompiling with CFLAGS including -Wl,--stack,10000000 (so 10MB) makes the crash disappear.
I guess the best solution would to malloc the problematic stuff on the heap.
