Archive of removed doctests testing the `abs_integrate` Maxima package (removed with #12731).


```
integrate(1/sqrt(abs(y(x))), y(x))
integrate(sgn(x) - sgn(1-x), x)
integrate(1 / (1 + abs(x-5)), x, -5, 6)
integrate(1/(1 + abs(x)), x)
integrate(cos(x + abs(x)), x)
integrate(sqrt(x + sqrt(x)), x).canonicalize_radical()
integrate(abs(x^2 - 1), x, -2, 2)

-            sage: f = sqrt(x + 1/x^2)
-            sage: maxima = sage.calculus.calculus.maxima
-            sage: maxima('radexpand')
-            true
-            sage: integrate(f, x)

-            sage: g = integrate(f, x); g
-            2/3*sqrt(x^3 + 1) - 1/3*log(sqrt(x^3 + 1) + 1) + 1/3*log(sqrt(x^3 + 1) - 1)

Never _remove_ doctests, mark them as `# known bug`.

Changing keywords from "" to "abs_integrate".

**EDIT**: 6 out of the first seven are working after #27958 (and none without)

This one hangs in giac:

```
integrate(sqrt(x + sqrt(x)), x)
```

Changing keywords from "abs_integrate" to "integration".
