As far as I can tell, there is not much connection between [the various sage-combinant trees](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/ordered_tree.html#sage.combinat.ordered_tree.OrderedTree) and the "graph theory" ones.  E.g. I couldn't figure out how to get

```
sage: G = graphs.BalancedTree(2,5)
sage: G.show(vertex_labels=False, vertex_size=0, layout='tree', tree_root=0)
```

from the combinatorial ones.

This might just be missing documentation, or an enhancement request to connect them more.

Are you looking for the following?

```
sage: T = BinaryTrees(15).random_element()
sage: T.to_undirected_graph().show(vertex_labels=False, vertex_size=0, layout='tree', tree_root=0)
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 15 graphics primitives
```

Yes, something like that.  But for some reason not every tree from the combinat had this in the tab-completion.

```
sage: R = RootedTree([[], [[]]])
sage: R.to_undirected_graph()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
AttributeError: 'RootedTrees_all_with_category.element_class' object has no attribute 'to_undirected_graph'
```

Since I was looking for a rooted tree, this seemed like something to try ...

Anyway, I'm not necessarily suggesting this is an actual code thing, maybe documentation.  Then again, I don't see why a tree couldn't be a tree.

We could have a true tree backend in graphs with implementation of dedicated algorithms and connected to trees in combinat. We already have `BipartiteGraph`...
