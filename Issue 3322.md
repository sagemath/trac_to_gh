Using -j with make for python seems to be fixed.  It passes stress tests on both my machine and sage-math.  The spkg is based off of the one in #3318 and is located at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/gfurnish/spkg/python-2.5.2.p1.spkg

A properly updated spkg is at:

Since this is Gary's fix I give it a positive review. I did multiple runs with "-j64".

Cheers,
