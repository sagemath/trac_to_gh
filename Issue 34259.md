duplicate of #34537

let's re-purpose it to disallow system Pari 2.15.* until we have a fix for giac.

Could we close this ticket and proceed with #34537?

I'd say #34496 should depend on this one. In the branch of #34496 you can just increase the value of `SAGE_PARI_MAXVER`. (the latter might be useful later on, with emergence of yet another incompatible pari version)
