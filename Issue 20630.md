# Issue 20630: SU(3,3) does not inherit from FinitelyGeneratedMatrixGroup_gap

There is a useful method `as_permutation_group` implemented in `sage.groups.matrix_gps.finitely_generated.FinitelyGeneratedMatrixGroup_gap` but that it is not available for some group (because they do not inherit from it). Namely

```
sage: S3 = SU(3,3)
sage: from sage.groups.matrix_gps.finitely_generated import FinitelyGeneratedMatrixGroup_gap
sage: isinstance(S3, FinitelyGeneratedMatrixGroup_gap)
False
```


see the original report in [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/AKtDR3HnHL4).

I guess it happened when there was a (partial) redesign using libGAP instead of GAP.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Added to the finite matrix groups constructed using GAP.

Could you replace 'integer q' with
'prime power q' in SU docs (and perhaps
in other similar places)?

the following looks like a similar weirdness:

```
sage: from sage.groups.matrix_gps.finitely_generated import FinitelyGeneratedMatrixGroup_g
....: ap
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['H',3])
sage: G = W.as_matrix_group()
sage: isinstance(G,FinitelyGeneratedMatrixGroup_gap)
False
```


Not sure if it's equally easy to fix.

otherwise, good to go.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

That one might be a little harder to fix, but we can do that on a followup.
