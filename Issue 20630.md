CC:  dimpase mmarco tscrim

There is a useful method `as_permutation_group` implemented in `sage.groups.matrix_gps.finitely_generated.FinitelyGeneratedMatrixGroup_gap` but that it is not available for some group (because they do not inherit from it). Namely

```
sage: S3 = SU(3,3)
sage: from sage.groups.matrix_gps.finitely_generated import FinitelyGeneratedMatrixGroup_gap
sage: isinstance(S3, FinitelyGeneratedMatrixGroup_gap)
False
```

I guess it happened when there was a (partial) redesign using libGAP instead of GAP.

the following looks like a similar weirdness:

```
sage: from sage.groups.matrix_gps.finitely_generated import FinitelyGeneratedMatrixGroup_g
....: ap
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['H',3])
sage: G = W.as_matrix_group()
sage: isinstance(G,FinitelyGeneratedMatrixGroup_gap)
False
```


Not sure if it's equally easy to fix.

otherwise, good to go.
