It's certainly better to make different tickets to avoid conflicts since we will touch different modules. Furthermore, we can take the opportunity to improve some codes. For instance in `src/sage/numerical/optimize.py`, the `binpacking` method needs some polishing.

We have added parameter `solver` to all calls to `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`. The last possible improvement is to allow to give the parameters `solver` and `verbose` to methods calling methods calling methods calling `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`. For instance, method `is_hamiltonian` calls `traveling_salesman_problem` without allowing to give the parameters.
Do you think we should (try to) do it ? I don't know to trace calls to methods...

no typo here? this looks scary...

one way would be to add print statements and then watch doctests failing...

Probably there are some static code analysis tools to help here too, but I'm no expert in these.
