Well, I don't see us documenting use of GitHub Desktop in our manuals.
The official command-line interface does have special standing.

Documenting use of the github-cli has an important function for the proposed transition to GitHub: To alleviate concerns that developers are "forced" to interact with a website.

I started using `gh` only recently, and still don't know about those powerful alternatives except github web interface (I don't feel like searching for them, yet).

Promoting `gh` as a development prerequisite seems too much to me. But as  `gh`, along with `git`, will be the official tool (I hope) with which we document the development workflow with github, it seems appropriate to advertise `gh` and offer an installation guide. So

+1 to adding dummy package `github-cli`.

+1 to removing `github-cli` from `_develop/dependencies`. 

We may add a new dummy package `_develop_extras` and add `github-cli` to it.
