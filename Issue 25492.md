With Pynac-0.7.23 the pattern matcher can return all solutions of a matching problem. This ticket adds interface (preferably `ex.match(pat, all=True)`), documentation, and doctests (both in the member docs and the `tests/` file).

Examples:

```
sage: (a+b+c).match(w0+w1+w2, all=True)
[{$0: b, $2: c, $1: a},
 {$0: a, $2: c, $1: b},
 {$0: c, $2: b, $1: a},
 {$0: c, $2: a, $1: b},
 {$0: a, $2: b, $1: c},
 {$0: b, $2: a, $1: c}]

sage: (a+b+c).match(w0+w1, all=True)
[{$0: a + b, $1: c},
 {$0: a + c, $1: b},
 {$0: b + c, $1: a},
 {$0: c, $1: a + b},
 {$0: b, $1: a + c},
 {$0: a, $1: b + c}]
```

This adds the interface, a snippet about the keyword, and extensive testing under `tests/`. Suggestions on how to write doctests that both pass regardless of order AND are easily understandable for the beginner are highly welcomed.
