The branch perform various cleaning to `alternating_sign_matrix.py`
- defines properly the methods `first()` and `last()`
- much faster `gyration_orbit`
- get rid of `nw_corner_sum` (so that computing the height function has complexity n<sup>2</sup> and not n<sup>4</sup>)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23530
