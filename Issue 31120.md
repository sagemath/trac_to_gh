So we're going to have the version recorded in another non-auto-generated file?

This file needs to be there at the time that one would prepare an `sdist` of the Sage library - which is by the end of `bootstrap`. 
In the current implementation, all version files are updated using this script and checked in to git by the release manager when preparing a release.

Should the symlink `build/pkgs/sagelib/src/VERSION.txt` point to `SAGE_ROOT/src/VERSION.txt`? Or maybe to `../package-version.txt`? Right now it's pointing to the nonexistent `SAGE_ROOT/src/package-version.txt`.

In the `sage-update-version` script, the file `SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/VERSION.txt` is written. Should that instead be `SAGE_ROOT/src/VERSION.txt`?

I'm basically really confused about the different version files.
