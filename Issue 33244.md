Is it possible to update the help description, by removing the upgrade option description, since the upgrade option is obsolete?

Thanks for having opened this ticket. 
The ticket's `branch`  field is devoted to the new piece of code that actually fixes the issue.

Sage 9.5 has already been released (on 30 January), so it is too late for that. If someone fixes the issue, it will be effective in Sage 9.6.

The mention of `--upgrade` is removed from `sage --help` and `sage --advanced` in the submitted branch.
