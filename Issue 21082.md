I reviewed the ticket and pushed three reviewer commits, please cross-review.

Some minor remarks:

1. Please fix pyflakes issues outlined by the patchbot plugin

2. `RecognizableSeries.__eq__`, last test: what is supposed to happen here? Is `x` defined?

3. `RecognizableSeries.__ne__`, one-sentence description: I think that the one-sentence description has been copied from `__eq__` unchanged.

`@`chapoton: Thank you for fixing these issues. From my side, everything is fine now; the question is whether you reviewed my reviewer commits [​0d0142a](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=0d0142a560d9904494581f229d5a4eb6bcccb205), [dec24ac](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=dec24accd7e679bf7156c16edc79f9925bce82c1), [671dd66](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=671dd6688931b5c598bb7ab8f8b4338b13bfdaf1), in which case this ticket could be set to positive.
