Some minor remarks:

1. Please fix pyflakes issues outlined by the patchbot plugin

2. `RecognizableSeries.__eq__`, last test: what is supposed to happen here? Is `x` defined?

3. `RecognizableSeries.__ne__`, one-sentence description: I think that the one-sentence description has been copied from `__eq__` unchanged.
