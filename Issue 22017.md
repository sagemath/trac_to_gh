# Issue 22017: Speedup computation of bridges

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22254

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2017-01-25 12:32:29

The new implementation is much faster. In addition, we add parameter `labels` allowing to return bridges without edge labels.


```
```

After:

```
sage: g = 2*graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.add_edge(1,10)
sage: g.bridges()
[(1, 10, None)]
sage: %timeit G.bridges()
1000 loops, best of 3: 198 Âµs per loop
```

Just remove the period at the end of the `INPUT:` item, and then you can set a positive review on my behalf.
