# Issue 17372: let cvxopt correctly install spkg docs

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: github/kcrisman

Original creation time: 2015-01-09 02:55:37

According to a bug report, 

> When installing cvxopt with the environment variable SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS set to "yes", the install fails. This is due to a bug in spkg-install. On the last-but-one line of that file, it attempts to copy the docs from build/html to the install directory; however, the (pre-built) docs are in html/, not in build/html/. Changing this line fixes the bug.

Unfortunately I don't think I had a name of the person who gave the report.  I guess I wrote the patch :)
