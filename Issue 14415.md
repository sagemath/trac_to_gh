NetworkX should have a pretty decent test for distance regular graphs. Could you perhaps just verify the performance of yours vs NetworkX?

Also is there a chance we would want to have a certificate for this function as well?

what do you mean by "certificate"?

There is in fact an algebraic certificate of distance regularity, that is, the adjacency matrix A_k of the distance k graph of the original graph G is a polynomial in A_1 (the adjacency matrix of G). And these polynomials can be computed from the "intersection arrays". But that's a long story.

(analog of k, lambda, mu for strongly regular graphs). E.g. GRAPE, a GAP package, does the following:

and how about `local parameters`: i.e. computing parameters w.r.t. just 1 vertex?
This would also allow to return a certificate of non-distance-regularity, i.e. either a vertex for which parameters don't exist, or two vertices with different parameters (for the latter, you can test on complete bipartite graphs with parts of unequal size).

Oh. Well, we do not have a "distance all vertices" method at Python level, which would return the kind of information you want, though we have it in the backends

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/base/c_graph.html#sage.graphs.base.c_graph.CGraphBackend.shortest_path_all_vertices

We could return as a NO-certificate a pair of vertices that do not have the same "local parameters", as you say. And I would probably change the output so that it returns a pair, `(True/False, certificate)` instead.

Do you think that it would be useful to expose this `distance_all_vertices` method at Python level ? And/or only `shortest_path_all_vertices` ? I don't really like it myself, but if you think that it would be useful ...

a few details:

Yoooooooooooooo !!

> * needs to be rebased (HUNK)


Done !

> * a typo in the doc `;;` instead of `::`


Done !

Done ! It was enough to change the `<= 2` to a `<= 1` in the beginning `;-)`

> * you should say in the doc that distance-regular means **regular** + the distance condition


Well, regularity is implied by distance regularity, for if a graph is distance-regular all vertices have "the same number of vertices at distance 1" (i.e. neighbors). I made that clear in an additional sentence of documentation.

> * missing spaces before and after `==`


Fixed. In the whole file.

I also noticed that there was an ugly segfault produced when the graph was disconnected. In this case, the "distance" between the two vertices is reported as 65536, but I try to write that in a the 65536th cell of a C array that may be much shorter. I began to write a proper fix to only run this method on connected graphs, and the method would have called itself on each connected component if the graph was not connected from the beginning, but I gave up this approach as it wouldd have added 15 lines of "details" to a code which isn't that clear already. Hence I chosed the lazy approach, which thanks to branch prediction in our CPU may not be that bad.

And it can be changed, if this is a problem later on.

Here it is ! Former rebased patch, and the answer to your remarks.

Thaaaaaaaaaanks !

I just checked this out, and the definition is not right.
With such a definition e.g. every vertex-transitive graph is 
distance-regular, and this is clearly nonsense! I wish I had time to look at this 6 months ago :-(

An example of a graph on 12 vertices which satisfies the wrong definition here, but is not distance-regular, can be constructed using GRAPE (a package of GAP included in Sage). It's vertex-transitive (and even edge-transitive) bipartite graph of diameter 3, which is not distance-regular. Some vertices (e.g. 1 and 6) at distance 2 from each other have 4 common neighbours, and some (e.g. 1 and 2) only 2 common neighbours, whereas this must be a constant across all distance 2 pairs.
Here is the adjacency list (say for a doctest) of this graph (vertices from 1 to 12):

```
[ [   8,   9,  10,  11 ],
  [   7,   9,  10,  12 ],
  [   7,   8,  11,  12 ],
  [   7,   8,  11,  12 ],
  [   7,   9,  10,  12 ],
  [   8,   9,  10,  11 ],
  [   2,   3,   4,   5 ],
  [   1,   3,   4,   6 ],
  [   1,   2,   5,   6 ],
  [   1,   2,   5,   6 ],
  [   1,   3,   4,   6 ],
  [   2,   3,   4,   5 ] ]
```

and this is the GAP computation

```
$ sage -gap
...
gap> LoadPackage("grape");
gap> gamma := JohnsonGraph(4,2);;                                     
gap> B:=BipartiteDouble(gamma);; 
gap> GlobalParameters(B);
[ [ 0, 0, 4 ], [ 1, 0, 3 ], [ -1, 0, -1 ], [ 4, 0, 0 ] ]
gap> a:=AutGroupGraph(B);;
gap> Orbits(a,[1..12]);
[ [ 1, 2, 7, 5, 3, 8, 12, 4, 6, 11, 9, 10 ] ]
gap> ha:=Stabilizer(a,1);;
gap> Orbits(ha,[1..12]);
[ [ 1 ], [ 2, 5, 3, 4 ], [ 6 ], [ 7, 12 ], [ 8, 9, 10, 11 ] ]
gap> List([1..12],x->Adjacency(B,x));
[ [ 8, 9, 10, 11 ], [ 7, 9, 10, 12 ], [ 7, 8, 11, 12 ], [ 7, 8, 11, 12 ], [ 7, 9, 10, 12 ], [ 8, 9, 10, 11 ], [ 2, 3, 4, 5 ], [ 1, 3, 4, 6 ], 
  [ 1, 2, 5, 6 ], [ 1, 2, 5, 6 ], [ 1, 3, 4, 6 ], [ 2, 3, 4, 5 ] ]
