Keywords: NormalFan, polytope

As an example, create the polytope on p.193 of Ziegler's "Lectures on Polytopes" with its normal fan:

```
sage: V=[(-8,-4),(-8,6),(-4,-8),(0,-9),(0,6),(4,-8)]
sage: P=Polyhedron(V)
sage: L=LatticePolytope(V)
sage: FanP, FanL = NormalFan(P), NormalFan(L)
sage: FanP == FanL
True
```


The two fans are equal, but they are not the same as the one presented in Ziegler's book.
In fact, following to the definition there, `FanP` and `FanL` give the normal fan of `-P`.

The construction of `NormalFan(polytope)` uses the normal vectors of the facets, given by `polytope.facet_normals()` for a `LatticePolytope` 
or given by `ieq.A() for ieq in polytope.inequalities()` for a `Polyhedron`.
In both cases, the normal vectors obtained are directed towards the interior of the polytope. 
Therefore, the resulting fan differs from what would be obtained when using the outer normal vectors instead.

I propose to add to `NormalFan` an argument `direction` set to either `'outer'` or `'inner'` to determine which of the directions to use. 
In line with the definition in Ziegler's book, I would prefer to make `'outer'` the default choice.

Additionally, I propose to add in `sage.geometry.polyhedron.representation` a method `Inequality.outer_normal`.
This allows to obtain the outer normal vector without having to think about the appropriate sign of `Inequality.A()` whenever dealing with the facet inequalities of a polyhedron.

I would leave the default as it is and add the `direction` argument to allow to get the variant.

This seems to already be possible for `Polyhedron` objects:


```
sage: p = polytopes.regular_polygon(5)
sage: p.vertices()
(A vertex at (0.5877852522924731?, -0.8090169943749474?),
 A vertex at (0.9510565162951536?, 0.3090169943749474?),
 A vertex at (0, 1),
 A vertex at (-0.5877852522924731?, -0.8090169943749474?),
 A vertex at (-0.9510565162951536?, 0.3090169943749474?))
sage: (-p).vertices()
(A vertex at (-0.5877852522924731?, 0.8090169943749474?),
 A vertex at (-0.9510565162951536?, -0.3090169943749474?),
 A vertex at (0, -1),
 A vertex at (0.587785252292474?, 0.8090169943749474?),
 A vertex at (0.9510565162951536?, -0.3090169943749474?))
```


Or you have something else in mind?

Yes, I would use `NormalFan(-P)`  or `NormalFan(P)` depending on whether one wants the inner or outer. This seems like the easiest thing to do. One does not need to go into the `Polyhedron` constructor...

I believe that the proposed change would be in the method `.normal_fan()` of `Polyhedron` objects, and not at the level of `NormalFan`, for the reason you mention.

That said, I would change the description of the ticket as follows:

> I propose to add to `normal_fan` an argument direction set to either `'outer'` or `'inner'` to determine which of the directions to use. The default will stay inner in order to match the default of `NormalFan`.

This is good to me.

Further, I would suggest to add 

> Use `NormalFan(-P)` to get the outer normal fan.

in the documentation of `NormalFan`.

Yes. I stumbled upon this inner-outer issue through `Polyhedron.normal_fan()`. This is why I added jipilab in CC in the first place, and this is where I should have proposed to make `'outer'` the default – my bad. I'm fine with `'inner'` as default in both files. My main goal was easier access to outer normal fans, which is now available and explained in the docstrings.

- Further, it would be nice to disallow such things:

```
sage: outer_nf = p.normal_fan(direction='blabla')
```

   by checking that direction is one of the two allowed things (see the volume function for a similar handling).

- Remove the space before the semi-colon in the docstring of `normal_fan`.

I added a 2-d example testing inner, outer, and an invalid direction.

Great!

Could you do one change: the backtick in the error message should be a single quote.

I would also fix the title of the ticket and the description to reflect the actual changes involved.
