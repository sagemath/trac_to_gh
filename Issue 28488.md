Keywords: polytopes, lawerence

The methods `lawrence extension` and `lawrence_polytope` `of Polyhedron` do not work when the backend is `field`.


```
P = Polyhedron([[1,3], [3,4]], backend="field")
P.lawrence_extension([10,20])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
