CC:  slelievre

Keywords: groups

When running the following code in Sage 9.2


```
G = AbelianGroup(2, gens_orders=[16, 16])
f0,f1 = G.gens()

H = G.subgroup ([f0*f1^3])

f0*f1^2 in H
f0 in H
```


the last line raised a TypeError (note that the previous line correctly determines that the other element is not in the subgroup):



```
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```


The error seems to come from the `__contains__` method of `src/sage/groups/abelian_gps/abelian_group.py` (around line 1715), in particular the `if-else` statements of lines 1740-1743.

Here is a branch that implements the patch. I made a few reviewer changes: I kept some of the original code at the start of the method, I added some import statements, and I think the doctest was wrong (the correct answer is `False`, not `True`).

The other option would be to fix the bug in the original code. However, I think it makes sense to use this simpler code (which delegates the work to ZZ-module methods), because it is easier to understand and to maintain.

The example from this ticket should probably be added as an additional doctest, but I forgot to do that. I am setting to "needs review" to start getting comments from humans and patchbots.  I will do the review myself if we don't hear from anyone.

Hi Dave,

Thanks for turning this into a git branch and making sure that the non algorithmic part of the code like the `is_instance` check are still there. And indeed you are right it should return False.

Is there a reason to do the imports inside of the function and not at the top of the file? Was there a problem with circular imports?

The following suggestions are to

- use Sage preparsing of `^` to `**` in doctests,
- use `b` rather than `Zmstar.gen(1)`,
- rename `Zmstar` to `G`,
- increase test density.


```diff
-            sage: Zmstar.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2, [4, 576])
+            sage: G.<a,b> = AbelianGroup(2, [4, 576])
-            sage: Hgens =  [a**2,a*b**2]
+            sage: Hgens = [a^2, a*b^2]
-            sage: g = Zmstar.gen(1)**3
-            sage: g in H
-            False
-            sage: a^3*b^2 in H
-            True
+            sage: [g in H for g in (a^3, b^2, b^3, a^3*b^2)]
+            [False, False, False, True]
```



```diff
-            sage: f0*f1^2 in H
-            False
-            sage: f0 in H
-            False
+            sage: [g in H for g in (f0, f0*f1^2, f0*f1^3, f0*f1^4)]
+            [False, False, True, False]
```


Another cosmetic change I would make, but maybe my pep8 is off:

```diff
-            gens_basis = matrix(
-                ZZ, len(self._gens), len(amb_inv), [g.list() for g in self._gens]
-                )
+            gens_basis = matrix(ZZ, len(self._gens), len(amb_inv),
+                                [g.list() for g in self._gens])
```

I think this update implements all of the suggestions.

I also broke two lines that were more than 80 characters, and added a check for whether "junk" is in H in the first test, because the method should not choke on stupid input.

And I added the last example of comment:9 as another test. I think that example is very strong evidence that this ticket takes the right approach by getting rid of code duplication.

I apologize for the python style errors -- I am not fluent.  PEP8 says "Imports are always put at the top of the file..." so I moved them there.  It also says "The closing brace/bracket/parenthesis on multi-line constructs may either line up under the first non-whitespace character of the last line of list ... or it may be lined up under the first character of the line that starts the multi-line construct ...".
