applying this patch and doing `./sage -docbuild reference texinfo` leaves a `.texi` file and a `Makefile` in each directory below `SAGEROOT/local/share/doc/sage/texinfo/en/reference`.  Issuing `make` in each directory then creates a beautiful `.info` file, which can be visited in emacs using `C-u C-h i filename`.

Currently I do not know how to make sage `make` the `.info` files itself, and I do not know how `sage-shell-mode` could display them.

I am having some problems with the texinfo-hyperlinks.  For example, in

```
 sage: ASM = AlternatingSignMatrices(3)
```

the `(3)` is interpreted as a link to a footnote.  The corresponding bit of the texinfo source looks OK, though: 

```
`@`geindex from_contre_tableau() (sage.combinat.alternating_sign_matrix.AlternatingSignMatrices method)
`@`anchor{sage/combinat/alternating_sign_matrix sage combinat alternating_sign_matrix AlternatingSignMatrices from_contre_tableau}`@`anchor{227}
`@`deffn {Method} from_contre_tableau (comps)

Return an alternating sign matrix from a contre-tableau.

EXAMPLES:

`@`example
sage: ASM = AlternatingSignMatrices(3)
sage: ASM.from_contre_tableau([[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1]])
[0 0 1]
[0 1 0]
[1 0 0]
sage: ASM.from_contre_tableau([[1, 2, 3], [2, 3], [3]])
[1 0 0]
[0 1 0]
[0 0 1]
`@`end example
`@`end deffn
```

in the standalone info program, this problem does not appear.  There are some hints in the Sphinx FAQ http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/faq.html#texinfo-info but I do not see why they would apply.

Thank you for the patch. I attended a conference this week and will try the patch when I go back home.

Florent, if you could help with the problem reported at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sphinx-users/-8cHf1ZD5S4 that would be great.  This seems very much related to #9128!

Dear Sho,

unfortunately, I still have no clue how to enable the crossreferences between the individual manuals.  I asked on the sphinx user group https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sphinx-users/-8cHf1ZD5S4 and also on the sphinx github page https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/3089, but have not got any response so far.

meanwhile, I discovered `SAGEROOT/src/doc/common/conf.py`, which contains the call `app.connect('missing-reference', find_sage_dangling_links)`.

I suspect that this (I mean `find_sage_dangling_links`) is where I should put the proper handling for texinfo crossreferences, but I'm not sure yet...

It is already convenient to view Sage document via info. Thank you very much. Concerning with sphinx, I cannot help you, sorry.

The reference manual doesn't build for me (html, not texinfo) without this change:

```diff
diff --git a/src/doc/en/reference/conf.py b/src/doc/en/reference/conf.py
index 5c7bbe95ec..22961d90ae 100644
--- a/src/doc/en/reference/conf.py
+++ b/src/doc/en/reference/conf.py
`@``@` -67,7 +67,7 `@``@` latex_elements['preamble'] += r'''
 # `@`end direntry
 
 texinfo_documents = [
-('index', name, title, u'The Sage Development Team', name, title, 'SageMath')
+('index', name, project, u'The Sage Development Team', name, project, 'SageMath')
 ]
 
 #Ignore all .rst in the _sage subdirectory
```

or something similar: `title` is not defined in `reference/conf.py`.

You could also consider adding a `Makefile` target:

```diff
diff --git a/build/make/deps b/build/make/deps
index 371a56a767..65ad3fdc07 100644
--- a/build/make/deps
+++ b/build/make/deps
`@``@` -247,6 +247,8 `@``@` doc-src-clean:
 doc-output-clean:
        rm -rf "$(SAGE_SHARE)/doc/sage"
 
+doc-texinfo: $(DOC_DEPENDENCIES)
+       $(AM_V_at)cd ../.. && sage-logger -p './sage --docbuild all texinfo $(SAGE_DOCBUILD_OPTS)' logs/doctexinfo.log
 
 ###############################################################################
 # Cleaning up
```

(After doing this, `make doc-texinfo` fails for me when building the developer's guide, by the way.) Then someone who is better at `make` than I am could possibly add a target to run `make` in all of the subdirectories of `local/share/doc/sage/texinfo`. It could be a bit of a mess, but we could instead set `$infodir` to point to `local/share/info` and then run `make install-info` instead of `make`. The problem is that `texinfo/de/tutorial/sagetutorial.texi` and `texinfo/en/tutorial/sagetutorial.texi` will produce `.info` files of the same name. Does `info` handle subdirectories well? Should we have `local/share/info/de/` or `local/share/info/sage/de/`, etc.? The Sage reference manual will also consist of lots of separate `.info` files; how should those be handled?

Thank you for looking into this!

I'm afraid, however, that there is a shostopper: I couldn't get the links between the individual texinfo files to work. I filed https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/3089 but it was closed.  The advice was: "Please integrate your project into single one."

It may well be that I misunderstood the whole thing - but as far as I could tell at the time, the sage documentation consists of many subprojects, one for each folder below `src/sage`.  If that's not the case, that would be great and I'd be happy to learn more about it!
