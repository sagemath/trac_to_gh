applying this patch and doing `./sage -docbuild reference texinfo` leaves a `.texi` file and a `Makefile` in each directory below `SAGEROOT/local/share/doc/sage/texinfo/en/reference`.  Issuing `make` in each directory then creates a beautiful `.info` file, which can be visited in emacs using `C-u C-h i filename`.

Currently I do not know how to make sage `make` the `.info` files itself, and I do not know how `sage-shell-mode` could display them.

I am having some problems with the texinfo-hyperlinks.  For example, in

```
 sage: ASM = AlternatingSignMatrices(3)
```

the `(3)` is interpreted as a link to a footnote.  The corresponding bit of the texinfo source looks OK, though: 

```
@geindex from_contre_tableau() (sage.combinat.alternating_sign_matrix.AlternatingSignMatrices method)
@anchor{sage/combinat/alternating_sign_matrix sage combinat alternating_sign_matrix AlternatingSignMatrices from_contre_tableau}@anchor{227}
@deffn {Method} from_contre_tableau (comps)

Return an alternating sign matrix from a contre-tableau.

EXAMPLES:

@example
sage: ASM = AlternatingSignMatrices(3)
sage: ASM.from_contre_tableau([[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1]])
[0 0 1]
[0 1 0]
[1 0 0]
sage: ASM.from_contre_tableau([[1, 2, 3], [2, 3], [3]])
[1 0 0]
[0 1 0]
[0 0 1]
@end example
@end deffn
```

Dear Sho,

unfortunately, I still have no clue how to enable the crossreferences between the individual manuals.  I asked on the sphinx user group https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sphinx-users/-8cHf1ZD5S4 and also on the sphinx github page https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/3089, but have not got any response so far.

meanwhile, I discovered `SAGEROOT/src/doc/common/conf.py`, which contains the call `app.connect('missing-reference', find_sage_dangling_links)`.

I suspect that this (I mean `find_sage_dangling_links`) is where I should put the proper handling for texinfo crossreferences, but I'm not sure yet...

Thank you for looking into this!

I'm afraid, however, that there is a shostopper: I couldn't get the links between the individual texinfo files to work. I filed https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/3089 but it was closed.  The advice was: "Please integrate your project into single one."

It may well be that I misunderstood the whole thing - but as far as I could tell at the time, the sage documentation consists of many subprojects, one for each folder below `src/sage`.  If that's not the case, that would be great and I'd be happy to learn more about it!
