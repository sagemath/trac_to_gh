# Issue 27904: q(n)-crystal on shifted primed tableaux

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28141

Currently crystals.ShiftedPrimedTableaux implements a gl(n)-crystal structure on shifted primed tableaux. The goal of this ticket is to upgrade this to a slightly more general q(n)-crystal structure. This involves implementing one additional set of "queer" crystal operators and a "queer" crystal tensor product rule.

The merging on trac is less forgiving than on our computers. Trivial rebase.

Too late, but this :

```
if len(two_primes) == 0:
```

could have been simplified to

```
if not two_primes:
```

which is faster.
