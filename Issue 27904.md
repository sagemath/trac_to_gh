Currently crystals.ShiftedPrimedTableaux implements a gl(n)-crystal structure on shifted primed tableaux. The goal of this ticket is to upgrade this to a slightly more general q(n)-crystal structure. This involves implementing one additional set of "queer" crystal operators and a "queer" crystal tensor product rule.

could have been simplified to

```
if not two_primes:
```

which is faster.
