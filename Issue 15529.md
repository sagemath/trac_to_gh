# Issue 15529: sage-spkg can show harmless "mv" error

The `mv` command in

```
if [ "$USE_LOCAL_SCRIPTS" = yes ]; then
    mv "${PKG_NAME_UPSTREAM%.tar*}" src
    cd ..
    echo "Finished set up"
else
```

can sometimes give an error which is harmless. So we should silence this error. We can also remove the extra `cd ..` command.
