The documentation of the function **monomial_all_divisors** states that the function 
"Return a list of all monomials that divide" the input.

The polynomial 1 is considered as a monomial dividing any monomial but is not returned by **monomial_all_divisors** (see code below for an example).

```
x,v=var('x,y')
R = ZZ['x,y']

one = R(1)
m = R(x*y^2)

print "1 is a monomial: ", one.is_monomial()
print "1 divides m:", R.monomial_divides (one, m)
print "List of monomial divisors of m:", R.monomial_all_divisors(m)
print "Is 1 in it:", one in R.monomial_all_divisors(m)
