Keywords: cygwin peflags

By default the max heap memory available to processes is quite low on Cygwin (about 500MB) so that doctests requiring more memory than that will fail (typically doctests using PARI which doubles its memory when its not sufficient anymore, so you basically jump from 256MB to 512MB and boom).

Why "document" and not "fix"?

This isn't really an issue on Cygwin 64.  It is more of an issue on 32-bit Windows where addressing is much more constrained.

I think issues like this with PARI have been mostly fixed, or at least worked around (e.g. #20463).  It might still be a problem on 32-bit Cygwin but that is not likely to ever work.
