The problem looks to be the following race condition in the matplotlib code:

```
    if not os.path.exists(texcache):
        os.mkdir(texcache)
```

This is a regression introduced by #10588, previously fixed in John's spkg from #10159, because the spkg of the former had not been based on the latter (and the bug hasn't [yet] been fixed upstream, at least not in 1.0.1).
 
Also, the current spkg is full of crap in `src/build/`. (The whole directory can be deleted.)

It's different to what I first thought; see my previous comment... ;-)

With a bit of luck your patches from #10159 still apply seamlessly to the current upstream version; haven't tested that yet.

Hmmm, a little work has to be done:

```sh
~/Sage/spkgs/matplotlib-1.0.1.p1/patches$ patch __init__.py < __init__.py.patch 
patching file __init__.py
Hunk #1 succeeded at 103 with fuzz 2.
~/Sage/spkgs/matplotlib-1.0.1.p1/patches$ patch finance.py < finance.py.patch 
patching file finance.py
Hunk #1 FAILED at 4.
Hunk #2 succeeded at 173 (offset 4 lines).
1 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file finance.py.rej
~/Sage/spkgs/matplotlib-1.0.1.p1/patches$ patch texmanager.py < texmanager.py.patch 
patching file texmanager.py
$
```

John, are you going to do this?

Is this normal?

```

I do have `pkg-config` installed, and `$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/pkgconfig/libpng12.pc` (target of a symbolic link `libpng.pc`) looks like this:

```
...

Description: Loads and saves PNG files
Version: 1.2.35

So maybe either `pkg-config` or MPL is confused by the "wrong" `Name: `, since we patch MPL's `setupext.py`:

On my OS X box, I see the same thing with the old 1.0.1 and with the new one:

```
REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES
                 numpy: 1.5.1
             freetype2: found, but unknown version (no pkg-config)

                libpng: found, but unknown version (no pkg-config)
```
I see that on linux, or at least on sage.math, it reports the correct version for these.

I can

- apply the patch to `setupext.py` only on Darwin.
- apply the patch always, but add an `if ... then ... else` so it only does something different on Darwin.

Opinions?

I'll certainly add freetype and patch to the dependencies.

I think modifying the patch is easier, but do what you prefer.

Note that the change should only be made if the OS is Darwin **and** `pkg-config` is **not** installed, since Sage's `libpng*.pc` contains

```

{{{#!sh

	    command -v pkg-config || patch -p1 < "$patch"
}}}
I see you've redirected the output of `command` to `/dev/null` in the actual patch.

IMHO a bit more readable would be

```sh
    if [ "$UNAME" = Darwin ] && ! command -v pkg-config >/dev/null; then
        patch -p1 < "$patch" # Apply only on Darwin if pkg-config isn't installed
    fi
```
but for simplicity (if you're not going to change the patch) I would move the specific patch to `patches/Darwin/` and do the following:

```sh
# Apply patches for all platforms.  See SPKG.txt for why and what.
for patch in ../patches/*.patch; do
    patch -p1 <"$patch"
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo >&2 "Error applying '$patch'"
        exit 1
    fi
done

# Apply patch(es) for Darwin.
if [ "$UNAME" = Darwin ]; then
    for patch in ../patches/Darwin/*.patch; do
        patch -p1 <"$patch"
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo >&2 "Error applying '$patch'"
            exit 1
        fi
    done
fi
```
(The latter would have to be changed from a loop to an `if`-statement depending on `command -v ...` if we only apply the single patch and don't test for `pkg-config` in the patch itself, i.e., from Python.)

Having the patch in a separate directory it's also immediately clear that it is platform-specific; unfortunately we here have another precondition.

Yep, apparently by `sage-location`, during the build.

If I reinstall `libpng12`, and then MPL, everything is fine.

The offending line was

```
SAGE_ROOT=${SAGE_ROOT}
```
`SAGE_ROOT=/the/appropriate/absolute/path` works. I have no idea why `pkg-config` doesn't take `$SAGE_ROOT` from the environment if it isn't defined in the `.pc` file itself; it IMHO used to -- last year, but meanwhile doesn't ... 8/

I.e.,

```
prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}
```
does no longer work unless `SAGE_ROOT` is also defined in the `.pc` file itself.

We may have to really wrap `pkg-config` in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin` with

```sh
#!/bin/sh

if [ -z "$SAGE_ROOT" ]; then
    echo >&2 "Error: $0: SAGE_ROOT not defined."
    exit 1
fi

exec /usr/bin/env PATH=`echo $PATH | sed -e "s|$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin:||"` \
    pkg-config --define-variable=SAGE_ROOT="$SAGE_ROOT" "$@"
```
(Or just call the system's `pkg-config` *without* `--define-variable ...` if `SAGE_ROOT` is undefined.)

Defining `SAGE_ORIG_PATH` in `sage-env` wouldn't be a bad idea either.

It never did that way; I used `$${SAGE_ROOT}`.

We don't have to, and shouldn't do so (see e.g. [comment:ticket:10202:26 this comment] at #10202).




So what's the current status of this ticket?

Is the attached diff (and the spkg) still current, or did you / do you plan to make further changes to `spkg-install` (w.r.t. to applying the patches) and the `setupext.py` patch?

I think the `pkg-config` issues (on Linux) have shown to be rather unrelated to this ticket (and MPL itself), so the patch to `setupext.py` may not have to only be applied on MacOS X (if `pkg-config` is installed), though limiting its application shouldn't hurt either.

If you want to leave the code as is, I'll re-review and test it now. The only thing I noticed is that `SPKG.txt` isn't very explicit regarding the patch to `setupext.py`, i.e. what it currently exactly does and that it's indeed only applied on Darwin. I'd consider this a minor issue though.

Summarizing:

- this ticket includes most of the patches from #10159 (the missing parts are because I got tired, so I didn't fix the fact that some lines in SPKG.txt have lengths > 80).
- in SPKG.txt, the prerequisites have been updated.
- the patches now use "patch" for their application.
- the patches are divided into ones specifically for Darwin, and ones for all platforms.
- the Darwin patch passes 'libpng12' or 'libpng' to `try_pkgconfig`, depending on whether `pkg-config` is installed, instead of just always passing 'libpng12'.
- as part of the patches from #10159, the installation procedure prints Sage's setting of the variable MPLCONFIGDIR.
- the 'src' directory has been replaced with a vanilla source, downloaded 13-Aug-2011.

I rather meant noting that the patch is only applied on Darwin, and that it only changes the behaviour if `pkg-config` is not installed.

__W.r.t. why this is necessary:__

The assumption is that when `pkg-config` *is* installed, it will always pick up Sage's `libpng.pc` (which is a symbolic link to `libpng12.pc`), so MPL will always be linked to the correct, i.e. Sage's `libpng`, regardless of whether `"libpng"` or `"libpng12"` is used in `try_pkgconfig()`.

If `pkg-config` is *not* available, and you pass just `"libpng"` (without `12`) to `try_pkgconfig()`, MPL might pick up some random system `libpng` (without the `12`), which can lead to name clashes and other errors because two different `libpng`s could be linked into Sage.

So it should be pretty safe to just always pass `"libpng12"`, no matter what operating system and whether `pkg-config` is installed or not -- Sorry for the previous noise...

(On the other hand, it's also not bad to only apply such patches on [potentially] affected systems; if Sage's `libpng12` one day changes to, say, `libpng13`, we'd have to modify MPL for all systems to work. If we only used `"libpng12"` on e.g. Darwin instead, only Darwin would break on such an upgrade.)

Perhaps one should test this on other systems as well, though not really on topic of *this* ticket, i.e., I think if the list of graphics backends needs to be updated, this should be done on a follow-up, but we should IMHO check this while we're at it.

Otherwise positive review for the current spkg.

I'd also say *explicitly searches for and uses libpng12* instead of *links to ...* in the description of the patch to `setupext.py`.

Read the ticket.

This is unrelated to the MPL spkg, but due to a messed-up `libpng12.pc` file.

If you first reinstall the `libpng12` spkg, and then MPL, all should work fine.
(Or fix `local/lib/pkgconfig/libpng12.pc` manually, most probably by deleting the line `SAGE_ROOT=${SAGE_ROOT}`. Another cause can be having `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` set outside the Sage environment, which is a bug in `sage-env`, cf. also #11687.)

I don't have time to care where the bug is, only that the old spkg worked and the new one not.

If this new matplotlib spkg exposes a bug in the libpng spkg, then the new matplotlib spkg cannot be merged without fixing the libpng bug.

```

It should be obvious from a first glance that we ran into similar and discussed this on the ticket here.

> only that the old spkg worked and the new one not.


That's simply not true, or rather an incident. Reinstalling the old spkg won't work either, at least not on all systems.

> If this new matplotlib spkg exposes a bug in the libpng spkg, then the new matplotlib spkg cannot be merged without fixing the libpng bug.


Part of the bug is caused by `sage-location` (and eventually also `sage-env`). See e.g. [comment:ticket:10202:26] for how we should IMHO fix `.pc` files w.r.t. relocation.

Nevertheless, the `libpng12` spkg could likely create symbolic links from `local/lib/libpng.{a,la,so}`, then MPL would also find it and link to it without the help of `pkg-config`.

`pkg-config` btw. should be installed on all supported platforms except Darwin.

Looks as if you do that or similar (by checking for `pkg-config` in the patch itself), though the attached diff doesn't move the patch (to `setupext.py` btw., the commit message is wrong) from `patches/Darwin/` to `patches/`.


Note that I've also made a new `libpng` spkg at #11696, which needs testing especially on Darwin.

Well, the code is only executed when MPL gets installed, and the file itself doesn't get installed anywhere AFAIK.

I see. Also the spkg is ok, so I'll give it positive review again, also based on your comment that it works on iras (which I would expect it to anyway).




> I'll fix the commit message, and I'll look at #11696 eventually.  It's easy enough for me to test on Darwin.


Perhaps on some ancient Darwin systems as well if you can.

```
...
REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES

The patched `setupext.py` in contrast seems to find it, and therefore disables the work-around for when `pkg-config` is *not* installed.

(The note *"(no pkg-config)"* also appears if `pkg-config` **is** installed, but unable to read the `.pc` file, e.g. because of duplicate definitions of `SAGE_ROOT` in it.)

This AFAIK shouldn't matter (that Sage didn't build), but I'm not totally sure.

Since I assume previous versions of Sage did build for you on that machine (with an older MPL spkg), I'd use the Sage installation where it failed (i.e., Sage 4.7.2.alpha2), since the error might (at least in theory) originate from something else.

To be on the safe side, copy the downloaded package to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/` and (re)run `make`. Then Sage *should<sup>TM</sup>* pick up the new spkg with debugging. The log is then `spkg/logs/matplotlib-1.0.1.p0-debug.log`.

(In case Sage *doesn't* pick up the right one, which I don't think, you could (re)move the original MPL spkg from there. A matter of file modification times, so you could equally just `touch` the new spkg.)

To see in advance which version Sage would install, do

```sh
$ (cd $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/ && ./newest_version matplotlib)
```

Hahaha, my guess was right:

```
...
has_pkgconfig(): trying 'pkg-config --help'...
has_pkgconfig(): command exited with 34304.
Output is:
Usage: pkg-config [OPTION...]
  --version                                      output version of pkg-config
  --modversion                                   output version for package
  --atleast-pkgconfig-version=VERSION            sh: line 1: 16589 Abort trap              pkg-config --help
has_pkgconfig(): returning False.
...
add_png_flags(): Sage: 'pkg-config' is in PATH, not trying to use work-around.
...
```

Johan, can you give the output of

```sh
$ pkg-config --version ; echo $?

$ pkg-config --help ; echo $?

```
?

For the record, I have a [(preliminary) MPL 1.0.1.p1 spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/matplotlib-1.0.1.p1.spkg) fixing this, which Johan already tested.

I'll open a follow-up for that one at some uncertain point in the future... (Remind me of that in case nothing should happen for a while.) ;-)
