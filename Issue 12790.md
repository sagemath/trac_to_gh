Keywords: plot, linestyle, color

The code `plot([x,x^ 2],-.2,2)` is a nice shortcut for plotting both x and x!^ 2 on the same graph. However, if you want to choose different colors or linestyles for each function, then it seems you have to execute, e.g.,


```
p1=plot(x,-.2,1.2,color='blue',linestyle='dotted'); 
p2=plot(x^2,-.2,1.2,color='red',linestyle='dashed');Â 
p1+p2
```

Here is how Maple and Mathematica handle this issue, respectively:

`[> plot([x, x^ 2], x= -.2..1.2, color=["blue", "red"],linestyle=[dot, longdash]);^

In[1]:= Plot[{x, x^2}, {x, -.2, 1.2}, PlotStyle -> {{Blue, Dotted}, {Red, Dashed}}]`^

I like what is done in this ticket. One of the first things I tried after seeing automatic colors and plots, is try to enable legend labels. I think it would be a good idea to also accept `legend_label` as a list and enable the legends in the same order as the multiple figures. Would it be too hard to do so?

On matters of code, the doctests now pass but documentation building is still a problem, with at least two plots failing. Aaron, please try building the documentation to see where the errors are.

One feature that I do not like in this branch is that `linestyle` defaults to automatic. I find solid lines much easier to read and would prefer that `linestyle` default to solid. That is in line with Mathematica behavior.

Also, if both `rgbcolor` and `color` are specified, this branch silently overrides the former with the latter. In the current version of `plot.py`, specifying both of these options leads to a `RuntimeError` coming from the current line 780:


```
@rename_keyword(color='rgbcolor')
```


I was in the future planning to remove that line and add code to raise a `ValueError` as Travis had me do in #9654. I think this branch should raise the `ValueError` rather than silently override an option, and then this decorator can be removed.

> Karl-Dieter, since you appear to be the only developer disagreeing about having automatic colors, is there some way to solicit input on this question from users? Does Sage have some sort of user mailing list for sending out questions or making announcements of this sort? What about an open question on ask.sagemath.org?

Usually in this case one of two things is done (I don't think this is an "official" policy, though):
* Ask on sage-devel if anyone cares
* Majority rule on the ticket
Sometimes it does matter enough, but even then usually on sage-devel only a few people will pipe up unless it's something that affects a fairly broad range of people.

In this case, I don't care strongly enough to block this now that several people have 'officially' weighed in (including on #8164).  You may still want to look there regarding different *options* for auto-coloring - matplotlib had a [huge and long debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU) over their new default colormap for best visualization of data.  But in any case once it's decided here, you should close #8164 as a dup.

I have no idea about what happened to the branch...strange...

My 2 cents: I think having the default linestyle being a solid color is what we should do. I haven't really looked into the code, but just having the option of providing multiple colors is a huge +1 for including this (and is a natural thing for people to try when doing multiple plots).

Karl-Dieter,
I found a nice website that will take a url and pass its content through assorted "color blind" filters. They do b&w too. Follow the instructions here: [color test](http://webpages.math.luc.edu/~lauve/scratch/color_test.html)

It seems that advancing colors on the hue scale by 1/(golden ratio) works well in all cases, so I'm going with this for now. One can always start a new ticket to implement more advanced color theory methods.

Aaron, a couple minor things:

1) When the plot/subplot is created in what is currently L1994, please use the keyword `rgbcolor`  rather than `color` for consistency with other plot files.

2) Most files I've seen in Sage don't have spaces around the equals sign when assigning keyword arguments. Please remove the extra white space for consistency with other files. 

Thanks!

A remark on the documentation fix mentioned above.
This is what I want to mimic with sphinx_plot:

```
        sage: p1 = plot([sin(x), cos(2*x)*sin(x)], -pi, pi, fill={1: [0]}, fillcolor='blue', fillalpha=.25, color='blue')
        sage: p2 = plot([sin(x), cos(2*x)*sin(x)], -pi, pi, fill={0: 1, 1:[0]}, color=['blue'])
        sage: p3 = plot([sin(x), cos(2*x)*sin(x)], -pi, pi, fill=[0, [0]], fillcolor=['#f60'], fillalpha=1, color={1: 'blue'})
        sage: p4 = plot([sin(x), cos(2*x)*sin(x)], (x,-pi, pi), fill=[0, x/pi], fillcolor='grey', color=['red', 'blue'])
        sage: graphics_array([[p1, p2], [p3, p4]]).show(frame=True, axes=False) # long time
```

I'm not quite sure how to get frame and axes options passed to sphinx_plot:

Any ideas?

`plot()` works for me with this change. Do you still consider this a problem?

Hmm,
Looking over the documentation, I see a few minor changes that I should make. I'll toggle back to needs_work. When you see it return to needs_review, I'm done.

Thx.

Aaron, you added a bit more that what's in your description: the options for `legend_color` are expanded which is good and functions as expected.

Regarding legends, for the case of multiple graph colors with a single `legend_label`, I find the empty spaces in the legend unexpected. Wouldn't it make more sense to repeat the single label for all lines? If I'm graphing multiple functions and deliberately give one label, I'd expect it to appear for all of them.

ah yes... it occurred to me that this was a natural extension of what was asked for in [comment:16]. My apologies for not mentioning it.

I don't know that I agree. I was trying to think of all the reasons I'd just include one label... "trig functions" or "cos(nx)" or some such. I don't think I'd want to see that written multiple times. Certainly, seeing "f" or "x<sup>2</sup>" written multiple times would be silly. But, it is nearly as easy to write ["trig functions", "", ""] as it is to write "trig functions", so I'm happy to modify the code accordingly.
