We fix a simple bug in our build system: 

The value of `SAGE_SUITESPARSE_LOCALINSTALL` is set in `build/pkgs/suitesparse/spkg-configure.m4` but is not actually passed on to `build/pkgs/cvxopt/spkg-install.in`.  A different variable, `SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX`, is passed by `build/bin/sage-build-env-config.in` from the configure stage to the build stage, but it is never set or used. 

```
$ git grep SAGE_SUITESPARSE
build/bin/sage-build-env-config.in:export SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX="@SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX@"
build/pkgs/cvxopt/spkg-install.in:if test "x$SAGE_SUITESPARSE_LOCALINSTALL" != "x"; then
build/pkgs/suitesparse/spkg-configure.m4:       AC_SUBST(SAGE_SUITESPARSE_LOCALINSTALL, ['$SAGE_LOCAL'])
build/pkgs/suitesparse/spkg-configure.m4:       AC_SUBST(SAGE_SUITESPARSE_LOCALINSTALL, [''])
```

As a result, `suitesparse` from `/usr/local` can leak in, as observed in #31567?replyto=25#comment:25


Clearly these two variables were intended to be the same variable. We fix this.  This unified variable, `SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX`, is analogous to other variables `SAGE_..._PREFIX`.

Why the variable name change? `SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX` doesn't contain the prefix when suitesparse from the system is being used so this *looks* wrong (why aren't we passing the prefix unconditionally?) even though it's doing the right thing.

That's right, but this matches the semantics of the other `SAGE_..._PREFIX` variables; see for example `build/pkgs/mpir/spkg-configure.m4` for `SAGE_GMP_PREFIX`.

From `build/pkgs/cvxopt/spkg-install.in`:

```
if test "x$SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX" != "x"; then
   export CVXOPT_SUITESPARSE_LIB_DIR="${SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX}"
   export CVXOPT_SUITESPARSE_INC_DIR="${SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX}/include"
fi
```

Effectively we only set these variables for cvxopt when we use suitesparse from spkg-configure.  Setting these variables disables cvxopt's use of `/usr/local` - https://github.com/cvxopt/cvxopt/blob/master/setup.py#L55

We do not need to do this when we use system suitesparse, as we do not want to claim authority that our configure script's suitesparse-finding technique is better than the one in cvxopt's install script.

Isn't it the other way around? From `build/pkgs/suitesparse/spkg-configure.m4`,

```
AS_IF([test x$sage_spkg_install_suitesparse = xyes], [
  AC_SUBST(SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX, ['$SAGE_LOCAL'])
], [
  AC_SUBST(SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX, [''])
])
```

As a result, I think this block only gets executed when `$SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX = $SAGE_LOCAL`,

```
if test "x$SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX" != "x"; then
   export CVXOPT_SUITESPARSE_LIB_DIR="${SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX}"
   export CVXOPT_SUITESPARSE_INC_DIR="${SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX}/include"
fi
```

which is why I don't think that replacing `$SAGE_LOCAL` with `$SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX` has changed anything there.
