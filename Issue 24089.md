When the untested examples in `src/sage/combinat/interval_posets.py` involving `GlobalOptions` are actually tested:

This is just the doctests being wrong, right? `ip.latex_options.color_decreasing` should be `ip.latex_options()["color_decreasing"]`? Which is also doctested in the `set_latex_options` doc. So I guess we can remove the broken doctests?

Not quite, the `latex_options()` method returns the current latex options for that specific `ip`, whereas the global options are setting the _defaults_. I think they should become `ip.options.color_decreasing` (but I haven't checked yet). They definitely should not be removed.

Note that some of them are indirectly tested in `set_latex_options` in order to show the default vs specific behavior, but the doctests for the global options is also showing how to use the global options too. So also on that basis I say they should not be removed.
