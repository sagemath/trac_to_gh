Assignee: jason, was

CC:  marc fuentes

while trying to improve the coverage of `matrix/matrix_dense.pyx`,
we noticed with Marc Fuentes that the function
`_multiply_classical` from that file is dead code.
Indeed, all instances of that function in other files are locally
defined, and it seems impossible to exhibit a test which calls that
function. We therefore propose to remove that dead code.

Indeed, after removing that function, all doctests still pass.
