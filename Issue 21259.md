`@`chapoton Thanks for the fixes. I should have caught the bad imports earlier.

I think the doctest in new_subvariety fails because J0(33).is_simple() is called elsewhere in the file. There's a warning about this situation in L3203 in abvar.py . So I changed it to J0(34) since that isn't used anywhere in the file.
