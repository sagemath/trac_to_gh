# Issue 24830: Implement quantum group q-numbers

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25067

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2018-03-31 11:52:32

CC:  sage-combinat darij aschilling bsalisbury01 andrew.mathas

Keywords: quantum groups, q-analogs

Split off of #15508 for better granularity and to use it to build other tickets. Implements `[n]_q`, `[n]_q!` and `q`-binomials that appear in quantum groups.

Discussed with Darij and says good modulo his changes, which LGTM. So positive review. Thank you!

Sorry to be late to the party but are you aware of `combinat/q_analogues.py`?  In particular, this module provides functions `q_int`, `q_factorial` and `q_binomial` (among others). I have not been through this ticket in detail but comparing the `q_int` function in this ticket appears to be less general than the existing function because, in `q_analogues.py`, `q_int(n)` allows `n` to be positive or negative whereas the `q_int` function in this ticket requires `n` to be non-negative. On the other hand, the quantum integer that the existing `q_int` returns is different to the one in this ticket. 

I am not sure how much this ticket overlaps with the code that is already in sage but some one should check. At a minimum, I think that there should be some documentation links between this code and the pre-existing code and, arguably, the code should be merged so that we don't have code providing similar functionality in different places. Different function names, or a more general syntax that allows one to choose between the different quantum integers, should also be considered. 

Annoyingly, the `q_int` defined in `q_analogues.py` is the natural quantum integer to use in Hecke algebras whereas the `q_int` defined in this ticket is what is required in the quantum group setting...so both are needed. 

As I have not read through all of the code I won't set this back to needs work but my feeling is that it does need more work.

Oh, I see that there are already documentation links, so feel free to ignore the above. This said, adding a link from the documentation in `combinat/q_analogues.py` to the code in this ticket would also be useful.
