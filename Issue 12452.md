I found that the gdmodule spkg doesn't support multiarch ; so I made a patch, based on the patch which is already used in debian. It is a clean patch, as it only triggers on debian-based systems which have already made the switch.

Why is this patch needed?  I don't have any problems building `gdmodule` on multi-arch systems.

I had a compilation issue while compiling the spkg in experimental settings ; as debian already packages this, I don't care anymore about the spkg being solid ; please close (why can't I close a ticket I opened?)
