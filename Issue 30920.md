I had some initial success by pointing VS Code (with the Remove - WSL extension) to the virtual environment created in #30371 and then simply use the builtin Jupyter support.

Does this really depend on the experimental editable install in #30371? My guess is that we can document how to do VS code things even in a standard Sage install in WSL. (see #30484)

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.

We could advertise VS Code devcontainers (#33671) as the way to do this. Very well documented and needs no command-line interaction
