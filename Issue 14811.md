# Issue 14811: Tutorial: unclear/redundant text in `latex.rst`

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15048

Original creator: mmezzarobba

CC:  rbeezer jhpalmieri

Keywords: tutorial, latex

The paragraphs "Basic MathJax functionality is largely automatic..." (line 75) and "The internal ``pretty_print()`` command illustrates..." (line 126) of `latex.rst` seem redundant to me. Is there a difference I missed? Otherwise, I suggest removing the second one.
