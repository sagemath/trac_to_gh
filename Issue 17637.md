Unless I've missed something (and I could very well have), it seems that before the latex requirements of IPython nbconvert can be nailed down one needs to install mistune. From the ipython notebook (or from a Sage shell) -- File -> Download as -> {Python,HTML,reST,PDF} from the notebook menu gives similar results:


```
%%bash

This was hinted at [here](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17897#comment:9). On my gentoo box

```

generates `plots.tex` and

```

```

generates `plots.pdf`, but I have mistune installed.

After installing mistune and looking at what's dumped in a terminal during the install of latex packages I see

```
Logfile: /64bitdev/storage/sage-git_develop/sage/local/share/texlive/install-tl.log
package extension not present in package repository.
tlmgr: package repository http://ftp.math.purdue.edu/mirrors/ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet
```

So extension is not a latex package. From a Sage shell

```
sage-ipython nbconvert  --to=latex 'plots.ipynb'
```

does generate `plots.tex`. But

```
sage-ipython nbconvert  --to=pdf 'plots.ipynb'
```

fails initially with

```
! LaTeX Error: File `xkeyval.sty' not found.
```

The usepackage(s) needed to pdflatex `plots.tex` are

```
    \usepackage{graphicx} % Used to insert images
    \usepackage{adjustbox} % Used to constrain images to a maximum size 
    \usepackage{color} % Allow colors to be defined
    \usepackage{enumerate} % Needed for markdown enumerations to work
    \usepackage{geometry} % Used to adjust the document margins
    \usepackage{amsmath} % Equations
    \usepackage{amssymb} % Equations
    \usepackage{eurosym} % defines \euro
    \usepackage[mathletters]{ucs} % Extended unicode (utf-8) support
    \usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc} % Allow utf-8 characters in the tex document
    \usepackage{fancyvrb} % verbatim replacement that allows latex
    \usepackage{grffile} % extends the file name processing of package graphics 
                         % to support a larger range 
    % The hyperref package gives us a pdf with properly built
    % internal navigation ('pdf bookmarks' for the table of contents,
    % internal cross-reference links, web links for URLs, etc.)
    \usepackage{hyperref}
    \usepackage{longtable} % longtable support required by pandoc >1.10
    \usepackage{booktabs}  % table support for pandoc > 1.12.2
```

see (local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/nbconvert/templates/latex/base.tplx).

I'm not sure if `xkeyval` is sufficient. I'll investigate. It may take me a bit, unless you have a quicker resolution.
