Keywords: GF

In the literature of finite fields, a generator for the multiplicative group is often called a "primitive element" (or primitive root).  We should add a method `primitive_element` which returns the multiplicative generator.

This is because of different random seeds.  For large finite fields, it takes a *random* irreducible polynomial to generate a finite field.  So one `GF(19^32)` is not the same as a different `GF(19^32)`.

Aha, I see. And the random seed is set to a known value at the beginning of a doctest session, which is why you can still have a doctest with a known output. Thanks! Any comments about other things I said? What needs work now?

While attempting to see what `.. WARNING::` is supposed to do by looking at how it renders in the reference manual, I found to my surprise that this docstring does not even appear in the reference manual! Maybe we should make our autodoc a bit more automatic...?
