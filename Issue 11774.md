Assignee: AlexGhitza

Keywords: GF

In the literature of finite fields, a generator for the multiplicative group is often called a "primitive element" (or primitive root).  We should add a method `primitive_element` which returns the multiplicative generator.

This is because of different random seeds.  For large finite fields, it takes a *random* irreducible polynomial to generate a finite field.  So one `GF(19^32)` is not the same as a different `GF(19^32)`.
