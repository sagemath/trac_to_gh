# Issue 11774: Finite fields: add "primitive_element" as alias for "multiplicative_generator"

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2011-10-24 08:47:45

Assignee: AlexGhitza

Keywords: GF

In the literature of finite fields, a generator for the multiplicative group is often called a "primitive element" (or primitive root).  We should add a method `primitive_element` which returns the multiplicative generator.

Silly question, but why not just do this?


```diff
diff --git a/sage/rings/finite_rings/finite_field_base.pyx b/sage/rings/finite_rings/finite_field_base.pyx
--- a/sage/rings/finite_rings/finite_field_base.pyx
+++ b/sage/rings/finite_rings/finite_field_base.pyx
`@``@` -87,6 +87,7 `@``@`
         """
         from sage.categories.finite_fields import FiniteFields
         Field.__init__(self, base, names, normalize, category=FiniteFields())
+        self.primitive_element = self.multiplicative_generator
 
     def __repr__(self):
         """
```


The docstring you wrote is basically the same as the docstring for `multiplicative_generator`, so eliminating it will avoid double-maintenance pitfalls. And this way you don't get one more call frame on the stack when using the function. ... right?

And something else a bit bizarre is happening. With the diff I pasted above, the second test produces the output `a`, which matches the last doctest in the docstring of the `multiplicative_generator` method. But your patch gives `a + 5`, even though it's just calling `multiplicative_generator`, and also produces a large number of messages in `stderr` (which are therefore not noticed by `sage -t`); they all read as follows:

```
  ***   Warning: Mod(a,b)^n with n >> b : wasteful.
```

What's going on?

This is because of different random seeds.  For large finite fields, it takes a _random_ irreducible polynomial to generate a finite field.  So one `GF(19^32)` is not the same as a different `GF(19^32)`.

Aha, I see. And the random seed is set to a known value at the beginning of a doctest session, which is why you can still have a doctest with a known output. Thanks! Any comments about other things I said? What needs work now?

I made the obvious change `primitive_element = multiplicative_generator` and changed the docstring accordingly.

Nice catch, see new description.  New patch fixes this.

While attempting to see what `.. WARNING::` is supposed to do by looking at how it renders in the reference manual, I found to my surprise that this docstring does not even appear in the reference manual! Maybe we should make our autodoc a bit more automatic...?

I'll doctest the patch on `sage.math`.

All tests pass and the patch looks good to me. Positive review.
