Can you add a doctest for this?  Also, the commit message should be changed (using `hg qrefresh -e`).

Here's a version with a doctest. In the course of testing I uncovered another bug (it would die if the input list was empty and the character was trivial, since CyclotomicField hadn't been imported).

Dear Sebastian and Jan, any chance either of you could review this?

This seems to work perfectly now, thanks David.

100% doctest coverage, test of entire Sage library passed. 
All documentation builds as well.

Thanks for the review -- this may be minor, but still it's good to get another patch ticked off.
