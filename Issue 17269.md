# Issue 17269: Implement broken circuits and NBC sets

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17506

Keywords: NBC sets

Broken circuits and no broken circuit (NBC) sets are important aspects of matroid theory. In particular, a basis for the Orlik-Solomon algebra can be given by NBC sets. This implements a basic iterator for broken circuits and NBC sets.

I'm sorry, I didn't look at this ticket before. You add TWO methods to Matroid that do the same thing:

Matroid.no_broken_circuit_sets

and

Matroid.nbc_sets.

This is needlessly cluttering up the list of methods a user sees through autocomplete. Please keep one of the two (preferably the long one, as it is more descriptive)

`\union` is not a valid latex command *facepalm*

`@`Stefan, _if_ we are going to keep only one, I would say lets keep `nbc_sets` since that is how they are more commonly known. However because of this and it is good to have methods with fully spelled out names, I think we should keep both. If you strongly believe there should only be one, then I will remove `no_broken_circuit_sets`.

I disagree. People in the field will know what NBC stands for and can find the long name. To others, the long name immediately tells them what the thing does, as opposed to the mysterious abbreviation.

I think clarity should come before brevity.

I think the short name, being a very common abbreviation, with the documentation is sufficient. Although I still would argue that having both methods gives the option to the user; plus it's not like matroids are current overflowing with methods (as opposed to `Graphs` with nearly 300). Shall we see what Federic thinks and just go with that?

Well, we try to keep it from becoming like the Graph class. Maybe Frederic can give a third opinion to settle the matter?

I would vote for keeping only the long name. The "very common abreviation" NBC is not so universally well-known. But this seems to me to be a very minor point.

Yea, but it's a point of contention. Anyways, I've removed `nbc_sets`.
