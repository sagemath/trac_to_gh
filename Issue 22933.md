# Issue 22933: Stability for the generators of principal ideals

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23170

Original creator: saraedum

Original creation time: 2017-06-07 22:29:05

Keywords: sd86.5

Currently, when creating a principal ideal from a single generator, that exact generator is not returned when requesting the generator for the ideal:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: a = 1337
sage: R.ideal(a).gen() is a
False
```


This is unfortunate because anything that is cached in `a` has to be recomputed.

Changing keywords from "sd86.5" to "sd86.5, sd87".
