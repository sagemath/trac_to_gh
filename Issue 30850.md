# Issue 30850: Align sparseness of global functions `diagonal_matrix` and `identity_matrix`

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31087

Original creator: slelievre

Original creation time: 2020-12-20 02:58:17

Before this ticket, e.g. in Sage 9.3.beta4:

```
sage: identity_matrix(ZZ, 2).is_sparse()
False
sage: diagonal_matrix(ZZ, 2, [1, 1]).is_sparse()
True
```


After this ticket, the sparseness should match.
