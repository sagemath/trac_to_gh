Keywords: isogeny number field

The following error is due to `EllipticCurve_number_field.is_isogenous()` not changing to a local minimal model before reducing.

```
sage: K.<s>=QuadraticField(229)
sage: c4=2173-235*(1-s)/2
sage: c6=-124369+15988*(1-s)/2
sage: c4c=2173-235*(1+s)/2
sage: c6c=-124369+15988*(1+s)/2
sage: E=EllipticCurve_from_c4c6(c4, c6)
sage: Ec=EllipticCurve_from_c4c6(c4c, c6c)
sage: E.conductor()
Fractional ideal (1)
sage: K.ideal(E.discriminant()).factor()
(Fractional ideal (3, 1/2*s + 1/2))^12  # not minimal at this prime
sage: E.is_isogenous(Ec)
...
ArithmeticError: Invariants [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] define a singular curve.
