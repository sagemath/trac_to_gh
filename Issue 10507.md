Fixes lowercase "eulerians". Should be applied with the previous patch.

I tried this with a fresh repository and it worked perfectly. Are you sure you don't have any patches that are conflicting?

Thanks.

Are you using [sage-4.6.1.rc0](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.6.1.rc0/) (the latest development release)?

No. Should I be? Since it's a release candidate, aren't some things liable to change and break patches?

It's true that an alpha version or release candidate could be less stable than a released version, but for Sage development these are the versions you are suppose to be using.  A lot of things have changed between sage-4.6 and sage-4.6.1.rc0, apparently making your patch not apply any more.
