# Issue 5176: notebook chokes horribly on Umlautes

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/5176

I have worksheet with the word "Gr√∂bner" in it which prevents me from using the notebook at all because the listing of worksheets crashes.


```

Before umlauts where displayed wrong but at least they didn't crash the server.

patch looks good, fixes the crashing for me, and is doctested.  Positive review.

```
[13:09] <mabshoff> Someone needs to make sure we can still clone the repo with that patch since last time we had Nicola's name spelled correctly in a patch we had issues like that.
```


I did not do the above.  mabshoff, if you feel it's needed, can you check it before you merge?

I tested cloning on sage.math and it works there. I will only merge trac_5176.2.patch. 

Jason: when you review tickets with multiple patches please make clear which patches need to be applied. In this case it was obvious once I looked at both patches.

Cheers,

Michael

Merged trac_5176.2.patch only in Sage 3.3.alpha6.

Cheers,

sorry.  You're right to merge the .2.patch file.
