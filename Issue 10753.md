# Issue 10753: implementation of the cluster complex

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10819

Original creator: stumpc5

Original creation time: 2011-02-21 22:33:33

Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  tscrim stumpc5

Keywords: cluster complex

The patch contains an implementation of the cluster complex for finite types.

Can only applied after the cluster algebra and quiver package is installed. This contains tickets #10347, #10349, #10538, #10527.


```
sage: ClusterComplex(['A',3])
Cluster complex of type ['A', 3] with 9 vertices and 14 facets
```


The vertices of the cluster complex are almost positive roots, and the facets maximal subsets of compatible almost positive roots. The implementation uses cluster variables and clusters to construct the cluster complex.

some comments :

there is a typo in "facet" at the beginning.

The examples are wrong, because they call "associahedron" which has nothing to do with the simplicial complex.

There is a "tba" in the examples section, that should be removed or replaced by a true example

You should include serious tests, like the computation of the homology of an example.

Hi,

1) here also, the header is not correct, you should add ticket number #10819.


2) this seems to be a real error, which appears several times :

 AttributeError: 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_sparse.Matrix_integer_sparse' object has no attribute 'is_skew_symmetrizable'

I fixed it -- now I think I know what (not why) to do in order to pass the buildbot. Thanks!

> 2) this seems to be a real error, which appears several times :

There was one dependency missing, see #10298. This is like only knowing one linear extension of the ordering given by the dependencies -- so getting the dependencies is really try and error...

Hello Christian. Here are two things that need to be corrected : 

1) type A_n is in n+3 sided polygon

2) formatting of doc is not correct in cartan_type

Replying to [comment:8 chapoton]:

I really appreciate that you do some progress on these patches, thanks!

I think I will reimplement this patch using subword complexes rather than the cluster implementation. This will be much faster, and I don't expect that the cluster package will become part of main sage soon (see the dependency above). On the other hand, the subword complexes depend on my new implementation of finite reflection groups (#11187) which depends on the implementation of the universal cyclotomic field (#8327), so it will also be unlikely that it will get positively reviewed soon (and I see that all of them have rejects in the newest versions, so it will be an even longer way).

> 1) type A_n is in n+3 sided polygon
> 2) formatting of doc is not correct in cartan_type

I will update the patch fixing these issues.

Best, Christian

I fixed the two issues suggested by Frederic - what I do not like now is that the vertices are not positive roots anymore, but on the other hand the implementation is now valid for all finite Coxeter groups and also the multi-cluster complex can be constructed.

Applying this and its dependencies to 5.0.beta11 results in a Sage install that won't start up, and hence fails every doctest in the library -- see patchbot logs.

Thanks for looking at it - for now, I would prefer if we postpone this patch, since I want to make some further improvements here.

Best, Christian

Hello Christian,

I have made a git branch with one part of the patch, not touching the file `cluster_seed.py` in order to keep it as independent as possible.

I have also cleaned the code a little bit to make sur it passes the pyflakes and pep8 tests.

This should be almost ready. Anybody available to have a look ?


---

Comment by stumpc5 created at 2016-02-24 16:34:15

Will do that.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-02-24 16:47:59

By almost ready, do you mean you will be making changes or that it just needs someone else to look it over?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-02-24 19:07:08

second thing: "it just needs someone else to look it over"

Hey Christian and Frédéric, here are my comments:

- We should use the standard copyright template from ​http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files for all new files.
- The file should be added to the documentation.
- You should run the `TestSuite` on the cluster complex (often this is done in the `__init__` tests).
- Error messages are typically not considered as sentences, so they should start with a lower case and not end with a period.
- Your `__call__` does not appear to be idempotent, i.e., `C(C((0,1)))` should equal (or even better, be identical to) `C((0,1))`.
- You aren't properly using the category framework by not having `ClusterComplexFacet` as the `Element` attribute of `ClusterComplex`, and subsequently, you should use `self.element_class` in `ClusterComplex`.
- The methods of `ClusterComplexFacet` should at least have a one-line description of what the method does.

Some of these comments extend to the `SubwordComplex`, which might require a separate ticket to work on.

Once the issues raised by Travis are solved in #20111, I will start looking at the actual content of this ticket...

So, technically I think the ticket is ready. But the documentation is still lousy. I will work on this a bit, but it would also be good if someone else takes a look!

A few methods here depend on the not-yet-available implementation of reflection groups. Is it appropriate to put them into comments for now?

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-03-07 14:31:25

In a perfect world, I would just put it directly in a branch which depends on the branch which implements the reflection groups. However, I know that can be a hassle. So if it is just few lines, then I would say yes it is okay, but make sure to state clearly which ticket will change those lines. If they are entire methods, I'm more reluctant, but again, I'm not strictly opposed to it...


---

Comment by stumpc5 created at 2016-03-07 14:33:40

I already pushed that change, so have a look and tell me what you think concretely there...


---

Comment by stumpc5 created at 2016-03-07 14:35:53

It is the two methods

```
+    # the following methods only make sense for the implementation using #11187:
+
+    #def upper_cluster(self):
+    #def product_of_upper_cluster(self):
```

I might actually implement them in a much slower way now, so I guess that might be the way to go... (and then commenting out the possible speed improvement with #11187)

Comment by stumpc5 created at 2016-03-07 14:46:13

Okay, I now use a naive implementation. But I am missing

```
AttributeError: 'CoxeterMatrixGroup_with_category' object has no attribute 'root_to_reflection'
```

Is there chance to get this method ? Otherwise, I will just delete that method needing this for now. I can then get it back later, if desired.

I think this is the best way to do things (at least because their implementation was simple).

Coxeter groups don't necessarily have all of the methods that Weyl groups have (since they are not tied to a particular root lattice). You should be able to use `W.reflections()[beta]` from #20027, and it _should_ work as well for Weyl groups now that the behavior is consistent.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-03-07 14:55:37

However, that's not to say we should not implement a method `root_to_reflection` for (finite) Coxeter groups.

Indeed, greetings from Korea.

I pushed some changes:

- I moved the description of the cluster complex to the class-level doc (instead of the module-level doc) so it can be visible from `ClusterComplex?`.
- I updated the reference bibliographic info.
- I added more tests to `__classcall__` to make sure it covers all of the code paths/input formats.
- I removed the verbose output from `TestSuite` as these can change as tests get added and it's annoying to make these trivial changes all over Sage (not that it happens that often).
- Other misc tweaks.

If you agree with my changes, then you can set a positive review.
