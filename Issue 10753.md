Keywords: cluster complex

The patch contains an implementation of the cluster complex for finite types.

Can only applied after the cluster algebra and quiver package is installed. This contains tickets #10347, #10349, #10538, #10527.

```
sage: ClusterComplex(['A',3])
Cluster complex of type ['A', 3] with 9 vertices and 14 facets
```

The vertices of the cluster complex are almost positive roots, and the facets maximal subsets of compatible almost positive roots. The implementation uses cluster variables and clusters to construct the cluster complex.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10819

some comments :

there is a typo in "facet" at the beginning.

The examples are wrong, because they call "associahedron" which has nothing to do with the simplicial complex.

There is a "tba" in the examples section, that should be removed or replaced by a true example

You should include serious tests, like the computation of the homology of an example.

Hi,

1) here also, the header is not correct, you should add ticket number #10819.


2) this seems to be a real error, which appears several times :

 AttributeError: 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_sparse.Matrix_integer_sparse' object has no attribute 'is_skew_symmetrizable'

Hello Christian,

I have made a git branch with one part of the patch, not touching the file `cluster_seed.py` in order to keep it as independent as possible.

I have also cleaned the code a little bit to make sur it passes the pyflakes and pep8 tests.

Hey Christian and Frédéric, here are my comments:

- We should use the standard copyright template from ​http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files for all new files.
- The file should be added to the documentation.
- You should run the `TestSuite` on the cluster complex (often this is done in the `__init__` tests).
- Error messages are typically not considered as sentences, so they should start with a lower case and not end with a period.
- Your `__call__` does not appear to be idempotent, i.e., `C(C((0,1)))` should equal (or even better, be identical to) `C((0,1))`.
- You aren't properly using the category framework by not having `ClusterComplexFacet` as the `Element` attribute of `ClusterComplex`, and subsequently, you should use `self.element_class` in `ClusterComplex`.
- The methods of `ClusterComplexFacet` should at least have a one-line description of what the method does.

Some of these comments extend to the `SubwordComplex`, which might require a separate ticket to work on.

Indeed, greetings from Korea.

I pushed some changes:

- I moved the description of the cluster complex to the class-level doc (instead of the module-level doc) so it can be visible from `ClusterComplex?`.
- I updated the reference bibliographic info.
- I added more tests to `__classcall__` to make sure it covers all of the code paths/input formats.
- I removed the verbose output from `TestSuite` as these can change as tests get added and it's annoying to make these trivial changes all over Sage (not that it happens that often).
- Other misc tweaks.

If you agree with my changes, then you can set a positive review.
