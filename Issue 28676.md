```


This seems to point to the (unwelcome) timing information added by Giac //before// its results... It's probably more of a booboo than a (real|hard) bug, but might defeat a whole problem if this error is raised before other algorithms has had a chance to report their results.

I'm not sure that this should be reported upstream (it should if there is no way to cleanly suppress the timing information).
