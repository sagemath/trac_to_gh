In order to make this ticket merge cleanly with some of the other M2 tickets summarized at #28573, I set dependencies and merged the appropriate branches. Provided the dependencies are respected, everything should merge cleanly now.

I am happy with this ticket. Markus, if you accept the proposed merging, then you can set this to positive review.

I have replaced the last merge commit by a new merge with #28572 and still all tests pass on my end.

Franco, please review the merging, though maybe wait for the next beta to see if it merges cleanly.
