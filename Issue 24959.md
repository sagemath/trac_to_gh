Possibly since #25092

```
ralf@ark:~/sage> ./sage -gdb
Usage: cygdb [options] [PATH [-- GDB_ARGUMENTS]].
No debug files were found in /home/ralf/sage/src/build/cythonized. Aborting.
```

Sage was not built with SAGE_DEBUG but this wasn't necessary before, either.

I think compiler and debugger are orthogonal, i.e., you should be able to use lldb on gcc compiled programs. Right now I'm using gdb on clang compiled Sage / Pynac. So, just another Sage command-line option would be necessary for convenience. However, with lldb it may be even possible to get Sage Python backtraces that include the now missing Cython / Pynac frames, because lldb can be accessed as library from Python. It surely is an interesting piece of software.
