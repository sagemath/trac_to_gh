# Issue 24959: sage -gdb abort

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2018-04-17 14:55:39

Possibly since #25092

```
ralf`@`ark:~/sage> ./sage -gdb
Usage: cygdb [options] [PATH [-- GDB_ARGUMENTS]].
No debug files were found in /home/ralf/sage/src/build/cythonized. Aborting.
```

Sage was not built with SAGE_DEBUG but this wasn't necessary before, either.

That report is with the system gdb-8.0.1 but after installing `sage -i gdb` it's the same.

Changing priority from blocker to critical.

Actually, now that I'm using gdb instead of cygdb I'm happy because I no longer get those annoying Python warnings in every displayed frame line of backtraces. Adios cygdb!

probably with clang one would want to use lldb, no?

(obviously, not something to do on this ticket)

I think compiler and debugger are orthogonal, i.e., you should be able to use lldb on gcc compiled programs. Right now I'm using gdb on clang compiled Sage / Pynac. So, just another Sage command-line option would be necessary for convenience. However, with lldb it may be even possible to get Sage Python backtraces that include the now missing Cython / Pynac frames, because lldb can be accessed as library from Python. It surely is an interesting piece of software.

gdb has an embedded Python interpreter; cygdb is just some python scripts running inside gdb.
