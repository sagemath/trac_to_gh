Convert a rst file into a notebook file (text file). 

The idea is that in general I wrote code using the Sage Code Convention where examples are formatted in ReST. Then converting rst examples to the notebook would be nice. Also, ReST file is more fun to edit than the html/cells notebook text file.

I implemented a script called `rst2notebook` available [on the Sage Combinat server](http://combinat.sagemath.org/hgwebdir.cgi/misc/file/ef17ccb37589/notebook2rst/).

In this script, I use docutils to translate a rst file into html file. From this, I convert blocks into cells. Note that I do not use sphinx so that not all usual Sage Rest syntax is working. But I am able to make math role work by adding dollar signs.

I am planning to make this script more clean during [Sage Days 31](http://wiki.sagemath.org/days31), I hope based on sphinx and written as patches.

Related to : #10637 (Implement sage -sws2rst) and #10652.

I mentionned the idea on sage-devel in December 2010 [here](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/5d86874cd359e1a5/eda52be07a9fb994).

By rst2notebook, I mean something different. I mean the worksheet txt file which is made of html code and `{{{`'s cells. I agree rst2notebook is confusing. Maybe `sage -rst2worksheet_txt` would be better?

By the way, I also implemented the `sage -rst2sws`. I still need to add some doctests and do some more testing before it needs review. I hope to get to that point by wednesday.

What about rst2txt?

Great! Except for the fact that I usually need to go the other direction - but of course those are also appearing.

Why BTW? I feel I am the only one that needs more the rst -> sws  way?! I write all my examples in ReST syntax in my personal code, that  might be why.

I'm testing this, but I wanted to give others a heads-up on something. (Maybe Kini can shed some light on this from the hg side of things.)

I'm currently using the flask repo (the ~official~ one...) and have a symlink redirecting devel/sagenb->flask. The path for various diffs in this patch should be following that sagenb symlink, but they're following my sage->sage-main (or whatever clone I'm working in) repo instead.

Yup... "sagenb" and "sage" are the two symlinks in devel. All of my patches are attempting to following the latter. 

I'm using hg_sage.apply("address"). My usual workflow is to create a clone, build into that clone, then apply any patches. This has always worked, but then again I am always working under the "sage" symlink. But, in this situation the patch (regardless of branch) is attempting to apply in "devel/sage->my_".

Salut!

Just to give an update about the status of the patches on this ticket :

1. trac11459_rst2notebook_sagenb-sl.patch : I was not able to export the patch once I qfinish it and pushed it on my branch on the sagenb google code. Hence, the patch available here do not have the very last modification I did just before I made qfinish. So if you are testing it, it would be better if you test my sagenb branch. Anyhow, I do not intend to change my sagenb branch. I believe it is ready for review.

Question for kini : How can I export the patch once it is qfinished (commited) so that I upload here the latest version?

2. trac11459_rst2notebook_localbin-sl.patch : The script needs work. I want to implement better options about escaping backslashes. I should be able to finish this in the next days during the week. Once this is done, I will change the status of this ticket to needs review.

Hi Sebastien,

I've rebased the scripts patch to Sage 5.0. Because the file formerly at `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-sage` is now at `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin/sage`, it had to be split into two patches.

The notebook patch will probably need to be rebased as well, but since we're doing development of sagenb on github now, it won't go here on trac. I'll see what I can do...

Hi Kini,

Thanks for looking at this!

I remember I wanted to remove the guillemets (") in the line of documentation of both scripts:

"..  escape-backslashes" 

Can you update your patch to do it, if you agree? I am sorry I never did it...

Is the new notebook now part of Sage ? If I want to test this ticket, should I install the latest sage-alpha or should I install the new sage-notebook?

Sébastien
