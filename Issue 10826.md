# Issue 10826: symbolic_expression_from_string does not support arbitrary precision

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10898

In some places (e.g. #8495), `sage.calculus.calculus.symbolic_expression_from_string` is being used as a safer alternative to `sage_eval`.  However, it does not seem to support numbers with arbitrary precision.  It should.


```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_expression_from_string as sefssage: pi_on_two = '1.57079632679489661923132169163975144209858469968755'
sage: sefs(pi_on_two)
1.57079632679
sage: sage_eval(pi_on_two)
1.5707963267948966192313216916397514420985846996875
```
