This ticket implements the Serre derivative for modular forms. This derivative is defined by:

*theta(f) = (q * d/dq - (k/12) * E_2)(f) = (q * df/dq - (k/12) f E_2)*

where f is a modular form of weight *k* (see also: https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01883058/document page 29, section 3.10), *q* is the classical parameter at infinity and *E_2* is the weight 2 Eisenstein series. This derivative is known to preserve the modularity and simply raise the weight of *f* by 2.

Note that this feature is implemented in PARI/GP under the name *mfderivE2*.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32343

looks good.

I would break the start of the doc into separate lines.

Vincent, any other suggestion ?

Hmm.. Thanks. You can keep that, but this is not what I wanted. In methods, the very first line must be a single sentence describing the method, like "Return a potato." 

Here you have two sentences : separate the second one "If bla bla" from the first one by an empty line.

Thank you very much for reminding me this rule. I have to admit that I took this "faux pli" by looking at some already written code and I have done it in some of my other ticket. I will fix them.
