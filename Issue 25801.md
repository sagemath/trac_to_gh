# Issue 25801: Problem with doctesting framework and multiple lines

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2018-08-09 18:29:21

The file `geometry/polyhedron/backend_ppl.py` contains the following doctest (basically at the end of the file):

```
        sage: p = Polyhedron(vertices=[(0,0),(1,0),(0,1)], rays=[(1,1)], lines=[])
        ....:                backend='ppl', base_ring=ZZ)
        sage: TestSuite(p).run(skip='_test_pickling')
```

This passes when using Sage built with Python 2, while Sage built with Python 3 says, quite correctly,

```
SyntaxError: multiple statements found while compiling a single statement
```

The first line `p = Polyhedron(...)` is a complete statement because of a typo – the `)` instead of `,` at the end of that line – so the continuation line makes no sense. Why does this doctest pass? There must be a bug in the doctesting framework.

The typo is fixed in #26037, but the doctesting issue should be investigated.

I've marked this critical because I don't know if it is affecting other doctests, maybe causing lines to be ignored, the wrong doctests to be run, etc. I'm tempted to make it a blocker: something wrong with doctesting is serious.

It's a Python issue. It seems that the single-statement parser literally parses a single statement and ignores anything else. This just works:

```
sage: compile("a = 1\n!`@`#$%^&*()", "", "single")
```

Replying to [comment:2 jdemeyer]:
> It's a Python issue.

Does that mean we ignore it? Or is there a good way to catch the syntax error?

Changing status from new to needs_review.

This is the basic idea. I haven't ran all Sage doctests with this, it would be interesting to see if there are more problems like this.

I get one doctest failure:

```

The doctest is certainly not a single statement. If it should instead be

```diff
diff --git a/src/sage/repl/ipython_extension.py b/src/sage/repl/ipython_extension.py
index 393bf95d2f..b5ea9e983d 100644
--- a/src/sage/repl/ipython_extension.py
+++ b/src/sage/repl/ipython_extension.py
`@``@` -352,7 +352,7 `@``@` class SageMagics(Magics):
             ....: def f():
             ....:     print('test')
             ....: ''')
-            ....: shell.run_cell('f()')
+            sage: shell.run_cell('f()')
+            test
         """
         from sage.misc.cython import cython_compile
         return cython_compile(cell)
```

that doesn't work for me when doctesting (`NameError: name 'f' is not defined`), although it does work interactively (well, interactively I also see some other information: `<ExecutionResult object at ...>` for both calls to `shell.run_cell(...)`). Is it a bug if it doesn't work in doctest mode? Or should it instead be

```diff
diff --git a/src/sage/repl/ipython_extension.py b/src/sage/repl/ipython_extension.py
index 393bf95d2f..779d83ffd3 100644

-            ....: shell.run_cell('f()')
+            sage: f()

         """
         from sage.misc.cython import cython_compile
         return cython_compile(cell)
```

?

I've seen this problem before too, but couldn't quite articulate it--John's example made it clear though and this fix makes sense.

I knew something about that test looked familiar: #25212

Any reviewers?

Comment by embray created at 2018-08-23 12:48:01

I seem to recall being told that by changing that `%%cython` doctest I was defeating the purpose of the test.  But I guess now you agree with my reasoning.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.
