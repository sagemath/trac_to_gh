The file `geometry/polyhedron/backend_ppl.py` contains the following doctest (basically at the end of the file):

```
        sage: p = Polyhedron(vertices=[(0,0),(1,0),(0,1)], rays=[(1,1)], lines=[])
        ....:                backend='ppl', base_ring=ZZ)
        sage: TestSuite(p).run(skip='_test_pickling')
```
This passes when using Sage built with Python 2, while Sage built with Python 3 says, quite correctly,

```
SyntaxError: multiple statements found while compiling a single statement
```
The first line `p = Polyhedron(...)` is a complete statement because of a typo – the `)` instead of `,` at the end of that line – so the continuation line makes no sense. Why does this doctest pass? There must be a bug in the doctesting framework.

The typo is fixed in #26037, but the doctesting issue should be investigated.

I've marked this critical because I don't know if it is affecting other doctests, maybe causing lines to be ignored, the wrong doctests to be run, etc. I'm tempted to make it a blocker: something wrong with doctesting is serious.

It's a Python issue. It seems that the single-statement parser literally parses a single statement and ignores anything else. This just works:

```
sage: compile("a = 1\n!@#$%^&*()", "", "single")
```

Does that mean we ignore it? Or is there a good way to catch the syntax error?

This is the basic idea. I haven't ran all Sage doctests with this, it would be interesting to see if there are more problems like this.
