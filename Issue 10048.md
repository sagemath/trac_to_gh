Assignee: @burcin

The following behavior can be confusing:


```
sage: var('x,y,z')
(x, y, z)
sage: t = x+y+z
sage: t.subs({x+y:5})
x + y + z
```


The `match()` function for symbolic expressions already provides a link to the relevant part of the GiNaC tutorial:

http://www.ginac.de/tutorial/Pattern-matching-and-advanced-substitutions.html

Perhaps the `substitute()` function should do this too.
