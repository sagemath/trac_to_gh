# Issue 20416: Editor temp files break build

This results in an unescaped pound sign in build/make/Makefile

```
$ touch src/bin/#sage#
$ ./configure
```

which then breaks building Sage:

```
$ rm local/bin/sage
$ make all-sage
$ rm local/bin/sage
rm: cannot remove ‘local/bin/sage’: No such file or directory
```
