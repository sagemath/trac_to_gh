Given an elliptic curve and integer m, return the associated Lattes map on P1. It would be nice to eventually add support for non-integer m, but this would be a great first step.

I have written code for this; will submit soon-ish.

I've implemented this as a member function of projective space which takes `E`,`m` as parameters and returns the endomorphism. There is already functionality in elliptic curves to generate the rational expression, so the work here is only to turn that expression into an endomorphism of the appropriate projective space.

Went through and check for bugs, found nothing outside of a small typo that has been fixed, setting to positive review
