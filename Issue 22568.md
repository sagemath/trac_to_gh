The function `cython()` currently adds a header to every `.pyx` file:

```
include "cdefs.pxi"
include "cysignals/signals.pxi"  # ctrl-c interrupt block support
include "stdsage.pxi"
```


If we want `cython()` to become less Sage-specific (see for example #22461), we should stop doing this. The user can still manually add the includes.

Note that I don't see an easy way to make this backwards-compatible. The only thing we can do is to give a good error message.

There isn't a way to add the corresponding `cimport` statements to the code before sending it off to Cython? I'm not against this change, but I don't see why we can't have the same functionality available from Sage (mostly out of ignorance).

Yes, of course there is. We could just add `cimport` statements instead of `include` statements.

But my point is that it shouldn't be the business of Sage to add that. This is especially true in the light of #22461. I think that the user can easily add those `cimports` himself.

Why shouldn't we have Sage do a little bit extra on top of standard Cython to make things easier for our users? Even with this change, I don't think we could completely separate `cython()` from standard Cython because we give the users access to our standard Sage classes.

First of all, the relevant `.pxi` files have almost nothing to do with Sage: they add support for `cysignals` (i.e. the `sig_check`/`sig_on` stuff and memory functions like `sig_malloc`), some arbitrary set of C functions like `memset` and `fopen` and all GMP functions like `mpz_init`. So there is really nothing Sage-specific about this.

Second, even if you argue that `cython()` should add those things, it should still be *possible* to just use plain Cython without any extra cimports. This could be implemented with an additional option to `cython()`. I already thought about this when starting this ticket, but then thought that Sage changing Cython files is just a misfeature.
