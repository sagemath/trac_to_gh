# Issue 18842: ConstructionFunctor: remove __str__

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19079

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2015-08-24 18:04:14

sage.categories.pushout.ConstructionFunctor still uses __str__ and _repr_ calls this __str__. It should be the other way round as for SageObject.

Sounds reasonable. I kicked the patchbot as it says TestsFailed with errors that look unrelated to your changes.
