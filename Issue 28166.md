After #27573, there are two Python 3 doctest failures in present.py:

```
sage -t --warn-long 61.3 src/sage/crypto/block_cipher/present.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/crypto/block_cipher/present.py", line 42, in sage.crypto.block_cipher.present

Expected:

Got:

```

The problem is that in Python 3, `range(...)` does not return a list as it does in Python 3, so the `SBox.__init__` method doesn't handle it well.

I can think of two solutions: either change the doctest to use `SBox(list(range(16))`, or this change to `crypto/sbox.py`:

```diff
diff --git a/src/sage/crypto/sbox.py b/src/sage/crypto/sbox.py
index 200bd5ad55..5aa9e7257d 100644
--- a/src/sage/crypto/sbox.py
+++ b/src/sage/crypto/sbox.py
@@ -149,7 +150,7 @@ class SBox(SageObject):
             if R.characteristic() != 2:
                 raise TypeError("Only polynomials over rings with characteristic 2 allowed")
             S = [poly(v) for v in sorted(R)]
-        elif len(args) == 1 and isinstance(args[0], (list, tuple)):
+        elif len(args) == 1 and isinstance(args[0], (list, tuple, range)):
             S = args[0]
         elif len(args) > 1:
             S = args
```

The first way is safer. The second way may be a little closer to the documentation: the documentation says that `SBox.__init__` takes as input "a finite iterable". The source code checks for lists and tuples, but not for other iterables like `range`. I don't know anything about the crypto code, though, so I am not the right person to judge the right way to fix this.

If you really want to test for iterables, maybe you should do

```
from collections.abc import Iterable
if isinstance(args[0], Iterable):
    ...
```

(See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1952464/in-python-how-do-i-determine-if-an-object-is-iterable for more suggestions.)

We should also (once fixed) add "crypto" to "src/ext/doctest/python3-known-passing.txt"

This looks good to me. If any crypto people have opinions, please let us know soon. Let's flip this to a positive review in a day or two if we don't hear anything.

Why not

```diff
-        elif len(args) == 1 and isinstance(args[0], (list, tuple)):
+        elif len(args) == 1:
```

In other words: instead of checking whether it's a sequence, assume that it is. That's much more in spirit with duck typing. If it's not, we'll get an error when iterating over it.

Here it is, with belts and suspenders.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-08-26 18:39:32

With that most recent change, the doctest doesn't need to be changed from `range(16)` to `list(range(16))`: `range(16)` works.


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2019-08-26 18:43:16

Yes, that's the reason for me talking about belt-and-suspenders.. Do you require me to undo this change, or can you live with it ?


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-08-26 19:57:46

I can live with it.

Comment by klee created at 2019-08-27 00:46:53

I prefer recovering the original doctest. `list` now is just redundant.

Ok, then. I bow to your common request. Please review.

I agree with this latest version.
