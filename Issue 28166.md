After #27573, there are two Python 3 doctest failures in present.py:

The problem is that in Python 3, `range(...)` does not return a list as it does in Python 3, so the `SBox.__init__` method doesn't handle it well.

I can think of two solutions: either change the doctest to use `SBox(list(range(16))`, or this change to `crypto/sbox.py`:

```diff

If you really want to test for iterables, maybe you should do

```
from collections.abc import Iterable
if isinstance(args[0], Iterable):
    ...
```
