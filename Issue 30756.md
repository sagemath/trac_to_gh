This last commit adds 2 methods, one to get the width of a tree-decomposition, and the other to merge the tree-decompositions of the atoms of the input graph to get a tree-decomposition for the graph. This last method will be reused for the computation of treelength.

In addition, we add parameter `kmin` to search for a tree-decomposition of width at least `kmin`. This is useful to speed up computations when processing many atoms.

I'm removing the dependency to #30986 as it has been merge in sage 9.3.beta3.

When `tdlib` is installed, the recursive calls were mixing the usage of `'sage'` and `'tdlib'`. This is now much more consistent.
