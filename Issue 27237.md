Seems you have a duplicate reference introduced (from the patchbot):

```
[dochtml] OSError: /home/chapoton/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/words/finite_word.py:docstring of sage.combinat.words.finite_word.FiniteWord_class.is_full:62: WARNING: Duplicate explicit target name: "bhnr04".
```

If I have time over the next few days, I would like to take your branch and modify it, moving the references to the master bibliography file. Would that be okay?

Looks good. I have launched my bot on it.

By the way, back when I created the master bibliography file in #21454, I didn't touch `combinat`, `graphs`, `rings`, or `schemes`. So unfortunately there is still a lot of tedious work to do to fix everything.
