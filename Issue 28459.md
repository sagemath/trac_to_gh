# Issue 28459: qsieve with time=True doesn't work

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28696

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2019-11-05 14:55:21

Keywords: qsieve cygwin time

When running something like `qsieve(n, time=True)`, for some reason it uses the built-in `time` command in the shell to do this (is there really any advantage in that?)

However, on Cygwin, there is not a `time` program by default; it is a bash shell built-in, and there is no wrapper executable for it, so trying to run `time` with `Popen` fails as reported here: https://ask.sagemath.org/question/48549/qsieve-error/

A workaround would be to just use `timeit`, like 


```
sage: timeit('qsieve(n)', repeat=1, number=1)
```
