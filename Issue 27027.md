Flint on Sage is linked with NTL, and this can be checked by testing for presence of
`fmpz_poly_get_ZZX` there. So, this:

```
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE([flint], [
    AC_CHECK_HEADER(flint/flint.h, [], [sage_spkg_install_flint=yes])
dnl fmpz_mat_is_hadamard appears in Flint 2.5.0
    AC_SEARCH_LIBS([fmpz_mat_is_hadamard], [flint], [], [sage_spkg_install_flint=yes])
    AC_SEARCH_LIBS([fmpz_poly_get_ZZX], [flint], [break], [sage_spkg_install_flint=yes])
])
```

Naturally, I am testing them all together...
(this branch has them all).

Actually, there is a lot of common boilerplate in spkg-configure.m4's for mpfr, mpc, ntl, and flint. But OK, perhaps this simplification can wait---depending upon how many more spkgs need `--with-...=` support.

I agree, I think that for now it will be simpler and easier to understand if we are somewhat repetitive.  If, once we've made more progress, a clear pattern emerges then I can certainly collapse the repetitive bits into a macro.

This needs an extra test that flint was not built with `--with-gc=...` option, which results in a memory layout different from what Sage interface expects, and leads to crashes, e.g. in `src/sage/libs/flint/fmpz_poly.pyx`.
