Does the new upgraded patchbot check documentation properly? Because the Sage Patchbot 2.0 always reports

```
========== plugins.docbuild ==========
make doc
make: Nothing to be done for `doc'.
plugins.docbuild -- 0 seconds
========== end plugins.docbuild ==========
```

(see for example [http://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/15311/Fedora/19/x86_64/3.11.6-200.fc19.x86_64/desktop/2013-11-03%2006:54:45%20+0000?plugin=plugins.docbuild](http://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/15311/Fedora/19/x86_64/3.11.6-200.fc19.x86_64/desktop/2013-11-03%2006:54:45%20+0000?plugin=plugins.docbuild))

Also, the no-ASCII check should be removed, or at least made conditional on the fact that no encoding declaration exists like [PEP 263](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/).

Um... does "make" always make the documentation these days?  That's something to look into more.

When was this decided? I thought the consensus was to avoid non-ASCII in Sage source files.

I remember William saying once that of course we allow UTF-8 in Sage source code files.

I never heard about this. There is also no real reason for this, Sage already works with non-ASCII source files.

It normally does. So I guess it's a problem with the patchbot setup. Does it use the standard Sage `Makefile`?

Just "make" included the docs for a long time, possibly always. Use "make build" to just compile.

Non-ascii characters are necessary, for starters many names can't be written with 7 bits. The world doesn't end at the US border ;-) Though on a separate ticket would be fine with me.

I've updated the patchbot from the description and its working, so positive review.
