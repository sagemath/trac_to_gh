Would you mind my adding #19463 as a dependency of this? Modifying the list of small SRG in any way creates a conflict with it `:-/`

I'd rather have it the opposite way - this ticket is ready to review, and it's a trivial one, as opposed to #19463.

Well yeah but there is a conflict to fix, and both tickets will have to be merged anyway. If you fix the conflict I don't mind.

I didn't know that #19463 is ready (there was a notice "not to be merged..." there for some time) when I sat down this morning to work on this ticket, sorry. 
I  can try to merge the stuff, but you know what you did there much better, and I guess it would take you much less time (I don't mind this ticket becoming dependent on #19463, I just don't know exactly what should go where...)

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Hello,

> I didn't know that #19463 is ready (there was a notice "not to be merged..." there for some time) when I sat down this morning to work on this ticket, sorry. 

Well, the 'not to be merged' did not mean 'not to be reviewed'. It means that I knew it would conflict with other things and that the merging required a double-check before being merged, or constructions would be 'lost'. I did this double check yesterday evening when I removed the note, and knowing that no other constructions are one the way (until you opened a new one), it was safe again 'to merge'. But it has been 'safe to review' since the beginning.

> I  can try to merge the stuff, but you know what you did there much better, and I guess it would take you much less time (I don't mind this ticket becoming dependent on #19463, I just don't know exactly what should go where...)

Ideally, #19463 would be reviewed first (it has been in `needs_review` for 5 weeks). Then, instead of adding your line where the long list of constructions used to be, you would have to add it where it is after that branch is applied.

> Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

I'll handle the merge to not turn this into another war, but please don't make this fix this conflict again.

Hello Dima,

The code of `SRG_176_90_38_54` is a bit dirty, and I am not convinced that it would even work if the output of `maximal_cliques` was given in a different order. Could you try building the hypergraph of those cliques and asking for a packing of it? If GLPK finds it easily then there is no reason to make matters more complicated.

Also this

```diff
-from sage.graphs.strongly_regular_db import SRG_175_72_20_36
```


You do not need it if you are in the same module.

```
+    assert(hs.subgraph(mc).degree()==[0]*15) # a maximum coclique
+    assert(hs.subgraph(P).degree()==[3]*10)
```


You have `Graph.is_regular(k=whatever)` for these situations.

At this point I am not sure whether I should provide changes you'd like to see here on `u/dimpase/hsfamily` rather than on `public/19463`.

Seems to be double work to do it on `u/dimpase/hsfamily` -- unless I misunderstand how git works...

You can add commits here. Not *all* commits from here need to be merged with #19463. Only those that may create conflict must.

If you modify files from finance/ in this branch, there is no need to synchronize the two.

Update this branch however you like. Just don't rewrite history (or change a space in the listing of small graphs from `strongly_regular_db`) and all will be fine.

Branch pushed to git repo; I updated commit sha1. New commits:

OK, here are the fixes. Not sure if this will need more merging action on #19463, but at least this ticket looks done.

Works for me,
