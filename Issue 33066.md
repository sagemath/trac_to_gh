Keywords: greek, input, ipython

Typing `\alpha` and pressing the TAB key gives `Î±`,
and likewise for other greek letters.

Currently this fails for `Mu`, `Nu`, `omicron`, `Omicron`.

This "LaTeX and unicode completion" feature
is provided by IPython:

- https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/generated/IPython.core.completer.html

so it works both in the Sage REPL and in a Jupyter sheet,
whether in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
