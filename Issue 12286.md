# Issue 12286: remove references to deprecated RQDF

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12458

In Sage 4.8:

```
sage: search_src("RQDF")
symbolic/constants.py:175:- Didier Deshommes (2007-03-27): added constants from RQDF (deprecated)
rings/all.py:87:# from real_rqdf import RealQuadDoubleField, RQDF, QuadDoubleElement
rings/real_mpfr.pyx:4960:    elif type == "RQDF":
rings/real_mpfr.pyx:4961:        from real_rqdf import RQDF
rings/real_mpfr.pyx:4962:        return RQDF
misc/explain_pickle.py:2410:#         doctest:...: DeprecationWarning: RQDF is deprecated; use RealField(212) instead.
misc/explain_pickle.py:2411:#         doctest:...: DeprecationWarning: RQDF is deprecated; use RealField(212) instead.
misc/explain_pickle.py:2412:#         doctest:...: DeprecationWarning: RQDF is deprecated; use RealField(212) instead.
```

In particular the code in `real_mpfr.pyx` should be removed, since it gives the following error:

```
sage: ZZ.completion(infinity, 53, extras={"type":"RQDF"})
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)

ImportError: No module named real_rqdf
```

Also there is a file `rings/real_rqdf.pxd` which should be removed I guess.

This was done at some point before `5.5.rc0`:

```
travis@travis-virtualbox:~/sage-5.5.rc0/devel/sage-combinat/sage/combinat$ cd ../rings/
travis@travis-virtualbox:~/sage-5.5.rc0/devel/sage-combinat/sage/rings$ ls real*real_double.c    real_interval_absolute.c    real_lazy.pxd  real_mpfi.pyx
real_double.pxd  real_interval_absolute.pyx  real_lazy.pyx  real_mpfr.c
real_double.pxi  real_interval_field.py      real_mpfi.c    real_mpfr.pxd
real_double.pyx  real_lazy.c                 real_mpfi.pxd  real_mpfr.pyx
travis@travis-virtualbox:~/sage-5.5.rc0/devel/sage-combinat/sage/rings$ grep "RQDF" *
```

this is indeed fixed now. Thanks for looking at it. Jeroen, should we put "tscrim" as author?

No, duplicate tickets cannot have an author since there is nothing to be the author of.

Replying to [comment:3 jdemeyer]:
> No, duplicate tickets cannot have an author since there is nothing to be the author of.

ok. Nevertheless, "tscrim", please put your real name on trac.sagemath.org so that we can identify you for other tickets.
