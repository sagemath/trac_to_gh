It is crashing in various different (depending on the arguments I give) GMP functions for large integers, with segmentation faults in the assembly code.

The situation is bad enough that it causes irrecoverable stack corruption and the process dies without Cygwin's exception handling even able to run.  I don't know that the problem is likely anything specifically to do with the `Bernoulli` function--that's just the context in which I've been able to reproduce the problem reliably.

For the most part GAP otherwise works fine and most operations do not cause any problems at all, so it is likely a narrow case.  Also strangely, if I remove the `-m 64m` flag when running GAP (a default argument used when running `sage -gap`) the crash does not occur.  Likewise if I provide a larger value like `-m 128m` it does not occur.  I need to double-check exactly what the effect of this argument is.

In the meantime, between this and #27721 it might be a good idea to disable use of the system GMP on Cygwin altogether until and unless I can get to the bottom of this.

I think this might be a reprise of #27214.  The problem, *I think* seems to be that GMP's assembly routines are confusing Windows' stack unwinding on exceptions, and thus preventing the Cygwin exception handler from being called.

Indeed, I can demonstrate the problem with this example code:


```
$ cat test.c
```



```c
#include <gmp.h>
#include <stdlib.h>


int main(void) {
    mp_limb_t *rlp;
    mp_size_t qxn = 0;
    mp_limb_t s2p[1] = {0};
    mp_size_t s2n = 1;
    mp_limb_t s3limb = 1;

    /* Use of this function in particular is arbitrary aside from
     * the fact that it is known to demonstrate the problem on my
     * system (my system uses an assembly implementation for it)
     */

    /* Just set to something that will segfault when accessed */
    rlp = (mp_limb_t*)0x1234;
    mpn_divrem_1(rlp, qxn, s2p, s2n, s3limb);
    return 1;
}
```



```
$ gcc test.c -lgmp
$ ./a.exe && echo $?
0
```


It *should* print that it got a SIGSEGV and exit with the corresponding exit code (139).  A "normal" program dereferencing an invalid pointer will do this just fine on Cygwin.  Instead, it just exits 0, which is the (somewhat unfortunate) behavior when a program crashes outside Cygwin's control.  If I run it in gdb I do see that an access violation occurs inside the assembly implementation of `mpn_divrem_1` when it first tries to write something to `*rlp`.

I've been experimenting with this a bit further trying to understand exactly where things are going wrong, and while it's still not 100% clear to me it might actually be a bug in the NT kernel, or at least tripping some exceptional behavior *in* exception handling (or maybe a subtle bug in Cygwin related to this).

What I found so far is that in GMP's assembly code it's actually using the `%rbp` register just as a normal register in its calculations.  It saves the old value on the stack and pops it at the end, but this obviously doesn't help if an exception occurs in the function body.  It seems that the NT exception handling code *hates* this.  Indeed I can take a relatively "innocent" program that generates a segfault like:


```
$cat test3.c
```



```c
#include <stdlib.h>


void foo() {
    volatile int *i = (int *)0xffffffff;
    *i = 0;
}


int main(void) {
    foo();
    return 1;
}
```


and modify it like


```
$cat test4.c
```



```c
#include <stdlib.h>


void foo() {
    volatile int *i = (int *)0xffffffff;
    /* First let's do something weird to rbp, just to check a theory... */
    asm("mov $0, %rbp");
    *i = 0;
}


int main(void) {
    foo();
    return 1;
}
```


I compile this like


```
$ gcc -fomit-frame-pointer test4.c
```


so that it doesn't even use `%rbp` in the function prologue and doesn't use it to address local variables, so the disassembly of `foo` in this case looks like:


```
0000000000000000 <foo>:
   0:   48 83 ec 18             sub    $0x18,%rsp
   4:   b8 ff ff ff ff          mov    $0xffffffff,%eax
   9:   48 89 44 24 08          mov    %rax,0x8(%rsp)
   e:   48 c7 c5 00 00 00 00    mov    $0x0,%rbp
  15:   48 8b 44 24 08          mov    0x8(%rsp),%rax
  1a:   c7 00 00 00 00 00       movl   $0x0,(%rax)
  20:   90                      nop
  21:   48 83 c4 18             add    $0x18,%rsp
  25:   c3                      retq
```


so it's not even using `%rbp` (ditto in `main`) except where I set it to zero.

Of course, in Cygwin, by the time the `main` function is called there are actually several layers of initialization before that which are quite complex, at the top of which is where Cygwin's exception handler is installed. So of course when entering `main` the value of `%rbp` is certainly meaningful for walking back up the stack to the frame the exception handler is installed for.

How exactly Windows does this I'm not sure, but what I do know is when setting `%rbp` to some bogus value I actually get a second access violation somewhere in a kernel function called `RtlWalkFrameChain` which is called by `KiUserExceptionDispatcher` (this I know is the function that locates and dispatches user-mode exception handlers, hence the name).  The fact that `RtlWalkFrameChain` itself blows up feels like a bug to me, though obviously by messing with `%rbp` we're violating some assumption it's making.

I need to refresh my memory on how exactly this works, as I know a lot of it has been reverse-engineered.

Regardless, the moral of the story is don't abuse `%rbp` if you expect exception handling to work properly.  This is a problem for GMP...

I think I see now why it's so hell-bent on RBP: For every the compiler generates an entry in the `.xdata` section ("x" for "exception" I guess) of the PE32 binary, which is a table of `UNWIND_INFO` structures explained here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/exception-handling-x64?view=vs-2019#raw-pseudo-operations

Each `UNWIND_INFO` includes an array of special opcodes that explains how that function's frame is set up:

> An array of items that explains the effect of the prolog on the nonvolatile registers and RSP.

It also has a "frame register" field which is non-zero if the function does use a frame pointer like RBP:

> If nonzero, then the function uses a frame pointer (FP), and this field is the number of the nonvolatile register used as the frame pointer, using the same encoding for the operation info field of UNWIND_CODE nodes.

You can use the `dumpbin` utility to view these sections, and indeed running it on `cygwin1.dll` and finding the `UNWIND_INFO` structure for `_cygtls::call` (which is essentially the entrypoint to a Cygwin executable's main thread, and where the exception handler is installed) shows:


```
  00000618 00006E70 00006F77 0026A51C  _ZN7_cygtls5call2EPFjPvS0_ES0_S0_
    Unwind version: 1
    Unwind flags: None
    Size of prologue: 0x0D
    Count of codes: 7
    Frame register: rbp
    Frame offset: 0x0
    Unwind codes:
      0D: ALLOC_SMALL, size=0x20
      09: SET_FPREG, register=rbp, offset=0x00
      06: PUSH_NONVOL, register=rbx
      05: PUSH_NONVOL, register=rsi
      04: PUSH_NONVOL, register=rdi
      03: PUSH_NONVOL, register=r12
      01: PUSH_NONVOL, register=rbp
```


These opcodes basically tell the stack unwinder exactly what it needs to back out of each function on stack until it gets back to the frame where the exception will be handled.

In GCC there are equivalent pseudo-operations that can be used in assembly (I have seen these before but wasn't really sure how they work) named `.seh_*` which are used for generating these `.pdata` and `.xdata` entries for each function in the object file.  You can see these directly in the GCC assembly output on Windows.  For example for my `test3.c` above it outputs:


```
        .globl  foo
        .def    foo;    .scl    2;      .type   32;     .endef
        .seh_proc       foo
foo:
        pushq   %rbp
        .seh_pushreg    %rbp
        movq    %rsp, %rbp
        .seh_setframe   %rbp, 0
        subq    $16, %rsp
        .seh_stackalloc 16
        .seh_endprologue
        movl    $4294967295, %eax
...
```


This explicitly delineates which instructions comprise the function's prologue and what they do: push register RBP on the stack, set a frame pointer at 0 offst from RBP, allocate 16 bytes on the stack.

If assembled with the `-fomit-frame-pointer` flag it's even simpler, as to be expected:


```
        .globl  foo
        .def    foo;    .scl    2;      .type   32;     .endef
        .seh_proc       foo
foo:
        subq    $24, %rsp
        .seh_stackalloc 24
        .seh_endprologue
        movl    $4294967295, %eax
...
```


i.e. just allocate 24 bytes on the stack.

I hand modified the assembly for `test4.c` above so that `foo` is defined:


```
        .globl  foo
        .def    foo;    .scl    2;      .type   32;     .endef
        .seh_proc       foo
foo:
        pushq   %rbp
        .seh_pushreg    %rbp
        subq    $24, %rsp
        .seh_stackalloc 24
        .seh_endprologue
        movl    $4294967295, %eax
        movq    %rax, 8(%rsp)
        mov $0, %rbp
        movq    8(%rsp), %rax
        movl    $0, (%rax)
        nop
        addq    $24, %rsp
        popq    %rbp
        ret
        .seh_endproc
```


So it notes explicitly that `%rbp` is a non-volatile register that should be saved (it doesn't say anything about it serving in this function as a frame pointer in the case of this function).

But with this bit in place (and it *must* include the `.seh_pushreg` or else it doesn't work) the kernel can successfully unwind the stack to where the exception is handled by Cygwin.

So this is what the assembly code in GMP should be doing, but isn't.  I'll propose a patch for that and see if I can get it into Cygwin's GMP package if nothing else.  In the meantime I'd need another workaround...

Here is a branch that adds my latest patch to GAP for Cygwin.

It is based on my PR, but backported for the 4.10-stable branch so that it applies to the current GAP used in Sage.  This approach to fixing the issue hasn't been approved upstream yet so I would hold off on merging this until there's been more time for things to settle.

But I can confirm that this does fix (or at least successfully work around) the problem for me in all known cases so it would still be good to include this if it is not fixed soon in GAP.

I'll also note that this patch has no impact on other platforms, so it is not a runtime requirement for GAP on any other platform.
