# Issue 26460: Py3 : Fix py3 errors in sage.rings.tate_algebra* files

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26697

$ sage -t --long src/sage/rings/tate_algebra*

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/rings/tate_algebra_element.pyx  # 63 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/rings/tate_algebra_ideal.pyx  # 29 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/rings/tate_algebra.py  # 4 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```


Only two simple errors cause all the doctests failures "RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration" and "TypeError: Expected list, got range". `range` and `items` returning iterators instead of list in py3.
