At the moment only symbols allow basic assumptions (i.e. generic declarations). Newly defined functions are ignored in `GDecl` and then bail out (because `Expression.assume` only can work with relations). Preinstalled functions will have statements about them in the assumption database, as well, and maybe it's useful for the user to be able to make assertions, but `Function` is ignored as well and bails out for the same reason as above.

The Pynac side will have a first implementation in 0.4.3.
