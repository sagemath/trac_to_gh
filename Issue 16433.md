Keywords: orthogonal, holonomic

At the moment just the Chebyshev polynomials are symbolic. Missing are `hermite`, `laguerre`, `legendreP`, `legendreQ`, `ultraspherical` (=`gegenbauer`), and, while the Stirling and Euler polynomials are not orthogonal, they are holonomic and belong to the standard repertoire, so we're including them here.

For the record, using FLINT's `arith_chebyshev_t_polynomial` for `chebyshev_T` in `ZZ[]` is twice as slow as the current Sage implementation.

Really? For me flint constructs T_10000 in 0.009 seconds while Sage's chebyshev_T takes 1 second.

But *evaluating* a Chebyshev polynomial is a completely different problem. You want to do that by recurrence relations, not by constructing the polynomial and evaluating it.

Ah, that's true. I only tested at T_500.

The speed issue is now #16812

I think the scope of the ticket is too broad. Let's make it a meta-ticket.
