So every call to `iter()` will create kind of \"implicit object\" by calling `__iter__()` that by design of `yield` statement will create a state for an iterator.

Trying to understand... So every call to `iter()` will create kind of "implicit object" by calling `__iter__()` that by design of `yield` statement will create a state for an iterator. But because it is "implicit", there can no explicit destructor? Then the iterator must add a back-reference to some class variable, I guess. Something like


```
class Foo:
    sometype refs
    def __init__():
        refs = []
    def __iter__():
        x = reserve_memory()
        refs.append(x)
        . . .
    def __dealloc__():
        for x in refs:
            release_memory(x)
```

What's this:


```
import gc

i = 0
GG = graphs()
_ = next(GG); _ = next(GG); 
for P in GG:
    if i > 20000: break
    if i % 1000 == 0:
        _ = gc.collect()
        print get_memory_usage(), P.order()
    i += 1
    _ = P.convexity_properties()
```


??? There is an explicit `__destruct__` in class `ConvexityProperties`.

By the way, (with `_ = ...` present) do you notice that it stabilises approximately half-way, stops growing? Feels like an internal cache somewhere fills in, and then it's full, so no extra growth...

Yes, I have noticed that. And sometime the grow stalls for a while and then continues.
