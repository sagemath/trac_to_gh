Some doc nitpicks:

```diff
-    - `n` -- a nonnegative integer (the index)
+    - ``n`` -- a nonnegative integer (the index)
```

and

```diff
     INPUT:
 
-    - `p` a Dyck path in the `(a \times b)`-rectangle
+    - ``p`` -- a Dyck path in the `(a \times b)`-rectangle
 
-    - `i` an integer between `0` and `a+b-1`
+    - ``i`` -- an integer between `0` and `a+b-1`
```

Otherwise LGTM and you can set a positive review once changed.
