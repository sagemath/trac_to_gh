An interactive vector graphics editor accessible from the Sage notebook or the command-line may have a variety of uses:

* Drawing diagrams.
* Annotating images.  See [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/contents.html)'s [SVG backend](http://matplotlib.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/matplotlib/trunk/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_svg.py?view=markup).
* Manipulating graphs and knots.
* Animating objects.  See [SMIL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronized_Multimedia_Integration_Language).
* Creating a free-form 2D workspace.

Candidates:

* [SVG-edit](http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/) - seems very promising; actively developed.
* [SVG web](http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/) - can render SVG via Flash for IE; actively developed.

See [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/86429406fb3bba17/dd3163cb2a47fa38?#dd3163cb2a47fa38) for some discussion.

What do you mean ? Do you agree or disagree with me ?

If somebody wants to edit an SVG file, she can use any existing SVG editor. I do not
see why sage should provide such an editor. Do we aim to replace every single software around ? Has this anything to do with mathematics ?

It seems there are at least some valid use cases, e.g. for graphical notebook widgets for objects in Sage (something which is actively being explored).

I don't know that there's necessarily a case within that for editing arbitrary SVG graphics, though I don't think there'd much case to be made for this outside the context of a notebook widget (anything beyond that is maybe too complicated...)
