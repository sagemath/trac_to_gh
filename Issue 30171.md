CC:  mkoeppe chapoton

Adds the current configuration of pycodestyle (as taken from the patchbot) to the src/tox.ini file. Thus, it can be run now locally via the cli `pycodestyle`. Moreover, tools like VS Code can pick it up automatically. The corresponding changes for the patchbot are done in https://github.com/sagemath/sage-patchbot/pull/145.

Documentation will be added in #30361.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30408

I've no experience with tox, and thus cannot decide if this makes sense or not. Feel free to hijack this PR and add the necessary config.

This definitely makes sense! However, the last time I tried to point vscode to the local sage python environment, it didn't work. My hope was that with the inplace compilation it will work.

If you want to enable type checking in a purely pythonic environment, then perhaps mypy (or pytype or PyCharm) are better alternatives. Pyright was mainly designed to be used in combination with VS code and for CI. Anyway, that's not the topic of this ticket ;-).
