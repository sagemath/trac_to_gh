in method `flow`, I'm not completely sure that this code is safe

```
        if not integer and use_edge_labels is False:
            obj = Integer(obj)
```

Indeed, now the value `obj` is computed using the values of the flow variables and we either convert the values of the flow variables to `Integer` or we use the base ring of the MILP solver when `integer` is `False`.
`obj` is the balance of flow at the source.

Before, we had:

```
        obj = p.solve(log=verbose)
        if integer or use_edge_labels is False:
            obj = Integer(round(obj))
```

I think this will lead to errors if the `obj` (computed from the backend arc flow values) is not an exact integer.

```
sage: ZZ(1.9999999999)
TypeError: Attempt to coerce non-integral RealNumber to Integer
```

I think a better solution is to have this handled directly by `get_values`:
When the given edge capacities are `ZZ` (or the implicit capacities of 1 are used), pass `convert=ZZ` to `get_values`, not `convert=True`.
