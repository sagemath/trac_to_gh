Changing keywords from "" to "random_fail".

I don't know if it is related, but the `KeyError` part reminds me of a failure reported by Justin on 9.5.rc4, see #33231.

The KeyError is just because the value isn't cached, in response to it we try to compute the value and thats where things go wrong. So I don't think it has anything to do with the KeyError.

The inner traceback was truncated, is now complete.

I see this too when doctesting `9.6`. It's difficult to reproduce when testing individually.

Is this a duplicate of #30419 ?
