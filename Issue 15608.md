# Issue 15608: sage -dev set_remote allows illegal branch names

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15845

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2014-02-22 17:38:48

Fortunately pushing them is still impossible.

(after creating a local branch and pulling the same ticket)

```
sage: dev.set_remote('ticket/15286','u/ncohen/15286')
The remote branch "u/ncohen/15286" is not in your user scope. You probably do not have
permission to push to that branch.

#  You can always use "u/rws/u/ncohen/15286" as the remote branch name.

sage: dev.set_remote('ticket/15286','ncohen/15286')

sage: dev.push()
The branch "ncohen/15286" does not exist on the remote server.
Create new remote branch? [Yes/no] Y
GitError: git exited with a non-zero exit code (1).
This happened while executing "git push ssh://git@trac.sagemath.org:2222/sage.git
ticket/15286:ncohen/15286".
git printed nothing to STDOUT.
git printed the following to STDERR:
