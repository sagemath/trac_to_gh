I have implemented some gap functionality for finitely presented groups in #12339. I have also considered using kbmag's abiluty to solve the word problem (sometimes) via Knuth-Bendix or automatic structures, but i don't like the fact of depending on having kbmag installed. Maybe i will include that in a separate package.
