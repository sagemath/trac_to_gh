CC:  sage-combinat salisbury1

Keywords: lie algebras

This should work but doesn't:

```
sage: L = lie_algebras.cross_product(QQ)
sage: pbw = L.pbw_basis()
sage: L(pbw(L.an_element())) == L.an_element() # BOOM
```

This is due to not setting `inverse_on_support` when creating the coercion. This also exposes the need to overwrite `term` for `LieAlgebraWithStructureCoefficients`.
