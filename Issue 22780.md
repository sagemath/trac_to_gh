Some details of the Sage docstring styles are not clearly stated in the developer manual, and left to each writer's discretion. This introduced inconsistencies and sometimes allowed bad styles. The purpose of this ticket is to spot those details and provide specific guidelines for them, based on the consensus of the developer community.

The guidelines collected here will be used to revise 

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings

P1.

P2.

G1. Write 

```
   Return True if something is true.
```
but don't write 

```
   Return ``True`` if something is true.
```
The same applies to `False` and `None`

G2. Write

```
if the lattice is reflexive ...
```
but don't write

```
if ``self`` is reflexive ...
```

G3. Write

```
Return True if the lattice is reflexive.
```
but do not write

``` 
Return True if the lattice is reflexive and False otherwise."
```
nor

``` 
Return whether the lattice is reflexive.
```
nor

``` 
Test if the lattice is reflexive.
```

G4. OUTPUT block is optional

G5. Write

```
OUTPUT:

- lattice
```
but do not write

```
OUTPUT:

a lattice
```

I would like to add that `INPUT` and `OUTPUT` blocks should be sufficiently verbose.

Some places in Sage have something like

```
INPUT:

- ``x`` -- integer
```

Well, that's not very useful. If should explain the purpose of `x`, not just the fact that it's an integer.

It might also be good to formally define the style of types and defaults in `INPUT` blocks. I usually use

Strong -1 to G1. `True` and similar should be code because they are Python objects.

Strong -1 to G2. `self` is a well-defined concept in Python, more concise, and more clear when subclasses are involved.

Subsequently, I see no good options in G3. However, option 3 is closet, and I prefer:

```
Return whether ``self`` is reflexive.
```

G4: recommended but optional. This is what we primarily do in practice anyways.

+1 on comment:5, although I do a slightly different style

```
INPUT:

- ``p`` -- integer (default: `11`); the modulus for the modular algorithm
```

have you considered here the guidelines for writing an exception string? 

no beginning upper case, no final full stop is what i've been told, but i just quickly checked [documentation strings chapter](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings) and there are seemingly no guidelines. 

only: ``“It is an error to [..]”``

No. This ticket is about docstrings.

    OUTPUT: a pair ``(ec, edges)``, where ``ec`` is the edge
    connectivity, ``edges`` is the list of edges in a minimum cut.
```

Here, there is no explicit `INPUT` but I don't think it's needed anyway.

Certainly there are many cases that `INPUT` block is not needed, and in practice we do not add one in such cases. So `not optional` is too much prohibitive. I just removed the sentence.

If you want to follow the guidelines here (all Sphinx directives are written in uppercase), then you should change ".. code-block::" to ".. CODE-BLOCK::". You should also change it from ".. code-block:: none" to ".. CODE-BLOCK:: rest".

The bulleted point starting with "Lines should be shorter than 80 characters." has a line which is exactly 80 characters, so perhaps that should be broken up so all lines are shorter than 80 characters. Some of the other lines (for example in the paragraph starting "The decomposition of the free module ..." are now longer than 80 characters.

Why did you delete "If it contains multiple lines, all the lines after the first need to begin at the same indentation as the backtick"? I think that is helpful information, and people often make mistakes with this indentation in docstrings.
