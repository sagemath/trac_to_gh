This should never happen:

sage: p.variable_max(1)

The method name changed

```
AttributeError: 'sage.numerical.backends.glpk_backend.GLPKBackend' object has no attribute 'variable_max'
```
But still (with #19525 applied)

```
sage: p.variable_upper_bound(1)
sig_error() without sig_on()
...
------------
Unhandled SIGABRT: An abort() occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
