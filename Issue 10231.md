This should never happen:


```python
sage: from sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend import get_solver
sage: p = get_solver(solver = "GLPK") 
sage: p.ncols()
0
sage: p.add_variable()
1
sage: p.variable_max(0)

sage: p.variable_max(1)
glp_get_col_ub: j = 2; column number out of range
Error detected in file glpapi02.c at line 350
/home/malb/Sage/sage-current/local/bin/sage-sage: line 220: 23183 Aborted                 sage-ipython "$`@`" -i
```

The method name changed

```
AttributeError: 'sage.numerical.backends.glpk_backend.GLPKBackend' object has no attribute 'variable_max'
```

But still (with #19525 applied)

```
sage: p.variable_upper_bound(1)
sig_error() without sig_on()
...
------------
Unhandled SIGABRT: An abort() occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aborted
```

I think the title of this ticket needs to be changed to be more specific.

I've never seen `<double?>` syntax. What does it do?

Replying to [comment:12 dimpase]:

It is a Cython cast with type checking: [see the documentation](http://docs.cython.org/src/reference/language_basics.html#type-checking).
