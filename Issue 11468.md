# Issue 11468: Remove DB_HOME in preference of SAGE_DATA

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11640

Original creator: ohanar

Original creation time: 2011-08-01 23:58:27

Assignee: jason

CC:  cremona was

Keywords: SAGE_DATA, DB_HOME

Currently `DB_HOME` is defined in various files throughout sage, and in all but one case they point to `SAGE_DATA`. I've attached a patch to remove these in preference of the, in my opinion, more standard `SAGE_DATA`.
