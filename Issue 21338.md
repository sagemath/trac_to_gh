Keywords: quasisymmetric functions, QSym, posets, p-partitions

The P-partition enumerator of a labelled poset can be generalized by endowing elements of the posets with weight. This is an idea going back to Malvenuto and Reutenauer; I am using it in http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08355 . The branch implements this in a rather straightforward way.
