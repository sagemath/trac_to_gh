I think this change should not needed, at least the concatenation function should handle any iterable as input.

Plus in general, while there _are_ many bugs on Python 3 where the return value of `map()` is assumed to be a list, I think a better approach to those cases is often to convert the `map()` call to a list comprehension.  That way you aren't needlessly copying the list on Python 2.
