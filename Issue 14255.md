The q_bernoulli function does not appear in the doc, this corrects that.

Hey Frederic,

Thankfully the doc built without errors, however the `q_bernoulli.pyx` didn't have a module level doc (hence no title). I've uploaded a review patch which adds that. If it looks good to you, feel free to set this to positive review.

Thanks,

Travis
