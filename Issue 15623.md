Keywords: symbolic function, inject, space


```
sage: function('A,B')
(A, B)
sage: A
A
sage: B
B
sage: function('C, D')
(C,  D)
sage: C
C
sage: D

----> 1 D

NameError: name 'D' is not defined
```

IMHO `function('C, D')` should work, i.e., the function `D` should be injected into the workspace.

The corresponding command with `var` works:

```
sage: var('c, d')
(c, d)
sage: c
c
sage: d
d
```


Further, the following works:

```
sage: C, D = function('C, D')
sage: C
C
sage: D
 D
```


This might also be related with the additional spacing, which occurs in the following:

```
sage: C, D = function('C, D')
sage: C(D(x))
C( D(x))
```

(the space in `C( D(x))`, which should also be corrected (removed).
