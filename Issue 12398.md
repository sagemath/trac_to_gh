#12416 disables extra flags for XCode 4, but the check for the XCode version is still in place.  Remove it completely, as XCode 4.3 doesn't have `xcodebuild` by default.

It fixes a problem I just had building 5.0.beta6 on sqrt5.cs.washington.edu.
As it seems to have an unusual configuration, I refrain from setting the positive_review on (it's my 1st attempt to work with OSX 10.7)
