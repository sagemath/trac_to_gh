# Issue 24947: Replace attrcall by operator.methodcaller

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25184

The functionality provided by `sage.misc.misc.attrcall` is exactly the same as the Python standard function `operator.methodcaller`, so we might as well use the latter.

`operator.methodcaller` is worse: it doesn't support pickling and doesn't support getting the method name.
