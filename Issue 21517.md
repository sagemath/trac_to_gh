Maybe a bit obscure but still a bug:

```
sage: SR(2).power(SR(QQbar(3).sqrt() + QQbar(2).sqrt()), hold=True)
2^3.146264369941973?
sage: _.n()
...
TypeError: no canonical coercion from Algebraic Field to Rational Field
```

Reason is that in `Expression.n()` the special sum treatment via `class DefiniteSumExpander(ExpressionTreeWalker)` leaves arithmetic operations to the superclass where (if all numeric) they are reduced to their non-symbolic calls, i.e. here, `2^QQbar(...)` which gives the error (correctly, see https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/sage-support/_7eGYj92Igw).

As we want to hold the power until later numerical conversion we want to override `arithmetic` in `DefiniteSumExpander`.

You added a method without neither documentation nor tests.

The following still fails

```
sage: SR(2) ^ SR(QQbar(3).sqrt() + QQbar(2).sqrt())
```

Would it be possible to hold the power automatically when there is no simplification?

In a locally used class, come on, show me one example where this is done in Sage. It won't show in coverage, either:

```
ralf@ark:~/sage> ./sage -coverage src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx
------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCORE src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx: 100.0% (220 of 220)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The test is in the containing function, of course.

I can catch the type error, but then I will catch all type errors. Is this desireable?
