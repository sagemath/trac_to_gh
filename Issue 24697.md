CC:  @jdemeyer

Keywords: padicIMA

Currently, orders are not unique parents

```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: loads(dumps(K.maximal_order())) is K.maximal_order()
False
```

However, `order` and `maximal_order` rely on a ``@`cached_method`, so you usually don't see this behaviour:

```
sage: K.maximal_order() is K.maximal_order()
True
```

This ticket fixes this by creating orders in a factory.

This ticket also drops the keyword `allow_subfield` that did not really do anything before, see #16046.

Maximal orders are not handled correctly by my code:

```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: O = K.order(i)
sage: O
Order in Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
sage: K.maximal_order()

sage: O.is_maximal()
True
sage: K.maximal_order()

IMO, you should subclass `UniqueRepresentation` rather than make a `UniqueFactory` as it makes the layout easier (no separate factory object or class that handles the uniqueness). While sometimes there are good reasons to not do this, usually I find the code easier to understand and maintain by using `UniqueRepresentation`.

I have always found it harder to do maintenance on `UniqueFactory` objects than `UniqueRepresentation` objects due to the increased code complexity and non-locality. Plus `UniqueRepresentation` has slightly better behavior (see `structure/factory.pyx` and `structure/unique_representation.py` docs).

In addition, for `UniqueFactory`, the documentation either has to be duplicated with the factory and the actual class or you have to pick-and-choose which one gets what documentation. So it makes it hard to work with the interactive documentation.

So in my mind, it is a technical debt taken on to use `UniqueFactory` when not necessary and not simply a matter of taste.
