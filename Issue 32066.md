Make-building Sage 9.4.rc0 on Cygwin fails shortly after the beginning of numpy installation:

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Sage definitely does not install Python 3.6.13. You are trying to do an incremental build using a system python version that is no longer supported. Just rebuild from scratch.

(See #29708 for the task of catching this in the configuration phase.)

Ah! I was thinking Sage would automatically update all packages, or, if a system package was used that is now out of date, automatically switch to its own version. But that's probably harder than it sounds...
