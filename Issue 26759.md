Presumably `/home/sverre/sage/local/lib64` is a symlink, and overwriting it with an actual directory fails.

So? That's intentional.  Package installations shouldn't overwrite existing non-directories with directories.  There's no reason they should have a symlink named `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib64`.  The real question is why that's there.

I've spent more time understanding the gcc build system and the "multilib" settings, and now I understand Debian's patches better as well, which include patching many of the target config files under `gcc/config` to not use lib64.  I can see this on my own GCC on Debian by running


```
$ gcc -print-multi-os-directory
../lib
```


This path is appended to `${libdir}/` by the build system to specify the installation path for the target native libraries installed by gcc, so for example libstdc++.so would get installed to `${libdir}/../lib}`, or in other words just `lib/`.

However, with the target fragments in the gcc source, the bootstrap gcc that is built during stage 1 one of the build process ends up with `../lib64` for this, and hence builds all its libraries to also go in lib64.

However, I think I've figured out a bit of a hack to change the multilib settings without patching, in such a way that should work on any platform we care about.  I'll probably also propose an upstream patch to make this easier, because really it's pretty straightforward and otherwise supported by the build system.  It's just trickier than it should be to get the right flags specified in the right place.

Since this is only really an issue with installing the gcc and gfortran SPKGs on Linux, the specific case reported in this ticket is fixed by #27016, since those packages will no longer create files in lib64.

I opted for now to keep the symlink to lib64 just in case *something* needs it (though I can't find any specific case), and because having it will alert us in the future to packages trying to install files to lib64.

In the `spkg-install` for ecl there's a line

That one is a known issue from #22626 [comment:423](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22626#comment:432).  The upstream tarball actually contains a file that randomly has read-only permissions for no good reason.

It seems that still has not been fixed.  Not clear what the appropriate solution is.  Just chmod everything to `u+rw` when extracting a tarball?

We apply a umask but that's different.  And I think it has `0` in the user bits, so that means if a file happens to be read-only for some reason that will be preserved.

The former is a problem with the GAP tarball.  I think we should just make a special case fix for that in the GAP spkg for now; see comment:13.

I think the latter might be because of #27124 or possibly #27223.  In other words, it's likely that some previous bug meant the package could not be correctly uninstalled first.

For GAP, and indeed in general, I would be tempted to do this:

```diff
diff --git a/build/sage_bootstrap/uncompress/tar_file.py b/build/sage_bootstrap/uncompress/tar_file.py
index 57621527ac..cf707e78a3 100644

         tarinfo.mode &= ~(stat.S_ISUID | stat.S_ISGID)
         return super(SageBaseTarFile, self).chmod(tarinfo, targetpath)

```

I can't tell whether that's a good idea.

It looks like Sage's version of `tar_file.py` helps if the permissions in the tarball are too lenient, but not if they're too strict, as in this case.

Yeah, I wouldn't be opposed to that.  I don't think there's any good reason for a package to be *installing* read-only files.

> Showing up in `pillow` as well, as reported in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/kU5M1QVuQQY/DY3l67DUAwAJ

an unpleasant part of it is that the installation attempt happens from within distutils or setuptools, called from within pillow's `setup.py`.

would it be better to make `lib64/` a proper directory, install stuff there, and then do a kind of postinstall that would move/link/copy stuff over to `lib/` ?
