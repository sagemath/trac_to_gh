lgtm but I'm surprised that there aren't more such references in language/tutorial (there aren't).  It seems like only the Japanese and English versions are "full" in this sense; that is too bad, because it looks like there is a lot of useful information missing in those other sagetex.rst files :(

This is obviously a dependency of #22499 now.
