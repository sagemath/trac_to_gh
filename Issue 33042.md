Currently, there is a special class for derivations over function field but this class does not derive from `RingDerivation` with the consequence that such derivations cannot be used to create Ore polynomial rings.


```
sage: F.<x> = FunctionField(GF(5))
sage: S.<d> = F['d', F.derivation()]
BOUM
```
