# Issue 33042: Derivations over function fields should be instances of RingDerivation

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33279

Original creator: caruso

Original creation time: 2022-02-03 10:02:49

CC:  rpages

Currently, there is a special class for derivations over function field but this class does not derive from `RingDerivation` with the consequence that such derivations cannot be used to create Ore polynomial rings.


```
sage: F.<x> = FunctionField(GF(5))
sage: S.<d> = F['d', F.derivation()]
BOUM
```

LGTM once you fix the pyflakes unused import warnings. Once done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
