I intentionally kept the definitions of `PyDictEntry` etc. out of the `pxd`: I didn't feel that it was the task of that pxd to provide interfaces to CPython API, in particular because they are Py2/Py3 dependent. Do you have a good reason to start exposing these in the pxd? Also, differentiating between the different fields depending on implementation by just comments seems a little fragile to me. It punts all errors to the c compile, whereas the cythonization can already fail here.

The main reason is to eventually move those to Cython itself. Usually, Cython upstream welcomes additional declarations regarding the CPython API.

I'm a little hesitant to name this a good API choice. Since this ticket is only about refactoring, I think we only want to merge it if it actually improves the API and the reasons above make me doubt that.

I don't think the change proposed is disastrous either, so if there's another reviewer who thinks the proposed change really does provide an improvement, I won't argue.

The easiest way to accomplish integration into cython is probably just to generate a pull request to include these definitions into `site-packages/Cython/Includes/cpython/dict.pxd`.

It'll be relatively complicated, because Cython tries to generate C-code that can be compiled against `Py2` as well as `Py3` and they are fundamentally incompatible for this.

It just looks wrong to me because the struct definition is not a subset of the fields available (not on Py2 and not on Py3), and there's a struct definition that is not available on Py3.

That's not the issue: You're adding functionality to the `pxd`, giving a reason to include this `pxd` for reasons other than including `del_dictitem_by_exact_value`.
