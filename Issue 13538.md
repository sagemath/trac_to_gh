Hi Nathann, why do you insert `check_input = False` into several examples?
IMHO one example like that should suffice.

Why do you have `check_input = False` in
in `b/sage/combinat/integer_vector_weighted.py`? Is it because it fails otherwise? 
There is also a typo in line 6 of this file, please fix.

In the attached patch I've cleaned up `combinat/integer_vector_weighted.py` which was making permutations from anything that crawls, and also removed some, although not all,  `check_input=False` from `combinat/permutation.py`.

One has to decide what to do with Robinson-Schensted. As it can be applied to non-permutations, it must leave the Permutation class and get a real place somewhere. This would allow a good cleanup of `combinat/permutation.py`.

Well, we can check that if the input is a list, then it has size n, can't we ? With the patch we already check that no element appears twice. I updated the patch again, and this is now checked too.

Note that this made method ``from_major_code`` raise Exceptions, as it builds things like Permutation([9]). I added `check_input = False` inside of it, but it still checks the Permutation is returns. I also added a warning.
