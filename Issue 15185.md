1) The following should be an `ArithmeticError` since whether or not the polynomial factors depends on the `O(3^20)` error term (`t^2 - 3^20` factors while `t^2 - 3^21` does not):

```
sage: R.<t> = PolynomialRing(Qp(3))
sage: (t^2).factor()
((1 + O(3^20))*t + (O(3^20)))^2
```


2) The following should directly call PARI's `factorpadic` without coercing the coefficients to `Qp` first:

```
sage: ((t-1)^2).factor_padic(3,5)
(1 + O(3^5))*t^2 + (1 + 2*3 + 2*3^2 + 2*3^3 + 2*3^4 + O(3^5))*t + (1 + O(3^5))
```

Why **should** we do that? My point of view is that we should warn people that they do something which is not mathematically well-defined.

Really? Can you give an example of a result which changed? The following happens both before and after my patch:

```
sage: parent(polygen(Zp(3, 20, 'capped-abs')).content())
Monoid of ideals of 3-adic Ring with capped absolute precision 20

```


This is exactly the same as factoring `t^2 - (1 + O(2^2))`, so the latter should be an error also.

(I didn't know about `PrecisionError`, so I'm changing the patch to return a `PrecisionError` instead of `ArithmeticError`).

You're right.  I need to go to sleep now, but I'll think about this more and get back to you tomorrow.  Perhaps we can add an option to pass to `factor` that allows for factoring non-squarefree polynomials.

As for the `content` comment, it was based on reading through the patch and noting that you'd deleted that function in `Polynomial_element_generic.pyx`.  But I see now that it's defined again in the other classes, so there's no issue.

Sorry for the delay again.

You are right that original claim is invalidated by Hensel lifting.  But I still believe that we should factor `t<sup>2+O(3</sup>20)` as `(t + O(3<sup>10))</sup>2` by analogy with linear algebra.  Here's what I mean.

Consider the problem of finding the kernel of a matrix `A` over the p-adics.  Sometimes, we will be able to tell that this kernel is trivial (when 

```
A = [1 + O(3^20)     O(3^20)]
    [    O(3^20) 1 + O(3^20)]
```

for example).  But other times we don't know if the dimension is 0 or 1:

```
A = [1 + O(3^20)     O(3^20)]
    [    O(3^20)     O(3^20)],
```

or even if the dimension is 0, 1 or 2:

```
A = [    O(3^20)     O(3^20)]
    [    O(3^20)     O(3^20)].
```

We often design algorithms so that they produce a matrix with non-trivial kernel, and rely on being able to find it.  I don't want Sage to raise a `PrecisionError` whenever there is a nontrivial kernel.

Of course, if the matrix *does* have a kernel then we can find it, and we can determine the precision to which we know that kernel.  I would argue that that is the more useful answer.  In the same way, if a user actually has a polynomial that is not squarefree, it's more useful to tell them that the polynomial factors in a certain way, assuming that it's reducible in the first place.

I think it's a question of how we warn the user that the result is uncertain in this way: include a warning in the documentation of `factor` or raise a `PrecisionError` unless the user passes in a certain keyword argument.  If we disagree on which option is more appropriate in this case, I would suggest bringing the issue up on `sage-nt` and `sage-padic`.

I would say it is more useful to tell them that their question is not well-defined. Because, in this case, it is possible to make the question well-defined by either increasing the precision of the given polynomial or by starting with a polynomial over `QQ`.

> raise a `PrecisionError` unless the user passes in a certain keyword argument.
I could live with this, if the default is to raise the exception.
