Code looks good. Setting defaut strategy to "rigorous" because it quite consistently performs better.

Setting to "Needs review" and priority to "major" to reflect the normal status of almost-ready-to be merged tickets (and trigger doctests)

I guess the "build & test" badge is the new doctester. It displays an error, but that is in a test for parallel code in `map_reduce`, which this ticket does not touch. So that must be a failure that is orthogonal to this ticket.

So: Positive review!
