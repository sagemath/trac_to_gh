The method `QuaternionFractionalIdeal_rational.scale()` simply copies over the existing left and right orders of `self` to the scaled ideal. This is incorrect when the scaling factor does not lie in the center of the algebra, as demonstrated by this example:


```sage
sage: Quat.<i,j,k> = QuaternionAlgebra(-1,-19)
sage: a = 1+2*i+3*j+4*k
sage: I = Quat.maximal_order().unit_ideal()
sage: I.right_order()
Order of Quaternion Algebra (-1, -19) with base ring Rational Field with basis (1/2 + 1/2*j, 1/2*i + 1/2*k, j, k)
sage: I.scale(a).right_order()
Order of Quaternion Algebra (-1, -19) with base ring Rational Field with basis (1/2 + 1/2*j, 1/2*i + 1/2*k, j, k)
sage: J = Quat.ideal(I.scale(a).basis(), check=False)
sage: J == I.scale(a)
True
sage: J.right_order()
Order of Quaternion Algebra (-1, -19) with base ring Rational Field with basis (1/2 + 1/10*j + 109/5*k, 1/48*i + 1/120*j + 8411/240*k, 1/5*j + 218/5*k, 120*k)
```

This looks OK to me but I'm not an expert so I have two questions:

1. I guess scaling on the right doesn't affect the left order, and vice-versa?
2. Is it OK to assume that the base ring is `QQ`?

Thanks for having a look.

1. Yes; the left order of `I` is `{x in the algebra | x·I ⊆ I}`. Scaling happens element-wise, so these inclusions are preserved under right scaling. Similarly on the other side.
2. Yes; the class `QuaternionFractionalIdeal_rational` is specific to `QQ`.
