Clearly the dtor is racing with the sage-cleaner process that is deleting the temporary directory:

```
File "src/sage/interfaces/psage.py", line 114, in sage.interfaces.psage.PSage.__del__
Failed example:
    PSage().__del__()
Expected nothing
Got:
    Exception ignored in: <function ExpectElement.__del__ at 0xd14d6388>
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/buildbot/slave/sage_git/build/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sage/interfaces/expect.py", line 1513, in __del__
        P.clear(self._name)
      File "/home/buildbot/slave/sage_git/build/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sage/interfaces/sage0.py", line 369, in clear
        self.eval('del %s' % var)
      File "/home/buildbot/slave/sage_git/build/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sage/interfaces/psage.py", line 129, in eval
        if self.is_locked():
      File "/home/buildbot/slave/sage_git/build/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sage/interfaces/psage.py", line 97, in is_locked
        with open(self.__tmp) as fobj:
    FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/buildbot/slave/sage_git/dot_sage/temp/sagebu16_32s02/3311/sage_smpux8mxorv//lock'

This is a race condition:

```
        if os.path.exists(f):
            os.remove(f)
```

The only safe way is to delete and catch the potential OSError
