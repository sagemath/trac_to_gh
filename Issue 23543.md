Keywords: Gauss sums, Gross-Koblitz formula

The Gross-Koblitz formula for p-adic computation of Gauss sums was implemented in #23456. The formula involves working in the ramified extension of `Q_p` generated by an element `pi` for which `pi^(p-1) == -p`; however, the formula actually is written as a power of `pi` times an element of `Z_p`, and for some applications (e.g., hypergeometric motives; see #23671) it would be helpful to be able to access the unramified factor without going through the extension ring (for efficiency when `p` is large). That is, one should have the option to request the output in the form `(e, z)` where `e` is a nonnegative integer, `z` is an element of `Z_p`, and the real answer is `pi^e*z` for `pi` as above. And in this case, the extension field should not be formed at all.
