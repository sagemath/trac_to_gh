This ticket adds an example of a magma.


```
sage: M = Magmas().example(); M
An example of a magma: the free magma generated by ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
sage: a, b, c, d = M.magma_generators()
sage: a * (b * c) * (d * a * b)
'((a*(b*c))*((d*a)*b))'
```


This is in part motivated by [this ask-sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/50799/polynomial-ring-indexed-over-an-abelian-group-magma/) and by the seeming lack of magmas in Sage.
