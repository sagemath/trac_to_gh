# Issue 30609: move `src/bin/sage-list-packages` to `build/bin`

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30846

(from #30747)

We move `src/bin/sage-list-packages` to `build/bin`. It is only used in `build/bin/sage-site` (to implement `sage --installed` etc.) and not documented individually as a script.

Why are lines like

```
if [ "$1" = '-optional' -o "$1" = "--optional" ]; then
    shift
    exec sage-list-packages optional $@
fi
```

in both `src/bin/sage` and `build/bin/sage-site`? In any case, this ticket looks like a good time to delete those from `src/bin/sage`, unless I'm missing something.

Thanks for catching this. Looks like something went wrong when resolving a merge conflict at some point.
