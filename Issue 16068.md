When the environment variable `MPLCONFIGDIR` is set by `sage-env`, other important bits of initialisation on which it depends has not been done yet; see comment:17:ticket:15901 and follow-up comments.  We should move this part of `sage-env` further down.

Should we just move the `MPLCONFIGDIR` part to the very end?  This solves the problem for me.

I'd just swap the parts I've cited; first set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, then `MPLCONFIGDIR`.

OK, that also solves the problem for me.
