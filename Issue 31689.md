sympy uses properties for many things, so we probably cannot achieve direct API compatibility, put perhaps we can use the same vocabulary when it makes sense.

Existing conversions:
- from various sympy set types to Sage `SR` relation expressions: `sage.interfaces.sympy.sympy_set_to_list`
- `RealSet._sympy_condition_` - used internally in `sage.functions.piecewise`

In #31938 we provide an adapter (wrapper) class
that provides the sympy API. The `_sympy_` method of a Sage set can return this wrapper.


Sets would provide a foundation for an improved symbolic assumptions facility, and for representing solution sets to symbolic equations etc.
