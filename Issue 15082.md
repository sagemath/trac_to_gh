# Issue 15082: Update instructions for installing with OS X Mavericks

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15319

On OS X, to install Sage you have to first install the "command-line tools". With OS X Mavericks, the method for doing this has changed, so we need to update our documentation.

Two comments:

1. What about Mountain Lion? I no longer have a 10.8 machine, so I can't check.
2. I think this should wait until we have 10.9 support before going in.

Now that #15433 has positive_review, what should happen with this ticket?

It looks like the [patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/attachment/ticket/15319/trac_15319-root.patch) to the top-level README.txt file didn't get incorporated into the git version. Should we open another ticket?

Okay, see #15783. I'm interpreting [comment:4 comment #4] as a positive review for that ticket.
