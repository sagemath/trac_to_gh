The outer set of parentheses in this change are not necessary:

```diff
     sage: shift = lambda i: [(i+j)%2**3 for j in range(3)]
     sage: for i in range(2**3):
-    ...      print (Word(map(lambda (j,b): b if j in shift(i) else '*',
-    ...                                       enumerate(seq))).string_rep())
+    ....:    print((Word(map(lambda (j,b): b if j in shift(i) else '*',
+    ....:                                     enumerate(seq))).string_rep()))
```

Once this change is made, you can set a positive review.

Can you please undo this change from `src/sage/combinat/debruijn_sequence.pyx`. There is nothing wrong with the use of `print` here and it will cause a conflict with #20554:

```diff
-    ...      print (Word(map(lambda (j,b): b if j in shift(i) else '*',
-    ...                                       enumerate(seq))).string_rep())
+    ....:    print(Word(map(lambda (j,b): b if j in shift(i) else '*',
+    ....:                                     enumerate(seq))).string_rep())
```

Not quite, look at the diff. You also changed `...` to `....:`

bad interference between future moves: print_function and division inside combinat

waiting for the bots again.


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-05-22 13:58:37

ok, bot is "green"

I allow myself to put this back to positive review.
