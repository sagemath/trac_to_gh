Handling of `database_gap` will be delicate. The spkg includes bits removed stuff from `gap` that are expected by default (no need to load if present) and one "real" gap package that one would need to load (`tomlib`). 

That may require special consideration.

Hi Julian,

Just some rambling, thinking about use cases for this ticket or some follow up:

While discussing with the Debian people, it was stressed out that we
will eventually want to be able to support simultaneously a stable
version of software X (as provided by distributions), and a devel
version of it (e.g. for our researchers that need the very latest
features). Therefore we probably will want to have code that could
look like:


```
        def latest_feature():
            """
            ...

            EXAMPLES::

                sage: X = ...
                sage: X.latest_feature()    # optional gap >= 3.5
            """
            GAP(min_version=3.5).require()      # or some better syntax
            ...
            return gap.latest_feature()
```


To support this use case we would need:

- support for version checking in the Feature code (probably in a follow up ticket).

  Probably not much can be written generically, except possibly for Executables,
  trying to pass the --version and scanning the output for something that looks
  like a version number

- some updates to the doctesting framework to support version
  annotations (definitely in another ticket)

- mapping feature names appearing in the #optional annotations to actual Feature's
  (it's going in this direction in #20182).


Not directly related to this ticket, but building on the discussion we had while walking in Cernay, we may want to be able to write the annotation as::


```
        def latest_feature():
            """
            ...

            .. REQUIRES:: gap >= 3.5

            EXAMPLES::

                sage: X = ...
                sage: X.latest_feature()
            """
```


Cheers,
                           Nicolas

I like more the centralized approach in this ticket rather than the one in #20377 in which each feature needs a special care. Though many things looks very complicated and the related #20182 is much more readable (though using inheritance from this ticket would save some efforts). Moreover #20182 implements some *database of available features* which is not discussed here. The latter has the advantage of minimizing the requests time after the first call. With the architecture proposed here, each check involves a `Feature` class creation and some associated test...

Some more specific remarks:

- Do we really care about the class `FeatureTestResult`? If the result is `True` then we mostly don't care about explanation and if it is `False` we likely want an error (with an explicit error message). Similarly, I would get rid of `FeatureNotPresentError`.

- Are you sure `CSDP` is better inside the file `lovasz_theta.py`? Do we want to spread the `Features` all around the modules or should they be centralized?

- Finally class names might be confusing. `GapPackage` is not a handle on a gap package nor something describing what is inside a given package (what I would guess from the name). Similarly, with having `CSDP` has a class when `CSDP` is the name of the program. It would be fine if all of them belong to a fixed module.

The docstring tells you that you might want to cache the result if you think it
is a performance problem. Most of the time you are going to call out to a
binary anyway so I do not see the point of caching it as a default. "Premature
optimization is the root of all evil…"
We could centralize the checks. I do not really have an opinion on that.

That's what `is_present` vs `require` is about. There are places where the default algorithm is chosen depending on the
presence of some feature.

So you have to catch whatever RuntimeError instead of being able to catch
something specific? I do not see the advantage of that. Also, if I understand
your proposal, each caller has to cook up their own error message. I think it
is nice to have a central place where these error messages and resolutions
live.
Finally, with your approach you do not get the granularity between `abc is not
on the path` vs `abc is there but does not work`. That's something that some
people requested.

See above.

GapPackage lives in sage.misc.feature. So it should be clear that this is not
the actual package. We can suffix everything with Feature if that is preferred.
I prefer short class names if possible.

See above. (Sorry if I misunderstood you. It seems you are raising the
centralization vs localization issue several times in your comment.)

> I would be very happy to use this ticket to solve #21135 where I need to set the octave parameters for its Sage interface depending on its version...
It would be great to see somebody use this interface already :)
I have completing this Ticket high on my priority list. I hope I find the time to do this soon.

> hence I am asking whether it would be possible to have a `version` method on `Features` (or at least on `Executable`)? For executable it is reasonable to just have an attribute `_version_cmd_option` (that would generally be `-v` or `--version` or `--dumpversion`) with a default implementation that runs the command with the option `_version_cmd_option`. What do you think?

Sometimes version checking is a good thing to do but I generally follow the autoconf tradition here that sees version numbers as something very unreliable. I think you should check whether the executable provides the interface that you need.

So, I would be reluctant to provide a general interface for version checks. I should certainly add a comment about this somewhere. Anyway, you can extend any Feature. To check for a version you might want to roughly do something like what I did for `StaticFile.absolute_path`.

Sorry, but I am not sure whether I understand your question. Do you mean whether a `Magma` Feature should look at `SAGE_MAGMA_COMMAND` and `SAGE_MAGMA_SERVER`? Yes, absolutely.

Since `is_package_installed` is very sage (the distribution) specific, it causes trouble for package managers which would like to refer to check whether a package is available on the local system instead of whether it has been installed with `sage -i` (or similar.)
This replaces all occurrences of `is_package_installed` (which are not part of sage the distribution) with a "feature" check which is performed much in the spirit of autoconf: check for the presence of the features needed, not for version numbers.
These checks are certainly not perfect yet and will need to evolve over time.

Indeed. The current build system assumes that if the package is installed it is because I explicitly want it in sage. It is a long standing convention which from where I sit on the outside is called automagic detection. The reality is that it belongs to configuration space (with availability checking - autoconf style). Sure it is possibly more risky to use an outside package but if it satisfy the availability checking, why not?

After all, at least some of us want to push sage down that way. 

Also note that for executables `Features` only cares about availability in the path, from sage or not (as it should as far as I am concerned). So not caring whether it is from sage or not is in spirit. 

I'll admit to have a bias since I want most of `sage/misc/package.py` to be gone with a top priority on `is_package_installed` in particular.

What I wanted to say: you should remove the check for libraries from the `OptionalModule` features.

I don't understand. I meant to write this so it works for a sage that has not been installed through sage-the-distribution. So, for the module to work, I have to check that it has been compiled and that the library it uses actually works. For sage-the-distribution the second part is redundant for other distributions it may not be.

No, you don't need to check anything. The module is linked against the library. If the library didn't work, the module probably wouldn't even compile and it certainly wouldn't be importable. If you can import the module, then surely the library works.

What should we do about this issue? I had put a lot of work into this and I would like to get this merged.

Jeroen: Would you agree to merge this as is now (after fixing patchbot errors)? Or can I expect a patch anytime soon?

I've in the meantime started moving in a different direction for build-time feature dependency checks, so to me at least my earlier questions about using this for that purpose are moot.  But I'm still +1 on having it for runtime feature checks.

It looks like the dependencies that you listed will be in the next beta - which could turn out to be a rc at this stage. Are there any more tickets that need to go in prior to this one in your opinion?
