The `error_msg` function creates nice error messages of the form

```
************************************************************************
Error applying patches
************************************************************************
Please email sage-devel (http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel)
explaining the problem and including the log file
  /usr/local/src/sage-config/logs/pkgs/pari-2.9.1.p2.log
Describe your computer, operating system, etc.
************************************************************************

We should use this for a lot more errors in `sage-spkg`.

This is especially important to have this working correctly:

```
The following package(s) may have failed to build (not necessarily
during this run of 'make pari'):

* package: lrslib-062+autotools-2017-03-03
  log file: /usr/local/src/sage-config/logs/pkgs/lrslib-062+autotools-2017-03-03.log
  build directory: /usr/local/src/sage-config/local/var/tmp/sage/build/lrslib-062+autotools-2017-03-03

* package: pari-2.9.1.p2
  log file: /usr/local/src/sage-config/logs/pkgs/pari-2.9.1.p2.log
  build directory: /usr/local/src/sage-config/local/var/tmp/sage/build/pari-2.9.1.p2
```
