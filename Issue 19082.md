CC:  @behackl @cheuberg @nathanncohen

Add an iterator, which goes over pairs of (possible infinite) inputs along the diagonals like the [Cantor pairing function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing_function#Cantor_pairing_function).

This is factored out from #19048.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19319

Yeah, I also believed that it should be shorter.

Do you really need this Kantor enumeration, or perhaps you don't care for as long as the product of two infinite iterators works correctly?

If you don't care, I just gave it a try:


```
def product(A,B):
    B = iter(B)
    lb = []
    b_done = False
    for a in A:
        try:
            if not b_done:
                lb.append(B.next())
        except StopIteration:
            b_done = True
        for b in lb:
            yield (a,b)
```


Does the job.

In #19048 it does not really (except from aesthetic aspects) matter (but it has to deal with the finite case as well and it would be nice if then all pairs would occur). But I use the same code in some other Sage projects as well (not public (yet)), where it matters: There I need an order my the sums of the indices, which is Cantor.
Thus having this tool in SageMath would be great.

You got me wrong: I did not ask you to remove the seealso block. I proposed to have a

```
SEEALSO::

with a link of course.

Linking n functions to each other requires n*(n-1) different links. If a function is moved, if a function is added, that requires much more work. Additionally, it possible that somebody *adding* a function may forget to update the others, which will not happen if we have an index of function at the head of the module.

Short answer: iterating over pairs is what we need right now.

Iteration over the product of n iterators will, as far as I can see, always need some recursive algorithm. I do not know whether avoiding iterators internally would make that much of a difference with respect of speed; IMHO it will not make it more readable.

What about replacing `product_cantor_pairing(A, B)` by `product_cantor_pairing([A, B])` and implementing products of `>= 3` iterators by a recursive call to `product_cantor_pairing` (and flattening the results) for the time being?

for infinite iterators, I suppose that things get somewhat trickier.

Well, I am not really eager for ordering triples anyway.

But I imagine that having 
`product_cantor_pairing([A, B, C])` returning the elements in the same order as
`product_cantor_pairing([product_cantor_pairing([A, B]), C])` (or the other way around, i.e., `product_cantor_pairing([A, product_cantor_pairing([B, C])])`) would make sense.

Good question. `itertools` used to output tuples. But sometimes you want to play with the result (like appending some more elements). For me it is fine either way.

Using lazy list you would also need to catch `IndexError` or so until we use the Cython API I would not go with it.

I will add a trivial commit for handling sharing of slices (very good idea!).
