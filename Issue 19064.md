CC:  vdelecroix dimpase dcoudert borassi

This branch improves the algorithm behind `Graph.complement()`, which currently calls `has_edge(u,v)` for every pair of points.

With this, the computation of the complement is done on a dense graph, as it should.

Yeah, me too. I have been giving a bad look to this `complement` function for a long time now, as it was clearly wasteful. Incidentally, this will "produce" many graphs with a 'dense' backend, while they are mostly non-existent in Sage nowadays. Perhaps new bugs related to this backend will pop out, or none if we are lucky.

> However, there is a small issue:

Arg, right. There were *two* checks for multiple edges in the same function, so I removed one but the error message changed. Will be fixed in a second.

Why don't you use `check_allocarray` or `MemoryAllocator`?

Because those pointers are sometimes reallocated (function 'resize'), and the two would not mix well.
