CC:  @antonio-rojas @kiwifb @timokau @jhpalmieri

Adds an 'optional' tag called 'build' (name to be bikeshedded if necessary) specifically for tests related to sage-the-distribution and Sage's build system.

This allows downstream distributions that package Sage differently to skip these tests, but they are enabled by default when the tests are run from a build in Sage's source repository.

This provides a possible solution to #27621.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27635

Similarly I have `is_package_installed` returning `False` in sage-on-gentoo so as not to remove it everywhere. That used to be a big patch. I only remove it from code where Gentoo can offer a replacement.

Yes at runtime definitely.

At configure time it is still used for optional bindings that have code. At the moment I replace it by querying environment variables in `sage_setup/optional_extension.py`. If it could be replaced by a `setup.cfg` that could be generated by `configure` - or the package building system - that would be great. On the other hand that would mean people couldn't just do a `sage -i ....` followed by `sage -b` to rebuild for the package they have just added.

Lastly the doctesting system relies on `is_package_installed` to figure some of the options you have enabled when passed `--optional=all`. I just cannot think of how to replace that.

"selfhosted" but I recon it is not as intuitive as "build". On the other hand

```
+        sage: (out, err, ret) = test_executable(["sage", "--root"])  # optional - build
+        sage: len(out) >= 2   # at least one character + newline; optional - build
```

is not exactly related to the build system. It happens to not necessarily be defined on sage-on-distro.
