CC:  @egourgoulhon @tscrim @mjungmath

`sage.tensor.modules` has a feature `start_index`. By setting `start_index=1` (default: 0), a basis is indexed starting at 1.

We add this feature to `TrivialFamily` (and the factory `Family`).

This is another small step to improve compatibility with `CombinatorialFreeModule`.
