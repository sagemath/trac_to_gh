# Issue 30022: TrivialFamily: Accept start index

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30259

`sage.tensor.modules` has a feature `start_index`. By setting `start_index=1` (default: 0), a basis is indexed starting at 1.

We add this feature to `TrivialFamily` (and the factory `Family`).

This is another small step to improve compatibility with `CombinatorialFreeModule`.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

I am confused. Is this a wontfix or a regular review?

wontfix

But #30300 is unrelated to this ticket and the feature request.

I thought I would implement #30300 by going through this ticket here.
But it turned out not to be useful.

I see. Do you think this might still be a useful feature for some to have?
