When `algorithm='MILP'`, we must be able to select the LP solver. This is not the case yet.

No need to add specific extra tests since the `solver` parameter is tested in method `vertex_coloring`.

Nitpick, but you can just use

```diff
-:meth:`solve <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>`
+:meth:`~sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve`
-:class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`
+:class:`~sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram`
```

Otherwise LGTM. You can set a positive review once fixed or if you want to just ignore.

A sidenote: Should we test for a combination of `solver != None` and `algorithm != 'MILP'`? At least it is not important, so don't bother with it on this ticket.

I changed the links. However, I don't want to test the combination algorithm / solver. It's not done elsewhere (in general) and we can ignore the solver if we use another algorithm.
