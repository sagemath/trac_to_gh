Code in `build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-configure.m4`, last modified in #30128, tries to use the `configure`-generated file `src/bin/sage-env-config` as part of the `SAGE_BROKEN_GCC` test.

As observed in #30845, this fails on builds from a distclean source tree into a `SAGE_LOCAL` that has an installed `g++`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31097

I think the fix could be to just take out the `source sage-env-config`.  In this particular case (`gcc`, `g++` installed in `$SAGE_LOCAL`), the variables `CONFIGURED_CC` etc. are not actually used; and other recent changes to `sage-env` should make it run OK without the `sage-env-config`.

Thanks! That worked. However, now I get:

```
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG gcc...
checking for C compiler vendor... gnu
checking whether /usr/share/miniconda/envs/sage-build/bin/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu-c++ supports C++11 features with -std=gnu++11... yes
checking for /usr/share/miniconda/envs/sage-build/bin/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu-cc option to accept ISO C99... none needed

checking for the location of crti.o... /usr/share/miniconda/envs/sage-build/bin/../x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/sysroot/usr/lib/../lib

```

so detection is not yet working.
