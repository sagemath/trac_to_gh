There's some old code for Cygwin-compatibility in `sage.misc.cython` that is not needed (we don't need to use gslblas for Cygwin), and that has been broken for a long time, causing an exception when importing that module.

I've had a fix for this in my Cygwin branch for ages but never made a ticket for it somehow.
