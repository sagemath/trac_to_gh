On top f Python 3 and 8.9.beta9, this :

* passes `ptestalllong` with no permanent failure and no transient failure not already reported for this version on Python3

* (sort-of) passes its own test suite (expected failures for Latin1 encoding and Internet access (idiosyncratic patch whose removal was refused...)).

==> `needs_review`.
