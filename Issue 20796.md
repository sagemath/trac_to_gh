There are now several packages where `build/pkgs/PACKAGE/type` is "pip".

Is there any documentation on this?

Some related tickets: 
- #20218: Use pip to install Python dependencies
- #19213: For packages listed in build/pkgs/piprules, allow 'sage --optional' to list them
- #19680: Add mock, pytest, tox, virtualenv optional packages

I don't know if everybody agrees to "officially" support the `pip` type packages. It was mainly meant as stopgap for some disappearing old-style packages.

Certainly not standard since we need to ship the sources of standard packages with Sage. They aren't really optional nor experimental either. I see it as just a shortcut to `./sage --pip install PKG`.

The pip-type package could be enhanced to use a mirrored tarball if there is one, then we could also use it for standard packages. Though really the benefit seems pretty small compared to putting `pip install` in the `spkg-install`.

"Official" or not, documentation is better than no documentation, no?

 Description modified
 
Let me ask again my question which you removed from the description above:

I tried to add a package of this type for pypolymake (for #20892), but adding the file build/pkgs/pypolymake/type does not seem to enable "sage -i pypolymake". What am I missing?
