Aha.  Maybe I took the top of page 9 of the posted PDF of _Sage
Programming Guide_ too literally:

"Using sage_search from the Sage prompt or grep one can easily find

This has been fixed in #3905.  If that patch gets a positive review and is incorporated into Sage, we should close this ticket, too.
