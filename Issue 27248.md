This resolves the issue reported at https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/w6Os2s6_eGk/SyFxT7cJBgAJ that the primecount SPKG will try to install libraries to lib64 on some platforms.

I sort-of confirmed this negatively by modifying `sdh_make` to set `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib64` which caused it to fail.  Setting it back to "lib" works, so I'm assuming that explicitly setting `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` should work in general.

Did you look at other cmake-dependent packages?

```
$ grep cmake build/pkgs/*/de*
build/pkgs/cryptominisat/dependencies:$(PYTHON) m4ri zlib libpng | cmake sqlite boost_cropped
build/pkgs/primecount/dependencies:cmake
build/pkgs/qhull/dependencies:| cmake
build/pkgs/scipoptsuite/dependencies:$(MP_LIBRARY) bliss readline | cmake
```
