Apparently already fixed by Paul Scurek in #15013. The file now has 52 doctests which all pass. The patch below is just to make it visible in the reference manual.

As I recall when doing #15768, there were some sphinx errors with this file. So IMO we should close this as a duplicate and just review #15768.
