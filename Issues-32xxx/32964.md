I was getting occasional timeouts on i686 on this file. See https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/34030#issuecomment-976455781.

I will add your patch to my (WIP) sagemath package for void, thanks.

I'm also planning to raise the default (non `--long`) timeout in #32973, until `make ptest` passes on my desktop. It would be better to speed things up, but this is a lot easier.
