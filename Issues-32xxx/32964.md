File "src/sage/functions/orthogonal_polys.py", line 2084, in sage.functions.orthogonal_polys.Func_ultraspherical
Warning, slow doctest:
    for N in range(100):
        n = ZZ.random_element(5, 5001)
        a = QQ.random_element().abs() + 5
        assert ((n+1)*ultraspherical(n+1,a,x) - 2*x*(n+a)*ultraspherical(n,a,x) + (n+2*a-1)*ultraspherical(n-1,a,x)).expand().is_zero()
Test ran for 261.17 s
    [400 tests, 273.87 s]
```

Since the test is randomized, we don't need to repeat it a hundred times. Coverage is provided more by the number of testers. And we shouldn't use `assert()` in EXAMPLES...

I was getting occasional timeouts on i686 on this file. See https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/34030#issuecomment-976455781.

I will add your patch to my (WIP) sagemath package for void, thanks.

I'm also planning to raise the default (non `--long`) timeout in #32973, until `make ptest` passes on my desktop. It would be better to speed things up, but this is a lot easier.
