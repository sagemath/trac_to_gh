In extension of `SymbolicSubring`, we introduce rings of symbolic expressions with a fixed set of symbolic assumptions. Arithmetic within such a ring is allowed to use the assumptions for simplification. Coercions are allowed to rings with more assumptions.

I like that idea. Do you think this could replace the usage of assumptions on the symbolic ring long-term? Setting assumptions on a global scale is imho not optimal.
