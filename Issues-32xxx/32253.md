Prompted by me replicating https://groups.google.com/g/sage-support/c/2ufrP1M4mRs/m/bpMfD-oKBwAJ 

If the optional csdp package is not installed, the following error message is shown.

```
FeatureNotPresentError: CSDP is not available.
Executable 'theta' not found on PATH.
No equivalent system packages for debian are known to Sage.
To install CSDP using the Sage package manager, you can try to run:
  !sage -i csdp
No equivalent system packages for pip are known to Sage.
Further installation instructions might be available at http://github.org/dimpase/csdp.
```

However, http://github.org/dimpase/csdp doesn't exist. Perhaps it is appropriate to replace this with https://github.com/dimpase/csdp ? I note that the last commit there was 6 years ago, and I think the instructions there are perhaps not what I would call "further installation instructions" now.

Note that #32244 also concerns csdp.
