- 19074 was merged in https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases/tag/v1.21.0rc1
- 19365 was merged in https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases/tag/v1.21.1 

So the upgrade to #32488 makes these patches obsolete. 

The question whether this change:

```
--- a/build/pkgs/numpy/spkg-install.in
+++ b/build/pkgs/numpy/spkg-install.in
@@ -22,10 +22,6 @@ python3 ../lapack_conf.py

-
 export NUMPY_FCONFIG="config_fc --noopt --noarch"
 if [ "$SAGE_FAT_BINARY" = "yes" ]; then
     export NUMPY_FCONFIG="--cpu-baseline=NONE"
```
should be done can be reopened after #32488, #32434, #32424 have been resolved.
