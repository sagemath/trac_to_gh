- 19074 was merged in https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases/tag/v1.21.0rc1
- 19365 was merged in https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases/tag/v1.21.1 

So the upgrade to #32488 makes these patches obsolete. 

The question whether this change:

```

should be done can be reopened after #32488, #32434, #32424 have been resolved.
