After #32492, we may get 

```
[sage_conf-9.5.beta2] sage-conf is already installed with the same version as the provided wheel. Use --force-reinstall to force an installation of the wheel.
```
Because of this behavior of pip, some configuration changes made in `configure` will not be updated in an incremental build. Likewise for other Python packages when we add a patch, or for `sage-setup` when we edit files there (as happened in #32607).

However, as discussed in https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8711, the `pip install` option `--force-reinstall` does too much -- it also reinstalls all dependencies, which we definitely do not want.

Instead, we just use `pip uninstall` before `pip install`.

We also add some dependencies on source files to `sage_setup`. This is also for #32607.
