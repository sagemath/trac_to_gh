As noted in comment 44 on trac ticket #31996, the output to `S.riemann_matrix()` where `S` is a `RiemannSurface` object is different depending if the calculation is run on Ubuntu or Mac OSX, differening by a value on the order of the machine precision of the complex field being used for the calculation. The reason for this should be discovered, and appropriate doctests added to check this. This doctest will likely take the form of testing the output against a known Riemann matrix, e.g. for the curve given by `y<sup>2-x</sup>3+1=0`, which has Riemann matrix (-1+I*sqrt(3))/2.
