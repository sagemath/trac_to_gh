We install a modern gcc, but without modern binutils we get a lot of errors like this:

```
  [nauty-27r1.p1]   /tmp/cch93yUy.s:4216: Error: no such instruction: `vmovdqu8 (%rbx),%xmm3'
  [nauty-27r1.p1]   /tmp/cch93yUy.s:4218: Error: no such instruction: `vmovdqu8 %xmm3,(%rcx)'
  [nauty-27r1.p1]   /tmp/cch93yUy.s:4220: Error: no such instruction: `vmovdqu8 -16(%rbx,%rax),%xmm4'
```
(https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/3151314694?check_suite_focus=true)

So in this ticket we drop these configurations (added in #31526) from the CI.

(`debian-jessie-gcc_spkg` and `centos-7-gcc_spkg` do not appear to be affected by this problem.)

We also restore the configuration `centos-7-i386-gcc_spkg`, which had been dropped by an editing mistake in #31526.
