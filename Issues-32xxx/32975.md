This ticket improves a few things about how doctest treats pytest.

- Introduce the option to specify in function doc `TESTS: pytest`. This marks the function as tested for the `sage-coverage` command. Sometimes (but rarely) you have private or protected methods that don't need a proper "EXAMPLES" doctest. In these cases, one can decide to either write traditional `TESTS` or use pytest to test the method. In the later case, `sage-coverage` would mark the function as not tested as it's not aware of pytest; so we have to specify explicitly that we use pytest to cover this method. One could even argue that private/protected methods shouldn't be directly tested at all as they are implementation details; but let's not open this discussion.

- Remove `_test.py` files from doctest coverage. By our convention, these are pytest files and thus almost never have (extensive) doctests.

- To make this work, existing `xyz_test.py` files that are not using pytest are renamed to `test_xyz.py`.

Normally we would have deprecation for such renames, but I think we won't need it here because these modules are only there for testing purposes and will likely not be used in user code
