```

In this ticket, we add version constraints for the build-time and run-time dependencies on `sage_conf`, and clean up the sdist of `sage_conf`, in particular so that it no longer ship configuration artifacts from the machine where the sdist was built.

<a id='comment:8'></a>Looking at the 9.4.post3 tarball, yes, this sdist is not clean.
These files (all artifacts generated by `configure`) should not be included:
- `sage_root/src/bin/sage-env-config`
- `sage_root/src/bin/sage-src-env-config`
- `sage_root/build/bin/sage-build-env-config`
- `sage_root/build/make/Makefile-auto`
- `sage_root/pkgs/sage-conf/sage_conf.py`
- `sage_root/pkgs/sage-conf/bin/sage-env-config`
Also `sage_root/src/bin` has a bunch of other scripts that don't belong there.

Some of this would just go away by running the sdist building in a clean environment (#32062 does this on GH Actions).

But it's best to fix it using `MANIFEST.in`.

Let's use the present ticket to address this.

Actually one can, at least in some use cases, by using `--no-index --find-links ...`.
See for example `pkgs/sagemath-standard/tox.ini`. 

> This makes it hard to use sage_conf as a build_requires dependency, since it will be usually fetched from pypi and thus doesn't take the users config into account.


Actually the version of **sage-conf** on PyPI comes from `pkgs/sage-conf_pypi` (from #29039) and runs the `configure` script upon installation.

I thought so too but it turns out that `pip` specifies `--ignore-installed` when constructing the isolated build environment, see https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6482.
Thus it will most likely fetch pypi, or if you are lucky use the a locally cached wheel. So that doesn't seem to work.

The version constraint makes sense in either case in my opinion.

If you use `--no-index`, it will not fetch the version from PyPI. 

If you combine it with `--find-links=SAGE_VENV/var/lib/sage/wheels`, then it will take the prebuilt `sage_conf` wheel from there, both for build and for install.

As I said above, pip specifies `ignore-installed` while constructing the build environment and thus will build sage-conf twice.
Please convince yourself if you don't believe me:
https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/main/src/pip/_internal/build_env.py#L221

This is discussed in many issues on the pip repo, some examples:
https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6482
https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9542
https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9439
All of these issues deal with (different) problems that come from taking "build isolation" as literally as pip is doing. The two major issues being that build and runtime dependencies are downloaded and build twice, and that there is no guarantee that build and runtime dependencies use the same version.
It also seems that this is not something that will be fixed relatively soon.

In particular, the following will definitely build sage-conf twice, especially with the changes in this ticket:

```
pip install sage-conf==9.5
pip install sagemath==9.6
```
That may look like a silly example and no user would probably run this directly, but such a situation may happen quickly if you use packages that specify different but compatible versions of sagemath; or if you e.g. build sage-conf yourself locally; or if you upgrade sagemath later (which would trigger another installation of sage-conf).
Also note that sagemath 9.6 will probably work well with sage-conf 9.5 since the latter is after installation nothing more than a glorified configuration file and thus rarely changes (once the changes to the build system due to the modularization settle down).


Your suggestion to use `no-index` or `find-links` works for development, but not for end-user that want to use the sagemath package from pypi. 

The options I see are:
- Accept that sage doesn't work with build isolation (which would be unfortunate)
- Split `sage-conf` into build and runtime configuration. There is still an overlap (and thus duplication) but at built time sage needs less dependencies than at runtime. In addition, maybe directly incorporate the build-time sage-conf in the sagemath package.
- Merge sage-conf in sagemath (I guess there was a reason to split it out in the first place; which?)
- Explore different options to pass the built-time configuration to sagemath, e.g. using a script that sets the correct env variables or writes an `env` file; use `package-config` as described in [PEP 517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/#config-settings) to set the configuration or point to a config file.

It reuses `SAGE_LOCAL`, which resides in a subdirectory of `~/.sage`, so it does NOT build the distribution twice.

So you mean that sage-conf would be installed twice, but the second installation is considerably quicker since most of the built output is 'cached' in SAGE_LOCAL?

That's nice and probably takes care of the issue for end-user. For development, the workarounds of not using build isolation or no-index/find-files are working.

The ticket generally looks good to me, especially with the narrowed focus.
Two questions:
> sage-conf ~= 9.5.b6


shouldn't this be `==` to reduce the potential for issues in the future? Once a bit of experience is collected one may play around and see if less strict constraints are sufficient?

What's the purpose of the added symlinks?
