Dima's original ticket description:

This is a followup to #32060. Building gcc from source is very hard, and unnecessary for any platform Sage supports now. 

Same applies to gfortran, with macOS being an exception - there is no (g)fortran coming from the system.

So we need such an easy to install replacement, e.g. one provided by Conda, Homebrew, MacPorts, etc.

Should the need arise for something more isolated, (hopefully not), there are experimental standalone distributions of gfortran for macOS, by the gfortran maintainer of the Homebrew package. This offers a way to entirety remove gcc and gfortran spkgs from Sage. 

​https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS - specifically, 
https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/releases/tag/11.2-bigsur-intel
provides a signed and notarized installed of gcc 11.1 to `/usr/local` (I tested it, it works)

Other Fortran possibilities are various closed source offers, e.g. from Intel and NAG,
as well as open-source flang, etc.

how come removing gcc spkg does not create such an obstacle, whereas it does for gfortran?

Besides, if you need to build gcc in order to build gfortran, the latter cannot be counted as unproblematic.

Python dev environments have a gcc. If they don't, we can't help them anyway.

Python dev environments don't have gfortran. gfortran is not pip-installable. The few Python packages that use gfortran have high-quality deployments of wheels to PyPI, which are widely used. 

Sage does not (yet?) have a working strategy that would enable us to use wheels from PyPI. The first step to pip-installability in #29039 builds everything from source.

gcc is not pip-installable, either. The only scenario where developers have no Fortran, but "gcc" (for some value of "gcc", e.g. Apple clang) is on macOS, as far as I know.
On macOS they'd have to help themselves by installing (g, or some other)fortran in some way.

Needless to say, we should test that this is feasible without using !Homebrew/Conda/macports,
say with the gfortran installer linked in the ticket description.

OK, and this setting will need a Fortran compiler in addition to a C/C++ compiler.
Why is it an extra obstacle? It's an improvement, as it makes building a lot quicker.

on gcc-4-based platforms we build gcc+gfortran, no?
(well, I am not worried about this obsolete case)

Please... I just explained it. 

"Python dev environments have a gcc". Why? Because lots of Python packages need a working C/C++ compiler.

I explained why the gfortran situation is different.

It's not different, as Fortran compilers are easy to come by these days.

The philosophy of this ticket is that we should cut our losses we had while trying to vendor everything imaginable, spending human resources on thankless tasks such as vendoring gcc/gfortran,
something that 99.9% of Sage users don't care about.

No Python project I know vendors compilers. Lack  of developer time is very real problem, and you keep perpetuating this problem

Our experimental packages are a mess in general, so our `gcc` package would fit right in, the more bitrot the better. I also don't object to removing it altogether — I don't really care one way or the other. But I think we should keep `gfortran` since it builds on a range of platforms and serves a purpose, at least on OS X.

removing gcc package, while retaining gfortran package, would be a step in right direction. Would we like to proceed with this? 

It'd certainly simplify the convoluted build logic of potentially having two C compilers around, and lead to less reports of build failures.

I think by definition we only support distributions that provide a suitable gcc.

But keeping `gcc` costs us nothing, given that its build script is shared with `gfortran` and we promise nothing about it other than providing it as a last resort for users as described https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/ReleaseTours/sage-9.8#SupportforGCC8droppedC17featuresnowavailable.
