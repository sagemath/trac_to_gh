I have three doctest errors:

I thought it is not important to make the `valid_from` a keyword argument in `AsymptoticExpansion.B`, since it is already a keyword argument in `AsymptoticRing.B`. I changed it now, because I think it is more correct to have it this way.

<a id='comment:13'></a>> since it is already a keyword argument in `AsymptoticRing.B`


I see. I think it makes sense to make sure the type of arguments are consistent across the methods.


5. `sage: (2*x).B({x: 20}) # indirect doctest` -- this is actually not indirect, there you do use `AsymptoticExpansion.B`.

6. "If you pass only a number as `valid_from`": I suggest to rephrase this as "If a number is passed to `valid_from`, ...".

7. (2., continued): The docstring of `BTerm` should also be changed accordingly.
