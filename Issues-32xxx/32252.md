Here is an example illustrating the problem. We compute the tilings of a 2x2 square using vertical (blue) and horizontal dominos (red).

```
v = Polyomino([(0, 0), (0, 1)], color="blue")
h = Polyomino([(0, 0), (1, 0)], color="red")
T = TilingSolver(pieces=[v, h], box=(2, 2), rotation=False, reflection=False, reusable=True)
for soln in T.solve():
    show(sum([p.show2d() for p in soln]))
```

We should get two tilings, one with only red dominos and one with blue dominos, but instead both tilings use red dominos.

The problem is in the method `T.row_to_polyomino`, which miscalculates the colour (the default value is -1 and so the colour of the last piece is always used).
