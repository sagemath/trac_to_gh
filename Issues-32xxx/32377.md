I just want to point out there already is a hook for modifying the map the indices of the Lie algebra basis to the UEA algebra generators:

```python
def _UEA_names_map(self, t):
    UEA = self._construct_UEA()
    LRT = UEA.basis().keys()
    return LRT([x], ROOT)
```
Although this will likely be slower than your implementation, so I would go with your version. I think it would be better to make it a proper bound method on the element:

```python
class Element(CombinatorialFreeModule.Element):
    def lift(self):
        UEA = self.parent()._construct_UEA()
        LRT = UEA.basis().keys()
        data = {LRT([x], ROOT): cf
                for x, cf in self.monomial_coefficients().items()}
        return UEA.element_class(UEA, data)
```
Otherwise everything looks good.
