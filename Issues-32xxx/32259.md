Since one can pass a list of equations and a list of variables to solve for to `solve`, the following should work but doesn't.

```
sage: solve([x], [x], solution_dict=True)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression' object is not iterable
```

Note that if we have two copies of the same equation, then it works:

```
sage: solve([x, x], [x], solution_dict=True)
[{x : 0}]
```

The related ticket #32256 points out that if we specify `algorithm="sympy"` instead of using the default (maxima), then we don't get a solution dict:

```
sage: solve([x], [x], solution_dict=True, algorithm="sympy")
[x == 0]
```

This ticket along with #32255 and #32256 point out some errors and inconsistencies with `solve` that seem related, so it might be advantageous to deal with these issues all at once.
