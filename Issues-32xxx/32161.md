Let's try to differentiate the symbolic sum of function of two variables.

```
sage: x,y = var("x,y")
sage: a,b = var("a,b")
sage: F = function("F")(x, y)
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_sum
sage: s = symbolic_sum(F(x, y), x, a, b)
sage: s.diff(y)
diff(F(x, y), y)*D[0](sum)(F(x, y), x, a, b)
```


But expected something like


```
sum((diff(F(x, y), y), x, a, b)
```


or

```

sum(D[1](F(x, y)), x, a, b)
```

Attachment [bug Derivative of the symbolic sum of function of two variables.2.ipynb](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket32161/bug Derivative of the symbolic sum of function of two variables.2.ipynb) by @nbruin created at 2021-07-21 16:07:36

Confirming the bug reported here:

```
sage: var("x,a,b")
(x, a, b)
sage: S=sum(f(x),x,a,b)
sage: S
sum(f(x), x, a, b)
sage: S.diff(x)
diff(f(x), x)*D[0](sum)(f(x), x, a, b) + D[1](sum)(f(x), x, a, b)
```
Clearly, sage has no knowledge on how to differentiate sums (it just considers the sum as an unknown function in four variables). The first step would be to throw an error, because things like 'sum(f(x+y),x,a,b+y).diff(y)' can probably not be handled.

In most cases, the most useful answer would probably be to differentiate term-wise (provided the differentiating variable does not occur in the bounds), which would be the correct answer for formal sums and absolutely convergent ones.

My investigation of this issue shown that giac, maxima and sympy solve this example in true way.

Let's try giac:

```

Sum(Derivative(F(x, y), y), (x, a, b))
```

and an least maxima:


```
sage: s = maxima('sum(F(x,y),x,a,b)')

'sum(F(x,y),x,a,b)
sage: s.diff('y')                                                                                                                                                                
'sum('diff(F(x,y),y,1),x,a,b)
sage: s.diff('y').sage()                                                                                                                                                         
sum(diff(F(x, y), y), x, a, b)
```

All OK, but just

```
s.sage().diff(var('y'))                                                                                                                                                    
diff(F(x, y), y)*D[0](sum)(F(x, y), x, a, b)
```

gives wrong answer.

I have understood what part of sage code gives this wrong result. This is function `def dummy_diff(*args): ` from `src/sage/calculus/calculus.py` which is called from

```
def symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string(x, equals_sub=False, maxima=maxima):
```
Considering that 

```
def symbolic_sum(expression, v, a, b, algorithm='maxima', hold=False):
    if algorithm == 'maxima':
        return maxima.sr_sum(expression,v,a,b)
```

```

Inside `dummy_diff(*args)` type of `f` is just `type(f) = <class 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>` and may be you are right that sage thinks that 'sr_sum' an unknown function in four variables.

You may have found which code in sage is involved in producing the wrong answer, but that code is not "at fault". It's just that it doesn't know how to differentiate sums, because it hasn't been told how to.

If one defines:

```
def sum_deriv(self,*args,**kwds):
    return self(*[[args[0].diff(kwds['diff_param'])]+list(args[1:])])
mysum=function('mysum',nargs=4,tderivative_func=sum_deriv)
```
one can just do:

```
sage: var('x,y,a,b')
(x, y, a, b)
sage: function('f')
f
sage: mysum(f(x,y),x,a,b).diff(y)
mysum(diff(f(x, y), y), x, a, b)
```
This approach is a little simple minded, of course (apart from the mathematical problem that term-wise differentiation is not always justified): it would need to check that the differentiation variable is indeed independent of the summation. With the current code, we get nonsense such as:

```
sage: mysum(f(x,y),x,a,b).diff(x)
mysum(diff(f(x, y), x), x, a, b)
sage: mysum(f(x,y),x,a,b).diff(a)
mysum(0, x, a, b)
```
However, it does show which hook on `sage.functions.other.Function_sum'` would need to be populated.

What does your code presently do with `sum(f(x,b),x,a,b).diff(b)`? It should probably check that the differentiation variable is independent from the bounds as well and perhaps throw an error if it's not.

I'm also not so sure that 0 is the best answer if a derivative with respect to the summation variable is requested. Sure, it's not a free variable, so an external reference to it can be interpreted as a "different" variable, but it' more likely a typo.

```

The problem is that with this test

```
            sage: s.diff(a)
            diff(sum(f, x, a, b), a)
            sage: s.diff(b)
            diff(sum(f, x, a, b), b)
```

I have received exception caused by infinitly recursive call-stack.

Yes, I guess the hold isn't strong enough here. You'll probably have to construct the derivative from lower-level primitives (basically, have a hold on the "derivative")

The problem is that in the current lingo, `diff(sum(f, x, a, b), a)` should basically return `(D[2]sum)(f,x,a,b)`. The operator in question is easily constructed by
`sage.symbolic.operators.FDerivativeOperator(sage.functions.other.symbolic_sum,[2])`, but I think as soon as it's evaluated at `(f,x,a,b)` it will try to expand the operator again, leading to an infinite recursion. I don't know if we have precedent of this: functions that do have some rules for expanding their derivatives, but still need inert forms to linger too. It would be worth asking sage symbolic computation experts (particularly the pynac crowd?) what means we have to support this.

For now I'd say raising an error would be fine; I don't think anything useful would be possible with a derivative with respect to a summation bound.

Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.

This issue came up again in:

https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/Ksil-Qg9SlM/m/ZWUwKxdVAAAJ

perhaps merging a more modest solution first that just addresses the simple cases is worthwhile?

Ahem...

I'm not sure that "derive a sum with respect to (one of) is bounds" has any meaning... `set` is a //dscrete// operation  ; the summation variable takes **integer** values only. Forgetting this for a moment, try plotting `points([(u, sum(x, x, 0, u)) for u in (0, 1/3..4)])` to convince yourselves. You can even `plot(lambda u:sum(x, x, 0, u), (0, 4))`...

In other words, `sum(x, x, a, b) == -1/2*a^2 + 1/2*b^2 + 1/2*a + 1/2*b` holds **if and only if** `a` and `b` are **integers**. Differentiating the right-hand side of this equality wrt `a` and `b` has a meaning ; differentiating the left hand has **not**.

The fact that the closed expression `-1/2*a^2 + 1/2*b^2 + 1/2*a + 1/2*b`does not convey this condition is a design insufficiency of Sage (and Giac, Sympy and Mathematica ; Fricas (Axiom) may be a horse of an entirely different color...)

In consequence, we can check if the differentiation variable occurs in the expression of bounds, and safely raise some "Nonsense exception" (to be carefully choosen...) if so.

HTH,

I don't think many interesting things will be done with it but something like
`F(x)=sum((x+k)^2,k,0,floor(sqrt(x))`
makes perfect sense, and `F(x)` is a piecewise differentiable function. So I think the restraint the people considering the implementation here have shown discarding differentiation with respect to variables that occur in the bounds is somewhat warranted.

I also think we've seen it gets pretty hairy quickly, so for the sake of at least being able to deal with more straightforward cases (and avoiding the outright wrong results we're getting now!) we SHOULD probably just cast an error if the summation variable or any of the bounds contain the differentiation variable.
