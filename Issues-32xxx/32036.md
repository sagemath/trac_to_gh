There are a few remaining uses of `SAGE_SHARE` in `src/sage` that will have to be eliminated though.

That would be timely if we could.

Other issue about `sage_setup/setenv.py` I tried to replace `if SAGE_LOCAL:` by `if SAGE_ROOT:` since it is set to `None` for me in distro. But I still got the linking noise which means that it still accepted that as a positive. So a better test may be needed.

LiE is an optional package. So, it won't break unless you try to use it. Upstream is actually not installing stuff properly, we shouldn't be looking up info files under `lib` of any kind.

Using feature is certainly possible and it should start with detecting the executable. The rest is to consult the doc from inside sage and it really should be at the distribution's discretion because it is arbitrary and not something the program itself knows anything about.

I think I'm missing something here, when was `sage_conf` made mandatory even for distro installs? The description says "This default is no longer necessary because sage_conf is now a requirement" but to me it looks the other way around: `sage_conf` is required because this ticket purposely breaks setups without it.

Thanks. Unfortunately this doesn't help since the search patch is still defined in terms of `CONWAY_POLYNOMIALS_DATA_DIR` without a fallback.

I'm really strugging to understand the purpose of this change. Currently we have a long list of sane defaults in `env.py` which made everything work nicely out of the box. After this, if I understand correctly, are we expected to maintain a per-distro list of environment variables which essentially duplicates the list in `env.py`? This seems a big regression to me.

> Do you set `SAGE_LOCAL` in your distribution packaging?

No, I don't set any env variable at all. Before this change, it was set to `/usr` in `env.py` via `SAGE_LOCAL → SAGE_ENV → os.path.abspath(sys.prefix)`, which in turn made all other variables which depend on it point to the correct paths.

It is not in the main tree, but it has been in the science overlay for a while. However, if you want one that will definitely work, you'll have to go with my sage-on-gentoo overlay. I updated it yesterday when I found that tarball has changed location.

About `sage_conf`. I will want some small change to make it easier for distro, in a separate ticket of course, but my audience is here for now.

Currently `sage_conf` is a very customised python package in the sage tree that requires the top configure to be run for the variables to be setup to the proper values. Matthias encourage distro to write their own version of `sage_conf`. After giving it some thoughts, considering the way things works from source in Gentoo, writing a full blown python package that passes QA is too much of a hassle. This is not a place where we can just take a file and just install it in the right place(s) [OK, if you really insist we can abuse the system in such a way]. There are other issue like versioning that would need sorting. I don't want to maintain such a package. 

But I still want to use `sage_conf` as it means that I don't to have patch `env.py` anymore. So, I write a small `sage_conf.py` file with my stuff, I install it alongside `env.py` and I change the import to be from `sage.sage_conf` instead of just `sage_conf`. What I would like to happen is for that option to be available out of the box in sage. Try `sage_conf` first and if it isn't present, try `sage.sage_conf`. The file is maintained alongside sage which means I don't have to worry about versioning amongst other things.

I honestly don't think they should use my distro's `sage_conf`. At least not in the current state. But it is an interesting prospect.

In the current state, I certainly don't want to use a patched version of your stuff. It has to become a proper pypi package first. Passing it off would be the same as writing one myself. I decided that I should draw some lines in the sand as to what I should do.

I was able to install lie on Gentoo by doing

```
layman --add science
emerge --ask lie
```
Should we add

```
emerge --ask app-portage/layman
layman --add science
```
to whatever the current place for these per-system advice is (it was moved around...)

Using layman is so outdated - even I moved on (last month :) ). Seriously, it is deprecated.

```
emerge eselect-repository 
eselect repository enable science 
emaint sync -r science 
```
or `emerge --sync`, all the repos managed that way will get pulled by `emerge --sync` or equivalent like `eix-sync`.

That complaint of mine was about build time. We had the runtime issue forever, it is just the opportunity to squash it is gone again :(

But what I want to know and I'll dig is why setting `SAGE_LOCAL` to `None` is `sage_conf` doesn't work. That would be the ideal fix, while keeping it the way it is for Antonio.
