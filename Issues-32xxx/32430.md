The `EllipticCurveIsogeny.is_normalized()` method accepts two optional arguments, `via_formal` and `check_by_pullback`, that have been documented as deprecated since #7096 — for over 10 years! — albeit without printing a deprecation warning in the code itself. It might be about time to get rid of them.

The patch removes the obsolete code. According to the discussion below, no deprecation warning seems necessary.

Looks good, but maybe we can just get rid of them right now ?

@JohnCremona : John, your opinion ?

Otherwise, you need to doctest the deprecation...
