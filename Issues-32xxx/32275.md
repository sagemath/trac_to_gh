This example is supposed to test a function that can't be integrated, but giac 1.7 does actually integrate it (in terms of algebraic numbers), which defeats its purpose. Replace it with a function that giac 1.7 can't integrate.

This wasn't failing before #32002 because maxima partially integrates it, so the maxima answer was returned instead.

As a side note: sage can't parse the giac 1.7 answer for the old integral, but that's a different problem.
