ok, I see.

We could introduce an option `-o, --output` and try to handle multiple input files.

Or stay with the principle that this is to fix just one single file ?

I think it is fine to handle just one file, which I believe is documented. It is more if someone gives it bad input (and it realizes this) that it doesn't change any files. However, this isn't really a big deal. I think the current branch is fine, but I wanted to see if there was an easy fix to prevent this from happening.

```

I do not see how to distinguish between the incorrect use

```
sage --fixdoctests a.py b.py
```
where the intention is to fix both a.py and b.py inplace ; and the correct use

```
sage --fixdoctests a.py b.py
```
where the intention is to write a corrected copy of a.py in b.py.

In the second case, it could very well be that b.py is existing already, as in the first case.

I think one can reasonably keep the current behaviour, which is indeed documented.
