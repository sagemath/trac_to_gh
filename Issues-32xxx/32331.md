ok, I see.

We could introduce an option `-o, --output` and try to handle multiple input files.

Or stay with the principle that this is to fix just one single file ?

I do not see how to distinguish between the incorrect use

```
sage --fixdoctests a.py b.py
```
where the intention is to fix both a.py and b.py inplace ; and the correct use

```
sage --fixdoctests a.py b.py
```
where the intention is to write a corrected copy of a.py in b.py.

In the second case, it could very well be that b.py is existing already, as in the first case.

I think one can reasonably keep the current behaviour, which is indeed documented.
