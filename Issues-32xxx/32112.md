As noticed in [#31901 comment:28](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31901#comment:28), there is an issue when constructing two charts sharing the same coordinate symbols but not being otherwise related:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='topological')
sage: U = M.open_subset('U')
sage: V = M.open_subset('V')
sage: XU = U.chart('x y')
sage: XV = V.chart('x y')
sage: M.top_charts()
[Chart (U, (x, y))]
```
The chart `XV` should also appear as a top chart on `M`.

Could you explain why? I mean, why `_domain` should become a Cython attribute?
