This has now the refactored `TermWithCoefficient._product_repr_`.

I get two doctest failures. Something to do with `<BLANKLINE>`.

I'll investigate the doctest failures later. The refactor looks good to me in general!

I have a slight preference for keeping the old `TermWithCoefficient._repr_`.

vs.

```
Term with coefficient x

I think we should simply pass on all (keyword) arguments, i.e.

```
+        return self._product_repr_(**kwds)
```

Great! If you have a look at [what the patchbot reports](https://patchbot.sagemath.org/ticket/32153/), you can see that it complains about the coverage going down.

Please add a docstring and a simple doctest for `TermWithCoefficient._product_repr_`.

But that would mean that the header of `_repr_` needs to be something like `def _repr_(self, **kwds)` instead of the more explicit `def _repr_(self, latex=...)`. I don't think that is an actual improvement, can you elaborate?

Ideally, I would like to do

```
sage: class A(object):
....:     def sun(self):
....:         pass
....: class B(A):
....:     rain = sun
```
but this raises

```
NameError: name 'sun' is not defined
```
so I thought the next best thing is to pass on all arguments by `**kwds`. However, I agree that explicit might be better in this case, so keeping the method-definition and using

```
    return self._product_repr_(latex=latex)
```
seems to be a good compromise.

+1, passing the keyword argument `latex` explicitly is a good idea. I'm also happy with this. This means that there are three minor things to do here:

1. Rename `_product_repr_` to `_repr_product_`,
2. Add a short docstring with a doctest (you can use the same doctest as for `TermWithCoefficient._repr_`),
3. Change the call to the product representation in `ExactTerm._repr_` to `self._product_repr_(latex=latex)`.
