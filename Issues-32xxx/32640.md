We have in Sage 9.5.beta3:

```
sage: f = (1-x)^-x
sage: f.taylor(x, 0, 5)  # correct
3/4*x^5 + 5/6*x^4 + 1/2*x^3 + x^2 + 1
sage: f.series(x, 5)  # incorrect
1*x^(-1) + 1 + 1*x + 1*x^2 + 1*x^3 + 1*x^4 + Order(x^5)
```

That is mathematically incorrect, so the method can return wrong answers when the exponent's offset is nonzero.\n\nIn particular, the exponent `-x` is stored as `-1`, with an offset of `1`, which explains why sage gives the wrong answer for the example in the ticket description.

Thanks for the bug report.

The bug is in pynac's `power::useries` method. A power series is stored as a polynomial, together with an offset that represents multiplying by a certain power of `x`. Essentially, the method ignores the exponent's offset during most of the calculation, and then applies an offset to the final result. That is mathematically incorrect, so the method can return wrong answers when the exponent's offset is nonzero.

In particular, the exponent `-x` is stored as `-1`, with an offset of `1`, which explains why sage gives the wrong answer for the example in the ticket description. Specifically, sage's answer is `x^-1 * (1-x)^-1`.

I should be able to upload a patch to fix this soon.

To fix the problem, we `normalize` the power series before exponentiating. This multiplies by the appropriate power of `x` and sets the `offset` to `0`.
