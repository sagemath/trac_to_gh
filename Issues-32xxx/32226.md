```
Given the brittle build system of `cvxopt` (#31905, #32087), and of its dependency `suitesparse` (#30478), we should give users a recourse when the installation fails. 

`cvxopt` provides our only backend for `SemidefiniteProgram`, introduced over 5 years ago. Although not yet used anywhere in the Sage library, it provides important functionality for a number of Sage user, e.g.
it's used in https://github.com/bachirelkhadir/sdp_solvers_experiments which is needed for 
demonstration of https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/19M1287584 in
https://github.com/bachirelkhadir/Convex-Quaternary-Quartics-Are-Sum-of-Squares/blob/master/optimal_constant_generalized_cs_deg_8_a4.pdf

Hence, we keep `cvxopt` as a standard package, but make it disablable. 

Marking doctests that depend on `cvxopt` with `# optional - cvxopt` is also preparation for modularization.  Thanks to the dummy backend `MatrixSDPBackend`, the modeling side of the interface can still be doctested even if `cvxopt` is not installed.

We also deprecate the outdated and unused global function `linear_program`, which directly uses `cvxopt`.

I disagree. Most of Sage functionality is not used by sagelib, it's absolutely not a reason to remove it.
Besides, it's the only SDP backend we have at the moment.

A number of publications I have depend on this functionality, and perhaps more.

It's a tiny bit annoying to have to remember to `--disable-cvxopt` when I'm building a branch that doesn't use cvxopt (i.e. pretty much all of them), but I guess that's no different than most packages that disable some things but enable others by default.
