For a morphism of projective space there is an explicitly computable constant that bounds the difference between the height and canonical height (f.height_difference_bound()). This function is returning incorrect values. It looks like the code is trying to take into account scaling through by the resultant and ending up with an incorrect lower bound.

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
f=DynamicalSystem([5*x^2 + 3*x*y , y^2 + 3*x^2])
C=f.height_difference_bound()
for Q in P.points_of_bounded_height(bound=5):
    if (f(Q).global_height() - 2*Q.global_height()).abs() > C:
        print("bad:",Q)

I don't really see why this was trying to clear the denominators before computing the heights of the coefficients polys. I removed all that and am now getting the expected values.

I also noticed `prec` was missing on the heights of the coefficients, so I added that and used it in the new example to.

Lastly, I had a sorting issue in an unrelated doctest that I fixed.
