I propose to restructure the manifold module. For example:

- separate the code related to the (pseudo-)Riemannian setting and dedicate a own module to it
- create a new module for vector bundles

Some things are currently very vague:

- `operators.py` clearly contains code related to differentiable manifolds but stays in the main module
- we have a submodule `subsets` but the separation is currently not very consistent; `subset.py` for example still belongs to the main module

OK for this, provided there is some deprecation period (last time there were such changes, it broke codes relying on Sage sources, like the [kerrgeodesic_gw package](https://pypi.org/project/kerrgeodesic-gw/)).

Regarding `operators.py`, I agree with your remark; however, I would keep it in the main module for convenience of the end user, `from sage.manifolds.operators import curl` being shorter than `from sage.manifolds.differentiable.operators import curl`.
