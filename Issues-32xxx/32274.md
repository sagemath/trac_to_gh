I propose to restructure the manifold module. For example:

- separate the code related to the (pseudo-)Riemannian setting and dedicate a own module to it
- create a new module for vector bundles

Some things are currently very vague:

- `operators.py` clearly contains code related to differentiable manifolds but stays in the main module
- we have a submodule `subsets` but the separation is currently not very consistent; `subset.py` for example still belongs to the main module
