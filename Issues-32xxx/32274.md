I propose to restructure the manifold module. For example:

- separate the code related to the (pseudo-)Riemannian setting and dedicate a own module to it
- create a new module for vector bundles

Some things are currently very vague:

- `operators.py` clearly contains code related to differentiable manifolds but stays in the main module
- we have a submodule `subsets` but the separation is currently not very consistent; `subset.py` for example still belongs to the main module

**Status:** new

OK for this, provided there is some deprecation period (last time there were such changes, it broke codes relying on Sage sources, like the [kerrgeodesic_gw package](https://pypi.org/project/kerrgeodesic-gw/)).

Regarding `operators.py`, I agree with your remark; however, I would keep it in the main module for convenience of the end user, `from sage.manifolds.operators import curl` being shorter than `from sage.manifolds.differentiable.operators import curl`.
