Apparently https://github.com/sagemath/memory_allocator/pull/1 tests and fixes the issue.

That it is indeed tested, can be witnessed here:

https://github.com/sagemath/memory_allocator/actions/runs/1290649550

What is not nice, is that I didn't find a good way to have `python test.py` fail the github workflow except for `python test.py || exit 1`. This works, because `exit 1` is incorrect syntax (so not nice, but will do exact the desired thing).
