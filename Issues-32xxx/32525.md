```
sage: limit(e^(-1/x), x=0, dir='left', algorithm='fricas') 
plusInfinity()
```
should be

```
+Infinity
```

In fact, this has nothing to do with `limit`:

```
sage: fricas("%plusInfinity").sage()
plusInfinity()
sage: fricas("%infinity").sage()
infinity()
```

<a id='comment:3'></a>The reason is as follows:

```
sage: fricas.get_InputForm(f._name)
'(plusInfinity)'
```
means, that `plusInfinity` is a (nullary) function here.
Therefore, in `_parse_other`, `make_fun` is `True`, and `FRICAS_CONSTANTS` never kicks in:

```python
        if make_fun:
            try:
                e = symbol_table["fricas"][e]
            except KeyError:
                e = function(e)
        else:
            try:
                e = ZZ(e)
            except TypeError:
                try:
                    e = float(e)
                except ValueError:
                    try:
                        e = FRICAS_CONSTANTS[e]
                    except KeyError:
                        e = var(e.replace("%", "_"))
```

I wonder whether `%plusInfinity` was a constant in FriCAS before?  Or, alternatively, why this doctest passed?

<a id='comment:9'></a>Hi Frederic!

I can only guess what your question is.  More elaborate:
`in FriCAS, %plusInfinity::INFORM is (minusInfinity), so minusInfinity is a nullary function in FriCAS`.

The comment is there, because this is not the case for pi: `%pi::INFORM is %pi, so %pi is a constant in FriCAS`
