Trying to create an asymptotic ring involving a monomial non-growth group fails with:

```
sage: AsymptoticRing('n^(RBF*I)', ZZ)
AttributeError: 'ImaginaryGroup_with_category' object has no attribute 'one'
```
Adding

```
    def gens_monomial(self):
        return tuple()
```
to `MonomialNonGrowthGroup` seems to be enough to make it work, but I am not sure at all if it is correct.
