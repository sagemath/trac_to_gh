replace cysignal's optional PARI dependency by a general hook: is in good shape thanks to J. Kliem (see [cysignals #166](https://github.com/sagemath/cysignals/pull/166) and [cypari2 #130](https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/130)).

About cypari2 converging to cypari the main step is to have wheels bundling gmp+pari that works on windows. I am neither able to develop nor test that.
