As reported in https://ask.sagemath.org/question/56243/quotients-of-exterior-algebras/, we currently have the following behavior for generic ideals and quotients:

```
sage: E.<x,y,z> = algebras.Exterior(QQ);
sage: I = E.ideal(x-y);
sage: Q = E.quo(I);
sage: xbar,ybar,zbar = Q.gens();
sage: xbar == ybar
False
```

Tracing that back, the comparison in `quotient_ring_element` is given by:

```python
def _richcmp_(self, other, op):
    r"""
    ...
    """
    if self.__rep == other.__rep: # Use a shortpath, so that we
                                  # avoid expensive reductions
        return rich_to_bool(op, 0)
    I = self.parent().defining_ideal()
    return richcmp(I.reduce(self.__rep), I.reduce(other.__rep), op)
```

Taking a look at `reduce` of `sage.rings.ideal.Ideal_generic`, it gets clear why the comparison fails:

```python
    def reduce(self, f):
        r"""
        Return the reduction of the element of `f` modulo ``self``.

        This is an element of `R` that is equivalent modulo `I` to `f` where
        `I` is ``self``.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: ZZ.ideal(5).reduce(17)
            2
            sage: parent(ZZ.ideal(5).reduce(17))
            Integer Ring
        """
        return f       # default
```

<a id='comment:6'></a>It looks like the perturbator is rather `_richcmp_` in `rings.quotient_ring_element.QuotientRingElement` comparing two elements on the level of the ring, and not of the quotient.

Long story short, the implementation of `_richcmp_` in fact assumes that `reduce` returns the "minimal" reduction.

I am running sage 9.4.beta5 so I'm not sure if it is fixed there or what is going on. On the other hand, the exterior algebra still has the same behavior as in the description.

I was using my implementation in #32272. The class `GCAlgebra` uses a non-generic quotient.

<a id='comment:12'></a>We should not remove `_richcmp_` either. Equality check is generally not mathematical equality. Unfortunately Python does not allow `==` (and similar) to return a `Unknown`, which would technically be the way out (yet knowing when to it is unknown or not is a hard problem too).

Rather than spending time trying to block users in cases when we haven't implemented (or don't have general answers) that will potentially break code in the wild, we should spend time implementing the cases we do know.

For example, the exterior algebra can use:

- https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~slinko/Supervision/DominicSearlesMastersThesis.pdf
- https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00244487

In some sense, all you need to do is linear algebra since the exterior algebra is finite dimensional. Compute a basis for the ideal as a subspace (again, finite dimensional), and then take the quotient as vector spaces. Of course, this is not likely to be fast, but it works with very minimal code needed to be added/changed.

Note that in the second paper, the exterior polynomial algebra is the ungraded version of a graded commutative algebra. So that gives a Gröbner basis algorithm in that case if we also rewrite the GCA code with a more basic implementation.
