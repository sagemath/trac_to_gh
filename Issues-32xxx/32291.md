```
As reported in https://ask.sagemath.org/question/56243/quotients-of-exterior-algebras/, we currently have the following behavior for generic ideals and quotients:

```
sage: E.<x,y,z> = algebras.Exterior(QQ);
sage: I = E.ideal(x-y);
sage: Q = E.quo(I);
sage: xbar,ybar,zbar = Q.gens();
sage: xbar == ybar
False
```

Tracing that back, the comparison in `quotient_ring_element` is given by:

```python
def _richcmp_(self, other, op):
    r"""
    ...
    """
    if self.__rep == other.__rep: # Use a shortpath, so that we
                                  # avoid expensive reductions
        return rich_to_bool(op, 0)
    I = self.parent().defining_ideal()
    return richcmp(I.reduce(self.__rep), I.reduce(other.__rep), op)
```

Taking a look at `reduce` of `sage.rings.ideal.Ideal_generic`, it gets clear why the comparison fails:

```python
    def reduce(self, f):
        r"""
        Return the reduction of the element of `f` modulo ``self``.

        This is an element of `R` that is equivalent modulo `I` to `f` where
        `I` is ``self``.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: ZZ.ideal(5).reduce(17)
            2
            sage: parent(ZZ.ideal(5).reduce(17))
            Integer Ring
        """
        return f       # default
```

It looks like the perturbator is rather `_richcmp_` in `rings.quotient_ring_element.QuotientRingElement` comparing two elements on the level of the ring, and not of the quotient.

Long story short, the implementation of `_richcmp_` in fact assumes that `reduce` returns the "minimal" reduction.

Should we also remove `_richcmp_` completely? I have the feeling this code returns nonsense most times.

I'm now slightly confused. The example given in your sage-devel post is now working for me in the GCA case.

0
sage: Q2.gens()[0]^2 == 0  
True
```

I am running sage 9.4.beta5 so I'm not sure if it is fixed there or what is going on. On the other hand, the exterior algebra still has the same behavior as in the description.

I was using my implementation in #32272. The class `GCAlgebra` uses a non-generic quotient.
