In Debian with sphinx 4.3.1 I am getting these errors when building the documentation:

Extension error (sage.docs.conf):
Handler <function find_sage_dangling_links at 0x7fe31e14bf70> for event 'missing-reference' threw an exception (exception: No such config value: intersphinx_disabled_reftypes)

intersphinx_disabled_reftypes was introduced in sphinx 4.3.0 so I think we need to change something for compatibility.

Patch works for me in sage-on-gentoo with sphinx 4.3.1. I think we should make it into a proper branch.

Do you have something different or a previous ticket @antonio-rojas?
