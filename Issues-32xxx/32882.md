In the Jupyter notebook, in `%display latex` mode,
matplotlib figures give (latexed) text `Figure(...)`
instead of the actual figure.

Example (from ticket:32859#comment:28):

```
%display latex
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4])
plt.ylabel('some numbers')
plt.show()
```

Observed:

```
Figure(432x288)
```

Expected: an actual figure containing a 2D plot.
