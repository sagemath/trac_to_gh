In `FractionWithFactoredDenominator.asymptotic_decomposition`, a symbolic variable `asy_var` is introduced and used to build expressions, which is set to `var('r')` by default.

This is what makes the following snippet fail:

```
R.<x,y> = QQ[]
FFPD = FractionWithFactoredDenominatorRing(R)

G = 1
H = (1 - x)*(1 - y)*(1 - x*y)
Hfac = H.factor()
G = G/Hfac.unit()
F = FFPD(G, Hfac)

F.asymptotic_decomposition(alpha=[1, 1])
```
with

```
TypeError: r is not a variable of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
```

This is particularly unhelpful as the error doesn't occur when creating the element, but only when trying to compute the decomposition.

Ideally, the numerator parent should be extended accordingly automatically.

Component: **asymptotic expansions**
