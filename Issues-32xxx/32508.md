> Yes, that's what I thought

One problem with `__doc__.py` is that it is a fake module for it cannot be imported.

How about this:

`src/sage/combinat/__init__/__init__.py`

Then the namespace package `sage.combinat` get to have a subpackage `__init__` initialized by `__init__.py`, which we perhaps may use for "some initialization" as well as for package docstring.

Is this too much or incompatible with the modularization plan?

How does `all.py` work? 

(1) Does it exist by itself and import other `all__xxx` files into it? 

(2) Or is it dynamically created by combining `all__xxx` files? 

Anyway, if it is at `src/sage/combinat/all.py`, then it cannot be imported. Can it be?

Hmm. if the `all` module is just below in a namespace package (without `__init__.py`), I cannot import it. Do I misunderstand something?

For experiment, I created `src/sage/namespace/all.py` but no `src/sage/namespace/__init__.py`. I get

```sage
sage: import sage.namespace.all
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ModuleNotFoundError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-f30e99bc2b64> in <module>

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sage.namespace.all'

I disagree. `all.py` serves its own purpose and may have its own docstring.

On the other hand, `__doc__.py` is somewhat misleading as it appears "official" as much as `__init__.py`, which is not true.

Now I suggest `doc.py` to store package docstrings. This is just a sage thing.

<a id='comment:35'></a>Thanks for working on Sage's modularization and for investigating for
solutions!

I see the technical hurdles behind, and don't have a good solution to offer,
but I advocate for finding some technical mean to keep the functionality `package?` to retrieve
information about the package. This is consistent with how users retrieve
information by introspection for all other types of objects (functions, ...),
and when it's not there I have witnessed countless users during classes or
workshops struggle to find an entry point for the documentation (having
to search for the proper submodule; or leave the interpreter to search
around from the ref manual or browsing the web).

This is indeed not a widely adopted idiom in the Python world, yet this is so
natural that I believe we should push for it.

Thanks in advance,

package loading; so having a little dynamic monkey patching of the package
causes no risk.

Hence +1 on my side on the principle. Thanks!

We are supposed to deal with all `__init__` files. No?

Now that we have a solution, I think we need to polish the code, especially as it would be used as an idiom globally in Sage. 

Any ideas for improvement, in names or organization, are welcome.

There seems no better place for (namespace) package docstrings. But I am open for better ideas.

<a id='comment:47'></a>To do:
- `src/sage/dynamics/__init__.py` - because `sage.dynamics.complex_dynamics` needs `sage.symbolic` and everything else does not, see #32601
- `src/sage/combinat/root_system/__init__.py` - because `git grep 'cimport' src/sage/combinat/root_system/` reveals `from sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup_element cimport PermutationGroupElement`, and `git grep 'cimport' src/sage/groups/perm_gps` shows dependencies on numerous libraries: `gap`, `flint`

Not necessary to change:
- `src/sage/combinat/words/__init__.py` because `git grep 'cimport' src/sage/combinat/words` does not show compile-time dependencies on libraries, so `sage.combinat.words` does not have to become a namespace package

<a id='comment:56'></a>Looks good indeed.

Just one thing (that could possibly go in a follow up
ticket): would there be a way to maintain the validity
of cross-references like :ref:`sage.combinat` ?

First because it's easier to remember, and does not
reveal an implementation detail (that the doc is actually
stored in `sage/combinat/all.py`).

But also because, thanks to intersphinx links these
cross-references can be used from documents outside
of the Sage documentation, and this is breaking
backward compatibility for them.

Thanks,

If you compare "before" and "after" below, we see that Sphinx recognizes regular package and treat it appropriately. Hence I think we need to wait until Sphinx gets equipped with some mechanism to deal with namespace packages appropriately. It seems that Sphinx does not have such a mechanism yet (as far as I know by googling).
