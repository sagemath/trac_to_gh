This is a question for https://ask.sagemath.org/

Please give more details on what you tried.
With Sagemath 9.4.beta1, I can do

```sage
sage: G = graphs.strongly_regular_graph(378, 117, 36, 36)                                                                                        
sage: G                                                                                                                                          
complement(NO^+(7, 3)): Graph on 378 vertices
```
