The problem is that we are trying to access `num_edges` in `CGraph` or a derived class and this just does not exist.

`num_edges` of `CGraphBackend` is not what we want, I would say. Way too slow for a quick sanity check.
Locks good so far.
Maybe we could improve the sanity check for the undirected case:

```
if (self._directed and cg.num_arcs < cg.num_verts - 1) or (not self._directed and cg.num_arcs / 2 < cg.num_verts - 1):
```

<div id="comment:7" align="right">Comment 7</div>

From `c_graph.pyx`:

```
2342     cpdef add_edge(self, object u, object v, object l, bint directed):
...
2440         if not directed and self._directed and v_int != u_int:
2441             cg.add_arc_label_unsafe(v_int, u_int, l_int)
```

But this is also how `num_edges` works. I guess it is better and safer to call `self.num_edges(self._directed)`. It's rather quick actually.

}
```

<div id="comment:9" align="right">Comment 9</div>

The current fix is:

```diff
-        if cg.num_edges() < cg.num_verts - 1:
+        if cg.num_arcs < cg.num_verts - 1:
```

I would propose instead

```diff
-        if cg.num_edges() < cg.num_verts - 1:
+        if self.num_edges(self._directed) < cg.num_verts - 1:
```

Both seems to work fine. The later one should help to detect a bit more cases.
However, its not super important, as graphs with fewer edges than vertices minus 1 fail quickly anyway.
