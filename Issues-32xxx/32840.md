Calls of `register_unpickle_override` appear in various parts of the Sage library.

As we are modularizing the library -- and delaying the import of some modules -- we need to make sure that `register_unpickle_override` calls that appear in late-imported modules are respected.

This change allows us to remove some eager imports.
