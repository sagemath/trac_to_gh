Cython is one of the packages whose testsuites I disable in the tox-based tests for this reason.

```
$ git grep SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES

```

The normal defaults are set in `build/make/Makefile.in`:

```
build/make/Makefile.in:SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES_DEFAULT_yes := !python3
build/make/Makefile.in:SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES_DEFAULT_warn :=
build/make/Makefile.in:SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES_DEFAULT_no :=
```

We should probably unify this!
