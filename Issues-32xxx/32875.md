Currently, for the zero ring obtained by taking the quotient of a univariate polynomial ring by `1`, the returned Krull dimension is wrong. Precisely it should be `-1` or `-infinity`, according to conventions, but here the one returned is the Krull dimension of the base ring minus `1`. The corresponding method should be modified to handle this as a specific exceptional case (the formula is indeed correct for all other situations).

Examples:

```
sage: PolynomialRing(ZZ,'x').quotient(1).krull_dimension()
0

sage: PolynomialRing(ZZ,'x').quotient(1).krull_dimension()
1
```

I have reviewed the added code (simple fix by checking if quotient is the zero ring), and the added documentation string giving a description of what the method does. Looks good to me.
