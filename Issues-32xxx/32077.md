As reported on [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/57796/bug-polynomial-variable-name-matters/) :

```
P.<a, y, z> = ProjectiveSpace(QQbar, 2)
f = a^3 + z^3
C = Curve(f)
g = (a + y)^3 + z^3
D = Curve(g)
print(C.intersection_points(D))
```

leads to

```
TypeError: Unable to enumerate points over Algebraic Field.
```

However, if we replace the indeterminate `a` with `x`:

```
P.<x, y, z> = ProjectiveSpace(QQbar, 2)
f = x^3 + z^3
C = Curve(f)
g = (x + y)^3 + z^3
D = Curve(g)
print(C.intersection_points(D))
```

leads to:

```

 (-1 : 1.500000000000000? - 0.866025403784439?*I : 1),

Oddly (don't ask me why I tried), I cannot replicate this behaviour on 8.9.rc0. So it's probably a problem that has been introduced recently, or made apparent by a recent change elsewhere.

I am very curious how this could happen from the changes in #27953 because it is the factoring that fails with the polynomial

```
x + 0.500000000000000? + 0.2886751345948129?*I
```
which is then propagated up. The minimal polynomial of the constant is `x^2 - x + 1/3`. I can reproduce this directly:

```
sage: R.<a,y,z> = QQbar[]
sage: x = QQ['x'].gen()
sage: a + QQbar.polynomial_root(x^2 - x + 1/3, CIF(RIF(0.4,0.6), RIF(0.25,0.3)))
a + 0.500000000000000? + 0.2886751345948129?*I
sage: _.factor()  # boom!
```
Contrast with

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQbar[]
sage: a = QQ['a'].gen()
sage: x + QQbar.polynomial_root(a^2 - a + 1/3, CIF(RIF(0.4,0.6), RIF(0.25,0.3)))
x + 0.500000000000000? + 0.2886751345948129?*I
sage: _.factor()
x + 0.500000000000000? + 0.2886751345948129?*I
```
However, the problem is going deeper with `quo_rem(self, right)` in `rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_element.py`. More tracing seems to be required.

Before #27953, the ambient projective space of the curve is implicitly constructed without `names` argument. After #27953, it is always constructed with `names` set to the variable names of the parent ring of the given multivariate polynomial. Hence now with #27953, the variable names could possibly affect the behavior of methods of curves.

Anyway, the fault is with the method that behaves differently depending on the variable names!

Some more to the mystery:

sage: f = c + QQbar(sqrt(2))
sage: f % c
1.414213562373095?
sage: R.<b,c> = QQbar[]
sage: f = c + QQbar(sqrt(2))
sage: f % c
1.414213562373095?

sage: R.<b,a> = QQbar[]

sage: f % b
1.414213562373095?
sage: f = a + QQbar(sqrt(2))
sage: f % a  # Boom
```
It does seem very specific to calling a variable `a`:

```
sage: R.<aa,a> = QQbar[]
sage: f = aa + QQbar(sqrt(2))
sage: f % aa
1.414213562373095?

A tiny sliver of information. For:

```
sage: sage: R.<b,a> = QQbar[]
sage: sage: f = a + QQbar(sqrt(2))
sage: f % a
```
I'm getting

```
TypeError: Singular error:
   ? division(`number`,`number`) failed
   ? error occurred in or before STDIN line 26: `def sage10=division(sage8,sage9);`
```
Indeed, in the debugger (one level up from the raise error) I'm ending up in the singular interface (Note it's the singular *interface*; not libsingular! That's already fishy), trying to execute exactly that statement:

```
ipdb> p self.eval('sage8')
'(2*a)'
ipdb> p self.eval('sage9')
'(a)'
ipdb> p self.eval('basering')
'// coefficients: QQ[a]/(a^2-2)

 //        block   1 : ordering dp
 //                  : names    b @@(1)
 //        block   2 : ordering C'
```
Note that the 'a' here is already used for `sqrt(2)`, so I can imagine this produces a clash.

**EDIT**: the method `as_number_field_element` seems to have a preference to using `a` as a variable name. Of course, this causes problems if we then use a strings-based interface combined with a polynomial ring over it that also uses `a` as a variable. Would the situation improve if we were to use `libsingular` instead?

Of course, it's still strange that the division doesn't work: we're not particularly dividing by 0, even with the name collision (I guess we are dividing constants as far as singular is concerned. Perhaps it doesn't like that?)

So here Sage uses Sage variable names as corresponding Singular variable names. It is surprising to me that there is no translation mechanism working between Sage variable names and internal Singular variable names.

`division` performs quotient and remainder division. It is inappropriate to apply it to elements of a field (`QQ[a]/(a^2-2)`). Hence the clash.

This turns out a general problem of the Singular interface.

```
sage: F.<a> = GF(2^3)
sage: R.<x,y> = F[]
sage: f = x+a
sage: f
x + (a)
sage: f._singular_()
x+(a)
sage: R.<a,b> = F[]
sage: f = a + F.gen()
sage: f
a + (a)
sage: f._singular_()
0 
```

A simple-minded approach to fix the problem is to always assign unique Singular identifier name for every generator names of a new Sage ring. We don't need to work around.

The big problem for this is the dictionary that is necessary for the translation back. The dictionary must live in a place accessible to the interface that is asked to translate one of its objects into a sage object. The most straightforward version would key on the interface name-string and have as value the object.

I suspect it will be more problematic for interfaces like singular, which could for instance interface for many curves over finite fields.

The original design was intentionally naive, providing just basic interfacing. I think the basic interface level doesn't have enough information available to address lifetime management problems. 

For this particular example, I think the right fix is actually to see if libsingular can be used instead. This is pretty basic arithmetic, so an expect interface is a pretty high-overhead solution.

```
sage: F.<a> = QQ.extension(SR.var('y')^2 - 2)
sage: R.<x,y> = F[]
sage: R._singular_()
polynomial ring, over a field, global ordering

// number of vars : 2
//        block   1 : ordering dp
//                  : names    x y
//        block   2 : ordering C
sage: R.<a,y> = F[]
sage: R._singular_()
polynomial ring, over a field, global ordering

//                  : names    @@(1) y
