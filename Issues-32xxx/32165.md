On second thoughts, I see that this test was introduced recently (in #30801) just to test that the numbers returned are all integral, so I am going to change the test to

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + x + 1)                                                                                                                
sage: all(x.is_integral() for x in K.ideal(8).invertible_residues())                                                                                  
True
```
