While reviewing a ticket (see [#31414 comment:3](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31414#comment:3)), I found a failing doctest:

```

It was also mentionned in [#31443 comment:119](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31443#comment:119). This failing test was produced while running [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) version 9.4.beta4 on Ubuntu 20.04.1.

I could not find any specific ticket for this issue, but if there is one already, please tell me and close this ticket.

On second thoughts, I see that this test was introduced recently (in #30801) just to test that the numbers returned are all integral, so I am going to change the test to

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + x + 1)                                                                                                                
sage: all(x.is_integral() for x in K.ideal(8).invertible_residues())                                                                                  
True
```
