The existing module for the extraction of the asymptotic coefficient growth of multivariate generating functions, `sage.rings.asmyptotic.asymptotics_multivariate_generating_functions`, is generally functional (and useful).

At the same time, the current implementation also has a few problems and inconveniences:

- The interface requires users to preprocess their input in a rather specific way (which makes it a bit tedious to use),
- the error handling throughout the code is not particularly user friendly, if something goes wrong users are rarely able to recover,
- and there are several examples where the implementation currently breaks down although it should work.

This meta-ticket aims to provide an overview of the known issues and ongoing improvement efforts.

## New features

- #31908 (automation of computation of minimal critical points)

## Bugs and unhelpful error messages

- #32019 (ungraceful handling of generating functions with constant denominator)
- #32020 (`critical_cone` returns `None` when corresponding point has non-rational coordinates)
- #32023 (`cohomology_decomposition` fails with a lifting error)
- #32054 (`asymptotic_decomposition` fails when `numerator_ring` is not `SR`)
