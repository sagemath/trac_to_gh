<a id='comment:25'></a>The default build fails if `makeinfo` is not installed. I don't immediately see how to disable it, it seems to be hardwired.
In its aclocal.m4 one sees

```
# Some tools Automake needs.
AC_REQUIRE([AM_SANITY_CHECK])dnl
AC_REQUIRE([AC_ARG_PROGRAM])dnl
AM_MISSING_PROG([ACLOCAL], [aclocal-${am__api_version}])
AM_MISSING_PROG([AUTOCONF], [autoconf])
AM_MISSING_PROG([AUTOMAKE], [automake-${am__api_version}])
AM_MISSING_PROG([AUTOHEADER], [autoheader])
AM_MISSING_PROG([MAKEINFO], [makeinfo])
AC_REQUIRE([AM_PROG_INSTALL_SH])dnl
AC_REQUIRE([AM_PROG_INSTALL_STRIP])dnl
AC_REQUIRE([AC_PROG_MKDIR_P])dnl

so it seems to be treated in the same scope as autotools.

Definitely no - it does not exist on macOS without homebrew.


I'd suggest to investigate comment 17 above more. 

The generated files are a clear use case for just being shipped in the "make dist" of lcalc.

This isn't a good long-term solution even if we can hack autotools to avoid re-running gengetopt. Currently only the package name and version (which are static) are substituted into the ggo file, but that should change. For example...


```
$ lcalc -O5 -z 10

ERROR: lcalc has not been compiled with openmp enabled.
...
```

Ignoring the nonsense advice it gives you, that option simply shouldn't be present. In other words, `./configure --disable-openmp` should not add the `-O` flag to the gengetopt file. Likewise for the elliptic curve flags that require `--with-pari`. Fixing that will make it thoroughly impossible to ship the generated C++ sources.

I've opened https://gitlab.com/sagemath/lcalc/-/issues/12 to track the issue.

I don't think so. I think in general a user would prefer that a package informs them about an option disabled at compile time rather than just pretending that it has never heard of this option.

I can see your point, but am still aesthetically opposed to compiling in decoy options. If the user builds lcalc from source, the decoy options do him no good, since he's the one that disabled them in the first place. And if he's using a binary package, having them documented also does him no good, since he can't do anything about it. And in this case, while OpenMP isn't too bad, the pari options significantly clutter up the `--help` output.

If there were no gengetopt at all, I think these option would have been hidden by an `#if HAVE_FOO` a long time ago.
