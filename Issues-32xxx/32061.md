The default build fails if `makeinfo` is not installed. I don't immediately see how to disable it, it seems to be hardwired.
In its aclocal.m4 one sees

```
# Some tools Automake needs.
AC_REQUIRE([AM_SANITY_CHECK])dnl
AC_REQUIRE([AC_ARG_PROGRAM])dnl
AM_MISSING_PROG([ACLOCAL], [aclocal-${am__api_version}])
AM_MISSING_PROG([AUTOCONF], [autoconf])
AM_MISSING_PROG([AUTOMAKE], [automake-${am__api_version}])
AM_MISSING_PROG([AUTOHEADER], [autoheader])
AM_MISSING_PROG([MAKEINFO], [makeinfo])
AC_REQUIRE([AM_PROG_INSTALL_SH])dnl
AC_REQUIRE([AM_PROG_INSTALL_STRIP])dnl
AC_REQUIRE([AC_PROG_MKDIR_P])dnl
```

so it seems to be treated in the same scope as autotools.

Definitely no - it does not exist on macOS without homebrew.


I'd suggest to investigate comment 17 above more. 

The generated files are a clear use case for just being shipped in the "make dist" of lcalc.

This isn't a good long-term solution even if we can hack autotools to avoid re-running gengetopt. Currently only the package name and version (which are static) are substituted into the ggo file, but that should change. For example...


```
$ lcalc -O5 -z 10

ERROR: lcalc has not been compiled with openmp enabled.
...
```

Ignoring the nonsense advice it gives you, that option simply shouldn't be present. In other words, `./configure --disable-openmp` should not add the `-O` flag to the gengetopt file. Likewise for the elliptic curve flags that require `--with-pari`. Fixing that will make it thoroughly impossible to ship the generated C++ sources.

I don't think so. I think in general a user would prefer that a package informs them about an option disabled at compile time rather than just pretending that it has never heard of this option.

If there were no gengetopt at all, I think these option would have been hidden by an `#if HAVE_FOO` a long time ago.
