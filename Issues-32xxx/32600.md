<a id='comment:5'></a>While it's not an issue here since it is not the main part of the algorithm, changes like this do incur a slight performance penalty:

```diff
-    if isinstance(z, (RealNumber, ComplexNumber)):
+    if isinstance(z.parent(), (RealField, ComplexField)):
```
This is just for future reference.
