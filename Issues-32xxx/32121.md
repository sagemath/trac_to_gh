`EnumeratedSets.ParentMethods.map` uses `MapCombinatorialClass`.

`map`'s docstring explains that that class needs to be refactored to use categories.

Part of #12913 (Meta-ticket: Deprecate `CombinatorialClass` in favor of the `EnumeratedSet`'s categories)

- #31653#comment:1 for a discussion of existing `image` and `pushforward` methods of maps.

<a id='comment:42'></a>Thank you. Just a few more little things:

- Since `_star` is only called in one place, I think it should just be done inline. This will also save you from having to write a docstring/test for it.
- `lift` and `retract` need doctests.
- `MapCombinatorialClass`, `_an_element_`, and `ImageSet` are missing periods at the end of their one-line descriptions.
- In both `map()` docs:
  {{{#!diff
-        Use ``is_injective=False`` to get a correct result in this case.
+        Use ``is_injective=False`` to get a correct result in this case::
 
             sage: P.map(len, is_injective=False).list()
             [1, 2, 3, 4]
  }}}
  {{{#!diff
         INPUT:
 
- ``is_injective`` -- boolean (default: ``True``) whether to assume
-          that ``f`` is injective.
+          that ``f`` is injective
  }}}
- I am not sure how I feel about being so detailed in the code copyright declaration. I understand the legal reason, but it is a bit tedious to maintain (it is already out of date) and might create legal issues with the license (including some people may not be claiming copyright as they did not change that statement). This is probably more towards bikeshedding though...

More importantly perhaps, it looks much better if there is year for year activity by several authors. If copyright notices stop in 2006 because the updating work has been neglected, the file and perhaps the whole project looks stale to the casual observer.

> it is a bit tedious to maintain (it is already out of date)


It does not have to be perfect. And if it looks updated, people will be motivated to keep it updated.

> and might create legal issues with the license (including some people may not be claiming copyright as they did not change that statement). 


Copyright is established whether there is intent or not, whenever there is a copyrightable change in a given year.
