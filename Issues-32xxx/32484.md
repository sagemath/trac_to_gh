The documentation of `is_kernel_polynomial` in `src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/isogeny_small_degree.py` states that the function checks if the polynomial defines a *cyclic* subgroup, but cyclicity is not really tested:

```
sage: from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.isogeny_small_degree import is_kernel_polynomial
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1,0])
sage: is_kernel_polynomial(E, 25, E.division_polynomial(5))
True
```

Also, we fix a typo (`m`→`a`) and slightly rephrase the docstring for clarity.

The new text is not correct for non-cyclic isogenies: for example, the 2-division polynomial has degree 3 and is a valid kernel polynomial for the multiplication-by-2 map which has degree m=4, though [m/2]=2 not 3.

I wrote this function (at least, the original version) and its docstring, only needing it for cyclic isogenies of prime degree, though he algorithm does not require m to be prime.  If you want to check for more general kernel polynomials, you will need to implement something new.  For the kernel to have structure [mn,n] I think that f would have to factor as the n-division polynomial times a cyclic m-polynomial (as tested here) but you need to be very careful in case either m or n is even.

As it stands, the second part of the test (closure under multiplication maps) does check that the zeros of the polynomial form a union of subgroups (minus the identity point at infinity); the degree check was to ensure that they form a single subgroup of the correct order.

Unless you really need the more general version, I suggest changing this back (apart from the typos changing m to a in *two* places -- those are my fault).

Thanks for your comment! I agree that the new version is wrong (my bad). But just keeping the old version is wrong too:

- `is_kernel_polynomial(E, 25, E.division_polynomial(5))` (not cyclic)
- `is_kernel_polynomial(E, 6, E.division_polynomial(2))` (not cyclic & wrong degree!)

...both return `True`. The current documentation states:

> Test whether `E` has a cyclic isogeny of degree `m` with kernel polynomial `f`.


...which means these examples should return `False`.


According to your comment, the fix for `is_kernel_polynomial` in isolation would be to simply add a restriction that `m` must be prime, as that has always been an assumption of the code anyway. However, the `EllipticCurveIsogeny` constructor calls `is_kernel_polynomial` with composite degrees (this was apparently introduced in #23222), which is incorrect at the moment and would obviously break if we started enforcing `m.is_prime()` now. So, it seems the only real way out is to generalize `is_kernel_polynomial` to arbitrary subgroups? (I don't mind writing some code, if this is what we want.)


Here's an example where the current situation can actually lead to a wrong isogeny:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(71^2), [0,1])
sage: R.<x> = E.base_field()[]
sage: h = x^4 + 26*x^3 + 61*x^2 + 4*x + 19
sage: psi = E.isogeny(h)
sage: psi.domain().is_isogenous(psi.codomain())
False
```

(The subset defined by this `h` can be identified with
  `{(0,0), (3,0),(6,0), (0,1),(0,2),(0,4),(0,5),(0,7),(0,8)}`
under an isomorphism `E[9] ≅ ℤ/9 × ℤ/9`. Notice in particular that this is not a union of subgroups.)
