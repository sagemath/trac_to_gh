(from #30876)

`centos-7` has EOL June 2024 and comes with the very outdated gcc 4.x, which we will not be able to use any more (see #32074)

We add variants `centos-7-devtoolset-gcc_{9,10,11}`, following  https://stackoverflow.com/a/67212990/557937; to test:

```
tox -e docker-centos-7-devtoolset-gcc_11-standard
```
This prepares a switch from `centos-7` to `centos-7-devtoolset-gcc_11`, as suggested by dimpase in #30876#comment:12
("nobody nowadays is using gcc 4 on Centos 7... We can and should drop gcc 4, without dropping OSs")

(This is not needed for `fedora` because even the oldest that we currently support, `fedora-26`, comes with GCC 7.1.1.)
