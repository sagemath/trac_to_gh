```
Unless `./configure --enable-editable` is used, the Sage library is installed directly into `site-packages` using `setup.py install`, and at the end of `sage_setup`'s custom `sage_install_and_clean` invokes the installation cleaner, which removes "stale" installed files.

The installation cleaner is problematic when we start to install optional modules in the `sage.*` namespace via separate distributions such as **sagemath-tdlib** (#29864). 
- `pkgs/sagemath-standard/setup.py` will no longer enable optional Cython modules based on which optional packages are installed
- but the installation cleaner needs to know about these optional Cython modules so it does not remove them right after their installation.

In this ticket we solve this problem by removing the use of the installation cleaner from `pkgs/sagemath-standard/setup.py`. Instead we invoke it separately at the end of the installation script `build/pkgs/sagelib/spkg-install`.


(An alternative solution, replacing this installation procedure by a standard installation procedure using wheels, as proposed in #32874, would make `sage -b` much slower. Also, the idea of just making `./configure --enable-editable` the default, #32406, has met skepticism.)

Before we close this ticket, to clarify why this approach was abandoned, let me ask a couple of questions:

Would `setup install` work when optional distributions that contain namespace packages were installed?

Would `legacy-install-cleaner` work when optional distributions that contain namespace packages were installed?

If answers to both are yes, then the branch of this ticket could be an alternative to #32874?
