There is a gap in our dependencies. 
The `graphviz` package only checks for executables in the system package test (`spkg-configure.m4`). But `pygraphviz` needs header files and presumably the shared library -- which on `debian` are in a separate system package https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/libgraphviz-dev

```
$ cat build/pkgs/graphviz/spkg-configure.m4 
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE([graphviz], [
    dnl We check all executables that are tested by sage.features.graphviz
    AC_CHECK_PROGS([DOT], [dot])
    AS_IF([test x$DOT = x], [sage_spkg_install_graphviz=yes])
    AC_CHECK_PROGS([NEATO], [neato])
    AS_IF([test x$NEATO = x], [sage_spkg_install_graphviz=yes])
    AC_CHECK_PROGS([TWOPI], [twopi])
    AS_IF([test x$TWOPI = x], [sage_spkg_install_graphviz=yes])
])
$ cat build/pkgs/graphviz/distros/debian.txt 
graphviz
$ cat build/pkgs/pygraphviz/dependencies 
$(PYTHON) graphviz | $(PYTHON_TOOLCHAIN)
```

The solution is to add a dummy script package `libgraphviz` in the same way that it is done for `nauty`, `libnauty`.

This looks verbose, why not simply put both `graphviz` and `libgraphviz-dev` in the distro file of the `graphviz` spkg, as we do for `openssl` ?
