Copying and pasting multi-line function definitions in the gap sub-interpreter results in a syntax error.

For instance:


```
sage: gap.interact()

   --> Switching to Gap <--

gap: test := function(n)
...:     return n+1;
...: end;
   File "<ipython-input-1-f9af418de61e>", line 1
     test := function(n)
          ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Running the same example with `sage --simple-prompt` works fine, as does entering the function definition line by line.

This is tested with sage 9.3 and 9.4 beta4, with the shipped version of gap, and on a Linux x64 system.
