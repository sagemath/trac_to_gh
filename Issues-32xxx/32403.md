This removes the unpleasant failures of the `dist` job for tickets that add/update packages; and thus enables the `local-macos-nohomebrew` workflow for those.

The previous function of the `dist` job to check whether all SPKG tarballs have been uploaded is now taken over by a new standalone workflow (`sdist.yml`); it only runs on release tags.

It was designed to fail on branches that add/upgrade packages - until the release manager uploads the package tarball.

But I concede that this is at least poorly documented and does not serve us well any more in this form. 

We can use your change (so that the failure goes away). I would add here on the same ticket a new workflow that only runs on release tags, not other branches or tags, to run the old "make dist" without --enable-download-from-upstream-url.
