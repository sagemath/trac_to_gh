This used to work in Sage 9.0:

```
sage: RealBallField(2)(abs(exp(1)+I))
[+/- 4.01]
```
but does not work any more in Sage 9.3:

```
sage: RealBallField(2)(abs(exp(1)+I))
...
TypeError: unable to convert abs(e + I) to a RealBall
```

On CoCalc, this works in 9.1, but not in 9.2.  Since #18036 seems to have been merged in 9.3, I don't think it is the issue.
