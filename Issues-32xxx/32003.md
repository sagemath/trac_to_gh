This used to work in Sage 9.0:

```
sage: RealBallField(2)(abs(exp(1)+I))
[+/- 4.01]
```
but does not work any more in Sage 9.3:

```
sage: RealBallField(2)(abs(exp(1)+I))
...
TypeError: unable to convert abs(e + I) to a RealBall
```

This has some doctest failures from the patchbot:

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/rings/complex_arb.pyx  # 3 doctests failed

Looks like a change in precision.

Also, minor `.. warning::` -> `.. WARNING::`.
