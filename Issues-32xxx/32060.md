This will make it an error if no suitable system `gcc` is found.

It can be overridden by the user by `--without-system-gcc`. Our `gcc` stands out from other SPKGs because building it often fails, for example because suitable binutils are lacking.  

(from https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/cSsAsPuVnxg/m/fDBOSaYZBgAJ)


Currently, `force` leads to immediate exit, without printing the system package advice. We also change this.  This is a useful improvement in its own right.


Discussion of other packages to which the same logic should be applied is beyond the scope of the present ticket.

the proposal was to minimize unnecessary tricky package building on a typical system.
Typically Python3.7 or newer is available.

What's the point of building Python, and other packages which are just a click away, such as GMP? To accelerate global warming?

It also ensures that downloading the source release wastes a few hundred megabytes of bandwidth and then disk space.

We should eliminate the gcc and python SPKGs entirely. They serve no purpose at all, and require constant maintenance, support, and physical resources. In the rare case where gcc or python3 are not available from a package manager or binary download, using conda or nix is preferable to using the sage spkg.

there are standalone distributions of gfortran for macOS by the gfortran maintainer of the Homebrew package.
To me this offers a way to entirety remove gcc and gfortran spkgs from Sage.

it is hard to tell, but I guess the majority of users is using prebuilt Sage.

<a id='comment:43'></a>I've put a broken `gcc` ahead of everything in my PATH, and tried `./configure`

Is this how the error regarding missing gcc should look like?

```
checking for gcc... gcc
checking whether the C compiler works... no
configure: error: in `/mnt/opt/Sage/sage-dev':
configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
See `config.log' for more details
```

and there is nothing beyond that in `config.log`, no `more details`, really, except `configure: exit 77` as the last line.

No, see comment:35. This ticket is not about early exits caused by standard autoconf macros. It is about our spkg-configure which uses more specific tests regarding the compiler.

If you want to test this properly, use a working but out-of-version-range compiler such as gcc 4.4 or 12.dev.
