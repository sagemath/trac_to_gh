This will make it an error if no suitable system `gcc` is found.

It can be overridden by the user by `--without-system-gcc`. Our `gcc` stands out from other SPKGs because building it often fails, for example because suitable binutils are lacking.  

(from https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/cSsAsPuVnxg/m/fDBOSaYZBgAJ)


Currently, `force` leads to immediate exit, without printing the system package advice. We also change this.  This is a useful improvement in its own right.


Discussion of other packages to which the same logic should be applied is beyond the scope of the present ticket.

Here's a beginning. `./bootstrap && ./configure --with-system-libsemigroups=force --with-system-pari_galpol=force` on homebrew (which does not have these packages) now leads to:

```
configure:

    notice: the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages:

          _recommended coxeter3 gp2c igraph libsemigroups pari_elldata pari_galpol pari_nftables pari_seadata perl_cpan_polymake_prereq perl_mongodb
        
[...irrelevant system package advice...]

configure: error: 

    Given --with-system-libsemigroups=force, but no system package could be used.
    That's an error.  Please install the indicated package to continue.
    (To override this error, use ./configure --without-system-libsemigroups)
    Given --with-system-pari_galpol=force, but no system package could be used.
    That's an error.  Please install the indicated package to continue.
    (To override this error, use ./configure --without-system-pari_galpol)
```

Feel free to make refinements to the wording by pushing to this ticket...

The benefits of changing them to \"force\" by default are less clear, since we will still be responsible for shipping and maintaining SPKGs that will never get used. (Using `--without-system-gcc` is always a mistake, and likewise for python3.)\n\nNevertheless, setting them to \"force\" can be seen as step towards removal, so I'm not against it.

Well, someone asked "what's the point?" The benefits of deleting the SPKGs are clear. The benefits of changing them to "force" by default are less clear, since we will still be responsible for shipping and maintaining SPKGs that will never get used. (Using `--without-system-gcc` is always a mistake, and likewise for python3.)

Nevertheless, setting them to "force" can be seen as step towards removal, so I'm not against it. I just don't think it solves the issue that prompted the mailing list thread -- that we are involved in this mess in the first place. All of the core packages that are available everywhere and are well-supported (for multiple versions) in sage should be relegated to _prereq or _bootstrap.

there are standalone distributions of gfortran for macOS by the gfortran maintainer of the Homebrew package.
To me this offers a way to entirety remove gcc and gfortran spkgs from Sage.

I've put a broken `gcc` ahead of everything in my PATH, and tried `./configure`

Is this how the error regarding missing gcc should look like?

```
checking for gcc... gcc
checking whether the C compiler works... no
configure: error: in `/mnt/opt/Sage/sage-dev':
configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
See `config.log' for more details
```

No, see[comment:35](#comment%3A35). This ticket is not about early exits caused by standard autoconf macros. It is about our spkg-configure which uses more specific tests regarding the compiler.

If you want to test this properly, use a working but out-of-version-range compiler such as gcc 4.4 or 12.dev.
