This will make it an error if no suitable system `gcc` is found.

It can be overridden by the user by `--without-system-gcc`. Our `gcc` stands out from other SPKGs because building it often fails, for example because suitable binutils are lacking.  

(from https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/cSsAsPuVnxg/m/fDBOSaYZBgAJ)


Currently, `force` leads to immediate exit, without printing the system package advice. We also change this.  This is a useful improvement in its own right.


Discussion of other packages to which the same logic should be applied is beyond the scope of the present ticket.

Here's a beginning. `./bootstrap && ./configure --with-system-libsemigroups=force --with-system-pari_galpol=force` on homebrew (which does not have these packages) now leads to:

```
configure:

    notice: the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages:

          _recommended coxeter3 gp2c igraph libsemigroups pari_elldata pari_galpol pari_nftables pari_seadata perl_cpan_polymake_prereq perl_mongodb
        
[...irrelevant system package advice...]

configure: error: 

    Given --with-system-libsemigroups=force, but no system package could be used.
    That's an error.  Please install the indicated package to continue.
    (To override this error, use ./configure --without-system-libsemigroups)
    Given --with-system-pari_galpol=force, but no system package could be used.
    That's an error.  Please install the indicated package to continue.
    (To override this error, use ./configure --without-system-pari_galpol)
```

Feel free to make refinements to the wording by pushing to this ticket...

First, the help string in `./configure` still says that "yes" is the default for `--with-system-gcc`. Second, if I don't have `gcc` at all, then `./configure` stops before it prints the message, saying

```
configure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH
See `config.log' for more details
```
Third, should this also test for `gfortran`, or should we continue to build that without complaining? It would be nice on a platform like OS X to just quit with an error if `gfortran` is missing *and* the user is using homebrew, because there is no excuse, but maybe install it if there is no obvious package management system in place. That may be beyond the scope of this ticket.

The Sage philosophy used to be: treat developers and users as the same, and basically assume everyone was building from scratch. Have we moved enough away from this now that we can treat developers (by which I just mean people who compile Sage themselves) differently?

there are standalone distributions of gfortran for macOS by the gfortran maintainer of the Homebrew package.
To me this offers a way to entirety remove gcc and gfortran spkgs from Sage.

I've put a broken `gcc` ahead of everything in my PATH, and tried `./configure`

Is this how the error regarding missing gcc should look like?

```
checking for gcc... gcc
checking whether the C compiler works... no
configure: error: in `/mnt/opt/Sage/sage-dev':
configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
See `config.log' for more details
```

and there is nothing beyond that in `config.log`, no `more details`, really, except `configure: exit 77` as the last line.

No, see [comment:35](#comment%3A35). This ticket is not about early exits caused by standard autoconf macros. It is about our spkg-configure which uses more specific tests regarding the compiler.

If you want to test this properly, use a working but out-of-version-range compiler such as gcc 4.4 or 12.dev.
