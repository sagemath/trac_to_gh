This will make it an error if no suitable system `gcc` is found.

It can be overridden by the user by `--without-system-gcc`. Our `gcc` stands out from other SPKGs because building it often fails, for example because suitable binutils are lacking.  

(from https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/cSsAsPuVnxg/m/fDBOSaYZBgAJ)


Currently, `force` leads to immediate exit, without printing the system package advice. We also change this.  This is a useful improvement in its own right.


Discussion of other packages to which the same logic should be applied is beyond the scope of the present ticket.

Here's a beginning. `./bootstrap && ./configure --with-system-libsemigroups=force --with-system-pari_galpol=force` on homebrew (which does not have these packages) now leads to:

```
configure:

    notice: the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages:

          _recommended coxeter3 gp2c igraph libsemigroups pari_elldata pari_galpol pari_nftables pari_seadata perl_cpan_polymake_prereq perl_mongodb
        
[...irrelevant system package advice...]

configure: error: 

    Given --with-system-libsemigroups=force, but no system package could be used.
    That's an error.  Please install the indicated package to continue.
    (To override this error, use ./configure --without-system-libsemigroups)
    Given --with-system-pari_galpol=force, but no system package could be used.
    That's an error.  Please install the indicated package to continue.
    (To override this error, use ./configure --without-system-pari_galpol)
```

there are standalone distributions of gfortran for macOS by the gfortran maintainer of the Homebrew package.
To me this offers a way to entirety remove gcc and gfortran spkgs from Sage.

I've put a broken `gcc` ahead of everything in my PATH, and tried `./configure`

Is this how the error regarding missing gcc should look like?

```
checking for gcc... gcc
checking whether the C compiler works... no
configure: error: in `/mnt/opt/Sage/sage-dev':
configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
See `config.log' for more details
```

and there is nothing beyond that in `config.log`, no `more details`, really, except `configure: exit 77` as the last line.

No, see [comment:35](#comment%3A35). This ticket is not about early exits caused by standard autoconf macros. It is about our spkg-configure which uses more specific tests regarding the compiler.

If you want to test this properly, use a working but out-of-version-range compiler such as gcc 4.4 or 12.dev.
