In the `sage.rings.asymptotic` the function `sage.rings.asymptotic.misc.combine_exceptions` is heavily used for a readable and debugable output. In many cases, this can nowadays be replaced by `raise ... from ...`.

Advantages of `combine_exceptions`:
- Output is more readable than that of (a possibly long) `raise ... from ...`.
- Can combine multiple exceptions at one "level"

Advantages of `raise ... from ...`:
- Is the default way of handling chains of exceptions (nowadays).

I think that `combine_exceptions` should be phased out in favor of `raise ... from ...`, but with rather low priority. But I would advocate against introducing any new occurrences of `combine_exceptions`; so morally deprecate it.
