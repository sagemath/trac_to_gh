Thank you for your response.

Sagemath automatically renames the basis when submodules are taken, so there is no way to get around that if the user submits a submodule. However, if the variable is lifted, it does have the intended names. For example, When making a 2-dimensional submodule of a module with basis x, y, z, Sage renames the indices to 0 and 1. If the user submits this submodule and wants to extend this by a, b, c, then the returned submodule would have basis indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, where 2, 3, 4 are lifted to a, b, c respectively.

As for the specifying that it does not work with infinitely dimensional module, I agree.

Hello!

I did not look in details, so am not sure of the exact use case. 
So just asking: could the desired functionality be achieved with
the current cartesian product construction (or improving it if needed)?

```
sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['a','b','c'])
sage: G = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['i','j','k'])
sage: FG = cartesian_product([F, G])
sage: FG.basis().keys()
Disjoint union of Family ({'a', 'b', 'c'}, {'i', 'j', 'k'})
sage: phi = FG.cartesian_embedding(0)
sage: phi(F.an_element())
2*B[(0, 'a')] + 2*B[(0, 'b')] + 3*B[(0, 'c')]
```

Cheers,

Thanks Matthias for the suggestion.

FreeModule is meant to be subclassed to produce parents
which may have additional structure which may not be
preserved by the trivial linear map. For example,
we have a dozen of different realizations of the algebra
of symmetric functions which all share the same basis and
which are isomorphic (available as coercions); but these
isomorphisms are non trivial.

If we would add such a coercion, we would need to make
sure that it is not inherited which gets tricky.

In general: it's easy to add a coercion; hard to remove
an existing one. So my preferred approach is to be
very conservative in defining coercions by default,
and instead make it as trivial as possible for the user 
to add these that he cares about.

I am not sure I understand the inconsistency. The method goes to the top level, add new basis elements, and drops back down using the information gathered while climbing up.

The module from extend_basis would have a cleaner basis. For example, as I am working on #29806, I want to add the needed basis elements (if necessary) and reference specific basis elements without needing to check whether or not it is a product.

The method goes to the top level, add new basis elements, and drops back down using the information gathered while climbing up.\n\n\nIf that's the case, then it sounds like a direct sum. When forming `A (+) B`, it does not care about how the module `A` was constructed. Contrast this with taking the union. Is the union more of the behavior you want, so repeated indices are discarded? How the basis elements are indexed should not matter on if it is an ambient module or a submodule, no matter if you mean direct sum or union. The only thing is matters is what does an element indexed by `X` mean? Is it meant to always be something in the ambient module?\n\nAs an example, consider `A = span{X,Y}`, where this means the basis elements of `A` are `b_X` and `b_Y`.

If that's the case, then it sounds like a direct sum. When forming `A (+) B`, it does not care about how the module `A` was constructed. Contrast this with taking the union. Is the union more of the behavior you want, so repeated indices are discarded? How the basis elements are indexed should not matter on if it is an ambient module or a submodule, no matter if you mean direct sum or union. The only thing is matters is what does an element indexed by `X` mean? Is it meant to always be something in the ambient module?

As an example, consider `A = span{X,Y}`, where this means the basis elements of `A` are `b_X` and `b_Y`. Then take a 1 dimensional submodule `B = span{Z} < A`, where `b_Z` is some vector in `A`.
