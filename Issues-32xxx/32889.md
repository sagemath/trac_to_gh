```
Part of #32651.

We also move `neighborliness` to `Polyhedron_base3` (missed on #32884)
and `_sage_input_` and `_delete` to `Polyhedron_base0`.

Depends on #32884

Nothing new, just moved that code. It's all in test methods, that do not test in case features relying on graphs. E.g.

```
    def _test_combinatorial_face_as_combinatorial_polyhedron(self, tester=None, **options):
    ...
        try:
            import sage.graphs.graph
        except:
            pass
        else:
            tester.assertTrue(P.combinatorial_polyhedron().vertex_facet_graph().is_isomorphic(D1.vertex_facet_graph()))
    ...
```

Instead of

```
try:
    import sage.graphs.graphh
except ImportError:
    pass
else:
    # do something
```

We could also do something as:

```
from importlib.util import find_spec
if find_spec("sage.graphs") and find_spec("sage.graphs.graph"):
    # do something
```

> The version with `from sage.features.normaliz import PyNormaliz` is the better one. (from #27744)

Yes, that is the version I based in upon. Wasn't easy. The merge conflict file was huge.

So what I did was pull `u/gh-kliem/Polyhedron_base3` into `develop`. Then undid #27744 in `base.py`. Then I pulled `u/gh-kliem/Polyhedron_base4`. Redid #27744 and then squashed the three commits.
