Follow-up from #32234.

After #32234, `sage.ext.fast_eval` only contains the function `fast_float`, a thin wrapper around `fast_callable`.

We deprecate this module and switch all uses of `fast_float` to direct calls to `fast_callable`.

```
$ git grep -l fast_float

src/sage/calculus/desolvers.py

src/sage/ext/fast_eval.pyx
src/sage/geometry/riemannian_manifolds/parametrized_surface3d.py
src/sage/interacts/library.py
src/sage/plot/plot.py
src/sage/plot/plot3d/implicit_surface.pyx
src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.pyx
```


Depends on #32234
