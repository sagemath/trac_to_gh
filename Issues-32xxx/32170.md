We define APIs for static and dynamic containers storing finite families of geometric objects, extending `Container`, `Set`, `MutableSet`, `Mapping`, `MutableMapping` https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html

The family must define a collection of "measurement maps" `B_i`, each sending an object to an `InternalRealInterval`. 

The product of these intervals can be thought of as a "generalized bounding box".

Ideally the maps would be inclusion-preserving.

The implementation is provided by `rtree`/`libspatialindex` (#32000).

The Sage-specific class will take care of:
- replacing an `InternalRealInterval` by a rescaling or inclusion-preserving overestimation, making the coordinates suitable for the underlying library.
- providing accelerated set operations such as: 
  - a fast path for computing empty `intersection` when the result will be empty,
  - a fast path for `__contains__` when the result will be `False`.

Geometric lookup operations to be supported:
- ...

Applications:
- `RationalPolyhedralFan`
- `PolyhedralComplex` (#31748)
- Families/posets of (open) subsets of manifolds (#31740): A natural choice of the maps `B_i` comes from the coordinates of covering charts, using `(-oo, oo)` for coordinates for which no coordinate definition for the subset is known

The precision of interval values in Package `libspatialindex` is `double`.

They did not claim it explicitly, but I found it from
- `https://rtree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/class.html#rtree.index.Index`
- `https://github.com/libspatialindex/libspatialindex/blob/master/include/spatialindex/capi/DataStream.h`.

OK, the next step would be to find out whether the library does any arithmetic with these `double` values (in this case we would have to check whether they apply directed rounding correctly), or whether they only use comparisons on these `double` values.

A few test codes have been made for testing arithmetic precision. The conclusions are as follows, more details and codes can be found from this(https://github.com/DRKWang/Data-structure-for-piecewise-linear-function/blob/main/log35.ipynb).

- The dimension of the index database should always be greater than 1. (0 or 1 dimension will fail).

- The arithmetic precision is 16 decimal digits, which comes from the double type's precision. 

- The minimal capturing of arithmetic precision is 324 decimal digits, which means the minimal difference to distinguish two numbers is 1*10^{-324}. otherwise, they will be viewed as the same number.

- The intersection for retrieving is a closed intersection. (-0.000) is also considered as the same number as 0, but both representations will be displayed at the same time.

- Rounding. The round processing is a little complex and untraceable, it is neither rounding up or rounding down.

- The extensions, `.idx` and `.dat`, are two files used to serialize the rtree to disk, according to https://rtree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html.

- Those two files are created by `#include <fstream>` internally, based on this source code, https://github.com/libspatialindex/libspatialindex/blob/master/src/storagemanager/DiskStorageManager.cc.

- The `.idx` is used to store vital information like the page size, the next available page, a list of empty pages, and the sequence of pages associated with every entity ID.There is no note for the detail or purpose of `.dat` file. Thus, I made a test where putting 50 boxes into this library. The shows that the `.dat` is way larger than `.idx`, which indicates the `.dat` is used to store the real data, whereas `.idx` is used for storage the rest of it.

- The correct way to close and reopen those serialized files can be found here, https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/254781/saving-python-rtree-spatial-index-to-file

- Except for `DiskStorageManager`, it also has a `MemoryStorageManager`. The detail of it is that "Everything is stored in main memory using a simple vector. No properties are needed to initialize a `MemoryStorageManager` object. When a `MemoryStorageManager` instance goes out of scope, all data that it contains are lost."

- The `.dat_extension = xxx` and `.idx_extension = xxx` can be used to change the names of those extensions.

That's right, we are not replacing the internal representation of `RealSet` instances.

We are only adding an index data structure to it.

> For `intersection`, can you propose a function for `rtree` that would help?

Yes, I think `rtree.count()` also can help with that when there is a non-intersection between RealSet A and RealSet B, And I have implemented the code.

I see. I have made the changes inside the `RealSet` class by replacing `RealSet` with `self.__class__`. And I feel those replacements only need to happen under 2 following conditions,
- It was after the `return`. Therefore, the function will finally `return` the corresponding class, and apart from `return`, it is necessary to make a replacement.
- We can not make those replacements under the function that has a ``@`staticmethod` decorator. Since function with ``@`staticmethod` does not have `self` parameter, which means we can not use `self.__class__` to help.

Specifically, the functions I made the change are `union()`, `intersection()`, `complement()`, `__mul__()`.

I tried the first example from your worksheet, after importing the class:

```
sage: from sage.sets.real_set import RealSet_rtree                                                                                                                           
```

```
sage: A = RealSet_rtree(0,1) 
....: B = RealSet_rtree(0.5,3) 
....: C = A.intersection(B) 
....: type(C)                                                                                                                                                                
```

I get this error:

```
~/s/sage/sage-rebasing/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/sets/real_set.py in __init__(self, *intervals)
   2707             if (x_max < lower) and (lower != +Infinity):
   2708                 x_max = lower
-> 2709             if (x_max < upper) and (upper != +Infinity):
   2710                 x_max = upper
   2711         if x_max == 0: #rtree is not needed, since they are only +-infinity and zero!

NameError: name 'Infinity' is not defined
```

This means that you need to add some import statements to the file.
You can type `import_statements('Infinity')` to help with this.

The doctests of the new class `RealSet_rtree` are copy-paste from `RealSet` and do not test the new class. Best to replace them by the tests that you have in your worksheet.

Don't worry about it. It's easy to clean up the commit history later

In order to make the projecting directions more separable with respect to cones of a given fan, we could generate certain directions based on the inclination of cones of a given fan instead of randomly.

Suppose the dimension of universal space is $n$. Concretely, 

1. We will compute the inclination first. We measure this inclination of the fan with "average point" $q$. The average point is defined by $q = \sum p_i$, $\{p_i\}$ are the points along with the generating rays of the fan and whose 1-norm is exactly 1.

2. Then, choose a set of orthogonal basis $\{v_j\}$ coming from the complementary space of the space generated by $q$, i.e. $\forall i$, $v_j  \perp q$. Note that, since the average point $q$ could be zero vector, in that case, we will choose $N(1,0,...0)$, $N(0,1,..., 0)$,..., $N(0,0,...,1)$ as the basis. The chosen set of orthogonal basis  $\{v_j\}$ could be good candidates for seperating the cones of fan. One way of generating the orthogonal basis $\{v_j\}$ will be using [Gram–Schmidt process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process).

3. After generating an orthogonal basis $\{v_j\}$, the basis will be stored in the class `RationalPolyhedralFan` as attributes of the class. and those attributes will be invoked for generating new boxes for function `_contains()`.

Supposedly, there are $n$ boxes in $k$ dimension for construction. \n\nThe idea of top-down should be made by recursive operation, which means the parent tree will be built after their children's trees were built. My expectation will be something like an H tree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_tree), which has a property of self-similar fractal, or like a $k-D tree$. Anyway, the similarity of the subsets of boxes can be displayed on the rtree. Concretely, one way to do this is as follows:\n\n1. Separate the whole boxes into 2 subsets, equivalently in terms of numbers, based on their X-coordinate.

For the static construction, we may build the rtree by 3 ways, top-down, bottom-up or hybrid. Supposedly, there are $n$ boxes in $k$ dimension for construction. 

The idea of top-down should be made by recursive operation, which means the parent tree will be built after their children's trees were built. My expectation will be something like an H tree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_tree), which has a property of self-similar fractal, or like a $k-D tree$. Anyway, the similarity of the subsets of boxes can be displayed on the rtree. Concretely, one way to do this is as follows:

1. Separate the whole boxes into 2 subsets, equivalently in terms of numbers, based on their X-coordinate. And take those 2 subsets as the materials for building the left sub-rtree and right sub-rtree.
2. Cyclically switch the criteria from x-coordinate to y-coordinate, to z-coordinate with separating the subsets smaller and smaller until the number of subsets equal 1. For this case, the complexity of it will be $nlog(n)+2* n/2 log(n/2) + 4* n/2 log(n/4) + ... + n*1 log(1) <= n log(n) * log(n) $


For the bottom-up, we may use the greedy strategy to do the local optimization on each step. We can always merge two boxes based on some criteria, like merging the two boxes that have minimal 1-norm distance. And replace the 2 boxes with merged box, so that the size of the input will be decreased by 1, (now the number of boxes will be $n-1$). Thus, after $n-1$ steps, the rtree will be built completely.

The complexity will be at least `n^2`, since we will compute the distance at least.

For the hybrid one, we can build the rtree partially by top-down and partially by bottom-up in certain steps. But, how to combining them adaptively is still a hard problem for me. I would like to implement the first two before thinking about the third one.

The following content in latex form can be checked in this link.(https://github.com/DRKWang/cutgeneratingfunctions_new/blob/main/logsfile/log48.ipynb)

To determine whether a given fan is a pointed fan or not, we may encode it into an linear optimization.

##### Observation:

If a fan is pointed, then there exists a containing-the-original-point hyperplane that could divide the space into 2 half-spaces, one containing the fan and the other not.

##### Analysis:
We may think about finding the normal vector of this hyperplane via optimzation.
Let us encode it.

Supposing that the normal vector of this hyperplane is $x$ and 1-norm vectors of the generating rays of all cones in the fan are $r_i, i\in A $,

then we may have let the constraints be:

$x \cdot r_i \ge 0$

Since we do not hope to get $x = 0$, we may add an extra constraint, $x_1 = 1$, for getting one representing element.

If we can not find any solution for this system, then the fan is not pointed.
If we can find one solution, then the fan is pointed.

In practice, in order to give a initial solution for simplex method, we may change the system into the following form:

max. : $x_1$

s.t. 

$x \cdot r_i \ge 0$

$1\ge x_1 \ge 0$

As is desired, $x = 0$ always be the solution for this system.

##### A better hyperplane for generating better projection

Seemingly, we may have optional hyperplanes for the same system. The ideal hyperplane would be constraints are all $>$, instead of $\ge$. We may get rid of $x_1 = 1$ and add a little "balance" for each constraints to get it. i.e.

$x \cdot r_i - b_i\ge 0$

$b_i$ are all some given small positive numbers.

Similarly, in order to have a initial solution, we may change the system into the following form:

max. :$ b_0$

$x \cdot r_i - b_i\ge 0$

$b_i \ge b_0$

$1\ge b_0 \ge 0$ 

As is desired, $x = 0$ always be the solution for this system.

Except for the above view, we may think differently from the view of the convex hull of the fan, but it will be much harder than the above one, in terms of implementation and theory.

Based on the following observation, we can have:

If the convex hull of the fan is the universal space, then it is not pointed; otherwise, it is pointed.

Thus, we can figure out the convex hull to determine whether it is pointed or not.

As is enlightened by your idea for considering the double descriptions of cones, facets, and generating rays, we may have a facets-based method to find the proper normal vector of the separating hyperplane for a pointed fan.

*Observation:*

For a cone, a ray is in the (interior or boundary) of its polar cone, if and only if, the ray can induce (an interior or a boundary) separating hyperplane, whose normal vector is the ray, for this cone.

Note that the polar cone of cone $C$ is defined by the negative dual cone of cone $C$, i.e.

the polar cone of cone $C$ = $\{y | y\cdot x \le 0, \forall x \in C\}$

Thus, to figure out the separating hyperplane for a fan, the polar cones of cones in this fan can provide help.

*Observation:*

For a fan, a ray is in the interior points of the common intersection of all polar cones of the fan, if and only if, the ray can induce an interior separating hyperplane for the fan.

*Proof*

A ray is in the interior points of the common intersection of all polar cones,

$\iff$ it must be in the interior points of each polar cone,

$\iff$ it must induce the same interior separating hyperplane for each cone in the fan,

$\iff$ it must induce an interior separating hyperplane for the fan.

Thus, we can have a better understanding of the location of the normal vector of separating hyperplane for a fan. Meanwhile, we can also use it to determine whether a fan is a pointed fan or not.
