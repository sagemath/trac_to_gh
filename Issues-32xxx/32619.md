```
When loading a modularized part of Sage instead of `sage.all`, we should suppress the second of these two messages:

```
        if startup_guard and not self._at_startup:
            print(f"Resolving lazy import {self._name} during startup")
        elif self._at_startup and not startup_guard:
            print(f"Option ``at_startup=True`` for lazy import {self._name} not needed anymore")
```

Also, instead of `print`, we should use `warnings.warn`.
