I think it strips those flags when building the sage library (which is the right thing to do in any case), but probably doesn't solve the issue in the original bug report because it's most likely coming from some SPKG and not the sage library itself.

OpenBLAS is a prime suspect, since 0.3.13 will use certain machine-specific instructions when no `TARGET` is specified: https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/3056

On sage-support, Nathan said that the mac app has to set `TARGET=CORE2` to support macs from 2013. I think to fix the same problem, we need to decide how old of a computer should be able to run the sage binaries, and set a `TARGET` appropriately when `SAGE_FAT_BINARY` is used. (Of course, this is all based on the guess that OpenBLAS is to blame. Can anyone reproduce the problem?) If no one else has an opinion, `TARGET=CORE2` sounds fine to me. Building from source is always an option.

I can't say anything about that, but I confirm that Samuel's suggestion fixes an at least related issue that I had on the device I described in [this sage-devel post](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/6cEaXzbzHqA/m/cKE2KlfOAwAJ) (output of `lshw`):

Here my observation:

1. I still could build one of the first beta of 9.6 (beta3 IIRC) on this computer without giving any options to `configure`.
2. The build of 9.7.beta0 breaks with *SIGILL*  in `sagemath_doc_html-none` and on startup even after setting `--enable-fat-binary`.
3. The build of 9.7.beta0 runs without any problems after doing the changes suggested by Samuel.

So, my opinion is that we should do this fix since it is surely an improvement. If it really would not help for the original issue then that could be a follow up ticket (or the other way around).

FWIW: I made another try on the device I described in [comment14](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/32434#comment:14) after installing LinuxMint 21 (vanessa) which is build on Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy). I did that on a fresh git clone of Sage 9.8.beta3 merged with the branch of the ticket. On a first step, I wanted to test with `--enable-fat-binary` but without `--disable-editable`. Accidentally, I typed `--enable-sage-fat-binary` instead of `--enable-fat-binary`. I guess that's the same as giving no option. Unexpectedly, it ends up with a pretty well working Sage.

Furthermore I tried two binary installations of stable 9.7. Using the docker image `sagemath/sagemath:9.7` everything works fine, too, while if I use conda I'm getting an illegal instruction error on startup of Sage, as it was according to comment 14 with 9.7.beta0 after building from source under LinuxMint 19.3.

Apart from the latter fact it seems that the issue has been fixed for my device. I have no idea what could have caused that: The upgrade of the OS or changes in Sage?
