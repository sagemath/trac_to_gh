On Tiger Lake CPUs, our Dockerfile fails to build. Apparently, openblas performs a compilation with `-march=tigerlake` even though it won't use that flag when building later.

This flag is not understood by gcc 9 which is installed on Ubuntu 20.04 which is the basis of our docker image.

Upgrading to a more recent Ubuntu fixes the issue since it then installs gcc 10+.
