$ ./sage -tp src/sage/combinat/partition.py

```
I at least use these shortcuts a lot, but I guess that is not a strict requirement to have them fixed. It would just mean a lot of relearning for me.

These both continue to not work (so they don't need to be fixed)

```
$ ./sage -btp8 src/sage/combinat/partition.py 
Error: unknown option: -btp8
$ ./sage -tp8 src/sage/combinat/partition.py 
Error: unknown option: -tp8

but this now works (before it didn't):

```
$ ./sage -t -p8 src/sage/combinat/partition.py

Note that
`./sage -tp 8 src/sage/combinat/partition.py`
works fine, and same for btp.

There is an inherent ambiguity in the options

```
-p filename.py
```
that argparse cannot really handle, if I understand correctly.

<a id='comment:17'></a>I would see a solution to avoid breaking `sage -tp file.py`

but at the prize of breaking

`sage -tp 4 [...]`

The idea is to always add the argument 0 to `-p` when using `-tp` or `-btp`.

So what would you prefer ?

People would still be able to use

```
sage -t -p 4 [...]
```

<a id='comment:40'></a>This breaks running `sage -t file --optional=foo` for me, regardless of the optional tags I specify

```
> sage -t /usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/sets/integer_range.py --optional=sage
too many failed tests, not using stored timings
Running doctests with ID 2021-10-12-12-41-27-6d41dc7c.
