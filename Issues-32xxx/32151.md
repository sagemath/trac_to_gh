It seems that ppl does very good in detecting that the bipyramid can be understood from a lower dimensional structure. Not sure, if this should be accounted for.\n\nKeywords: **polyhedron, double description, precomputed, bipyramid**\n\nBranch/Commit: **[`30c429d`](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/30c429dcf242d6e0dcd5cc42fb2568386001b3dc)**\n\nReviewer: **Travis Scrimshaw**\n\nAuthor: **Jonathan Kliem**\n\nComponent: **geometry**\n\n_Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32151_\n\n",
