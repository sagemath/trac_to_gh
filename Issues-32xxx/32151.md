It seems that ppl does very good in detecting that the bipyramid can be understood from a lower dimensional structure. Not sure, if this should be accounted for.\n\n**Keywords:** polyhedron, double description, precomputed, bipyramid\n\n**Branch/Commit:** [30c429dcf242d6e0dcd5cc42fb2568386001b3dc](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/30c429dcf242d6e0dcd5cc42fb2568386001b3dc)\n\n**Reviewer:** Travis Scrimshaw\n\n**Author:** Jonathan Kliem\n\nIssue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32151\n\n",
