Huh.  I have no input here - you may very well be right, but I don't recall messing with this particular module in that context.  However, [this log](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commits/develop/src/sage/structure/graphics_file.py) seems to indicate it actually originates from trying to make the old ipython notebook work by trying to recognize files that should actually be displayed - perhaps that is still necessary for Jupyter (new or old or future)? Looks like Volker wrote it.  On a related note, did you try launch viewer in the command line to see what happens (if anything)?  

Of course, all of that is just a bunch of questions; if it really isn't used any more, this would seem pretty reasonable to remove.

That file was added in #16996, to support graphics output in the pre-jupyter era ipython notebook. It seems that as Sage went over to use jupyter rich-output facilities, the `GraphicsFile` class provided by the file became out of use. The function `graphics_from_save` also seems to have become the method of the same name of the display manager defined in `sage.repl.rich_output`.

Hence I am positive to deprecate this file.
