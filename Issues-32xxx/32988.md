Of course, all of that is just a bunch of questions; if it really isn't used any more, this would seem pretty reasonable to remove.

That file was added in #16996, to support graphics output in the pre-jupyter era ipython notebook. It seems that as Sage went over to use jupyter rich-output facilities, the `GraphicsFile` class provided by the file became out of use. The function `graphics_from_save` also seems to have become the method of the same name of the display manager defined in `sage.repl.rich_output`.

Hence I am positive to deprecate this file.
