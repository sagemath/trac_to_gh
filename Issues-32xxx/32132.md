The claim of the doctest is that the orbit length of `gyration` on `AlternatingSignMatrices(5)` is a divisor of 10, which appears to be incorrect:

```
sage: def test_orbit_length(n): 
....:     a0 = a = AlternatingSignMatrices(n).random_element()    
....:     for i in range(10000): 
....:         a = a.gyration() 
....:         if a == a0: 
....:             return i + 1 
....:                                                                                                                                 
sage: lcm(foo(5) for _ in range(1000))

```

Thanks for the pointer. I didn't know where to look for this. So this isn't a bug apparently.
