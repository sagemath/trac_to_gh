Ticket #27912 was resolved by adding the `PackageManager` package to the gap_packages spkg.  By default the `PackageManager` installs packages in ~/.gap.  That is an excellent choice, at least for the purpose of the Sage_macOS app, since it does not require writing into the app bundle and thereby corrupting the code signature.  However, packages installed that way are only usable with libgap.eval().  Neither gap.load_package nor the gap_console() know to look for packages in that directory.  This is easily corrected by adding a -l option to the command used to start gap.  I will attach a patch.

Perhaps it would be better to use ~/.sage/gap in place of ~/.gap .  This would presumably require modifying the `PackageManager` package, however.
