It seems to me that all of the following things should throw errors instead of whatever is happening right now:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: f = x^3 + y^2
sage: f.subs({x^3: 2})
y^2 + 8
sage: f.subs({-1: z})
#### (crashes)
```

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = BooleanPolynomialRing()
sage: f = x*y + z
sage: f.subs({x+y: z})
y*z + z
sage: f.subs({1: 0})
x*y + z
```

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ, implementation='generic')
sage: f = x^3 + y^2
sage: f.subs({5: z})
x^3 + y^2
sage: f.subs({x+y: z})
x^3 + y^2
```

```
sage: L.<x,y,z> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: f = x^3 + y^2
sage: f.subs({-17: z})
x^3 + y^2
sage: f.subs({x^2: z})
x^3 + y^2
```

<a id='comment:3'></a>I think this is more clear:

```diff
-for v in (in_dict.keys() if in_dict is not None else ()):
+if in_dict:
+    for v in in_dict:
```
(This might also make better compiled Cython code too.)

You are backwards on your `::` versus `:` in the docstring endings.

I don't see the need to wrap this

```diff
-                    var = P(var)
+                    try:
+                        var = P(var)
+                    except TypeError:
+                        raise TypeError("keys do not match self's parent")
```
You can just let the error propagate up.

I would make the error message a little more concise:

```diff
-cannot substitute {v}: not a variable in {self.parent()}'
+{v} is not a variable in {self.parent()}'
```
