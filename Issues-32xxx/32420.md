There are some upcoming changes that will require changes to doctests.

Done:
- Adjust tests to change in printing of `FiniteSet` https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21941#issuecomment-905930750
- Changes to `heaviside` (https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/21945) were reverted or resolved otherwise (https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/22117, https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/22117) by upstream
- Adjusted tests to some changes to expression formatting https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21941#issuecomment-905386713
- Relax doctest for `laplace(dirac_delta)`


The branch on this ticket is also currently used as the target for the CI workflow https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-sage.yml added in PR https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21941

sympy 1.9 will include a change to `heaviside` (https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21452), defining it at 0.

Question: Will this require changes on our side (other than adjusting doctest output - waiting for possible printing changes in sympy https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/21945)?
