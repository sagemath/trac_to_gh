This is deprecated as of #30479.

I don't think this needs to be fixed, so I marked it as random.

In this case, method `random_DAG` returns `{0: {}, 1: {}, 2: {}, 3: {}, 4: {}}`, so no edges, and the `DiGraph` constructors sets `multiedges = True` in method `from_dict_of_dicts` of `sage.graphs.graph_input`. I pushed a new branch fixing this issue and so the reported failure in `sandpile.py`.
