<a id='comment:10'></a>It is always a bit difficult when a big dependency is merged :(

Anyway focusing on the individual commits at the beginning. 
* From the detection pattern I see in `sage-runtests`, I would have never tested something with a tag "build" before the change. 
* The stuff in `sage_setup` will pass, I checked it. 
* I replace `package.py` with a minimal file with no affected tests.
* I am unsure what will happen in `tests/cmdline.py`, those tests would have been skipped before, I am not quite sure what happens to them now. I don't know how `sage_spkg` is triggered but if it is some of these tests will fail (`sage --info ...`).

By the way, I believe there is a space missing at https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/tests/cmdline.py?id=c9b48a3c200d4f41c576e339ebe0a37cbac074e0#n210
at the very least it is inconsistent with the rest.
