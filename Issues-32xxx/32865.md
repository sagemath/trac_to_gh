<a id='comment:9'></a>Thank you for the german lesson!

So we need to choose between "complicated" or "more complicated". Note also that Frédéric made this change:   

```diff
-Voici un exemple plus compliqué de liste :
-
-::
+son nom l'indique — une liste d'objets arbitraires. Voici un exemple
+de liste::
```
Perhaps we at least need to be consistent. I leave this to Frédéric to decide.
