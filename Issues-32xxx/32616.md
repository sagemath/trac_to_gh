This file is for setting up a separate venv, for example for installing a stable snapshot of what is in the current source tree.

Variant 1
- just add `--no-index --find-links=SAGE_ROOT/venv/var/lib/sage/wheels/` to the contents of `src/requirements.txt`

- adds sagelib (always source location, but not editable)

- if `configure --enable-editable` is in use, uses source locations (but not editable) for packages like `sage_setup`, `sage_conf` instead of wheels

Variant 1b

- if `configure --enable-editable` is in use, require `make wheels` (from #33817)

Variant 2
- basically the output of `pip freeze` (`@ file:///` URLs, fixed as described in #30956)


We can also add a convenience script `sage --venv /SOME/DIRECTORY` for creating and populating the venv

Depends on #33817
