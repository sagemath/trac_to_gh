This needs approval from several modular-interested people.

Hi,

I ran

```
dimension_cusp_forms
```
and was sent to this page with a deprecation warning.  Fair enough.  I land here with only one obvious big question on my mind: WHERE DID THIS FUNCTION GET MOVED TO?

After a few minutes, I don't know.  Before you actually really deprecate this functionality, it would be nice if you provide a link that points to where the new functionality is, e.g., some sort of table?   Or at least put a table here with a note in the ticket description that says "See table below".

Obviously, I know that I could look at commits to the git history or use search_src or search our docs to answer this question, but it seems like the answer should be more easily available here too, as I'm thinking about other users besides me.  

In any case, using search_src I find

```
search_src('dimension_cusp_forms')
...

sage: from sage.modular.dims import dimension_cusp_forms
```

In any case, I do of course agree that "sage.modular.dims" is a good place to put this functionality.

Empty "Authors" or "Reviewers" fields prevent merging tickets.

I wish it was the same for the "Description" field.
