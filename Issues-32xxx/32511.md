When the argument to `minimize_constrained()` is a symbolic function, it does...


```python
var_list = func.variables()
```

but (as documented) the `variables()` method sorts the variables alphabetically. This leads to incorrect output when the `variables()` order does not agree with the order of the arguments to your function; say if your function if `f(z,y,x)` and the minimizer is output as `(x,y,z)`.

I've added a "soft dependency" on #32234 here to avoid a merge conflict.

FWIW both symbolic functions and expressions support an `arguments()` method that does not sort its result. Fixing this may be as easy as replacing `.variables()` with `.arguments()`.

I think this is OK. The documentation for `minimize_constrained()` says that it should take either a symbolic function, or a python function. It was our `EXAMPLES` that were misleading and that I've fixed in the latest commit.

When `arguments()` is deprecated, anyone still trying to use expressions with `minimize_constrained()` will be warned. Then when it's removed, you won't be able to use non-callable expressions at all. And that's fine. A tuple return value is meaningless when the only way to "call your expression" is via a dict.
