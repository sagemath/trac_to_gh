```
Due to an oversight, a repology file for termcap
was added in #31114, merged in Sage 9.3.beta8,
while termcap was being removed in #31268,
merged in Sage 9.3.beta9.

Here we complete the termcap removal by removing
the no-longer-needed repology file for termcap.

Are `./bootstrap -q` and `./configure -q`
expected to output the following?
