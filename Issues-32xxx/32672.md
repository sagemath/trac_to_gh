In the version of setup.py used by the editable install:

```
 extensions = cythonize(
        ["**/*.pyx"],
```
at least it should restrict itself to `sage/**/*.pyx`
so that it does not go cythonizing in random directories that the user may have in this directory... such as a venv...

Btw, this is how I verified how it works. `cythonize` calls `extended_iglob`

```
sage: _ = !cd $SAGE_SRC
sage: from Cython.Build.Dependencies import extended_iglob
sage: a = list(extended_iglob("sage/**/*.pyx"))
sage: b = list(extended_iglob("**/*.pyx"))
sage: list(t for t in b if not t in a)
['foo.pyx']
sage: list(t for t in a if not t in b)
[]
```

In my case I placed `foo.pyx` in `SAGE_SRC`.
