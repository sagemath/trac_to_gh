Fedora puts `arb.h` in arb/ subdirectory.
This means this has to be dealt in some way, if we want to use arb system library.

Issues for packages depending on arb:
- https://github.com/symengine/symengine/issues/1815
- https://github.com/flatsurf/e-antic/issues/200

Status: new

Is any of the packages that use `arb` prepared to find headers in Fedora's install location?

it's only `symengine`, apart from `sagelib`, that lists `arb` as a dependency.

And no, `symengine` can't find `arb` there, I get cmake erroring out:

```
