Fedora puts `arb.h` in arb/ subdirectory.
This means this has to be dealt in some way, if we want to use arb system library.

Issues for packages depending on arb:

This is not new in Fedora 35. According to "blame" on https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/arb/blob/rawhide/f/arb.spec, this change happened in 2015. Currently we do not seem to accept system `arb` on any Fedora release (on older releases, the prerequisite FLINT is too old.)

Is any of the packages that use `arb` prepared to find headers in Fedora's install location?

it's only `symengine`, apart from `sagelib`, that lists `arb` as a dependency.

And no, `symengine` can't find `arb` there, I get cmake erroring out:

```
