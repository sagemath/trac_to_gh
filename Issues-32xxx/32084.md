<a id='comment:1'></a>The problem seems to be that `mod(a, n).nth_root(k)` sometimes returns a value that is not actually a `k`th root of `mod(a, n)`:

```
sage: for n in range(100):
....:     for k in range(2*n):
....:         kth_powers = set(x^k % n for x in range(n))
....:         bad = set( (a, mod(a, n).nth_root(k), mod(a, n).nth_root(k)^k) for a in kth_powers
....:             if mod(a, n).nth_root(k)^k % n != a)
....:         if bad:
....:             print(n, k, bad)
50 50 {(49, 49, 1), (24, 24, 26)}
50 75 {(7, 7, 43), (43, 43, 7), (32, 32, 18), (18, 18, 32)}
75 50 {(49, 74, 1), (24, 24, 51)}
75 75 {(7, 7, 43), (18, 18, 57), (68, 68, 32), (57, 57, 18), (32, 32, 68), (43, 43, 7)}
98 98 {(79, 79, 67), (30, 30, 18), (67, 67, 79), (18, 18, 30)}
```
In the above examples, the erroneous `kth` root of `a` is always `a` itself, but there are larger examples where this is not the case. For example:

```
sage: n = 147
sage: a = 67
sage: k = 98
sage: mod(a, n).nth_root(k)
116
sage: (116^k) % n
79
```
