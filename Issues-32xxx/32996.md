With earlier versions of pari, this worked:

```
sage: from sage.lfunctions.pari import lfun_number_field, LFunction
sage: L = LFunction(lfun_number_field(K))
sage: L(0)
0.000000000000000
```

However with pari-2.13.3, it throws a warning:

```
File "src/sage/lfunctions/pari.py", line 318, in sage.lfunctions.pari.lfun_number_field
Failed example:
    L(0)
Expected:
    0.000000000000000
Got:
      ***   Warning: normalizing a series with 0 leading term.
    0.000000000000000
**********************************************************************
```

An ellipsis was added in #32797 to keep the test suite passing, but no warning is thrown when performing the same computation in gp:

```
$ gp -q
? L = lfuncreate(x^2 - 2);
? lfun(L,0)
0
```

I think we should investigate why our interface to the function throws a warning.

Resolution: invalid
