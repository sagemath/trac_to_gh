<a id='comment:13'></a>I see four ways to deal with it:
- Resolve `LazyImport` somewhere in the coercion model.
- Add a custom `__instancecheck__` in `Parent`.
- Fix `parent(foo)`, when `foo` is a `LazyImport` instance.
- Accept this shortcoming of lazy imports and just revert the last commit (and comment that coercion with lazy imports does not work currently).

What do you think of it?
