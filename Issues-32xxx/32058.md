<a id='comment:3'></a>Can you say why `"Permutation"` needs quotes but not `Composition`?

Some changes I would consider (unless they slow things down):

```diff
-        return [i + 1 for i in range(len(self)) if i + 1 == self[i]]
+        return [i for i, v in enumerate(self, start=1) if i == v]
```

```diff
-        return {i + 1: self[i] for i in range(len(self))}
+        return dict(enumerate(self, start=1))
```
But feel free to ignore as this leaves the ticket's scope.

Your changes in passing from the previous loops
are a clear improvement.

But `list[int]` was only introduced in Python 3.9, so we can't use it yet as we still support Python 3.7 and 3.8.  So we have to either use `List[int]` -- or keep things simple and just use `list`.

+1 on a section on best practices for type annotations! I've opened #32067 for this.

I think we may also want to add a patchbot plugin that enforces presence of `from __future__ import annotations` whenever something that looks like a typing annotation is found in the file.
