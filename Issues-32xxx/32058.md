Can you say why `"Permutation"` needs quotes but not `Composition`?

Some changes I would consider (unless they slow things down):

```diff
-        return [i + 1 for i in range(len(self)) if i + 1 == self[i]]
+        return [i for i, v in enumerate(self, start=1) if i == v]
```

```diff
-        return {i + 1: self[i] for i in range(len(self))}
+        return dict(enumerate(self, start=1))
```
But feel free to ignore as this leaves the ticket's scope.

Your changes in passing from the previous loops
are a clear improvement.

merci pour les suggestions. C'est fait.

Pour "Permutation", c'est parce que c'est nécessaire pour annoter les méthodes d'une classe par elle-même. Pour éviter une boucle. Enfin, je crois.

The previous annotations were probably written before we dropped Python 3.6 support in #30551. Only since Python 3.7, `from `__future__` import annotations` exists.

I would think it's better to write these type annotations to one language standard instead of waiting for the first incompatibility to happen...

My point is that -- whether it is necessary or not for a specific file -- it is better to add it, because that reduces both the cognitive load for developers, and reduces the chance that things get broken.

There is no point in writing code to an already outdated standard when adding `from `__future__` import annotations` makes the current standard available to all supported Python versions.

But `list[int]` was only introduced in Python 3.9, so we can't use it yet as we still support Python 3.7 and 3.8.  So we have to either use `List[int]` -- or keep things simple and just use `list`.

+1 on a section on best practices for type annotations! I've opened #32067 for this.
