Part of #32191 (Meta-ticket: Audit/fix all uses of `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` in `sage.combinat`, `sage.graphs`).

We update the following methods in `graph.py` and `bipartite_graph.py`:
- `vertex_cover`
- `independent_set`
- `clique_maximum`
- `clique_number`

also rename parameter `verbosity` to `verbose` with deprecation.
