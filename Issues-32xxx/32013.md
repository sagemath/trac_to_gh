A `Polyhedron` is not a `Parent`, so `Set` refuses to construct the set of its elements.

We change this by creating a new abstract base class for non-necessarily-parent sets with methods `union`, `intersection`, etc.

`ConvexSet_base` (from #31919) and `RealSet` now both inherit from `Set_base`.  To complete the implementation of the `Set_base` protocol, we add an implementation of `RealSet.symmetric_difference`.

So we can now do the following things:

```
sage: Set(polytopes.cube())                                                                                                                                                                          
Set of elements of A 3-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices
sage: polytopes.cube().union(polytopes.tetrahedron())                                                                                                                                                
Set-theoretic union of Set of elements of A 3-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices and Set of elements of A 3-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices
```
