The distribution **sagemath-gsl** will contain all modules of the Sage library that have a dependency on GSL:

- sage.libs.gsl
- sage.calculus.integration, sage.calculus.ode, sage.calculus.transforms
- sage.probability.probability_distribution

Preparation:
- #32699 `sage.symbolic`: Remove direct use of gsl
- #32677 `sage.rings.real_double`: Move methods using GSL to a separate extension module



Status: new
