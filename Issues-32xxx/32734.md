What is the new policy? Do we intend to remove all `all.py` eventually? If not, what should(can) remain in `all.py`? Or this is determined by how we split sage library? The last case is not good, I think... 

Or there won't be no change in `all.py` but we stop importing things from it in Sage library?

May I understand the new policy as that we never import from `.all` within the Sage library?
