All `all.py` are kept, for the purpose of populating the global interactive environment (`sage.all`).

We are just getting rid of imports from `sage.PAC.KAGE.all` within the Sage library. In particular, the imports from those packages `sage.PAC.KAGE` that become namespace packages, i.e., filled with modules from several distributions.
