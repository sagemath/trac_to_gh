"Monkey-patch `inspect.isfunction()` to support Cython functions." 

Introduced in 2018 (8.3.beta2) in #25373 (for #24994).

However, this change has been rejected by upstream (https://bugs.python.org/issue30071, https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0575/,  https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0580/).

In this ticket:
- we remove the monkey-patching

- replace unnecessary uses of `inspect` in ordinary Sage library code by other solutions

- replace remaining uses of `inspect.isfunction` by the new name of our monkey-patched variant: `sage.misc.sageinspect.is_function_or_cython_function`


(To be checked whether https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0590, superseding some of the above rejected PEPs, offers help; see also the informational PEP https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0579/)

Related:
- #26254 No signature shown in help for cythonized built-in methods
- #27578 Use `sphinx.util.inspect.Signature`, not `sphinx.ext.autodoc.inspector.formatargspec`
- #31309 `sage_getargspec` mishandles keyword-only arguments

<a id='comment:24'></a>Ok, let's just merge the easy part then (I don't really want to look at plots either).

This bit in `integration.pyx` would be cleaner/faster with `hasattr()` I think:

```python
try:
    vars = func.arguments()
except AttributeError:
    try:
        vars = func.variables()
    except AttributeError:
        vars = sage_getargspec(func)[0]
```

Mismatched parentheses in docstring:

```python
"""
Think twice before using this function (or any function from the
``inspect`` or ``sage.misc.sageinspect`` modules.  Most uses of
``isfunction`` in ordinary library code can be replaced by ``callable``.
"""
```

You could also use Sphinx cross-module references there. Finally,

```python
"""
Verify that ipywidgets can correctly determine signatures of Cython
functions::

    sage: from ipywidgets.widgets.interaction import signature
    sage: from sage.dynamics.complex_dynamics.mandel_julia_helper import fast_mandelbrot_plot
    sage: signature(fast_mandelbrot_plot)  # random
    <IPython.utils._signatures.Signature object at 0x7f3ec8274e10>
"""
```

I think that should go under a new `TESTS::` block, since it's verifying some internal detail that a user reading the reference manual won't care about.

I haven't timed this particular one in Cython but at least in plain Python `try: except:` is faster than doing the attribute access a second time.
