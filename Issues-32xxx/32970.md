I think you can avoid the coercion entirely by returning `x**0`. It looks 3-4x faster on my machine.

Yeah, `x.parent().one()` does the same thing should skip the intermediate exponentiation method.

the only alternative is to use `parent(x)`, as x can be an int, with no parent method.

and the the "parent" may not have any `one` method..

It's the most pedagogically correct option, and avoids the `parent()` issues. Anything that you can feed into a polynomial, by definition, should support a zeroth power that gives the corresponding \"one.\"",
