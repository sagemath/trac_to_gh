Yeah, `x.parent().one()` does the same thing should skip the intermediate exponentiation method.

It's the most pedagogically correct option, and avoids the `parent()` issues. Anything that you can feed into a polynomial, by definition, should support a zeroth power that gives the corresponding \"one.\"",
