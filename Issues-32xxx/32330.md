In coding theory, the most common metric is the Hamming metric. However, codes in the rank metric have been introduced in Sage 9.1 last year, and have gained a large interest for their use in network coding, and in cryptography for instance.

This ticket implements the rank metric analogue of the `channels.StaticErrorRateChannel`, i.e. a channel which creates an error of specific rank in each transmitted message.
