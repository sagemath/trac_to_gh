Most substantial code in `sage.groups` depends on `libgap`, so `sage.groups` will not be used in small distributions such as **sagemath-categories** and **sagemath-polyhedra**.

We introduce a `Feature` for use in `# optional` annotations for doctests that use groups as examples.

We add these annotations in some modules of `sage.structure` and `sage.graphs`.
