`palp` is a standard package, but with modularization that does not mean that everyone has it. In particular, **sagemath-polyhedra** (#32432) will not ship it.

We add a feature test along the lines of the palp `spkg-configure.m4` script and mark many doctests in `sage.geometry` as `# optional - palp`.

To help construct doctest examples without having to rely on `palp`, we endow several classes with `_sage_input_` methods.

As a cosmetic change, nef-partitions now use a unicode symbol.

```
-            Nef-partition {0, 1, 3} U {2, 4, 5}
+            Nef-partition {0, 1, 3} âŠ” {2, 4, 5}
```

We also add feature tests for `polytopes_db`, `polytopes_db_4d`.

My random guess is that modules for toric varieties will mostly stop working as well and again it would make much more sense to mark those modules as dependent on PALP and not each line.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Thanks for the feedback. I wouldn't go so far as to call the module useless. The explicit interaction of the polytope with a lattice in this class is valuable design and code that is not tied to the choice of PALP as a backend.

There is a lot of duplication / proliferation of incompatible variants among `sage.geometry.lattice_polytope`, `sage.geometry.polyhedron.ppl_lattice_polytope`, `sage.geometry.polyhedron` that is calling for refactoring. To mark which lines of `lattice_polytope` actually depend on `palp` (about 1/3 of the `sage:` lines in this file) was a first step to inform possible such refactoring steps.

Many of the `# optional` markings in tests for `NefPartition` could be avoided by constructing the example explicitly instead of using 

```
        sage: o = lattice_polytope.cross_polytope(3)
        sage: np = o.nef_partitions()[0]; np                                    # optional - palp
```
repeatedly. Would this be agreeable?
