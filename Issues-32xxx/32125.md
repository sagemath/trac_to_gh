```
sage: R.<t> = ZZ[]
sage: sigma = R.hom([t+1])
sage: S.<x> = R['x',sigma]
sage: set([S.random_element(degree=(2, 4)).degree() for _ in range(1000)])
{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1 }
```

The degree should be between 2 and 4, in this example. The implementation does not check that the leading coefficient of the randomly generated polynomial is non-zero.

Well, I agree that it's a bit disturbing but this behaviour is documented:

```        
    When ``monic`` is ``False``, the returned Ore polynomial may have
    a degree less than ``degree`` (it happens when the random leading
    coefficient is zero). However, if ``monic`` is ``True``, this
    cannot happen::
```

I remember that I chose this behaviour to be consistent with classical polynomials at the time. But meanwhile, it seems that the behaviour for usual polynomials has changed; so maybe, we also need to change it here.

OK, I've made the modification.

However, I'm not completely satisfied with this because `S.random_element()` now returns zero very often.

Indeed. What would you suggest to do instead? We could keep the default parameter `2` instead of `(-1,2)` maybe. My assumption was that the changes would be backward compatible, so I am surprised some of the doctests need to be adjusted.
