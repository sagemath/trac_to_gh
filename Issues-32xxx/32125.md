sage: R.<t> = ZZ[]

sage: set([S.random_element(degree=(2, 4)).degree() for _ in range(1000)])

```

The degree should be between 2 and 4, in this example. The implementation does not check that the leading coefficient of the randomly generated polynomial is non-zero.

Well, I agree that it's a bit disturbing but this behaviour is documented:

```        
    When ``monic`` is ``False``, the returned Ore polynomial may have
    a degree less than ``degree`` (it happens when the random leading
    coefficient is zero). However, if ``monic`` is ``True``, this
    cannot happen::
```

I remember that I chose this behaviour to be consistent with classical polynomials at the time. But meanwhile, it seems that the behaviour for usual polynomials has changed; so maybe, we also need to change it here.

Indeed. What would you suggest to do instead? We could keep the default parameter `2` instead of `(-1,2)` maybe. My assumption was that the changes would be backward compatible, so I am surprised some of the doctests need to be adjusted.

That's just because the doctests were failing when the picked random polynomial vanishes (so there was a bug in the doctest). And now, it's often the case (so I saw the bug and could fix it).
