... in order to define matrix spaces backed by numpy arrays of various types
https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.scalars.html#signed-integer-types

For `ZZ`, this could for example provide a separate element implementation that is never used for arithmetic, but is good enough for creating matrices in methods such as `vertex_adjacency_matrix` (#32666)

<a id='comment:16'></a>Ah, I see. Thank you. This is essentially a positive review. One little change I saw when reading it over (a while-we-are-at-it):

In `matrix_numpy_dense` `is_symmetric()`:

```diff
-        The tolerance inequality is strict:
+        The tolerance inequality is strict::
+
             sage: m.is_symmetric(tol=0.1)
