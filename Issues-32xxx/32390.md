Just downloading something from some url and installling it is something, I would want to be notified about. I think it is opt-in and not opt-out.

(I opted in, but I still think this is a choice, a user has to make.)

it's checking the checksums.
Why would you trust Sage mirrors more - do you think that 
our checksums are not secure?
