Just downloading something from some url and installling it is something, I would want to be notified about. I think it is opt-in and not opt-out.

it's checking the checksums.

Replying to [John Palmieri](#comment%3A12):
> Regarding "Just downloading something from some url and installing it is something, I would want to be notified about", I think that occasionally we miss a package and so this happens anyway.

Yes, we have a GH Actions workflow (`release_dist`) that checks that at least all standard packages exist on the mirror (because `make dist` downloads them all and puts them in the sdist tarball). We do not have such a check for optional packages.
