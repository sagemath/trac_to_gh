Just downloading something from some url and installling it is something, I would want to be notified about. I think it is opt-in and not opt-out.

it's checking the checksums.
Why would you trust Sage mirrors more - do you think that 
our checksums are not secure?

Yes, we have a GH Actions workflow (`release_dist`) that checks that at least all standard packages exist on the mirror (because `make dist` downloads them all and puts them in the sdist tarball). We do not have such a check for optional packages.
