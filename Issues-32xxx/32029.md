SymPy's `TensorSymmetry` (https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/tensor/tensor.html) uses a trick to represent (monoterm) tensor symmetries and antisymmetries as permutation groups: Two extra elements (in the example below, 3 and 4) keep track of the sign

```
sage: TensorSymmetry.fully_symmetric(3)                                                                                               
TensorSymmetry((0, 1), ((4)(0 1), (4)(1 2)))
sage: TensorSymmetry.fully_symmetric(-3)    # fully antisymmetric 3 indices                                                                                      
TensorSymmetry((0, 1), ((0 1)(3 4), (1 2)(3 4)))
```
The 2-cycle (3 4) represents the antisymmetry. What is displayed there is the "base and strong generating system".

This trick can of course be generalized to Mathematica's "phased permutation groups" (#30276) by using longer cycles.

We define a class `TensorSymmetryGroup`
- which can be initialized from `sage.tensor` `sym` and `antisym` lists
- can convert to/from `sympy.tensor.tensor.TensorSymmetry`
- defines `_get_action_` for acting on tensor modules / components

I'd rather see it as a group, and yes, it's perfectly possible in Sage to compute a strong generating set and a base, given a permutation group.
E.g. one can use the corresponding GAP [functionality](https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap43.html#X7C7EA55C80E457FA) via libgap.

Sorry, what are you referring to?

The example lines on the ticket description using SymPy show the output of SymPy's `TensorSymmetry` constructor, which happens to show the BSGS.

In the branch attached here, the input is a symmetry specification in the style of `sage.tensor`.
