We handled ECL by itself in #29617, so now maxima needs its own ticket.

This would actually be "easy" at this point if not for our custom `matrixexp.patch` (https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2596/).


Depends on #33718

Maxima is packaged for Cygwin as "maxima",
perhaps add a `distros/cygwin.txt` file?

Or that can be a separate ticket.

Would it be hard to support system maxima compiled with sbcl if available? It seems to be ~ 5-6 times faster than maxima on ecl (at least the time it takes to run the testsuite) and it is also more available in general.

For the command line interface, it seems to me setting MAXIMA to "maxima" instead of "maxima -l ecl" would work (btw: why eliminate the config option MAXIMA and hardcode "maxima -l ecl" everywhere instead of just changing MAXIMA in a single place?)

For the library interface I don't know if it is possible to compile `maxima.fas` for sbcl; system packages for maxima that are usually compiled for sbcl don't include the library.

Sadly it's not possible. Sage interfaces with maxima at a very low level through ECL; see`sage/libs/ecl.pyx` and `sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py`.


> For the command line interface, it seems to me setting MAXIMA to "maxima" instead of "maxima -l ecl" would work (btw: why eliminate the config option MAXIMA and hardcode "maxima -l ecl" everywhere instead of just changing MAXIMA in a single place?)

Given that we need ECL maxima for Sage, there aren't any other good values for that variable. The `-l ecl` is necessary to support system installations of maxima with (for example) both SBCL and ECL, where running just "maxima" would run it with SBCL. And the `-l ecl` flag doesn't do any harm with the maxima SPKG, because we know that the SPKG is built with ECL. The executable name "maxima" is standard and `PATH` manipulations in the sage build system ensure that the correct one gets used, so you're almost forced to have `MAXIMA="maxima -l ecl"`.

With that in mind, removing the variable eliminates a "configurable" option that isn't actually configurable in practice, and also gets rid of a tiny bit of coupling between modules.

> For the library interface I don't know if it is possible to compile `maxima.fas` for sbcl; system packages for maxima that are usually compiled for sbcl don't include the library.

No, until very recently even the ability to create an ECL library required a custom patch. That patch has finally been accepted upstream, but I don't think anything similar is possible with the other lisp implementations. (Sage is married to ECL for the moment either way.)

Adding to mjo's answer: for the expect-based interface, it may be doable to use SBCL. There are peculiarities in the way the stdin/stdout character streams are driven in different LISPs that may interfere with a simple drop-in replacement.

The main use in sage now, however, is through maxima_lib which is really using that the E in ECL means "embeddable": we link in the ecl, start it through its binary interface, and then instruct it to load maxima.fas. Our interfacing is using an ABI, not I/O streams, and we directly access the memory objects that ECL constructs to translate them to python (or leave them wrapped). I'm pretty sure this is all fundamentally impossible with SBCL. We are getting huge latency and efficiency gains through the ABI interface compared to I/O, so in many cases I suspect we can afford slower execution in ECL, and I think we don't want to go back to expect-based interfaces.

I tried it (using sbcl maxima for the binary but maxima-ecl for maxima_lib) and I think it worked ok (as in: doctests passed).

In theory it may be possible (see http://www.sbcl.org/manual/#Calling-Lisp-From-C) although it might be a lot of work. The speed gains could be considerable for that part of sage, I don't know if it's overall worth the trouble.

What is wrong with just running `maxima` and use whatever is the system default?

In void linux we use system maxima which defaults to `sbcl` and there's no issue at all (it only needs a tiny patch due to numerical unstability on 32 bit sbcl: https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/sagemath/patches/09-doctest_numerical_fix.patch).

In principle maxima is 5-6 times faster on sbcl than on ecl, although I don't know how much this affects sage.

Anyway, even if there are good reasons to default to `maxima -l ecl`, I think it's better that `sage_conf.MAXIMA` contains the whole command that runs maxima so it's easy to change to just `maxima` if one whishes so.

We already use ECL for the maxima library interface, so there's probably some efficiency to not loading both SBCL and ECL.  But really we should be trying to get rid of the pexpect interface entirely if efficiency is the goal (#30097).

If for example maxima is built supporting both gcl and ecl, and if using gcl causes the test suite to fail, it'd be nice if sage used the known-good ecl on that machine.

I'm systematically testing sage with maxima-sbcl and it works ok save that tiny patch (it's a really tiny unstability in the fifth digit of the **error bound** for a numerical integral).

> I don't feel strongly about it: on Gentoo we could force the problematic lisps to be disabled in maxima when sage is installed. Binary distros could theoretically run into trouble, but they're probably all using SBCL or ECL anyways, and one patch isn't too bad if they want the test suite to pass.

Why not have the configure script tests for `maxima -l ecl` working (as before) and if so set `MAXIMA="maxima -l ecl"` in `sage_conf.py`. This way nothing really changes when using system maxima via configure but distro packages can use whatever works better for `MAXIMA`.

I should point out that maxima-sbcl, by default, will NOT use gmp for arithmetic, but some slow quadratic implementation. That will make the test in `src/sage/interfaces/maxima.py:630` to take a very long time. To test this:

```
$ maxima -q --batch-string='showtime : true $ a : 10^(10^5) $ b : a^600 $'
(%i1) showtime:true
Evaluation took 0.0000 seconds (0.0000 elapsed) using 0 bytes.
(%i2) a:10^10^5
Evaluation took 0.0004 seconds (0.0000 elapsed) using 7.797 KB.
(%i3) b:a^600
Evaluation took 0.8037 seconds (0.8060 elapsed) using 23.760 MB.
```
This will take a very long time if arithmetic is slow. See: https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/issues/34849.

This is the main reason why I think keeping the default to `maxima -l ecl` might be easier. Unless you want to run the command above with a timeout in spkg-configure and complain if the timeout triggers.

BTW, could you add my tiny patch from https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/sagemath/patches/09-doctest_numerical_fix.patch to your branch? It's a numerical integration, the answer is exactly the same, but the error bound is sligthly different in the `e-15` digit.

In debian, there's a package `maxima` which ships a binary `maxima` (using gcl) and a package `maxima-sage` which ships a binary `maxima-sage` (using ecl) together with `maxima.fas`, so just running `maxima -l ecl` fails but `maxima-sage -l ecl` works. I didn't compile sage in debian so I don't know if maxima-gcl would work ok with sage.

Also, the location of `maxima.fas` in `maxima-sage` is not correct so `ecl --eval "(require 'maxima)" --eval "(quit)"` fails, but `ecl --eval "(require 'maxima \"/usr/lib/ecl/maxima.fas\")" --eval "(quit)"` works.

This is from a very quick test using `docker run --security-opt seccomp=unconfined -it debian:latest` (beware maxima doesn't run in docker without the seccomp option).

A priori I consider this a packaging issue and not one that we need to worry about in sage. If a distro supplies a slow maxima... maxima will be slow. It still works though, and I see from the void bug that workarounds are available.

However: the point of that test was actually to test a memory limit, in #6772. The corresponding code is,

```python
# Remove limit on the max heapsize (since otherwise it defaults                                                                                                      
# to 256MB with ECL).                                                                                                                                                
self._sendline(":lisp (ext:set-limit 'ext:heap-size 0)")
```

At least on my machine, the corresponding (default) limit is 4G, and that line of (ECL specific) code is not needed any longer. Can we just remove it along with the test? 256M is not a serious concern in 2022.


> BTW, could you add my tiny patch from https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/sagemath/patches/09-doctest_numerical_fix.patch to your branch? It's a numerical integration, the answer is exactly the same, but the error bound is sligthly different in the `e-15` digit.

I don't see much value in it, but `MAXIMA` already comes from `sage.env`, so we could accomplish the same thing by renaming that variable to `SAGE_MAXIMA_COMMAND`.

More generally I think we're better off keeping the `sage_conf` values closer to what autotools detects, so that e.g. `MAXIMA` is the path of the "maxima" executable that was found. A path is more useful when you want to call something like `subprocess.run`, or any of the path-specific methods.

Fair enough. The workaround is simple (and probably I should submit it upstream).

Did you try in 32 bits? The limit seems to be 1G. Anyway, the point of setting heap-size to 0 is to forget about the limit, since my computer has 32G > 4G. Indeed (64 bit void linux where ecl default heap limit is 4G):

```
$ time maxima -l ecl -q --batch-string='showtime : true $ a : 10^(10^5) $ b : a^20000 $'

;;; Loading #P"/usr/lib64/ecl-21.2.1/sockets.fas"

Evaluation took 0.0000 seconds (0.0000 elapsed)
(%i2) a:10^10^5
Evaluation took 0.0010 seconds (0.0010 elapsed)
(%i3) b:a^20000
Maxima encountered a Lisp error:

 Memory limit reached. Please jump to an outer pointer, quit program and enlarge the
memory limits before executing the program again.

Automatically continuing.
To enable the Lisp debugger set *debugger-hook* to nil.

real	0m51.739s
user	0m50.231s
sys	0m1.031s
```

However setting heap-size to 0:

```
$ time maxima -l ecl -q --batch-string=":lisp (ext:set-limit 'ext:heap-size 0)
showtime : true $ a : 10^(10^5) $ b : a^20000 $"

real	1m45.805s
user	1m42.147s
sys	0m2.826s
```

For the sake of comparing with maxima/sbcl:

```
$ time maxima -q --batch-string='showtime : true $ a : 10^(10^5) $ b : a^20000 $'
(%i1) showtime:true
Evaluation took 0.0000 seconds (0.0010 elapsed) using 0 bytes.

(%i3) b:a^20000
Evaluation took 41.2510 seconds (41.5055 elapsed) using 792.009 MB.

real	0m41.704s
user	0m39.644s

```

In the same spirit as your comment about slow maxima, maybe this should be patched in maxima itself, i.e. add `(ext:set-limit 'ext:heap-size 0)` to its initialization code for ECL, rather than have sage poke at this. It seems nicer if the lisp differences are abstracted out by maxima itself as much as possible.

I have no idea. This works just fine in my distro packages and when building this branch from source locally (which picks up system maxima). I suppose it's some docker weirdness, and adding an additional check to spkg-configure won't fix anything since the check will pass.

Ok, thanks. Matthias, how do you think we should proceed? Ignore the docker-only errors and try to fix them in another ticket? Try the spkg-configure check?
