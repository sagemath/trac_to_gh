Currently we have the following:

```
sage: M0 = ModularForms(Gamma0(8), 10)
sage: M1 = ModularForms(Gamma1(8), 10)
sage: M1.has_coerce_map_from(M0)
True
sage: f = M0.0; g = M1.0
sage: f + g
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for +: 'Modular Forms space of dimension 11 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(8) of weight 10 over Rational Field' and 'Modular Forms space of dimension 21 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma1(8) of weight 10 over Rational Field'
```

Moreover:

```
sage: M1(f)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: entries must be a list of length 21
```

The goal of this ticket is to fix these issues. The origin of the present ticket is from #31559.

In `_element_constructor_`, you can safely remove the test

```
if x.parent() is self:
    return x
```
The above is taken care of by `Parent.__call__` (which delegates the call to `_element_constructor_` when it is needed).
