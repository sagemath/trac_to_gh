```
Here are the steps to reproduce:

- start Sage in a terminal
- run a Sage command involving fricas, e.g.
   `sage: integrate(sin(x),x,0,1,algorithm='fricas')`
- in another terminal, track the evolution of fricas process : 
   `ps -eo pid,ppid,pcpu,comm | grep FRICAS`
- if you quit Sage with `exit` or `CTRL+D`, you get a message `Exiting FriCAS with PID ...` and fricas process terminates, great.
- if instead you close the terminal running Sage, you see that the fricas process gets daemonized (its parent becomes `PID 1`), and its CPU usage inreases and heats your computer.

I can reproduce it consistently, with the procedure above. I am using Debian buster GNU/Linux 64bits.

However, i am on the commit 7eeb80c9e1b4e656e0616d157fbc16b31f94ba52 which installs fricas 1.3.7.p1.
