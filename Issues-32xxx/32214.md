There is one thing I'd briefly like to discuss: The representation strings introduced and modified here start with `X-Monoid ...`, where `X` is the name of the corresponding element class. If we are unifying all of these, I think that the same should hold for `OTermMonoid._repr_`, which should produce a string starting with `OTerm-Monoid`, instead of the current `O-Term Monoid`.

Other than that, these changes LGTM.
