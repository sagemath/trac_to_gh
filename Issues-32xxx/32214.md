I am against this change. I think there are two ways to write the monoids, either `X-Monoid` where `X` is a class name or a more verbose name if possible, which is the case for `O-Term Monoid` (and also for `B-Term Monoid` on #31933.

We could, if we like, however unify the dashs by writing `GenericTerm Monoid` etc (without dash), but I do not have a strong preference for doing this.
