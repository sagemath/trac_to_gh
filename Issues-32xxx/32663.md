<a id='comment:6'></a>Looks good, but there are a couple of open questions:

How about

```diff
-if a == -QQ((1, 2))
+if a == QQ((-1, 2))
```

```diff
-        return (z**a / (sqrt(pi) * 2**a * gamma(a + Integer(3) / Integer(2))) - struve_H(a + 1, z) + struve_H(a - 1, z)) / 2
+        return (z**a / (sqrt(pi) * 2**a * gamma(a + QQ((3, 2))) - struve_H(a + 1, z) + struve_H(a - 1, z)) / 2
```

This is at lines 1217 etc. The next location at 1386etc has the same code mostly, but here you decide to approach it differently and leave the import of `QQ` the old position and proceed with `Integer(1) / 2` etc.

Both solutions seem fine, but I find it strange that they are different for the same thing.
