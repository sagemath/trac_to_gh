`sudo make distclean` is a scary operation, perhaps you just wanted `sudo rm -rf local/`?

As `make distclean` can run `./config.status --recheck`, this may create root-owned files in the source directory.

It is still the case that after doing `export SAGE_SUDO="sudo -E"`, then `pip` fails to build.
