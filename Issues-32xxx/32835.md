Using the prefix-suffix decompositions one can compute the set of factors of a primitive morphic word in close to optimal time. Only checking redundancy of the factors is a subtle task. An efficient way to store the associated language would be to use something similar to the `sage.combinat.words.suffix_trees.SuffixTree`.

Note : this is already partly availaible in `sage.combinat.words.morphism.WordMorphism.language`.
