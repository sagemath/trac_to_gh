This is a precursor to #30680, laying out the framework for finitely presented modules over graded connected algebras. #30680 will focus on the case of the Steenrod algebra, with specific applications in mind.

I will quote from the TODO list in the forthcoming `__init__.py`:

1. Why do we need to define `__bool__` and `__eq__` in element.py? They should be taken care of automatically, once we define `__nonzero__`.
2. inhheritance: free modules, elements, etc., should perhaps inherit from fp versions, or maybe both should inherit from generic classes, to consolidate some methods (like degree, `_repr_`, others?)
3. Test with graded modules over other graded rings. (Should be okay, but add some doctests.)
In `__classcall__/__init__` for FP_Modules, allow as input a free module or a morphism of free modules? Or just leave it as is, with methods in `FP_Modules`, morphisms, and free modules for these constructions. (See the pre-existing `FP_Modules.from_free_module` etc., and also new methods `morphism.to_fp_module()` and `free_module.to_fp_module()`.)

Question 1 is bugging me the most: I get doctest failures if I don't define `__bool__` and `__eq__`, but according to `structure/element.pyx`, I shouldn't have to do this: the documentation there for `__nonzero__` says:

```
        Note that this is automatically called when converting to
        boolean, as in the conditional of an if or while statement.
```
which really sounds like I shouldn't have to define `__bool__`.

Thank you for separating this ticket out. It will make it easier to focus on the general functionality here. I finally have gotten back around to this. Sorry it took so long (but I have now finally moved to Japan).

I think we should change the name `FP_Element` and similar to `FPElement` to match PEP8.

There are many places where `TESTS:` should be `TESTS::`.

Let's get rid of the `is_FreeGradedModuleHomspace` and just replace it with the `isinstance` call.

I don't like the name `free_element()`. Perhaps `free_module_representative()`?

The mathematical description does not quite seem to match the implementation. Your basis elements are not a basis over the `F`-algebra `A` but over `F`. This needs to be **very** carefully explained in the documentation.

I think more things should be using the category framework (unless this becomes a significant bottleneck in #30680) Mainly I am looking at `degree()` by using `degree_on_basis`, but there is a mismatch with what this is a module over. Actually, this is more like the `cartesian_product` with some additional functionality. I might need to think a bit more about how this will all fit together.

To utilize the `degree()` from the category framework, we only need to implement a `degree_on_basis()` method in the parent. This would mean less repeated code, although it might be slightly slower in the computation. Of course, the current version works and is fine to do things this way.

We also don't need the `__nonzero__` anymore because `__bool__` is Python3.

    "body": "<a id='comment:11'></a>\nFirst, `FreeGradedModule` is indeed an honest free module, and I think it should be okay to use `CombinatorialFreeModule` for it. The \"basis\" in this case is explicitly the basis as a module over `algebra`; it is not a vector space basis.

First, `FreeGradedModule` is indeed an honest free module, and I think it should be okay to use `CombinatorialFreeModule` for it. The "basis" in this case is explicitly the basis as a module over `algebra`; it is not a vector space basis. As a result, the `degree_on_basis()` setup won't work, because it assumes that you're working with graded modules over an ungraded ring, and so it doesn't take into account the possible degree of the coefficients. At least that's my reading of the [homogeneous_degree method](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/categories/filtered_modules_with_basis.py#n709) in `categories/filtered_modules_with_basis.py`.

I don't really see how using Cartesian products will help: A<sup>k</sup> is just a free module, so we should be able to use the free module class for it. I don't think the code will use the projection and inclusion maps that are provided by the Cartesian product class.

`FPModule` is trickier: it is not free as a module over `algebra`, but of course it is free over the ground field. I don't know of a suitable class in Sage for it, but `CombinatorialFreeModule` kind of works.

It's a good idea to maybe cache `dense_coefficient_list` for these elements, and maybe while we're at it, give the method for this class of elements a different name.

If we are going to cache it, then we might as well only store that and reimplement the module structure following my proposal at the end of in [comment:10](#comment%3A10). IIRC, it is faster to go from the dense list to the indexed free module element than the other way around.

First, it is unfortunate that these are not the same, but that's not something to be fixed here. What differences does it make in this particular case to use `GradedModules(algebra).WithBasis()`?

Re `FPModule`:

> We can weaken this to be a subclass of `IndexedGenerators`, `Module`, and `UniqueRepresentation`, which are the base classes of `CFM` and has mos of the desired features. There might be some features we might want to abstract from `CFM` to some intermediate ABC to also use in this class to remove code duplication. This will probably be the best way forward for `FPModule`.

I'll work on this.

Sorry, I have been a bit busy with my move (Australia -> Japan).

Before this goes to a positive review, there are a number of little code polishing things to take care of:

1. Full doctest coverage (mainly `__init__` with adding a `TestSuite(foo).run()`).
2. Pyflakes
3. There are two `== None` -> `is None` needed.
4. I don't think we should have `0` be displayed as `<>`. I know this is consistent with displaying the other elements, but I think it should just be `0`.
5. The documentation of `degree()` is wrong with the output for `0`.
6. Class docstrings shouldn't have an `OUTPUT:`.
7. Somewhere in the documentation needs to be stated that the module must be finite dimensional (over the algebra `A`). I think the category should also reflect this. It should be possible to remove this limitation, which shouldn't be too hard, but it is there currently.
8. `if len(self.generator_degrees()) == 0:` -> `if not self.generator_degrees():`
9. I am not sure we should use the name `basis_elements` as it is not giving basis elements over `A`, but I can't think of a better name right now. It should be specified that these are basis elements over the base ring `R` of `A` to make this clear. (Note that the direct sum is as additive groups (or `R`-modules), not as `A`-modules.
10. We probably want to state that this code only works for algebras that have a graded distinguished basis.
21. I would want some of the key methods to have doctests that work for other graded algebras. Anything that is of the form `*Sym` is good; same with `NilCoxeter` or `Exterior` (finite dimensional ones) or `Shuffle`.

I will probably also make a pass through this later for some code tweaks and improvements. However, before that, I want to talk a little bit more about the possible optimization in [comment:10](#comment%3A10). Do we have any good ways to check the efficacy of such a change? Mainly, is there a computation that takes a few minutes that heavily uses this code? In terms of memory, it will likely be better because we are not storing the same information twice.

Thanks, Travis. I've addressed most of these. I will add some doctests involving some other algebras like `Exterior`. Regarding your list:

- I added test suites to the various `__init__` methods, and now I'm getting a doctest failure that I have yet to track down. I would be happy for help:

```
File "src/sage/modules/fp_graded/module.py", line 156, in sage.modules.fp_graded.module.FPModule.__init__

        File "sage/structure/element.pyx", line 722, in sage.structure.element.Element._test_category (build/cythonized/sage/structure/element.c:6825)

      ------------------------------------------------------------
      The following tests failed: _test_category
    Failure in _test_elements
    The following tests failed: _test_elements
```
 When I actually run Sage and look at this, I think this is relevant information:

```
sage: from sage.modules.fp_graded.module import FPModule
sage: A3 = SteenrodAlgebra(profile=[4,3,2,1])
sage: M = FPModule(A3, [0,1], [[Sq(2), Sq(1)]])
sage: x = M.an_element()
sage: x.parent().category().element_class
<class 'sage.categories.category.JoinCategory.element_class'>
sage: isinstance(x, x.parent().category().element_class)  # _test_category asserts True
False
```

- "Somewhere in the documentation needs to be stated that the module must be finite dimensional". We say "finitely presented" frequently already, but I've added a bit more. I also added a new category axiom, "FinitelyPresented".

Regarding [comment:10](#comment%3A10) and optimization, I think the followup ticket #30680 will be a good testing ground, since it will use this code heavily.

I am also +1 on changing the print (and latex) representation of elements to have user specified names. We can just use the framework of `IndexedGenerators` to handle the printing. We can also add an option to retain the current printing (as it matches what `FreeModule` does). John, what would `(x + y)*a`, where `x,y` are different basis elements of the algebra `A`, print as? `x*a + y*a` or `(x + y)*a`? Should we add such an option too?

Thanks for figuring that out!

Fixed.

The current code allows for the construction of a finitely presented module from a morphism between two free modules (`mor.to_fp_module()`). That could also be turned into a method for free modules, accepting a morphism and returning an f.p. module.

I have pushed the changes with names (we will want the patchbot to get around to it to see if there are other (almost certainly trivial) doctests breaking across Sage from the internal changes).

I also made a number of other changes and improvements. One important one is I changed the internal representation of basis elements to match the "generic" (i.e., no `names` specified) printing indices. This is the most natural way to associate data to the basis element (IMO the only other natural way would just be to just use {0, ..., k} to index the basis elements). I also directly links the FP module to the free module's indices. This was also very useful for setting up the element printing.

I renamed the `to_fp_module` to `as_fp_module` for modules and `fp_module` for morphisms. If it was `to_fp_module`, I would expect some kind of map to be returned. I wanted the different names both to reflect the English and that modules and morphism are fundamentally different objects.

I have some design questions:

- I think we should have the `FPModule` construction be based on the morphism since that is the data that is actually stored. The `__classcall_private__` would then preparse the input data as needed.
- We should remove the `__contains__` of `FPModule`. I think this is suppressing an issue with comparing elements. Contrast this code with

  ```
  sage: Z4 = Zmod(4)
  sage: Z5 = Zmod(5)
  sage: Z5(3) in Z4
  False
  sage: Z5(3) == Z4(3)
  False
  ```
  which is using the generic `__contains__`. Right now I can't provide any advice on how to fix this as I haven't looked at this too closely yet.

I also have some questions regarding the formatting that are easy enough to fix/change, but I wanted to be set on them before updating the remaining doctests (there will be some trivial failures in the added files):

- What do we want the default prefix to be? Previously it was `g`, but I was thinking `G` to reflect that it should be an element of the module `G`. Pure bikeshedding, and I don't care. I just chose something that I thought was reasonable, but I should poll for other opinions before setting everything.
- How do we want to print when the generator degrees? Right now the unique are `G[0]` and the non-unique are `G(0, 0)` because that was the easiest to do. I can easily change the unique to `G(0)`, and it is also relatively easy to change `G(0, 0)` to, e.g., `G[0,0]`.
- I propose changing the morphism output to match that of ring morphisms:

  ```
  sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
  sage: S.<y> = ZZ[]
  sage: R.hom([y])
  Ring morphism:
    From: Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
    To:   Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Integer Ring
    Defn: x |--> y
  ```
  This is better when there are a lot of elements, it is consistent with other parts of Sage, no tuple-vs-list printing issues, and we likely can take advantage of other morphism display code.

Great, thank you!

Sounds okay to me, but I don't a strong opinion about it.

I'll try it and see what happens, then get back to you.

I think lowercase is better: `g[0]` looks more like an element to me than `G[0]`.

I don't care too much, but I have a slight preference for uniformity: square brackets in both cases?

> - I propose changing the morphism output to match that of ring morphisms:

Yes, sounds good.

I changed `G[0]` to `g[0]` but also changed `G(0, 0)` to `g(0, 0)` — it wasn't clear how to get brackets in the second case. I also changed the print representation for morphisms. I think I fixed all of the doctests, too.

I would be happy for you to take care of this. I ran into problems because I want to use generators and relations as arguments (as is currently done) but then have `__classcall_private__` convert to a morphism and pass that to `__init__`, and I couldn't figure out a clean way to do that. I didn't try that hard, but it seems that `__classcall_private__` and `__init__` should have the same arguments, so they both need `morphism`, `generators`, and `relations`? I guess we could switch to using a factory to construct these modules instead, but I didn't try that.

I removed the `__contains__` method, but I didn't know what you were referring to with "I think this is suppressing an issue with comparing elements."

With elements, it's easy for me to switch to `g(0)` and keep the current `g(0, 0)`, but I can't figure out how to instead switch the second one to `g[0, 0]`.

Otherwise, I'm happy with this.

A factory is overkill. The only thing needed is checking if the `__classcall_private__` input is a morphism or not. Well, I am feeling lazy (forgive me!) and don't really care too much to simplify the input as the current version works albeit somewhat inefficiently since it converts from the morphism data and then reconstructs said morphism. Anyways, this isn't anything that needs to be done right now. If you want to do this, please go ahead.

> I removed the `__contains__` method, but I didn't know what you were referring to with "I think this is suppressing an issue with comparing elements."

I was getting errors for those doctest you removed. Using the default containment, you get this:

```
sage: from sage.modules.fp_graded.module import FPModule
sage: M = FPModule(SteenrodAlgebra(2), [0,1], [[Sq(4), Sq(3)]])
sage: N = FPModule(SteenrodAlgebra(2), [0], [[Sq(2)]])
sage: y = Sq(2) * N.generator(0)
sage: y in M
True
```
which I think is wrong as it is checking this:

```
sage: M(y) == y
True
```
So either it is the equality or the conversion that has a bug (possibly both). Taking another look, the `_element_constructor_` was too permissive in how it was handling elements. I have fixed this, and it seems to resolve other issues I found with testing for this.

> With elements, it's easy for me to switch to `g(0)` and keep the current `g(0, 0)`, but I can't figure out how to instead switch the second one to `g[0, 0]`.

I have done this following what I sketched in [comment:55](#comment%3A55).

> Otherwise, I'm happy with this.

I am too if my changes are good.

I got out of my laziness and added support for taking a morphism input.

I also changed the `FPModule.j` parameter to the hidden `_j`.

Although looking again at the code, I have a few more questions (sorry!):

- With allowing both input formats, do we need the `from_free_module*` methods? They seem more like clutter to me. I propose to remove them.

- Related, I don't see why we want to create a free `FPModule` (instead of `FreeGradedModule`) in `resolution()`. Likely this is related to having different APIs, where methods likely just need to be added to the free version or perhaps some ABC needs to be created. We might want to even have the `__classcall_private__` redirect to the free module where appropriate.

- Should the `FPModule` belong to the category of `ModulesWithBasis`? I don't think this is guaranteed (over the base algebra). See also the comment below.

- I don't agree with the comment before `FPModule` "vector spaces" is ill-defined (in particular, we don't require the base ring of the base algebra to be a field). This can be corrected fairly easily. However, I propose removing this as it doesn't contribute anything to (understanding) the code.

Replying to [tscrim](#comment%3A65):

Great, thanks! I also added code to allow a free module as input, in which case it would return a finitely presented module with no relations. We can revisit this based on how we want to handle your question below about `resolution`.

> I also changed the `FPModule.j` parameter to the hidden `_j`.

Good, makes sense.

> - With allowing both input formats, do we need the `from_free_module*` methods? They seem more like clutter to me. I propose to remove them.

Done.
 
> - Related, I don't see why we want to create a free `FPModule` (instead of `FreeGradedModule`) in `resolution()`. Likely this is related to having different APIs, where methods likely just need to be added to the free version or perhaps some ABC needs to be created.

Good question. Comments from the original authors? Why not just use free modules in `resolution`?

I replaced it with another comment, pointing out that some of the methods assume that there is a vector space structure and a chosen basis.

I took this a bit further and made everything in the resolution a `FreeGradedModule`. As I suspected, there were some compatibility issues to sort out, but I took care of all of the ones that came up in doctests (and a few others I saw along the way). There might be a few others (which will show up as missing methods), but we can fix them as we come across them.

Towards this, I made the free module morphism/homspace a subclass of the respective non-free version. This required some slight workaround, but the code is much cleaner IMO because there are no duplicated methods and the subclassing makes mathematical sense.

I tweaked the documentation to say "free module" basically everywhere we use "vector space" because we are not using the field properties AFAICS.

As of right now, I am happy with the code. Please check my changes. If they are good, then go ahead and set a positive review.

Replying to [jhpalmieri](#comment%3A78):
> I saw that you replaced `PlusInfinity()` with `infinity`, so I made the same change a few other places.

Indeed, this is a micro-optimization since they are the same object, but `infinity` is already created (and nailed in memory).

> I also removed a "todo" about dealing with finite dimensionality rather than just finiteness, handling it the same way we did elsewhere in the code.

Thank you. I had made that note for myself, but I forgot about it.

> If someone gets motivated (on another ticket), they can try to handle the case where `self.base_ring().dimension()` is not defined.

I concur.

Thank you.
