We have an `Ideal_fractional` parent class, but the most important type of fractional ideals in Sage (namely, for number fields) does not inherit from it. Let's change this, so that we can reliably distinguish fractional ideals from ideals.

(I haven't found any other fractional ideals in Sage that are not already children of `Ideal_fractional`.)

This patch should result in absolutely no change in behaviour, except that `isinstance(I, Ideal_fractional)` now returns `True` when `I` is a `NumberFieldFractionalIdeal`.

Keywords: **number fields, fractional ideals**

Failed example:

Got:

So some functionality is apparently changed for something that did not work before but now gives a result. Seems like a good thing.
