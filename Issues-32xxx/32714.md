On WSL you sometimes hit a strange "Permission denied" error while building other packages (always during copying of the dist-info file). There are some discussions online (like https://github.com/pypa/packaging-problems/issues/258) and a few workarounds. The only thing that worked for me is no use a folder under the sage directory for building by setting `SAGE_BUILD_DIR`. So I've added this to the documentation in case someone else also encounters this error.

By the way, is it by design that the other sage packages like sage_conf ignore `SAGE_BUILD_DIR`? Same question for the docbuild.

Good suggestion! I tried it and confirmed it worked as well. Changed the docs accordingly now.

sage-conf etc are still not working, since they seem to respect neither prefix nor build dir. But that's something for another ticket.

No. `--prefix` sets the `SAGE_LOCAL` directory. You can delete everything but this directory and have a working Sage.

Its subdirectory, `SAGE_LOCAL/var/tmp/sage/build` is used for temporary files during the build.

What I am saying is, we should give users on WSL the advice to create the installation hierarchy (`SAGE_LOCAL`) in a WSL directory, not a /mnt directory.
This should be general advice for from source installs in WSL; not troubleshooting advice ("how to fix a problem").

I understood this, but thought I edited the "developer" guide where you would treat this as only as a semi-temporary build output and not as a valid installation that you try to keep. Will change that later.
