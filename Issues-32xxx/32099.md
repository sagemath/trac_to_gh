In #31921 the location for the file-cache of the KnotInfo databases has been changed from `$SAGE_LOCAL` to `$DOT_SAGE`. Unfortunately this change has not been performed with respect to cleaning on version updates. This will be fixed here.

Furthermore, an upgrade to the official release 2021.9.1 of the PyPI-package will be done.

The original databases on the [KnotInfo](https://knotinfo.math.indiana.edu/) web-page are developed under continuous flow. In order to keep track with that I've installed a [cronjob](https://github.com/soehms/database_knotinfo/blob/main/.github/workflows/check_version_changed.yml) that looks for differences and creates new releases if necessary. This is done once a month. The version numbers correspond to the date giving the next differences. The first such release was [2021.7.21](https://pypi.org/project/database-knotinfo/2021.7.21/).

This upgrade just puts Sage on that release. It does not effect any functionality. As far as I've seen, the major difference to the former release is the addition of 2 new columns for proper links (`'arf_invariant': 'Arf Invariant'`, `'topological_four_genus': 'Genus-4D (Top.)'`).

Indeed not. This was possibly overlooked as of non consequence on a multi-user install because it would only apply to the installing user's `DOT_SAGE`. But if cleaning is needed, it has to be done at runtime when the user starts sage or the specific functionality.

This is not a good solution - let's please not re-introduce uses of `sage.misc.package` - this is specific to sage-the-distribution.

I would suggest to instead query the version of the installed Python package using standard Python means: 
- either using a variable that your Python package `database_knotinfo` provides for this purpose
- or using `importlib.metadata` https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html

After an inspection of the log-files being attached to the `tox-optional` workflow run mentioned in [comment 15](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32099#comment:15) (for example the [one for ubunto focal](https://github.com/soehms/sage/runs/3040930473?check_suite_focus=true)) I realized that a couple of dependencies to standard `spkg` being necassary to have the doctests of `spkg-check.in` pass successfully during a clean build, were missing.

I've added these and started the [workflow](https://github.com/soehms/sage/actions/runs/1044132433) again.


I suspect that the problem which has been reported in [comment 17](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32099#comment:17) is related to that and should be fixed, now.

BTW: Is it intended that the jobs of `tox-optional` are marked green even though `spkg-check.in` failed?

The current commit is independent on that. Again, it just switches to a new version number format (see [issue 2 on GitHub](https://github.com/soehms/database_knotinfo/issues/2)).

This is not stable: I reran the same command and got different errors:

```
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/knots/knotinfo.py  # 232 doctests failed
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/features/databases.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/knots/link.py  # 2 doctests failed
```

My guess is that what is happening here is that creating the cache is not safe for parallel doctesting. You may want to make this step atomic.
