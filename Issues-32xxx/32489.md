As part of #31420 (Meta-ticket: Review/remove monkey patching in `src/sage/__init__.py`), we move the definition of `load_ipython_extension` (introduced in #18726) to `sage.repl.__init__`

This function was defined in module `sage` so that `%load_ext sage` works (see http://www.slabbe.org/blogue/categorie/ipython/). After the move, this would have to be `%load_ext sage.repl`; but we patch it into the module `sage` upon import of `sage.repl` to keep `%load_ext sage` as well (at least after `import sage.all` or `import sage.repl`).

In a follow up ticket we may also want to define the corresponding function that will make `%unload_ext sage` work
