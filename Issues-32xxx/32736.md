According to the documentation, the matrices returned by the `LU` method have coefficients in the fraction field of the input's base ring.

However, it is not actually the case:

```
sage: M = Matrix(FiniteField(11), [[2,3],[4,5]])
sage: P, L, U = M.LU()
sage: P.base_ring()
Integer Ring
``` 

This can lead to the following consecuences:

```
sage: M*P.inverse()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for *: 'Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Finite Field of size 11' and 'Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 sparse matrices over Rational Field'
```

This happens because the inverse of `P` has coefficients in the rationals, and they cannot be coerced into finite fields.

The inverse of an integer matrix will, in general have coefficients in the rationals. Only when the determinant is 1 or -1 will be integers. I think it is important to keep the contract that the parent of the output depends only on the parent of the input.

The group GL(n,ZZ) only contains matrices that have determinant +-1. That's why computing an inverse there works. Mathematically, using GL(n,ZZ) is a perfectly fine solution, but there may be performance penaltieswe might need to consider.

Dima's comment is spot-on as well: we could use GO(n,ZZ), which could lead to a more efficient inverse routine. Same reservations about overhead of instantiating the parent, though.

As the implementation of inverse on matrix groups over ZZ shows, the routine that actually gets used in "inverse_of_unit", which is available on matrices over ZZ in general.

So the problem in the code above can already be solved by using

```
M*P.inverse_of_unit()
```
(and `M*P.T` would work too, by Dima's comment)

So I think this ticket can be resolved by fixing the documentation of LU and perhaps including a pointer that `inverse` may lead to inadvertent base ring changes, which can be avoided with `inverse_of_unit`.
