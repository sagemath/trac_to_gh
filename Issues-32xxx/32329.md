If I explicitly pass `algorithm='giac'`, I get the answer, but without it, it hangs until I interrupt it:

```

sage: bxp = ((2 - cos(3*t))*cos(t)).diff(t)

hmmm. Are you sure it hangs when calling giac ?

- fricas gives 0

- sympy takes a long times and then ?

It definitely makes a call to giac because if I just run without specifying the algorithm, when I quite sage it exists saying quiting giac. It isn't so much the call to giac but the no specified algorithm case that is hanging somewhere. I would feel better even if there was a trace back, but there is none.

I have added a print in the code and we see something.

Stuck in maxima integrator after 13 minutes. Control-c-ing stops maxima and immediatly launches giac, which answer immediatly.

```

That shouldn't catch a `KeyboardInterrupt`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html

What is happening is when we do the keyboard interrupt, the maxima integrator is converting that into a `RuntimeError`, which is then caught:

```
sage: integral(k, t, 0, 2*pi, algorithm='maxima')
<ctrl-C>
RuntimeError: ECL says: Console interrupt.

sage: integral(k, t, 0, 2*pi, algorithm='sympy')
<ctrl-C>
KeyboardInterrupt:
```
So perhaps what we can do is check to see if the message contains `"Console interrupt"`? If so, then we just raise the error?

Although I guess I should be slightly happy we have this bug. Otherwise I wouldn't have thought to change the integrator and continue thinking it is just too complicated to do symbolically. So it allows me to write a great example for my class.
