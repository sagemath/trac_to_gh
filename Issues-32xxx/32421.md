This requires writing cmake config script, i.e. `CMakeLists.txt`, as far as I can see.
Integrating this into `spkg-configure.m4` is above my pay grade...

There's a `symengine_version()` C function that you can call to get it.
Or you can use the following program to see if it compiles,

```
#include <symengine/symengine_config.h>
#if (SYMENGINE_MAJOR_VERSION*10000 + SYMENGINE_MINOR_VERSION*100 + SYMENGINE_PATCH_VERSION < 00700)
# error "SymEngine 0.7.0 or newer is required"
error
#endif

Just create a directory `conftest.dir` and generate the file in there
