<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

Some things to work on here:

- need check=True parameter to not do the pcf check since it is time consuming. You claim to raise an error if not pcf, but you do not actually do the check right now


- add to the documentation the definition of postcritical set: The postcritical set is union of points which are in the forward orbits of the critical points. In other words, the set of points `Q` so that `f^n(P) = Q` for some positive integer `n` and critical point `P`, where `f` is this mapping.

- Should say that you extend to the 'field_of_definition_critical()' field.


- OUTPUT rather that OUTPUTS

- OUTPUT: The set of postcritical points.

- only have examples over QQ. Should add a number field and a finite field example

- ('must not be a dynamical system on a subscheme') -> ('must be a dynamical system on projective space') since that is what you check

- postcritical set does not include the critical point unless it is peridoic (i.e., occurs as a forward image)


- Failing example

```
K.<v>=QuadraticField(2)
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(K,1)
f=DynamicalSystem([x^2+(-2)*y^2,y^2])
m=matrix(K,2,2,[v,1,0,1])
g=f.conjugate(m)
g.post_critical_set()
```

- we're likely to run into the same sorting issue on doctest output here that we've seen in some other functions lately.

No idea. The tests run on 8/3 were run on the same commit and passed. I feel like I've seen failures in `blocks` before, but I don't remember where...
