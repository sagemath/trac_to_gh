CBF, i.e. sage/rings/complex_arb.pyx, names functions such as `Ei` impoperly, as `ei`. This in particular makes it impossible to do e.g. `CBF(Ei(I))` (one gets infinite recursion error).

The fix is just to rename them. One can first set aliases `Ei = ei`, etc.,
and deprecate `ei`, and then, after the deprecation period, do the renaming.
