Could there be a slowdown if we need to compute the number of inequalities, say if a polytope was given in terms of its vertices? Do we even want to bother checking if one or both of the representations have been done (and then choose accordingly)?

I will have the same comment on #32150 and #32151.

Yes, there could be a slowdown and especially for something as simple as the pyramid, but not at the moment.

Currently, all polyhedra are immutable and non-interactive and the Vrepresentation and Hrepresentation is always already computed.

With mutable polyhedra (theoretically makes sense with `ppl`, `normaliz` and `polymake`) things will be a bit different. But then just embedding in higher dimension and adding a vertex would be the better approach anyway. So I would propose overwriting the pyramid method in the mutable case anyway.
