```

Ticket #29977 provides a hotfix.
Here we aim for a better fix.

The test used to display `Pi.characters()`,
of type `Sequence`, directly.

The display order for the two characters in this
example changed, possibly due to a change in PARI.

The example was changed in #30801 to use Python sets
in an attempt to fix the display order, but that
failed and patchbots kept failing on that.

Btw, you don't use lists:

sage: f = Newforms(GammaH(25, [6]), 3, names='j')[0]                            
sage: Pi = LocalComponent(f, 5)                                                 
sage: type(Pi.characters())

Then we can calmly investigate what causes the different

I was asking the same question, but I did not see any evidence (i might have missed something though). If the raw use of `Pi.characters()` is only *apparently* unstable, then i am not in favor to work around it, which is why i asked, otherwise we might end up sorting every Sage doctest. If there is a configuration that does not provide that order, which one it is ? If this is about the 32 vs 64 bit architecture, then why not specify it with two dedicated doctests ?

OK, then could you please all try the [straightforward branch](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/log/?h=u/tmonteil/doctests_in_src_sage_modular_local_comp_local_comp_py_make_patchbots_fail) and tell if is passes on your various computers, so that we could see whether it can break and understand the cause (for example, it seems not related to the choice of the random seed).

As #29977 is now positively review, we can now also go back to your branch and see whether this works.

I think we have to let 32bit bots to work on it. I will work on setting one up later in the summer. Let us keep this ticket to "needs review" so that bots can work on it.
