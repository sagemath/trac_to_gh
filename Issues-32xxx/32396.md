Currently, the `abs` operator cannot be applied to scalar fields:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='topological')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: f = M.scalar_field({X: x*y}, name='f', latex_name=r"\Phi")
sage: abs(f)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: bad operand type for abs(): 'ScalarFieldAlgebra_with_category.element_class'
```

In this ticket, we add this feature.
