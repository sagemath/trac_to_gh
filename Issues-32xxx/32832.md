As noted in [#29665 comment:86](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/29665#comment:86), our `cython` spkg uses custom patches:
- https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/build/pkgs/cython/patches

We should investigate whether they are still necessary.

Cython and cypari have patches that work in tandem to address #27267. Neither is really critical IMO, but the patches are not obsolete. The cython patch is a backport from the forthcoming cython-3.0, so we're using a feature from a future release.

That's the other patch, `hash.patch`, also a backport from cython-3.0. It was introduced in #26855 to fix a doctest failure with python3. But if that's all that's affected, we might be able to add `int()` in a few places to avoid the patch until cython-3.0 actually exists.

The trashcan patch shouldn't really be required per [#27267 comment:55](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/27267#comment:55)

That patch/doctest is also blocking an spkg-configure.m4 for cython, so I'll see what I can do about it and post the branch here.
