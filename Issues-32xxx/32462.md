The constructors `Family` and `Set` are intended to construct an immutable `Parent`.

We equip the implementation classes with trivial `__copy__` and `__deepcopy__` methods that just return `self`.

Parents that subclass `CachedRepresentation`/`UniqueRepresentation` already have these methods, but the implementation classes of `Family` and `Set` do not.

Slightly tricky is the question how to deal with mutable elements. `Set` documents that:

```
    Sets with unhashable objects work, but with less functionality::

        sage: B = Set([QQ, [3, 1], 5])  # unhashable
```
Should a copy be made? Should it be documented that by creating the Set, a mutable element belongs to the set object in the sense of object ownership and it is an error to mutate it?
