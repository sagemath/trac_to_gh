`sage.functions` is the home for symbolic functions; this package will not be included in the distribution package **sagemath-standard-no-symbolics** (#32601), nor in smaller distributions such as **sagemath-polyhedra** (#32432).

`sage.functions.log.log` is not a symbolic function but only wrapper def that either delegates to a symbolic function or calls a method. We move it to `sage.misc.functional` so that non-symbolic uses of it do not pull in symbolics; and change these imports.

There is already a function `log` in `sage.misc.functional`, deprecated since #19444 (Sage 8.1).  We replace it.

We keep a non-deprecated import of `log` in `sage.functions.log` for symbolic uses.

Similar to what was done in #32717 for `sqrt`.
