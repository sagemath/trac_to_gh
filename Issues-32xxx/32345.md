Thank you for this implementation. I have a few comments/questions.

Why should `_RightQuantumWord` be internal? It seems like it would be okay as a separate class (in the `braid.py` file).

Why is `_deformed_burau_matrix` hidden? It seems like it would be useful for other people using the braid group class.

I think `_quantum_determinant` should not be in `braid.py`, much less as a method of the braid group elements. The question then becomes where is a good home for this function. I am thinking it is best as a method on matrices. You should also add in the definition to the docstring and make it unhidden.

Both for `_RightQuantumWord` and the `_deformed_burau_matrix`, I couldn't image that they would be used in any other context than in calculating the colored Jones, but why not, let's expose those, there might be some other uses.

Looking around where to put this, I found a `quantum_determinant` method of `QuantumMatrixCoordinate`.

```
sage: O = algebras.QuantumMatrixCoordinate(3)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
sage: O.quantum_determinant()                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
x[1,1]*x[2,2]*x[3,3] - q*x[1,1]*x[2,3]*x[3,2] - q*x[1,2]*x[2,1]*x[3,3] + q^2*x[1,2]*x[2,3]*x[3,1] + q^2*x[1,3]*x[2,1]*x[3,2] - q^3*x[1,3]*x[2,2]*x[3,1]
```

I will take another look at those...

I aimed to address all review comments as outlined in the reply above. 
After looking into it, I'm now not using an attribute, but cache the function 
`_colored_jones_sum`, using always `q` as a variable first and then substituting if necessary. This seems to work as intended:

```
sage: b = BraidGroup(5)([1,2,4,2,-4,-2,3,-2,-1,2,3,1,2,4])
sage: %time b.colored_jones_polynomial(2, try_inverse=False)
CPU times: user 2.14 s, sys: 9.22 ms, total: 2.15 s
Wall time: 2.15 s
q - q^2 + 2*q^3 - q^4 + q^5 - q^6
sage: %time b.colored_jones_polynomial(2, try_inverse=False)
CPU times: user 24.6 ms, sys: 33 µs, total: 24.6 ms
Wall time: 24.3 ms
q - q^2 + 2*q^3 - q^4 + q^5 - q^6
sage: %time b.colored_jones_polynomial(2, 'z', try_inverse=False)
CPU times: user 27.2 ms, sys: 263 µs, total: 27.4 ms
Wall time: 26.9 ms
z - z^2 + 2*z^3 - z^4 + z^5 - z^6
sage: %time b.colored_jones_polynomial(2, 'z', try_inverse=True)
CPU times: user 167 ms, sys: 101 ms, total: 268 ms
Wall time: 267 ms
z - z^2 + 2*z^3 - z^4 + z^5 - z^6
```

We now use the new `quantum_determinant`. 
Not sure why lint on github is still failing, I at least made sure that now pep8 errors appear in the code I added. Also, I hope I now got the formatting for the doc strings correct.

Thank you. It is looking very good. I made some additional changes; most are minor tweaks for PEP8 (and breaking the 80 char/line rule when I felt it made things more readable) and documentation. The two biggest changes is I made are (1) the caching is now associated to `colored_jones_polynomial` so the quantum determinant did not have to be computed multiple times; (2) made `RightQuantumWord.to_tuples()` into a lazy attribute.

If my changes are good, then you can set a positive review.
