The aim is to refine `WordMorphism.growing_letters` to differentiate the various possible behaviors of `|sigma^n(letter)|`. This growth is always of the form `alpha^n n^beta` (where `alpha` is a Perron number and `beta` an integer). Without doing any linear algebra we could differentiate
- mortal (= ultimately empty or `alpha=0`)
- polynomial (`alpha=1`)
- exponential (`alpha > 1`)
The output of the method will a 3-tuple of lists `(mortal, polynomial, exponential)` where
- `mortal` : list of mortal letters
- `polynomial`: a list of lists where `polynomial[i]` is the list of letters with growth `n^i`.
- `exponential`: list of at least exponentionally growing letters

The implementation can be done iteratively by "cleaning" the morphism
- use the already existing `immortal_letters` to detect mortal letters and remove them
- now run an iteration to detect cycles of letters and clean the morphism by removing letters belonging to cycles (each run give polynomially growing letters of higher and higher degrees)
- once there is no cycle anymore, the remaining letters are exponentially growing
