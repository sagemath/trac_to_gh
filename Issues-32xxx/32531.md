It was suggested (https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/cSsAsPuVnxg/m/uWEySfvWBQAJ) that testing of new Python versions (such as the upcoming 3.10) could be done via `pyenv` instead of test tickets (such as #30766) that update our `python3` spkg.

In this ticket, we add supporting infrastructure for this in `tox.ini`.
