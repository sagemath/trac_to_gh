```
Currently, the following code fails, throwing a zero division error:

```
sage: K.<t> = GF(2)[]
sage: lcm(K(0), K(0))
```

As does

```
sage: K.<t> = RR[]
sage: lcm(K(0), K(0))
```

This ticket attempts to fix these errors.

One fix would be to add a try except block to polynomial_element.pyx:

```
def lcm(self, other):
    try:
        f = self*other
        g = self.gcd(other)
        q = f//g

Thanks, added a try except block there as well.

The fix doesn't seem to break anything - I ran all tests.

Should we add a test to test for the fix?

I searched the sage source, and I think the other occurrences of this problem are:
* `def _lcm(self, other)` in src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx (line 4894)
* `def lcm(self, ntl_ZZX other)` in /src/sage/libs/ntl/ntl_ZZX.pyx (line 680)
* `def lcm(self, MPolynomial_libsingular g)` in src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx (line 4862)
* `def lcm(self, right)` in src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_integer_dense_ntl.pyx (line 595)

Can these all be fixed here, or do we need another ticket for some of them?  (I think at least the first one should certainly be done here.)

The first one will definitely throw an error and we can fix that one here.

The one in ntl_ZZX also throws an error:

```
x1 = ntl.ZZX([0,0,0,0])
x1.lcm(x1)
```

But I am unsure how to fix it. If someone else would like to fix it here or create a ticket for it, that would be appreciated.

The multivariate polynomial works in some cases:

```
K.<t,z> = GF(3^4)[]
lcm(K(0), K(0))
0
```

But throws an error over CC for some reason:

```
K.<t,z> = CC[]
lcm(K(0), K(0))
ValueError
```

Not sure what is going on there.


The last one throws an ArithmeticError:

```
R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, implementation='NTL')
R(0).lcm(R(0))
```

So I'll push a fix and test for that.

The idea for a try except block is that lcm is almost never called on 0, so adding an if statement that runs in all cases would be slower overall. The try except block should be quicker in 99% of cases, but slower 1% when lcm is called on 0.

This is similar to the implementation for elements of QQ, where a calculation is attempted inside a try except block, and in the case where an error is thrown, they check to see if 0 or 1 should be returned.

The act of computing the `lcm` should be significantly more than the `is_zero()` check. So I feel any slowdown will be negligible and is not worth the extra code complexity. While it is not much, it does take a bit more time to parse and could accidentally catch some other error (especially the `ArithmeticError`), making thing harder to debug.

Actually, `Rational._lcm` does a zero check first. Note, however, that the code in `QuotientFields.ElementMethods.lcm` doesn't redirect there. That code works there because it redirects to the `lcm` in `ZZ` and does `0/1`. You can also look specifically that the `try-except` block there does **not** catch an `ArithmeticError` (or a `ZeroDivisionError`).

From what I see, much of Sage does the zero check first rather than wrap via a `try`-`except` block. At some point, we probably should deal with inconsistencies between the category level implementations and the stuff via subclasses of `Element`. Yet, that is a separate ticket.

For the `K.<t,z> = CC[]` case, you just don't have an `lcm` method defined there. We probably should implement something for UFDs, which I believe has existence and uniqueness (up to a unit).

Now I am not strictly opposed to this way of fixing things, but I think these things should be weighed before committing to them. Perhaps someone else can comment on this?

I agree with Travis that an `if` statement is better from a readability point of view, and that the speed difference will be negligible.  I also don't feel strongly, so if the author of this ticket would prefer to use the `try` block I think that getting this bug fixed is more important than the decision of which way to do it.
