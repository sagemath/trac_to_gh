One test is, you can test that a certain element is found. E.g. `0` appears as a random element.

The next test calculates the mean. I didn't care too much, if the tests passes immediately. This happens, but if the test is run on random seeds, it would still be meaningful.

I like the simpler test. If I state that distribution can be checked like this, people can figure this out themselves and I have also some examples like this in the `ZZ.random_element` documentation prepared in #29979.

One last question though: I think this should depend on 29935, and not the other way around? Otherwise this

```
sage: while not all(found.values()):
....:     found[ZZ.random_element(-2, 3)] = True
```

is going to loop forever as `ZZ.random_element(-2, 3)` generates the same number over and over again.

Nevermind, it generates the same sequence, not the same number each time...
