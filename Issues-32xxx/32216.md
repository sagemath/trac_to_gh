From [#29935 comment:139](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/29935#comment:139):

We updated the developers guide to point out that doctests are expected to pass for any random seed.

```
...
sage: hash(c)  # random
This doctest passes too, as the output is not checked
```

I am going to nitpick this to death, sorry:

```
sage: while ZZ.random_element() != 0:
....:     pass
sage: total = ZZ.random_element(-2, 3)
sage: count = 1
sage: while abs(total/count) > 0.01:
....:     total += ZZ.random_element(-2, 3)
....:     count += 1
```

Why skip an initial sequence of zeros? If it's because we don't want the test to pass immediately... is it any more reassuring if our sequence is `[-1,1]`? I think this only tests the mean of the distribution, and if we really want to claim we've tested *that*, then we should insist on some minimum number of loops.

I'm not really suggesting that we go crazy on this example... could we test something simpler that's more obviously doing the right thing? Like checking that each element of `[-2,-1,0,1,2]` is generated eventually?

One last question though: I think this should depend on 29935, and not the other way around? Otherwise this

```
sage: while not all(found.values()):
....:     found[ZZ.random_element(-2, 3)] = True
```

is going to loop forever as `ZZ.random_element(-2, 3)` generates the same number over and over again.

Nevermind, it generates the same sequence, not the same number each time...
