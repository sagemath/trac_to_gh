(Split out from #32242.)

This makes `singular_console` (or standalone use of the `singular` executable for those who use the Sage distribution as an installer for Singular) mildly more functional.

In the default configuration on macOS, Singular's help commands such as `?ring;` use the "browser method" `mac-www`, which is the rather unhelpful:

```
// ** Displaying help in browser 'mac-www'.
// ** Use 'system("--browser", <browser>);' to change browser,
// ** where <browser> can be: "mac-www", "safari-www", "builtin", "dummy", "emacs".
running `open https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-2-0/ &`
```
It turns out that this is caused by the file `singular.idx` missing in the installation (see below).

Singular has a built-in info browser that gives a simple pager:

```
> system("browsers");
Available HelpBrowsers: mac-www, safari-www, builtin, dummy, emacs, 
Current HelpBrowser: mac-www 
> system("--browser", "builtin");
> ?ring
. ;
HELP >>ring>>

File: singular.hlp,  Node: Examples of ring declarations,  Next: General syntax of a ring declaration,  Prev: Rings and orderings,  Up: Rings and orderings

3.3.1 Examples of ring declarations
-----------------------------------

The exact syntax of a ring declaration is given in the next two
...
 Press <RETURN> to continue or x to exit help.
```

Making the `info` program available may give a better user experience in the terminal. However, on macOS (where `/usr/bin/info` is "info (GNU texinfo) 4.8"; newer versions available through homebrew), it becomes apparent that our current installation of Singular (spkg) is incomplete:

```
> system("--browser", "info");
// ** Could not get 'IdxFile'.
// ** Either set environment variable 'SINGULAR_IDX_FILE' to 'IdxFile',
// ** or make sure that 'IdxFile' is at "/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-gcc11/local/bin/../share/singular/singular.idx"
// ** resource `x` not found
// ** Help browser stays at 'builtin'.
```
(This installation step is missing even in the next Singular release 4.2.1 (#32001).)
