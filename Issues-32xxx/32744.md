This patch introduces two important improvements for isogeny-minded users:

1. Implement `EllipticCurveHom_composite`, a type of elliptic-curve morphism that's fundamentally a formal composite map, but designed to behave almost exactly like `EllipticCurveIsogeny`. Leaving the isogeny decomposed can be exponentially more efficient in some scenarios (such as in cryptography).

2. Implement "factored" isogenies, that is, construction of an isogeny from a smooth-order kernel subgroup in time logarithmic in the degree (whereas `EllipticCurveIsogeny` is linear in the degree).

The new code is marked as experimental and not used anywhere by default, but adventurous users can opt-in by calling `EllipticCurveHom_composite.make_default()` or passing `algorithm="factored"` to `E.isogeny()`. Changes to the existing codebase are intentionally kept minimal.

Here's a diff without the dependency:

- https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/compare/444330c857ee57a22e7e7e974cb63478b1535398...72ab0b8cdc18b15ea893a3db914419631252de23

Most of the algorithms are straightforward, except perhaps for equality testing: This relies on the fact that distinct isogenies cannot act the same on "too many" points (the bound is four times the degree). See also #31850.

Depends on #32502

One question: Did you look at the entire diff including #32502, or just the changes made on top of #32502? In the first case, I think you can also set #32502 to "positive review".
