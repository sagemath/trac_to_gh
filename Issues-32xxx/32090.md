libsirocco 2.1.0 provides the option of treating separately the factors of a polynomial, speeding up homotopy continuation for reducible curves.

In this ticket, I also address a possible issue with the selection of paths to compute the braid monodromy of a curve. The preexisting code used floating points approximations, without a complete proof of the correctness of the results. Here we use rationals, which are slower, but much more robust. In some cases, this slowdown can be compensated by the improvements in sirocco.

Finally, it includes the option of getting the braid monodromy as a list of braids (some colleagues have been asking for this feature for a while).

+1 to moving to rationals and exact arithmetic.

`cpdef` functions will need doctests. Same for `def roots_interval_cached`.

Code formatting versus latex:

```diff
-no other root of `f`, nor any root of the polynomials in `factors`,
+no other root of ``f``, nor any root of the polynomials in ``factors``,
```

```diff

(Although you don't really need the `OUTPUT:` here since it is obvious from the 1-line description.)

```diff

```

You can do

```diff
-p = E.vertices()[0]
+p = next(E.vertex_iterator())
```
to get one vertex without building the entire list.

Two places:

```diff
-not (g, v) in roots_interval_cache.keys()
+(g, v) not in roots_interval_cache
```

Also, the number of blanklines in a few places is a little strange.

It only happens the first time I run it (after that, it works ok). It seems that something is going on with the parallel framework, but can't pinpoint it.

Any clue about what would that be?

I am a little worried about the global cache and things running in parallel since they are running in different processes. However, that won't cause the error above and it will likely mean that the cache is not working as effectively as it could. What might be related is calling a `@parallel` function within a `@parallel` function. That was not done before this ticket. It might be better to have a more direct implementation rather than using the `@parallel`, but since this is currently working, that could be a follow-up.

A few things I noticed that could offer improvements:

```diff
-            if not any([a.overlaps(b) for a,b in Subsets(intervals[f], 2)]):
-            intervals[f] = [r.interval(ComplexIntervalField(precision[f])) for r in y0sf]
+            CIFp = ComplexIntervalField(precision[f])
+            intervals[f] = [r.interval(CIFp) for r in y0sf]
+            if not any(a.overlaps(b) for a,b in itertools.combinations(intervals[f], 2)):
```

```diff
     global roots_interval_cache
-    if (f,x0) in roots_interval_cache.keys():
+    try:
         return roots_interval_cache[(f,x0)]
-    else:
+    except KeyError:
         result = roots_interval(f,x0)
         roots_interval_cache[(f,x0)] = result
         return result
```

```diff
-        diam = min([(CF(r)-CF(r0)).abs() for r0 in roots[:i]+roots[i+1:]])/divisor
+        diam = min((CF(r)-CF(r0)).abs() for r0 in roots[:i]+roots[i+1:]) / divisor
```

If I am not mistaken, current code does not call a `@`parallel function from a `@`parallel function.

I agree the current design is hacky, but couldn't find another way to achieve both cache and parallelism in a less hacky way. (Maybe encapsulating it in a specific class for that, but that does sound overkill).

What would you suggest?

You have `braid_in_segment` -> `roots_interval_cached` -(if not cached)-> `roots_interval`. Perhaps this never happens because you have fully populated the cache, but this is not obvious to me.
