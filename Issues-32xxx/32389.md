```
In some circumstances (e.g. integration),
it may be useful to rewrite

- expressions in sin(x), cos(x), etc.
  as expressions in tan(x/2),
- expressions in sinh(x), cosh(x), etc.
  as expressions in tanh(x/2)

This ticket implements a method
for this transformation.

<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
This is a good thing to add.

I rebased on Sage 9.4.rc2 and added a commit with:

- changes from `\|` to `|` in FriCAS output reverted:
  they break tests for me
- some refactoring for readability of code ​and examples
  - use `half` for `Integer(1)/Integer(2)`
    (also makes lines shorter)
  - less parentheses, brackets and backslashes
    in the `all(...)` test
  - make `trig_expand` example more compelling
    by naming `a` and `b`
- some reformatting, in particular `::` and
  ​`....:` ​for example and test blocks
- minor rephrasing, fix spacing and a typo

Set to positive review if you agree with these changes.

Indeed... `sympy`'s and `giac` integrators use this often.

??? Not for me. Go figure...

Smart. I should have thought of this, I didn't...

I'm still struggling with ResStructuredText (too much markup syntaxes : LaTeX, Markdown, Org, Oxygen, [WikiFormatting](../wiki/WikiFormatting) and now this...). Thanks a lot !

> - minor rephrasing, fix spacing and a typo

> Set to positive review if you agree with these changes.

Thanks ! I do.

BTW : you should be co-author, but I'm almost sure that Trac will balk at the same name in `Author` and `Reviewer` fields.

In the same spirit (probably more useful), you may be interested in my attempt to #10038 (demoivre/exponentialize).

<a id='comment:11'>Comment 11:</a>
The FriCAS output can be a different ticket.
Maybe it depends on the version of FriCAS.

Trac won't mind us being co-authors and
co-reviewers of the ticket. It's frequent.

Regarding #10038, I saw you pushed a branch
and I'm planning to look at it soon.
