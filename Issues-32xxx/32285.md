Fractions are note reduced when dividing two monomials in a fraction field over a polynomial ring with coefficients in `RR` or `CC`. Here is a very simple example, but the problem persists for multivariate rings as well:

```
sage: F = RR['x'].fraction_field()
sage: F.inject_variables()
Defining x
sage: x/x        # this should be 1
x/x
sage: x.is_unit()
True
sage: ~x
1.00000000000000/x
sage: ~x * x     # this should be 1
x/x
sage: x/x == 1
True
```
Same problem occurs with `CC`, `CDF`, `CIF`, `RDF`, `RIF`, `RBF`, etc.

Component: **algebra**

Keywords: **polynomials, fraction fields**
