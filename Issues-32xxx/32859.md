```
In Sage 9.4 and 9.5.beta5, the following cell of a Jupyter notebook

```
%display latex
type(x)
```
results in 

```
\[\newcommand{\Bold}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}\verb||\]
```
instead of 

```
<𝚌𝚕𝚊𝚜𝚜'𝚜𝚊𝚐𝚎.𝚜𝚢𝚖𝚋𝚘𝚕𝚒𝚌.𝚎𝚡𝚙𝚛𝚎𝚜𝚜𝚒𝚘𝚗.𝙴𝚡𝚙𝚛𝚎𝚜𝚜𝚒𝚘𝚗'>
```
Everything is OK with Sage <= 9.3. 

Depends on #32208

This is an off-topic, but your notebooks show latex expressions flush left. As far as I know, latex expressions are displayed centered by default. I don't know how you did it. Anyway, I think latex expressions should be shown flush left by default. What do you think?

This is strange indeed... Maybe it's a matter of OS? What is yours? Mine is Ubuntu 20.04. I've always had flushed left expressions on all the computers I've used (all running various versions of Ubuntu). It could also be related to the locale (fr_FR in my case). The centered rendering on CoCalc does not surprise me further because their Jupyter is somehow customized.

Possibly. I don't know. If you open the notebook in editor (by right-clicking it), then you can see the raw data. Mine shows

```

      ],
      "text/plain": [
       "<class 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>"

Another data point: when running Jupyterlab on my computer (via `sage -n jupyterlab`), latex expressions are centered. So there is a difference of behavior between the Jupyter notebook and Jupyterlab.

Anyway that "centered" behavior is consistent with what we see in the jupyterlab. So the question is what behavior we want.
