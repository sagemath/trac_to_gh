I wonder if something ridiculous like this wouldn't also work as an interim hack:

You can also check the (string) module name with `c.__module__` to avoid name clashes. But chances are, it's slower at runtime.

I don't know how to do it with a decorator, but I think a metaclass can ensure that a given class is only subclassed once. As an added bonus, the metaclass can explain why these exist and how they should be used (i.e. that they aren't really abstract base classes).

This example fails (as intended) the second time we subclass:

```python
class TypeCheckWrapper(type):
    _subclasses = 0

    def __init__(cls, name, bases, clsdict):
        if len(cls.mro()) > 2:
            TypeCheckWrapper._subclasses += 1
            if TypeCheckWrapper._subclasses > 1:
                raise TypeError("TypeCheckWrapper with multiple subclasses")
        super(TypeCheckWrapper, cls).__init__(name, bases, clsdict)

class Polyhedron(metaclass=TypeCheckWrapper):
    pass

print("Defined base class Polyhedron")

class Cone(Polyhedron):
    pass

print("Defined class Cone(Polyhedron)")

class Polytope(Polyhedron):
    pass

print("Defined class Polytope(Polyhedron)")
```
