When substituting an empty list into a polynomial, a segmentation fault is triggered.
This was tested on `CoCalc` with `SageMath 9.4`.
It is also present in `SageMath 9.2` and `9.3`.

The following leads to a segmentation fault:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: x.substitute([]) # segmentation fault
```

Note that this does not happen in the case of symbolic expressions:

```
sage: var('y')
sage: y.substitute([])
y
```

Thanks for the bug report.

Here is a more precise source of the problem:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: Polynomial.__call__(x, []) # segmention fault
```

I think the segfault is in line 751 of `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx` (i.e., the last line of this code snippet):

```
if args:
    if a is not None:
        raise TypeError("unsupported mix of keyword and positional arguments")
    if isinstance(args[0], (list, tuple)):
        if len(args) > 1:
            raise TypeError("invalid arguments")
        args = args[0]
    a, args = args[0], args[1:]
```
The line `args = args[0]` sets `args` to be the empty list (because that is the argument that we supplied), so accessing `args[0]` after that is a very bad idea.
