Timeout when creating edge disjoint spanning trees:

```
sage: dig6_string = r'[E_S?_hKIH@eos[BSg???Q@FShGC?hTHUGM?IPug?'
sage: dig6_string += r'JOEYCdOzdkQGo@ADA@AAg?GAQW?'

sage: dig6_string += r'?YBFosqITEA?IvCU_'
sage: G = DiGraph(dig6_string)
sage: G.edge_connectivity(5)
5
sage: G.edge_disjoint_spanning_trees(5)  # timeout
```

This contradicts a doctest in `src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py`.

The current method is based on integer linear programming and is very slow.

For undirected graphs, we can try to implement one of the existing polynomial time algorithm such as the one described in https://doi.org/10.1287/moor.10.4.701. I don't know yet if there is a simpler algorithms.

I don't know the algorithms for directed graphs.

At first, I propose an alternative ILP formulation based on the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin subtour elimination constraints to replace the current formulation which is based on the maximum average degree. I obtain the solution for the reported digraph with `glpk` in 1.4s on a macbook air.

```

Of course, it would be better to implement the polynomial time algorithms.

However, if I remove the constraint ensuring that each vertex is incident to a selected edge, the program is way slower to solve.

With this ticket our claim is still way above that what sage can do. For those three graphs with 12 vertices, this ticket fails:

```
sage: g1 = DiGraph(r'KAGBiSahR?D?Hw@jFDbLyTWAE')
sage: g2 = DiGraph(r'KW?ACPRIJh_AKPCk_KAORC`Bw') 
sage: g3 = DiGraph(r'KOOB?R?@G_IGc_U}`NEMjE@CE') 
```

Even worse, it seems to work find on the develop branch. However, on the develop branch I'm getting `UnboundedLocalError`, because `classes` are referenced before assignment.

Anyway, while this resolved the one particular case I reported, it seems to have created various other problems.

It seems to be an improvement. It takes way longer until I find a `DiGraph` with 12 vertices that does not work. And those do work in up to 40 seconds.

```
sage: g1 = DiGraph(r'KO_@OThwDWWCSAMOj_tCIa`DA')      
sage: g2 = DiGraph(r'KGGdZEaQEOyEBZU?DO@O`wKBk')           
sage: g3 = DiGraph(r'KH?cpUuwpp{AOH^SAEEDaWCbW')        
sage: g4 = DiGraph(r'K?IJHENIUh[_ODPCD_@Tr{Wxg')
```

There is more. This is how I find them:

```
sage: def foo(n): 
....:     try: 
....:         alarm(20) 
....:         g = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(n, .3) 
....:         k = Integer(g.edge_connectivity()) 
....:         arborescences = g.edge_disjoint_spanning_trees(k) 
....:     except AlarmInterrupt: 
....:         print(g.dig6_string()) 
....:     finally: 
....:         cancel_alarm() 
....:  
sage: while True:
....:     foo(12)
```

With the new formulation and `glpk`, I get the solution for g1, g2, g3 in less than 1s and for g4 in 5s. I'm on a Intel MacBook air.

But for sure it would be much better to get a proper implementation of the polynomial time algorithms.

I now have an implementation of the [Roskind-Tarjan](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/moor.10.4.701) algorithm for finding minimum-cost edge-disjoint spanning trees in undirected simple graphs. 
However, I don't have any code for directed graphs (and I have not found any reference yet).

Which solution do you prefer:
- remove the ILP for undirected graphs and replace it with my code
- keep the ILP and add new code.

Note that the ILP is not needed if only for comparison purpose. I can add a method to check the validity of the solution.

I have added the `Roskind-Tarjan` algorithm for undirected graphs.

test with `graphs.RandomGNP(50, .4)` and `cplex`, I get:

FYI: thanks to the Loukas Georgiadis and his co-authors (see #comment:37), I now have a working implementation of the algorithm of Gabow for computing the edge connectivity of a digraph. They gave me a pure C code that I turned into an easier to read Cython code. It still lacks comments and doctests... 

I'm still working on the second part of the paper of Gabow for extracting the k-edge-disjoint spanning trees (not obvious). I will not push code before it's done as I may have to refactor some parts of the first algorithm that are also used in the second part.

outch :(

This is for

```
g = Graph(']sLa{AZZs?fCoOOPAqJaO_byp|e?w[U@cObCktCSsAO]b{cndeJIT`G~dcaXWEBwUk_kLar@sg')
```
It's a too hard instance for this formulation with `GLPK`.

I see 2 solutions here: use a much smaller instance (10 nodes ?) or deprecate the `ILP` formulation. We have the polynomial time  `Roskind-Tarjan` algorithm for undirected graphs and we should soon have an algorithm for directed graphs (GSoC project).

I would make the number of nodes for the test smaller as it is less invasive of a fix.
