Mea cu'pa, as these tests are all "mine".  When I implemented this I got rather carries away and put in possibly too many tests, though I seem to remember tagging several "long time" at first.  I perhaps removed the tag from some later, but the actual time taken depends on many lower-level things.  Anyway, I am happy to have more tagged as they are more instructive demos than pure tests.

BUT there does seem to be a regression in there: I would not have tagged that a test takes 500ms if it took >11s.

I'm giving this a positive review since I don't have time now to try to work out why so many of these are so much slower now than when they were written.
