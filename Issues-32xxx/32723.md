Many functions with parameters `by_weight` and `weight_function` have duplicated code for checking the parameters and setting the weight function. Here we add a helper function `_get_weight_function` that takes all related parameters as input and return proper values for parameter `by_weight` and a valid weight function.

A next step will be to unify the usage of weights in graphs, as proposed in  #13112, since we use either `use_edge_labels` or the combination of `by_weight` and `weight_function`.
