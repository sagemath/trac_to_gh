scipy 1.6 added a vendored copy of the HiGHS LP solvers. https://github.com/scipy/scipy/tree/master/scipy/optimize/_highs/src

https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.linprog-highs.html

We should start using them.

scipy 1.7 makes dual values available - https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/release.1.7.0.html#scipy-optimize-improvements

https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/hall/HiGHS/ also has MIP, but this is not yet exposed in scipy.optimize. 
- scipy 1.9 will add it - https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/15460 has been merged

highs also has a rudimentary python interface in its own source tree - https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/blob/master/src/interfaces/highs_python_api.py

For an interface that provides access to tableau data, as of 2022-04, neither scipy nor the [OsiHiGHSSolverInterface](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/blob/master/src/interfaces/OsiHiGHSSolverInterface.hpp) provides the necessary methods:
- https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/issues/525#issuecomment-1038529096
- https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/15915 (feature request)
