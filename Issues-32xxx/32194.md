The is_preperiodic function, which determines if a point is preperiodic, does not work over finite fields. There `err` parameter can only be passed to the non-finite field version.

```
sage: P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(GF(3),2)
sage: F=DynamicalSystem([x^2-2*y^2,y^2,z^2])
sage: Q=P(1,1,1)
sage: Q.is_preperiodic(F,return_period=True)
...
TypeError: _is_preperiodic() got an unexpected keyword argument 'err'
```
