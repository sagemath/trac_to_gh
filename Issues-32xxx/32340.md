I am suspicious that this is the correct place to put this documentation since the method just is calling the super one. That suggests it should go in the implementation of the base class.

Presumably, the way the patch is currently done increases the visibility of the warning to those users who need to see it: They'd most likely be reading the number fields documentation, not the rings documentation. But I don't have a strong opinion either way.

I don’t quite buy that argument. From the interactive documentation with `?`, you see it all the same. I don’t think it makes that much difference in the online doc. It does add an extra (Python) indirection, which means the code it (albeit likely just marginally) slower. The same message would, in principle, apply for anything using the base class as well.

Thank you. I think that is a much more natural place to put it (which reflects the fact that it uses the `ideal()` method).

Perhaps interesting, we get oddities like this:

```
sage: z = QQ['z'].0
sage: K = NumberField(z - 1,'s'); K
Number Field in s with defining polynomial z - 1
sage: K(7).is_prime()
True
```
I guess that is what structure you want to put on it: a number field or a usual field. Perhaps this is one way out of #7596, to have `QQ.number_field()` return the object above.
