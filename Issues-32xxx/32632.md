Sage fails to compute isomorphisms between elliptic curves in characteristic 2 in some cases:

```sage
sage: GF(2^8).inject_variables()
Defining z8
sage: E = EllipticCurve([z8,z8,z8,z8,z8])
sage: E.automorphisms()
# ...
ValueError: second argument is not an isomorphism from first argument to third argument
```

The reason appears to be that the formula for the special case `char=2`, `j≠0` in the `isomorphisms()` function defined in `sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/weierstrass_morphism` is lacking a division by one of the Weierstraß `a`‑coefficients. This makes the function return wrong isomorphisms, which is subsequently detected when the corresponding `WeierstrassIsomorphism` object is constructed.
