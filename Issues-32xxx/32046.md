That's right. See `build/bin/sage-venv`, which is the script that we use to set up our venv over the system Python. https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv.EnvBuilder `with_pip` defaults to False; and we also use `system_site_packages=False`.
We then bootstrap `setuptools`, `pip`, and `wheel` in our empty virtual environment -- same as we do when we build our own python.

> Are the entries in `pip/distros` ignored?

Yes, they are only decoration. There is currently only one use-case for Python system packages, and that is a conda development environment (see `src/environment.yml`).
