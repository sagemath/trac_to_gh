In `quadratic_form`:

```diff
-        Examples::
+        EXAMPLES::
```

In `minimum` and `maximum`:

```diff
-        .. Math::
+        .. MATH::
```

In `maximum`, use one blank line, not two,
between `math` block and `EXAMPLES` block.

Some trivial things:

- No period/full-stop or capital letters for error messages to follow Python conventions.
- It would be good to have a space around the `*` to better follow PEP8.
- Remove one of the blanklines before `EXAMPLES::` in `maximum`.
- It is usually marginally faster to do `if x:` (resp. `if not x:`) compared to `if x != 0:` (reps. `if x == 0:`. Although this can degrade readability slightly. Feel free to ignore this if you prefer as this is more idiosyncratic.
- In `short_vectors()` you could do `e = +-2` if desired.

Otherwise LGTM.
