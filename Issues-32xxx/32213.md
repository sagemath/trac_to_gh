Our standard package `flint` provides a `cmake` build system as an alternative to its homegrown build system.  https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/issues/981, #32211

In order to be able to use it, we need to make `cmake` a standard package.
This is also needed to perform a matplotlib update in #31580, which in turn requires
making `qhull` (which is built with `cmake`) standard

We also upgrade `cmake` from 3.19.3 (#31258) to 3.21.0 (latest - https://repology.org/project/cmake/versions)
