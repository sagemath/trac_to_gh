There is a spurious "and" in the second output below:

```
sage: ModularSymbols(Gamma0(11), 2)
Modular Symbols space of dimension 3 for Gamma_0(11) of weight 2 with sign 0 over Rational Field
sage: ModularSymbols(Gamma1(11), 2)
Modular Symbols space of dimension 11 for Gamma_1(11) of weight 2 with sign 0 and over Rational Field
```

suggestion for other tickets: use unicode ℾ, ℾ₀, ℾ₁ for the repr of the Gamma congruence groups

Nice suggestion!  Or perhaps Γ (Greek capital letter Gamma) or 𝛤 (mathematical italic capital Gamma)?
