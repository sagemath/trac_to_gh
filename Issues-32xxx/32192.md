Some docstrings don't follow the usual convention:

https://wiki.sagemath.org/plugins#blocks

See for example [#31881@comment:50](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31881#comment:50), [#32013@comment:26](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/32013#comment:26) etc.

For the sake of unification, we clean those strings up.
