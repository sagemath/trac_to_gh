I'm pretty sure this is a new problem, otherwise I would have hit it with lcalc-2.x before. These tests were done on a clean 9.5.beta5 build.

When I start sage, my `PATH` looks correct, in that `SAGE_LOCAL/bin` comes before the usual system paths (in particular `/usr/bin`):

```
sage: os.environ["PATH"].split(":")
['/home/mjo/src/sage.git/build/bin',
 '/home/mjo/src/sage.git/src/bin',
 '/home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.9/bin',
 '/home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/bin',
 '/usr/local/sbin',
 '/usr/local/bin',
 '/usr/sbin',
 '/usr/bin',
 '/sbin',
 '/bin',
 '/opt/bin',
 '/usr/lib/llvm/12/bin',
 '/home/mjo/bin',
 '/home/mjo/bin']
```

And if I use `shutil.which` to find the "lcalc" program, it finds the right one:

```
sage: from shutil import which
sage: which("lcalc")
'/home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/bin/lcalc'
sage: os.system(which("lcalc") + " --version")
lcalc 1.22 July 14, 2009
0
```

But... that's not the one that sage itself wants to use:

```
sage: os.system("lcalc --version")
lcalc 2.0.3
0
sage: from sage.lfunctions.lcalc import LCalc
sage: lc = LCalc()
sage: lc("--version")
'lcalc 2.0.3'
```

This is causing all doctests that run "lcalc" to fail, because they're picking up lcalc-2.x from `/usr/bin` instead of the one in `SAGE_LOCAL/bin` that the SPKG installed.

There's a big warning on https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html that basically tells you to use `shutil.which()`, but it would be nice to know what's happening before implementing that.

I'm also getting this, new, failure, and a few others like it:

```

Failed example:

    256
```

It looks like anything that execs a shell is having environment problems. The lcalc stuff is using `os.popen` instead of `subprocess.Popen`, and the former passes `shell=True` to the latter. If I use `subprocess.Popen(..., shell=False)` directly, the problem goes away.

I'd still like to know *why* this stopped working, though.

libSingular is doing this... it looks like `feInitResources()` is being called during sage's `init_libsingular()`, and that results in,

```
char* path = feResource('p');
...
if (path != NULL) setenv("PATH", path, 1);
```

Now the 'p' resource is,

```
{"Path",      'p',    feResPath,  NULL,                   "%b;%P;$PATH",             (char *)""}
```

And that matches what I'm seeing in exec'd shells:

```
sage: os.system("echo $PATH")
/usr/bin:/usr/bin/../libexec/singular/MOD:/usr/libexec/singular/MOD:/home/mjo/src/sage.git/build/bin:/home/mjo/src/sage.git/src/bin:/home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.9/bin:/home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/lib/llvm/12/bin:/home/mjo/bin
```

To confirm, commenting out the `init_libsingular()` line in `sage/libs/singular/singular.pyx` does fix the issue.

This is certainly a Singular bug. If anything, it should be appending those paths to the end of `$PATH`. But we've gotta do something to work around it in sage for now. Here's my it's-not-stupid-if-it-works entry:

That was my first thought of course, but I couldn't figure out what precisely went wrong. I think I forgot to clean up the installed cython package from that branch, which would have made pip refuse to reinstall what it thought was the same version of cython. I've convinced myself that it isn't due to some `PATH` issue anyway.
