The upgrade helps with the python 3.10 compatibility. 

Someone with more familiarity with the documentation should take a look that the built documentation looks OK with this ticket

I think I missed something here: the file `build/pkgs/sphinx/install-requires.txt` says:

```
sphinx >=4, <4.2
```
which isn't compatible with wanting to install Sphinx 4.2. `networkx` complains about this in its log file, and I don't know if there are other more serious effects.
