I occasionally find myself trying to solve polynomial systems arising from rational equations:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(31337)[]
sage: xx = (x*y+y*x) / (1+23*x^2*y^2)
sage: yy = (y^2-x^2) / (1+23*x^2*y^2)
sage: Ideal([xx-1, yy-0]) == 1
True
```
One might conclude at this point that the equation has no solutions.

This is of course nonsense: `xx` and `yy` are elements of the *fraction field* of `R`, so every ideal is either `(0)` or `(1)`, and what we should have written is `Ideal([f.numerator() for f in (xx-1, yy-0)])`. Realizing that this is what's happening may cost the user precious seconds, minutes, or even hours.

This patch adds a warning to the `Ideal()` function when the automatically inferred base ring is a field, except when the constructed ideal is an instance of `Ideal_fractional`.

The warning is only triggered when the base ring is not given explicitly: For example, writing `a*R` or `R.ideal(...)` or even `Ideal(R, ...)` will never print the warning, but `Ideal(1/2)` will.

I couldn't really think of any cases where users would actually *want* to create ideals in fields (outside of basic educational examples), since they're all trivial. Does anyone know situations where this warning would be annoying?

Keywords: fields, fraction fields, ideals
