```


In this ticket, we 
- discuss which of these functions provide sufficient added value to users over just using `scipy`; 
- deprecate functions that do not provide sufficient added value;
- provide documentation that empowers users to use Sage functions with `scipy` (including the `sage.ext.fast_callable` facility) - see #24536 for some new adapters



Symptoms:
- `minimize_constrained` https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/5vp5UTexpxQ/m/DG_lmN9ZAwAJ

I'm not so sure about this one. These functions are minimal(ish) wrappers around scipy that,

* allow you to use sage types as input/output
* check the results for correctness
* drop "verbose" return values

The essence of sage is wrapping other scientific libraries in a consistent and user-friendly interface. What  `find_root` does (for example) is not rocket surgery,  but I certainly wouldn't want to write it myself every time I have a calc1 problem to double-check.

In other news, Gregory Bard's book (http://gregorybard.com/Sage.html) also uses a few of these functions.

Thanks for the input and the pointer.
