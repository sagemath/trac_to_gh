```
Up to Sage 9.5.beta4, `threejs_template.html` can
automatically scale down the z-axis if the last entry
of `aspect_ratio` is set to `1` (whether because
the user did not specify a value, or because the user
specified a value identical to the default value)
and the plot extends a lot more in the z direction
than in the x and y directions.

For instance, the following example

```
sage: cubes = sum([cube((0, 0, i)) for i in range(0, 6)])
sage: cubes.show(aspect_ratio=[1, 1, 1])
```
shows a stack of cubes squeezed along the z-axis,
rather than a stack of undistorted cubes.

This behavior is unexpected after explicitly
setting the aspect ratio.

In the file `threejs_template.html`,
the lines responsible for this behavior are:

```
    var autoAspect = 2.5;
    if ( zRange > autoAspect * rRange && a[2] === 1 ) a[2] = autoAspect * rRange / zRange;
```

That automatic scaling down was introduced in #12402.
Quoting from that ticket:
> There is already automatic scaling in the z-direction
> to avoid the tall thin box that appears in the current
> version on the cell server (and SMC), but that can
> easily be overridden.


It is worth mentioning that one way to overwrite
this behavior is to do:

```
sage: plot.show(aspect_ratio=[1, 1, 0.99999])
```

This ticket fixes this behavior and introduces
a new threejs-specific plot option.

The new option is called  `auto_scaling`
(default: [False, False, False]) and takes
a list or a tuple of three booleans;
set to `True` to automatically scale down
the corresponding direction if it is too large.

This example shows the distortion in a more conspicuous way:

```
sage: plot = sum([cube((0,0,i)) for i in range(0,10,2)])
....: plot.show(aspect_ratio=[1,1,1])
```
Apparently this automatic distortion was inserted as a hack to deal with some specific example that looked bad? It should be removed!

If such an automatic scaling feature is at all desired, it should be triggered by something like
*aspect_ratio=[1,1,"automatic"]*

It turns out this behavior is documented.
In the current version of `reference/plot3d/threejs.html` (see page https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plot3d/threejs.html) it says
> aspect_ratio – (default: [1,1,1]) list or tuple of three numeric values; z-aspect is automatically reduced when large but can be overridden


However, I still believe it should not be the default behavior.
Following Günter's suggestion, we can do

```diff
    var autoAspect = 2.5;
-    if ( zRange > autoAspect * rRange && a[2] === 1 ) a[2] = autoAspect * rRange / zRange;
+    if ( zRange > autoAspect * rRange && a[2] === "automatic" ) a[2] = autoAspect * rRange / zRange;

```

-It turned out that the automatic scaling was introduced in #12402. I quote the following text from that ticket:
->  There is already automatic scaling in the z-direction to avoid the tall thin box that appears in the current version on the cell server (and SMC), but that can easily be overridden.
