<a id='comment:6'></a>This branch passes testlong on Debian.

(Except one test in `src/sage/modular/local_comp/local_comp.py`
which has a hotfix in #29977 and is the object of #32134.)

Launching GitHub actions on this would be useful.

I've pushed a branch to my fork on [GitHub](GitHub):

- https://github.com/slel/sage/tree/32001

but I don't remember if that's enough to launch tests
on multiple platforms. I can see

- https://github.com/slel/sage/actions/runs/1042993351

which indicates linting tests have failed (unsurprisingly
as linting the whole Sage code base is work in progress);
does that block further tests from running?

But `sci-mathematics/singular-4.2.1` is already installed in gentoo image. 
I expected to see

```
configure: will use system package and not install SPKG singular
```

this won't happen until #29024 is done. 

You can try putting
https://trac.sagemath.org/attachment/ticket/29024/spkg-configure.m4
into build/pkgs/singular/spkg-configure.m4
and run ./bootstrap
(then, assuming Singular is known to pkg-config, it might work...)
