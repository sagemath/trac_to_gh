This will need careful checking in particular on Cygwin.
It appears that the last update to 4.2.0p3 broke Cygwin again - https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/2909494587?check_suite_focus=true

This branch passes testlong on Debian.

(Except one test in `src/sage/modular/local_comp/local_comp.py`
which has a hotfix in #29977 and is the object of #32134.)

Launching GitHub actions on this would be useful.

I've pushed a branch to my fork on [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub):

- https://github.com/slel/sage/tree/32001

but I don't remember if that's enough to launch tests
on multiple platforms. I can see

- https://github.com/slel/sage/actions/runs/1042993351

which indicates linting tests have failed (unsurprisingly
as linting the whole Sage code base is work in progress);
does that block further tests from running?

But `sci-mathematics/singular-4.2.1` is already installed in gentoo image.

this won't happen until #29024 is done. 

You can try putting
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket29024/spkg-configure.m4.gz
into build/pkgs/singular/spkg-configure.m4
and run ./bootstrap
(then, assuming Singular is known to pkg-config, it might work...)
