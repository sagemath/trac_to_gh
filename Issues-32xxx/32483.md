These workarounds were added in #29803.

`flit_core` is added in #31280, `poetry_core` in #33866, so we can make use of these build systems instead of relying on generated setup scripts.

It works, but I'm confused by `terminado`: how did you know to make `hatchling` a dependency? I don't see any reference to `flit` or `hatchling` in the `terminado` tarball — `grep flit -R .` comes up empty, for example — and it only lists `ptyprocess` and `tornado` as requirements.
