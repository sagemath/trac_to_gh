<a id='comment:5'></a>- There is a missing empty-line before this one.

```diff
+    if is_sparse:
+        return free_module_element.FreeModuleElement_generic_sparse
```
  It is really different from the above, as it also catches some of the above cases, where an import failed.
- If you are touching this line, you might as well fix it (`Returns` -> `Return`):

```diff
+    Returns True if ``R`` is the symbolic expression ring.
```

Once done, you can put it on positive review on my behalf.
