```
Currently we have:

```
sage: from sympy import sympify
sage: sympify(sin(x))
sin(x)
sage: 
sage: sympify(sin)
SymPyDeprecationWarning: 

String fallback in sympify has been deprecated since SymPy 1.6. Use
sympify(str(obj)) or sympy.core.sympify.converter or obj._sympy_
instead. 
```

We should fix this by providing functions with a `_sympy_` method that implements the same conversion as `SympyConverter.composition`.

Also, converting `CallableSymbolicExpression` to sympy forgets about the formal arguments: 

```
sage: from sympy import sympify
sage: f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2; f
(x, y) |--> x^2 + y^2
sage: sympify(f)
x**2 + y**2
```
We change it to return a SymPy `Lambda` instead.
