This is wrong:

```sage
sage: E = EllipticCurve(QQbar, [1,0])
sage: E.multiplication_by_m_isogeny(1).rational_maps()
(x, -y)
```

```sage
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(127), [1,0])
sage: P = E.random_point()
sage: E.multiplication_by_m_isogeny(5)(P)
(15 : 56 : 1)
sage: 5*P
(15 : 71 : 1)
sage: -5*P
(15 : 56 : 1)
sage: E.multiplication_by_m(5) == (-E.multiplication_by_m_isogeny(5)).rational_maps()
True
```

It isn't *consistently* wrong:

```sage
sage: E = EllipticCurve(QQ, [1,0])
sage: E.multiplication_by_m_isogeny(1).rational_maps()
(x, y)
```

---

The trouble is that the method first constructs **an** isogeny with the correct kernel and codomain, then sets the precomputed rational maps. However, the isomorphism to the prescribed codomain is not unique, and picking the wrong one means the resulting isogeny is off by an automorphism — most commonly `[-1]`.

The patch is not pretty, but it seems to fix the issue for now and shouldn't cause any significant slowdowns.
Once (if) #32388 gets in, we should probably instead use an `EllipticCurveHom` subclass specifically for scalar multiplications that imitates a normal isogeny but with different internals. I do have a draft of this ready and it's not only much cleaner, but also resolves part of #8014.
