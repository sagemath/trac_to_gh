# Issue 32251: Fix doctest in the "Y pentamino" example from Donald Knuth

The following doctest for [Tiling Solver](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/tiling.html#donald-knuth-example-the-y-pentamino), which is not tested because it takes a long time, does not agree with the answer returned by Sage.

```
sage: from sage.combinat.tiling import Polyomino, TilingSolver
sage: y = Polyomino([(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0),(2,1)])
sage: T = TilingSolver([y], box=(15,15), reusable=True, reflection=True)
sage: T.number_of_solutions()                      # not tested
212  # sage returns 1696 instead
```

The discrepancy in the two answers stems from whether one counts solutions up to symmetry. More specifically, [Knuth's paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011047.pdf) says there are 212 solutions that "fall into four classes, depending on the behavior at the four corners" (last paragraph of page 12). Fixing the behaviour at the four corners means solutions are counted up to the symmetries of the square. If we do not count solutions up to symmetry, then we get Sage's response of 1696 = 8 * 212.

The 212 in the doctest should replaced with 1696, and a note should be added to explain the (superficial) discrepancy with the answer in Knuth's paper.
