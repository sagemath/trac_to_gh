`get_path_in_displaycoord` was made private in matplotlib 3.5 and its public counterpart was deprecated, which causes a few test failures.

Since this is only used inside a custom hack to circumvent some undesired upstream behavior, it seems to me that using private API here is not that bad. Ideally it should be ported to use public API, but it doesn't seem straightforward.

Updating matplotlib is deferred to a separate ticket, as it needs new dependencies (fonttools) and causes another test failure due to an upstream bug:
