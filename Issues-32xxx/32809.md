The method `._coerce_()` belongs to the deprecated parent `sage.structure.parent_old.Parent`. Nevertheless, it is called in many places in sage source code

This ticket stands for
- replacing `_coerce_() -> coerce()`
- deprecating `_coerce_()`

Ideally, it would be good to have some rings that do not inherit from this old parent class. This is currently impossible : defining a ring as `class MyRing(Parent)` forbid its usage as the base ring of a multivariate polynomial ring, see https://gitlab.com/jo314schmitt/admcycles/-/issues/70.
