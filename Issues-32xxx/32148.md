#28053 added a `__len__` method to propositional formulas, so that `len(f)` would return the length of the formula. However, it was pointed out in #29738 that only containers should have a `len`. So the method should be renamed to `length`.

```
sage: f = propcalc.formula("a -> b")
sage: f.length()
3
```
For now, `__len__` is being retained as an alias.

Keywords: **boolean formula, len, length**
