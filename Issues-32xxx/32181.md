{
    "body": "<a id='comment:12'></a>I took a look through the code, but didn't run the code. \nI have some first comments.\n- The patchbot currently shows 31 doctests failures and 4 lint errors. To be fixed!\n- In the docstrings of `_scan_left_endpoint` and `_scan_right_endpoint`: What does an event mean. Reformat the text after output. Describe the value of delta. Include example(s) where tag is given.\n- `RealSet` constructor with option normalized=True. What does this assume? Describe it in the docstring of `__classcall__`  or that of `RealSet`. Mention that is does not apply to the manifold case. Include doctests/tests where normalized=True is given, and examples where arguments are of type `InternalRealInterval`. \n- I have doubts about where `if not normalized` is treated. (But of course, this depends on how you define normalized=True). I thought if normalized=True and it's not of the manifold case (lines 1267-1283), one can just return `UniqueRepresentation.__classcall__(cls, *intervals)` before line 1199 `intervals = []`, which skips all treatments on args. \n- When normalized is not True, may simplify and insert the code in def normalize here, then remove the normalize function as it is only used once here. Alternatively, keep def normalize and move all treatment of args from `__classcall__` to normalize.\n- `RealSet.__classcall__`: Line 1188-1190 change to just: normalized = kwds.pop('normalized', False). L1194: \"... take no keyword arguments other than 'normalized'.\"\" \n- `RealSet._prep`: L1710 elif. L1717 elif\n- `RealSet` doesn't need methods `_scan_left_endpoint` and `_scan_right_endpoint`. These are methods of the class `InternalRealInterval`. \n- `RealSet._scan_interval` Rename the function, to something like `_scan`, or `_scan_intervals`, or `_generate_events`. Rewrite the function: for i in self._intervals: yield i._scan_left_endpoint(tag); yield i._scan_right_endpoint(tag). No more merge/sorting needed.\n- Ideally, all scan methods are generators. Currently, some are generators, some return lists.\n- In `_scan_line_union`, lines 2104-2122, the two while loops look very suspicious to me. I think they do not belong here. Moreover, the lines 2118-2119 in the second while loop might be wrong. You claimed that these two while loops take care of the special cases RealSet(x=-infinity) and RealSet(x<=-infinity), but the input scan to this function should never be in such form. Such empty (nonsense) special cases should already been eliminated in around line 1209 in `__classcall__`\n- In `union_of_realsets` and other similar functions: Lines 2175 to 2178 can be simplified to `scan = merge(RealSet(s)._scan() for s in real_set_collection)`\n- `_scan_line_intersection`. Add more special examples to doctest to cover the cases where intersection is just one point, or just empty. For example:  `[1,2] \u2229 [2,3]`, `[2,3] \u2229 (3,4)`, `(3,4) \u2229 [4,5)`, `[4,5) \u2229 (5,6)`. Lines 2252-2261 (and other similar places) can be simplified to\n\n```\nif now_on:\n  (on_x, on_epsilon) = (x, epsilon) \nelse: \n  if was_on and (on_x, on_epsilon) < (x, epsilon): \n    yield InternalRealInterval(...)\n  (on_x, on_epsilon) = (None, None)\n```\n- Questions about 'tag'. It is said to be a real number in the docstrings of many function, but is used as True or False for the difference function only. I think tag can be eliminated throughout the code (and do some special treatment for the difference.) Also, why is it called index at some places? That's not used either, so can be removed as well. On a related note, given a collection of real sets, after generating and merging the their scan, you can no longer match the list of events back to the original real sets, because index was not passed to tag in the events. I do not like the current design. \n- `_scan_line_union`, `_scan_line_intersection`, `_scan_line_symmetric_difference` (and part of `are_pairwise_disjoint`) all look redundant. They all can be replaced by a new method `RealSet._scan_to_intervals(scan, indicator)` that takes scan as a generator of sorted events and indicator as a number 1 or n (or perhaps as a lambda function for `are_pairwise_disjoint`), and outputs a tuple intervals of type InternalRealInterval.\n- According to your ticket description, the old union method is slower than the new one.

<a id='comment:12'></a>I took a look through the code, but didn't run the code. 
I have some first comments.
- The patchbot currently shows 31 doctests failures and 4 lint errors. To be fixed!
- In the docstrings of `_scan_left_endpoint` and `_scan_right_endpoint`: What does an event mean. Reformat the text after output. Describe the value of delta. Include example(s) where tag is given.
- `RealSet` constructor with option normalized=True. What does this assume? Describe it in the docstring of `__classcall__`  or that of `RealSet`. Mention that is does not apply to the manifold case. Include doctests/tests where normalized=True is given, and examples where arguments are of type `InternalRealInterval`. 
- I have doubts about where `if not normalized` is treated. (But of course, this depends on how you define normalized=True). I thought if normalized=True and it's not of the manifold case (lines 1267-1283), one can just return `UniqueRepresentation.__classcall__(cls, *intervals)` before line 1199 `intervals = []`, which skips all treatments on args. 
- When normalized is not True, may simplify and insert the code in def normalize here, then remove the normalize function as it is only used once here. Alternatively, keep def normalize and move all treatment of args from `__classcall__` to normalize.
- `RealSet.__classcall__`: Line 1188-1190 change to just: normalized = kwds.pop('normalized', False). L1194: "... take no keyword arguments other than 'normalized'."" 
- `RealSet._prep`: L1710 elif. L1717 elif
- `RealSet` doesn't need methods `_scan_left_endpoint` and `_scan_right_endpoint`. These are methods of the class `InternalRealInterval`. 
- `RealSet._scan_interval` Rename the function, to something like `_scan`, or `_scan_intervals`, or `_generate_events`. Rewrite the function: for i in self._intervals: yield i._scan_left_endpoint(tag); yield i._scan_right_endpoint(tag). No more merge/sorting needed.
- Ideally, all scan methods are generators. Currently, some are generators, some return lists.
- In `_scan_line_union`, lines 2104-2122, the two while loops look very suspicious to me. I think they do not belong here. Moreover, the lines 2118-2119 in the second while loop might be wrong. You claimed that these two while loops take care of the special cases RealSet(x=-infinity) and RealSet(x<=-infinity), but the input scan to this function should never be in such form. Such empty (nonsense) special cases should already been eliminated in around line 1209 in `__classcall__`
- In `union_of_realsets` and other similar functions: Lines 2175 to 2178 can be simplified to `scan = merge(RealSet(s)._scan() for s in real_set_collection)`
- `_scan_line_intersection`. Add more special examples to doctest to cover the cases where intersection is just one point, or just empty. For example:  `[1,2] ∩ [2,3]`, `[2,3] ∩ (3,4)`, `(3,4) ∩ [4,5)`, `[4,5) ∩ (5,6)`. Lines 2252-2261 (and other similar places) can be simplified to

```
if now_on:
  (on_x, on_epsilon) = (x, epsilon) 
else: 
  if was_on and (on_x, on_epsilon) < (x, epsilon): 
    yield InternalRealInterval(...)
  (on_x, on_epsilon) = (None, None)
```
- Questions about 'tag'. It is said to be a real number in the docstrings of many function, but is used as True or False for the difference function only. I think tag can be eliminated throughout the code (and do some special treatment for the difference.) Also, why is it called index at some places? That's not used either, so can be removed as well. On a related note, given a collection of real sets, after generating and merging the their scan, you can no longer match the list of events back to the original real sets, because index was not passed to tag in the events. I do not like the current design. 
- `_scan_line_union`, `_scan_line_intersection`, `_scan_line_symmetric_difference` (and part of `are_pairwise_disjoint`) all look redundant. They all can be replaced by a new method `RealSet._scan_to_intervals(scan, indicator)` that takes scan as a generator of sorted events and indicator as a number 1 or n (or perhaps as a lambda function for `are_pairwise_disjoint`), and outputs a tuple intervals of type InternalRealInterval.
- According to your ticket description, the old union method is slower than the new one. Is this true for the union of two real sets? If so, why is the old one kept in the code? If not, please update the description of the ticket, and include comments in the code. In general, are there examples where the original method is faster? Please specify the examples, and change the code to choose strategically between the two versions according to the input.
- `def convex_hull`: correct but wasteful. One does not to sort all intervals, only the left most and right most intervals of each real set matter.
- `def is_connected` docstring: Return whether ``self`` is a connected set. OUTPUT: Boolean. ``True`` if ``self`` is a single interval.
- `def are_pairwise_disjoint`: Revise.
- Throughout the code, (for example in `_scan_line_union` and `_scan_line_intersection` and many other functions,) the docstrings need significant improvements! The current ones make little sense. They are often copy-pasted from other places which do not correspond to the function.

Some places in the docstrings ":meth:`~sage.sets.real_set.RealSet.convex_hull`"
- Please make sure that your docstrings follow https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html.  
- Throughout the code: clean up the commented-out code.
- Throughout the code: :class:`RealInterval` should be :class:`InternalRealInterval`
- New method: relative closure in a superset?

<a id='comment:36'></a>Thanks for reviewing the ticket! I don't think that the benchmark in the current ticket description makes much sense. I was hoping that Yueqi would be able to provide an updated version and more details soon.

"Connected component" is a property of the set (topological space).

"Normalized form" is a list of intervals. There's no such thing as a connected component of a list.

Before:

```
sage: from itertools import count
sage: c = count()
sage: %timeit RealSet((0, next(c)))
82.9 µs ± 3.75 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)

With this ticket:

```
sage: from itertools import count

sage: %timeit RealSet((0, next(c)))
86.2 µs ± 3.43 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)

+1. Extend `Union` and `Intersection` from pairwise computation to multiple realsets with scan-line algorithm. In order to compare the performance of the scan-line and orginial methods, we use different dataset to test the CPU time the random generator and timing test code can find in this [page](https://github.com/NicoleYueqiLi/sagemath/blob/main/RealsetTestTool.py):

+2. We used scan-line methods to replace the original `normalize` and also make `normalize` optionally. After replacing it, we test it with 500,000 random intervals, the original methods take 151 second to construct it; scan-line methods only took 18 seconds.
+3. Replace `difference`,`symmetric_difference` and `are_pairwise_disjoint` with scan-line methods. We use 1000 realsets each realsets containing 1000 random intervals as the testing dataset. The original methods found the difference between two real sets took 11 seconds on average, and the new methods only took 0.021 seconds on average; symmetric_differnce also has a similar result.
+4. Implement `convex_hull` and `is_connected` in `RealSet`.

I think you can simplify it further by making it 

```
     def intersection(*real_set_collection)
```

When used as a bound method, `RealSet(1, 3).intersection(RealSet(2, 4))`, the ``self`` would just be the first element of ``real_set_collection``.

But it could also be used as an unbound method `RealSet.intersection(RealSet(1, 3), RealSet(2,4))`, and you could also handle the case `RealSet.intersection()`, which should give the real line as the intersection over an empty family

Yes, I think it's fine.

My guess is that it could be improved by a custom version of heapq with a fast path for near-trivial cases, or even cythonized.

Let's keep this for a possible follow-up ticket.
