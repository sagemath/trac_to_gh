<a id='comment:12'></a>I took a look through the code, but didn't run the code. 
I have some first comments.
- The patchbot currently shows 31 doctests failures and 4 lint errors. To be fixed!
- In the docstrings of `_scan_left_endpoint` and `_scan_right_endpoint`: What does an event mean. Reformat the text after output. Describe the value of delta. Include example(s) where tag is given.
- `RealSet` constructor with option normalized=True. What does this assume? Describe it in the docstring of `__classcall__`  or that of `RealSet`. Mention that is does not apply to the manifold case.

```
if now_on:

`i` is just an integer, right? Converting to `bool` is only needed in comparison when you are comparing `SR` elements, which have overloaded comparison operators for forming relational expressions.

Before:

```
sage: from itertools import count

sage: %timeit RealSet((0, next(c)))
82.9 µs ± 3.75 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)

210 µs ± 7.86 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)

With this ticket:

```

86.2 µs ± 3.43 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)

I think you can simplify it further by making it 

```
     def intersection(*real_set_collection)
```

When used as a bound method, `RealSet(1, 3).intersection(RealSet(2, 4))`, the ``self`` would just be the first element of ``real_set_collection``.

But it could also be used as an unbound method `RealSet.intersection(RealSet(1, 3), RealSet(2,4))`, and you could also handle the case `RealSet.intersection()`, which should give the real line as the intersection over an empty family

Yes, I think it's fine.

My guess is that it could be improved by a custom version of heapq with a fast path for near-trivial cases, or even cythonized.

Let's keep this for a possible follow-up ticket.
