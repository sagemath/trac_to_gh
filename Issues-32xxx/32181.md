I took a look through the code, but didn't run the code. 
I have some first comments.
- The patchbot currently shows 31 doctests failures and 4 lint errors. To be fixed!
- In the docstrings of `_scan_left_endpoint` and `_scan_right_endpoint`: What does an event mean. Reformat the text after output. Describe the value of delta. Include example(s) where tag is given.
- `RealSet` constructor with option normalized=True. What does this assume? Describe it in the docstring of `__classcall__`  or that of `RealSet`. Mention that is does not apply to the manifold case. Include doctests/tests where normalized=True is given, and examples where arguments are of type `InternalRealInterval`. 
- I have doubts about where `if not normalized` is treated. (But of course, this depends on how you define normalized=True). I thought if normalized=True and it's not of the manifold case (lines 1267-1283), one can just return `UniqueRepresentation.__classcall__(cls, *intervals)` before line 1199 `intervals = []`, which skips all treatments on args. 
- When normalized is not True, may simplify and insert the code in def normalize here, then remove the normalize function as it is only used once here. Alternatively, keep def normalize and move all treatment of args from `__classcall__` to normalize.
- `RealSet.__classcall__`: Line 1188-1190 change to just: normalized = kwds.pop('normalized', False). L1194: "... take no keyword arguments other than 'normalized'."" 
- `RealSet._prep`: L1710 elif. L1717 elif
- `RealSet` doesn't need methods `_scan_left_endpoint` and `_scan_right_endpoint`. These are methods of the class `InternalRealInterval`. 
- `RealSet._scan_interval` Rename the function, to something like `_scan`, or `_scan_intervals`, or `_generate_events`. Rewrite the function: for i in self._intervals: yield i._scan_left_endpoint(tag); yield i._scan_right_endpoint(tag). No more merge/sorting needed.

```
if now_on:
  (on_x, on_epsilon) = (x, epsilon) 
else: 
  if was_on and (on_x, on_epsilon) < (x, epsilon): 
    yield InternalRealInterval(...)
  (on_x, on_epsilon) = (None, None)

Would it make sense to add the benchmarks mentioned in the ticket description as doctests (can be marked `# not tested` so it does not run automatically)?

The benchmarks are for complicated real sets with many intervals.

Does the new implementation have an overhead over the previous implementation that becomes noticeable for simple real sets with 0, 1, 2, or 5 intervals? That's probably the most common case how this class is used. It would be good to include a benchmark for this.

"Connected component" is a property of the set (topological space).

"Normalized form" is a list of intervals. There's no such thing as a connected component of a list.

`i` is just an integer, right? Converting to `bool` is only needed in comparison when you are comparing `SR` elements, which have overloaded comparison operators for forming relational expressions.

Here's a microbenchmark:

Before:

```
sage: from itertools import count
sage: c = count()
sage: %timeit RealSet((0, next(c)))
82.9 µs ± 3.75 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)
sage: %timeit RealSet((0, next(c))).union([next(c), next(c)])
210 µs ± 7.86 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)
```

With this ticket:

```
sage: from itertools import count
sage: c = count()
sage: %timeit RealSet((0, next(c)))
86.2 µs ± 3.43 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)
sage: %timeit RealSet((0, next(c))).union([next(c), next(c)])
257 µs ± 18.9 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)
```

I think you can simplify it further by making it 

```
     def intersection(*real_set_collection)
```

When used as a bound method, `RealSet(1, 3).intersection(RealSet(2, 4))`, the ``self`` would just be the first element of ``real_set_collection``.

But it could also be used as an unbound method `RealSet.intersection(RealSet(1, 3), RealSet(2,4))`, and you could also handle the case `RealSet.intersection()`, which should give the real line as the intersection over an empty family

Yes, I think it's fine.

My guess is that it could be improved by a custom version of heapq with a fast path for near-trivial cases, or even cythonized.

Let's keep this for a possible follow-up ticket.

Never mind. Without `@`staticmethod, the following can apply.

```
sage: r = RealSet(RealSet(2, 6)[0], RealSet(4, 10)[0], normalized=True)
sage: r
(2, 6) ∪ (4, 10)
sage: r.normalize()
((2, 10),)
```
