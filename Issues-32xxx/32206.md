We register number field elements to `numbers.number` such that

```
sage: import numbers
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: isinstance(a, numbers.Number)
```

will evaluate to true.

One usage of this is that typing can be simplified. In the `geometry/polyhedron` module many times the input will be of the form `numbers.Number` or `Iterable[numbers.Number]`.

If I understand correctly, the numbers ABC should not be used in typing annotations !
