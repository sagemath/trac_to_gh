We register number field elements to `numbers.number` such that

```
sage: import numbers
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: isinstance(a, numbers.Number)
```

will evaluate to true.

One usage of this is that typing can be simplified. In the `geometry/polyhedron` module many times the input will be of the form `numbers.Number` or `Iterable[numbers.Number]`.

see https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#the-numeric-tower

If I understand correctly, the numbers ABC should not be used in typing annotations !

I see, so maybe the other solution I had in mind, makes more sense:

We declare some common sage types (with intuitively clear meaning) for typing. So that you can do something as:

```
from typing import Iterable
from sage.typing import Number
```

The name `Number` needs to be improved of course, so that it is immediately clear, what is meant according to the context. For polyhedra we want something that can be interpreted as real algebraic extension of `QQ`. E.g. `QQ, ZZ, RDF, float, int, rational, AA`. But also things as `NumberField` (and here the class does not imply that this is real). Maybe the name `Real` or `RealType` would work.
