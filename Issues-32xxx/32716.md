Newer versions of `tox` seem to provision python 3.10 when the environment `python` is used, but then our wheels don't necessarily fit.

For this reason, the examples shown in the developer's manual hardcoded the Python version (`tox -e py39`). 

We now define tox environments `sagepython` in `tox.ini`, which takes Python as `SAGE_VENV/bin/python3` and change the manual to use this environment in examples, such as:

```
./bootstrap && ./sage -sh -c '(cd pkgs/sagemath-standard && SAGE_NUM_THREADS=16 tox -v -v -v -e sagepython-sagewheels-nopypi)'
```
(to be run after `make build`)

`src/requirements.txt` is already generated from `src/requirements.txt.m4`

If you mean `build/pkgs/sage_conf/install-requires.txt` and `build/pkgs/sage_setup/install-requires.txt`, yes, that will need a better solution but it's way beyond the scope of this ticket
