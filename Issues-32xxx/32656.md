Our psutil dependency cannot be updated (see #26253) because upstream psutil doesn't support cygwin and has no intention to do so. The psutil module is used only to implement the two functions `get_memory_usage()` and virtual_memory_limit()` in `sage.misc.getusage`. Those functions, in turn, are used only in a few places:

1. Seting some memory limits on GAP.
2. Choosing a max stack size for PARI.
3. Two doctests tests for memory leaks.

None of these applications is critical. Modulo any surprise platform issues, the memory limits that we set are upper limits, and can simply be replaced with large numbers (or no limit).

If they are replaced, and if we forego those two doctests, the entire psutil SPKG can be removed to alleviate the maintenance issues.

These happen only when running the test suite. Running the code directly in a sage session seems to work.

there used to be troubles related to running many GAP sessions in parallel on systems with many cores, one of reasons for computing amount of space to be allocated/promised to GAP was that. 

Would it be more reasonable to update psutil on non-Cygwin systems, and on Cygwin just do not install it, and go with the solution on the branch?

according to the comment in removed in `src/sage/interfaces/gap.py` chunk (added in #13211):

```
-    GAP will only reserve ``size_in_bytes`` address space. Unless you
-    actually start a big GAP computation, the memory will not be
-    used. However, corresponding swap space will be reserved so that
-    GAP will always be able to use the reserved address space if
-    needed. While nothing is actually written to disc as long as you
-    don't run a big GAP computation, the reserved swap space will not
-    be available for other processes.
```
we might be running out of swap space with many Sage/GAP sessions in parallel, if we just promise a lot of RAM.

You might look at  comment 56 and below on  #13211. I am not exactly sure whether we won't be hit with these "halving pool size" messages again; currently GAP's line of code on this is

```
$ grep -R "halving pool size" src/
src/sysmem.c:       if (SyDebugLoading) fputs("gap: halving pool size.\n", stderr);
```
which seems to indicate it's now debugging only - in GAP 4.5.7 (as in #13211) it is unconditional.

Anyhow, it seems that the current branch on a multicore system with many GAPs launched by Sage might have these GAP instances allocated rather different amounts of swap space.

The changes made to GAP and PARI are a bit different. We have to "promise" PARI some amount of RAM, because the upstream interface provides no other way to make the stack a variable size. This branch does change the way we decide how much RAM to promise PARI.

For GAP, deleting the `-o` and `-s` flag in this branch revokes the *existing* promise. Now we promise it nothing. There is however a relevant comment by Volker,

> If you don't specify '-o' then gap will just chose a pool size for you. The virtual memory pool address space can't be changed after GAP has started. The actual memory used can expand and contract. Of course the actual memory used is bounded by the pool size.


That was 9 years ago, and the GAP docs say something completely different (now?). But still we should test this thoroughly. My laptop is probably the oldest machine that anyone actually runs sage on, and I'm about to try it there.

Everything's fine on my laptop as well, all tests passed with `sage -t --long --nthreads 2 --timeout=0 --all --optional=sage,dochtml,optional,build` (a normal `make ptestlong` usually fails due to timeouts).

This is on a two-core 1.8Ghz system with only 3.78GiB of RAM and 1.91GiB of swap.

I'll start the GH actions today to see what happens on non-linux platforms.

You could mimic it in a platform-specific way, but personally I don't think you shouldn't bother. There's no easy "how much memory am I using?" number that can be returned on any modern operating system. Even if there were, trying to retrieve it inside of a REPL for dynamic garbage-collected language would be unreliable.

Instead, `sage -valgrind` is designed to detect exactly these sorts of problems.

Can you suggest a platform-specific way to measure what #31340 is reporting? It claims 48.0MB are leaked, and I wouldn't worry so much about having an exact number than having a number that obviously tends to infinity.

sage -valgrind is nice, but slow. Also, it should've spotted #33081 while fixing #31340 but it seems no one noticed.

In fact I reverted 5cf493c (the fix in #33140) and ran the example there under `sage -valgrind` but nothing shows up. What am I missing?

I'm pretty sure there's a leak here (beta8 + revert 5cf493c):

```

That 3.4G maxresident feels like a leak. Running the same without reverting 5cf493c ends with

```

```
that's just 200M maxresident (the same amount I get when I exit sage without doing any computation, so no leaks there).

It seems to me that `get_memory_usage()` as in #31340 was an easy way to figure this out, and it would be nice to have a suggested alternative for that.

We've just accidentally asked GMP to do something we don't want it to do. In other words, GMP probably still has this stuff on a ledger somewhere, but the bug is that it was written down in the first place, and that's not technically a memory leak (nor is it easy to detect).

The easiest non-portable solution would be... to just use psutil. You can install it on linux/osx with `sage -pip install psutil`, and then to get the same number that `get_memory_usage()` used to return, run

Or to access `/proc` directly:

sage: os.system(f"cat /proc/{os.getpid()}/stat | cut -d' ' -f23")
1635528704
```

> In fact I reverted 5cf493c (the fix in #33140) and ran the example there under sage -valgrind but nothing shows up. What am I missing?


In that case, I don't think there's actually a memory leak (the term is used loosely). We're using the custom GMP allocator that, due to our misuse of the API, is allocating more memory than it should. But that doesn't mean that the memory has been lost. We've just accidentally asked GMP to do something we don't want it to do. In other words, GMP probably still has this stuff on a ledger somewhere, but the bug is that it was written down in the first place, and that's not technically a memory leak (nor is it easy to detect). NB: this is all speculation after a quick glance at the custom allocation code.

Because we felt the functionality here is useless for Sage and for the users, too.
The version we had was old and broken, and an upgrade was impossible due to a Cygwin issue.

I just ran into the same issue, part of my code is now suddenly broken since I used the get_memory_usage function to sometimes print debug statements for memory intensive parts of my code.

The policy on making backward incompatible changes to sage is clearly stated in the sage developers guide https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_in_python.html#deprecation

To quote from there:


    When making a backward-incompatible modification in Sage, the old code should keep working and display a message indicating how it should be updated/written in the future. We call this a deprecation.

    Note: Deprecated code can only be removed one year after the first stable release in which it appeared.

Since `get_memory_usage` was imported into the main name space it is reasonable to assume that there exists user code is using this function. Maybe removing it from sage will not break sage itself, but it is quite likely that this will break user code.

I think personal feelings about which functionality is useful or not in sage shouldn't matter, and we should follow the agreed upon method for decrepation that has been documented in the developers guide. Especially since this used to be a method that was available in the default namespace and hence likely to be discovered by users.

If it turns out that the code is broken on some platforms then we have stopgaps as an agreed upon method to document this: https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/misc/sage/misc/stopgap.html

I think this is not really that infeasible. Are there so much backward incompatible changes being made nowadays? I know when I was still more active a developer most tickets would either introduce new functionality. Make code that previously incorrectly was raising an error now return the correct result, or fix bugs that caused a function that previously returned mathematically incorrect result, to now return the correct result.

Well, the policy currently already is quite specific on removing names from the global namespace. (although it only says something about keeping the functionality available with an explicit import).

I think making it return a random natural number and print a warning that it does this indeed would be better. Or even just make it raise an error instead of returning a random number. Right now even:

    from sage.all import get_memory_usage

fails. So even if most of the code paths in a project don't end up calling `get_memory_usage`, just the fact that it has disappeared from the global namespace might brake a lot of functionality in downstream packages. Additionally having wrongly working function with a warning, allows people to change their code when they have the time instead of having to fix it right now.

Note one important thing about the current deprecation policy is that the warning should tell how to fix issues with the current use of the code. Right now people will just be hit with an import error or a name error unsure what to do. We also want other people who might not find this trac ticket on their own, to know that the intended fix is just to not use "get_memory_usage" anymore is the intended fix.

This sounds like a plan, I'm for it and I think it would be good to start a discussion on sage-devel about this. However, whatever we do, I think we should keep printing usefull error message when removing functionality (and maybe throwing usefull error messages) for things that used to be in the global namespace. For example python uses semantic versioning, but in python 3.10 you still get:

    In [1]: print "test"
      File "<ipython-input-1-39a3758a853a>", line 1
        print "test"
              ^
    SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print("test")?

Both which are not considered backward incompatible changes. Although fixing mathematically wrong answers strictly speaking can sometimes be backward incompatible, I know that in the past this used to not be threated as such in applying this rule.\n\n\nThat's the crux of the problem. What's a backwards-incompatible change? There are several classes; to name a few:\n\n* API changes (removals, renames)\n* ABI (cython) changes\n* Return value, exception, and argument type changes\n* Behavior or value-level changes\n\nAll of those are backwards-incompatible in some sense, and the developer's guide doesn't specify. For an example, I recently fixed a bug where `cholesky()` would incorrectly factorize a matrix that isn't positive-definite. Now it raises an error stating that the matrix isn't positive-definite. If your code calls `cholesky()` on such a matrix and doesn't catch the new error, it will crash. That's clearly backwards-incompatible.\n\nShould we leave the bug in sage for a year? I don't think that approach would get us very far. A priori it lets bugs be introduced immediately, but requires a one-year waiting period to fix them, so the number of bugs will grow uncontrollably. And then there's the difficulty of trying to coordinate merge conflicts with thousands of tickets slated to be merged 1+ years in the future.\n\n\n> > 3.

Or even just make it raise an error instead of returning a random number.\n\n\nGranted that in this case I should have added an custom error and/or migration hints in the release tour. But in general, this is a dangerous thing to do. What if someone is publishing results from sage, and they find out that the code has been changed to return (type-compatible) garbage?\n\nIf the code is changed to return wrong results but not crash, then users first have to debug the problem, and then still solve it by figuring out what else to use. In particular it will usually waste more of their time than an error would, as the latter avoids the debugging step.",

Although fixing mathematically wrong answers strictly speaking can sometimes be backward incompatible, I know that in the past this used to not be threated as such in applying this rule.


That's the crux of the problem. What's a backwards-incompatible change? There are several classes; to name a few:

* API changes (removals, renames)
* ABI (cython) changes
* Return value, exception, and argument type changes
* Behavior or value-level changes

All of those are backwards-incompatible in some sense, and the developer's guide doesn't specify. For an example, I recently fixed a bug where `cholesky()` would incorrectly factorize a matrix that isn't positive-definite. Now it raises an error stating that the matrix isn't positive-definite. If your code calls `cholesky()` on such a matrix and doesn't catch the new error, it will crash. That's clearly backwards-incompatible.

Should we leave the bug in sage for a year? I don't think that approach would get us very far. A priori it lets bugs be introduced immediately, but requires a one-year waiting period to fix them, so the number of bugs will grow uncontrollably. And then there's the difficulty of trying to coordinate merge conflicts with thousands of tickets slated to be merged 1+ years in the future.

Granted that in this case I should have added an custom error and/or migration hints in the release tour. But in general, this is a dangerous thing to do. What if someone is publishing results from sage, and they find out that the code has been changed to return (type-compatible) garbage?

If the code is changed to return wrong results but not crash, then users first have to debug the problem, and then still solve it by figuring out what else to use. In particular it will usually waste more of their time than an error would, as the latter avoids the debugging step.

I just ran into get_memory_usage() suddenly vanishing. It is part of our public API and something I have used all the time since I wrote it 17 years ago (and for years earlier on Magma).  Bring it back. Gees.  If it doesn't work on cygwin, just replace it with an error there.

Having get_memory_usage as a top level function fits with our mission statement very well, given that it is a function in Magma.  The workarounds suggested above are too complicated to remember, etc. 

The argument in the description of this ticket aren't convincing to me:

1. "upstream psutil doesn't support cygwin and has no intention to do so."

Just don't support it on cygwin.  Put in some fallback functionality. 


2. "Those functions, in turn, are used only in a few places:"

They are part of the public API of Sage, so could be used in thousands of places we can't change.

I've created #33637.

I would be perfectly happy with a version of this function that only works on Linux and throws an error everywhere else.
