Ticket #29555 made openssl a standard package and
upgraded to OpenSSL 3.0.0-alpha11, still in alpha
stage but now under Apache license while OpenSSL
1.x versions were not GPL compatible.

Since #30557 added an spkg-configure.m4 file
for openssl, that prerelease version only gets
installed if no system version is detected.

Ticket #31439 upgraded to OpenSSL 3.0.0-alpha12.

OpenSSL 3.0.0 has now entered beta stage, and the
release announcement for OpenSSL 3.0.0-beta1 says
this should be considered a release candidate,
and invites to test widely.

- https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2021/06/17/OpenSSL3.0ReleaseCandidate/

OpenSSL 3.0.0-beta2 was released 2021-07-29.
We upgrade to that version.
