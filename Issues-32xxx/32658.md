When using the empty face for #29811, it should be undefined, but instead, it returns the original polyhedron.

Example:

```
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(2)
sage: P.Hrepresentation()
(An inequality (-1, 0) x + 1 >= 0,
 An inequality (0, -1) x + 1 >= 0,
 An inequality (1, 0) x + 1 >= 0,
 An inequality (0, 1) x + 1 >= 0)
sage: P.face_lattice()[0]
A -1-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^2
sage: P.face_lattice()[0].affine_tangent_cone().Hrepresentation()
(An inequality (-1, 0) x + 1 >= 0,
 An inequality (0, -1) x + 1 >= 0,
 An inequality (1, 0) x + 1 >= 0,
 An inequality (0, 1) x + 1 >= 0)
```

I would say that this sentence does not define anything for the empty case, because "the" cone at "any" point of the empty set is undefined.
