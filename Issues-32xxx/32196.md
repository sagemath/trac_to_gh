The current configuration for calling information from GAP only allows for you to call one group at a time, but we aim to allow for lists of groups which meet certain parameters. The group properties we aim to address include abelian, solvable, nilpotent, given order, dihedral, semi-direct products, alternating, symmetric, and simple.

I don't think this is reasonable code to be included in sage.
- What is a point of a function returning strings representing (ambiguously) groups?
- Relying on string parsing to study group structures is a very fragile approach. More importantly, the implementation is wrong : the presence of `x` in the name does not guarantee that it is a non-trivial direct product (ie `(C4 x C2) : C2`)

It does make sense to have nicer group iterators. However the proposed approach is very wrong for the above reasons. Unless the branch is completely rewritten, it makes more sense to me to close this ticket.

Completely agree. When I suggested this project for [GSoc 2021](https://wiki.sagemath.org/GSoC/2021#Implement_Small_Groups), this was the intention. The interface could be something along `SmallGroups(60, nilpotent=True, type="premutation")` for an object that can iterate over all nilpotent groups of order 60, say sorted by GAP ID, returning Sage's `PermutationGroup`. Unless there is another way I do not know about, it is cumbersome to produce such lists in Sage.

For the implementation, now there is [ConditionSet](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/sets/sage/sets/condition_set.html#sage.sets.condition_set.ConditionSet), which was not available back then. Maybe such a `SmallGroups` class can inherit from `ConditionSet`, adding the information the SmallGrp GAP package provides such as cardinality and short summery as in `libgap.SmallGroupsInformation()` (which is not tab-completed for `libgap`, but it is for `gap`). Note that there are certain properties of a "small" group, like if it is abelian, nilpotent, solvable and so on, that are precomputed in SmallGrp. The ticket should be about creating a pythonic/Sage wrapper for SmallGrp.

It was unclear what the desired end result was from the limited description given for the GSOC project, so Alexis took the liberty of deciding what should be done.

Given this longer description of the desired result, I see that we did not satisfy what you wanted for the GSOC project.

It sounds like a louder vote is for this code to not be included in the Sage library, that is fine. In that case, I would say someone should flip this back to needs work and modify the ticket description to a more explicit explanation of the desired result. 

Alexis also wrote examples: https://wiki.sagemath.org/interact/groups 
that students could use before this code was integrated in to Sage.
