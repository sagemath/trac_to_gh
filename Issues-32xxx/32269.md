The code:

```
K.<a> = QuadraticField(-11)
E = EllipticCurve(K, [0,1,0,-117,-541])
E.isogenies_prime_degree(53)
```
returns an empty list. But, since E has CM by the ring of integers of K, it has to have an isogeny of degree p for p splitting in K, so this doesn't make sense.

If you import isogenies_prime_degree_general from isogeny_small_degree.py then 

```
isogenies_prime_degree_general(E,53) 
```
correctly returns 

```
[Isogeny of degree 53 from Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x^2 + (-117)*x + (-541) over Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 11 with a = 3.316624790355400?*I to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x^2 + (98560*a+42123)*x + (-12561472*a-61946205) over Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 11 with a = 3.316624790355400?*I,

LGTM, but that test with `ell = 53` is not going to fly.

Why not `ell = 37`? it is equally broken and takes 1/6 of the time.
