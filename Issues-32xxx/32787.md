```
sage: A = matrix(GF(11), [[2,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,1,-1]])
sage: A.eigenvalues(extend=False)  # correct
[2]
sage: A.eigenvalues()              # correct
[2, z2 + 9, 10*z2 + 2]
sage: A.eigenvalues(extend=False)  # wrong
[]
```
This affects eigenvalues over finite fields and is probably a caching issue (possibly related to #11596).
