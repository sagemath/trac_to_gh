For a number field `K` and an integer `n`,
the function `K.elements_of_norm(n)` returns
a list of integral elements of `K` with norm `n`,
up to multiplication by units of positive norm.
The docstring says that `n` should be an "integer
in this number field", which is wrong (and makes
no sense): it must be a rational integer.

If you give the function something else (e.g. a
non-integral rational or an element of `K` (even
`K(0)`), a `PariError` is raised, and it would be
better for Sage to check the input, say by trying
`n = ZZ(n)` first.

Thanks. I report things and then simply forget.


I'm not familiar with the syntax --> list in the function header. Is that a new python thing?

This is a "type annotation". This means that it is a declaration stating that the output is a list.

This kind of annotation (optional) has been introduced in recent versions of python. It allows some tools (mypy) to check consistency inside the code. Also useful for refined tab completions, in principle.

The lights are green, so the branch is ready for review.
