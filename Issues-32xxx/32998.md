The docker/Dockerfile uses a multi-stage approach to build several related images. However, something is broken since every SPKG is built (at least) twice during a run of .ci/build-docker.sh.

As a result, building docker images takes a very long time and, with this bug, likely exceeds the limits of most CI providers.

The wish for to the sagemath-dev image being the actual distribution makes sense.

For the regular sagemath image this wish is I guess less relevant, but having two different build setups for the sagemath-dev and sagemath image doesn't really makes sense to me, since it will mean more maintenance. 

The time limit for ci jobs on github is 6 hours per job for what it is worth.

There are many packages that change quite infrequently, yet take lot of time to build.

If there is an image only allowing changes in sagelib, it would already be quite useful.

As well, I don't even understand why using system packages is any different - do you mean to say that docker images don't allow monkey-patching?

No. The [GitLab](GitLab) CI setup supports (modulo this very issue here) incremental builds. So, the idea was that you can perform an SPKG change in a ticket here (something which the patchbot does afaik not support.)

That docker image can then be tested with tools such as https://gitlab.com/sagemath/gitlab-sage which is deployed here at the moment: https://gitlab-hooks-flau3jeaza-ew.a.run.app/

An actual demo of this would be the (outdated) build for #28466 at https://gitlab-hooks-flau3jeaza-ew.a.run.app/status/trac/branch/u%2Fgalois%2Fmrs%2F32%2Fgeneral-extensions but it works equally for any other branch. (i.e., it doesn't because the [GitLab](GitLab) builds are not functional at the moment.)

Of course this also works for non-SPKG changes. The idea was to be able to better review changes proposed on a ticket without having to run the rebuild of [SageMath](SageMath) locally. However, in the end there was not that much interest in this feature.
