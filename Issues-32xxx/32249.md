A graded-commutative ring is a mildly noncommutative ring in which `x*y = (-1)**(x.deg()*y.deg())*y*x` for the right notion of degree. This ticket aims to implement ideals of graded-commutative rings inside of `sage.rings.noncommutative_ideals` via the class `Ideal_gc`.

Searching on google for the synonymous term "graded-commutative" returns "About 5,310,000 results" whereas for "supercommutative" it returns "About 13,400 results". This suggests to me that the former is the more entrenched term and therefore is probably the one to use in a general-purpose CAS such as sage.

From my understanding, the concepts are very closely related, but not quite the same. Superalgebras are one generalization of supercommutative algebras and graded-commutative algebras are different generalizations of supercommutative algebras where we have finer information about what products look like.

It would be correct to say that a supercommutative algebra (also known as a "commutative superalgebra" although the algebra need not satisfy *ab=ba* so I would suggest we use supercommutative) is a graded commutative algebra where the grading is given by **Z/2Z**. It certainly would be good to include this in the documentation, thanks for the suggestion.

A graded commutative algebra (as defined here) with G=**Z** grading is a G-graded supercommutative superalgebra with the **Z**/2**Z** grading (for the superalgebra part) induced from the natural quotient map of the gradings. For a multigraded case, this also holds but we take the sum of the degrees (as explained in the documentation).

Thus a graded commutative algebra is a special case of a superalgebra, but superalgebras do not necessarily have to be graded nor supercommutative.
