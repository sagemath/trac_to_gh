A graded-commutative ring is a mildly noncommutative ring in which `x*y = (-1)**(x.deg()*y.deg())*y*x` for the right notion of degree. This ticket aims to implement ideals of graded-commutative rings inside of `sage.rings.noncommutative_ideals` via the class `Ideal_gc`.

Searching on google for the synonymous term "graded-commutative" returns "About 5,310,000 results" whereas for "supercommutative" it returns "About 13,400 results". This suggests to me that the former is the more entrenched term and therefore is probably the one to use in a general-purpose CAS such as sage.

For Gröbner bases, it might be worth looking at the unfinished #31446 where they are computed using the GAP package [GBNP](https://gap-packages.github.io/gbnp/).

It would be correct to say that a supercommutative algebra (also known as a "commutative superalgebra" although the algebra need not satisfy *ab=ba* so I would suggest we use supercommutative) is a graded commutative algebra where the grading is given by **Z/2Z**. It certainly would be good to include this in the documentation, thanks for the suggestion.

<a id='comment:14'>Comment 14:</a>
A graded commutative algebra (as defined here) with G=**Z** grading is a G-graded supercommutative superalgebra with the **Z**/2**Z** grading (for the superalgebra part) induced from the natural quotient map of the gradings. For a multigraded case, this also holds but we take the sum of the degrees (as explained in the documentation).

Thus a graded commutative algebra is a special case of a superalgebra, but superalgebras do not necessarily have to be graded nor supercommutative.
