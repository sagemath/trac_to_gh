The new classes `Polynomial` and `MPolynomial` are ABCs with a unique direct subclass (see Meta-ticket #32414 and https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging_sage_library.html#module-level-runtime-dependencies for this design pattern). Their purpose is that `isinstance(x, sage.structure.element.[M]Polynomial)` replaces the use of `is_Polynomial`, `is_MPolynomial` (deprecated here).

The new class `InfinitePolynomial` is also an ABC with a unique direct subclass. We introduce it here although there is currently no use of `isinstance(x, InfinitePolynomial...)` in the library.

The new class `CommutativePolynomial` is an ABC that is a common base of `Polynomial`, `MPolynomial`, and `InfinitePolynomial`. We introduce it here although there is currently no use for `isinstance(x, CommutativePolynomial)` in the library.

We also make `sage.rings.polynomial` a namespace package; this is needed because element implementations depend on various libraries.

<a id='comment:34'>Comment 34:</a>
I don't think we want a special ABC for the "infinite" polynomial as the name suggests they are formal power series, and the ring is not different at an abstract level (just in implementation) from a usual multivariate polynomial.

We probably should also update the hierarchy documentation at the top of `element.pyx`.

That was not clear before. I think we should have a proper ABC, in the actual sense of the term, for (multivariate) polynomials.

That also brings about another maintenance burden: we are manually having to update the class hierarchy documentation. Although because they are 1-1 with more concrete implementations, they shouldn't appear there.

We need another term other than ABC for such classes. Maybe adding an adjective.

We also need to have criteria/rules for when we need to add such a class and when not.

How do you plan to deal with multiple inheritance with Cython:

```
A < B
|   |
a < b
```
where `A,B` are the 1-1ABCs and `a` and `b` are the (more) concrete classes.

That I am creating ABCDEFITs here and in the tickets of #32414 is basically to limit the scope of the tickets. There is nothing that would stop us from upgrading an ABCDEFIT to a "proper" ABC at some point in the future when there is a need for that. In this case we would remove the uniqueness doctest.

But to do that, don't we need to add an additional proper ABC on top of the ABCDEFIT?

I still do not see why the `InfinitePolynomialRing` deserves special treatment. Also why does it not inherit from a proper `MPolynomial` ABC?

I don't know why the implementation class `InfinitePolynomial_sparse` is not a subclass of the implementation class `MPolynomial`, but it isn't.

I guess that is the point I am a bit confused about. Why can't the `MPolynomial` in `element.pyx` be also used as a base class for `InfinitePolynomial_sparse`.

But let's assume that `MPolynomial` is an ABCDEFIT.

Why not do the same thing for, say, the libsingular polynomials (in this case, this is explicitly tested against in the `algebras/fusion_ring` code)?

My guess is that there are a few methods that assume that the ring is finitely generated (e.g., `gradient()`) and nobody thought to bring these together beforehand. Some slight refactoring would be needed, but it shouldn't be too hard.

Right, I do see the `isinstance(fvar, MPolynomial_libsingular)` in `src/sage/algebras/fusion_rings/shm_managers.pyx`, and this isinstance test also shows up in a bunch of random modules elsewhere.
From a quick look it is likely that indeed it would also be good to introduce an ABCDEFIT for it to get rid of this obstacle to modularization.

If you don't mind doing it, then please go ahead. It would definitely be nice to factor out the `InfinitePolynomial_*` into a common ABC. I think it helps make clear about when to include ABCDEFITs.

I am happy to do some extra reviewing. It might be more of a hassle to split off the new parts into a separate ticket.
