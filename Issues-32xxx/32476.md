`git grep 'def copy'` reveals a number of classes that define ad-hoc `copy` methods but not `__copy__` methods. Hence, they do not implement the copy protocol https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html, so `copy.copy` will resort to pickling/unpickling for making a copy.

`Components.copy`, for example, implements an ad-hoc version of a deepcopy of sorts:

```
        for ind, val in self._comp.items():
            if isinstance(val, SageObject) and hasattr(val, 'copy'):
                result._comp[ind] = val.copy()
            else:
                result._comp[ind] = val
```

For classes whose instances are immutable, see #13811 instead.
