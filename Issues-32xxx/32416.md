(and except `sage.geometry.riemannian_manifolds`, which is removed in #32228)

Similar to what is done in #32411.

This is part of Meta-ticket #29705 (modularization) - to remove unnecessary dependencies on the distribution sagemath-symbolics (#31695)

I'm working on this at the moment. Using `sympy.symbols` is ok, right?
Probably yes, because `geometry` depends on `categories.sets_cat`, which depends on `sympy`.

I'm just too lazy to reinvent the wheel and was looking for something that prints linear combinations of symbolic variables as well. Of course it is not too hard to write this yourself...

This is a partial solution.

- Some doctests need to be marked optional yet. In this ticket?
- `sage.geometry.polyhedron.base.Polyhedron_base.affine_hull_manifold` is missing yet.
- `sage.geometry.hyperplane_arrangement.plot` is missing. Not sure that this even works.

We don't really have "optional" tags for things like `sagemath_symbolics` yet. You could add it to the beginning of `sage.doctest.control` (`auto_optional_tags`) but a more general solution is needed in the long term, see #30746
