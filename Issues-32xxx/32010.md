we probably need to overhaul Homebrew actions quite a bit. There are various obsolete things, e.g. a  macOS version is 11.0 instead of 11, something funny with an old version 11.7 of xcode, etc...

It seems to me that Homebrew packages need explicit installation, too.

Is this why `cython` is failing to compile with messages like

```
  clang: warning: no such sysroot directory: '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.sdk' [-Wmissing-sysroot]
```
(Failing with homebrew's Python 3, builds okay with /usr/bin/python3.)
