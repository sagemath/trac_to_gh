After this change, only `./configure` will pick up these variables from the environment.

This is an incompatible change to long-standing behavior of Sage, but the change will bring the build system in line with autotools and avoid confusing failures.

Overriding CC, CFLAGS, ... will still be possible by passing them as makefile variables on the command line (`make CFLAGS="-gggg" build`)

so e.g. `FC=footran ./configure`
will have no effect?

This will need a bit of testing, as, iirc, some packages really need env vars set.

No, `FC=footran ./configure` (or `./configure FC=footran`) will of course use the variable.

But `FC=footran make` will not use the variable (except if it invokes `./configure --recheck`).

I don't understand. What do you think the correct comment would be?

Currently, `$CC`, `$FC`, `$CXX` are picked up for any use of `sage -...` and `make ...`.
The first modification is only possible with make (or in `sage --buildsh` and `sage -sh` after having started it).
