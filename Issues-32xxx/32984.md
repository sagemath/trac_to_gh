Matrices have methods `_row_ambient_module`/`_column_ambient_module` (in `matrix2.pyx`) which are useful... but
- arguments are inconsistent
- I am not sure there is a need to cache the result when a different base ring is used (see also #32901)

In this ticket
- we fix the above
- make these methods public and deprecate the underscore versions
- move them to `matrix1.pyx`

While doing so, we need to pay attention to possible speed regression after #32901, #32902 and #32903.

Depends on #32901
Depends on #32902
Depends on #32903

I must have missed this in the ticket list, and have unfortunately reviewed the conflicting #32901, #32902, and #32903 first.

Do we need the deprecations for private underscore methods? They should only be used internally, where we can update the name ourselves.

Why'd you have to move them from matrix2 to matrix1?

I really don't think you should bother with a deprecation for the internal underscore method. They're not listed in the tab-completion, and are typically "use at your own risk" in any python project. Removing them will just waste 15 minutes of someone's time a year from now.

Because it is used in the methods `row` and `column` inside `matrix1.pyx`

This method with underscore is precious and used in my own project. I would prefer seeing a deprecation with a pointer to this ticket rather than an `AttributeError` with no explanation at all.
