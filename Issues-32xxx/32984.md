Matrices have methods `_row_ambient_module`/`_column_ambient_module` (in `matrix2.pyx`) which are useful... but
- arguments are inconsistent
- I am not sure there is a need to cache the result when a different base ring is used (see also #32901)

In this ticket
- we fix the above
- make these methods public and deprecate the underscore versions
- move them to `matrix1.pyx`

While doing so, we need to pay attention to possible speed regression after #32901, #32902 and #32903.
