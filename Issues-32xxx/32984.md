```
Matrices have methods `_row_ambient_module`/`_column_ambient_module` (in `matrix2.pyx`) which are useful... but
- arguments are inconsistent
- I am not sure there is a need to cache the result when a different base ring is used (see also #32901)

In this ticket
- we fix the above
- make these methods public and deprecate the underscore versions
- move them to `matrix1.pyx`

While doing so, we need to pay attention to possible speed regression after #32901, #32902 and #32903.

Do we need the deprecations for private underscore methods? They should only be used internally, where we can update the name ourselves.

I really don't think you should bother with a deprecation for the internal underscore method. They're not listed in the tab-completion, and are typically "use at your own risk" in any python project. Removing them will just waste 15 minutes of someone's time a year from now.

This method with underscore is precious and used in my own project. I would prefer seeing a deprecation with a pointer to this ticket rather than an `AttributeError` with no explanation at all.
