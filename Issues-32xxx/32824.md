As reported on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/65llNKdXo3E), the kernel of non-commutative ring homorphisms is not computed correctly. Since the implementation was not intended for this case, this ticket turns this into an error instead:

```
sage: A.<a1,a2> = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(QQ, degrees=(1,1))
sage: B.<b1,b2> = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(QQ, degrees=(1,1))
sage: f = A.hom([b1, b1+b2], codomain=B)
sage: f.kernel()  # a1*a2 is not in the kernel
Twosided Ideal (0, a1*a2, 0) of Graded Commutative Algebra with generators ('a1', 'a2') in degrees (1, 1) over Rational Field
```
