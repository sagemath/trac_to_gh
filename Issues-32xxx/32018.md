    "body": "<a id='comment:9'></a>This looks fine. One comment: in the test, we're testing float output *exactly*. It's generally more robust to not depend on *all* digits being correct when testing float output. In this case, however, we're testing output where we know it's been computed with specified precision and with specified formulas (although that could change ...), so if mpfr properly implements IEEE then all the bits of the output (and therefore the representing string) should be determined too. So for this example I think it's OK. In general, however, you should probably use ellipses or a `#tol` marker to allow for some variation in the last digits.
