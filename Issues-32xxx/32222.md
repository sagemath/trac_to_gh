CC:  @mkoeppe @tscrim @dimpase

Part of #32191 (Meta-ticket: Audit/fix all uses of MixedIntegerLinearProgram in sage.combinat, sage.graphs).

On the way, we add missing parameters to select the solver and its level of verbosity.

Looks good but I'm not sure if the `verbosity`/`verbose` renaming can be done without deprecation

I'm not sure It's the best way to add a deprecation warning, but this way we can use both.

Right, it's simpler like that.

I remove parameter `solver_verbose` that I introduced earlier because I think it's not useful to add yet another parameter about verbosity.
