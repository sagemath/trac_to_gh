[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) allows one to setup a complete dev environment in the cloud. It is free to use for up to 50 hours per month. In this ticket the config necessary for making this work with sagemath is added. 

You can try this out by going to https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/tree/public/build%2Fgitpod. 

It currently takes a bit more than 1 hour until everything is setup.

Normally, the prebuilds are build centrally by a github application that notifies gitpod about changes to certain branches (currently only the default branch). These prebuilds are then used by everyone that starts a new environment based on these branches.

But you do can share a workspace, see https://www.gitpod.io/docs/sharing-and-collaboration. Thus, say you update a dependency in a workspace and this leads to errors, then you can make a snapshot and share it with other developers so that can investigate the issue.

Could you please expand on this idea. Since the current code already use the `prefix` idea:
> RUN ./configure --prefix=/home/gitpod/sage-prebuild

Note also that the final build (in gitpod.yml) should preferably use a normal build (without a special prefix) to be as close as possible to a "normal" dev setup.

It's only slow currently as the whole build of sage is triggered everytime a workspace is started. Once this ticket is merged, one could activate gitpods 'prebuild' feature that does this in the background automatically, so that starting the workspace is a matter of seconds (which are mainly spent to load the custom docker image + the prebuild files).

Change this to `./configure --prefix=/home/gitpod/sage-local`

and change `./configure -enable-editable` in `.gitpod.yml` to `./configure --prefix=/home/gitpod/sage-local --enable-editable`

Sadly gitpod only preserves changes to the workspace folder during prebuilds, so the the `make` in `.gitpod.yml` needs to write everything in the local workspace folder and not in some global/system folder. https://www.gitpod.io/docs/prebuilds#workspace-directory-only",

That's a good suggestion. Sadly gitpod only preserves changes to the workspace folder during prebuilds, so the the `make` in `.gitpod.yml` needs to write everything in the local workspace folder and not in some global/system folder. https://www.gitpod.io/docs/prebuilds#workspace-directory-only

First of all, the end goal is different: the gitpod docker serves as a developer enviroment, and the existing docker config is a means to distribute sage.

The "workspace" is in `/workspace/sagetrac-mirror`, and only changes to this folder are preserved in prebuilds. On the other hand, the docker image can change system folders such as `/home/gitpod` and those changes are accessible during the prebuild. I couldn't find out a way to change something in `/workspace` using the docker image (gitpod also handles the git checkout for you etc).

What needs to be done is to activate the gitpod app for github on the org level. This could be done also before this ticket is merged, but I'm not sure if it would pick up the gitpod config or if that one needs to be present in the default branch.

The prebuild can be configured to run for certain branches, see https://www.gitpod.io/docs/prebuilds#github-specific-configuration. Currently, it uses the default config which enables prebuilds only for the default branch (= develop).

Yes, because it avoids the complexity - visible to developers - of having a third tier of packages between system packages and SPKGs.

Apart from these details:

Even with the 1 hour saved by pushing package builds into the prebuild phase saved, the initialization of the workspace still takes much too long for this whole thing to be convenient enough.

I see two directions how to fix this:
- Orchestrate the prebuild on our own on GH Actions - so that we are not constrained by the gitpod time limit of 1h. This could maybe use the incremental build infrastructure from our `docker/Dockerfile` (`sagemath-dev`) -- just replacing `FROM ubuntu:focal as run-time-dependencies` by `FROM gitpod/workspace-full`... 

- Use conda to provide most packages. Then the prebuild easily fits into the 1 hour time limit.

It's probably a question of what a "workspace" folder is, but at least only `/workspace/sagetrac-mirror` was shown in the right source file browser. Of course everything in `/workspace` is available but people need to use bash commands to investigate it. Then one could also put sage-local directly in `/home/gitpod/sage-local`.

> Would https://www.gitpod.io/docs/prebuilds#manual-prebuilds work, or does this also depend on the org-level activation?

I tried this now, but after about 40 mins it displays the following error:

```

<html><head>
            <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8">

                                                                      </body></html>

```

I'm not sure if that's an issue with gitpod or something going wrong in sage's build script. According to the logs, matplotlib, scipy, fpylll, sagelib and were still compiling when this error is displayed. Do you have a guess where this message is coming from?

Thanks for the pointer. Nix seems promising indeed, but I think it would make sense to first create a workable nix environment (e.g. `shell.nix` file) and test it for 'normal' local building before using for gitpod.

The approach with prefix + symlink was not working for me. Every prebuild that I triggered timed-out without any error message; also when running it from my own fork using the gitpod app integration. I guess something from the gitpod build context slips into the image/prebuild setup. Thus, I've reverted to use of the prebuild of system packages in `home/gitpod/sage-prebuild` and setting env variables so that the prebuild packages are found. That works. Interestingly, this is somewhat similar to how nix works. Current state can be found at https://github.com/tobiasdiez/sagetrac-mirror.

During the docker build it suggests to install the following packages

```
sudo apt-get install  libflint-arb-dev libcdd-dev libcdd-tools ecl libec-dev eclib-tools libflint-dev flintqs libgiac-dev xcas lcalc liblfunction-dev pari-gp2c libpari-dev pari-doc pari-elldata pari-galdata pari-galpol pari-seadata libprimesieve-dev singular libsingular4-dev tox
```
Some are excluded (like pari and flint) but other would make sense to install I guess. Should I try manually adding them, or should the `sage-get-system-packages` command perhaps be changed?

We now have three possible options for the gitpod integration and before we invest more time working on them separately it is probably worthwhile to choose on one of them to proceed further:
- 1) Only use the gitpod infrastructure to build docker images (non-python packages) and prebuilds (python packages). This is the current version of this ticket.
- 2) Use github action to build a docker image containing all sage packages. This is #33103.
- 3) Use version 1, but install non-python packages using nix.

However, that approach has a few disadvantages as far as I can see:\n- The relevant github action might only be triggered after quite some time upon a new (beta) relase as all other github workflows are then also triggered. During this time one would still use the old docker image.\n- The docker image is quite big and thus it takes longer to open a new gitpod workspace.\n- It is harder to add gitpod-specific customization to the docker image (e.g. installing tools that are only needed in this context).\n\nThese are certainly not deal breakers but should be kept in mind.\n\nThe first approach has also a few disadvantages:\n- Currently less packages are built due to the gitpod timeout of 1h\n- Not automatically tested (although this would probably be easy to do)",

Is fine with me. However, that approach has a few disadvantages as far as I can see:
- The relevant github action might only be triggered after quite some time upon a new (beta) relase as all other github workflows are then also triggered. During this time one would still use the old docker image.
- The docker image is quite big and thus it takes longer to open a new gitpod workspace.
- It is harder to add gitpod-specific customization to the docker image (e.g. installing tools that are only needed in this context).

These are certainly not deal breakers but should be kept in mind.

The first approach has also a few disadvantages:
- Currently less packages are built due to the gitpod timeout of 1h
- Not automatically tested (although this would probably be easy to do)
