While setting things up, I noticed a few issues. Not sure if they are known problems or even by design. Please let me know if I should open a ticket for them to improve things.
- gitpod has brew installed on linux by default. Sagemath thinks this is the primary package manager and, e.g., configure suggests to run `brew xyz` to install new packages. Is brew indeed preferred over apt-get? This is now #32753.
- gitpod comes also with pyenv preinstalled. This breaks the build unless one sets `pyenv global system`. Otherwise all python packages will be installed in the python env set by pyenv. This is now  #29285.

That might indeed something to consider. I would keep it for now using plain ubuntu to get some experience how it goes with the prebuilt. We can change it to conda later if necessary.

I can confirm this. 

I also sometimes had other problems with re-started workspaces. For example, when the build was interrupted then next time `make` tried to install packages (e.g. python) that were using system packages during the first run and thus didn't needed to run. I'm not sure ifs a bug with gitpod (i.e. some important files are not correctly restored) or an issue with sage's build system. Do you have an idea what's going wrong?

If you want to use VS codes Jupyter notebook integration, jupyter needs to be installed in the venv used.

Change this to `./configure --prefix=/home/gitpod/sage-local`

and change `./configure -enable-editable` in `.gitpod.yml` to `./configure --prefix=/home/gitpod/sage-local --enable-editable`

The "workspace" is in `/workspace/sagetrac-mirror`, and only changes to this folder are preserved in prebuilds. On the other hand, the docker image can change system folders such as `/home/gitpod` and those changes are accessible during the prebuild. I couldn't find out a way to change something in `/workspace` using the docker image (gitpod also handles the git checkout for you etc).

What needs to be done is to activate the gitpod app for github on the org level. This could be done also before this ticket is merged, but I'm not sure if it would pick up the gitpod config or if that one needs to be present in the default branch.

The prebuild can be configured to run for certain branches, see https://www.gitpod.io/docs/prebuilds#github-specific-configuration. Currently, it uses the default config which enables prebuilds only for the default branch (= develop).

<a id='comment:90'></a>Apart from these details:

Even with the 1 hour saved by pushing package builds into the prebuild phase saved, the initialization of the workspace still takes much too long for this whole thing to be convenient enough.

I see two directions how to fix this:
- Orchestrate the prebuild on our own on GH Actions - so that we are not constrained by the gitpod time limit of 1h. This could maybe use the incremental build infrastructure from our `docker/Dockerfile` (`sagemath-dev`) -- just replacing `FROM ubuntu:focal as run-time-dependencies` by `FROM gitpod/workspace-full`...

It's probably a question of what a "workspace" folder is, but at least only `/workspace/sagetrac-mirror` was shown in the right source file browser. Of course everything in `/workspace` is available but people need to use bash commands to investigate it. Then one could also put sage-local directly in `/home/gitpod/sage-local`.

```

I'm not sure if that's an issue with gitpod or something going wrong in sage's build script. According to the logs, matplotlib, scipy, fpylll, sagelib and were still compiling when this error is displayed. Do you have a guess where this message is coming from?

Done, with that change cherry-picked.

Just an easier solution that works without using `sudo`, and integrates better with #33103

More packages, because someone made an effort to package all of sage not so long ago. Not sure in what shape it is though

<a id='comment:7'></a>Is fine with me. However, that approach has a few disadvantages as far as I can see:
- The relevant github action might only be triggered after quite some time upon a new (beta) relase as all other github workflows are then also triggered. During this time one would still use the old docker image.
- The docker image is quite big and thus it takes longer to open a new gitpod workspace.
- It is harder to add gitpod-specific customization to the docker image (e.g. installing tools that are only needed in this context).

These are certainly not deal breakers but should be kept in mind.

The first approach has also a few disadvantages:
- Currently less packages are built due to the gitpod timeout of 1h
- Not automatically tested (although this would probably be easy to do)
