A while ago, `@`jdemeyer used to regularly take care of removing bare `except:` statements constantly introduced in Sage source code, se e.g. #27427, #14028, #11310, #21687, #24274.

The goal of this ticket (perhaps should it be a task ticket ?) is to take over the work without self-abnegation by:

- removing the existing bare `except:` statements.
- ensure that those will not be reintroduced by adding a dedicated plugin to the patchbot (i have code for it but it could only be merged once the exisiting bare `except:` statements are removed).

<a id='comment:22'></a>I hope that makes any sense:

- Cleaned up the syntax.
- `pari_unlock` shouldn't haven been called like that, because we are in `sig_on ... sig_off` and one should not call python functions in that case: https://cysignals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interrupt.html.
- `_wrap_gen(result)` doesn't belong in the `try ... except` block, because it has its own error handling (and if it was to raise an error, we would slip into the except block calling `sig_off` again.
- Use `finally` to call `sig_off` before exit.
- Apparently `giac` raises `RuntimeError` in case something goes wrong. So I used that.

<a id='comment:54'></a>I think the comment should move before the code and not after:

```diff
-                rat_points.add(X(point)) # checks if this point lies on X or not
-            except:
+                rat_points.add(X(point))
+                # checks if this point lies on X or not
```

So instead we should have something as

```
                # checks if this point lies on X or not
                rat_points.add(X(point))
```

I do not see the benefit of such squashing, but i see the drawbacks: we get a mixed bomb of changes without understanding which change is done for which reason. For example, i split the changes on `giac.pyx` as follows in order to ease reviewing:

```
​bcdb620	#32788 : fix intentations for libs/giac/giac.pyx
​da3e437	#32788 : remove useless try/except statements in src/sage/libs/giac/giac.pyx
```

Similarly, it is important to have separate commits when you rename a file and modify it.

<a id='comment:68'></a>There are two polymake test failures (see below), but they are not related to this ticket, so are best dealt with in another ticket.

I am ready to set this ticket to positive, if someone could confirm that the new pycodestyle check still passes with 9.5 merged. Unfortunately, I have difficulties in running tox on my machine.

By the way, this ticket will also fix a random [doctest failure](https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/33217/Linux/29~20.04.1-Ubuntu_SMP_Fri_Jan_14_00:32:30_UTC_2022/x86_64/5.13.0-27-generic/r640/2022-01-26%2017:49:49) in `coding/linear_code.py` which is due to an `AlarmInterrupt` being swallowed by a bare except.

I am happy to review it if anyone wants to change that, but I do not think it is necessary here.
