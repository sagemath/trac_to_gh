`SymbolicRing` can wrap pretty arbitrary Python objects as SR elements. Lots of things can obviously go wrong with that, but allowing expressions to be effectively mutable is going too far.

```
sage: m = matrix(QQ, 2, 2)
sage: M = SR(m)
sage: type(M)
<class 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: m[0,1] = 8
sage: M
[0 8]
[0 0]
```
We should make an immutable copy before wrapping.


Depends on #32391
