If brew is installed on Linux, Sagemath thinks this is the primary package manager and, e.g., `configure` suggests to run `brew ...` to install new packages. However, linuxbrew is untested as a platform for Sage, and so this is not a good idea.

We change `build/bin/sage-guess-package-system` so that `brew` is only tested after the Linux package managers. 

We also add a detection for `nix-env`.

It would be great to have instructions how to do Sage development using nixpkgs in our installation manual. 

Other than figuring out how to provision a nix environment with packages on top of the `nixos/nix` Docker image (so I can say `tox -e docker-nixos-standard`), I have no experience with nix.

By the way, I am getting the error:

```
Step 6/46 : RUN  nix-env --install  gd iml m4ri gfan singular mpfi cmake symmetrica flintqs freetype cddlib libbraiding brial ppl sympow zn_poly readline R sqlite tachyon giac m4rie blas lapack ntl glpk fflas-ffpack libmpc gsl boost nauty binutils gnumake gnum4 perl python3 gnutar bc gcc bash flint arb pari cliquer libhomfly openssl gengetopt planarity lrcalc palp ecm givaro ecl eclib lcalc rankwidth qhull gettext autoconf automake libtool pkg-config
 ---> Running in 0dcbda1f2003
error: selector 'libhomfly' matches no derivations
```
so it may be that some work on the `nix.txt` files is needed.

Yes, it's for the system package advice that is printed at the end of a `configure` run.

The code for this is in `build/bin/sage-print-system-package-command`.

`configure` only checks what is available in `PATH`.

For packages where we don't find a system package in this way, if there is system package information in `build/pkgs/*/nix.txt` for the package, we issue the system package advice. No package manager queries are done -- this is all left to the user.

(This is a design principle for this code -- it does not attempt to take care of system package installation tasks for the user; instead it only informs/educates the user about possible commands.)
