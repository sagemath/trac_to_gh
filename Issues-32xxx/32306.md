```
in `seems_feasible` in `graphs/strongly_regular_db.pyx` there are computations of multiplicities (f,g) of eigenvalues which silently overflow `int` for relatively modest values of parameters, e.g. for
a feasible tuple `(16384, 8256, 4160, 4160)`.

```
    f = -k*(s+1)*(k-s)//(mu*(r-s))
    g =  k*(r+1)*(k-r)//(mu*(r-s))
```
this should not be done with `int`.

As well, these computations should be done before `"Integrality condition"` check.

It could be a bug in the patchbot plugin. Probably never looked at by anybody else than me.

Here is the regexp used:

```
    regexps = [r'\.\.SEE|SEE ALSO|SEEALSO:($|[^:])',
               r'^\s*TEST:', r'^\s*EXAMPLE:', r'^\s*NOTES:',
               r'^\s*[A-Z]*PUT::', r'^\s*[A-Z]*PUT$',

               r'^\s*REFERENCES?::', r'\s:$', r'^\s*Returns']

Do you see why `:trac:`32306` is fixed::` matches ?
