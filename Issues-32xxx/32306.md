```
in `seems_feasible` in `graphs/strongly_regular_db.pyx` there are computations of multiplicities (f,g) of eigenvalues which silently overflow `int` for relatively modest values of parameters, e.g. for
a feasible tuple `(16384, 8256, 4160, 4160)`.

```
    f = -k*(s+1)*(k-s)//(mu*(r-s))
    g =  k*(r+1)*(k-r)//(mu*(r-s))
```
this should not be done with `int`.

As well, these computations should be done before `"Integrality condition"` check.
