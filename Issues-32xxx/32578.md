In Sage 9.5.beta2, the following attempt to plot a cardioid fails:

```
sage: E.<r,ph> = EuclideanSpace(coordinates='polar')
sage: c = E.curve((1 + cos(ph), ph), (ph, 0, 2*pi))
sage: c.plot(chart=E.cartesian_coordinates())
...
ValueError: No expression has been found for Curve in the Euclidean plane E^2
 in terms of Chart (E^2, (x, y))
```
This is because the curve `c` is known only in polar coordinates and no attempt is made to compute its expression in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Forcing the latter computation by e.g. 

```
sage: c.display(chart2=E.cartesian_coordinates())
```
before invoking `c.plot(chart=E.cartesian_coordinates())` makes things work. 

In the current ticket, the method `plot` is modified, so that the expression in the coordinates specified by the argument `chart` is computed by means of `ContinuousMap.coord_functions`. Moreover, this simplifies significantly the code of `DifferentiableCurve.plot`.
