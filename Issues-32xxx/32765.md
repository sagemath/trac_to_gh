This is a good point. Funny thing, the full modular group and the special linear group SL(2, ZZ) are not considered the same object in [SageMath](SageMath):

```
sage: SL(2, ZZ)
Special Linear Group of degree 2 over Integer Ring
sage: SL2Z
Modular Group SL(2,Z)
sage: SL2Z == SL(2, ZZ)
False
```

Moreover:

```
sage: ModularForms(SL(2, ZZ), 12)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: group of unknown type.
```

I believe that, from a user point of view, this could be confusing.

- Keep `_repr_` more or less as is, encouraging output that can be copied back into a Sage shell.
- Add an optional `_str_` method which returns a human-readable (possibly Unicode) string.
- Add a global switch to let users choose between the two display modes.

Overall though, I agree that this is not a very important issue.

<a id='comment:14'></a>Hello,

I think that everybody here has made some good points. I had some thought in favor about this ticket and I wanted to share them. 

First, I don't think that the changes in this ticket would negatively affect that much the general [SageMath](SageMath) user. Indeed, in all my years of using [SageMath](SageMath) for my studies or research, I have never copied/pasted the representation of an object to the console. Take for example:

```
sage: ModularForms(1, 12)
Modular Forms space of dimension 2 for Modular Group SL(2,Z) of weight 12 over Rational Field
```
The representation of the modular forms spaces does not display (almost) anything that could be copied back into the console (except maybe "SL(2, Z)").

Next, if a user is confused about the syntax because the output is "â„¤" and not "ZZ", then I think that the fault goes back to the Sage tutorial/reference manuals for doing a poor job of educating the user (but I strongly don't think that's the case). Again, in all the years I used Sage (mostly for modular forms), I always knew that `ZZ` stands for the ring of integers.

Finally, these days many machines are able to display unicode characters, except maybe an old tablet or my smartwatch, but it is very unlikely that a user would install the software on these machines.
