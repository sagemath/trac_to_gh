```
The following doctest in `src/sage/rings/padics/padic_generic_element.pyx` is unstable:

```
sage: K.<a> = QqCR(2^3,5)
sage: S.<x> = K[]
sage: L.<pi> = K.extension(x^4 - 2*a)
...
sage: elt = L.random_element() 
sage: P = elt.minimal_polynomial()
sage: P(elt) == 0
True
```

Sometimes it's not exact, ok the ring is not exact.
However, sometimes we get an error:

```
ArithmeticError: vector is not in free module
```
and from the documentation it is not clear when and why this happens.

In #29979, a doctest was marked `not tested` because of this.

Keywords: **minimal polynomial**

Component: **algebra**
