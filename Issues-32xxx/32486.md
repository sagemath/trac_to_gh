The following code in Sage 9.4 gives me `KeyError: ((None,), ())` followed by `AttributeError: 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression' object has no attribute 'ceil'`':

```
from sage.modules.free_module_integer import IntegerLattice                                                                                                                                                                                                               
L = IntegerLattice([[-1,  0,  1],[1,0,2]])                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
L.closest_vector((1,1,1))
```

It was suggested at https://ask.sagemath.org/question/58842/ that the latter error comes from `sqrt(5).ceil()` not working.

I see the same error on many other `.closest_vector()` calls - so essentially its functionality is broken at the moment.

We're taking slightly longer vectors in this patch, but this can only be harmful for the performance, as far as I understand.

Besides, I'm sure there are good algorithms to find a ceil(abs(v)), without first computing a floating point approximation of abs(v), no?

if one has to go with \ell_2 norm then one needs to call a function for the squared \ell_2 norm n2 of v, 
and then take (r,rem)-n2.sqrtrem() (which basically wraps one call to GMP) of the result;

then ceil(abs(v)) is r if rem==0, and r+1 otherwise.
