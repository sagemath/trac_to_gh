The following code in Sage 9.4 gives me `KeyError: ((None,), ())` followed by `AttributeError: 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression' object has no attribute 'ceil'`':

```
from sage.modules.free_module_integer import IntegerLattice                                                                                                                                                                                                               
L = IntegerLattice([[-1,  0,  1],[1,0,2]])                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
L.closest_vector((1,1,1))
```

It was suggested at https://ask.sagemath.org/question/58842/ that the latter error comes from `sqrt(5).ceil()` not working.

I see the same error on many other `.closest_vector()` calls - so essentially its functionality is broken at the moment.
