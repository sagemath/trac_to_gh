Add

- the `OrePolynomialEvaluation` class taking
  an Ore polynomial `P` in `K[X, sigma, der]`
  and an element `c` in `K`. This class
  represents the morphism `P(c*sigma + der)`.

- a method in the `OrePolynomialElement` class
  which returns this evaluation.

Needs work: documentation, tests, reworks.
