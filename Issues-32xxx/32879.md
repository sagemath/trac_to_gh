We add the following test to the `relint` linting workflow:
Library code should not import from `sage.PAC.KAGE.all` when `sage.PAC.KAGE` is a namespace package (see #32501)

Imho, it is a very bad idea to introduce a check before it has been fully fixed. This just makes the linter useless.

I have to agree. Now the linter workflow is falling for each ticket and it's no longer clear if that's because the ticket introduced some new issues or because of the all imports. 

I propose to either remove the all imports soon or demote this check to a warning instead of an error (if that's possible with relint).

Sorry, but if you don't plan to work on this yourself I would say we should demote it for now to a warning and fully activate it later.
