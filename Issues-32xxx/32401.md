Observed on Cygwin 3.2.0(0.340/5/3). This test:

```
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/symbolics/expression.pyx
```

gives this failure:

```
File "src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx", line 9045,
in sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.arccosh
Failed example:
    maxima('acosh(0.5)')
Expected:
    1.047197551196598...*%i
Got:
    1.047197551196598*%i-1.110223024625157e-16
```

The appearance of a small real part here
cannot be dealt with a tolerance.

To make the doctest pass, maybe instead:

- test real part is 0.0 with abs tol 1e-15
- test imaginary part is what it should be

How about writing it like this?

```diff

Also an opportunity to change rtac to trac

Not sure where the change in rounding originates
that makes a small real part appear here.

Maxima? ECL? Cygwin math library? In case it might
be worth reporting upstream.

Tiny real resp. imaginary parts in pure imaginary
resp. real results are annoying, see e.g. #8450.
