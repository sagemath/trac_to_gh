Observed on Cygwin 3.2.0(0.340/5/3). This test:

```
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/symbolics/expression.pyx
```

gives this failure:

```
File "src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx", line 9045,
in sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.arccosh
Failed example:
    maxima('acosh(0.5)')
Expected:
    1.047197551196598...*%i
Got:
    1.047197551196598*%i-1.110223024625157e-16
```

The appearance of a small real part here
cannot be dealt with a tolerance.

To make the doctest pass, maybe instead:

- test real part is 0.0 with abs tol 1e-15
- test imaginary part is what it should be

Maxima? ECL? Cygwin math library? In case it might
be worth reporting upstream.

Tiny real resp. imaginary parts in pure imaginary
resp. real results are annoying, see e.g. #8450.
