<a id='comment:1'></a>The signal error is caused by `nullspaceMP`, which is in the iml library.

Iml itself doesn't use architecture specific instructions, but the dependencies are.
But then again, OPENBLAS and gmp are already built with `make DYNAMIC_ARCH=1` resp. `--enable-fat`. Both of them got updated between sage 9.0 and sage 9.3.

<a id='comment:33'></a>The tests on Linux and macOS (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/1192736161 ) look normal. Note that they do not test `--enable-fat-binary` at all.
Unchanged:  `centos-7-i386` gives SIGFPE while building dochtml. Reported in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/ocdEAV4pFMo/m/4BEdJZQ8BAAJ for 9.4.rc1 (and probably earlier).

The test on Cygwin (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/1192736162) uses `--enable-fat-binary`. Unchanged: It gives the same segfaults whenever plotting is used (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/3506881828) that showed up in the previous betas.

So this seems safe to merge, but it remains unknown whether it helps at all. Some help from the people who build and test binaries is needed here.

Based on the provided logs, I have built a similar configuration using `OPENBLAS_CONFIGURE=TARGET=PENRYN tox -e local-macos-nohomebrew -- bash` on a real Mac (Intelr Core i9, Big Sur). The tests pass.

I'll try again now after merging 9.5.beta5.
