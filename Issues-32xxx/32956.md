One advantage is that when the feature `ffmpeg` or `imagemagick` is needed, an error message will now suggest how to install `ffmpeg` or `imagemagick` according to the system (debian, cygwin, macports, homebrew, etc.).

A question I have is whether `ffmpeg` should be removed from the following list (like it is the case for `pandoc`?):

```
$ cat build/pkgs/_recommended/distros/debian.txt 
# From https://wiki.sagemath.org/prerequisitesUbuntu

# to generate pdf documentation
texlive-latex-extra
# to convert Jupyter notebooks to pdf
texlive-xetex
# to generate pdf documentation
latexmk
# to convert Jupyter notebooks to pdf
# pandoc -- this is a separate script package
# to render text with LaTeX in Matplotlib
dvipng
# to run the Jmol 3D viewer from the console and generate images for 3D plots in the documentation
default-jdk
# to produce animations
ffmpeg
libavdevice-dev
```

I find it weird that those `pandoc`, `ffmpeg` and `imagemagick` need to be hardcoded in the `src/doc/bootstrap` file. Isn't there a better way to do this?

So, I understand that by removing ffmpeg and imagemagick from `_recommended/distros/*.txt` files, they will not be suggested to be installed when they are already installed anymore.

But, in the case that ffmpeg and imagemagick are not installed, let's say, will the configure script say that these are recommended packages somehow? I don't see how this will happen with the commits I have done in the ticket so far.

(also, let's do `pdftocairo` in another ticket, maybe in #20343 if I use it instead of `pdf2svg`)

Anyway, needs review!

Yes, this behavior is triggered by the `spkg-configure.m4` files added in the ticket.
