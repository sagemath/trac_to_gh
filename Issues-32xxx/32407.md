<a id='comment:16'></a>Actually this ticket leads to failure of docbuild and this should be fixed.

It is fixed in #32386 and can be somewhat cherry-picked from there.

The problem seems to be with

```
:class:`Expression`s
```

This doesn't seem to work, but you can do

```
:class:`Expression` (Expressions)
```
which supposedly has `Expressions` as the link text
(for some reason I have fixed it with `Expression's` in #32386, which is wrong grammar.

That is also not quite correct as I believe you want

```
:class:`Expressions <Expression>`
```
to show `Expressions` but link to the class `Expression`. Although you can also do something like `:class:`Expression`-s` or `'s`, but I won't worry too much about the grammar there...
