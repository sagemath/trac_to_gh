This ticket extends the syntax of `substitute_function` so that it is consistent with the syntax for the ordinary `substitute` method. This allows for substituting multiple functions,

```
sage: f,g,h = function('f g h')
sage: x,y = var('x y')
sage: (f(x) + g(y)).substitute_function({f: h, g: h})
h(x) + h(y)
```

exchanging two functions directly without having to do a three-way swap,

```
sage: (f(x) + g(y)).substitute_function({f: g, g: f})
f(y) + g(x)
```

and substituting a concrete expression for symbolic functions with a more direct syntax than before,

```
sage: expr = (diff(f(x),x))
sage: expr.substitute_function(f(x) == y*x^2)
2*x*y
```

(previously, one needed to introduce a new function to do this

```
sage: f2(x) = y*x^2
sage: expr.substitute_function(f,f2)
2*x*y
```
)

There are still two issues with the implementation at the moment, for which I'd like to get feedback:

1. Should we deprecate the old syntax `substitute_function(f,g)`? This would be more consistent with `substitute`, but would probably lead to a lot of warnings for users.
2. Finding functions by name and checking whether some object is a function is a bit tricky in sagemath. Currently, the functions doing that are imported from `sage.calculus.calculus`, but it might make sense to factor them out there and put them in a more suitable place.
