Presently `hadamard_matrix()` only returns matrices obtained by just two of several constructions Sage knows. 

```
Signature:      hadamard_matrix(n, existence=False, check=True)
Docstring:     
   This function is available as hadamard_matrix(...) and
   matrix.hadamard(...).

   Tries to construct a Hadamard matrix using a combination of Paley
   and Sylvester constructions.
```

It should use all Sage has (these from `skew_hadamard_matrix()`)

I don't think any deprecation is needed, just add more constructions.
