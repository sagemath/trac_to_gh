We implement graded algebras with maximal finite degree. That is, each generator has a integer degree, and multiplications exceeding a fixed degree yield zero.

This implementation is for example useful in the case of certain cohomology rings (or subrings of such) over a field of finite dimensional CW or simplicial complexes. See for example #29581.

I have troubles constructing a quotient. Here is what happens without a `ngens` method:

```
sage: from sage.algebras.commutative_graded_algebra_finite import FiniteGCAlgebra
sage: A.<x,y,z> = FiniteGCAlgebra(QQ, degrees=(1,2,3), max_degree=6)
sage: I = A.ideal(y^2)
sage: A.quotient(I)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: Graded commutative algebra with generators ('x', 'y', 'z') in degrees (1, 2, 3) with maximal finite degree 6 still using old coercion framework
```

Adding a `ngens` method on the other hand causes the quotients not to function properly:

```
sage: from sage.algebras.commutative_graded_algebra_finite import FiniteGCAlgebra
sage: A.<x,y,z> = FiniteGCAlgebra(QQ, degrees=(1,2,3), max_degree=6)
sage: I = A.ideal(y^2)
sage: Q = A.quotient(I)
sage: Q.gen(1)^2
ybar^2
```

The result, however, should be zero.

What am I doing wrong?

<a id='comment:15'></a>It would be better to have the keys be a filter applied to `WeightedIntegerVectors`, so it returns a parent rather than the explicit list. That way you do not need to create this list upon creation of the parent nor store it in memory. You can use `ConditionSet` from #32089 with a small extension to handle the case when its ambient set is a (finite?) enumerated set, or as a more stopgap that is already has what you need: `FilteredCombinatorialClass`. (Note that `ConditionSet` should be used as the replacement of this, which is de facto deprecated.)

This line is unnecessary:

```
Element = CombinatorialFreeModule.Element
```

First of all, this was not planned. I only wanted to implement gc algebras with *finite* degree. But it turned out that together with #32315, it was a small step to infinite degrees. 

Imho, rewriting would be way too much work for a questionable benefit. Both classes have different advantages and disadvantages. 

If I'm not mistaken, different implementations of the same mathematical objects are not uncommon in Sage...

I'm open to suggestions though, because I agree that this is not optimal. 

> I was suggesting documentation in case it is not possible to impose relations on your class of algebras.


Well, here it gets strange. You can define ideals by default, ie relations. But then the generic implementation of the quotient just gives nonsense.

This is not the only class having this problem. In other classes, this is also undocumented. See #32291 and https://ask.sagemath.org/question/56243/quotients-of-exterior-algebras/.

If this ticket is on hold, I would like to proceed in #29581 with a tentative version of this code restricted only to characteristic cohomology classes.

Please remove trailing blank lines
at the end of docstrings.

While reST blocks usually need a final blank line,
it is not the case at the end of a docstring.

See the template at:

- https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#template

where the final TESTS block is followed
directly by `"""` with no extra blank line.
