We implement graded algebras with maximal finite degree. That is, each generator has a integer degree, and multiplications exceeding a fixed degree yield zero.

This implementation is for example useful in the case of certain cohomology rings (or subrings of such) over a field of finite dimensional CW or simplicial complexes. See for example #29581.

Follow-up: #32365

<a id='comment:6'></a>(for the following see also https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/z5Y7BMwEUVk)

I have troubles constructing a quotient. Here is what happens without a `ngens` method:

```
sage: from sage.algebras.commutative_graded_algebra_finite import FiniteGCAlgebra
sage: A.<x,y,z> = FiniteGCAlgebra(QQ, degrees=(1,2,3), max_degree=6)
sage: I = A.ideal(y^2)
sage: A.quotient(I)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: Graded commutative algebra with generators ('x', 'y', 'z') in degrees (1, 2, 3) with maximal finite degree 6 still using old coercion framework
```

Adding a `ngens` method on the other hand causes the quotients not to function properly:

```
sage: from sage.algebras.commutative_graded_algebra_finite import FiniteGCAlgebra
sage: A.<x,y,z> = FiniteGCAlgebra(QQ, degrees=(1,2,3), max_degree=6)
sage: I = A.ideal(y^2)
sage: Q = A.quotient(I)
sage: Q.gen(1)^2
ybar^2
```

The result, however, should be zero.

What am I doing wrong?

<a id='comment:28'></a>In the file `commutative_graded_algebra.py`, the first line of the docstring for `GCAlgebraWithMaxDegree` says "Graded commutative algebras." Shouldn't it say "Graded commutative algebras with a maximum degree"? Should this class inherit from `GCAlgebra`? (`GCAlgebra` would be my answer to your last question in comment:17.)

I notice that you mentioned ideals in a previous comment; was that issue ever resolved? If so, it would be good to add some examples. If not, if there are no ideals or relations possible with these, the documentation should say that. "The only relation in such an algebra is that any product above `max_degree` is zero."

I don't think so. This implementation is basically different from what is done in `commutative_dga`. This implementation now offers two benefits: it supports `SR` as base field and a maximal degree.

`GCAlgebra` would be the same name as in `commutative_dga`. So you think this is a good idea?

No, the algebra apparently needs its own implementation of an ideal. A first lead into this direction yields #32249.

I was suggesting documentation in case it is not possible to impose relations on your class of algebras.

First of all, this was not planned. I only wanted to implement gc algebras with *finite* degree. But it turned out that together with #32315, it was a small step to infinite degrees. 

Imho, rewriting would be way too much work for a questionable benefit. Both classes have different advantages and disadvantages. 

If I'm not mistaken, different implementations of the same mathematical objects are not uncommon in Sage...

I'm open to suggestions though, because I agree that this is not optimal. 

> I was suggesting documentation in case it is not possible to impose relations on your class of algebras.


Well, here it gets strange. You can define ideals by default, ie relations. But then the generic implementation of the quotient just gives nonsense.

This is not the only class having this problem. In other classes, this is also undocumented. See #32291 and https://ask.sagemath.org/question/56243/quotients-of-exterior-algebras/.

> I suspect the exterior algebra implementation will remain faster (which could be meld together with a purely odd degree version) because of the data structure for encoding the elements. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to compare with a "natural" encoding of the monomials by the degree of the generators. Perhaps the ideal way to do this would be to encode a basis element by a pair of the degrees of the evens with a subset of the odd indices (ordered as a tuple; cf. the exterior algebra implementation).


Separating the generators into odd and even degree, and performing the computations on those sounds like the most optimal solution to me. Besides, together with Cythonizing, this could give an extremely efficient implementation. I can imagine that all those ideals and relations currently used in `commutative_dga` slow down computations a bit.

Exactly.

One trivial pyflakes thing before a positive review:

Once fixed, you can set a positive review unless somebody else objects.

<a id='comment:50'></a>Nitpicking suggestion, feel free to ignore.

Please remove trailing blank lines
at the end of docstrings.

While reST blocks usually need a final blank line,
it is not the case at the end of a docstring.

See the template at:

- https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#template

where the final TESTS block is followed
directly by `"""` with no extra blank line.
