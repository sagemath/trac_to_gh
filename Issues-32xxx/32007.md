<a id='comment:6'></a>I made some changes to the implementation to use more Python objects (so faster) and not going through the Cartesian product to drastically reduce the number of edges being built:

```
sage: X = Subsets(10)                                                                                                
sage: X.cardinality()
1024
sage: cartesian_product([X,X]).cardinality()
1048576
```
This implementation is essentially the same implementation as using the integers (which I cleaned up slightly by avoiding redundant information).

If my changes are good, then positive review.
