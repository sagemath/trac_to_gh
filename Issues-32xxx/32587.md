<a id='comment:10'></a>From #31621: can we also make the following changes?

- change gsl's `spkg-install.in` as follows:

```
 As it stands, on OSX + homebrew, `./configure --with-system-gsl=no` fails when building `gsl` with the error

```

```
 and the `config.log` file says `ld: library not found for -lopenblas`.

- Also, I think `pkgconf` should be an order-only dependency for gsl:

```diff
