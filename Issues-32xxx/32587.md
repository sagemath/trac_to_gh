One API change in GSL 2.7 causes trouble in Sage, see

- https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/yQ67Wy0gp58/m/jr6f7xtcBQAJ

Some distros, e.g. Gentoo, now have GSL 2.7 as the default.

Depends on #32607

In this case, I would recommend the following. Split this ticket into two:
- one ticket for updating the library so that it can work with system GSL 2.7.
  Because this ticket will not include a change to packages, the patchbot will run on it.
- a follow-up ticket that does the upgrade of the package.

With each of the tickets, we can run portability testing on GH Actions (https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/portability_testing.html) to make sure that it still works with system GSL on all supported platforms.

<a id='comment:10'>**Comment 10:**</a>
From #31621: can we also make the following changes?

- change gsl's `spkg-install.in` as follows:

```diff

 sdh_make

```
 As it stands, on OSX + homebrew, `./configure --with-system-gsl=no` fails when building `gsl` with the error

```
configure: error: in `/Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/TESTING/sage-9.5.beta1/local/var/tmp/sage/build/gsl-2.6/src':
configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
```
 and the `config.log` file says `ld: library not found for -lopenblas`.

- Also, I think `pkgconf` should be an order-only dependency for gsl:

```diff
diff --git a/build/pkgs/gsl/dependencies b/build/pkgs/gsl/dependencies

 since the package installation scripts use `pkg-config`.
