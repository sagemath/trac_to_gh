There is currently no precise definition of algebras (as in MagmaticAlgebra) in the documentation.  A useful definition seems to be the following.

Let *R* be a ring (unital and associative as usual, but not necessarily commutative).  Note that if *A* is an *R*-bimodule, then the tensor product *A* ⊗<sub>*R*</sub> *A* exists and is again an *R*-bimodule.

Definition: An *R-algebra* is an *R*-bimodule *A* together with an *R*-bimodule homomorphism ⋆: *A* ⊗<sub>*R*</sub> *A* → *A*.

See the attached branch for a definition that does not use tensor products.

Two remarks:

- With this definition, a unital associative *R*-algebra is "the same" as a ring *A* together with a ring homomorphism *R* → *A*.

- There is no requirement that left and right multiplication agree (in the sense that *r* ⋆ *a* = *a* ⋆ *r* for *r* ∈ *R* and *a* ∈ *A*).  This additional condition is only really sensible if *R* is commutative.  In that case, an *R*-algebra *A* satisfying the condition could be called "central", although this conflicts with the usual definition of central algebras in which *A* is unital and associative and the image of *R* under the canonical ring homomorphism *R* → *A* is required to be equal to (not just contained in) the centre of *A*.  Skew polynomial algebras are examples of algebras that are unital and associative, but not in general central.

<a id='comment:2'></a>I've struggled with this in the past, and wound up defining a (magmatic) algebra to involve a module over a *commutative* ring. Sage doesn't really do modules over non-commutative rings:

```
sage: Q = QuaternionAlgebra(QQ,-1,-1)                                           
sage: FreeModule(Q,2)                                                           
/home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/modules/free_module.py:235: UserWarning: You are constructing a free module
over a noncommutative ring. Sage does not have a concept
of left/right and both sided modules, so be careful.
It's also not guaranteed that all multiplications are
done from the right side.
```

So, when you say "An algebra over a (not necessarily commutative) ring `R` is a bimodule..." you are suggesting more generality than what sage is actually capable of.

The rest looks OK to me. The explicit mention that "Algebras" are actually "associative unital algebras" would have saved me a lot of time at one point.

For me, the aim at this moment is just to have a conceptual starting point for a more precisely-defined category hierarchy.  At least on the category level there is support for left, right and bimodules, possibly over non-commutative rings.

It is true that not all modules implemented in Sage have support for non-commutative rings, and moreover the documentation of `sage.categories.modules` contains the following warning:

```
        Outside of the context of symmetric modules over a commutative
        ring, the specifications of this category are fuzzy and not
        yet set in stone (see below). The code in this category and
        its subcategories is therefore prone to bugs or arbitrary
        limitations in this case.
```
This is actually also a point where a precise definition would be useful.  Maybe modules (without left/right/bi-) should indeed be defined only over commutative rings, and should be defined as bimodules such that the left and right multiplication coincide.  Equivalently, a module over a commutative ring could simply be defined as a left module which can then be viewed as a bimodule by defining the right multiplication to be equal to the left multiplication (this works because the base ring is commutative).  I guess this is what "symmetric" means in the above warning.

Analogously, and as an alternative to the definition of algebras I am proposing on this ticket, we could in principle say that (magmatic) algebras should be defined only over commutative rings and should be defined as modules (in the above sense) with a bilinear multiplication map.  If I understand correctly, that is how you define algebras.  The only problem with this is that then we cannot say that skew polynomial rings are algebras over their base ring, because the left and right multiplication do not agree.  To solve this, we could use "prealgebras" (or some nicer name) for the concept I am proposing, and demote skew polynomial rings to prealgebras.

Some people may view it like this, but I think this is a mistake.  If we can't agree on a definition (or if there is no clear definition as in this case), then it is practically guaranteed to lead to bugs or confusion sooner or later.

I have no problem with separating the "mathematical" and the "practical" description, but this ticket is only about the former.  I think the definition of the Sage category is an entirely appropriate place to put the mathematical definition.  Any practical description should be based on the mathematical one.
