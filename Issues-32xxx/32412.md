Note that it is currently unused in Sage.

`sage.interfaces.primecount`, because its compilation depends on an optional package, 
would have to be provided by a distribution separate from `sagemath-standard`.

For other modules such as `sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.tdlib` that depend on an optional package, we would indeed split it out as a distribution `sagemath-tdlib`. This is done in #29864. Note that `sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.tdlib` depends on both Sage (by using the `Graph` class) and on the optional package.

The difference is that `sage.interfaces.primecount` does not depend in any way on Sage. Therefore it should be redone as a standalone Python (Cython) package, in the same way that Vincent split out (and extended) https://pypi.org/project/pplpy/ from Sage (`sage.libs.ppl`).

There will always be two packages - one providing the C library and one providing the Python bindings.

When the Python bindings are not Sage-specific:
- `ppl` / `pplpy`
- `igraph` / `python_igraph`
- `primecount` / `pyprimecount` (to be created) 

When the Python package is Sage-specific:
- `tdlib` / `sagemath-tdlib` (to be created in #29864)
- `meataxe` / `sagemath-meataxe` (to be created in #30151)
