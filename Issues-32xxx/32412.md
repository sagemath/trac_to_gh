Note that it is currently unused in Sage.

`sage.interfaces.primecount`, because its compilation depends on an optional package, 
would have to be provided by a distribution separate from `sagemath-standard`.

For other modules such as `sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.tdlib` that depend on an optional package, we would indeed split it out as a distribution `sagemath-tdlib`. This is done in #29864. Note that `sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.tdlib` depends on both Sage (by using the `Graph` class) and on the optional package.

The difference is that `sage.interfaces.primecount` does not depend in any way on Sage. Therefore it should be redone as a standalone Python (Cython) package, in the same way that Vincent split out (and extended) https://pypi.org/project/pplpy/ from Sage (`sage.libs.ppl`).

There will always be two packages - one providing the C library and one providing the Python bindings.

When the Python bindings are not Sage-specific:
- `ppl` / `pplpy`
- `igraph` / `python_igraph`
- `primecount` / `pyprimecount` (to be created) 

When the Python package is Sage-specific:
- `tdlib` / `sagemath-tdlib` (to be created in #29864)
- `meataxe` / `sagemath-meataxe` (to be created in #30151)

I forgot to mention that we should promote primecount to standard.
I don't understand why one need to do a special package thing for the (pretty trivial)

It was about dependence on an optional package, but we're promoting it to standard now?

anyhow, there is an external package already, it's unfortunately a bit light on the distribution side - well, the author is still in high school according to GH. Maybe he can use some help in building wheels and stuff.
