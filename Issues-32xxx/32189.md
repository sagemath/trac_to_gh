```
In #26856, all the GAP packages previously shipped
in the `database_gap` optional spkg were made part
of the `gap` standard spkg, and the `database_gap`
spkg was removed.

A few `# optional - database_gap` doctest tags were
inadvertently reintroduced in commit 3efc05e62d24,
which appeared in #25902 and was adopted in #28782.

This ticket removes these doctest tags.

Oops, typo "GAP uses needs" -> "GAP uses".
Let's also leave a note about TransGrp
being previously provided by "database_gap"
for the sake of users of Sage <= 8.5 reading
the online documentation.

Removed the note that added clutter:

```
Up to Sage 8.5, "TransGrp" was available in Sage via the
"database_gap" optional Sage package, removed in :trac:`22626`
as its content became part of the "gap" standard Sage package.
```
Please review.
