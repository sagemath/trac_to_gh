The issue is coming from doctesting implementation/architecture-dependent behavior that is not guaranteed by the spec. It is best practice to avoid this, instead of updating doctests every time a different architecture or Python version is tested. 

`#32-bit` markers are best reserved to lower-level code that truly has to distinguish between architectures, such as when exact hash values have to be tested for some reason.

> Sorting doctest makes them much less readable, and nothing explains the reason to the user 

Well, that is a shortcoming of the documentation -- or the choice of output type -- of this method. It returns a list (which is an ordered container) but the documentation does not explain anything about the order of the items.

By the way, in contemporary Python one would probably make functions like this iterators instead of returning a list. Then it is up to the user of the method to choose how to process it.

Right, I had thought I had seen this failure before on another ticket. 

Sorting is another solution to make the output deterministic, of course. Feel free to replace my branch by a cherry-pick of https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/abdade36276e7c5c51fc2a818f599c667f0f1627 -- I have no preference either way.

In any case, it would be a good to add to the description of the output a comment on the order.

Added such a description.

sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)

Projective points do implement lexicographic ordering, but comparison of number field elements is undefined. There is a long-standing ticket #20028 that aims to change comparisons of number field elements into an error in order to avoid unexpected behavior like this.

OK, here is another branch : https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commits/u/tmonteil/failure_in_projective_ds_py-depends_on_architecture

Do not hesitate to provide a better explanation.

However, while i could reproduce the issue on my 32-bit VM, i could not ensure that this will happen on every 32-bit architecture (this is why i was more conservative in the previous branch).
