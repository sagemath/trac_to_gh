The issue is coming from doctesting implementation/architecture-dependent behavior that is not guaranteed by the spec. It is best practice to avoid this, instead of updating doctests every time a different architecture or Python version is tested. 

`#32-bit` markers are best reserved to lower-level code that truly has to distinguish between architectures, such as when exact hash values have to be tested for some reason.

> Sorting doctest makes them much less readable, and nothing explains the reason to the user 


Well, that is a shortcoming of the documentation -- or the choice of output type -- of this method. It returns a list (which is an ordered container) but the documentation does not explain anything about the order of the items.

By the way, in contemporary Python one would probably make functions like this iterators instead of returning a list. Then it is up to the user of the method to choose how to process it.

Right, I had thought I had seen this failure before on another ticket. 

Sorting is another solution to make the output deterministic, of course. Feel free to replace my branch by a cherry-pick of https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/abdade36276e7c5c51fc2a818f599c667f0f1627 -- I have no preference either way.

In any case, it would be a good to add to the description of the output a comment on the order.

Added such a description.

While this fix should work in theory, I don't personally have a 32 bit build of Sage. Could someone test the fix?

Now i am getting confused: on a 32bit VM (with #32080 applied), i still got the exact same failure as `@`vbraun:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)
sage: R.<z> = QQ[]
sage: K.<v> = NumberField(z^4 - z^2 - 1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem_projective([x^2 - y^2, y^2])

[(-v : 1), (v : 1)]
sage: g.sort()
sage: g

```

However:

```
sage: g[0] < g[1]

sage: g[0] > g[1]
True
sage: g
[(-v : 1), (v : 1)]
sage: sorted(g)

Coud you please have a look at the branch https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/log/?h=u/tmonteil/random_failure_in_projective_ds_py ? It only deals with the problematic doctest, the example is still understandable to the user, and the developer can track the issue.

I do not like the way the issue is currently dealt with (sort everything) since:

OK, here is another branch : https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/log/?h=u/tmonteil/failure_in_projective_ds_py-depends_on_architecture

Do not hesitate to provide a better explanation.

However, while i could reproduce the issue on my 32-bit VM, i could not ensure that this will happen on every 32-bit architecture (this is why i was more conservative in the previous branch).
