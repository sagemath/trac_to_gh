Ok its a bit sub-optimal to tell people to complain on sage-devel upon successful installation, but hopefully nobody looks into the log.

However, building the source tarball fails because tox still depends on toml:

```

The pyparsing error says that tomli is required, but its not listed as a dependency

```
[release@zen Sage]$ cat build/pkgs/pyparsing/dependencies 
$(PYTHON) | setuptools pip wheel
```
I think thats a real dependency error

There's nothing in pyparsing that refers to tomli.

I think in your worktree, you have for some reason a broken installation record of pip packages.

Can you reproduce this in a from scratch build?
