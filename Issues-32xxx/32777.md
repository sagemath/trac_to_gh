The `RealLazyField` implementation is tied closely to `real_mpfr`.

We modify some imports for the purpose of modularization, in particular **sagemath-polyhedra** (#32432)

In particular for `... is RLF` tests:

```
$ git grep 'is RLF'
src/sage/rings/complex_double.pyx:        if S is ZZ or S is QQ or S is RDF or S is RLF:
src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_base.pyx:        if codomain is AA or codomain is RLF:
src/sage/rings/real_double.pyx:        if S is ZZ or S is QQ or S is RLF:
src/sage/schemes/plane_conics/con_number_field.py:                if not (isinstance(p, Map) and p.category_for().is_subcategory(Rings())) or p.codomain() is AA or p.codomain() is RLF:
```
