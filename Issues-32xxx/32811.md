see `src/sage/structure/parent_old.pyx` and `src/sage/structure/parent_base.pyx`

In brief, `ParentWithGens` is part of the "old-coercion-framework", which is still used a lot, in particular in number fields and commutative rings. This is supposed to be deprecated, but removing that is a daunting task.

I see. However what is confusing me is that we are still inheriting from `Algebra`:

```
class QuaternionAlgebra_abstract(Algebra):
```

If this is correct, we should initialize `Algebra`. If this is not correct, we should just straight inherit from `Parent`.
