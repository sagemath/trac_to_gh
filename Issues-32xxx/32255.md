In the very special case where there are no equations and no variables, maxima and sympy don't agree on the number of solutions that exist:

```
sage: len(solve([], [], algorithm="maxima"))
1

sage: len(solve([], [], algorithm="sympy"))
0
```

Maxima is correct here; i.e., we should have

```
sage: solve([], [], algorithm="sympy")
[[]]
```
and 

```
sage: solve([], [], algorithm="sympy", solution_dict=True)
[{}]
```

---

Edit: This is also a problem when there are no equations but a nonzero number of variables:

```
sage: len(solve([], [x], algorithm="maxima"))
1
sage: len(solve([], [x], algorithm="sympy"))
0
```
I think the later should be

```
sage: solve([], [x], algorithm="sympy")
[[]]
```

---

Here is another case where sympy and maxima do not agree:

```
sage: solve([x], [], algorithm="maxima")
[]
sage: solve([x], [], algorithm="sympy")
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
IndexError: tuple index out of range
```
Curiously, this works:

```
sage: solve([x, x], [], algorithm="sympy")
[]
```


Keywords: sympy, maxima

Status: new
