Thank you, well, I don't think this is a duplicate, because I know that for the previous version the search worked (while producing those square bracket object output strings).

This time around, Thebe is actually breaking the code. So, IMHO, common solution to both tickets is to get rid of that library and make a new ticket to figure out how to add it back "safely", or to at least check what its current status is.
