Just catching `PtyProcessError` in addition to `ExceptionPexpect` on our side does not seem to fix the problem.

Just to mention that I've been using system `ptyprocess-0.7.0` (via #29665) for a few weeks without any issue.

What's the exact issue? I haven't seen any report of what goes wrong on macos when using an updated ptyprocess.
