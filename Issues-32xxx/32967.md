Wouldn't it be good to have some doctests?  I know very little about these functions, but at the very least it appears that the function names do not quite match up.  Possibly, fricas is missing some.  For example, at https://fricas.github.io/api/SpecialFunctionCategory.html I cannot find `jacobiCs`.


One place for such tests might be `fricas.py`, line 1510.

I guess one could systematically compare some numerical values, to make sure that the definitions agree.  For example

```
sage: jacobi_cn(0.9,2.1) - fricas("jacobiCn")(0.9,2.1).sage()
-7.04818555476145e-20*I
```
but I have absolutely no idea which values would make sense.

I'm sorry to be pedantic, but I find doctests like

```
sage: fricas(gen_legendre_P(2,1/2,x))  # optional - fricas
            1
legendreP(2,-,x)
            2
```
not very informative.  All this tests is that there is a trivariate fricas function `legendreP`.  It does not test, for example, that the ordering of the variables is as suggested.

I admit that it is a bit of work to find out how much information fricas actually has about these functions.  I did some digging:

* for the univariate elliptic, fricas can evaluate numerically
* for the bivariate legendre, hermite fricas knows the polynomial, e.g.:

```
sage: fricas.legendreP(4,x)
35  4   15  2   3
-- x  - -- x  + -
 8       4      8

```
* for the bivariate jacobiCn, jacobiSn, jacobiDn, ellipticE, ellipticF fricas knows the taylor series:

```
sage: fricas.series(fricas.jacobiCn(x,4), x=0)
    1  2   17  4   433  6   2903  8   226327  10      11
1 - - x  + -- x  - --- x  + ---- x  - ------ x   + O(x  )
    2      24      720      5760      518400

sage: fricas.series(fricas.ellipticF(x,2), x=0)
    1  3   19  5    9  7   289  9   279  11      12
x + - x  + -- x  + -- x  + --- x  + --- x   + O(x  )
    2      40      16      384      256
```
