(split out from #13811):

Most Sage objects are immutable. Nevertheless, `copy` and `deepcopy` make copies (through pickling/unpickling) for them because we have not provided the classes with `__copy__` methods (which should just return the object) and `__deepcopy__` methods (which in many cases should just return the object).

```
sage: a = 0
sage: copy(a) is a
False
```

In this ticket, we take care of the basic number types in `sage.rings`.
