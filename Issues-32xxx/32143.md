sage: f[1].sage()
```
does not return.

The reason is that there is the lack of a suitable equivalent for implicitly defined roots in the presence of extra variables.

Yes, that's another way to put it.

I am not very familiar with the `SymbolicRing`, my `root_of` object does not really need to be able to do anything.  Of course, it would be nice if one could compute with it (e.g., plugging it into the polynomial could give zero, and similar simplifications), but that is not necessary.
