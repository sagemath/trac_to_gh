We remove some code duplications in the ppl backend. Along the way we also allow initialization from `ppl_polyhedron`. This saves almost all the time, when extending base ring to `QQ`:

Before:

```
sage: %time P = polytopes.permutahedron(7)

Yes, I think so. I don't know what exact consequences this has. Do we make a copy, when initializing with a cone etc?

As long as everything is immutable, it's fine to have multiple polyhedra with the same cone. However, once things are mutable, that should be taken care of.
