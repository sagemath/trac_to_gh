We remove some code duplications in the ppl backend. Along the way we also allow initialization from `ppl_polyhedron`. This saves almost all the time, when extending base ring to `QQ`:

Before:

```
sage: %time P = polytopes.permutahedron(7)

sage: %time P.base_extend(QQ)

After:

Yes, I think so. I don't know what exact consequences this has. Do we make a copy, when initializing with a cone etc?

As long as everything is immutable, it's fine to have multiple polyhedra with the same cone. However, once things are mutable, that should be taken care of.

If it is clarified that ownership transfers to the new object, then no copy needs to be made.
