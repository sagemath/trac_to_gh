```
There are various places in the elliptic-curve code where we could reuse known information about curve and point orders:

- Isogeny codomains (Tate's theorem).
- Base-field extensions.
- Scalar multiplications (Lagrange's theorem).
- Possibly images of points under isogenies, but this is trickier (it requires `order_from_multiple` in general). It's unclear if this is worthwhile in all cases.

Moreover, `EllipticCurvePoint_finite_field` currently *uses* its `_order` attribute whenever present, but the `.order()` method fails to actively cache `_order` after it's been computed. We should also copy over the *curve* order after computing a point order because it's computed and cached by PARI anyway.

The patch implements items 1-3 of the list and fixes the `_order` caching in `EllipticCurvePoint_finite_field`.
