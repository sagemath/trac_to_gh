I like the idea, but I think it would be much more useful to have a single function that combines all three of these (and does more).  Perhaps the function should be:

```
exists_group_of_order(
	n, 
	*,  # this means that the remaining arguments are keyword-only
	cyclic=None, 
	abelian=None, 
	nilpotent=None,
	solvable=None,
	simple=None
	)
```

For example:
* `exists_group_of_order(n)` would be `True` if `n` is any integer that is at least 1, because there does exist a group of order `n`.
* `exists_group_of_order(n, abelian=False)` would be `True` if and only if `n` is not an abelian number.
* `exists_group_of_order(n, abelian=False, solvable=True)` would be `True` if and only if there is a nonabelian solvable group of order `n`.
* `exists_group_of_order(n, nilpotent=False, solvable=True)` would be `False` for all values of `n`, because all solvable groups are nilpotent.
* `exists_group_of_order(60, cyclic=False, simple=True)` would be `True` because there is a noncyclic simple group of order 60.

Or perhaps this should be a method of the `Integer` class that is named `is_order_of_group`.  (Other keywords could be added, such as `perfect`, but I think the five that I already named are the most important.)
