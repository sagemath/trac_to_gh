  [conway_polynomials-0.5]   ./spkg-install: line 37: exec: python3: not found
```

Likely a regression caused by #32442 (`./configure: Make --with-sage-venv=auto the default`).

These two packages are installed into `SAGE_LOCAL`, but use `python3` (which is in `SAGE_VENV`) for the installation.

The failure is caused by `SAGE_VENV/bin` (where `python3` is installed) not being in the PATH at the time that these package install scripts are run.
