`$ git grep 'functions.*import.*sqrt'` finds a small number of these imports

`sqrt` is actually not a symbolic function, so we move it to `sage.misc.functional` and import it from there. `isqrt` already lives there.

(Alternatively, many uses of the `sqrt` function could be replaced by a call to the `.sqrt` method.)

Either way will avoid the dependency on `sage.symbolic`.

(Same for `ceil`, `floor`, but that could also be done via #25827.)
