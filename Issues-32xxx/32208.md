```
A Jupyter notebook with a SageMath kernel, containing the output of the cell

```
%display latex
set([1,2])
```

cannot be saved as a PDF, because the generated LaTeX does not compile (though MathJax displays it).

The (relevant part of the) generated LaTeX is

```
\verb|{1,|\phantom{\verb!x!}\verb|2}|
```

The LaTeX error is

```
! LaTeX Error: \verb illegal in command argument.
```

so the problem is the use of `\phantom{\verb!x!}` to create spaces in LaTeX (though it works in MathJax).

The code to generate spaces in this way is in the `eval` method of `sage.misc.html.MathJax`.

Related to #31536 which divorced MathJax from LaTeX. Here it seems MathJax has come back to haunt its eX.

The aim of this ticket is to fix the pdf saving problem. The incorrect spacing problem is independent from that. 

Incorrect spacing of some characters like `-` seems a bug of MathJax2 with non-MathML. As you observed, the incorrect spacing problem will be solved when MathJax3 is adopted by Jupyter.

RubiksCube() is special in that there are many spaces in latex rendering. It seems not worth the effort to implement a general fix for such special cases and take the risk of unexpected side effects. Instead one may use `_html_()` to give customized html+mathjax rendering, as done in #11362.
