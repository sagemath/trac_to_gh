```
A Jupyter notebook with a SageMath kernel, containing the output of the cell

```
%display latex
set([1,2])
```

cannot be saved as a PDF, because the generated LaTeX does not compile (though MathJax displays it).

The (relevant part of the) generated LaTeX is

```
\verb|{1,|\phantom{\verb!x!}\verb|2}|
```

The LaTeX error is

```
! LaTeX Error: \verb illegal in command argument.
```

so the problem is the use of `\phantom{\verb!x!}` to create spaces in LaTeX (though it works in MathJax).

The code to generate spaces in this way is in the `eval` method of `sage.misc.html.MathJax`.

Related to #31536 which divorced MathJax from LaTeX. Here it seems MathJax has come back to haunt its eX.

I applied the patch to my local installation, and in a Jupyter notebook the output of

```
%display latex
RubiksCube()
```

has the correct spacing when the MathJax (2.7.8) renderer is set to MathML, and otherwise not. 

(And in any case, the notebook is able to be saved as a PDF that looks correct.)

On SageMathCell with MathJax 3.2.0, the new output (simulated by calling `html()`) does have the correct spacing with both the CHTML and SVG renderers.

So this solution seems correct, but depends on an update of MathJax. Upgrading to MathJax 3 is tracked in #25833, but it seems to be held off by the lack of automatic line breaking.

(The Rubik's cube example also illustrates that there is some more room for improvement: it should be possible to render the cube with fewer than 165 instances of `\verb`.)

The aim of this ticket is to fix the pdf saving problem. The incorrect spacing problem is independent from that. 

Incorrect spacing of some characters like `-` seems a bug of MathJax2 with non-MathML. As you observed, the incorrect spacing problem will be solved when MathJax3 is adopted by Jupyter.

RubiksCube() is special in that there are many spaces in latex rendering. It seems not worth the effort to implement a general fix for such special cases and take the risk of unexpected side effects. Instead one may use `_html_()` to give customized html+mathjax rendering, as done in #11362.

I agree with the positive review because I care more about saving as LaTeX/PDF than about the regression in the visible MathJax 2.7.8 output with non-MathML renderers (mentioned in my previous comment), which is due to a MathJax 2 bug as klee points out.
