```
A Jupyter notebook with a SageMath kernel, containing the output of the cell

```
%display latex
set([1,2])
```

cannot be saved as a PDF, because the generated LaTeX does not compile (though MathJax displays it).

The (relevant part of the) generated LaTeX is

```
\verb|{1,|\phantom{\verb!x!}\verb|2}|
```

The LaTeX error is

```
! LaTeX Error: \verb illegal in command argument.
```

so the problem is the use of `\phantom{\verb!x!}` to create spaces in LaTeX (though it works in MathJax).

The code to generate spaces in this way is in the `eval` method of `sage.misc.html.MathJax`.

Related to #31536 which divorced MathJax from LaTeX. Here it seems MathJax has come back to haunt its eX.

That is not a problem. It is normal. The latex code in `text/latex` section is from the mathjax code in `text/html`, which is turn constructed from the latex representation of the object in the `eval` method. It is assumed valid mathjax code is valid latex code.

Thanks for the clarification. It looks like that line was introduced 9 years ago, together with MathJax, in #9774. Most of the `\verb` stuff was replaced by `\text{\texttt{` in #14382, [ticket:14382#comment:18 except] for this part, for compatibility with MathJax. Macros [don't work](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/differences.html) inside `\text` in MathJax.

In vanilla Sage 9.4.beta4, when running `RubiksCube()` in a Jupyter notebook with `%display latex`, the ASCII art looks correct (albeit with a bit much vertical space between the lines) when the MathJax (2.7.8) renderer is set to Preview HTML or MathML.

Removing `\verb` understandably screws with the layout. When I replace instead

I applied the patch to my local installation, and in a Jupyter notebook the output of

```
%display latex
RubiksCube()
```

has the correct spacing when the MathJax (2.7.8) renderer is set to MathML, and otherwise not. 

(And in any case, the notebook is able to be saved as a PDF that looks correct.)

On SageMathCell with MathJax 3.2.0, the new output (simulated by calling `html()`) does have the correct spacing with both the CHTML and SVG renderers.

So this solution seems correct, but depends on an update of MathJax. Upgrading to MathJax 3 is tracked in #25833, but it seems to be held off by the lack of automatic line breaking.

(The Rubik's cube example also illustrates that there is some more room for improvement: it should be possible to render the cube with fewer than 165 instances of `\verb`.)

The aim of this ticket is to fix the pdf saving problem. The incorrect spacing problem is independent from that. 

Incorrect spacing of some characters like `-` seems a bug of MathJax2 with non-MathML. As you observed, the incorrect spacing problem will be solved when MathJax3 is adopted by Jupyter. 
 
> The Rubik's cube example also illustrates that there is some more room for improvement: it should be possible to render the cube with fewer than 165 instances of `\verb`.


RubiksCube() is special in that there are many spaces in latex rendering. It seems not worth the effort to implement a general fix for such special cases and take the risk of unexpected side effects. Instead one may use `_html_()` to give customized html+mathjax rendering, as done in #11362.
