The method for number fields iterates over the points of bounded height for each coordinate. This includes all the appropriate points, but includes some other points that are larger than the specified bound.

```
B=3
K.<v>=QuadraticField(3)
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(K,2)
for Q in P.points_of_bounded_height(bound=B):
    if exp(Q.global_height()) > B+0.001:
        print(Q,exp(Q.global_height()))
```

<a id='comment:1'></a>The simplest fix here is probably to check the height before yielding the point. This is not efficient, but would yield correct results, since every correct point does occur in this method.

If I don't hear another suggestion before I have time to fix this, I'll implement that (hopefully in the next week or two).

It might be worth it to implement a temporary fix in the mean time.

``` 
sage: X(P([v,v,1])).global_height() - log((RR(5^(1/3))))

I think the right fix here is not to just check inequality, but to also check that the difference between the bounds is less than `tolerance`?
