Currently, the output of a derivative of a symbolic function has the annoying property that sagemath cannot read it back as input, for example the following does not work because `D` is not defined.

```
sage: function('f'); var('x y')                                                                                                                                                                                                
sage: diff(f(x+y),x)                                                                                                                                                                                               
D[0](f)(x + y)
sage: D[0](f)(x + 2*y)
```

This ticket implements such a derivative operator that fixes this inconsistency.

It may be worth comparing with 

https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/xBHw11qUARg/m/0eqj3eUFsFkJ

```
from sage.symbolic.operators import FDerivativeOperator
class Doperator:
    def __init__(self, vars=None):
        self.vars = [] if vars is None else vars

    def __call__(self, f):
        return FDerivativeOperator(f, self.vars)

    def __getitem__(self, i):
        if isinstance(i, tuple):
            newvars = self. vars+list(i)
        else:
            newvars = self.vars+[i]
        return Doperator(newvars)

D=Doperator() 
```
which allows the bracket notation that is also output:

```
sage: var('x,y')
sage: D[0](f)(x, y)/x + D[0, 1](f)(x, y)
D[0](f)(x, y)/x + D[0, 1](f)(x, y) 
```
It also avoids an extra class definition, but that's probably more a matter of taste.

My solution is a bit stricter with the syntax and doesn't allow things like `D(f)` or `D[0][0](f)`, which is why I need two separate classes. But I don't mind the other solution either. The important thing for me is that input and output are consistent.

I don't understand this. Is there a problem with putting the definition in `sage/symbolic/operators.py`?

> and whether we can actually claim D in the global namespace for it.

I don't think having `D` in the global namespace is a big problem; already we have several single letter functions predefined in the global namespace even for pretty exotic things (such as `r` and `R` for the R programming language interpreter or `E` for the function returning the n-th root of unity as an element of the universal cyclotomic field). And `var('D')` will simply overwrite the newly introduced derivative operator, so existing code which uses variables called `D` will continue to work.
