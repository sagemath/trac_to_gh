This ticket adds:
- a method that, given a connected (di)graph `G = (V, E)`, return an iterator over the connected subgraphs `H = (V, F)`, where `F` is a subset of `E`. 
- parameter `induced` to method connected_subgraphs_iterator`. When set to `True`, the method iterates over induced connected subgraphs (current behavior). When set to `False`, the method yields in addition the non-induced subgraphs.
- parameter `edges_only` to yield list of edges instead of graphs or list of vertices.

This is a proposal for iterating over all non-induced subgraphs of a graph. I'm not sure that the name of the method is the best choice, but I don't have better proposals.

In my application I have a simple graph `G` with positive integer weights on its edges and an integer `k`. I need to iterate through subset of edges 
- whose corresponding subgraph is connected
- of size at most `k` (the argument `min_edges` works for this)
- of total weight at least `k` (there is no such thing yet)

This ticket is still a good step forward. Thanks.
