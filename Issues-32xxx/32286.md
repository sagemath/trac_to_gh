`gcd` in multivariate polynomial rings over `RR` (as well as `CC`, `CIF`, `CDF`, etc.) does not return the correct answer:

```
sage: F = PolynomialRing(RR, 'x,y').fraction_field()
sage: F.inject_variables()
Defining x, y
sage: gcd(x, x)
1.00000000000000
```
Note that the answer is correct for univariate polynomial rings over `RR`:

```
sage: F = PolynomialRing(RR, 'x').fraction_field()
sage: F.inject_variables()
Defining x
sage: gcd(x, x)
x
```

This might be related to #32285. See also #23909, #10771.
