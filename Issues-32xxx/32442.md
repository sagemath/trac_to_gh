Since Sage 9.4, it is possible to use an installation tree for Python packages separate from SAGE_LOCAL:
https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.4#For_developers:_..2Fconfigure_--prefix.3DSAGE_LOCAL_--with-sage-venv.3DSAGE_VENV

In this ticket we make a new setting `--with-sage-venv=auto` the default, which means: 
- if `--prefix` has not been used (so `SAGE_LOCAL=local`), then set `SAGE_VENV` to `local/var/lib/sage/venv-PYTHONVERSION`
Users can also pass `--with-sage-venv` or `--with-sage-venv=yes`, which means to unconditionally set `SAGE_VENV` to `SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/venv-PYTHONVERSION`.

(We keep the layout as is in incremental builds.)

By keying the default name to the Python version, we ensure that if the system python version changes (either because of system updates or explicit reconfiguration), we create a fresh venv and automatically rebuild all Python packages, eliminating problems such as the one reported in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/hZPHxqn_Cyk/m/fOAZCUWHAQAJ

Moreover, at `config.status` time, we create a symbolic link `SAGE_ROOT/venv -> SAGE_VENV` (overwriting an existing symbolic link)

The link is for easy access by users and is not used otherwise. Instead of `local/lib/python3/site-packages/` or `local/bin/sage`, use `venv/local/lib/python3/site-packages/` etc.

For symmetry, we also create a symbolic link `SAGE_ROOT/prefix -> SAGE_LOCAL`. (This generalizes what is already done by `tox local`.)

Users will still be able to restore the previous behavior by using `--with-sage-venv=no`, or use a specific path as in `--with-sage-venv=/path/to/venv`.

Yes, in an incremental build, nothing should change (except that this symlink is created).

After a `make distclean`, the new behavior will show

In particular, `local/local` points to itself, and so `venv-python3.9` doesn't point anywhere. `venv-python3.9` should probably point to `../local/....`. I don't know what the `local` symlink is supposed to do.

Everything still builds, so this is obviously not crucial, but it doesn't look right.
