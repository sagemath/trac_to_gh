We extend the global binding `symbolic_expression` to accept a callable such as those created by `lambda` expressions.

The result is a callable symbolic expression, in which the formal arguments of the callable are the symbolic arguments.

Example:

```
symbolic_expression(lambda x,y: x^2+y^2) == (SR.var("x")^2 + SR.var("y")^2).function(SR.var("x"), SR.var("y"))
```

This will provide convenient syntax in particular in connection to `ConditionSet` (#32089).

Instead of 

```
sage: predicate(x, y, z) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) < 12  # preparser syntax, creates globals
sage: ConditionSet(ZZ^3, predicate)
```
one would then be able to write

```
sage: ConditionSet(ZZ^3, symbolic_expression(lambda x, y, z: 
....:     sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) < 12))
```
