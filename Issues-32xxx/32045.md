These variables are unused (and do not have a legitimate use any more).

If there are user packages around that use it... they will need repackaging as pip-installable packages anyway.

Basically `lazy_import` would work. However, it isn't allowed in there. So we basically need to copy it to create a small `deprecated_string_class`. All the special methods need to be copied, which is annoying but trivial.

What do you think about this solution?

I don't really think anyone will notice

```
fbissey@tarazed ~/sandbox/git-personal/sage $ grep -rI SAGE_ETC src/
src/bin/sage-env:    export SAGE_ETC="$SAGE_LOCAL/etc"
src/sage/env.py:SAGE_ETC = var("SAGE_ETC", join(SAGE_LOCAL, "etc"))
fbissey@tarazed ~/sandbox/git-personal/sage $ grep -rI SAGE_INC src/
src/sage/env.py:SAGE_INC = var("SAGE_INC", join(SAGE_LOCAL, "include"))
```
OK, there is one thing that need attention

```
build/pkgs/notebook/spkg-install.in:ETC_JUPYTER="$SAGE_ETC"/jupyter
```

But `SAGE_INC` can disappear now and no-one will miss it.

I originally just meant that we should deprecate the Python variables in `sage.env`. 
Things in `build` that use environment variables set by `sage-env` are unaffected by that.

But we could, of course, also just remove the environment variables, too. Any user package that uses them should certainly be updated anyway to become properly pip-installable.
