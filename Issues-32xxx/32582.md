Thank you for this implementation. I have a few comments/questions.

Why should `_RightQuantumWord` be internal? It seems like it would be okay as a separate class (in the `braid.py` file).

Why is `_deformed_burau_matrix` hidden? It seems like it would be useful for other people using the braid group class.

I think `_quantum_determinant` should not be in `braid.py`, much less as a method of the braid group elements. The question then becomes where is a good home for this function. I am thinking it is best as a method on matrices. You should also add in the definition to the docstring and make it unhidden.

While it is unlikely, I don't think we should have the caching of `colored_jones_polynomial` depend on the variable and `try_inverse`. The cached version would have a fixed choice of variable, such as `q`. Probably the better thing to do here is to manually handle the cache with an attribute, e.g., `self._colored_jones_poly`. The other option is to have the cached part be a separate hidden method (and ``@`cached_method` can take a key function, where we can ignore the `try_inverse` input).

I am not a big fan of the `for` loop in `_colored_jones_sum`. While there might be some code duplication, having it as a `while` loop makes it easier to understand the logic IMO (which can be seen as you won't need the comment).

Replying to [tscrim](#comment%3A10):

Thanks for taking a look and the comments!

Both for `_RightQuantumWord` and the `_deformed_burau_matrix`, I couldn't image that they would be used in any other context than in calculating the colored Jones, but why not, let's expose those, there might be some other uses.

Looking around where to put this, I found a `quantum_determinant` method of `QuantumMatrixCoordinate`.

```
sage: O = algebras.QuantumMatrixCoordinate(3)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
sage: O.quantum_determinant()                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
x[1,1]*x[2,2]*x[3,3] - q*x[1,1]*x[2,3]*x[3,2] - q*x[1,2]*x[2,1]*x[3,3] + q^2*x[1,2]*x[2,3]*x[3,1] + q^2*x[1,3]*x[2,1]*x[3,2] - q^3*x[1,3]*x[2,2]*x[3,1]
```
 However this is in its current form not useful for our purposes, since it cannot be accessed without creating the an instance of `QuantumMatrixCoordinate` and this is slow.

I aimed to address all review comments as outlined in the reply above. 
After looking into it, I'm now not using an attribute, but cache the function 
`_colored_jones_sum`, using always `q` as a variable first and then substituting if necessary. This seems to work as intended:

```
sage: b = BraidGroup(5)([1,2,4,2,-4,-2,3,-2,-1,2,3,1,2,4])
sage: %time b.colored_jones_polynomial(2, try_inverse=False)
CPU times: user 2.14 s, sys: 9.22 ms, total: 2.15 s
Wall time: 2.15 s
q - q^2 + 2*q^3 - q^4 + q^5 - q^6
sage: %time b.colored_jones_polynomial(2, try_inverse=False)
CPU times: user 24.6 ms, sys: 33 µs, total: 24.6 ms
Wall time: 24.3 ms
q - q^2 + 2*q^3 - q^4 + q^5 - q^6
sage: %time b.colored_jones_polynomial(2, 'z', try_inverse=False)
CPU times: user 27.2 ms, sys: 263 µs, total: 27.4 ms
Wall time: 26.9 ms
z - z^2 + 2*z^3 - z^4 + z^5 - z^6
sage: %time b.colored_jones_polynomial(2, 'z', try_inverse=True)
CPU times: user 167 ms, sys: 101 ms, total: 268 ms
Wall time: 267 ms
z - z^2 + 2*z^3 - z^4 + z^5 - z^6
```

We now use the new `quantum_determinant`. 
Not sure why lint on github is still failing, I at least made sure that now pep8 errors appear in the code I added. Also, I hope I now got the formatting for the doc strings correct.

Thank you. It is looking very good. I made some additional changes; most are minor tweaks for PEP8 (and breaking the 80 char/line rule when I felt it made things more readable) and documentation. The two biggest changes is I made are (1) the caching is now associated to `colored_jones_polynomial` so the quantum determinant did not have to be computed multiple times; (2) made `RightQuantumWord.to_tuples()` into a lazy attribute.

If my changes are good, then you can set a positive review.

I also was able to get an ~8x speedup by being more careful about where objects live and knowing a bit about the internal workings of `FreeAlgebra`:

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(4)
sage: b = B([1,1,1,2,-1,2,-3,2,-3])
sage: %time b.colored_jones_polynomial(2)
CPU times: user 1.4 s, sys: 4 ms, total: 1.4 s
Wall time: 1.4 s
q^-1 - 2 + 4*q - 5*q^2 + 6*q^3 - 5*q^4 + 4*q^5 - 3*q^6 + q^7
```
Before this took about 12s. I don't see any other obvious way to speed this up further. With this new version, I can now do the `N=3` case for the above in a reasonable amount of time:

```
sage: %time b.colored_jones_polynomial(3)
CPU times: user 34.6 s, sys: 104 ms, total: 34.7 s
Wall time: 34.7 s
q^-4 - 2*q^-3 + 6*q^-1 - 8 - 2*q + 18*q^2 - 17*q^3 - 8*q^4 + 32*q^5 - 22*q^6

In the method `eps` of the class `RightQuantumWord`,
the auxiliary function `eps_monom`'s docstring should
come first:

```diff
         def eps_monom(q_tuple):
-            q = self.q
             r"""Evaluate the map $\mathcal{E}_N$ for a single mononial."""
+            q = self.q
```

For a follow-up ticket if you care enough.
