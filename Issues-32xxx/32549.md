MPIR, a fork of GMP, has not been updated upstream. The latest release, 3.0.0, is from 2017-03-01 (https://mpir.org/downloads.html). 

Sage currently provides an SPKG for MPIR as a configurable alternative to GMP. We should remove this option and package, as previously suggested in #29620#comment:10

Regardless of the state of MPIR upstream, sage never really developed a coherent plan for packages that are substitutes for one another. The `./configure` options that are available now don't really make sense, and the best thing to do for our end users is to eliminate the confusion (if also the choice). If someone later wants to overhaul the build system to handle these choices consistently, then OK; but I don't think anyone does right now.

this option should be renamed `gmp`, and respective tests should drop `# optional` tag.
Indeed, it just calls a gmp/mpir function (which are more or less the same, and mpir provided a replacement for gmp there).

```
sage: 100.binomial(45, algorithm='mpir')
61448471214136179596720592960
```
see, it still works, without any mpir installed.
