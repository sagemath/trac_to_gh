```
The zn_poly SPKG is used by sage in only one place. In hypellfrob.cpp's `interval_products_wrapper()`, there is a case...

```C++
if (!force_ntl  &&  modulus <= (1UL << (ULONG_BITS - 1)) - 1)
{
   // Small modulus; let's try using zn_poly if we're allowed.
   ...
```

But sometimes that fails, and the fallback is to use NTL anyway. The zn_poly project was abandoned upstream in 2008:

  https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~davidharvey/code/zn_poly/index.html

We've forked it to keep it building on modern systems,

  https://gitlab.com/sagemath/zn_poly

but the build system is still a mess. Erik started an autotools branch (https://gitlab.com/sagemath/zn_poly/-/tree/autotooling), but it never got finished, because the source layout is a bit weird for autotools and it should most likely be redone from scratch.

And zn_poly is not packaged in Gentoo because of how many hacks it still requires to build on a distro with stronger user experience expectations:

  https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/sci-libs/zn_poly/zn_poly-0.9.2.ebuild

In short, we're not getting a lot of benefit out of zn_poly these days, and nothing breaks if we remove it, because the one function that uses it falls back to the more-reliable NTL anyway.

In this ticket we remove the zn_poly SPKG, to avoid having to rewrite its build system some day.

Ah, I didn't see `matrix()` at the bottom of `hypellfrob.h`. Ok. Do you have a plan for benchmarking? I can throw random inputs at it but I don't want to unfairly bias the results with poor choices for test cases.

It's maintained by the sage team and essentially has been (via patches) for over a decade. With all due respect, if he's not going to help maintain the code, what can his opinion change?

If there's a huge performance regression (I'll need help with realistic test cases that don't make zn_poly fail and fall back to NTL unusually often), then we'll have to keep it around until NTL gets faster. But otherwise, the decision whether to keep it for nostalgia's sake alone should rest with the people who are going to have to maintain it.

<a id='comment:8'></a>I've been throwing examples at this for an hour or so. I've hacked my local tree to make `hypellfrob` take a `force_ntl` parameter, and to alert me when zn_poly fails and falls back to NTL. I've been picking my `p,Q,N` by hand for lack of a better approach.

I'll cut to the chase: the biggest difference between the two in favor of zn_poly is on the order of...

```
sage: %timeit hypellfrob(p, 3, f, force_ntl=False)
864 ms ± 5.09 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
sage: %timeit hypellfrob(p, 3, f, force_ntl=True)
1.2 s ± 5.06 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```

Typically, they're a bit closer together, with zn_poly having a slight edge. And when zn_poly fails, of course, the NTL-only strategy wins by a huge margin (however long it takes zn_poly to fail).

So the question is, is a slowdown like this (for the cases that zn_poly can handle) a deal-breaker, considering the improvement in the cases it cannot?
