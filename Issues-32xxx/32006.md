Some minor problems in our tutorial:

- The link to "Dive into Python" is no longer valid. I also don't see a reason to highlight this particular site, so instead let's just point to the official python.org beginner's guide, which lists Dive into Python and many others.

- Jmol is no longer the default way of producing 3d plots.

- The reference [Ip] is broken and (fortunately) is unused, so delete it.

- Standardize the punctuation in the bibliography a bit: if the entry just has "Name, URL", then don't put a period at the end.

```
Несмотря на то, что значительная часть Sage использует Python, для чтения
этого пособия знание Python не требуется. Вам стоит изучить Python в будущем
(очень интересный язык!), и для этого существует немало отличных ресурсов:
многие из них перечислены в Python Beginner's Guide [PyB]_. Если вы хотите
попробовать Sage быстро, вам стоит начать с этого пособия. Итак:
