Some minor problems in our tutorial:

- The link to "Dive into Python" is no longer valid. I also don't see a reason to highlight this particular site, so instead let's just point to the official python.org beginner's guide, which lists Dive into Python and many others.

- Jmol is no longer the default way of producing 3d plots.

- The reference [Ip] is broken and (fortunately) is unused, so delete it.

- Standardize the punctuation in the bibliography a bit: if the entry just has "Name, URL", then don't put a period at the end.

I did the Spanish and Japanese. I just fed stuff to Google for the Portuguese and Russian. I asked someone to check my Japanese. I can also do that for the Russian. I don't know anyone who speaks Portuguese however, but it looks correct from the Spanish similarities.
