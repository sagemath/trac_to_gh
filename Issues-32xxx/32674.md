Currently the `WeylGroup` and `WeylCharacterRing` do not work for the boundary case A0 (i.e., representation theory of the circle group). The fix is quite simple.

It is a degenerate case compared to the rest of the theory. However, this will be okay, although some of the other implementations of the Coxeter group might not work. These should also be checked with doctests added.

I think since this fix is quite minimal, it won't introduce any new issues by itself; if other functionalities are found not working, we can fix them case by case.
