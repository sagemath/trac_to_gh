Currently the `WeylGroup` and `WeylCharacterRing` do not work for the boundary case A0 (i.e., representation theory of the circle group). The fix is quite simple.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32674

It is a degenerate case compared to the rest of the theory. However, this will be okay, although some of the other implementations of the Coxeter group might not work. These should also be checked with doctests added.

I think since this fix is quite minimal, it won't introduce any new issues by itself; if other functionalities are found not working, we can fix them case by case.

Sorry but I don't think the fix is needless: `WeylCharacterRing("A0")` and its elements now work properly while it didn't work before (which is what I wanted to fix, instead of writing an ad hoc version just for the circle group).

That said, I'll try to add the other doctests as requested.
