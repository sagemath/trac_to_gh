I think since this fix is quite minimal, it won't introduce any new issues by itself; if other functionalities are found not working, we can fix them case by case.

Sorry but I don't think the fix is needless: `WeylCharacterRing("A0")` and its elements now work properly while it didn't work before (which is what I wanted to fix, instead of writing an ad hoc version just for the circle group).
