$ ./sage --docbuild file=stuff.py html
[html     ] Configuration error:
[html     ] There is a programmable error in your configuration file:
[html     ] Traceback (most recent call last):
[html     ]   File "[...]/sage/local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sphinx/config.py", line 328, in eval_config_file

[html     ]     extensions.remove('multidocs') # see #29651
[html     ] ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list
```

Proposed fix: Wrap the offending lines in `contextlib.suppress(ValueError)`.
