In the early testings the patchbot failed on startup time and after switching to lazy imports it didn't anymore.
I know that this shouldn't have worked but somehow it did.. or the startup time test is more or less random.

yes, please. In my opinion, there is no point in lazy-importing things that you use on the next line.

Also, do not take the patchbot reports too litteraly. They are hints of things that may need to be fixed. There is no strict requirement for a full green patchbot report.
