We implement lazy Dirichlet series.  For example,

```
sage: L = LazyDirichletSeriesRing(ZZ, "z")
sage: g = L(constant=1); g
1 + 1/(2^z) + 1/(3^z) + ...
sage: g*g
1 + 2/2^z + 2/3^z + 3/4^z + 2/5^z + 4/6^z + 2/7^z + ...
sage: [number_of_divisors(n) for n in range(1, 8)]
[1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2]

sage: mu = L(moebius); mu
1 + -1/2^z + -1/3^z + -1/5^z + 1/(6^z) + -1/7^z + ...
sage: g*mu
1 + ...

sage: g = L([0], constant=1)
sage: F = L(None)
sage: F.define(1 + g*F)
sage: ff = [F[i] for i in range(1, 16)]; ff
[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 8, 1, 3, 3]
sage: oeis(ff)                              # optional, internet
0: A002033: Number of perfect partitions of n.

<a id='comment:20'></a>Thank you Travis!

I think it would be good to split `LazyLaurentSeries.__call__` into subroutines, 110 lines of code don't fit on a screen and I find it hard to see the execution path.

line 1993:

```
            if (not isinstance(g, LazyDirichletSeries)
                and isinstance(g._coeff_stream, Stream_exact)
                and not g._coeff_stream._constant):
```
I think it might be better to say

```
            if (isinstance(g, LazyCauchyProductSeries)
                and isinstance(g._coeff_stream, Stream_exact)
                and not g._coeff_stream._constant):
```

line 2054:

```
        # Perhaps we just don't yet know if the valuation is positive
        if g._coeff_stream._approximate_order <= 0:
            if any(g._coeff_stream[i] for i in range(g._coeff_stream._approximate_order, 1)):
                raise ValueError("can only compose with a positive valuation series")
            g._coeff_stream._approximate_order = 1
```
looks suspicious for lazy Dirichlet series, because if the approximate order is 1 then we do not have positive valuation.

With the major points/cases commented, I think it is fine (you can just have your editor fold the different cases to see the larger structure). However, if you want to split it and handle all of the documentation stuff, then go ahead an do it.

That is the generic code, it then falls into the next if statement, which is the Dirichlet specialized code, to check explicitly the `approximate order == 1` case. I tweaked the code so that it does update `g._coeff_stream._approximate_order = 2` since it knows that at that point.

<a id='comment:42'></a>One problem is, that `R(x)` in `_element_constructor_` succeeds:

```
        R = self._laurent_poly_ring
        BR = self.base_ring()
        try:
            # Try to build stuff using the polynomial ring constructor
            x = R(x)

`R` is the `Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in z over Lazy Dirichlet Series Ring in s over Rational Field`, and `x` is converted into a lazy Dirichlet series, because it is callable.

<a id='comment:53'></a>Unfortunately, allowing exotic base rings for `LazyDirichletSeriesRing` involves some work, because its 'truncated ring'  is currently simply the symbolic ring.

Here is, what might become a doctest:

```
        In the next example the argument is interpreted as a constant
        polynomial, which happens to be a Dirichlet series::

            sage: D = LazyDirichletSeriesRing(QQ, "s")
            sage: E = LazyDirichletSeriesRing(D, "t")
            sage: E(lambda n: 1/factorial(n))

        We can also specify that the given function should be
        interpreted as the coefficients of the Laurent series::

            sage: E(coefficients=lambda n: 1/factorial(n))[:10]
```

I completely forgot about `finite_part`, etc.  I guess we will have to resolve this in this ticket, or should we postpone it further?

<a id='comment:56'></a>Here is code that I just wrote, but I'm not sure how helpful it is.
Right now it seems more useful to me to have a method that turns a *list* into a series, because what I wrote below doesn't work for the Dirichlet case, unless we force the developer to write a class for Dirichlet polynomials.  (I am not against writing this class, I am against making the framework harder to extend.)

<a id='comment:57'></a>Dear Travis!

Since the lazy backend is now merged, I think it would be good to attempt progress on this one.

I am not sure how fruitful it is to think about `finite_part`, `_polynomial_part` and `polynomial` now.  Possibly it is best to remove `finite_part` from this ticket entirely, and think about it when finalizing #32324. See also comment:55.

Another, different thing to consider: I'm afraid that eventually it is necessary to have a proper `truncated ring` structure for `_laurent_poly_ring` (warning, misnomer), because eventually somebody will want to do computations over exotic coefficient rings.  See comment:53.

Finally, I noticed that exact multiplication is commented out for Dirichlet series, because it is slow.  This is true, of course.  I guess, however, what is really slow and badly done and should be improved in a separate ticket is the fallback mechanism for composition, currently only used for Dirichlet series:

```python
        if isinstance(g, LazyDirichletSeries):
            if g._coeff_stream._approximate_order == 1:
                if g._coeff_stream[1] != 0:
                    raise ValueError("can only compose with a positive valuation series")
                g._coeff_stream._approximate_order = 2
            # we assume that the valuation of self[i](g) is at least i
            def coefficient(n):
                return sum(self[i] * (g**i)[n] for i in range(n+1))
            coeff_stream = Stream_function(coefficient, P._coeff_ring, P._sparse, 1)
            return P.element_class(P, coeff_stream)
```
Note that `(g**i)[n]` will compute terms which are finally thrown away again.  I am guessing that the correct solution would be a generic composition class in `stream.py`.

To conclude: how about removing `finite_part`, and open new tickets (possibly recycling some ticket numbers) for the three points above, and be done with it for now?

I had to try a few different things, but I think I settled on something that works well and eliminates a lot of duplication.\n\nThe main thing I did was implement an `_internal_poly_ring` attribute that uses a Laurent poly ring to parse in lists and the like for Dirichlet series as a transient object for the `_element_constructor_`. I guess this could be replaced by the `_coeff_ring` in the Taylor series ticket. Now everything flows through one `_element_constructor_` with a little bit of data prep for the Dirichlet series.\n\nI fixed up the documentation and fixed some other failures from the file renaming I didn't catch earlier (thank you patchbots). I also removed mostly duplicate `change_ring()`. I renamed `monomial` to `_monomial` and implemented a fallback option for Dirichlet series.\n\nI removed the `finite_part()` as we can reintroduce that later when we need it.\n\nI agree with you that the best way to implement composition would be to add another `Stream` subclass to store the intermediate powers in the generic case.",

<a id='comment:59'></a>Sorry for not being able to get to this sooner. I had to try a few different things, but I think I settled on something that works well and eliminates a lot of duplication.

The main thing I did was implement an `_internal_poly_ring` attribute that uses a Laurent poly ring to parse in lists and the like for Dirichlet series as a transient object for the `_element_constructor_`. I guess this could be replaced by the `_coeff_ring` in the Taylor series ticket. Now everything flows through one `_element_constructor_` with a little bit of data prep for the Dirichlet series.

I fixed up the documentation and fixed some other failures from the file renaming I didn't catch earlier (thank you patchbots). I also removed mostly duplicate `change_ring()`. I renamed `monomial` to `_monomial` and implemented a fallback option for Dirichlet series.

I removed the `finite_part()` as we can reintroduce that later when we need it.

I agree with you that the best way to implement composition would be to add another `Stream` subclass to store the intermediate powers in the generic case.

<a id='comment:60'></a>Wow, you put in a lot of work!

I don't really understand the meaning of `_internal_poly_ring` yet.

There is one issue, which is important to me (and a doctest in the Taylor ticket, which, for some reason, I overlooked while backporting).  I am against ordinary polynomials being re-interpreted as Dirichlet series.  This is going to be a source of bugs which are very hard to understand.

```
sage: D = LazyDirichletSeriesRing(ZZ, 't')
sage: m = D(moebius); m
1 - 1/(2^t) - 1/(3^t) - 1/(5^t) + 1/(6^t) - 1/(7^t) + O(1/(8^t))
sage: P.<x, y> = QQ[]
sage: L.<z> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(P)
sage: L(m)
z - z^2 - z^3 - z^5 + z^6 - z^7 + O(z^8)
```
Also, continuing with the definitions above, I think the below is at least fishy:

```
sage: R.<q> = QQ[]
sage: L(q)
z
sage: L(x)
x
sage: D(q)
1
sage: L(q^-1)
z^-1
sage: D(q^-1)
1
sage: D(x)
<repr(<sage.rings.lazy_series_ring.LazyDirichletSeriesRing_with_category.element_class at 0x7faeaca0c640>) failed: TypeError: number of arguments does not match number of variables in parent>
```

Note that the element constructor for polynomials is stricter here, and I think that this is how it should be:

```
sage: R(x)
...
TypeError: not a constant polynomial
```

It is something that we use to internally to manipulate things. Mainly it is a way around the `shift` issue (although with a bit more data preprocessing in the Dirichlet `_element_constructor_`, it might become redundant; this was the lazier approach).

I have fixed it so that `D(q^-1)` no longer thinks it is a valid series.

I am pretty sure we cannot do anything better here because we take callables as valid input and perhaps someone wants to use a polynomial (which doesn't convert into the internal poly ring) to compute coefficients. I believe your previous code would have the same behavior.

I cannot remember what the `shift` issue is, sorry.

> When you say ordinary polynomials, do you mean Laurent/Taylor/etc. series?


Both.  I think that all of the following should raise errors:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: D = LazyDirichletSeriesRing(QQ, 't')
sage: P.<q> = QQ[]
sage: D(z) # this is extremely fishy, the result is not in the correct ring
z
sage: D(q)
1
sage: D(q) == D(1)
True
sage: L(D([1,2,3]))
z + 2*z^2 + 3*z^3
```

I was actually mistaken that the polynomial ring would be much stricter, there seems to be some inconsistency:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: S.<q> = QQ[]
sage: T.<t> = QQ[]
sage: T(q)
t
sage: T(x)
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: not a constant polynomial
```

> I am pretty sure we cannot do anything better here because we take callables as valid input and perhaps someone wants to use a polynomial (which doesn't convert into the internal poly ring) to compute coefficients. I believe your previous code would have the same behavior.


At least before your work, using a polynomial `p` as a callable (via the `coefficients` argument) would produce the series with coefficients `p(0), p(1), ...` in the Laurent case, which I think is fine.

What I think is not correct is that a (Laurent or ordinary) polynomial or a Laurent of Dirichlet series is interpreted as a sequence of coefficients.  This didn't happen before, at least not in the Taylor ticket code.
