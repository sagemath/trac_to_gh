Extend `MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values` so it can convert inexact integer values from numerical solvers to `ZZ` and `bool`, with tolerance checking.

We apply it to one use of MIP in `sage.graphs`.

Other fixes using the new option will be tracked in #32191.

<a id='comment:2'></a>I would suggest to distinguish two cases explicitly:

a) if it is known that in an exact LP/MIP computation, the value would be either 0 or 1, then:
   {{{
   if abs(value) < tolerance:
       return False
   if abs(value - 1) < tolerance:
       return True
   raise RuntimeError("integrality tolerance exceeded - modeling error or numerical difficulties?")
   }}}

b) if in an exact computation, the value would be either 0, 1, or a fractional value, a separate helper function should be used in order to distinguish these three outcomes. This is a typical situation in iterative rounding algorithms.


The default tolerances for the two cases a) and b) could be chosen quite differently.

Yes, this is what I was referring to.

The point is that users need to be able to do this conversion with error checking even for certain variables that are NOT declared as integer/binary to the solver.

Integer structure of the polyhedron might be automatic, but the objective function might be non-integer. Then with floating point YMMV.

<a id='comment:17'></a>Here's a proposed interface:

```
    def get_values(self, *lists, convert=None, tolerance=None):
        r"""
        Return values found by the previous call to ``solve()``.

        INPUT:

        - ``*lists`` -- any instance of ``MIPVariable`` (or one of its elements),
          or lists of them.

        - ``convert`` -- ``None`` (default), ``ZZ``, ``bool``, or ``True``.

          - if ``convert=None``, return all variable values as elements of the
            :meth:`base_ring`.

          - if ``convert=ZZ``, convert all variable values from the :meth:`base_ring`
            by rounding to the nearest integer.

          - if ``convert=bool``, convert all variable values from the :meth:`base_ring`
            by rounding to 0/1 and converting to ``bool``.

          - if ``convert=True``, use ``ZZ`` for MIP variables declared integer or binary
            and ``None`` for all other variables.

        - ``tolerance`` -- nonnegative real number.  Required if ``convert`` is
          not ``None``.  If the variable value differs from the nearest integer by
          more than ``tolerance``, raise a ``RuntimeError``.

```
Simpler than what I suggested in comment 8 above and more discoverable than putting this in a separate method.
