CC:  @mkoeppe @tscrim @dimpase @davewittemorris @seblabbe

Extend `MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values` so it can convert inexact integer values from numerical solvers to `ZZ` and `bool`, with tolerance checking.

We apply it to one use of MIP in `sage.graphs`.

Other fixes using the new option will be tracked in #32191.


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32197

I would suggest to distinguish two cases explicitly:

a) if it is known that in an exact LP/MIP computation, the value would be either 0 or 1, then:
   {{{
   if abs(value) < tolerance:
       return False
   if abs(value - 1) < tolerance:
       return True
   raise RuntimeError("integrality tolerance exceeded - modeling error or numerical difficulties?")
   }}}

b) if in an exact computation, the value would be either 0, 1, or a fractional value, a separate helper function should be used in order to distinguish these three outcomes. This is a typical situation in iterative rounding algorithms.


The default tolerances for the two cases a) and b) could be chosen quite differently.

The point is that users need to be able to do this conversion with error checking even for certain variables that are NOT declared as integer/binary to the solver.
