Marc, apologies for taking so long for a response. Your changes here look good to me, thank you! There is one thing that should be fixed:

- In one of the examples this branch adds there is `sage: basy = asy.exact_part() + A(B(asy.error_part().summands.pop().growth, coefficient=1/3))` where `B` is a `BTermMonoid` -- it is probably easier to not construct the monoid directly, but rather use the method of the asymptotic ring `A.B` to create the `BTerm`. Otherwise you will have to specify the bound which the term is valid from; this currently causes doctest failures.

And one thing I am curious about:

- You generate a tuple of the string representations of the generators using `gens_str = tuple(str(g) for g in self.parent().growth_group.gens_monomial())`, instead of `gens_str = tuple(str(g) for g in self.parent().gens()` -- do you, by any chance, recall why you chose to do that? The `AsymptoticRing.gens` does a somewhat similar thing, it takes the monomial_gens of the growth group, but instead of returning the string representation of that, it creates an exact term with coefficient 1, so the string representations should be the same. Is that maybe not the case with some particular choices of the coefficient ring?

I'm also happy to fix the doctest, just let me know!

No problem at all. Thank you for the review!

Done in the last commit.

Yes, for inexact rings(?) one has:

```
sage: A.<n> = AsymptoticRing('n^ZZ', RR)
sage: [str(g) for g in A.gens()]
['1.00000000000000*n']
sage: [str(g) for g in A.growth_group.gens_monomial()]
['n']
```
