This is so that the Sage library becomes fully functional even when not being run from within sage-env (which sets PATH).

To test (when cddlib is not present in the system but installed as SPKG):

```
venv/bin/python3 -c 'from sage.all import *; print(Polyhedron(vertices=[[1.123456789012345, 2.123456789012345]], base_ring=RDF))'
```
