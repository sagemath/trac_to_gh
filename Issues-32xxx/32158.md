We allow for ppl polyhedra to be mutable.

This is a preparation for allowing interactive modification. At the moment not much can be done, but to delay the calculation of `Vrepresentation` and `Hrepresentation`.

The goal is that `normaliz` and `polymake` use `Polyhedron_interactive` as well and allow adding generators/inequalities.

I'm just saying that `Polyhedron`, if no backend is given and `is_mutable=True` is passed, should select one of the backends that support mutation. As of this or a follow-up ticket, I guess that's only ppl.
