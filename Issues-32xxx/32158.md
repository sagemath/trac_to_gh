We allow for ppl polyhedra to be mutable.

This is a preparation for allowing interactive modification. At the moment not much can be done, but to delay the calculation of `Vrepresentation` and `Hrepresentation`.

The goal is that `normaliz` and `polymake` use `Polyhedron_interactive` as well and allow adding generators/inequalities.

Depends on #32157

IMO, the constructor `Polyhedron` should get an additional keyword argument `immutable=True` (unfortunately there's a bit of inconsistency - in the Sage library one finds all three of `immutable=`, `is_mutable=`, `is_immutable=`).
When `False`, it should select a suitable backend

I'm just saying that `Polyhedron`, if no backend is given and `is_mutable=True` is passed, should select one of the backends that support mutation. As of this or a follow-up ticket, I guess that's only ppl.

I fixed faces to be unhashable when taken from a mutable polyhedron (or that actually happens automatically). This means that in particular we cannot create graphs or hasse diagrams for faces.

I also invalidate all objects that point towards the polyhedron, when the polyhedron is changed. I don't know if this is good or if a user is responsible for not keeping objects pointing on polyhedra that might change.

I also changed the behavior to not recycle Vrepresentation and Hrepresentation objects when clearing the cache. This why I at least prevent that an representation object that a user keeps changes at some point.
