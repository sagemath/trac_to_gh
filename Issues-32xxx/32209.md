```
In SageMath 9.3, consider the following setting:

```
sage: S.<x,y> = AffineSpace(ZZ, 2)
sage: T.<u,v> = AffineSpace(ZZ, 2)
sage: h = T.hom([u + v, u * v], S); h
Scheme morphism:
  From: Affine Space of dimension 2 over Integer Ring
  To:   Affine Space of dimension 2 over Integer Ring
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (u, v) to
        (u + v, u*v)
```
The morphism `h` cannot be evaluated on points over **F**<sub>4</sub>:

```
sage: F.<a> = GF(4)
sage: P = T(F)(1, a)
sage: h(P)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: not in prime subfield
sage: h.change_ring(F)(P)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: (1, a) fails to convert into the map's domain Affine Space of dimension 2 over Finite Field in a of size 2^2,but a `pushforward` method is not properly implemented
```
There is no error when the coordinates are in the prime field, but the coordinates of the resulting point are in **Z** instead of **F**<sub>4</sub>:

```
sage: Q = T(F)(1, 0)
sage: Q.domain()
Spectrum of Finite Field in a of size 2^2
sage: h(Q)
(1, 0)
sage: h(Q).domain()
Spectrum of Integer Ring
```

With the patch, a morphism of affine schemes now happily returns values at points which clearly do not lie in its domain:

```sage
sage: S.<x,y> = AffineSpace(ZZ, 2)
sage: T.<u,v> = AffineSpace(ZZ, 2)
sage: C = Curve(x**2+y**2-1)
sage: f = C.hom([x,y],T)
sage: P = S([123,456])
sage: f.domain().defining_polynomial()(*P)
223064
sage: f(P)
(123, 456)
```

The following change should fix this according to my very limited testing. It is inspired by the projective case (which did already seem to detect points outside the domain).
