This meta-ticket tracks hyperbolic geometry issues,
whether they already have tickets or not.

- Add hyperbolic geometry tutorial
- Hyperbolic geometry: Rename `get_point` to `point`,
  `get_geodesic` to `geodesic`
- Hyperbolic geometry: Rename `show` to `plot`
- Hyperbolic geometry: Support number field coordinates
- #32362: HyperbolicGeodesicPD.plot can be wrong for CDF coordinates
- #32212: sage.geometry.hyperbolic_space: `__matmul__` for composition of isometries
- #22486: hyperboloid model accepts invalid points
- #23427: Fix intersection of hyperbolic geodesics

Note that there is an alternative implementation in the making at https://github.com/flatsurf/sage-flatsurf/pull/158
