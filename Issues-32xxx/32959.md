New packages are available here (with the corresponding checksums):

givaro: https://github.com/linbox-team/givaro/releases/tag/v4.2.0

fflas-ffpack: https://github.com/linbox-team/fflas-ffpack/releases/tag/v2.5.0

linbox: https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/releases/tag/v1.7.0

The new versions require "a C++ compiler supporting C++11 standard. More precisely g++ v5 or greater, clang++ v3.4 or greater".
So this ticket depends on dropping support for some systems, see #32074.

Of course. I just created this ticket to start working on a its branch, which will help us fix the last issues before cutting the final releases.
Btw, I did not manage to access to the full artifact of the givaro install log givaro which caused the failures in these github action builds (only the tail of the givaro-log is displayed in the sage build log in your link). Is there any way to access it? (I could not find it in the whole log archive).

Replying to [cpernet](#comment%3A5):
> I did not manage to access to the full artifact of the givaro install log givaro which caused the failures in these github action builds (only the tail of the givaro-log is displayed in the sage build log in your link). Is there any way to access it? (I could not find it in the whole log archive).


In each run, such as https://github.com/linbox-team/fflas-ffpack/runs/4383290866?check_suite_focus=true, there is a section "Print out logs for immediate inspection" in the output, which shows all logs of failing package builds in full.

When all jobs have completed, the summary page, such as https://github.com/linbox-team/fflas-ffpack/actions/runs/1526437644, gives access to the log artifacts.
For example, `logs-commit-3e42b4a1aaa585bce832738d5a8885dcf7c4273e-tox-docker-ubuntu-xenial-standard` (https://github.com/linbox-team/fflas-ffpack/suites/4521078418/artifacts/121757925) gives a zip file within which you will find `logs/pkgs/givaro-git.log`

I just released the three libraries and updated this branch with the corresponding checksums, and added the upstream_url as requested.

I could check that the testsuite passes on 2 machines (broadwell and skylake-X both running Linux mint).

I only had to comment out `local/include/factory/factory.h` line 92 (`#define IntegerDomain 1`), because this define by Singular gets in the way of Givaro's `Givaro::IntegerDomain`. See [https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/lC941Lab5ck](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/lC941Lab5ck)

`Givaro::IntegerDomain` is in the public API of Givaro, and used for instance by fflas-ffpack, but possibly other external users or libraries.
It is rather hard to justify such a change on Givaro's side. I'd like to investigate further the option of changing the include order.

Since v4.0.1 (2016-02-24).

It seems that are only left with the following options:
- delay the review of this ticket until Singular releases a new version including the fix, and all distros sage wants to support package it
- change givaro's API and fflas-ffpack usage of this API
- investigate the include chain and revert to a situation where singular is included after givaro and fflas-ffpack (this is probably why the problem did not show up previously)

Am I missing something?
