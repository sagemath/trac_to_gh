(split out from #31280)

As noted in ticket:31280#comment:65, this helps
for #30768 and hence for Python 3.10 compatibility.

Three packages are added, each becoming
a standard spkg.

## [charset-normalizer](https://pypi.org/project/charset-normalizer)

Added under the name `charset_normalizer`.

> "Charset Detection, for Everyone"

>
> A library that helps you read text from an unknown
> charset encoding.

>
> [...] All IANA character set names for which the
> Python core library provides codecs are supported.


## [idna](https://pypi.org/project/idna)

> Support for the Internationalised Domain Names
> in Applications (IDNA) protocol as specified
> in RFC 5891. This is the latest version of the
> protocol and is sometimes referred to as “IDNA 2008”.

>
> This library also provides support
> for Unicode Technical Standard 46, 
> Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing.

>
> This acts as a suitable replacement for the
> “encodings.idna” module that comes with the
> Python standard library, but which only supports
> the old, deprecated IDNA specification (RFC 3490).


## [urllib3](https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/)

> a powerful, user-friendly HTTP client for Python.
> [...]
> urllib3 brings many critical features that are
> missing from the Python standard libraries:

>
> - Thread safety.
> - Connection pooling.
> - Client-side SSL/TLS verification.
> - File uploads with multipart encoding.
> - Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.
> - Support for gzip, deflate, and brotli encoding.
> - Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.
> - 100% test coverage.
