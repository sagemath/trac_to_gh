(split out from #31280)

As noted in [#31280 comment:65](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31280#comment:65), this helps
for #30768 and hence for Python 3.10 compatibility.

Three packages are added, each becoming
a standard spkg.

## [charset-normalizer](https://pypi.org/project/charset-normalizer)

Added under the name `charset_normalizer`.

> "Charset Detection, for Everyone"

>
> A library that helps you read text from an unknown
> charset encoding.
>
> [...] All IANA character set names for which the
> Python core library provides codecs are supported.

## [idna](https://pypi.org/project/idna)

> Support for the Internationalised Domain Names
> in Applications (IDNA) protocol as specified
> in RFC 5891. This is the latest version of the
> protocol and is sometimes referred to as “IDNA 2008”.

>
> This library also provides support
> for Unicode Technical Standard 46, 
> Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing.
>
> This acts as a suitable replacement for the
> “encodings.idna” module that comes with the
> Python standard library, but which only supports
> the old, deprecated IDNA specification (RFC 3490).

## [urllib3](https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/)

> a powerful, user-friendly HTTP client for Python.
> [...]
> urllib3 brings many critical features that are
> missing from the Python standard libraries:

>
>- Thread safety.
>- Connection pooling.
>- Client-side SSL/TLS verification.
>- File uploads with multipart encoding.
>- Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.
>- Support for gzip, deflate, and brotli encoding.
>- Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.
>- 100% test coverage.

-As noted in [#31280 comment:65](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31280#comment:65), this will help for #30768 and hence for Python 3.10 compatibility
+As noted in [#31280 comment:65](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31280#comment:65), this helps
+for #30768 and hence for Python 3.10 compatibility.
 
+Three packages are added, each becoming
+a standard spkg.
+
+## [charset-normalizer](https://pypi.org/project/charset-normalizer)
+
+Added under the name `charset_normalizer`.
+
+> "Charset Detection, for Everyone"
+
+>
+> A library that helps you read text from an unknown
+> charset encoding.
+>
+> [...] All IANA character set names for which the
+> Python core library provides codecs are supported.
+
+## [idna](https://pypi.org/project/idna)
+
+> Support for the Internationalised Domain Names
+> in Applications (IDNA) protocol as specified
+> in RFC 5891. This is the latest version of the
+> protocol and is sometimes referred to as “IDNA 2008”.
+
+>
+> This library also provides support
+> for Unicode Technical Standard 46, 
+> Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing.
+>
+> This acts as a suitable replacement for the
+> “encodings.idna” module that comes with the
+> Python standard library, but which only supports
+> the old, deprecated IDNA specification (RFC 3490).
+
+## [urllib3](https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/)
+
+> a powerful, user-friendly HTTP client for Python.
+> [...]
+> urllib3 brings many critical features that are
+> missing from the Python standard libraries:
+
+>
+>- Thread safety.
+>- Connection pooling.
+>- Client-side SSL/TLS verification.
+>- File uploads with multipart encoding.
+>- Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.
+>- Support for gzip, deflate, and brotli encoding.
+>- Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.
+>- 100% test coverage.
