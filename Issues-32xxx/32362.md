This illustrates the wrong plotting:

```python
sage: D = HyperbolicPlane().PD()
sage: a = 0
sage: b = 1e-15 + 0.7*I
sage: geodesics = [
....:     D.get_geodesic(a, b),
....:     D.get_geodesic(CC(a), CC(b)),
....:     D.get_geodesic(CDF(a), CDF(b))
....: ]
sage: show(graphics_array([geod.plot() for geod in geodesics]))
```

```
sage: print(geodesics[2].plot()[0])
Arc

 ​angle 0.0
 ​inside the sector (-1.172273881128477,-0.6190660545826288)
```

The first two pictures show the expected output: a straight line from `0` to `0.7*I`. The last picture shows the buggy output: a short arc between two points near `0.7*I`. The printed output describes the arc in the buggy picture.

Attachment: **[geodesic_bug.png](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket32362/geodesic_bug.png)**

The current implementation of hyperbolic geodesics
relies on a conversion to the half-plane model.

Any geodesic `g` has its corresponding
half-plane model geodesic stored as
`g._cached_geodesic`.

The example geodesic has endpoints
I and 2.222222222222222e-14 + 5.666666666666666*I.

The corresponding complete geodesic is a
euclidean semicircle. Due to rounding errors
on its centre and radius, its endpoints are
computed in CDF as (-2.375, 1400000000000002.0),
whereas computations in CC give them much more
correctly as (0.0, 1.4e15).

Converting back to the disc model, the effect
is a disaster.

Aha! I suspect it's possible to find the ideal endpoints of a disk model geodesic in a more numerically stable way. I can work on a test implementation.

If the test implementation works well, do you know what we'd have to do to incorporate it into `hyperbolic_geodesic.py`? Is it just a matter of overriding `ideal_endpoints` in `HyperbolicGeodesicPD`?

Maybe unrelated or not (If you think it's unrelated I can open a new ticket on this) I've just discovered working on ticket [ticket:23427] that ideal endpoints on PD geodesics can be mapped to imag()<0 points which is an error, and when plotted often draw a geodesic int the lower half plane.
For example

```
Sage:    P = PD.get_point(-0.920704875684763 - 0.390259569889459*I)
Sage:    P
