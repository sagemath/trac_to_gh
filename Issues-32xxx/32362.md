Attachment [geodesic_bug.png](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket32362/geodesic_bug.png) by @slel created at 2021-08-14 21:01:18

The current implementation of hyperbolic geodesics
relies on a conversion to the half-plane model.

Any geodesic `g` has its corresponding
half-plane model geodesic stored as
`g._cached_geodesic`.

The example geodesic has endpoints
I and 2.222222222222222e-14 + 5.666666666666666*I.

The corresponding complete geodesic is a
euclidean semicircle. Due to rounding errors
on its centre and radius, its endpoints are
computed in CDF as (-2.375, 1400000000000002.0),
whereas computations in CC give them much more
correctly as (0.0, 1.4e15).

Converting back to the disc model, the effect
is a disaster.

Aha! I suspect it's possible to find the ideal endpoints of a disk model geodesic in a more numerically stable way. I can work on a test implementation.

If the test implementation works well, do you know what we'd have to do to incorporate it into `hyperbolic_geodesic.py`? Is it just a matter of overriding `ideal_endpoints` in `HyperbolicGeodesicPD`?

Maybe unrelated or not (If you think it's unrelated I can open a new ticket on this) I've just discovered working on ticket [ticket:23427] that ideal endpoints on PD geodesics can be mapped to imag()<0 points which is an error, and when plotted often draw a geodesic int the lower half plane.
For example

```
Sage:    P = PD.get_point(-0.920704875684763 - 0.390259569889459*I)
Sage:    P
Boundary point in PD -0.920704875684763 - 0.390259569889459*I
Sage:    UHP(P)
Boundary point in UHP -0.662253938491478 - 1.66533453693773e-16*I
```

```
sage: g=HyperbolicPlane().PD().random_geodesic()
Sage:  g
Geodesic in PD from -0.920704875684763 - 0.390259569889459*I to 0.0632992206159446 + 0.997994593507106*I
sage: g.to_model('UHP')  
Geodesic in UHP from -0.662253938491478 - 5.55111512312578e-17*I to 31.5642842686728 - 8.34887714518118e-14*I
