Currently, `pycodestyle-minimal` checks for E704 (multiple statements on one line (def)) while `pycodestyle` does not as this rule is not activated by default. In fact, the documentation says:
> In the default configuration, the checks E121, E123, E126, E133, E226, E241, E242, E704, W503, W504 and W505 are ignored because they are not rules unanimously accepted, and PEP 8 does not enforce them.

E704 is also not listed in the description of the tox env, so I guess it has been included only by accident instead of purpose.

For typing you often have constructions like 

```
    @overload
    def volume_form(self) -> DiffForm: ...
    @overload
    def volume_form(self, contra: int) -> TensorField: ...
    def volume_form(self, contra=0):
```
This is not are not working with E704, see #29775 for an example.
If one insists on E704, a correctly formated version would be

```
    @overload
    def volume_form(self) -> DiffForm:
       ...


    @overload
    def volume_form(self, contra: int) -> TensorField:
       ...


    def volume_form(self, contra=0):
```
which is pretty awkward due to the required 2 lines between function defs from the E3XX rules (which are not required for 'single line defs').
 
Also it's confusing that 'minimal' is checking for more than the default 'maximal' config.

Pretty sure that only 1 blank line is required between methods.

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#blank-lines
says
> Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.

> Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line.

So it depends where the function is defined.

Anyway, I still think E704 has been activated only by accident, since the comments in the tox file don't mention it and "pycodestyle-maximum" is not testing for it.
