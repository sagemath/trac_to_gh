... so that we can start writing `# optional - sage.symbolic` and similar.

We use it in #32432 (**sagemath-polyhedra**) to skip doctests that depend on `sage.graphs`, `sage.combinat`, `sage.rings.number_field` etc.

That's right -- this reflects the fact that our tags for optional packages use the spkg names, which use underscore, not dash.
