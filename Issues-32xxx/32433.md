From the description of the module:

"The whole problem of avoiding circular imports -- the reason for
existence of this file -- is now a non-issue, since some bugs in
Cython were fixed.  Probably all this code should be moved into the
relevant classes and this file deleted."

Also, misc being misc, it pulls in several libraries (flint, mpfr) at the same time. Another reason to get rid of this file.
