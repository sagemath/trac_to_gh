Currently, the `coefficient` method appear in the TAB-completion for a modular form, but an error occur when one tries to use it.

```
sage: f = ModularForms(1, 12).0
sage: f.coefficient # hit TAB
                    f.coefficient
                    f.coefficients
sage: f.coefficient(10)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'Sequence_generic' object has no attribute 'keys'

Hello Vincent, thank you very much for reviewing this!

I've tried the code with your example and, strangely, I got:

```
sage: f = ModularForms(1, 12).0
sage: f.coefficient(3/2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```

I have no idea why this happens, because you are indeed right, in the command line interface we do have:

```
sage: int(3/2)
1
```
