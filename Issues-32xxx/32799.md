Since mpmath 1.2.1, specifically since commit [1], mpmath checks for the SAGE_ROOT or MPMATH_SAGE env variables in order to enable sage types instead of relying on whether sage.all can be imported.

This breaks distro packages where SAGE_ROOT is undefined. I reported this upstream a while ago [2] with not much luck. Here we explicitly define MPMATH_SAGE in sage-env so mpmath uses Sage types in a Sage session even if SAGE_ROOT is not defined.

This is still broken when using sage as a python library (in which case sage-env is not read at all), but fixing that use case is beyond the scope of this ticket.
