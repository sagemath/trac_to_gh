When 
- either system packages `polymake` and `perl_cpan_polymake_prereq` are present (#31527) 
- or `--enable-polymake` is in use, 
this script package would be automatically required.

It will have `jupymake` and `perl_cpan_polymake_prereq` as dependencies, but as of this ticket not install anything otherwise. (In a later follow-up ticket, `sagemath_polymake` will install a Python distribution package **sagemath-polymake** with install-requires on **sagemath-polyhedra** and **jupymake**.)

Adding script packages of this type will be the general mechanism to activate modularized distributions of the Sage library. 
For example, presence of `tdlib` will make `sagemath_tdlib` required, etc.



Depends on #32918

if a package A has to trigger install of package B, this I think can be done in spkg-configure.m4 of A by setting the appropriate variable to `yes`, which
can be checked in spkg-configure.m4 of B.
Assuming A is a dependency of B, declared in its spkg-configure.m4 to make sure A is configured before B.

Any need for the more elaborate scheme?
