From a first quick look, it seems like there are just a few small things to address:

These need at least one doctest each:

```
    def __init__(self, base_ring):
        super().__init__(base_ring, names="z")
```

This can be simplified:

```diff
-    return CIS(lambda n: _cl_term(n))
+    return CIS(_cl_term)
```

We can also use (the cached)

```diff
-base_ring(1)
+base_ring.one()
```

We no longer have a `coefficients()` method (a difference between the implementations), right? We should introduce a deprecation message for this method or add it to the lazy series. I am leaning towards adding it to the lazy series as a redirect of `self[:n]`.

There is one doctest from a book which we cannot sensibly support anymore, see below.

In short:

```
  sage: L.<z> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
  sage: C = L()
  sage: C._name = 'C'
  sage: C.define( z + C * C )
```
must become

```
  sage: L.<z> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
  sage: C = L.undefined(valuation=1)
  sage: C.define( z + C * C )
```
Can I simply change this?  (Note that we do not support this recursive definition with valuation=0 anymore.)

Similarly, also in `src/sage/tests/books/computational-mathematics-with-sagemath/`, but `polynomes.tex`.

I think we can make `exponential` an alias, but `compute_coefficients` does not really make sense anymore.

```
  sage: L.<x> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
  sage: lazy_exp = x.exponential(); lazy_exp
  O(1)

Sage example in ./polynomes.tex, line 2039::

  sage: lazy_exp[5]

  sage: lazy_exp
  1 + x + 1/2*x^2 + 1/6*x^3 + 1/24*x^4 + 1/120*x^5 + O(x^6)

Sage example in ./polynomes.tex, line 2062::

  sage: f = L(1)  # the constant lazy series 1
  sage: for i in range(5):
  ....:     f = (x*f).exponential()
  ....:     f.compute_coefficients(5) # forces the computation
  ....:     print(f)                  # of the first coefficients
  1 + x + 1/2*x^2 + 1/6*x^3 + 1/24*x^4 + 1/120*x^5 + O(x^6)
  1 + x + 3/2*x^2 + 5/3*x^3 + 41/24*x^4 + 49/30*x^5 + O(x^6)
  1 + x + 3/2*x^2 + 8/3*x^3 + 101/24*x^4 + 63/10*x^5 + O(x^6)
  1 + x + 3/2*x^2 + 8/3*x^3 + 125/24*x^4 + 49/5*x^5 + O(x^6)
  1 + x + 3/2*x^2 + 8/3*x^3 + 125/24*x^4 + 54/5*x^5 + O(x^6)
```
Finally:

```
Sage example in ./polynomes.tex, line 2105::

  sage: from sage.combinat.species.series import LazyPowerSeries
  sage: f = LazyPowerSeries(L, name='f')
  sage: f.define((x*f).exponential())

I thought we also supported iterators too, but it is possible that we don’t. I don’t quite have any explicit memory of what we did other than have a discussion about how to handle them. It might have fallen through the cracks.

We can make these changes. The standard thing to do is to cc the book author(s) to let them know.

I guess we don’t have a good mechanism for finding out what is the smallest valuation for a `define()` series should make sense. I remember us talking about this for Laurent series and not knowing there is a unique solution, much less knowing what lower bound might work. The issue for the power series was we had to try and catch an infinite recursion error (which would be very bad practice because it would hide bugs). I don’t think we talked too much about other solutions. When we have one unknown function, we could take its `_approximate_order` to be a variable, e.g., `n` and take the ceiling of the smallest positive real root of `f(n) - n`, where `f` is the function that we get from the `define()` input `_approximate_order`.

Well, if we don’t want to try anything like this beforehand (or it becomes too much work), then we can simply change the test (and I would say it is better for the user to supply anyways). (That is also a very evil test. `:p`)

I think `exponential()` is a good alias to have. I would add a deprecation for `compute_coefficients()` and remove the line in the above doctest.

<a id='comment:36'>**Comment 36:**</a>
Important and somewhat urgent question:

Support for passing generators turns out to be easy, but there is a question of semantics.  If the valuation is specified, should it refer to the first term yielded by the generator, or the first non-zero term yielded by the generator.

Both is easy to achieve.

By way of example: do we want

```
sage: L.<x> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ); L(iter(NN), valuation=-3)
x^-3 + 2*x^-2 + 3*x^-1 + 4 + 5*x + 6*x^2 + O(x^3)
```
or

```
sage: L.<x> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ); L(iter(NN), valuation=-3)
x^-2 + 2*x^-1 + 3 + 4*x + 5*x^2 + 6*x^3 + O(x^4)
```

Compare with our current decisions:

```
sage: L.<x> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ); L(range(5), valuation=-3)
x^-3 + 2*x^-2 + 3*x^-1 + 4
sage: L.<x> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ); L(lambda n: n+3, valuation=-3)
x^-2 + 2*x^-1 + 3 + 4*x + 5*x^2 + 6*x^3 + O(x^4)
```

<a id='comment:37'>**Comment 37:**</a>
The first nonzero term following our statement that passing the `valuation` means the series exactly has that valuation.

We might want to do something as a safety guard of running forever (say 1000 trials) if someone does something crazy like pass

```
def zero():
    while True: yield 0
```
(This might arise more naturally if someone passes something that is not known to be exactly `0` but ends up being `0` and doing some iteration over that.)

<a id='comment:39'>**Comment 39:**</a>
There are a few further minor issues.

I think that for `LazyTaylorSeries`, `LazyDirichletSeries`, `LazySymmetricFunction`, etc. we really don't want

```
sage: L.<x> = LazyTaylorSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: (x^2/(1-x)^3)[:5]
[1, 3, 6]
sage: L(lambda n: n*(n-1)/2)[:5]
[0, 0, 1, 3, 6]
```
Instead, I think that for these classes we always want to start from degree 0.
The current behaviour also breaks some doctests in the species directory.

I am also hesitant to encode a `coefficients` method with behaviour quite different from the other methods with the same name.  In particular, we have

```
    def coefficients(self):
        """
        Return the nonzero coefficients of this polynomial in a list.
        The returned list is decreasingly ordered by the term ordering
        of ``self.parent()``, i.e. the list of coefficients matches the list
        of monomials returned by
        :meth:`sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular.monomials`.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ,3,order='degrevlex')
            sage: f=23*x^6*y^7 + x^3*y+6*x^7*z
            sage: f.coefficients()
            [23, 6, 1]
            sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ,3,order='lex')
            sage: f=23*x^6*y^7 + x^3*y+6*x^7*z
            sage: f.coefficients()
            [6, 23, 1]

        Test the same stuff with base ring `\ZZ` -- different implementation::

            sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,3,order='degrevlex')
            sage: f=23*x^6*y^7 + x^3*y+6*x^7*z
            sage: f.coefficients()
            [23, 6, 1]
            sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,3,order='lex')
            sage: f=23*x^6*y^7 + x^3*y+6*x^7*z
            sage: f.coefficients()
            [6, 23, 1]
```
As far as I can see, there is a single exception to the behaviour indicated by the doctests above, which is the definition in `multi_power_series_ring_elemnt.py`.

I could imagine returning a `lazy_list` and a list, if the support is known to be finite.  Unfortunately, for the code in species, the default behaviour is `sparse=False`, whereas in all other cases, it is `sparse=True`.

Another minor issue: for `L.<x> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)` we had `L([1,2,3])` what would now be `L([1,2], constant = 3)`.  However, I really do not want to replicate this behaviour.

This last push could be moved into a separate ticket if absolutely necessary.

Apart from that, the only thing missing is a decision about the semantics of the `coefficients` function.

I agree with you. It’s not a bug, so we are not justified in simply changing the behavior. Although I feel a general deprecation message every time this is call would be obtrusive (and bad). I am leaning towards just making the backwards incompatible change, documenting how to get the previous behavior `[f[i] for i in range(n)]`, and dealing with the consequences, but it was used all over the examples.

I don’t think it is so important whether the backend is sparse or dense. I think you’re intuition is correct in returning a `lazy_list` unless the series is known to be finite.

Eek, that is highly unexpected. Did we think that should be the behavior at some point? I (now?) think we should have list input be the corresponding finite to match what polynomials do.

Just to be clear: making the definition as

```
def coefficients(self, n=None, sparse=False):
```
i.e., with default behaviour as it is now, but with an option that makes it in line with the other coefficient methods in sage is *not* what we should do?

I must say, if we make the default `sparse=True`, i.e., introduce a backwards incompatible change, then I think we really should provide a deprecation warning.  One might not notice immediately that zeros are missing all of a sudden.

Possibly, to make this decision slightly less important, I could put the definition into the generating functions module only, or, alternatively, only into `LazyPowerSeries`, and raise a `NotImplementedError` for multivariate series.

As far as I remember we discussed this issue and decided that we cannot do anything sensible about it.  I think I'll put a

```
.. WARNING::

    The behaviour of ``LazyPowerSeries(l)`` for a list ``l`` with non-zero last element `e` changed with :trac:`32367`.  To obtain the old behaviour, use ``LazyPowerSeries(l, constant=e)``.
```
into the docstring of the (new) LazyPowerSeries.

No, I agree with you that it is what we should do. The problem is how to do this with an effective and unobtrusive deprecation.

> I must say, if we make the default `sparse=True`, i.e., introduce a backwards incompatible change, then I think we really should provide a deprecation warning.  One might not notice immediately that zeros are missing all of a sudden.

Then we are introducing a new argument that we then have to add to code, which we will also want to deprecate later. This becomes a hassle on both the developer and user side.

Actually, maybe we can just issue a deprecation on the `n` parameter, where we also say this now will return only nonzero coefficients? If people are passing `n`, then they are expecting the old behavior.

Given the other backwards-incompatible change we are making (the one below), it isn’t much more painful to do a second one at the same time either.

Ah, I misread it initially. This was the behavior of the old `LazyPowerSeries`. Just two little things with this:

- Use `L` instead of `l` since it has a chance to be read as `I` depending on the font (like the one I am using to type this comment in fact).
- Make sure there is an easy to see example of the new constant behavior is clearly visible (in the class-level ring doc, its `_element_constructor_`, the element class’s class-level doc; the module-level doc if there are examples there).

OK, I am using `c` now, for 'coefficients', since `L` is used for the parent usually.

I was misremembering what we implemented as I thought it did strip the leading zeros, but this is not the case:

```
sage: L.<x> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: f = L(lambda n: 1, valuation=0)
sage: fp = (f - 1)
sage: fp[:5]
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

This could be made consistent with `f[a:b]` that does return the leading `0`'s because the input is clearly different (and we would not update the approximate valuation because we are not using it).

That is disturbing on many different levels for FPS. For polynomials, it probably would be better for them to be done as lists rather than polynomials, but it was somewhat natural there to return a polynomial as we often want to lop off terms. For FPS, I think slicing makes less sense to return a FPS because we are actually interested in a certain range of coefficients. We aren't really manipulating parts of the polynomial.

Since this is deprecated and could be removed now, we are free to implement our own version of slicing.

With slicing returning leading zeros, I completely agree that we should not do this. My proposal would be to strip the leading zeros and start at the actual valuation (or return an empty list if the valuation is at least as large as `stop`).

> ANd I absolutely want a method (I do not care which name it has) which gives me the list or lazy list of all coefficients, beginning with a specified degree.  This is one of the most important use cases for me, for example, I feed this list to oeis, or to the guessing packages, or I plot it.

Big +1 as well. I am not proposing a change to the slicing `f[start:stop]`, which would still return a list.

Basically, what I would have is a lazy series `f` with:

- approximate valuation `a`
- actual valuation `v`

behave as follows:

1. For `f[:stop]`, then get the list of coefficients from `f[a]` to `f[stop-1]` and strip the leading zeros and update the approximate valuation as appropriate.
2. For `f[start:start]`, return `[f[i] for i in range(start, stop)]`.

As a concrete example, suppose we have `g` with approximate valuation `-3` but actual valuation `2`. Then doing the following (with a freshly created `g`):

1. `g[:5]` returns `[2, 3, 4]` and sets the approximate valuation to `2`.
2. `g[-1:5]` returns `[0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4]`.
3. `g[:1]` returns `[]` and sets the approximate valuation to `1`.

Does that clarify what I am proposing? How do you feel about that? I can implement this if you want too.

Yes, I think that distinguishing between `start=None` and `start=d` in this way is a good idea.

I'd also propose to propagate this change to all polynomial-like `__getitem__` methods (in a later ticket).

I have roughly half an hour left, which I will invest into the coefficient method.  The tricky part is to get multivariate and graded series right, to be consistent with

```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: f = (x+2*y^3 +3*x*y + 5)
sage: f.coefficients()
[2, 3, 1, 5]
```

<a id='comment:72'>**Comment 72:**</a>
The using you should use the approximate order instead of the actual order is that you do not need to compute it exactly. It should be “up to the (necessarily specified) `stop`” so it will still work for series that do not know they are zero (nor compute more than they need to).

I also think the result of `coefficients()` should all lie in the base ring.

I have a number of other small changes that I will do tomorrow, along with the above two if you don’t disagree.

Good catch. The fix seems good, although it seems a bit brittle. I will see if I can come up with a better test, but this can work if I can’t.

Indeed, I think this is ready.

My last commit makes sure the coefficients are in the correct ring, which was not the case before for the test I added.

I did a few other small touch ups that I saw (mainly breaking very long doctest output lines) and marking one test as long.

If my changes are good, then positive review.

Indeed, this will definitely not be in 9.7 since we are in the rc stages. However, that is probably better so it can get lots of testing during the beta releases.

I'm afraid, there is something we did not want:

```
sage: L.<x> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(GF(2))
sage: f=L(lambda n: n)
sage: f._coeff_stream._cache
{}
sage: f
x + x^3 + x^5 + O(x^7)
sage: f._coeff_stream._cache
{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5, 6: 6}
```

I am quite sure we wanted that the cache contains the coefficients in the correct ring, no?

I think I forgot to adapt the `_element_constructor_` of all rings except for the `LazyTaylorSeriesRing` in https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/60103619caa275cb7087e425d25afacdba48af9b

I am guessing that your change to coefficients is masking that.

I have to leave now, I'll try to fix it in the evening.

In all other rings we have in `lazy_series_ring.py` we put the coefficients into the base ring using the element constructor.  This change was done in #34473, where I overlooked the case of power series.  It should also be consistent with the other ways to construct an element, intentionwise.

There are two reasons I think that this is a good idea:

* the conversion into the base ring may be computationally expensive, especially in the case of symmetric functions.

* if a coefficient happens to be zero in the base ring, but not in the given ring, `Stream_map_coefficients` will apply the function in one case, but not the other.  I think that this could lead to rather obscure bugs.

I believe I removed the extra mappings in my last commit, and I also saw your new test, which is fine with me.

This seems to be a reason to not do it until the very end.

A good point, but are we guaranteed to not get the same behavior with other streams? I think so, but it is not clear. I am wondering if we want to actually go back to including the ring for `Stream_map_coefficients` to really make sure we have the correct inputs.

I should have been more precise: if we do the conversion before putting things into the cache, we only do it once, and use it for subsequent computations.  Otherwise, we may do it many times.

Of course, if computations in one base ring turn out to be more efficient than in another one, then it may make sense to do a `change_ring` at the very end.

A bit of a side effect of being packed with awesomeness. The current setup is sufficient for me. I am just wondering while we wait if it can be made better easily.

Easiest way would be to run `git diff` locally between this branch and the dependency.

+1 I have already put this code to good use with a problem I have been working on.

There are still a few things to be improved upon, but this seems to be quite fast and very powerful.

From the patchbot, I caught a few errors. I have mostly fixed them as they are trivial, but there is one that requires discussion.

In particular, changing the base ring to `QQ` leads to not implemented methods because of the change in category. Some of these are noted on #34470.  My proposal is we first add in these methods (possibly on a separate ticket) and the uncontroversial changes from #34470. (I already have a branch that does this. I can handle the merge with the current branch here and my other changes.)

Now we could just sweep this under the rug by skipping the `_test_not_implemented`, but I think it is easier and better to just fix them first.

What do you think?

<a id='comment:6'>**Comment 6:**</a>
I don't quite understand: I see three patchbot runs (one from github and two at https://patchbot.sagemath.org/ticket/32367/), but all three of them say "all tests passed".  Also, the pyflakes doesn't mention any non-expected errors.  Where can I find the report you mention?

Apart from that: of course, please go ahead!

Apart from that: is any of the changes in the branch attached to #34470 controversial?  Here is a diff.  An implementation of `residue_field` is still missing.  More generally, I did not find out how to activate the `_test_not_implemented` gadget.

If you look at the coverage, you see that there are missing doctests. `self:` is not `sage:`, so those tests are not getting run. So I changed them to run the `TestSuite` on the corresponding classes, which lead to failures of the form:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: L._test_not_implemented_methods()
```
which we were not previously testing in our old code.

I will merge it into this ticket and push shortly.

> Apart from that: is any of the changes in the branch attached to #34470 controversial?

As I mentioned on #34470, not currently, but there remains the question of putting things in UFD or not. As well as if we want them to be graded (by default) or not.

> Here is a diff.  An implementation of `residue_field` is still missing.  More generally, I did not find out how to activate the `_test_not_implemented` gadget.

Thank you for the diff.

The biggest change I made is that `uniformizer` and `residue_field` are always included as public methods on the ring. I want to avoid the monkey patching (which should generally be avoided), which not only hides documentation, there is a a technical difference as well:

```

While I doubt this is important in practice, it is generally considered bad practice to monkey patch. If you really don't want these methods there, I can implement the appropriate subclasses with the appropriate dispatching using the standard `__classcall_private__` mechanism (like, e.g., `Partitions`).

            sage: P.<x> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
            sage: f = P.undefined()
            sage: f.define(1 - ~f*x)
            sage: f
            1 - x - x^2 - 2*x^3 - 5*x^4 - 14*x^5 - 42*x^6 + O(x^7)

            sage: D = LazyDirichletSeriesRing(QQ, "s")
            sage: g = D([0, 1])
            sage: f = D.undefined()
            sage: f.define(1 + ~f*g)
            sage: f
            1 + 1/(2^s) - 1/(4^s) + O(1/(8^s))
```
did not work previously.

Also, equality testing should be clearer now.  I don't know why we decided to check terms in the range

```
n = min(self._coeff_stream._approximate_order, other._coeff_stream._approximate_order)
m = max(self._coeff_stream._approximate_order, other._coeff_stream._approximate_order)
```
previously - it seems to me that this computes coefficients for no good reason.  (it won't hurt, but it won't help either).

Other than that, the diff is not really large.

I believe that giving a name to the true order, if it is known, might be helpful for further improvements, but I did not check.

I also did not check whether we should update `_approximate_order` in `Stream_inexact.__getitem__`.  I would like to first implement more `_test_XXX` methods (in particular for composition and reversion), to get a better picture of performance.

<a id='comment:5'>**Comment 5:**</a>
The `Returns` in the doctring noticed by the patchbot is fixed in the follow-up ticket #34470.

The pyflakes warnings about imported but unused modules in `species/library.py`, are, as far as I know, unavoidable.

The ellipsis in the doctest in `sfa.py` is misinterpreted by the patchbot as a doctest continuation, but is correct, as far as I know.

I am therefore setting this to positive review.
