Indeed, I have done that. I also added an alias `qdet`.

Yypos: `a symmetric` and `written`, so

```diff
-        where `S_n` is symmetric group on `\{1, \ldots, n\}` and
-        `\ell(\sigma)` denotes the length of `\sigma` witten as simple
-        transpositions (equivalently the number of inversions when
-        written in one-line notation).

<a id='comment:12'></a>To respect the usual (row, column) matrix indexing convention,
I would change:

or shorten those to:

```diff
+            sage: A = matrix(SR, 2, lambda i, j: f'a{i}{j}'); A
+            [a00 a01]

```

```diff
+            sage: A = matrix(SR, 3, lambda i, j: f'a{i}{j}')
```
This has had positive review for a while though,
so maybe in a follow-up ticket?
