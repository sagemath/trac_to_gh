<div id="comment:12" align="right">Comment 12</div>

To respect the usual (row, column) matrix indexing convention,
I would change:

```diff
-            sage: A = matrix([[SR(f'a{i}{j}') for i in range(2)]
-            ....:             for j in range(2)]); A
-            [a00 a10]
-            [a01 a11]
+            sage: A = matrix([[SR(f'a{i}{j}') for j in range(2)]
+            ....:             for i in range(2)]); A
+            [a00 a01]
+            [a10 a11]
```

```diff
-            sage: A = matrix([[SR(f'a{i}{j}') for i in range(3)]
-            ....:             for j in range(3)])
+            sage: A = matrix([[SR(f'a{i}{j}') for j in range(3)]
+            ....:             for i in range(3)])
```
or shorten those to:

```diff
+            sage: A = matrix(SR, 2, lambda i, j: f'a{i}{j}'); A
+            [a00 a01]
+            [a10 a11]
```

```diff
+            sage: A = matrix(SR, 3, lambda i, j: f'a{i}{j}')
```
This has had positive review for a while though,
so maybe in a follow-up ticket?
