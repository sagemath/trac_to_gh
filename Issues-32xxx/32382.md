The code for the `is_finite` method of `ClusterQuiver`
was trying to sort several cluster quivers,
which is no longer implemented in Python 3.

In Sage 9.4.rc2:

```
sage: Q = ClusterQuiver([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 1]])
sage: Q.is_finite()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances
of 'QuiverMutationType_Irreducible'
and 'QuiverMutationType_Irreducible'
```

Expected:

```
True
```

Fixed in this ticket by sorting
according to string representation.

This may appear elsewhere, but let us just fix this
for the moment.
