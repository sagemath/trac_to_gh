That's just a python thing: hashable objects must be comparable for equality, and items that compare equal should have identical hashes. Without that, dictionary lookup and sets don't work properly (and hashable objects must play nice with sets and dictionaries -- that's what hashing is for). Because hash and equality need to be coordinated, it's normally not even possible in python to inherit one but not the other.

(sage actually violates the python hash contract, because `1 == GF(5)(1) == 6`. This causes trouble, but it is required to have `==` work properly with coercion, which was felt important for a CAS)

That makes sense thanks. `ClassFunction_gap` already has `@richcmp_method` so when I try to implement `__eq__`, I get the error 

```div
  {{{
TypeError: class <class 'sage.groups.class_function.ClassFunction_gap'> defines __eq__ which cannot be 
combined with @richcmp_method
  }}}
```

Does that mean that I don't need to implement an `__eq__` and it suffices to implement just a hash?

Yes, that's correct. The `_richcmp_` covers all comparison operators, in particular `==`.

I would propose a slightly different hash function:

```python
def __hash__(self):
    return hash((self._group, self.values())
```
These are the two things that are checked for equality, but you get distinct hashes for all of the class functions. Right now, all class functions have the same repr, so they all have the same hash (which is less than ideal).

It might also be good to put the `__hash__` method below the `__richcmp__` as typically the `__init__` is the first method.
