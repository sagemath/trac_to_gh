(sage actually violates the python hash contract, because `1 == GF(5)(1) == 6`. This causes trouble, but it is required to have `==` work properly with coercion, which was felt important for a CAS)

Yes, that's correct. The `_richcmp_` covers all comparison operators, in particular `==`.

I would propose a slightly different hash function:

```python
def __hash__(self):
    return hash((self._group, self.values())
```
These are the two things that are checked for equality, but you get distinct hashes for all of the class functions. Right now, all class functions have the same repr, so they all have the same hash (which is less than ideal).

It might also be good to put the `__hash__` method below the `__richcmp__` as typically the `__init__` is the first method.
