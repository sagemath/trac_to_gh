We revise the GH Actions workflows to use a 2-stage build:
In the first stage, run `make build-local`, and store `SAGE_LOCAL` as a build artifact. In the second stage, download the build artifact and run more building and testing.

(+) On top of the artifact containing the full SAGE_LOCAL, we can test several ways to build the Python parts
- Sage distribution, classic
- Sage distribution with `configure --enable-editable`
- Sage distribution with `configure --enable-system-site-packages` (#29665)
- the configurations from pkgs/**sagemath-standard**/tox.ini
- build/install of modularized distributions such as pkgs/**sage-categories** (#29865), pkgs/**sagemath-standard-no-symbolics** (#32601)

(+) Tests of optional and experimental packages can be streamlined, as we avoid rebuilding their dependencies that are standard packages.

(+) Splitting the job into two would also help with the configurations for which we scrape at the 6 hour time limit

(-) Unfortunately, because [because "needs" cannot depend on "matrix"](https://github.community/t/needs-based-on-matrix/132400), the jobs for building/testing Python packages would not start before all jobs building `SAGE_LOCAL` for all platforms are completed

In this ticket, we only change all existing `macos` workflows to a 2-stage workflow, integrating the separate workflows for optional and experimental packages.

As of this ticket, we rely on the bottleneck of the available parallel jobs on GH Actions to ensure that the 2nd stages of a configuration are run after the 1st stage of that configuration. Experience with this workflow will show whether this suffices.

We also update the macOS/Xcode versions according to what's available on GH Actions and switch the `homebrew` builds to faster `homebrew-usrlocal` variants, which can use bottles for all available packages.

Okay, but isn't this a very fragile design? Imagine that you have exactly 5 matrix cases. So all of the stage 1 tasks start at the same time.

Then I would suggest using two jobs that wait using "needs" and accept the disadvantages that go with it. 

> Unfortunately, because ​because "needs" cannot depend on "matrix", the jobs for building/testing Python packages would not start before all jobs building SAGE_LOCAL for all platforms are completed 


I think this is also a more flexible design as the stage two matrix will probably have more options in the future (e.g. editable install, with/without prebuild wheels from pypi, pipenv).
In fact, for maximal flexibility do you think it makes sense too split it further into 3 stages:
- Built all non-python packages (min/standard/max)
- Built all python packages (standard, editable, prebuild wheels, pipenv)
- Run doctests

Whether the doctest needs a separate stage remains to be seen; I think having it as part of the stage 2 builds will easily fit into the 6 hour limit in all variants.

That is, why do you prefer the "custom stage build" over having a "local-macos-stage2" job that depends via "needs" on "local-macos-stage1", where each of these jobs defines an appropriate matrix. In particular, I don't understand the "all platforms" part, as ubuntu and macos are in different jobs, right? It appears to me that with the current design also stage 1 builds are executed before any stage 2 is executed, so the only difference is that you can already have 4 or so stage 2 builds running while the last stage 1 build finishes.

Github recently made it possible to reuse workflows: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/reusing-workflows
