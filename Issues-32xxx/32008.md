1. Currently, `CallableSymbolicExpressionRing` allows meaningless operations such as the following.

```
sage: f(t) = t
sage: f
t |--> t
sage: f * t
t |--> t^2
```
   This should be changed so it gives:

```
_dummy |--> _dummy * t
```
   `f` currently is an element of a `CallableSymbolicExpressionRing`,  a ring over the base `SR` (the only allowed base for this class).

2. The design of `CallableSymbolicExpressionRing` has another critical flaw pointed out in #28434 (Syntax for callable symbolic expressions causes too much confusion) as "7. Addition confusion":

```
sage: f(x) = x^2
sage: g(x) = x^2
sage: var('t')
sage: h(t) = t^2
sage: f+g
x |--> 2*x^2
sage: f+h
(t, x) |--> t^2 + x^2
```

In this ticket:
- We remove the distinction between the `CallableSymbolicExpressionRing` instances based on the names of the argument variable names. Instead, they will be unique by number of arguments, and the set of non-argument symbols that appear in the definition.
- The element constructor substitutes the arguments in the expression by dummy variables, i.e., unique internal symbols that are only used for this purpose. The argument names are substituted back only in `_repr_` and when converted into `SR` by `SymbolicRing._element_constructor_`
- We extend the class to support base rings that are subrings of `SR`.  Then we change the default base ring of a callable expression to be the subring of `SR` that rejects all dummy variables.
