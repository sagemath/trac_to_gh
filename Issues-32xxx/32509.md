`sage.rings.polynomial` (and all of `sage.rings`) has lots of Cython modules that depend on various C/C++ libraries and will have to go into different distribution packages (#29705, #32501).

Thus we need to clear out `__init__.py`, which currently contains a workaround added in #25848 ("Some preparations for binding=True") in preparation for #22747/#26254. As this effort has stalled, we remove this workaround; a new solution can be found when #26254 gains traction again.
