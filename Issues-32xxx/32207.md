in #30835 problems with using clang(++) from Homebrew on macOS were found

* Pillow build broken
* PATH needs to be adjusted (?) 

After Pillow update to 9.0.1 the only problem is caused by an obsolete workaround
for Darwin/XCode in Pillow's spkg-install. The branch here removes it.

I guess it's coming from `pip` ?

```
src/pip/_internal/req/req_install.py: logger.warning("Skipping %s as it is not installed.", self.name)
```

namely, before installing a newly built wheel, `pip` is called to uninstall the package.
But if it wasn't installed one gets this warning. Harmless.
