in #30835 problems with using clang(++) from Homebrew on macOS were found

* Pillow build broken
* PATH needs to be adjusted (?) 

After Pillow update to 9.0.1 the only problem is caused by an obsolete workaround
for Darwin/XCode in Pillow's spkg-install. The branch here removes it.

Depends on #33116
