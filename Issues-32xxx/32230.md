I think R is the only package that needs pcre,

```
$ find ./ -name dependencies | xargs grep -l pcre
./pkgs/r/dependencies
```

So it can probably be disabled with `--disable-r`, too.

Are we ever going to make R an optional package? If so, the same makes sense for pcre.

Yes, I agree. R is probably safe because nobody has been updating this spkg in a long time anyway.
But `--disable-notebook` is probably already in need of updating -- the dependencies of Jupyter change rapidly.
