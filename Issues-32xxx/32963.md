(from #32779)

`RDF` contains infinities and `NaN`s, which can appear as results of arithmetic operations.

```
sage: RDF(1.0)/RDF(0.0)
+infinity
sage: RDF(0.0)/RDF(0.0)
NaN
```
This is consistent with `RR`:

```
sage: RR(1.0)/RR(0.0)
+infinity
sage: RR(0.0)/RR(0.0)
NaN
```
(but is in contrast to `float`, which gives `ZeroDivisionError`).

However, `RealDoubleElement_gsl.__pow__` raises exceptions:

```
sage: RDF('0.0').__pow__(RDF('-1'))
ZeroDivisionError: 0.0 cannot be raised to a negative power
sage: RDF('-0.0').__pow__(RDF('-1'))
ZeroDivisionError: 0.0 cannot be raised to a negative power
sage: RDF('-1').__pow__(RDF('0.5'))
ValueError: negative number cannot be raised to a fractional power
```
... in contrast to the other arithmetic operations and in contrast to `RR`:

```
sage: RR('0.0').__pow__(RR('-1'))
+infinity
age: RR('-0.0').__pow__(RR('-1'))
-infinity
sage: RR('-1').__pow__(RR('0.5'))
6.12323399573677e-17 + 1.00000000000000*I
```

Moreover, many `RDF` element methods do not handle -0.0 correctly.
