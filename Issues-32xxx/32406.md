<a id='comment:2'></a>Thanks for the discussion. I'm actually pretty sure that using `pip install -e` is widely used by Python developers though; but that is probably also connected to the widespread use of virtual environments for specific tasks. 

It is true that if one just has one "global" environment (and the monolithic nature of the Sage install with hours of compile time tend to lead to that), the isolation of that environment from the source tree is indeed useful.

So perhaps we need to wait until venv use becomes more popular in Sage developer circles. #32442 is intended to increase venv awareness.

<a id='comment:18'></a>Would it be possible to handle Cython files the same way Python files are handled?

Some timings on my creaky old laptop:

- with this branch, if I change `quaternion_algebra_cython.pyx` and run `make build`: it takes about 70 seconds.
- with this branch, if I change nothing and run `make build`, it takes about 60 seconds.
- with the `develop` branch, if I change `quaternion_algebra_cython.pyx`, `make build` takes about 35 seconds.
- with the `develop` branch, if I change nothing, `make build` takes about 30 seconds.

So this change does have a cost. Presumably it's not as large a difference on a faster computer.

I feel like, in a perfect world, Sage upon startup would automatically detect if it had to recompile because of a change to a Cython file, and conversely, 'sage -b' would be a no-op if no files had been changed. But if that's possible, it's for another ticket.
