This new class is just a variation of the existing class `atomic_write` taking care of directory specific differences.
For a first application case see #32099.

This code is just adapted from the corresponding part of `atomic_write`. It worked fine for me in all of my tests (using Python 3.9). But indeed, the second patchbot (using Python 3.7) shows (ignored) `FileNotFoundError` in cleanup:

I think a first step should be to clarify the semantics in the documentation of this class: This is for creating a directory whose contents are determined uniquely by the directory name. If multiple threads or processes attempt to create it in parallel, then it does not matter which thread created it.

If this is the intended semantics, then the following should be correct:

```
            # Success: move temporary file to target file
            try:
                os.rename(self.tempname, self.target)
            except FileExistsError:
                # Race: Another thread or process must have created the directory
                pass
```
