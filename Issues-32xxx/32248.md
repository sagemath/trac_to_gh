```
-        flow = p.get_values(flow)
+        if integer:
+            flow = p.get_values(flow, convert=True, tolerance=integrality_tolerance)

```
I think it would be better to use `convert=True` for the case `integer=False` so that `float` values are converted to `RDF`.

Also it could be added in the docstring of `flow` that integrality is automatic with all our solvers (because they use simplex) if all capacities are integers.

Indeed... this looks like a strange workaround altogether.

For now, I would say:

```
         # add significant edges
         for (u,v),l in flow.items():
-            if l > 0 and not (integer and l < .5):
+            if l:
                 g.add_edge(u, v, l)
```
(because integrality has already been taken care of)

And this part:

```
        # if integer is set, round values and deletes zeroes
        if integer:
            for u,v,l in g.edges(sort=False):
                if l < .5:
                    g.delete_edge(u, v)
                else:
                    g.set_edge_label(u, v, int(round(l)))
```
can just be removed because also the cycle canceling in the loop before it keeps integral flows integral.
