As noted in #29093, in py3, `os.makedirs` learned an `exist_ok` option that makes `sage_makedirs` entirely redundant.

https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.makedirs

Since then we have dropped py2 support, so we can deprecate `sage_makedirs` and replace all uses in the library.

I see two doctest failures with `src/sage/tests/cmdline.py`, but these seem related with `pytest` issues, not with the current branch.
