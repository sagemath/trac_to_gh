To a pair of elements x,y in a Coxeter group W one can associate two polyhedral cones. The 'upper bruhat cone' generated by all roots beta such that s_beta * x covers x and s_beta * x <= y and similarly the 'lower bruhat cone' generated by all beta sucht that y covers s_beta * y and x <= s_beta * y .

These cones were used in https://eudml.org/doc/174610 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03715

    "body": "<a id='comment:14'></a>Thank you for your contribuation. I have a rather long list of comments. Most of them are minor issues I think.\n\nA green bot unfortunatly only means that you added the optional tags correctly, as the bots don't have gap3 installed.\n\n- You should probably add your references from the ticket description.\n  As pointed in https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#python-code-style\nat `REFERENCES` and `ALGORITHM`.\n\n-\n\n```\n            wi = self.apply_simple_reflection(i, side = 'right')\n            return [(u.apply_simple_reflection(i, side='right'),r.apply_conjugation_by_simple_reflection(i)) for u,r in wi.bruhat_lower_covers_reflections() if not u.has_descent(i, side='right')] + [(wi, self.parent().simple_reflection(i))]\n```\n  Those lines need some work. `side='right` is a keyword and should therefore not contain spaces.\n  The second line is way to long and should be wrapped according to PEP8.\n  We are not ultra stright with 79 characters, but it is still good to keep it at that.\n  Also it is impossible to understand what this line does like this. So I would propose:\n\n```\n            wi = self.apply_simple_reflection(i, side='right')\n            return [(u.apply_simple_reflection(i, side='right'),\n                     r.apply_conjugation_by_simple_reflection(i))\n                    for u, r in wi.bruhat_lower_covers_reflections()\n                    if not u.has_descent(i, side='right')] + [\n                (wi, self.parent().simple_reflection(i))]\n```\n  Yes, I know that you did not introduce this ultra-long line, but it is still good to fix it, when touching.\n- From the ticket I gather that your changes in `coxeter_group.py` are motivated by a bug. Can you please add a test to `CoxeterGroups` that illustrates what has been fixed now. Something:\n\n```\nTESTS:\n\nCheck bug discovered in :trac:`32669` is fixed:\n\n    sage: 2 + 2\n    4\n```\n- The description on `bruhat_cone` is hard to read. The first line should just be a brief sentence describing what the function does. No need to contain all definitions.\n- This should be reworked:\n\n```diff\n+        For ``side`` = ``'upper'``: ``s_beta`` ``x`` covers ``x`` and ``x`` <= ``s_beta`` ``x`` <= ``y``.\n+\n+        For ``side`` = ``'lower'``: ``y`` covers ``s_beta`` ``y`` and ``x`` <= ``s_beta`` ``y`` <= ``y``.\n```\n  I don't know what it means. What are those things called: `Upper Bruhat cone` and `Lower Bruhat cone`? If you just call them by names, that already makes the start easier to read. You know you can also use latex in the docstring.

<a id='comment:14'></a>Thank you for your contribuation. I have a rather long list of comments. Most of them are minor issues I think.

A green bot unfortunatly only means that you added the optional tags correctly, as the bots don't have gap3 installed.

- You should probably add your references from the ticket description.
  As pointed in https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#python-code-style
at `REFERENCES` and `ALGORITHM`.

```
            wi = self.apply_simple_reflection(i, side = 'right')
            return [(u.apply_simple_reflection(i, side='right'),r.apply_conjugation_by_simple_reflection(i)) for u,r in wi.bruhat_lower_covers_reflections() if not u.has_descent(i, side='right')] + [(wi, self.parent().simple_reflection(i))]
```
  Those lines need some work. `side='right` is a keyword and should therefore not contain spaces.
  The second line is way to long and should be wrapped according to PEP8.
  We are not ultra stright with 79 characters, but it is still good to keep it at that.
  Also it is impossible to understand what this line does like this. So I would propose:

```

```
  Yes, I know that you did not introduce this ultra-long line, but it is still good to fix it, when touching.
- From the ticket I gather that your changes in `coxeter_group.py` are motivated by a bug. Can you please add a test to `CoxeterGroups` that illustrates what has been fixed now. Something:

```
TESTS:

Check bug discovered in :trac:`32669` is fixed:

    sage: 2 + 2
    4
```
- The description on `bruhat_cone` is hard to read. The first line should just be a brief sentence describing what the function does. No need to contain all definitions.
- This should be reworked:

```diff
+        For ``side`` = ``'upper'``: ``s_beta`` ``x`` covers ``x`` and ``x`` <= ``s_beta`` ``x`` <= ``y``.
+
+        For ``side`` = ``'lower'``: ``y`` covers ``s_beta`` ``y`` and ``x`` <= ``s_beta`` ``y`` <= ``y``.
```
  I don't know what it means. What are those things called: `Upper Bruhat cone` and `Lower Bruhat cone`? If you just call them by names, that already makes the start easier to read. You know you can also use latex in the docstring. Maybe this makes it easier to read:
https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#section-latex-typeset
- The input `x` and `y` needs to be explained.
- Your doctests do not pass:

```

There are also other failing doctests discovered, because people apparently do not test `gap3` at all:

  However, you did not cause this I think. If we don't fix them here (which definitely needs not to happen), which should open a ticket for them.

- It would be good to have doctests that illustrate some actual properties. E.g. you could illustrate the definition.
- In your actual code there are also some very long lines. They could also be wrapped. E.g.:

```diff

- After the `ValueError` there could be an empty line. Likewise an empty line would make sense after `from sage.rings.qqbar import AA as base_ring`, because this is when the `if ... else` is over.

Thank you very much for your detailed feedback.

I added the references.

> * Those lines need some work.
> * The second line is way to long and should be wrapped according to PEP8.
> * Also it is impossible to understand what this line does like this.


I changed the lines according to your suggestions.

> * From the ticket I gather that your changes in `coxeter_groups.py` are motivated by a bug. Can you please add a test to `CoxeterGroups` that illustrates what has been fixed now.


I added a test. The bug did only occur for the permutation implementation, so the test is only for this implementation.

> * The description on `bruhat_cone` is hard to read.


There now is a new description using latex but I'm not sure if this description would be better in an `ALGORITHM` section.

> * Your doctests do not pass:


They should pass now.

> * There are also other failing doctests discovered, because people apparently do not test `gap3` at all.


I would prefer opening a new ticket for this. 

> * In your actual code there are also some very long lines.


I wrapped them and added the suggested empty lines.

I changed/added the parts according to your comment.
The local doctests for `reflection_group_real.py` including `gap3` passed.

I'm confused about that. The implementation of ReflectionGroup in reflection_group_real.py heavily depends on gap3 and cannot be used without it. Why should there be doctests without gap3? Is this even possible?

Gap3 itself is no longer maintained, and it's rather miraculous that it still works and that one can use it for reflection groups in sage. Using comment:37, your code should work on Weyl groups and be doctested for them.

I would agree but I think we had this discussion already. I can' find it anymore though.

The only parent/super category in common is coxeter groups and there is no implementation of roots or the cartan matrix in there. Furthermore the implementation of roots in Weyl groups is very different from the one in reflection groups.
In Weyl groups their embedding depends on the degree of the group (A4 having 5, E6 and E8 having 8), while in reflection groups it depends on the rank.

I currently have no idea how to combine these worlds.

I don’t understand the point you are making about the implementation of the roots. The data is well-defined and the root systems are isomorphic. I agree with `@`chapoton that we should have one common code that is agnostic to the choice of implementation. If things are not melding together properly, then we need to look at the code and unify it somehow.

Then there is an issue with the permutation implementation about either its internal consistency or with the generic implementation that needs to be fixed. This would sweep the issue under the rug.

The implementation for Weyl groups is done in

```
src/sage/categories/weyl_groups.py
```
at the category level, yes. 
The implementation for this ticket is done in

```
src/sage/combinat/root_system/reflection_group_real.py
```
what is, if I understand correctly, not at the catagory level.

Furthermore, I think, the only super category in common is CoxeterGroups. 
And for reflection groups this seems to be the case only sometimes?
What I mean is that, depending on the input data, sometimes a reflection group is initialized as Coxeter group, but not always.

So my question/problem is: Where should an implementation of 'Bruhat cones' be done such that both, Weyl groups and reflection groups, can use it? 
Wherever that is should be an existing implementation of roots that is compatible with the implementations used for Weyl groups and reflection groups.

I did not dive fully into this function. It wasn't working and all the other, similar functions used the side='right' flag. So I tried that and then it worked...
