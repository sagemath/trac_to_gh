The source of the problem seems to be the implementation of `FilteredVectorSpace_class.random_deformation` [(source)](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/97d550d15c2bce750f404034d71b517ab34b5d77/src/sage/modules/filtered_vector_space.py#L1271-L1275). This is the relevant code:

```python
        filtration = dict()
        for deg, filt in self._filt[1:]:
            generators = [v + epsilon * random_vector(R, self.rank())
                          for v in filt.echelonized_basis()]
            filtration[deg] = generators
```

Occasionally, this random deformation results in `generators` that are linearly dependent, so that the new filtered component is of lower dimension than the original. It seems to me that this is not intended, as this will only happen in rare cases. Should we add a check here to avoid this?

Here is an attempt at a partial fix which I think respects the original intent, while preserving the subspace inclusions and dimensions of the filtered vector spaces.

This fixes the issue in the description, but the test from [comment:1](#comment%3A1) still sometimes fails:

and I have to admit that I don't know what very many of those words mean. If it's only the Klyachko class that needs the dimensions of the components to remain invariant, it might be better to change

```
while not filt.is_exhaustive():
    filt = self._filt.random_deformation(epsilon)
```

to preserve those dimensions as well.
