This is a pretty large module, consisting of 11 kLOC.

We could split it into several modules, each defining an intermediate class (like it is done in `sage.matrix.matrix0, matrix1, matrix2`).

For example,
- a module `sage.geometry.polyhedron.base0` contains the very basic methods (initialization etc) #32767.
- a module `sage.geometry.polyhedron.base1` could contain the implementation of the methods defined by the `ConvexSet_base` API,  #32776
- a module `sage.geometry.polyhedron.base2` could contain all methods that have to do with lattice points in polyhedra, #32876
- a module `sage.geometry.polyhedron.base3` contains the combinatorial methods, #32884
- a module `sage.geometry.polyhedron.base4` could contain all methods whose implementation needs `sage.graphs.graphs`, #32889 -- this would help with modularization because then we could conditionalize the doctests via a file-level directive (#30778)
  - `vertex_graph`, `graph`, `vertex_digraph`, `vertex_facet_graph`
  - `hasse_diagram`
  - `face_lattice`, `flag_f_vector`
  - `{combinatorial,restricted}_automorphism_group`
  - `is_combinatorially_isomorphic`
-  a module `sage.geometry.polyhedron.base5` could contain all constructions of new polyhedra, #33123
- a module `sage.geometry.polyhedron.base6` could contain all methods related to plotting and affine hull (projection), #33449
- a module `sage.geometry.polyhedron.base7` could contain all methods related to triangulation and volume, #33583

This could also lead to an improvement of the documentation.

<a id='comment:14'></a>That's a great ticket! ... I'm not dead. I expect to be "back on trac" soon!

I would be up for improving the doc and complement it further... I'll slowly go through all this new stuff in polyhedron this Summer.

Thanks for all the work!
