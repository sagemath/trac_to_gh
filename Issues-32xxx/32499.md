You may be right that, since i installed a lot of Sage dependencies, Python 3 might be the one of the distro, hence it is normal that it links with `libssl1.1`. Let me test with a bare VM.

I setup a bare VM with the minimal dependencies, in particular no Python 3. I can reproduce the previous error with `urllib` and OpenSSL 3.0.0.


Replying to [comment:4 mkoeppe]: 
> Is this different from the behavior without this ticket?


No, the error appears both with OpenSSL 3.0.0-beta2 and 3.0.0, which means that the introduction of OpenSSL 3.x in Sage was not tested enough.

Hence, since self-tests pass, since 3.0.0 is the first stable release of OpenSSL 3, and since there is no regression compared to the current OpenSSL 3.0.0-beta2, i suggest that we merge this ticket.
