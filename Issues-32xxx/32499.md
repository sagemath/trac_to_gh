Here are some additional bits: i setup a VM for this ticket, without `openssl` nor `openssl-dev` from the distro (Debian), and with `openssl 3.0.0` spkg installed . However, when i do 

```
sage: import ssl
sage: ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION

i got

```
'OpenSSL 1.1.1k  25 Mar 2021'

which means that the Python shipped with Sage sometimes links to the `libssl1.1` that is shipped with the distro. This package is needed for important things like `passwd`, `ssh`, `apt`, etc. If i destroy the distro by removing `libssl1.1`, `./configure` aborts with

Hence, i can not really test `openssl3.0.0` because i will never be sure whether some part of Sage fully uses `openssl 3.0.0`. To really fix the issue i should be able to acces some machine that really needs the `openssl 3.0.0` spkg, namely those for which no openssl is available. I am not sure which OS are concerned, and which Sage dev have such machine available.

You may be right that, since i installed a lot of Sage dependencies, Python 3 might be the one of the distro, hence it is normal that it links with `libssl1.1`. Let me test with a bare VM.

I setup a bare VM with the minimal dependencies, in particular no Python 3. I can reproduce the previous error with `urllib` and OpenSSL 3.0.0.


Replying to [mkoeppe](#comment%3A4): 
> Is this different from the behavior without this ticket?


No, the error appears both with OpenSSL 3.0.0-beta2 and 3.0.0, which means that the introduction of OpenSSL 3.x in Sage was not tested enough.

Hence, since self-tests pass, since 3.0.0 is the first stable release of OpenSSL 3, and since there is no regression compared to the current OpenSSL 3.0.0-beta2, i suggest that we merge this ticket.
