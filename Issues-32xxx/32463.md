This ticket aims to fix the inconsistencies in the capitalization of section titles of the documentation. See for example the sections under "Algebraic Number Fields":

Following python guidelines, the section titles should all be in sentence case (this means that the first word is always capitalized and other words are only capitalized if there is a specific rule requiring it)

Keywords: **capitalization title doc**
