This ticket aims to fix the inconsistencies in the capitalization of section titles of the documentation. See for example the sections under "Algebraic Number Fields":

https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/number_fields/index.html

Following python guidelines, the section titles should all be in sentence case (this means that the first word is always capitalized and other words are only capitalized if there is a specific rule requiring it)

Keywords: **capitalization title doc**

Component: **documentation**
