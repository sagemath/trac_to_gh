Our Singular interface currently contains a hand-written parser for Singular's "info" file. In this ticket, we add an optional GNU Info package to parse this file instead.

Relative to running "info", the hand-written parser has several drawbacks:

* The extra code is a maintenance burden. We should not be wasting
  our time (poorly) reimplementing standard tools.

* The custom parser is buggy. For example, it is supposed to raise a
  `KeyError` when documentation for a non-existent function is
  requested. However, the parser does not keep track of what section
  it's in, so, for example, `get_docstring("Preface")` will happily
  return the contents of the preface even though "Preface" is not a
  Singular function.

* The first time documentation is requested, the entire info file
  (see above) is loaded into a dictionary. With the Singular info
  file currently weighing in at around 11MiB, this is wasting a
  good chunk of memory.

* The `singular_console()` itself tries to launch GNU Info to display
  its interactive help, and cannot use our hand-written parser.

The one downside to requiring "info" is that it would add a new runtime dependency to sagelib. To avoid that, we make GNU Info optional, and suggest to the user that he install it when he tries to read Singular's documentation.

GNU Info (or its superset, Texinfo) are widespread, portable, and easy to install on all of the systems we support, so in most cases this should be a "free" improvement.

The interface gets a lot smaller and simpler.

Singular does know where it lives, but how do you propose we get it? Ask them to add a special command-line option to support our outlandish use case?

There is no problem with making `info` a standard package.

But there is a problem in adding an additional non-Python runtime dependency to the Sage library. `info` cannot be installed by `pip`.

And that will get worse as the Singular manual grows.

While it's possible to put the info files *anywhere*, we can stick a colon on the end of `$INFOPATH` to have the SPKG try the default list as fallbacks: https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/texinfo.git/tree/info/filesys.h#n70

If we manage to find a system that both doesn't have GNU Info and yet still goes out of its way to install info files in a crazy location... then I guess at that point we could use DEPCHECK to ensure that the Singular SPKG gets built on that system.

This is only a solution if you insist on keeping our lame python implementation and all of the problems it comes with. It'll get the job done, but I won't be the one to do it.

<a id='comment:28'></a>It's now completely optional. When "info" is not installed, you'll be prodded to install it:

```
sage: singular.align?                                                           
Signature:   singular.align(*args, **kwds)
Type:        SingularFunction
String form: align
File:        ~/src/sage.git/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/interfaces/singular.py
Docstring:  
This function is an automatically generated pexpect wrapper around the
Singular function 'align'.

EXAMPLES:

   sage: groebner = singular.groebner
   sage: P.<x, y> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
   sage: I = P.ideal(x^2-y, y+x)
   sage: groebner(singular(I))
   x+y,
   y^2-y

The relevant Singular documentation will be shown here if you install
GNU Texinfo, the stand-alone GNU Info program, or the SageMath "info"
SPKG.
