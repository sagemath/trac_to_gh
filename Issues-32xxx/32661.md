mypy does not understand our (very common) usage of `__classcall_private__` but instead looks at `__init__` to decide which parameters can be given to the class, usually `Element` classes.

I have no idea if a global solution is possible. Lacking that, the second best solution is to ignore the issue in the affected class calls.
