(from #31901#comment:22)

This will remove the appearance of mutability of `Chart`s.

Deprecated chart declaration:

```
            sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='topological')

            sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
            sage: X.add_restrictions(x^2+y^2<1)
            sage: X.add_restrictions(x>0)
```

**Replacement 1 (implemented):**

```
    sage: var("x y")
    sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart(coord_restrictions=[x^2+y^2<1, x>0])
```

Replacement 2:

```
    sage: x, y = M.var()
    sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart(coord_restrictions=[x^2+y^2<1, x>0])
```
(`x`, `y` defined in the first line would be some temporary placeholder variables.)

**Replacement 3 (implemented):**

```
    sage: in_disk(x,y) = x^2+y^2<1
    sage: on_right(x,y) = x>0
    sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart(coord_restrictions=[in_disk, on_right])
```

Replacement 4:

```
   sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart(coord_restrictions=[lambda x,y: x^2+y^2<1, lambda x,y: x>0])
```
(chart initialization calls the lambdas on the symbolic variables x, y to get the symbolic relations)

**Replacement 5 (implemented):**

```
   sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart(coord_restrictions=lambda x,y: [x^2+y^2<1, x>0])
```
(chart initialization calls the lambda on the symbolic variables x, y to get the list of symbolic relations)

<a id='comment:26'></a>Looks good. Here are some remarks:

1. The argument `calc_method` of `Chart.__init__` has no longer a default value. Is there any reason for this? This is not consistent with `RealChart.__init__`, which has `calc_method=None`. 

2. In the INPUT section of the docstring of class `Chart`:
- the argument `coordinates` is described as having a default value, which is no longer true
- in the description of the argument `coord_restrictions`, all instances of `restrictions` should be replaced by `coord_restrictions`
- the argument `names` should removed
Moreover, the arguments should be ordered in the same way as they appear in `Chart.__init__`. 

3. In the INPUT section of the docstring of class `RealChart`:
- the argument `coordinates` is described as having a default value, which is no longer true
- the argument `coord_restrictions` is missing
- the argument `names` should be removed

4.

Actually, `coordinates` and `names` still have the same behavior as before -- it is implemented by `__classcall__`

Yes I understand this; the question is rather about the consistency of the INPUT field with the class declaration as it appears in the reference manual:

```
class sage.manifolds.chart.Chart(domain, coordinates, calc_method, periods=None,
coord_restrictions=None)
```
This is because Sphinx constructs the above from the `__init__` method, not taking into account `__classcall__`. If one looks at the html output of the reference manual, the INPUT field arrives just after the class declaration. But I agree with you that this does not reflect the way the class should be invoked. I don't know what is the policy here. Possibly, this issue appears in other parts of Sage as well.

OK thanks. Meanwhile, let us leave things as they are, i.e. have the INPUT section of `Chart` and `RealChart` docstrings describe `__classcall__`.
