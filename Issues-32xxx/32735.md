`git grep 'all import CC'`

`CC` is actually defined in `src/sage/rings/all.py` (as well as locally in several other modules), not in `src/sage/rings/complex_mpfr.pyx` because of cyclic imports. We create a new module `sage.rings.cc` for it.

Likewise for `CIF`.

We change almost all uses; follow-up in #33006.
