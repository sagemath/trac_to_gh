<a id='comment:4'></a>- first example does not need QQbar since all points are QQ-rational

```
g.change_ring(QQbar).periodic_points(1)
```


- why do we need the #long time example? Is there a quicker example that would also demonstrate the functionality? Although polynomial base ring seems to be broken in general

```
R.<c> = QQ[]
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(R, 1)
f = DynamicalSystem_projective([x^2 + 2*y^2, y^2])
f.affine_preperiodic_model(1)
```

Here is a different kind of failure

```
R.<c> = GF(3)[]
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(R, 1)
f = DynamicalSystem_projective([x^2 +c*y^2, y^2])
f.affine_preperiodic_model(1)
```



- typos in error message

```
('Preperiod must be nonnegative')
```


- Need a subscheme example

- notice that m,n are in a different order than for preperiodoic_points parameters. It should match

```
g=f.affine_preperiodic_model(1,0)
g.preperiodic_points(0,1)
```

This was a dependency error. I hadn't merged the latest #31906 into #31954.
