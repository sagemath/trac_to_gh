```
The change made on #31381 is not compatible with the previous behavior of `backward=True` for the edge options with `dot2tex` rendering of graphs. In particular, this was seen when viewing KR crystals such as

```
view(crystals.KirillovReshetikhin(['C',3,1], 3,1))
```

We will add back in the `backward` option, which supports different behavior than `dir='back'`:

- `backward=True` will be a layout-only indication that a particular arrow should be oriented in the opposite direction compared to other arrows.
- `dir='back'` will have the arrows pointing in the backwards direction.

This also reverts the change in #31719 to get the previous behavior.

I still haven't had the opportunity the try the branch. My last update of sage broke and I need to take a look. But looking at the proposed branch, I have one comment:

the change

```diff
+        - ``"backward"`` (boolean)
```
needs documentation. Maybe for an English speaker it is clear, but to me, it is difficult to understand the difference between `dir='back'` and `backward=True`. That difference needs to be explained in words here. Secondly, it should explicit what it does (that is, `u,v=v,u` and etc.). Also, it should be explained that it is something that will work only when `prog='dot'` and not for the other Graphviz programs like neato, fdp, circo, etc.

This is why I still think it is kind of a hack but I don't disagree to put it back.

It is definitely not a hack as the layout order matters (for at least one program), and we have mathematical information attached to the digraph that would be wrong if we change the arrows.
