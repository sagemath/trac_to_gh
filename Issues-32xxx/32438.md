```
The change made on #31381 is not compatible with the previous behavior of `backward=True` for the edge options with `dot2tex` rendering of graphs. In particular, this was seen when viewing KR crystals such as

```
view(crystals.KirillovReshetikhin(['C',3,1], 3,1))
```

We will add back in the `backward` option, which supports different behavior than `dir='back'`:

- `backward=True` will be a layout-only indication that a particular arrow should be oriented in the opposite direction compared to other arrows.
- `dir='back'` will have the arrows pointing in the backwards direction.

This also reverts the change in #31719 to get the previous behavior.

I still haven't had the opportunity the try the branch. My last update of sage broke and I need to take a look. But looking at the proposed branch, I have one comment:

the change

```diff
+        - ``"backward"`` (boolean)
```
needs documentation. Maybe for an English speaker it is clear, but to me, it is difficult to understand the difference between `dir='back'` and `backward=True`. That difference needs to be explained in words here. Secondly, it should explicit what it does (that is, `u,v=v,u` and etc.). Also, it should be explained that it is something that will work only when `prog='dot'` and not for the other Graphviz programs like neato, fdp, circo, etc.

This is why I still think it is kind of a hack but I don't disagree to put it back.

I added a bit more to the example to indicate more clearly what changes, which is in line with the rest of the documentation for that section. Everything within that the code does works for all such programs (although it may or may not have an impact, but that is irrelevant).

It is definitely not a hack as the layout order matters (for at least one program), and we have mathematical information attached to the digraph that would be wrong if we change the arrows.
