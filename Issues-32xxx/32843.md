The following innocent code crashes SageMath 9.4 as well as 9.5.beta5:

```
f = function('f')(x)
save(f, 'f')
f = load('f.sobj')
print(f)
```

Output:

```
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

...
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Segmentation Fault
