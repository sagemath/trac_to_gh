This ticket is for everything concerning
dropping support for Python 3.7.

It can be set as a dependency for other tickets.

For instance tickets upgrading packages to
versions that no longer support Python 3.7.

Timeframe:
- Python 3.7 EOL is 2023-06. (https://endoflife.date/python)
- On `debian-buster` (EOL 2022-08, https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases), Python 3.7 is the default and newest available Python version.
- Some projects follow NEP 29 (see #30384), which recommends to drop Python 3.7 already in 2021-12.
  - #32423 Update of numpy to 1.22.x, scipy 1.8

Related:

- #30551: Drop Python 3.6 support (merged in Sage 9.4.beta0)
- #30384: Adopt "time window-based" Python versions support policy
- #29756: Meta-ticket: Review of Python 3 features that sagelib should use systematically
