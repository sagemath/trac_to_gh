In contrast to parent classes subclassing `CachedRepresentation` or `UniqueRepresentation`, unique parents that are constructed using `UniqueFactory` do not have specialized `__copy__`, `__deepcopy__` methods:

```
sage:     sage: k = GF((5, 2),'c'); k 
....:

sage: %timeit copy(k)

sage: %timeit deepcopy(k)
