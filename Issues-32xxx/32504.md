We extend the `dominating_set` method to report a minimum distance-k dominating set. When `k=1`, this is the standard dominating set. When `k` is the radius of the graph, a single vertex is sufficient to dominate all other vertices.

On the way, we avoid the use of `Integer(round(...))` when returning the cardinality of the solution.

See #32503 for a greedy heuristic for distance k dominating set.

This should be

```diff
-return len(dom) if value_only else dom
+return Integer(len(dom)) if value_only else dom
```
to make sure we don't leak a Python `int` to a more casual user. Otherwise LGTM. You can set a positive review once changed.
