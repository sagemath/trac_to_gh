We extend the `dominating_set` method to report a minimum distance-k dominating set. When `k=1`, this is the standard dominating set. When `k` is the radius of the graph, a single vertex is sufficient to dominate all other vertices.

On the way, we avoid the use of `Integer(round(...))` when returning the cardinality of the solution.

See #32503 for a greedy heuristic for distance k dominating set.
