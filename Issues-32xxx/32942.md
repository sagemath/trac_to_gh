This  

```sage
%display latex
dm = get_display_manager()   
dm.preferences.align_latex = 'left'  # or 'center' or None
(1+x)^10/(1+x+x^2)
```
displays the expression flush left, which is the new default.

Sorry for the delay in reviewing!

A few comments:
- the option name `display_latex` sounds a little too vague and also may - introduce some confusion with the magic `%display latex`. Wouldn't `align_latex` be a better name?
- I've tested the new feature with Jupyterlab 3.3 (cf. #32069), it works well!
- Regarding Jupyter (classic), LaTeX outputs are always left-aligned for me (on two distinct Ubuntu 20.04 computers), as discussed atticket: ticket:32859#comment:16#comment:32859 and setting `dm.preferences.display_latex = 'center'` does not change this...
- Shouldn't `'left'` be the default, instead of `'center'`? Left-align is the default for SymPy MathJax display in a pure Python 3 notebook and I see no reason to deviate from SymPy policy here.  It also better (more readable) for short outputs, like `0`.

I agree. 

> - Regarding Jupyter (classic), LaTeX outputs are always left-aligned for me (on two distinct Ubuntu 20.04 computers), as discussed atticket: ticket:32859#comment:16#comment:32859 and setting `dm.preferences.display_latex = 'center'` does not change this...


"left" alignment is forced in the classic notebook. It seems developers decided so. Hence `align_latex` is only for jupyterlab.

> - Shouldn't `'left'` be the default, instead of `'center'`? Left-align is the default for SymPy MathJax display in a pure Python 3 notebook and I see no reason to deviate from SymPy policy here.  It also better (more readable) for short outputs, like `0`.

What do you mean by "de facto default"? I have the impression that, on the contrary,  Jupyterlab's default is left-aligned, see e.g. the discussion [LaTeX display math in output cells should be left-aligned](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3938) on Jupyterlab github. For instance, in Jupyterlab with Python 3 kernel, the following cells all result in a left-aligned output:

```
import sympy
sympy.sqrt(2)
```

```
from IPython.display import Latex
Latex(r"$\sqrt{2+x}$")
```

```
Latex(r"$$\sqrt{2+x}$$")
```

```
Latex(r"\[\sqrt{2+x}\]")
```

```
Latex(r"\begin{equation}\sqrt{2+x}\end{equation}")
```



> and "left" alignment is expensive in that the additional code `\displaystyle" is inserted in every output cell

Yes this is (one more!) drawback of our "%display latex" magic; instead of relying on Jupyter's native latex display...
>
>I am not sure if changing the default is a right thing... If you strongly insist, then I would follow. Do you?

Despite the \displaystyle burden, I would vote in favor on the left-aligned default, for compatibility both with the display in Sage classic Jupyter and with the default for SymPy and Latex in Jupyterlab. It seems also that users prefer left-aligned, cf. https://ask.sagemath.org/question/59775/. Shall we organize a vote on sage-devel?

I meant center alignment is status quo, and is what users got used to in jupyterlab (including myself).

I agree. The current default center alignment may be regarded as a defect. No vote in fixing a defect. But perhaps we need to advertise (in release tour?) how to change the behavior for those users that do not like the new default.
