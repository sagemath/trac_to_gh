The following use of `gcd()` fails:

```
sage: gcd(x for x in [123,456,789])
# ...
TypeError: object of type 'generator' has no len()
```

At the same time, `lcm()` works fine with generators:

```
sage: lcm(x for x in [123,456,789])
4917048
```

The proposed fix is to make sure we consume the generator only once in `gcd()` and pass it to `GCD_list()` as a list.

It seems this 

```diff
     if seq.universe() is ZZ:
-        return GCD_list(a)
+        return GCD_list(seq)
     else:
         return __GCD_sequence(seq, **kwargs)
```
is enough to fix the bug, and enforcing the type in `GCD_list()` is not necessary. Is it?
