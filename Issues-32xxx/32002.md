Our integration strategy is to first try Maxima and,
if that fails, try other engines.

When the integrand has a constant factor, Maxima first turns
`integral(c*f(x), x, a, b)` into `c*integral(f(x), x, a, b)`.
If it cannot evaluate it further, we fail to detect that,
as we only check whether the outer operator of the obtained
symbolic expression is an integral.

For instance, in Sage 9.3, this integral is computed
correctly (Maxima fails, but Giac computes it):

```
sage: min = min_symbolic
sage: integral(min(x, 2*x), x, -1, 1)
-1/2
```
but this rescaled-by-two version tricks us:

```
sage: integral(2*min(x, 2*x), x, -1, 1)
2*integrate(min(2*x, x), x, -1, 1)
```
even though Giac can compute it:

```
sage: integral(2*min(x, 2*x), x, -1, 1, algorithm='giac')
-1
```
(Since `2*integrate(min(2*x, x), x, -1, 1)` is a product,
not an integral, we failed to try Giac.)

This ticket refines the logic for whether to try
another integrator so as to deal with such cases.
