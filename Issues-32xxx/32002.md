Our integration strategy is to first try Maxima and,
if that fails, try other engines.

When the integrand has a constant factor, Maxima first turns
`integral(c*f(x), x, a, b)` into `c*integral(f(x), x, a, b)`.
If it cannot evaluate it further, we fail to detect that,
as we only check whether the outer operator of the obtained
symbolic expression is an integral.

For instance, in Sage 9.3, this integral is computed
correctly (Maxima fails, but Giac computes it):

```
sage: min = min_symbolic
sage: integral(min(x, 2*x), x, -1, 1)
-1/2
```
but this rescaled-by-two version tricks us:

```
sage: integral(2*min(x, 2*x), x, -1, 1)
2*integrate(min(2*x, x), x, -1, 1)
```
even though Giac can compute it:

```
sage: integral(2*min(x, 2*x), x, -1, 1, algorithm='giac')
-1
```
(Since `2*integrate(min(2*x, x), x, -1, 1)` is a product,
not an integral, we failed to try Giac.)

This ticket refines the logic for whether to try
another integrator so as to deal with such cases.

I have cut off the long doctest.

I have also added an example of partially-integrated answer returned by maxima. In this example, giac will give a full answer.

-namely, when there is a common factor, maxima factors this out of the result. This prevents the automatic choice of integrator to work correctly, as it only looks wether the outer operator of the symbolic expression is an integral or not.
+Our integration strategy is to first try Maxima and,
+if that fails, try other engines.
+
+When the integrand has a constant factor, Maxima first turns
+`integral(c*f(x), x, a, b)` into `c*integral(f(x), x, a, b)`.
+If it cannot evaluate it further, we fail to detect that,
+as we only check whether the outer operator of the obtained
+symbolic expression is an integral.
+
+For instance, in Sage 9.3, this integral is computed
+correctly (Maxima fails, but Giac computes it):
 
 ```
 sage: min = min_symbolic
-sage: integral(min(x,2*x),x,-1,1)                                               
+sage: integral(min(x, 2*x), x, -1, 1)
 -1/2
-sage: integral(2*min(x,2*x),x,-1,1)                                             
+```
+but this rescaled-by-two version tricks us:
+
+```
+sage: integral(2*min(x, 2*x), x, -1, 1)
 2*integrate(min(2*x, x), x, -1, 1)
-sage: integral(2*min(x,2*x),x,-1,1, algorithm='giac')                           
+```
+even though Giac can compute it:
+
+```
+sage: integral(2*min(x, 2*x), x, -1, 1, algorithm='giac')
 -1
 ```
+(Since `2*integrate(min(2*x, x), x, -1, 1)` is a product,
+not an integral, we failed to try Giac.)
 
+This ticket refines the logic for whether to try
+another integrator so as to deal with such cases.

The problem is that giac 1.7 can do the integral, but Sage doesn't understand the answer

```
sage: giac_integrator(1/((x^3 + 2*x + 1)*(x - 4)), x)
[...]
NotImplementedError: Unable to parse Giac output: 1/73*ln(abs(sageVARx-4))+((-292/9*rootof([[-3,0,-30,0,-48],[1,0,12,0,36,0,59]])-3796)/(3*(1/27*rootof([[-3,0,-30,0,-48],[1,0,12,0,36,0,59]]))^2+2)*ln(sageVARx-1/27*rootof([[-3,0,-30,0,-48],[1,0,12,0,36,0,59]]))+(-146/9*rootof([[3,0,30,27,48],[1,0,12,0,36,0,59]])-3796)/(3*(1/54*rootof([[3,0,30,27,48],[1,0,12,0,36,0,59]]))^2+2)*ln(sageVARx-1/54*rootof([[3,0,30,27,48],[1,0,12,0,36,0,59]]))+(-146/9*rootof([[3,0,30,-27,48],[1,0,12,0,36,0,59]])-3796)/(3*(1/54*rootof([[3,0,30,-27,48],[1,0,12,0,36,0,59]]))^2+2)*ln(sageVARx-1/54*rootof([[3,0,30,-27,48],[1,0,12,0,36,0,59]])))/15987-1/219*ln(abs(sageVARx^3+2*sageVARx+1))
