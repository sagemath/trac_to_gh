<a id='comment:5'></a>Can you comment on this and similar changes:

```diff
-        return Integer(n)
+        return ZZ(n)
```
I was under the vague impression `Integer(n)`
should be preferred to `ZZ(n)`.

Maybe because it's more direct? or slightly faster?
Doesn't `ZZ(n)` call `Integer(n)` in the end?

From a quick look, by calling `Integer`, you avoid a trip through Sage's coercion check as `ZZ._element_constructor_` is `Integer`. So `Integer(n)` is faster, but maybe less robust?

<a id='comment:8'></a>Importing `ZZ` is needed here in any case
for `ZZ.zero()` and `ZZ.one()`.

I also doubt a few tens of nanoseconds
will impact OEIS-related code.

All in all I am fine with either solution,
I was just curious.
