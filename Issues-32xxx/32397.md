Can you comment on this and similar changes:

```diff
-        return Integer(n)
+        return ZZ(n)
```
I was under the vague impression `Integer(n)`
should be preferred to `ZZ(n)`.

Maybe because it's more direct? or slightly faster?
Doesn't `ZZ(n)` call `Integer(n)` in the end?

I am never really sure which one to use. From a quick look, by calling `Integer`, you avoid a trip through Sage's coercion check as `ZZ._element_constructor_` is `Integer`. So `Integer(n)` is faster, but maybe less robust? Anyways, as Frédéric mentioned, this was just getting rid of an alias. Maybe I should have gotten rid of the `ZZ(n)` calls and imported `Integer`. Well, either way, I doubt this will be a bottleneck in any code and have an impact.

Importing `ZZ` is needed here in any case
for `ZZ.zero()` and `ZZ.one()`.

I also doubt a few tens of nanoseconds
will impact OEIS-related code.

All in all I am fine with either solution,
I was just curious.
