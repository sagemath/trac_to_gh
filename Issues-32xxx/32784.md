As a follow-up to #29024, we prevent the system singular from being used to run GH actions when the homebrew prefix is not `/usr/local` (which causes problems for its singular package).

Turns out this patch is not needed for our GH Actions.

Homebrew's from-source installation of `singular` only fails if there's already a homebrew-installed `flint` in `/usr/local` (or any of the paths of Singular's `DEFAULT_CHECKING_PATH`.
