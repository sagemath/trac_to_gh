Haven't tried yet, but this part:

```
+            except OSError:
+                shutil.rmtree(self.target)
+                os.rename(self.tempname, self.target)

This code is just adapted from the corresponding part of `atomic_write`. It worked fine for me in all of my tests (using Python 3.9). But indeed, the second patchbot (using Python 3.7) shows (ignored) `FileNotFoundError` in cleanup:

Unfortunately, the traceback doesn't show how this is caused by my code. Do you have any ideas on how to make this part more safe?

I think a first step should be to clarify the semantics in the documentation of this class: This is for creating a directory whose contents are determined uniquely by the directory name. If multiple threads or processes attempt to create it in parallel, then it does not matter which thread created it.

If this is the intended semantics, then the following should be correct:

```
            # Success: move temporary file to target file
            try:
                os.rename(self.tempname, self.target)
            except FileExistsError:
                # Race: Another thread or process must have created the directory
                pass
```

Good idea! If cleaning is necessary then the calling code is responsible. If so, it can still lead to a race of removing the directory but under better controlled conditions.
