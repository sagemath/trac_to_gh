This ticket is the obvious next step after #32388: We move lots of code from `EllipticCurveIsogeny` to `EllipticCurveHom`, and implement the missing `EllipticCurveHom` methods in `WeierstrassIsomorphism`.

This should make `WeierstrassIsomorphism` close to indistinguishable from `EllipticCurveIsogeny`.

All the really new code is in `weierstrass_morphism.py` and should be straightforward. The other changes are just moving things around and some small tweaks that shouldn't cause any observable changes in behaviour.

(The only "real" dependency is #32388. I've merged the others into this branch too because it made sense, but in principle this could be rebased on top of #32388 alone if one of the others gets stalled for some reason.)

Sorry, I cannot review in depth; just a few things.

Some `.. NOTE::` blocks are indented by only three spaces
instead of the required four. Please fix.

Possible cosmetic changes (feel free to ignore):

Thanks for having a look! I had just started applying your suggestions, but there are two sources of trouble:
