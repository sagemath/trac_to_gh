So you want to do some logic stuff and to print fancy truthtables? Okay, you can do it:

```
sage: log = SymbolicLogic() 
....: F = log.statement("A->B") 
....: T = log.truthtable(F) 
....: log.print_table(T)                                                                                                                                                               
A     | B     | value | 
------------------------
False | False | True  | 
False | True  | True  | 
True  | False | False | 
True  | True  | True  |
```

But you can do it only once.

```
sage: log.print_table(T)                                                                                                                                                              
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    241         vars_order.append('value')
    242         for var in vars_order:

```

It's pretty bad to implicitly change a list that came as function parameter, you break your data. It's better to make a copy and work on it. I made a patch.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Like `print_table`, the `truthtable` method also changed one of its arguments: it reversed the order of the list of variable names in `statement[2]`. The PR fixes this. (It also adds a doctest, and removes a reversal in the `print_table` method that was presumably added to try to compensate for the reversal that was done in the `truthtable` method.)

The PR also fixes two incorrect doctests.  One of the doctests of the `print_table` method said that part of a certain truth table should be 

```
a     | b     | c     | value | value |
----------------------------------------
False | False | False | True  | True  |
False | False | True  | False | False |
False | False | True  | True  | False |
False | True  | False | False | True  |
```
That is absurd: there cannot be two `value` columns.

And a doctest of the `truthtable` method said that part of the truth table of `a&b|!(c|a)` should be

```
['False', 'False', 'True', 'False'],
['False', 'True', 'False', 'True'],
['False', 'True', 'True', 'True'],
['True', 'False', 'False', 'False']
```
But the third row of this is wrong: if `a` is `False`, but `b` and `c` are `True`, then the statement is `False`, not `True`.

I also rebased on 9.5b4.
