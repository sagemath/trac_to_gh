When building the pdf documentation every time the sage docbuilder runs a Makefile to convert .tex source to .pdf files there appears a `jobserver` warning. The first occurrence is:

```
[reference] processing references.tex... index

[reference] done

[reference] copying TeX support files... copying TeX support files...
[reference] done
[reference] The LaTeX files are in local/share/doc/sage/latex/en/reference/references.

make[5]: warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1.  Add '+' to parent make rule.

```
