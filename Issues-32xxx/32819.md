Currently, the determinant is implemented only for knots.

However, the determinant for multi-component links is defined in the same way as for knots.

So I propose to allow multi-component links in the determinant function.

Moreover, it seems simpler to take determinant of the symmetrized Seifert matrix, instead of the evaluation of the Alexander polynomial at -1.
