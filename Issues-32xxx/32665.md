We deprecate the functions `is_SymbolicExpressionRing` and `is_CallableSymbolicExpressionRing` and replace all uses by `isinstance` with new ABCs `sage.rings.abc.SymbolicRing`, `sage.rings.abc.CallableSymbolicExpressionRing`.

As a follow-up on #32638, which deprecated `is_Expression`, we remove uses of `is_SymbolicEquation`, `is_CallableSymbolicExpression`, `is_SymbolicVariable` outside of `sage.symbolic`, `sage.calculus`, `sage.interfaces.maxima_lib`.

We replace these uses by `isinstance(x, Expression)` and a method call. We add a new method `Expression.is_callable`.

This is part of meta-ticket #32414.
