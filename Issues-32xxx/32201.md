These are the {0,1}- and {+oo,0}-valued functions on the ambient space that indicate set membership.  The main focus of this ticket is on `indicator_function`.

`indicator_function`s form algebras in which multiplication is the pointwise multiplication; it corresponds to taking intersections. Every indicator function is an idempotent.

The indicator functions of the faces of a `PolyhedralComplex` form a basis. The indicator functions of their relative interiors form another basis - of orthogonal idempotents. 
The algebra is isomorphic to the `MoebiusAlgebra` of the opposite of the face poset.


`convex_indicator_function`s merely form a cone of functions. We introduce them on this ticket only to clarify the terminology, and in preparation for a connection to cvxpy (https://www.cvxpy.org/api_reference/cvxpy.transforms.html#cvxpy.transforms.indicator) in #31981
