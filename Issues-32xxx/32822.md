<a id='comment:2'></a>in `src/sage/dynamics/arithmetic_dynamics/endPN_automorphism_group.py`, you could also add the missing space after `#`

```diff
-                    #range over all orders
+                    # range over all orders
```

same in `src/sage/dynamics/arithmetic_dynamics/projective_ds.py` where we see in the diff

```diff
             #computes the error bound as defined in Algorithm 3.1 of [WELLS]
             if Res > 1:
-                if not err is None:
+                if err is not None:
```
and

```diff
                         #for each periodic point get the entire cycle
-                        if not Q in periodic_points:
+                        if Q not in periodic_points:
```


in `src/sage/dynamics/arithmetic_dynamics/wehlerK3.py`, you slightly changed the test. Is it what is expected here ?

```diff
-        if not (i in [0,1,2]) and not (j in [0,1,2]):
+        if i not in [0, 1, 2] or j not in [0, 1, 2]:
             raise ValueError("the two indexes must be either 0, 1, or 2")
```

<a id='comment:4'></a>Voila pour quelques espaces.

Concernant le test modifié, il est devenu plus cohérent avec le message d'erreur, donc ça me semble correct.
