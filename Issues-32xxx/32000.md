Rtree is a ctypes Python wrapper of libspatialindex that provides a number of advanced spatial indexing features for the spatially curious Python user. These features include:

Nearest neighbor search

Intersection search

Multi-dimensional indexes

Clustered indexes (store Python pickles directly with index entries)

Bulk loading

Deletion

Disk serialization

Custom storage implementation (to implement spatial indexing in ZODB, for example).

Although it is named as Rtree, it also provides options for its variants in terms of splitting. There are 3 ways for it, that is, linear, quadratic, and R* tree splitting. The difference of them can be found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree.


We create a normal package for `Rtree`.

- PyPI package: ​https://pypi.org/project/Rtree/
- points to... ​https://github.com/Toblerity/Rtree
- latest documentation: https://rtree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- `libspatialindex` library: https://libspatialindex.org/en/latest/

In addition, 
CGAL also provides an implementation called "Intersecting Sequences of dD Iso-oriented Boxes" for the R tree, https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Box_intersection_d/index.html#Chapter_Intersecting_Sequences_of_dD_Iso-oriented_Boxes.

`git reset --hard HEAD~` takes away the top commit on your branch.

Using `git push --force` you can send the updated branch to the remote.
