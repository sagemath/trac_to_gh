.. yet. One of the obstacles standing in our way (although not a problem unique to python packages) is custom patching.

If we have to patch, we can patch; it just seems a little early for the nuclear option.

Frankly it's pretty unrealistic for the Sage distribution to support it any time soon. I've sketched the best approach in #29023 and it's pretty complicated.

> One of the obstacles standing in our way (although not a problem unique to python packages) is custom patching.

I agree (see #31543) that the Sage *library* should not depend on custom patched Python packages.

But this cannot stop us to fix the Sage *distribution* so that it does not run into build problems. Note in particular that this build problem (of a standard package!) stops developers from actually testing Python 3.10 and therefore blocks necessary progress in our library. 

If it helps, think of the Sage *distribution* as a reference environment for developers. 

> If we have to patch, we can patch; it just seems a little early for the nuclear option.

That's a little dramatic. To stay within your metaphor, we already have dozens of nuclear plants running -- adding another one technically is to take the "nuclear option" but lacks the drama that this turn of phrase is meant to invoke.
