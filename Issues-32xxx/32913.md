(from #32713#comment:11)

Users need the wheel of **sage-conf** when creating venvs. And we need the wheels of packages **sage-conf** and **sage-setup** when testing distributions using `./sage -sh -c '(cd pkgs/sagemath-standard && tox -v -v -v -e python-sagewheels-nopypi)'` and similar - as documented in the developer's guide as of #32899.

Until editable wheels (PEP 660) are implemented in **setuptools** (or we switch the distributions to another build system that implements PEP 660 such as **flit**), we revert the change made in #32713 for these packages.

But we keep **sage-docbuild** editable.

For example, something along the following lines (in src/tox):

```
[testenv]
usedevelop=True # Instruct tox to use editable install of main sagemath package
deps=
  --editable=file:///{toxinidir}/../path/to/sage_conf # Install sage-conf as editable install
```

With the new branch `public/build/trac_editable` you can run `tox -e py38` (or 39) from the `src` folder and get a tox environment with editable installs of sagemath-standard and sage-conf. Some of the tests are failing (because gap and blas are not using sage-conf but determine stuff at runtime during env variables) and there might be a more elegant way to set the env variables but as a prototype this should suffice.
