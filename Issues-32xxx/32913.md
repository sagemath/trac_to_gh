(from [#32713 comment:11](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/32713#comment:11))

Users need the wheel of **sage-conf** when creating venvs. And we need the wheels of packages **sage-conf** and **sage-setup** when testing distributions using `./sage -sh -c '(cd pkgs/sagemath-standard && tox -v -v -v -e python-sagewheels-nopypi)'` and similar - as documented in the developer's guide as of #32899.

Until editable wheels (PEP 660) are implemented in **setuptools** (or we switch the distributions to another build system that implements PEP 660 such as **flit**), we revert the change made in #32713 for these packages.

But we keep **sage-docbuild** editable.

Sorry, but I still don't understand why you need to build and use wheels for sage packages if all of them use editable installs. Why can one not install them (as editable) in the tox environments?

For example, something along the following lines (in src/tox):

```
[testenv]
usedevelop=True # Instruct tox to use editable install of main sagemath package
deps=
  --editable=file:///{toxinidir}/../path/to/sage_conf # Install sage-conf as editable install
```

Potentially combined with a custom `install_command` that invokes pip with `find-links` to discover the wheels of other dependencies that are build during `make`.
