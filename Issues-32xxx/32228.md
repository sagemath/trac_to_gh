Do we want to fix the syntax-block errors and unused import in this ticket?

Coverage is likely more for another ticket.

If all methods from `ParametrizedSurface3D` have equivalent functionalities in `PseudoRiemannianSubmanifold` I would say that deprecation of the class makes sense. However, this could potentially breaks a lot of code in the future. For that reason, I would suggest to carefully document the "new way of doing". That is to say
- in each method of `ParametrizedSurface3D` there should be an explanation of the equivalent `PseudoRiemannianSubmanifold` way of doing
- for each relevant doctest in `ParametrizedSurface3D`, the same computation should be reproduced with a `PseudoRiemannianSubmanifold` object.

This is just my way of thinking. I will not work on the ticket and you are definitely free to take any decision you would find more appropriate.
