(from [#31901 comment:19](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31901#comment:19))

The assumptions should not be global but chart-wise.

There is already a context manager `assuming`. We could create it at initialization and invoke it using `with` whenever computations are done with this chart.

We go through a new method `assuming` of `CalculusMethod` that dispatches in the same way as the `simplify` method does.

That is indeed true.

Related to the discussion in #30232, perhaps it makes sense to introduce rings of expressions under symbolic assumptions. Simplifying an expression using an additional assumption would then be a coercion!
