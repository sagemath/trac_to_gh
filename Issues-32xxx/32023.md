In the following example, `FractionWithFactoredDenominator.cohomology_decomposition` fails, which might hint at either a mathematical problem, or at an issue with the implementation. The situation has to be debugged carefully.

```
sage: from sage.rings.asymptotic.asymptotics_multivariate_generating_functions import FractionWithFactoredDenominatorRing
sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: FFPD = FractionWithFactoredDenominatorRing(R, SR)

sage: H = (1 - (x*y + x*z + y*z + 2*x*y*z))^2
sage: Hfac = H.factor()
sage: G = 1 / Hfac.unit()
sage: F = FFPD(G, Hfac)

sage: F.cohomology_decomposition()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
