(split out from #13811, follow-up on #32454)

Most Sage objects are immutable. Nevertheless, `copy` and `deepcopy` make copies (through pickling/unpickling) for them because we have not provided the classes with `__copy__` methods (which should just return the object) and `__deepcopy__` methods (which in many cases should just return the object).

```
sage: a = 0
sage: copy(a) is a
False
```

In this ticket, we take care of number field elements.

Sorry, there one other doc thing I just noticed. For `NumberFieldElement_quadratic.__deepcopy__()`, the documentation is wrong as it does not return a copy.
