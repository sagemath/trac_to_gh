One way of dealing with these kinds of merge conflicts is to set the "Dependencies" field to #30698, and rebase this branch on the branch there.

```diff

If you look at the ticket description, you can see that the branch is displayed in red, and if you hover over it, you see "trac's automerging failed". If plain merging by git gives no problem, this indicates that trac tries a merge with particularly conservative and sage settings. However, I think you'll at least have to make sure that trac can do the merge, because otherwise reviewers have a harder time seeing what's happening on the ticket.
