If one uses the method `stereographic_coordinates` to initialize steographic coordinates (instead of as via the constructor argument), then there are some inconsistencies.

For example, 

```
sage: M = manifolds.Sphere(2)
sage: XN = M.stereographic_coordinates(pole='north')
sage: g = M.metric()
sage: U = XN.domain(); U
Open subset S^2-{NP} of the 2-sphere S^2 of radius 1 smoothly embedded in the 
 Euclidean space E^3
sage: g.restrict(U).display()
g = (cos(theta)^2 - 2*cos(theta) + 1) dy1⊗dy1
  + (cos(theta)^2 - 2*cos(theta) + 1) dy2⊗dy2
```
One would certainly expect the components of g to be expressed in terms of (y1,y2), i.e. the chart XN, which is the only chart that covers entirely U = S^2-{NP}.

> As one can see, the volume form has components with respect to a coordinate frame on S2-{SP} but with respect to a vector frame on S2-{NP}.

This is because the volume form is defined with respect to the orientation provided by the frame of stereographic coordinates on  S2-{SP}. The frame of stereographic coordinates on S2-{NP} having the opposite orientation, a vector frame `(f1, f2)` is introduced there to keep the orientation. As you can read on line 954 of `src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/examples/sphere.py`, the relation to the coordinate frame is very simple: `f1 = -d/dy1`, `f2 = d/dy2`. 
See also the comment on the orientation in the [reference manual for Sphere](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/differentiable/examples/sphere.html).

A side remark:

```
from sage.manifolds.differentiable.examples.sphere import Sphere
M = Sphere(2)
```
can be shorten to 

```
M = manifolds.Sphere(2)
```
`manifolds` providing a direct access to the manifold catalog. 

Note that the class `Sphere` is not extensively tested and might have some bugs.

Thanks for having a look at this.

So the vector frame `f` is only needed to specify the orienation? I guess then its easy to also calculate the components of the volumen form in the coordinate frame, since it's only a overall factor of minus 1.

I had a look at the implementation and would propose to circumvent this problem completely by slightly generalizing the way an orientation is represented in sage.
Currently, it is as a list of frames for which the chart transitions are orientation-preserving.
More generally one can assign to each chart (or frame) a sign, where two such signs have to be equal if the chart transition is orientation-preserving and otherwise they have to differ (thatt is, a 0-cochain trivializating the Z_2-valued orientation 1-cocycle).
Using this extension, one could simply say that the chart on SP-NP gets a minus sign instead of needing to introduce a new frame.

What do you think?

Indeed, and Sage will do it automatically if required, because it knows all the automorphisms connecting the various frames. In particular, it knows the automorphism linking `f` to the coordinate frame on `S^2-{NP}`.

I am not sure to understand what your problem is. At the initialization of the volume form, only the minimal amount of information is stored in the attribute `_components`. The user shall not access this private attribute directly, but should instead ask for components via the method `comp()` or `display()`. The required components are then automatically computed if they need to be and cached in `_components`. For instance:

```
sage: M = manifolds.Sphere(2, coordinates='stereographic')
sage: eps = M.metric().volume_form()
sage: for restr in eps._restrictions.values():
....:     print(restr)
....:     for comp in restr._components:
....:         print(comp)
....:
2-form eps_g on the Open subset S^2-{SP} of the 2-sphere S^2 of radius 1 smoothly embedded in the Euclidean space E^3
Coordinate frame (S^2-{SP}, (∂/∂yp1,∂/∂yp2))
2-form eps_g on the Open subset S^2-{NP} of the 2-sphere S^2 of radius 1 smoothly embedded in the Euclidean space E^3
Vector frame (S^2-{NP}, (f_1,f_2))
```
As you noticed, `eps` is initialized only w.r.t. `f` on `S^2-{NP}`. But you can access to the components in the coordinate frame by `comp()`:

```
sage: Nf = M.stereographic_coordinates().frame(); Nf
Coordinate frame (S^2-{NP}, (∂/∂y1,∂/∂y2))
sage: eps.comp(Nf)
Fully antisymmetric 2-indices components w.r.t. Coordinate frame (S^2-{NP}, (∂/∂y1,∂/∂y2))
```
Note that the attribute `_components` has been updated:

```
sage: for restr in eps._restrictions.values():
....:     print(restr)
....:     for comp in restr._components:
....:         print(comp)
....:         
2-form eps_g on the Open subset S^2-{SP} of the 2-sphere S^2 of radius 1 smoothly embedded in the Euclidean space E^3
Coordinate frame (S^2-{SP}, (∂/∂yp1,∂/∂yp2))
2-form eps_g on the Open subset S^2-{NP} of the 2-sphere S^2 of radius 1 smoothly embedded in the Euclidean space E^3
Vector frame (S^2-{NP}, (f_1,f_2))
Coordinate frame (S^2-{NP}, (∂/∂y1,∂/∂y2))
```
Invoking `display()` instead of `comp()` would have produced the same result:

```
sage: eps.display(Nf)
eps_g = -4/(y1^4 + y2^4 + 2*(y1^2 + 1)*y2^2 + 2*y1^2 + 1) dy1∧dy2
```

fails with the error "ValueError: no common chart for the multiplication" (in the last line). I thought that this might be a result of the difference in vector vs coordinate frame.
But I guess based on your comments, the issue is more that `FreeModuleTensor#contract` is directly using `_components` instead of trying to compute the components in the other frame using `comp`, right?


I've opened #32974 for the idea to improve the orientation of manifolds (using a general framework).

No, `FreeModuleTensor.contract` is doing things correctly by invoking 

```
basis = self.common_basis(other)
```
(cf. line 2826 of `src/sage/tensor/modules/free_module_tensor.py`), which computes the components in a common frame by calling `comp` if necessary.
The issue you are facing is rather due to some flaw in the current implementation of `Sphere`, as already mentioned in [comment:2](#comment:2). To circumvent it, you should use 

```
M = manifolds.Sphere(2, coordinates='stereographic')
```
if you plan to work with stereographic coordinates. Then `M.metric().volume_form().contract(X)` returns no error.

This declaration of the scalar field `H` is not mathematically correct: it enforces the same coordinate expression `H(x,y)` for all the coordinates `(x,y)` in the manifold's atlas, which cannot be, except for a constant scalar field. Furthermore, it introduces a confusion between `function('H')` and the scalar field `H`. For the sake of clarity, different symbols shall be used.

Spheres are automatically initialized with spherical coordinates if not stated otherwise. That means, at the point of initialization, the default chart is set to the one given by spherical coordinates. I bet this to be the culprit of that "inconsistency".

If you want to initialize the sphere with stereographic coordinates right from the start, you can use `manifolds.Sphere(2, coordinates='stereographic')`.

One would probably have to transcribe the `display` method in such a way that the chart used for displaying is tried to be obtained from (the restriction) of the chart which the frame is induced from before the default chart is used. This is just my guess from not looking into the code.

I would say like this:

```
sage: M = manifolds.Sphere(2, coordinates='stereographic')
sage: XN.<y1, y2> = M.stereographic_coordinates(pole='north')
sage: XS = M.stereographic_coordinates(pole='south')
sage: H = M.scalar_field({XN: function('h')(y1, y2)}, name='H')
sage: H.add_expr_by_continuation(XS, XN.domain().intersection(XS.domain()))
sage: H.display()
H: S^2 → ℝ
on S^2-{NP}: (y1, y2) ↦ h(y1, y2)
on S^2-{SP}: (yp1, yp2) ↦ h(yp1/(yp1^2 + yp2^2), yp2/(yp1^2 + yp2^2))
```
Thanks to [add_expr_by_continuation](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/scalarfield.html#sage.manifolds.scalarfield.ScalarField.add_expr_by_continuation), the scalar field is defined in a consistent way on all the manifold.

I see your point, but I am afraid that using this in a computer algebra system may lead to some false results.

The issue is rather that the spherical chart appears as well as the default one on the domain of stereographic coordinates:

```
sage: M = manifolds.Sphere(2)
sage: XN = M.stereographic_coordinates(pole='north')
sage: M.default_chart()  # output is OK, given the initialization of M
Chart (A, (theta, phi))
sage: XN.domain().default_chart()  # output is unexpected
Chart (A, (theta, phi))
```
One would rather expect `XN.domain().default_chart()` to be `XN`.

I find this default chart concept in case of non-parallelizable manifolds a bit cumbersome, anyways.

What if we replace `default_chart` by `default_charts`, and use dictionaries instead? That is, the keys are subsets and values are default charts on that domain.

No, not in general. Especially in the present case, where the spherical chart, `Xspher` says, does not cover `U = XN.domain()`, but only `A`, which is a strict subset of `U`. If `U` can be covered by a single chart, one would certainly expect that its default chart is such a covering chart. Moreover, in the current context, `U` is precisely defined as the domain of stereographic coordinates from the North pole (`XN`), so one certainly expects that its default chart is `XN`. That it is instead the chart of spherical coordinates happens only as an artifact of the order of creation of the open subsets and the spherical coordinate chart, in this part of `Sphere.__init__`:

```
self._init_chart_domains()   <- creates U, but not XN
self._init_embedding()
self._init_coordinates[coordinates](names)  <- creates Xspher and set it as the 
                                               default on all the preexisting 
                                               supersets of A, including U
```
If one creates a new open subset of `M`, it does not inherit of `Xspher` as a default chart:

```
sage: V = M.open_subset('V')
sage: V.default_chart() is None
True
```
which is fortunate, since `V` might not contain `A`. 

IMHO, the solution would be that `Sphere._init_stereographic` sets `XN` as the default chart on `U`, just after having created it. Similarly, `Sphere._init_spherical` should set `Xspher` as the default chart on `A`.

Here is an example of such false result. Suppose you define a scalar field the way you would like:

```
sage: M = manifolds.Sphere(2, coordinates='stereographic')
sage: XN.<y1, y2> = M.stereographic_coordinates(pole='north')
sage: XS.<yp1, yp2> = M.stereographic_coordinates(pole='south')
sage: H = M.scalar_field({XN: function('h')(y1, y2), 
....:                     XS: function('h')(yp1, yp2)}, name='H')
```
Then it will always take identical values at the North and South poles:

```
sage: NP = M((0,0), chart=XS)
sage: SP = M((0,0), chart=XN)
sage: bool(H(NP) == H(SP))
True
```
which is certainly not what you want for a generic scalar field on the sphere.
