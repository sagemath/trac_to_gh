The goal of this ticket is to implement conversion from q-expansion (with a given weight) to a graded modular form element and quasimodular form element. Examples:

```
sage: M = ModularFormsRing(1)
sage: P.<q> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: E4_qexp = 1 + 240*q + 2160*q^2 + O(q^3)
sage: M.qexp_to_graded_form(E4_qexp, 4)
1 + 240*q + 2160*q^2 + 6720*q^3 + 17520*q^4 + 30240*q^5 + O(q^6)
sage: M.qexp_to_graded_form(E4_qexp, 4) == M.0
True
```

and similarly for the class `QuasiModularForms` (see #31512).

This ticket is part of #31560
