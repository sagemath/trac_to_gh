It could be that builds in question actually took a prebuilt on another machine numpy, then it's a numpy bug, I guess, to install an incompatible binary.

Can you do a standalone build of scipy+numpy on that machine?
Or does it fail in the same way?

I can't easily mimic the Sage install. If I just unpack the zip file for `numpy` and run `python3 setup.py build -j 4 install --prefix $HOME/.local`, it complains about `blas` stuff:

```
RuntimeError: Found /usr/lib/libcblas.dylib, but that file is a symbolic link to the MacOS Accelerate framework, which is not supported by NumPy. You must configure the build to use a different optimized library, or disable the use of optimized BLAS and LAPACK by setting the environment variables NPY_BLAS_ORDER="" and NPY_LAPACK_ORDER="" before building NumPy.
```
I tried running Sage's `lapack_conf.py`, but it complained about not finding cblas. `numpy` installed after `export NPY_BLAS_ORDER=""` and `export NPY_LAPACK_ORDER=""`, but `scipy` did not.

So I don't understand how to build numpy+scipy on this machine.

Thanks for catching this. Actually you need to do it during a different command:

```
A cleaner solution and also a good solution for a branch might be to disable `-march=native` via

```
export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS_NON_NATIVE"
```
Numpy will still compile intrinsics to be dispatched on runtime. (And even if it isn't the case, the policy was that `-march=native` should only be enabled as long as this does not effect portability). Either way it appears to be a numpy bug, because it detects your architecture wrongly.

I hope one of those things work.

This doesn't work, unfortunately:

```

Can we build numpy using other of Sage's helpers which accept arguments?

You are exactly right. The previous place was the correct place to use it.

```
export NUMPY_FCONFIG="config_fc --noopt --noarch --cpu-baseline=\"sse2\""
```

However:

> The command arguments are available in build, build_clib, and build_ext. if build_clib or build_ext are not specified by the user, the arguments of build will be used instead, which also holds the default values.

So this does not work for `bdist_wheel` and this is what we use. Apparently, when build with wheel it just gets optimized regardless?

As Matthias Köppe pointed out you can do the following change:

```diff
diff --git a/build/pkgs/numpy/spkg-install.in b/build/pkgs/numpy/spkg-install.in
index 1237d059d3..ef2a322ecb 100644

-sdh_setup_bdist_wheel ${NUMPY_FCONFIG}
+sdh_setup_bdist_wheel build ${NUMPY_FCONFIG}
 
 sdh_store_and_pip_install_wheel .
```

Once you have done this, you can add all the previous options (added to `NUMPY_FCONFIG`):
- `cpu-baseline=min`,
- `cpu-dispatch`
- try again `export CFLAGS=CFLAGS_NON_NATIVE`.

Actually you can cancel the numpy built once it starts compiling to immediatly see the optimization options as in [comment:5](#comment:5)

By the way, where is `CFLAGS_NON_NATIVE` set? If I put `echo $CFLAGS` and `echo $CFLAGS_NON_NATIVE` in `spkg-install.in`, they both print the same thing:

```
-O2 -g -march=native

I'm not sure what "NON_NATIVE" means, but is it odd that it includes `-march=native`? If I explicitly do `export CFLAGS="-O2 -g"`, then `scipy` builds.

Do you have default `CFLAGS`? User settings take precedence over those. `CFLAGS_NON_NATIVE` means we don't add `-march=native`. That's what I figured is going on by the way.

If you don't have `CFLAGS` set by default than this is a bug.

The configured flags are in `sage/build/bin/sage-build-env-config`.

In `sage/build/bin/sage/sage-build-env` we set the flags.
Priorities are in this order:
1. Whatever is currently set.
2. During configuration.
3. Sage's default.

`CFLAGS_NON_NATIVE` only is meaningful for the third one. Otherwise you choice will be set everywhere regardless (some packages might add something).

I inserted more `echo` commands. `echo $CFLAGS_NON_NATIVE` returns `-O2 -g` when I print in `sage-spkg`, but it returns `-O2 -g -march=native` when this echo command is the first thing in numpy's `spkg-install.in` script. That is, my numpy log file looks like:

```
...
Package 'numpy' is currently not installed
Uninstalling 'numpy' with legacy uninstaller
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
PRINTED BY sage-spkg
cflags: -O2 -g -march=native
non-native: -O2 -g
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
PRINTED BY NUMPY's spkg-install.in
cflags: -O2 -g -march=native
non-native: -O2 -g -march=native
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
...
```
After the installation is complete, one more echo command in `sage-spkg` returns `-O2 -g` again.

---

The problem seems to be that we (in the full script `spkg-install`, created from `spkg-install.in`) also run the script `build/bin/sage-build-env`, and the line

```
    export CFLAGS_NON_NATIVE="$ORIGINAL_CFLAGS"
```
produces the wrong answer.

One question would be, since `sage-spkg` already has the lines

```
. sage-build-env-config
. sage-build-env
```
why does it also need to write this into `spkg-install`:

```
for lib in "\$SAGE_ROOT/build/bin/sage-dist-helpers" "\$SAGE_SRC/bin/sage-env-config" "\$SAGE_SRC/bin/sage-env" "\$SAGE_ROOT/build/bin/sage-build-env-config" "\$SAGE_ROOT/build/bin/sage-build-env"; do
    source "\$lib"
    if [ \$? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo >&2 "Error: failed to source \$lib"
        echo >&2 "Is \$SAGE_ROOT the correct SAGE_ROOT?"
        exit 1
    fi
done
```
Should we omit `sage-build-env-config` and `sage-build-env` from this list?
