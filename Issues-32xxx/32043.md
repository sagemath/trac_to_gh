Pretty sure also `doc-pdf-other` needs a prerequisite.

Any changes really need to be tested with a parallel build, for example use `export MAKE="make -j20"`

The website was not built because `ReferenceTopBuilder` had no chance to do its work.

Changes related with documentation of external packages were made to fix a link error in the reference top page and to make it read better (I think) for pdf files.
