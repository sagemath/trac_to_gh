CC:  @tscrim @egourgoulhon

(from #24176).

We define a class `ConditionSet` for subsets of elements given by a logical "and" of finitely many predicates.

If the given predicates (condition) are symbolic, a `ConditionSet` can be converted to a SymPy `ConditionSet`; the `_sympy_` method falls back to creating a `SageSet` wrapper otherwise.

As an application, we provide `Chart` and `RealChart` with a method `codomain`.

Note that this is duplicating some of the framework in `sage/combinat/combinat.py` with `FilteredCombinatorialClass`.

What do we want the intersection of two condition sets to be? Mainly, do we want the generic intersection? It could be another condition set object naturally, which would be more direct for operations such as containment check or iteration.
