(from #24176).

We define a class `ConditionSet` for subsets of elements given by a logical "and" of finitely many predicates.

If the given predicates (condition) are symbolic, a `ConditionSet` can be converted to a SymPy `ConditionSet`; the `_sympy_` method falls back to creating a `SageSet` wrapper otherwise.

As an application, we provide `Chart` and `RealChart` with a method `codomain`.

Why can't we do it on this ticket? It seems simple enough to check if `other` is a `ConditionSet`, and then just create a new such instance with the concatenation of the conditions.
