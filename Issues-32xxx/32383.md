(from #31911)

Our interfaces `sage.interfaces.maxima_abstract` and `maxima_lib` translate == and != to Maxima's = and #. But Maxima's documentation (https://maxima.sourceforge.io/docs/manual/maxima_169.html) is quite clear: `=` and `#`: syntactic (in)equality; `equal` and `notequal`: value (in)equality.

Example:

```
sage: getattr(maxima, "not")(x == 0)                                                                                     
true
```

There are already two places in sagelib that work around it (by using `equal`, `notequal`): `Expression._maxima_init_assume_` and `test_relation_maxima`. (see early tickets #1163, #2218)

We change 
- `InterfaceInit.relation` for maxima by subclassing
- `maxima_lib.sage_op_dict` to use `$EQUAL`, `$NOTEQUAL` instead of `MEQUAL`, `MNOTEQUAL`.
The two existing workarounds can then be removed.

However, in inputs to Maxima's `SOLVE`, `equal` and `notequal` are not allowed, and = and # have to be used. We introduce a method `_maxima_init_solve_` for this dialect.

<a id='comment:14'></a>Roundtripping with `max_to_sr` works

```
from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import max_to_sr 
sage: max_to_sr(maxima_calculus(x == 0).ecl())                                                                            
x == 0
```
but normal conversion via the expression parser does not:

```
sage: maxima_calculus(x == 0)._sage_()                                                                                    
equal(x, 0)
```
