`git grep -E '[.](symbolic|calculus|functions).*import'` reveals a number of calls to the symbolic calculus subsystem of Sage that can be avoided.

Examples:

- `ArikiKoikeAlgebra._BasesCategory.ParentMethods.dimension` uses `sage.functions.other.factorial` although it only needs `ZZ.factorial`

- Likewise, `sage.categories.finite_dimensional_lie_algebras_with_basis` uses symbolic `binomial` but only needs `ZZ.binomial`

- `ClassicalCrystals.ParentMethods.demazure_character` could be generalized to take a "variables" parameter so that users can obtain the result as an element of a polynomial ring instead of SR; or as a sympy expression

- Many more examples like this in `sage.combinat` whenever counting formulas or similar are produced


This is part of Meta-ticket #29705 (modularization) - to remove unnecessary dependencies on the distribution `sagemath-symbolics` (#31695)
