```
As discussed in #32973, the default value of `--warn-long` is roughly a minute, independent of the `--long` flag, and is only enabled when timing information from previous test runs is available. Our developers' guide suggests that even a "long time" test should complete in under five seconds:

https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/doctesting.html#optional-arguments

This ticket addresses two problems:

1. The timing information is often unavailable. We should still warn about long tests in that case.
2. The default of 60 CPU-equivalent seconds is much too high when `--long` is not in use.

Both of these issues stem from using the "wall time" to measure how long a test has run. Wall time is inherently unstable; if you're watching a movie, the tests will take longer. On a slower computer, the tests will take longer. Et cetera. The use of timing information from previous runs and the obscenely high `--warn-long` limit partially address that.

So in targeting our two issues, we first aim to switch the timing reports and `--warn-long` flag to use CPU time instead of wall time. CPU time is more reliable, since it only reports time actually spent working on the problem. (It's still sensitive to things like physical CPU time and `CFLAGS`; those will be addressed in #33022). With CPU time being used, the timings will be much more consistent, allowing us to lower the default value of `--warn-long` to 10 CPU-seconds when `--long` was not given.

The main difficulty is in accounting for CPU time spent in pexpect subprocesses. We don't `wait()` for those and they may not terminate, so the OS's usual methods of retrieving child process statistics don't work for them. At present we have a PID-based solution that works quickly on Linux/BSD, but something similar for macOS would be nice.

Volker, any idea why we used wall time for the limit rather than CPU time? It's making it a bit awkward to pick a multiplier when no timing information is available (which is usually the case for me).

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(GF(101), 'x', 8)

If you're referring to psutil, it's mainly a C package and consists of nothing BUT platform-specific code. The version we had was almost five years out of date and required a huge unmaintained patch that was rejected entirely by upstream. I'll take the ten lines we have now instead.

Worst case, we can get the information from the OSX kernel with a another five lines of code.

There's a point after which I agree, but assuming that the package itself causes zero problems: every distro needs to package it and keep it upgraded, and every user needs to install it every time they build sage (wasting time, space, and bandwidth), and every upstream release usually gets a ticket->branch->test->review cycle within sage itself.

The total amount of code we're talking about is less than the text files in `build/pkgs/psutil` contained. It's in a non-critical location in a pseudo-private, non-user-facing function. We'll go years without ever thinking about it.

I ran this on GH but the actions page has been failing to load for a week. I've reported it to GH and a fix is "being worked on." Aside from that, I think it's ready for review.

In the spirit of "do no harm," I have avoided outputting CPU time statistics wherever possible to avoid outputting confusing numbers on macOS. Nevertheless, in context, the lack of fast CPU time for subprocesses on macOS is not a deal-breaker: the only situation where it will be missed is if a subprocess takes a lot of CPU and would normally violate the `--warn-long` limit, and instead appears to run fast on macOS. But the status quo is that using wall time already makes `--warn-long` useless; and false negatives are not harmful. If the purpose of `--warn-long` is to prevent slow tests from being added to sage, then we only need `--warn-long` to trigger *somewhere* (e.g. the patchbots), and not *everywhere*. Overlooking the occasional warning for certain tests on one platform isn't contrary to that goal, and in any case is not worse than what we already have -- no usable warnings at all.

Of course I'll open a follow-up ticket for adding the macOS accounting should anyone care to do it.

In theory, it would be good to understand how pytest deals with such issues, as we are aiming to switch to pytest, right?

It uses wall time for its timeouts and slow test warnings.
