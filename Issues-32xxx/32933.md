Only when invoked as `SAGE_ROOT/sage` or `SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage`, then `$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin` should be put in the front of `PATH`.

When the installed `sage` script, `SAGE_VENV/bin/sage`, is invoked directly, it should not put `$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin` on the `PATH`.

As this is merged with #29865, we can set the status when we do so for #29865. Is this okay?
