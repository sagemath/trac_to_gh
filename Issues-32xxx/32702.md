This would package all of `sage.plot`. 

Plotting uses `RDF` a lot. Via #32677, #32701 we make it possible to use `RDF` without having to depend on GSL (non-pip-installable) and cypari2.

Via #32665, we remove dependencies on `sage.symbolic`. Other such dependencies such as

```
        from sage.symbolic.ring import SR
        # make sure both formatters typeset or both don't
        if not isinstance(tick_formatter, (list, tuple)):
            if tick_formatter == "latex" or tick_formatter in SR:
```
can also be easily rewritten.
