This is wrong:

```
sage: Q.<i,j,k> = QuaternionAlgebra(-1,-19)
sage: O = Q.quaternion_order([1,i,j,k])
sage: 1/5 in O
True
sage: (i+j)/123 in O
True
```

To fix this, we add an `_element_constructor_` to `QuaternionOrder`s that actually checks whether the given element is contained in the order. (This in turn makes the default implementation of `__contains__` work properly.)
