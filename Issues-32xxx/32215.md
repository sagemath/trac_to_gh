In #31933 conversion fails. In order to fix this properly, a refactor of the conversion process seems the best solution. This ticket does this (without fixing the open issue on #31933 which will be a follow up).

Depends on #32214

Here are some minor points that should be addressed: 

1. The new exceptions caused by ambiguously passing additional `growth` and `coefficient` keyword arguments should be tested.

2. Is there a particular reason for changing the implementation of `OTerm.can_absorb`?

3. The implementations of `TermWithCoefficientMonoid._convert_construction_` and `ExactTermMonoid._convert_construction_` are identical. I think the tests contained in the docstring of `ExactTermMonoid._convert_construction_` should be moved to `TermWithCoefficientMonoid._convert_construction_` and the separate implementation of `ExactTermMonoid._convert_construction_` should be removed.


Otherwise, the proposed changes look good to me. Here are the changes I've made in my reviewer commits:

- the `cached_method` import was unused and is now removed.

- The `EXAMPLES` block in some newly added methods used `TermMonoidFactory` to manually construct a factory, I've changed it to `from sage.rings.asymptotic.term_monoid import DefaultTermMonoidFactory as TermMonoid` (also see #32032).

- Language improvements for the error messages and the deprecation warning in `GenericTermMonoid._element_constructor`.

Tested now. Indeed there was code, that could have never been reached. I think we should have full coverage now.

This was the only place, where the `<=` of a term was used. However, I think it should be made clear what we compare here ("explicit is better than implicit"), so I switched to comparing the growth directly.

The reason for having `<=` (and method `le`) is for being compatible with SageMath's poset class in this perspective. If it wouldn't be for that, I would suggest to deprecate `<=` in the long run. However, as there is a reason for keeping it, I suggest to, at least, not use it further.

Another example of *spiritual deprecation*. +1.

Somwthing went wrong with the last push here, so I went back to the status of `u/dkrenn/refactor-element-construction-term-monoids` and redid the merge and fixed the doctests. There is still one doctest failing:


```

Failed example:

Yes, this should be resolved as well: it comes from https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/rings/asymptotic/term_monoid.py?id=683acc1eaa07fd3375bdd031516cfce30f1e363b#n4753, the coefficient should be passed via keyword argument.

I've managed to find the problem causing the `deprecation_number` plugin failure: looking at the implementation of the plugin over at https://github.com/sagemath/sage-patchbot/blob/745ec21b12f3bce03e8f1c8399cba0fb77bdc45c/sage_patchbot/plugins.py#L546, the plugin parses all *added* lines. If one of those contains `deprecation(` or `deprecated_function_alias(`, the code tries to parse the part following afterwards to find the ticket number, and then compares this parsed number to the actual ticket number.

The problem with our code is that we currently have

```diff
+            deprecation(
+                32215,
+                "Passing 'coefficient' as a positional argument is deprecated; "
+                "specify it as keyword argument 'coefficient=...'.")
```
in our diff, so the code fails to properly parse the deprecation number. Changing this addition in `term_monoid.py` to

```diff
+            deprecation(32215,
+                "Passing 'coefficient' as a positional argument is deprecated; "
+                "specify it as keyword argument 'coefficient=...'.")
```
will fix the failing test.
