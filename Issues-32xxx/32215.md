In #31933 conversion fails. In order to fix this properly, a refactor of the conversion process seems the best solution. This ticket does this (without fixing the open issue on #31933 which will be a follow up).

- Language improvements for the error messages and the deprecation warning in `GenericTermMonoid._element_constructor`.

Tested now. Indeed there was code, that could have never been reached. I think we should have full coverage now.

> 2. Is there a particular reason for changing the implementation of `OTerm.can_absorb`?


This was the only place, where the `<=` of a term was used. However, I think it should be made clear what we compare here ("explicit is better than implicit"), so I switched to comparing the growth directly.

The reason for having `<=` (and method `le`) is for being compatible with SageMath's poset class in this perspective. If it wouldn't be for that, I would suggest to deprecate `<=` in the long run. However, as there is a reason for keeping it, I suggest to, at least, not use it further.

I disagree here. Usually I am in strong favour of removeing code duplicities, however, `_convert_construction_` is the one crucial method that all different terms (or their monoids, to be precise) have that do the conversion and making this conversion as explicit as possible helps understanding what is going on. I find it more of an incidient that two different type of terms have the same conversion.

Another example of //spiritual deprecation//. +1.

Yes, this should be resolved as well: it comes from https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/rings/asymptotic/term_monoid.py?id=683acc1eaa07fd3375bdd031516cfce30f1e363b#n4753, the coefficient should be passed via keyword argument.

<a id='comment:33'></a>I've managed to find the problem causing the `deprecation_number` plugin failure: looking at the implementation of the plugin over at https://github.com/sagemath/sage-patchbot/blob/745ec21b12f3bce03e8f1c8399cba0fb77bdc45c/sage_patchbot/plugins.py#L546, the plugin parses all //added// lines. If one of those contains `deprecation(` or `deprecated_function_alias(`, the code tries to parse the part following afterwards to find the ticket number, and then compares this parsed number to the actual ticket number.

The problem with our code is that we currently have

```diff
+            deprecation(
+                32215,
+                "Passing 'coefficient' as a positional argument is deprecated; "
+                "specify it as keyword argument 'coefficient=...'.")
```
in our diff, so the code fails to properly parse the deprecation number. Changing this addition in `term_monoid.py` to

```diff
+            deprecation(32215,
+                "Passing 'coefficient' as a positional argument is deprecated; "
+                "specify it as keyword argument 'coefficient=...'.")
```
will fix the failing test.
