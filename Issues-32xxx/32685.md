Since the transition from jmol to threejs took place, Sage's 3D plots have axes labels, which can be controlled via the options `axes_labels` and `axes_labels_style`. However the helper function `sage.manifolds.utilities.set_axes_labels`, which was introduced as workaround to the lack of axes labels in jmol plots, has still some usefulness as shown in https://ask.sagemath.org/question/59324/axes-labels-in-3d-plots-not-showing/. Indeed the labels set by the threejs viewer are on the side opposite to the "natural" one. This can be restored with `set_axes_labels`. However, in the answer to the above ask.sagemath question, it was pointed that the label of the y axis is ill placed by `set_axes_labels` when using the threejs viewer (it was OK for jmol). Since threejs is now the default 3D viewer, this is corrected in this ticket.
