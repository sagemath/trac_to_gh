Following [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0644/ PEP 644](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0644/ PEP 644), python requires OpenSSL 1.1.1 or newer. This was planned to be included in Python 3.10, but apparently Python 3.9.7 (the version of our spkg after #32443) has already broken compatibility with some older openssl releases. For example `ubuntu-trusty` uses 1.0.1f.
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/3712854824?check_suite_focus=true

Also python's own configure script does not notice that this version of SSL does not work, but then building the `_ssl` extension fails:

```

```

We should update `build/pkgs/openssl/spkg-configure.m4` to detect that we have a suitable version. Currently there is no version check whatsoever.
