Follow-up from #29024. This time with testing on more than 1 platform.

On Debian 11 (a.k.a. bullseye, stable) Singular's libs have different names, and are failing to be picked up: they all are installed in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/` and we have the following: I add Sage's names next to their

```
Debian                             Sage

libsingular-factory.so             libfactory.so
libsingular-gfan.so                ???
libsingular-omalloc.so             libomalloc.so
libsingular-polys.so               libpolys.so
libsingular-resources.so           libsingular_resources.so
libsingular-Singular.so            libSingular.so            
```

While it's not hard to test for `libsingular-Singular.so` in place of `libSingular.so`, it's some more work to use it.

Library names may be obtained from `$ pkg-config --libs-only-l singular`, which on Debian produces

```
-lsingular-Singular -ldl -lsingular-polys -lntl -lgmp -ldl -lsingular-factory -lntl -lgmp -lsingular-omalloc -lsingular-resources
```

Great. `tox -e docker-ubuntu-jammy-standard -- config.status` now gives:

```
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG singular...
checking whether any of gmp ntl flint readline mpfr cddlib is installed as or will be installed as SPKG... no
checking for Singular... /usr/bin/Singular
checking for Singular >= 4.1.1... yes
checking if we can dlopen(/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libSingular.so)... no
configure: no suitable system package found for SPKG singular
```

So it makes sense now to work on the present ticket.

I actually checked that the branch allows using system Singular 4.1.1 on Debian 11, but then the result has test failures due to that `polylib.lib` absense.

this appears to be fixed by 

```
export SINGULAR_INFO_FILE=/usr/share/doc/singular/singular.hlp
```
before starting Sage. After this, instead of

```
sage: from sage.libs.singular.singular import get_resource
sage: get_resource('i')
// ** Could not get 'InfoFile'.
// ** Either set environment variable 'SINGULAR_INFO_FILE' to 'InfoFile',
// ** or make sure that 'InfoFile' is at "/usr/bin/../share/info/singular.hlp"
```
one gets, as it should be:

```
sage: from sage.libs.singular.singular import get_resource
sage: get_resource('i')
'/usr/share/doc/singular/singular.hlp'
```
The latter needs `singular-doc` installed, so it must be added to
`build/pkgs/singular/distros/debian.txt`.

Further inspection shows that the problem is in the official !Ubuntu/Jammy Docker image. Both official Ubuntu's and Debian 
`singular-doc_4.2.1-p3+ds-1_all.deb` files exhibit the same error (apt used dpkg to install files .deb files, and the same error shows up if installation is done by `dpkg -i singular-doc_4.2.1-p3+ds-1_all.deb`).

Could you check it's not only my Docker that plays up here? Steps to reproduce: 

* launch official Jammy image

* get shell prompt there

* run 

```
apt install singular-doc
dpkg -V singular-doc
```

The latter command should not output anything - but for me it outputs a log of missing files.



In !Debian/Bookworm image, which carries the same singular-doc version, everything is fine.

PS. It would be good to check on a non-Docker installation of Jammy, too.

Your branch is actually good (I was worried that images will get much bigger, but I haven't noticed this at all).
