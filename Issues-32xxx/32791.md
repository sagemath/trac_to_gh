```
At the moment the error-message when trying to create an elliptic curve from a formula that defines a singular curve is not particularly user-friendly:

```
sage: EllipticCurve(GF(7), [-2,0,0,0,0])
[...]
ArithmeticError: invariants (5, 0, 0, 0, 0) define a singular curve
```

This is trivially improvable by a one-line-fix with the tools that are already implemented (patch at the end) to give the following much more comprehensible error:

```
ArithmeticError: y^2 + 5*x*y = x^3 defines a singular curve
```

I wanted to create this as a pull-request, but github told me that they don't get accepted there and I couldn't figure out where to create one directly, so please just apply the following patch:

```
--- a/src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_generic.py
+++ b/src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_generic.py
@@ -145,7 +145,7 @@ class EllipticCurve_generic(WithEqualityById, plane_curve.ProjectivePlaneCurve):

         if self.discriminant() == 0:

While we don't support pull requests at github,
we support merge requests at gitlab.

- https://gitlab.com/sagemath/sage

Or someone can commit on your behalf and push
a branch here with your proposed change.

I think one can use `GIT_COMMIT_AUTHOR` for that.
