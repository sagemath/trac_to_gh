The macOS-10.15 environment is deprecated and will be unsupported on 2022-12-01. Homebrew packages are already not available any more.

- https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/main/images/macos/macos-10.15-Readme.md:

There's no macOS 13 environment yet.

Possible follow-up:
- Add variants that test with an actual XCode installation (not XCode CLT) because the SDK paths are different, and there may be other subtle differences. GH Actions install location: see https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/main/images/macos/macos-11-Readme.md#xcode
