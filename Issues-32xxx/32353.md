(related tickets #29101, #30302, #30239, #23436, #14681, #13811, #19813) by implementing parents with immutable elements, which exist side by side with their twin parents with mutable elements. 

The following table serves as a guide for the implementation:

|V=VectorSpace(R, 2, mutable=True)|new element  | W=VectorSpace(R, 2, mutable=False)| new element |
|:---------------------------------:|:-------------:|:-----------------------------------:|:-------------:|

| vector(R, 2)                     | O           |                                    |             |
| vector(R, [2,3])                 | O           | vector(R, [2,3], mutable=False)    | O           |

In the table, elements on the left belongs to V; elements on the right to W.

Most parents in Sage have immutable elements and hence don't accept `mutable` argument. Parents that accept `mutable` argument defaults to `mutable=True`.

Parents that accept `mutable` argument are: VectorSpace, MatrixSpace, FreeModule, Graph

Yes.

> The keyword on the constructor is to imply that `set_immutable()` is called on it. 

You are referring to `vector(R, [2,3], mutable=False)`? I think this first retrieves W and then construct an element of W. So this would be more efficient than `vector(R, [2,3]).immutable()`, which first constructs a vector in V and then convert it to an element of W. 

Here I am getting confused between switching immutability flag for a vector and changing its parent between V and W...

If you want, perhaps we can have both (method and function).

I don't think the proposal (up to now) included switching parents based on whether an element is immutable or not. The way I understand it, `V` can have elements that are mutable as well as elements that are immutable. That's the state of affairs now, and I don't think we'd want to change that without a good reason.

As far as I'm concerned, `W` can also have elements of either mutability state. However, elements in W would by default be immutable, and then they cannot change. However, `W._element_constructor([1,2,3],mutable=True)` could just return a mutable element. I think we're just trying to specify the behaviour of `W.element_constructor` if a `mutable` optional parameter is not given. In that case, the "default" setting should take effect, and that is where V and W and different.

I'm pretty sure we should not be changing the parent of `v` when executing `v.set_immutable()`.

So the returned vector is a mutable element of `W`? Then the last line of the chart is wrong. 

How about the third? How would `v+w` or `w+v` behave?

Yes, or an error, depending on whether "immutable_elt" parents still allow mutable elements as well. It would be strange to get an element with parent V if you just explicitly asked for an element with parent W. So I'd say the last line in the chart is indeed wrong.

What the parent of `vector(R, [2,3])` should be is really up for grabs. Perhaps indeed take as cue that whatever the "mutable" flag says should be the default on the parent (so that, say, a scalar multiple of the vector again has the property as prescribed)

> How about the third? How would `v+w` or `w+v` behave?

That's the stickiest. This is for the coercion system to decide. Ideally, there is a coercion arrow in only one direction (so: mutable coerces into immutable or vice versa, but not both). Then there is only one choice that the coercion system can come up with.

I feel that this mutable/immutable dual parents idea will not mix well with the current immutability flags for individual vectors.  

To work out the idea of this ticket, I would rather redefine `set_immutable()` as a method that changes the parent from V to W, and I would define a coercion map from W to V. I guess this may be implemented without serious performance penalty.

I am ok, actually prefer to live with one mutable vector space and just to have `vector.immutable()` to explicitly demand v set immutable.
