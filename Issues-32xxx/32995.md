As a follow-up to #32973 and #32981, there are a few other ways we could improve the `--warn-long` flag to keep our test suite speedy:

1. Add a flag like `-Werror` to the test runner, so that warnings are turned into errors that are reflected in the exit code. This will allow the CI to catch them. Another idea would be to have an `--error-long` flag that triggers errors instead of warnings at an ostensibly higher limit.
2. Summarize the `--warn-long` warnings at the end of the test run, so that they're all visible to the user without having to dig through a log file.
3. Add a separate option for warning about `# long time` tests. Currently when running with `--long`, you have to use a very long warning time, which then essentially hides the warnings for non-long tests that take too long.
