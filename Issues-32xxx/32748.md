```
We have tests to distinguish between networkx `Graph` and `MultiGraph` which are silently failing since for the following reason:

```
sage: H = networkx.MultiGraph()
sage: H.add_edge(0, 1)
0
sage: H.add_edge(0, 1)
1
sage: isinstance(H, networkx.MultiGraph)
True
sage: isinstance(H, networkx.Graph)
True
```
and so some code that should lead to an error is unreachable. In particular, the `DiGraph` constructor expect to call `data.selfloops` when data is a networkx `MultiDiGraph`, but the test is `is instance(data, networkx.DiGraph)` which is always true. Observe that method `selfloops` is no longer in networkx.

Here, we add a specific helper method to feed a (di)graph with data from a networkx (Multi)(Di)Graph. 

This will be useful for #9731.
