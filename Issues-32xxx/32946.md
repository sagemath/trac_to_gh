If I do `make doc-clean && make doc` and then for example `sage --docbuild tutorial html`, first it successfully builds the html tutorial, but then it fails because it tries to build the PDF documentation. I also don't know where it is building the PDF docs, because `local/share/docs/sage/latex` does not exist.

```

while `sage -docbuild reference/manifolds pdf` succeeds, as well as `make` in generating the html doc.
