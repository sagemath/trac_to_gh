We still have a doctest for `_get_shared_lib_path()` that ensures it can find libSingular. However,

1. the premise behind `_get_shared_lib_path()` does not make sense; you can't just guess where a library comes from
2. as a result of (1), it's failing to find libSingular in some cases; but thankfully
3. we no longer care if it can find libSingular, because the full path to libSingular is contained in `LIBSINGULAR_PATH`

Instead we should have it look for libgap, because gap is still installed from an SPKG, and we can ensure that it's installed in just the right way for `_get_shared_lib_path()` to find it. Moreover, we actually call the function with "gap" as an argument, so there's that.

Looks good to me. I took the patch for the sagemath package for void linux (wip) which uses system singular, and the failing doctest now passes.
