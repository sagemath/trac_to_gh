The goal of this ticket is like the ticket #32135: implement the methods `to_polynomial` and `from_polynomial` for the class `QuasiModularFormElement` (see #31560, #31512)

In particular, we want to be able to write a quasimodular form as a polynomial in terms of the generators of the graded algebra of quasimodular forms. Examples:

```
sage: QM = QuasiModularForms(1)
sage: f = QM.0 + QM.1
sage: f.to_polynomial()
E2 + E4
sage: P.<E2, E4, E6> = QQ[]
sage: g = QM.from_polynomial(E2 + E4); g
2 + 216*q + 2088*q^2 + 6624*q^3 + 17352*q^4 + 30096*q^5 + O(q^6)
sage: f == g
True
```

Concerning the `to_polynomial` method, I will rename it as you and Marc suggested. For now, I will also leave an alias `to_polynomial = polynomial`.

Again, thank you very much for taking the time to look at this.
