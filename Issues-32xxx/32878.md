The eval_twisted function in modsym.py in the pollack_stevens folder (in modular) contains a bug.

The code should read

```
        p = self.parent().prime()
        S0p = Sigma0(p)
        Dists = self.parent().coefficient_module()
        M = Dists.precision_cap()
        p = Dists.prime()
        twisted_dist = Dists.zero()
        m_map = self._map
        for b in range(1, abs(chi) + 1):
            if gcd(b, chi) == 1:
                M1 = S0p([1, (b / abs(chi)) % (p ** M), 0, 1])
                new_dist = m_map(M2Z([a*abs(chi)+p*b, 1, p*abs(chi), 0])) * M1
                new_dist = new_dist.scale(kronecker(chi, b)).normalize()
                twisted_dist += new_dist
        return twisted_dist.normalize()
```
or similar, but the line after M1 = ...

```
new_dist = m_map(M2Z([a*abs(chi)+p*b, 1, p*abs(chi), 0])) * M1
```
is currently wrong. Right now it reads

```
new_dist = m_map(M1 * M2Z([a, 1, p, 0])) * M1
```
I discussed this error with Rob Pollack when I noticed some inconsistencies with the quadratic twists of p-adic L functions and checked it against values given by code in his repo <https://github.com/rpollack9974/OMS> Rob explained to me that the code in sage is reducing the matrix entries of M1 mod p<sup>M</sup>, which is not allowed. (This is okay for the action of M1 on distribution because everything is stored there at most mod p<sup>M</sup>.  But the former action of M1 on divisors needs to be kept track of at the level of rational numbers.)

Thanks. I'm not entirely sure how this works, but the following code currently returns zero, but with the new code returns a nonzero value (below)



```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a1')
sage: L = E.padic_lseries(3, implementation="pollackstevens", precision=4)
sage: D = 5
sage: L.symbol().evaluate_twisted(1,D)
(2 + 3 + 2*3^2 + O(3^4), 2 + 3 + O(3^3), 2 + 3 + O(3^2), 2 + O(3))
```

Does this work?
