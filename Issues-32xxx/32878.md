The eval_twisted function in modsym.py in the pollack_stevens folder (in modular) contains a bug.

The code should read

```
        p = self.parent().prime()
        S0p = Sigma0(p)
        Dists = self.parent().coefficient_module()
        M = Dists.precision_cap()
        p = Dists.prime()
        twisted_dist = Dists.zero()
        m_map = self._map
        for b in range(1, abs(chi) + 1):
            if gcd(b, chi) == 1:
                M1 = S0p([1, (b / abs(chi)) % (p ** M), 0, 1])
                new_dist = m_map(M2Z([a*abs(chi)+p*b, 1, p*abs(chi), 0])) * M1
                new_dist = new_dist.scale(kronecker(chi, b)).normalize()
                twisted_dist += new_dist
        return twisted_dist.normalize()
```
or similar, but the line after M1 = ...

```
new_dist = m_map(M2Z([a*abs(chi)+p*b, 1, p*abs(chi), 0])) * M1
```
is currently wrong. Right now it reads

```
new_dist = m_map(M1 * M2Z([a, 1, p, 0])) * M1
```
I discussed this error with Rob Pollack when I noticed some inconsistencies with the quadratic twists of p-adic L functions and checked it against values given by code in his repo <https://github.com/rpollack9974/OMS> Rob explained to me that the code in sage is reducing the matrix entries of M1 mod p<sup>M</sup>, which is not allowed. (This is okay for the action of M1 on distribution because everything is stored there at most mod p<sup>M</sup>.  But the former action of M1 on divisors needs to be kept track of at the level of rational numbers.)

<a id='comment:2'></a>Thanks. I'm not entirely sure how this works, but the following code currently returns zero, but with the new code returns a nonzero value (below)



```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a1')
sage: L = E.padic_lseries(3, implementation="pollackstevens", precision=4)
sage: D = 5
sage: L.symbol().evaluate_twisted(1,D)
(2 + 3 + 2*3^2 + O(3^4), 2 + 3 + O(3^3), 2 + 3 + O(3^2), 2 + O(3))
```

Does this work?
