We remove a custom patch in the setuptools SPKG, `build/pkgs/setuptools/patches/easy_install_lock.patch`. This is unused, as easy_install has been replaced by pip in all uses by the Sage build system.

<a id='comment:11'></a>`src/sage/misc/dev_tools.py` still makes a reference to `easy_install`.

Other than that, there is no direct use of `easy_install`; that includes the optional/experimental packages.

As I said in comment:1, the code path with `easy_install` could still be triggered by `setup_requires` of a package. However, for normal packages (= packages with `checksums.ini`), this cannot actually install a package from the net because we poison the http* proxy. No install, so no locking needed.

So only "script" or "pip" packages would need to be checked whether any of these use `setup_requires`
