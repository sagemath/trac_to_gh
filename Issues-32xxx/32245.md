```
On sage 9.3, the following code unexpectedly prints `False`:

```
Q.<i,j,k> = QuaternionAlgebra(-1,-19)
I = Q.maximal_order().unit_ideal()
print(I.scale(1) == I)
```
(This behaviour was discovered by Jana Sotáková.)

Cause: The `.scale()` method for `QuaternionFractionalIdeal_rational` passes the set of generators of the scaled ideal to the parent algebra's `.ideal()` method as a `list`, whereas other code seems to assume that the basis is stored as a `tuple`. In particular, the `__eq__` method for `QuaternionFractionalIdeal_rational` simply compares the `__basis` members, and since a list is never equal to a tuple, the equality tested in the snippet above fails even though scaling an ideal by 1 clearly shouldn't change anything.

Fix: Compare HNF bases everywhere (see the discussion below).

I think converting the argument to a tuple inside either the `__init__()` method (as you suggest) or the `ideal()` method is a more robust solution.  The `ideal()` method can be called directly by users and we shouldn't force them to insert `tuple()` by hand to avoid running into this problem.

Thanks for the fast response! I added an explicit cast to `tuple` in the constructors for both quaternion orders and quaternion ideals.

After my previous commit, ideals in different quaternion algebras with the same HNF basis matrices incorrectly compared equal.  The above commit fixes `__eq__()` so that it also compares the ambient quaternion algebras, not just the HNF basis matrices.
