Keywords: quaternion ideals

On sage 9.3, the following code unexpectedly prints `False`:

```
Q.<i,j,k> = QuaternionAlgebra(-1,-19)
I = Q.maximal_order().unit_ideal()
print(I.scale(1) == I)
```
(This behaviour was discovered by Jana Sotáková.)

Cause: The `.scale()` method for `QuaternionFractionalIdeal_rational` passes the set of generators of the scaled ideal to the parent algebra's `.ideal()` method as a `list`, whereas other code seems to assume that the basis is stored as a `tuple`. In particular, the `__eq__` method for `QuaternionFractionalIdeal_rational` simply compares the `__basis` members, and since a list is never equal to a tuple, the equality tested in the snippet above fails even though scaling an ideal by 1 clearly shouldn't change anything.

Fix: Compare HNF bases everywhere (see the discussion below).

I think converting the argument to a tuple inside either the `__init__()` method (as you suggest) or the `ideal()` method is a more robust solution.  The `ideal()` method can be called directly by users and we shouldn't force them to insert `tuple()` by hand to avoid running into this problem.

Done.

However, here's another bug that's somewhat related: `I.scale(-1)` is also not equal to `I` because `__eq__` compares bases, but `.scale()` simply multiplies each basis element by `-1`. I think we should just be comparing the `.basis_matrix()` members in `__eq__` as they are guaranteed to be in HNF. They are cached as well, so the performance impact should be negligible.

Similarly, quaternion *orders* also only compare bases in `__eq__`, which in that case is documented, but probably not the expected behaviour for most users. I suggest changing that to an actual lattice equality test as well.
