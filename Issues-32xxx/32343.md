This ticket implements the Serre derivative for modular forms. This derivative is defined by:

*theta(f) = (q * d/dq - (k/12) * E_2)(f) = (q * df/dq - (k/12) f E_2)*

where f is a modular form of weight *k* (see also: https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01883058/document page 29, section 3.10), *q* is the classical parameter at infinity and *E_2* is the weight 2 Eisenstein series. This derivative is known to preserve the modularity and simply raise the weight of *f* by 2.

Note that this feature is implemented in PARI/GP under the name *mfderivE2*.

This ticket is part of #31560

Here you have two sentences : separate the second one "If bla bla" from the first one by an empty line.
