This new module will provide abstract base classes for the purpose of `isinstance` and `issubclass` testing.  This helps with modularization (#32432).

In this ticket, we add `RealField`, `RealDoubleField`, `ComplexField`, `ComplexDoubleField`, which are in 1:1 correspondence to the implementation classes `RealField_class`, `RealDoubleField_class`, `ComplexField_class`, `ComplexDoubleField_class`.

To illustrate the use of these classes, we convert some uses of `is_...` functions to `isinstance` with the new base classes.

In #32414 I now explain that this is expressly not done in order to create a new hierarchy according to mathematical properties.

It's really just to make sure that code can test whether an object belongs to a class even if the implementation of that class (the unique direct subclass of the abc) is not installed.

So this is playing the role of a header file does in C? It is just a placeholder effectively saying "we will define this somewhere"?

What classes will we have to do this to? All of them? If so, I feels a bit clunky to maintain this manually. Could we do something so that this is automated? Should we try a different mechanism, such as a variation of `lazy_import` to replace the `from foo import Bar` for an `isinstance(X, Bar)` checks (equivalently an `is_Bar` function)?

It's a way to think about it, yes. But it's a placeholder for one specific purpose: `isinstance` (or `issubclass` testing) from code in a module "far away" from the implementation of the class.

Here's a typical example. `sage.groups.affine_groups.group_element.__call__` implements polymorphic behavior and imports `is_Polyhedron` because it wants to implement a specific way how to act on a polyhedron. Sometimes code of this kind can, of course, be seen as a workaround for API defects, or a need for further abstraction.

Anyway, in the proposed approach, we would change `is_Polyhedron(v)` to an import from `sage.geometry.abc` and use `isinstance(v, sage.geometry.abc.Polyhedron)`.

So the proposed solution gives a way of enabling modularization (and reducing load times!) with minimal changes to the call site.

> What classes will we have to do this to? All of them?


Absolutely not. Just those that appear in this kind of code.

> Should we try a different mechanism, such as a variation of `lazy_import` to replace the `from foo import Bar` for an `isinstance(X, Bar)` checks (equivalently an `is_Bar` function)?


Reintroducing `is_Bar` functions runs counter to an effort eliminating them that has been ongoing since the early days of Sage (see #32414). Besides, also such `is_Bar` functions would need to be in a new, separate module that does not fail when it cannot import in the implementation module -- so try...except.

A variation of `lazy_import` is certainly something that could be explored as an alternative. We did something like this in #32455 for `isinstance(..., cypari2.gen.Gen)`. But this is starting to look like piling on more workarounds like the ones that some modules do to break import cycles.

Okay, thank you for the explanation. I am still slightly worried about scalability and maintenance cost, but we likely have to put it into practice in order to see if it doesn't work.

I feel like this kind of pattern (calling something from "far away") is somewhat common, although I guess there aren't too many things that appear in other subfolders that it applies to. So perhaps it will not be so necessary. Although it might confuse some developers when they have to do this extra step if, say, they need a new algebra to compute something in the combinatorics folder.

I am not suggesting we reintroduce them as I think we should just have more fundamental checks (when possible).

We are surely fighting that cython does not have preprocessor instructions. Would be really nice to have something like

```
try:
    from sage.rings.complex_double cimport ComplexDoubleField_class
except:
    ComplexDoubleField_class = None
```

Edit: Actually the above won't ever work, because it boils down to an optional build-dependency. The problem is that modularization will have the consequence that the above decision cannot be made at build-time.
