```
Since #32186, we use `Combinations` in `RandomBoundedToleranceGraph` and the method is rather slow

```
sage: %timeit g = graphs.RandomBoundedToleranceGraph(8)
17.9 s ± 449 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```
Here we avoid the use of `Combinations` and we get a much faster generator

```
sage: %timeit g = graphs.RandomBoundedToleranceGraph(8)
102 µs ± 2.38 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
```

While I agree with the need to change this, I don't agree with the implementation.

However, I don't really understand tolerance graphs and what kind of values give you interesting tolerance graphs.

With this little knowledge that I have, your implementation seems very strange distributed. Half of the intervals start on the right half. I think it should be much less.

So I propose the following changes:

```diff
     tolrep = []
     for _ in range(n):
-        l = randint(0, W - 1)
+        l = randint(0, W)
-        r = randint(l + 1, W)
+        r = randint(0, W - 1)
+        if r >= l:
+            l, r = r + 1, l
         tolrep.append((l, r, randint(1, r - l)))
```

The obtained random intervals will be symmtric. It is equivalent to

```
    tolrep = []
    for _ in range(n):
        l = randint(0, W)
        r = l
        while r == l:
            r = randint(0, W)
        ...
```
but much nicer as it avoids the loop.

The timings of `Combinations(W, 2).random_element()` are absolutely awful. I wasn't aware of this. The complexity appears to grow quadratic to `W` (and only about twice as fast as picking a random element from `itertools.combinations(range(W), 2)`). `Combinations` considers a multi-set though, which is a much more complex problem.

See also #32584, which improves `Combinations(n, k).random_element()` and gives the following timings:

```
sage: %timeit g = graphs.RandomBoundedToleranceGraph(8)
85.3 ms ± 3.78 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```

Not even close to the new timings, but the intervals uniformly distributed (from the set of all intervals). I don't know if this is desirable or not.

Edit: Well both distributions are the same. One problem is that `random_element` of `Combinations` is linear in the length of the list. Kind of nice, but not when obtaining combinations `Combinations(16000, 10)` or similar.

I slightly changes the values since we want 0 <= l < r <= W.

We could also try with a single `randint` in range `[1, W*(W-1)/2]` and then retrieve l and r, but I'm not sure it's really better.

I guess I could open a new ticket and implement the following:

```
def random_combination(a, b, k):
    """
    Return a list of ``k`` distinct sorted random integers ``i`` with ``a <= i <= b``.
    """
    l = [randint(a, b - i) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k):
        for j in range(i):
            if l[i] >= l[j]:
                l[i] += 1
    return sorted(l)
```

Then `Combinations_setk` could make use of this, if `k` is small relative to `n` (the above function is quadratic in `k`, which `Combinations(n,k).random_element()` appears to be linear in `n`.

The improvement is good as it is. As I noted later, this is uniformly distributed, as what we are doing is equivalent to the following:

1. Pick `l`, `r` in with `randint(0, W)`.
2. Restart if `l == r`.
3. Sort `l` and `r.

I don't understand the relationship between combinations and the method you propose in #comment:8. Furthermore, I can get

```
sage: random_combination(2, 6, 5)
[2, 3, 3, 5, 5]
```

At least, we have improved method `RandomBoundedToleranceGraph`.

Yes, indeed this doesn't work.
This is the correct code:

```
sage: def random_combination(a, b, k):
....:     l = [randint(a, b - i) for i in range(k)]
....:     for i in range(k):
....:         for j in range(i):
....:             if l[i] >= l[j]:
....:                 l[i] += 1
....:         l[:i+1] = sorted(l[:i+1])
....:     return l
```

This is exactly what we do for the case `k=2`: `random_combination(0, W(n), 2)`.
