I must say I don't quite know what exactly pypi package name is, and whether anything beyond changes in MANIFEST.in and setup.py is needed.
Can the module name still be the same, `primecount` ?

We'd call it `pyprimecount` instead.

OK, thanks. Another thing I don't understand is how the C++ library prinecount is meant to be provided. It's not something too standard to assume it's just installed.

 Does it mean to be a non-python dependency of Sage? Or of (py)prinecount?

When `pyprimecount` is installed from a source distribution, it will just assume that the necessary library is available. Python packages do not have a way to declare non-Python dependencies.

Later one may consider to build wheels that include a copy of the shared library.
This is what for example `numpy` does regarding BLAS: The source distribution certainly does not contain a copy of BLAS, but the wheels ship with a copy of the OpenBLAS shared library.
