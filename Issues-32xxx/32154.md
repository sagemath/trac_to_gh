In SageMath 9.4.beta3, the rank of `B` changes from 0 to 3 in the following example:

```
sage: M = ModularSymbols(Gamma0(4), 4)
sage: B = M.boundary_space
sage: B.rank()
0
sage: M.boundary_map()
Hecke module morphism boundary map defined by the matrix
[-1  0  0]
[ 0 -1  0]
[ 0  0 -1]
Domain: Modular Symbols space of dimension 3 for Gamma_0(4) of weight ...
Codomain: Space of Boundary Modular Symbols for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(4) ...
sage: B.rank()
3
```

There is actually a warning about this in the docstring of the `rank()` method:

```
        .. warning::

           This number may change as more elements are coerced into
           this space!! (This is an implementation detail that will
