underscore should be used as a variable loop only iff its value is not used

otherwise, one should use a normal variable

Code golf! These list-of-empty-list loops can all be sped up a little if you avoid creating the (unused) int objects:

```
sage: %timeit [[] for _ in range(1000)]
206 µs ± 11.8 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
sage: %timeit [[] for _ in repeat(None,1000)]
163 µs ± 13.7 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
```

The numbers vary, but the `itertools.repeat` version is always better.

I think you missed a few range->repeat conversions in `tableau_tuple.py`? It's not a big deal to me but it looks like you tried to change all of the others.

For another small optimization, I see you touched a few lines of the form `prod([iterator])`. Those can be sped up by removing the intermediate list, since `prod()` is happy to use the iterator. For example:

```
sage: %timeit prod(ZZ(i) for i in range(1,10000))

You can set it to positive review on my behalf when either you make those changes or you choose not to. They're minor.

I'm not a huge fan of using the underscore for unused variables (it makes the line harder to read in your head), but it's a well-known python convention, and PEP 640 to provide an explicit alternative was rejected. I think it's fine to do now and then later (if anyone cares) decide whether or not we want to adopt or outlaw the convention within sage.
