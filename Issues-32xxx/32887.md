Unless something has changed, we do not want it on CTAN, because that will not match versions with Sage.  Dan always made sure that the versions matched (indeed, I think this is in the release instructions for SageTeX?) and so one has to manually move the .sty file, or did have to do.

The package's Python code (apart from setup.py) is generated by TeX from a .dtx file.
Anyhow, I tried  uploading its Makefile-created tarball (one used by Sage) anf got

```
$ twine upload  dist/*
Uploading distributions to https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
Uploading sagetex-3.6.tar.gz

HTTPError: 400 Bad Request from https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
The name 'sagetex' isn't allowed. See https://pypi.org/help/#project-name for more information.
```

Perhaps some metadata is missing, I don't know. There is no sagetex project on PyPI as far as I can tell.

Let's get this in as is, and deal with a better distribution mechanism later.

As far as I can see, it imports nothing from the Sage library and only runs whatever `sage` can be found on PATH (or what is provided using the ``--sage`` option).

> With both the old and the new versions of `sagetex`, `./sage -f -c sagetex` fails the testsuite. Log uploaded.

You are running a development version of TeX:

```
pdfTeX 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.23 (TeX Live 2022/dev)
...
LaTeX2e <2021-11-15>
L3 programming layer <2021-11-12>
(/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/article.cls
...
```

I can't reproduce your error (which is probably about broken/improved(?) TeXLive `xcolor` package):

```
[11] (/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/tex/latex/listings/lstlang1.sty)
(./sagetex.sagetex.scmd
consecutive:

! Package xcolor Error: Undefined color `dbluecolor'.

See the xcolor package documentation for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...                                              
```

I'm running a 2020/21 stable version, and where you got your error I see warnings like

```
Package xcolor Warning: Incompatible color definition on input line 3.
...
```

These color definitions there are very old, from 2010 or so.

Perhaps something has changed in xcolor. I'll get back to this tomorrow...

the color warning vs error in [comment:29](#comment%3A29) comes from `xcolor` (the warning, for sure). `xcolor` manual says:

```
Note that whenever a color is used that has been defined via color’s \definecolor
command rather than xcolor’s new \definecolor and friends, a warning message
‘Incompatible color definition’ will be issued.
```
As `tikz` loads `xcolor` anyway, perhaps we should just use it.

The following patch to sagetex removes the warning for me (checked with the current xcolor version 2021/10/31, as well as the previous one, from 2016).

John, does it fix the error on your development TeXLive machine?

So I would suggest to refocus sagetex as a TeX package and consider CTAN and texlive as the main distribution strategy. Python is merely used as a scripting language.\n\nThe section https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/sagetex.html#using-sagetex should just be moved to the sagetex README.\n\nI would think that `sagetex` works with any version of Sage released in the past 5 years at least.

That `build/pkgs/sagetex/install-requires.txt` exists (which triggers installation in `SAGE_VENV` instead of `SAGE_LOCAL`) is a mistake introduced in #30719. `sagetex` does not exist on PyPI, so the contents of `install-requires.txt` are wrong.

Overall, I'm skeptical about treating sagetex as a Python package.
As the instructions in https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/sagetex.html#using-sagetex show, after installing it with pip (or Sage package), still manual installation work is needed for the TeX style files. So I would suggest to refocus sagetex as a TeX package and consider CTAN and texlive as the main distribution strategy. Python is merely used as a scripting language.

The section https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/sagetex.html#using-sagetex should just be moved to the sagetex README.

I would think that `sagetex` works with any version of Sage released in the past 5 years at least. This compatibility should probably be documented in sagetex.

Is it a metadata error, or indeed somehow the name is "reserved"?

If SageTeX (ctan package) is installed and has right version (assuming we drop the version check)
then no manual action is needed.

Else, one needs to `export TEXINPUTS="SAGE_ROOT/venv/share/texmf//:$TEXINPUTS"`
which is obviously scriptable.

Alas. When you run pdflatex on your latex document, no computation is done. Instead it outputs a `.sage` file, and you have to stop what you're doing, run the `.sage` file (with sage), and then go back and re-run pdflatex some more.

The first few lines of that `.sage` file are...


```python
## -*- encoding: utf-8 -*-
## This file (my.sagetex.sage) was *autogenerated* from my.tex with sagetex.sty version 2020/08/12 v3.5.
import sagetex
```

So, the "latex package" actually requires some special python bits to be installed and visible to sage. That's why it's probably better to have this be a python package that installs some latex bits rather than a latex package that installs some python bits.

1) If we use `make`, which is OK for building from source, but not so for modularisation, then there is no pressing need to work on #32992 

2) if we use `ninja`, then it's more work, but we get a more modular setup, as `ninja` is a Python package, and can be listed as a dependency in a Pythonic way - then we need #32992 (which would make `ninja` a proper Python package, and promote it to `standard`).

No. It is a Python package all right nowadays. In my updated `setup.py` I do

```
...
import ninja

class pre_develop(develop):
    """Pre-installation for development mode."""
    def run(self):
        ninja.subprocess.run(['ninja'],check=True)
        develop.run(self)
...
```
and I have `pyproject.toml` that says

```
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools", "wheel", "ninja"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```

The pre-built "ninja" executable is zipped into the whl as `data/bin/ninja`. That python module is a small wrapper to make that executable runnable without knowing where it was installed to.

Since sagetex can't be used without sage, and since sage and POSIX both require Make, I think Make is the better option.  Neither Make nor ninja can truly be installed with pip, and Make should already be there.

So what, are you surprised? It's most probably exactly how is should be down in that gehakte tsores (aka Python wheels) format.

It might be instructive to look at ninja package source. It has a cmake file, used by
a Python package `scikit-build`: https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html, which lets you in run `cmake` from `setup.py`.
As you can see in `pyproject.toml`    

```
[build-system]
requires = [
    "setuptools>=42",
    "wheel",
    "scikit-build>=0.12",
]...
```

`Make`, I don't know. But `ninja` - yes, it can. Even on, yes, Windows :-)

In a modular world, with Sage installed from wheels, it's not inconsievable to have no Make around. But yes, ninja is there. 

Anyhow, updating our ninja to be able to do this will need `scikit-build` as a dependency, and to speed up this ticket let's stick to `make` for the time being.

I think extracting the .py files should simply be done by developers, perhaps in a "./bootstrap" script before "setup.py sdist" is run.

Regardless of the build system that you use to script it, in the end the `.dtx` is extracted by a run of `latex`. Requiring a user to have an installation of `latex` just to install the `sagetex` python scripts does not seem to be a good idea.

Does this work? I guess not. Anyhow, installing LaTeX on a server is trivial.

Anyway, the work is done already, was just asking in what way I should change 2 or 3  lines, to use either `make`, or `ninja`.
I don't want to throw all this away and do a refactoring because you find the prsent design "complex". It is not complex in a true sense of this word.

At least ideally, one can do the LaTeX on a separate machine from the Sage commands.  That is definitely within Dan's intended vision for SageTeX.  In practice, I think most people who have used SageTeX have ended up just installing whichever one they didn't have (which varied) on their local computer, but we have occasionally had requests for software-as-service for something along these lines, and being able to run Sage on the LaTeX-generated files on a server elsewhere from one's local computer (esp. if someone had trouble installing Sage, which has been known to happen ...) would be useful.  Having Overleaf able to call a Sage server sound cool, though i don't know if they (the OL people) would see that as a high priority ;-)

For what it's worth, similar packages in R are R packages, not TeX packages, I believe.  However, this debate has some other technical details that might override that utility in practice (e.g. `make` versus `ninja` or Python package versus TeX package).

I do think that it is key for SageTeX to be "easily accessible" to anyone using Sage, and so I would disagree with this:

> The section ​https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/sagetex.html#using-sagetex should just be moved to the sagetex README.

Those instructions are easily web-discoverable, and we've certainly had plenty of questions over time asking about that process (and persevering through several false starts).  Most Sage users, especially those using it as a service in some other environment, are just downloading/using a binary and will not necessarily even know about README files; moving the style files might be the only interaction they have with the Sage file tree.

I am not sure I understand this comment. Doing

Regarding `install` and `develop`, removing them results in some scripts
no being built, for some reason (maybe due to them not being treated in pythonic way, but just via makefile rules).

I tried few things, to no avail.
Please do a PR against https://github.com/sagemath/sagetex/tree/ninja-dev
if you have a clear picture of how to fix this.

Sorry, I won't work on this - the approach of requiring tooling such as `latex` (plus some build system) to be present in order to install a Python package is a dead end.

My build process generates a wheel for the package, which, of course, contains .py files,
and the generated scripts. It can be used for installation,
if there is no LaTeX (or otherwise).

It doesn't contain pdf files, but that's fine IMHO.

-1. This would make `sagetex` the only Python package in the Sage distribution that cannot be installed from the sdist.

The source installation of this package needs LaTeX, sdist or not.
Something **has** to give. Here are the alternatives I see:

1) keep a hacky tarball package with pdfs and all, that cannot be installed from source in a meaningful way, and would never ever make it to PyPI in that form. 

2) do not install it if there is no LaTeX available.

3) install it from wheel.

4) install it from wheel only if there is no LaTeX available.

We are installing all Python packages from the sdist. That's what sdists are for.

> E.g. they may be using autotools, so on a machine without autotools one won't be able to install them your supposedly canonical way.

Dima, as you know, autotools-based packages do NOT need autotools at the time of installation. Developers need it at the time of preparing a source distribution.

No, not all of them. See e.g. beautifulsoap4:

```
make[1]: Entering directory '/home/dimpase/work/sage/build/make'
make --no-print-directory beautifulsoup4-no-deps
sage-logger -p 'sage --pip install -r "/home/dimpase/work/sage/build/pkgs/beautifulsoup4/requirements.txt"' '/home/dimpase/work/sage/logs/pkgs/beautifulsoup4.log'

It's not a sdist build, it's a direct installation from wheels, right?

The problem in this ticket is that Dima is confused about what a "source distribution" (sdist) is and insists that it MUST NOT contain "generated files".
But this is a principle that is unknown to actual Python packaging practice. What goes into an sdist is determined by its purpose -- namely installability.

The `.sty` files etc. are "generated files" -- LaTeX is needed to extract them from the `.dtx` file, the actual source. In Dima's scheme, this makes the installation of the package dependent on LaTeX being installed. This is bad because it stops people from using the Python part of the package on a system that does not have LaTeX, which is a documented use case of sagetex.

What Dima is missing is that there is an actual build phase for building a source distribution. The product of it is the sdist tarball, which one then deposits on PyPI. The very purpose of this build phase is to include files in the source distribution that do not appear in this form in the git repository etc.

First things first : I agree that it is easier to maintain a complex set of files if one can derive allof them from a set of sources as small as possible. I sympathize wit the idea of deriving both Python and LaTeX files from the same set of files.

`Sagetex`is both a Python package and a LaTeX package, and neither. As a sick  [centaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur), who has to consult with both a physician and a veterinarian (unless he is [Χείρων](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiron), himself physician...), we must attack both sides of the problem. 

As far as I understand it, we have three distribution targets :

- The Sage source tree,
- CTAN,
- PyPI.

The **Sage source tree** should be unproblematic.

**CTAN** should also be unproblematic, since it does not insist on a `.dtx` format for the source code it distributes. For example, [PythonTeX](https://github.com/gpoore/pythontex) : if the `sagetex.sty` package itself *has* such a `.dtx`source, the associated python scripts have not : from the LaTeX point of niew, they are pure data.

The problem is therefore what can be accepted by **PyPI**. As far as I can tell, We can submit a package including :
- all our LaTeX and Python files,
- a `setup.py` file sufficient to install these files (problem : how to detect the target directories for `sagetex.py` ?),
- a `README.md` file insisting on the fact that directly modifying these files is a Bad Idea(TM), and pointing to
- a `HACKING.md` file 
  * explaining (mostly by pointers to the relevant documentation) what is a `dtx` is and how to exploit it, and
  * explaining the dependencies and respective roles of `Makefile`, `sagetex.ins` and `sagetex.dtx`, all contained in  
- a `sagetex-source.tar.gz` archive.

The `HACKING.md` should insist that only the contributions (patches) to `sagetex.ins`, `sagetex.dtx` and `Makefile` will be considered for inclusion.

FWIW : The current `sagetex` tree, with self-compiled source, docimentatin and example (with Tikz graphs) weights in at 4.5 Mbytes, down to 2 MB in `.tar.gz` format. This shouldn't be problematic nowadays...

Unless I'm missing some PyPI submission rule, this should be sufficient to fulfill our constraints :
- no install dependencies,
- no building before installing,
- cleanly modifiable,
- reasonable size.

As for `ninja` vs `make` :

- I have no opinion on their respective values ;
- I know for a fact that building Sage depends on `make` (therefore all Sage builder (are supposed to) know how to use `make`).

If building Sage depends on `ninja` in any way, a decision would depend of their respective values, a point I won't discuss. If this would be the forst case of mandatory `ninja` use in Sage, I will vote for `make` : not force-introducing Yet Another building tool would be a Good Thing (C)(R).

Can we avoid opening yet anorher Religious War(TM) ?

My two €/100...

What am I missing ?

There are two things that are called `ninja`. 
We already have in Sage the package that provides the `ninja` executable, see `build/pkgs/ninja_build`. It was needed for building an optional package, but we just recently made it a standard package because it is needed by the next SciPy upgrade (#34081).

But there is also a Python distribution package called `ninja`, which provides the executable and a Python module `ninja`.
We do not have this in Sage, and it is not needed for anything.

Dima's proposed branch (https://github.com/sagemath/sagetex/tree/ninja-dev) uses the Python package - see https://github.com/sagemath/sagetex/blob/ninja-dev/setup.py

We can do that. But this adds to our workload the onus of generating the package(s) submitted to PiPY and CTAN, whoich must contain the executables and LaTeX files.

Of course, these can be further `Makefile` targets... ;-).

Can the `ninja` executable be substituted (easily) to the `ninja` Python package (or *vice versa*) ?

If so, coulld it be avantagous to "standardize" on one of them for present *and future* Sage work ?

Dima ?

If Dima wants to use ninja, he can just do that without needing the Python package.

He can just replace

```
import ninja
ninja.subprocess.run(['ninja'],check=True)
```
by

```
import subprocess
subprocess.run(['ninja'],check=True)
```

I'm not proposing a change - that's what the repository https://github.com/sagemath/sagetex looks like.

The release tarball on GitHub for 3.6 (sagetex-3.6.tar.gz at https://github.com/sagemath/sagetex/releases/tag/v3.6) looks OK. The initial issue raised in [comment:2](#comment%3A2) was fixed.

We can just use this package. I'll push a branch that does that.
