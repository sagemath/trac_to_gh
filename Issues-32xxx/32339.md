I think it would be easier to follow (and also faster) to modify the algorithm to work with Sage's convention. Also, here are some tweaks:

```diff
-        order_dict = {Tmax-i-1:e for i,e in enumerate(ordering)}
-        reverse_dict = {value:key for key,value in order_dict.items()}
+        order_dict = {Tmax-i-1: e for i, e in enumerate(ordering)}
+        reverse_dict = {value: key for key, value in order_dict.items()}
 
         B = list()
         Q = deque(([],))
         i = 0
         while Q:
             H = Q.popleft()
-            tp = reverse_dict[H[-1]] if len(H)>0 else -1
-            Ht = [H+[order_dict[i]] for i in range(tp+1,Tmax)]
-            if all(map(self.is_independent, Ht)):
+            tp = reverse_dict[H[-1]] if len(H) > 0 else -1
+            Ht = [H + [order_dict[i]] for i in range(tp+1, Tmax)]
+            if all(self.is_independent(x) for x in Ht):
                 B.append(frozenset(H))
                 Q.extend(Ht)
         return B
```
The only non-trivial/PEP8 tweak is removing the `map` as I find generator expressions easier to read (although perhaps it is slower and so we shouldn't do it).

Can you also just post the complete tests and timings as a comment in the ticket. Just the result of `%time`/`%timeit` should be sufficient. It makes it easier to see at which stage the timings were conducted and less to navigate.

In particular, it is not faster for small matroids with a relatively simple structure and I think the speed up for other classes of matroids makes this change worth it.",

```

So it does seem to vary a bit. In particular, it is not faster for small matroids with a relatively simple structure and I think the speed up for other classes of matroids makes this change worth it.

Ah, that's right, its a cpdef method so we can't have generator objects.

I made some Cython specific stuff for speed. I also tweaked the algorithm slightly to avoid some of the checks you were doing. Granted, my improvement pales in comparison to your original one, but I still am squeezing a bit more out. Here are the timings in the same order as what you have above:

```
1.59 ms ± 14.6 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
12.5 µs ± 138 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
608 µs ± 5.2 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
27.7 µs ± 322 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
150 µs ± 5.19 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
12.6 ms ± 35.9 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
320 µs ± 3.61 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
15.7 ms ± 156 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
```
vs your branch:

```
sage: %timeit M.no_broken_circuits_sets()
1.78 ms ± 14.6 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
23.1 µs ± 256 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
789 µs ± 12.4 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
46.6 µs ± 1.01 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
209 µs ± 2.21 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
13.8 ms ± 125 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
406 µs ± 2.42 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
16.2 ms ± 42 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
```

If my changes are good, then positive review.

I'm slightly worried about disabling bounds checking because of possible crashing and security issues. 

On my machine commit de750fe has the following timings:

```
625 loops, best of 3: 1.36 ms per loop
625 loops, best of 3: 10.4 μs per loop
625 loops, best of 3: 401 μs per loop
625 loops, best of 3: 17.8 μs per loop
625 loops, best of 3: 87.4 μs per loop
25 loops, best of 3: 9.82 ms per loop
625 loops, best of 3: 183 μs per loop
25 loops, best of 3: 12.8 ms per loop
```

and with bounds checking enabled:

```
625 loops, best of 3: 1.38 ms per loop
625 loops, best of 3: 9.85 μs per loop
625 loops, best of 3: 404 μs per loop
625 loops, best of 3: 17.1 μs per loop
625 loops, best of 3: 83.1 μs per loop
25 loops, best of 3: 9.87 ms per loop
625 loops, best of 3: 179 μs per loop
25 loops, best of 3: 13.1 ms per loop
```

I don't see an appreciable difference between bounds-checking enabled and disabled. So if my changes are good, positive review.

You should not be worried about crashing. We have doctests for the places in the code where it would fail. I don't understand why there would be any security issue (unless you mean something different than system security here).

There are a lot of variations in your timings, and enabling the bounds-checking should not result in a speedup. I am bit suspicious of the reliability, but this is a minor point and we don't need this level of micro-optimization.

Sorry, I meant that enabling bounds-checking did not appear to slow it down. If there was a big slow down I would have looked more into the security side of things to see if it was ok to disable the bounds checking, but since there was not any apparent slow down, it seemed ok to me to just disable it.
