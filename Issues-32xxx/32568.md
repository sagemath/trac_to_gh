part of #13112 and follow-up of #32723.

We add parameters `by_weight`, `weight_function` and `check_weight` to several methods and deprecate former parameters like `wfunction` and `weighted`.

Method `random_spanning_tree` is taken care of in #30566.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32805
