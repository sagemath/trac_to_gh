Keywords: solve

The following code:

```
sage: a, b, c, d = SR.var('a, b, c, d', domain='real')
sage: solve([a == -d], [a, b, c, d])
```
should return:

```
[[a == -r4, b == r6, c == r5, d == r4]]
```
but instead gives the following error:

```
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'lhs'
```
