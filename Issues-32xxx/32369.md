<a id='comment:38'></a>This should now pass all the doctests. The indexing set should be a `UniqueRepresentation`, which fixes an issue with comparisons. I had to make a few tweaks to how elements were being constructed. I also made the `E.basis().keys().an_element()` behave as before.

Some simple timings for multiplication:

```
sage: E.<a,b,c,d> = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ)
sage: r = E.an_element(); r
b*c + 2*a + 3*b + 1
sage: %timeit r * r
10.9 µs ± 46.7 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)
sage: r = sum(E.basis())
sage: %timeit r * r
99 µs ± 438 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)

sage: E = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ, 'x', 10)
sage: r = sum(E.basis())
sage: %timeit r * r
179 ms ± 939 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```
versus before

```
11.1 µs ± 42.2 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops 
139 µs ± 271 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)

931 ms ± 5.76 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```
So we are seeing substantial gains when multiplying larger elements. With the Cythonization of #34138, this then becomes

```
8.05 µs ± 91.9 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)
73.4 µs ± 631 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)

129 ms ± 1.04 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```
Is it easy to run timings for these computations in M2?

Here you go:

```

o1 = E

o1 : PolynomialRing, 4 skew commutative variables

i2 : r = b*c + 2*a + 3*b + 1;

     -- used 0.000222222 seconds

i4 : r = sum(flatten(entries(basis E)));

i5 : r

o5 = a*b*c*d + a*b*c + a*b*d + a*c*d + b*c*d + a*b + a*c + b*c + a*d + b*d + c*d + a + b + c + d + 1

o5 : E

i6 : time r*r;
     -- used 0.00095186 seconds

o7 : PolynomialRing, 10 skew commutative variables
