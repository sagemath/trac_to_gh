<a id='comment:38'></a>This should now pass all the doctests. The indexing set should be a `UniqueRepresentation`, which fixes an issue with comparisons. I had to make a few tweaks to how elements were being constructed. I also made the `E.basis().keys().an_element()` behave as before.

Some simple timings for multiplication:

```
sage: E.<a,b,c,d> = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ)
sage: r = E.an_element(); r
b*c + 2*a + 3*b + 1
sage: %timeit r * r
10.9 µs ± 46.7 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)
sage: r = sum(E.basis())
sage: %timeit r * r
99 µs ± 438 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)

sage: E = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ, 'x', 10)
sage: r = sum(E.basis())
sage: %timeit r * r
179 ms ± 939 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```
versus before

```
11.1 µs ± 42.2 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops 
139 µs ± 271 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)

931 ms ± 5.76 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```
So we are seeing substantial gains when multiplying larger elements. With the Cythonization of #34138, this then becomes

```
8.05 µs ± 91.9 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)
73.4 µs ± 631 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)

129 ms ± 1.04 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```
Is it easy to run timings for these computations in M2?
