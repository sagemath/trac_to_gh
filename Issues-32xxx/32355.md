Tensor contractions on multiple indices give wrong results when the outcome is a scalar and the index positions in each tensor do not have the same order. For instance, let us consider

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')                                                                          
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()                                                                           
sage: a = M.multivector_field(2)                                                                    
sage: a[0,1] = 1                                                                                    
sage: b = M.diff_form(2)                                                                            
sage: b[0,1] = 1                                                                                    
```
The double contraction a<sup>ij</sup> b<sub>ij</sub> is obtained via

```
sage: a.contract(0, 1, b, 0, 1).expr()                                                              
2
sage: (a['^ij']*b['_ij']).expr()  # equivalent to above                                                                 
2
```
which is correct. However, asking for the double contraction a<sup>ij</sup> b<sub>ji</sub> 
leads to 

```
sage: a.contract(0, 1, b, 1, 0).expr()  
2
sage: (a['^ij']*b['_ji']).expr()  # equivalent to above                                                                     
2
```                                                          
which is obviously wrong: the result should be -2, since b is antisymmetric.

If the outcome is not a scalar field, there is no issue:

```
sage: c = M.tensor_field(3, 0, antisym=(0,1))                                                       
sage: c[0,1,0] = 1                                                                                  
sage: c.contract(0, 1, b, 0, 1).display()  # correct result                                                        
2 ∂/∂x
sage: c.contract(0, 1, b, 1, 0).display()  # correct result

```

Here are some comments.

- I think you don't need to initialize a new component in

   ```python
             comp_for_contr = Components(self._ring, self._frame, ncontr,
                                         start_index=self._sindex)
   ```

   and you can use `self.index_generator()` right away, no?

- What about this?

   ```diff
   -            for ind_s in comp_for_contr.index_generator():
   -                ind_o = [None for i in range(ncontr)]
   -                for pos_s, pos_o in contractions:
   -                    ind_o[pos_o] = ind_s[pos_s]
   -                ind_pairs.append((ind_s, ind_o))
   +            for ind_s in self.index_generator():
   +                ind_o = [ind_s[pos_s] for pos_s, _ in sorted(contractions, key=itemgetter(1))]
   +                ind_pairs.append((ind_s, ind_o))
   ```

   You could also turn the outer for-loop into a list comprehension which would be faster but I reckon less well readable.

Yes indeed! (this is needed for the generic case, but not for the specific case of a scalar output). The latest commit implement this change.

I would prefer to keep the original version, since it is more efficient from a computational point of view: there is no need to sort a list. Granted: in most use cases, the list contains only a few elements and sorting shall be fast. So it is more a matter of taste...

You're right, this is faster! Then I still have one last comment:

```diff
-                ind_o = [None for i in range(ncontr)]
+                ind_o = [None] * ncontr
```

This is indeed faster.

If that is done, and patchbot is happy -> positive review.
