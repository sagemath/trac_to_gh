We change the definition of `defining_morphism()` and add `top()` to expose the morphism defining a ring extension and the top ring. So we can

```sage
sage: F = GF(5^2)
sage: K = GF(5^4).over(F)
sage: K.defining_morphism()
Ring morphism:
  From: Finite Field in z2 of size 5^2
  To:   Finite Field in z4 of size 5^4
  Defn: z2 |--> z4^3 + z4^2 + z4 + 3
sage: K.top() == GF(5^4)
True
sage: K.morphism_from_base()  # old defining_morphism()
Ring morphism:
  From: Finite Field in z2 of size 5^2
  To:   Field in z4 with defining polynomial x^2 + (4*z2 + 3)*x + z2 over its base
  Defn: z2 |--> z2
```

I named it so since the method just returns `self._backend_defining_morphism`. The latter was named by the authors of ring extensions in Sage.

I am okay with the last one `.morphism()`.

I forgot that the name `.defining_morphism()` is already taken.

```sage

cc roed and saraedum who contributed to the writing of the class `RingExtension`.

When I designed ticket #21413, this idea was to keep the backend morphism private. The point behind this was the following: the backend ring/morphism reflects how things are implemented internally while the ring extension itself is the mathematical object the user is supposed to work with.

For instance, if I do some complicated construction but the software understands by itself than the top ring is something simple and/or already efficiently implemented, then it can switch silently (magically) to this implementation. The basic example is the creation of towers of extensions (of finite fields, number fields, p-adic fields...) where it's convenient to flatten extensions to improve performances but where the user would certainly like to keep track of the intermediate fields. This philosophy is actually already more or less implemented for number fields; my motivation was to design a general framework to handle this.

For this reason, I'm really in favor to expose the backend ring/morphism to the user, but I can change my mind if you have good arguments. Why do you need this?

Besides, I thought a long time (and changed my mind several times) to the coersion model and I came with something which, I think, was satisfying. Changing the defition of `defining_morphism` would break this so again, I'm not really enthousiastic.

You mean "not to expose"?

I want to recover the morphism defining the extension when I am only given a ring extension. I think this is a natural need.
 
> Besides, I thought a long time (and changed my mind several times) to the coersion model and I came with something which, I think, was satisfying. Changing the definition of `defining_morphism` would break this so again, I'm not really enthousiastic.

The present definition of `defining_morphism` is not what one(mathematician) would naturally expect. A ring extension R over S is defined by a morphism from S to R. 

It seems `defining_morphism` is not yet used elsewhere in Sage library. So it seems quite safe to change the name. The new name `morphism_from_base` seems in good match with the definition. No?

But I do not insist to change the present definition if it is only me who finds the definition unnatural.

I needed this ticket for #33075. But now I have made #33075 independent from this ticket. To do that, I was forced to write

```python
from sage.rings.ring_extension_conversion import backend_morphism

embedF = backend_morphism(self.defining_morphism())
```

to obtain the defining morphism from the ring extension `self`. Is there a simple solution?

What is broken? There is no change in the coercion model.

Thanks! I think that it's indeed the simplest solution.

However, I continue claiming that if you want to use the `over` constructor, you should consider to option to always work with `L/K` in place of `L`.

For #33075, I found that even this `embedF = self.defining_morphism()` works, perhaps because of the coercion from the extension to the top ring. This is even compatible with this ticket.

> However, I continue claiming that if you want to use the `over` constructor, you should consider to option to always work with `L/K` in place of `L`.

I don't get this. Real users choose to use whatever of `L/K` and `L` because they have access to both naturally. But for code in Sage library, it is presently inconvenient to get access to `L` (the defining morphism from `K` to `L`) from `L/K`. They are not implementation details but mathematically related objects.

The present definition of `defining_morphism()` is strange in that the object(the extension) appears as the codomain of the morphism that defines the object. I think there is no `defining_xxx()` method that has this cyclicity in Sage.
