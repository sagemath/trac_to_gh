In my biased opinion, if you feel the need to run `make --debug=all`, `remake -x` is better.

I gather that `setuptools_scm` must really depend on `setuptools`, not just order-only.
Because if I rebuild `setuptools`, clean `mpmath` and try building `mpmath` again (without cleaning `setuptools_scm`), it gets stuck,
as follows:

```
