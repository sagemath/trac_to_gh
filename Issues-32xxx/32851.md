Part of #24641.

Following a [report by Harald Helfgott on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/rOputadfR54):

- Currently `RBF(gamma(3/2, 1))` errors out, as
  `arb_hypgeom_gamma_upper` is not known to the arb interface
- Same for other special functions `erfi`, `Ei`,...

Here, by wrapping the corresponding functions from arb,
we add real ball special functions:

- `erfi` -- imaginary error function
- `Ei` -- exponential integral
- `Si` -- sine integral
- `Ci` -- cosine integral
- `Shi` -- hyperbolic sine integral
- `Chi` -- hyperbolic cosine integral
- `li` -- logarithmic integral
- `Li` -- offset logarithmic integral
- `beta` -- complete Beta function
- `gamma_inc` -- upper incomplete Gamma function
- `gamma_inc_lower` -- lower incomplete Gamma function

and we clarify that `zeta` with an extra argument
gives the Hurwitz zeta function.

Many other special functions implemented in arb are still to be wrapped even at the level of `CBF`, including all of `acb_dirichlet`. And then we should add appropriate wrappers for real balls and, when necessary (because of multiple arguments etc.), for symbolic expressions.

I don't quite get what you did with `gamma()` in `real_arb.pyx`.
There is `def gamma(self)`, which is `RBF(self).gamma()`, and `def gamma(self, x)`, which is 
`RBF.gamma(x)` - and the latter leads to things like `RBF(gamma(3/2,1))` erroring out.
It also squats the incomplete gamma function place.

Sorry for confision. I guess the branch almost does the job:

```
sage: RBF(gamma(3/2,RBF(sqrt(2))))
[0.37118875695353 +/- 3.29e-15]
```
works, but

```
sage: RBF(gamma(3/2,sqrt(2)))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can this be fixed?

the precision  (the last argument) in the calls to arb is always taken to be the precision of the 1st argument.

I am not sure what exactly this implies w.r.t. to the precision of the answer.

I'm also not sure whether this is always correct in the cases with more than 1 argument, e.g.
incomplete gamma.

The precision passed to arb is basically a working precision that does not guarantee anything on the precision of the result (except that it tends to infinity when both the precision of the arguments and the working precision do). When there are arguments of different precisions, it usually does not make sense to ask for more than the minimum of their precisions, but arb will typically do the right thing even if you do and there will be little performance penalty.

For functions with an additional parameter, you convert the parameter into `RBF`. Existing wrappers for arb special functions use coercions, not conversions. Coercion looks like a better choice to me, though this is debatable. In any case what we do with different functions should be consistent.

Switching from conversions to coercions breaks examples like `RBF(sin(3)).beta(sqrt(2/3))`, but `RBF(beta(sin(3),sqrt(2/3)))` (once implemented) will work, because the converter from symbolic expressions to real balls will traverse the expression and convert `sqrt(2/3)` recursively before it calls `beta`.

Also, all(?) occurrences of `RBF` in these conversions/coercions should be `self._parent`.

I've implemented these changes, please feel free to revert to your branch if you disagree.

Regarding `a.beta(b)`, yes it does, and that's intentional.

As for `RBF(beta(a,b))`, the main reason it does not work is that `Function_beta` does not define the magic method `_method_arguments()` needed to specify how to map the arguments of the symbolic functions to those of the method.

Nevertheless, it seems that you are right and implementing `_method_arguments()` is not enough, because, contrary to what I said above, `Expression._arb_()` does not convert the arguments before calling the method. And indeed it shouldn't, since for some functions, the additional argument is not a ball.

I don't like the idea of `ball.special_function(param)` triggering a conversion, but I don't know how to solve the issue...

To be clear, I am not concerned about performance issues. I don't like the idea of special functions converting their argument because conversions are unsafe and should be as explicit as possible (that's the whole point of the conversion/coercion distinction).

It's `CBF` that can't properly handle symbolic arguments, e.g. `CBF(Ei(I))` leads to an infinite recursion, just as `RBF(Ei(1))` did before the fixes introduced in this ticket. And `CBF(Ei(I))` doesn't work because there `CBF` does not know anything about Sage function `Ei`, it only knows about how to compute `Ei(t)` for t converted to CBF, by calling an improperly named `CBF(t).ei()`.

A fix is trivial:

```diff
--- a/src/sage/rings/complex_arb.pyx
+++ b/src/sage/rings/complex_arb.pyx
@@ -4192,6 +4192,8 @@ cdef class ComplexBall(RingElement):
         if _do_sig(prec(self)): sig_off()

+    Ei = ei
+
     def si(self):
         """
         Return the sine integral with argument ``self``.
```

Now we can do

```
sage: CBF(Ei(I))
[0.337403922900968 +/- 4.31e-16] + [2.51687939716208 +/- 2.01e-15]*I
```

I'm setting this back to positive review, and invite everyone to deal with the `CBF` issue in #32869.

But Samuel is right that the docstring of beta was incorrect. I fixed this, made a couple of other minor improvements, and rebased the branch on top of the last beta.

I agree that some of the methods of `CBF` have badly chosen names/interfaces in view of what is available in `sage.functions`. Part of the reason, I guess, is that these methods were added (in #19082) before the mechanism for calling them when converting symbolic expressions.

From my point of view (and I thinks this may explain some of the misunderstandings on this ticket), the main goal of the methods of the form `ComplexBall.special_function()` is to provide a clean interface to the special functions available in Arb. `CBF(constant_expression)` sort of works now, but it is a fragile hack, and I do not recommend relying on it.

As a side note, it is not necessary for `CBF(f(x))` to work that `f` and the method it defers to have the same: the symbolic function can also provide the mapping. But I agree that it makes more sense in the present situation to rename the methods of `ComplexBall`.
