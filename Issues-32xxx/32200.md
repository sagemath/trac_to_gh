I think something should be explicitly mentioned about `__hash__` being a definite exception.

More in the bikeshedding category: I think this would be better placed before the `IMPORTING` section as it is more minor than hashing and coercion.

`__len__` and `__int__` are other examples, I think. Should we try to be exhaustive here?
