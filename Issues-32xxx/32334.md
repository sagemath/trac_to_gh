The documentation of `discrete_log` (in `groups/generic.py`) describes the possibility to use the optional `identity=None, inverse=None, op=None` arguments when `op='other'`. However, those arguments are completely ignored (i.e. not passed on to the `bsgs` implementation).
This results in incorrect results where discrete_log fails silently and returns 0.
Probably this issue can be fixed by passing on those optional parameters to bsgs.

Furthermore, the function `discrete_log_generic` claims to be an alias of `discrete_log`, but the way it wraps the function is incorrect. Instead of passing on the arguments it receives, it sets them to the default value, see the following snippet from the sage codebase:

```
def discrete_log_generic(a, base, ord=None, bounds=None, operation='*', identity=None, inverse=None, op=None):
    """
    Alias for ``discrete_log``.
    """
    return discrete_log(a, base, ord=None, bounds=None, operation='*', identity=None, inverse=None, op=None)
``` 

Correctly, this snippet should call

```
    return discrete_log(a, base, ord=ord, bounds=bounds, operation=operation, identity=identity, inverse=inverse, op=op
```
