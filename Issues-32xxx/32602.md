The following call to the Magma interface seems to be triggering a segfault on the Python side. Traceback is from 9.2, but I actually first hit this in 9.5beta1, so I assume nothing changed in between.

```
sage: Q.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(3))
sage: u = x^6+x^4+2*x^3+2*x+1
sage: F0 = magma.FunctionField(GF(3))
sage: S = magma.PolynomialRing(F0)
sage: F = magma.FunctionField(S.1^2 - u(F0.1))
Fatal Python error: Cannot recover from stack overflow.
Python runtime state: initialized

For comparison, this works just fine:

```
sage: Q.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(GF(3), 2)
sage: u = x^6+x^4+2*x^3+2*x+1
sage: F0 = magma.FunctionField(GF(3))
sage: u(F0.1,0)
$.1^6 + $.1^4 + 2*$.1^3 + 2*$.1 + 1
```
so it is possible the underlying issue isn't in the interface at all.

It looks like this traceback goes inner-at-top, so it seems there is some zmod_flint that leads to an infinite recursion in determining if something is true.

In the python traceback there is a pretty good indication of where the infinite recursion happens:

...[The following repeat a LOT]
  File "/usr/local/sage/sage-git/local/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/sage/interfaces/magma.py", line 2631 in __bool__
  File "/usr/local/sage/sage-git/local/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/sage/interfaces/interface.py", line 1308 in bool
  File "/usr/local/sage/sage-git/local/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/sage/interfaces/magma.py", line 2631 in __bool__
  File "/usr/local/sage/sage-git/local/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/sage/interfaces/interface.py", line 1308 in bool
```
so this looks like a `__bool__` call on a magma interface element leading to exactly the same again (probably with the same argument). That's consistent with the GDB traceback part too (at least the fact that `PyObject_IsTrue` is involved)

Indeed,

```
sage: Q.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(3)) 
sage: u = x^6+x^4+2*x^3+2*x+1 
sage: F0 = magma.FunctionField(GF(3))                                                                   
sage: bool(F0.1)
```
already blows up.

In fact:

```
sage: magma("1 eq 0").bool()
```
blows up: the magma interface cannot determine the truth value of magma's "false" object.

The same happens for

```
sage: magma("1 eq 1").bool()
```

On can see why: looking into the the code, we're executing:

```
        try:
            return not self.parent()("%s eq 0" % self.name()).bool()
        except TypeError:
            # comparing with 0 didn't work; try comparing with
            try:
                return not self.parent()("%s eq false" % self.name()).bool()
```
so in order to determine the truth value of "true", we first try "true eq 0" (which raises TypeError) and then try "true eq false" which will produce "false". We then try "false eq 0" and then "false eq false" which will produce "true", and now the circle is complete.

This has never worked. I suspect someone was a bit overzealous in changing a "x == 0" to a "bool(x)", because that's something that python allows but isn't always a better expression of intent and, as this shows, may not actually be an improvement in code because it's not actually equivalent!!! `F0.1 == 0` works just fine.

Patch to change the `__bool__` method as nbruin suggests, doing the comparison at the level of the Magma string representation. I'm a bit nervous that this is too simple-minded, but it doesn't seem to break any of the doctests.

Speaking of which, I tweaked a couple of unrelated doctests which were slightly off (possibly dependent on Magma version; I tried this with 2.25-5).
