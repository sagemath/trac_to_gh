Follow up on #29922. 
The doctester uses `RealIntervalField` for doctests involving numerical tolerances. This is an obstacle to doctesting modularized subset distributions because `RealIntervalField` depends on a compiled library (MPFI).

We should eliminate this by rewriting it in a more elementary way.

As of this ticket, we just issue a warning if `RealIntervalField` is not available.
