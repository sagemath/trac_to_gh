<a id='comment:4'></a>It seems like you are implementing a naïve version of `all_paths_iterator()` for `is_linear_interval`. I would probably implement it as

```python
def is_linear_interval(self, t_min, t_max):
    # We have the leq matrix, so checking comparisons is fast
    if self.is_lequal == self._alternate_is_lequal:
        if not self.is_lequal(t_min, t_max):  # very quick check
            return False
        t = t_max
        while t != t_min:
            found = False
            for u in self.neighbor_in_iterator(t):
                if self.is_lequal(t_min, u):
                    if not found:
                        found = True
                        t = u
                    else:
                        return False
        return True
    it = self.all_paths_iterator(t_min, t_max)
    try:
        next(it)
    except StopIteration:  # not comparable
        return False
    try:
        next(it)
    except StopIteration:  # one path
        return True
    return False
```
I suspect the naïve version you have is faster when the comparisons are fast, but not when we have to check for paths in the Hasse diagram digraph (the default/generic `is_lequal`).
