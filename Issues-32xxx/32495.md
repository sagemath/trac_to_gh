Back in the days, `EllipticCurveIsogeny._richcmp_` used to compare only the kernel polynomials. This was incorrect and is fixed since #11327, but traces of the old implementation remain:

* Unnecessary `self.__init_kernel_polynomial()` in `_richcmp_`.
* Docstring: "This function works by comparing the underlying kernel objects".

This (tiny) patch corrects these two things.
