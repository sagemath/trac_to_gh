<a id='comment:10'></a>I see no issues with functionality. A few minor doc things and one extra `if`.

- the default is formal=False, so the first main paragraph should not say it computes the formal unless the user specifies otherwise (i.e., that logic should be reversed)

- end of second paragraph - "critical points" should be "periodic points"

- If False, and he map is  -> "the"

- use_algebraic_closure - "critical points" should be "periodic points"


- no examples of algebraic closures in dimension > 1

- line 4711 -- need line wrap

- line 4798 -- extra word in comment ("which *point* the point")

- line 4817 -- aren't we already in the dimension == 1 case?



- looks like this needs to be updated for the latest preperiodic point ticket (31944)
