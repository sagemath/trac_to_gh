This would provide the operators currently implemented in `Polyhedron_base`: `__neg__`, `__truediv__`, `_add_`, `__sub__`, `_acted_upon_`.

(We do not make them available in `ConvexSet_base` because they may conflict with other intended operator semantics.)

We also add an `@abstract_method(optional=True) ConvexSet_base.minkowski_sum`.



Depends on #31993
