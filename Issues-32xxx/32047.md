Create a module that computes

(1) the kth Elser number of a graph G

(2) the nucleus complex of a graph G for every subset of the vertices

(3) Betti numbers of these complexes

For definitions of these objects, see: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcta.2020.105364

As a side-effect of these computations, also define functions of possible general interest

(4) is_vertex_cover determines if L is a vertex cover of G (returns a boolean)

~~(5) all connected subgraphs of a graph G~~
based on a suggestion from dcoudert, item 5 has been moved to its own ticket, see Ticket #32136

Some remarks.

Your method `connected_subgraphs_of` suffer several problems.
- It has a strange name : I would simplify to `connected_subgraphs`.
- More importantly, there is an undesirable collision with `connected_subgraph_iterator` where a connected subgraph means a subset of vertices on which the induced graph is connected.
- I would rather implement an iterator rather than returning a list (this is quite standard that Python functions tend to return iterators rather than lists)
- Finally, such function could be optimized a lot using backtracking

Also in `nuclei_by_size`, why do you sort them by size? The size is easily recovered with `len(G)` (which is much faster than `len(G.vertices())`). If you just implement `nuclei` then the dictionary can be reconstructed in two lines

```
sage: G = # whatever
sage: by_size = {i: [] for i in range(len(G))}
sage: for N in G.nuclei(): by_size[len(N)].append(n)
```
Also, if I am not mistaken, to make your sum you don't need that dictionary as the Elser number is

```
return (-1)**(len(G)+1) * sum((-1)**len(N) * len(N)**k for N in G.nuclei())
```

Actually, the connected subgraph part deserves a separate ticket. It's a significant amount of work and it's easier to review / correct / improve smaller tickets.

The difference with `connected_subgraph_iterator` is that you want all connected subgraphs and not only the induced connected subgraphs. So an option could be to add parameter `induced` to `connected_subgraph_iterator`, and then to switch to the appropriate method.
And it's true that `connected_subgraph_iterator` could be renamed `connected_subgraphs`.

Thanks dcoudert for the comments! I'll separate the tickets and will work on your suggestion for adding an `induced` parameter to the existing `connected_subgraph_iterator`.

As for the timing issues, there are some small things that can be changed, but I'm not sure how much it will change the timing for arbitrary graphs. Given that, I'll hold off those changes for once everything else is working.
