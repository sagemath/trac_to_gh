Since #23940 we have a reasonably good implementation of logarithms for (finite) `AdditiveAbelianGroupWrapper`s, but the method is still named `_discrete_log` and therefore hidden from the public.

This patch removes the leading underscore. While I was at it, I also removed the underscore from `discrete_exp` and did a couple smaller things to improve the documentation of that class in general, so that it hopefully looks a little bit less like an obscure internal helper class.
