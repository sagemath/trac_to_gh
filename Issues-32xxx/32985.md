I doubt it. sage-on-gentoo works perfectly with this ticket and if it wasn't for troubles with the latest giac I would have a perfect doctest run now.

I still have no idea how to inspect the logs, unfortunately. The last few lines of the sagelib build summary don't include the actual error, and if I click "View raw logs" or "Download log archive" I only get the same summary again in plain text.

They are not on the page for archlinux (runs/4439212188) you get after you click column on the left, they are on "main" page (runs/1547718702) you get after you click **Run SAGE_ROOT/tox.ini** from https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions

That is a strange Github Actions thing, I guess ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
