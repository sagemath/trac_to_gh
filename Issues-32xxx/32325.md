Found in [this ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/58202/system-eqs-eq-with-abs-then-solve-kills-the-kernel/) :

```
varL=var('a,b,c,d',domain='real')
eqL=[a == -d, b*c == 0, a*(b + c) == 0]
eqL.append((abs(a)+abs(b)+abs(c))!=0)
```

* The initial system of three equations is solved by the four available algorithms.
* The system augmented by the inequation can't be solved :
  - `algorithm="sympy"` raises :

    ```
    NotImplementedError: 
    inequality has more than one symbol of interest.
    ```
  - The other algorithms start eating memory at high speed (including swap) and can take the system down (memory starvation, possible workaround : `ulimit`). Interrupting them by `C-c C-c` gives a segmentation fault. 

I'm marking this one as `critical`, but I wouldn't oppose `blocker`, since it may take the whole system down.

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
FWIW, `Mathematica` can sort-of-solve the full system :

```
sage: mathematica.FullSimplify(mathematica.Reduce(eqL, varL))                   
((c == 0 && ((a == 0 && (b != Re[b] || Re[b] != 0)) || 
    (b == 0 && (a != Re[a] || Re[a] != 0)))) || 
  (b == 0 && a == 0 && (c != Re[c] || Re[c] != 0))) && a + d == 0
```
