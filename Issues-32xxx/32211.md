Ok, I really don't know how this works with cmake.

E.g. with mpfr flint does:

```
find_path(MPFR_INCLUDE_DIRS NAMES mpfr.h PATHS $ENV{GMPDIR} $ENV{MPFRDIR} ${INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR})    
```

<a id='comment:48'></a>Volker, you did not merge the dependency, #33189, that's why you got errors, e.g. here:
https://github.com/vbraun/sage/blob/7b26bb58475d9bc707bc9ed7d2a63351f2f4686c/src/sage/rings/real_arb.pyx#L3509

It should be 

```
sage: RBF(1/2).erf() # abs tol 1e-16
```
and not

```
sage: RBF(1/2).erf()
```
as in the branch you're testing.
