Whith OpenSSL 3.x installed from Sage, we get the following error:

```
sage: oeis(42)
<repr(<sage.databases.oeis.OEISSequence at 0x7f1fd4483e50>) failed: OSError: <urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1129)>
Error fetching https://oeis.org/search?q=A000042&n=1&fmt=text.>
```

This is due to the fact that we do not pass any SSL context to urllib.

The current branch also force https in the URL that are fetched by Sage, except:
- `src/sage/finance/stock.py` which is broken anyway #25473
- `src/sage/combinat/matrices/hadamard_matrix.py` since `http://neilsloane.com/hadamard/` does not provide https connections
- `src/sage/combinat/designs/ext_rep.py` since neither `http://designtheory.org` nor `http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~lsoicher/designtheory.org/` provide https connections.

There are a bunch of failures

```
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/databases/oeis.py  # 4 doctests failed
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/databases/findstat.py  # 4 doctests failed
```
that come from absurdly rigid doctests. Fixing them is outside of the scope of this ticket.
