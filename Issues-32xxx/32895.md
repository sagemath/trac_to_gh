We improve multiplication of matrix and vector for flint matrices by using that the rows of the matrix are already stored as vectors.

We also wrap the code in `try ... finally` such that memory is deallocated in case of interrupt.

Before, but with #32901 (note the skipped case, because of memory problems):

```

....:             M = random_matrix(ring, size)
....:             v = random_vector(ring, size)
....:             if size in (10, 100):

It's now almost up to the original speed. About 1 percent slow down. I would say this is not worth having a backup version.

I was thinking a bit this evening that doing first a transposition can't be it. In the end, flint does not do anything special. It just calculates it plainly. Even the dot product does not have any secrets. The reason `_vector_times_matrix_` took so long is apparently only because of the messed up order. The entries of the matrix are stored in rows. You don't want to jump around in memory in tight loops, so it makes sense to change the order to avoid this.

Now `_vector_times_matrix_` is even faster than `_matrix_times_vector_`, because in the tight loop there is no dependency. The loop can just be executed regardless and there is no waiting on results from previous steps.

-                _fmpz_vec_dot(x, self._matrix.rows[i], w_flint, self._ncols)
-                fmpz_get_mpz(ans._entries[i], x)

             sig_off()
         finally:
             fmpz_clear(x)
             _fmpz_vec_clear(w_flint, self._ncols)
+            _fmpz_vec_clear(ans_flint, self._nrows)
 
         return ans
```

This is probably just to advertize that `prange` can easily be used nowadays.

In that case it gets even more important to do careful timings: what kind of cache locality are you aiming for? Are you hoping the matrix and/or vector get prefetched? Do you expect the matrix to already be in cache and then the vector to get fetched? or the other way around? Or is the vector already "hot" because it is still in cache from the computation that produced it?

Parallelism would of course be nice, but I think it's also important to have an uncompromised single-thread implementation: in a larger computational project it's often much more advantageous to use some embarrassingly parallelism (technical term) higher up to get a better speed-up factor.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Now here are some timings of `_vector_times_matrix_` with some changes that we have some data:

As it is:

```
7.31 µs ± 30.5 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
174 µs ± 346 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
CPU times: user 16.2 ms, sys: 2 µs, total: 16.2 ms
Wall time: 16.3 ms
CPU times: user 1.54 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 1.54 s
Wall time: 1.54 s
```

Reading in the vectors as if they were transposed

```diff
-                    fmpz_addmul(ans_flint + i, w_flint + j, self._matrix.rows[j] + i)
+                    fmpz_addmul(ans_flint + i, w_flint + j, self._matrix.rows[i] + j)
```

```
7.5 µs ± 63 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
171 µs ± 256 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
CPU times: user 19.7 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 19.7 ms
Wall time: 19.7 ms
CPU times: user 3.36 s, sys: 60 µs, total: 3.36 s
Wall time: 3.36 s
```

Also moving in the vector:

```diff
-                    fmpz_addmul(ans_flint + i, w_flint + j, self._matrix.rows[j] + i)
+                    fmpz_addmul(ans_flint + i, w_flint + i, self._matrix.rows[i] + j)
```

```
7.02 µs ± 31.9 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
204 µs ± 160 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
CPU times: user 25.6 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 25.6 ms
Wall time: 25.6 ms
CPU times: user 3.91 s, sys: 1e+03 ns, total: 3.91 s
Wall time: 3.91 s
```

Having small movements, but lots of dependencies:

```diff
-                    fmpz_addmul(ans_flint + i, w_flint + j, self._matrix.rows[j] + i)
+                    fmpz_addmul(ans_flint + j, w_flint + j, self._matrix.rows[j] + i)
```

```
7.37 µs ± 34.5 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
146 µs ± 497 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
CPU times: user 12.8 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 12.8 ms
Wall time: 12.8 ms
CPU times: user 1.24 s, sys: 3.94 ms, total: 1.24 s
Wall time: 1.24 s
```

A bit more movement with dependency:

```diff
-                    fmpz_addmul(ans_flint + i, w_flint + j, self._matrix.rows[j] + i)
+                    fmpz_addmul(ans_flint + j, w_flint + i, self._matrix.rows[j] + i)
```

```
6.87 µs ± 31.9 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
202 µs ± 242 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
CPU times: user 21.1 ms, sys: 17 µs, total: 21.1 ms
Wall time: 21.1 ms
CPU times: user 2.09 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 2.09 s
Wall time: 2.09 s
```

Now using `_fmpz_vec_dot` instead of our manual version:

```
7.19 µs ± 34 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
188 µs ± 2.71 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
CPU times: user 19.5 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 19.5 ms
Wall time: 19.5 ms
CPU times: user 1.9 s, sys: 43 µs, total: 1.9 s
Wall time: 1.9 s
```

Apparently using `fmpz_mat_entry(self._matrix, j, i)` instead of `self._matrix.rows[j] + i` makes no difference.

And here are timings, that jump around more but avoid creating the answer vector:

Except for the first and last version, all other versions are very incorrect and just here to show what effect different changes have.

What really bothers me, is that the second version is so much faster for the small case. But the problems are never were you think they are:

That's actually something that ends up in inner loops quite a bit, so it would be worth timing that case more carefully and, if it is indeed slower, use a cross-over to use a different, faster, implementation for small dimensions.

Even the dot product does not have any secrets. The reason `_vector_times_matrix_` took so long is apparently only because of the messed up order. The entries of the matrix are stored in rows. You don't want to jump around in memory in tight loops, so it makes sense to change the order to avoid this.

For the small cases the caching and jumping around doesn't matter, as you can see above.
For the big cases it matters a lot. The really fast caches aren't as big as a matrix. So it would be good to reuse stuff in the cache, before loading new things. If we do things in a nice order, the cache can be filled while we are going. If we do it in a bad order, it cannot be refilled while we are going.

Yes, I know that parallelisism is usually better higher up. I was just playing around. Usually you want to treat lots of vectors, matrices or other objects. A matrix and vector in which the product is hard to compute by itself hardly fits in memory.

So, I think what needs to happen here:\n- identify if `_row_ambient_module` even needs a `base_ring` optional argument. It seems to me this is not desirable. If it can simply be removed, that should happen.\n- determine testing the `None` argument (or having it!) is measurable. If so, split out between a fast path routine without a base ring optional parameter and another one that does allow it. It looks like the only place where this gets used is in `row_module` just below it, so that could just do what it needs to do there (cached or not)\n- make sure the caching actually WORKS! not that the code presently writes a different cache entry than what it uses. So I think the main time difference you're measuring at the moment is the expensive `UniqueRepresentation` lookup  that happens in the `FreeModule` invocation that happens every time.\n\nI suspect that fixing the third one will bring it much more in line already but that working with a string constant for cache entry lookup will still be measurable. Certainly, we should not be using string formatting if we're just concatenating two strings either (and note that getting a string representation of a base ring could be quite expensive too)\n\nFurthermore, I think these routines should be `cdef` accessible as well.\n\nFinally, it might be worth looking into cached_method lookups for these. Especially for parameterless methods, those should be pretty efficient.",

Yes, that's ridiculously bad, but we can see where that's coming from: there's a difference in implementation between the two:

As you can see, `_row_ambient_module` is doing string formatting; even in its fast path! So, I think what needs to happen here:
- identify if `_row_ambient_module` even needs a `base_ring` optional argument. It seems to me this is not desirable. If it can simply be removed, that should happen.
- determine testing the `None` argument (or having it!) is measurable. If so, split out between a fast path routine without a base ring optional parameter and another one that does allow it. It looks like the only place where this gets used is in `row_module` just below it, so that could just do what it needs to do there (cached or not)
- make sure the caching actually WORKS! not that the code presently writes a different cache entry than what it uses. So I think the main time difference you're measuring at the moment is the expensive `UniqueRepresentation` lookup  that happens in the `FreeModule` invocation that happens every time.

I suspect that fixing the third one will bring it much more in line already but that working with a string constant for cache entry lookup will still be measurable. Certainly, we should not be using string formatting if we're just concatenating two strings either (and note that getting a string representation of a base ring could be quite expensive too)

Furthermore, I think these routines should be `cdef` accessible as well.

Finally, it might be worth looking into cached_method lookups for these. Especially for parameterless methods, those should be pretty efficient.

<a id='comment:22'></a>There are failing doctest. Not directly related to this ticket, but appearently something goes wrong:

On develop:

```
sage: dP6 = toric_varieties.dP6()
sage: Kc = dP6.Kaehler_cone()
sage: D = Kc.ray(1)
sage: p = D.parent()
sage: M = p._lift_matrix
sage: M*D
(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)
sage: D*M.transpose()
(1, 2, 0, 0, -1, 0)
sage: vector(list(D))*M.transpose()
(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)
```

Now I implement an innocent method for `Matrix_integer_dense`:

```
    cdef _matrix_times_vector_(self, Vector v):
        cdef Matrix_integer_dense transposed = self.transpose()
        return transposed._vector_times_matrix_(v)
```

And the result is different now:

```
sage: dP6 = toric_varieties.dP6()
sage: Kc = dP6.Kaehler_cone()
sage: D = Kc.ray(1)
sage: p = D.parent()
sage: M = p._lift_matrix
sage: M*D
(1, 2, 0, 0, -1, 0)
```

Apparently this is the problem:

```
sage: D.base_ring()
Integer Ring
```

So `D` is set up wrong. It inherits from `Vector_rational_dense` but the base ring is wrong and the parent is at least strange. I think the parent should have the same base ring as the element.

The above failure is due to an incorrect type case.

<a id='comment:36'></a>I removed the explicit dependence on the flint structures.

I don't know how good this would fit into flint and whether we should force and brand new flint version because of it.

If we use a brand new feature of flint, it means lots of compile time for many people.

Putting this into flint, might not be what we desire:
- We use GMP-vectors instead of FLINT-vectors.
- The methods allocate memory. Allocating memory within `sig_on` and `sig_off` is not a good idea.

Those are some of the issues, I can think of. I sure can try putting it in FLINT.

The doctest is mainly there for coverage (and of course as sanity check).

Why is that ? The inclusion in sage might wait for a flint release to appear.

Might make sense to actually switch to flint vectors. Or at least have an alternative implementation using flint vectors inside sage. That way we could directly call flint functions for the product : https://flintlib.org/doc/fmpz_mat.html#c.fmpz_mat_mul_fmpz_vec.

Alternatively, the following could directly be proposed upstream

```
void fmpz_mat_mul_mpz_vec(fmpz * c, const fmpz_mat_t A, const mpz * b, slong blen)
```

`fmpz_set_mpz` might allocate memory...

If we use new functions that were introduced in the latest version of flint, we will have to raise the requirements in `spkg-configure`. Currently, debian stable has flint 2.6.3, which will be accepted by sage (and the situation should be similar for other systems). If we raise this to the most recent version, almost everyone building sage will have to build flint as well for a while. That is fine, if there is some great new feature, but `matrix_times_vector` can be achieved with the existing FLINT Api without much work. This would be what I would expect `matrix_times_vector` to take care of:

```diff
+            for i in range(self._nrows):
+                fmpz_zero(x)
+                for j in range(self._ncols):
+                    fmpz_addmul(x, w_flint + j, fmpz_mat_entry(self._matrix, i, j))
+                fmpz_get_mpz(ans._entries[i], x)
```

That is different though. The memory is accounted for, and when calling `mpz_clear` it will be released (this requires that allocating memory and accounting for it is atomic, I don't know if this is the case but even if not and interrupt in between is not very likely). Whereas something as

```
sig_on()
void* foo = malloc(100)
# Do something
free(foo)
sig_off()
```
is not clean at all. `free(foo)` will not be called in case of interrupt. If we wrap a function that behaves like this with `sig_on`, `sig_off` an interrupt will usually result in memory leak and there is nothing we can do about it.

However, if all flint does is multiplication of a flint matrix and a flint vector and assign this to a flint vector, it will work just fine (or as fine as other code).
