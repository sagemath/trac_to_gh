In sage 9.3, raising an integer to a finite-field element in some cases coerces the **base** into the finite field. I think the correct behaviour should be to throw an error, or attempt to interpret the exponent as an integer (which is mathematically ill-defined but perhaps convenient).

Example:

```
sage: x = 123**GF(49)(5); x, x.parent()
(2, Finite Field in z2 of size 7^2)
```

Interestingly, this does not happen with prime finite fields, which inherit from integers modulo *n*:

```
sage: x = 123**GF(47)(5); x, x.parent()
(28153056843, Integer Ring)
```


**Keywords:** coercion, finite fields, exponentiation
