We move the code for creating the temporary directory to  `sage.misc.temporary_file`, removing the dependency on `sage.misc.misc` and `sage.misc.lazy_string`.

This is preparation for #29941, allowing us to keep `sage.misc.misc` out of **sagemath-objects** and **sagemath-repl**;  `sage.misc.temporary_file` goes into **sagemath-environment**.
