Modular symbols are also implemented in PARI, at least for `Gamma_0(n)`.  The goal of this ticket is to "couple" these to Sage modular symbols.

This is complicated somewhat by the fact that a space `M` of modular symbols in Sage and the corresponding space `P` in PARI are not canonically isomorphic.  Instead, there is a canonical duality between them.  Depending on the application, it is easier to think of this as a pairing (bilinear map) between `M` and `P`, or as a tensor, i.e. an element of `M ⊗ P`.  

On a future ticket, we will use this to implement the intersection pairing on cuspidal modular symbols (for `Gamma_0(n)`) via the PARI function `mspetersson`.
