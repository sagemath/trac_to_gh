I though multiline comments should precede the codeline they refer to:

```diff
-    e = False # it is possible to get through the following commands
-              # without running a program, so in that case we force error
+    e = False
+    # it is possible to get through the following commands
+    # without running a program, so in that case we force error
```

I would propose instead:

```diff
-    e = False # it is possible to get through the following commands
-              # without running a program, so in that case we force error
+    # it is possible to get through the following commands
+    # without running a program, so in that case we force error
+    e = False
```
