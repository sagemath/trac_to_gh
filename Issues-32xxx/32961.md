```
FF = GF(next_prime(1000000))
M = 70000
N = 80000
v1 = vector(FF, [FF(k) for k in range(N)])
v2 = vector(FF, [N] * N)
vecs = [v1 + v2*FF(i) for i in range(M)]
mat = matrix(FF, M, N, vecs)
mat[0] == vecs[0] # return False
```
does not work correctly. This is due to the array storing `mat` being indexed by `long`, which is at most 2<sup>32</sup>-1<MN.

At least we should check that the number of entries can be
handled by the current implementation.
