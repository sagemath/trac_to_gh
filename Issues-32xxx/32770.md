Currently (version 9.5.beta4), there is no way in `plot3d/base.pyx`
to access tachyon command line flags. Among many of these flags,
there are the shading options, which might be more important than
the other flags. One reason might be that using them one can
turn off shadows (the corresponding flag is `--mediumshade`).
Having shadows sometimes lead to confusing plots. So one might
want to turn them off.

This ticket is intended to fix that by implementing two options 
for tachyon plots. One is `extra_opts` which pass flags to
the tachyon command line. The other option is `shade`, which
is a shortcut to command line shading flags:

-  `shade` (for tachyon) -- string (default: `'full'`); shading options. Admissible values are
   * `'full'`: best quality rendering (and slowest). Sets tachyon command line flag `-fullshade`.
   * `'medium`: good quality rendering, but no shadows. Sets tachyon command line flag `-mediumshade`.
   * `'low'`: low quality rendering, preview (and fast). Sets tachyon command line flag `-lowshade`.
   * `'lowest'`: worst quality rendering, preview (and fastest). Sets tachyon command line flag `-lowestshade`.
-  `extra_opts` (for tachyon) -- string (default: empty string); extra options that will be appended to the tachyon command line.

As a side note, `plot3d/tachon.py` already has the option `extra_opts`
implemented.
