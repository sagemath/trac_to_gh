- `networkx` 2.8.0 https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/doc/release/release_2.7.rst requires us to drop python 3.7 support too

SciPy also has stricter compiler requirements: C++14 support. According to https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/toolchain.html, GCC >= 6.3.

Is the fix for the deprecation warning also OK for early scipy?
Then it's better to put it on a separate ticket that can be merged earlier.

(I think I would want to hold off on the scipy 1.8 upgrade for a little while - maybe it should go into Sage 9.7, not 9.6)

We are setting `SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS=local` on homebrew to avoid homebrew's distutils.cfg, which is still present (and broken) in pre-3.10 versions:

```

/usr/local/opt/python@3.7//Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/distutils/distutils.cfg
