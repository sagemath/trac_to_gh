and it's already the case, so we check the weights only once, in `min_spanning_tree`.

So we can simplify the tests to let only

```
            sage: g = Graph([(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 'a')], weighted=True)
            sage: g.min_spanning_tree()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            ValueError: the weight function cannot find the weight of (1, 2, 'a')
```
and

```
            sage: g = Graph([(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, [1, 2, 3])], weighted=True)

            sage: g.min_spanning_tree()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            ValueError: the weight function cannot find the weight of (1, 2, [1, 2, 3])
```
I'll do it in this ticket if you agree.
