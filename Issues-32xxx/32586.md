It looks to me you need here the "sage global namespace". In a situation where sagelib is really just purely a python package, there is no such thing. So this code would need to be disabled in that case.

Alternatively, you build something that acts as a substitute for the "sage global namespace". Candidates: `sage.repl.user_globals` or, as you can see in `sage.structure.category_object.CategoryObject.inject_variables` you can use a hack that uses that cython code doesn't normally construct a stack frame, so that `globals()` in cython code refers to the globals of the callsite, not the global namespace of the module in which the routine is implemented. Those could possibly be reasonable substitutes. The idea, though, is that `sage.all` is the *default* namespace, so perhaps you *don't* want things to be shadowed by user redefinitions. In fact, in pickling that would be a recipe for disaster.

Quite frankly, in a modularized setup, pickles will be disastrous anyway, since this `sage.all` namespace will be dependent on what parts are installed at best. One solution would be to let 
`sage.structure.factory.lookup_global` depend on the top sage package. Then the complete namespace is reliably there.

Have we found a cycle in the dependency graph that makes sagelib monolithic yet?

Lots! And fixed many of them already back last year in the 9.2 development cycle. See #29869, #29873, #29892, #29883, #16351, #29881, #29880, #29916, #29922 

The dependencies can exist on 3 levels: Compile time, module-import time, run time. Cycles can arise at module-import time and run time.

In #29865 I have two subset distributions, `sagemath-objects`, `sagemath-categories`. By building them, one can verify that changes in Sage do not re-introduce module-import-time cycles, or module import dependencies of lower level modules on higher level modules.

In #32432 I'm prototyping another subset distribution, `sagemath-polyhedra`, with the goal of actually being able to pass the majority of doctests.

Thanks for the explanation, yes, I agree. So it should really be `sage.all` (or a subset of it -- leading to runtime errors, [comment:2](#comment%3A2))

In `sagemath-objects`, `sagemath-categories`, `sagemath-polyhedra`, I have introduced modules `sage.all__sagemath_objects`, `sage.all__sagemath_categories`, `sage.all__sagemath_polyhedra` that provide the respective subsets of the global bindings.
