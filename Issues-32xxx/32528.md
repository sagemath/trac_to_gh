Harald Helfgott reports:

```
    Starting with SageMath 9.3 (it seems), 

    RBF(stieltjes(1))

    gives me "unable to convert stieltjes(1) to a RealBall".

* `n.stieltjes(a=1)`, with both `n` and `a` in `CBF`? (correct argument order, `RBF(stieltjes(1))` will automatically work, but requiring an `n` of type `ComplexBall` is really ugly)

* `CBF.stieltjes(n, a=1)`?
I think I am leaning toward the third option.

Opinions?
