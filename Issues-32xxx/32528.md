Harald Helfgott reports:

```
    Starting with SageMath 9.3 (it seems), 

    RBF(stieltjes(1))

    gives me "unable to convert stieltjes(1) to a RealBall".

I think it was a bug if it ever worked: as far as I can tell, the only code for evaluating this numerically that we have in Sage goes through pynac, and in particular we don't have any arb bindings for these constants.

Right, so a wrapper for acb_dirichlet_stieltjes is needed to make it work (and make it work correctly).

Yes. I'm not sure what interface we want in sage:
* `n.stieltjes(a=1)`, with both `n` and `a` in `CBF`? (correct argument order, `RBF(stieltjes(1))` will automatically work, but requiring an `n` of type `ComplexBall` is really ugly)
* `a.stieltjes(n)`? (no omitting `a`, nonstandard order...)
* `CBF.stieltjes(n, a=1)`?
I think I am leaning toward the third option.

Opinions?
