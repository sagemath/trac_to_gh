Some of them already go through features - for those we just rename the feature so that its `name` attribute is equal to the intended "optional" tag.

For the remaining ones, we add new `Feature` subclasses in new files `src/sage/features/internet.py`, `mip_backends.py`.

Follow-ups:
- #32650 `latex.py`, 
- #32866 `interfaces.py`, 
- #32174, in which we can deprecate the `has_...` functions

There is no "tag of the feature". From the user's point of view, the others does not help. As `description` is optional, it doesn't add to the developer's burden.

If you are okay, I can upload a commit to restore the original "name"s using `description`. Still it is okay with me to drop this commit eventually for some reason...
