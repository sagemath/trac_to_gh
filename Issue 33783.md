# Issue 33783: Sage fails to simplify expression and does not recognize that it is equal to its simplified form

```
sage: e^(1/3*log(3) + 1/3*log(2))
e^(1/3*log(3) + 1/3*log(2))
sage: bool(e^(1/3*log(3))*e^(1/3*log(2)) == e^(1/3*log(3) + 1/3*log(2)))
False
sage: bool(e^(1/3*log(3) + 1/3*log(2)) == 6**(1/3))
False
```


Sage fails to recognize that e^(1/3*log(3) + 1/3*log(2)) simplifies to 6**(1/3).
