arb does not build on cygwin, failing at configure step:

****************************************************
Configuring...x86_64-CYGWIN64
Building both static and shared versions of MPIR/GMP on CYGWIN64 is currently
unsupported, and so is it for MPFR, FLINT and ARB.
You should pass --disable-shared or --disable-static to configure
depending on the versions of MPIR/GMP, MPFR and FLINT you built.

```


Note that FLINT is configured with --enable-static --enable-shared, without problem.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Trivial fix, apparently no side effect.

This will almost certainly conflict with #19639.

The patch (apart from everything coming from #19627) is trivial, only adding `--disable-static` to spkg-install. So, I just checked, it merges cleanly with #19639.

There was a conflict, but with a different ticket. #19639 conflicted with #19663.
