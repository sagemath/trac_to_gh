https://ask.sagemath.org/question/35755/how-to-put-legend-outside-of-the-graph-at-its-bottom/ has a good example of how to check whether various graphics options are set, as well as putting legend labels in various locations.  It should be added - probably at https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plotting/sage/plot/graphics.html#sage.plot.graphics.Graphics.set_legend_options or the like
