When building Sage within a directory with a long name, singular fails to build on OS X 10.4.  For example:

```
$ pwd
/Users/jdemeyer/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-sage-4.8
```


This problem was discovered by the newly added "moufang" (UGent) buildbot.

This is because of a problem with `src/factory/configure` and is fixed by generating `configure` with a more recent `autoconf` version.

So do you think this is the problem I had?  After all, names with `prealpha` in them are longer than those with `alpha` in them...

The new spkg fixes a problem, but I don't know if this caused your build failure.  Just try the new spkg here and let me know whether it works...

It works!  I will *not* try this on other platforms, trusting it works to the release manager.  I'm certainly not going to try to compare that new conf file to the old one, and I don't understand it in any case.

It seems like the changes in the spkg are not checked in, though.  Since that's the case, you might as well fix the typo "spgk-changes" in SPKG.txt.

In any case, the release will be tested on the buildbot.

Obviously, you shouldn't.  Now that upstream made the same change, you can consider the patch as coming from upstream.

Done.
