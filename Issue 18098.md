Err. There is a function in Sage which is called `.centrality_degree`, whose aim is more or less to compute the degree.

Right now, it is done by building a `NetworkX` copy of the graph, then asking `NetworkX` to give us the degree (divided by n-1).

Turns out that we can do better.

    A graph `G` on `n` vertices and `m` edges is said to

So even if it is standard, everywhere it is used it seems that there is precision about it. And I like it.

I would like people to have the same kind of strict expectations when they review my patches and when others write theirs. It takes weeks to add a stopgap somewhere but everything gets much more serious when I don't define 'n' in a docstring.
