While Python has just been upgraded to 2.7.9 #18397 there is now a fresh Python 2.7.10. It again fixes a number of bugs and backports stuff from 3.*.

The changelog is at https://hg.python.org/cpython/raw-file/15c95b7d81dc/Misc/NEWS and the gzipped source tarball at https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.10/Python-2.7.10.tgz.

Can you make this un-depend on #19470?

Can be done, but I have better things to do with my time.

Also note that the sage-fix-pkg-checksums doesn't work for the python2 package

The update to python 2.7.10 is fine as far as I know on x86_64 but I cannot vouch for the stuff from #19470. That's a part of sage I avoid touching since I just don't use it in sage-on-gentoo.
