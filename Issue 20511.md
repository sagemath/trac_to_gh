Ouch! Don't use `gmp` or `mpir`! Use `$(MP_LIBRARY)` instead.

Are you sure that these two packages depend on Python? I couldn't find any indication of that.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2016-06-02 13:30:34

Neither of these packages needs Python.

And `setuptools`...

This is getting frustrating, why does this need so many iterations to get a 2-line patch correct?

Well, sorry for that. I am not fully aware of all the subtelties of dependencies.
And I was not careful enough, I must admit.

Replying to [comment:23 chapoton]:

Well, not adding `setuptools` as dependency of a package which doesn't use Python, let alone setuptools, is not a very subtle thing.

Anyway, this looks good but I still need to test it.
