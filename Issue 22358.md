There is a tendency towards distributing Python packages as wheels only. We should support that in Sage, at least for wheels which are system-independent.

I'm not sure what is meant here by "support".  pip already does this automatically.

Yes, `pip` supports it but the Sage build system does not.

Ah, I see what you mean--that is if we download wheels to upstream/ right?

Right. Currently, Sage assumes that every upstream source is some kind of tarball which needs to be unpacked.
