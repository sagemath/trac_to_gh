Keywords: discriminant, FreeQuadraticModule


```
sage: q=FreeQuadraticModule(ZZ,2,inner_product_matrix=1)
sage: q
Ambient free quadratic module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
Inner product matrix:
[1 0]
[0 1]
sage: q.determinant()
1
sage: q.discriminant()
-2
```



This output is wrong. The discriminant should be -1.

The following is another related bug. I guess thats where the error of the first bug lies as well.



```
sage: q=FreeQuadraticModule(QQ,2,inner_product_matrix=1)
sage: q.determinant()
1
sage: q.discriminant()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)

/usr/lib/sagemath/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/modules/free_quadratic_module.pyc in discriminant(self)
    377         else:
    378             r = (n-1)//2
--> 379         return (-1)^r*self.gram_matrix().determinant()
    380
    381     def gram_matrix(self):

sage/structure/element.pyx in sage.structure.element.Element.__xor__ (/usr/lib/sagemath//src/build/cythonized/sage/structure/element.c:8229)()

RuntimeError: Use ** for exponentiation, not '^', which means xor
in Python, and has the wrong precedence.
```


This occurred on two different machines running sage 7.0 and 7.2 on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS and Fedora 24
(both x64).

This is my first ticket. Since it seems to be an easy fix, I will try to do that myself.

Welcome! The next step is to set-up git and trac so that you can push branches here.

Some explanations are there:

Please ask if you have any questions.

Next step is to find a reviewer. That will be me.

Next time post a link to the ticket you opened in (one of) the thread(s) on sage-devel... ;-)

And/or cc the people from the thread.

(I actually had the same fix lying around here, thought John C. would perhaps open a ticket, and just read in the "release notes" for beta4 it was already fixed; luckily, since I was about to open one myself.)

The mark-up in the docstrings of that file needs work as well, but that's (now) for another ticket.
