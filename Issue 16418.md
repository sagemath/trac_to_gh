A resolvable `OA(k,n)` is a `OA(k,n+1)`. This is just user interface, nothing smart.

At `u/vdelecroix/16655`:

1) There was a check that the sum of degrees is a multiple of the size of the ground set... I changed it into a check that all degrees are the same.

2) The output was wrong (should be a pair if `certificate=True` and a boolean if `certificate=False`).

3) Now `self._classes` is a list of lists of blocks and not a list of lists of indices

3) Some more documentation

Tell me what you think.

Yes of course `T_T`

> 2) The output was wrong (should be a pair if `certificate=True` and a boolean if `certificate=False`).

Right right.

> 3) Now `self._classes` is a list of lists of blocks and not a list of lists of indices

That's muuuuuuch better this way ! And my ugly sorting is not needed anymore.
