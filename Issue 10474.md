This one contains "attach" statements, which seems very strange and probably causes many problems. 

The header is also bad.

And QuiverMutationType is not recognized as a global command.

Somehow, all my changes belonging to this patch got into the next on cluster algebras and quivers...

On my computer, everything seems to be fine after moving all these changes into this patch, and all doctests pass.

What did you mean by:

 It appears that `C(M)` and `C(M')` are isomorphic Cartan types for mutation equivalent skew-symmetrizable matrices `M` and `M'`.

A3 is mutation equivalent to an oriented cycle, whose Cartan type is affine A2.  Maybe this should be removed?

Hi Hugh,

If I am not mistaken, this is the only dependency of this patch on #10538. What about the following:

- we take this method off this patch and add it to the other
- you can review of this patch (I guess, we might need some time for that already)
- you can spend more time on the other patch. It would be great, if we can get it reviewed this week, but this will be far from easy...

Thanks, Christian

Okay, I agree, BB,1,1 should be undefined.

I'm confused about the notation you're using for some of the exceptional finite mutation type classes.  The non-simply-laced finite mutation type mutation classes are classified in Felikson-Shapiro-Tumarkin, arXiv:1006.4276.  They __are__ elliptic root systems (F-S-T say this), contrary to what's in the package now, and as a result I would rather get them using Saito notation.  But I don't see how the data for them match up with the data in F-S-T.
----
Here's another question: for the most part, the third parameter is redundant.  I think the third parameter should only be used for the Kac convention (in affine root systems) and the Saito convention (in elliptic root systems).  

The only other information you're using it for is when you want to indicate the check in the other convention for affine roots.  But "check=true" would be easier to remember.

I also think it might be helpful to indicate references for the different conventions.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynkin_diagram#Affine_Dynkin_diagrams

seems to be a pretty good reference for the affine diagrams using the Kac convention.  And the convention Macdonald uses is recorded online at 

http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/24729/excerpt/9780521824729_excerpt.pdf

Then there is possibly a more canonical reference for Saito than F-S-T.

I think of AE as an affine type A plus an extra edge, so the logic is still the same (though the only point where it is visible that we have affine type A is that we use (a,b) as a second parameter in order to say how many edges are oriented in which direction.

Okay, I'll get a second opinion.  But note that the system you are using is actually less straightforward than that, since if, for example, you invoke a finite mutation type via a family like T, you have to enter a 3 anyhow.

Great.  If people are using Macdonald notation, how do you feel about making them say "affine=true" for affines (if we now reserve "twist" for Kac and Saito notations)?

I guess it does no harm to include BE, CE, DE.  The reason AE's notation seems different to me is that BE, CE, DE have "B on one end, E on the other", while this is not really true for AE (the A is really affine A, not finite A, and there isn't anything very E-like about adding an edge at an arbitrary point).  I'm inclined to remove it.

I am fine with using Rank2, Triangle, Grassmannian for the type names if it is more instructive to a user, but if it seems reasonable, would also keep the shorter 'R2', 'TR', and 'GR' as shorter inputs that then coerce to the longer names.

Regarding the issue of the "twist" parameter which is either 'None' for finite, '1' for affine, '2' for mutation-finite, or '3' for other, I am open to suggestion.  

We definitely want to distinguish Cartan finite from Cartan affine, or the elliptic types, and wanted some other useful sequences.  

In future implementations, we foresaw including other quiver sequences such as the Generalized Glick quivers, Somos 4 and 5 quivers (or other Gale-Robinson sequence quivers) or those coming from a Q-system, and quivers from other surfaces, so we would want an infrastructure that easily allows a user to encode quiver types from certain families.  This was part of the mutation for including a twist parameter but maybe its extraneous.

In the patch as it existed before I started messing about with it, there were three things that all had the same docstring: QuiverMutationType, QuiverMutationTypeFactory, and the whole document.  The same text occurred twice in the patch, once for the whole document and once for QMTF, with QMT getting assigned the docstring for the entire file.  

I think the docstring for the whole file should be different from the docstring for QMT.  One is only going to see that docstring if one is reading the whole file in the reference manual (right?) so the documentation for QMTF/QMT will be right there.  Therefore, I think it makes sense to have the docstring for the whole file be shorter.

I think the docstring for QMT and QMTF don't really have to be duplicated, either -- QMTF could just say "see QMT for the detailed documentation" since it's QMT that people are likely to be looking up.  

However, I guess I don't know how to make a docstring for something like QMT, which isn't defined via a def or a class.

QuiverMutationType_Reducible inherits from QuiverMutationType_Irreducible, so all methods not implemented there, are gotten automatically from the irreducible case. In the reducible case, I only implemented the methods that are **different** in both casses. Does this make sense to you?

I basically took this idea from Nicolas' implementation of CartanType: CartanTypeFactory just delegates different input to the right place -- we have an object


```
QuiverMutationType = QuiverMutationType()
```


and if the input is irreducible, we return a QuiverMutationType_irreducible object and if the input is reducible we return a QuiverMutationtype_reducible object. Moreover, QuiverMutationType also provides samples of quiver mutation types, see the samples methods in the factory.

PS: I just see that the docstrings for samples and _samples are still saying Cartan type instead of QuiverMutationType, could you replace that while you're on the file -- thanks!

Just my 2 cents: this is an abuse since a reducible cartan type is not
an irreducible cartan type (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is-a). It
would be preferable to introduce an upper class from which both would
derive.

Hi Hugh --

I recently implemented a CartanMatrix (available in the patch on reflection groups). I now added a patch


```
trac_10527-quiver_mutation_type-ht.patch
trac_???-cartan_matrix_for_quiver_mutation_type-cs.patch
```


and now, we have the following behaviour:


```
sage: mt = QuiverMutationType(['A',3])      
sage:  C = mt.cartan_matrix()              
sage:  G = C.reflection_group()
sage:  G.cardinality()
24

sage: mt = QuiverMutationType(['GR',(10,3)])
sage:  C = mt.cartan_matrix()
sage:  G = C.reflection_group()
sage:  G.cardinality()
+Infinity
```


Sweet, he? Beside that, the class CartanMatrix is not yet very advanced, and several important decisions are still to be made (e.g., how should CartanMatrix, CartanType, RootSystem, RootSpace, and so on, interact?), but that's a different topic.

How do you think to change the organization of the methods by using CartanMatrix (or CartanType)?

Best, Christian

Having cartan_type return a Cartan matrix would seem just natural to
me, as long as all operations on cartan types (building the root
system, the weyl group, ...) are available from a cartan matrix (they
should). In the long run, we probably want to rename all our
cartan_type methods to cartan_datum.

I guess you must have had a reason, but I don't quite see what it would have been, and without some reason to do otherwise, I would opt for the shorter and simpler name.  (Sorry for the stupid question.  I do plan to do something useful as well...)

Hello, Christian and Nicolas--

The Cartan matrix for finite type B is the same, whether we go via CartanType or QuiverMutationType (good, and not a surprise).  However, it is transposed compared to what is in Bourbaki (surprise, and probably not so good).  The same thing is true of finite type C.  

Is this some difference of choice of convention, or is it a bug?  

(I started looking at affine types, because there seems as if there might be some confusion there also, but I guess to begin with, it would be good if I understood the convention in finite type.)

cheers,

Hugh

Sorry, I hadn't yet looked at quiver.py, and wasn't aware of all that was in there.  At a first glance, I'm very happy to see that this exists!

Hi Nicolas and Christian--

The only relevant reference I found to Bourbaki is in root_system/cartan_type.py where it says that the *numbering* of roots follows Bourbaki.  What I am saying is not contrary to this.  

In sage-combinat-devel, in June of 2008, in the thread "tensor product of crystal code", I found Dan Bump saying the following:

> It says so in the documentation:
> > The edge multiplicities are encoded as edge labels. This uses the
> > convention in Kac / Fulton Harris Representation theory
> > wikipedia  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynkin_diagram, that is for i != j:

> > <==>  multiple arrows point from the longer root to the shorter one
>

>
> j -k-> i <==> a_ji = -k
>
> See this line in cartan_matrix.py():
>
>    cmf = lambda i,j: 2 if i == j else -f(j,i)

Since Kac and Bourbaki are contradictory (according to F&Z), everything is consistent.  

Dan seems to be unaware that the Kac convention which he calls "standard" is contrary to Bourbaki, but this would be an easy thing not to be aware of.  

I still think it would be useful to say explicitly in the cartan_matrix methods of CartanType and QuiverMutationType that the cartan_matrix is according to !Kac/Fulton-Harris and contrary to Bourbaki.  

I did also double-check the Dynkin diagrams, and they are correct consistent with this.  

And just to clarify, that means that all the finite type QuiverMutationTypes are consistent with what was already in Sage and consistent with Fomin and Zelevinsky (which is not surprising -- otherwise I'm sure it would have been picked up on already).  

cheers,

Hugh

Hi!

I have some further mathematical corrections to QuiverMutationType.  

Affine C is CC (not BC).  

D,n,2 is BB,n-1,1 (not CC,n,1).  

G,2,1 and G,2,-1 are reversed from what they should be.  (When this is fixed it will also fix D,4,3)

For consistency, I think: 
* C,n,-1 should return the dual of C,n,1, i.e., BB (right now it gives an error).
* B,n,-1 should return the dual of B,n,1, i.e., CD (ditto)
  
I think I have now checked the data for affine types.

I will go ahead and make these changes but I wanted to record them here in case anyone had any corrections to my corrections.  

cheers,

Hugh

```

I've made a few more minor changes, mostly to the documentation, and also catching that (T,(2,4,4)) = (E,7,1). I hope to be done #10527 soon! 

I think the property "affine" should only be implemented for irreducible 
quiver mutation types.  It's not clear what it means for an reducible 
quiver mutation type to be affine.  (A product of two affines is, in my view,
less affine than a product of an affine and a Dynkin is, since in the 
latter case, but not the former, the radical of the symmetric form is 
one-dimensional.)

I feel similarly about "elliptic" (though I have less mathematical knowledge to back up my gut feeling that the product of two elliptics isn't very elliptic).  

Thoughts?

Thanks for the heads up, although Line 1457 is an example rather than part of the source code.  Hence why there is no "print" command there.

Okay, it worked on my computer as follows (I am not saying this is the way to go, but it happened to work): after building a new branch, I pushed the three patches above, and then ran

```
sage -docbuild -i reference html

This failed with some ascii error somewhere but running

sage -docbuild reference html

afterwards then rebuilt everything (which was needed in order to get the folder `cluster_algebra_quiver` recognized by the documentation builder.

The doc looks good, in particular the colons in various places.

Sorry for the delay.  I still had a bit of mathematical review to do.  I corrected one significant error, in the calculation of duals for non-simply-laced elliptics (though I can't claim a lot of credit for having done so, since it was an error I had introduced myself at an earlierstage).

I fiddled a little bit with phrasing in the documentation.  

I made the titles referred to in the class_size method agree with the articles being referred to.

**

There is a mention in the documentation of "class_size" that the formulas for affine B and affine C
have been proved, but the proof is unpublished.  In the code, though, it says that the formulas are not proved.  This should be corrected to be consistent.  I didn't do it myself because I wasn't completely clear which formulas it was being claimed had been proved: affine C and its dual (which is not affine B) or affine C and affine B (and their duals) or just affine C and affine B.  

I think I see that the elements of a class and its dual class are 
naturally in bijective correspondence in acyclic types, but it's not obvious
to me outside that setting (though that's all that matters here).

It'd be easiest if the submitter (Christian S.) does this, then he can just replace the uploaded file with the edited one.

Looks OK, otherwise.

I also noticed that in several places it should be `EXAMPLES::` rather than `EXAMPLES:`. This will make `sphinx` happy. Did you actually try building the documentation in question?

Oops, sorry, my fault. It all seems to work just fine. I should learn more about `sphinx`, it seems...

#12496 is another ticket of mine where the patchbot is now complaining, giving word-for-word the same errors as the sagepad.org patchbot on this ticket.  So I think the problem is not with our tickets.  But I am surprised no one else is reporting it on sage-devel.

Since we cannot measure whether other tickets (that depend on 10527) are passing tests with the patchbot until this is resolved, has anyone encountered this error elsewhere?  Or know how to resolve this?  It appears to be a problem with the patchbot itself, rather than the patches.

Nicolas, should we be posting this on devel google-groups?

Hi!

I posted a thread on sage-devel about the sagepad.org patchbot -- it seems to be having a problem, as it is failing every patch.  

Volker's patchbot, though, Fedora/17/x86_64/3.5.2-3.fc17.x86_64/volker-desktop.stp.dias.ie, seems to be being confused by the lazy import.  (Search for "lazy_import" in the patchbot log file.)  

I don't know what the right thing to do about that is.  The easy option would be to change the import back to normal, and leave it to someone else who knows lazy imports (and maybe also the patchbot) better, to fix it.  Since there is no special reason that the cluster stuff has to be lazily imported, this seems pretty reasonable to me.  

cheers,

Hugh

The easy option would be to change the import back to normal, and leave it to someone else who knows lazy imports (and maybe also the patchbot) better, to fix it.  Since there is no special reason that the cluster stuff has to be lazily imported, this seems pretty reasonable to me.

I looked a bit, and the place it is failing at is when trying to
figure out which names would be imported by the "*"
(sage.misc.lazy_import.get_star_imports). And indeed this piece is a
bit tricky and therefore likely to be brittle.

I would suggest to avoid using the "*" feature of lazy_import by either:

(1) Puting explicitely in combinat.all the list of things to be lazily imported:

    lazy_import("sage.combinat.cluster_algebra_quiver.all", "QuiverMutationType,...", overwrite=False)

(2) Replace the "lazy import *" in combinat.all by a usual import *,
    and use instead lazy imports on each piece in
    sage.combinat.cluster_algebra_quiver.all

Solution 2 has the advantage of not having to touch again combinat.all
in later patches, knowing that this file is very often changed and
therefore a source of potential conflicts.

By the way: unless there is a strong reason not to, I would not leave
"overwrite" to its default value.

Cheers,
                                           Nicolas

I just uploaded a new patch which takes care of the issues that Hugh raised.  Thanks for that.  I also made one or two other changes that will be useful for patches 10538 going forward.  Please see my comments below.  

Replying to [comment:113 hthomas]:
> Yay!  So far as I can tell, the only complaint the patchbot is making is that we're adding new modules, but since we're importing them lazily, it's not really a problem.  

Yay!  Hopefully the patchbot will again be happy after it processes the new patch.  Yes, this seems related to https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/sage-devel/patchbot$20plugin$20start-up$20modules/sage-devel/6LByB07Ks9c/gU1TCecUwwoJ

and yes, it is true that we import (although lazily) modules.  So I agree that this plug-in is not an issue.  To double-check, I just CC'ed Robert Bradshaw (who had also mentioned the lazy_import to us for #10538).

Yes, this is fixed now.  Thanks for catching that.

As it stands, it looks like it's purporting to be some kind of complete list, but in fact not every type is well-described (e.g., GR, which takes a single additional parameter which is a tuple/list blah, blah).  In general, I don't think the goal of an error message should be to replace the documentation.  

Yes, you are correct  I slightly changed the phrasing for Elliptic, and then followed your advice for the last three lines.  Let me know if this looks okay.

> 
> I still think it's pointless to include AE.  If you want it, it definitely shouldn't have a twist of 3.  And I think the documentation should explain the input format.  

I ensured that AE doesn't take a twist argument, updated the example, and added a comment to the documentation about the input format.  I still vote to keep it, but don't feel too strongly if you and Christian want to get rid of it.  

> 
> I'm not sure why we're allowing QuiverMutationType('GR',(n,k)) as well as (k,n).  The Grassmannian of 3-planes in 2-space is just meaningless, and (in my view) it should return an error.  I could be argued out of this.

I forget now why we allowed switching the order of k and n.  Christian, do you remember?  Anyway, Hugh I agree with you, and made the change.  QuiverMutationType('GR',(5,2)) for instance now gives an error.  But we still have QuiverMutationType('GR',(3,5)) = QuiverMutationType('GR',(2,5)).

> 
> QuiverMutationType('D',3,2) works, but QuiverMutationType('A',3,2) doesn't.  But A_3 and D_3 are the same.  I think both should yield what D,3,2 does now (namely, C,2,-1).  There has to be some notation for it, and it's pretty peculiar to require people to think of the root system as derived from D,3 rather than A,3.  (The reason this makes some sense is that it fits the pattern of D,n,2, not the pattern of A,2n+1,2, but I think that's okay.)

This was from following Kac's affine notation, which didn't allow A_3^(2).  

However, coercing to ('D',3,2) might be a better choice than an error message here.  Unfortunately, ('A',3,2) doesn't resemble ('A',2k+1,2) in this case, but perhaps this is okay.  Christian, feel free to let us know if you have a different preference.  By the way, I just ran


```
sage: CartanType(['A',3,2])
['B', 2, 1]^*
sage: CartanType(['D',3,2])
['C', 2, 1]^*
sage: CartanType(['A',4,2])

sage: CartanType(['D',4,2])
['C', 3, 1]^*
sage: CartanType(['D',5,2])
['C', 4, 1]^*
```


as a sanity check, and it actually *does differ* from this choice.  Should we make 


```
sage: QuiverMutationType(['D',3,2])
['BB',2,1]
sage: QuiverMutationType(['A',3,2])
['CD',2,1]
```


instead?

In fact CartanType('B',2,1) and CartanType('C',2,1) only differ by a reordering of the roots.  This is consistent with our current choice, to treat QuiverMutationType('B',2,1) as a synonym for QuiverMutationType('C',2,1).  It's also consistent with letting CartanType('A',3,2) and CartanType('D',3,2) be the same (since QuiverMutationType orders roots differently from CartanType anyway).

No.  There is no diagram 'CD',2,1.  (In the sense that it isn't drawable.)

Gregg, I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to do with the code for the non-simply-laced elliptics.  

It seems to me that the code constructing the digraph for F,4,[2,1] is never called, because that input is automatically recast as F,4,[1,2] before that point in the code is reached.  

But if that code were run, I think it would cause problems.  As it stands, we have a quiver mutation type called F,4,[1,2].  It has certain attributes, including a digraph.

I have now rolled back my recent changes.  I believe there are some advantages to making further changes to the quiver_mutation_type.py file, but these advantages only occur in conjunction with the quiver.py file.  Thus, we still should discuss my ideas to see if there's possible bugs that I'm not foreseeing, but these no longer affect #10527, only #10538.  I have moved those changes (except for the bugs you found) out of my recent patch.  

The general point is that I don't want to add more quiver mutation types, I only want to allow more flexibility in the user building a quiver.

In #10538, I was planning to have a patch that will allow the ClusterQuiver class to call this command for certain user inputs.  This is somewhat like the suggestion you just made, if I understood correctly.

Short summary: my patch now only takes care of the issues you recently raised.

I applied them again, and it worked well -- I agree that it is better to leave the changes on constructing other quivers to the other patch, so we have some time for discussions on design issues...

Thanks for your comments again. Are you suggesting to lazily importing * ? We first did that but the patchbot didn't like it (i.e. some tests failed, see Comments [comment:95] and [comment:97] above), that's why we then did it another way.

Hi Gregg--

Thanks again for revising your patch.  The current version looks fine.  In the absence of the patchbot, I should make sure the patch applies properly and tests okay on the current development release, not that this is likely to be a problem.  My laptop is building 5.4.beta1 now.  

cheers,
