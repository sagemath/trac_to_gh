in python3:

```
sage: S=SymmetricFunctions(QQ)
sage: S([1])
m[1]
```

in python2:

```
sage: S=SymmetricFunctions(QQ)
sage: S([1])
p[1]
```

Maybe coming from a different order in  python 2

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ)
sage: Sym._realizations
[Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the powersum basis,
 Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the monomial basis,
 Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the elementary basis,
 Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the Schur basis,
 Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the homogeneous basis]
```

versus python3:

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ)
sage: Sym._realizations
[Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the monomial basis,
 Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the homogeneous basis,
 Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the powersum basis,
 Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the elementary basis,
 Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the Schur basis]
```

I would not consider this a bug. In fact, it is a potential issue with anything that uses the `WithRealizations()`. Generally you should not expect consistent results when trying to construct something from the abstract object as it is ill-defined. You need a specific realization (e.g., a specific basis) to use it. The abstract object is just acting as a fa√ßade for all of its realizations.
