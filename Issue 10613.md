Oops, I hadn't noticed that you posted a patch already... My version is essentially the same but a bit more verbose.

Your version is a little more useful to someone reading the installation guide, trying to figure out what to do. Let's use yours.

The SAGE_ATLAS_LIB patch still needs review, should be uncontroversial. In particular, backward compatibility is maintained.

Looks good, but one tiny grammar note: you need "It should contain" not "It should containing". That's such a tiny change that you can switch this to positive review once you fix it.
