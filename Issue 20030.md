# Issue 20030: Comparison with EmptyLetter fails

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2016-03-23 19:03:36

Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  sage-combinat aschilling bsalisbury1

Keywords: crystals

We currently have:

```
sage: C = crystals.Letters(['C',4])
sage: C(2) < C('E')
False
sage: C('E') < C(2)
# Boom
```

This is because we do not have a `_richcmp_` for `EmptyLetter`. This prevents the digraph code from drawing crystals with the empty letter (specifically KR tableaux).

You seem to have added the test

```
sage: C('E') != C(2)
True
```

twice.

Thanks. Could you please post the code for KR crystals that currently fails? I drew a KR crystals of type C and it worked fine.

You need a KR crystal with an empty letter, so it needs to be a KR tableaux which can have them, such as type D<sub>n+1</sub><sup>(2)</sup>. These all generate errors for me:

```
sage: K = crystals.KirillovReshetikhin(['D',4,2], 1,2, 'KR')
sage: view(K, tightpage=True)
sage: K = crystals.KirillovReshetikhin(['A',4,2], 1,1, 'KR')
sage: view(K, tightpage=True)
sage: K = crystals.KirillovReshetikhin(['D',4,3], 1,1, 'KR')
sage: view(K, tightpage=True)
```
