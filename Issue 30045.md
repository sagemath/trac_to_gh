Ticket #30224 fixed quietness of MPFI and NTL in `configure -q`.

This follow-up ticket deals with Symmetrica.

Before this ticket:

```
$ ./configure -q
...
[1:0:0]
[1:1:0]
[1:2:1]
...
$
```


After this ticket:

```
$ ./configure -q
$
```


This is done by changing line 18 of file `build/pkgs/symmetrica/spkg-configure.m4` as follows:

```
-            [println(b);]
+            [fprintln(stderr, b);]
```

following a suggestion by Dima Pasechnik.
