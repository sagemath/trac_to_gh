The patchbot would run as a scheduled workflow on GH Actions.

Users who fork the GitHub repo can activate the workflow by depositing a repository secret `SAGE_PATCHBOT_ENVS` of the form `ubuntu-focal-standard ubuntu-hirsute-standard ...`. The workflow would create 1 job per platform listed there and run the patchbot on a few tickets.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33253

Is this really necessary? It's running one ci tool in another one. I would say its more flexible to convert the patchbot steps into github workflows, as we have already done with the linter and #33263. This should replace the patchbots completely in the long term.
