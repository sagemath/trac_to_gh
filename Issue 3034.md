# Issue 3034: [with patches; needs review] improved cleaning code for Debian packages

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: tabbott

Original creation time: 2008-04-26 22:23:24

Assignee: tabbott

Some of the "upstream" tarballs automatically generated by sage-debsource aren't entirely clean; I've added code to run debuild clean before generating the upstream tarball.  

Also, cddlib's clean target should use distclean.

Patches look good to me and apply cleanly. Positive review.
