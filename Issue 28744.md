# Issue 28744: Bug with dimension for subschemes of products of projective spaces

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28981

Original creator: gjorgenson

Original creation time: 2020-01-10 13:11:47


```
PP.<x,y,z,a,b,c> = ProductProjectiveSpaces(QQ, [2,2])
X = PP.subscheme([x*a, x*b, x*c, y*a, y*b, y*c, z*a, z*b])
print(X.dimension())
print(X.segre_embedding().codomain().dimension())
```


Here `X.dimension()` returns 1, while `X.segre_embedding().codomain().dimension()` returns the correct answer of 0, as this subscheme is supported on a single point.

Moving tickets to milestone sage-9.2 based on a review of last modification date, branch status, and severity.

Changing keywords from "" to "subscheme".
