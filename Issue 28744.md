```
PP.<x,y,z,a,b,c> = ProductProjectiveSpaces(QQ, [2,2])
X = PP.subscheme([x*a, x*b, x*c, y*a, y*b, y*c, z*a, z*b])
print(X.dimension())
print(X.segre_embedding().codomain().dimension())
```


Here `X.dimension()` returns 1, while `X.segre_embedding().codomain().dimension()` returns the correct answer of 0, as this subscheme is supported on a single point.
