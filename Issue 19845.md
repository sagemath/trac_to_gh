# Issue 19845: zeta-expansion fails at symbolic constants

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20082

```
sage: zeta(x).series(x==pi)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: stub
```


Fixing this will also fix the computations of residues like


```
sage: (zeta(x) * 1/(1 - exp(-x))).residue(x==2*pi*I)
```
