Keywords: p-adic Gamma function

The computation of the p-adic Gamma function in both Pari and Sage uses a Mahler expansion in terms of the Dwork exponential series. The optional `algorithm` flag defaults to `pari` instead of `sage` because the implementation there has been optimized better.

However, in use cases where one needs to repeatedly evaluate Gamma for the same prime `p`, such as for the trace formula for hypergeometric motives (see #23952), it is better to cache the coefficients of the Dwork exponential rather than recomputing them. Sample output:

```
sage: p = next_prime(5000)
sage: F = Qp(p)
sage: time l1 = [F(a/(p-1)).gamma(algorithm='pari') for a in range(p-1)]
CPU times: user 6min 17s, sys: 23.2 ms, total: 6min 17s
Wall time: 6min 17s
sage: time l2 = [F(a/(p-1)).gamma(algorithm='sage') for a in range(p-1)]
CPU times: user 21.3 s, sys: 36 ms, total: 21.3 s
Wall time: 21.3 s
sage: all(l1[i] == l2[i] for i in range(p-1))
True
```

The last commit introduces another change, this one even more significant.

In the previous implementation of p-adic Gamma, there was a second `O(p)` step which essentially used the functional equation of Gamma to reduce to considering arguments divisible by `p`. However, it is far more efficient to directly apply Theorem 6.2 of FRV's book, which gives a similar formula for each residue class. Now at the cost of precomputing and storing `O(pe)` terms, one gets an `O(e)` algorithm for computing Gamma modulo `p^e`.

This is what happened when I reran my original example with the new patch:

```
sage: p = next_prime(5000)
sage: F = Qp(p)
sage: time l2 = [F(a/(p-1)).gamma(algorithm='sage') for a in range(p-1)]
CPU times: user 862 ms, sys: 23.9 ms, total: 886 ms
Wall time: 875 ms
```

Maybe taking this back upstream would result in some additional improvement?

A couple of minor modifications in the latest patch, gleaned by carefully reading profiler output. These also cover Gauss sums and hypergeometric motives, since my current interest in p-adic Gamma involves the latter.

I just made a few trivial changes. This can be set to positive if you want.

Doing so. Patchbot seems happy (one successful run and one with only an irrelevant failure).
