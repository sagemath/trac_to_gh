# Issue 19992: Improve support for sub and quotient modules over general rings

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20229

Keywords: submodules

Right now, there is no way to tell the submodule code that the lift morphism is unitriangular. Moreover, for general rings, we need a code path which constructs the rref for a basis, so we can use the unitriangular module morphism code (when we can).
