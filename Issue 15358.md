Shuffle product can be define on any iterable object so I propose to define a new class that implement an efficient shuffle product on iterables.

Currently one has two shuffle product in Sage, one is defined on words and one is defined on permutations.

The first one is slow and don't allow to compute shuffle of two list and the second is fast but only defined for Permutations.

Some benchmarks:

My Shuffle:

Time if *ShuffleProduct* inherits just of *SageObject*


```
sage: from sage.combinat.shuffle import ShuffleProduct
sage: a = Word("abcdefghij")
sage: b = Word("klmnopqrst")
sage: %time _ = list(ShuffleProduct(a, b, Word))
CPU times: user 25.88 s, sys: 1.39 s, total: 27.26 s
Wall time: 27.23 s
```


Time if *ShuffleProduct* inherits of the evil class *Parent*:


```
sage: from sage.combinat.shuffle import ShuffleProduct
sage: a = Word("abcdefghij")
sage: b = Word("klmnopqrst")
sage: %time _ = list(ShuffleProduct(a, b, Word))
CPU times: user 56.23 s, sys: 4.10 s, total: 60.33 s
Wall time: 60.58 s
```


Comparaison with *ShuffleProduct_w1w2*:


```
sage: from sage.combinat.words.shuffle_product import ShuffleProduct_w1w2 as Shuffle
sage: %time _ = list(Shuffle(a, b))
CPU times: user 59.66 s, sys: 0.29 s, total: 59.94 s
Wall time: 59.90 s
```
