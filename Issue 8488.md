I think it would be better to use the `@`wraps decorator in python, which automatically copies the documentation, etc.  Also, the source inspection probably won't work here (I haven't checked, though).  We should spruce up this decorator to follow the pattern in sage/plot/misc.py (see the `@`options or `@`suboptions decorator classes).

or even better, we should make a `@`wrap_sage decorator which does the same thing as `@`wraps and additionally does:


```
        from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getsource
        wrapper._sage_src_ = lambda: sage_getsource(func)
```


like in the sage/plot/misc.py files.

I just attached a patch which implements a "sage_wraps" decorator which mirrors the functools wraps decorator, but also adds the sage-specific _sage_src_ attribute, so that `interacts.demo??` works.

This is still "needs work", since the sage_wraps function needs some doctests.

We can now simplify the code in sage/plot/misc.py and a few other places that call the `@`wraps decorator using `@`sage_wraps.

Note that there is a bug in the ReST formatting.  After applying both patches above, `interacts.demo??` gives output that is all messed up since apparently the formatting engine doesn't deal well with the single newlines that _sage_src_() returns.  I've run out of time to try to track this down and see if it is a bug in the introspection or in the file or what.

Also, I don't think we should import library_interact into the interacts namespace.  I think interacts.<tab> should just give a list of interacts (in fact, I think it should be broken down a bit further, so that interacts.calculus.<tab> gives calculus interacts, etc.)  Note that because of wonderful namespaces, the same interact could be imported into interacts.calculus and interacts.linear_algebra, for example.

Oops, I deleted the title, instead of adding a comment, apparently.

Okay, William or Marshall, the ball's back in your court to review my patch.

REVIEW:

  * very nice using the python wrapping stuff, and making source code introspection work, in theory!

  * In practice, source code introspection does not work, though this is due to a lazy assumption *I* made I think when implementing interact in the notebook, namely I think when the notebook server sees "`@`interact" in the output, it does something funny with formatting.  Anyway, if you try:

```
interacts.calculus.taylor_polynomial??
```

in a cell then shift-enter, you'll see the source is all on one long line, which isn't good.  That said, fixing this shouldn't be part of this patch, since it's a very different issue in the sage notebook itself, and maybe quite tricky to deal with.

   * Important. Try this in an input cell:

```
interacts.calculus.[tab]
```

Instead of getting *one* thing, you get 15.  This *has* to be fixed. 

   * Otherwise, I'm happy with this patch.

Ah, that makes sense.  I saw this, and even started writing a ticket for it, but I couldn't reproduce it with anything besides the interact stuff (see my comment above about ReST formatting), and then I ran out of time.

I'm attaching a new patch which takes care of the namespace issue you mentioned.Â  Basically, I lump everything into a library file, and then just import into calculus.py the actual interact. I'm sure there's a fancy object we could make that would nicely categorize everything, but this quick solution takes advantage of the nice namespace framework we already have.

FYI, I'm leaving it to you to set "positive review" after my last patch, if you're still happy.

When I apply this, I get a new doctest failure:

```
**********************************************************************
File "/Applications/sage_builds/sage-4.4.alpha0/devel/sage-new/sage/symbolic/ring.pyx", line 443:
    sage: SR.symbol() # temporary variable
Expected:
    symbol160
Got:
    symbol162
**********************************************************************
```

I don't know why these patches cause this file to file.  Can we just change "160" to "162"?

Yes.  It's just some internal counter.   That's a stupid doctest though, since an unrelated change anywhere else in Sage could break it.  Can you change the output to

   symbol...

?
