OpenSuSE's stock gcc5 errors out with

Can you please post the complete log for the failed build, as well as the list of environment variables (shown in `install.log` for example)?

This doesn't look related to Singular or Givaro at all. The offending line is

```
#include <omp.h>
```

Please try this (from a Sage shell to be safe):

```
g++ --version
```

and

```
echo '#include <omp.h>' | g++ -x c++ - -c -o test.o
```

xzipped install.log

Actually a new install only got until ecl. I remember working around by using gcc6 first until that fails then switching. I still provide the log for the env you requested but can give you a suitable log only when I get over the ecl problem.

This was after distclean and with -j1.

See maybe https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/_doJLj5GIEU for the ecl problem (which is totally unrelated to this ticket, please create a new ticket if you want to discuss it further).

Well, that unfortunately doesn't help. I need more data to understand the cause of the problem.

What do you need? In what way is the given solution not proper if you need more info?

The cause of the problem. I need to understand _why_ those files need `-std=c++11`. Any why did you add `-std=c++11` to those 2 files? That seems like a totally arbitrary choice to me.

It's a bad idea to "fix" a problem without understanding it. Otherwise, you might be hiding the problem instead of actually fixing it. When the problem comes back in the future, it might be even harder to fix because of an improper fix.

Because compilation stopped at those files and because adding it made compilation work.

I agree but don't have the illusion you ultimately understand what's going on. You always test hypotheses with a limited number of experiments so you can only reject not accept one with 100 percent certainty.

I don't buy this. For very subtle (possibly non-reproducible) errors, you might be right. But this ticket looks rather easy to understand.

_Something_ requires C++11. From reading the error message, it should be easy to figure out which line in which source file actually requires it. Play with that line to understand things better... try to reduce the file to a simple test-case... look at the pre-processed source... figure out what's different on your system...

Any news here? Is there still an issue?

The latter can only be answered by someone on OpenSuSE using their gcc.

For portability testing on opensuse, see #29527.
