But it's the end of the quarter here, I have final exams to prepare, etc., so I don't have any more time to work on this now.

I do **not** see this problem on a build where SAGE64 was not set. 


```

This was a 32-bit build on OpenSolaris 06/2009. 

What system was the problem noticed? Was SAGE64 set?

This was on `sage.math.washington.edu`, a Ubuntu Linux x86_64 system.  I did not set `SAGE64`.
