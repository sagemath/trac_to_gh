The one case that prints nothing for an empty partition is `global_options(display="diagram")`

```
sage: Partition([])._repr_diagram()
''
```

Is this what you wanted?  `PartitionTuple` displays `-` for an empty partition.  Otherwise, I've had a look, tested as much as I could, and am willing to set to positive review.
