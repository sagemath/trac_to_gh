```
sage: Partitions.global_options('exp_high')
sage: latex(Partition([])) # Boom
sage: Partitions.global_options('exp_low')
sage: latex(Partition([])) # Returns the empty string

```

There are likely others.

Andrew, just to let you know, I've also changed the repr output for exp of partitions:

```
sage: print Partition([])._repr_exp_low()
-
sage: print Partition([])._repr_compact_low()
-
```

Changing status from new to needs_review.

The one case that prints nothing for an empty partition is `global_options(display="diagram")`

```
sage: Partition([])._repr_diagram()
''
```

Is this what you wanted?  `PartitionTuple` displays `-` for an empty partition.  Otherwise, I've had a look, tested as much as I could, and am willing to set to positive review.

Good point. Probably best to display something.
