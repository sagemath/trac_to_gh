We use a direct implementation that is way faster than NetworkX.

Before:

```
sage: %timeit graphs.GridGraph([2,3,4])
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.44 ms per loop
```


After:

```
sage: %timeit graphs.GridGraph([2,3,4])
10000 loops, best of 3: 209 Âµs per loop
```


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19252

Hello, 

there is a broken doctest in `boost_graph.pyx`. And your graph is empty on the list `[1,1]`. Once this is fixed, you can set the ticket to `positive_review`.
