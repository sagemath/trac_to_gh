# Issue 19015: Faster GridGraph generator

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19252

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2015-09-20 08:41:56

We use a direct implementation that is way faster than NetworkX.

Before:

```
sage: %timeit graphs.GridGraph([2,3,4])
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.44 ms per loop
```


After:

```
sage: %timeit graphs.GridGraph([2,3,4])
10000 loops, best of 3: 209 Âµs per loop
```

The `basic.py` file needs more documentation cleaning since many plot tests use networkx when it is not necessary. May be in another ticket.

Hello, 

there is a broken doctest in `boost_graph.pyx`. And your graph is empty on the list `[1,1]`. Once this is fixed, you can set the ticket to `positive_review`.

Sorry, after pushing this commit, I realized that something was missing.
Corrections are on the way.

I have added doctests for trivial cases, and I'm now calling path and grid2d methods when appropriate to get position of vertices.

Should now be properly working.
Thanks,
David.

Arg no. Broken doctest. The same.
