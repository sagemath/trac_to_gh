Hi Antoine! I think that to make this works, you need to implement the `characteristic` method of a ring over a base.

I investigated a bit further and, to make your above code work, I think that you simply need to implement the characteristic method for the class `sage.rings.ring_extensions.RingExtension_generic`:


```python
    def characteristic(self):
        return self._backend.characteristic()
```


I cc'ed Xavier here because he implemented extensions of rings and therefore he might know a better way to solve this.

Very minor detail: in the output field you could write instead

```
A prime number or zero.
```

Also, I think that sometimes it is acceptable to omit the output field in the documentation when the output is relatively straightforward (but you can keep it like that, it's perfectly fine too).

If you are happy with your changes you can put your ticket in "need review". The next step would be to wait for the build actions to finish.

I am so stupid.

> Also, I think that sometimes it is acceptable to omit the output field in the documentation when the output is relatively straightforward (but you can keep it like that, it's perfectly fine too).

I think this can help resolve any ambiguities.

Thanks a lot; it was mostly your work (comment [comment:2]).

Maybe, you should also have an example `B.over(A)` where `A` and `B` have different characteristic.
For example, I suggest to replace your last example by


```
    sage: E = Fp(7).over(ZZ)
    sage: E.characteristic()
    7
```


Also you should add a doctest (in the section TESTS) demonstrating that the bug noticed in this ticket is fixed.
