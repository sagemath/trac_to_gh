Just to make Sage development easier. Imagine the following situation:
* You test this ticket
* You are done with reviewing this ticket, so you checkout some other branch
* That branch has IPython 3.x
* Sage breaks because `path.py` 8.1 is still installed

This actually happened to me. It's nothing serious, but it's at least annoying.

It has some merit. For big review like this one I create a clone first and build it from scratch, no other branch present unless I test a follow up ticket. I probably should do a build of this on my mac.
