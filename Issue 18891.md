Could you explain the rational for `path.py` a little bit more clearly? Why do we need a version that is compatible with `ipython-3.x`?

Just to make Sage development easier. Imagine the following situation:
* You test this ticket
* You are done with reviewing this ticket, so you checkout some other branch
* That branch has IPython 3.x
* Sage breaks because `path.py` 8.1 is still installed

This actually happened to me. It's nothing serious, but it's at least annoying.

It has some merit. For big review like this one I create a clone first and build it from scratch, no other branch present unless I test a follow up ticket. I probably should do a build of this on my mac.

I intentionally don't do this, just because it highlights issues like these.

All tests passed on OS X. Something odd that happened before (a long time ago) running the test with `nohup` just hung. 

```
nohup ./sage -t --long --all &
```

it just sit idle on my mac. I have not tested on a linux machine yet.
