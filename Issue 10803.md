# Issue 10803: QQbar does not contain numbers which might be algebraic

For example:

sage: (e + pi) in QQbar
False

When e + pi may, in fact, be algebraic.

The `in` operator has a specific meaning for `QQbar`, namely `x in QQbar iff x == QQbar(x)`.  I don't think that this is an actual bug.

I think you're correct; I see this in the docstring. Sorry about the noise.
