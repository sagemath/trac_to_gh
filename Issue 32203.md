Keywords: power series, shifting, precision

Example:


```sage
sage: R.<y> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, implementation='pari')
sage: (y + O(y^7)).shift(1)
y^2 + O(y^8)
sage: (y + O(y^7)) << 1
y^2 + O(y^7)
sage: (y + O(y^7)).shift(-1)
1 + O(y^6)
sage: (y + O(y^7)) >> 1
1 + O(y^7)
```


One weird consequence of this is the following:

```sage
sage: L.<x> = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ, implementation='pari')
sage: f = x + O(x^7)
sage: f
x + O(x^7)
sage: f.power_series()
x + O(x^6)
sage: f.power_series().laurent_series()
x + O(x^6)
```


It's not hard to imagine how this can lead to mathematically incorrect results.

add one empty line between

```
+        Right-shift this power series by `n`, i.e., divide by `t^n`.
+        Terms below `t^n` are discarded.
