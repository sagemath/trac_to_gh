# Issue 14108: degree of number field polynomial is python int

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: polynomial degree int integer number field


```
sage: for R in [QQ, ZZ, RR, CC, NumberField(x^2+1,'a')]:
....:     print type(polygen(R).degree())
....:     
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
<type 'int'>
<type 'int'>
<type 'int'>
<type 'int'>
```

At least these should be the same for QQ and K. I would prefer Integer.

You can replace

```
cdef Integer OUT = PY_NEW(Integer)
mpz_set_si(OUT.value, IN)
return OUT
```

by

```
return smallInteger(IN)
```

after adding this:

```
from sage.rings.integer cimport smallInteger
```

Does it pass `make ptest`? If yes, you can set this to positive_review.

Thanks for having a look.

So let us wait for the bot..

Is my change for RR correct ? I changed a cpdef to a def, it may not be a good idea ?

Replying to [comment:12 chapoton]:

1. Everywhere else it's already a Python (`def`) method.
2. If you want something fast, use the `_degree` attribute.

So I don't see any problem.
