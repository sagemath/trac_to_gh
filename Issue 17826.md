Uniform random generation of GT triangles are useful for testing conjectures on ASMs, SSYTs and elsewhere.
I have some initial code for this.

1) Doc-build yelled at me for trying to add a reference that was already included somewhere else, so I guess you were right to leave it out. I may still tweak the documentation a little, so that the mention of Propp's algorithm and the fact that it gives a uniformly random Gelfand-Tsetlin pattern is also attached to random_element() so it shows up in the built reference documents, not just attached to a helper method you can only see in the source code.

2) The algorithm will loop indefinitely if self is empty, so it now raises an error if your input has a combination of k,n,and strict that will yield no Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns (k<0 if not strict, k+1<n if strict).

3) random_element() now returns a 'Gelfand-Tsetlin pattern' (in the sage data type sense), rather than just the underlying list of lists.

I'm ok with a positive review, pending you checking my modifications.

That makes sense

Your code and documentation looks great, an improvement, and still generates uniformly.

I'm setting it to positive_review.  Hopefully that is the correct protocol.
