The following can happen on some hardware architectures due to fused multiply-add instructions:

```
sage: x = CDF(0.99, 0.2)
sage: x * x.conj()
1.0201 + 1.1102230246251575e-19*I
```


It's annoying because it causes doctest failures, for example

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 62.3 src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx

Isn't this sacrificing a lot of numerical performance? At least IEEE 754-2008 contains fused multiply-add.

The doctest is

```
            sage: x = var('x', domain='real')
            sage: s = abs((1+I*x)^4); s
            (I*x + 1)^2*(-I*x + 1)^2
            sage: s._plot_fast_callable(x)
            <sage.ext.interpreters.wrapper_py.Wrapper_py object at ...>
            sage: s._plot_fast_callable(x)(10)
            10201
            sage: abs((I*10+1)^4)
            10201
            sage: plot(s)
            Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
```

Isn't the real problem that abs does not default to `hold=True`

```
sage: ((1+I*x)^4).abs()
(I*x + 1)^2*(-I*x + 1)^2
```

so something that ought to be manifestly real is not. Compare:

```
sage: abs((1+I*x)^4)._plot_fast_callable(x)(RDF(10))
10201.00000000001
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.complex_double.ComplexDoubleElement'>
```

vs.

```
sage: ((1+I*x)^4).abs(hold=True)._plot_fast_callable(x)(RDF(10))
10201.000000000005
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.real_double.RealDoubleElement'>
```

I'm not sure.

* Blas are more than happy to use FMA, so //if// we make guarantees for scalars then they'll most likely be broken by diagonal matrices, say. 

What I am pretty sure about is: multiplying `x*x.conj()` as complex numbers is a bad way of evaluating the absolute value. Fast callables using abs should return real and not complex values. And for that we need to hold abs. At which point the issue of the numerical noise in the imaginary part is pretty meaningless.

Volker's point is about being "manifestly" real, which means: an expression which will always give a real result when evaluated, even if sub-expressions introduce numerical noise.

An expression like

```
e^(4*I*x) + e^(-4*I*x)
```

is not manifestly real, since there is no guarantee that the imaginary parts of the two terms will *exactly* cancel out.

Is this decidable without expansion? Simply weeding out rational exponents will make `(I<sup>(5/4))*(I</sup>(3/4))` a false negative. OTOH first expanding then checking would be costly.

If so, I no longer think it useful.

Even with expansion I think it can be difficult to tell if a radical is real or not; Cardano's formula which can't be written in real radicals even if the roots are real comes to mind.

Of course it **is** possible to decide if a radical is real or not, for example using QQbar.

Can't we just `abs(hold=True)` by default? You can always simplify or set `hold=False` if you don't want that.
