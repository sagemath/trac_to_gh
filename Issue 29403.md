From README.md:

  The Sage Library is GPLv2+, and included packages have [compatible OSS

  have contributed code to Sage. In many cases, documentation for modules
  and functions list the authors.

where developers' contributions to Sage can be seen (including maintenance of spkgs - see #29636):

 - Changelogs
 - some Trac searches
 - ...

Should the main header instead read

```diff
-# Authors of SageMath #
