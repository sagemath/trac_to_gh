# Issue 27555: RIF encapusulated in SR fails comprison is_zero()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27792

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2019-05-07 11:53:52

We have

```
sage: SR(RIF(-1,1)).is_zero()
...
TypeError: 
```

I.e. it fails with an error saying absolutely nothing.

This is somehow surprising as 

```
sage: RIF(-1,1).is_zero()
False
```

works

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
