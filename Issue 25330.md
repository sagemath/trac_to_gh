I'm experiencing a giac test failure when I update the pari nix package. I'm not sure yet if its actually caused by the pari update, the giac test suite seems somewhat non-deterministic. I'll investigate and report upstream if it is relevant.

Did you report that upstream?

I analyzed the problem and the problem happens because the output of `isprime(p, 1)` changed from returning a primality certificate to a boolean answer. There is now a separate function `primecert()` for getting a certificate.

The test directly checks the PARI interface, but otherwise these primality certificates are not used by anything in giac. So while the test fails, nothing else in giac should fail because of this.

The only contact info I found was that [forum](https://xcas.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/forum/) and I'm still waiting for my account to be approved. I think I accidentally chose the wrong option at the age question (doesn't help that the forum is in french). I sent an email to the administrators, no reply yet.

If you want to try, maybe you have more luck. I wish they'd just use some issue tracker or plain old email.

More generally, their website is a mess... Even finding the source tarballs is hard. And that page has `debian` in its name even though these are just the sources: https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/debian/dists/stable/main/source/

I just recall now that `@`frederichan is a Giac developer and usually all bug reports from Sage go through him. ​Frederic: if you missed the discussion, the upgrade to PARI/GP breaks one test from Giac:

As this example is just calling the pari function, patching the output with the new behaviour looks natural, something like this?

Just a general reply:

- look at the diff and see whether it makes sense.
- Sage cares a lot about tests, so check whether the code is well tested.
- check the patchbot (the colored blob at the top of the page).
- maybe try a few examples, test corner cases in the code.
- if all is well: set the ticket to positive_review and add your real name as Reviewer on the Trac page. At that point, the release manager will merge the ticket in some later beta/rc release (assuming that all dependencies are merged).

In this case, this is a package upgrade, which is a bit different. The patchbot doesn't test it, so somebody should manually run the full Sage testsuite. If you want to take my word for it, I did that and tests passed.

For a sage package where you always have pari you may decide to suppress it.

NB: if you plan to upgrade giac package, 1.4.6.69 is not enough to fix #25822 but the next stable should be.

Did that. While I won't pretend all the math, the changes look very reasonable to me. No obviously wrong results and I think we can trust pari with the details.

Two things that stuck out to me though:


```
sage: a.multiplicative_order()
-        4547473508864641189575195312
+        189478062869360049565633138
```



```
             sage: O3.absolute_discriminant()
-            8643600
+            400160824478095086350656915693814563600
```


I would've thought that both the multiplicative order and the absolute discriminant are supposed to be unique. But again, my knowledge is limited.

> - Sage cares a lot about tests, so check whether the code is well tested.

check

Oh, I've always wondered what exactly the patchbot is everybody is talking about.

But can anybody just do that?

Why doesn't the patchbot test package upgrades? I think if we can just take anybody's word for it, its probably yours.

A very brittle test suite is at risk of just being ignored after a few false-positives. I think a few high-value tests are way more valuable than testing the literal output of every function. Sage has a bit of the same problem in my opinion.

For now I just did `echo > check/chk_fhan11`. Its not that easy to disable an individual test.

The multiplicative order is certainly unique, but the *element* `a` that we're taking the order of is different.

In the second case, I changed the test input because PARI got more clever in computing orders. We need the large primes `1000003` and `1000099` to make it more difficult for PARI to accidentally find the maximal order.

It's what Sage uses for continuous integration. It's far from perfect and there is a proposal to replace it: #24854

> But can anybody just do that?

Yes, anybody can do that. This process seems to be working fine.

> Why doesn't the patchbot test package upgrades?

Good question actually, I don't know the answer.

`command="gp --fast --emacs --quiet --stacksize %s"%stacksize`
so that relies on picking up gp from Sage's path.

sage sets its `PATH` in `sage-env`. After setting that it sources `~/.sage/sagerc` if available. So if you create that file with the following contents:


```
export PATH="<insert path to local build of gp here>/bin:$PATH"
```


sage should pick up your gp since it is first in PATH.

>   2. Is the version going to be updated regularly to the current development version of pari?

I don't think that is a good idea. Development versions are not for "production" use. Instead you could ask upstream for a release or suggest to them to release bugfixes in point releases.
