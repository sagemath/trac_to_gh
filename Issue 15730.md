Note that it should not be used.
I tried to craft a minimally modified dylib Makefile.
No idea if it has any chance to work.
And I forgot to fill in the branch name so you may not have been aware of that...

Anyway I agree that autotoolizing might be a good idea.
That's what MinGW and Cygwin do.
It's just it was more complicated to setup, test quickly.

TO be completely clear on what was done, this  branch use the aforementioned suse patch, with a few slight modifications:
* update version numbers in configure.ac to 1.0.6 (there was a discrepancy in the file of the patch itself, surely introduced when the version was bumped from 1.0.5 to 1.0.6 or stg like that),
* replace the libtool init macro AC_PROG_LIBTOOL by the correct one: LT_INIT with the win32-dll (I'm quite convincded the option does next to nothing but autotools doc says to add it).
* do not include the autogen.sh file, anyway one should use the spkg-src instead and note that does slightly different things.
