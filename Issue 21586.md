After


```
P = Posets.BooleanLattice(3)
_ = P.is_pseudocomplemented()
P = Posets.BooleanLattice(9)
_ = P.meet_matrix()
_ = P.join_matrix()
```


without this patch:


```
sage: timeit('P.is_pseudocomplemented()')
5 loops, best of 3: 143 ms per loop
```


after this patch:


```
sage: timeit('P.is_pseudocomplemented()')
125 loops, best of 3: 4.09 ms per loop
```

Frédéric, can you check the reference? I found it from http://cams.ehess.fr/docannexe.php?id=1111, but do not understand French.

proof seems ok to me

it says that the pseucomplement of x is the meet of the pseudocomplements of the atoms below x

proof is very simple, take 7 lines at start of proof of Theoreme 3.3 page 96

You just need 3 French words : évident = obvious, montrer = show, implique = implies

Good point. This should work, but takes time to compile... How to doc-compile only master references file?
