giacpy.pyx fail to be cythonized in sage 7.2.rc1

```
Error compiling Cython file:
------------------------------------------------------------
...
     g=(g*M+gen(<long long>i))
     a=a-(i<<size)

   g=g*gen(<long long>(1<<size))+gen(<long long> a)
   if aneg:
     g=-g
      ^
------------------------------------------------------------

giacpy.pyx:5112:7: Invalid operand type for '-' (gen)
Compiling giacpy.pyx because it changed.
