# Issue 31587: Optional transparency in plot()

Keywords: plot, graphics, transparency, dark

Having an option to have opaque backgrounds for plot() would be nice, as it causes problems with dark-themed editors and dark themed pretty much anything that displays it (websites, applications etc.).

See https://ask.sagemath.org/question/56826/background-for-plot-should-include-axes-and-labels/ for an example.
