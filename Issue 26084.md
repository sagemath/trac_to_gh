# Issue 26084: py3: hodgepodge of (mostly) trivial doctest fixes

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26321

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-09-20 15:55:45

Just adding more fixes from my python3 branch.

There's no unifying theme to these fixes except that they are mostly either tests that fail due to trivial output differences, or that make no sense on Python 3 in the first place (e.g. having to do with `long`, or old-style classes, etc.)

If any of them need a closer look I'm happy to split them out, but I don't think most of them are very interesting.

likely to conflict with #26316

Could you please split at least the misc/ part into another ticket ?

In #26212, one tries to organise the work folder by folder.

Yes, I've also tried to do things mostly on a basis of top-level sub-packages.  In this case there were just so many, and most of them very small (like, one liners) that I didn't feel like making a bunch of tickets.

I could split the misc/ ones off, but what about the others?  It still doesn't really solve the problem.

I think for the one in `sage.algebras.commutative_dga` I prefer the approach of testing the two cases separately, rather than cutting off most of the contents of the exception message.  But I can rebase on top of #26316 and adjust that.

Well, sure, there was just a new release so I guess that may be.

I have split off the changes in misc, see #26390

I am assuming #26390 is a dependency. LGTM.
