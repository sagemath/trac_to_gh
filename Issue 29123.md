# Issue 29123: change_ring() should preserve sparsity of vectors and vector spaces

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29360

Original creator: @mwageringel

```
sage: vector(QQ, 10, {0:1}, sparse=True).change_ring(AA).is_sparse()  # should be True
False
sage: VectorSpace(QQ, 10, sparse=True).change_ring(RR).is_sparse()  # should be True
False
```

The analogous methods for matrices work correctly.
