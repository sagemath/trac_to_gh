I have failed to make this work. The problem is that using either "`__richcmp__`" or ("`__eq__`" and "`__ne__`") in the generic class breaks the comparison by Id in the pseudo-Conway subclass.

Your patch touches a lot of lines with unrelated cleanup. It would be good to clearly identify the non-working part and perhaps make a separate ticket for that.

Yes, I thought it would be easy, so I took the opportunity for a little cleanup. Sadly, turning to richcmp was not easy...

Did you try putting `WithEqualityById` at the first inherited class so it is higher up in the MRO? If the decorator is well-behaved with subclasses, then I think this should work without having to (re)do an `__eq__()`.
