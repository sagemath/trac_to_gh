The tests pass on my machine with 7.6.beta6. The documentation looks fine as well. No idea what the quasar bot is up to.

The I believe it is a good idea to raise an error for such a behaviour.

Then, let's restrict the usage of the symbolic ring with polyhedron.

If it ever happens that there is a use case of the symbolic ring, we may consider adapting it properly then.

In this setup I would not call the backend generic, because it does not provide the principal reason to use it: irrational exact values.

What about `irrational_exact` ?
