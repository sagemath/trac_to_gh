Keywords: threejs, polyhedron, polytope

When visualizing polyhedra with `threejs`, the edges are missing:


```
sage: p = polytopes.icosahedron()
sage: p.plot()
Launched html viewer for Graphics3d Object 
```


but


```
sage: icosahedron()
```


seems to have the edges.

During the cleanup while adding [mesh plots](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28343) I overlooked this index that needed to be changed. Oops!
