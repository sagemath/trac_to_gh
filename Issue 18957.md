# Issue 18957: inconsistencies with dbgprinttree of functions

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2015-09-12 14:33:25


```
sage: f=function('f')(x)
sage: f._dbgprint()
f(x)
sage: f._dbgprinttree()
f(x)sa(sin(x))._dbgprinttree()             <=========== sic!
function sin `@`0x38eccd0, hash=0x7fff, flags=0x3, nops=1
    x (symbol) `@`0x2a00bf0, serial=6, hash=0x4eb55146, flags=0xf, domain=0
    =====
sage: (f(x))._dbgprinttree()
/home/ralf/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py:3035: DeprecationWarning: Substitution using function-call syntax and unnamed arguments is deprecated and will be removed from a future release of Sage; you can use named arguments instead, like EXPR(x=..., y=...)
See http://trac.sagemath.org/5930 for details.
  exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)
f(x)sage: (f(x))
f(x)
```

So a newline is missing somewhere and user-defined functions have no debug output at all.

Doctests all pass. Since this ticket just adds a doctest, it looks good to go.
