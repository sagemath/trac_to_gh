```
sage: f=function('f')(x)
sage: f._dbgprint()
f(x)
sage: f._dbgprinttree()
f(x)sa(sin(x))._dbgprinttree()             <=========== sic!
function sin @0x38eccd0, hash=0x7fff, flags=0x3, nops=1
    x (symbol) @0x2a00bf0, serial=6, hash=0x4eb55146, flags=0xf, domain=0

sage: (f(x))._dbgprinttree()
/home/ralf/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py:3035: DeprecationWarning: Substitution using function-call syntax and unnamed arguments is deprecated and will be removed from a future release of Sage; you can use named arguments instead, like EXPR(x=..., y=...)

  exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)
f(x)sage: (f(x))
f(x)
```

So a newline is missing somewhere and user-defined functions have no debug output at all.
