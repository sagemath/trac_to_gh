# Issue 17170: Replace R[x] by R['x'] in doctests

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17407

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2014-11-27 10:10:26

This ticket is split off from #10483 and contains the trivial doctest fixes such that we can concentrate on the less trivial stuff in #10483.

That was too fast for me, I had a commit for #10483 in the works. I'll append the missing doctest fixes from  #10483 here.

Since I created this ticket specifically to treat only the easy trivial cases, I undid some of your changes (I'll add them to #10483 immediately).

Positive_review to the rest.

Don't review your own patches :-)

Can you please remove these changes:

```
sage: J = ZZ['x'].ideal(7,x)
```

and

```
sage: a = QQ[I]['x'](x)
```

For the `french_book` tests, it's probably better to keep the tests and simply add the deprecation message in #10483. So you should also remove those changes from this ticket.

`git ci` tells me `Your branch is based on 'trac/76c34e825a2381a7517b33c312ef9a06309866a8', but the upstream is gone.`. So I guess Volker wants to encourage squashing of commits ;)

I have no idea what that means, are you unable to push your branch to trac?

Volker confused me with taking back the 'fixed'.
