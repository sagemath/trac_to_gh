This is based of previous work available from
     http://www.mail-archive.com/sage-support`@`googlegroups.com/msg21326.html
but supporting now integration on real intervals and real sets.

Laurent Claessens defined a class Interval that represents an interval (can be open, closed, half open, unbounded), and implemented union() and intersection() methods, as well as the __contains__() method that tests if a number is contained in the interval. Also defined the class ContinuousSet represening finite union and intersections of intervals by a list of disjoint intervals, and for this class ContinuousSet, union() and __contain__() methods were implemented.

We extend the previous work of Laurent Claessens defining the class RealSet, that describes any real set as a list of disjoint intervals and a list of isolated points.  We define the class RInterval of real intervals. A RInterval is now a RealSet, consituted as a list of disjoint intervals with a unique element and an empty list of isolated points. Our class RInterval is now always an open interval. The boundary/ies can be added as isolated point/s if necessary, constituting a RealSet.

For the class RealSet, we implement the intersection(), union() and __contain__(). We implement the function 'subsets' that, given two different real sets A and B, returns if A is a (proper) subset of B, and the function 'setdiff' that returns the difference of two given real sets. We implement also the infimum and the supremum of a RealSet. 

Also we support definite integration over a RealSet.

Is `+` what we're looking for here?   Maybe something like `u` or `U`?  Just worried about the difference between this "sum" and the Minkowski sum (which is, in fact, already in Sage).

In fact, maybe these should inherit from something related to that... probably not, but just raising the possibility.

How do I get more exotic sets like the union of `1/n` for positive integer n?  ;-)

It think it is better to stick to the category of finite unions of intervals and points, then with functions defined on such sets and their periodic extensions (like 1 on [0, 1], 0 on (1,2), then extend periodically in one or both directions to get square wave).

Things with infinite unions lead to accumulation points and cannot really be handled in a uniform way, I suspect.

It fails in OSX 10.7.5 too.
The error seems to be in the comparation involving one `sage.rings.real_lazy.LazyWrapper` instance:

```
sage: s1 = RealSet(0,2) + RealSet.unbounded_above_closed(10);  s1
(0, 2) + [10, +oo)
sage: s2 = RealSet(1,3) + RealSet.unbounded_below_closed(-10);  s2
(-oo, -10] + (1, 3)
sage: s1.intersection(s2)
(-oo, -10] + (1, 2)
```
Not right. Look at the intersection of the first intervals:

```
sage: i1 = s1._intervals[0]; i1
(0, 2)
sage: i2 = s2._intervals[0]; i2
(-oo, -10]
sage: i1.intersection(i2)
(-oo, -10]
```
Wrong. Compare the bounds:

```
sage: (i1._lower, i2._lower)
(0, -Infinity)
sage: cmp(i1._lower, i2._lower)
-1
sage: i1._lower < i2._lower
True
```
It doesn't fail for floats or integers:

```
sage: 0.0 < i2._lower
False
sage: type(i1._lower), type(i2._lower)
(sage.rings.real_lazy.LazyWrapper, sage.rings.infinity.MinusInfinity)
```

I don't like this change:

```diff
+        elif isinstance(x, sage.rings.real_mpfi.RealIntervalFieldElement):
+            if x.upper().is_infinity() or x.lower().is_infinity():
                 return self.gen()
```
since `RIF(0, oo)` gets turned into infinity (where is very likely to not be):

```
sage: UnsignedInfinityRing(RIF(2, oo))
Infinity
```
I think we should follow the usual paradigm for RIF:

```
sage: RIF(2, 4) == 4
False
sage: RIF(2, 4) <= 4
True
sage: RIF(2, 4) < 4
False
sage: RIF(2) == 2
True
```
So I would say this is wrong:

```
sage: RIF(2, oo) == oo
True
```
and I would raise an error anytime we're converting something which is not directly equal to a (signed) infinity. For example:

```
sage: UnsignedInfinityRing(RIF(2, oo))
Infinity
```
should raise an error, but this would be okay:

```
sage: UnsignedInfinityRing(RIF(oo, oo))
Infinity
```

I'm mostly happy with the fixes related to infinity, although we are nowhere close to fixing all the bugs in #11506.  Of the examples listed there, the following one is changed by this ticket:

```
sage: InfinityRing(CC(oo))
A positive finite number
```
This used to return `+Infinity`, which is not perfect either, but is at least consistent with `InfinityRing(UnsignedInfinity(oo))`.  (I'd argue that both of these should probably be undefined, since complex and unsigned infinity are in no way more positive than negative.)

Could you fix the above example to return `+Infinity` again?

I leave it to someone else to review the new code for real sets.  It would have been better if the infinity-related stuff had been done on a separate ticket.
