CC:  @kiwifb

The interaction between GLPK error handling and verbose output should be doctested. This would break without the custom `have_error.patch` for GLPK in Sage.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20832

Positive review, though I personally would think it would be better to test whether there is *some* output rather than test for specific output, which might change whenever a new version of GLPK is installed.

Replying to [comment:3 mkoeppe]:
> it would be better to test whether there is *some* output

How would you write the doctest then? The ellipsis `...` matches the empty string, so you need to write at least some part of the verbose output in the doctest.
