1 if (x-y).is_square() else -1

instead of 

```
2*((x-y).is_square()-.5)
```


much more readable too... ;-)

```

by the way, `bool` is only a smaller part of the slowness:

```
sage: timeit('matrix(ZZ, [[1 if (x-y).is_square() else -1 for x in K_list] for y in K_list])')
25 loops, best of 3: 27.9 ms per loop
sage: timeit('matrix(ZZ, [[2*((x-y).is_square()-5) for x in K_list] for y in K_list])')
5 loops, best of 3: 57.1 ms per loop
sage: timeit('matrix(ZZ, [[2*((x-y).is_square()-.5) for x in K_list] for y in K_list])')
5 loops, best of 3: 265 ms per loop
```

appearance of `float` causes most of the slowness.

the only possible source of randomness here I can imagine is in the construction of
the finite fields. But if you add `conway=True` then it's deterministic for sure, for Conway polynomial is unique for any given order...
