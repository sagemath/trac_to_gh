Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  sage-combinat nborie

Keywords: categories, enumerated sets

The patch, under development on the sage-combinat patch server, creates the category `GradedEnumeratedSets`, and puts Partitions() into it.

As an example, this also implements `WeightedIntegerVectors(weights)` (whose graded compontents are the previously existing `WeightedIntegerVectors(n, weights)`).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10193

It seems like it would be better to use degree as opposed to size for consistency with the "standard" graded things.  Also, it seems like it might be better to have the degree method implemented on the parents.  It could be somewhat confusing if the degree method on the elements corresponded to a different grading than the parent it belongs to.

Hey,

A few comments/questions:

- I prefer the name `GradedSets` over `SetsWithGrading`, it's a more natural name to me.
- The example, I don't think there should be the need for another `NonNegativeIntegers` class. Can't we just use the existing `sage.sets.NonNegativeIntegers` with the required methods and placed in this category?
- Similar to above, I'd like to see all sets which belong actually into this category. Or at least a few more of the big classes.
- Grade should be implemented as an abstract Element method
- I don't like the default implementation of `graded_component()` since it assumes the first argument of subset (which may not be implemented) is the graded component. If you want to use the `subset()` method, you should call it with `self.subset(grade=grade)`.
- It's not well documented what methods must be implemented. The "automatic" way is to make them ``@`abstract_method`s.

Here's also some more wish-list type things that I'd like to see, but can wait for a followup ticket:

- Simple API for grading shifts
- Checking that morphisms preserve grading
- Make `degree()` call `grade()` (thus act like an alias, unfortunately in categories you can't simply make an alias by `degree = grade` [it will reference the wrong function]).

Thanks,

Travis
