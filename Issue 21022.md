# Issue 21022: Karatsuba based methods in Skew Polynomials

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21259

We propose additional methods in the `cdef class SkewPolynomial_finite_field_dense` for improved multiplication and division of ring elements. We also propose a new class `cdef class SkewPolynomial_finite_field_karatsuba` to handle the basic skew polynomial operations in the finite field case. 

Note: The original ticket #13215 first introduced this functionality. That was subsequently modified to support the basic implementation of skew polynomials and the karatsuba based methods from that ticket that were removed are being reintroduced here.

Note that the current code is more or less just what was in the original patch for #13215 related to Karatsuba multiplication/division. No effort has e.g. been made yet to accommodate for changes in #13215 since this addition was factored out.
