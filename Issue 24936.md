it would be nice to have some of the combinatorics of highest weight words of representations of classical Lie algebras accessible.  I have some code, but I do not know where to put it and how to organise it well.  In particular, I have done everything for GL(n) and bits and pieces for the other two.

* GL(n):

  - Stembridge's staircase tableaux for tensor products of the vector representation and its dual, and, as a special case alternating tableaux for the adjoint representation
  - Kuperberg's webs for rank 2, using the growth algorithm of Khovanov and Kuperberg
  - promotion using van Leeuwen's local rules

* Sp(2n):

  - all of the above for oscillating tableaux
  - additionally Sundaram's algorithm, associating an n-symplectic Littlewood Richardson tableau and a standard Young tableau with an oscillating tableau

* SO(2n+1):

  - all of what's available for GL(n), for vacillating tableaux
  - additionally Braunsteiner's algorithm for SO(3), associating an orthogonal Littlewood Richardson tableau and a standard Young tableau with a vacillating tableau

I am working on this, we should talk. I have implemented oscillating tableaux but not the other two cases.

Please be warned that this code was written for personal usage...

I also have an implementation for Judith's SO(3) algorithm, but this will soon be obsolete.

I would like to see staircase tableaux and alternating tableaux included in the framework of
ticket #25434. This was on my list of things I wanted to do but I have not started on this.

I have done some work on Oscillating Tableaux.

Sundaram's algorithm for oscillating tableaux is partially covered by the growth diagram framework (in `src/sage/combinat/growth.py`).  What's missing (and probably cannot be done with growth diagrams) is the symplectic Littlewood-Richardson tableau.
