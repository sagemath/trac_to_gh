# Issue 28883: One-line fix for "./configure is too sensitive to stray files/subdirectories"

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29120

Original creator: mkoeppe

This branch can be merged by people who are working with tickets pre-9.1.beta2 who cannot easily merge current develop into that ticket.

It turns an error issued by `configure` when they are stray files in `build/pkgs` (such as the generated files introduced in #29038).

Could we please avoid `continue`, by putting the stuff to run fully into `then` clause?

I think it's better if the diff is small.
