1. it seems that the repackaged singular tarball has no 'Tst' folder? 
This folder contains the Singular regression tests. 

Question: could someone repackage Singular 3.1.7p1 and add the 'Tst' folder?

2. Singular has short, long and very long running regression tests. 
Question:
is there a convention, which tests 'spkg-check' should run, or may 'spkg-check' accept options?

There is no convention, but I would try to limit the time to something on the order of 10 minutes.
