not very efficient so far. Would be better to use the description of covers

First note. The code assumes that the posets have rank function, but requires slightly more: the posets must be graded. Why so?

In https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0312516.pdf, they assume in the definition on page 2 that both posets are pure, meaning "all maximal chains have the same length."

OK. I mark this as positive review. (But it would not be bad idea to copy the definition from the paper to the documentation, it is only few lines.)
