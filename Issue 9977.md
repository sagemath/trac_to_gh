# Issue 9977: Add a test for the maths library in the 'prereq' script.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/9978

The 'prereq' script in `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base` is currently version 0.7. This does not check that the maths library `libm` exists. I thought that was pretty much a formality, but it is not on AIX, where the shared maths library `/usr/lib/libm.a` does not get installed by default. 


```
-bash-4.1$ ls /usr/lib/libm*
/usr/lib/libmbx.a
```


The maths library is part of the `bos.adt` fileset. Hence a test for the maths library should be added. After installing `bos.adt`, so the maths library exists:


```
-bash-4.1$ ls /usr/lib/libm*
/usr/lib/libm.a       /usr/lib/libmbx.a     /usr/lib/libm_r.a     /usr/lib/libmsaa.a    /usr/lib/libmsaa_r.a
```

I read the patch and it looks good. I haven't tested it, though.

Thank you.

Here is some results when installed on my IBM RS/6000, which runs AIX 5.3. 


```
-bash-4.1$ uname
AIX
```


Here's the output after running "make" on the AIX system, which has the maths library installed, since the bos.adt fileset was installed. 


```
-bash-4.1$ uname 
AIX
-bash-4.1$ make

<snip irrelevant output>

Starting prerequisite check.

checking for sqrtl in -lm... yes
configure: creating ./config.status
config.status: creating Makefile

```


Then I removed the maths library, /usr/lib/libm.a.


```
-bash-4.1$ su
root's Password:
# mv /usr/lib/libm.a /usr/lib/foo
# exit
```


Then after running make, we see that the 'prereq' script exits with an error. 


```
checking for sqrt in -lm... no
configure: This system has no maths library installed.
configure: On AIX, this is in the bos.adt.libm fileset.
configure: Actually, we recommend to install the complete bos.adt fileset.
configure: This needs to be performed by a system administrator.
configure: error: Exiting, since a maths library was not found.
 ERROR: You do not have all of the prerequisites needed

```


Finally, I did manage to remember to restore my maths library!


```
-bash-4.1$ su
root's Password:
# mv /usr/lib/foo /usr/lib/libm.a
# exit
-bash-4.1$ 
```

Nicolas M. Thi√©ry wrote on sage-devel


```
I did not actually run the code, especially on AIX, but trust you did
(both with and without libm installed). Reading it sounds very
reasonable; I am thus ready to give it a positive review.

Quick variant:

    # On AIX libm is not installed by default - strange as that might seem -
    # While we are it, bos.adt is likely to contain other useful things for Sage
    if test "x`uname`" = 'xAIX'
    then
       AC_MSG_NOTICE([On AIX, libm is contained in the bos.adt.libm fileset.]) 
       AC_MSG_NOTICE([Actually, we recommend to install the complete bos.adt fileset.]) 

Cheers,
				Nicolas
```


The patch has been changed to include Nicolas's revised wording on the error message that is generated.

Somehow I managed to remove John. I've put him back!

Attachment

Changes to the configure.ac file which check that sqrt exists in the maths library.

New tar file. This does not need reviewing. Changes from prereq-0.7.tar are due to changes in the configure.ac file, which is in the tar file

I realised that I had not used Nicolas's exact wording for one of the messages, which was better than my own. Hence I have rebuilt the tar file. I checked again on AIX, and this is what it produced when I temporarily removed the maths library `/usr/lib/libm.a`



```
