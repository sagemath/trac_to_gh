# Issue 19088: cython() does not know how to compile c++

As reported on sage-devel [1], some .pyx files using c++ that are accepted in Sage's own source code cannot be compiled with '%runfile'. This branch fixes it.

According to the patchbot, the doc doesn't build.

You have to change the `cython()` docstring to start with `r"""` since you are adding backslashes to the docstring.
