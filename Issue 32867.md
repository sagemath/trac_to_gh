# Issue 32867: Fix references to `doc-clean` in the installation guide`

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33104

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2022-01-01 23:48:18

Followup to #29310: `make doc-uninstall` should frequently be used instead of or in addition to `make doc-clean`, so the instructions for installation from source need to be fixed.
