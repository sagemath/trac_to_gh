Builds and passes its test suite on OS X + Python 3. Works on a sample file of mine. Positive review from me, but people should double check on other platforms.

Works and passes with `SAGE_CHECK` on OS X + Python 2 as well!  I'd say if someone checks on Linux that would be enough, though hopefully none of the changes would really impact that.

As a side thing, I'll note we receive the following message:

```
[sagetex-3.4] LaTeX Warning: There were undefined references.
[sagetex-3.4] 
[sagetex-3.4] 
[sagetex-3.4] LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may have changed. Rerun to get cross-references right.
[sagetex-3.4] 
[sagetex-3.4]  )
[sagetex-3.4] (\end occurred inside a group at level 1)
[sagetex-3.4] 
[sagetex-3.4] ### simple group (level 1) entered at line 27 ({)
[sagetex-3.4] ### bottom level
[sagetex-3.4] (see the transcript file for additional information)
```

which indicates to me that maybe the check script should run `pdflatex` _twice_ after running Sage, just to resolve those annoying warnings as per usual when TeXing.  I don't know about the `\end` thing because I don't recall seeing that when building `example.tex` on its own to test.

I see the `\end` statement with the current version of SageTeX, too, so this is not a regression. It's actually coming from the file `sagetex.dtx`, not `example.tex`.

I agree that to produce a good PDF file, you should run pdflatex twice after running sagetex, but we don't actually care about that for testing: we just want to make sure that sagetex seems to be functioning. This would work, but I don't think it's necessary:

I have been trying the same patch, and I would add it, as it checks that the Python part of the package functions well and does not produce broken TeX.

Branch pushed to git repo; I updated commit sha1. New commits:

I'm happy with that change, obviously.

Also builds and passes tests on an Ubuntu virtual machine, both before I installed `texlive-full` and afterwards.

Does the testsuite for the current version of sagetex pass on that machine?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2019-11-16 09:17:11

The testsuite passes from me on Python 2 and 3. The buildbot in question appears to run a broken Sage, as it cannot import * from sage.all.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2019-11-16 09:19:34

it could be a not sufficiently strict dependency checking, i.e. one may add $(STARTED) to deps, just as I did on #28710.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2019-11-16 09:21:22

on the other hand this would be an overkill, as it is only needed for spkg-check


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2019-11-16 09:40:54

one can modify spkg-check to bail out if ./sage does not start.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2019-11-16 20:13:46

Might indeed be due to a problem elsewhere, lets try again

Changing status from needs_work to needs_review.

FWIW, using Python 3, builds and passes its own testsuite, compiles `exemple.tex` correctly and passes `ptestalllong` with no new failure on Debian testing running on core i7 + 16 GB RAM.

HTH,

I traced the issue to `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` build, see #28748

Resolution: fixed
