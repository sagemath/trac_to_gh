# Issue 25429: Interface GSL Monte Carlo with sage

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25666

Original creator: vklein

Original creation time: 2018-06-26 14:18:47

CC:  vdelecroix

Currently Sage can on dimensional integration with the gsl function `numerical_integral`.

The goal of this ticket is to allow sage to do multidimensional integration with gsl's monte carlo function.
Gsl documentation https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/montecarlo.html

- the Monte Carlo version should apear in the code *after* the one-dimensional deterministic version
- right now the code is far too slow. The integration goes through the function `double c_monte_ff(double *x, size_t dim, void *params)` which creates a Python list in order to evaluate the integrand
- the code only works with function that can be transformed into fast callble. It should also work for Python function such as `lambda u,v: u*v`
- I did `Ctrl-C` and obtained a segfault

- Monte Carlo has been moved after the one-dimensional version
- Pythons function are now supported.
- Some tests have been added
- I don't have managed to reproduce the segfault.

- instead of `elif not isinstance(func, Wrapper)` you should check for `Wrapper_rdf`. For example the following segfaults

```
sage: from sage.calculus.integration import monte_carlo_integration
sage: f(u,v) = u*v
sage: f = fast_callable(f, domain=CDF)
sage: monte_carlo_integration(f, [0,0], [2,2], 10^7) # abs tol 0.1
```

- the first line of the documentation must be a single short line. For example `Integrate func` is enough. The details are provided by the rest of the documentation.
- there is no newline at end of file (and git somehow complains)
- can you replace `PyMem_Malloc`/`PyMem_Free` by the more modern `MemoryAllocator` from `ext/memory_allocator.pyx` (for `_xl` and `_xu`)
- to make it faster with Python functions, you can try to change directly the values of the floating points in wrapper.lx via the [https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/float.html C API](https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/float.html C API)
- you should change `print('TODO: Implement the case where the algo param is wrong')` with a proper error :-0

I think it would be simpler to add a `list lx` attribute to `PyFunctionWrapper` rather than creating the ad hoc `PyMonteWrapper`. When unused this attribute will be set to `NULL` and should not affect performance (though you should check it).

Also I would not use `monte` alone but rather `monte_carlo`. The abbreviation sounds weird.

Ok i will do that.

Done.
Performance check has been done with :

```
sage: f(x,a) = 1/(a+x^2)
sage: %time l=[numerical_integral(f, 1, 2, max_points=100000, params=[n]) for n in range(10000)]
CPU times: user 2.93 s, sys: 176 ms, total: 3.11 s
Wall time: 3.1 s
```


And as you predicted the modification seems to be harmless.

Tell me if you have an example to maximize the number of sample points required.

I give positive review to commits `39e4ea2`, â€‹`99e76a3` and `4e3eafc`.

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2019-06-25 08:48:20

Terminology is still bad. We would have `numerical_integral` and `monte_carlo_integration`. Why not `monte_carlo_integral`?


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2019-06-25 08:49:01

Please add a space around comparison signs such as in `len(wrapper.the_parameters)!=0`.

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2019-06-25 08:52:26

Concerning documentation string, please read carefully the [developer manual](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings) and the [Python conventions in PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). In particular:
- long lines (> 79 characters) should be split
- there should be a linebreak between the first line and the rest of the doc
- etc

Also `python` -> `Python`.

It should be said the it uses gsl under the hood and make a reference to the documentation. The main authors of this are the GSL developers.

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2019-06-25 08:58:36

This corner case is not correct

```
    if not dim:
        return float(0)
```

(perhaps my fault). I would advised to simply raise an error.


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2019-06-25 08:59:24

To allocate arrays, use `calloc` not `malloc`. It is safe for overflows.


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2019-06-25 09:01:12

Is it really occurring

```
        if not func is None:
            wrapper.the_function = func
        else:
            raise ValueError("No integrand defined")
```

I think this gets catch earlier by `if not callable(func)`. Anyway, any error should be tested in the doctest.

Which one ? `ValueError: 0 dimension specified` ?

The user never specifies dimensions but simply integration bounds for the generalized cube. I would rather use the message `NotImplementedError: 0 dimensional integration not available`.

Error management is not consistent between fastcallable and Python function :



```
sage: x, y = SR.var('x,y')
sage: monte_carlo_integral(x*y, [0,0,0], [2,2,2], 1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: The function to be integrated depends on 2 variables (x, y), and so cannot be integrated in one dimension. Please fix additional variables with the 'params' argument
sage: monte_carlo_integral(lambda x,y: y*x, [0,0,0], [2,2,2], 1)
object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
(0.0, inf)
```

I am not sure if the ref `[GSL1]` is ok or if there is a naming convention i need to know for references.


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2019-06-25 18:51:34

The link you used for `[GSL1]` is exactly the same as for `[GSL]`. Is that intended?

For naming convention, I would rather make a single entry

```
.. [GSL]
   https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/
```

and when cited, make something more specific

```
Documentation can be found in [GSL]_ chapter "Look at there".
```

Not at all. It was a genuine mistake.

Ok let's do that.

The following should be allocated inside the `try`/`finally`

```
    type_rng = gsl_rng_default
    _rng = gsl_rng_alloc(type_rng)
```

Otherwise, the function might return without deallocation.
