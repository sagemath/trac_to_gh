CC:  @videlec

Currently Sage can on dimensional integration with the gsl function `numerical_integral`.

The goal of this ticket is to allow sage to do multidimensional integration with gsl's monte carlo function.
Gsl documentation https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/montecarlo.html

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25666

I think it would be simpler to add a `list lx` attribute to `PyFunctionWrapper` rather than creating the ad hoc `PyMonteWrapper`. When unused this attribute will be set to `NULL` and should not affect performance (though you should check it).

Also I would not use `monte` alone but rather `monte_carlo`. The abbreviation sounds weird.

Done.
Performance check has been done with :

```
sage: f(x,a) = 1/(a+x^2)
sage: %time l=[numerical_integral(f, 1, 2, max_points=100000, params=[n]) for n in range(10000)]
CPU times: user 2.93 s, sys: 176 ms, total: 3.11 s
Wall time: 3.1 s
```


And as you predicted the modification seems to be harmless.

Tell me if you have an example to maximize the number of sample points required.

I give positive review to commits `39e4ea2`, ​`99e76a3` and `4e3eafc`.

The user never specifies dimensions but simply integration bounds for the generalized cube. I would rather use the message `NotImplementedError: 0 dimensional integration not available`.

The link you used for `[GSL1]` is exactly the same as for `[GSL]`. Is that intended?

For naming convention, I would rather make a single entry

```
.. [GSL]
   https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/
```

and when cited, make something more specific

```
Documentation can be found in [GSL]_ chapter "Look at there".
