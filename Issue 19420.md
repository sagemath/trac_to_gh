First we ensure that `NumberFieldFactory` passes `latex_name` on in every case.  Now

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - 5)
sage: y = polygen(K, 'y')
sage: M.<c> = NumberField(y^3 + a - 1, latex_name='gamma')
sage: latex(c), M.latex_variable_name()
(c, 'gamma')
```

Now require that the `extension` method passes on `latex_name`, that the `NumberField_generic` class defines the `_latex_names` attribute so that the `latex_variable_names` method works as it should, and similarly that the `NumberField_relative` class defines that attribute appropriately.  This gives

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - 6, latex_name='alpha')
sage: K.latex_variable_names()
['alpha']
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(x^2 - 5, latex_name='beta')
sage: L.latex_variable_names()
['beta', 'alpha']
```

See also #30372	- Replace `NumberField_generic.__latex_variable_name` by `._latex_names`

I have taken some of the commits here and merged/reworked them in #30360, where I did similar work.
This ticket can be closed.
