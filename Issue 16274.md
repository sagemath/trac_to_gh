Keywords: matrix integer_mod solve_right

Here are two bugs in `Matrix.solve_right()`:

```
sage: A = Matrix.identity(2)
sage: B = Matrix.identity(Zmod(8), 2)
sage: B.solve_right(A)
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer_ring.IntegerRing_class' object has no attribute 'cover_ring'
sage: B.solve_right(B)
...
PariError: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting )-> or ',': (1,0)
```

In the first case, there is no solution due to the different base rings; we should at least return a more informative error message.  In the second case, `B` itself is the unique solution.

```

Now we get 

```
sage: A = Matrix.identity(2)
sage: B = Matrix.identity(Zmod(8), 2)
sage: B.solve_right(A)

[1]
[0]
sage: B.solve_right(B)

The line `ret = A.matsolvemod(K.cardinality(), b)` is unnecessarily repeated.  Also, why is the final return statement removed?
