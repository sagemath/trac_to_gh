Hey Volker,

Here's a rebased version with my review changes. I've removed the need for the `*_generic` classes and made the docstrings be at the class level so that they are visible using introspection. I've also added a method to get the lifted matrix space (representation of affine transformations as linear transformations) as `linear_space()`, and made a few docstring tweaks. If you're happy with my changes, you can set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis

If the input format needs to be changed and exposed to the global namespace, you can implement a `__classcall__()` on the GAP wrapper parent (and likely the input will still need to standardized).
