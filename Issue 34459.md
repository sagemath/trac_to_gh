# Issue 34459: Graph orientations require sorting vertices

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34696

Keywords: graph,orientation,digraph

When one wishes to iterate over all orientations of a given graph, the procedure involves sorting the vertices of that graph. This causes errors when the vertices are not comparable. Example:


```
sage: T = Graph()                                              
sage: T.add_vertices([1,(2,3)])                                
sage: list(T.orientations())                                   
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-33-c6d7d547fed1> in <module>
----> 1 list(T.orientations())

/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/sage/graphs/graph.py in orientations(self, data_structure, sparse)
   3775 
   3776         if not self.size():
-> 3777             D = DiGraph(data=[self.vertices(), []],
   3778                         format='vertices_and_edges',
   3779                         name=name,

/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py in vertices(self, sort, key)
  10609             raise ValueError('sort keyword is False, yet a key function is given')
  10610         if sort:
> 10611             return sorted(list(self.vertex_iterator()), key=key)
  10612         return list(self.vertex_iterator())
  10613

The problem exists even when one tries `T.vertices()`, but one can overcome this by setting `sort=False` there.

Which version of Sagemath are you using ?

In the code of 9.8.beta2 I see

```
        if not self.size():
            D = DiGraph(data=[self.vertices(sort=False), []],
```


and I can do:

```
sage: sage: T = Graph()
sage: sage: T.add_vertices([1,(2,3)])
sage: sage: list(T.orientations())
[Digraph on 2 vertices]
```

Oh, sorry! I am using [SageMath](SageMath) version 9.0, Release Date: 2020-01-01. I should probably upgrade.

The change has been done in ##22349, merge in sagemath 9.7. So yes, please check with the last version.

I apologise.

I can't remember: how do I close this ticket?
