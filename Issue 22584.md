Currently, the Mac app only checks once whether people want to upgrade sagenb to Jupyter - and the default save location is atrocious.  From the author:

```
If it’s what I think you’re talking about, then yes it is Mac app specific.  It checks to see if there is a file at ~/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/users.pickle, and then asks if they want to "Upgrade", "Ask me Later", or "Don’task again".  It won’t ask again unless you choose "Ask me Later".  In particular, if you Upgrade then it won’t ask again (because presumably there is no need).  You can reset the check by running:

	defaults write org.sagemath.Sage askToUpgradeNB 1

The check itself is on line 511 of AppController.m in case you need to change anything.  I could easily add a menu option to upgrade, but I didn’t think it was worth it at the time.
```
Ideally we'd add a menu option as well.

Blocker because we will have a lot of people who only interact with this via the GUI who will be confused.

There are two commits.  The first unconditionally adds the menu item and the second greys it out if there are no files to be upgraded.  It's fine with me if you want to just use the first because you think it will be less confusing.

I should note that I didn't test the actual upgrade.

From [this sage-release thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-release/dZNnFGatC0M):

```
I used the occasion of SD86 to try out: 

        sage-8.0.beta0-OSX_10.11.6-x86_64.app.dmg 

on a participant's mac. I dragged and dropped the app from the dmg 
into Applications. I get an icon in the tray. However clicking the 
icon just starts the legacy notebook without reference to Jupyter. 

Running Jupyter from the command line works fine: 

        /Applications/Sagexxx/sage -notebook jupyter 

Did I miss something along the way? 
```
Should we then have a different message if there is nothing to upgrade when people want to launch Sage?  I believe the default is supposed to move to Jupyter at that point (Sage 8.0).  Volker, do I understand that correctly that we'd want the Mac app to default to Jupyter at that time?  So maybe we need a message asking  about this.

Also, Ivan, I think a message warning people on upgrade to choose a good folder to save their upgrades might be good.  I don't know how annoying that would be to implement.  I do like the greyed-out option idea.  Upgrades themselves work fine (or as fine as can be expected), I have tested this.

I changed the default to prefer Jupyter (you can set it in Preferences).  I could add a startup message to make them choose if we wanted.

There is already a setting for where Jupyter should be saved (~/Documents/Sage/ by default).  Is the problem that the default is bad (or should be set at the very beginning), or that it's not being used?  If the latter, is it not being used when starting the server or when exporting?

Oh!  I'll have to check that out - my sense was it was within the Sage app bundle directory but I may have just not been paying attention.

It doesn't work for me either, always starts sagenb.
* To run legacy SageNB: `sage --notebook=sagenb`
* To run Jupyter: `sage --notebook=jupyter`
* To run the SageNB -> Jupyter converter web app: `sage --notebook=export`

The menu points are
* Start SageNB Server
* Stop SageNB Server
* Start Jupyter        <-- does nothing?  Log is empty

Awesome, yes, I definitely didn't have that directory.  When I change the default in preferences this works.  *However* for some reason the check mark does not move away from "Stop Jupyter" no matter what I do.

When I switch (still without this ticket) to not preferring old sagenb, I don't see gray out or hidden.   It does switch to the "lower" set of start/stop.

I think if you can change the "please wait" page to note that they can find the url (including token) if the auto-open doesn't work in the "View log", that would be a very helpful easy change.  Also, that loading page should mention where they can switch that preference (in the Preferences -> Notebook and also to start/stop in menu icon).  I hope that is not too much trouble.

It still shows the possibility of starting either server.  My thought was that even if you prefer one, you should have the option of using the other.

It looks like the checkmark of "Stop Jupyter" was just set for some reason.  I wonder when I messed that up.  I have fixed it.

I changed the loading page to work for Jupyter too.  Hopefully, it's something like what you had in mind.

To test, just the mac app

```
open ./src/mac-app/Sage.xcodeproj/ # will open in Xcode
```
Then Command-R will build and run Sage.app (you'll have to set it to Use Alternate Sage Exectable in Preferences).  I think the only thing that doesn't work is the that Sage Version in About Sage isn't set (but who cares?).

You may have pushed a fix locally, but maybe it's not pushed to Trac?

I think that if "Open Notebook" became an alias to "Start X" where X is the default in the Preferences, that would solve that.  Then "New Worksheet" could either go away (in both location, menu and icon) or could be renamed.  My first instinct is to say go away, though I'm not sure why.  It is certainly useful.  

By the way, if the loading page doesn't already mention the preference for setting your preferred notebook, that would be useful.  I know it's getting a bit busy.

You're right.  I tried to push it and it failed.  I'm still not sure why.  I can't push it now either, maybe because I'm at work?

I'll try to look into the others tonight.

I made Open Notebook into "open a currently running server or start the preferred," and hid New Worksheet unless they prefer SageNB.

Since I think we're getting close to something usable (if not there already) I rebased on develop and cleaned up the commits a little.  I hope that's not too onerous.

This looks good.  I do note that the new push seems to still default to the legacy notebook even when I didn't have that clicked.  Is that a glitch on my computer because I tested this?  It was already not checked when I started the app on this most recent one.

Most importantly, the upgrade is indeed now always accessible - by far the most important part.

So the only issue is that on *start only* it seems to always do legacy sagenb even if not checked to do so.  My guess is that there is still some default that went back to "yes" or something.  

> I made Open Notebook into "open a currently running server or start the preferred," and hid New Worksheet unless they prefer SageNB.


Yes, this works now.  I'll note that "New Worksheet" *always* appears in the File menu (as opposed to the menu item).  I don't know if that is intended, though.

Otherwise this should be merged and people should enjoy Sage 8.0!

It is amusing to unset the default Jupyter directory, close Sage, restart it, be asked to pick a directory (which is awesome), and then have the *sagenb* notebook start up ;-)

Ivan, is the problem here in `AppController.m`?

```
-(IBAction)openNotebook:(id)sender{
    if ( jupyterURL != nil ) {
        [self browseRemoteURL:jupyterURL];
    } else if ( port != 0 || (defaults && [defaults boolForKey:@"preferSageNB"]) ) {
        [self browseLocalSageURL:@""];
    } else {
        [self startJupyter:sender];
    }
}
```

Or conceivably in `start-sage.sh`

```
if [ "$NB_TYPE" = jupyter ]; then

./sage --notebook=jupyter $4 >> "$SAGE_LOG" 2>> "$SAGE_LOG" &

```
Maybe this hasn't actually been used properly?

I couldn't find any other place where this seems to be done. In particular 

```
   } else if ( port != 0 || (defaults && [defaults boolForKey:@"preferSageNB"]) ) {
```
maybe somehow `port` is set (I couldn't figure out how) accidentally when we start off?

Volker, truly this is otherwise ready to go, just FYI.
