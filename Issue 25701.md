# Issue 25701: splitting_field should call the base ring's _splitting_field_univariate_polynomial

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25938

Original creator: saraedum

Original creation time: 2018-07-26 14:29:34

Currently, a polynomial's `splitting_field()` is only implemented for finite fields and number fields. This can not be easily extended by user provided constructions such as Henselizations, https://github.com/MCLF/henselization.
