I think this should work:


```
sage: l = var('lambda')
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
...
ValueError: The name "lambda" is not a valid Python identifier.
```


This is what I usually do, and it *does* work:


```
sage: l = SR('lambda')
sage: show(l)
```


The reason to use the 'lambda' name is for the magic latex conversion.

It may be inconvenient, but this can't work. The problem is that the top-level `var` also injects a global variable binding and, as is correctly reported, `lambda` isn't valid because it's a reserved keyword. The workaround is to use a different `var`, such as `SR.var` or `sage.calculus.var.var` (I hope those are really the same function), which is almost equivalent to the workaround presented.

Close as "won't fix"? I don't see another option.

Agreed.

Another way to get a variable that is typeset as `\lambda` in latex mode is


```
sage: var('l', latex_name='\lambda')
l
sage: latex(l)
\lambda
```

Whoops, I always thought that this avoided creating a global:


```
sage: x = var('y')
sage: y
y
```


Good to know! Sorry for the noise.

Do we have that in the documentation?  I feel like we have something about `lambda` in there, but having a couple ways to do it would be interesting.
