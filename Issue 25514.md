Note the difference between

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(3^10, impl="givaro");
sage: %time L = list(k)
CPU times: user 100 ms, sys: 2 ms, total: 102 ms
Wall time: 102 ms
```

and

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(3^10, impl="pari_ffelt")
sage: %time L = list(k)
CPU times: user 3.18 s, sys: 11 ms, total: 3.19 s
Wall time: 3.17 s
```

There is clearly room for improvement in the latter.

Do all of those returns in `element_pari_ffelt.pyx` need a `sig_off`, or is that handled by the calling function?

Would it be worth cythonizing the iterator (by making it a function in `element_pari_ffelt.pyx`)?

I just realized that my "PARI finite field" iterator is in fact completely generic and doesn't use any PARI features. So I'll move that to the base class.

It's handled by `construct`.

Maybe, but I'd rather do that another time :-)

...which happens to be implemented in Cython. So I got another x2.5 speedup!

I think that the current code is as good as it can get for a generic implementation.
