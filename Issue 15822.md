Keywords: braid group, hash, Caylay graph

Playing with braid groups for a demo today, i want to see its Caylay graph in a neighbourhood of the neutral element:

```

ball = set()
ball.add(B.one())
for length in range(1,4):
    for w in Words(alphabet=B.gens(), length=length):
        ball.add(prod(w))
G = B.cayley_graph(elements=ball, generators=B.gens()
G.plot()

```

Hmmm, it looks locally like the free group, as if there was no relation !

`s0 * s2` is a different vertex as `s2 * s0`, while:

```
sage: s0 * s2 == s2 * s0
True
```

Indeed:

```
sage: hash(s0 * s2)
954209079
sage: hash(s2 * s0)
1883627875
```

There should be a canonical representation for elements in Braid groups. At least, two equal elements should have the same hash. Currently, `caylay_graph` answers something wrong !

Could you add an `is_isomorphic()` check to the Cayley graph of the corresponding free group (or some other way of showing it's not the Cayley graph of the free group)? Once that is done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Actually, there is already an indirect check when `G` answers `Digraph on 31 vertices` (to be compared to `Digraph on 40 vertices` for the free group, some vertices are merged). Is it enough ?

Otherwise, i do not know a short way to represent directed graphs in Sage, but i could add a test for the undirected version of the graph using `sparse6_string` representation along the following lines just after the previous example, though i am not sure it is easy to read:

```
sage: graph_string = ':^_`aa`ddd`aHhh_lmmmfLqqlStt_HjWxxvW{{'
sage: G.to_undirected().is_isomorphic(Graph(graph_string))
True
```

What do you think ?

Sorry for letting this slip away. I've added an extra doctest which makes the fix more explicit (at least to those of us who don't know how big the a 4 ball of a free group is `:p`). If you're happy with this, then positive review.
