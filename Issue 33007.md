# Issue 33007: sage.arith.misc.power_mod() works in any ring with %, not just ZZ

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33244

Original creator: lorenz

Original creation time: 2022-01-29 09:52:28

The documentation of `power_mod()` in `sage/arith/misc.py` currently says:

    Return the `n`-th power of `a` modulo the integer `m`.

But the function actually works in any ring where `%` is defined! Let's change the documentation to reflect this.

Please fix the following:


```diff
     if not n:
-        if not a:
-            raise ArithmeticError("0^0 is undefined.")
         return a.parent().one()
```


See the many previous zero-to-the-zero tickets:

- https://trac.sagemath.org/query?order=id&desc=1&summary=~0%5E0

Therefore,

- `power_mod(0, 0, 5)` should return `1`, not raise an error

I also think

- `a % 0` should return `a`, not raise an error

but maybe that belongs in a separate ticket.

The `power_mod(0, 0, 5)` test needs updating now.

Only `a % 0` might be for another ticket; sorry I was not clear.

Sorry, my bad, should be fixed now.

There is one last instance of raising an error for `0^0`.

It is in `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_template.pxi`.

Do you know how to deal with it?
Or maybe that is also for a separate ticket.
