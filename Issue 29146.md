remind me, what's the new way to make user packages for Sage?

Create the appropriate subdirectory of `build/pkgs` and populate with `checksums.ini`, etc.

But there is no non-deprecated way for someone to create a standalone package which is not part of Sage, I think.

That's right

It works for me. Is it okay to remove the only way to create standalone user packages, even if it is deprecated? It's not even documented anywhere. I say we merge this. Or do we need to ask on sage-devel?

The discussion on sage-devel happened already, leading to the deprecatIon.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

ok - I assume you checked that this is not in docs any more, either.
