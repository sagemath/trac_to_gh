This ticket proposes introducing a dark theme to the Three.js viewer. The new `theme` viewer option will be used to control whether the original (and default) 'light' theme or the new 'dark' theme is used.

Aside from appeasing users -- myself included -- who generally prefer dark UIs, the main justification for this feature is that JupyterLab, unlike the Jupyter notebook, allows you to use a dark theme for its UI. When using that theme, however, the contrast between the dark UI and the bright background of Three.js plots can be quite harsh.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30462

```python
surface = dodecahedron(mesh=True, color='blue').scale(0.5)

points = point3d([random_vector(RR, 3) for i in range(0, 100)], color='green')
text = text3d("Hello world!", (1, 1, 1), color='yellow')
show(surface + curve + points + text, theme='dark')
```


[Animation controls](https://jcamp0x2a.github.io/threejs-animation-example/dark_theme_anim.html)

```python
animate([dodecahedron().rotateZ(t*pi/32) for t in range(0, 64)]).interactive(delay=5, theme='dark')

Cool idea! Minor quibble: you don't need parentheses around the condition during variable assignment via the ternary operator.

I can confirm that things work as expected, so almost ready to go.

I don't quite like the code inside `addLabel` that tests for the color black, since you haven't captured all possible ways to create that color via CSS. A foolproof method would be to create a DIV, set its color with the incoming CSS string and then check the numeric values of its computed style. That's a bit much, however, since anyone trying to use black text in a dark theme is obviously not going to see anything. We could just test for the string 'black', since it's being set internally as the default value, and see how much feedback we get on usage.

Also, why are the lines for testing viewpoint values highlighted? Can't see any changes...

I don't think we want to change defaults in the Python code: might affect the current user experience in other viewers. Perhaps we should just check for the defaults we know are being set, 'black' and '!#000000', and let the other formats exist as a way to override this behavior.
