# Issue 16331: remove desolve_system_strings()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16568

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2014-06-27 14:26:46

Keywords: deprecation, removal

kcrisman in comment 54 of #8734:

... see #8132 where it was first said to be obsolete, and it hasn't been in the global namespace since before 2010. That is pretty much equivalent to a deprecation to me. However, we should keep any non-overlapping examples ...

Hi!  Thanks for joining Sage development.   Just curious - do you think that any of the examples in this function are worth rescuing for doctesting purposes (I mean if they were changed to the standard `desolve` syntax)?   It's always worth checking for this.

Hi, thanks. I'm going to agree with you on this. It is not so time consuming to modify and add these little tests, while an additional feedback is often useful.

Nice! But you need to do a bit more indentation for the last block, and should probably do `:trac:`16568`` for the Trac reference.

Dedent 

```
Now type show(P1), show(P2) to view these plots.
```

so it is at the same indentation level as other text for the documentation to look right.  But otherwise this is great.
