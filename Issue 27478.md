Per reports like [this one](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/46075/sage-notebook-crashes-immediately), it seems there is some condition (I am not sure yet what) such that on Windows trying to bind to port 8888 results in a permission error, on which the notebook crashes:

socket.error: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted
```

The notebook already has some code to try other ports if the requested port fails:

```python
        for port in random_ports(self.port, self.port_retries+1):
            try:
                self.http_server.listen(port, self.ip)
            except socket.error as e:
                if e.errno == errno.EADDRINUSE:
                    self.log.info(_('The port %i is already in use, trying another port.') % port)
                    continue
                elif e.errno in (errno.EACCES, getattr(errno, 'WSAEACCES', errno.EACCES)):
                    self.log.warning(_("Permission to listen on port %i denied") % port)
                    continue
                else:
                    raise
```

However, in this case some reason users are getting `EPERM` instead of `EACCES` and that case is not handled in the above code.

As it happens, the [POSIX specification for bind()](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/bind.html) does not mention `EPERM` as an expected error, just `EACCES`.  Perhaps this is a Cygwin-specific bug.  Will have to dig a bit to see where it might be coming from.

I confirmed that this is [likely a bug in Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2019-04/msg00161.html).  For now though it is easiest to workaround in the Notebook code.

I'm okay, in this case, with just patching the package in Sage, since the patch is only needed (in some cases) on Cygwin, so it won't be needed by most other downstream packagers, etc.

I will just note for the record that the issue *could* be worked around by monkey-patching, but this is probably easier in this case.

I will also probably backport this to Sage 8.7 for Windows now that I have a mechanism for that.
