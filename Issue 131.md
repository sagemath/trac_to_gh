I will not be happy until every single method has a doctest!

One nice extension would be to make "sage -t" should give an error for any method that doesn't have a doctest in it, unless this is explicitly turned off by putting "noforcetest" at the top of the file.

This is just unrealistic... and isn't a bug.
