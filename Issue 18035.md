Either approach would have to be tested on older versions of OS X, though.

I have the same experience with Catalina. On both Big Sur and Catalina, I can avoid the doctest failures by using

```
% MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=X make ptestlong
```

where `X` is a suitable number for the operating system (either 11.0 or 10.15).

I do not have access to any older versions of the MacOS.

Another approach would be to use the `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` that the configured system `python3` uses, because that's a lower bound for the target that we can build for using that Python.

If we're not building a `bdist`, why should we have to set `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` at all? My recollection is that we did this to work around some bugs in various spkgs, but if we can build without setting it, shouldn't we?

I agree, for normal builds, not setting `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` at all will be fine.

This ticket would need to go through testing on all supported platforms again -- do you want this change in 9.3?
