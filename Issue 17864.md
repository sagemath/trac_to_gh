Keywords: sagedays66

The wiki contains a description on how to cite `SageMath` in publications:
[http://wiki.sagemath.org/Publications_using_SAGE](http://wiki.sagemath.org/Publications_using_SAGE)

But the advice seem out of date: the name `SageMath` is not used. It would be nice to rename the page's name as well.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18101
