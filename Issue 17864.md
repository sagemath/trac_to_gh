# Issue 17864: The citation recommendations for SageMath does not use the new name

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18101

Original creator: jsrn

Original creation time: 2015-04-01 16:52:06

Keywords: sagedays66

The wiki contains a description on how to cite `SageMath` in publications:
[http://wiki.sagemath.org/Publications_using_SAGE](http://wiki.sagemath.org/Publications_using_SAGE)

But the advice seem out of date: the name `SageMath` is not used. It would be nice to rename the page's name as well.

Determined to be invalid/duplicate/wontfix (closing as "wontfix" as a catch-all resolution).
