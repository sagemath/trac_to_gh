Issue created by migration from Trac.

For binary builds and perhaps tarballs we should not require the git repository. This ticket fixes two doctests for that use case.

Because of the lazy import of the `dev` object, asking for forgiveness won't work.

The idea is to delete the `src/sage/dev` directory if development is not possible (e.g. because of file permissions). Just not importing `dev` is not a solution as the dev doctests are still around (and will all fail).
