# Issue 22516: Don't declare functions/methods as "cdef inline"

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Declaring (as opposed to implementing) functions/methods as inline makes no sense. Cython currently allows it, but it is known to have issues (including generating invalid C code and breaking with Cython updates).
