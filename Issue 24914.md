Actually the product and coproduct on the Phi basis are quite easy to understand. But they are in terms of segmented permutations - i.e. think of the ordered set partition as a word/permutation with some bars. Because we need ideas like shuffle and deconcatenate.

* Product = sum of shifted shuffles - i.e. compute the shifted shuffle as words, then there is a bar between letters a and b if either a,b came from the same word and there was a bar in between, or if b comes from the first word and a from the second.
* Coproduct = deconcatenate and standardise. The deconcatenation can be within a block or between blocks.

My best idea for how to do this:

* we already have ordered-set-partition -> composition.
* make a function: ordered-set-partition -> permutation, that writes each block in increasing order and concatenates the blocks in the original order.
* make an "inverse" for these combined: i.e. given a permutation and a composition, make an ordered-set-partition whose blocks have sizes given by the composition, and the first block is the first few letters of the permutation, the second block is the next few letters, and so on.

Then we can compute shuffle and deconcatenation in the permutation/composition format.

If you think it is useful, I can try to code the functions osp->permutation and (permutation,composition)->osp . But it will be of the level at #25152. Not sure if that's too rudimentary to be useful.

Sorry not to be of much help. Thanks Darij for all the coding so far.

I'm happy to take it out, but try removing it... `W QSym` latex's fine, `WQSym` doesn't.

I added FQSym and WQSym to the list of combinatorial Hopf algebras.

Aaron and I were discussing about naming conventions on the way to the airport and I don't entirely remember if we came to the right conclusion: `WordQuasiSymmetricFunctions`/`WQSym` is somewhat artificial and arbitrary as a name, `HopfAlgebraOfPackedWords`, `HopfAlgebraOfOrderedSetPartitions` is not consistent.  I still prefer `NCQSym` because the Hopf algebra is realized as the subspace of words which are invariants under shifts of the indices of the variables.  We can make several entry points through a single `CombinatorialHopfAlgebras` entry in the global name space, but then we should add the full list.

IMO, we don't have to deprecate if it is within release cycles. However, for something like this, if we are going to change the names, we should do so in the ticket that introduces it and percolate it up because of how fundamental it is. If it is just going to be an alias, then we can do that at anytime.
