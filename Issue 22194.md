Given that sagenb is essentially a dead project, I don't think that it will ever be Python3 compliant.

I did a lot of work on python3 compliance of sagenb since the last release. At least this should prevent the build to stop on syntax errors.

At the least https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/416 and your own https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/423 would need to be merged first, right?

I don't really see any reason to not keep the legacy notebook around for quite some time, granting that it will not receive much attention.   We just got a support request from someone using Sage 4.6 (!) who really didn't want to upgrade; this is positively new compared to that.

Please test https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/tree/1.0.rc0

It works for me following the instructions in HACKING (updated, to take care of changed names and of the need to deal with mathjax).

Given that Sage does not run with Python 3 yet, it's a bit early to say, no?

>

Probably not really, for it does work without #20922 - I don't get doctest failures mentoined in comment 4 on #20922.

Thanks for the release, Dima. It will not yet be fully py3-compatible, but this should not prevent us from being able to install sagenb in py3-sage.

Also, on OS X at least, the command should be `ln -s -h ...` – as it is, if the mathjax link already exists, then the current command creates another link within that linked folder. It is okay if the `sagenb/data` directory contains

```
mathjax -> ../../../../../share/mathjax/

but it doesn't make sense for `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/mathjax` to contain this.

(On OS X, the documentation for the `-h` flag says "If the target_file or target_dir is a symbolic link, do not follow it." There is also a `-n` flag: "Same as -h, for compatibility with other ln implementations.")
