Given that sagenb is essentially a dead project, I don't think that it will ever be Python3 compliant.

I did a lot of work on python3 compliance of sagenb since the last release. At least this should prevent the build to stop on syntax errors.

At the least https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/416 and your own https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/423 would need to be merged first, right?

I don't really see any reason to not keep the legacy notebook around for quite some time, granting that it will not receive much attention.   We just got a support request from someone using Sage 4.6 (!) who really didn't want to upgrade; this is positively new compared to that.

Given that Sage does not run with Python 3 yet, it's a bit early to say, no?

>

Probably not really, for it does work without #20922 - I don't get doctest failures mentoined in comment 4 on #20922.

Thanks for the release, Dima. It will not yet be fully py3-compatible, but this should not prevent us from being able to install sagenb in py3-sage.

This second part means : first remove the conditional statement on PYTHON3 in spkg_install (on top of the changes in #25394) and do something for the lines about mathjax in this spkg-install. I managed to install sagenb in py3 sage by commenting out these mathjax lines, but this is obviously not a correct solution.

Also, on OS X at least, the command should be `ln -s -h ...` – as it is, if the mathjax link already exists, then the current command creates another link within that linked folder. It is okay if the `sagenb/data` directory contains

```
mathjax -> ../../../../../share/mathjax/
```

but it doesn't make sense for `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/mathjax` to contain this.

(On OS X, the documentation for the `-h` flag says "If the target_file or target_dir is a symbolic link, do not follow it." There is also a `-n` flag: "Same as -h, for compatibility with other ln implementations.")

Failing is as expected. Maybe this specific issue is already fixed by the pull request done after you made the release. But this is not so important : let us keep that for another ticket.

Do you confirm that sage3 builds and starts with the branch here ? I think I did check that also. So it seems to be good to go from this point of view.
