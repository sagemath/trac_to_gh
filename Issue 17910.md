I do not like this extra if. Could you rather change the code to:

```
if algorithm == 'flint':
    ...
elif algorithm == 'modp':
    ...
elif algorithm == 'linbox':
    ...
else:
    raise ValueError
```

See the comment line


```
# Algorithm is 'linbox' or detecting full rank didn't work . . .
```


This can be done, but I think that it would make code a little unclear.

What's with the changes in indendation?

The line had 11 spaces. I have thinked that Python should have `4n` spaces. It's not at all the only line like that, see


```
egrep '^ {4}* {1,3}[^ ]' src/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx
```

If my explanation of spaces is good enought, maybe this can be closed?

No, it's not good enough. I still don't understand why you are _changing_ the indendation on some lines from correct to wrong (please look at the diff!)

I have made a review commit. Thinks look good to me, but other reviewer should agree before this is set to positive review.
