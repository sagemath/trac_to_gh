I do not like this extra if. Could you rather change the code to:

```
if algorithm == 'flint':
    ...
elif algorithm == 'modp':
    ...
elif algorithm == 'linbox':
    ...
else:
    raise ValueError
```

This can be done, but I think that it would make code a little unclear.

The line had 11 spaces. I have thinked that Python should have `4n` spaces. It's not at all the only line like that, see


```
egrep '^ {4}* {1,3}[^ ]' src/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx
