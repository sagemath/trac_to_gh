If, by some accident, one ends up with multiple stamp files for the same package in `local/var/lib/sage/installed`, an error occurs when running `./configure`.

For example, in my case, in the course of development I somehow accidentally wound up with two install records for different versions of mpir.  This results in an error appearing during `./configure` like:


```
...
    mpc-1.1.0
    mpfi-1.5.2
    mpfr-4.0.1.p0
    mpfrcx-0.5
./configure: line 10692: test: local/var/lib/sage/installed/mpir-3.0.0-644faf502c56f97d9accd301965fc57d6ec70868: binary operator expected
    mpir-3.0.0-644faf502c56f97d9accd301965fc57d6ec70868.p0
    mpmath-1.1.0
    nauty-26r1.p0
```


Of course, this should never happen during normal development or usage, but apparently it *can* since I somehow made it happen.
