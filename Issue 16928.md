CC:  @jdemeyer

There are some generic methods defined in `element_ext_pari` files.
There is no reason why they shouldn't be in `element_base` files.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17165

I'll remove the code I moved and commented out.

I don't really get your second request (without actually thinking), so please help me, you mean:
* the `FiniteField_prime_modn` both inherits from `IntegerModRing_generic` and the base class for FF elements?
So should we completely trash out the moved rational reconstruction code?
It actually checks the parent is a prime field, so the element should be in a  `FiniteField_prime_modn`.
