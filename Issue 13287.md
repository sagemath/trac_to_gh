For some unclear reason, there is a

```
cd "$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin"
```

in the `sage_setup()` function in `spkg/bin/sage`.  Remove this.

Why are there still some "cd"s in spkg/bin/sage? At least some of them (sync-build, bdist, upgrade) don't look like they're needed. I don't know about the patchbot.

I wanted to err on the safe side.  When unsure, I put the `cd` statement (or left it).  `bdist` seems to require the `cd`, for the rest I don't know.

Can you explain the change in sage-ipython? I don't see any lines corresponding to `import sage` in the old version. I guess I don't know the mechanics of how sage gets imported when you run `sage` from the command line.

When running Sage through IPython (but not through plain Python when running a script for example), the current working directory is always added to `sys.path` (the empty string is added as zeroth entry, which means the current working directory).  So when doing

```
import sage    # or sage.foo.bar....

If the current working directory happens to be `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage`, that contains a "sage" subdirectory which Python will happily import.  But this is the wrong directory, it should be imported from `site-packages` instead.  This creates problems for Cython modules, as these exist *only* in `site-packages`.

So we avoid this problem by first fixing `sys.path`, then importing Sage so any future imports of Sage submodules will work fine.
