CC:  @zabrocki @tscrim sage-combinat

Keywords: partitions, symmetric functions, NSym, QSym, NCSF, Kronecker product,

This continues #15476. It is not my last word on NSym (I'm still planning to implement Eulerian and other idempotents -- but this is waiting on the merge of #15650 and not much of a priority anyway).

The following has been implemented:\\
- the omega involution on NSym and QSym (and alternative syntaxes for that on Sym);\\
- fixes on some NSym and QSym methods to return values in correct parents;\\
- Verschiebung on the elementary basis of NSym (it would formerly use coercion for that, but there's a simple formula);\\
- a way to compute the internal product on the Psi basis of NSym (which is very fast if the compositions have small length, but otherwise is quite wasteful -- hence not made a default);\\
- immaculate functions in NSym indexed by arbitrary integer vectors (not just compositions);\\
- the reduced Kronecker product (formerly in #15825, now moved here and fixed);\\
- an analogue thereof (but not a lift) on NSym;\\
- the t-completion of a partition (formerly in #15825);\\
- improvements on the to_dyck_word method on partitions (formerly in #15825).

Hey Darij,

I've made some review changes, (minor) optimizations, and rewrote the algorithm for the internal product from bracketing using a backtracing<sup>2</sup> algorithm. Please check that it is faster than the old one (I'm guessing you already have some timings...but I will run some later) and you decide if you want to make it the main call for internal product or not. Otherwise if you're happy with my changes, pos_rev.

Best,

Travis

Thank you! I've looked at all changes apart from the internal product one, for which I'll need some more concentration than I have right now (writing a paper on QSym of all things); I've also added a few more optimizations.

Observations:

1. `for m, c in self.monomial_coefficients().items()` is indeed slower than `for m, c in self` (thanks for making me aware of this!), but `for m, c in self.monomial_coefficients().iteritems()` is not (although the difference is very small). I still prefer `for m, c in self` for brevity, but where the `iteritems` syntax was used I've put it back.

2. The global `sum` function is waaaay slower than `sum` methods on specific free modules, even if the parent has to be identified first in order to call the latter. And this is even without our horrible hijacked sum function in the console (#9321, #15163).

My implementation is light-years faster (even accounting for bias in my test) than the one via coercion. Try it on compositions of 8 (I got bored and stopped it):

```
sage: def test(C):

sage: C = Compositions(7)
sage: test(C)
[1, 1, 5]

Wall time: 33.2 ms
CPU times: user 44.4 s, sys: 84 ms, total: 44.5 s
Wall time: 53.9 s

So I'm in favor of making the standard algorithm. Would you be good with this?

Your current changes are good.

The case I'm worried about is when I is rather long ([1,1,5] doesn't do that trick) and n is in the range not easily tested (between 8 and 12, or so); I'm not sure how well this extends to this case. Here is an example where the bracketing algorithm is considerably slower than the standard one (because the standard one converts to the Complete basis, which is simple for Psi's of spread-out compositions):

```
sage: Psi[2,1,2,2,1].internal_product(Psi[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1])
0
sage: Psi.internal_product_on_basis_by_bracketing([2,1,2,2,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]) 
0
```

Some hybrid might be good, but I'd rather not make it the default. And I'd rather not do it in this patch :/

Thanks a lot for the optimized algorithm, nevertheless -- I'm positive I'll have a use for it even without having computed its running time.

Would you agree with positive_review?

I get 2m 45s versus 8s:

```
sage: %time Psi[2,1,2,2,1].internal_product(Psi[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1])
CPU times: user 2min 17s, sys: 332 ms, total: 2min 18s

Wall time: 7.99 s

```

Perhaps there was some caching going on that resulted in the speedup? Most of the time spent seems to be in computing the list of integer matrices (which definitely could use optimization). So I'm okay with a positive review here since the bottleneck is not in this code and it should be faster for "long" compositions.

PS - this one seems to be the worst:

OOPS, I've mucked up the size of the compositions in the test.

Thanks for the positive_review!
