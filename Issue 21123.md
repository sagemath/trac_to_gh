Numerics in power towers are not combined if nonnumerics present:

```
sage: ((x^(1/2) + 1)^2).expand()
x + 2*sqrt(x) + 1
sage: ((x^(x/2) + 1)^2).expand()
(x^(1/2*x))^2 + 2*x^(1/2*x) + 1
sage: ((x^(1/2*x))^2).expand()
(x^(1/2*x))^2
```


Also in GiNaC:

> expand((x^(x/2)+1)^2);
1+2*x^(1/2*x)+(x^(1/2*x))^2
> expand((x^(x/2))^2);
(x^(1/2*x))^2
```


Sympy does it as expected:

```
In [5]: ((x**(x/2) + 1)**2).expand()
Out[5]:
   x
   ─
   2    x
2⋅x  + x  + 1

In [1]: ((x**(x/2))**2).expand()
Out[1]:
 x
x
```

The ticket is questioning this GiNaC code snippet (power.cpp:566):

```
        // Turn (x^c)^d into x^(c*d) in the case that x is positive and c is real.
        if (is_exactly_a<power>(ebasis) && ebasis.op(0).info(info_flags::positive) && ebasis.op(1).info(info_flags::real))
                return power(ebasis.op(0), ebasis.op(1) * eexponent);

Note there are two parts to this. If the outer exponent is a fraction then branches play a role and the discussion in #14305, which makes the GiNaC code in this case correct. This does not apply to the `sqrt(x)^2` case and even less to:

```
sage: ((x^(2*x))^2)
(x^(2*x))^2
```
