# Issue 17618: create is_preperiodic function for points of projective space

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17855

Original creator: bhutz

Original creation time: 2015-02-25 17:32:59

Assignee: bhutz

The function will take a point and map as input and return a boolean of whether or not the point is preperiodic for the map. Perhaps there should be an option to also return the period if the point is preperiodic

This incorporated a few additional changes

- there was an error in the error_bound canonical height computations which is now corrected

- heights and canonical heights are now computable for QQbar points

- methods to change QQbar points and maps to number field points and maps

- change_ring now accepts an embedding for points and maps

These examples don't seem to work:


```
P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(QQbar,2)
H = Hom(P,P)
f = H([x^2,y^2,z^2])
Q = P([1,1,1])
Q.is_preperiodic(f)
```



```
P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(QQbar,2)
H = Hom(P,P)
f = H([x^2,y^2,z^2])
Q = P([QQbar(I),1,0])
Q.is_preperiodic(f)
```

Yes, there were a couple issues with getting the right compositum base field. These should be fixed now.

From the review, for is_preperiodic need:
 - check that map is a morphism
 - check that given point is in the domain of the map
 - check that if over a number field, it is an absolute number field

Everything seems to be working well and the changes fixed all of the issues from the reviews.
