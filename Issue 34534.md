This is doing way too much conversions

```
H = libgap(aut_m).Intersection2(aut_B_aug)
rt_transversal = aut_B_aug.RightTransversal(H).List().sage()
rt_transversal = [PermutationGroupElement(g) for g in rt_transversal if str(g) != '()']
rt_transversal = [[a-1 for a in g.domain()] for g in rt_transversal]
rt_transversal = [g + list(xrange(len(g), n))
```

It would be nicer as

```
H = libgap(aut_m).Intersection2(aut_B_aug)
rt_transversal = aut_B_aug.RightTransversal(H)
rt_transversal = [[int(a) - 1 for a in g.ListPerm(n)] for g in rt_transversal if not g.IsOne()]
```

At the time guava is loaded, one should check for its availability. The standard way is

```
sage: from sage.features.gap import GapPackage
sage: pkg = GapPackage("guava")
sage: pkg.require()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
FeatureNotPresentError: gap_package_guava is not available.
`TestPackageAvailability("guava")` evaluated to `fail` in GAP.

Sure, thanks, I agree. My goal was to get it to work with libgap rather than pexpect gap, I mostly went with tweaking pre-existing code line by line.
