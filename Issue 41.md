That's really weird.  Many thanks for pointing out the problem.
That documentation is generated from the source code, so I'll investigate
the script that does the generation.  Again, thanks for the bug
report.

From Alec C:

```
Looking over the SAGE reference manual I found some crazy stuff in section
8.1 2D Plotting
 
* show*( self, [xmin=False], [xmax=None], [ymin=True], [ymax=125 ], [
figsize=None], [filename=[5, 4]], [dpi=None], [ axes=None], [axes_label=None
], [frame=None])
 
look at figsize, etc.   some other functions have the same problem, any
ideas?
 
This has been reported before.  It must be a bug in update, i.e,. that file
in <SAGE_ROOT>/devel/sage/sage/ref that I showed you.   We have to fix this.
 }}}
