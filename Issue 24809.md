The following will be confusing to casual users of Sage:

```
sage: p = (2^4-1)/3
sage: p
5
sage: is_prime(p)
False
sage: p.is_prime()
False
```


As suggested on https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/NN0VP-OVZLw, we should show a warning when a function like `is_prime` is called in such a context.  The seems to arise most frequently for fields, where general definitions necessitate a certain answer, but that answer is not consistent with subrings where the question has more arithmetic interest.

I looked through the discussion. It seems there is no consensus.

My own opinion is 

(1) No change to `.is_prime()`.

(2) Raise an error (not warning) for `is_prime(x)` when `x` is a field element. The error message may say "x is an element of a field. Try is_prime(ZZ(x)) or ZZ(x).is_prime()".

(3) Document that `is_prime(x)` does not work for field elements.

The error is solely to guide a casual user that inputs `is_prime(15/3)` for instance.

For a casual user, output `False` for `is_prime(15/3)` is still confusing even when there is a warning message.

I read the code after my comment.

The warning message is so detailed that a casual user will have enough guide. So warning is okay with me.

Moreover the code deals with number field case too. So raising error for field elements is not appropriate.

I made minor edits.

Now I am positive to the patch.
