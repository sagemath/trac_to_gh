# Issue 16550: Implement construction of finite state machine by copying another machine

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16787

Original creator: cheuberg

Original creation time: 2014-08-09 06:44:26

CC:  dkrenn skropf

Keywords: copy, initialization


```
sage: F = FiniteStateMachine()
sage: FiniteStateMachine(F)
```

led to a `NotImplementedError`.

This is now implemented.

Depends on #16786 ad the documentation refers to the attributes `input_alphabet`, `output_alphabet`.

I've moved the tests with wrong input to the test section. Apart from this, everything looks good, doctests pass and so on. Positive for me; feel free to set it to positive_review after cross-reviewing my changes.

Your change is fine; however, commit [04fdac4](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=04fdac4ff93676d58a6c3ec4197527fb73598676) lead to a merge conflict with #16538. I therefore merge `6.4.rc1`.

Please cross-review the resolution of the merge conflict.
