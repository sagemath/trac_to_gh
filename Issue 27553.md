# Issue 27553: compatibility with cplex 12.9

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27790

Original creator: dcoudert

Method `CPXsetlogfile` has been deprecated in cplex 12.8 and removed from cplex 12.9. We must instead use `CPXsetlogfilename`, introduced in 12.8.

This patch works with versions >= 12.8. However, we loose compatibility with versions < 12.8.

To maintain compatibility, we must be able to import `CPXsetlogfile` **only if** version < 12.8 and `CPXsetlogfilename` if version >= 12.8. Then, we can use `CPXversionnumber` to adjust usage. 
  I don't know how to do that.

1. merge failure

2. A possibility to make it work for both CPLEX versions, you can find out the CPLEX version from the Sage `setup.py` script and set a Cython constant so that you can use [Cython conditional statements](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/language_basics.html#conditional-statements).

Not sure how to do that and where to put the code (`setup.py`, `module_list.py` ?).

Somehow, we want to extract line `#define CPX_VERSION               12080000` from `cpxconst.h`, extract the number and use it for conditional compilation.

It would have been easier with an optional package and a proper `spkg-install`... I don't know where to put it. These optional Cython modules are not very handy.

> Somehow, we want to extract line `#define CPX_VERSION               12080000` from `cpxconst.h`, extract the number and use it for conditional compilation.

I don't think that can be done directly from Cython. Here is a suggestion (similar to what is done in [PyNormaliz](https://github.com/Normaliz/PyNormaliz))
- run a configure script (or whatever) to obtain the value of CPX_VERSION and write a line "CPX_VERSION=12080000" in a file cplex_config.py
- in the setup.py script, use the `clpex_config.py` to define a compile time constant and branch appropriately in the Cython code

If you find an easier way to access the `CPX_VERSION` macro directly from a `.pyx` file that would be great!

An idea to make the process transparent to users is to set the version number in `module_list.py`. I can get the version number like that, but I don't know how to use it with `OptionalExtension`.

```
sage: if os.path.exists(SAGE_LOCAL + '/include/cpxconst.h'):
....:     CPX_VERSION = subprocess.check_output(" grep '#define CPX_VERSION ' $SAGE_LOCAL/include/cpxconst.h | grep -o -E '[0-9]+' ", shell=True).strip()
....:     
sage: CPX_VERSION
'12080000'
```



---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2019-05-25 16:04:52

You can try the following (that works for normal extensions)

```
OptionalExtension(...,
   define_macros= [('CPX_VERSION', 12080000)]   # computed value
)
```

and the in the Cython code (with upper case)

```
IF CPX_VERSION >= 12080000:
    check( CPXsetlogfilename(self.env, NULL, NULL) )
ELSE:
    check( CPXsetlogfile(self.env, NULL) )
```

Since both versions of the code only use the `self.env` parameter you might want to isolate the `IF/ELSE` statement in a short `cdef` function.


---

Comment by dcoudert created at 2019-05-25 16:14:20

This is roughly what I already tried: use `define_macros`, and in `cplex_backend.pxd` use the macro to conditionally import methods from cplex.h, but I always get

```
Error compiling Cython file:
------------------------------------------------------------
...
     int CPX_PARAM_SOLNPOOLGAP = 2105
     int CPX_PARAM_SOLNPOOLINTENSITY = 2107
     int CPX_MAX = -1
     int CPX_MIN = 1

IF CPX_VERSION >= 12090000:
  ^
------------------------------------------------------------

sage/numerical/backends/cplex_backend.pxd:217:3: Compile-time name 'CPX_VERSION' not defined
```

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2019-05-25 16:16:51

try `compile_time_env` instead of `define_macros`  (see [cython thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cython-users/SOAVfEH7EBk))

I don't understand how I can use `compile_time_env`.

I pushed my current trial that is not working as can be seen from the patchbot.


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2019-05-26 16:45:02

line 240-241 of `src/setup.py` the `compile_time_env` variable is set up (globally). It seems that it erases any specific configuration at an `Extension` level.

Comment by dcoudert created at 2019-05-26 17:16:01

outch... Well, either we are able to find a smart solution, or we could decide to support only cplex >= 12.8 (released Oct 2017). We already dropped support of older versions when the API introduced file `cpxconst.h` (#11958).

---

Comment by dcoudert created at 2019-06-17 13:11:14

I'm more and more in favor of dropping support for cplex versions < 12.8. Indeed, we have an easy solution to support versions >= 12.8, but no simple, and more important working, solution for conditional compilation enabling to support < 12.8.


---

Comment by dcoudert created at 2019-08-21 16:35:09

another argument for dropping support of version < 12.8: the IBM academic initiative allows to get versions 12.8 and 12.9, and no prior version.

Comment by dcoudert created at 2019-10-08 12:17:09

We should either wait for #28382 or rebase this ticket on it as #28382 correct the types used in this backend.

The current branch is not working. It's an unsuccessful trial to detect cplex version at compile time. I will push a new branch soon.


---

Comment by dcoudert created at 2019-11-08 18:02:14

I pushed a new branch, built on top of 9.0.bet4 and #28382 (but not #28708, so corresponding doctests are still here).

The changes are in file `cplex_backend.pxd`

```diff
-     # sets the log stream file
-     int CPXsetlogfile (c_cpxlp * env, FILE * f)
+     # Set the log file
+     int CPXsetlogfilename(c_cpxenv * env, char * filename, char * mode)
```

and in file `cplex_backend.pyx`

```diff
-        cdef FILE *ff
         if name.lower() == "logfile":
             if value is None: # Return logfile name
                 return self._logfilename
             elif not value:   # Close current logfile and disable logs
-                check( CPXsetlogfile(self.env, NULL) )
+                check( CPXsetlogfilename(self.env, NULL, NULL) )
                 self._logfilename = ''
             else:             # Set log file to logfilename
-                ff = fopen(str_to_bytes(value), "a")
-                if not ff:
-                    raise ValueError("Unable to append file {}.".format(value))
-                check( CPXsetlogfile(self.env, ff) )
+                check( CPXsetlogfilename(self.env, str_to_bytes(value), "a") )
                 self._logfilename = value
```


The drawback of this branch is to loose compatibility with cplex versions prior to 12.8, but since it is more than 2 years old and that the current version is 12.9, this is certainly OK.
May be we should add something in [http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/linear_programming.html](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/linear_programming.html) ?
