CC:  @dimpase @antonio-rojas @timokau @kiwifb @vbraun tmonteil

As observed in #29084, ​fflas_ffpack compilation fails on a processor that supports AVX512 extensions with the default compiler on Ubuntu Trusty - gcc version 4.8.4 (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.4).

See `ubuntu-trusty-minimal` run at ​https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/414021553

`fflas_ffpack` configuration should check that the compiler actually supports the architecture flags that it wants to use.

It should be checked whether upstream has a fix for this.
Not the same upstream issue: https://github.com/linbox-team/fflas-ffpack/issues/284

This now actually works and fixes installation on `ubuntu-trusty-minimal` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/432608426?check_suite_focus=true).

But with this fix there's an error on `debian-jessie-standard` https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/432608838?check_suite_focus=true
Here the compiler supports only one of the avx512 flags.
