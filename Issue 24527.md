This was probably broken in #24097

I can confirm this works with my external code.

I don't know why two tests are failing on patchbot: they pass on my machine.

beta5 in general was quite broken on the patchbots. Ideally, the bots should retest it with beta6.

Yeah, the tests that fail seem to be related to Cython. Let's wait for beta6, then.

The patchbot for beta6 shows one known failure (#24827).
