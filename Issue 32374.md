In #31553 we added a line to the monkey-patched LISP "retrieve" function in sage:

```
  (setq msg (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (if (eq x '| |) " " x)) msg))
```

With the incorporation of https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/patches/102/ this should not be required anymore, so we can do away with it.

We still need to monkey-patch the "retrieve" function, though, because we need to modify the behaviour of maxima when asking questions (we need to raise an exception when that happens, because in library mode the user cannot answer questions)
