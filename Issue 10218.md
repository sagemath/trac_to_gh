Keywords: quotient ring integral domain

The attached patch corrects a typo in `sage.rings.quotient_ring.QuotientRing_generic.is_integral_domain` (missing parentheses).  In addition, the filtering of attribute errors has been removed.  It is unnecessary because all ideals have the attribute `is_prime`.  In the presence of the typo it gave misleading results:


```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: R.quo(x^2 - y).is_integral_domain()
True
sage: R.quo(x^2 - y).is_integral_domain(proof=False)
False
```

The docstring has been rewritten to mention the `proof` keyword, and the doctests revised.Â
