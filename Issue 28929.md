Here:

```python
                def new_coeff(c):
                    return new_hecke._base(c(args))
                return new_basis._from_dict({w: new_coeff(c) for w, c in self})
```

all the `new_coeff` does is make the code a little easier to read. However, given the compactness, I think it would be better to do

```python
                return new_basis._from_dict({w: new_hecke._base(c(args))
                                             for w, c in self})
```

as I doubt Python optimizes out that little function call (at least, I think it might be more likely to do so if it is a lambda function).

A while-we-are-at-it: Period removal from error messages:

```
raise ValueError("%s and %s must be invertible." % (A._q1, A._q2))
```


Otherwise LGTM.
