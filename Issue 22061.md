What about


```
elt = dict({ x for x in dict(HLP(m(la))).iteritems() if x[0] in self._kbounded_partitions })
```


in `src/sage/combinat/sf/k_dual.py`?

I can review this one.

Seems to be OK and tests passed. Feel free to mark as positive_review now, of check `src/sage/combinat/sf/k_dual.py`, whichever you want.

Thank you, Jori.

I have found another missing case, and treated it too.

Typo: parenthesis at the end of

`for (nn,lmbda,mu,uu),(kk,f) in iteritems(QDM[n,1]))`
