Keywords: threejs

Since Sage 8.3.beta3, running the command

```
show(sphere(), viewer='threejs', online=True)
```

in a Jupyter notebook displays nothing. It was fine in Sage <= 8.3.beta2. 
Note that the option `online=True` is required by tools like http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/.

It seems that the issue is due to the following change introduced in #25040 (which has been merged in Sage 8.3.beta3):

```
sage: installed_packages()['threejs']
'r80.p0'
```

while in Sage <= 8.3.beta2, one has

```
sage: installed_packages()['threejs']
'r80'
```

Indeed the value of `installed_packages()['threejs']` is used to form the url in lines 749-750 of `src/sage/repl/rich_output/display_manager.py` and it turns out that https://cdn.rawgit.com/mrdoob/three.js/r80/build/three.min.js is a valid url, while https://cdn.rawgit.com/mrdoob/three.js/r80.p0/build/three.min.js is not.

That's a really bad idea for multiple reasons.

Yes probably. I guess that was to ensure compatibility between the version of threejs actually used by Sage. By the way, in the directory `upstream`, we have `threejs-r80.tar.gz`, so where does the `.p0` come from?

That was indeed to ensure that the same version is used. If there is a better way - please implement it! And an obvious way to get rid of patched suffixes for this particular case is to just use the part of the version before the dot.

The use of is `installed_packages` at runtime in sage is of course one of my pet hates. I don't have an alternative to offer at the present time. In fact I am just realising how this bit is broken in sage-on-gentoo right now (I don't offer an offline option either). Where could I find a list of valid versions for the online cdn? Is there something like "latest"?
