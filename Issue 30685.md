# Issue 30685: Fix dependencies of upstream Python packages

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30922

Original creator: mkoeppe

Various Python packages that we use do not declare their dependencies correctly using python packaging metadata. 

This is not visible in a standard build of the Sage distribution because we manually manage dependencies using Sage-specific dependency information. But it becomes problematic as we move toward using standard Python infrastructure in #29705.

On this ticket we track the upstream issues.

pplpy 0.8.6 is released on PyPI. It declares (hopefully) correctly its dependencies.

Moving this ticket to 9.4, as it seems unlikely that it will be merged in 9.3, which is in the release candidate stage
