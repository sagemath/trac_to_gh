This was my first contribution to Sage, so, I tried to do something simple: I added a standard group presentation to the Heisenberg group over integers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenberg_group).

Once it has been accepted and I am sure how everything here works, I will try more complex collaborations.

Welcome to Sage (development).

Overall it looks good. However, I would like to see a little bit more functionality before putting this in Sage:

- Allow arbitrary `n` (so it will be `2n + 1` dimensional).
- Call the generators `pi` and `qi`, where `i = 1, ..., n`.
- Have a second parameter that takes a prime p or 0 that denotes the base field of *Z*/p*Z*.
- Have the group as a matrix group.

If you do not want to do this, then I can.

Also, if you could split the long docstring lines to at most 80 characters and add a reference to the wikipedia page:

```
REFERENCES:

- :wikipeida:`Heisenberg_group`
```

Travis Scrimshaw,

I will take a look at what you said and try to improve the contribution.

Thanks for the comments!

Regarding your comments, I think the only thing that is missing now is

> "Have the group as a matrix group."

I didn't understand what you mean by that... Because in a presentation, we use only letters of an alphabet and they are viewed as abstract symbols. They can be related with matrices by homomorphism (mapping generators to elementary matrices).

Do the same construction as above but have a method to return a `MatrixGroup`. For an example, see `sage/groups/matrix_gps/binary_dihedral.py`. Although this can be done on a followup ticket too.

Now I think it is ok.  (:

Please, take a look to the file _src/sage/groups/matrix_gps/heisenberg.py_

I expanded what the matrix implementation can handle to any finite ring. I also fixed up some of the documentation. There was also some other miscellaneous changes I made. If my changes look good, then positive review. Thank you!

Yes, they seem good.  I tried to do something like that, but I started to get some errors like this:

TypeError: base ring is not supported by GAP


Thanks for helping!
