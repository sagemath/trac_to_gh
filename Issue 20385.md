Changing keywords from "" to "species, LazyPowerSeries".

I think we can close this, since the new `LazyPowerSeries` code has been merged.

Possibly, but there might be some other refactoring independent of the power series stuff that could be desired. It would be good if there was a little bit more information in this regard.
