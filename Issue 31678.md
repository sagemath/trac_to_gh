Update the `dependencies` file for symmetrica
as xz is needed to unpack it.

We change the dependencies file from

```
```

to

```
xz
```

like the one for gmp.
| xz

Unclear to me why this was necessary. I think we were using order-only dependencies correctly. See #32031, where this is happening again for another package
