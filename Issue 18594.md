# Issue 18594: Hyperelliptic point counting various methods disagree

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18831

Keywords: hyperelliptic curves, point counting

Various methods of point counts on a hyperelliptic curve produce a result but disagree.


```python
R.<t> = PolynomialRing(GF(11))
H = HyperellipticCurve(t^5 -t + 1)
print H.count_points()
print H.count_points_exhaustive()
print H.count_points_frobenius_polynomial()
print H.count_points_matrix_traces()
```


Output:


```
[8]
[19]
[19]
[8]
```


This is reproducible in the single cell sage server and sagecloud.

Changing priority from minor to major.

I guess there is a problem with the p-adic precision used.
The formula used should be checked.
It currently reads:

```
(ZZ(4*g).exact_log(p) + n//2).floor() + 1
```

The `4*g` part does not look so good.

Actually it makes senses, it comes from expressing the trace of the frobenius on an extension as a sum of powers of the eigenvalues.
So maybe the `//` is the problem.

Changing priority from major to critical.

Should be ok now.

I've also cleaned up the Sphinx doc a little bit.

typo ``a_g``` at beginning of the diff

otherwise, looks good to me.

By the way, what do you think of the new proposal for patchbot icons ? (click on top right roundel of this page to see some of them)

It seems to me the new icons make more sense than the previous ones.
