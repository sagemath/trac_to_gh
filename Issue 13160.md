Keywords: latex chinese

When use the LaTeX system,the Chinese characters are missing.For example:



```
%latex

This is English,$\sqrt{a!^!{2} + b!^!{2}}$. now it is Chinese: 中文测试! But they are missing!
```

In the result,these Chinese characters is missing.

The cause for this is that the CJK package is not included in SAGE/devel/sage-main/build/sage/misc/latex.py .The CJK package is to deal with Chinese,Japanese and Korean.

Fix it:
 Add :


```
\usepackage{CJKutf8}
```

in COMMON_HEADER.
 Add : "\\begin{CJK}{UTF8}{gbsn}\n " after ”\\begin{document}\n“ in line 1041,1045,1083.

Add :”\n\n\\end{CJK}\n“  before ”\n\\end{document}” in line 1050,1052,1071.
