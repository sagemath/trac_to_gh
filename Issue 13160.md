Keywords: latex chinese

When use the LaTeX system,the Chinese characters are missing.For example:


```
%latex

This is English,$\sqrt{a!^!{2} + b!^!{2}}$. now it is Chinese: 中文测试! But they are missing!
```
In the result,these Chinese characters is missing.

The cause for this is that the CJK package is not included in SAGE/devel/sage-main/build/sage/misc/latex.py .The CJK package is to deal with Chinese,Japanese and Korean.

Fix it:
 Add :

```
\usepackage{CJKutf8}
```
in COMMON_HEADER.
 Add : 

```
\\begin{CJK}{UTF8}{gbsn}\n
```
  
after : 

```
\\begin{document}\n
```
 in line 1041,1045,1083.

Add :

```
\n\n\\end{CJK}\n
```


 before: 

```
\n\\end{document}
```
 in line 1050,1052,1071.
