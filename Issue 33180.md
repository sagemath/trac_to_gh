# Issue 33180: Remove lexicographic order of CC, CDF elements

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33417

Our complex numbers are currently ordered lexicographically:

```
sage: CDF(1+2*I) < CDF(1-2*I)
False
```

This is in contrast to the built-in Python type `complex` and general Python 3 semantics:

```
sage: complex(1+2*I) < complex(1-2*I)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-5-3575b3aa8341> in <module>
----> 1 complex(Integer(1)+Integer(2)*I) < complex(Integer(1)-Integer(2)*I)

TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'complex' and 'complex'
```

To me, it is not so clear that this needs to be changed. As another data point, Numpy implements comparisons as well:

```
sage: from numpy import complex128
sage: complex128(CDF(1, 2)) < complex128(CDF(1, -2))
False
```


Comparisons can be quite convenient when writing code that should work for both `RDF` and `CDF`. For example, I tend to sort the eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices.

`numpy` is of course an important data point. Indeed https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sort.html#numpy-sort explains that they use lexicographic sort order for complex numbers too.
