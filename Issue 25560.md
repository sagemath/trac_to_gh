This and #25796 are in the kinda-fun category of things to play with in Sage. If you have a few moments, I'd appreciate a review (but this is far from a priority, so feel free to ignore).

Hello !

The raise "invalid rule" must be doctested.

Trivial rebase (just in the master reference file). I will add the doctests tomorrow when I get into my office.

I am doing okay. Australia is thinking of starting to relax restrictions in a few weeks. How are things for you?

Here I'm doing ok too, sort of. Trying hard not to turn crazy.

Some more comments:

Pyflakes plugins is not happy.

Maybe use https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ in the header (with https)

What is the default behaviour of evolve : how many steps if number is None ?

Maybe the name András Kaszanyitzky should appear in the file itself ?

Fixed.

Fixed, I think.

I don't think this is necessary as there is a reference to the paper itself and I don't think there is a natural place to put it.
