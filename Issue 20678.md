# Issue 20678: Plotting Set Partitions as Chord Diagrams

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jcourtie

Original creation time: 2016-07-01 01:43:45

CC:  vripoll egunawan tscrim aram.dermenjian

Keywords: SetPartition,days78

We would like to implement ways to plot set partitions as chord diagrams. For example, the partition {{1,2,4},{3}} should display the MacDonald logo with a dot below the second arc.

We are thinking to do it in two or three different ways:
-implement it as a graphic object to display it directly in Sage;
-giving a tikz code to be directly plugged in a latex document;
-maybe in ascii art (to be plotted in a terminal for example)

This is a work in progress, realized during the Sage Days 78.

I tried the example

`SP=SetPartitions(4).random_element().plot()` 

and it looked weird.

Aram will look into moving his tikz code for drawing the circular representation. You can follow the latex set up in dyck_word.py

The new latex method works nicely for {'plot':'linear'} even when self.base_set() contains strings. Shall we change this so that it also works nicely for 'plot':'circular'} ? Currently:

```
sage: p=SetPartition([['a','c'],['b',1],[20]])
sage: p.set_latex_options({'plot':'linear'})
sage: latex(p)
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
    \node[below=.05cm] at (0,0) {$a$};
    \node[draw,circle, inner sep=0pt, minimum width=4pt, fill=black] (0) at (0,0) {};
    \node[below=.05cm] at (1,0) {$1$};
    \node[draw,circle, inner sep=0pt, minimum width=4pt, fill=black] (1) at (1,0) {};
    \node[below=.05cm] at (2,0) {$c$};
    \node[draw,circle, inner sep=0pt, minimum width=4pt, fill=black] (2) at (2,0) {};
    \node[below=.05cm] at (3,0) {$b$};
    \node[draw,circle, inner sep=0pt, minimum width=4pt, fill=black] (3) at (3,0) {};
    \node[below=.05cm] at (4,0) {$20$};
    \node[draw,circle, inner sep=0pt, minimum width=4pt, fill=black] (4) at (4,0) {};
    \draw[color=black] (2) to [out=90,in=90] (0);
    \draw[color=black] (3) to [out=90,in=90] (1);
\end{tikzpicture}
sage: p.set_latex_options({'plot':'circular'})
sage: latex(p)
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
\end{tikzpicture}
```

It does work properly when circular. I just hadn't included "circular" as one of the plots. The options were: cycle, cyclic, and circle... I'll go ahead and add circular as well. Here is an example of it working if you wanna check it out:


```
sage: p=SetPartition([['a','c'],['b',1],[20]])
sage: p.set_latex_options({'plot':'circle'})
sage: latex(p)
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
    \node[draw,circle, inner sep=0pt, minimum width=4pt, fill=black,label=90:a] (0) at (90:1cm) {};
    \node[draw,circle, inner sep=0pt, minimum width=4pt, fill=black,label=18:1] (1) at (18:1cm) {};
    \node[draw,circle, inner sep=0pt, minimum width=4pt, fill=black,label=-54:c] (2) at (-54:1cm) {};
    \node[draw,circle, inner sep=0pt, minimum width=4pt, fill=black,label=-126:b] (3) at (-126:1cm) {};
    \node[draw,circle, inner sep=0pt, minimum width=4pt, fill=black,label=-198:20] (4) at (-198:1cm) {};
    \draw[-] (0:1cm) arc (0:72:1cm);
    \draw[-] (72:1cm) arc (72:144:1cm);
    \draw[-] (144:1cm) arc (144:216:1cm);
    \draw[-] (216:1cm) arc (216:288:1cm);
    \draw[-] (288:1cm) arc (288:360:1cm);
        \draw[-,thick,color=black] (1.center) -- (3.center) -- cycle;
        \draw[-,thick,color=black] (4.center) -- cycle;
        \draw[-,thick,color=black] (0.center) -- (2.center) -- cycle;
\end{tikzpicture}
```

Finished merging with Sage 7.5rc1 and have fixed some doctests. Everything seems to be working and is ready for review.

Everything seems to work fine, but there are a few things that need some polish before this can get into Sage.

- You should have a blankline between methods.
- You should state all types of inputs for the various options in `set_latex_options`. I had to look at the code to figure out what valid inputs are. You might also want to do some validation and/or standardization of the inputs in this method too.
- Remove the sentence `The default values are set in the ``__init__`` function.`. This is actually false with your current implementation, but I do think all default options should be set in the `__init__` for code simplicity.
- The default plot should be ```''```.
- The `INPUT` items should not start with a capital letter.
- `set_latex_options` should take keyword arguments, so `**opts`, that way you can do inputs of the form `SP.set_latex_options(color='blue')`.
- Add some line breaks to try to keep around 80 chars per line.
- Add more examples with the various plot options and use the `.. PLOT::` directive in the `plot` method too.

`@`tscrim I didn't understand what you meant by:
The INPUT items should not start with a capital letter.

I didn't see any of the inputs beginning with a capital letter. Can you give more detail as to which one you are thinking of? I've also gone ahead and fixed/added all the additional things you mentioned. (Minus adding default options in the __init__ code as I don't know what the original authors wanted for default options)

Comment by tscrim created at 2017-01-08 20:40:10

Something like this:

```
+        - ``fill`` -- (default: False) If True then fills black, else you can
+          pass in a color to alter the fill color. *Only works with cyclic plot*
+
+        - ``show_labels`` -- (default: True) If True shows labels - *only works
+          with plots*
+
+        - ``radius`` -- (default: "1cm") Radius of circle for cyclic plot. *Only
+          works with cyclic plot*
+
+        - ``angle`` -- (default: 0) Angle for linear
```

These should not start with capital letters (the dev guide used to not do this  it has been changed back), nor should they end with periods.

I just integrated to the latest dev and tested things out. Everything seems to be working as expected. Should be ready for integration if there are no more things to change.

Comment by tscrim created at 2017-04-12 05:55:14

Just a few more things. Once these are done, then I think this should be at a positive review.

- Thinking a bit, I probably would have `plot = None` (or maybe `False`) instead of `''` to better indicate that it is using set notation, as it different than a type of plot.
- You can link methods by using `:meth:`set_latex_options``.
- Remove the base `else` in `_latex_` as the return as the return in `if latex_options["plot"] == "":` makes the `else` statement vacuous. That way the large block of code is not as indented.
- The example plot in `plot` should be connected to an actual example in order to illustrate what is being plotted.
- Could you break the long line `diag += arc(center=...`.
- Extra blank line in `set_latex_options` before the `color` option.

Thanks Travis. I hadn't actually finished testing it, but it seems like you did the testing. I've gone ahead and double checked everything and it all looks good on my end too. As you had recommended I moved the ticket to "postive review".

The best way to fix this probably is:

```diff
-base_set = self.base_set().list()
+base_set = sorted(self.base_set(), key=str)
```


```diff
-for j in partition:
+for j in sorted(partition, key=str):
```

(Side note, it probably would have been better to use `'a str {}'.format(input)` or `'a str %s' % (input)`, but this is more about readability.)

I've gone ahead and did a sorting as well for the partitions and did a test run and it seems to work again. `@`tscrim wanna try it on your end to double check and then we can do another postive review? I don't see anything else that can be sorted for orderings.

Yep, that works for me, but I am only testing on Ubuntu. I've added a linear plot latex example to make sure we have full test coverage.

From looking at the code, there is no way to have non-deterministic doctests now. Thinking for another second, before it should have been clear that we needed to also sort `self`.
