All doctests pass here on my `old` hardware `Dual-Core AMD Opteron 2218` with `gcc version 4.9.3 (Gentoo 4.9.3 p1.5, pie-0.6.4)`.

Positive review then ? :)
I don't think this can really worsen the current situation.

The only way to know is to send it to the bots. I am putting Steve as a reviewer because he did real world testing and I won't pretend to have done it. Too much on my plates with work, other tickets and the clang fun.

OK, so now I know. For the bots to do their thing we need `positive_review`. And Fran√ßois this seems to build on SoG without any of the patches needed for `openblas-0.2.15`.
