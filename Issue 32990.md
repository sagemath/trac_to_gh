This isn't reproducible, but googling that `SystemError` shows that similar problems have been reported occasionally:

`log_gamma` evaluation calls C++ `lgamma` which calls back into Python, so it must not be wrapped in a `sig_on/sig_off` block 

```
const numeric numeric::lgamma(PyObject* parent) const {
        int prec = precision(*this, parent);
        PyObject* field = CBF(prec+15);
        PyObject* ret = CallBallMethod0Arg(field, const_cast<char*>("log_gamma"), *this);
        Py_DECREF(field);

        numeric rnum(ret);
        return ex_to<numeric>(rnum.evalf(0, parent));
```
