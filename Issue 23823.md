According to the one patchbot, it doesn't apply. But the Trac plugin says that it does.

I assume that the problem is with the patchbot, since the conflicting file (`map_reduce.py`) is not touched by this ticket.

I just rebased it immediatly after posting,so the patchbot must have taken the bad version

Funny, this one:

```
bool(misc.mul([x.valuation(p) >= 0 for x in self.ainvs()]))
```

It shows a particular way of thinking by mathematicians.

This will conflict with #24055.

Do you know what goes wrong in Python 3? Can you post the traceback?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2017-10-30 20:27:52

This is not strictly related to python3-build, only to allow the use of "python -3" diagnostic tool with a python2-build.

I once observed something when typing "python -3 src/sage/all.py" in sage-shell. But I cannot manage to reproduce what I remember.

If this is fixing a problem that you cannot reproduce, shouldn't we just close this ticket as invalid?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2017-10-31 18:09:38

Well, I would still prefer to have these more specific imports..

I think the changes are fine.  Jeroen, if you object, feel free to set this back to Needs Work.
