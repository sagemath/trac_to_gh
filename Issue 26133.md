CC:  @mstreng

Create a new folder invariants in rings as a general location for invariants of different types of curves and forms.

This also allows reconstruction of curves or binary forms to be put here. For binary quintics, this is part of ticket #25508. Binary forms of degree 8 are part of ticket #22173 and could also be moved here (see also comment 34 on this ticket).
