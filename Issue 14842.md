Why make a special case for `self < 0`? This is bad:

```
sage: RIF(-1/2,-1/3).unique_round()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-4-6a343dbc6aff> in <module>()

ValueError: interval does not have a unique round (nearest integer)
sage: RIF(-1/2,1/3).unique_round()
0
```

If an interval doesn't have a unique round, a larger interval certainly should not have a unique round.

Since `RIF(-1/2).unique_round()` should give `-1`.
