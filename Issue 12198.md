Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: matrices, is_singular

The matrix method is_singular for matrices currently returns


```
    self.det() == 0
```


It would be faster to check for full rank instead.

Changed `is_singular` method to use rank instead of determinant, which is much faster for generic matrices (particularly over ZZ). Fixed also an inconsistency in the error raised by `determinant` for nonsquare matrices, as it returns different error messages over the rationals.

Change is fairly minimal, and tests pass on my machine (Mac OS 10.6.8). Ready for review.
