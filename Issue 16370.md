There are functions all over the library which accept various optional named parameters. Often the intention is that these will only be used as keyword parameters, but that fact is not enforced. Maintaining a huge number of possibly positional parameters can become a maintainance pain. (I'm currently seeing a mild version of this in #16533, but things could be *much* worse.)

While [PEP 3102](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/) introduced syntax for this for Python 3, the most reasonable way to add such an enforcement in Python 2 would be via a decorator. So I propose introducing a decorator which will limit the number of positional parameters passed to its wrapped function. To faciliate [graceful deprecation](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_in_python.html#deprecation), it might be associated with a trac ticket number and pass extra positional arguments after issuing a deprecation warning.

Once Sage moves to Python 3 (and I hope Sage will live long enough to make that step unavoidable), we could probably refactor those into proper keyword-only arguments, perhaps even automatically using some 2to3 plugin if there is a sufficient number to warrant that effort.

OK, here is my implementation. With a big fat warning about performance considerations, to reduce the chances of inappropriate use.

In comment:16:ticket:15515 I had to undo some changes by Jeroen Demeyer to avoid breaking compatibility for positional arguments. So it seems I'm not the only one who would like to get rid of some positional parameters to simplify implementations. With this tool here, we can have a proper deprecation period before we can finally dump them.

And with the `extra` keyword I introduced, things are even simpler for those cases. That keyword allows me to specify the names of any excess positional parameters, which will then be included in the `**kwds` dict so one doesn't have to mention them a second time when passing those arguments down the line.
