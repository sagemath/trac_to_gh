CC:  @jhpalmieri @dimpase @kiwifb @vbraun

This provides an alternative and strictly optional way of installing sage-the-distribution that may be useful for some users who wish to use `pip` to install everything they need.

It establishes a python-less SAGE_LOCAL hierarchy in the installed `package_data` of a new Python package `sage_local`.

It also installs `sage_conf.py` (#29038) to enable installing a sagelib using that SAGE_LOCAL>

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29039

At this point I can just start `tox -r -v -v -v` again, and it happily continues.
Not sure whether the final result is correct. 

Anyway, the error isn't good.
Looks like a bit of an error in a make rule, it tries to make `../pkgs/sage_conf/src/bin/sage-env-config`.
