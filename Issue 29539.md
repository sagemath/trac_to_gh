# Issue 29539: fix tab-completion for methods injected by MorphismMethods

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29776

Original creator: @mwageringel

Original creation time: 2020-06-01 14:45:26

For Cython classes that implement morphisms, the methods from `MorphismMethods` of the respective category are magically attached to elements of the class. However, tab-completion does not work on them.

For example, `sage.categories.rings` defines the morphism methods `extend_to_fraction_field` and `is_injective`:


```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: f = R.hom([x, y+1], R)
sage: f.extend_to_frac<TAB>  # should complete to f.extend_to_fraction_field
sage: f.is_injec<TAB>  # should complete to f.is_injective
```


This is fixed by improving the corresponding `__dir__` method.

Does the affect the method lookup time (the time it takes to call the methods) when the code is being run? For example, does it make something like `3.divides(9)` slower?

Method lookup does not actually call `__dir__`, which would be inefficient as `__dir__` returns a list. In fact, I am not sure if it is used for anything but tab-completion. The [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir) says that

    _[...] dir() is supplied primarily as a convenience for use at an interactive prompt [...]_

Thanks. I couldn't find any information if that was used during method lookup (cf. `__getattr__`, `__getattribute__`). That gave me an idea to test, and the `__dir__` is indeed only called on tab completion. Which also makes sense given its return type. Sorry for the dumb question. LGTM.
