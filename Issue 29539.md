For Cython classes that implement morphisms, the methods from `MorphismMethods` of the respective category are magically attached to elements of the class. However, tab-completion does not work on them.

For example, `sage.categories.rings` defines the morphism methods `extend_to_fraction_field` and `is_injective`:


```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: f = R.hom([x, y+1], R)
sage: f.extend_to_frac<TAB>  # should complete to f.extend_to_fraction_field
sage: f.is_injec<TAB>  # should complete to f.is_injective
```


This is fixed by improving the corresponding `__dir__` method.

Does the affect the method lookup time (the time it takes to call the methods) when the code is being run? For example, does it make something like `3.divides(9)` slower?
