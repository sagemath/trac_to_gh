# Issue 24320: EllipticCurve point cannot be multiplied with element from base_ring

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24557

A point from an elliptic curve over some finite field can only be multiplied by integers and not by elements from the base field:

(I tried to format as SAGE code, but did not find out how :/)

And why would this operation make sense? The group of points is not a vector space.

Oh, of course! I guess I was a bit confused yesterday. Sorry..
Can I close the ticket somehow or is this managed by setting the milestone to invalid?
