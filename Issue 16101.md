Prompted by [this sage-support discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/oijbs3xHQIA/discussion). Is it a good idea to always generate immutable codewords from a linear code?

IMHO, the fact that they are generated on the fly should make them immutable. It just makes no sense to change them! And immutability would allow them to be hashable without any hassle.

`@`dimpase thanks. New commit only adds immutable to documentation for the projective space iterator. Forgot that small change.
