Changing `^` to `**` in the string representation is a regression.

Thanks slelievre, I just did a global find/replace in that file to get it working. It's not yet ready for review, I still need to do proper documentation and get the tests working, which I'll soon get around to.

Something went wrong with your commit message,
in case you want to amend it and force-push.

> `Wrote more docstring content. Left some comments on some functions to turn private/public. # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting`

You could try `git commit --amend` and edit the commit message,
then `git push --force` to replace the previous commit.
