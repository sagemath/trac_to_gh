This question arose from ticket #30239, [comment:36](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30239#comment:36).

Should `FiniteRankFreeModule` and manifold object always return a mutable copy, even for trivial operations? At least, this would be a consistent behavior.

As pointed out by Matthias, this already holds true for `FreeModule`:


```
sage: M = FreeModule(QQ, 3)
sage: v = M([1,2,3])
sage: w = v + 0
sage: w == v
True
sage: w is v
False
```


I feel quite torn about this, but tend to the copy-version.

**Addendum:**

For `FreeModule`, we also have the following behavior:


```
sage: M = FreeModule(QQ, 3)
sage: M(0)
(0, 0, 0)
sage: M.zero()
(0, 0, 0)
sage: M.zero() is M(0)
False
```


I don't think that a parent should do that, especially when it already has a `zero` method. Should that be changed?

Both `M()` and `M(0)` return a new mutable element. That's how one creates a new vector, whose components can then be modified. If you want the immutable 0 element, you can use `M.zero()`.

The arithmetic operations should either always create an immutable element or always create a new mutable element. It would be very inconvenient if the result of an operation was sometimes immutable, sometimes a new mutable element, depending on the input. (And it would be highly problematic if sometimes it would return an existing mutable element.)

Symbolic expressions are immutable and therefore do not need to be copied.

The cost of making a copy should be dominated by copying the dictionaries in the Components objects.

If making a copy is so costly, we should try to optimize it.

If I remember correctly, until Sage 9 or so, all elements emerged from arithmetics were created from scratch, even the trivial ones. Even if copying would slow the current code down a bit, it should be still faster than versions before Sage 9.

Copying a symbolic expression with hundreds of terms will always remain slower than returning `self` or `other`. 

> If I remember correctly, until Sage 9 or so, all elements emerged from arithmetics were created from scratch, even the trivial ones. 

That's not true: already in Sage 7.4, we have the code snippet shown in comment:4.

My memory was partially wrong. For scalar fields, the `_is_zero` variable was already implemented, for tensor fields it was not.

Furtermore, I've compared some computation times:

**Current state:**


```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='topological') # the 2-dimensional sphere S^2
sage: U = M.open_subset('U') # complement of the North pole
sage: c_xy.<x,y> = U.chart() # stereographic coordinates from the North pole
sage: V = M.open_subset('V') # complement of the South pole
sage: c_uv.<u,v> = V.chart() # stereographic coordinates from the South pole
sage: M.declare_union(U,V)   # S^2 is the union of U and V
sage: xy_to_uv = c_xy.transition_map(c_uv, (x/(x^2+y^2), y/(x^2+y^2)),
....:                                intersection_name='W',
....:                                restrictions1= x^2+y^2!=0,
....:                                restrictions2= u^2+v^2!=0)
sage: uv_to_xy = xy_to_uv.inverse()
sage: f = M.scalar_field({c_xy: 1/(1+x^2+y^2), c_uv: (u^2+v^2)/(1+u^2+v^2)},
....:                    name='f')
sage: %timeit f+0
The slowest run took 177.32 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 5: 4.22 µs per loop
sage: %timeit f*1
The slowest run took 50.53 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 5: 11.8 µs per loop
```



**Returning a copy:**


```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='topological') # the 2-dimensional sphere S^2
sage: U = M.open_subset('U') # complement of the North pole
sage: c_xy.<x,y> = U.chart() # stereographic coordinates from the North pole
sage: V = M.open_subset('V') # complement of the South pole
sage: c_uv.<u,v> = V.chart() # stereographic coordinates from the South pole
sage: M.declare_union(U,V)   # S^2 is the union of U and V
sage: xy_to_uv = c_xy.transition_map(c_uv, (x/(x^2+y^2), y/(x^2+y^2)),
....:                                intersection_name='W',
....:                                restrictions1= x^2+y^2!=0,
....:                                restrictions2= u^2+v^2!=0)
sage: uv_to_xy = xy_to_uv.inverse()
sage: f = M.scalar_field({c_xy: 1/(1+x^2+y^2), c_uv: (u^2+v^2)/(1+u^2+v^2)},
....:                    name='f')
sage: %timeit f+0
The slowest run took 23.78 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 5: 60.6 µs per loop
sage: %timeit f*1
The slowest run took 24.43 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 5: 33.4 µs per loop
```


That's a heavy loss of comutational time.

You are right. Actually they are not copied when copying chart functions (and hence would not be copied when copying scalar fields): the code of `ChartFunction.copy()` is indeed:

```
        resu = type(self)(self.parent())
        for kk, vv in self._express.items():
            resu._express[kk] = vv
        resu._expansion_symbol = self._expansion_symbol
        resu._order = self._order
        return resu
```

Here if `kk` is 'SR', `vv` is a symbolic expression.

That sounds like something we should attack.

However, the ingredient of scalar fields is `ChartFunction`, not `Component`. What do you think about my proposal in comment:19?

Or, alternatively, we apply the very same idea you proposed for `Component` to `ChartFunction`.

**Edit:**
> But complex code like this should only be written if absolutely necessary.

I just overread this tiny but important part.

What about simply making those `Components` immutable which are bound to tensors? Similar as my proposal in comment:19. Each time the components of a tensor are changed via `set_comp` or `add_comp`, a whole new `Component` is created from scratch (`self._new_comp` is invoked).

I think they're lower-hanging fruit for improving efficiency. For example, #30307 could make copying components faster.
