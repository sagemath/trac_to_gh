# Issue 10379: is_directed_acyclic is Cython (--> without NetworX) and its certificates

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10432

This patch contains an Cython implementation of a method testing whether a given digraph is acyclic. If it is, the method returns a topological sort, and returns a circuit otherwise. The method is then called through current Sage methods which relied on NetworkX

Looks very good.

Keep Cythonizing graph theory! :)

Line 791 of `sage/graphs/digraphs.py` should be `EXAMPLES:`
