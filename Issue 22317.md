I can't really comment on this patch, but I've successfully built sage with it on my Mac with homebrew (which provides gfortran, so the Sage gcc is not installed), using Apple's "gcc" (clang)

Just to be clear: I assume you mean with `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=no`, otherwise Sage will build and use GCC anyway.

Turns out I used a different "feature" of the build system. I had configured using `./configure CC=gcc-6 CXX=g++-6` (they are from homebrew) and then configure was happy; but then the build just used /usr/bin/gcc anyway. (This bug is #22646.)

What does "This requires an upstream patch" mean? That it should be applied to the upstream tarball?

(in fact one does not seem to need it to be applied to Sage, so this probably needs to be clarified in the ticket description)

That the patch from the linked github pull request should be applied to the Cython sources. In this case, the patch is added as `build/pkgs/cython/patches/create_extension.patch` and the Cython version number is bumped to force rebuilding Cython with that patch.
