These would be like "optional" packages, but enabled by default. 

Like "standard" packages, they would be included in the distribution built by `make dist`.

Users can use `configure --disable-SPKG` to disable them.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30383

Configuring with `--disable-notebook` does indeed disable the notebook, as advertised. Sage builds, and so does the documentation. I was a little surprised that all doctests passed, too.

Maybe related to the fact that you can't start the notebook once you are running Sage from the command line? With SageNB you could run `notebook()` from within Sage, but this is not possible any more, or at least not in an obvious way, or maybe it just hasn't been implemented by us.

I think it's just that nobody has worked on writing such tests. I guess there must be technologies for automatically testing web apps but I don't know about them or if Jupyter already uses them.
