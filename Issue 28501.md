I have not checked what's causing this but Python 2 builds fail with this error.

It would appear that `sage-system-python` is, well, not finding the system python.  Far less clear is why that command would seem to be invoking `sage-system-python` in the first place...

FWIW I was able to reproduce the problem locally, no problem.  But I haven't looked into what's causing it yet.

I see now.  Just recently (which is why I didn't see this at first; I hadn't pulled this update locally) in #28657 the `sage-location` script was changed to use `sage-system-python`, and `sage-location` is called by the main `sage` script.

I'm not sure yet exactly why this change was made but it should be perfectly possible to work around.

I'm now installing Python as a runtime dependency. Not sure that's the best way to fix this; I asked on #28657.

The change is explained in #28657: on some systems, for example the latest releases of Ubuntu, there is no `python` executable, just `python3`. On top of that, in a Python 3 build of Sage, we don't create a `python` executable. So we shouldn't expect `#!/usr/bin/env python` to work.

It sounds like `sage-system-python` is not robust enough, if it's not handling this situation.

Or `sage-location` should be able to use Sage's Python, if that's the only one available. Are there really systems with neither `python` nor `python3` on which Sage is expected to run?

The [SageMath](SageMath) download page at least does not say that you need Python.

Is Python pre-installed on Windows these days?

It comes pre-installed on macOS, but that's bound to change I think:

> Scripting language runtimes such as Python, Ruby, and Perl are included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software. In future versions of macOS, scripting language runtimes won’t be available by default, and may require you to install an additional package. If your software depends on scripting languages, it’s recommended that you bundle the runtime within the app. (49764202)
