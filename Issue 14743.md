CC:  dcoudert ncohen

While adding some graph generators I found some confusing things which I like
to improve with this patch first.

* Why are Butterfly, Krackhardt Kite, Barbell graph listed under
  "Basic Structures" while Peterson Graph and CompleteGraph are not?
  Maybe the term "basic structures" is subjective and everyone has a
  different opinion about basic...

* What is a "small graph"? A graph with a small number of vertices, alright?
  E.g. 13 vertices on http://www.graphclasses.org/smallgraphs.html
  In general not much more than 15 or 20 vertices. Can "Balaban11Cage()"
  with 112 vertices, "CameronGraph()" with 231 vertices, "Tutte12Cage()"
  with 126 vertices be called "small graphs"??


Overview of modifications on the files 'sage/graphs/graph_generators.py'
and 'sage/graphs/generators/*'.

Part 1
* "Small Graphs" (also called "named graphs" previously): Added documentation: "A small graph is just a single graph and has no parameter influencing the number of edges or vertices."

* Families of Graphs: Added documentation: "A family of graph is an infinite set of graphs which can be indexed by fixed number of parameters, e.g. two parameters."

* Pseudofractal graphs: The graph "DorogovtsevGoltsevMendesGraph" seems to be a quite special graph family. Does it need its own section? I completely moved it to Families now.

* HararyGraph is a family of graphs.

Note that some graphs in this section are not really small! Actually, I'd find
it better to called the section "individual graphs" (as on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallery_of_named_graphs) or stick with the previous
term "named graphs". (The renaming to "small graphs" happened in #13862. Sorry, I do not know the reason...)


Part 2
* "Platonic Solids" is a subsection of "Small graphs". This section is ordered by number of vertices now.

* "Chessboard graphs" is a subsection of "Families".

* RandomGNP returns graph, hence, "n" -- number of nodes of the graph (not: *digraph*)

Note, the formatting of the references in html (of RandomGNP) looks odd?!
Don't know what is wrong or how to correct this...


Part 3
* creating "Miscellaneous" section and renaming "world_map.py" to "miscellaneous.py"

* `cospectral_graphs`, `line_graph_forbidden_subgraphs`, `fullerences`, `trees`
  are not single graphs nor families of graphs; moving them in "Miscellaneous";

(Alternatively, one might leave them directly under "Graph Generators" without any section header the functions `canaug_traverse_edge`, `canaug_traverse_vert`, `check_aut`, `check_aut_edge`...)


Part 4
* Basic structures / "Some Commonly Used Graph": Actually these graphs can be listed in the other classes. Hence, I moved them to their corresponding section but sometimes left copies in this section, renamed to "commonly used graph generators".

  That is,
  "BarbellGraph", "CircularLadderGraph", "CycleGraph", "CompleteBipartiteGraph",
  "CompleteGraph", "CompleteMultipartiteGraph", "Grid2dGraph", "GridGraph",
  "PathGraph", "LadderGraph", "StarGraph", "ToroidalGrid2dGraph",
  "Toroidal6RegularGrid2dGraph", "WheelGraph" are families of graphs.

  "BuckyBall", "BullGraph", "ButterflyGraph", "ClawGraph", "DiamondGraph",
  "EmptyGraph", "HouseGraph", "HouseXGraph", "KrackhardtKiteGraph", "LollipopGraph"
  are "small graphs" ("named graphs").

  In other words, the most important graphs/graph families can be *double listed*
  to make it easier to find them. Yes, "most important graphs" is, of course,
  subjective but these graphs are now double listed anyway. I would choose graphs
  that are important to new users of SAGE.

  Alternatively, this section might be removed completely and the example
  above might be expanded... (Maybe this would the better solution.)

* removal of file "basic.py" (some kind of deprecation needed?)

Helloooooooooooooooooooo !!!

If I remember correctly, this "small graph" has also been called "named graphs" or "unique graphs" through time, none of which was satisfying. Because some named graphs are actually families, because "unique" has a mathematical meaning too... But it was meant to indicate that the constructor takes no parameter, indeed. "small" here means "bounded-size", I guess `:-)`

To me complete graphs should belong to the basic structures, Petersen not. Well, that's just my opinion on the matter.

Part 1:
It all makes sense to me. Individual graphs is a nice name too, btw. This being said, do these names really appear in Sage ? That's the module's name of course but users get those graphs through `graphs.<tab>`, so it's not that bad either. Not that it shouln't be changed if you think it's wrong of course.

Part 2:
- Why did you remove the index in chessboard.py ? An index is niiiiiiiiiice `:-P`
  Plus this module will not change much, so it's not very hard to keep updated.

- You changed the order of methods in the Platonic Solids, but the `append_to_doc` method reorders them according to the alphabetical order `:-P`

- What do you mean by "chessboard graphs are now a subsection of families" ?

- Bad formatting of Random GNP : could you open a ticket for that and add me in cc ?

Part 3:
- Why on earth wouldn't `fullerenes`, `trees`, `line_graph_forbidden_subgraphs` and `cospectral_graphs` be families of graphs ? `O_O`

- If these are not moves to `miscellaneous.py`, this module doesn't have any meaning if it just contains the world map. Actually, I created an independent file for this graph because it takes sooooooooooo much Python code to build.

Part 4:
Wow. This patch is a bit hard to read.

First, it seems from your message that after this patch is applied some method may be defined in two files, and we just don't do that. We'd be sure to fix a bug in one without fixing the other. Unless you imported one into the other file, in which case my reason for opposing this change is different :

First, I don't get your main argument : how can moving methods around in these files change anything for the users, when he can get them all through `graphs.<something>` ? These constructors have only been split because Jeroen didn't want the `graph_generators` file to grow too large, and the users do not even have to know that they exist. Is it just because of the index in `graph_generators.py` ?

Overall:
- You fixed typoes in `sage.graphs.graph_generators` in some places, but could you change it to `:mod:`sage.graphs.graph_generators`` instead ?

So far I agree with the first 3 parts, short of this question of things which you don't think are graph families. Tell me what you think ! `;-)`

Thanks for your comment!

Since a good name is not so easy to find, let us stick with the name and just add the description. That makes it clear enough.

>   Plus this module will not change much, so it's not very hard to keep updated.

Sure, I did not want to remove any index. But I am curious which index you are refering to. I thought

```
__append_to_doc(["BishopGraph", "KingGraph", "KnightGraph",
     "QueenGraph", "RookGraph"])
```

in the file "graph_generators.py" does this job nowadays. Is there another index??


> - You changed the order of methods in the Platonic Solids, but the `append_to_doc` method reorders them according to the alphabetical order `:-P`

Hmmm... Looking at the definition `def __append_to_doc(methods):` I cannot see that `methods` is reordered alphabetically nor is the output (HTML documentation) sorted alphabetically. I get


```
  TetrahedralGraph   HexahedralGraph     DodecahedralGraph
  OctahedralGraph    IcosahedralGraph
```

which is ordered by the number of vertices (not alphabetically). I think it is working...

 
> - What do you mean by "chessboard graphs are now a subsection of families" ?
In the documentation I changed the level of the heading of chessboard graphs. Now it looks like "Chessboard graphs" is a subsection of "Families of graphs". Similar with "Platonic solids".

 
> - Bad formatting of Random GNP : could you open a ticket for that and add me in cc ?
Done,  #15009.


> **Part 3:**
> - Why on earth wouldn't `fullerenes`, `trees`, `line_graph_forbidden_subgraphs` and `cospectral_graphs` be families of graphs ? `O_O`

Yes, they are families of graphs. What I wanted to say is that they do not return a single graph but a list of graphs or graph iterators. Especially, the function `cospectral_graphs` made me wonder since it differs from the others in the return type - a list of lists of graphs. Is a "family" (list) the same as "family of sets" (list of lists)? `;-)` Actually these function can be distinguished from the others because their names start with small letters. Hence, leaving them under "Families" is okay.

 
> - If these are not moves to `miscellaneous.py`, this module doesn't have any meaning if it just contains the world map. Actually, I created an independent file for this graph because it takes sooooooooooo much Python code to build.

I see. I think it is easier to lookup a file when the section title is similar to the filename, e.g. "Random graphs" <-> "random.py", "Miscellaneous" <-> "miscellaneous.py". And the file would also be open for new graphs other than world maps. That is my reasoning.

Unless you imported one into the other file, in which case my reason for opposing this change is different :

No, I took each function and put it either in `families.py` or `small.py` (never both!). My statement about "double listing" graphs might have been confusing. I only was referring to the documentation not the source code. I moved the source code of graphs considered as basic into their corresponding sections and listed the graph names only a second time under "Basic structures" in the reference documentation. That is all.

Helloooooooo !!

Right right, but there was another index in the `chessboard.py` file which your patch removes. And it's not thaaaaaaaaaat useful, but I still don't see why you want to remove it. It can only help to have an index of the methods in each module.

SOrryyyyyyyyyyyy ! I was convinced that I have made this method sort its input before building the table. I just re-read the code and it isn't so, you were right and there is nothing wrong with that.

I don't get this either : none of your patches touch a .rst file `O_o`

Cool ! `;-)`

Well... It is true, but if there is only one method there anyway, perhaps we can at least wait for another method before renaming the file... `:-P`

Well, the problem with this section is that it was made to split a big file in two, and there is no clear reason why some graphs should be there and not somewhere else... `^^;`

Thank you very much for your work on these files `:-)`

In other words, I added some text (short explaination) to the docstring
of the file `graph_generators.py` (after the headings "Small Graphs"
and "Families"). That is all - no change of name.

Previously, the file `graph_generators.py` contained all definitions
and a big index. After the splitting of this file most definitions are put into
several other files. The big index is still kept there. I thought to remove

```
- :meth:`BishopGraph <GraphGenerators.BishopGraph>`
- :meth:`KingGraph <GraphGenerators.KingGraph>`
   ...
```

from the file `chessboard.py` because
- I think it is a left over from the split and replaced by `__append_to_doc`;
- No other file under `sage.graphs.generators`, e.g. `random.py`, contains such an index;
- I do not know how to display this index other than by opening the file in a text editor;
Now I will leave it there but I have not understood your reasoning....

Looking at the docstring of `graph_generators.py` there is the heading
"* * Families of Graphs * *" and I formatted the other heading as "* Chessboard Graphs *" (note the number of stars). Hence, it looks like a subsection of "Families of Graphs".

Okay, let's wait for that.

True! I had thought of dissolving the section "basic structures", but the section can show users not familiar with graph theory what we consider as basic graphs... `;-)`

> Perhaps we could move some of them from Basic Structures to small graphs, though... As for some you are right to say that one would not immediately go look at the "basic structures" to find them. Like Claw graph, or House graph, or Diamond... Wheel could very well go to families, by the way.

Okay, I moved "Barbell-", "Bucky-", "WheelGraph" to other sections.

That is the point. Given a (mathematical) definition of some sort of graph it seems easier to tell whether it is just a single graph or whether a parameter or two are involved (i.e., a family of graphs) or whether a graph is derived from a complex data structure (i.e., from a geometric representation). In contrast it is more subjective to judge whether a graph is basic.

The patch is updated (based on 5.12beta1; part 3 is not applied anymore).

> Since you're cleaning up a lot anyway, how about changing `...` to `....:` in doctests?

Okay, I added part 5: [attachment:trac_14980-part5_doctests.patch].

(1) It improves the formatting of the doctests.

(2) As far as I know, there is no difference between

```
from sage.graphs.graph import Graph
from sage.graphs import graph

def ........
    import networkx
    g=graph.Graph(.....
```


and

```
from sage.graphs.graph import Graph

def ........
    import networkx
    g = Graph(.....
```


Hence, I replaced the former with the latter. (There were only `graph.Graph` expressions starting with `graph.`.)

Helloooooooooooooooooo !!!

This last patch seems ok, but I am no big fan of the empty "....:" lines after a loop. As it is not Suuuuuuch a bad thing, I uploaded another version of your last patch with these lines removed, and you can chose to use it in this ticket instead of the current last patch if you agree.
And if you prefer the way it is done right now you can set the ticket to `positive_review` anyway. Your pick `:-)`

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun !
