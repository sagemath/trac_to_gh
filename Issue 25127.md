Well... The idea is to fix them "when doing something else". Not to create more tickets for that.

there is a failing doctest

```
File "src/sage/rings/function_field/function_field_valuation.py", line 530, in sage.rings.function_field.function_field_valuation.DiscreteFunctionFieldValuation_base.extensions
Failed example:
    v.extension(L)
Expected:
    [(x)-adic valuation]
Got:
    (x)-adic valuation
```
