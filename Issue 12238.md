# Issue 12238: divergent alternating sum gives finite result

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: alternating sum divergent result

The two sums

```
sage: var('x');
sage: sum(1/x*(-1)^x, x, 1, oo)
-log(2)
sage: sum(1/x*(-1)^x, x, 0, oo)
-log(2)                              
```

return the same, but shouldn't. The latter sum is divergent because of the summand `1/0`.

It works correctly, when not using the `(-1)^x`, e.g.:

```
sage: sum(1/x^2, x, 1, oo)
1/6*pi^2
sage: sum(1/x^2, x, 0, oo) 
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: Sum is divergent.
```

(Calculating `sum(1/x<sup>2*(-1)</sup>x, x, 0, oo)` gives the wrong result, too.)

Yikes!  This is in Maxima.

(%i3) simplify_sum(sum(1/x*(-1)^x,x,0,inf));

And unfortunately 

```
(%i5) simplify_sum(sum((-1)^n/n,n,0,inf));

(%o5)                              - log(2)
```

though it shouldn't make a difference in any case.

This is now [Maxima bug artifact 3482792](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3482792&group_id=4933&atid=104933).

In Sage 6.3.beta4 we have

```
sage: var('x')
x
sage: sum(1/x*(-1)^x, x, 0, oo)
#0: simp_gen_harmonic_number(exp__=1,x__=-1)
#1: ratfun_to_psi(ratfun=-1/(2*?g2728-2),var=?g2728,lo=1,hi=inf)
#2: simplify_sum(expr='sum((-1)^x/x,x,0,inf))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: ECL says: Error executing code in Maxima: Zero to negative power computed.
```

So this is now throwing an error, although is it the right error, or is it good enough for the purposes of this ticket?

Changing priority from major to trivial.

It looks like the right error to me; since there is an invalid term in the series (1/0), an error saying "zero to negative power" sounds more reasonable to me than "divergent sum".

Here's a doctest.
