The current pickle jar mechanism has some drawbacks:

- We don't know how old pickles in the pickle jar are

- We may be testing an old pickle, but not a recent one

- Updating specific pickles is a bit tedious

Since the pickle jar is not so big (600k), what about the following procedure:

- For each version of Sage (say 4.6.2), a fresh pickle jar (say
  pickle_jar-4.6.2.tar.bz2) would be produced by the release manager,
  and *added* to the Sage distribution.

- sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all would be run by default on all pickle jars included with Sage.

- If some day some pickle rots away and it is decided *by consensus*
  to not support unpickling it anymore, then the patch author would
  include a note to the release manager to delete
  pickle_jar-4.6.2.tar.bz2/__class__s.....sobj

  This can be done by just copy-pasting from the error message of
  unpickle_all, without having to learn how to manipulate the jar.

- If space really becomes an issue, then pickle jars from old Sage
  distributions could be moved to an optional spkg. Also, if a pickle
  jar does not change at all between two versions, or only contains
  new pickles, then the previous one can be deleted.

While we're at it, why does the pickle jar need to be a `tar.bz2` file as opposed to just a directory in `data/extcode/pickle_jar`?  When distributing the pickle jar, it is contained in the extcode spkg anyway, so I don't see the gain of having an additional layer of tarring.

3. Updating specific pickles would become as easy as adding a patch to the Sage library.

Nicolas, just to make sure I understand you correctly, is your proposal the following:

1. Pickle jars are named after the Sage version (i.e. we would have a pickle_jar-4.6.2.tar.bz2 file or a pickle_jar-4.6.2 directory in my proposal).
2. We always *keep* the old versions unchanged (so sage-4.7 would still contain pickle_jar-4.6.2).
3. With every new Sage version, the release manager unpickles pickle_jar-$OLDVERSION, repickles them using the new Sage version and saves them as pickle_jar-$NEWVERSION.

I can see some merit to this proposal, however I would save only the pickles which actually changed.  Otherwise you will end up with lots of copies of the same pickle.

+1, definitely! Actually I did not suggest it earlier because I was
worrying about the disk space usage, not for the Sage distribution but
for the Sage install. But if there is a consensus that this is well
used disk space, let's go for it.

I was also wondering whether this could possibly slow down
unpickle_all since this would require loading lots of little files
instead of slurping in one large archive. Any clue?

Hi Jeroen!

Replying to [comment:4 jdemeyer]:
> Nicolas, just to make sure I understand you correctly, is your proposal the following:

I am going to use the occasion to amend a bit the proposal :-)

>  1. Pickle jars are named after the Sage version (i.e. we would have a pickle_jar-4.6.2.tar.bz2 file or a pickle_jar-4.6.2 directory in my proposal).

Yes.

>  1. We always *keep* the old versions unchanged (so sage-4.7 would still contain pickle_jar-4.6.2).

Yes. More precisely sage-4.7 would still contain the subset of the
pickles in pickle_jar-4.6.2 that:

- still unpickles properly in sage-4.7
- differ from the corresponding pickle in 4.7 (and any intermediate version)

>  1. With every new Sage version, the release manager unpickles pickle_jar-$OLDVERSION, repickles them using the new Sage version and saves them as pickle_jar-$NEWVERSION.

More precisely: the release manager recreates a fresh pickle jar by running all the sage tests with SAGE_PICKLE_JAR set (as described in unpickle_all). And then removes from pickle_jar-$OLDVERSION those that did not change. An easy thing to script.

> I can see some merit to this proposal, however I would save only the pickles which actually changed.  Otherwise you will end up with lots of copies of the same pickle.

+1; this is a good refinement of the last point in the ticket description. The comments above should take care of this.

Note that if the pickle_jar for 3.1 and 4.6.2 contain the same pickle X (version numbers just for the example), then I prefer to delete that of 3.1 and keep that of 4.6.2. Indeed, if X does not unpickle anymore with 4.7, then the relevant question is: "is it acceptable to not unpickle in 4.7 a pickle generated by 4.6.2?".

Do you mind rephrasing the ticket description accordingly, and then make a quick call for comments on sage-devel?

Thanks!

Cheers,
					Nicolas

Currently, the pickle jar contains 1174 files.  Assuming each file takes 4kB of actual disk space, this would use a few megabytes.  I don't think this is an issue.

Hi Nicolas,

I want to add to your proposal that the pickle_jar be properly documented. As far as I am aware, there is currently no documentation on what the pickle jar is for, how it should be used, and what to do when a pickle breaks with

```
sage -t  devel/sage-sf/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx
```

for example. A non-trivial example for using `register_unpickle_override` should also be added.

Secondly, I think that the procedure for adding new pickles to the jar needs to streamlined. Again, I don't believe that it is described anywhere when or how this happens, but I do know that there are many "new" classes which are not represented in the pickle_jar with the consequence that the pickle_jar is unable to check backward compatibility for these classes.

Andrew

Hi Volker!

I don't have a good view on the order of magnitudes. Yet, with the proposed protocol, pickles that don't change don't get duplicated between versions, and I'd expect that only a few pickles get changed from one version to the other (especially if we emphasize pickling by construction rather than by internal data structure). A good experiment would be to regenerate a new pickle jar, and see how much we have added to it since last time!

I don't have a strong opinion about whether the pickle jar should be maintained under git or not. If we can affor it, that makes things easier, as changes to the pickle jar can be done within the usual workflow. But if it's too big, it's too big.
