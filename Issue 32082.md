The reference for `ZZ.random_element` gives this description:

> If the distribution 'mpz_rrandomb' is specified, the output is in the range from 0 to 2<sup>x</sup>-1.


This does not match the GMP description:

> The random number will be in the range 2<sup>n-1</sup> to 2<sup>n</sup>-1, inclusive.


And can be observed with

```
sage: histogram([ZZ.random_element(1, distribution='mpz_rrandomb') for _ in range(100)])
```

The reference manual should be updated to reflect actual behavior of `mpz_rrandomb`.

If we want the originally described range 0 to 2<sup>x</sup>-1, `mpz_urandomb` should be added as a supported distribution.
