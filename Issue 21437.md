# Issue 21437: Doctest continuation marked / rings, misc

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Every grepping of source code is easier if there is just one way to do something. Also some user might wonder if there is a difference between `...` and `....:`. Hence I suggest mass change from old-style doctest continuation lines.

This part does that in rings and misc folder.

Done by


```
find src/sage/rings src/sage/misc -name '*.py' -or -name '*.pyx' | xargs perl -e 's|^( *)\.\.\.  |\1....:|g;' -p -i.bak
```
