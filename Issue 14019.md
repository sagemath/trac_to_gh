Assignee: jason, was

In the following, the user specified aspect ratio is currently ignored:

```
    sage: p = sphere()
    sage: p.aspect_ratio([10,1,1])
    sage: p.show()
```


The attached patch is but a proof-of-concept of solution. I don't know well enough the plot code to see if this is the right thing to do.

This is quite tricky. I think the modification to the `aspect_ratio` should be made much earlier since the scaling of the `frame_aspect_ratio` depends on the value of `aspect_ratio`. Will look into this.

Being rather inexperienced it might well be that it is my mistake (especially as the patchbot seems to be ok with the patch). Do I have to apply it to the latest pre-release? Or do you have any other ideas what's wrong?

No I don't think so. The folder name is missleading. I upgraded sage several times and the upgrades seem not to change the folder names.

On which version is the patch based on? I'll install the most recent pre-release and try whether I can apply it there...

IIRC, the patch is based on either sage-5.11-beta3 or sage-5.11-rc0. It should apply even to recent 5.12 prereleases since no one touches these graphics code. `:-)` The patchbot of course agrees!

I somehow still suspect that the problem is on my side. Do you have any Ideas? Or could you check whether you can apply it to 5.12beta4?

Thanks,

Hi Basu,

here my remarks on the patch. It applies perfectly and in almost all cases which I tested it fixes the bug. I only found the following case, where setting the aspect ratio seems still to be ignored:



```
var('x,y')
P=plot3d(x^2-9*y^2,(x,-3,3),(y,-1,1))
P.aspect_ratio((1,1,1))
P.show()
```


is different from


```
var('x,y')
P=plot3d(x^2-9*y^2,(x,-3,3),(y,-1,1))
P.show(aspect_ratio=(1,1,1))
```


furthermore I observed that by this patch


```
P.show(aspect_ratio=(1,2,3))
```

changes the value of

```
P._aspect_ratio
```

and thus also the behaviour in all following show() commands. One can surely discuss if this is usefull or not, but I think in the 2d plots the setting of aspect ration in a show command only affects this plot and not the following. I think the 3d behavior should be consistent.

Hi!

Thanks for fixing these issues. All the problems which I reported above are indeed fixed. 

I'm sorry to come up with another one: 

The problem occurs if one has plots, with very different axes scales e.g. 

```
var('x,y')
P=plot3d(x^2-100*y^2,(x,-10,10),(y,-1,1))
```

Without the patch the aspect ratio was automatically chosen such that all axes are equally long, if the user didn't set the aspect ratio. Now the aspect is automatically 1 which produces very degenerate plots, where one cannot see much. The user has thus to adjust the ration manually which seems a drawback to me. 

As far as I understand in my limited view the problem is the following:

-the default value of self.aspect_ratio() is (1,1,1)
-the default show option for aspect ratio is 'automatic'
-before it has been ignored if self.aspect_ratio() has been set manually and if there was no aspect ratio argument in show(), now the show argument aspect_ratio='automatic' is ignored and instead self.aspect_ratio() is taken. I the user didn't change anything, this is however equal to (1,1,1) and produces a different result. 

I'm not sure how to fix this, but here some ideas which might hopefully be helpful. Is it maybe possible, that the default value of self.aspect_ratio() is 'automatic'? Then there would be no degenerate plots if the user doesn't change anything.
But even then we would have a problem: If the user sets the aspect by 
`self.aspect_ratio((1,2,3))` 
and later wants a plot with the automatic aspect ratio
`P.show(aspect_ratio='automatic')`
then this would again be ignored. Wouldn't it accordingly be also necessary to set the SHOW_DEFAULT of aspect_ratio to None??? If the show option aspect_ratio is None, we replace it by `self.aspect_ratio()` which is be default "automatic". This would allow to distinguish between no user input and the input 'automatic' but still return the automatic aspect_ration if the user does nothing at all.

Ok. I updated the patch and also fixed this bug:

```
sage: show(cube(), frame_aspect_ratio=1)
...
TypeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object is not iterable
```


The inconsistency in comment:12 remains, but it can not be reliably fixed.
We can check for `aspect_ratio=[1.0,1.0,1.0]` in addition to
`aspect_ratio='automatic'`, but then a small change in `aspect_ratio`, for
example, `aspect_ratio=[1.1, 1.0, 1.0]` will again lead to inconsistency in
the computation of `frame_aspect_ratio`.

Sorry it took some days until I was able to have a closer look.

Everything except the inconsistency you mention works fine now. Also some other test produced the expected outcome.

Additionally I was playing Patchbot on my system and tested against 5.12beta3:

-patch applies without errors

-source builds without errors

-patch doesn't provoke any errors for a full doctest

-reference builds without problems and the changes lead to reasonable output

So there seems no reason not to give a positive review...
