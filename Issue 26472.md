Quoting the [release announcement for notebook 5.7.1](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jupyter/hWzu2BSsplY/xoBXV6uhAAAJ):

> The only change in this release is a security fix. An oversight in earlier versions
> meant that using the 'print preview' feature on a malicious notebook could
> allow it to run untrusted Javascript in the notebook server context. This
> potentially means it could start a kernel and run code on your computer.
>
> It's recommended to upgrade as soon as practical.

Our previous upgrade was to notebook 5.7.0 in #26174, so this should be easy.
