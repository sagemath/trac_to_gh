This looks like an integer overflow.  The method `HeilbronnMerel._initialize_list()` sets `bc = a*d - n`, where `a` and `d` are `<= n`, and `bc` is an `int`.

```
sage: n = 46342
sage: n^2 - n < 2^31
False
sage: (n-1)^2 - (n-1) < 2^31
True
```

I guess making `bc` a `long long` will solve this.

Indeed it does.  (Note about the patch: `llong` is defined as `long long` earlier in the file.)  I have tested this, but have not added any doctests, since any example would take much longer than the longest currently existing doctests.
