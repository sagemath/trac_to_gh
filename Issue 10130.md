# Issue 10130: Add option to specifiy path for twistd's process ID (.pid) file

Issue created by migration from Trac.

I have created a small patch which allows one to specify the location of twistd's PID file - this is useful when running the notebook as a service (which place their pid files e.g. at /var/run/).

The patch does not change the default behavior (placing it to ${HOME}/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/twistd.pid) and documents the new option.

For Sage 5.x as well I guess.

Go ahead, kiwifb! ;-)

We never actually used that in sage-on-gentoo but I'll see if I can get it into shape soonish. I have a number of things on my plate and that's not near the top.

Proposing to close all sagenb tickets as outdated, so that all remaining open tickets in the notebook component are about the Jupyter notebook.
