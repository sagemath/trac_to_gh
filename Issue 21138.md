as a step towards python3

replace xrange by Python3-style range, after "from builtins import range"

here only in the combinat folder

* mechanical replacement of xrange by range
* insertion of the imports in the changed files
* fine tuning by hand so that tests pass

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21375

It is about 10x slower to use the new range:

```sage
sage: %timeit for x in range(500000): pass
100 loops, best of 3: 12.5 ms per loop
sage: %timeit for x in xrange(500000): pass
100 loops, best of 3: 6.32 ms per loop
sage: from builtins import range
sage: %timeit for x in range(500000): pass
10 loops, best of 3: 111 ms per loop
```

So I am -1 for changing the `xrange -> range` now. All of these we should be able to do by running `sed` on the code base when we switch to python3.

Our aim being to have code running both in py2 and py3, this is a much better solution.
