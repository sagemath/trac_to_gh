Some code in `LinearCode.py` is quite old and/or slow, and could be optimized.
This tickets proposes a faster implementation for `__eq__` and `dual_code` methods.
It also removes a lot of commented debug lines.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19492

Let `C` be a linear code with `H` a parity check matrix of `C`. The generator matrix of `C`'s dual is `H`. I made changes in `AbstractLinearCode`'s `dual_code` method to use that property instead of the old implementation and got something faster.

I also rewrote `AbstractLinearCode`'s `__eq__` which is now less heavy and a bit faster.

Finally, I removed a lot of old debug prints that were still present in this file as commented lines.

This is now ready for review.

The following would be cleaner on two lines.

```

```

Otherwise it looks good.

Thanks for your input.

I changed the code to what you suggested. I also fixed a silly copy-paste mistake two lines below the one you mentioned.

While you are at it, the print statements like

```
print " t = ",t," , v = ",n," , k = ",w," , lambda = ",wts[w]*binomial(w,t)/binomial(n,t)
```

are really ugly. Could you do something cleaner like

```
print "t={} v={} k={} lambda={}".format(t, n, w, wts[w]*binomial(w,t)/binomial(n,t))

Even better would be

```

since that's compatible with Python 2 and 3.
