Erik: it would be good to test this on Cygwin.

LGTM, but I agree with Jeroen that we should test this on Cygwin as that can be a bit more fickle about libraries and linking. I will try to get to this this week, but I may not be able to.

The patchbot should get to it soon I imagine.  In fact I'm surprised it hasn't already, since it's been running a bit more efficiently lately.

I think I will change its configuration so that tickets with "cygwin" in their keywords can be given higher priority.  In the meantime, if you change the ticket's priority (say to critical) it will also be weighted higher.

If I understand correctly, I think that the strategically placed `# distutils: libraries =` declarations should be all that's necessary here and lgtm in principle.  Will still want to test though.  If for some reason the patchbot takes too much longer I'll test it by hand soon.

I'm going to set this to positive review. It should work and if it doesn't, it will be easy to fix.
