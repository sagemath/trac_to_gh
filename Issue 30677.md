Problem: While working on #30371, I noticed that most files in `local/share` are more or less static, but are generated during `make`.
I was wondering how to streamline this process a bit in order to make modularization easier, and to make it possible to install sagelib in different venv and without a previous run of `bootstrap`/`make`.

Options that I see:
1. Checkin the current version of these files (at least the almost static databases etc) in say `src/share`. Then they only need to be generated anew for update due to changes upstream. So one can remove the corresponding sage packages from the `make` pipeline.

2. Publish these dependencies to pypi, and install them to the current venv using requirements.txt and/or pipfile.

3. Generate these files during a call of `src/setup.py`, and include them in this way in the current venv.

Any other ideas/preferences about how to handle these files?

If you are talking about database packages such as `build/pkgs/conway_polynomials`, in particular those that do not seem to have a "real upstream" (or installation procedures other than our scripts in build/pkgs), then yes, I agree that a possible direction would be to create pip-installable packages for them and to publish them to PyPI. They should be maintained outside of the source tree, each in a separate git repository.

Yes, a confirmation of which bits would be nice. If `@`mkoeppe is right you are talking about
* combinatorial_designs
* conway_polynomials
* elliptic_curves
* graphs
* polytopes_db
* plus some other optional packages
They are indeed static but come in two flavors. 

Architecture independent:
* combinatorial_designs
* graphs
* polytopes_db
which are really file copying.

Prepared files
* conway_polynomials
* elliptic_curves
where the files are processed before install with some python code that may be depending on python or some other software. 

`conway_polynomials` uses `pickle.dump` which could pose problems across python versions?

`elliptic_curves` is put into a SQL database with sqlite, this should be a stable format. Don't know if that's portable between, say, x86_64 and ppc64le?

For these ones, we should make the actual source distribution architecture-independent.
The architecture-dependent products could be built during setup.py - and published as wheels.
