The fact that for a in QQ, the value of `a^(1/2)` has its parent depending on the actual value of a is a compromise for novice use (in calculus etc.) Normally, one would raise an error if `a^(1/2)` does not lie in QQ. Certainly, promoting to SR is a very bad choice for anything else than novice use.

I see you take the effort of trying to put the result back in the original parent. Don't you think it's better to force that? i.e., raise an error if it doesn't work, rather than give a result back in SR?

The problem is that if someone is computing with polynomials, it's almost certainly not desired to end up in SR (where things like `QQ['x']['x']` get squashed), and if an error isn't raised, it's very hard to detect that it happened.

Also, if you're implementing the (partial) map `a:->a^(n/m)` , why not extend it properly? When
`(QQ['x'](4))^(1/2)` works, why should `QQ['x'](x<sup>2)</sup>(1/2)` fail?

I've fixed the segmentation fault from `rings/integer.pyx` and implemented the case of `constant^constant`.

Also, +1 for extending this functionality on a follow-up ticket; I'd also like to have this in as soon as possible.

I've reviewed your changes, please cross-review. If you are satisfied and if there are no other objections, I'd set this to `positive_review`.

That's weird, but as integer tries to convert the base to the base of the exponent and expects the polynomial ring to handle it, we have to cope with it.

I refactored the code: that way it seems to be more suitable for future extension and handles polynomial exponents gracefully.

In a first commit, I removed handling of the segmentation fault because I thought it should be handeled by the base ring; later on, I understood that it has to be handeled here, so re-instated fix (in some other way).

I need a quick fix for `R(1)^(1/2)`. If somebody has time to implement `((x+1)<sup>2)</sup>(1/2)` very soon, I'd be happy. I do not have time soon. However, I want to have the code associated with a recently submitted paper in 7.1.

Basically, this fix here simply branches to existing code. Computing `((x+1)<sup>2)</sup>(1/2)` needs new mathematical code (involving square free decomposition).

Therefore, I propose to include this now on the basis that while this is not a perfect and definitive solution, it is better than the previous behaviour.

Let me be more precise then

```
def __pow__(self, exp):
    cdef long n
    try:
        n = exp
        # old code for integer exponent
    except TypeError:
        n = QQ.coerce(exp)
        # new code for rational exponent
```

What I do not understand is why are you testing if the exponent is a polynomial...

The following is currently a `TypeError`

```
sage: 1^(ZZ['x'].one())
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_integer_dense_flint.Polynomial_integer_dense_flint' object cannot be interpreted as an index
```

The same should happen when the integer `1` is replaced by the polynomial `1`.

```
sage: Zmod(10)(3) == 3
sage: Zmod(10)(5) == 5
sage: log(Zmod(10)(3))
3
sage: log(Zmod(10)(5))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ZeroDivisionError: Inverse does not exist.
```

Indeed. Your modifications obfuscate the code for only a very trivial case and a discutable behavior of powering with polynomials.

> Therefore, I propose to include this now on the basis that while this is not a perfect and definitive solution, it is better than the previous behaviour.

Not sure it is better. Sage used to consider operations based on parents. Powers are of course a special type of operation and with some respect might be treated appart. But "(polynomial)^(polynomial)" is not well defined. And "(polynomial)^(rational)" is well defined in some situations (and to that respect, your code improves the current situation a little).

Moreover, the current "power promotion" for ZZ is very bad

```
sage: 3^(1/2)
sqrt(3)
sage: parent(_)
Symbolic Ring
sage: 4^(1/2)
2
sage: parent(_)
Rational Field
```

Making it available for constant polynomial is not that much of an improvement.

Hi Vincent!

Just to clarify the previous need for checking whether the exponent is a polynomial: in our previous approach, we were hoping for the coefficient ring to carry out the exponentiation, i.e. if we had

```
sage: P.<z> = QQ[]
sage: P(1/4)^(1/2)
1/2
```

then we would compute this by letting `QQ` do the exponentiation. However, in the doctest over at `rings/integer.pyx` we have something like

```
sage: P.<t> = QQ[]
sage: 2^t
```

With the old implementation, this lead to an infinite loop (because coercion would put the base always back to P again...), and thus I added the check for the polynomial in the exponent.

In any case, I'm all for improving the code and first trying to deal with integers, and then with rationals afterwards. Nevertheless, I'd still just handle constant polynomials in the base on this ticket---but then, this could be extended easily.

Benjamin

Do you think that disallowing `R(1)^(1/2)` is the desired behaviour?

It might seem trivial to you, but it did cost me an hour while writing a paper because basically, asymptotic rings using polynomial rings as coefficient rings could not compute square roots, and, sorry, I need that.

1000000 loops, best of 3: 388 ns per loop
sage: %timeit 27 ** (1/3)
100000 loops, best of 3: 7.51 µs per loop
```

As `nth_root` should be guaranteed to return an element of the same ring there will also be much less coercion involved.

Nope. This is actually working because of a bug see #20214  ;-(. What I wrote in the generic `nth_root` should always be an infinite loop (because of `u.nth_root(n)`).

One possibility:

- make it work when `u.is_one()` is `True` (or more generally when `u.multiplicative_order()` is finite)
- raise an error if `u` is not in the above case and there are some non trivial factors

The aim of the second item is that in children classes (like polynomials) you might want to do

```
def nth_root(self, n):
    if self.degree() <= 0:
        # factorize unit using base ring method
        XXX
    else:
        return super(XXX).nth_root(self, n)
```

Well, wouldn't it be more natural to let the unit be an element of the base ring? (As far as I see the parent of the unit of polynomials over QQ always is from QQ, for example.)

Of course, we can also add checks like if `u` is one etc., but with this ticket only polynomial rings over the rationals and the integers use this method---and both of them have implemented a `nth_root` method; this is why I still think that this would be good to go and why special treatment isn't needed. And the inconsistency mentioned in #20214 only introduces a recursion of depth 2, which would be resolved if the `unit` method would behave for integers like for rationals.

It isn't even necessary to separately implement `nth_root` for polynomials such that the case of constant polynomials is handled by the base ring: over `ZZ`, the overall coefficient is decomposed w.r.t. PFD and handled like a non-constant polynomial (which is what I would have implemented in the base ring as well). For QQ, the overall factor is in the unit and handled separately in the `nth_root` method.

Letting other polynomial rings profit from this procedure should be realized in a follow-up ticket, IMHO.

However, what should be added before this ships is a special treatment of the zero polynomial. I'll push this in a minute.

I would very much like to have this in `7.2`, because I/we need it for a paper we have written. Thus I'd like to discuss this once again:

IIRC the possibly infinite recursion could be avoided altogether if we would convert the unit `f.unit()` to the corresponding base ring. This wouldn't require any additional fix for the units, and the code affects only `ZZ[]` and `QQ[]` anyway, so I'm rather sure that it works.

Yes, the gaussian integers were also my first idea for such an example, but getting this to work should rather be a follow-up ticket.

Taking an n-th root of an element in a ring R by computing a factorization is an insane way to go about it. A much better generic strategy is to hope that the univariate polynomial ring over R has a root finding algorithm and see if the polynomial `x^n-a` has a root. You will see that:
- it actually has a decent performance over QQ (although there the algorithm should really be special-cased)
- it will work over most fields, including the ones that are not constructed as fraction fields of rings with a factorization algorithm.
- you don't have to mess around with the unit part that a factorization algorithm probably won't recognize.

Illustration:

```
sage: a=next_prime(10^10)*next_prime(10^11)
sage: b=a^2
sage: %timeit (R.0^2-b).roots()
1000 loops, best of 3: 428 µs per loop
sage: %timeit b.factor()
100 loops, best of 3: 3.68 ms per loop
```


```
sage: k.<r>=NumberField(x^2+5)
sage: b=k(7^2)
sage: (k['x'].0^2-b).roots()
[(7, 1), (-7, 1)]
sage: factor(b) #doesn't work of course
```

While I like the general idea of this approach, I'm for discussing it on a follow-up ticket; see it as a "performance enhancement" of this implementation. Also, I'm not sure how exactly the root-finding algorithm for these univariate polynomial rings can be properly motivated, for me neither `roots()` nor `any_root()` did the job:


```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: P.<X> = R[]
sage: a = X^2 - (x^2 + 2*x + 1)
sage: a.any_root(R)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Unable to coerce Principal ideal (1) of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field (<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.ideal.Ideal_1poly_field'>) to Rational
```


Do you strongly object against setting this back to `positive_review`?

I was hoping for a comment from Vincent, as he started with the generic solution on this branch.

In any case: I do not quite understand why this would be in the wrong place. Unique factorization domains should provide a `factor`-method, and providing a generic `nth_root` method for them doesn't strike me as bad.

It might be true that this ticket only changes the behavior of polynomial rings, but I don't see a downside of providing a generic solution. But maybe I'm missing something? :-)

Yes, that is true---however, I think that the code provided on this ticket is generic enough to work for all unique factorization domains. Or doesn't it? Even if it might be not performant, I think that a generic approach is certainly allowed to be slow---this problem can be handled by special case implementations.

Perhaps don't bother getting a grammatically correct ordinal. Note that the current code doesn't get it correct anyway: It's 21st, 22nd, 23rd.

Better to formulate the error message in a way that doesn't depend on correct ordinal spelling, e.g.
`ValueError("(%s)^(1/%s) does not lie in ring"%(f,n))`

Concerning further optimization: testing degree is of course a worthwhile cheap trick. A follow-up ticket should probably use square-free factorization; something along the lines:

- if the characteristic p divides n then first check that the polynomial only has p-th powers of the variables in it. Take p-th root (i.e., replace variables and take p-th root of coefficients) and take (n/p)-th root of resulting polynomial

- In characteristic 0 then take g=f/GCD(f,f.derivative()), check that `g^n` divides `f`, take n-th root of `f/(g^n)`, multiply by g and return that.  

In positive characteristic we may first need to take all p-th powers out.

I do like the version with explicit ordinals in the errors more, so I fixed them. :-)

Of course, there is always potential to improve the performance. However, like you said, this should happen in a follow-up ticket.

Having the following code executed each time the function run is useless

```
        if 10 <= n % 100 < 20:
            postfix = 'th'
        else:
            postfix = {1:'st', 2:'nd', 3:'rd'}.get(n % 10, 'th')
```

Moreover, having these four lines potentially anywhere in Sage because you like is not the way to go. If you really think it is better this way, then implement a function `ordinal_str` that would *really* be doctested.

In the error message proposed by Nils there was the explicit mention of the parent which is a good thing.

Indeed, and this can be fixed straightforward. However, there is (once again ...) a slight inconvenience: there are superfluous parentheses in, e.g.


```
sage: P.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: P(4).nth_root(3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: (4)^(1/3) does not lie in ...
```


or


```
sage: x.nth_root(3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: (x)^(1/3) does not lie in ...
```


Should we live with that? Fixing it would require querying something like `self.is_constant()` and `self in self.parent().gens()` or so.

EDIT: `self.is_constant()` would not work:


```
sage: P.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: Q.<y> = P[]
sage: Q(x+1).is_constant()
True
```
