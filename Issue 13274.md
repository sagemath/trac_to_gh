# Issue 13274: Revert fix (but not doctests) from #11919

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13446

Original creator: mjo

Original creation time: 2012-09-11 13:29:30

Assignee: burcin

In #11919, I added a workaround for picking of symbolic functions. An upgrade to Pynac in #12950 made the workaround unnecessary, so we should just remove it.

Do you really need to change the text before the doctest? IMHO, we don't need to discuss the history of the bug in the reference manual.

Is it a big deal? We at least need the code explaining why the doctest is there, but the explanation that's there now isn't really correct anymore. It's only a few lines and it serves to give anyone who would modify that function a little background on it.

Plus, that function doesn't wind up in the reference manual anyway, so it doesn't hurt anyone who isn't digging into the code.

I'm somewhat surprised to find myself on the side of less historical explanation, but I agree that this is a little confusing when reading the code directly.   If anything, I'd _remove_ text so that one just tests whether pickling works - which, to be honest, we do quite a bit of in Sage, so it shouldn't need any explanation.  But this is probably all a bit of bikeshedding...

Ok, the second patch leaves the comment alone. The reviewer can thus choose his favorite version =)
