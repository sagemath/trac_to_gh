Then get rid of our homegrown iteration tools:
- from `sage.misc.misc`: `uniq`, `_stable_uniq`, `subsets`/`powerset`

I'll change my mind about this if it lets us delete a good bit of custom code, but looking at the given examples:

* `uniq()` is trivial and could be deleted anyway. Either `list(set(x))` or `sorted(set(x))` are idiomatic python.
* The benefit of `_stable_uniq` seems to be that it returns an iterator, but the only two uses of it in the tree immediately convert the result to a list. Can they be replaced by `list(set(x))`?
* Powerset is a nice one to have, but by itself totals nine lines of code.

I agree, there needs to be a demonstrated substantial use before we add another dependency

One example is slicing a list into sublists
of size "ncpu" to feed a parallel function.

For that, we can each time define a custom
"list of lists" function, for instance

```
lol = lambda lst, sz: [lst[i:i+sz] for i in range(0, len(lst), sz)]
```

as found 17 times in `sage/manifolds`
and `sage/tensor` (try `git grep 'lol ='`).

We could instead use `chunked`, `ichunked`,
`sliced` or `isliced` from more-itertools.

> lol = lambda lst, sz: [lst[i:i+sz] for i in range(0, len(lst), sz)]

Changing that line on its own won't eliminate much code, though. The pattern


```
lol = lambda lst, sz: [lst[i:i+sz] for i in range(0, len(lst), sz)]
ind_list = [ind for ind in other._comp] # only this line changes
ind_step = max(1, int(len(ind_list)/nproc/2))
local_list = lol(ind_list, ind_step)
```


is repeated over and over again. If the whole thing were factored out into a helper function, then we'd be left with changing


```
lol = lambda lst, sz: [lst[i:i+sz] for i in range(0, len(lst), sz)]
```


into


```
lol = lambda lst, sz: chunked(lst,sz)
```


which only saves us a few characters.
