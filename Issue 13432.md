The subject says it all:

```
sage: sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all()
/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.4.rc1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/iplib.py:2260: DeprecationWarning: This class is replaced by Matrix_modn_dense_float/Matrix_modn_dense_double.

  exec code_obj in self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns
Successfully unpickled 594 objects.

```

is OK but

```
sage: %timeit sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all()

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGABRT: An abort() occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.

```

is not. However, the following is OK:

```
sage: sage: dir = tmp_dir()
sage: sage: sage.structure.sage_object.picklejar('hello', dir)
sage: sage: sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all(dir)
Successfully unpickled 1 objects.
Failed to unpickle 0 objects.
sage: %timeit sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all(dir)
625 loops, best of 3: 91.5 Âµs per loop
```


I get this error for versions 5.3 and 5.4.rc1 running on a macbook pro with lion.

I initially thought that perhaps timeit did not like calling itself, however, this seems to be OK because the following works OK.

```
sage: def fred():^J    timeit('2^10000', preparse=False, number=100)
....:     
sage: fred()
100 loops, best of 3: 31 ns per loop
sage: %timeit fred
625 loops, best of 3: 38.5 ns per loop
```

I tried running through sage -gdb but I don't know how to interpret the outout. Here is the tail of what it produces:

```

Usually asking for the stack backtrace is one of the most interesting things:

```

So, the error happens in NTL. I suppose that this is an error that normally gets caught appropriately but due to `%timeit` doesn't? The alternative is that the whole `%timeit` thing happens to cause a state in NTL we aren't normally encountering.

See #10705 for another seg fault associated with unpickle_all.

Well ... `%timeit` will run its code a couple of times to get accurate timing information, so if (as the ticket mentions) running `unpickle_all()` twice causes a crash then `%timeit unpickle_all()` should too.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

OK, let's close this as a duplicate then. I'll set it as needs review. Could you please "review" it Nils?
