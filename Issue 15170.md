# Issue 15170: bug in symmetrica

Keywords: symmetrica, symmetric functions

The following bug was causing errors in the product of Schur functions.  The bug in the product was resolved in #15397 by changing the product to use lrcalc rather than symmetrica.  The bug in symmetrica still exists.


```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: symmetrica.mult_schur_schur(s[122,1],s[2,1])
2*s[1]
sage: symmetrica.mult_schur_schur(s[123],s[2,1])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

As reported in #15397 these errors are reproducible on the [website](http://www.mathe2.uni-bayreuth.de/cgi-bin/axel/gensym.exe?outerproduct_schur?2?1?PARTITION?PARTITION) for symmetrica.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

This is an upstream bug that no longer affects Sage (since lrcalc is now used):

https://gitlab.com/sagemath/symmetrica/issues/11

As a result, I think we can close this here. If someone knows how to fix the bug in symmetrica, please send a pull request.
