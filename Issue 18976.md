CC:  vdelecroix jdemeyer vbraun embray

In #19187, the file `build/pkgs/piprules` was created. This allows any packages listed there to be installed via `sage -i PKG` by just running `pip install PKG`. The changes here allow such packages to be listed when running `sage --optional`, and therefore to be detected as optional packages when doctesting.

For example: after running `sage -i brian`, `sage --optional` gives me

```
...
bliss................................... 0.72.p1 (not_installed)
brian................................... 1.4.1 (1.4.1)
buckygen................................ 1.0 (not_installed)
...
```

and doctesting gives me

```
Using --optional=arb,brian,ccache,gcc,mpir,python2,sage,scons
```


This does not print package information for all packages listed in `build/pkg/piprules`, only for those which have been installed

To my mind, it would nice to also list non installed pip packages as well as the last version available. The pip version can be obtained from Python with the json API

```
import urllib2
import json

def pip_version(package_name):
    url = "https://pypi.python.org/pypi/{}/json".format(package_name)

    try:
        data = json.load(urllib2.urlopen(urllib2.Request(url)))
    except urllib2.HTTPError:
        return None

    try:
        return data["info"]["version"]
    except KeyError:
        return None
```

The last version available might differ from what is installed. And it is worth mentioning that an update is available.

I do not want these pip packages to be treated like optional packages. If anything, they are closer to "experimental" than to "optional". We don't have control over them, so they are more likely to break when the upstream package gets upgraded.

Do you mean

- you want them listed in `sage --experimental`, not `sage --optional`, or
- you don't want them detected for the purpose of doctests,

or both?

The default for `--optional` flags in doctests really should be optional packages only, so I don't want pip packages to be tested by doctests by default. Therefore, I also don't want those packages to appear in `sage --optional`. So I really prefer to see them as a new category: not standard, not optional, not experimental.

I see several solutions to deal with "pip packages":
1. having a new category of packages (let say python-optional)
2. be stricter about versioning, i.e. in piprules specify the version of the packages we support

```
brian=1.3.1
trac=2.3
```

  Very simple to maintain!

I agree that it would be hard to prevent a pip package to just break because versions are not backward compatible. So solution 2 looks appropriate to me. Otherwise, we can have a more precise tagging system for python-optional packages

```
sage: my_test()  # python-optional -- 3.5 <= beautifulsoup <= 4.1.2
```

It is more flexible than the piprules strict versioning solution but the cost of maintenance is much higher.

I have a few questions and comments:

- if #19220 is merged (archiving superseded packages, including the `piprules` packages), how are users supposed to find out about `biopython`, `brian`, etc.? We need to include an option to `sage` which will call `sage-list-packages python`. Maybe we should also have an option which lists all packages: first standard, then optional, then experimental, then python/pip. Or maybe group all of the non-standard packages together, sorted by name. In any case, we shouldn't expect users to even be aware that there are several different types of non-standard packages; they should instead just be able to get one list to see if some particular package is supported.

  Maybe a list like

```
[package (type)] .......... [latest version] ([installed version])

...
biopython (pip) ........... latest version (installed version)
...
chomp (experimental) ...... latest version (installed version)
...
ore_algebra (optional) .... latest version (installed version)
...
```

 I'm not really sure, though.
- Regarding the versions, I am not convinced that we can accurately specify which version of each package we support. Who is going to maintain this? Unless there is some automatic way of determining the versions supported by Sage, the versions will quickly get out of date. If `brian` gets updated to 1.4.2 but we list `brian=1.4.1`, what happens if a user does `sage -i brian`? What happens if a user does `sage --pip install brian`?
