# Issue 33946: add support for retrieving multiple solutions (solution pool) from MILP solvers

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34183

Some MILP solvers support computing multiple solutions (called _solution pool_) to a given MILP problem, but Sage lacks the ability to retrieve more than one solution from the solver (the existing `.solve()` method produces only one solution).

Here is some info on how multiple solutions can be produced in Gurobi and CPLEX solvers:

- Gurobi: https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.5/refman/finding_multiple_solutions.html

- CPLEX: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/icos/20.1.0?topic=optimization-solution-pool-generating-keeping-multiple-solutions

The most likely route for Sage to improve its MIP interface is to go through CVXPY (https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33920).

So a good step would be to investigate whether CVXPY provides this feature and if not, to work on getting it added.
