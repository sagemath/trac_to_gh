# Issue 16461: remove deprecated prec arguments

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2014-07-22 09:03:01

Keywords: prec, keyword, deprecation, deprecated

There are still three instances of the prec keyword argument:

```
src/sage/functions/other.py:            deprecation(7490, "The prec keyword argument is deprecated. Explicitly set the precision of the input, for example gamma(RealField(300)(1)), or use the prec argument to .n() for exact inputs, e.g., gamma(1).n(300), instead.")
src/sage/functions/other.py:            deprecation(7490, "Calling symbolic functions with arguments that cannot be coerced into symbolic expressions is deprecated.")
src/sage/functions/log.py:            deprecation(7490, "The prec keyword argument is deprecated. Explicitly set the precision of the input, for example exp(RealField(300)(1)), or use the prec argument to .n() for exact inputs, e.g., exp(1).n(300), instead.")
```

Did you check that the documentation builds properly? This looks bad (double colon but block removed):

```diff

TESTS::

- sage: exp(2,prec=100)
- doctest:...: DeprecationWarning: The prec keyword argument is deprecated. Explicitly set the precision of the input, for example exp(RealField(300)(1)), or use the prec argument to .n() for exact inputs, e.g., exp(1).n(300), instead.
- See http://trac.sagemath.org/7490 for details.

Please justify why you undo the deprecation of

```
sage: Q.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: gamma(i)
```

I removed `TESTS::`. BTW the documentation of this function is not shown in the html reference documentation.

Replying to [comment:6 jdemeyer]:
> Please justify why you undo the deprecation of
> {{{
> sage: Q.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
> sage: gamma(i)
> }}}

I misinterpreted the deprecation warning. Now an exception is raised.
