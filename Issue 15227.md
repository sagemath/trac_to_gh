# Issue 15227: PIL still wants to use libjpeg when it cannot

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15464

Original creator: jpflori

Original creation time: 2013-11-28 13:54:01

As in #7273, trying to install PIL on an ARM board failed because PIL found the jpeg library but there were no headers installed yielding an error:

```
libImaging/Jpeg.h:11:21: error: jpeglib.h: No such file or directory
```
