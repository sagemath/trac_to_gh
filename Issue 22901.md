As described in https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/jN6inWPyElM, `assume()` takes more and more time the bigger the `assumptions()` data base is. This causes a lot of slow-downs when e.g. declaring variables with a `domain` argument. Nils Bruin suggested that this is due to excessive interactions with the Maxima library and Ralf Stefan suggested that the assumptions could be cached and only sent to Maxima when needed, to speed up the process.

The "more persistent domains() database" exists already in part as GiNaC/Pynac info flags that are set in parallel to Maxima's assumptions.

Following on from https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/-A8ZzSKvYsA, `assume()` sends assumptions both to maxima and Pynac. In addition, `assume()` tests if the assumptions are consistent, which is probably not needed when we define a new variable. So, instead of calling `assume()` in `var()` maybe we should just replace it by the same as is done in `assume()` (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx#L1785), i.e. `maxima.assume()`. 

Therefore, instead of removing send_sage_domain_to_maxima as in the patch, I would propose to substitute `maxima.assume()` for all `assume()` calls in `send_sage_domain_to_maxima()` (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/symbolic/ring.pyx#1017). Did I miss something?
