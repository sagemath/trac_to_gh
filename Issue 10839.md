Excellent work.  I'll need some time to go through the Tate and Ate pairing code; if no-one gets to it first this is something to do at SD29 in 10 days' time.

Until then, just two comments:  

1. You use the hasse_bounds function in the opint order-setting function, but why not also in the groupcorder setting function?

2. Amusing fact:  for fields of size at least 32 there cannot be two integers in the Hasse interval with one dividing the other (since the ratio of the upper and lower bounds is < 2)!

Response to the two comments:

1. Yes, by all means I should have used the hasse_bounds function in the group order setter, I discovered it in the course of writing the point order setter, and then forgot to go back and change it.

2. A fine fact indeed! One could use it to make the group order setter more robust.  It may well be worth having the both order setters defer to the builtin order calculation in small cases, perhaps with an override message?

Whereas without the timing everthing is fine:

```

p = 103; A = 1; B = 18; E = EllipticCurve(GF(p), [A, B])
P = E(33, 91); n = P.order()
k = GF(n)(p).multiplicative_order()
P.tate_pairing(P, n, k)
1

Ok, I can be more specific in what the error is.  In tate_pairing (P.tate_pairing(Q,n,k)), if P._miller_(Q, n) raises a 
ZeroDivisionError: Inverse does not exist., then it creates a random point R and then calles P.tate_pairing(Q+R,n,k).  
If Q+R is zero, then P._miller_(Q+R,n,k) raises an error.  This is not checked for and it seems that given certain 
random seeds this does occur.
