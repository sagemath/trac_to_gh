Keywords: lattice precision

* Drop labels keyword in parents & make parents more unique
* Switch to templates for elements
* Switch to cython for precision lattice
* Specialized data structure for matrix
* Make pickling and conversion more robust (pickling should dump the full lattice matrix and unpickling restores the matrix but puts it next to the existing matrix)
* Share precision lattice between all parents with the same p.

About pickling/unpickling, I propose the following interface:

- (usual syntax) if `x` is a p-adic, `dumps(x)` saves `x` as `approx + O(p^prec)` but diffused digits implying `x` are not saved
- if `R` is a parent (and/or a precision lattice maybe), `R.dumps_elements(x,y,z,...)` saves the approximation of all listed elements together with a lattice representing the precision on this set of elements
- `loads(obj)` loads the stored variables in `obj` (they can be many of them if `obj` was constructed by `dumps_elements`) as new independant variables.

How does it sound?

I am not sure how `dumps_elements` would integrate with the usual pickling workflow, say when pickling something like a matrix.

I think a simpler interface is not harder implement and makes things less surprising:
* Whenever we pickle an element we pickle its entire precision lattice. So, if we happen to pickle many elements at the same time, say a polynomial, we pickle their lattice (once.)
* Restoring elements just appends the pickled lattice to the existing lattice and does a "drop unused columns".

While this is not a very space-efficient format (but I guess we don't care) it gives us both behaviours you describe above automatically, doesn't it?
