There is the following example in the documentation in `schemes\generic\projective_space.py`:

```
sage: A.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(2, QQ)
sage: X = A.subscheme([x*z^2, y^2*z, x*y^2]); X
Closed subscheme of Projective Space of dimension 2 over Rational Field defined by:
  x*z^2,
  y^2*z,
  x*y^2
```

The file passes tests fine in sage-4.6.2.rc0, I can also do it from the command line. But if I try to do it in the notebook, I get

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "_sage_input_4.py", line 10, in <module>
    exec compile(u'open("___code___.py","w").write("# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\\n" + _support_.preparse_worksheet_cell(base64.b64decode("QS48eCx5LHo+ID0gUHJvamVjdGl2ZVNwYWNlKDIsIFFRKQpYID0gQS5zdWJzY2hlbWUoW3gqel4yLCB5XjIqeiwgeCp5XjJdKTsgWA=="),globals())+"\\n"); execfile(os.path.abspath("___code___.py"))
  File "", line 1, in <module>
    
  File "/tmp/tmpgPYl3N/___code___.py", line 4, in <module>
    exec compile(u'X = A.subscheme([x*z**_sage_const_2 , y**_sage_const_2 *z, x*y**_sage_const_2 ]); X
  File "", line 1, in <module>
    
  File "/home/novoselt/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/schemes/generic/projective_space.py", line 501, in subscheme
    return algebraic_scheme.AlgebraicScheme_subscheme_projective(self, X)
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'AlgebraicScheme_subscheme_projective'
```

which I don't understand.

Everything is good in the notebook in sage-4.6, so it should been broken recently, perhaps by #10525, although I can't imagine how.

I think the problem is a circular import `projective_space` <-> `algebraic_scheme`

Maybe, but I don't see what is wrong with those imports.

What bugs me most is that it works from the command line, but not in the notebook, so there is probably a bug in the notebook, but I have no idea how to trace it.

Removing the circular import fixes this for me. The bug was probably introduced in #10525, so it would be nice if we could push the patch into Sage-4.6.2. Its really uncontroversial.

The patch looks fine, but what about other spaces, I suppose they have the same problem?

The main issue is that this error could not be detected automatically and you cannot demonstrate in a doctest that this patch has solved the problem. Who knows how many of the other doctests in Sage would fail in the notebook?.. Checking for circular imports by hands is very tedious and perhaps even impossible, so these issues must be caught during tests.

Can we first fix this bug before we embark on a discussion on how to extend the doctesting framework?

I think pylint and similar tools can already check for circular imports. Although bad style, I think the circular import here was actually ok. So there might be a bug in the worksheet. Since that is being rewritten right now, I don't think its useful to spend  much time tracking down the underlying issue.
