The naive algorithm:

sage: for j in range(10):
....:      S = [x for x in range(256)];shuffle(S)
....:      S = sage.crypto.sbox.SBox(S)

Friedrich,

The line `row = [0 for _ in range(ncols)]` can be simplified to `[0]*ncols`. The rest looks good to me (doctests passed and I have confirmed the performance speedup).
