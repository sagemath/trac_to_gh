See for example in:

```
def B(n, x): return -n*hurwitz_zeta(1 - n, x) if n != 0 else 1
for n in (0..4):
    print(expand(B(n, x)), " , ", bernoulli_polynomial(x, n))

    1  ,  1
    -hurwitz_zeta(0, x)  ,  x - 1/2
    x^2 - x + 1/6  ,  x^2 - x + 1/6
    x^3 - 3/2*x^2 + 1/2*x  ,  x^3 - 3/2*x^2 + 1/2*x
    x^4 - 2*x^3 + x^2 - 1/30  ,  x^4 - 2*x^3 + x^2 - 1/30
    }}}
This also shows the expected value.
