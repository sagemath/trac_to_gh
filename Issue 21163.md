This test fails on Windows (even Cygwin) because GAP's `Exec()` function passes its input through `cmd.exe` on Windows (again, even on Cygwin), so there is no `/dev/null`.  

I might consider this an upstream bug, since when running on Cygwin it should just use `$SHELL`.  In any case this improves the test slightly by also testing its output--I don't think there was a good reason to send to `/dev/null` anyways.

(one could argue relying on the existence of a command called `echo` isn't portable either, but I don't think there's a system Sage works on where that wouldn't work :)
