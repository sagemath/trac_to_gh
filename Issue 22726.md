I don't see anything here alerting DEVELOPERS to this change, though I admit there are lots of files touched.  It should be very clear how to format things in the developer guide.

Also, this should be announced (if not discussed) on sage-devel, if it hasn't been already.  (I'm not suggesting this is a bad change, but just making sure people are aware - I stumbled upon this quite randomly.)

(Also, unfortunately one might have to still root out some anyway, since currently-active tickets may not have this ...)

It is hard for me to see who would be against this change. And there already is for example #21592 and #21652, and also see #21647. Should all those been discussed too?

One can argue all of those examples were "wrong", for some definition of wrong, while this one is presumably at least _grammatically_ wrong.

But my actual rationale in posting is to suggest you make sure people know, so that you don't have to open 25 more tickets fixing this from people who didn't notice this otherwise-obscure ticket.

Clarifying - unfortunately I replied and didn't click "edit".

Makes sense for me. There are still many places with `TEST:` though. I guess you didn't think of that.

Hence my mention of a patch bomb ... I guess that didn't happen yet.
