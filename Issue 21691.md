I added a `_latex_` function to the `ContinuedFraction_base` base class, that displays 10 terms by default. Notice that the subclass `ContinuedFraction_periodic` has already its own `_latex_`, printing all the terms.

(I hope my automatic white space correction didn't screw up the ascii-art to much..)

Would be better to have only one place with `_latex_`. With your version we still have

```
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: continued_fraction(sqrt2)
[1; (2)*]
sage: latex(continued_fraction(sqrt2))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: latex not implemented for non rational continued fractions
```

Thanks for proposing a fix to this issue. I just downloaded the branch. It works great.

Here are two relatively small comments that I would suggest to change before positive review:

1. I think the `nterms=10` would be better put as an argument with a default value of 10 for the `_latex_` method like it is done for the method `str` of the same object. The first thing that will happen is that somebody want to see 13 terms (with the ...). I know that `_latex_` method is used from `latex` function which might not forward arguments `*args, **kwds`. Something more complicated involving a new method could be done like [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/combinat/words/morphism.py#L813) but I do not think it is necessary. To my opinion, I would just move `nterms=10` to the argument which will allow somebody to see 13 terms (with the ...).

2. The two output  lines in doctests are very long. I suggest to wrap them to keep less than 80 characters on each line. The doctest framework won't notice the newlines. Alternatively, the code could include well placed `\n` so that `\frac{\displaystyle` are all well aligned vertically.

I addressed both points mentioned by slabbe; thanks for reviewing!

`sage -grep continued_fraction` lists 20 files and `sage -tp --long` on them gives all tests passed:

```
sage -tp --long src/sage/arith/misc.py src/sage/calculus/wester.py src/sage/combinat/words/word_generators.py src/sage/databases/oeis.py src/sage/geometry/cone.py src/sage/modular/modform_hecketriangle/hecke_triangle_group_element.py src/sage/modular/modform_hecketriangle/hecke_triangle_groups.py src/sage/modular/modform_hecketriangle/readme.py src/sage/modular/modsym/ambient.py src/sage/modular/modsym/modular_symbols.py src/sage/modular/pollack_stevens/manin_map.py src/sage/plot/misc.py src/sage/rings/all.py src/sage/rings/contfrac.py src/sage/rings/continued_fraction.py src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element_quadratic.pyx src/sage/rings/rational.pyx src/sage/rings/real_lazy.pyx src/sage/tests/book_stein_ent.py src/sage/tests/book_stein_modform.py
```

I am currently building the documentation to make sure...

in the future, remember to use python3 syntax for print
