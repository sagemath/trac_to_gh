The first one is now

```
sage: _.category()                                                                                                                
Join of Category of Cartesian products of vector spaces with basis over (finite enumerated fields and subquotients of monoids and quotients of semigroups) and Category of finite additive groups and Category of Cartesian products of finite enumerated sets
```

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
