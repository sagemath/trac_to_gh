# Issue 31859: Deprecate sage.misc.misc.union

We have a global binding of `union` that returns "the union of x and y, as a list". We deprecate it because this is an outdated interface and not suitable for the global namespace. It is only used in a few places in the Sage library. (There is no `intersection`.)

I'm getting doctest failures because of the deprecation warning:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 98.0 --random-seed=0 src/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 98.0 --random-seed=0 src/sage/arith/misc.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 98.0 --random-seed=0 src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/library.py  # 1 doctest failed
```
