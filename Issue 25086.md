Important questions: is the package truly missing or is the check for the package broken? And is the package required in the first place to do that computation?

Th√© package is ***NOT*** missing. And this happens even after a forced reinstallation `sage -f database_gap`.

I've never heard of such a package, see also https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html

a typo?

There is no such GAP package in GAP 4.8

There will be primgrp package (https://github.com/gap-packages/primgrp) in GAP 4.9.

OK, this needs the same treatment as Small Groups library in `sage/features/gap.py`.
I'll provide a fix.

Note that `TransitiveGroup` needs the same treatment (being part of database_gap)
