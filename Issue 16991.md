Keywords: cached_method, precompute, parallel

Currently, `CachedMethodCaller` inherits the method `precompute` from `CachedFunction`, but it does not work as expected:

```
sage: class Foo(object):
....:    @cached_method
....:    def f(self, i):
....:        return i^2
sage: foo = Foo()
sage: foo.f.precompute(range(2))
f() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)
f() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)
sage: foo.f.cache
{((0,), ()): 'NO DATA', ((1,), ()): 'NO DATA'}
```


It seems that it can be fixed by copying the `precompute` method and replacing `self.f` by `self._instance_call`.

Hello,

The `OUTPUT` section is **not** mandatory. Especially when the function/method returns `None`.

Beyond that it looks like it work well!
