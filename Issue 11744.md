# Issue 11744: add numerical integration to reference manual

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2011-10-12 12:20:53

Assignee: mvngu

Keywords: integral, reference

Somewhat surprisingly, this function (`numerical_integral`) is not in the reference manual!   Let's clean up its documentation and put it there.

Note: this ticket would be superseded by #8321 or #7763 addressing this, though it's not clear that either of them do at this time.

what do you mean by "not in the reference manual"? It is documented:

```
sage: numerical_integral?
String Form:    <built-in function numerical_integral>
Namespace:      Interactive
Definition:     numerical_integral(func, a, b=None, algorithm='qag', max_points=87, params=[], eps_abs=9.9999999999999995e-07, eps_rel=9.9999999999999995e-07, rule=6)
Docstring:
    
       Returns the numerical integral of the function on the interval from
       a to b and an error bound.
...
```

Replying to [comment:1 zimmerma]:

I mean it is not in the HTML/PDF document generated by Sphinx, because we haven't added it to that.   See [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/genindex-N.html](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/genindex-N.html) and search for this command.

isn't the HTML/PDF document automatically generated from the on-line documentation?

The documentation from the command line is NOT the same as the HTML/PDF documentation.  You may have noticed, after a Sage build completes, that it spends some time generating doc; but only modules which are up to snuff in terms of formatting and which someone bothered to add to it gets added.   That is a _lot_ of them!  But not all.  And they do need to be formatted pretty well for that to happen.  

Anyway, this is probably a fairly trivial patch to make, looking at examples of how other modules are included, so I'm putting 'beginner' on it.  An _ideal_ patch for this would also put in some hyperlink cross-references in the calculus documentation, e.g. at [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/calculus/functional.html](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/calculus/functional.html).

Changing keywords from "integral, reference" to "integral, reference, beginner".

See #12047 where I do this (I had to edit that file anyway and decided to clean up the documentation while I was at it).
