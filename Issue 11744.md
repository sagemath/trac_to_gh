Keywords: integral, reference

Somewhat surprisingly, this function (`numerical_integral`) is not in the reference manual!   Let's clean up its documentation and put it there.

what do you mean by "not in the reference manual"? It is documented:

```
sage: numerical_integral?
String Form:    <built-in function numerical_integral>
Namespace:      Interactive
Definition:     numerical_integral(func, a, b=None, algorithm='qag', max_points=87, params=[], eps_abs=9.9999999999999995e-07, eps_rel=9.9999999999999995e-07, rule=6)
Docstring:
    
       Returns the numerical integral of the function on the interval from
       a to b and an error bound.
...
```

I mean it is not in the HTML/PDF document generated by Sphinx, because we haven't added it to that.   See [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/genindex-N.html](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/genindex-N.html) and search for this command.

isn't the HTML/PDF document automatically generated from the on-line documentation?
