If the issue only comes from 32bit archs, why not separate cases with `# 32-bit` and `# 64-bit` keywords ? Sorting doctest makes them much less readable, and nothing explains the reason to the user (OK for the `TESTS` sections, not for the `EXAMPLES` ones).

This problem also appeared in #31994. I would recommend the fix applied there, where the list is returned is sorted before returning. The order of the list is not important, as the preperiodic points are an unordered set.

The issue is coming from doctesting implementation/architecture-dependent behavior that is not guaranteed by the spec. It is best practice to avoid this, instead of updating doctests every time a different architecture or Python version is tested. 

`#32-bit` markers are best reserved to lower-level code that truly has to distinguish between architectures, such as when exact hash values have to be tested for some reason.

Well, that is a shortcoming of the documentation -- or the choice of output type -- of this method. It returns a list (which is an ordered container) but the documentation does not explain anything about the order of the items.

By the way, in contemporary Python one would probably make functions like this iterators instead of returning a list. Then it is up to the user of the method to choose how to process it.

Right, I had thought I had seen this failure before on another ticket. 

Sorting is another solution to make the output deterministic, of course. Feel free to replace my branch by a cherry-pick of https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit?id=abdade36276e7c5c51fc2a818f599c667f0f1627 -- I have no preference either way.

In any case, it would be a good to add to the description of the output a comment on the order.

Added such a description.

While this fix should work in theory, I don't personally have a 32 bit build of Sage. Could someone test the fix?

Now i am getting confused: on a 32bit VM (with #32080 applied), i still got the exact same failure as `@`vbraun:


```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)
sage: R.<z> = QQ[]
sage: K.<v> = NumberField(z^4 - z^2 - 1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem_projective([x^2 - y^2, y^2])
sage: g = f.preperiodic_points(2, 1, R=K) ; g
[(-v : 1), (v : 1)]
sage: g.sort()
sage: g
[(-v : 1), (v : 1)]
```


However:


```
sage: g[0] < g[1]
False
sage: g[0] > g[1]
True
sage: g
[(-v : 1), (v : 1)]
sage: sorted(g)
[(-v : 1), (v : 1)]
```

Comparison is wrong, both in 32bit and 64bit systems (it is just that Python seems not to handle the case similarly on 32bit and 64bit systems). This is not a doctesting issue.


```
sage: g[0] < g[1]                                                                                                                                                                                            
False
sage: g[1] < g[0]                                                                                                                                                                                            
False
sage: g[0] > g[1]                                                                                                                                                                                            
True
sage: g[1] > g[0]                                                                                                                                                                                            
True

sage: g[0] <= g[1]
False
sage: g[1] <= g[0]
False
sage: g[0] >= g[1]
True
sage: g[1] >= g[0]
True
```

For such objects, only equality is handled:


```
sage: a,b = g
sage: a._richcmp_??
```



---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-08-03 12:58:08

OK, then of course "sorting" cannot fix the problem.

I would suggest that we go back to my version (https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit?id=6e40da1c50ec6e082ae1326d105a67c76b1d2db6) and add `key=str` to the use of `sorted` in doctests.


---

Comment by bhutz created at 2021-08-03 13:04:04

That's a good point for going back to sorting only the doctest output. In general, equality is the only comparison that makes sense for projective points. Over a field, you could do a richcmp lexicographically based on normalized coordinates, but, in general, you'd need a standard set of coordinates to go the sorting with.


---

Comment by bhutz created at 2021-08-03 13:06:55

Probably should revisit the #31994 fix too.

Projective points do implement lexicographic ordering, but comparison of number field elements is undefined. There is a long-standing ticket #20028 that aims to change comparisons of number field elements into an error in order to avoid unexpected behavior like this.

Coud you please have a look at the branch https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/log/?h=u/tmonteil/random_failure_in_projective_ds_py ? It only deals with the problematic doctest, the example is still understandable to the user, and the developer can track the issue.


---

Comment by tmonteil created at 2021-08-03 20:45:44

I do not like the way the issue is currently dealt with (sort everything) since:

- we change doctests that are not problematic
- we might end up with every doctest being sorted
- doctests are not only tests, they are part of an example section that is important for users
- the origin of the issue is not understandable

Personally, I like this fix best (and I think Ben is in agreement with me here). It is clear we need to sort the problematic doc test by string, but the other examples can be left untouched with no errors, as built in sorting works for the rationals and finite fields.

I would also prefer to only add sorted to the ones that fail to sort consistently.

wrt to the tmonteil branch: yes, something like that. But, I'd rather have only one example with a little text saying something like the point order can be different on 32bit and 64bit architectures.

OK, here is another branch : https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/log/?h=u/tmonteil/failure_in_projective_ds_py-depends_on_architecture

Do not hesitate to provide a better explanation.

However, while i could reproduce the issue on my 32-bit VM, i could not ensure that this will happen on every 32-bit architecture (this is why i was more conservative in the previous branch).


---

Comment by bhutz created at 2021-08-04 00:54:27

Sorry, I was unclear. I'm also not sure this will happen on every 32-bit architecture so I don't know if the new branch will fix all issues or just end up with different ones. I meant to suggested a single example with that explanation which is sorted with the str key. I think the explanation text you provided is fine.

I think that's fine. Want to set that as the ticket branch so that patch bot can see if that resolves the failures without creating any new ones?
