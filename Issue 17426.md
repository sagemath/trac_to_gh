Interesting. Looks mostly good.

This is wrong, though:


```
for i from 0 <= i < self._nrows:
  for j from 0 <= j < self._ncols:
    if not x[k]:
      entries[(i,j)] = x[k]
    k += 1
```


It should be `if x[k]`: you want to copy the *non*-zero elements. I had some trouble testing this code path, though:


```
sage: R.<a,b>=QQ[]
sage: m1=matrix(2,2,[0,a,b,0],sparse=True); m1
[0 a]
[b 0]
sage: type(m1)(m1.parent(),[0,a,b,0],True,True)
[0 0]
[0 0]
```


I haven't yet figured out where the `m1` construction converts its argument, but perhaps we can deprecate or even immediately remove that code path dealing with a single flat list.

I also wonder whether we should have a custom cythonized type to be used as key, instead of the generic CPython tuple or arbitrary size and types. Might make things a lot faster and memory-efficient again.

As far as I can see, most other (non-generic) sparse matrix implementations use something other than a dict to represent its entries. Something like [Yale format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Yale) as far as I can tell at a quick glance. Perhaps a really proper cleanup should go all the way to using that?

The whole class has poor docstring and doctest coverage. I know that when adding new code, it should come with doctests these days.

Hello,

Right
 
> I haven't yet figured out where the `m1` construction converts its argument, but perhaps we can deprecate or even immediately remove that code path dealing with a single flat list.

Done

> I also wonder whether we should have a custom cythonized type to be used as key, instead of the generic CPython tuple or arbitrary size and types. Might make things a lot faster and memory-efficient again.

Nope. I think we sould get rid of Python there. Sparse graphs have a much better implementation (though not very much documented either). But you are right, having a customized Cython type for pair of Py_ssize_t would be indeed much faster. Let me have a try.

> As far as I can see, most other (non-generic) sparse matrix implementations <...>

Hash table is cool. But not in the way it is done currently. We should not use Python objects other than to wrap the ring elements.

An important question is whether you want to access quickly to the following data:

- nonzero entries in a fixed row
- nonzero entries in a fixed column

The best would be as you did: look at the literature and other softwares/libraries.

> The whole class has poor docstring and doctest coverage.

Right, I added some. But I will not go any further.

It is like 0

sage: bool(0)
False

True

We have zero <-> False and non-zero <-> True

Yes, it is. So that the matrix is zero if and only if the dict is empty.

That would be a very professional excuse, but I guess I was thinking more along the lines `bool(…)` vs. `x.__nonzero__()` (which should behave the same) instead of `bool(x)` vs. `x.is_zero()` as the doctest used them.

Some more comments from reading the latest commit.
* `if entries is None or not entries` could be shortened to `if not entries`.
* `_cmp_backward` might use `if i != j: return i - j` in the first case as well. Not sure whether that makes much of a difference.

One more thing, not related to that last commit. Contrary to other sparse matrix implementations, we don't do a range check for inputs. Of course, that might be considered a bug in its own right, but if you feel like it, you could address this here as well.

It depends on the school! "my_var is None" is a simple address lookup while "not my_var" implies a function call. So "my_var is None" is very fast compared to "not my_var". But I agree that is fighting for micro seconds that are negligible looking at the rest of the code...

Actually this is what I tried. But if you do that, you end up with some warning claiming that the comparison routine returns something different from 0,1,-1!

> One more thing, not related to that last commit.

Indeed, this needs to be fixed. I thought that `MatrixSpace` would have taken care of that. I will add a commit.

Is there any way to actually reach that `The input must be scalar or a dictionary` exception? Since the “entries is not a dict” case is already handled before, I think not.

The comment about the `coerce=False` case sounds like someone asking for a revival of #17658. So if anyone wonders just how bad this “really bad” could be, I'd say “very bad indeed”.

At some point, I had trouble with this but I do not remember exactly. I just learn a funny way to do it returning 1,0 or -1 fast:

```
return (i > j) - (i < j)
```
