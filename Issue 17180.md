# Issue 17180: symbolic modulo

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17417

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2014-11-29 08:12:44

Keywords: mod, function

There is currently no way to specify and simplify symbolic expressions modulo another symbolic expression. While `Mod` takes only numerics, the automatic simplification done by `ex.mod()` is not right because the expected result would be either `x` (for `x` integer) or `-3*floor(x<sup>3/3)+x</sup>3` (else).

```
sage: assume(x, "integer")
sage: (x^3).mod(3)
x^3
sage: (x^3).mod(3,hold=True)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-38-d8e5ba2bdd31> in <module>()
----> 1 (x**Integer(3)).mod(Integer(3),hold=True)

TypeError: mod() takes no keyword arguments
```

There may be Maxima functions for this but, if so, they aren't used by Sage.
