Firefox is by far the best support browser for SAGE.
I personally use opera a *lot* though; in fact, I'm writing
this email in opera.   I think there is some weird mangling
of percents by opera that is causing trouble.  We'll add
this bug to the bug tracker, so it'll be a high priority to fix.

I just tried the notebook in opera, and it's even worse now...
