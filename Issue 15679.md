# Issue 15679: Tensors on free modules of finite rank

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15916

Keywords: free module, tensor, tensor product

## Description
  
This ticket implements:

* *tensor products* of the type M\otimes ...\otimes M \otimes M* \otimes...\otimes M*
  where M is a free module of finite rank over a commutative ring R and M* is its dual (_k_ factors of M and _l_ factors of M*, say)
* the elements of the above tensor products, considered as *tensors* of type _(k,l)_ on M, i.e. multilinear forms (M*)<sup>_k_</sup> \times M<sup>_l_</sup> --> R, thanks to the canonical isomorphism (M*)* = M (which holds since M is a free module of finite rank)
* the following *tensor operations*:
  * operations inherent to the module structure (addition, multiplication by a ring element)
  * tensor product of two tensors
  * tensor contraction
  * symmetry / antisymmetry handling (on subset of the tensor arguments or on all arguments)
  * exterior product of alternating forms

No distinguished basis is assumed on the free module M; on the contrary many bases can be introduced. Each tensor has then various representations, via its components in the various bases. 

## Motivation and context

The ticket has been motivated by tensors on smooth manifolds over *R*, within the
[SageManifolds](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr) project. In this context, tensors on free modules appear at two levels:
* _tensors on tangent spaces:_
  * commutative ring R: real field *R*
  * free module M: tangent vector space at a given manifold's point
* _tensor fields on a manifold:_
  * commutative ring R: the set C<sup>oo</sup>(N) of smooth functions N--> *R*, where N is a parallelizable open set of the manifold
  * free module M: the set X(N) of smooth vector fields on N (since N is parallelizable, this is a free module; its rank is the manifold's dimension)

## Documentation

Apart from the numerous doctests in the code, some pieces of documentation are
* the tutorial worksheet posted [here](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/examples/html/SM_tensors_modules.html) (a pdf version is [here](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/examples/pdf/SM_tensors_modules.pdf))
* the "tensors on free modules" [reference manual](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/doc/tensors_free_module/index.html) (a pdf version is [here](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/doc/tensors_free_modules_ref.pdf)); it can also be generated via the command `sage -docbuild tensors_free_module html`

See also [this page](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/tensor_modules.html).

## Remarks


1. Although developed in the context of [SageManifolds](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr) (ticket:14865), the ticket is self-contained and does not depend on other parts of SageManifolds. It this respect, it can be viewed as some attempt to include a first subset of SageManifolds in Sage, with a moderate size: the ticket comprises 9391 lines of Python code (most of them being doctests), while at present SageManifolds contains 29240 lines of code. 

2. The ticket follows Sage's !Parent/Element scheme and the (new) category framework. In particular, the ticket's free module class ([FiniteFreeModule](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/doc/tensors_free_module/finite_free_module.html)) passes the module TestSuite.

3. It turned out to be necessary to develop a new class to implement free modules of finite rank. Indeed, the category of free modules does not exist yet in Sage: only those of generic modules (Modules) or free modules with a distinguished basis (ModulesWithBasis) are available. Now, the tangent space at a given point of a manifold is a vector space without any distinguished basis (in other words, while the tangent space is isomorphic to *R*<sup>n</sup>, there is no _canonical_ isomorphism, each isomorphism relying on the choice of some coordinate chart). The new class, [FiniteFreeModule](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/doc/tensors_free_module/finite_free_module.html), does not rely on any distinguished basis. It inherits directly from [sage.modules.module.Module](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/modules/sage/modules/module.html). In particular, it does not inherit from [sage.modules.module.Module_old.FreeModule_generic](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/modules/sage/modules/free_module.html#sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule_generic) since the latter does not conform to the new coercion model and seems to assume a distinguished basis (cf. its method [basis()](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/modules/sage/modules/free_module.html#sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule_generic)).

Is there any connection and/or overlap between this ticket and #15726?


---

Comment by egourgoulhon created at 2014-04-12 14:19:33

This ticket implements tensor modules T<sup>(k,l)</sup>(M) of a fixed type (k,l) over a free module M of finite rank, while #15726 implements the tensor algebra T(M), which is the direct sum of all T<sup>(k,l)</sup>(M).

Another major difference is that here the base module M is a generic free module, while in #15726 M is a free module with a distinguished basis (the classes TensorModule and TensorAlgebra of #15726 inherit from class CombinatorialFreeModule, which assumes a distinguished basis). In the present ticket, an arbitrary number of bases can be introduced on the free module M, along with the change-of-basis automorphisms, and each tensor has various sets of components, one per basis.

Another difference may regard symmetry/antisymmetry handling: the tensors implemented in this ticket can have arbitrary symmetries and/or antisymmetries. The symmetries are taken into account to reduce the storage of tensor components and to optimize some computations, such as the tensor product. But maybe something similar is implemented in #15726.

The ticket has been updated to coincide with the pure algebraic part of [SageManifolds v0.6](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/). Changes are:
1/ The possibility to use index notations for denoting tensor contractions or symmetrizations: the indices have to be passed in LaTeX notations (possibly without {}) as a string inside the square bracket operator, e.g.

```
sage: S = A['^{ab}_{cd}']*B['^d_a'] # equivalent to S = A.contract(0, 3, B, 1, 0)
```

to denote the tensor S<sup>b</sup><sub>c</sub> = A<sup>ab</sup><sub>cd</sub> B<sup>d</sup><sub>a</sub> ,

```
sage: S = A['^{(ab)}_{cd}']  # equivalent to S = A.symmetrize(0,1)
```

to denote the tensor S<sup>ab</sup><sub>cd</sub> = A<sup>(ab)</sup><sub>cd</sub>, and

```
sage: S = A['^{ab}_{[cd]}']  # equivalent to S = A.antisymmetrize(2,3)
```

to denote the tensor S<sup>ab</sup><sub>cd</sub> = A<sup>ab</sup><sub>[cd]</sub>.
See [this page](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/doc/tensors_free_module/tensor_with_indices.html) and [this one](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/doc/tensors_free_module/free_module_tensor.html#sage.tensor.modules.free_module_tensor.FreeModuleTensor.contract) for more details.

2/ The code for tensor contractions has been completely rewritten; it is more efficient and allows now for multiple contractions (as in the first example above).

3/ The argument of methods `symmetrize()` and `antisymmetrize()` in the `FreeModuleTensor` class is now directly a sequence of index positions (and no longer a single list/tuple encapsulating such a sequence).

Besides, new examples have been provided on http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/examples.html; two of them are directly relevant to this ticket:
* [tensors on free modules of finite rank](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/examples/html/SM_tensors_modules.html) (tutorial)
* [vector-field modules on the 2-sphere](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/examples/html/SM_vector_fields_S2.html) (a concrete example of use)

Doctest coverage: `sage -coverage src/sage/tensor/`

I don't think the string notation is very user friendly, `A['<sup>{ab}_{cd}']*B['</sup>d_a']` looks more like line noise. How about recognizing symbolic variables and the built-in function `any` as special:

    sage: var('a, d')
    sage: A[a, any, any, d] * B[d, a]

Or, perhaps better in the long run: Define your own index class that knows about whether indices are upper or lower. Then we can also check that you don't contract two upper indices, and/or automatically insert the metric there:

    sage: a, b, c, d = A.indices()
    sage: a   
    Upper index
    sage: A[a, b, c, d] * B[d, a]

Replying to [comment:20 vbraun]:
> Doctest coverage: `sage -coverage src/sage/tensor/`

OK I see: most private methods appear to have no doctest because their doctests have been put in the docstring of the class itself: this is the only way for them to appear in the generated html documentation. This is particularly true for the `__init__` methods (there are actually a lot of doctests for them). Shall the doctests be repeated in the docstring of the private methods ? What is the general policy for this ?

Your suggestion for `any` is quite compeling, thanks. Note that, in the present version, it is already possible to replace unrelevant indices with dots, which decreases the noise:

```
sage: S = A['^{a.}_{.d}']*B['^d_a']
```

You are right: in the long run, we should probably introduce an indice class to get rid of the strings. The only advantage of the present notation is that we do not have to spoil some variable names to denote indices: they can be set on the fly, to denote an operation like contraction where index notation is more clear, most operations being performed in an index-free setting.

The `__init__` docstring is used as the class docstring if you don't define a separate class docstring, and I would recommend using that.

You can document other underscore methods by adding, say,

```
.. automethod:: __mul__
```

at the end of the class docstring (possibly derived from the `__init__` docstring as above).

Not all underscore methods need to appear in the reference manual, though. The doctests are still tests, even if they are not end-user visible "documentation". And they are documentation for developers reading the source and wondering how to use that method...

Comment by tscrim created at 2014-09-29 15:55:29

What I generally do is put all of the important info in the class docstring, like the `INPUT` block and examples showing use-cases. In the `__init__` method, it is just creating a common example `X` and doing `TestSuite(X).run()` (and possibly repeating for some boarder cases).

Also what Volker is alluding to is that all methods, including underscore ones, must have some doctest.

Some quick comments/questions:

- Please remove the autogenerated files from git tracking (as they will be autogenerated :p).
- The imports from `tensor/modules` I feel like should be done using `tensor/all.py` rather than `all.py` (at the source root).
- I'm wondering if the `tensor/modules` doc should be built along with the `tensor` doc (rather than it's own separate thing) as `tensor` is small to begin with. However, I don't think there's any drawbacks to having it be separate since it's (essentially) disjoint from the other doc.
- Is there anything I can do with or you need from #15726? I'd like to make these compatible as much as possible.
- +1 to having a class for indices (once there is clear a need for it).

I really like the pictures on the Sage manifolds website and think this will be a great addition to Sage. Unfortunately I don't have time right now to do much of a review.

Best,

Travis

PS - You might also be interested in #9439.

OK.

Yes, this would be more consistent with the directory structure.

> - I'm wondering if the `tensor/modules` doc should be built along with the `tensor` doc (rather than it's own separate thing) as `tensor` is small to begin with. However, I don't think there's any drawbacks to having it be separate since it's (essentially) disjoint from the other doc.

Actually the current content of `tensor` (algebra of differential forms defined on a coordinate patch of R<sup>n</sup>) pertains more to smooth manifolds than to tensor modules over arbitrary commutative rings. 

> - Is there anything I can do with or you need from #15726? I'd like to make these compatible as much as possible.

Sure! There is clearly some overlap between the two and we should discuss this further. For instance, once a basis is chosen, a tensor from this ticket should be converted into an element of the tensor algebra of #15726. Let us keep in touch about this.

Yes this has clearly some connections with SageManifolds, as well as #10132 (now integrated into Sage) and your ticket about Lie algebras (#14901).

Hi,

* Following Volker's comment, doctests to all underscore methods have been added. Accordingly `sage -coverage src/sage/tensor/modules` results in 100% coverage. 
* Following Travis' one, (i) I've suppressed the spurious mention "autogenerated file" in the rst files (this resulted from some cut-and-paste; actually these files are not autogenerated) and (ii) I've moved the import of tensor/modules to `sage/tensor/all.py`. 

Some simple examples illustrating this ticket are on [this page](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/examples/html/SM_tensors_modules.html). Concrete examples of use in the framework of fields on a smooth manifold (modules over the algebra of scalar fields on S<sup>2</sup>) are [here](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/examples/html/SM_vector_fields_S2.html) (this requires #14865).

You shouldn't need those `.rst` because there are such files autogenerated by Sage's docbuilder (although they are a little more buried in the `/src/doc/en/reference/tensor/sage/`, or whatever documentation group you're considering) and you're not doing anything different as far as I can see.

Also on a quick glance through the recent commit, I noticed a colon missing on in these two places:

Actually, I've added these .rst files because they are not autogenerated in the present case. More precisely, the command `sage -docbuild tensors_free_module html` does not produce any `sage` subdirectory in `src/doc/en/tensors_free_module`. On the contrary the command `sage -docbuild reference html` produces a `sage` subdirectory in `src/doc/en/reference/tensor_free_modules`, which contains the autogenerated .rst files. As a result, if I simply copy the file `index.rst` from `src/doc/en/reference/tensor_free_modules` to `src/doc/en/tensors_free_module` and delete all the other .rst files (the "non-autogenerated" ones), I get the error message `toctree contains reference to nonexisting document u'sage/tensor/modules/finite_rank_free_module'`.  Certainly, I am not doing something properly here. Any help on this would be appreciated...

You should only have the `modules/index.rst`. The docbuilder will not always process incremental changes correctly, you might have to `sage -b && make doc-clean && make doc`

Edit: added the "not"

I tried but it did not helped. To make things clear, let me stress that the problem arises because we wanted to have a separate reference manual for tensors on free modules, in a directory that we created for this purpose: `src/doc/en/tensors_free_module`, which differs from the corresponding section in the main Sage reference manual (directory `src/doc/en/reference/tensor_free_modules`). For the latter, everything works well: the only .rst file under `src/doc/en/reference/tensor_free_modules` is `index.rst` and it suffices for the docbuilder to produce the complete documentation. The problem arises only for `src/doc/en/tensors_free_module`. So the question might be: "how to produce a separate reference manual for some subpart of Sage library ?".

You can't and you shouldn't be able to. The top-level sections correspond to the src/sage subdirectories, as they should. You can, however, be quite fancy in `src/doc/en/reference/modules/index.rst`, see e.g. the combinat section.

That's not true, there are significantly more top-level docs than top-level sections in `src/sage`, the first one that comes to mind is `finite_fields`. I'm taking a look at it right now to see what's going on.

I think the problem is you put things in `src/doc/en/tensors_free_module`, as opposed to `src/doc/en/reference/tensors_free_module`. So with this branch you should be able to run Volker's commands (or `sage -docbuild all html` or (what I did to check) `sage -docbuild reference/tensor_free_modules inventory` and `sage -docbuild reference/tensor_free_modules html`).

It works! Thank you very much Travis. This yields exactly what I had in mind. Moreover, it is nice that one can get rid of the directory `src/doc/en/tensors_free_module` and stay only with `src/doc/en/reference/tensor_free_modules`, for duplication is root of all evil ;-)

Comment by tscrim created at 2014-11-23 21:53:42

Okay, I've made a first pass of changes. So overall it looks really good, but there's currently some issues that need addressing. Here's what I've changed:

- Removed trailing whitespace.
- Corrected some indentations.
- Changed lowercase `repr` output into Uppercase.
- Added an `__eq__` method to `TensorWithIndices`.
- Fixed some doc formatting (there's a likely more to do on this). However you have 2 conventions, `type-`(a,b)` tensor` and `type `(a,b)` tensor` and IMO you should pick one and stick with it.
- Added `TestSuite` to all classes.
- Changed some `TypeError`'s to `ValueError`'s because the data type was correct but the values within were not.
- Made `_an_element_` of the finite rank free module return an element with a basis.
- Made the `__eq__` test of tensors check first by identity because it was really annoying to me that `t == t` raised an error.
- Removed the `__hash__` and `__eq__` of `FiniteRankFreeModule` since `UniqueRepresentation` takes care of it.
- Changed errors from `This is an error message.` to `this is an error message` as I believe it more standard.
- Some other misc. changes on some doctests and things like `l != []` for `not l` (it's marginally faster).

Some questions:

- Do we need the class `FormattedExpansion`? It doesn't seem to be used.
- Why do you have `_new_instance`, couldn't you use `__copy__`?
- Should we make the morphisms inherit from `Morphism` and/or have their parents be some kind of `Homset`?
- Could we expand out some of the names, ex. `comp()` to `components()` (perhaps with aliases for the short names)?
- I'm not too happy about the name `basis_change` as I would try `change_of_basis` first, but within that method, could we also check transitivity (there's a method which does this already, but I forget what it's called)?
- In Sage, the `view` function outputs as a pdf. So the name of the `view()` method is confusing to me. Do you think we could change the name to something else like `expand`?

Some things to do:

- Implement a `_matrix_` method so (1,1)-tensors `t` can be passed as `matrix(t)`.
- Fix all failures from the `TestSuite` or justify why we can skip certain tests.

There will be more to do I think, but it probably won't be too major.

I shall reply later to your questions, but I can already say that I implemented morphisms last week, in the working repository of SageManifolds at https://github.com/sagemanifolds/sage. The free module morphisms inherit from `Morphism` and their parent class from `Homset`. Coercions have been implemented between endomorphisms and type-(1,1) tensors. I shall merge this branch into the ticket branch this week.

OK I will work on this in the coming weeks.

Yes, we need it: it is used by the method `view()` of classes `FreeModuleTensor` and `FreeModuleAltForm`, to have a nice output, either text formatted or LaTeX formatted (notebook). 

> - Why do you have `_new_instance`, couldn't you use `__copy__`?

Actually `_new_instance` is not performing a copy: it simply creates an instance of the same type and same general characteristics (e.g. tensor type), but leave it empty (i.e. it does not perform any copy of stored data, like components).

> - Should we make the morphisms inherit from `Morphism` and/or have their parents be some kind of `Homset`?

This is done in the new commit. It introduces free module homomorphisms, via
- the parent class `FreeModuleHomset` (subclass of `sage.categories.homset.Homset`)
- the element class `FiniteRankFreeModuleMorphism` (subclass of
  `sage.categories.morphism.Morphism`)
Coercions to/from type-(1,1) tensors have been introduced as well.


> - Could we expand out some of the names, ex. `comp()` to `components()` (perhaps with aliases for the short names)?

This is done in the new commit, with `comp()` as an alias to `components()` (since it is really usefull to have a short name to access to components).

Yes, you are right: `change_of_basis` is a better name. The change has been performed in the new commit.

Not done yet. Note however that transitivity is implemented in the method `FreeModuleTensor.common_basis()`.

We thought quite a lot about the name of this method; here we really need a short name, because it is used very often in interactive mode (notebook). The idea is to display tensors in a nice human readable form, but not to change their state, which something like `expand` might suggest. `display` was too long. An alternative was `show` but we eliminated it because in Sage it is used for graphic outputs. So the short name that we ended with was `view`. We may also wonder why `view` should be reserved for pdf output. Wouldn't `view_pdf` or `make_pdf` be more suggestive ?

This is done in the new commit, but on components instead of tensors (indeed, constructing a matrix from a tensor would have required an extra argument: the basis, to define which components are used). So currently, if `t` is a type-(1,1) tensor and `e` is a module basis, we have `matrix(t.components(e))` yielding a matrix of base ring elements representing the components of `t` w.r.t. basis `e`. 


> - Fix all failures from the `TestSuite` or justify why we can skip certain tests.

Done. Some fixes consisted in initializing the objects (e.g. by setting some components) prior to the TestSuite. Note that `_test_category` had to be skipped when constructing the object by a direct call to `__init__`, since the correct construction must be performed by a call to `parent().element_class`. In the latter case, `_test_category` passed.

I'm thinking we should combine the `*morphismTensor` into the `*morphism` methods and the make `FreeModuleTensor` a base class of `FreeModuleHomset`. This should fix the need to skip part of the test suite for those classes. Or did you get the dreaded "layout conflict" error?

I've had two thoughts about this. The first is pulling out the functionality into a `DiGraph` instance where the vertices are bases and the edges are the various transition maps, thus you could use the `shorted_path` method. Also suppose you have a chain `A -> B -> C -> D`, along the way you would need to compute `A -> C`, and I'm thinking we should store that morphism (or leave it as an optional argument). Note that you might have to make the transition matrices immutable.

IDK why it was chosen, but for better or worse, that's the current standard. Also the name doesn't quite match what it does IMO. So I'd really like a different name. Perhaps `display`, `print`, `equation`, `peq` (short for `print_equation`), ...?

These seem to indicate the need for a parent for these elements. For say the linear forms, you should just need a class

```
LinFormParent(TensorFreeModule):
    Element = FreeModuleLinForm
```

(with perhaps a `_repr_` stating its the set of all linear forms) and an `if` statement when constructing the `TensorFreeModule`. This also means they get the benefits from having a proper category. Do you mind doing this?

Also could you change things like

```
"blah" + str(obj) + "foo"
```

to

```
"blah {} foo".format(obj)
```

(or if you prefer `"blah %s foo"%(obj,)`)? I believe this is more pythonic, and it makes it a lot easier to read. Thanks.

Actually, given that endomorphisms are now properly dealt with, as Maps, with some coercion from type-(1,1) tensors, I am wondering about the necessity to maintain the class `FreeModuleEndomorphismTensor`...

OK, maybe `display` is a good replacement of `view`. It is longer to write, but one can always use TAB completion.

Not always, if I understand correctly. For elements that have a proper parent, like `FreeModuleTensor`, the construction has to be performed by `parent.element_class`, not by a direct call to `FreeModuleTensor.__init__`, for `_test_category` to be passed (cf. the doctest of `FreeModuleTensor.__init__`). If I am correct, this is a general feature of Sage's category framework.
But for elements that are implemented as a subclass of `FreeModuleTensor`, like `FreeModuleLinForm`, you are right: a proper parent is missing (see below).

Yes I will try. For `FreeModuleLinForm` there should be no problem. However for `FreeModuleAltForm`,  it seems we are facing the element subclass issue discussed in [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/tZW9T-AixBQ). Indeed, not all type-(0,p) tensors are alternating forms. Suppose one wants to compute A+B, with A an alternating p-form and B a generic type-(0,p) tensor. Then A and B will have different parents, so that `A._add_` cannot be called directly. Of course, one could implement coercions from alternating p-forms to type-(0,p) tensors, but this involves creating a new object from scratch, A' say, by copying the components of A. For objects with a lot of components, in many different bases, this may be not very efficient...

OK, I will. Btw, besides being more pythonic, is there any technical advantage in writing 
`"blah {} foo".format(obj)` instead of `"blah" + str(obj) + "foo"`? IMHO, the latter is more readable than the former.

The documentation for `FiniteRankFreeModule` should really explain what's the difference between `FiniteRankFreeModule(ZZ, 3)` and `FreeModule(ZZ, 3)`. This documentation should be understandable by somebody who has never looked at this ticket.

You write

```
The class :class:`FiniteRankFreeModule` does not inherit from
:class:`~sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule_generic` since the latter
is a derived class of :class:`~sage.modules.module.Module_old`,
which does not conform to the new coercion model.
```

but that's no longer true given #10513.

We're on the same wavelength. Hopefully there won't be a (very annoying) technical issue with python being unable to figure out the MRO.

Let me know if you have any questions.

The more I think about it, the more I like `display`. Thanks for changing it.

However for `FreeModuleAltForm`,  it seems we are facing the element subclass issue discussed in [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/tZW9T-AixBQ). Indeed, not all type-(0,p) tensors are alternating forms. Suppose one wants to compute A+B, with A an alternating p-form and B a generic type-(0,p) tensor. Then A and B will have different parents, so that `A._add_` cannot be called directly. Of course, one could implement coercions from alternating p-forms to type-(0,p) tensors, but this involves creating a new object from scratch, A' say, by copying the components of A. For objects with a lot of components, in many different bases, this may be not very efficient...

I guess the question is how often do you expect to do this? Plus I suspect a lot of the data can just be referenced, not copied, since the data is (essentially) immutable. It's not much different than other parts of Sage and having to be careful about parents. For instance:

```
sage: %timeit ZZ(1) + QQ(1)
100000 loops, best of 3: 10.4 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ(1) + QQ(1)
100000 loops, best of 3: 9.73 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit QQ(1) + QQ(1)
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.53 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit QQ(1) + QQ(1)
100000 loops, best of 3: 7.22 Âµs per loop
```

The issue is to minimize the penalty. A benefit from doing the implementation is you can add two alternating forms and get an alternating form (for free I believe).

The `"blah %s foo"%obj` is the fastest (not by too much), but if `obj` is a tuple, an error gets raised (the wrapping `(obj,)` gets rid of this for marginal penalty). The `format` allows you to do fancier things like repeating objects, for some time, the `%` syntax was deprecated in python3 for `format` (again, not anymore), and it's on the same order of speed as using `+`'s. So really there's no real technical advantage other than readability (all python code I've previously seen used the `%` and more recently `format`, but to be honest, recent python code has all be Sage).

Somewhat unrelated, I do miss the C++ `cout<<"blah"<<obj<<"foo"`...

Last I agree with Jeroen, especially comment:47.

Thanks again for your work on all of this.

Comment by egourgoulhon created at 2015-01-23 15:41:40

Thank you very much Travis and Jeroen for your comments. 
I've just committed the following changes:

- Introduced the parent class `ExtPowerFreeModule` for alternating forms of a
  given degree on a free module.
  All alternating forms are now described by the element class
  `FreeModuleAltForm`. In particular, the class `FreeModuleLinForm` has been
  suppressed.

- Introduced the parent class `FreeModuleLinearGroup` for the general linear group GL(M) of a
  free module M. The corresponding element class is `FreeModuleAutomorphism`, which
  has been entirely rewritten (it is now both a group element class and a class of
  type-(1,1) tensors).

- Added the following coercions:
    - alternating forms of degree p ---> tensors of type (0,p)
    - tensors of type (0,1) ---> alternating forms of degree 1 (linear form)
    - automorphisms ---> tensors of type (1,1)
    - automorphisms ---> endomorphisms

- Added the following conversions:
    - (invertible) endomorphisms ---> automorphisms
    - (invertible) type-(1,1) tensors ---> automorphisms

- Suppressed the classes `FreeModuleAutomorphismTensor` and `FreeModuleIdentityTensor`, 
  which were no longer needed thanks to the above coercions. 

- Suppressed the class `FreeModuleEndomorphismTensor`, which was no longer needed
  thanks to the coercions endomorphisms <---> tensors of type (1,1). 

- Renamed method `view()` to `display()`; `view()` is still there (it is heavily used by the users of SageManifolds) but it is set to deprecated.

- Implemented transitivity in `FiniteRankFreeModule.change_of_basis()`, i.e. if the changes of basis A->B and B->C are known and the change of basis A->C is required, it is computed by automorphism composition.

- Added argument `from_family` in `FiniteRankFreeModule.basis()`, thereby allowing to construct a new basis from a family of linearly independent module elements (previously, one had to pass a previous basis and an explicit automorphism relating it to the new basis). 

- Systematic use of `"...{}...".format(...)` instead of `"..." + str(...) + "..."` (except in LaTeX strings, because of the {})

- Reorganized documentation files in src/doc/en/reference/tensor_free_modules/*.rst

- Added comparisons
  - between `FiniteRankFreeModule` and `FreeModule`,
  - between `FiniteRankFreeModule` and `VectorSpace`,
  - between `FiniteRankFreeModule` and `CombinatorialFreeModule`
in the documentation of `FiniteRankFreeModule`. You can see the result [here](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/preview/reference/tensor_free_modules/sage/tensor/modules/finite_rank_free_module.html). I've also taken into account #comment:47.

All test suites (both for parents and elements) are passed.

The new commit makes the ticket coincide with the algebraic part of [SageManifolds 0.7](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/changelog.html), which was released yesterday. The changes are very tiny with respect to commit 9684687; here is the log:

- src/sage/tensor/modules/comp.py:
  `zero_element()` --> `zero()` (`zero_element()` being deprecated in Sage)
- src/sage/tensor/modules/format_utilities.py:
  improve documentation
- class `FormattedExpansion`:
  - suppress the attribute "tensor" (it was actually useless)
  - rename attribute "txt" to "_txt"
  - rename attribute "latex" to "_latex"  
- class `FiniteRankFreeModule`:
  method `identity_map()`: add arguments "name" and "latex_name"  
- class `FreeModuleHomset`: add method `one()` (for endomorphism sets)
- class `FreeModuleTensor`:
  suppress methods `__radd__()` and `__rsub__()` : they were introduced to write `0 + t` 
  and `0 - t`, where `t` is a tensor, before the coercion of 0 to a tensor was implemented.
- src/doc/en/reference/tensor_free_modules/index.rst:add html target ".. _tensors-on-free-modules"

In the patchbot log, there are many doctest failures but they pertain to other parts of Sage: all doctests of files in src/sage/tensor/modules (i.e. the sources of this ticket) pass. So I am puzzled: why the patchbot returns so many failures? Could it be that the ticket branch is based on Sage 6.6.beta5?

It has to do with file permissions on the patchbot account. They are harmless and not really errors as far as Sage is concerned, but comes from python IIRC.
