When I do 

```
L.homfly_polynomial()
```

I just get 

```
ImportError: No module named homily
 }}}
That should give me a message to do the optional package instead, I think.

Fixed by making libhomfly a standard package in

- #25705: Make libhomfly and libbraiding standard packages

(merged in Sage 8.4.beta0).

Proposing to close as invalid.
