CC:  @fchapoton

The method `coprime_integers` is documented to return only *positive* integers, but it would be much more natural to return *non-negative* integers. It would in particular imply that `len(n.coprime_integers(n)) == euler_phi(n)` (which currently fails for `n == 1`).

The fact that various callers of `coprime_integers` need to work around this shows that the current choice is wrong.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25657

no. The reason why "euler_phi(1)=1" is because 1 is coprime to 1, not because 0 is coprime to 1.

Well, both are true so it doesn't matter how you count. The point is `euler_phi(1) == 1`.

In fact if a is an integer, then a divides 0 so the greatest common divisor 
of a and 0 is a. Thus 0 is not coprime to any integer. 
In particular 1.coprime_integers(n) should return [1,..., n-1] as is the case now.

Thus I would vote to close this ticket.

Right, sorry :). 

The patchbot complains but the failing test

```
sage -t src/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_finite_field.py
```

passes on my machine. 

Your changes look fine. Though I do not have much experience with cython.
So I cannot really judge things like Integer(ilong) vs smallInteger(k). 
Is seems to be supposed to speedup for integers <256? Can you provide timings for this?

I am not sure if that was a bug. After all the behaviour matched the description.
We may want to add a deprecation warning to indicate the change in behaviour?

If we stay close to the definition of euler_phi, then
`1.coprime_integers(n)` should return `[1]`
so it does matter. Returning `[0]` seems to be more pythonic, but returning `[1]` seems a little closer to math conventions. I would tend to the pythonic interpretation. But both behaviours are better than `[]`. So I am fine with either.

I disagree with the latter. I have never seen anybody write `n mod n`, mathematicians typically write `0 mod n`.

So both Python and math indicate that `[0]` is the right answer for `1.coprime_integers(1)`.

It's obvious to me that the current function doesn't do "The Right Thing". So it's a bug to me (even if documented).
