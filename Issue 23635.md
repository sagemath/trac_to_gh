# Issue 23635: Singular expansion for implicitly defined function

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23872

Original creator: behackl

Original creation time: 2017-09-16 07:46:49

CC:  cheuberg dkrenn

Given an implicitly defined function `y(z) = z \Phi(y(z))`, there is a well-known approach (Analytic Combinatorics, Flajolet+Sedgewick, Chapter VI.7) of how to determine a singular expansion for `y(z)`.

This branch adds a new asymptotic generator which computes this singular expansion.

Before this can be properly reviewed, there are at least two things that I'd like to take care of beforehand:

- There is still a small bit of functionality missing, namely the handling of periodicities.
- I'd also like to have some more (verified) doctests.

Otherwise, I'm open for suggestions and improvements.

(Note: I currently have no compiled version of 8.1.beta5 available; so I locally rebased your branch on 8.0 ... so it might be that this is an incompatibility between 8.0 and 8.1.beta5)

`./sage -docbuild -u -k` yields

Thanks, fixed.

As far as I was able to check, the code yields correct results in both the periodic as well as the aperiodic case. I am, however, inclined to improve the documentation a little bit before putting this up for review (more examples + tests; maybe even a description of the algorithm? Also, a reference to The Book would probably be a good idea).

I added two reviewer commits.
Please
1. Add function to toc and to docstring of class `AsymptoticExpansionGenerators`
2. "to be not" -> "not to be"
3. Phi must be analytic around 0
4. tau: list assumption of Flajolet-Sedgewick.
5. comparison with known expansion of Catalan GF
6. Move all assumptions on Phi to the description
7. Check input as far as reasonable (phi(0) != 0, phi not affine linear)
8. examples: symbolic tau is possible 
9. examples: tau can be stupid.
10. Cite Flajolet-Sedgewick
11. examples: how to do singularity analysis afterwards.

I forgot to add: I am not convinced by the code for periodic phi.

After some more discussions with cheuberg, this is the current status:

- Take care of 1-10 mentioned in the comment above,
- Remove the part of `ImplicitExpansion` handling the periodic part,
- Add another function (e.g. `ImplicitExpansionPeriodicPart`) returning the expansion for `g(z)` where `y(z)/z = g(z^p)`.
- And add yet another function (e.g. `InverseFunctionAnalysis`) returning the asymptotic expansion describing the coefficient growth.

I had a look at your changes, thank you. I added a few reviewer commits, please cross-review. Setting to needs_review such that patchbots see the ticket.

Thanks, I've cross-reviewed your changes, LGTM.

There is now also the "final" method, `InverseFunctionAnalysis`, returning the asymptotic expansion of the coefficient growth via singularity analysis.

Note that currently there is a minor issue with this method: in case `tau` is not specified when calling the method (or when `tau` is symbolic), this leads to a coercion problem to be solved at #23921.

I reviewed the new method; added a few reviewer commits. Please fix the error documented in my last commit.

The bug should be fixed with my last commit -- however, I'm not sure about leaving the doctest as-is (of course with changed output and description), as the default precision is rather high and the computation of such a precise expansion might be too much.

What do you think?

142 seconds for the tests for this file [on a patchbot](https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/23872/LinuxMint/18.1/x86_64/4.4.0-89-generic/rk02-math/2017-09-24%2000:12:05?short) vs. 51 seconds before [on the same patchbot](https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/23872/LinuxMint/18.1/x86_64/4.4.0-89-generic/rk02-math/2017-09-22%2018:35:47) seem to be excessive; so we should remove the test. The variant would be to include a test where the default precision has been set to a small python integer.

It took me some time, but I finally managed to fix the issue with `default_prec`. Up for review again.

The test needed to be modified: we need to set a python integer to actually trigger the error fixed in [a6358f1](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit?id=a6358f1b57e955f7f15ea6541ffa3edcea42949b). For test purposes, I then reverted [a6358f1](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit?id=a6358f1b57e955f7f15ea6541ffa3edcea42949b) and the bug reappeared, so to be sure that the test now tests what needs to tested.

dkrenn: please have a look at commit [e619e5d](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=e619e5d01e2c11baeee076910655d5a67ef60b27) because it heavily modifies your commit [3214c83](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=3214c83c3a91f0eea73ad0068473661b1c228bfc) from #19532. (The new code, however, is now equivalent to the comparable situations in Laurent series and power series rings).

(The new code, however, is now equivalent to the comparable situations in Laurent series and power series rings).

Just FYI: I changed the `default_prec` code for asymptotic rings, because the precision was cached upon creation of the first asymptotic ring and could then not be changed, i.e. changes of the `series_precision()` parameter were not picked up.

This change is fine for me (even preferable over the now old implementation).

Thanks for having a look.

`@`cheuberg: what remains to be done here? The patchbots also seem to be happy with the changes.

Please cross-review my last commit [317eb16](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=317eb16079189d8e6f1b03c377fe36add34bc239) if this has not yet happened (Reviewing should include a check whether the test tests what it should be test; see my comments in [comment:30 cheuberg]. If satisfied, set to positive review. (At the moment, we have an unhappy patchbot, but this is a timeout somewhere else).

Comment by behackl created at 2017-10-10 19:21:12

In this case: I cross-reviewed your commit, everything looks good to me, and the test tests the correct thing.

Thus this is `positive_review`.
