CC:  @cheuberg @dkrenn

Given an implicitly defined function `y(z) = z \Phi(y(z))`, there is a well-known approach (Analytic Combinatorics, Flajolet+Sedgewick, Chapter VI.7) of how to determine a singular expansion for `y(z)`.

This branch adds a new asymptotic generator which computes this singular expansion.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23872

Before this can be properly reviewed, there are at least two things that I'd like to take care of beforehand:

- There is still a small bit of functionality missing, namely the handling of periodicities.
- I'd also like to have some more (verified) doctests.

Otherwise, I'm open for suggestions and improvements.

Thanks, fixed.

As far as I was able to check, the code yields correct results in both the periodic as well as the aperiodic case. I am, however, inclined to improve the documentation a little bit before putting this up for review (more examples + tests; maybe even a description of the algorithm? Also, a reference to The Book would probably be a good idea).

After some more discussions with cheuberg, this is the current status:

- Take care of 1-10 mentioned in the comment above,
- Remove the part of `ImplicitExpansion` handling the periodic part,
- Add another function (e.g. `ImplicitExpansionPeriodicPart`) returning the expansion for `g(z)` where `y(z)/z = g(z^p)`.
- And add yet another function (e.g. `InverseFunctionAnalysis`) returning the asymptotic expansion describing the coefficient growth.

Thanks, I've cross-reviewed your changes, LGTM.

There is now also the "final" method, `InverseFunctionAnalysis`, returning the asymptotic expansion of the coefficient growth via singularity analysis.

Note that currently there is a minor issue with this method: in case `tau` is not specified when calling the method (or when `tau` is symbolic), this leads to a coercion problem to be solved at #23921.
