# Issue 19140: dot product of sparse vector with dense vector: segfault

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2015-10-08 21:43:42


```
sage: v = random_vector(QQ, 5, sparse=True)
sage: w = random_vector(QQ, 5, sparse=False)
sage: v.dot_product(w)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Sage will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

I'm pretty sure the problem is this line in the sparse `_dot_product_coerce_`:

```
cdef dict e = (<FreeModuleElement_generic_sparse>right)._entries
```

which assumes the right vector is a sparse vector. I will fix this and post shortly.

Easy enough fix (even if it many not be the "best", but I would argue that if this is a bottleneck, then one needs to be more careful about dense/sparse vectors).

I think this would be much better:

```
try:
    e = (<FreeModuleElement_generic_sparse?>right)._entries
except TypeError:
    ...
```

Not `except:` but `except TypeError:`

*facepalm* Thanks.

What does the question mark mean in

```
e = (<FreeModuleElement_generic_sparse?>right)._entries
```

For checking the type. See the type checking section in http://docs.cython.org/src/reference/language_basics.html.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

This fixes the problem for me. I don't know if it's the best way to do it, but I agree with [#comment:2 comment #2], so I'll give it a positive review.

John: essentially

```
cdef t a = <t?>b
```

is equivalent to

```
if not isinstance(b, t):
    raise TypeError
cdef t a = <t>b
```

I didn't run doctests (I hope any of you did) but the change does indeed look good.
