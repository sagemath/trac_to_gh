# Issue 28556: 2 more random doctest failures

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28793

Original creator: @mwageringel

The following doctest fails occasionally when, due to collisions, the generated matrix has fewer than 99 elements:

```
            sage: M = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 1000, 1000, sparse=True).an_element()
            sage: M.density()
            99/1000000
```


Moreover, this probabilistic `giacpy_sage` test in multi_polynomial_ideal.py sometimes fails due to the output containing additional lines:

```
            sage: I9.groebner_basis("giac",proba_epsilon=1e-7) # optional - giacpy_sage, long time (3s)
            Running a probabilistic check for the reconstructed Groebner basis...
            Polynomial Sequence with 143 Polynomials in 9 Variables
```


These can be seen in the patchbot results [here](https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/28756/CentOS%20Linux/7.7.1908/x86_64/3.10.0-1062.4.3.el7.x86_64/r640/2019-11-19%2001:00:01) and [here](https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/27154/CentOS%20Linux/7.7.1908/x86_64/3.10.0-1062.4.3.el7.x86_64/r640/2019-11-19%2021:13:12), for example.
