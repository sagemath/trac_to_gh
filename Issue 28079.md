# Issue 28079: Making an is_dynamical_belyi_map() function

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28316

Keywords: dynamics, SI2019,sagedays103

We define a dynamical Belyi map to be a dynamical system f:P<sup>1->P</sup>1 where the branch points are contained in {0,1,infinity} and the post critical set is contained in {0,1,infinity}. This checks if a dynamical system is conjugate to a dynamical Belyi map.
