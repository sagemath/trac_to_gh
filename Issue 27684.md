Apparently some Linux systems don't come with libxml2 installed, which is a polymake prerequisite.

```
mkoeppe.sphere$ make polymake
...
[polymake-3.4] checking libxml2 installation ... Could not find configuration program xml2-config for library libxml2.
[polymake-3.4] Probably you need to install development package for it;
[polymake-3.4] usually it is called libxml2-devel or similarly.
[polymake-3.4] If the library is installed at a non-standard location,
[polymake-3.4] please specify it in option --with-libxml2

I appreciate your efforts with spkg-configure.m4; but I don't support adding more prerequisites to Sage. Sage-the-distribution works well for installing lots of math software on poorly maintained university computers. My goal in this ticket is to bring the polymake package to the same standard - make it as easy to install as other sage packages.

a library should only be vendored if on a system supported by Sage it is either not available, or broken. Otherwise it is a bloat that is killing the project, rather than improving it.

there are already other optional packages, e.g. igraph, in Sage that require libxml2.
