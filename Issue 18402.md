----> 1 I.divides(K(Integer(0)))

/home/jec/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_ideal.pyc in divides(self, other)
   1753         if not isinstance(other, NumberFieldIdeal):
   1754             other = self.number_field().ideal(other)
-> 1755         return (other / self).is_integral()
   1756 
   1757     def factor(self):

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'NumberFieldIdeal' and 'NumberFieldFractionalIdeal'
```

This is failing because the divides method does this:

```
       if not isinstance(other, NumberFieldIdeal):
            other = self.number_field().ideal(other)
        return (other / self).is_integral()
```

and the / operator does not like having the left operand the zero ideal (which is not a fractional ideal).  Similarly, I.divides(K.ideal(0)) fails.

The simple fix is to check whether other.is_zero() first.

You can always use the commit hash, that should always work:

```
git fetch trac  # or just "git fetch" depending on your configuration
git checkout f61588ecabefc84103c4daa40e648b76e6e58828

I hope you don't mind that I'm making this ticket much more general than you intended, but there is really not much point in fixing one specific method when maybe the whole approach needs to be changed.
