In the light of #20380 and #20423, it would be good to test this on Cygwin.

From what I see, the patch removed is the patchupstream integrated (see https://gforge.inria.fr/scm/viewvc.php/mpfr/trunk/src/mpfr-impl.h?r1=10257&r2=10260&view=patch and #20423) so Cygwin should be ok.

Adding a dependency on #21675 to ensure a correct ordering of these tickets.
