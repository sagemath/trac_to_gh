CC:  jdemeyer

For Cygwin versions less than 3.0.0 (and only Cygwin) this replaces the use of `multiprocessing.Pool` in the `sage_setup.docbuild.build_many` function, with a naÃ¯ve but "good enough" (it works in general) parallel process pool that does not rely on starting processes from threads.

This is needed for #27214, because the specific combination of using `MAP_NORESERVE` `mmap`s and forking processes from a thread can result in a bug in Cygwin (fixed in 3.0.0) which causes unhandled segfaults to occur in any code that is run during the docbuild which uses libgap.

So this is really only needed so that the docs can continue to be built on systems (including my primary development environment, as well as the buildbot) that do not yet have Cygwin >= 3.0.0 once #27214 is applied.

Jeroen, you will likely have thoughts about this.  Keep in mind, it's not meant to be at all robust--just a quick workaround so I don't have to spend too much more time on it.  But if you have any thoughts on straightforward improvements to this I'm all for it.

Obviously a better workaround, if it were possible, would be to use the much talked-about idea for generalizing the parallel processing loop from the Sage doctester. But since we don't have that yet this will do for now.

Also, in general I don't like code of the form

```
if A_is_not_broken:
    A()
else:
    B()
```

If `B` works well enough to replace `A`, then why don't we just use `B` unconditionally?

This is especially relevant when `A` involves `multiprocessing.Pool` which has other issues (that's why I didn't use it in the doctester).

So I would like to know if there is a good reason to not use your "simplistic multiprocessing.Pool replacement" on all systems.

Some comments on the code:

1. This should use `os.wait()` instead of `time.sleep(5)`. Unless I'm missing something, this should be robust.

2. A few comments would be helpful.

3. `not any(filter(None, workers))` is not an easy condition to understand. I would write it as `all(w is None for w in workers)`.

4. I don't think that there is a need to gracefully shutdown the workers in the `finally` block.

Yes, that should be much better.

+1

I thought it was pretty straightforward, but I guess the `not any` is a little confusing.

I think there is: Or at least to try to SIGTERM first. Reason being this block can be reached if one process exits in error, while other processes are still working perfectly fine.  You want to gracefully shut them down and ensure that their atexit handlers run, clean up temp files, etc.

> In general, I like it. It's simple but the use case is sufficiently simple that we don't need anything more complicated. And it says a lot about `multiprocess.Pool` that this might actually work better than `multiprocessing.Pool`.

I don't know that it says a lot. I don't think it actually works "better" on the whole, just in this one case. Keep in mind also that `multiprocessing.Pool` implements a lot of generic functionality (e.g. multiple simultaneous `map_async` jobs) that simply aren't needed for this simpler use case.

One downside to this approach is that there is no data returned from the child processes to the parent. So for example an exception raised in a worker cannot be re-raised from the parent.  Instead I just raise a generic `RuntimeError` if the process exited with an error code.  I simulated this case in testing and you can still see the worker's exception and traceback printed to stderr, so that was good-enough for my purposes.

Partly for the reason I mentioned at the end of my previous comment, and partly just because I need this *now* and although I'm convinced it's robust-enough for my use it's still not well-tested.

How about for now we special-case this, and then for the next release make it a priority to finally get at least an initial version of the doctest forker code released and replace it with that?

At first I did just replace this with just plain `map(target, args)` but I wasn't satisfied: It was slow (obviously) and made memory usage even worse than it already is, over time.  It still seems better, if not kind of brushing other problems under the rug, to build each sub-doc in its own process that can easily be cleaned up when it's done.

The parallel version only took about 20 minutes to get working.

I thought of doing that as a solution, but then you start involving signal handling and basically reimplementing parts of the doctester.  I have another solution that's a bit ugly but simpler.

It would be nice if there were a sort of `multiprocessing.wait()` that could wait for any one `multiprocessing.Process` to finish (or maybe one out of a specific list thereof).  Since multiprocessing already tracks its child processes this could be done.  Maybe I'll propose it...
