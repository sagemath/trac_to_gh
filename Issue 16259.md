There should be a proper class for Selmer groups of number fields K(S,m), similar to the existing and related S-unit groups and S-class-group classes: it fits into the short exact sequence

  ` 1 --> O<sup>*_{K,S}/(O</sup>*_{K,S})^m --> K(S,m) --> Cl_{K,S}[m] --> 1 . `

Currently K.selmer_group(S,m) just returns a list of generators; it should be a proper finite abelian group.  Angelos Koutsianas already has code which expresses a given element in terms of the generators.

I have code which implements a new function which on input (K,S,p) with p prime, returns K(S,p) as an abstract vector space together with two maps, one from the abstract space to K^* and one (the harder one) which takes an element of K^* whose image in K<sup>*/(K</sup>*)^p lies in K(S,p) and returns the associated abstract vector space element.  This is needed from some applications (in progress).  

My implementation is based on code I wrote ~15 years ago in Magma.  It does not actually define a new class but provides all the functionality one needs.

I created a new ticket #31345 for this in the case m=p.  I probably should have reused this ticket instead, but this one can stay in case the improved versions are extended to general m in future.
