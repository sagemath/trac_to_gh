Keywords: incidence matrix, zero entries

We implement a method that obtains a new `GF(2)` matrix that contains 1 if and only if the corresponding entry is zero.

Motivation: This method is useful to obtain the incidence matrix of of a polyhedron from the slack matrix in #29837.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29839

why can't you use `mod`?

```
sage: M = Matrix(ZZ, [[0,1],[0,1]])
sage: M.mod(2)
[0 1]
[0 1]
```

Because it is slow. I just copied the construction of the parent from `_mod_two`.
I really don't know why, but `change_ring` is really slow (e.g. for `ZZ` -> `GF(2)`). It should be improved, but maybe not in this ticket.

`_mod_two` uses the ring with two elements to obtain the parent. However, `get_matrix_class` gives you `modn` in this case. It gives you `mod2` if you pass the field with two elements.

When? As in `slack_matrix.apply_map`?

This is slow, whatever I do.

If `slack_matrix` is the `slack_matrix` of the `polytopes.associahedron(['A', 9])` obtained e.g. with

```
sage: def get_slack(P):
....:     self = P
....:     Vrep_matrix = matrix(self.base_ring(), self.Vrepresentation())
....:     Hrep_matrix = matrix(self.base_ring(), self.Hrepresentation())
....:     hom_helper = matrix(self.base_ring(), [1 if v.is_vertex() else 0 for v
....:  in self.Vrepresentation()])
....:     hom_Vrep = hom_helper.stack(Vrep_matrix.transpose())
....:     slack_matrix = (Hrep_matrix * hom_Vrep).transpose()
....:     return slack_matrix

sage: slack_matrix = get_slack(polytopes.associahedron(['A', 9])
```


than the solution of this ticket needs about 15 ms. In comparison to


```
sage: %time incidence_matrix = M.apply_map(lambda y: not y, R=M.base_ring())
CPU times: user 281 ms, sys: 15.8 ms, total: 296 ms
Wall time: 296 ms
```


(which is 100 ms slower than the trivial `lambda y: y`).

For the `x = 1 - x`, I was thinking the matrix was already a 01 matrix (and perhaps you were trying to do it in-place). This is also slower than simply doing this?

```python
        cdef Py_ssize_t i, j
        for i from 0 <= i < self._nrows:
            for j from 0 <= j < self._ncols:
                if not self.get_unsafe(i, j):
                    M.set_unsafe_si(i, j, 1)
```

This is more generic, but perhaps it is slower for special cases (e.g., rationals) because it goes partially through Python.

I have some questions:

Should this be lifted up to a generic matrix method with a generic implementation of `get_is_zero_unsafe`?

Do you want to be an integer matrix or a mod2 matrix? The latter seems like it would be more memory efficient and possibly faster.

I am not sure it is safe to assume the initialized matrix is 0. Is this documented somewhere?

Good point. It is documented that the entries are not initialized.

So the following would be better:

```
cdef Matrix_integer_dense M = self._new(self._nrows, self._ncols)
cdef Py_ssize_t i, j
    for i from 0 <= i < self._nrows:
        for j from 0 <= j < self._ncols:
            if self.get_is_zero_unsafe(i, j):
                M.set_unsafe_si(i, j, 1)
            else:
                M.set_unsafe_si(i, j, 0)
```


For integers the difference between `if not self.get_unsafe(i, j)` and `if get_is_zero_unsafe(i, j)` is a factor of three. For rationals the difference is a factor of about 20.

I don't find an example of a matrix with base ring not a ring. It is mentioned in the constructor that such things exists, but I can't find it. Can you help me out?

We could have another optional argument, where you specify what you want to fill the matrix with, if not ones.

As for other rings I think I have questions with all of them:

- `gfpn` is `get_unsafe_int` guaranteed to be `0` if the entry is zero, or might it be `0` mod cardinality of field, if not, where do I find the cardinality?
- similar for `gf2e` and `modn`
- `cyclo` (I just realized this is probably easy)

EDIT:

For `gf2e` this is indirectly confirmed in `rings/finite_rings/element_givaro.pyx` in `fetch_int`.

Okay, this is an implementation for all of the specialized dense matrices I mentioned before.

I really don't like how in the gf2e it redirects through python for such a key feature with `get_unsafe`. This needs to be removed and is now #29853. Likely the way to do it will be based on what is done for gfpn.

Some additions of better `__bool__` methods:

```
sage: K.<z> = CyclotomicField(3)
sage: A = matrix(K, 4, 3, [0, -z, -2, -2*z + 2, 2*z, z, z, 1-z, 2+3*z, z, 1+z, 0])
sage: %timeit bool(A)
10000000 loops, best of 5: 86.2 ns per loop
sage: %timeit bool(Z)
10000000 loops, best of 5: 152 ns per loop
```

versus before:

```
sage: %timeit bool(A)
The slowest run took 70.37 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 5: 8.49 µs per loop
sage: Z = matrix(K, 4, 3, 0)
sage: %timeit bool(Z)
The slowest run took 7.43 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 5: 50 µs per loop
```


I also made changes in other places where `get_is_unsafe_zero()` could be used. Like the above and in your use case, this likely has (potentially significantly) sped things up.

Okay, that takes care of the sparse matrices and symbolic matrices.
