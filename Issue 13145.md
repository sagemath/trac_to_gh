Hey Mike,

Why doesn't `GenericCombinatorialSpecies` just inherit from `UniqueRepresentation`, and have just one`__classcall__()` there (as I recall, this works fine with inheritance, but you can override this as necessary)? If you keep the current code structure, I would move the caching tests in `__init__()` to the respective `__classcall__()` as tests.

Also, I recommend the formatting:

```
Returns the species of singletons.

This species has exactly one structure on a set of size `n`.
It is the same (and is implemented)  as ``CharacteristicSpecies(1)``.
```

for the `__init__()` methods.

Finally (and more trivial), trailing whitespace.

Thank you,

Travis

It rather should be


```
Returns the species of singletons.

This species has exactly one structure on a set of size `1`.
It is the same (and is implemented)  as ``CharacteristicSpecies(1)``.
```

I have removed the trailing whitespaces. There remains to add doc to the classcall functions.

Simon King noticed that the author and reviewer are the same on this patch. Is this legal?
