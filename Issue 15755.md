2to3 changed 4 affected .py modules.

I have not found a way to identify the relevant backtick usages (too many backticks in comments and doc-test):
* .pyx modules may be affected. But cython is said to be Python 3 enabled, so that should be no problem.
* If there backticks in doc-tests they will be found during tests in a Python 3 environment.

Apparently the automerge fails. How to locate the conflicting parts?

I did 

```
git merge u/chapoton/15991 u/wluebbe/ticket/15986 u/wluebbe/ticket/15987
}}} 
on top of `u/wluebbe/ticket/15992` (which is rebased on `6.2.beta5`)

Test report:
{{{
./sage -t -p --all --long --logfile=logs/ptestlong-alle4.log
...
All tests passed!
}}}

Here is a reviewer branch. I have taken the opportunity to make small changes in the close nieghborhood of the modified code, and to add some doctests.

If you agree with my changes, you can set this to positive review.

Eeek, I'm surprised I've never noticed that not raising an error message in NCSF. I agree with the changes, so positive review.
