Some bikeshedding on the module-level doc:

```
Let `P_{\Theta_n, X_n}` be the polynomial ring in two sets of variables
`\Theta_n = \theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_n` and
`X_n = x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n`
```
The "n" here clashes with the "n" in the later definitions of p_{n;} et al; maybe use a capital N instead? Or work with infinitely many variables right away, if this is possible?

```
where the first set of variables anti-commute
```
If this includes squaring to 0, then please say so.

```
The symmetric group
acts diagonally on this polynomial ring and the symmetric functions in
superspace are isomorphic to the invariants in this polynomial ring.
```
I'd put a comma before the "and" so it's not misread as "on this polynomial ring and the symmetric functions".

```
    p_{(;i)} p_{(;j)} = p_{(;j)} p_{(;i)} \qquad
    p_{(i;)} p_{(;j)} = p_{(;j)} p_{(i;)} \qquad
    p_{(i;)} p_{(j;)} = - p_{(j;)} p_{(i;)}
```
And `p_{(i;)}^2 = 0`, I assume.

```
    p_{(; n)} = p_n \quad e_{(; n)} = e_n \quad h_{(; n)} = h_n
```
Please use `, \quad`, not just `\quad`.

```
from `Theta_n`
```
Don't forget the backslash. (And again, that's an "N", not an "n".)

```
bosnic degree
```
The adjective is "Bosnian".

```
    h_{(n; )} = \sum_{\Lambda \in SPar(n|1)} m_\Lambda \qquad
```
Again, use a comma before the \qquad.

```
`\left<\left< p_\Lambda, p_\Gamma \right>\right> = \delta_{\Lambda\Gamma} z_{\Lambda^s}`
where `z_{\Lambda^s}` is the usual constant `z_\lambda` which is the size of
```
What is `\Lambda^s`?

```
in pairs.  For all `\Lambda, \Gamma in SPar(n|m)` ,
```
`in` -> `\in`

```
As with the space of symmetric functions, there is an involution `\omega`
that for all super partitions `\Lambda`, `\omega(h_\Lambda) = e_\Lambda`.
```
add "satisfies".

```
Hopf algebra and the coproduct is defined bby declaring that the power sum
```
"by".

I don't quite get: How is `e_\Lambda` defined for a strict partition \Lambda? Just by multiplying `e_{n;}` over all fermionic entries `n` and `e_{;n}` over all bosonic entries `n`? In what order?

You are right the descriptions were confused there.  The Schur-star and Schur-star-bar are related to these by duality and I looked in the paper and noticed that they are not listed as a specialization so I cut that description.

That would be welcome.  Here they are implemented by Pieri rules which are given in [JL2016].

What does that mean?

What is a BindableClass (no, I don't get the doc at https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/misc/sage/misc/bindable_class.html ) and why is it being used here?

```
+where `\Lambda` is a super partition with femionic sector `m`.

Is this a Hopf algebra or a super-Hopf algebra? I.e., is there a twist involved in the bialgebra axiom? My suspicion is that it is, because otherwise the square-zero relations `p_{(i;)}^2 = 0` would contradict the primitivity of the `p_{(i;)}` wrt the coproduct. But do you ever tell this to Sage? If you don't, I doubt that it's correctly computing coproducts of non-generators! Also, of course, this should be said in the doc. (Is the Hopf structure anywhere in the literature?)

```

```
Probably should be "if the super-partitions in the support of ``self`` have the same bi-degree".

Maybe decide between "symmetric generators" and "bosonic generators" -- currently you seem to be using both languages (or do they mean different things?).

You are probably not testing enough. The error should materialize when you take the coproduct of a product of p_{n;}s. Basically, the coproduct of p_{n;}p_{m;} should switch signs if you swap n with m; but if I compute it naively in a Hopf algebra, I get

p_{n;} p_{m;} \otimes 1 + p_{n;} \otimes p_{m;} + p_{m;} \otimes p_{n;} + 1 \otimes p_{n;} p_{m;},

which does not swap signs.
