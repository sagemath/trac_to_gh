Keywords: diagram algebra

The current implementation works by constructing a graph and using the connected components of that. Not only does this create (complicated) transient objects, it is all done in Python. This provides a direct implementation in Cython.

I get a ~5x speedup with the current implementation. With branch:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: P = PartitionAlgebra(4, x)
sage: P1 = P[[1],[-1],[2,3],[4,-2],[-3,-4]]
sage: P2 = P[[1],[2,-2],[3,4],[-1,-3],[-4]]
sage: P3 = P.one()
sage: %timeit P1 * P2
10000 loops, best of 3: 32.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit P2 * P1
10000 loops, best of 3: 33.6 µs per loop
sage: %timeit P1 * P3
10000 loops, best of 3: 32.6 µs per loop
sage: %timeit P3 * P1
10000 loops, best of 3: 31.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit P2 * P3
10000 loops, best of 3: 32.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit P3 * P2
10000 loops, best of 3: 32.8 µs per loop
```

vs before:

```
sage: %timeit P1 * P2
10000 loops, best of 3: 150 µs per loop
sage: %timeit P2 * P1
10000 loops, best of 3: 145 µs per loop
sage: %timeit P1 * P3
10000 loops, best of 3: 143 µs per loop
sage: %timeit P3 * P1
10000 loops, best of 3: 142 µs per loop
sage: %timeit P2 * P3
10000 loops, best of 3: 144 µs per loop
sage: %timeit P3 * P2

This is really nice.  I ran the doctests and all passes.
I tried multiplying a few elements in the wild (not single diagrams, but linear combinations) and I see ~2x speedup in total at n=3.

Thank you for doing the review.

I think the linear combination code starts becoming the time sink. Unfortunately I don't see how to speed that part up. `:/` Yet, it is very good to see that it still is getting a ~2x speed improvement.
