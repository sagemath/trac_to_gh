The current implementation of the global function `parent()` is:

```
cpdef inline parent(x):
    if isinstance(x, Element):
        return (<Element>x)._parent
    # Fast check for "number" types, including int and float
    if PyNumber_Check(x):
        return type(x)
    try:
        p = x.parent
    except AttributeError:
        return type(x)
    else:
        return p()
```

It turns out that the non-`Element` case is sufficiently slow to cause an important slow-down, as observed in #23905.

In some of those cases, there are probably better names than `parent` but were initially chosen to have compatibility of sorts with Sage's framework. Anyways, I doubt it would cause a problem in any private code.
