At [this location](http://sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/plot/plot.html#sage.plot.plot.plot) and maybe also at the top of that page, seems that we might want to reference the `ymin` and `ymax` keywords, see for instance [this sage-edu thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-edu/browse_thread/thread/f39196314bd2adcf).  

In general, we probably could use more help on finding some of the `show` keywords from `plot`, but maybe having all of them is too busy... or is it?  Maybe we even need a whole different page for introducing 2d plots.  That would be a different ticket, but a bit of discussion welcome here.

I think we can add ymin, ymax to the plot documentation and then put a reference to [show](http://sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/plot/graphics.html#sage.plot.graphics.Graphics.show) from the plot function. 2D plots are already in their own page and I think it is not really needed to split them up further.

I had opened #13368 to track this. I can't touch this unless I have more time. It will be a fairly intrusive change to enable xmin/xmax from plot, with lots of opportunity for breakage.
