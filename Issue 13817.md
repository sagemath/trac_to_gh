At [this location](http://sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/plot/plot.html#sage.plot.plot.plot) and maybe also at the top of that page, seems that we might want to reference the `ymin` and `ymax` keywords, see for instance [this sage-edu thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-edu/browse_thread/thread/f39196314bd2adcf).  

In general, we probably could use more help on finding some of the `show` keywords from `plot`, but maybe having all of them is too busy... or is it?  Maybe we even need a whole different page for introducing 2d plots.  That would be a different ticket, but a bit of discussion welcome here.

I think we can add ymin, ymax to the plot documentation and then put a reference to [show](http://sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/plot/graphics.html#sage.plot.graphics.Graphics.show) from the plot function. 2D plots are already in their own page and I think it is not really needed to split them up further. Yes, the page is long and crowded, but any plotting method will be so because of the huge amount of customization possible.

Some other time we may want to revisit the xmin versus horizontal min issue - but not here.  Nice work.

See #14083 for some other minor improvements to this file.

I had opened #13368 to track this. I can't touch this unless I have more time. It will be a fairly intrusive change to enable xmin/xmax from plot, with lots of opportunity for breakage.
