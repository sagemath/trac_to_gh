Spotted on sage-on-gentoo but could happen anywhere:

```
sage -t --long /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage/tests/gap_packages.py
**********************************************************************
File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage/tests/gap_packages.py", line 104, in sage.tests.gap_packages.all_installed_packages
Failed example:
    all_installed_packages()
Expected:
    (...'GAPDoc',...)
Got:
    ('AtlasRep', 'GAPDoc')
```

I have `AtlasRep` installed in `~/.gap/pkg/` which is one of the standard place for installing `gap` packages. It looks like the tests fails if there is more than one package and `GAPDoc` is the last one.
Fix is trivial.
