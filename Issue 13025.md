# Issue 13025: make setuptools actually respect the --egg-path argument

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13197

Currently if you specify the egg-path when using setuptools' `setup.py develop`, it still places the absolute path in `easy_install.pth`. This causes issues with relocation. Currently this only affects the sage notebook (which works around it by using a sed command), but with #13190 it will also affect the sage library. Since the `easy_install.pth` file is regenerated whenever setuptools detects that it needs to be, trying to use sed commands to work around this issue is unrealistic.

I've attached an spkg which includes a work in progress patch that I intend to submit upstream once finished. It is currently functional for our purposes, hence the needs review.

Ok, I updated it with the actual patch I'm going to submit upstream, so there should be no hesitation on reviewing it now. Same URL.

CCing myself since we should remove the sed stuff from the sagenb installer once this is in.

What's the status here?  No branch, for instance, though setuptools in Sage is now at 12.4.
