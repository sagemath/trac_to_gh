# Issue 17006: connect bubble sort graph and permutahedron

So we have the [permutahedron](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/geometry/sage/geometry/polyhedron/library.html#sage.geometry.polyhedron.library.Polytopes.permutahedron) and we have the [bubble sort graph](https://mvngu.googlecode.com/hg/onepage/sage/graphs/graph_generators/sage.graphs.graph_generators.GraphGenerators.BubbleSortGraph.html).  But the BSG is the skeleton of the P.  So at least in the documentation these should be connected.

Changing keywords from "" to "beginner".

From #7277 - maybe whenever this is done the symmetry group should also be mentioned in both contexts.

The `vertex_graph` (or perhaps also #17474 digraph) would be useful in this documentation too.

Seems good on the face of it!  (Haven't run tests or built doc yet.)

Do you think that would be possible as well?

sage/graphs/graph_generators.py also could have a ref, esp. since that is where one is sent.  Note that src/sage/graphs/generators/families.py apparently isn't in the reference manual (though see #18160-#18170 or so in case it's in one of those).

(Otherwise this is just fine!  Thanks.)

Hello,

Will certainly conflicts with #18213. Could you set it as a dependency?

As #18213 is positively reviewed, this one definitely needs a rebase.

You could also make the link appear directly in the documentation

```
    The bubble sort graph is the underlying graph of the
    :meth:`~sage.geometry.polyhedron.library.Polytopes.permutahedron`.
```

Hyperlinks are cool inside the doc as well.

Hi,

The documentation is indeed much better!

And I would put the following inside `EXAMPLES` and not `TESTS`

```
sage: perm4 = polytopes.permutahedron(4)
sage: perm4.graph().is_isomorphic(graphs.BubbleSortGraph(4))
True
```

It is nice to show how to play with these. Usually, I put in `TESTS` only things that are of no interest like

```
sage: for i in range(n):
....:     M = MyObject(i)
....:     assert M.one_way() == M.other_way()
```

or checking ouptut type, or testing some crazy input arguments.

This is too much repetitions for me

```
In total, `B(n)` has order `n!`. Thus, the order
of `B(n)` increases according to `f(n) = n!`. 
```

```
+        vertices of the polyhedron, and edges to edges, we get the
+        :meth:`~sage.graphs.graph_generators.GraphGenerators.BubbleSortGraph`.
         INPUT:
```

Probably there should be a blank line between these?

Comment by kcrisman created at 2015-04-22 19:27:03

In terms of info this is indeed a great improvement, for the record, thanks!

I'm going to assume that it is indeed multiplication on the right and not the left - which one is which for permutations always forces me to sit down and write out an example.

Finally,

```
+    by an elemantary transposition in the
```

should be `elementary`.

Looks good to me. It is very nice to have crossed links in the documentation!

There were potentially more comments from Karl-Dieter. Let say that 32 hours is enough ;-)

Well, I note that [comment:16 one of my comments] wasn't fulfilled.  But no doubt Volker is already nearly merging this as we speak... does the built doc look okay?

There is a blankline. Which version are you looking at? (and the documentation looks fine).

Vincent

Comment by kcrisman created at 2015-04-24 18:13:15

Not sure which version I saw that in, and the total diff looks fine.

I wanted to correct the blank line thing but could not find it. I may have deleted it without noticing.

This failure, which should be rather easy to fix, has nothing whatsoever to do with this branch. Some other branch has changed the docstring for `is_prime` in `src/sage/rings/integer.pyx` and this is the fallout.

EDIT: And by "some other branch" I mean a branch not yet in develop, as the test runs fine for me. Please check your merge!
