As #18213 is positively reviewed, this one definitely needs a rebase.

Hi,

The documentation is indeed much better!

And I would put the following inside `EXAMPLES` and not `TESTS`

```
sage: perm4 = polytopes.permutahedron(4)
sage: perm4.graph().is_isomorphic(graphs.BubbleSortGraph(4))
True
```

It is nice to show how to play with these. Usually, I put in `TESTS` only things that are of no interest like

```
sage: for i in range(n):
....:     M = MyObject(i)
....:     assert M.one_way() == M.other_way()
```

or checking ouptut type, or testing some crazy input arguments.

This is too much repetitions for me

```
In total, `B(n)` has order `n!`. Thus, the order
of `B(n)` increases according to `f(n) = n!`. 
```

I'm going to assume that it is indeed multiplication on the right and not the left - which one is which for permutations always forces me to sit down and write out an example.

Finally,

```

Failed example:

Expected:
       Test whether "self" is prime.
    ...
       IMPLEMENTATION: Calls the PARI "isprime" function.
    <BLANKLINE>
Got:
       Test whether "self" is prime.
    <BLANKLINE>
       INPUT:
    <BLANKLINE>
       * "proof" -- Boolean or "None" (default). If False, use a strong
         pseudo-primality test (see "is_pseudoprime()"). If True, use a
         provable primality test.  If unset, use the "default arithmetic
         proof flag".
    <BLANKLINE>
       Note: Integer primes are by definition *positive*! This is
         different than Magma, but the same as in PARI. See also the
         "is_irreducible()" method.

       When starting Sage the arithmetic proof flag is True. We can change

This failure, which should be rather easy to fix, has nothing whatsoever to do with this branch. Some other branch has changed the docstring for `is_prime` in `src/sage/rings/integer.pyx` and this is the fallout.

EDIT: And by "some other branch" I mean a branch not yet in develop, as the test runs fine for me. Please check your merge!
