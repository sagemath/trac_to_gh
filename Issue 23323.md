I didn't have much time to look at the code yet, but I did notice some inconsistencies with the copyright statements. One of the files has a 2013 copyright date. Can you fix that, Travis?

Also, you should add your name to the copyright statements as well. You've put in a lot of work integrating the code into the category framework! Thanks for doing this, I really appreciate it.

I have looked over the three new files, and will do more tests later. For now, here are the typos/documentation errors I noticed:

Please correct the documentation in type_super_A.py (line 365). Remove the last clause, and perhaps indicate that "self" is a root:


``` 
def associated_coroot(self):
            """                                                                                                
            Return the coroot associated to ``self``, which is                                                 
            precisely ``self``.  
```


and a small typo “if positive if” -> “if positive is” in type_super_A.py (line 409):


```
If positive if ``True``, tests if it is on the strict positive                                 
side instead.
```


In bkk_crystals.py (line 35), suggest changing "super Lie algebra" to "Lie superalgebra" in:


```

I think it is okay not to mention it as it does not have to strictly be a root.
