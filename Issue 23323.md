I didn't have much time to look at the code yet, but I did notice some inconsistencies with the copyright statements. One of the files has a 2013 copyright date. Can you fix that, Travis?

Also, you should add your name to the copyright statements as well. You've put in a lot of work integrating the code into the category framework! Thanks for doing this, I really appreciate it.

Fixed. Sorry about the copyright statements. I was doing them mostly on autopilot as a placeholder to get back to them later when finalizing stuff. However, it is better to do them now and get them correct.

Thank you for writing the initial code and letting us use it.

I have looked over the three new files, and will do more tests later. For now, here are the typos/documentation errors I noticed:

Please correct the documentation in type_super_A.py (line 365). Remove the last clause, and perhaps indicate that "self" is a root:


``` 
def associated_coroot(self):
            """                                                                                                
            Return the coroot associated to ``self``, which is                                                 
            precisely ``self``.  
```


and a small typo “if positive if” -> “if positive is” in type_super_A.py (line 409):


```
If positive if ``True``, tests if it is on the strict positive                                 
side instead.
```


In bkk_crystals.py (line 35), suggest changing "super Lie algebra" to "Lie superalgebra" in:


```
class CrystalOfBKKTableaux(CrystalOfWords):

    r"""                                                                                                                                      
    Crystal of tableaux for type `A(m|n)`.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
    This is an implementation of the tableaux model of the                                                                                    
    Benkart-Kang-Kashiwara crystal [BKK2000]_ for the super                                                                                   
    Lie algebra `\mathfrak{gl}(m+1,n+1)`.
```

Replying to [comment:45 brubaker]:

I think it is okay not to mention it as it does not have to strictly be a root.

I fixed each of the other things.

I ran additional tests. Everything seems to be working well!
