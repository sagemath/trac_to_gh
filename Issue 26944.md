# Issue 26944: py3: fix doctest in generic_graph (part 4)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27181

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2019-01-31 12:47:33

Keywords: py3, graph

Fix doctests in:
- `vertex_boundary`. We now sort the output in the doctest
- `neighbor_iterator`: again this is due to the use of `set` in `_backend.iterator_nbrs` leading to different orderings in py2 and py3. We change the example to a more stable one
- `degree`: we mark doctests as py2 and py3
- `degree_iterator`: we mark doctests as py2 and py3

ok, ok. I am slightly worried by the proliferation of  #py2 / #py3 tags, but agree that once we tried hard to do otherwise, it's ok.
