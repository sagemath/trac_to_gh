Keywords: cythonize

In #17851 cycache was necessarily disabled. This now leads to recythonizing everything when only the cython version **number was touched** (e.g. by checking out an old branch followed by merging develop). Ideally, cythonizing everything should only happen if the cython binary is different when compared to the last cythonizing.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18256

This was already reported upstream in #17851. We should not have a Sage specific solution for that! Of course we would have to set again the cache once this will be fixed upstream...

If the Cython version number was touched, it means that Cython really changed (otherwise, we wouldn't have changed the Cython version number...). So I don't really understand the issue.

Maybe I'm stupid but somewhere the dependencies are described, e.g., in a Makefile or other config, which trigger the complete build. Instead, you trigger it when the version string changes, not when the timestamp changes. This results in identical behaviour on upgrade, but spares full recythonize when I do an old branch checkout followed by develop merge.

> a full recythonize is triggered.
Are you sure it's really a full recythonize and not just a rebuild of all files depending on a common file like `src/ext/interrupt.pxi`? It's true that Cython (just like `make`) uses timestamps to trigger rebuilds, so if the timestamp of `src/ext/interrupt.pxi` changes, then all Cython extensions depending on that (i.e. almost all of them) would be recythonized.

If this is the problem, I would like to close this ticket as `wontfix` since it's a feature, not a bug, to use timestamps for dependency checking. And even if it would be a bug, it's in upstream Cython, not Sage.
