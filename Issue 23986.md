CC:  chapoton jdemeyer

This fixes several (hardly exhaustive) string conversions around Sage such that functions and methods that returned `str` on Python 2 also return `str` on Python 3 (and the same for functions and methods that take `str` as arguments) using the new string utilities from #24222.

This also incorporates/replaces the fixes from #23812.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24223

It seems strange to me to use `locale.getpreferredencoding()` for strings which do not depend on the locale. I would propose:

1. Use `locale.getpreferredencoding()` for strings which actually depend on the locale.

2. Use `sys.getfilesystemencoding()` for strings which actually depend on the file system encoding.

3. Use UTF-8 otherwise.

Interesting--when I added `str_to_bytes` I predicted we might later want to allow Python 2 `unicode` objects to be supported somehow, but put it off because I didn't think there was much code in Sage that already was expected to handle `unicode` (except in a few places like unicode art, etc.).  But the tests that are failing here clearly show that there are some places it's expected to work.

So I see at least three options:

1. Modify `str_to_bytes` to treat `unicode` appropriate on Python 2
2. Add some new function like `unicode_to_str` that's analogous to `str_to_bytes` (I'm not crazy about this)
3. Just special case `unicode` on Python 2 where we do want to support it.

I lean towards 1. but I'm open to ideas.

I always find it a bit unpleasant to review tickets with non-merged dependencies. So I would rather wait until the next beta.

Two immediate issues that I see:

1. In `src/sage/libs/mpmath/utils.pyx` you add an import that you don't use.

2. In several files, you `import` stuff from `sage.cpython.string` where you could use `cimport`.

This does not work:

`FS_ENCODING` is can't be cimported.
