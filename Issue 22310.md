It seems I created this in error while trying to get git trac to work.

FYI - Tickets like this can be set immediately to positive review (after being marked invalid).

Closing tickets in the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix module with positive_review (i.e. someone has confirmed they should be closed).
