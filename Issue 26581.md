# Issue 26581: R package has a dependency on zlib not listed in dependencies

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26818

Building the development version of Sage on my cluster failed at configuration of R because the system zlib is < 1.2.5. I added 'zlib' to the dependencies of the package and cofiguration worked.
