`PLOT` part of docstrings has two problems.

First is just `\n`:


```
g=text("Hello\nworld!")
sphinx_plot(g)
```


gives an error. Another is `graphics_array`. One just can not say for example


```
P=Poset(...)
g1=P.plot()
g2=P.ordinal_product(P).plot
g=graphics_array([g1, g2])
sphinx_plot(g)
```


as `graphics_array` has no `.plot()` function. Maybe there is something that can be done for these.

A point `(x,y)` is missing in `text()`. It should be like `text("Hello\nworld!", (1,1))`
