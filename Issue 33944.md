As reported in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/FezzF5Q7Wt4/m/TJG8jQyAAQAJ, scripts with old shebang lines may leak into new venvs.

In the reported case, this happened in a build `--without-system-python3` on updating from Python 3.10.3 to 3.10.5, but this could also happen when `--with-sage-venv=/SOME/GIVEN/PATH` is used.

An easy way to fix it is to just delete the cache `pkgs/sagemath-standard/build/scripts*` at the beginning of `build/pkgs/sagelib/spkg-install`. Regenerating the scripts probably does not have a noticeable performance penalty

By the way, in your case the issue was provoked because `configure --without-system-python3 --with-sage-venv` chooses a venv directory that's keyed to the full version number (`.../venv-python3.10.5`), whereas the setuptools build cache is keyed only to major and minor version (`scripts-3.10`).

Thanks!

I am not explicitly using the --with-sage-venv option but it is evidently on by default.

It will not be so easy to recreate my previous directory state.  I will try to test somehow, though.
