Actually there is still the issue why you don't get the help with `?`:

```
sage: x.coefficient?
sage: (x+1).coefficient?
Object `coefficient` not found.
sage: (x+1).n?
...this works...

If anything I'm surprised that `(x+1).n?` works: typically `obj.foo?` only works reliably if `obj` is a variable, and either raises an error or returns nonsense otherwise. For instance:

```
sage: (x.variables()).n?
Signature:      n(x, prec=None, digits=None, algorithm=None)
Docstring:
   Returns a numerical approximation of an object "x" with at least
   "prec" bits (or decimal "digits") of precision.
...
sage: (x.variables()).n()
...
AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'n'

The `?` parsing is done by IPython, Sage is not involved in this. So this isn't a Sage bug, which is sufficient reason to close this.
