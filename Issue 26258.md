# Issue 26258: Py3 : Fix doctests in module tests/french_book

Issue created by migration from Trac.

For frenchbook doctests errors i chose to use doctest flag `# py2` instead of rewriting the examples.

As the tests are supposed to be the examples of the book i think it's more consistant to just skip them in python 3 rather than rewrite them and have examples which differ form the book.

The remaining doctests errors does not depends on this "module".

thank you for adding me in cc

Note however that `tests/french_book` is currently being updated with #23572,
thus it would be better to apply this patch after #23572 (for which reviewers are welcome).

I suggest that we should positive-review this one and keep other failures for another ticket. See also #26792

Ok. Looks good to me. I give positive review to the last three commits.
Frederic you set this ticket in positive review if you validate commit `57bdc26`
