# Issue 17949: Add cardinality() to MatrixSpace

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18186

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2015-04-14 10:48:48

For example `MatrixSpace(GF(2), 3, 4).cardinality()` should return `2^(3*4)`, and matrix spaces over inifinite rings should return `Infinity`. Also `MatrixSpace(GF(3),4,5) in FiniteSets()` should return `True`.

For the second point I would modify the constructor (i.e. the `__init__` method) with the following just before the call to `Parent.__init__`:

```
if self.__nrows == 0 and self.__ncols == 0:
    is_finite = True
else:
    is_finite = None
    try:
        is_finite = base_ring.is_finite()
    except (AttributeError,NotImplementedError):
        pass

if is_finite is True:
    category = category.Finite()
elif is_finite is False:
    category = category.Infinite()
```

Let's try a 'or' instead `:-P`


```
sage: MatrixSpace(GF(2),0,3)
Full MatrixSpace of 0 by 3 dense matrices over Finite Field of size 2
```

Uh, I just don't understand. `foo in bar` means `bar.__contains__(foo)`. Where is `__contains__` defined for `FiniteSets`? Someone else to do this?
