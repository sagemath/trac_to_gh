Get rid of `include_dirs = singular_incs` in `setup.py` to enable easier packaging for Nix/Guix/hashdist-style distros.

Not sure why it worked for me... testing again after `make distclean; make`

Apparently, some Singular `Makefile` actually rewrites the include path from the correct to the wrong path. I added a Singular patch to remove one `sed` command fixing the issue. This now works even after `make distclean`.

Thanks for figuring this out :)
To bad that we have to patch Singular but their build is just broken it seems.
