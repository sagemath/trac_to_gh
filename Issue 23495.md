I have looked a bit into this, and I could not find a place where this package actually enhances the sage library so this would just be a package that is easy to install in sage the distribution. However I don't really see what the reason is to have this package in "sage the distribution" without some easy user accecible way to generate fancy movies out of sage output. So one solution might even be to remove this from the optional packages and make it into an experimental one.

Does either of you agree with this? If so I will ask on sage-devel if people agree with this.
