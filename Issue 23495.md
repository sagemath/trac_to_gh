An optional package failing to _build_ should in general not be a blocker, unless maybe if it is a recent regression. I only said that optional packages causing _doctest failures_ (or more general breakage) should be blockers.

I have looked a bit into this, and I could not find a place where this package actually enhances the sage library so this would just be a package that is easy to install in sage the distribution. However I don't really see what the reason is to have this package in "sage the distribution" without some easy user accecible way to generate fancy movies out of sage output. So one solution might even be to remove this from the optional packages and make it into an experimental one.

Does either of you agree with this? If so I will ask on sage-devel if people agree with this.

Aditionally the ticket where this package was added #7297 does not provide a good motivation about why it should be added.

Proposal: downgrade to experimental

Here a trivial patch performing the downgrade. It can already be reviewed from a technical point of view. But this ticket should only be given positive review after the consensus on [the sage-devel topic I opened for this](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/olOxh1f6-cc) is that it is indeed ok to downgrade this package to experimental:
