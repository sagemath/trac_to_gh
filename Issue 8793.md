The documentation doesn't even build correctly:

```
dochtml.log:[logic    ] /mazur/release/merger/sage-5.11.rc0/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/logic/boolformula.py:docstring of sage.logic.boolformula:6: WARNING: Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

Why end lines with

```
.::
```


I think these would be rendered as `.:`

You probably want

```
. ::
```

ok, here is patch that makes sure that the doc build.

It also changes `.::` into `. ::`

It also remove _self_ from the input in most functions

It also makes the code in pep8 standard

Needs review.
