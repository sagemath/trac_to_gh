Well, thank for for fixing that. But shouldn't you rename the file to `.p1` instead ? I honestly don't know, I just assumed that "no number" behaves like `.p0` `:-)`

(And if this turns out to be the right thing to do, you would unfortunately have to update the SPKG.txt file again too... `^^;`)

Strange. I can't reproduce this. I redownloaded the spkg file:



```
/tmp$ sage --pkg buckygen-1.0.p1
Creating Sage package from buckygen-1.0.p1

Created package buckygen-1.0.p1.spkg.

Please test this package using

   sage -f buckygen-1.0.p1.spkg

immediately.  Also, note that you can use

   sage -pkg_nc buckygen-1.0.p1

to make an uncompressed version of the package (useful if the
package is full of compressed data).

Helloooooooooo !

I asked Aladin to do it on his computer and there is no problem there. Though it fails with mine. Let's say it's because I run a git version of Sage.
