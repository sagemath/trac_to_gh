# Issue 14836: Wrong program name in license section of SPKG.txt for the buckygen package

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: nvcleemp

Original creation time: 2013-08-21 12:47:04

I copied that SPKG.txt from Cliquer, but apparently forgot to change that section. A corrected version is available at this URL: â€‹http://users.ugent.be/~nvcleemp/buckygen-1.0.p0.spkg

Gloops `:-P`

Well, thank for for fixing that. But shouldn't you rename the file to `.p1` instead ? I honestly don't know, I just assumed that "no number" behaves like `.p0` `:-)`

(And if this turns out to be the right thing to do, you would unfortunately have to update the SPKG.txt file again too... `^^;`)

Hmm, hateful how grading exams always takes much longer than you would like it to. Finally found some time to change it to p1.

Sorry to bother again, but the name of the .spkg file (buckygen-1.0.p1.spkg) should be consistent with the version in the `SPKG.txt` file (buckygen-1.0.p0). The easiest fix here is to change `SPKG.txt` (don't forget to `hg commit`).

Also, the standard Changelog format is

```
### buckygen-1.0.p1 (Nico Van Cleemput, 3rd September 2013)
```

with the name in the parentheses.

Sorry, I just moved abroad and haven't had that much time to work on this. I'll get to it one of the next days.

Hmmmmmmmm `O_o`

I can't really tell why, but there seems to be an error when running `sage -pkg` :


```
/tmp$ sage -pkg buckygen-1.0.p1
Creating Sage package from buckygen-1.0.p1

Created package buckygen-1.0.p1.spkg.

    NAME: buckygen
 VERSION: 1.0.p1
    SIZE: 66K
 HG REPO: Error reading repository
SPKG.txt: Good
```

Strange. I can't reproduce this. I redownloaded the spkg file:



```
/tmp$ sage --pkg buckygen-1.0.p1
Creating Sage package from buckygen-1.0.p1

Created package buckygen-1.0.p1.spkg.

    NAME: buckygen
 VERSION: 1.0.p1
    SIZE: 66K
 HG REPO: Good
SPKG.txt: Good

Please test this package using

   sage -f buckygen-1.0.p1.spkg

immediately.  Also, note that you can use

   sage -pkg_nc buckygen-1.0.p1

to make an uncompressed version of the package (useful if the
package is full of compressed data).

```

Helloooooooooo !

I asked Aladin to do it on his computer and there is no problem there. Though it fails with mine. Let's say it's because I run a git version of Sage.
