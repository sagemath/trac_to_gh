Well, thank for for fixing that. But shouldn't you rename the file to `.p1` instead ? I honestly don't know, I just assumed that "no number" behaves like `.p0` `:-)`

(And if this turns out to be the right thing to do, you would unfortunately have to update the SPKG.txt file again too... `^^;`)

Please test this package using

immediately.  Also, note that you can use

   sage -pkg_nc buckygen-1.0.p1

to make an uncompressed version of the package (useful if the
