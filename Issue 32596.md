The only thing I am not so sure about, which is more of a bikeshedding thing, is the output for `construction := ...` not being displayed in more "human readable" indented blocks (at least for the doctest output).

I do not know how to ask gap for a better display. 

`.PrintObj()` and `.PrintString()` give even worse results.

I am not sure it is worth spending more time on that thing, which cannot be converted to sage anyway.
