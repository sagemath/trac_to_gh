As reported on [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/38449/how-to-get-sage-80-to-plot-matplotlib-plots-inline-and-typeset-expressions-on-a-jupyter-notebook/), the following shows an image:


```
from numpy import arange, sin, pi
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
X = arange(0.0, 2*pi, 0.01)
plt.plot(X, sin(X))
plt.show()
```


but does not with `%display typeset` or `%display latex`.
