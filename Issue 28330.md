# Issue 28330: allow user to specify strategy for Groebner basis computations with Macaulay2

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28567

Original creator: saliola

Original creation time: 2019-10-06 17:42:24

CC:  dimpase @mwageringel @antonleykin

Keywords: macaulay2, interfaces, groebner basis

The `groebner_basis` method for an ideal in a polynomial ring can be computed using the default Groebner basis command in Macaulay2. Here we extend the functionality by allowing the user to specify the strategy to be used by Macaulay2.

I have changed the examples in the doctests, so that the Macaulay2 `F4` and `MGB` algorithms are executed over a finite field, and also changed a small sphinx formatting problem. If you agree with my changes, you can set this to positive.

Sorry about that. Sometimes it is hard to see the relevant failures in the patchbot results.
