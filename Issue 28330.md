Keywords: macaulay2, interfaces, groebner basis

The `groebner_basis` method for an ideal in a polynomial ring can be computed using the default Groebner basis command in Macaulay2. Here we extend the functionality by allowing the user to specify the strategy to be used by Macaulay2. 

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28567
