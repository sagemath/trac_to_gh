Keywords: tree,faces

The graph of order 1 and size 0 is a tree. Euler's formula should apply:

  num_verts - num_edges + num_faces = 2

and in particular, the number of faces of that graphs should be 1.  Currently, `.faces()` returns an empty list and `.num_faces()` returns 0.

I agree that the number of faces of a graph with a single vertex should be 1 according to Euler's formula. However, I don't know which face to return. 


Another issue is the number of faces of graphs with several connected components. Indeed, the Euler's formula is `V-E+F-C=1`, where `C` is the number of connected components (see e.g.,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic#Plane_graphs).
But we have

```
sage: G = graphs.CycleGraph(3) * 2
sage: G.num_faces()
4
sage: V = G.order()
sage: E = G.size()
sage: C = len(G.connected_components())
sage: F = E - V + C + 1
sage: F
3
```

For the single vertex graph, we should just return the "face" of `[]` representing everything.

For disconnected graphs, I suspect the `faces()` algorithm has a hidden assumption of connectedness. It makes it somewhat hard to define what a face is as the sphere remove the interior of the planar graphs is not homeomorphic to a disk anymore. We essentially have to insert some fake edges connecting the connected components in order to get the simplicial (well, CW is sufficient) decomposition for the faces.

Disclaimer: I'm not "defining a face to be...", I'm trying to fix an issue ;)

In method `faces`, an embedding is defined as a clockwise ordering of the neighbors of each vertex.
So, when the graph is planar and that the embedding corresponds to a planar embedding of the graph, a face is a subset of **R**<sup>2</sup> surrounded by edges. However, I think we should distinguish several behaviors of these methods:
- if no embedding is given (or stored in the graph) and that the graph is planar, the method starts computing a planar embedding and then determines it's faces. Actually, for `num_faces`, we don't need the embedding, it is sufficient to know if the graph is planar (and it's number of connected components).
- if no embedding is given (or stored in the graph) and that the graph is **not** planar, then an error is raised
- if an embedding is given as input (or stored in the graph), none of the methods checks if it is a valid embedding of a planar graph. So we can for instance compute the "faces" of a non-planar graph like

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: G.is_planar()
False
sage: embedding = {v: G.neighbors(v) for v in G}
sage: G.faces(embedding)
[[(0, 1),
  (1, 2),
  (2, 3),
  (3, 4),
  (4, 9),
  (9, 6),
  (6, 1),
  (1, 0),
  (0, 4),
  (4, 3),
  (3, 8),
  (8, 5),
  (5, 0)],
 [(0, 5), (5, 7), (7, 9), (9, 4), (4, 0)],
 [(1, 6),
  (6, 8),
  (8, 3),
  (3, 2),
  (2, 7),
  (7, 5),
  (5, 8),
  (8, 6),
  (6, 9),
  (9, 7),
  (7, 2),
  (2, 1)]]
```

  and you can see that the reported faces may have repeated vertices...

I'm not sure what's the best solution here. In particular, we cannot use method `is_planar` to check if a graph is planar based on a combinatorial embedding as method `is_planar` calls method `genus` which itself calls method `faces`.

There needs to be some definition that is compatible with the topological information you want. `:)` If a face is a subset of **R**<sup>2</sup> surrounded by edges, then that is equivalent to comment:6.

For `num_faces()`, would it be faster to check if it is planar and then use Euler's formula solving for `F`? It definitely feels more memory efficient as it won't have to list all of the faces.

In many ways, I think it is okay to define the faces of a non-planar graph because it still lies on some higher genus surface and the definition of a face still makes sense there.

I don't quite see why this is a problem. For a tree, say a star with 3 edges, you would naturally have this anyways.

Right. So if the graph is not planar, any ordering could be used, for instance the one from `G.to_dictionary()`.

Then are we in agreement? We just need some generic way, such as `G.to_dictionary()`, and if an embedding is provided, we use that?

Maybe I have misunderstood you with the repeated vertices. I was thinking you were saying that was a (potential) problem. I was thinking of doing something naïve like starting at an edge and following edges on one "side". This would give a face once we see the same edge again. Then we would stop once every edge is used exactly twice.

Yes, but we need to add an extra argument ensuring that the method keeps the current behavior for non-planar graphs (raise error when no embedding is provided).

I might be best to do that in another ticket, with a more appropriate ticket name etc.
