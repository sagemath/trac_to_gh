This is a matter of adding an "algorithm" option to the function "factor" and wrapping some of the functionality that is currently not easily accessible.

The patch may conflict with #1145, but that ticket has been immobile for a long time.

Patch attached; it only makes the qsieve and ecm-gmp functionality more readily available from `factor`.

Okay, it makes sense `:-)`

Here is the same patch as a git branch. I just removed a couple of trailing whitespaces.
