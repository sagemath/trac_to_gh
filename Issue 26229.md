That being said you can make review/comments for what it's done by `9da555b` commit.

Well i'm still not sure what the right thing to do for "generator" `'_FSMTapeCache_.preview_word.<locals>.<genexpr>'` it seems to me that `raise StopIteration` is misused here in the first place as `preview_word` is not a proper generator nor an iterator. I need a better understanding of _FSMTapeCache_ before fixing this.

The `preview_word` case will not be fixed in this ticket.

This should be re-targeted for 8.5.
