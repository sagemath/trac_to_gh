spkg.rst should be updated - some links are broken.

I just saw one broken link. Should I push this change?

See also: #29061 Upgrade to symmetrica-3.0.1

Just upgrade it, our forked upstream version is far ahead. I'd like to make a 3.0.2 release sometime soon with the pkg-config file, too. Additional brain power (and maybe German language skills) would be helpful on https://gitlab.com/sagemath/symmetrica/-/merge_requests/3 which is the only remaining item that I have no idea what to do with.

Please prepare a branch at #29061 for us to test.

I've posted a branch on #29061
it looks more attractive than this one, for sure.

We should use either this one or #29061, but not both. (For example, I think that #29061 merges cleanly on top of this one, but then the patch here does not apply to the 3.0.1 tarball.) Both are marked as blockers. Which route should we take? My preference would be: if we can test #29061 on a lot of platforms quickly, we do that. If we can't, then let's use this one now and #29061 in the next release.

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-09-20 21:01:38

let's go with  #29061 then, OK?


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-20 21:53:50

Okay with me.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-20 21:54:16

But I'm not going to mark this as positive review until that one is ready. No need to close this one yet.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-09-24 09:26:39

as #29061 is ready, this one can get a positive review IMHO.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-24 17:46:38

Okay, we can always return to it if we absolutely need to.
