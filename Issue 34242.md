(from #33752)

We lift the conversion code that sends symbolic and AA elements to a suitable embedded number field and back from Normaliz and create a new backend `number_field`, which just runs backend `field` on the converted number field elements.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34479

`assert polymake_base_field  # to muffle pyflakes` breaks polymake tests

My workaround is

```diff
     elif backend == 'polymake':
         base_field = base_ring.fraction_field()
         try:
-            from sage.interfaces.polymake import polymake
+            from sage.interfaces.polymake import polymake, PolymakeElement
             polymake_base_field = polymake(base_field)
+            assert isinstance(polymake_base_field, PolymakeElement)  # to muffle pyflakes
         except TypeError:
```
