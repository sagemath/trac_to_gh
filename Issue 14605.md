Assignee: sage-combinat

The docstring for the `functorial_composition()` method of the class `CycleIndexSeries` is broken in three ways:

* Semantically, it leads into an explanation of how the functorial composition of two cycle index series can be calculated, then stops abruptly;
* The LaTeX tags are not closed properly, so Sphinx processes some text in math mode.
* It does not explain what `SimpleGraphSpecies` (the only example) has to do with anything.

Fixing the second wouldn't fix the first, so I've gone ahead and written a new docstring which explains what the functorial composition of two species is and how the associated cycle index is computed, has no processing errors, and explains the connection to `SimpleGraphSpecies`. See attached patch.
