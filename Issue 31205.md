Looks like the error from #21578 has resurfaced

It looks like the problematic use of the variable `B0` (removed in https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/pull/54/files and https://github.com/linbox-team/fflas-ffpack/commit/346498a71b2759f5913ba8c4c2fe025bbf8b3faa) has been reintroduced in `fflas-ffpack/fflas/fflas_igemm/igemm_kernels.inl`

I once learnt that one should choose macro names wisely. Some people who choose those names are really convinced of their product.
