Any nonzero characteristics computation with symbolics is broken, and rightly so.

That is perfectly fine with me, as long as it is for mathematical (not programming) reasons.  Also, it should be made clear to the user that this is not supported.  Currently, one can do

```
a = SR(Mod(3, 5))
```

which does seem to behave as expected (e.g. `(a*x)^2` returns `4*x^2`, and multiplying this by 5 returns 0).

I'm not the algebraist to make the mathematical case but I strongly suspect there is one. Of course programming plays a role in that the more we tried to support nonzero characteristics in Pynac the odder were the possible problems. It calls for a structured, i.e., algebraic approach, and symbolics do not mix with that.

The easy cases were implemented but see #18787.

What is needed for a clear error is that someone opens a ticket for it.

```

Reading the code from Pynac, it seems that it only differentiates between
- characteristic 0
- characteristic 2
- characteristic >2

So returning "3" might actually fix the problem.
