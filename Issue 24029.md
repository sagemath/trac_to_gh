Is there a reason why we you left the `[Ta]`, `[Ta2]`, and `[Do]` references in the local files rather than move them to the big reference list?

(a) Lazy. (b) It isn't really the point of this ticket. I did this with the one citation which was used twice in different files and was causing problems with the branch here.

I moved a few more and then got lazy myself. :) If my changes are good, then positive review.

There are missing slashes in the modified refs in src/sage/dynamics/interval_exchanges/template.py

They don't seem to cause any problems in the processing of the references, although we could add them.
