I haven't seen problems with this much if at all until just recently trying to build Sage 8.8 from scratch for the Windows release.

Occasionally the build will just block on some package "Waiting for rebase lock".  It's not exactly clear why it's deadlocking.

Experimenting now with this branch.  Just trying to cut down the amount of time each `sage-spkg` goes without holding the lock.  Not sure if it's really relevant though.

Seeing this again on the patchbot I set up--it occasionally hangs waiting for rebase lock.  I don't normally see this locally, but because the patchbot is on a VM that tends to run slow, it's possible some race condition is amplified.

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
