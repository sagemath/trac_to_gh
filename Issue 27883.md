I haven't seen problems with this much if at all until just recently trying to build Sage 8.8 from scratch for the Windows release.

Occasionally the build will just block on some package "Waiting for rebase lock".  It's not exactly clear why it's deadlocking.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28120

Experimenting now with this branch.  Just trying to cut down the amount of time each `sage-spkg` goes without holding the lock.  Not sure if it's really relevant though.

Seeing this again on the patchbot I set up--it occasionally hangs waiting for rebase lock.  I don't normally see this locally, but because the patchbot is on a VM that tends to run slow, it's possible some race condition is amplified.
