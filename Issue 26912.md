# Issue 26912: py3: fix doctests in comparability.pyx

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27149

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2019-01-27 16:38:46

Keywords: py3, graph

We mark the 3 failing doctests as `# py2` and add appropriate tests for `# py3`.

We also avoid using `.edges()`, and at least add it `sort=False`.
