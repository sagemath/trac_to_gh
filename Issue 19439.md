Keywords: polynomial, gcd

In ticket #15790, I introduced the following bug:


```python
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, sparse=True)
sage: S.<y> = R[]
sage: x.gcd(y)
x
sage: x.gcd(3)
NotImplementedError (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError:
```


The bug comes from not testing the parents.

why not use the coercion decorator?


```
@coerce_binop
def gcd
```


With that change:


```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,sparse=True)
sage: S.<y> = R[]
sage: x.gcd(y)
1
sage: _.parent() is S
True
sage: (6*x).gcd(9)
3
sage: _.parent() is R
True
```


Is there any reason I am unaware to perform manually the coercion?

No reason! Thanks for spotting this. I sometimes make things way more complicated than necessary.
