I'm not sure, if merging the fixed branch from #22988 is correct.
Maybe waiting for the changes to show up in the main branch and then adding the Sbox instance is a better way?

For the author, you should have your actual name rather than trac username.

Other than that, this looks fine.

A more general issue with the list of sboxes: is there any good way to check whether these sboxes are correct?  It would be really easy to have a typo in the definition that nobody caught.

Also, when you list dependencies, use a `#` symbol so that it creates a link to the other ticket.
