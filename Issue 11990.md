I am putting this to needs_review as there is an attachment which is more or less complete.

I think it's [this user](http://ask.sagemath.org/users/92/shashank/) at ask.sagemath.  The name in the patch confirms it.

Also, it's not clear whether we should perhaps focus attention on #10552 instead.  I feel like the approach there makes more sense, using `apply_map`.

We've been waiting for a perfect solution for ~3 years, maybe it's time to merge the obvious implementation? If anyone does the work on #10552, all we'd have to do is replace this two-line implementation with the one-line implementation based on that ticket.

You're right, of course.  Some of the other methods do

```
return self.parent()([x.simplify() for x in self.list()])
```

for what it's worth.

I do not understand why the method `.matrix_space()` even exists! It is infinitely slower and should in all cases return the same thing as `.parent()`. It might be useful if a class inherit from `MatrixSpace` but I do not think it is the case. It would better be changed.

I went with `matrix_space()` because I've never really known what `parent()` is supposed to do. But I guess it's safe since everywhere else in the class, "parent" means "immediate parent matrix space." I also changed the implementation to use a list comprehension (no reason, my personal taste has changed).

Most objects have a parent. That is the set in which they belong:

```
sage: 1.parent()
Integer Ring
sage: Permutation([3,2,1]).parent()
Standard permutations
sage: (1.3).parent()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```

This is coded at very low level (namely `sage.structure.element`), and hence very fast. From the parent, you should be able to build new element of the same set.
