Hi Mike!  Thank you for uploading the new code!

I have one immediate question: if I understand correctly, you chose to introduce a new class for every operation on streams, eg. SumStream, ProductStream, TailStream, DerivativeStream, etc.

Could you explain why...?  I would have thought that these things fit more natural into various generating series classes, but I'm sure you have thought quite a lot about this...

Thanks again,

Martin

The main idea is to have the streams know about their (approximate) order.  That way we don't have to worry about initializing generators with the correct approximate order.  We can also do some improvements w.r.t. caching if the streams are a bit more structured.

I'm slowly digging through the new code.  I cannot yet decide whether I like it or not, because I really care about it, so I'd like to understand it first :-)

Questions so far:

1) would it be feasible (and not too much work) to put the new code for streams and formal power series into a new directory (or perhaps even into two, a separate one for streams)?  After all, it's an accident that it's in the species directory.  Species can do without formal power series (in principle), and streams have other uses.

2) I think I mostly like new_stream.  However, from a user's perspective I would rather expect to create streams with


```
sage: s=Stream([1,2,3,4]); t=Stream(lambda l: len(l))
```

and moreover, I'd expect `s[4]` to give an error.  That is, possibly we should have also finite streams.  To create a stream which is constant, we could have something like `Stream(constantly="bla")`, and streams would have to support concatenation.

If we don't, then this behaviour has to be documented very LOUDLY. (I do see that `s=Stream([1,2,3,4,0])` is very convenient.)

    Minor details: 

* `StreamFromFunc` should be `StreamFromFunction` and it might be nice if it wouldn't inherit from `ListCachedStream`, i.e., support for streams where only some coefficients are computed.  

* `number_computed` maybe should be `length_of_cache`.

3) I don't understand the difference between `SeriesStream` and a formal power series yet.

Would it be possible to use the category framework to export operations depending on what the `base_ring` is?  In particular, as pointed out in #14846, one should be careful with providing certain default implementations.  Perhaps related: ideally I would like to be able to say, 


```
sage: h = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).h()
sage: t = SetSpecies().cycle_index_series(); h(t)
```


to do change of basis.


    Minor details:

* I would replace aorder everywhere with order_approximation

* I somehow dislike the idea of `children`, but cannot really say why.

* the doc for `IntegralStream` mentions derivative instead of integral.

You can basically do that with the "OldStreamBehavior" class.

Agreed.

The current semantics of `StreamFromFunc` basically require that it be a "ListCachedStream".  We can add a `MappedStream` which applies a function which takes in a coefficient and produces a new one.

The distinction is pretty fine and in fact they could probably be merged.  The main thing would be just be dealing with the class situation as if you had `class ProductSeries(LazyPowerSeries)` which implemented the things in `ProductStream`, then you'd also have to deal with "`OrdinaryProductSeries`", `IsotypeProductSeries`", and "`CycleIndexProductSeries`".  They could be created on the fly say in `._new()`, but I wasn't sure if that added complexity was worth it.

For now, the best way to think of a difference between a `SeriesStream` and a `LazyPowerSeries` (and friends) is that the latter adds some sort of semantics / meaning to the list of coefficients (for example, `.count()`.

Since many of the (internal) operations need to work with the power-sum basis, you'd mainly just wanting to be converting the coefficients "at the edges".  Or would you want them to always convert to the powersum basis when they needed to?

That's fine -- I mainly kept aorder for backwards compatibility, but we don't need that on the new streams.

In terms of the name?  Or in terms of being able to access "sub-streams"?

Will fix.

Well, we certainly do not want to keep two implementations for the same thing, do we?  To put it bluntly, I'm not sure whether this design decision is a good one.  Let's make the decisions clear:

A) do we want to create streams using `Stream(thing_to_concert_into_a_stream` or `StreamFromList`, `StreamFromIterator`, etc.

    I am sure I want the first behaviour.  Is there any sage object that you create using the second model at all?

B) do we want finite streams?

    I'm not so sure here.  However, if we don't we agree on LOUD documentation.

> The current semantics of `StreamFromFunc` basically require that it be a "ListCachedStream".  We can add a `MappedStream` which applies a function which takes in a coefficient and produces a new one.

Yes, it may be good to have both.  But then the semantics should be precisely the other way round.

I dislike at least the choice for the names here.  `LazyPowerSeries` should be an element of the algebra of formal power series over a ring, I'd say.  I think we should eliminate `.count` entirely.  If we don't, then this should go into `ExponentialGeneratingSeries`, `OrdinaryGeneratingSeries`, `DirichletGeneratingSeries`, etc.  `CycleIndexSeries` is special and I need to think before having an opinion :-)

It would be great if you could give your opinion on that, I don't know the category framework well enough.  In Axiom/FriCAS/Aldor it was extremely useful especially for formal power series.  NB, Ralf implemented the lazy series in aldor from scratch only because he wanted to be independent from Axiom/FriCAS.

Need to run.  All the best,

While I was unable to produce an actual bug using this, it might be possible.  I think we should have a simple linear order ` unk < 1 < 2 < ... < inf `.  Do you know how to do this?

Hi Mike!

The is_constant protocol seems somewhat convoluted; from profiling, Matthieu is telling me that it's taking a non trivial portion of the time. Could it be possibly simplified?

Hello,

#16137 is in the process of being reviewed. Note that it will just be a fast and flexible data structures for (finite or infinite) list like objects. Features:
- it is very lazy (zero computation at instanciation)
- it is a tiny Cython wrapper above list and is hence very fast to access the cached values
- definition can be recursive and involve other lazy lists
- there is no such thing as "ultimately constant lazy list" or "compute with no cache lazy list"
- they are currently immutable (which allows to share memory for slices)

I looked again at the code by Mike Hansen, I believe I understand it a little bit better than 2 years ago.  I try to give a summary, and hope to get some feedback.

The code in this ticket consists of three parts: streams (with similar intentions to `lazy_list`), power series, and the adaptation of the species code.

The code for streams (only roughly 500 lines) is in `new_stream.py`.  It introduces different classes depending on how the stream is to be produced: `StreamFromIterator`, `StreamFromList`, `StreamFromFunction` (unused), and an "abstract base class" `ListCachedStream`.

The code for series is mainly in `series_stream.py` and `series.py`.  The main class is `SeriesStream` (which is a misnomer, I'd say).  Its main purpose is to set up the protocol that enables recursive definitions, by keeping track of the so called approximate order of a series, which is a lower bound on the exponent of the monomials in the series with non-vanishing coefficient.

For each operation on series (binary, like addition, multiplication, composition; unary, like derivative, etc.) introduces a new class, where the above mentioned order and the actual terms are computed.

Finally, the classes `LazyPowerSeriesRing` and `LazyPowerSeries` in `series.py` put this into the algebraic framework.

There are many things I do not completely understand.  For example, for the species code yet another class, `SpeciesSeriesStream`, is introduced, rather than just using `LazyPowerSeries`.  I have no idea why this is so complicated.  (It wasn't complicated in the original aldor code, and it's somehow hard to believe that python would need so much more code.)

Assuming that the code is OK I guess it's best if I rebase it and see what happens.

I have now completed the rebase.  All tests pass.  It would be great if someone more versed in python than me could look at the design...

Well done for the rebase!

Some personal feelings about the code

1. There are public method that should not be there. For example `Stream.compute`. The documentation mentions `Do not use this method`. In such case, the method should be private, i.e. starting with an underscore like `_compute`. Might apply as well to `SeriesStream.refine_order`, `SeriesStream.compute_order`, `RecursiveStream.not_defined_check`, ...

2. The `check_constant_decorator` is really ugly. I would implement it directly in the `__getitem__`.

3. You should seriously consider replacing `new_stream.py` with `lazy_list.pyx` which is currently about 5x faster for `__getitem__` and provide more or less the same functionality
   {{{
   sage: from sage.combinat.species.new_stream import StreamFromFunction
   sage: h = lambda l: 1 if len(l) < 2 else l[-1] + l[-2]
   sage: s = StreamFromFunction(h)
   sage: from sage.misc.lazy_list import lazy_list
   sage: def h2(l): l.append(l[-1]+l[-2])
   sage: s2 = lazy_list(initial_values=[1,1],update_function=h2)
   }}}
   Then
   {{{
   sage: %timeit s[0]
   1000000 loops, best of 3: 942 ns per loop
   sage: %timeit s2[0]
   10000000 loops, best of 3: 148 ns per loop
   }}}
   Though there are missing features. For example, current `lazy_list` do not care about being periodic or constant after a certain point. But I would be happy to implement needed stuff from this side.

   This series code would be a good test case to see whether `lazy_list` are as flexible as they claim to be.

4. In many situations it would be much faster to use Newton's method rather than an intricated tree of streams.

Hello,

Thanks to update and improve this code! ;-)

I have a stupid question: the *lazy* thing is a trick to compute efficiently the coefficient of the product of series or some other operations on series, right? 

About the code, why does `LazyPowerSeries` only inherit  of `AlgebraElement` and not of `Stream`? It seems not so python/object to define a lazy series as a *capsule* of a stream so I want to understand.

All I read in the code look like this

```
class LazyPowerSeries(...):
      ....
      def get_order(self):
        return self._stream.get_order()
     ....
```

so it seems better to inherit of `Stream`.

Jean-Baptiste Priez

No.  The laziness is for having potentially infinite sequences.
 
> About the code, why does `LazyPowerSeries` only inherit  of `AlgebraElement` and not of `Stream`? 

Unless I misunderstand python's inheritance, the point is that a `LazyPowerSeries` should not have the methods of it's stream of coefficients.

My current plan is to remove `Stream` entirely, rename `SeriesStream` to `CoefficientStream` and make the latter into a ring module, which uses the new `lazy_list`, or, once that is in place, Daniel Krenn's `InfiniteSequence`.

Thanks, I changed this locally.  However, I will not take care of the documentation at the moment, because I'm currently (really!) working on the design.

Right now I think that I want a class `CoefficientStream` to model the algebraic structure of the sequence of coefficients of a formal power series with coefficients in a ring, i.e., inheriting from `ModuleElement`.

I am not yet sure whether the computation of the approximate order really belongs here: after all, we want to recursively specify formal power series, not coefficient streams.  The design decision is not completely clear, because formal power series and coefficient streams are almost the same thing - except that most operations feel more natural on the level of formal power series.

Suggestions and comments very welcome!

I will be happy to discuss code design with you. 

I have some code (about species) on the branch `u/elixyre/species` (not associated to any ticket). I was trying to redesign the species with the goal to use the current `Permutations`, `Partitions`, *etc* ...  I don't used the design Parent-Element, I was to lazy to update this code but I can do it easily...

Whatever I recode my own `Series` on this branch (as a simple exercice to understand operations on series). There is a lot of really simple code that I assume to be a draft of a good (code) design. My code was thought to be simple to improve and understand.

(Specially I have a *nice* simple tool to compute the valuation.) 

Do you have some branch where you try your own design that I could pull?

So, very likely it makes sense to start from your branch?

No, because I'm doing this with pencil and paper...

Eventually we could talk, too, I have webcam + whiteboard.
