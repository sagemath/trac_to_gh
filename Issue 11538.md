sage-4.7.1 on eno (x86_64-Linux-core2-fc) fails to install experimental package macaulay2-1.1-r7221.p0.spkg.  

(Note that installing optional package gdbm-1.8.3.spkg is a prerequiste for installing macaulay2-1.1-r7221.p0.spkg.)

Rather than fix this problem, it may be better to upgrade to
a more recent version of macaulay2, such as macaulay2-1.4-r12617.

Attaching `config.log` in this case wouldn't be bad.

But as you mentioned, the package is fairly old anyway, which doesn't necessarily mean a newer version will install seamlessly. Did you already try that?

Yes, I tried installing a newer version.  It did not go well, and
I have abandoned the effort for now.  (Other things are demanding my attention.)  Perhaps someone else will have better luck!

To review #12335 I need to install the spkg `macaulay2-1.1-r7221.p0` into sage-5.0 but when I try I get:

```

Error: the autoconf program is not installed on your system.

Please install or update autoconf: the version () should be at least 2.59.
```

It's mentioned in the error message that one can try:

```
make get-autoconf
```

but going to a sage shell and into the spkg src and running this command fails:

```

Is autoconf installed on your system? If not, does Sage include its own autoconf?

These may be dumb questions, but I can get past the autoconf, maybe because it's on my system. It breaks for me elsewhere.

```

I made a new spkg based on Macaulay2-1.4, so far it fails to build because of 4ti2 and gfan. Both are installed in Sage (4ti2 as optional), but not detected by M2 - I've asked M2 developers what can be done. Including these into M2 package breaks during gfan installation, so I have no idea yet how close I am to a working package.

Here is an spkg that tries to build (building 4ti2 and gfan is prohibited):

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/novoselt/macaulay2-1.4-r12617.spkg

It crashes with implicit-function-declaration after several minutes into the build.

I am also experimenting with the trunk version of version 1.5, but so far I had to enable downloading extra files, these extra files are huge (27Mb for normaliz), and the build is taking forever (although it is likely to succeed - it seems to process documentation now).

I had complaints about libxml2 and yacc. I installed bison for yacc. Right now it's still building, but I'm guessing (fingers crossed) that I have everything I need.

Which shows that things still work quite well - only the last test is not quite clear without looking at the code (and there are 144 failures without M2 available, so there are quite a few tests in that module).

If you have a separate M2 installed, be careful during review tests - if you don't have a working installation inside of Sage the system-wide will be used silently and without any difference. So it may seem that spkg is working when it does not.

On an unrelated note, it is peculiar how 1 was not in `{}` before but `{2}` was in pmatrix code. New way is more consistent and easier to read by a human, I'd like to change Sage latexing in the same way to make manual modifications of results easier...
