# Issue 12784: Let categories override the default implementation of __getitem__ in Parent

Parent.__getitem__ should be moved to FiniteEnumeratedSets (#12955). Alas, this is not yet possible since too many finite enumerated sets in Sage are not in the FiniteEnumeratedSets category. In the meantime, this patch provides a workaround by asking Parent.__getitem__ to first try to call __getitem__ on its super class.
