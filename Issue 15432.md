We can't take the complement of an immutable graph:

```
sage: Gamma = graphs.PathGraph(5).copy(immutable=True)
sage: Gamma.complement()
NotImplementedError
```

which is because `copy(Gamma)` doesn't return a mutable copy.

They are plotting their original graph.

```
sage: G = graphs.PathGraph(5)
sage: G.plot()
sage: GC = G.complement()
sage: GC.plot() # Same as G.plot()
```

Hello Travis !

Well, I guess you can fix this one yourself ! You should just add a `immutable=True` to the call of `copy` in this method. Besides, your second example of code is not really a bug. `GC` is what it should be, but if you plot the complement of a graph with the same layout as for the original graph, it so happens that the edges are all horizontal too. You can add a `layout="spring"` to `plot()` to emphasize it.

Done and NR. Although making an immutable copy destroys the name of the graph, so a slightly different question is do we want that behavior.

Hello !

O_o

Destroys the name of the graph ? Why ? Well if it does I guess it's a bug, isn't it ? `O_o`

Besides : shouldn't the complement of an immutable graph be immutable ?

There are so many functions that will react oddly to immutable graphs....

> Ah, I see. I also understand why you want to keep the same layout as the original graph too.

Yep. It's just unfortunate for this graph `^^;`

I agree that it is a bug:

```
sage: G = graphs.PathGraph(5)
sage: G
Path Graph: Graph on 5 vertices
sage: G.copy()
Path Graph: Graph on 5 vertices
sage: G.copy(immutable=True)
Graph on 5 vertices
```


> Besides : shouldn't the complement of an immutable graph be immutable ?

What's the "canonical" way to check if a graph `G` is immutable? `hasattr(G, '_immutable') and G._immutable`?
 
> There are so many functions that will react oddly to immutable graphs....

We'll just keep fixing them as we come across them I guess.

But my main reason for not liking it is that the Poset backend have this variable set while they are not immutable, and #15623 will fix it anyway... So perhaps we can do that indeed.

`hasattr(obj, attr_str)` is the format which only checks if the attribute is there, but we want to actually retrieve the attribute if possible and if not, then return `False` which would be `getattr(obj, attr_str, [default_value])` in the form of `getattr(self, "_immutable", False)`. The second to last is important because the latest of #15681 removed the conflict with `develop`, and the third to last comes along for the ride.
