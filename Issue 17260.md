I relocated my sage directory from `$HOME/tmp/sage` to `$HOME/Installations/sage` and it broke the compilation. In particular, I got this from libgd:

```
/bin/sh ../libtool --tag=CC   --mode=compile gcc -std=gnu99 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I.   -I/mnt/usb/Installations/sage/local/include/libpng12  -I/home/punarbasu/tmp/sage/local/include/freetype2   -g -march=native -pipe -fvisibility=hidden -MT gdft.lo -MD -MP -MF .deps/gdft.Tpo -c -o gdft.lo gdft.c
libtool: compile:  gcc -std=gnu99 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I/mnt/usb/Installations/sage/local/include/libpng12 -I/home/punarbasu/tmp/sage/local/include/freetype2 -g -march=native -pipe -fvisibility=hidden -MT gdft.lo -MD -MP -MF .deps/gdft.Tpo -c gdft.c  -fPIC -DPIC -o .libs/gdft.o
gdft.c:153:22: fatal error: ft2build.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
```

Looking into `local/bin`, I found that many configuration parameters are still set to my old directory:

```
~/Installations/sageÂ» grep -m1 '/home/punarbasu/tmp/sage' local/bin/* | wc -l
140
```

There was someone else with a strangely similar problem on the list the other day. I think I may have turned them off. In any case what is the content of local/lib/pkgconfig/freetype2.pc? I think the relocation script is supposed to modify it but I suspect it doesn't happen.

I think relocation during a build has never been really supported. Relocation is mostly meant to move an already-compiled Sage installation.

Jeroen is right. I don't think there is anything to make that work if you stop in the middle of the compilation. make distclean is probably your only hope to get a compilation in that case.

Well, my installation was pretty well nigh broken. I deleted it and installed a new one from scratch. You can close this ticket if you don't plan to fix this relocation problem.

BTW, I don't understand what you mean by "relocation during a build". What I did was:

1. Already had develop branch compiled and installed in `~/tmp/sage`
2. Copied my whole sage installation to `/mnt/usb/Installations/sage` and ran `sage` so that the relocation is performed.
3. Ran `sage upgrade` to upgrade to the latest develop branch.

I wasn't changing folders half-way through a develop upgrade. I suspect this can be fixed by fixing the (text) files in `SAGE_ROOT/local/bin`, but my installation was quite badly broken so I decided to start afresh.
