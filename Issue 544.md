It is very annoying that doctesting const.tex causes a bunch of windows to pop up.
This should not happen.  Stop this by putting #optional after all doctests that
would pop up a window, so they aren't actually run, except in the rare cases when
I'm running all optional doctests (and then popups are fine).
