Two comments:
- For every bug fixed, there needs to be a doctest showing that the bug has been fixed.
- It is not clear to me that this is the correct fix; I would find it more appropriate to change the method `LaurentSeries.power_series()` to raise a `ValueError` instead of an `ArithmeticError` when given a Laurent series containing terms with negative exponents.

This is probably the best solution; it is also consistent with rational functions.

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: 1/(1 + x)
Traceback (most recent call last):

I'd be surprised if there is any code that relies on `LaurentSeries.power_series()` raising an `ArithmeticError`, but then again, there may also be code that relies on `__contains__()` not catching `ArithmeticError`...  Anyway, I agree with Jeroen that a `TypeError` is best in view of consistency.
