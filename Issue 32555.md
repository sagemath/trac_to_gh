that currently contains an ugly mixture of Tabs and Spaces.

This could fix some compiler warnings.

This was scripted, running emacs "tabify" on every file.

Warnings could probably be suppressed by adding compiler flags to `# distutils: extra_compile_args` in `src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx`, but we would have to be careful that these flags work on all supported compilers.
