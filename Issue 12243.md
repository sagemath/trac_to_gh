# Issue 12243: Update doctesting framework

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: robertwb

Original creation time: 2012-02-02 18:41:26

There are several improvements that would be good to make, including but not limited to:

1. Forking rather than starting up a new Sage each time.
2. Customizeable comparison rather than mutating doctests into new doctests. 
3. Avoiding the use of writing out temporary files.
4. Provide mechanisms for recording and comparing timings. 
5. Constant headaches caused by the difference in doctesting library vs. non-library files.

I'm working on this.  E-mail me if you want to collaborate.

12415_2.patch seems to contain a lot of tempfile changes, could you split out the doctest changes into a separate patch (or are these affecting doctests?)

apparently even I forget my trac username is not what it should be


---

Comment by roed created at 2012-06-21 05:41:34

I've moved the patches dealing with temporary files to #13147.


---

Comment by roed created at 2012-06-23 15:16:29

Ready for review!

There are still a few known issues:

* valgrinding under sage -t doesn't work.  I haven't used valgrind much and don't know how to resolve this.
* The fix at #13147 probably needs work: I'm getting a failure in `sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular` to do with garbage collection.  I'm working on it.
* I'm in the process of updating the developer guide.

But I wanted to get some other people involved in reviewing.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

This may be a silly question, but how do I use the new framework? Don't we need changes to the scripts repo, too?  (If I just run `sage -t FILES`, I don't see the various messages, like `Doctesting ...`, that should be printed by `run_doctests` are not printed, so `sage -t` is not yet using the new framework.)

One of the patches also didn't apply cleanly to 5.1.beta5:

```
hg qimport -P ~/Downloads/12415_stderr.patch 
adding 12415_stderr.patch to series file

Did you apply the new dependencies (#13145, #13146, #13147)?  There are some more patches to other repositories: I'll update the ticket description.


---

Comment by roed created at 2012-06-24 21:53:01

The description is updated: let me know if you have any more problems.  I think you need to apply 12415_stderr_vs_51b5.patch instead of 12415_stderr.patch.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2012-06-24 23:25:47

Regarding [attachment:12415_spkg_bin_sage.patch], the file in question should be part of the root repo.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2012-06-25 02:09:16

One regression: with the old set-up, running `sage -tp FILES` (with no argument for `tp`) would choose the number of threads automatically. With the new set-up, this command gives an error, because `FILES` is not an integer. Therefore I think that, for example, `make ptestlong` will fail. (The file sage-runtests says that the default value for nthreads is 1, but I don't think optparse is dealing with the missing argument properly here. Also, passing the argument 0 causes doctests to never happen: maybe it's using 0 threads instead of `minimum(8, cpu_count())`.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2012-06-25 02:41:22

I would suggest the following two changes: for the scripts repo:

```diff
diff --git a/sage-runtests b/sage-runtests
--- a/sage-runtests
+++ b/sage-runtests
`@``@` -5,7 +5,7 `@``@` import optparse, os, sys
 if __name__ == "__main__":
     parser = optparse.OptionParser()
 
-    parser.add_option("-p", "--nthreads", type=int, default=1, metavar="N", help="tests in parallel using N threads with 0 interpreted as minimum(8, cpu_count())")
+    parser.add_option("-p", "--nthreads", type="string", default=1, metavar="N", help="tests in parallel using N threads with 0 interpreted as minimum(8, cpu_count())")
     parser.add_option("--serial", action="store_true", default=False, help="run tests in a single process in series")
     parser.add_option("--timeout", type=int, default=-1, help="timeout (in seconds) for doctesting one file")
     parser.add_option("-a", "--all", action="store_true", default=False, help="test all files in the Sage library")
`@``@` -49,7 +49,20 `@``@` if __name__ == "__main__":
     parser.add_option("--stats_path", "--stats-path", default=os.path.join(os.path.expanduser("~/.sage/timings2.json")), \
                           help="path to a json dictionary for the latest run storing a timing for each file")
 
+    options, args = parser.parse_args()
+    try:
+        options.nthreads = int(options.nthreads)
+    except ValueError:
+        args.insert(0, options.nthreads.strip())
+        options.nthreads = 0
+
+    if options.nthreads == 0:
+        try:
+            options.nthreads = int(os.environ['SAGE_NUM_THREADS_PARALLEL'])
+        except KeyError:
+            options.nthreads = 1
+
     from sage.doctest.control import DocTestController
-    DC = DocTestController(*parser.parse_args())
+    DC = DocTestController(options, args)
     err = DC.run()
     sys.exit(err)
```

and for the Sage library:

```diff
diff --git a/sage/doctest/control.py b/sage/doctest/control.py
--- a/sage/doctest/control.py
+++ b/sage/doctest/control.py
`@``@` -433,8 +433,9 `@``@` class DocTestController(SageObject):
             else:
                 nother += 1
         if nfiles + ndbsources + nother:
-            self.log("Doctesting %s."%(", ".join((["%s file%s"%(nfiles, "s" if nfiles > 1 else "")] if nfiles else []) +
-                                                 (["%s other sources"%nother] if nother else []))))
+            self.log("Doctesting %s"%(", ".join((["%s file%s"%(nfiles, "s" if nfiles > 1 else "")] if nfiles else []) +
+                                                 (["%s other sources"%nother] if nother else [])))
+                + " using %s threads."%self.options.nthreads if self.options.nthreads > 1 else ".")
             self.reporter = DocTestReporter(self)
             self.dispatcher = DocTestDispatcher(self)
             try:
```


Or something like that. I guess you should also print the number of threads when you print "Doctesting entire Sage library.", etc.

I've updated the option parsing to allow -p to take no options (though I used a callback so that the -p doesn't have to be last).  I changed 12415_spkg_bin_sage.patch to be an actual patch against the root repository.  I also made a small change to the debug functionality (printing the doctest that failed before dropping into the debugger).

Since I'm modifying four repositories, I'll just update the patches rather than creating lots of referee patches (unless the referee objects!).

`sage/parallel/decorate.py`: Use

```
Unhandled SIG...
```


(on systems, this would give a SIGBUS: Bus Error instead)

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-06-25 06:48:57

Please explain why you're adding `nodoctest` to some of the files in `doc/`?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-06-25 06:58:05

Are _all_ the options in `sage-runtests` actually implemented? (it seems some of them are meant for #12720, these should not be added here)


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-06-25 06:59:41

I guess you're no longer using the scripts `sage-test`, `sage-ptest`, `sage-doctest`, `sage-maketest`, perhaps `sage-test-new` and `sage-test-import`.  Remove these.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-06-25 07:08:38

Why does the doctesting framework need to be imported from `sage.all`?


---

Replying to [comment:33 jdemeyer]:
> Why does the doctesting framework need to be imported from `sage.all`?
I don't think it needs to be, but it makes it easy to test (and debug) doctests from within Sage:

```
sage: run_doctests(sage.rings.integer)
...
```

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-06-25 09:42:37

You have two instances of

```
except:
```

in the new code.

The one for `os.kill()` should just catch `OSError`, for the other one replace

```
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pass
except:
```

by

```
except Exception:
```



---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-06-25 09:46:47

Replace

```
import multiprocessing 
options.nthreads = os.getenv('SAGE_NUM_THREADS_PARALLEL',min(8, multiprocessing.cpu_count()))
```

by

```
options.nthreads = int(os.getenv('SAGE_NUM_THREADS_PARALLEL', 1))
```

(don't reinvent the `sage-num-threads.py` wheel)

Planning to make a reviewer patch, so hang on...

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-06-25 11:51:21

This actually fails on the very first thing I tried (after applying all patches and doing `sage -b`):

```
jdemeyer`@`sage:/release/sage-5.1.beta5-doctest$ ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/rings/padics/
argv ['/release/sage-5.1.beta5-doctest/local/bin/sage-runtests', 'devel/sage/sage/rings/padics/']
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/release/sage-5.1.beta5-doctest/local/bin/sage-runtests", line 68, in <module>
    DC = DocTestController(*parser.parse_args())
  File "/release/sage-5.1.beta5-doctest/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/control.py", line 116, in __init__
    if options.nthreads == 0:
AttributeError: Values instance has no attribute 'nthreads'
```


Am I doing something wrong?

Building from scratch and doing `make ptest` gives:

    Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
    This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
    in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
    want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
    Sage will now terminate.

Comment by roed created at 2012-06-25 17:35:01

Some of these are due to a bug in the change I just made to -p.  I'm working on fixing those.

Some look like you didn't apply the patch to the sagenb repo.  Did you forget, or is something else going on?

Some are due to the fact that in your tests, os.system calls are happening before the python process gets far enough, so results that were printed to the screen in the wrong order.  I'm guessing this may relate to the fact that you're running on /release, since my tests on sage.math didn't show the same behavior.

I'm in the process of fixing stuff.

Comment by roed created at 2012-06-25 17:48:05

There's some code in the current doctesting code to output xml results, which I'm not currently duplicating.  Is this used somewhere?


---

Comment by roed created at 2012-06-25 18:02:23

Currently sage -t --new is broken.  I'm trying to figure out why.


---

Comment by roed created at 2012-06-25 18:32:23

Alright, I'm going to start running tests.  There are still some remaining issues, but the patches are in a state where someone else might want to look at them.  :-)

Remaining problems:

 * #13145 needs work, generating some doctest failures related to deallocating multivariate polynomials
 * hg_sage seems to be broken, causing the --new option to fail
 * valgrinding `sage -t` doesn't work; I'm not sure whether it did before
 * The new code doesn't support xml output

I'll see if I find more when running `sage -t --all`.

Use `sys.stdout.flush()` (and/or the same for `stderr`) before `os.system()` to overcome this.  The difference is probably that my output was sent to a pipe, as opposed to directly to the terminal. In the latter case, flushing is automatic.

True, I might not have applied all patches correctly.

It doesn't make sense to patch the old notebook. Please work with the flask notebook instead (i.e. make this ticket depend on #11080 and preferably #13121).

I agree that it doesn't make much sense to patch the old notebook, but if this can get a positive review quickly I'd rather not wait on #11080 and #13121.  The changes to the old notebook are pretty minor.

Comment by roed created at 2012-06-25 19:40:28

Design question: when running tests in parallel, failed examples are printed as they arise, meaning that examples from different files are intermingled.  Is this a problem that needs to be fixed?


---

Comment by roed created at 2012-06-25 19:42:48

The only tests I have failing on sage.math are `sage.tests.startup` and `sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular` (due to #13145).

It might not be truly a problem, but I prefer the current model where the tests for one file are grouped.

Even better might be an option to show only the _first_ failure in each file.


---

Comment by roed created at 2012-06-25 22:57:38

I've updated the code to group results for each file, and added an option (`sage -t --initial`) so that only the first failure is reported.

There are 3 issues:

1. The doctest failure itself.

2. The fact that `sage -t foo` is written instead of `sage -t --long foo`.

3. Output flushing: note the

```
sage -t devel/sage/sage/pl
```

and then later

By all means please keep working on this, it already looks very cool!

Another annoyance, compare in the output:

```
sage -t devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/padics/polynomial_padic_capped_relative_dense.py
```


```
sage -t /release/merger/sage-5.1.beta5-12415/devel/sagenb-main/sagenb/interfaces/expect.py
```

Why a relative path in the first case but a full path in the second case?  Also with `-a`, only absolute paths are shown.  I would prefer all paths to be relative to the current directory.

A very useful feature from the previous doctester which is missing here is that `--verbose` actually shows the output as the test is running.  So when it gets stuck somewhere, you actually see that it gets stuck.  Currently, the whole test result is simply dumped at the end.

Also: previously, line numbers were shown with `--verbose` (albeit in a very bad way).

One more feature-request: with `--verbose`, show the time taken _for each single test_, i.e. I would like

```
Trying (line 242):
    EllipticCurve('900d1').integral_points()
Expecting:
    [(-11 : 27 : 1), (-4 : 34 : 1), (4 : 18 : 1), (16 : 54 : 1)]
ok [0.10s]
Trying (line 243):
    E=EllipticCurve([-879984,319138704])

Trying (line 255):
    P1=E.point((540,1188)); P2=E.point((576,1836))

It's totally okay for me to disallow `--verbose` in parallel tests.

---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-06-26 10:18:51

I would expect `sage -t -f` not to need any filename arguments (similarly to `-a`), just run all the failed tests.

However:

```

Usage: sage -t [options] filenames
```

I'm collecting some "special cases" for doctests in [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/doctest/](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/doctest/) (maybe these should eventually become "meta-doctests").

The doctesting framework seems to hang on

While the following gives an error inside the doctesting framework (this also used to fail before):

The `-p 1` has one worker: there's another thread which collates and prints answers.  `-p 1` is the default.

Done.  Are there other options that should have a short form?  Maybe `-L` for `--long`?  I'd like to avoid too much mixing of upper and lower case....

There doesn't seem to be an objection to diverting `stderr`, so I'm going to not worry about keeping changes resulting from that decision separate (I don't want to update that patch since it requires rebuilding a lot of files).

If I do `cython('sig_on()')` at the command line nothing happens.  Is it supposed to crash Sage?

I can even run sage commands afterward, like `factor(2^199-1)`.  But if I hit Ctl-C, I get a segfault (and it screws up my terminal).

New version posted.  `sage -t --long -a` passes all tests except the one related to #13145.

`/home/jdemeyer/doctest/keyboardinterrupt.py` passes if you remove the trailing colon.  I've updated the framework to recover a bit more gracefully if a doctest raises an unexpected KeyboardInterrupt, but it behaves a bit strangely since it's difficult to distinguish between an actual interrupt (in which case the testing should terminate) and one raised by a doctest (in which case tests of other files could continue).  I think the new behavior is actually fairly reasonable: try it on your file without removing the colon.

Is this behavior acceptable?  Eventually the test will time out (you can try running `sage -t -T 5 /home/jdemeyer/doctest/sigdie.py`) and the ending summary will be printed with a time out.

A "real" interrupt would interrupt also the master process, a fake doctest-interrupt only the child process.  That's an easy way to distinguish.

Not really.  One should get a message that Sage crashed (compare with the old doctesting framework).

Let me elaborate: #10030 added a check to the doctesting code which checks

```
sage: sig_on_count()
0
```

after each doctest (i.e. it appends this to every doctest), to ensure there are no unbalanced `sig_on()`s.  Could you add this also to your doctesting framework?

Sure, and for reporting what happened to the user this is fine.  But from the child process' perspective, an unexpected `KeyboardInterrupt` has been raised and it should stop testing that file.  The parent process can continue the doctests though....

Okay, I will look into it.  I assume that the underlying process has terminated and I should be able to get at the exit code somehow.

I'm going to sleep; let me know which of these need to be fixed in order for this ticket to get a positive review.  I will also keep working on the tests in `/home/jdemeyer/doctest/`.  And of course if you find more problems or have other feature requests, keep those coming too!

Okay, I see what you mean.  I would propose not to special-case `KeyboardInterrupt` at all in the child process.  When the parent process gets a `KeyboardInterrupt`, kill all child processes (without showing their output) and exit.

(note: since the old doctesting framework didn't do this either, I don't consider this a prerequisite for positive review, but a nice feature to have.)

I suppose you mean "process", not thread?  Still, I don't see the point of `--serial`.

The main point of `--serial` is that it allows you to debug problems in the doctesting framework without worrying about multiprocessing.  :-)

I'm fine making it less prominent (having it not show up in the help display for `sage -t` for example, and not using it for `--verbose` mode).  But I think it should stick around since it currently exists, and it makes some kinds of bugs much easier to track down.

I'm also using it for `--gdb` since it makes the tracebacks simpler, though I'm not sure that's necessary.

Do you ever use `sage -t` with valgrind?  I'm not sure exactly what's wrong with `sage -t --valgrind <FILENAME>`.

I just tried changing the interrupt handling so that `KeyboardInterrupt` is handled in the parent process and it doesn't work as well: there's extraneous printing happening when the doctest framework thinks it's just printing an unexpected exception, and I don't see a good way to get rid of it.

I think the current handling of KeyboardInterrupts is fine.

As far as I understand it, this new framework should allow for the same commands (e.g., `sage -tp 6 --long devel/sage/sage/matrix/`). In addition, though, there are new command-line options to `sage-runtest`, which should available through `sage -t ...`, right? Which of these new options should be documented in the help messages `usage` and/or `usage_advanced` at the top of `spkg/bin/sage`? Which should be documented in the developer's guide?

When doing `make ptest` and `make ptestlong`, all doctests are run but there is no summary at the end.  The processes end with exit code 132 (which usually means an Illegal Instruction but probably not here).

The following are the last lines output by `make ptest` and `make ptestlong`:

I thought I'd solved the sporadic problem in sage.tests.interrupt by increasing the delays in `test_sig_block_outside_sig_on`: after the change I ran `sage -tp --sagenb --long devel/sage/doc/common devel/sage/doc/[a-z][a-z] devel/sage/sage` 10 times with no failures (where before there had been 5 failures in `interrupt.pyx`).  But I just got another one.  Maybe it has to do with the load on sage.math?  There are more processes running now than when I ran the test earlier.

Jeroen, would you be willing to take a look at it since you wrote the tests in that file?

All the other tests pass for me, with the exception of startup.py.

The tests _should_ be designed in such a way that they work regardless of the delay.

Agreed, but I'm at a loss for what's causing the problem, and it's difficult to debug since it's sporadic and a segfault.

I have added some changes to `local/bin/.hgignore` to the scripts patch.  I discovered there was a problem when I put the file `sage-runtests` in `local/bin` without adding it using `hg`.  Surprisingly, `hg status` didn't show `sage-runtests`.

---

Comment by kini created at 2012-07-13 06:55:14

I imported the patch: https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/84

I'll cut a sagenb 0.10.2 release with this fix in it (and put it on #13121). Jeroen, are you aware of any other tickets with bugfix-type patches to sagenb which I could merge at the same time?


---

Comment by kini created at 2012-07-13 07:43:12

Actually, since this doctest fix actually breaks doctests with the current doctesting framework, should I leave this patch for sagenb 0.11 or something? How close would you say this ticket is to positive review? I notice it's set to milestone 5.3, whereas I'm hoping that #13121 can get into 5.2, so maybe that is the way to go.

Yes please.

I think it's mostly finished, but since this is a big change, I'm certainly not merging it in sage-5.2. Also, there is a good chance that various small issues will come up here.

Just one failure remaining related to this ticket:

```

```


But also the formatting of the above failure looks strange:

1) Why does

```
sage -t devel/sage/sage/ext/gmp.pxi
    [0 tests, 0.0 s]
```

appear in the middle of the failure?

2) Could you format the output as

```

**********************************************************************

I would even shorten the last two lines to

```
    [115 tests, 1 failed, 3.6 s]
```


And I would add a function like

```
def count_noun(number, noun):
    if number == 1:
        return "1 %s"%noun
    else:
        return "%d %ss"%(number,noun)
```

So you can do

```
print count_noun(n, 'item'), "had failures"
```

The `KeyboardInterrupt` example [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/doctest/keyboardinterrupt.py](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/doctest/keyboardinterrupt.py) still doesn't work correctly:

```

The expected result is that the test passes.  I don't mind if you don't fix this (currently, it's also broken), but I thought you should know...

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-07-13 09:02:07

Concerning the logfile error: I think you are making the mistaken assumption that `$SAGE_TESTDIR` is an existing directory. But I also find it  strange that a _doctest_ writes to a logfile inside `SAGE_TESTDIR`, I don't really like that.

When testing `sage/tests/interrupt.pyx` verbosely, I regularly get errors of the form

This looks like a bug in the doctesting framework (unless somehow the interrupt tests corrupt the doctest process?)

That's because your expected output has an extra colon.  If you delete the trailing colon it passes tests.

With the extra colon it's an unexpected `KeyboardInterrupt`.

Cool.  I will work on these.

I'm going to be mostly (or entirely) out of communication for the next few days.  Hopefully I'll have some changes available on Monday.

From a discussion on [sage-combinat-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-combinat-devel/-8d0a3AJYoQ/discussion): would it be possible to optionally print extra information after doctesting: how many optional doctests were skipped, and perhaps how they were labeled?

Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem.  But I'd like to put a feature freeze on this ticket and open a new ticket for it: I'm already regretting adding the new debugging feature since I'm struggling with debugging its interaction with `KeyboardInterrupts`.

I just opened #13278 for this.

There's still the `interrupt.pyx` failures which need to be investigated (probably by me since I know most about interrupts).


---

If you could look at those it would be great.  My computer is currently being repaired, but I can try to take another shot at this next week.

Comment by roed created at 2012-10-17 05:13:51

Alright, I've rebased this against 5.4.rc1 and made the suggested changes in #13147.  There's still an intermittent failure in sage.tests.interrupt and I'm at a loss for what's causing it.  Help would be appreciated.


---

Comment by roed created at 2012-10-17 05:16:57

I've put the output before segfault from a case where interrupt.pyx failed at http://pastebin.com/Yvs8Ev68 (expiring in 1 month).


---

Comment by roed created at 2012-10-17 05:44:52

I've moved the debug functionality that triggers on an incorrect result to #13610 since I was struggling to get the interrupt handling working correctly (IPython embedded shells intercept `KeyboardInterrupts`).  With this change the only work issue I'm aware of on this ticket is the intermittent failure in interrupt.pyx.  Testing just interrupt.pyx doesn't trigger this failure (or at least does so rarely); run `sage -t sage/tests/parigp.py sage/tests/interrupt.pyx` for example.


---

Comment by roed created at 2012-10-17 08:28:47

Ok, I found another issue which I'm not going to fix tonight.  The code that parses a file and generates the tests has a bug somewhere that means some files with tests are not getting tested.  I need to track down the bug and add some doctests to make sure this kind of thing doesn't happen again.


---

Comment by roed created at 2012-10-24 03:50:30

Alright, I fixed a bunch of bugs in the parsing of files.  I added two new patches since the old ones were getting big.  Sorry for the huge size of this ticket: some of the changes in [attachment:12415_more_doctest_fixes.patch] can be split off into new tickets, but many of them need to be made along with the switch to the new testing code.


---

Comment by roed created at 2012-10-24 04:48:37

Here's my current status on the `interrupt.pyx` problem.

 * It occurs only if `interrupt.pyx` is not the first file being tested (so `sage -t rings/big_oh.py tests/interrupt.pyx` will show it for example)
 * The segfault is actually caused by the test at line 694 of `interrupt.pyx`: `sage: test_sig_block()`
 
I tried looking into the signal handling code but got lost.  Any ideas?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-10-24 07:28:19

I can have a look at the interrupt code, but not now...


---

Comment by roed created at 2012-10-24 07:45:40

Fair enough.  Do you have any idea when you might have a chance?  Or any suggestions for debugging it myself?

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2012-11-13 19:32:21

I have no idea what's going on, but to follow up on David's comment: on an OS X 10.8 machine, if I run `sage -t rings/big_oh.py tests/interrupt.pyx`, I get an error at line 744. If I make _either_ of the following two changes, the error goes away:

```diff

or

     """

     try:
```

For the second one, I still get the error if I keep line 744,

```
sage: from sage.tests.interrupt import *
```

but remove the actual doctest. Does this have any significance for anyone?


---

Comment by roed created at 2012-11-24 06:26:10

The problem seems to be caused by 

```
sage: test_sig_block()
42
```


but it only shows up if enough time is taken up by later tests.  So you can delete

```
sage: from sage.tests.interrupt import *
sage: for i in range(4):  # Several times to reduce chances of false positive
...       test_signal_during_malloc()
```

and add something else, and you still get the error.


---

Comment by roed created at 2012-11-24 06:28:41

By commenting out most of the tests in that file, I can get the following error message:


```
Fatal Python error: GC object already tracked

I still get a SIGABRT, but now the bad exit code is -6 rather than -11.


---

Comment by roed created at 2012-11-24 13:40:12

Alright.  I have a minimal example that doesn't rely on the doctesting framework.  Of course, I still don't know how to resolve the issue, but at least it should be easier to work on.  See #13748.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2012-11-24 16:28:46

If the issue isn't related to the new doctesting framework, but is a pre-existing condition revealed by it, then it shouldn't be a dependency, but a separate issue. If that was the only issue with this ticket, then this ticket could be merged, right?

I have no problem with that interpretation.  But in some sense it is related to the new doctesting framework since we weren't using Python's multiprocessing module before.

So, does anyone want to give this ticket a positive review?

Comment by roed created at 2013-01-04 07:02:48

Robert wrote that code.  :-)  I think the issue is that some doctests may spawn new processes that can survive their death.  Do you have an alternate approach to suggest?

I'm very happy that you found the problem in #13748; I will try to take a look at this while I'm at the Joint meetings next week.  In general I have very little time this month....

Also, the directory `devel/sagenb/sagenb/data` should probably not be tested, as there are failures because of TAB characters in the MathJax rst documentation.

Do you guys consider it a feature or a bug that

There is some commented-out code mentioning process groups, it would be a good idea to make that work.

But I'm also a bit lost on how the fork()ing actually works and how many Sage sessions are involved.

Looks like I have to depend on this for the numpy-1.7 upgrade at #11334, so I am tagging along :)


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2013-01-15 09:30:09

It is interesting. With each new version of numpy we seem to have new instances of 

```
Warning: divide by zero encountered in divide
```

appearing in doctests. This suggest that numpy sometimes mixes stderr and stdout or that they are very intent to tell you about these warnings. All the instances of this warning that are fixed in [attachment:12415_stderr_vs_51b5.patch] also appears with the upgrade to numpy 1.7.0 - plus some more.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2013-02-06 14:06:29

There is a lot of

```
if output_semaphore is not None:
    output_semaphore.acquire()
```

in the code which could be simplified assuming that `output_semaphore` is never `None`. Could we ensure that?

In fact, the whole block

```
try:
    if output_semaphore is not None:
        output_semaphore.acquire()
    do_something()
finally:
    if output_semaphore is not None:
        output_semaphore.release()
```

could be simplified to

```
with output_semaphore:
    do_something()
```

I vote to completely remove the `--serial` option since for me the only effect is that it makes the code more complicated. Consider for example:

```
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            if result_pipe is None:
                # We're in serial mode
                raise
            # Otherwise, we've been started by a worker: we'll return the result in the finally block
            result = 0, DictAsObject(dict(err='ctlC')), ""
[...]
        finally:
            if result_pipe is None:
                return result
            else:
                result_pipe.put(result, False)
```


If I want to fix `KeyboardInterrupt`s in doctests, I now have to think about _two_ code paths instead of one.

Answering my own question, it seems that N `DocTestWorkers` are started with `make -j N`.

But I don't understand the design choice of having *two levels* of multiprocessing: one from the master process to the `DocTestWorker` and one from the `DocTestWorker` to the `DocTestTask`.

I surely need to think more about this, but I propose a redesign with only one level of multiprocessing, completely bypassing the `DocTestWorker` class. This would give the benefits of "serial" processing while still allowing parallel doctests.

I would love to cooperate on this ticket, but I'm having a really hard time to understand everything.  As I said before, this absolutely needs some high-level documentation explaining the various classes involved and their inter-relations (in particular, the classes in `forker.py`).

Hi Jeroen,
Sorry for the slow response time: I've had a visitor here in Calgary who's leaving this evening.  I've started writing up overall documentation, and will work on it tonight.

In answer to your question about two layers of multiprocessing, the reason is to insulate the controlling process from segfaults and serious failures in the files being tested.  If we come up with a design that satisfies that goal and also allows testing with multiple processes through `sage -t -p N` I'm happy to change things.  I certainly wouldn't call myself an expert on writing multi-process code.

I'll write more this evening, and also review #14079 and #14080.

We obviously need one level of multiprocessing to allow segmentation faults. But my idea would be to skip the first level of multiprocessing and move the code which is currently in `DocTestWorker` to the top-level process. I think that would simplify the code substantially.

How would you run multiple files in parallel then?

Replying to [comment:172 roed]:

Like I said. Have one master process doing the jobs of the current master process + the current `DocTestWorker`. That master process would start child processes for every file to be doctested, check for timeouts and crashes of the child processes.

And use #14079 to manage everything without busy-waiting.


---

Comment by roed created at 2013-02-11 08:50:47

Okay.  I have no objections to removing the `-serial` option and changing the process management as you suggest.  It sounds like you have a good idea of how to rewrite it; how can I be useful?  I can certainly review #14080 and #14079 and add overall documentation.  What else would be useful?

There are still some doctest failures left. I fixed a few in my reviewer patch (and #14070) but there are some I couldn't immediately fix. There is also the issue with TAB characters in `devel/sagenb/sagenb/data`, ideally that directory would be skipped from doctesting.

But try not to change `forker.py` too much, as I'm thinking of substantial changes there.

Sounds good.  I'll work on fixing doctest failures.

I also don't like this:

```
        except IOError:
            # File doesn't exist
            result = 0, DictAsObject(dict(err='file')), ""
```


You assume that _any_ `IOError` comes from the fact that the doctested file doesn't exist. But it could also be a problem instead with the temporary file used for output (no space on `/tmp` for example). Then the error message "File not found" would be very confusing. I think we need to explicitly check the existence of the doctested file and not handle `IOError` specially.

I think the word "output" is badly overused (there is the standard output, the file `output=os.tmpfile()`, the string `output` referring to the _contents_ of the `output` file and `delayed_output`).

I propose to rename:
- `delayed_output` to `messages`
- `output` (the file) to `outtmpfile` (or `tmpoutfile`?)

And am I right that `delayed_output` is empty in normal mode when there are no doctest failures?

Sure, either "`messages`" or "`delayed_messages`" is fine.  It should be empty in normal mode with no failures.

Some comments: 
* For compatibility with Python's `doctest` module, `summarize` should take `verbose` as the first argument and `msgfile` as an optional second argument.
* It's `sage.ext.pselecter` rather than `sage.ext.pselect, unless you changed #14079.
* Currently I get a timeout whenever I run tests on a file.
* Why did you disable the code that sets `following` in `_parallel_dispatch`?

Overall, I think the changes are good ones.

Fair enough. I never considered this compatibility, so it is quite possible that I introduced more incompatibilities.

Yes, I did change #14079 but didn't realise that I hadn't uploaded the new patch. Anyway, I am looking into the problem on OS X.

Could be the same OS-dependent problem as the one you reported in #14079.

Simply because it is work in progress, new tests are needed. My `DocTestWorker` has a substantially different function from the old `DocTestWorker`, so I cannot recycle the tests.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2013-02-13 11:56:43

I noticed a change in behaviour and I'm wondering whether it is intentional.

Old doctesting framework outputs like:

```
sage -t file.py
<messages>
         [4.1 s]
```


New doctesting framework outputs like:

```
<messages>
sage -t file.py
    [1 test, 1 failure, 1.7 s]
```


I dislike the last way of outputting, especially in `--verbose` mode, because there is no mention of what file is being tested. You see:

```
Running doctests with ID 2013-02-13-12-55-39-de348564.
Doctesting 1 file.
Trying (line 2):    cython('sig_on()')
Expecting nothing
ok [1.61 s]
...
```

"line 2" of which file?...

Adding the number of tests and number of failures was intentional (to which I assume you don't object).  The change in order is an artifact of the code that delayed printing.  When there are lots of processes running parallel, you can't output 


```
sage -t file.py
```


before starting testing, since the messages will get mixed up.  I agree that the line describing which file is being tested should come at the beginning.

OK, so you agree with

```
sage -t file.py
<messages>
    [1 test, 1 failure, 1.7 s]
```


I would move the part of `report()` which prints the "sage -t ..." header to a new function `report_start()` (for example) and then correct the logic in `forker.py` to call that function at the appropriate time. Does that sound good?

Sounds good.  Presumably it will get printed to the `msgfile` before all of the other messages and then actually printed to the screen in whatever way is appropriate.

I'm running tests on OS X 10.6.8 with sage 5.7.beta1.

* Your changes to `sage.calculus.test_sympy` break doctests on my machine: they were correct before the change.  Presumably these results are system dependent and should be changed somehow.
* I get a bad exit in sage.misc.interpreter at line 132 (in `get_test_shell()`): it prints out a bunch of help text from IPython, ending with

```
[SageTerminalApp] Bad config encountered during initialization:
[SageTerminalApp] Unrecognized flag: '--all'
```

I'm not really sure what's happening here: perhaps it's related to the IPython upgrade?
* The same thing happens in `sage.misc.sage_extension` at line 22.
* There's still an error in `sagenb.notebook.worksheet` line 196: `sagenb.notebook` has no attribute `misc`.  I've seen this before and it should be easy to fix.
* There are problems running some tests in `sage.doctest.control` that may go away with your new code.  If not I have fixes for them.

How is [attachment:12415_review.patch] coming along?

The difference is between plain ASCII characters and some fancy Unicode characters for the display. Not sure what to do with this.

I think it works well for normal testing. I still have to think about `--debug` and things like `--gdb`.  It seems it will be necessary to have a serial mode for example for `--gdb`, so  I have to put that back in.  I would also like to force `--serial` when `--debug` is used, mainly to simplify the code.

But first I'm going to look at #14079 on OS X.

I fixed it by temporarily turning off unicode in pretting printing.  I updated the patch with this change.

Nope: applying #14070 fixed the problem.

Okay, the easy fix I remembered is to add a line to sagenb.notebook.worksheet:


```
         EXAMPLES: We test the constructor via an indirect doctest::
 
             sage: nb = sagenb.notebook.notebook.Notebook(tmp_dir()+'.sagenb')
+            sage: import sagenb.notebook.misc
             sage: sagenb.notebook.misc.notebook = nb
             sage: W = nb.create_new_worksheet('Test with unicode ěščřžýáíéďĎ', 'admin')
             sage: W

```


I haven't made any changes to `sagenb` for a long time.  I assume this would require a new spkg?

New major update of my code. Now adds support for `--debug`.

I removed `SagePdb` since the motivation of the output-redirection in the Python doctesting framework seems to be doctesting `Pdb` itself, not running a debugger inside the doctesting framework. For the new doctesting framework, we just need to stop spoofing before entering the debugger and start spoofing after the debugger is finished and that's all.

I have been thinking about the encoding warnings (and encodings in doctests in general). I think there are two options:
 1. either we ignore the Cython warnings and continue working with pure strings,
 2. or we make the doctester completely Unicode-aware.

I don't really see any middle ground. I'm inclined to go for the first option initially, but eventually migrating to the second option _in a different ticket_.

But I'm open to opinions on this.

Sounds like a good plan to me.  I prefer to avoid unicode when I can.

I have not investigated, but I assume it must be some strange interaction between the `DocTestWorker` processes and the `cohen_macaulay` subprocesses.

Since `bsd.math` has been down for a while (now it is back up), I haven't been able to look into the OS X issues.

I guess the only remaining issue is `--gdb` (and `--valgrind`...) support.

What's the point of running optional tests without optional "sage" tests? Because that would badly fail with code like

```
sage: a = some_object()
sage: a.some_standard_method()
sage: a.use_mypackage()  # optional: mypackage
```

(only the last line would be executed)

Are all doctests supposed to be written like

```
sage: a = some_object()
sage: a.some_standard_method()

sage: a = some_object()  # optional: mypackage
sage: a.use_mypackage()  # optional: mypackage

I agree that the current implementation is kinda dumb.  But I could see wanting to run `sage -t --all --optional gap` and have only files with optional gap tests be run.

Yeah, that's how I see it.  I don't really run optional tests very often, but it seems like it could be useful to quickly run the tests that directly depend on gap when you update an spkg or something.  But I'm not really attached to the particulars of the interface, so feel free to change it.

A question about this new framework: at #13928, it was pointed out that if you (for whatever reason) put the Sage directory into a directory whose path contains "/." (like "/home/user/.Sage-stuff/sage-5.8.beta0/"), then it will refuse to doctest any files in the Sage library. Will that still be true with this new setup?

After this patch is applied, will all files be skipped if SAGE_ROOT contains a `/.` somewhere, even if it is not a `/.hg` ?

I've installed the patches on an OS X 10.8.2 box, and running `./sage -tp devel/sage/sage/homology devel/sage/sage/parallel/` works fine, correctly detecting two cores, and completing testing faster than `./sage -t ...`. Using `./sage -tp 3 ...` runs even slightly faster.

Without applying any of the patches here, if a user modifies their configuration, say via #14188, some doctests may fail. I assume the same will be true after applying the patches here.

It used to work and I used it at some point to deal with the nice random failures caused by the introduction of weak caches of #715.
Note the optional spkg we currently propose is really old (and surely dysfunctional on most systems), but there's an update rotting at #13060.
I wouldn't mind making valgrind working again a follow-up ticket as I'm not actively using it right now.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2013-02-28 09:26:22

Concerning `DOT_SAGE`: it's not as easy as you think. The problem is that the doctesting framework needs `DOT_SAGE` in a few places, for example to store the timing information. So running

```
sage --nodotsage -t ...
```

is not an option.

Perhaps changing `$IPYTHONDIR` is sufficient? That could be done within the doctesting framework.

Still working through [attachment:12415_review.patch], but note that four functions in sage.doctest.forker don't have tests.

Comment by roed created at 2013-03-01 01:04:20

Here's a review patch which adds doctests for the four functions that were missing them and makes a few other minor changes.  Other than this, I'm happy with Jeroen's changes.

In [attachment:12415_review_review.patch], line 693 of control.py, "sage.supp" got changed to "sage.sup". Was this intentional?

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2013-03-01 05:17:45

When I run `make ptestlong`, things look fine on the screen, but I see some funny characters in ptestlong.log (this is on OS X 10.8.2):

```
Doctesting 2283 files using 2 threads.
^[�[?1034hsage -t --long devel/sage/sage/misc/interpreter.py
    [107 tests, 12.0 s]
```

So far, this is the only instance of this in the file. Could it be some sort of terminal color escape sequence? I see it on one machine but not another, so maybe it was just a cosmic ray...

Yes. It most likely comes from the `import readline` I added in `init_sage()` (this happens once, so it's normal you see it only once in `ptestlong.log`). I have been fighting quite a bit with terminal I/O in this new doctester, and this is yet another manifestion of terminal issues :-(

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2013-03-01 08:12:39

Could you do me a favour since I don't have access to an OS X 10.8 system:

Remove that `import readline` statement and run

```
./sage -btp N --long devel/sage/sage/doctest devel/sage/sage/tests
```

in the following ways:
 1. Normal doctest run in the terminal, let it finish
 2. Interrupt (CTRL-C) the tests somewhere in the middle of the run
 3. Pipe the output through `less`: `./sage -tp 2 ... | less`
And all this both with `-p 1` and with `-p N` for some `N > 1`.

David, I noticed that `doc/en/developer/doctesting.rst` in [attachment:12415_doc.patch] is full of TAB characters. Could you please replace those by 8 spaces?

I agree with [attachment:12415_review_review.patch].

Did you also look at [attachment:12415_doctest_review.patch], [attachment:12415_script_review.patch] and [attachment:12415_test.patch]?

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2013-03-01 08:28:23

Sorry, too fast. This is dangerous:

```
sage: W.start() 
sage: W.join() 
sage: while W.rmessages is not None: 
....:   W.read_messages() 
sage: len(W.messages) > 0 
True 
```

You should read the messages _while_ the worker is running, because otherwise the pipe buffer might get full, leading to a block. So put `W.join()` at the end instead of at the beginning. Apart from that, it's a useful and good test.

That's ironic.  I replaced them, though I left the ones you're deleting in [attachment:12415_review.patch] so that it applies cleanly.

> Did you also look at [attachment:12415_doctest_review.patch], [attachment:12415_script_review.patch] and [attachment:12415_test.patch]?

[attachment:12415_doctest_review.patch] and [attachment:12415_script_review.patch] both look fine.

For [attachment:12415_test.patch], you never run some of the files in the test directory (`sig_on.rst` and `sleep_and_raise.rst`).  Otherwise they look good.

Done.  I also updated the tests for `kill` and `save_result_output` to be more robust.

Well, I found `sleep_and_raise.rst` useful for manual testing, so I left it.

And `sig_on.rst` will be tested in the follow-up #14152 (which will be an easy ticket).

On OS X 10.8.2.

Running with `sage -btp 1 ...`:

```
sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/tests/french_book/polynomes.py
/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/sage-5.8.beta2/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Cython/Build/Dependencies.py:229: UnicodeWarning: Unicode equal comparison failed to convert both arguments to Unicode - interpreting them as being unequal
  if code[q-1] == u'\\':
    [107 tests, 2.6 s]
```

Running with `sage -btp 2 ...` — note the random (?) placement of the unicode warning:

```
sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/tests/book_stein_modform.py
    [239 tests, 3.3 s]

  if code[q-1] == u'\\':
sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/tests/french_book/polynomes.py
    [107 tests, 2.3 s]
```


Without the `import readline` statement, I got one nonrepeatable failure with `sage -btp 2 ...` (probably has nothing to do with readline, but have you seen this before?):

```

```

```


Except for the nonrepeatable failure, I see no difference with or without `import readline`.

That actually looks serious, I'll have a look.

That's before the doctester starts, so it's not our problem.

Excellent!  I suspect there's more trouble somewhere, but I would suggest dealing with it in follow-up tickets.

The changes all look fine to me, but I haven't run full doctests (and am probably not going to be able to today since I'm traveling).  I'm happy giving this positive review subject to all doctests passing.

While you were developing this, did you consider using Python's [DocTestFinder](http://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocTestFinder) to extract docstrings from Python files? The current code here doesn't use `object.__doc__`, perhaps the Python doctest module does. I ask because #13605 added several classes with a dynamic `__doc__`.

I didn't, and it sounds like a good idea.  We can override it to deal with Cython classes if necessary.

Do you think we should make this change on this ticket or a followup?  I won't be able to work on it much until next week (I'm still in Hawaii after Sage Days 46).

Strangely, the tests in `sage.doctest.forker.SageDocTestRunner.report_unexpected_exception` seem to succeed.

Comment by andrew.mathas created at 2013-05-02 03:03:38

This patch breaks the fixdoctests script. The problem is that the strings which sage-fixdoctests searches for in order to identify the line numbers have changed with the new output implemented in the current patch. 

I have just uploaded the patch #10589 which makes ```sage -fixdoctests``` work properly with the new doctest output (as stated on the ticket for #10589, the main point of this patch is to fix some different problems with fixdoctests). This patch also adds a test to sage/tests/cmdline.py for the fixdoctests script so that the doctest framework now has a chance of identifying patches which break it in future.

Comment by kcrisman created at 2013-06-14 15:13:00

Neither here nor on #14184 is there any public discussion of having removed `--only-optional`/`--only_optional`.  The [developer conventions](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#further-conventions-for-automated-testing-of-examples) have a nice unified way of testing examples, but it was very useful to just skip the "regular" tests.  Did I miss a different place where this was disabled (and why? presumably technical)?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2013-06-15 07:38:52

`--only-optional` was replaced by `--optional`. The old documentation was very unclear about what `--optional` and `--only-optional` did, so we basically just implemented what we could understand.
