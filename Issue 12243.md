There are several improvements that would be good to make, including but not limited to:

1. Forking rather than starting up a new Sage each time.
2. Customizeable comparison rather than mutating doctests into new doctests. 
3. Avoiding the use of writing out temporary files.
4. Provide mechanisms for recording and comparing timings. 
5. Constant headaches caused by the difference in doctesting library vs. non-library files.

12415_2.patch seems to contain a lot of tempfile changes, could you split out the doctest changes into a separate patch (or are these affecting doctests?)

Ready for review!

There are still a few known issues:

* valgrinding under sage -t doesn't work.  I haven't used valgrind much and don't know how to resolve this.
* The fix at #13147 probably needs work: I'm getting a failure in `sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular` to do with garbage collection.  I'm working on it.
* I'm in the process of updating the developer guide.

But I wanted to get some other people involved in reviewing.

This may be a silly question, but how do I use the new framework? Don't we need changes to the scripts repo, too?  (If I just run `sage -t FILES`, I don't see the various messages, like `Doctesting ...`, that should be printed by `run_doctests` are not printed, so `sage -t` is not yet using the new framework.)

One of the patches also didn't apply cleanly to 5.1.beta5:

I don't think it needs to be, but it makes it easy to test (and debug) doctests from within Sage:

```
sage: run_doctests(sage.rings.integer)
...
```

You have two instances of

```
except:
```

in the new code.

The one for `os.kill()` should just catch `OSError`, for the other one replace

```
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pass
except:

    Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
    This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
    in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
    want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
    Sage will now terminate.

Some of these are due to a bug in the change I just made to -p.  I'm working on fixing those.

Some look like you didn't apply the patch to the sagenb repo.  Did you forget, or is something else going on?

Some are due to the fact that in your tests, os.system calls are happening before the python process gets far enough, so results that were printed to the screen in the wrong order.  I'm guessing this may relate to the fact that you're running on /release, since my tests on sage.math didn't show the same behavior.

* hg_sage seems to be broken, causing the --new option to fail
* valgrinding `sage -t` doesn't work; I'm not sure whether it did before

Use `sys.stdout.flush()` (and/or the same for `stderr`) before `os.system()` to overcome this.  The difference is probably that my output was sent to a pipe, as opposed to directly to the terminal. In the latter case, flushing is automatic.

There are 3 issues:

1. The doctest failure itself.

2. The fact that `sage -t foo` is written instead of `sage -t --long foo`.

3. Output flushing: note the

```

A very useful feature from the previous doctester which is missing here is that `--verbose` actually shows the output as the test is running.  So when it gets stuck somewhere, you actually see that it gets stuck.  Currently, the whole test result is simply dumped at the end.

Also: previously, line numbers were shown with `--verbose` (albeit in a very bad way).

One more feature-request: with `--verbose`, show the time taken *for each single test*, i.e. I would like

```

New version posted.  `sage -t --long -a` passes all tests except the one related to #13145.

`/home/jdemeyer/doctest/keyboardinterrupt.py` passes if you remove the trailing colon.  I've updated the framework to recover a bit more gracefully if a doctest raises an unexpected KeyboardInterrupt, but it behaves a bit strangely since it's difficult to distinguish between an actual interrupt (in which case the testing should terminate) and one raised by a doctest (in which case tests of other files could continue).

A "real" interrupt would interrupt also the master process, a fake doctest-interrupt only the child process.  That's an easy way to distinguish.

```
sage: sig_on_count()
0

The main point of `--serial` is that it allows you to debug problems in the doctesting framework without worrying about multiprocessing.  :-)

I'm fine making it less prominent (having it not show up in the help display for `sage -t` for example, and not using it for `--verbose` mode).  But I think it should stick around since it currently exists, and it makes some kinds of bugs much easier to track down.

I'm also using it for `--gdb` since it makes the tracebacks simpler, though I'm not sure that's necessary.

Do you ever use `sage -t` with valgrind?  I'm not sure exactly what's wrong with `sage -t --valgrind <FILENAME>`.

I just tried changing the interrupt handling so that `KeyboardInterrupt` is handled in the parent process and it doesn't work as well: there's extraneous printing happening when the doctest framework thinks it's just printing an unexpected exception, and I don't see a good way to get rid of it.

I think the current handling of KeyboardInterrupts is fine.

In addition, though, there are new command-line options to `sage-runtest`, which should available through `sage -t ...`, right? Which of these new options should be documented in the help messages `usage` and/or `usage_advanced` at the top of `spkg/bin/sage`? Which should be documented in the developer's guide?

Just one failure remaining related to this ticket:

```
**********************************************************************
File "devel/sage/sage/doctest/control.py", line 258, in sage.doctest.control.DocTestController.add_files
Failed example:
    DC = DocTestController(DD, [])
Expected nothing
Got:
    Unable to open logfile at /release/merger/sage-5.1-12415/home/.sage//tmp/test.log
    Proceeding without logging.
sage -t devel/sage/sage/ext/gmp.pxi
    [0 tests, 0.0 s]
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of  15 in sage.doctest.control.DocTestController.add_files
***Test Failed*** 1 failures.
sage -t devel/sage/sage/doctest/control.py
    [115 tests, 3.6 s]
```


But also the formatting of the above failure looks strange:

1) Why does

```
sage -t devel/sage/sage/ext/gmp.pxi
    [0 tests, 0.0 s]
```

appear in the middle of the failure?

2) Could you format the output as

```
sage -t devel/sage/sage/doctest/control.py
**********************************************************************
[...failure...]
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of  15 in sage.doctest.control.DocTestController.add_files
***Test Failed*** 1 failures.
    [115 tests, 3.6 s]
```


I would even shorten the last two lines to

```
    [115 tests, 1 failed, 3.6 s]
```


And I would add a function like

```
def count_noun(number, noun):
    if number == 1:
        return "1 %s"%noun
    else:
        return "%d %ss"%(number,noun)
```

So you can do

```
print count_noun(n, 'item'), "had failures"
```

That's because your expected output has an extra colon.  If you delete the trailing colon it passes tests.

With the extra colon it's an unexpected `KeyboardInterrupt`.

* The segfault is actually caused by the test at line 694 of `interrupt.pyx`: `sage: test_sig_block()`

I vote to completely remove the `--serial` option since for me the only effect is that it makes the code more complicated. Consider for example:

```
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            if result_pipe is None:
                # We're in serial mode
                raise
            # Otherwise, we've been started by a worker: we'll return the result in the finally block
            result = 0, DictAsObject(dict(err='ctlC')), ""
[...]
        finally:
            if result_pipe is None:
                return result
            else:
                result_pipe.put(result, False)
```


If I want to fix `KeyboardInterrupt`s in doctests, I now have to think about *two* code paths instead of one.

Answering my own question, it seems that N `DocTestWorkers` are started with `make -j N`.

But I don't understand the design choice of having **two levels** of multiprocessing: one from the master process to the `DocTestWorker` and one from the `DocTestWorker` to the `DocTestTask`.

I surely need to think more about this, but I propose a redesign with only one level of multiprocessing, completely bypassing the `DocTestWorker` class. This would give the benefits of "serial" processing while still allowing parallel doctests.

Hi Jeroen,
Sorry for the slow response time: I've had a visitor here in Calgary who's leaving this evening.  I've started writing up overall documentation, and will work on it tonight.

In answer to your question about two layers of multiprocessing, the reason is to insulate the controlling process from segfaults and serious failures in the files being tested.  If we come up with a design that satisfies that goal and also allows testing with multiple processes through `sage -t -p N` I'm happy to change things.  I certainly wouldn't call myself an expert on writing multi-process code.

I'll write more this evening, and also review #14079 and #14080.

I think the word "output" is badly overused (there is the standard output, the file `output=os.tmpfile()`, the string `output` referring to the *contents* of the `output` file and `delayed_output`).

- `delayed_output` to `messages`
- `output` (the file) to `outtmpfile` (or `tmpoutfile`?)

Some comments: 
* For compatibility with Python's `doctest` module, `summarize` should take `verbose` as the first argument and `msgfile` as an optional second argument.
* It's `sage.ext.pselecter` rather than `sage.ext.pselect, unless you changed #14079.
* Currently I get a timeout whenever I run tests on a file.

Yes, I did change #14079 but didn't realise that I hadn't uploaded the new patch. Anyway, I am looking into the problem on OS X.

Could be the same OS-dependent problem as the one you reported in #14079.

Simply because it is work in progress, new tests are needed. My `DocTestWorker` has a substantially different function from the old `DocTestWorker`, so I cannot recycle the tests.

I noticed a change in behaviour and I'm wondering whether it is intentional.

Old doctesting framework outputs like:

```
sage -t file.py
<messages>
         [4.1 s]
```


New doctesting framework outputs like:

```
<messages>
sage -t file.py
    [1 test, 1 failure, 1.7 s]
```


I dislike the last way of outputting, especially in `--verbose` mode, because there is no mention of what file is being tested. You see:

```

Adding the number of tests and number of failures was intentional (to which I assume you don't object).  The change in order is an artifact of the code that delayed printing.  When there are lots of processes running parallel, you can't output 


```
sage -t file.py
```


before starting testing, since the messages will get mixed up.  I agree that the line describing which file is being tested should come at the beginning.

I'm running tests on OS X 10.6.8 with sage 5.7.beta1.

* Your changes to `sage.calculus.test_sympy` break doctests on my machine: they were correct before the change.  Presumably these results are system dependent and should be changed somehow.
* I get a bad exit in sage.misc.interpreter at line 132 (in `get_test_shell()`): it prints out a bunch of help text from IPython, ending with

```
[SageTerminalApp] Bad config encountered during initialization:
[SageTerminalApp] Unrecognized flag: '--all'
```

I'm not really sure what's happening here: perhaps it's related to the IPython upgrade?
* The same thing happens in `sage.misc.sage_extension` at line 22.
* There's still an error in `sagenb.notebook.worksheet` line 196: `sagenb.notebook` has no attribute `misc`.  I've seen this before and it should be easy to fix.
* There are problems running some tests in `sage.doctest.control` that may go away with your new code.  If not I have fixes for them.

How is [attachment:12415_review.patch] coming along?

The difference is between plain ASCII characters and some fancy Unicode characters for the display. Not sure what to do with this.

I think it works well for normal testing. I still have to think about `--debug` and things like `--gdb`.  It seems it will be necessary to have a serial mode for example for `--gdb`, so  I have to put that back in.  I would also like to force `--serial` when `--debug` is used, mainly to simplify the code.

But first I'm going to look at #14079 on OS X.

I fixed it by temporarily turning off unicode in pretting printing.  I updated the patch with this change.

Nope: applying #14070 fixed the problem.

Okay, the easy fix I remembered is to add a line to sagenb.notebook.worksheet:


```
         EXAMPLES: We test the constructor via an indirect doctest::
 
             sage: nb = sagenb.notebook.notebook.Notebook(tmp_dir()+'.sagenb')
+            sage: import sagenb.notebook.misc
             sage: sagenb.notebook.misc.notebook = nb
             sage: W = nb.create_new_worksheet('Test with unicode ěščřžýáíéďĎ', 'admin')
             sage: W

```


I haven't made any changes to `sagenb` for a long time.  I assume this would require a new spkg?

New major update of my code. Now adds support for `--debug`.

I removed `SagePdb` since the motivation of the output-redirection in the Python doctesting framework seems to be doctesting `Pdb` itself, not running a debugger inside the doctesting framework. For the new doctesting framework, we just need to stop spoofing before entering the debugger and start spoofing after the debugger is finished and that's all.

I have been thinking about the encoding warnings (and encodings in doctests in general). I think there are two options:
1. either we ignore the Cython warnings and continue working with pure strings,
2. or we make the doctester completely Unicode-aware.

I don't really see any middle ground. I'm inclined to go for the first option initially, but eventually migrating to the second option *in a different ticket*.

But I'm open to opinions on this.

I have not investigated, but I assume it must be some strange interaction between the `DocTestWorker` processes and the `cohen_macaulay` subprocesses.

Since `bsd.math` has been down for a while (now it is back up), I haven't been able to look into the OS X issues.

I guess the only remaining issue is `--gdb` (and `--valgrind`...) support.

I agree that the current implementation is kinda dumb.  But I could see wanting to run `sage -t --all --optional gap` and have only files with optional gap tests be run.

After this patch is applied, will all files be skipped if SAGE_ROOT contains a `/.` somewhere, even if it is not a `/.hg` ?

It used to work and I used it at some point to deal with the nice random failures caused by the introduction of weak caches of #715.
Note the optional spkg we currently propose is really old (and surely dysfunctional on most systems), but there's an update rotting at #13060.

Concerning `DOT_SAGE`: it's not as easy as you think. The problem is that the doctesting framework needs `DOT_SAGE` in a few places, for example to store the timing information. So running

```
sage --nodotsage -t ...

is not an option.

Perhaps changing `$IPYTHONDIR` is sufficient? That could be done within the doctesting framework.

On OS X 10.8.2.

Running with `sage -btp 1 ...`:

```
sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/tests/french_book/polynomes.py

  if code[q-1] == u'\\':

```

Running with `sage -btp 2 ...` — note the random (?) placement of the unicode warning:

```

Without the `import readline` statement, I got one nonrepeatable failure with `sage -btp 2 ...` (probably has nothing to do with readline, but have you seen this before?):

Except for the nonrepeatable failure, I see no difference with or without `import readline`.

That actually looks serious, I'll have a look.

That's before the doctester starts, so it's not our problem.

Is the `[[?1034h` control code gone when you remove `import readline`?
