CC:  @mantepse @tscrim

Add a function to compute the lattice of congruences.

This needs `principal_congruences_poset()` from #21861, easier to do after next beta.

Also add `is_regular` etc. to the index of functions.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22388

def congruences_lattice(self, labels='congruence'):
    r"""
    Return the lattice of congruences.

    A congruence of a lattice is a partition of elements to classes
    compatible with both meet- and join-operation; see :meth:`congruence`.
    Elements of the *congruence lattice* are congruences ordered by
    refinement; i.e. if every class of a congruence `\Theta` is
    contained in some class of `\Phi`, then `\Theta \le \Phi`
    in the congruence lattice.

    INPUT:

    - ``labels``, a string -- type of elements of resulting lattice

    OUTPUT:

    A distributive lattice.

    - If ``element_constructor='congruence'``, then elements of the
      result will be congruences given as
      :class:`sage.combinat.set_partition.SetPartition`.
    - If ``element_constructor='integers'``, result is a lattice on integers
      isomorphic to the congruence lattice.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: N5 = Posets.PentagonPoset()
        sage: CL = N5.congruences_lattice(); CL
        Finite lattice containing 5 elements
        sage: CL.atoms()
        [{{0}, {1}, {2, 3}, {4}}]
        sage: CL.coatoms()
        [{{0, 1}, {2, 3, 4}}, {{0, 2, 3}, {1, 4}}]

        sage: CL = C4.congruences_lattice(element_constructor='integer')
        sage: CL.is_isomorphic(Posets.BooleanLattice(3))
        True

Thanks.

There is still #22456 left for review. Then I want a function to check if a lattice is congruence normal (can be made from one-element lattice by Day's doubling constructions). I think that it will be the last one in this serie.
