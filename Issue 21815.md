This commit also added 'number_of_special_parts' and 'number_of_regular_parts' methods.

There is

```
+        EXAMPLES:
```

lacking a double colon and a blank line just after.

Please add doc also to the hidden methods.

Last line, you can remove the [ ]  inside the prod.

Do not use $ but backticks ```

Instead of the link to sciencedirect, use the doi role, something like

```
:doi:`10155/585dfdf5fd45`
```

No blankline between a def and the doc. This is bad:

```
+    def sum(self):
+        
+        """
```


Do not write "n == None" but "n is None"

* I fixed the documentation so that it builds. I misunderstood - I thought this ticket was set to need review. 
* I don't think you needed to include `int` in `int(self.n())` in the `__repr__` method (line 640)

Thanks for taking a look at this ticket. There's a bug in the code such that list(DescendingPlanePartitions(n)) gives some repeated elements and skips some elements. A fix is to add the line:

dpprow = copy(dpprow)

before all the other code in the _increment_row(dpp) method.

Also in the documentation, we should reference arxiv paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05779 for more information about Catalan DPPs.

I don't have time to work on this now, but I wanted to comment about those two things while I was thinking of it.

Hi `@`jessicapalencia can you give an example to reproduce the bug, I tried till n = 7 with and without adding line `dpprow = copy(dpprow)` but the output of `list(DescendingPlanePartitions(n))` was same.
