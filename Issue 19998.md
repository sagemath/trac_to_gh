We really should not suppress all warnings when compiling the Sage library. Many of these warnings point to genuine problems in the code.

Why have you removed the `-pedantic` flag from _m4ri_?

With `-pedantic` you get way too many useless warnings.

But that's only for the m4ri package, isn't it?

Anyway, it's fine with me.
