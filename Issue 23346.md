This is needed to preserve the order of irreducible components in doctests of the same file. It turns out to change the doctest order in the tutorials.

I do not quite understand why this is so, but this works.

I might be paranoid, but I feel like we are changing the behavior, and without understanding why it happens. Could it come from the fact that the defining ideals are using `__cmp__` but not rich comparisons? At least, this seems the most probable to me and might be something we need to do at the same time to be a proper fix.

Also, perhaps for the rich comparisons, maybe do a rich comparisons for the ambient space? Although this last idea feels more like overkill.

I am sorry about this. I want to try and make sure we do not break anything in subtle ways by these changes. As always, thank you for your progress on all of this.
