Keywords: graph drawing, edge labels

The following code should produce a drawing of the
Frucht graph with edges labeled 0 upto 17.
However, labels 16 and 17 are missing, while
15 is misplaced. The edge labels are set correctly
(as the last line shows), they only don't show up.
The weird thing is that other graphs work OK (at least those I tried).

{{
sage:   G=graphs.FruchtGraph()
sage:   E=G.edges()
sage:   for i in range(len(E)):
....:           G.set_edge_label(E[i][0],E[i][1],i)
....:
sage:   G.show(edge_labels=True)
sage:   print G.edges()
}}

It seems it happens rather rarely, so I'm not sure if it's 
an issue with this graph's constructor or with the graph drawing
algorithm. Anyway, it would be nice to have this feature reliable, 
I find it very useful.

This turns out to be because the edge label locations are computed by


```
[(self._pos[a][0]+self._pos[b][0])/2, (self._pos[a][1]+self._pos[b][1])/2]
```


so if the positions are Python integers (as happens for many of the graphs in graph_generators.py), the
divisions will truncate and the labels wind up in the wrong locations.

This can be fixed by replacing 2 with 2., but that's pretty fragile, as there are other instances in graph_plot.py
where it looks like the same problem can occur:


```
                    p1 = self._pos[a]
                    p2 = self._pos[b]
                    M = ((p1[0]+p2[0])/2, (p1[1]+p2[1])/2) # midpoint
                    if not p1[1] == p2[1]:
                        S = (p1[0]-p2[0])/(p2[1]-p1[1]) # perp slope
```


Moreover, since the user could be using a custom layout method, we
can't guarantee that the positions are floats on that side.  So it
seems the most robust solution is to ensure that _pos contains
floats in graph_plot itself.  This only takes between 1-10 ms for a graph
with 1000 nodes which takes seconds to plot, so the added time is
negligible.

I've attached a patch which

(1) modifies set_pos, which is always called by GraphPlot.__init__, to ensure
that _pos contains float values; this suffices to handle both the
original case and some related multiedge bugs

(2) float-protects real divisions throughout the file (some are
genuinely integer divisions meant to be truncating,
e.g. len(local_labels)/2, where dealing with the possible remainder of
1 is handled explicitly), even where I don't know for certain that 
there's a realized path which could break.  This way even if _pos
were somehow changed after construction, set_edges would still behave
as intended.

(3) adds doctests to set_pos, set_edges, and
_polar_hack_for_multidigraph to verify the new behaviour.  Coming up
with a doctest for set_edges was a bit of a challenge, so if there's
a more natural way to do the test it should probably be replaced.

(4) fixes a typo.

The patch passes all tests in graphs and beneath; am running testall long now.

Works for me with 4.6.2.rc0.  Still have the usual "Detected SAGE64" noise, etc., but no new failures.

Hello ! `:-)`

This can get in as soon as you can add another semicolumn at the end of
