#20885 added a Normaliz/PyNormaliz interface, providing a fast backend for polyhedra, and in particular implementations of the `integral_points` and `integral_hull` methods.

On follow-up tickets, should:
- provide fast implementations of existing methods of Polyhedron, Cone, triangulations, ...
- provide new methods for Normaliz's additional features.

Some features may already be exposed via polymake. 

Adding these methods would not require Cython programming and would happen on several separate tickets. All it takes is reading the [Normaliz manual](https://www.normaliz.uni-osnabrueck.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Normaliz3.1.1Documentation.pdf)

On this meta ticket, we collect all tickets related to normaliz.
