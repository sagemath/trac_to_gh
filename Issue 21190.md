This should now be ready for review, except for the root issue.

The problem with canonical labeling is that we use the canonical labelling of the **graph**, not the one of the tree. So we cannot assume that the root has number 0.

However, there is a canonical labeling for the tree, so it becomes a labeled ordered tree, which we can then get a unique plot. So something like this:

```python
        try:
            root = self.label()
            g = self.to_undirected_graph()
            return g.plot(layout='tree', tree_root=root, tree_orientation="down")
        except AttributeError:
            return self.canonical_labelling().plot()
```

I don't necessarily see why this wouldn't work, but maybe I'm missing something.

We should also changed the `show` to `plot` inside the method (which will re-introduce output).

I only see the unicode trees in the unicode art, so I am not surprised this doesn't make a difference. I think it would be something we'd need to setup with the pdf builder, and I think that's more trouble than its worth right now.
