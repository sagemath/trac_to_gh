Students often call these functions with strings. This results in an error like "str has no attribute parent":

```py
    336         """
    337         dom = self.domain()  # = plaintext_space = ciphertext_space
--> 338         if not isinstance(M, StringMonoidElement) and M.parent() == dom:
    339             raise TypeError("Argument M (= %s) must be a string in the plaintext/ciphertext space." % M)
    340         from sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod import Mod

AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'parent'
```

Note that it almost made it to raising a `TypeError` which would be tidier.

I get a permission error when trying to push though.
