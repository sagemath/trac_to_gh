Merged latest version of #17220 (without functions `matrix_to_acb_mat` and `acb_mat_to_matrix`) and adapted code.

Now that complex balls are fully implemented, it might make sense to do all computations in complex balls; this might lead to clearer code than the current mixture of complex intervals and direct calls to arb.
