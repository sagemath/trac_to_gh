In a forthcoming paper (Clemens Heuberger, Sara Kropf, and Helmut Prodinger, Asymptotic analysis of the sum of the output of transducers), we study the sum of output of a transducer when reading a random non-negative integer up to a certain N. Under suitable conditions, it has a periodic fluctuation in the second order term. In that paper, we compute the Fourier coefficients of this periodic fluctuation. This ticket shall hold the corresponding Sage code.

Merged latest version of #17220 (without functions `matrix_to_acb_mat` and `acb_mat_to_matrix`) and adapted code.

Now that complex balls are fully implemented, it might make sense to do all computations in complex balls; this might lead to clearer code than the current mixture of complex intervals and direct calls to arb.
