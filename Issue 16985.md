In a forthcoming paper (Clemens Heuberger, Sara Kropf, and Helmut Prodinger, Asymptotic analysis of the sum of the output of transducers), we study the sum of output of a transducer when reading a random non-negative integer up to a certain N. Under suitable conditions, it has a periodic fluctuation in the second order term. In that paper, we compute the Fourier coefficients of this periodic fluctuation. This ticket shall hold the corresponding Sage code.

In commit [27080b5](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=27080b5dc54b5b4183f4ebe947b21efd45416ebf) "`Trac #17198: Rewrote methods .min and .max to handle more than two elements`" in #17198, the proposed functions `min_RIF` and `max_RIF` are removed. This needs to be merged into this ticket and the code in this ticket has to be adapted accordingly. I refrain from doing so as long as the fate of the patch in #17198 is not clear.

All tests pass, the documentation is fine for me and the code corresponds to the results in the original paper. From my side, this is a positive review.

Merged latest version of #17220 (without functions `matrix_to_acb_mat` and `acb_mat_to_matrix`) and adapted code.

Now that complex balls are fully implemented, it might make sense to do all computations in complex balls; this might lead to clearer code than the current mixture of complex intervals and direct calls to arb.
