`tox` seems to be the preferred interface for running tests - see for example https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/931 (deprecation of `setup.py test`).

We should create a `tox` plugin (https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html)
- for testing `sagelib` (as an alternative to `sage -t`)
- for users' packages that depend on sage.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28936

I don't know what you mean by "preferred interface" here.  There isn't really any such thing as a preferred interface.  It's just being proposed here as a recommendation over `setup.py test`.  Sage doesn't use `setup.py test` anyways so there's nothing that needs to be "replaced" with a different interface if/when `setup.py` goes away.

The main advantage to tox is the ability to run a package's tests across multiple runtime environments (esp. different Python versions).  This isn't really possible currently with Sage; it would actually be very difficult to use tox in any sensible manner with Sage.

If someone wants to do this anyways I don't see the harm really, but I'm not sure what problem it would be solving.

FWIW, I managed to use `tox` on top of the sage installation, see https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage-numerical-backends-gurobi/blob/master/tox.ini: The trick is to run `tox` with `sitepackages = true` and an `install_command` that installs into the user scheme.
