# Issue 33984: Backport PEP420 namespace package support from Cython 3

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34221

After #33011, downstream packages that use Cython and `cimport` Sage modules need to activate PEP 420 namespace package support in Cython using `with cython_namespace_package_support` (as is done in https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/setup.py#L106 for sagelib).

This feature is standard in the upcoming Cython 3. Until downstream packages are updated, we can patch our Cython.

This solved all of the problems that I ran into with the p_group_cohomology and sage_numerical_backends_coin packages.  The problems were caused by cython not finding the .pxd files that were needed for cimport statements.  With this patch the cimports worked and I got a successful build of 9.7.beta6 on an arm64 mac with a minimal environment.

This works for me and also fixes the problems with `sage_numerical_backends_coin`. `p_group_cohomology` still fails for me ("ld: library not found for -lmodres"), for what that's worth.

Changing priority from critical to blocker.

`@`jhpalmieri - the p_group_cohomology issue can be fixed by adding a symlink.
See [this message](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/KCu_VuBwjgg/m/fNhn6wtWAgAJ) on sage-devel.

Thank you, I added that link to the discussion at #30787.

For my information, is this needed to build sage now? Or will it be needed once we split sagelib for real?


---

It's not needed for building sagelib, but it is needed for building other packages as described in the ticket description


---

For downstream packages, yes. But I am assuming that once we split sagelib, the modules may need it too - but that's in the future.

The modularized packages such as `sagemath-objects` don't need it because they use `with cython_namespace_package_support` just like the monolithic sagelib does.

Thank you for answering my pesky questions.
