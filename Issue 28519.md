When Gurobi is the default your branch also fixes many other failures:


```
sage -t --optional=sage,optional,external src/sage/numerical/linear_functions.pyx src/sage/numerical/linear_tensor.py src/sage/numerical/linear_tensor_constraints.py  src/sage/numerical/linear_tensor_element.pyx  src/sage/numerical/mip.pyx
```


Let me update the description of the ticket.
