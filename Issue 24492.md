First of all, it's a more standard way to configure things. But one real advantage is that you only need to set this once when running `./configure` initially. With this ticket, once you ran `./configure --with-python=2` you can just run `make` without needing to remember to set `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`.

No, I would say that `--with...` is the right thing to use, because Python is a dependency, rather than a feature of Sage. `--with...` does not require an argument. And we can reserve the use of an argument for future use (such as working with a distribution's Python rather than our own).

Hm, well, I thought you might say that. But the configuration of sage-the-distribution does also affect sagelib (configuration is somehow passed through); it does not just make one or the other version of python available for sagelib to find.

Also, in light of various efforts to use system packages when available I could imagine that one day sage-the-distribution could skip installing its copy of Python and then `--with-python3=/usr/bin/python3.5.77` would make sense.

For that one I would suggest something like `--with-build-python` to disambiguate.

First of all, I'd say `--with-python=2`  just looks odd to the trained configure-user's eye, one would expect to see `--with-python=python2` or perhaps `--with-python-version=2`.

Not sure if the following will make sense, but perhaps a difference to BLAS is that Python exists as an executable.
