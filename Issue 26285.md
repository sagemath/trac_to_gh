(split off of #26449)

With a Python 3 build of Sage, Sphinx omits large chunks of the autodoc documentation. Perhaps it is related to classes containing subclasses. For example, in `sage.algebras.commutative_dga`, we have

```

class GCAlgebra(UniqueRepresentation, QuotientRing_nc):

    ...

    class Element(QuotientRingElement):

        ...

```

With Python 2, methods directly within `GCAlgebra` appear, as do those in `Element`. With Python 3, only the top-level documentation for the `GCAlgebra` class is present: no methods are included at all. Within the same file, the methods for the class `GCAlgebraHomset` all appear, in both Python 2 and Python 3.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26522

This is important to fix; otherwise, the Python 3 build of the reference manual will be very incomplete, missing methods from every class that inherits from `CachedRepresentation`. I also have no idea how to fix it.

This is probably what `@`jhpalmieri was indicating. Under `Special Methods for Classes`

Correct doc

```
class sage.misc.classcall_metaclass.ClasscallMetaclass
Bases: sage.misc.nested_class.NestedClassMetaclass

A metaclass providing support for special methods for classes.
```


Incorrect with python3

```
 sage.misc.classcall_metaclass.ClasscallMetaclass

    A metaclass providing support for special methods for classes.
```

And perhaps other places.

For another illustration, navigate in the reference manual by choosing `Categories` and then `Sets`. The documentation for the class `Sets` in the Python 2 build includes lots of methods (for example 
[`an_element`](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/categories/sage/categories/sets_cat.html#sage.categories.sets_cat.Sets.ParentMethods.an_element)), but the documentation for the Python 3 build only has the top-level docstring.

This is what actually causes the documentation to fail to build with Python 3: a cross-reference to "facade-sets" points to [what becomes omitted](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/categories/sage/categories/sets_cat.html#sage.categories.sets_cat.Sets.SubcategoryMethods.Facade) in the Python 3 build of the documentation.

Another data point. With Python3 numerous entries in inventory `objects.inv` files are assigned different sphinx directives from those assigned with Python2. For example, in the `objects.inv` file under `local/share/doc/sage/inventory/en/reference/misc` the entry

```
sage.misc.classcall_metaclass.ClasscallMetaclass sage/misc/classcall_metaclass.html#sage.misc.classcall_metaclass.ClasscallMetaclass
```

is assigned the `py:class` directive when using Python2 but the `py:attribute` directive when using Python3. I assume this will affect how things appear in `html` docs.


```
python -m sphinx.ext.intersphinx objects.inv | less
```

to view the file contents.

That's interesting. I don't understand anything about how Sphinx generates the inventory files. I've tried poking around, but I'm not getting anywhere.

I'll be interested in your comments. It probably would have been better to have the commits in this location but so be it. The html-docs do build for me but I haven't been able to view them. I do notice some `DeprecationWarning`s that I don't believe were present with python 2, things like

```
