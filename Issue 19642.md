The file `src/sage/rings/arith.py` contains a bunch of "arithmetic" functions. I think this does not really belong in `rings` but in a new top-level directory. Eventually, we should move some more files there but we start with just the file `arith.py`.

I think that for the continuation `continued_fraction` should also move.

Do you mind waiting the next release cycle for starting moving things around?

> Do you mind waiting the next release cycle for starting moving things around?

On the contrary, I think that going to a new major release (6.10 -> 7.0) is a very good time to move things around.

But eventually that is the decision of the release manager and it should not affect reviewing this ticket.

Volker, this patch changes a lot of code in Sage. So, in order to avoid endless merge conflicts, would it be possible to either merge this still in 7.0 or very early in 7.1? Thanks.

Sorry to comment on a closed ticket, but was anything done to move the documentation for the file arith.py somewhere?  I cannot find it.  Maybe it was never in the reference manual anyway?

I am interested in this since in #19887 I add a new file file sage/arith which has documentation which I want to be in the ref man.
