Keywords: symbolic expressions simplification cancelation

Sage assumes all symbolic variables are non-zero at all times when doing automatic simplifications. 

For example:

```
sage: var('x')
sage: sin(x)/sin(x)
1
```


Or even more explicitly:


```
sage: var('x')
x
sage: assume(x==0)
sage: bool(x==0)
True
sage: x/x
1
```
