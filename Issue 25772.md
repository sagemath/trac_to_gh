I think the use of double backticks in the docstring is wrong.

this should also implement the derivative method for `BooleanFunction`

FYI this is my first time reviewing a ticket so i would appreciate if someone else could have a look on this

i added the input tests from the derivative method for boolean functions to the one for sboxes and also improved both of the docstrings a bit

Good point. Your changes LGTM.
I guess you are fine with the rest?

Normally (as in: most of the time) the reviewer just writes his or her comments in the trac discussion here and the initial author then reworks his patch in his branch.

Yes I am. So i can change the status to positive review, right?

Yes. And you would also add yourself to the reviewers (which I already did).
