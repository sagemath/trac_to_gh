Funny thing. The function is finding the correct answer, but does not know when to stop, and can be lead (for instance on the example given in [1]) to replace a best answer of 3 by a 4.

I am not satisfied with this patch, because the "right way" would be to use a goto to leave two loops at once. Yeah, goto are useful sometimes. So instead I added a "if" to leave the second loop. This could have been solved differently, for instance by replacing ``best = depth*2`` by ``best = min(best, 2*depth)``, but I thought more sensible to avoid reading the graph structure as much as possible, which is much harder than testing an easy constraint.
Well. It was a funny one. And I really could have used a GOTO statement there `:-)`

Installation, tests, docbuild and functionality on graphs are OK.

However, I don't understand the behavior for digraphs. What should be the correct answer for a digraph with a pair of symmetric arcs? For instance, for the digraph with arc set [(0,1),(1,0),(1,2),(2,0)], the girth is 2 or 3? and what if the digraph has loops?

Well, 1 if there is a loop in the graph, and 2 if there is a pair of symmetric arcs.

The point is that the patch currently returns another value :(

For instance, the de Bruijn digraph of degree 2 and diameter 3 has both loops and pairs of symmetric arcs, but the returned value is 3...

Well, "the patch" does not really return another value. The current Sage function returns another value, and this patch just fixes another bug `:-P`

But you are right, let us also fix that with this patch.
