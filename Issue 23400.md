Thank you; I wasn't aware of this ticket.

I'm reopening this ticket to server as ticket for solution 1 as described in https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/_2vtRbauvrw . I.e. just fix the doctest in pynormaliz itself and not rely on #23586 where the approach is making the doctest framework more robust, which might take longer then we want to wait for.

I'm going to see if your branch is actually a solution and wether `__cmp__` is deterministic. I suspect not and then this is not really a fix.


---

Comment by mderickx created at 2017-08-29 16:42:08

I just had a look, and as far as I can see it doesn't use `__cmp__` but it has `__ge__` and friends. And furthermore that these are not overwritten but all inherited from object , and hence not deterministic.


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2017-08-29 16:54:29

I agree that my branch is not a solution. Please write one.

Ok, made the doctests deterministic

PEP8: `key = str)` -> `key=str)`. Otherwise LGTM and we can finally have these tests being deterministic.

Hi Volker,

Could you be a bit more specific, which tickets cause the conflict. Or will there be a new beta4 soon on which I can rebase this. Because this message is not helping.

Comment by chapoton created at 2017-08-30 07:04:28

Be patient, You just need to wait for the next beta (end of the week ?).

I believe it uses sets because there is no (natural) ordering on that output. However, I do not know if normaliz and our code has any guarantee on the output order. Maybe Matthias can comment more on this.

Well, clearly `set()` doesn't solve that problem...


---

Comment by mderickx created at 2017-08-31 15:16:06

Yes we might not need set, but we do need know whether the output orderering albeit being arbitrary, is still deterministic at least. Because if it is not deterministic this still means we have flaky doctests and still need to sort.

Yes, the order of the output has no significance and to my understanding can change from version to version of normaliz.
I used `set(...)` in the doctest, based on the misconception that this is the correct idiom. I now understand that I should have used `sorted(...)` instead. I do not agree with the current patch, which just uses the unsorted output as is.

That's actually not bad at all. There are many doctests which depend on the _version_ of a package. If the output is consistent for any given version, it is fine to put that output in the doctest.

Comment by mderickx created at 2017-09-01 13:43:24

I also just verified experimentally that the doctests are stable within a version by running:


```
./sage -t --file-iterations=100 src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/backend_normaliz.py
```


so I agree with Jeroen that his branch solves the main problem of this ticket, namely make the results of the patchbot reliable again. So positive review from me.

I understand that having doctests pass for multiple normaliz versions is something nice to have since it makes it easier to upgrade normaliz. But let's fix that problem for during the next upgrade of normaliz and not waste any more time on this ticket so that we can get consistent patchbot behaviour again.

Comment by tscrim created at 2017-09-01 13:44:20

Thank you for the explanation Matthias. However, I agree with Jeroen: the output is deterministic on the version of normaliz (which is bound to the Sage version by our current distribution methods, for better or worse), so directly comparing the output is good and clean as it does not require any extra modification to pass. Another package that we frequently have to update tests for is GAP.

...and PARI/GP.

The doctest framework does support `# tol` for numerical differences but not `# generates same group` or whatever for number-theoretical output

No objections here.
