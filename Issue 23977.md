This is because there was no consensus that  LinBox should default to the deterministic version of the algorithm.

Right. It is not completely unreasonable. However it has consequence for sage-on-distro, where the linbox maintainer may prefer to leave linbox "vanilla" instead of patching it the sage way. Is there an issue opened for the switching version or a branch open where I and my fellow sage-on-distro maintainer can follow progress on that work?

You introduced a TAB in `linbox_flint_interface.pyx`.

More dramatic, on the following doctests my computer get stuck and finally segfault

```
for _ in range(100):

Replying to [comment:29 jdemeyer]:
> I seem to be getting a consistent timeout on `src/sage/modular/modform/ambient.py`

Confirmed. This seems to hang forever:

```
sage: t = ModularForms(1, 512)._compute_hecke_matrix(5); t.charpoly()
```

Note: the matrix has size only 43x43 but it has very large coefficients.

Isn't it the same problem as in ticket:17635#comment:178 : a bug in debian gcc ?
It was fixed in the previous fflas-ffpack spkg. Maybe the fix was removed in the refactorization of the spkg commands ?
The fix could be to either pass -fpermissive to gcc or require to use sage's gcc (version >4.9.2)

Ok, sorry, I got confused.
Indeed I removed this section from `fflas_ffpack/spkg-install` since the fix upstream now fixes it.
However, the `-fpermissive` flag was not exported to the `pkgconfig --cflags` list, hence LinBox did not see use it.
I pushed a patch in this branch and this is fixed upstream too.
