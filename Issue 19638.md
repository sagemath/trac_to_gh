I'm not sure if this is the ticket for it, but just regarding building the documentation, it would help to just point to mathjax's latest version in the CDN. Maybe, that could be an option, set by an env variable? But I have no idea how this is setup right now and how hard it would be to make the URL of mathjax dynamic.

My life for SageMathCell definitely got easier after switching to CDN - not only I get automatic updates, but I also have a complete version of MathJax including image fonts which are necessary in some campus-wide (mis)configurations, but cannot be added to Sage because each documentation folder has to have a copy I was told...

> At the same time, notebook + docs should work without internet access...

oh yes, I'm proposing to have an optional env variable, e.g. SMC_MATHJAX_URL, that's used instead of the default. I have no idea how hard this would be, but it would help in this case here -- i.e. I'm talking about the published doc.sagemath.org site, which obviously requires a working internet to view :-)
