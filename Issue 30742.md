# Issue 30742: Remove duplication of options handled in src/bin/sage and build/bin/sage-site

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30979

Original creator: mkoeppe

(from #30846)

Why are lines like

```
if [ "$1" = '-optional' -o "$1" = "--optional" ]; then
    shift
    exec sage-list-packages optional $@
fi
```

in both `src/bin/sage` and `build/bin/sage-site`?
