First of all, the name `is_extension_type` is misleading: it _actually_ tests whether instances of the class have a `__dict__`. While extension types usually don't and Python classes usually do, in both cases the opposite is possible.

Moreover, it is used in only one place (namely to determine whether to use actual inheritance from the category for `Element` classes). And this usage is there mostly for historical reasons (see also #24715).
