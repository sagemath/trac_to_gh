# Issue 29443: Fix checksums: print both package name and tarball name

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29680

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2020-05-13 03:12:30

Currently:

```
% ./sage --package fix-checksum sage_brial
Checksum of brial-1.2.5.tar.bz2 unchanged
```

or

```
% ./sage --package fix-checksum sage_brial
Updating checksum of brial-1.2.8.tar.bz2
```

This ticket proposes changing the message to

```
Checksum of sage_brial (tarball brial-1.2.5.tar.bz2) unchanged
```

or

```
Updating checksum of sage_brial (tarball brial-1.2.8.tar.bz2)
```

The string "Updating checksum" also appears in `build/sage_bootstrap/cmdline.py`

And "Checksum of .* unchanged" also in `build/test/test_package_cmdline.py`

found using `git grep`
