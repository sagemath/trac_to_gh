The doctest should be

```
# optional - gdb
```

Done.

Shouldn't the default value here be `'yes'`?

```
    if os.environ.get('SAGE_DEBUG', None) != 'no':
```

I don't think it is recommended to compare None with equality operators.

No, see #13881

I think this should be a blocker for sage-5.10. Shipping with broken --gdb just makes debugging needlessly complicated.

Changing priority from major to blocker.
