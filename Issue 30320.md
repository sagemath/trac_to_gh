I do not know autotools well enough to review this, but on my Ubuntu machine lacking libssl-dev, this now seems to work:

```
configure: notice: the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages: ... openssl ...
checking for the package system in use... debian
configure: hint: installing the following system packages is recommended and may avoid building some of the above SPKGs from source:
configure:   $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install ... openssl libssl-dev ...
```
