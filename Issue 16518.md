Given that PPL natively works with rationals, this should work:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="PPL")
sage: x = p.new_variable(nonnegative=True)
sage: p.add_constraint(x[0] + x[1] <= 1/2)
sage: p.set_objective(x[0])
sage: p.solve()

Can't this be taken care of entirely in `PPLBackend.init_mip()` ?

For constraints, probably yes. For the objective function not (since you need to scale the optimal solution also).
