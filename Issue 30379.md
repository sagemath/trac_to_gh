This helps with the modularization of sagelib.

We demonstrate its use by simplifying:
- `sage.groups.braid` (which depends on the optional library `libbraiding` via `sage.libs.libbraiding`). Actually a standard package
- `sage.sat.solvers.cryptominisat`, `.picosat`
- `sage.matrix.matrix_space` (`meataxe`)
- `sage.graphs.graph` (`tdlib`, `mcqd`)

This simplification helps eliminate the use of `sage.misc.package.PackageNotFoundError`.  See #30607.

Yes, see `build/pkgs/libbraiding/type` which you can either
check with this command:

```
$ cat build/pkgs/libbraiding/type
standard
```
or by viewing that file online:
- https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/build/pkgs/libbraiding/type

This happened in

- #25705 Make libhomfly and libbraiding standard packages

which was merged in Sage 8.4.beta0.

Thanks.

Can we do something for the pyflakes issues or is it the prize to pay for lazy import ?
