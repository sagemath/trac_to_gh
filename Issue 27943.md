In the LaTeX output, the entire contents of the dictionary are now wrapped in big curly braces, as I don't know how to add them only to the first and last line (`\left\{ ... \right.` will not work, since there's a `&` in between) - besides, their sizes may not match, which could be ugly. I guess we could have a horizontal layout if the dictionary could fit in a line, but I don't know how to check it (and it may be part of a longer line anyway, thus requiring line breaks).

I will also add sorting for sets. This will require adding a new function to handle Python sets.

I have now reverted the layout changes in LaTeX representation of dictionaries, instead wrapping key-value pairs in `{...}`, as suggested by Aram. Sorting is now also applied to Python's `set`s and `frozenset`s and Sage's finite `Set`s (for which the representation is the same as for `set`s, except when the `Set` is empty).
