Keywords: plane partitions

For some plane partitions PP, the method PP.is_SPP() was giving false positives and for some others it was giving an error (index out of range). This was fixed by copying the z-tableau into a new square table. New test cases were added to both is_SPP() and is_SSCPP().

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28253
