As reported in [this sage devel thread](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/uMWxBzIc33Y/m/lkjQu8IMAwAJ), `integrate` can give wrong answers (or crash) when an integral involves `real_part` or `imag_part`.  Here is a simple example:

```
sage: c = var("c")
sage: assume(c, "complex")
sage: integrate(real_part(c), (x, 0, 1))                      # wrong answer
c
sage: integrate(imag_part(c), (x, 0, 1))                      # wrong answer
0
sage: integrate(real_part(c), (x, 0, 1), algorithm="sympy")   # correct
real_part(c)
sage: integrate(imag_part(c), (x, 0, 1), algorithm="sympy")   # correct
imag_part(c)
sage: integrate(real_part(c), (x, 0, 1), algorithm="giac")    # wrong answer
c
sage: integrate(imag_part(c), (x, 0, 1), algorithm="giac")    # wrong answer
0
sage: integrate(real_part(c), (x, 0, 1), algorithm="maxima")  # crash

   1703             if op in sage_op_dict:

   1706             sage_op_dict[op]=op_max

RuntimeError: Encountered operator mismatch in maxima-to-sr translation
```

Here is a quick description of what seems to be happening. Sagemath asks maxima to do the integral. Maxima gets the correct answer, but the interface crashes (`RuntimeError`) when trying to convert the lisp expression to python. Sagemath thinks that maxima was unable to do the integral, so it asks giac to try. Giac gets the wrong answer, because it does not know that the parameter `c` is complex. This wrong answer is returned by sage. 

This ticket will fix the maxima interface, and another ticket will fix the giac interface. The behaviour is reproduced in 9.1 on `CoCalc`, so these are not new bugs.

Here is a more detailed description of the maxima problem. I know very little about lisp/maxima, but there seems to be confusion between two lisp variables `<ecl $realpart>` and `<ecl $%realpart>`. (I think `<ecl $realpart>` is the maxima variable/function `REALPART`, but I don't know why `<ecl $%realpart>` shows up.) Apparently, there is some kind of incompatibility between `sr_to_max` and `max_to_sr`.

At the time the `RuntimeError` exception is raised, `op_max` is `%REALPART` (which I think is the same as `<ECL: $%REALPART>`) and `max_op_dict` contains the entry `<ECL: $REALPART>: real_part`. Since `op_max` is not in the dictionary, sagemath thinks it should add the entry `real_part: <ECL: $%REALPART>` to the reverse dictionary `sage_op_dict`. However, this conflicts with the entry `real_part: <ECL: $REALPART>` that is already in `sage_op_dict`, so a `RuntimeError` is raised.

The maxima problem can be eliminated by changing `maxima='realpart'` to `maxima='%realpart'` in 

```
GinacFunction.__init__(self, "real_part",
                               conversions=dict(maxima='realpart',
                                                 sympy='re',
                                                 giac='re'),
                                alt_name="real")
```
in the file `src/sage/functions/other.py`, and also making a similar change for `imagpart`. After these edits:

```
sage: c = var("c")
sage: assume(c, "complex")
sage: integrate(real_part(c), (x, 0, 1))
real_part(c)
sage: integrate(imag_part(c), (x, 0, 1))
imag_part(c)
sage: integrate(real_part(c), (x, 0, 1), algorithm="maxima")
real_part(c)
sage: integrate(imag_part(c), (x, 0, 1), algorithm="maxima")
imag_part(c)
```
However, this is not the correct solution, because it causes doctest failures:

```
