you're removing Gygwin stuff. Are you sure it's OK?

Yes because I removed the _calls_ to those functions. That is what point 2 in the ticket description achieves.

Perhaps a stupid question, sorry, but is there any reason to use this implementation instead of [the one in arb](http://arblib.org/partitions.html#c.partitions_fmpz_fmpz)?

IMO, it is not a bad thing to have redundancy checking with independent implementations.

naturally, we can have several backends to computing a function. Patches are welcome.
