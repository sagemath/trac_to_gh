Keywords: substitution, adic, symbolic dynamics

An adic language is a symbolic counterpart to the renormalization in dynamics and generalize what are called "substitution fixed point" (roughly implemented in sage/combinat/words/). Such kind of languages are described by an infinite sequence of substitutions and many algorithms exist
 * enumeration of words of length n
 * enumeration of left/right special factors
 * synchronization delays
 * ...

Particular cases should be consider apart:
 * Sturmian languages
 * Interval Exchange Transformations
 * Free Group Automorphisms
 * ...
