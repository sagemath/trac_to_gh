straightforward; the version is obtained from the header.
No need to put any prefixes anywhere.

For some reason, Sage has version 1.5.2, but header says 1.6.0.
Debian (packsge libmpfi-dev) has 1.5.3, and the header says the same.

Clearly a question for upstream.

regarding the version, I just check that the version is at least 1.5.
