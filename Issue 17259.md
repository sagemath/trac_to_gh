Implement methods of hyperplane arrangement to determine which k a hyperplane arrangement is k-generated and formality of the arrangement.

I called the method to determine the minimal `k` `minimal_generated_number`, but I'm not sure this is the best name, so suggestions welcomed.

Thanks Frédéric; I had completely forgotten about this. Your changes are good with me. Are you able to finish the review?

Is this a definition:

```
+        A hyperplane arrangement is *formal* if it is 3-generated as
+        defined in :meth:`minimal_generated_number`.
```

If yes, this should be stated, and with a ref.
