Keywords: modular forms Hecke triangle groups

An attempt to implement modular forms for Hecke triangle groups.

The current implementation and further details can be found at:

https://github.com/jjermann/hecke_mf

This is a prelimenary ticket.
There is no branch yet and there are still obvious things missing:

- This is my first contribution to sage, so I'm not familiar yet with
  all aspects/conventions. E.g. some function/class names should probably be changed.

- I used an unfinnished/stub implementation for the Hecke triangle group.
  This is probably not a big issue since it is mostly used as a simple container for data anyway.

- I already added doctests for the two core files "abstract_ring.py"
  and "graded_ring_element.py". But the remaining files still lack doctests.

- Some mathematical definitions might be problematic resp. require rewording.

- I ran into some issues with sage components which forced me to
  use "less elegant" solutions (that still "work" though).
  Especially with the pushout construction of sage,
  I think there are some problems with it.

- ... "Other issues"

The aim of this ticket is mainly to get some general feedback
before I continue working on it:

- Is the general design ok/acceptable?

- What parts are ok and what parts should I (try to) change (and how)?

- Suggestions? Requests?

- If it is generally fine: Should I already create a branch?
  Is "sage/modular/hecke_mf" a good place?
