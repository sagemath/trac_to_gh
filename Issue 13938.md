After #12507, one could make simplicial complexes immutable in order for them to be hashable. However there was no functionality to make mutable copies.

This looks pretty good. I think it should be documented in one more place, maybe in the top-level docstring, in the mutability section, say around line 133.

I've added the doctests you requested.

Best,

Great. Change "a mutable copies" (line 135) and I'll give it a positive review.

Done. I also changed the hash test to a better formatted test.
