CC:  @drkwang @slel @orlitzky

Instead of full packaging of CGAL started in #18197, in this ticket we create a script package for CGAL just to record system package information. Likewise we create a script package for swig, which is needed for building Python bindings.

We create a normal package for `cgal-swig-bindings`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31098

The tarball can not be pushed because git ignored the upstream folder, where the tarball is stored. This tarball basically comes from compressing those files under the CGAL/cgal-swig-bindings repository and I change it a little bit. I will update the checksums.ini file and add `upstream_url` to it later, but I am not sure what platform I should upload it to.

I tried it with `cmake --find-package -DNAME=CGAL -DLANGUAGE=C -DCOMPILER_ID=GNU -DMODE=COMPILE` and it returned `-I/usr/local/include` instead of what we expect --`/usr/local/opt/cgal/lib/cmake/CGAL`.
