A temporary workaround is to just do 

```
touch /usr/local/sage/devel/sage-main/doc/en/reference/rings_padic.rst
```

(or whatever the path is to rings_padic.rst) and then things continue fine.

I think we just need to remove the existing output directory before building the documentation.

Also, we should remove all of the autogenerated files in devel/sage/doc/en/reference/sage .
