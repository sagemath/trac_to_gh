# Issue 15687: Allow non-hashable output labels in FiniteStateMachine.prepone_output

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: cheuberg

Original creation time: 2014-03-12 13:01:54

Keywords: finite_state_machine

Previously, non-hashable output labels led to errors in
`sage.combinat.finite_state_machine.FiniteStateMachine.prepone_output`.
This is now corrected.
