Keywords: compare pi infinity bool

We have 

```
sage: bool(pi<Infinity)
False
sage: bool(pi>Infinity)
True
```

which is obviously wrong. It seems that the problem only occurs with `pi`, because the following give correct results

```
sage: bool(pi<2*pi)
True
sage: bool(2*pi<Infinity)
True
sage: bool(e<Infinity)  
True
sage: bool(e<pi)
True
```

ATM, this is caused by #11506:


```
sage: pi.pyobject()
pi
sage: type(pi.pyobject())
<class 'sage.symbolic.constants.Pi'>
sage: pi.pyobject() < oo        
False
sage: pi.pyobject() > oo
True
```


With #12950,  comparison of infinities in Pynac changed. Now I get:


```
sage: bool(pi>Infinity)
False
sage: bool(pi<Infinity) 
False
```


which is better. I hope with the ordering patches in the Pynac queue this will improve.

The results of comparison with `e` is not relevant in this case. `e` is not a constant in Pynac, it is the `exp()` function. Once you form the relational expression `e < Infinity`, the comparison is handled differently.

I suggest adding a patch with doctests reflecting the new behavior with #12950 and closing this ticket when #12950 is merged.

I agree.  This comparison is apparently done by Pynac.  Using Maxima gives the correct result:

```
sage: e = (SR(pi) < SR(Infinity)); e
pi < +Infinity
sage: bool(e)
False
sage: maxima(e)
%pi<inf
sage: bool(maxima(e))
True
```

(This is not fixed by #11506, by the way.)

You will understand this all cannot be part of this ticket.

It was wrong to always raise an exception when an interval was compared. The reason why `pi in RIF` was `True` rather lies in `structure.parent.py:Parent.contains()` where the line

```
EQ = (x2 == x)
```

didn't account for symbolics and should read

```
EQ = bool(x2 == x)
```

This uncovers another bug in `Expression.nonzero()` which shows as

```
sage: bool(sqrt(2)==CC(sqrt(2)))
False
```

because `sqrt(2) == 1.41421356237309` is `False`. Any ideas how to fit this in the current code?

Reboot. This branch has clean logic handling all relations that can be decided without Maxima. I have left in the call to Pynac's `relational_to_bool` although it could possibly replaced too. The branch depends on #17984.

However, there is one doctest failure:

Failed example:
    pi in RIF # there is no element of RIF equal to pi

```

It is caused because `Parent.__contains__` assumes wrongly that all
equations that are of type `Expression` must be true, and `pi == RIF(pi)` isn't.
In develop this is masked by code catching all kinds of exceptions that hides the fact that the conversion of the relation to Maxima throws an exception.

But currently the precision is already taken care of in this way:

```
sage: pi.n(10) in RR
True
sage: pi.n(100) in RealField(50)
True
```

Isn't this what you want to keep as the correct behaviour?

In fact, `bool(pi == pi.n())` already returns `True`, which I think is reasonable.  In any case it is consistent with how elements of real fields of different precisions are compared.

The question is whether we also want to use this for `x in RR`.  I currently cannot think of a natural way of implementing this.

Maybe we should discourage users from using `x in RR`.  There is the following alternative:

```
sage: pi.is_real()
True
```

Not at all; I often find that a good first step towards fundamentally fixing a bug is trying to *remove* hacks that someone else put in to make a specific example work.

I disagree that no good model presents itself; defining `x in P` as `bool(P(x) == x)` seems like a good programming model to me, since it is simple and predictable.

The more I think about it, the more the fundamental problem does not seem to be membership testing, but *comparison* between real numbers defined in different approximations of the real numbers.  Do we want `RR(sqrt(2))` to be equal to `SR(sqrt(2))` or not?  And what about `RR(1/3)` and `QQ(1/3)`?

Pynac git master has a fix that does this:

```
sage: bool(SR(oo) > 5)
True
sage: bool(5 < SR(oo))
True
sage: bool(SR(2)<Infinity)
True
sage: bool(pi<Infinity)
True
sage: bool(pi>Infinity)
False
sage: bool(2*pi<Infinity)
True
sage: bool(SR(pi) < SR(Infinity))
True
sage: bool(sqrt(2)<oo)
True
sage: bool(log(2)<oo)
True
sage: bool(e<oo)
True
sage: bool(e+pi<oo)
True
sage: bool(e^pi<oo)
True
sage: bool(SR(2)<-oo)
False
sage: bool(SR(2)>-oo)
True
sage: bool(exp(2)>-oo)
True
sage: bool(SR(oo) > sqrt(2))
True
sage: bool(sqrt(2) < SR(oo))
True
sage: bool(SR(-oo) < sqrt(2))
True
sage: bool(sqrt(2) > SR(-oo))
True
```

It uses info flags and evalf where applicable. Some function info flags were introduced earlier in Pynac.
