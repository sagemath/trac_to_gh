Wild ass guess: this should be testing `HyperbolicPlane().UHP()` and not `HyperbolicPlane().PD()`. The former stands for Upper Half Plane, the latter for Poincare Disk.

Indeed, that test is only valid for the UHP, but that method is already being tested. Here, we should test that the absolute value is at most 1 to test in the PD model.
