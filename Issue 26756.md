Keywords: function field

In the new function field code (Trac #22982), you currently can't multiply function field elements with differentials from a subfield.

For example, in this basic setup:


```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ); R.<y> = K[]
sage: L.<y> = K.extension(y^2 - x*y + 4*x^3)
```


`y * y.differential()` works, but `y * x.differential()` doesn't, because there's no way to multiply an element of `L` with a differential from `K`.

The code attached to this ticket fixes that problem.

> 

No, nested fields don't work right.  For example,


```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: R.<y> = K[]
sage: L.<y> = K.extension(y^2 - x)
sage: R.<z> = L[]
sage: M.<z> = L.extension(z^2 - y)

sage: M.space_of_differentials()(x.differential())
d(y)
```



Part of the reason for this is that the element constructor (without applying this ticket) doesn't work the way I'd expect:


```
sage: K.space_of_differentials()(x)
d(x)
sage: L.space_of_differentials()(x)
d(x)
sage: M.space_of_differentials()(x)
d(y)
```


What is the rationale for expressing differentials in extensions w.r.t. the generator of the field immediately underneath the extension?  Should there be some way to express differentials w.r.t the rational function field under all of the extensions?

I'm thinking that the result of `M.space_of_differentials()(x)` should be `d(x)` and the differentials should all be expressed w.r.t the base rational function field.  Otherwise, if they're expressed w.r.t. the first underlying field, then the result of `M.space_of_differentials()(x)` should be `2 y d(y)`.

Should the user be able to select which variable is used to express differentials?

For my application, I either want to express differentials w.r.t the base rational function field, or w.r.t. a local uniformizing variable at a specific place.

I'd like to hear some feedback on what klee (and others) think.

Currently Sage only supports differentials of global function fields (and rational function fields). 

So you may need to enlarge the class of function fields that differentials are supported before you work on this ticket. Or you may clarify the cases for which the coercion works.

OK, so let me change the example.  How about this:


```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(GF(31))
sage: R.<y> = K[]
sage: L.<y> = K.extension(y^2 - x)
sage: R.<z> = L[]
sage: M.<z> = L.extension(z^2 - y)

sage: K.space_of_differentials()(x)
d(x)
sage: L.space_of_differentials()(x)
d(x)
sage: M.space_of_differentials()(x)
d(y)
```


Now `M` is a global function field, right?  Yet we still see the same behavior.  Furthermore...


```
sage: z.differential()
(8/x*z) d(y)
```


Yet dz = 1/(2*z) dy, which doesn't seem to be (8/x*z):


```
sage: 1/(2*z) == (8/x*z)
False
```


What's going on here?


```
sage: M.derivation()
Derivation map:
  From: Function field in z defined by z^2 + 30*y
  To:   Function field in z defined by z^2 + 30*y
  Defn: z |--> 8/x*z
        y |--> 16/x*y
        x |--> 1
```


`M`'s derivation map is w.r.t. x, but `FunctionFieldDifferential_global`'s constructor assumes that it's w.r.t. y, right?

I meant global function fields in sage. They are separable extensions of rational function fields over finite fields. M is not a global function field in sage in this sense.

The erroneous behavior of your example just indicates that to support differentials of extensions of non-rational function fields, some part of the infrastructure needs to be fixed. 

I guess your coercion is not intended just for global functions fields.  But as we saw, based on the current sage, your coercion doesn't work right for tower of function fields.  Then perhaps the scope of your coercion is extensions of rational function fields. I asked you to clarify this.

On the other hand, I think what you are implementing is the natural inclusion of the tensor product $L \otimes_K \Omega_K$ into $\Omega_L$ defined by f*(gdx) -> fg dx for f in L and g, x in K. Then the coercion would work right for towers of function fields once you enlarge the scope of differentials in sage properly. I am curious if you want to do this in this ticket or another ticket.

> The erroneous behavior of your example just indicates that to support differentials of extensions of non-rational function fields, some part of the infrastructure needs to be fixed. 

OK.  I think that's another ticket.

No, my coercion is not intended just for global function fields.  I'd like it to work for all of the function fields that can formed using the present code.

I'm thinking that I'll open another ticket to revise the differential code so that it supports all of the existing function fields, then come back to this ticket to see if any changes are needed here.

I haven't created that new ticket yet.  Do you want me to add you to the cc line when I do?

There is no action to be discovered by the coercion frame even though the coercion map is there. 

For y*dx, where x is in a function field F and y is in its extension E, which is the case that this ticket deals with, the action on the differential dx is **not** constructed from `_rmul_` automatically because y is not in F.


So I implemented one.
