# Issue 24411: Move undirected methods from generic_graph to graph

Keywords: graphs

From a suggestion by dcoudert (ticket:24634#comment:10):
Let's move some of the methods that are actually only valid for undirected graphs from generic_graph to graph.

Methods to be moved:

 a. `is_planar`
 b. `is_drawn_free_of_edge_crossings`
 c. ... (are there more?)

Things to be done:

 1. Move method to new file 
 2. add correct ``@`doc_index`
 2. remove line from the doc in the beginning of the file `generic_graph`
 2. Fix the references to methods in the `SEEALSO` section ...
 2. ... also for other methods referencing the moved method
 2. ... is there more?

Please help editing these two lists.

We should not move `is_planar` and `is_drawn_free_of_edge_crossings` but correct them

```
sage: G = graphs.Grid2dGraph(3,3)
sage: G.is_planar()
True
sage: D = DiGraph(G)
sage: D.is_planar()
False
```

A directed graph can be planar.
