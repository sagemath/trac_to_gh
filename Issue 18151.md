Instead of storing the tuple `(i,u,v)` as a tuple, it would be a lot better and simpler to store it as 3 different attributes.

We also fix comparison to use `_cmp_` (which is required for extension types) instead of `__cmp__`.

Very minor point, but you could do the alignment:

```diff
-       return self.__class__(self.parent(),
-                             (self.i,
-                              matrix[0]*self.u + matrix[2]*self.v,
-                              matrix[1]*self.u + matrix[3]*self.v))
+       return type(self)(self.parent(),
+                         (self.i,
+                          matrix[0]*self.u + matrix[2]*self.v,
+                          matrix[1]*self.u + matrix[3]*self.v))
```
After that, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
