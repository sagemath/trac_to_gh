# Issue 18151: Fix comparison for ManinSymbol

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-05-09 11:58:58

The Cython extension type `ManinSymbol` uses `__cmp__` which is not the preferred way to implement comparisons.

Very minor point, but you could do the alignment:

```diff
-       return self.__class__(self.parent(),
-                             (self.i,
-                              matrix[0]*self.u + matrix[2]*self.v,
-                              matrix[1]*self.u + matrix[3]*self.v))
+       return type(self)(self.parent(),
+                         (self.i,
+                          matrix[0]*self.u + matrix[2]*self.v,
+                          matrix[1]*self.u + matrix[3]*self.v))
```

After that, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
