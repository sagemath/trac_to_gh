I have added three new methods all_simple_paths_cython, all_paths_iterator_cython and _all_paths_iterator_cython and used the priority_queue data structure instead of python heap.

Right, I did not though about it. Sorry.

Well, if I understand well what you did, you simply declared the type of some variables and used a c++ priority queue instead of a Python queue at the cost of storing all reported paths in a list. This is not good enough. and I disagree with the current use of `idx_to_path` as this list may become giant.

Can't you try to identify first which parts of the methods are critical and could certainly be improved ?

A good news:

with this patch:

```
sage: g = digraphs.Complete(6)
sage: %time _ = g.all_simple_paths()
CPU times: user 24.9 ms, sys: 1.73 ms, total: 26.7 ms
Wall time: 25.7 ms
```


without:

```
sage: g = digraphs.Complete(6)
sage: %time _ = g.all_simple_paths()
CPU times: user 53 ms, sys: 8.88 ms, total: 61.9 ms
Wall time: 55.8 ms
```

A bad news: method `all_simple_paths` uses `all_paths_iterator`, and this method claim that `The paths are enumerated in increasing length order`. However, this is not the case (with and without this patch).

```

What if we used a priority queue instead of a queue in `_all_paths_iterator` ? As this behavior seems intependent of the changes done here, this can be post-pone to a future patch.

It seems that when starting_vertices and ending_vertices are not single vertex then these paths are 
not in increasing no. of edges. 


"What if we used a priority queue instead of a queue in _all_paths_iterator ? As this behavior seems intependent of the changes done here, this can be post-pone to a future patch. "

I tried it but still the results are not in increasing order of edges.

We can fix it in next patch either to reorganize the algorithm to print paths in order of increasing number of edges or stating in simple paths that edges will be in increasing order in case of a single src and destination.
