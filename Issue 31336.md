# Issue 31336: Improve the Weierstrass sigma function on the formal group of an elliptic curve

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31573

Original creator: wuthrich

Original creation time: 2021-03-28 16:32:36

CC:  cremona

Keywords: sigma, formal group

Initiated by this [mathoverflow question](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/383331/understanding-the-implementation-of-the-p-adic-sigma-function-in-sagemath) I propose to improve the documentation of `sigma` for a formal group of an elliptic curve as well as simplify it.

For historic reasons, it produced a power series with coefficients containing one, now useless, indeterminate. This ticket changes the code to return simply a power series in the base field of the elliptic curve. And it clarifies the documentation.

`Returns the Weierstrass`
should be `Return the Weierstrass`

typos

"an function" > "a function"

powerseries > power series

also please remove the commented lines
