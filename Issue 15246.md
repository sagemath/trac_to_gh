Keywords: simon_two_descent

The following tries to do 2-descent on an elliptic curve over a quadratic field:

```
K.<s>=QuadraticField(229)
c4=2173-235*(1-s)/2
c6=-124369+15988*(1-s)/2
E=EllipticCurve([-c4/48,-c6/864])
E.simon_two_descent()
```

It fails with a `RuntimeError`:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: 
  ***   at top-level: ans=bnfellrank(K,[0,0,0,
  ***                     ^--------------------

  ***   [1];if(DEBUGLEVEL_el
  ***   ^--------------------
  ***   array index (1) out of allowed range [none].
An error occurred while running Simon's 2-descent program
```

It appears that a certain number field element is expected to be a square, but in fact isn't.

The bug is not fixed by first changing to an integral model.

Lorenzini reported me a similar bug and I had a look. I now believe that this is a bug in Simon's script as I can reproduce it outside sage. I used the version of his file dated 06/04/2011, which is the newest I found on the web, while sage has one dated the 25/03/2009. So besides that bug, the file needs to be updated anyway. I tried both in sage's gp (2.5.5) and the current alpha (2.6.1).

I send an email to Denis and see if and how fast we can hope for a solution of this. Otherwise, I may at least update the script, later.

Lorenzini's example is a bit simpler:

```
R.<t> = QQ[]
L.<g> = NumberField(t^3 - 9*t^2 + 13*t - 4)
E1 = EllipticCurve(L,[1-g*(g-1),-g^2*(g-1),-g^2*(g-1),0,0])
E1.rank()
```

I quite like the suggestion by Karim Belabas to use `nfsign()` together with `nfnewprec`. I think that's a lot better than the current patch, which is really just a hack.

Maybe you should ask Denis Simon what he thinks (perhaps with a proof-of-concept patch)? Ideally, he fixes his script "upstream".

I completely agree with all of this and hope that we will soon hear Denis's opinion (I e-mailed him and pari-dev simultaneously).  The current patch is indeed fundamentally a hack and will hopefully be superseded by a better solution.

Sorry that I have not had time to join this discussion -- I am very interested in the outcome.

It would be good to get Denis to adapt his script.  He has done this in the past several times.  I have found that it does not work for someone else to revise his script and send him the result;  he want to do it himself and remain sole author.  But a proof-of-concept patch might help him.

Good to know. I also needed to make some changes to his scripts for the PARI-2.7 port (#15767).

Did you get any answer from Denis Simon? If not, we should try to implement the `nfsign()` solution ourselves.

If you want to do it, go ahead, but to be honest, it seems a bit pointless to me at the moment.
