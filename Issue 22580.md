Our cryptominisat is currently locked at version 2.9.6, which does not build on 32bit architecture, while the current version of cryptominisat is 5.0.1. This ticket aims at updating the package.

Note that our current cython interface does not work with cryptominisat 5. However, cryptominisat now offers it own python bindings, so we have to rewrite the interface to use that instead.

Note that cryptominisat 5 relies on cmake, which needs to be updated to compile on 32bit architecture as well, see #22814.

Tarball available at : https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat/archive/5.0.1.tar.gz to be renamed cryptominisat-5.0.1.tar.gz

**WARNING** Do not merge this ticket until the Sage interface has been updated.

Indeed, i noticed that too. However, if i understand correctly, `spkg-check` is run *after* `spkg-install`, but in the current case, things should be done before the `make` (e.g. passing `-DENABLE_TESTING=ON` option to `cmake`). How to achieve this ?

Also, the testing requires the installation of 7 additionnal modules. Should i package each of them or rebuild a custom tarball from a `git submodule` command (with the effect to package the last commit in `master`, not the last official release) ?
