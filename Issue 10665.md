# Issue 10665: IPython.CrashHandler import error upon starting sage

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10728

Original creator: jorges

Original creation time: 2011-02-02 15:21:07

Local modules located in $HOME/.local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages appear in sys.path _before_ IPython/Extensions and thus, a local version of IPython (lacking CrahsHandler module) replaces sage's own version.
