For a bunch of R's shared library modules it does not explicitly include `-l` flags for libraries they link to, as it is not necessary to do so, for the most part, on Linux.

However, on Windows it is necessary to resolve all symbols at link time.  This patch fixes the issue, and is otherwise harmless.
