As a general principle, I don't like code of the form

```
try:
    do_something()
except E:
    raise E("msg")
```

Especially if `msg` is meaningless or plain wrong. Just replace it by

```
do_something()
```

(I am talking about the `raise TypeError("x must be a list")` and also `raise TypeError("exponents of factors must be integers")`)

In this case, you probably don't need the conversion to `list` at all, since `enumerate()` can handle iterables. This works without conversion to list:

```
sage: list(enumerate(xrange(5)))
[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)]
