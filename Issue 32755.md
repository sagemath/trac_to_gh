# Issue 32755: update ninja_build, make it standard

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32992

ninja is a Python-friendly build system, it can be installed as a pip package too. (And so one can have a ninja, or cmake+ninja build of a Python package using standard Python/pip tools).


it's also the usual backend for cmake-configured packages.
