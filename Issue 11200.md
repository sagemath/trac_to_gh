# Issue 11200: nasty side effect of a failed simon_two_descent search

This could seriously confuse a person:

```
deep:sage-4.7.rc1 wstein$ ./sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1, 1, 0, -23611790086, 1396491910863060])
sage: E.simon_two_descent()
(1, 2, [(88716 : -44358 : 1)])
sage: E.gens()
[]
sage: E.rank()
0
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1, 1, 0, -23611790086, 1396491910863060])
sage: E.gens()
[(4311692542083/48594841 : -13035144436525227/338754636611 : 1)]
```

The point that simon_two_descent finds is a torsion point.  But for some reason E then thinks it has rank 0!  Even though simon_two_descent's first output was 1, and in fact E has rank 1.  This is pretty scary.

This may be a dup, because Cremona says: "Yet another one of many related bugs being looked at and/or already fixed, see #10832 and #11005 and #11130 and ...."

Looks great, and all tests pass. 

Could someone else go to the stopgap ticket (#12695) and mark that it's no longer needed?
