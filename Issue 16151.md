Simple thing, that can be useful for recursive constructions. You don't always know what "this" design exactly is in complicated functions.

By the way the modifications you did to the exception of OA/TD will probably cost a LOT of conflicts.

The terminology is not understandable:

- MOLS(n,k) but TD(k,n)
- (v,k,lambda)-BIBD but TD(v,k,lambda)

good luck for your future merges... (now you are used to it ;-P)

Yo !

> The terminology is not understandable:


I just sent you "Combinatorial Designs: Construction and Analysis" from Douglas Stinson which uses `(v,k,lambda)-BIBD`, `TD(k,n)` and `OA(k,n)`. I believed that the Handbook of Combinatorial Designs did the same but they actually write `BIBD(v,k,lambda)`. Their purpose was probably to unify notations, given that `(v,k,lambda)-BIBD` is a pretty common :

http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~leonard/repeated11.pdf
http://www.argilo.net/files/bibd.pdf

You will also find other occurrences of this naming in the references of the Handbook.

Othey guys say 2-(v,k,lambda) design.

> - MOLS(n,k) but TD(k,n)
> - (v,k,lambda)-BIBD but TD(v,k,lambda)


Two remarks :
- `MOLS(n,k)` does not appear in Sage's code
- It is true that the constructor of MOLS takes first a n then an k as input. It is true that it can lead to mistakes, and perhaps we should change it.
- If you insist on using BIBD(v,k,lambda) it can be done but it has to be a global change as some pages, eg http://sagemath.org/doc/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/designs/bibd.html already use this terminology. Same for PBD.
