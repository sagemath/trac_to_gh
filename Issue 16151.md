Simple thing, that can be useful for recursive constructions. You don't always know what "this" design exactly is in complicated functions.

Hi Nathann,

All right, why not doing it for BIBD as well?

Indeed. You can add a commit.

I can do that, but I do care about merge conflicts with other tickets.

Caring is good. Do you have a specific ticket in mind ?

For example #16347 (Wilson's constructions of OA with 2 truncated groups) modifies bibd.py

Indeed. You can see that none of the lines near where the exceptions are raised or doctested are touched, so this is safe.

The two commits at u/vdelecroix/16388 take care of BIBD. All test pass. Can set to positive review if you like.

Yo !

I added a small commit as one usually writes (v,k,lambda)-BIBD.

By the way the modifications you did to the exception of OA/TD will probably cost a LOT of conflicts.

Just mentionning it because you said that you cared.

Oh, my mistake. Those modifications cannot hurt more than the patch did before you wrote this commit. Sorry for that.

I hope I had conflicts in mind when I first wrote it. Otherwise I will pay it.

The terminology is not understandable:

- MOLS(n,k) but TD(k,n)
- (v,k,lambda)-BIBD but TD(v,k,lambda)

good luck for your future merges... (now you are used to it ;-P)

Yo !

> The terminology is not understandable:

I just sent you "Combinatorial Designs: Construction and Analysis" from Douglas Stinson which uses `(v,k,lambda)-BIBD`, `TD(k,n)` and `OA(k,n)`. I believed that the Handbook of Combinatorial Designs did the same but they actually write `BIBD(v,k,lambda)`. Their purpose was probably to unify notations, given that `(v,k,lambda)-BIBD` is a pretty common :

http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~leonard/repeated11.pdf
http://www.argilo.net/files/bibd.pdf

You will also find other occurrences of this naming in the references of the Handbook.

Othey guys say 2-(v,k,lambda) design.

> - MOLS(n,k) but TD(k,n)
> - (v,k,lambda)-BIBD but TD(v,k,lambda)

Two remarks :
- `MOLS(n,k)` does not appear in Sage's code
- It is true that the constructor of MOLS takes first a n then an k as input. It is true that it can lead to mistakes, and perhaps we should change it.
- If you insist on using BIBD(v,k,lambda) it can be done but it has to be a global change as some pages, eg http://sagemath.org/doc/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/designs/bibd.html already use this terminology. Same for PBD.
