# Issue 28982: avoid numpy warning in condition number of CDF matrices

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29219

Original creator: @mwageringel

Original creation time: 2020-02-18 23:30:41

This ticket fixes a warning that was issued when computing the condition number of a matrix over CDF:


```
sage: matrix(CDF, [[1 + I, 0], [0, 1 + I]]).condition()
...src/bin/sage-ipython:1: ComplexWarning: Casting complex values to real discards the imaginary part
  #!/usr/bin/env sage-python
2.0
```


Depending on the element types, numpy returns a complex result. Since the imaginary part is 0, this is fixed by taking the real part.
