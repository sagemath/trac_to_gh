So far this only seems to affect me, and not Tom Boothby. So it needs more investigation.  

When I try to use #auto cells that are not the very first cell in a worksheet, they do not autoevaluate.  This happens for me in both 2.11 and 3.0.1, but Tom didn't see it in 3.0.  So I have no idea what is going on.

I've tried this in a few installations with #5020 applied and cannot duplicate this.  I'm going to mark it as invalid.
