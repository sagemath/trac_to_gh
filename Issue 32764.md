CC:  @egourgoulhon @tscrim @tobiasdiez

As discussed in #30362, [comment:77](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30362#comment:77), we add `TopologicalManifold`, `DifferentiableManifold`, `RiemannianManifold` etc. to the `manifolds` namespace.

This shall represent an additional and more convenient syntax opposed to `Manifold(..., structure=...)`.

I'd rather suggest to look into having certain keyword arguments trigger a choice of structure.

```
sage: Manifold(2, 'M', diff_degree=7)
ValueError: diff_degree = 7 is not compatible with a smooth structure
```

Instead, this could perhaps imply `structure='differentiable'`.


```
sage: Manifold(2, 'M', metric_name='g')
2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```

Instead, this should probably select `structure='Riemannian'`.

It would also be good if users could pass a `category` keyword to select the structure. In this direction, also for example the Riemannian structure is not yet reflected in the categories:

```
sage: E = EuclideanSpace(2)
sage: E.category()
Join of Category of smooth manifolds over Real Field with 53 bits of precision and Category of connected manifolds over Real Field with 53 bits of precision and Category of complete metric spaces
```

This is something that we should extend along the way.

I agree. The categorical approach is the most natural one.

I think we should get rid of the structure implementation as it is right now and entirely jump over to categories. This would also have the great advantage that we can combine structures such as symplectic and Riemannian structures, which are not mutually exclusive.

Also this default behavior on extra parameters is a good idea.

I am fairly -1 on pushing the full structure into the categories. This was a very conscious design decision in full view of what could be done with categories.

2. It allows for something easy to transfer information across different base rings.
3. It is easy to have extra parameterizations. For example, the classes of C<sup>k</sup> manifolds.

It is meant to work in conjunction with the categories.

Can you elaborate on 1, please?

As for 2, do you have an example where the structure design makes things easier opposed to categories?

I see the point in 3.

Nevertheless, we should rethink the design in some way. We have Riemannian manifolds, which are represented by the class `PseudoRiemannianManifold` and carry the structure `RiemannianStructure`. With #30362 we get new structures, namely Poisson/symplectic structures. But now, a manifold can have a Riemannian structure *and* a symplectic structure. Which base class do we use? Which structure? Do we want to combine structures? If so, how? I just see that the category framework already comes with the benefit of joint categories. It might be easier to use that preexisting architecture.

If you have a manifold `M` with structure `S`, and you realize that it should have structure `T`. This becomes a very simple change of swapping `S` for `T`. In particular, you want to change the smoothness. (Admittedly, I don't think we have a good hook for doing this.)

> As for 2, do you have an example where the structure design makes things easier opposed to categories?

You want information preserved for manifolds over `CC` and over `RR`. These will lie in different categories. It also gets around not having a clear specification of `RR` (e.g., no dependency on precision or the particular implementation). It is also better to identify information with attributes rather than methods (e.g., the chart class) for speed and readability.

Don't conflate structures and base classes. They are different and serve different roles. Don't try and force a square peg into a round hole. Right now there is not a combinatorial explosion of cases, so we don't need to use a backhoe when all we need is a shovel either. If you need a combined structure, then make a combined structure.

Because categories are strongly tied to the creation of the object (and its elements) as it creates a dynamic subclass. In fact, strictly speaking, the differentiable structure of a manifold  can give different objects in the category of differentiable manifolds (although we have actually pushed this data into the manifold itself).

Categories carry mathematical information. You cannot separate the base ring.

You cannot get around having a base class when you want extra methods, at least without a performance penalty or monkey-patching. However, it can have a range of structures attached to it.

That is a fallacy as good OOP design means you do not care about how the backend is implemented. This sounds like the engineer's paradox: spend 30% more time making something 10% faster.

At least for a start the initialization code such as
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/manifolds/manifold.py#L2960-L2970
should go in the corresponding constructor of `Topological(Sub)Manifold` in my opinion so that `Manifold` is really only choosing the proper class to initialize based on the parameters provided. Then one can choose if one prefers to import TopologicalManifold and uses it directly, or is the Manifold constructor.

I cannot really contribute to the category vs structure discussion as I'm not familiar enough with the category framework. (If someone wants to enlighten me: what are the practical consequences of viewing `\C` as a complex manifold vs as a real manifold?)
From a mathematical perspective, the 'structure' is often easy to define whereas the relevant category may depend on the applications one has in mind (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_category).

Fair enough!
