   BL2008, DN1990, Joh1980, KZ2003, Lan2008, MMY2003,
   Nog1985, Rau1979, Vee1978, Yoc2005, Zor, Zor2008

- rename Joh1990 to Johnson1990
- add Johnston1999 and adapt references to it

Vincent, does this entail extra work at surface-dynamics?

Seems not, from a quick look at

- https://github.com/flatsurf/surface-dynamics/blob/0.4.7/doc/source/references.rst

Indeed, everything is in the `references.rst` of `surface-dynamics`.

Thanks!

To go further (elsewhere) it might be worth
writing two scripts to detect

- items in the main bibliography file
  to which there is no reference at all
- bibliographic references in other files
  that need moving to the dedicated file
