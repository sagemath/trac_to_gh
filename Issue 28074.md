```

The backtrace usually points into sage/ext/memory_allocator. My guess is that the computation is mostly about shufffling about memory, and raising signals / longjmp out of malloc has a chance of messing up things.

On OS X, I've seen

```

Unhandled SIGILL: An illegal instruction occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.

```

It's not repeatable, but I have seen it on two different machines, Python 2 and Python 3.

See also #28287.

Actually in bit_vector_operations.cc there is a memory allocation, namely `*is_not_newface = new int[n_faces -1]();`.

I never considered it to be a possible problem. I could move this allocation to `FaceIterator` (outside of `sig_on`/`sig_off`). This also involves in time being saved (this is why I did it somewhere).

I don't understand how that could ever end up with a SIGILL (instead of SIGSEGV) on OSX but maybe thats an Apple secret

The resolution of #28287 is to remove the tests.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Comment by chapoton created at 2019-08-25 08:09:40

So this is now an invalid ticket, right ?


---

Comment by @kliem created at 2019-08-25 12:23:37

We could also remove the memory allocation in the method `get_next_level` as illustrated in my commit.

Much simpler fix.

Changing keywords from "random_fail" to "random_fail, combinatorial polyhedron".

LGTM.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

9.0 is out
