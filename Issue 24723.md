Keywords: primes prime_pi

The prime_pi function sometimes computes a wrong result. In particular, I found the following errors:

* prime_pi(14783545363230719)
  returns 408351706116074, it should be 408351706116078
* prime_pi(5685979153167559)
  returns 161319877461134, it should be 161319877461136
* prime_pi(642763101936913)
  returns 19439675999018, it should be 19439675999019

The correct countings are computed using Kim Walisch's [primecount](https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount/) library, with different algorithms: Deleglise-Rivat, Lagarias-Miller-Odlyzko and Lehmer's formula. (not. All of them return the same result.

Note that while the arguments to prime_pi in the first two examples exceed the value 2!^50, causing the appearance of a warning ("computation of prime_pi for x >= 2!^50 has not been as thoroughly tested as for smaller values"), the argument  of the last example is within the range of inputs considered to be safe.

Actually, instead of fixing the current code, it could be easier to rewrite the prime_pi function and let it use the primecount library. This would have the additional advantage of being much faster than the current code.

Could you add timings in the ticket description? Did you check with PARI/GP?

A quick thing would be to put a deprecation warning in `prime_pi` et al., telling users to use `prime_pi` from `primecount` instead. Would this be acceptable way to resolve this ticket?
(note that also `prime_pi` has 2nd optional parameter, and providing an implementation for it would be work...)

And then it can be just removed, witin a year or so.

should `primecount` to be added to dependencies of, hmm, `sagelib` ? 
Because on a slow 32-bit machine I see how building docs is failing (if I start `make ptest` right after `./configure`), as it needs `prime_pi`, which in turn depends on `primecount`, or, more precisely, on `sage.interfaces.primecount`.

I finally built and tested this on a 32-bit host, the only one test error there, it is due to a different error message, `int is too big` vs `Python int is too big`.

Needs some dots to be added.

You were asking how to do dependencies right. The answer is: The bindings need to go into a separate Python package -- that will look just like `memory_allocator`. In this way, `sagelib` will not acquire another compile-time dependency. Modularization = do not pile on additional compile-time dependencies.

I asked you whether it's the only Cython file out there left that should not be a part of sagelib.
You didn't reply - I assume this means it is not. 

I don't have mental capacity now to learn the ideal modern design, I just want this ticket done in the most direct way.
Modularisation can be done on another ticket.

I was relieved today from teaching computer graphics next term, so I have some spare mental capacity now :-)

Note that `src/sage/functions/prime_pi.pyx` relies heavily on `sagelib` (e.g. on SR). 

What does not rely on sagelib (or on Sage at all) is  `src/sage/interfaces/primecount.pyx`, 
which is not even touched by this ticket (it's touched by  #25009).
 
The latter indeed can be spun off, modelling on `memory_allocator`
(I suppose after it's done, one would only need to change one import statement in `src/sage/functions/prime_pi.pyx`.)
