The doctest in gap_reps.py


```
EllipticCurve([Integer(1),-Integer(1),Integer(1),-Integer(2680),-Integer(50053)]).galois_representation().image_type(Integer(7))    # long time
```

fails by doctest -long because


```
Expected:
    'The image is a group of order 18.'
Got:
    'The image is a non-abelian group of order 18.'
```

That error is covered by the doctest command of [#11936](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/11936), which produces a timeout.

One could think about an extra error message saying that there was an error **and** a timeout

In doctests you can make use of ... to handle non-determinstic pieces of the output.  So you could change it into something like

```
'The image is a... group of order 18.'
```

and for consistency, use this for the 36 case as well. :).
