# Issue 30841: Replace __call__() by _element_class_() in MatrixSpace

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31078

Original creator: pbruin

Original creation time: 2020-12-18 19:42:31

The `MatrixSpace` class still has a `__call__()` method instead of `_element_constructor_()`.  This is relatively easy to change, and has the benefit that if `M` is a matrix space and `m` an element of `M`, then `M(m)` simply returns `m`.  This can be viewed as a small addendum to #23719.

One side effect of the attached branch is that the first argument (`entries`) is now effectively a mandatory non-keyword argument, and `copy` and `coerce` are keyword-only arguments.  This is probably a good thing for readability, though.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

Looks good to me.  Most recent test failure is spurious.

One thing that we might want to be slightly cautious about that this breaks backwards compatibility for anyone who has inputs `MS(entries, False)` or `MS(entries, False, True)`. This might also have a speed impact as matrices are used a lot of places in Sage as it adds some extra indirection, but I am a little less concerned about that since this should mostly be coming from user input (if there is a slight regression).
