CC:  @egourgoulhon @slel

Spherical coordinates `(r, theta, phi)` involve
one length coordinate `r` and two angle
coordinates `theta` and `phi`, one representing
longitude and varying in a length `2*pi` interval,
typically `[0, 2*pi]`, the other representing
latitude and varying in a length `pi` interval:
either `[0, pi]` if the latitude is measured
from one of the poles, or `[-pi/2, pi/2]`
if the latitude is measured from the equator.

Sage's euclidean space has a `spherical_coordinates`
method using pole-based latitude. Providing
equator-based latitude would be a nice option.
