# Issue 11359: add some docutils scripts to .hgignore

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11531

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2011-06-22 01:52:27

In Sage 4.7.1.alpha2:

```
$ hg status
? rst2man.py
? rst2odt.py
? rst2odt_prepstyles.py
```

I think this happened with the upgrade to docutils in #10166.  The attached patch puts these files into the .hgignore file.

The flask notebook currently pulls in the python package "babel" (for internationalization) which installs the file `$SAGE_LOCAL/pybabel` - could you add that as well?
