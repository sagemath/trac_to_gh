```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 't', 1); t = R.gen()
sage: (t/2) * vector([1,2])
```
results in a

```
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for *: 'Multivariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field' and 'Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring'
```

Interestingly, for a "true" univariate polynomial ring it works:

```
sage: (t/2) * vector([1,2])
(1/2*t, t)
```

Current fix indeed fixes the problem but introduces new problems:

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', 500)
sage: S = PolynomialRing(GF(5), 'x', 200)
sage: R.gen(0) + S.gen(0)
```
The last line takes a second or so without patch, but ages (I've
interrupted after two minutes) with the change above. RunSnakeRun says
that most of the time is spent in

```
method '_coerce_' of 'sage.structure.parent_old.Parent'
```
This is also not what we'd like. So what should we do now?

The current branch patches `__call__` so that `_coerce_` is not called that often. #25558 might change everything, but this seems somehow more out of reach.

Nevertheless, this code for caching 0 and 1 does make things a bit faster.
On my machine, `%time R.gen(0) + S.gen(0)` gives 9.6 s, but taking out the caching it's 12.6 s.

There are several doctest failures. Among them we see that the pushout **wrongly** changes some `Univariate` to `Multivariate`.

```
File "src/sage/categories/pushout.py", line 3772, in sage.categories.pushout.pushout
Failed example:
    pushout(ZZ['x,y,z'], Frac(ZZ['x'])['y'])
Expected:
    Multivariate Polynomial Ring in y, z over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
Got:
    Multivariate Polynomial Ring in y, z over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
```
Above the action of `ZZ[x,y,z]` on `ZZ(x)[y]` is `ZZ(x)[y,z]` in both situations. However, I think that the `ZZ(x)` **must not** change. It would be good to test this pushout with `ZZ(x)` in different forms
- univariate `PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x')`
- univariate NTL `PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', implementation='NTL')`
- multivariate `PolynomialRing(ZZ, ['x'], 1))`.

In this second example it is unclear what is best.

```
File "src/sage/categories/pushout.py", line 3778, in sage.categories.pushout.pushout
Failed example:
    pushout(QQ['x,y'], ZZ[['x']])
Expected:
    Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Power Series Ring in x over Rational Field
Got:
    Multivariate Polynomial Ring in y over Power Series Ring in x over Rational Field
```
The action of `QQ[x,y]` on `ZZ[This is the Trac macro *x* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#x-macro)` does correctly produce `QQ[y][This is the Trac macro *x* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#x-macro)` in both situations. Since `QQ[x,y] -> QQ[y]` drops a variable it is unclear to me if there is a best answer.

Related: it is desirable that the string representation of multivariate polynomial rings make visible the implementation. Currently we have

```
sage: PolynomialRing(ZZ, ['x', 'y'], 2, implementation='generic')
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Integer Ring
sage: PolynomialRing(ZZ, ['x', 'y'], 2, implementation='singular')
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Integer Ring
```
But it would be better as

```
sage: PolynomialRing(ZZ, ['x', 'y'], 2, implementation='generic')
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Integer Ring (using generic implementation)
sage: PolynomialRing(ZZ, ['x', 'y'], 2, implementation='singular')
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Integer Ring
```
Ideally (as for univariate polynomials and matrices) the default implementation would show nothing.
