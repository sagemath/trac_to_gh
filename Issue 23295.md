The links in these examples are incorrectly pointing to files on my local computer and have been updated to point to the CDN.

Does not work for me: having pulled the ticket branch into Sage 8.1.beta0 and run make, I still get blank boxes in the _Three.js JavaScript WebGL Renderer_ section of the reference manual.
Besides, if I open directly the file `src/doc/en/reference/plot3d/threejs_examples/spheres.html` in my browser, I get a blank box as well.

Having run `make doc-clean && make` and cleared the cache of my browser, it works now.

Thanks for this fix!
