# Issue 29248: configure: Exit with an error if invoked from within a Sage shell

This cannot reliably work because configure will mistake installed stuff in SAGE_LOCAL for "system packages".

We can test if `SAGE_SHPROMPT_PREFIX` is "sage-buildsh" to check if the user ran `sage --buildsh`. Although should we be doing `export SAGE_SHPROMPT_PREFIX` in `src/bin/sage`? It's currently only exported if using `--buildsh`, not if using `--sh`.

How else do we test this? Check to see if SAGE_LOCAL, SAGE_ROOT, and other variables are set?

That is, should we do one or the other of these changes?

Perhaps it's better to check whether one of the scripts installed by sagelib in `src/bin/` such as `sage-startuptime.py` is accessible through PATH. It should be a script that the distribution packagers don't install in `/usr/bin`.... Of course this kind of conflicts with tickets that try to clean up `src/bin` like #21559 (Move sage-the-distribution scripts from src/bin to build/bin), but this is not an immediate problem.

It's pretty clearly a mistake to try to build sage from within a sage shell... but what exactly is failing? This shouldn't be too different from building against a bunch of hand-compiled stuff under `/usr/local` with `-I/usr/local/include` in CPPFLAGS, `-L/usr/local/lib` in LDFLAGS, et cetera.

In any case, a heuristic here should be fine. This will be a rare mistake, and nothing too bad happens. Exporting `SAGE_SHPROMPT_PREFIX=sage-sh` and then checking for it in the configure script looks like it will do the trick.

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
