# Issue 33988: missing check for bivariate polynomials over GF(p) for p>2^31 in Singular interface

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34225

Original creator: zimmerma

Original creation time: 2022-07-26 07:49:54

with Sage 9.5:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(next_prime(2^31))[]
sage: (x+y).resultant(x-y,x)
...
TypeError: Singular error:
   ? Wrong or unknown ground field specification
   ? cannot make ring
   ? error occurred in or before STDIN line 16: `ring sage9=2147483659,(x, y),dp;`
   ? expected ring-expression. type 'help ring;'
```

With previous_prime(2<sup>31</sup>) instead, we get a NotImplementedError error.
