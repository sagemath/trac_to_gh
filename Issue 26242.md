Please undo all changes from `\ZZ` to `\Bold{Z}` in the documentation.

For the uniformity of sage documentation, it is better to always use `\ZZ`.

Ah OK. It's a kind of trap because we cannot use `\ZZ` in the notebook for instance.
Anyway, I made the changes and also replaced `\mathbb{Z}` by `\ZZ`, etc. Please tell me if it's not appropriate.

I think we also have `\GF` for finite fields. But all these cosmetic changes should really be done IMHO in another ticket, because they currently hide the important changes in this ticket, which get lost in the middle of all the changes made.

OK, if you insist, I split this ticket into two parts.

This should be re-targeted for 8.5.
