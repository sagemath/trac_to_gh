File `problem.spyx` with

```
import sage.all
from sage.all import *
from sage.rings.integer_ring import ZZ
print ZZ(1000)
```

Run it with `sage problem.spyx` and it fails with

```
ImportError: cannot import name ZZ
```

on 6.9, 6.10, 7.0, 7.1.beta4. On 6.8 it fails with

```
error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
```


The original problem (failing code in file `problem.spyx`) was

```
import sage.all
from sage.rings.real_mpfi import RealIntervalField
RealIntervalField(100)(4.2)
```
