The error bound for canonical height is not working in all cases.


```
PS.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(1,QQ)
H=Hom(PS,PS)
f=H([16*x^2 -29*y^2,16*y^2]) #Poonen 3-cycle
Q=PS([-1/4,1])
Q.is_preperiodic(f)
```


is using error_bound = 0.01 and getting an error larger than 0.01

there were errors in two places. One with how resultant was called (and in resultant itself) with respect to normalization, and a problem with how the error bound was calculated.
