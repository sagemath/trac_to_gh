It's relatively easy using import system hooks in Python to make new file types 'importable' using the standard import statement.  E.g. a file like `mymodule.sage` could be imported as `mymodule` just as though it were `mymodule.py`.

Importing a `.sage` module is of course just a thin layer over a normal Python module import, but to pass it through the Sage preparser.

There are of course some risks to making `.sage` modules importable.  For example, what if a user has both a `foo.sage` and an `foo.py`?  Which one takes priority upon `import foo`?  In particular it could introduce quite some surprises if a user has something like `os.sage` in their current directory.

Unfortunately it's not possible to extend the syntax of import statements, which would be nice.  But, while the "module name" portion of an import statement must be a valid identifier, we can still otherwise process it however we want.  So maybe `.sage` module imports would be initiated only if `.sage` is used explicitly in the import statement.  So for example, to import a sage module named `foo.sage` one would literally write:


```
import foo.sage
```


to distinguish it from a Python module named `foo.py`.  Of course, if there is a Python *package* named `foo` that happens to have a `sage` sub-module there is still a conflict.  But this is a bit unlikely for most cases.

So in order to make such a feature available, while mitigating potential problems with it, I might suggest a few additional restrictions:

1. There would be a function to enable/disable `.sage` import functionality on the fly.  When first introduced this would be disabled by default, but we would certainly want to make the feature easily discoverable through the documentation, with all the caveats discussed.

2. In the off chance that there is a conflict between a `.sage` module an a plain Python module, the system should check for that.  In that case the `.sage` module still takes priority (if `.sage` imports are enabled), but a warning about the conflict is shown.

3. This feature should be Python 3 only.  That will make it easier to implement, due to the significant differences between the import systems, and it will also give a nice motivation, to anyone who wants the feature, to switch to Python 3.

Do we need to worry about `foo.py` shadowing `foo.sage`? The long-standing situation on this was that `foo.sage` would generate `foo.py` - did this change at some point I missed?

Perhaps so.  The idea there was just to make it less likely for it to shadow Python modules on `sys.path` that have absolutely nothing to do with Sage, and cause sudden strange breakage.

I agree with this.

However the ability to import `.sage` files should be optional, and switchable at runtime, as Erik suggested. Otherwise it could break code that is now working.

Still, if there's `foo.py` and `foo.sage` in the same dir, which should shadow which? I'd say `foo.py` takes priority.

That's true about `os`; I've seen this more often with things like "string" or "logging".

And I agree it's no different. My only point is that *currently* it does not work that way for `.sage` files, so if we implement this it has to be opt-in, at least at first, because suddenly producing side-effects based on files the user happens to have in their working directory is user-hostile.

I remember now that the context to that work was to make the source code for Cython modules findable on Python 3, so the idea was to add an import hook that could recognize imports of Cython-modules based on the presence of the actual `.pyx` file in the same path as the actual extension module being imported (it does not do anything like automatically interpret/compile the Cython code into binaries; it just recognized Cython modules as distinct from other extension modules).

For importing `.sage` files the problem is a little different. But all the `MetaFileFinder` stuff I had to do was not in any way specific to Cython, but rather was necessary in order to extend the default `PathFinder` installed in `sys.meta_hooks` on Python 3.

One of the corollaries of this enhancement is that it should be possible in a similar way to monkey-patch some Sage classes, i. e., for example, adding new *methods* to Sage-defined classes.

This would considerably ease the prototyping of new extensions (which currently require forking a branch and re`make`ing it for test.

I'm afraid I don't see at all how that's related.  This is just about making `.sage` files importable through the normal Python import system.  Monkey-patching classes is a thing you can already do, having relatively little to do with how modules are imported.

Nicolas worked on something like this with https://github.com/nthiery/recursive-monkey-patch so you might want to ask him about it.
