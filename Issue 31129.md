Sage's docbuilding uses [optparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/optparse.html) for argument parsing, but this library has been deprecated for a while. We should switch to [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html).

Looks very close now, docs build and tests pass.

The old version exited gracefully with the help message if you ran `./sage --docbuild`, whereas this one prints an error message instead.

Another difference. Old:

```
% ./sage --docbuild -h
Usage: sage --docbuild [OPTIONS] DOCUMENT (FORMAT | COMMAND)

Build or return information about Sage documentation.

    DOCUMENT    name of the document to build
    FORMAT      document output format
    COMMAND     document-specific command

Note that DOCUMENT may have the form 'file=/path/to/FILE',
which builds the documentation for the specified file.

A DOCUMENT and either a FORMAT or a COMMAND are required,
unless a list of one or more of these is requested.

OPTIONS:
  Standard:
```

New:

```
% ./sage --docbuild -h
usage: sage --docbuild [OPTIONS] DOCUMENT (FORMAT | COMMAND)

Build or return information about Sage documentation. DOCUMENT name of the document to
build FORMAT document output format COMMAND document-specific command Note that DOCUMENT
may have the form 'file=/path/to/FILE', which builds the documentation for the specified
file. A DOCUMENT and either a FORMAT or a COMMAND are required, unless a list of one or
more of these is requested.

positional arguments:
  document
  {html,pdf,changes,htmlhelp,inventory,json,latex,linkcheck,pickle,web}

Standard:
```

Any idea why it's not preserving the line breaks in the help message? We could try the following changes, but I would like to understand why it's not respecting our formatting for the strings.
