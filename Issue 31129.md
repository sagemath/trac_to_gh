# Issue 31129: docbuild: switch from optparse to argparse

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31366

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2021-02-09 03:05:38

Sage's docbuilding uses [optparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/optparse.html) for argument parsing, but this library has been deprecated for a while. We should switch to [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html).

I'm getting the message `AttributeError: module 'argparse' has no attribute 'OptionGroup'`. I can't tell what the right replacement is — `add_argument_group`? `add_subparser`?

I tried implementing this a while ago (before your branch), so here are some contributions to your branch from my attempts. They help, but not sure if they are good enough yet.

I was working on that right now. I had to merge my branch with yours, hopefully in a correct way. Starts to look better.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-10-31 21:58:34

Yes, much better. We have to figure how to allow commands like `./sage --docbuild -h`, which currently says

```
usage: sage --docbuild [OPTIONS] DOCUMENT (FORMAT | COMMAND)
__main__.py: error: the following arguments are required: document, format
```

and the bot+linter are now green ; still needs tests and double-check, for sure

Looks very close now, docs build and tests pass.

The old version exited gracefully with the help message if you ran `./sage --docbuild`, whereas this one prints an error message instead.

Another difference. Old:

```
% ./sage --docbuild -h
Usage: sage --docbuild [OPTIONS] DOCUMENT (FORMAT | COMMAND)

Build or return information about Sage documentation.

    DOCUMENT    name of the document to build
    FORMAT      document output format
    COMMAND     document-specific command

Note that DOCUMENT may have the form 'file=/path/to/FILE',
which builds the documentation for the specified file.

A DOCUMENT and either a FORMAT or a COMMAND are required,
unless a list of one or more of these is requested.

OPTIONS:
  Standard:
```

New:

```
% ./sage --docbuild -h
usage: sage --docbuild [OPTIONS] DOCUMENT (FORMAT | COMMAND)

Build or return information about Sage documentation. DOCUMENT name of the document to
build FORMAT document output format COMMAND document-specific command Note that DOCUMENT
may have the form 'file=/path/to/FILE', which builds the documentation for the specified
file. A DOCUMENT and either a FORMAT or a COMMAND are required, unless a list of one or
more of these is requested.

positional arguments:
  document
  {html,pdf,changes,htmlhelp,inventory,json,latex,linkcheck,pickle,web}

Standard:
```

Any idea why it's not preserving the line breaks in the help message? We could try the following changes, but I would like to understand why it's not respecting our formatting for the strings.

Looks good. I have a few more proposed changes: two of the "examples" in `help_examples` don't work, so I am fixing one and changing one. Also, `./sage --docbuild -H` used to print a longer message, and I am restoring that. Let me know if you object to any of these changes, of course.

A bit more explanation: `./sage -FDC all` used to print formats, documents, and commands, but now it just prints formats and exits. Also, the `-S` option requires `-S=-OPTS` because of the hyphen in `OPTS`; this appears to be a known issue with argparse: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16174992/cant-get-argparse-to-read-quoted-string-with-dashes-in-it. Finally, `./sage --docbuild developer -j html` is not good: the document and format should come first, the `-j` just confuses things (and isn't necessary anyway, since mathjax has been the default forever).

Okay, let's merge it. (I added #32946 as a dependency because otherwise there would be a merge conflict.)
