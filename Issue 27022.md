CC:  embray

Keywords: spkg-configure

mpc depends on GMP/MPIR and MPFR.
I am trying something like this:

```
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE([mpc], [
    AC_CHECK_HEADER(mpc.h, [], [sage_spkg_install_mpc=yes])
dnl mpc_cmp_abs appeared in MPC 1.1.0
    AC_SEARCH_LIBS([mpc_cmp_abs], [mpc], [break], [sage_spkg_install_mpc=yes])
])
```

mpfrcx's spkg-install hardcodes the location of mpc to SAGE_LOCAL. So this will need to be fixed.
