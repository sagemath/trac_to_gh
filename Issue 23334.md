I implemented the Veronese embedding functionality in two functions. One at the level of projective spaces and one for subschemes which returns the map between the ambient spaces restricted to the subscheme and its image (using the existing _forward_image functionality for projective subschemes). I also merged with #23434 to preemptively address the conflict.
