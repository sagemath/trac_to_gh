The current latex output for simple strings is a bit overkill:

```
    sage: latex("hello world")
    \verb|hello|\phantom{\verb!x!}\verb|world|
```


There is a rationale behind it: namely this allows for a nicer rendering of multi-line ascii art by emulating a fixed-width font. However, for a simple one line string, the following would be more readable:

```
    sage: latex("hello world")
    \text{hello world}
```


The attached preliminary patch does this. However more work would need to be done, as this requires changing quite a few doctests. In fact some code seem to assume that the output use `\verb` before stripping this away, so maybe some cleanup is in order there.

I for myself won't work any further on this patch; feel free to take over!

And what if several such strings will be output in sequence and fixed width font will somehow matter to them? Plus if something may be a single string or several, it means that the output format will change. I think that the best way for strings is uniform handling of all cases and verb seems like a sensible choice.

Will this be better than verb? Middle { } are for dealing with multiple spaces, I guess we can avoid inserting them for a single space, but it will complicate the code...
