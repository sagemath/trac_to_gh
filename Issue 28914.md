In the code for `sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py`, we have the following in the `orbit` cached method.

```
        actions = {
            "OnPoints"           : [],
            "OnSets"             : [Set],
            "OnPairs"            : [tuple],
            "OnTuples"           : [tuple],
            "OnSetsSets"         : [Set, Set],
            "OnSetsDisjointSets" : [Set, Set],
            "OnSetsTuples"       : [Set, tuple],
            "OnTuplesSets"       : [tuple, Set],
            "OnTuplesTuples"     : [tuple, tuple],
            }
```
and

```
        def input_for_gap(x, depth, container):
            if depth == len(container):
                try:
                    return self._domain_to_gap[x]
                except KeyError:
                    raise ValueError('{0} is not part of the domain'.format(x))
            x = [input_for_gap(xx, depth+1, container) for xx in x]
            if container[depth] is Set:
                x.sort()
            return x
```
This is supposed to recursively turn things into GAP-friendly objects.  However, at least for the following  example it fails (badly):

```
grp = PermutationGroup([ '(1,2,3,4,5)', '(1,2,4,3)' ])
els = list(grp)
grp.orbit(tuple(els[:4]), action = "OnSets")
```

However, [it works very nicely in GAP itself](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/?z=eJxLLypQsLJVcC_KLy3QiFbQMNQx0jHWMdEx1dSBcEx0jDUVYjWteblSc4pBSl1zUnNT80qKNdKLCkDC_kVJmSUgjo4CUEV1NNSE2FodBf-84NSSYk0AJqwbiA==&lang=gap&interacts=eJyLjgUAARUAuQ==).  So we need to be able to mimic that - probably for a lot of these we are allowed to have sets with more than one element.

See [this Stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59367322/orbit-of-a-set-of-permutations) where there is more detail.
