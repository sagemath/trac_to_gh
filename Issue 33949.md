# Issue 33949: Problem translating Fricas special function ellipticF to Sagemath

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34186

Keywords: fricas intergate symbolic

For reference: #34058 

There is still an issue with translation of Fricas special functions to Sagemath.

Using sagemath 9.7 beta 5, Fricas returns antiderivative which has `ellipticF` but this remains as is at Sagemath. But Sagemath  has no such special function. It should be `elliptic_f`



```

Changing keywords from "fricas intergate symbolic" to "fricas".

How does one test the above fix?  Does one need to wait for sagemath 9.7 beta 6?  I know nothing about using github. I only know how to download the zip file and build sagemath from it.

I am afraid that without git it is not possible to test it. But using git and got trac is not hard, see the developers guide.

I cannot test and will not be able to. If tests pass with and without fricas, you can set to positive on my behalf.

I tested it both ways. LGTM.
