# Issue 22043: Giac miscompiles on non-x86_64 platforms

Issue created by migration from Trac.

One can maybe cheat and pass  "-D__x86_64__ -DSMARTPTR64" in CPPFLAGS but that's dirty, see:

I can confirm the issue. The trick fells very dirty but I can easily test it I think.

Has expected passing `-D__x86_64__ -DSMARTPTR64` choke the build. Fails as soon as we load gmp headers which complain about the ABI being unsupported.
Now by default the thing builds but fails in calling `pari`. We could temporarily disable building against `pari` on non x86 (`--disable-pari` in giac-1.2.3-13).

More fundamentally I suspect the way pari is called is what is really wrong here, as discussed on sage-packaging   https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/sage-packaging/ac9575ae-4dd3-4d29-97aa-a3ef785d3509%40googlegroups.com

I don't know if it helps but the 1.2.3.25 version such as in #22101 contains the modifications for pari asked there:

Still failing. Those changes are, I think are a progress but not the full changes that are needed - not that I would really be able to do them myself. The fact that we still have

```
#ifdef ENABLE_TLS
  extern THREAD void *PARI_stack_limit;
#else
   extern void *PARI_stack_limit;
#endif
```

which is a private function is a sign you are doing something wrong.

See http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-users-1702/msg00002.html for a suggestion from the PARI developers on how this should be fixed.

(1) What does this refer to:

> * http://xcas.e.ujf-grenoble.fr/XCAS/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=1723

(2) From the comments it seems that you think that there is a problem with PARI. Why do you think that?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2017-02-19 11:11:14

Note that compiling with `-D__x86_64__` obviously does not work due to the use of inline assembly in `ifactor.cc`.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2017-02-19 11:25:37

And compiling with `-DSMARTPTR64` (whatever that means) does not change anything.


---

Comment by frederichan created at 2017-02-28 12:16:27

There is a related topic (about SMARTPTR64 that should not be undefined by first.h)here:

I am not sure if it is the same error, but i cannot build+check `giac` on Debian Jessie 32bits, see the attached log. It fails at `chk_fhan1` and before there are tons of "bug in PARI/GP (Segmentation Fault), please report."

Since `giac` is a standard package, i set the priority to blocker.


---

Comment by tmonteil created at 2017-03-13 11:36:37

Changing priority from critical to blocker.

On linux 32bits there is the following problem  #22101 and it should be already solved by giac-1.2.3.25 but I am waiting the next one to have a new config.guess as it was requested in #22101.

Unless something happens real soon I'll ignore this for sage 7.6. If it isn't fixed we should think about downgrading giac to optional.

The snippet in the description is hopefully not repesentative of the giac code quality:
* Randomly mixed French / English names for identifiers.
* Use of reserved identifiers (starts with leading underscore + capital letter)

If the upgrade can not be done soon (i hope it could!), another possibility would be to downgrade `giac/giacpy_sage` to a previously working version. Indeed, `pynac` is standard and depends on `giac`.

`pynac` doesn't currently depend on `giac`. Ralf wants it to happen, but things keep getting in the way. Enabling giac in pynac will cause at least two doctests to fail.

If people running powerpc and other platforms coudl check #22101, it seems to solve the issue.

Trying it on ppc64.

Really? I thought it was only improving for i386. (cf comment4)
The only (small) news I have for other architecture are about 
arm64 from this topic:
http://xcas.e.ujf-grenoble.fr/XCAS/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=1785

where it seems that the static built of icas is functionnal while the original built crashes with 1+1


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2017-03-16 19:52:48

I can confirm nothing changed on ppc64.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2017-03-16 21:18:50

I think `SMARTPTR64` is unrelated to our problems. It is added in some pre-made makefile, some of them for the debian package specifically. But there is no way I can see for it to make its way in the build system on a regular build - any system. Same story for `DOUBLEVAL` but this time with windows and OS X - it could be of interest since on OS X it included ppc.


---

Comment by frederichan created at 2017-03-16 21:26:36

does

```
./configure --enable-shared=no
```

changes things?


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2017-03-16 21:30:14

I cannot test right now - I am waiting for a world update to finish on the machine (this is a gentoo prefix, everything is compiled) but I am putting it on the things to try.

Sorry, i meant it solves the issue on i386.

Currently for me every single tests fails (but I can do 1+1) on ppc64. Trying to run a test manually I get the following back trace which is slightly different from Jeroen

I have cut all the extra repetition of the pari signal handler. This is 1.2.2-105, with 1.2.3 compiled "statically" (same "test case"):

(Sorry just small news)
I have tried with qemu on the following:

```
Linux debianppc64 3.16.0-4-powerpc64le #1 SMP Debian 3.16.39-1+deb8u2 (2017-03-07) ppc64le GNU/Linux
```

to build giac on a basic debian (stable) system with just libgmp-dev and libmpfr-dev.

With the defaut compiler (gcc 4.9) I was able to built giac 1.2.3-31 and reproduce crashes with
1+1  or also  just by evaluating: e     (it should answer exp(1))

trying with e it seems that the string giving the name of a fonction was not correctly stored.

```
(gdb) p sommet.ptr()
$12 = (giac::unary_function_abstract *) 0xb7f71ee0
(gdb) p sommet.ptr()->s
Cannot access memory at address 0xb7f71ee8
```


NB: as I am under qemu I have 1cpu and my threads value was 1. (yours may differ, I don't know if you are able to do: threads:=1)



Then I tried to built with gcc 4.8 and I got a good version of giac.

My latest experiment on ppc64 build with `-O0 -ggdb`, pari and ntl disabled to simplify things and rule them out.

I guess that 
`g.sommet.ptr()->printsommet`
try to acces to the string representation of a usual symbol. so it looks similar to what I got.
May be the less confusing example is to just type: `e`  in icas, it should crash also for you  when trying to obtain the exp string while `d` should return d because it is not a reserved keyword. Could it be an loader ordering problem?

Typing `e` in `icas` segfault and that's what I get from the core dump

So you have the same debug as what I had with gcc4.9 in comment 26 where I put a break in symbolic.cc.

But for me, if after the built I rebuilt `icas` with `.libs/libgiac.a` instead of `.libs/libgiac.so` by doing in the src/ directory:


```
fred`@`debianppc64:~/giac-1.2.3-gcc49/src$ g++ -g -fno-strict-aliasing -DGIAC_GENERIC_CONSTANTS -o .libs/icas icas.o  ./.libs/libxcas.a /home/fred/giac-1.2.3-gcc49/src/.libs/libgiac.a -lreadline -ltermcap -lrt -lpthread -ldl -lm -lmpfr -lgmp
}}} 
then I can run `.libs/icas` without problems.

Indeed, if I configure giac with disable-shared, I can ask e in icas without sefgault.

This looks bad:

```
(gdb) p this->ref_FUNCptr()->ptr()
$8 = (giac::unary_function_abstract *) 0xffffe3a8
```

Address has been cut.

Comment by jpflori created at 2017-05-19 13:30:34

One can circumvent that by setting  `__x86_64__` but this automatically sets `SMARTPTR64` which might be broken on ppc64 because of endianness (vould work on ppc64le) and `_I386_` which includes assembly code.

I'm now trying with proper 64 bits pointers but without "smart" pointers.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2017-05-19 13:32:15

Oh yeah and on 64 bits systems, not using `SMARTPTR64` is doomed to fail because C(++) types of different lengths are used to access the `_FUNC_` part of a `gen`.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2017-05-19 15:20:48

And `double` storage trick fails because of byte order and is fixed when passing `-DDOUBLEVAL`.

Everything seems fine now, patches on their way.

Comment by jpflori created at 2017-05-24 13:51:05

I've been in contact with Bernard (Parisse = upstream) and made some efforts have been made towards more portability but according to my experiments not enough at the moment.
See:
* https://dev.geogebra.org/trac/browser/trunk/geogebra/giac/src/giac?rev=52930 and https://dev.geogebra.org/trac/browser/trunk/geogebra/giac/src/giac?rev=52967 to rename some `__x86_64__` to `x86_64` which is kind of a good move though I'd prefer a better macro name and why not just use `__LP64__`; and this does not prevent inclusion of x86_64 assembly on non-x86_64 and this change (as mine) covers at the same times part where we want pointers to be 64 bit but also long to be (or long long? which would make it more easy to deal with)...
* https://dev.geogebra.org/trac/browser/trunk/geogebra/giac/src/giac?rev=53251 to fix the type of `_FUNC_`
* https://dev.geogebra.org/trac/browser/trunk/geogebra/giac/src/giac?rev=52324 to use `SMARTPTR64` on (approximatively) `__LP64__` and `__LLP64__` archs; but there is still the endianness issue with smart pointers.
* there is still an endianness issue when smart pointers are not used and `DOUBLEVAL` is not defined but that should not happen when `x86_64` is defined.

Did you suggest the fix for libpng/lpng1x too ([/22159#comment:29 suggested on this comment])?


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2017-05-25 23:02:17

Which version is your starting point? I am trying with 1.2.3-25 at the moment (because I have it handy on ppc64 right now) and while it is an improvement there are still failures, and I seem to be hanging at `chk_morley_demo` and a few others.

Hum, the one pointed in this ticket.

The latest "unstable" (which might have become stable) tarball should have equivalent fixes.
See:
* https://dev.geogebra.org/trac/changeset/54223 for assembly and endianess issue.
* https://dev.geogebra.org/trac/changeset/54269 for smart pointer tweaking.

I guess you still have to pass `-Dx86_64` into `C[XX|PP]FLAGS` to make sure addresses are not cut at 32 bits.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2017-05-30 10:17:58

Note that using static or shared libraries makes no difference, both work well.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2017-05-31 08:35:44

Thanks to Bernard and debian folk work the latest stable version seems ok.
Pass `-Dx86_64` into `CPPFLAGS`.

I did not run giac testsuite though.

Ah, I never had trouble building it. Just running/testing it. It will be some work to get things to build with gcc 4.8.x, will have to find all the C++ dependencies before building.

Most tests seem to pass on my machine except for some numerical noise and some very long or looping tests I killed.

Could you please give me some hints on how to achieve this (which file to modify, and how) ?

(sorry for not being able to help on the review, i do not have any ppc machine, my intel 32bit VM is trying it right now, just in case)

Comment by jpflori created at 2017-06-15 12:16:34

Just patch the `Makefile` to use `-lpng16` rather than `-lpng`.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2017-06-15 12:20:46

Currently `giac` configure png with

```
CONFIG_PNG="yes"
AC_ARG_ENABLE(png,
        [AS_HELP_STRING([--enable-png], [Enable PNG library])],
        [ if test "x$enableval" = "xno"; then CONFIG_PNG="no"; fi], [])
  
if test "x$CONFIG_PNG" = "xyes"; then
   AC_CHECK_HEADERS(png.h, AC_CHECK_LIB(png,main))
fi
```

in `configure.in`. An option is to use `AC_CHECK_LIBS(main,[png16,png14,png12,png])` instead of `AC_CHECK_LIB`. For Jean-Pierre suggestion you have to do the replacement after configure is run. Because `AC_CHECK_LIB` is used `-lpng` is added to `LIBS` by configure.

For what it worth, giac-1.2.3.47 from this ticket compiles and pass self-tests on both my 64bit laptop and 32bit VM (both running Debian GNU/Linux jessie).

Ragarding building giac with png support, thanks Jean-Pierre and François for your hints, i opened #23262.

Comment by fbissey created at 2017-06-17 09:07:47

Unfortunately, I still have no luck on ppc64 with gcc-5.4.0. It is better than before in that some tests are now succeeding. But things seems to get stuck in a C++ allocator for a number of them.

Comment by jpflori created at 2017-06-19 09:37:40

Is `giac` itself functional?
That is: is it only failing its testsuite or is it completely broken as well?


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2017-06-19 09:47:17

Fair question. "1+1" works, the fact that some tests work means that it is working up to a point. I haven't tried to run the sage testsuite with it. Any tests I should run?


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2017-06-19 09:51:56

Maybe `sage -t src/sage/interfaces/giac.py` and `rings` and `symbolic` would tell you if it looks functional or not.

On my side, `giac` also fails a lot of its own testsuite, inlcuding bunch of numerical noise, but also more worrying stuff i did not investigate, but running tests as above seems to indicate it is good enough for sage.

Comment by fbissey created at 2017-06-19 12:10:36

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2017-06-19 12:10:36

OK, I did run those tests and the few failures I have are unrelated to `giac` (I'll have to investigate some of them more deeply but they are definitely not `giac`). I guess we can go ahead with this.

Comment by infinity0 created at 2017-06-24 13:34:04

Do you guys know _why_ the `-Dx86_64` is needed on ppc64? That is still a bug that should be fixed upstream. In theory upstream should [now be detecting](http://xcas.e.ujf-grenoble.fr/XCAS/viewtopic.php?p=8877#p8877) 64-bit in a cross-platform way so I'm confused why it fails on ppc64.


---

Comment by infinity0 created at 2017-06-24 13:35:03

(sorry, I have no idea why my comment there deleted the commit field)

(I can't seem to fix it either, even by Modifying the ticket with that commit)

Comment by infinity0 created at 2017-06-24 13:40:28

All tests pass for me for 1.2.3-51 on arm64 on Debian without further changes or extra flags, btw.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2017-06-24 20:27:35

I'll have to try 1.2.3-51 on ppc64 without extra flags then. 1.2.3-47 builds but a lot of tests fail for me. We may want to consider a further upgrade.

The removal of the commit when you comment further is a "feature" of track. It is annoying but not harmfull.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2017-06-24 21:46:16

Well, you probably don't have that problem but I allow compilation without gui, and sage itself doesn't depend on fltk

```
  bool has_graph3d(Fl_Widget * widget){
#ifdef HAVE_LIBFLTK
    Fl_Group * g=dynamic_cast<Fl_Group *>(widget);
```

Oooops! in src/Xcas.cc (line 3360) there goes your compilation failure if you don't have fltk.


---

Comment by infinity0 created at 2017-06-25 13:50:12

I have found that annoying too, in Debian I am forced to ship the non-GUI icas program (which is what Sage actually wants) together with the GUI xcas program, and it even links against X libraries. I've [filed a bug](http://xcas.e.ujf-grenoble.fr/XCAS/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=1812) about it upstream, hopefully they can fix it.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2017-06-25 22:01:40

Well, I pilled up some more in http://xcas.e.ujf-grenoble.fr/XCAS/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=1814 because your request, I felt, was much broader than mine (but yes something should be done about all that X stuff).


---

Comment by infinity0 created at 2017-07-19 12:08:17

Unfortunately giac fails to compile for me on a arm64 (aarch64) 4.9 Linux kernel:

http://xcas.e.ujf-grenoble.fr/XCAS/viewtopic.php?p=8941#p8941

It succeeded on a 3.16 Linux kernel though, as I reported above. Could someone reproduce this and if so re-open this ticket or open another one?

Comment by infinity0 created at 2017-07-19 12:14:23

A potential solution to this has been suggested on the Debian bug tracker: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=855078#29

I'll try to test it next week, in the meantime feel free to jump in ahead.
