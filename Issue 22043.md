(Sorry just small news)
I have tried with qemu on the following:

```
Linux debianppc64 3.16.0-4-powerpc64le #1 SMP Debian 3.16.39-1+deb8u2 (2017-03-07) ppc64le GNU/Linux
```

to build giac on a basic debian (stable) system with just libgmp-dev and libmpfr-dev.

With the defaut compiler (gcc 4.9) I was able to built giac 1.2.3-31 and reproduce crashes with
1+1  or also  just by evaluating: e     (it should answer exp(1))

trying with e it seems that the string giving the name of a fonction was not correctly stored.

```
(gdb) p sommet.ptr()
$12 = (giac::unary_function_abstract *) 0xb7f71ee0
(gdb) p sommet.ptr()->s
Cannot access memory at address 0xb7f71ee8
```


NB: as I am under qemu I have 1cpu and my threads value was 1. (yours may differ, I don't know if you are able to do: threads:=1)



Then I tried to built with gcc 4.8 and I got a good version of giac.

I guess that 
`g.sommet.ptr()->printsommet`
try to acces to the string representation of a usual symbol. so it looks similar to what I got.
May be the less confusing example is to just type: `e`  in icas, it should crash also for you  when trying to obtain the exp string while `d` should return d because it is not a reserved keyword. Could it be an loader ordering problem?

So you have the same debug as what I had with gcc4.9 in comment 26 where I put a break in symbolic.cc.

But for me, if after the built I rebuilt `icas` with `.libs/libgiac.a` instead of `.libs/libgiac.so` by doing in the src/ directory:


```
fred@debianppc64:~/giac-1.2.3-gcc49/src$ g++ -g -fno-strict-aliasing -DGIAC_GENERIC_CONSTANTS -o .libs/icas icas.o  ./.libs/libxcas.a /home/fred/giac-1.2.3-gcc49/src/.libs/libgiac.a -lreadline -ltermcap -lrt -lpthread -ldl -lm -lmpfr -lgmp
```
 
then I can run `.libs/icas` without problems.

I've been in contact with Bernard (Parisse = upstream) and made some efforts have been made towards more portability but according to my experiments not enough at the moment.
See:
* https://dev.geogebra.org/trac/browser/trunk/geogebra/giac/src/giac?rev=52930 and https://dev.geogebra.org/trac/browser/trunk/geogebra/giac/src/giac?rev=52967 to rename some `__x86_64__` to `x86_64` which is kind of a good move though I'd prefer a better macro name and why not just use `__LP64__`; and this does not prevent inclusion of x86_64 assembly on non-x86_64 and this change (as mine) covers at the same times part where we want pointers to be 64 bit but also long to be (or long long? which would make it more easy to deal with)...
* https://dev.geogebra.org/trac/browser/trunk/geogebra/giac/src/giac?rev=53251 to fix the type of `_FUNC_`
* https://dev.geogebra.org/trac/browser/trunk/geogebra/giac/src/giac?rev=52324 to use `SMARTPTR64` on (approximatively) `__LP64__` and `__LLP64__` archs; but there is still the endianness issue with smart pointers.
* there is still an endianness issue when smart pointers are not used and `DOUBLEVAL` is not defined but that should not happen when `x86_64` is defined.

Hum, the one pointed in this ticket.

The latest "unstable" (which might have become stable) tarball should have equivalent fixes.
See:
* https://dev.geogebra.org/trac/changeset/54223 for assembly and endianess issue.
* https://dev.geogebra.org/trac/changeset/54269 for smart pointer tweaking.

I guess you still have to pass `-Dx86_64` into `C[XX|PP]FLAGS` to make sure addresses are not cut at 32 bits.
