Symbolic expressions can be seen as programs for applying functions to numerics and symbolics. Non-numeric non-symbolics (NNNS, most of the rest of Sage) are usually not handled by symbolic functions, although they often allow the same operations and many of the functions. The manual workaround is to evaluate the expression "on `x`" and then to substitute `x` with the respective NNNS. We propose that `BuiltinFunction` automates this process.

Part of this is already duplicated in `rings.arith` but the need arises with symbolic functions returning polynomials, e.g. #16813. At the moment `BuiltinFunction` simply converts the NNNS argument, losing the type information.

The example is not the best.
