This ticket implements an algorithm for computing the determinant of a p-adic matrix based on the Smith normal form. It is much more stable (and actually also faster) than the generic algorithm (which is used currently).

`echenolize` should read `echelonize` twice.

I think I'll wait to review this until the dependency has been merged.
