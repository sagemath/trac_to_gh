openssl should not be optional. It is not only needed for "notebook(secure=True)" as explained in ticket #13385, but also for hashlib (md5). If it is not installed on the distro, sage won't start.

Usually, openssl is there so no problem happen, but since openssl is going from 0.9.8 to 1.0.0, we will experience problems with distros upgrades. For example, Debian is moving from openssl0.9.8 to openssl1.0.0 in the next stable release (currently frozen): if sage is compiled on squeeze and then run on wheezy, we get the following errors at startup:

```


If libssl.so.0.9.8 and libcrypto.so.0.9.8 is copied on the sage local/lib directory, the problem disapears and sage can start.

Well, it's not really an optional package, but rather there (more or less<sup>*</sup>) for convenience, since AFAIK OpenSSL is a prerequisite for Sage, which means it's up to the user (or administrator) to install it; doing `sage -i openssl` is probably just easier for some, others will (or should) use their distro's package manager in case it is missing.

[Haven't read sage-devel for a while; unless it isn't already, it should probably also be discussed / voted on there.]

<sup>*</sup> I vaguely remember problems with some formerly current 1.x version, such that we didn't upgrade the optional spkg to 1.x (it's meanwhile 1.0.1c), so the optional spkg was also there for those that would otherwise have installed an incompatible (1.x) version.
