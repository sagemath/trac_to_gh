# Issue 21577: Doctest continuation marker / geometry, sets

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21814

Original creator: jmantysalo

Every grepping of source code is easier if there is just one way to do something. Also some user might wonder if there is a difference between `...` and `....:`. Hence I suggest mass change from old-style doctest continuation lines.

This part does that in geometry and sets folders.

Done by


```
find src/sage/geometry src/sage/sets -name '*.py' -or -name '*.pyx' | xargs perl -e 's|^( *)\.\.\.  |\1....:|g;' -p -i.bak
```
