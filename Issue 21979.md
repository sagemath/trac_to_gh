# Issue 21979: Constructing a power series from PARI ignores the precision

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22216

Original creator: pbruin

Original creation time: 2017-01-20 08:50:36

In Sage 7.5:

```
sage: R.<T> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: R(pari('1 + O(T)'))
1
```

The answer should be `1 + O(T)`.
