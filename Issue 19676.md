The method `covering_radius` for linear codes (in `linear_code.py`), uses optional package Guava for Gap by default.

If this package is not installed, the method crashes without a proper error message. 

This ticket proposes a reimplementation of `covering_radius`, with a generic algorithm written in Python. If Guava is not installed on the user's system, it uses the generic algorithm, else it uses the Guava one.

Could you only nest inside of the try/except what needs to be, i.e. the 'load_package' command?

As it is, any 'RuntimError' raised by another line would be interpreted as a missing package, though it may well have another cause.

Thanks,

It actually seems that

calls an error message which invites the user to install Guava if it's not installed.

Anyway, I went back to a (proper) `try`-`except` block.

Hi

this is incredibly slow, up to the point of being not usable. Yet the code is correct, works on very small instances, and tests are passed.

I send the status to positive review.

We don't really need Guava, there's all we need in gap.

I provide a sample implementation but it's buggy (try it with the code `codes.ExtendedQuadraticResidueCode(17, GF(4))`)

The branch up there could also be used in #21339 , and in the method `_build_lookup_table` from `linear_code.py`

This branch is quite efficient and computes the 177147 coset_leaders of a random linear code [30, 19] over GF(3) in less than 4 seconds, and the covering radius (5 in my example) in 3 seconds.
