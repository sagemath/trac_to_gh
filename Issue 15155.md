Working with Brian Stout we've translated Alexander Molnar's minimal model algorithm/code to work within Sage. A few minors changes from his original work, but the algorithm remains unchanged.

Hello,

It is very good that the code is documented and contains references! But there are several problem with the documentation (see [sage developer guide](http://sagemath.github.io/git-developer-guide/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings)).

1) there are trailing whitespaces

2) the indentation is not good. The blocks INPUT, EXAMPLES must have the same identation as the documentation and you must have a blankline between the block name EXAMPLES and its content (for example lines 201-202 are wrong).

```
def my_function(arg1, arg2):
    """
    This is a nice function

    INPUT:

    - ``arg1`` - a first nice argument

    - ``arg2`` - an other nice argument

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: my_function(8,3)
 
    We can also use the function with strings::

        sage: my_function('toto', 'bibi')
    """
```


3) Bibliography is not set up properly

4) In the examples (at least) respect the convention "my_variable = f()" and do not use "my_variable=f()". If possible, try to be coherent in function arguments and prefer "def f(a, b=3, c=4)" to "def f(a,b = 3, c=4)".

5) For the name I guess "is_affine_minimal" is more suited than "affine_minimal".

Yes, 1,2,4 are all simple changes that need to be made.  3 was waiting to add an additional citation (which I have now) and will be fixed as well.

5 I disagree with. The minimalmodel.py file is not exposed to the user, so neither is affine_minimal. The two functions exposed to the user are

is_minimal_model() and minimal_model()

Part of the original citation is that it is enough for minimal to check affine minimal, so those names should be fine.

Some comments from Alex Molnar:

I ... have finally looked through the code. I only glossed the parts that appear unchanged (with the original code side-by-side) and otherwise think the adaptation to projective morphisms looks good.

Just two minor comments. In line 206, I think you mean ``vp`` to ``newvp``, and in line 1453 ``self`` is written ``sefl``.

I've updated the patch to make those minor corrections.

I'm noticing it's awfully slow! I think I tried a similar thing with the magma version and that was quite quick. Initial impression is that this is just a sage problem:

so it looks like just constructing the polynomials is an expensive proposition already. `bCheck` does take quite a bit of time by itself too, so there may be some algorithmic issues too. Perhaps we don't care about performance at this point?

(Ah, I see: there are lots of polynomial rings constructed *inside* functions. That shouldn't happen)

Some possible packaging problems:
- I think the file name `sage/schemes/projective/minimal_model.py` will cause problems later on: there are all kinds of projective schemes that have their own concept of minimality, so I think it should be `endP1_minimal_model` or something more appetizing.
- `phi.is_minimal_model` reads a little strange: `phi` is supposed to be an endomorphism on a `P1` (with coordinate choice, i.e., with `0,1,infty` marked), not a model of one. Would is_PGL_minimal be better (or perhaps is_minimal)?

Those changes look good.

I have thought about the naming and see your point on the file name. Although, I'm inclined to be optimistic for the future and call it `endPN_minimal_model`. This will also allow consistent naming for other algorithms for endomorphisms of PN.

I'm also happy to call the function `is_PGL_minimal`.

Yes. we should just update the doctest as well as we made our best guess as to what a reasonable test was for the individual functions.

Looks good to me. Incidentally, the name `is_PGL_minimal` might not be the best name. It's certainly descriptive, but the spelling is perhaps a little painful relative to the rest of sage?

Some very small points:

The fact that

```
sage: phi.minimal_model().resultant()
```

doesn't work seems a little strange. Shouldn't it be `return_conjugation=False` by default, so that the default returns a value that can be immediately used rather than needing unpacking? Also, wouldn't `return_transformation` be a better name? 

Certainly in the doctest:

```
     sage: f.minimal_model(False)
```

should refer to the keyword argument by keyword, i.e.,

```
     sage: f.minimal_model(return_transformation=False)
```

A "positional" false is rather unclear here, even though it works.

Finally (and this is for another ticket): If we're "minimizing" rational transformations, shouldn't we also be "reducing" them, i.e., compute an SL(2,Z) transformation that makes the coefficients small? The most simple approach would be to "reduce" the binary form describing the fixed points or (if that's too degenerate) the points of period n for some small n.

See [Stoll, Michael; Cremona, John E., On the reduction theory of binary forms. J. Reine Angew. Math. 565 (2003), 79–99.], which is fairly easy to implement and which would be useful to have in sage anyway.

Replying to [comment:15 bhutz]:
> I do have the two optional parameters as positional that is why it is positional in the doctest.

No, in Python, *all* named arguments can be addressed via keyword. So I wasn't suggesting changing the code, only using the doctest to encourage addressing this option by key. If you prefer, you can still address it by position in your own code. It's just that

```
phi.minimal_model(True)
```

isn't very self-documenting.

I think the patch update didn't quite work. Do you want to stick with `return_conjugation` rather than `return_transformation`?
