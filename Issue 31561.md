He's still not happy, but this seems due to the lack of coverage in the dependency #31764.

Btw, with Python 3, shouldn't the `non_ascii` plugin be removed from the pathbot? It generates a false alarm here.

I don't understand the pyflakes errors reported by the patchbot. Do you?

The patchbot report at the very top refers to the commit before I merged in the latest version of #31764.

That's strange. Given the dates, this patchbot should have run on the latest commit. Anyway, everything is fine. Thanks for these new functionalities!
