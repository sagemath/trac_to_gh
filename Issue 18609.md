This ticket summarizes the work done in the [ACTIS project](https://bitbucket.org/lucasdavid/sage_coding_project/wiki/Home).

The aim of this project is to provide a lot of new code families, with a new structure to fully support specific encoding and decoding for these code families.

The following table gives a quick access to all tickets related to the project.

The `Nature` column gives the "type" of the ticket :
- `Structure` means it's a structural ticket, which does not require any knowledge in coding theory. It will be for tickets which introduce new mechanisms in the API.
- `Cleanup` means it's a ticket that refreshes old existing code of the coding library, and/or documentation. It does not require any knowledge in coding theory.
- `Content` means it adds new mathematical content (code families, decoding algorithms, ...) to Sage. Some knowledge on the topic might be useful for these tickets.

I've ported the information on this meta-page to a dedicated Trac Wiki roadmap page: https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/SageCodingRoadMap
