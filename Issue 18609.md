This ticket summarizes the work done in the [ACTIS project](https://bitbucket.org/lucasdavid/sage_coding_project/wiki/Home).

The aim of this project is to provide a lot of new code families, with a new structure to fully support specific encoding and decoding for these code families.

The following table gives a quick access to all tickets related to the project.

The `Nature` column gives the "type" of the ticket :
- `Structure` means it's a structural ticket, which does not require any knowledge in coding theory. It will be for tickets which introduce new mechanisms in the API.
- `Cleanup` means it's a ticket that refreshes old existing code of the coding library, and/or documentation. It does not require any knowledge in coding theory.
- `Content` means it adds new mathematical content (code families, decoding algorithms, ...) to Sage. Some knowledge on the topic might be useful for these tickets.
