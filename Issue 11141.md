When this was discussed on sage-devel (please don't ask me to find the thread again), somebody suggested that having a uniform format

```
Trac #54321: change foo to bar
```

could be useful for scripts.  I would find a version of "hg blame" with ticket numbers quite interesting.  If somebody would implement this, then the standard-format ticket numbers would certainly be useful.
