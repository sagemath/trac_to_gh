Implement an interface to http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/Gprof2Dot, so that one could just do:


```
    sage: from sage.misc.dev_tools import gprof
    sage: gprof("list(SymmetricGroup(3))")
```


and have a window pop up showing up the call graph. This would typically be implemented by calling Gprof2Dot and xdot.
