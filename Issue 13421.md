Assignee: jason, was

See [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1888/put-title-on-matrix_plot), where elcojon gives this example.

```
piclabels = ('width [px]','height [px]')
import scipy 
data = scipy.lena()
matrix_plot(data,axes_labels=piclabels, title='Lena image')
```

[This is the Trac macro *Image* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments ())](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#Image-macro)

This is fallout from the great *new* functionality in #10512.

It's a bug in mpl. It shouldn't be our job to move title positions around. The bug is because of `tick_top()` that is used.

```
sage: from matplotlib.figure import Figure
sage: figure = Figure()
sage: subplot = figure.add_subplot(111)
sage: import numpy as np
sage: M = np.identity(50)
sage: subplot.imshow(M)
<matplotlib.image.AxesImage object at 0x8bc0650>
sage: subplot.xaxis.tick_top()   # <--------- this introduces the bug
sage: subplot.set_title('a title')
<matplotlib.text.Text object at 0x8c54610>
sage: from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg
sage: figure.set_canvas(FigureCanvasAgg(figure))
sage: figure.savefig('/tmp/a.png')
sage: !feh /tmp/a.png
```


EDIT: the problem with shifting title positions by ourselves is that the title will be quite a bit off vertically in normal plots. Definitely not what we desire.

Ok. This is fixed now. The problem with the patch was that custom `title_pos` was being overridden with `title_pos=(0.5,1.05)`. I forgot to take care of this case when I removed this keyword from ``@`options()`.

Okay, looks good overall, I can do all kinds of goofy things!  I like these patches, sorry for the delay.

I do think we need a little better error catching.

```
sage: plot(sin, -4, 4, title='Plot sin(x)', title_pos=.05)
<snip>
   2482         if title is not None:
   2483             if title_pos is not None:

   2486                                      "of two real numbers.")

TypeError: object of type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral' has no len()
```

A subtle difference, but this should also tell the user that `title_pos` must be the right format.
