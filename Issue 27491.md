Keywords: polytopes, non-rational

Having #25097 at hand, we can now look at more complicated constructions of polytopes. 

Perles and Grünbaum gave examples using Gale diagrams, see Section 5.4 of _Convex polytopes_ of Grünbaum and Section 7 of _Lectures on Polytopes_ of Ziegler.

Perles configuration and the _projective construction_ of `sqrt(2)` (see Exercise 4 in §5.4) give several nice examples of non-rational polytopes.

This ticket provides these polytopes and explain the construction in a tutorial.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

Moving some tickets to 9.2. This is not a promise that I will be working on them.

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
