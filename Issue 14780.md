I've imported the patch and made one tiny change in `_evalf_` to fix a couple of doctests.

Some minor review tweaks from me, but if you're okay with them, then positive review.

Is 'Merzbacher' available online, so that we can do a real reference?  Just wondering.

I think the citation was just copied from the [Maxima documentation](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/en/maxima_70.html), which refers to Eugen Merzbacher _Quantum Mechanics_ (2nd edition, 1970).

Frankly, I can't make sense of that. What is 9.64 supposed to refer it? Surely not equation 9.64 in http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/~ting/other/QM_Merzbacher.pdf

Should we just remove the reference?

Fine with me.

I gather this is now positive?
