`@`chapoton I commented `vct` rather than deleting the line to keep consistency with
the comments below in the code. 
Do you think the comments 

```
        # vct = self.parent()._folded_ct
        # sigma = vct.folding_orbit()
        # gammatilde = list(vct.scaling_factors())
        # gammatilde[-1] = 2
}}} 
are helpful or do you think we should delete them?

oh, we can keep them.

green bot => positive review.

Do you have a patchbot at your disposal that you could launch on this ticket ? Mines are already busy right now.
