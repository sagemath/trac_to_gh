`@`chapoton I commented `vct` rather than deleting the line to keep consistency with
the comments below in the code. 
Do you think the comments 

```
        # vct = self.parent()._folded_ct
        # sigma = vct.folding_orbit()
        # gammatilde = list(vct.scaling_factors())
        # gammatilde[-1] = 2
```
 
are helpful or do you think we should delete them?
