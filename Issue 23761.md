Keywords: euclidean division, number field

Sage incorrectly perform division in (euclidean) rings of algebraic integers. Take:

```
K.<theta> = QuadraticField(-3)
R = K.OK()
```

Then $R = \mathbb{Z}\bigl[\frac{1+\sqrt{-3}}{2}\bigr]$ is an Euclidean ring, hence admits division with remainder. Let us take two elements of $R$:

```
a = R(508*theta); print "a =", a
b = R(1-33*theta); print "b =", b
```

and divide them:

```
r = a.mod(b); print "r =", r
```

The result is $r = 508*\sqrt{-3} = a$ and this is purely wrong as the norms are

```
print "N(r) =", r.norm()
print "N(b) =", b.norm()
```

$N(r) = 774192$ and $N(b) = 3268$.

On the other hand, Magma performs the division properly 

```
K<theta> := QuadraticField(-3);
R := RingOfIntegers(K);
a := R!(508*theta); print "a =", a;
b := R!(1-33*theta); print "b =", b;
print "r = ", a mod b;
```

and returns r =  26*$.2 + 2. Here $.2 is the generator of $R$.

Looks like a duplicate of #23971.
