After plain docstring unicode errors (#21982) there are 2 times 2 problems:

- `lambda (a, b):` -syntax at `src/sage/graphs/generators/smallgraphs.py` and `src/sage/combinat/matrices/hadamard_matrix.py`. These are easy.

- Some kind of `for i in [1,2], [3,4]` -error in `src/sage/combinat/designs/database.py` and `src/sage/combinat/root_system/coxeter_type.py`. Not sure what to do - Frédéric?

After these we should have empty `noerrors` from

```
find src/sage/ -name '*.py' | while read f; do python3 -m py_compile $f 2>&1 |
egrep -q . && echo $f >> errors || echo $f >> noerrors ; done
```

The syntax `for i in [1,2], [3,4]` is correct in Python 3, so what is the problem?

Something like `[f(x) for x in [1, 2], [3, 4]]` I guess. But just run

```
python3 -m py_compile src/sage/combinat/root_system/coxeter_type.py
```

to see.

Found it. Actually it just that Python2 allows `[x for x in 1, 2, 3]` but Python3 does not. It is explained here: http://python-history.blogspot.fi/2010/06/from-list-comprehensions-to-generator.html

I can make the patch.

Good point. Maybe I should read the code I am changing. Well, next time then.
