This bug has been seen on several systems. See:

Here on an OpenSolaris x86 machine, but also seen on Linux x86 and PPC OS X 10.4.

------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

The bug appears to be in Pynac, as running GDB shows:

True, but a program should not crash with invalid user input. In fact generating invalid input  is a common way of testing software, to improve quality. Sometimes it's called *Fuzz testing* - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing. 


http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-fuzztest.html
says "Fuzz testing is a simple technique that can have a profound effect on your code quality."

IEEE 610.12:1990. *Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology*. defines:

* Error tolerance - the ability of a system or component to continue normal operating despite the presence of erroneous inputs. 
 
It's actually a common way for hackers to hack software. 

Developing some code to feed Sage invalid input to try to crash Sage, or otherwise leave it in a poor state, would make a very useful student project!

Okay, and this also fixes things on Macintel 10.6.  Even more positive review.

> Developing some code to feed Sage invalid input to try to crash Sage, or otherwise leave it in a poor state, would make a very useful student project!

Agreed.

Incidentally, (unrelated to this ticket, but inspired by reviewing it) I was noticing that a whole slew of the compiler warnings while building Sage are like this

```
cc1plus: warning: command line option "-Wstrict-prototypes" is valid for C/ObjC but not for C++
```

Is it possible that a simple change to whatever flags are passed to Sage while compiling C++ (as opposed to C) in the core Sage library would remove all those warnings?  Apparently gcc just ignores this option, but it's all over.  I have no idea which Sage .pyx files become C and which become C++, of course.
