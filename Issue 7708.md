I have created an enhanced and updated version of openopt. It is a pre release of the next 0.28 release (revision 404). Once 0.28 is released, upgrade should be easy. 

1. it now consists of 3 packages, all togehter are called the "OO-Suite". and hence I've included all three.
2. I have to disable the preparser `preparser(False)` to get examples for all three packages working.
