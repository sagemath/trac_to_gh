This patch adds a function that can be used to check if a lattice is subdirectly reducible. There is no "interface" yet.

Martin, is related to congruences and needs review. Travis, contains a non-related crosslinks in `SetPartitions`.

I think this should have some more documentation since there are no frontend methods. Specifically, could you add a short definition (or link to a definition) of the congruence lattice?

Also, a small grammar change:

```diff
         ALGORITHM:
 
         Every atom is a join-irreducible. Every join-irreducible of
         `\mathrm{Con}(L)` is a principal congruence generated by a
-        meet-irreducible element and the only element covering it. (And also
-        by a join-irreducible element and the only element covered by it.)
+        meet-irreducible element and the only element covering it (and also
+        by a join-irreducible element and the only element covered by it).
         Hence we check those principal congruences to find the minimal ones.
```

Like this?

I think it is necessary to have definitions on frontend. However, it feels odd to copy them to internal functions. But then `lattices.py` should depend on `hasse_diagram.py`, not other way, so this link would go to "wrong direction" in some sense.

Btw, I think that explaining congruence would be best done with a picture.

Since this will probably end up being on the front-end at the end of the day, it will probably be moved there. However, I just wanted something there for reference until that happens. Thanks.
