## Making new reports

While only trac admins are able to create new reports, any user can make a *[custom query](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/query)* and link to it from this page.  If you make something you think will be useful to others, share it here!

If there's a report that you can't make with the custom query functionality, talk to a trac admin or e-mail sage-devel`@`googlegroups.com.  The database schema is [ here](DBSchema-) if you want to know what kinds of reports are possible.
