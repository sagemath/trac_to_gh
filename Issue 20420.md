This is a follow-up on #20461.

 * a new `MixedIntegerLinearProgram.copy` method that takes a `names` keyword argument, enabling this operation:

```
sage: p.<x,y> = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: q.<newx,newy> = p.copy()
```

  and the less magical syntax

```
sage: q, newx, newy = p.copy([x, y])
```

 * if `MixedIntegerLinearProgram.new_variable` has been called, it should set a flag and then if `__copy__` (or `__deepcopy__`) are called, it should display a warning (deprecation??) and refer the user to the new `copy` method.
