There is a method 'canonicalize_radical' for scalares and vectors but not for matrices. The goal of this ticket is to create one for matrices.

This will work for now, but I think a better long-term solution would be to mimic what symbolic vectors do (i.e., not have individual methods with doctests), possibly having a mixin class that abstracts that behavior.
