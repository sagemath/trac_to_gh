Code LGTM: The new `tamari_sorting_tuple` differs from the old `_tamari_sorting_tuple` only in that the `i`-th entry (counting from `0`) has gotten `i` subtracted from it; this clearly preserves the componentwise order and the componentwise meet.

Added a few comments, though. Will push in a minute (new branch).
