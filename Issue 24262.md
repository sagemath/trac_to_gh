Code LGTM: The new `tamari_sorting_tuple` differs from the old `_tamari_sorting_tuple` only in that the `i`-th entry (counting from `0`) has gotten `i` subtracted from it; this clearly preserves the componentwise order and the componentwise meet.

Added a few comments, though. Will push in a minute (new branch).

Thanks for the added doc. Looks good.

I am afraid that the link `:meth:` in `from_tamari_sorting_tuple` will not work.

Oops, you're right. It should be :meth:`sage.combinat.binary_tree.BinaryTree.tamari_sorting_tuple`. Can you fix this? (My cygwin is updating right now...)
