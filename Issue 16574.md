CC:  @pjbruin

Keywords: polynomial, field

The following blows up instead of just raising a Python exception:

```
sage: F = GF(7)
sage: PF.<x> = F[]
sage: x/PF.zero()
  <BOOM>
```

This issue is very similar (but slightly different) to #12217.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16811
