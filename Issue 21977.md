I think that you should add

```
from __future__ import absolute_import
```

to all those files to prevent regressions.

I agree with Jeroen, please add the future imports.

How did you discover these compiling errors ? Could you please explain ?

I added `'language_level': 3,` to the compiler directives in _src/setup.py_ (about line 405).

Patchbot is (essentially) green, so positive review.
