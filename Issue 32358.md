Actually, unpacking the tarball and running `grep -R print` seems to show that this version of nose uses Python2 language.

So, we should either remove `nose` (and ensure that everything that depends on it can rely on some alternative), or move to `nose2`.

Does this need a vote in sage-devel? If so, I suggest starting one vote to remove nose and replace that with pytest as a standard package.

I don't think there's strictly a need to make `pytest` standard -- we have conditionalized it on SAGE_CHECK. But let's do this anyway. A vote on `pytest` is a good idea. 

No need to vote on `nose` - we remove stuff that is not needed any more all the time.
