Sorry for taking so long to look at this. IMO, Mason insertion should go into the `rsk.py` file as it is a similar sort of insertion algorithm and be added as an option to `RSK`. Although I am not fully convinced that is the best place because the result is a `CompositionTableau` rather than a `Tableau`, but it runs parallel enough that I think it is fine. Plus it is more discoverable as part of `RSK`. The other option is we create a new `insertion_algorithm.py` file and add it there. Something else to consider is adding a `mason_insert()` method to `CompositionTableau` (or moving the `mason_insert` function there). Your thoughts?

There are also some methods that do not have docstrings and some of the one-line descriptions do not match Sage's formatting (it starts on the next line after `"""`).
