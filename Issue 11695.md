The next version of Singular does some major refactoring, in particular splits off polynomial handling into libpolys and introduces the coeffs struct that holds the coefficient ring (base ring) information just like the ring struct holds the information about polys.

Updated spkg: http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/singular-3-9-9.spkg

WARNING: This is not working yet, major breakage in the Sage library needs to be fixed.
