Hi David!

Thanks for the fix. I am just don't understand how comes those tests did pass before? Which version are you applying this patch onto?

Sorry.  This is against sage-5.0.beta1, and the patch fails to apply to sage-4.8.  I don't understand why the doctest was succeeding earlier, but sage -t succeeded on my build of sage-5.0.beta1 on sage.math.

This applies cleanly to 5.1.beta0 and fixes the interactive problem. Positive review.
