You should add `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` as the first line of the Python file, then you can use any utf-8 in docstrings.

Completely breaks src/sage/modular/ssmod/ssmod.py, possibly other stuff. Run the testsuite...

Sorry about that.

There was an error in arithgroup_generic.py, where the weight needed to be coerced into ZZ to make expressions like 'k // ZZ(4)' work properly. Now this is fixed.

I added doctesting for computing dimensions for Gamma0 in arithgroup_generic.py.

Now running sage -testall yields no errors.
