Sorry about that.

There was an error in arithgroup_generic.py, where the weight needed to be coerced into ZZ to make expressions like 'k // ZZ(4)' work properly. Now this is fixed.

I added doctesting for computing dimensions for Gamma0 in arithgroup_generic.py.

Now running sage -testall yields no errors.
