# Issue 4365: typo in license()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/4365

Original creator: was

Original creation time: 2008-10-24 19:13:46

Assignee: cwitty

From Kevin Buzzard:

```
If I type

license()

from a window then I get a huge text file. About 12 lines down it says

"...However, SAGE not have any link to jsmath"

which is probably a grammatical typo. I only mention this because the license file is presumably supposed to be some kind of legal document.
```

I think the said typo has been fixed in #1389 by the patch *copying.patch*. All patches attached with that ticket have received positive review. As to whether every patch from #1389 has been merged, I don't know.
