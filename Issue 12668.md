Updated the patch because I forgot to raise a `ZeroDivisionError` in `__invert__`. Fixed now.

After applying the patch and the spkg and rebuilding the polybori spkg, sage -br failed with

```
gcc -pthread -shared -L/mnt/local/king/SAGE/stable/sage-5.0.beta13/local/lib build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.o -L/mnt/local/king/SAGE/stable/sage-5.0.beta13/local/lib -L/mnt/local/king/SAGE/stable/sage-5.0.beta13/local/lib -lcsage -liml -lpari -lm -lgmp -lcblas -latlas -lstdc++ -lntl -lpython2.7 -o build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.so

```

No error message, I am afraid.

PS: That was with sage-5.0.beta13 plus a lot of patches, but none of them changing matrices.

And repeating sage -br, I finally got a proper error:

```

Yes, #12841 is a dependency of this ticket.


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-05-03 15:50:24

Ouch. I missed #12841. Sorry.


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-05-03 15:54:54

Am I right that both spkgs have to be installed, but #12840 goes before #12841?


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-05-03 16:04:12

Yippie! Applying the patches from #12840 and #12841, installing the new m4ri spkg from here, then installing the new m4rie spkg from #12841 (why is it on a different ticket? Can one live without the other?), re-installing polybori and finally sage -br, Sage starts!

No, you're right, they are co-dependent.

First of all: make ptestlong works with the two new spkgs (even though I have a few other patches applied...).

Here is a small timing.

Vanilla Sage-5.0.rc0:

```
sage: K = GF(2)
sage: %time A = random_matrix(K,20000,20000)
CPU times: user 0.29 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.31 s
Wall time: 0.31 s
sage: %time B = random_matrix(K,20000,20000)
CPU times: user 0.23 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 0.26 s
Wall time: 0.27 s
sage: %time (A*B).rank()
CPU times: user 11.70 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 11.75 s
Wall time: 11.81 s
19937
```


Sage-5.0.beta13 with the new spkgs (and some other patches that shouldn't affect the timing for matrix multiplication):

```
sage: K = GF(2)
sage: %time A = random_matrix(K,20000,20000)
CPU times: user 0.30 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 0.33 s
Wall time: 0.33 s
sage: %time B = random_matrix(K,20000,20000)
CPU times: user 0.32 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.33 s
Wall time: 0.33 s
sage: %time (A*B).rank()
CPU times: user 11.70 s, sys: 0.10 s, total: 11.80 s
Wall time: 11.83 s
19937
```

Well, at least there is no slow-down...

Do you claim that the new version of M4RI is faster? You do claim a speed-up for M4RIE, on #12841.

Replying to [comment:18 SimonKing]:

No, M4RI shouldn't have changed (at least the stuff, only bugfixes & refactoring. 

That said, there's a new function for inverting upper triangular matrices which is much faster than the generic method, but it's not exposed yet. I need to implement the same for lower triangular matrices, then we can speed up inversions in general.

Furthermore, M4RI ships its own PNG reader/writer now which is much faster than what we have in Sage and uses much less memory. Again, it's not used yet. This patch just gets the new version in.

Since make ptestlong passes and the hg repository in the package is fine and SPKG.txt is up to date, I think I can give a positive review. However, I only tested on one platform. So, if the release manager believes that this is not enough, then please speak up!

Note that there is no file `/usr/lib64/libpng.so`, so obviously there cannot be proper PNG support on this machine.  I consider this to be an upstream (not Sage) error.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-05-08 12:07:40

Why are you using `PKG_CHECK_MODULES()` to check for PNG support in `configure.ac`?  Why not `AC_CHECK_LIB()` or `AC_SEARCH_LIBS()`?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-05-08 13:12:37

Exactly the same problem with `-lpng` happens on Skynet "cleo" (RHEL 5.3 ia64)

Replying to [comment:24 jdemeyer]:

We are doing both. We try `pkg-config` first and if that fails we fall back to `AC_CHECK_LIB`. In your log above, `PKG_CHECK_MODULES()` fails to find libpng and `AC_CHECK_LIB()` finds it.


---

Comment by malb created at 2012-05-08 20:33:24

Note that stand-alone M4RI builds fine on eno.


```
checking pkg-config is at least version 0.9.0... yes
checking for PNG... no
checking for PNG... no
checking for PNG... no
checking for PNG... no
checking for png_create_write_struct in -lpng... no
```


So I don't know why it fails when built inside Sage. In any case, Sage *ships* libpng so we should adapt `deps` to make M4RI dependent on libpng. I'll provide a patch to that effect.

Actually, it's not quite like that.  `PKG_CHECK_MODULES()` found `libpng12`  but you still try to link with `-lpng` instead of `-lpng12` (the first failure comes from the `libpng14` check).  `AC_CHECK_LIB()` isn't called (but it would fail).

I recommend against using `PKG_CHECK_MODULES()` and would use only `AC_SEARCH_LIBS()`.

The patch you attached is probably good, but that's just part of the problem.

Can you elaborate on that? I don't understand.

Well, I tried to explain in [http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12840#comment:28](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12840#comment:28).  The fact that

```
PKG_CHECK_MODULES([PNG], [libpng12])
```

succeeds, does not imply that the library file `libpng.so` exists.  I don't see what you're trying to accomplish with those `PKG_CHECK_MODULES()` checks.


---

I can try to write a patch if you like.

Ah, right. It would need `-lpng12`. Yep, that's a bug. I'll fix that next week-ish.

I am trying to use pkg-config for what it's intended. Making linking easier.

Maybe you're using it for _what_ it's intended, but not _how_ it's intended.

For some reason I missed this comment earlier, sorry. That makes sense & is an upstream bug which I intend to fix.

I know, but I have never done anything with pkgconfig, so I can't help more.

I could test the code on one or two linuxes. But I couldn't test whether the png problems on eno (as observed by Jeroen) are fixed. Jeroen, could you finish the review?

The *previous* version installed fine on eno within Sage.  It seems the `libpng` check is totally gone now.

That's strange, it doesn't check?

I had to update SPKG because I didn't add "-I$SAGE_LOCAL/include" before but we need it now because of the PNG dependency. The newest SPKG installs fine on geom.math which doesn't have a system libpng-dev.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-06-17 13:08:34

I've tried this on Fedora 17 (which doesn't have libpng12 either, its up to libpng15 now) and configure works as intended:

```
checking whether to build with PNG support... yes
checking for pkg-config... /usr/bin/pkg-config
checking pkg-config is at least version 0.9.0... yes
checking for PNG... yes
```

Jeroen, you might have overlooked this part in the log since it comes after the lengthy "checking for cache sizes...".

I'm building on eno right now and if it works I'll set this ticket to positive review.


---

Comment by malb created at 2012-06-17 13:48:20

So Fedora has libpng.so then? I am asking because I am not checking for png15 explicitly.


```
if test "x${want_png}" = "xyes" ; then
   PKG_CHECK_MODULES([PNG], [libpng],
      [have_libpng="yes"; LIBPNG_LIBADD=`pkg-config --libs libpng`],
      [have_libpng="no"])
   if ! test "x${have_libpng}" = "xyes" ; then
      AC_CHECK_LIB([png],
         [png_create_write_struct],
         [have_libpng="yes"; LIBPNG_LIBADD="-lpng"],
         [AC_CHECK_LIB([png14],
            [png_create_write_struct],
            [have_libpng="yes"; LIBPNG_LIBADD="-lpng14"],
            [AC_CHECK_LIB([png12],
               [png_create_write_struct],
               [have_libpng="yes"; LIBPNG_LIBADD="-lpng12"],
               [AC_CHECK_LIB([png10],
                  [png_create_write_struct],
                  [have_libpng="yes"; LIBPNG_LIBADD="-lpng10"],
                  [have_libpng="no"])
               ])

        ])
   fi
   if test "x${have_libpng}" = "xno" ; then
      AC_MSG_WARN([Can not find a usuable PNG library. Make sure that CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS are correctly set.])

Argh, I am stupid. It would find libpng12 as included in Sage. Sorry bout the noise.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-06-18 10:58:02

Yes the `PKG_CHECK_MODULES` test wins in Sage, which is the way it should be. pkg-config is the way to go imho. Though if libpng were to use standard libtool versioning we would live in a better world, too ;-)

In any case, built and tested fine on eno. Positive review.
