These two changes looks fine. However, there is a third place that should be done in parallel.

`periodic_points=self.lift_to_rational_periodic(pos_points,B)`

in self.rational_periodic_points()


Also, it is convention not to use [CamelCase](CamelCase) variables names. (i.e. parallelData, possiblePeriods should be not have the capital in them).

I'm also marking 15966 as a dependency since without the cleanup of the child process these create too many child process to function well.

Remember to set the status on tickets when it is ready for review again, but it is still needs_work so I'll leave it.

The functionality all checks out on my tests. However, with that last parallelization bit, there are 3 more doctests that are failing due to point order in projective_morphism.py. So you should sort those as well.

I'm getting some weird errors when I run the possible_periods over and over again (even on the same function). It seems to be somewhat random which error and whether or not an error occurs). I may or may not have corrupted my sage, but I don't want to leave this positive_review until I resolve it.

Errors like


```
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: number of arguments does not match number of variables in parent
```

and


```
 Traceback (most recent call last):
  ....
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Finite Field of size 2' and 'Finite Field of size 13'
