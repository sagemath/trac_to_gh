CC:  @egourgoulhon @tscrim @tobiasdiez

See #30189.

The current catalog only provides spheres of dimension two. A comprehensive and faster version will be added here.

Features:

- spherical and stereographic coordinates
- orientation
- radius and barycenter can be stated
- link to minimal triangulation in `homology` module
- initialized embedding such that extrinsic quantities can be derived

Follow-Ups:

- make `S^1`, `S^3` and `S^7` parallelizable
- Hopf coordinates on `S^3`
- link to Lie group structure on `S^1` and `S^3`

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30804

Establishing the stereographic projection in more than 3 dimensions is very demanding, even if you know the inverse. I know that you can speed these things up a little by turning off checking and choosing a suitable simplification. But do you know more workarounds?

I also suspect that the Jacobian takes a long time.

I agree. It is good to have these examples.

Please take a peek at this first approach. I'd appreciate if someone can take a closer look at the details, i.e. transition maps, choice of subsets etc.

I tried to cover spherical coordinates in arbitrary dimensions as well. But it turned out that the transition map to the stereographic coordinates is a bit complicated in the general setup.

A very good reference for the sphere in any dimension is Chapter 18 *The sphere for its own sake* in Marcel Berger: *Geometry*, vol. II, Universitext. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1987.

On general grounds, I don't think we should depart from Wikipedia conventions without a good reason. Moreover, I think it is standard convention to have the periodic coordinate on *S<sup>n</sup>* to be the last one (as in *(theta, phi)* for *S<sup>2</sup>*), not the first one.

We have to deviate from the Wikipedia convention anyway.

This is simply because the slit we take out for spherical coordinates should meet the poles. Currently, the north/south pole is encoded in the last coordinate. We can shift it to the first, and then we can recover the conventions in Wikipedia for spherical coordinates. But that would be another convention we break, namely for the stereographic projection.

I gave it a little thought. I think option 4 is best. Option 4 is in a way canonical: we obtain the convention for `S^1` and for `S^2`. It is only plausible then that the convention should be kept for higher dimensions as well (I don't know why it isn't so).

In addition, we don't need an extra class with facade pattern for 1D and 2D.

Agreed?

This sounds like a good plan.

I'm not sure if that works, but is it possible to add all these different conventions as additional charts? Then the user can decide which convention he wants to follow. This would also be the most flexible approach (e.g. to verify formulas in different conventions etc).

Some first few remarks:

- the reference to Berger should be *Geometry II*, not *Geometry I*
- the LaTeX formula in the docstring of `spherical_coordinates` is not correct; in particular, one should have x_n = cos phi_1, not x_n = cos phi_n
- could one have an option for the periodic coordinate phi_n to range in [0, 2*pi] instead of [-pi, pi]? Both conventions exist in the literature. What should be the default? (I would vote for [0, 2*pi])
