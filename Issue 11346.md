LattE is free software dedicated to the problems of counting and detecting lattice points inside convex polytopes, and the solution of integer programs. LattE contains the first ever implementation of Barvinok’s algorithm. LattE stands for “Lattice point Enumeration.” LattE was developed by a team directed by Jesús A. De Loera at UC Davis. See the official LattE web site for more information.

Didn't work for me:

Note that [https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/) now has the most up to date "latest version, LattE integrale, has the ability to directly compute integrals of polynomial functions over polytopes and in particular to do volume computations."
