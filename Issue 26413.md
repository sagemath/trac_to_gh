# Issue 26413: repr of max_symbolic and min_symbolic when passed a list argument

Issue created by migration from Trac.

I noticed in testing #24758 a minor issue when displaying symbolic min/max objects with `hold=True` that the repr is useless given a list argument:


```
sage: max_symbolic([1, 2], hold=True)
max(<listiterator object at 0x7fb40a873d50>)
```


This is a problem on both Python 2 and 3--it might be a regression too but I'm not sure.

Retargeting some of my tickets (somewhat optimistically for now).

Removing most of the rest of my open tickets out of the 8.7 milestone, which should be closed.
