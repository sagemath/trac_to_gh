Isn't this just replacing a meaningless test by another?

Replying to [comment:3 tscrim]:
> Isn't this just replacing a meaningless test by another?

Yes, perhaps. I didn't remove this one because I was dealing with comparison of `Element`s, and this test is about comparison of `Parent`s...

I would instead change that test to `J0(37) != 5` and/or `J0(37) != ZZ` (both of which should return `False` of course).

Done, though I do think it is out of scope (we're talking about a doctest for a Parent's `__cmp__` method, and while we certainly should get rid of this method, the only reason I touched the test here was that it also involved an Element).
