From [this ask answer](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/58144/calculation-with-arbitrary-precision/?answer=58151#post-id-58151), we have:


```
sage: RealIntervalField(200)(Ei(1))
1.8951178163559367554665209343316342690170605817327075916462273?

sage: RealIntervalField(200)(Ei(-1))
-0.21938393439552027367716377546012164903104729340690820757797849?
```


But:


```
sage: RealBallField(200)(Ei(1))
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded

sage: RealBallField(200)(Ei(-1))
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
```
