IPython 5.6 was released on 02 April 2018.

Among other improvements in this bugfix release, the
[IPython 5.6 release notes](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatsnew/version5.html#ipython-5-6)
mention that

- IPython should start faster, as it no longer looks for all available
  pygments styles on startup ([PR #10859](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/10859/)).

Changing keywords from "" to "upgrade, ipython".

Such Github-auto-generated "releases" are just an export of the git repo. They are typically *not* suitable as source tarball. For Python packages, the authoritative source is PyPI.

I would rather wait for 5.8 since that will contain a fix for #25373

Okay, I didn't realize that. I'll keep it in mind.
The release notes and PyPI releases are at:

- http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatsnew/version5.html
- https://pypi.org/project/ipython/#history

Do we have any indication whether 5.8 is soon to be released?
