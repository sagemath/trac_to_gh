Singular and symmetric are known to break because of misplaced libraries in link commands.  Symmetrica can be fixed by moving a '-lm' in one Makefile.  I describe the bug to the maintainer of symmetric in the following email; he has already replied and I confirmed that we would like him to fix the problem in the downloadable Symmetrica from the website.  Hopefully the official Symmetrica will contain this fix soon and we can incorporate the latest package in upcoming the upcoming Sage release.  Here's the email:

By the way, this is unrelated to the compiler, it's the linker.
