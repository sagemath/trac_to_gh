# Issue 23318: Bounding box bug in Polyhedron plots

Issue created by migration from Trac.

CC:  moritz

As reported on sage-devel here [#point1 (1)] and there [#point2 (2)], when creating a polyhedron far from the origin, the bounding box for the plot of the polyhedron includes the origin by default and it makes the polyhedron appear small. This appears to be a bug in the `polyhedron.plot` currently at line `1248` when an empty `Graphics3d` object is created.

(for reference) difference between 2d and 3d plots: 


```
sage: import itertools
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=itertools.product([100, 101], repeat=2)).plot() # OK, centered around the polyhedron
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=itertools.product([100, 101], repeat=3)).plot() # not centered, displays origin
```

This fixes it, I guess. 
Check out the doctest. If unpatched, the output should be
 {{{
((0.0, 0.0, 0.0), (101.0, 101.0, 101.0))
}}}
