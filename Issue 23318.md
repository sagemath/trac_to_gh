As reported on sage-devel here [#point1 (1)] and there [#point2 (2)], when creating a polyhedron far from the origin, the bounding box for the plot of the polyhedron includes the origin by default and it makes the polyhedron appear small. This appears to be a bug in the `polyhedron.plot` currently at line `1248` when an empty `Graphics3d` object is created.
