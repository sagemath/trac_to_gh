The function `have_same_parent(left, right)` is useful and needed to support the coercion model. However, that function not only checks whether parent are equal, but also whether `left` and `right` are both `Element`s and whether they have the same type. This information is checked, but lost when `have_same_parent` returns.

Instead, let us have a function `classify_elements(left, right)` which does the same checks as `have_same_parent()` (so it should be equally efficient), but returns all information.
