Thanks. I was confused why the checksum for #32431 were incorrect. That explains it.

I thought I had done #32441 from a different computer, but I guess I was in remote shell. Didn't catch on at that time.

Also I think commit a8a9437 needs to be dropped

This was on purpose. I accidently already commit `fast_arith.pyx`. But this is mostly to avoid merge conflicts in `convert_sage.pyx`, because both tickets append to that file. This will not work.

Hence the dependency on #30022.

I don't get it; can you not just rebase onto the branch of #30022, i.e., b4477dac79?

Indeed, it doesn't work. I tried to pull in only those files, but git couldn't even get it to work and I still had merge conflicts.
