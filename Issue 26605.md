# Issue 26605: Index error in FreeAbelianMonoid constructor

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: @mwageringel

Original creation time: 2018-12-06 07:42:46

CC:  jhpalmieri

Keywords: FreeAbelianMonoid, IndexError

This fixes an off-by-one index error when constructing a FreeAbelianMonoid with a string argument like this:

```
sage: FreeAbelianMonoid(names='x,y')
Free abelian monoid on 2 generators (x, y)
```

Previously, this was throwing an index error.

The same issue was recently fixed in #26221 for FreeMonoid.

Yes. I guess the bot does not start until the status is changed. If it is green, I would be happy if you could review.
