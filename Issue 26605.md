CC:  @jhpalmieri

Keywords: FreeAbelianMonoid, IndexError

This fixes an off-by-one index error when constructing a FreeAbelianMonoid with a string argument like this:

```
sage: FreeAbelianMonoid(names='x,y')
Free abelian monoid on 2 generators (x, y)
```

Previously, this was throwing an index error.

The same issue was recently fixed in #26221 for FreeMonoid.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26842
