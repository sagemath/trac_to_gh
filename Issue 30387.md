**Context**

Recent work on Sage's build system enables to use many
system packages as possible when building Sage.
See meta-ticket #27330 for an overview.

Part of that effort is to have `configure` end with
recommendations of extra system packages to install.

Making this recommendation system very precise would not
be sustainable. As a compromise, it recommends installing
packages whenever

- satisfactory versions of these packages
  are not found to be already installed
- some version of that OS has versions of these packages
  that would avoid having to build them

**Problem**

With the wording of the recommendation hint up to
Sage 9.2.beta12, users can be puzzled when it recommends
installing a package that is already installed.

**Solution**

Improve the recommendation message and along the way
make it better stand out.

Before this ticket:

```
configure: hint: installing the following system packages
is recommended and may avoid building some of the above SPKGs
from source:
configure:   $ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libcdd-dev libcdd-tools libnauty-dev
```

After this ticket:

```
configure:

    hint: installing the following system packages, if not
    already present, is recommended and may avoid building
    some of them from source (though some of them may
    have to be built anyway):

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install libcdd-dev libcdd-tools libnauty-dev

```

This change is not good. # is the shell comment character.
The idea here is that (if PROMPT is not used) that you get a valid shell script as the output.

```

Neither of the "notice: ...", "hint: ...",

So I tried to also avoid "# " for the text
on linking Homebrew's keg-only packages.

I just tested the branch on Ubuntu 18.04, I obtain:

```
configure:

    notice: the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages:

        _recommended boost coxeter3 gp2c igraph isl libsemigroups pari_elldata pari_galpol pari_nftables pari_seadata
        
checking for the package system in use... debian
configure:

    hint: installing the following system packages, if not
    already present, is recommended and may avoid having to
    build them (though some may have to be built anyway):

      $ sudo apt-get update 
      $ sudo apt-get install  texlive-generic-extra texlive-xetex latexmk pandoc dvipng default-jdk ffmpeg libavdevice-dev libboost-dev pari-gp2c libigraph-dev libisl-dev

    After installation, re-run configure using:

      $ ./config.status --recheck && ./config.status
         
```

Should `_recommended` be listed in the first list?
