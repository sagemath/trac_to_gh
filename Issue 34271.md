I made minor edits. In particular, I removed the link to the ticket since the docstring summarizes important points of the discussion in the ticket. (I don't like links to trac tickets in our documentation except obviously necessary cases.)

If you are okay, you can set positive-review.

I don't like them in parts of the reference manual dedicated to end users, either. But here I didn't mind about it.

Anyway, I'm fine with your changes. Thank you!

Exactly. In this case, end users are developers :)
