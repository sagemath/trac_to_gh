We provide a toolkit for the combinatorialist to help find functions ("statistics") `s: A -> Z` and bijections `A -> B` given sequences of finite sets `A` and `B` that satisfy various constraints.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33238

Comments welcome!  In particular, it would be wonderful to find more interesting applications.  

In short: given two finite sets `A` and `B`, a statistic `tau: B -> Z`, and a set partition `P` of `A`, the program finds all possible statistics `s: A -> Z` which have the same distribution as `tau` but are constant on the blocks of `P`.

There is still some ongoing work. In particular, we try to implement a cache of solutions, which is checked for counterexamples before asking the solver to produce a counterexample from scratch.

> You may want to try this with a better IP solver - see #31329 for SCIP

Excellent, I have now managed to install SCIP, and indeed, many doctests fail :-)

Previously, I only tested with gurobi (which was much faster), but apparently, we got sloppy during the last few big reorganisations.

I have found the culprit already - `deepcopy` takes forever:

```
sage: %prun next(bij.solutions_iterator())
         54830 function calls (54618 primitive calls) in 25.558 seconds

   Ordered by: internal time

   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
        1   24.908   24.908   24.908   24.908 {method '__deepcopy__' of 'sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram' objects}
   ...
```

vs.

(I don't know whether copy would suffice for my purpose, but it takes forever, too)

Since this is almost certainly a SCIP problem, I'm going back to needs-review.
