We provide a toolkit for the combinatorialist to help find functions ("statistics") `s: A -> Z` and bijections `A -> B` given sequences of finite sets `A` and `B` that satisfy various constraints.

Comments welcome!  In particular, it would be wonderful to find more interesting applications.  

In short: given two finite sets `A` and `B`, a statistic `tau: B -> Z`, and a set partition `P` of `A`, the program finds all possible statistics `s: A -> Z` which have the same distribution as `tau` but are constant on the blocks of `P`.

There is still some ongoing work. In particular, we try to implement a cache of solutions, which is checked for counterexamples before asking the solver to produce a counterexample from scratch.

There are still some doctests and some documentation missing, but otherwise this is ready.

You may want to try this with a better IP solver - see #31329 for SCIP
