I have several comments here:
- method `fractional_chromatic_number` could be in file `graph_coloring.py`

- The LP formulation using independent sets is elegant, but can be used on small graphs only. For instance, a 5x5 grid has already 55447 independent sets... You could add a "compact" formulation that could be used on larger graphs.

- You can also add simple optimization like partition into connected components.

Sure, should I move `fractional_chromatic_index` too? And what about `fractional_clique_number`? One does not usually arrive at the definition of fractional clique number via coloring, but they're dual LPs so very related!

I tried another formulation with `n^2` binary variables and `O(n^2)` fractional variables but it's effectively way slower.

You could add a note saying that the number of independent sets and the time to generate them can be huge.

> I forgot an optimisation which makes the LP smaller by using _maximal_ independent sets for the variables, 
OK

> and it could save some time and memory to index the LP variables by ints rather than frozensets.
> I don't know how to get around a call to `IndependentSets` of some kind though.

At least, you can do:

```
        Is = [frozenset(I) for I in IndependentSets(G, maximal=True)]
```

`IndependentSets` is an iterator, so your code generates twice each set. Furthermore, when you check `v in I`, it is way faster when `I` is a set and not a list.



Don't forget to check trivial cases like bipartite graphs.

I've added the optimisations we discussed. Apologies for (a) the pointless git noise on this ticket, and (b) the following silly issue. 

I can't see how to move a class method to another file. In `generic_graph.py` lines 23426-23443 it appears that one can simply write `from sage.module import method` inside the class definition to make `method` appear on the class, e.g.


```python
class Foo:
    from sage.module import method

f = Foo()
f.method() # works!
```


but any variation of this I have tried leads to sage crashing on start with an `ImportError`. The traceback is sufficiently cryptic that I can't diagnose the problem. 

For now I just add a one-line method the usual `def method():` way to the `sage.graphs.Graph` class that imports and calls the method defined in `sage.graphs.graph_coloring.py` that I want, but there should be a better way!

Strangely, I can't find a reference for the maximal thing, but here's a proof in pythonic pseudocode (since I can't see how to write math in a ticket):

  Let `Is` be the set of all independent sets of `G`, and `MIs` be the subset of `Is` consisting of maximal independent sets.
  
  If `w` is a nonnegative weight function on independent sets that is feasible in the LP, we have for all vertices `u` of the graph, `sum(w[I] for I in Is if u in I) >= 1`. 
  
  Suppose that there exists `J in Is` with `w[J] > 0` and a vertex `v` such that `J + [v] in Is`. Then form `x` from `w` by `x[J] = 0`, `x[J + [v]] = w[J] + w[J+[v]]`, and `x[I] = w[I]` for all other `I`. Then `x` is also feasible as moving weight to a larger independent set can only increase the sum of weights over `I in Is if u in I` and the objective values for `w` and `x` are the same by construction. By repeatedly applying this trick we obtain a weight function supported only on `MIs`.

There's a tradeoff though: if you consider all independent sets then it's valid to use the LP with equality constraints, but it is invalid to impose equality constraints *and* to drop variables corresponding to non-maximal independent sets (the LP can become infeasible).

Someone with better knowledge of the inner workings of LP solvers could make a call as to which is preferable. My understanding is that for some algorithms each inequality constraint is replaced by an additional variable and an equality constraint. But having two variables for each maximal independent set should still be cheaper than having a single variable for each independent set. I guess benchmarks are warranted, but I don't have the time.

I did required changes and
- removed parameter `only_maximal`. It is correct to consider only maximal independent sets and very costly to consider all independent sets. I added the only reference I know with an explanation of the correctness.
- use decomposition into biconnected components instead of simply connected components. It's faster this way.
