An introduction to Sage written in Catalan.  Attached is the introduction by Maria Bras Amoros.  Let's get this into the Sage standard documentation.  Work that needs to be done include:

 * Convert this to RST format.
 * Get a reviewer who knows Sage and is fluent in Catalan.

I would change "comandaments" and "comandes" to "ordres", which is what Termcat proposes.

Also, I think that in Python one writes


```
if 3 == 5-2:
    ...
```


instead of


```
if(3 == 5-2):
    ...
```


Both constructions do the same, it's just a matter of style. Similarly, spacing is supposed to increase legibility, so one uses:

```
x = 3
```


instead of

```
x=3
```

Yes, there are minor style issues with regard to spacing. See PEP8; arithmetic operators, assignments, and comparisons should all be spaced.

We converted the file to ReST format. To review: the files *index.rst* and *conf.py* should be put inside *SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/ca/tutorial/* (ca/tutorial should be created as well). One then compiles with:


```
sage --docbuild ca/tutorial html
```

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

Comment by xguitart created at 2013-02-05 17:08:22

It seems OK to me. 

I just noticed a few typos:

- "mentres que" --> "mentre que"
- "l'inversa" --> "la inversa"
- "Així mateix,:" --> "Així mateix:"
- "col.leccions" --> "col·leccions"
- "multiplicative_order(x)" --> "multiplicative_order(n)", and similarly for additive_order

Just fixed the typos. I will keep the ticket status as "positive review", and hopefully we get this in the distribution soon...

These files need to be put into a proper Mercurial patch, see [http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#modifying-sage-source-code](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#modifying-sage-source-code)

I have just added the patch. All the doctests pass, and it has been reviewed for language correctness (by Xavier Guitart). Someone should review the correctness of the patch, but there is no need for that reviewer to be able to read catalan...

I tried the patch.

When building the htmls, I got the folllowing warnings.


```

When building the pdfs, I got the following exception.

I fixed the errors, thanks for testing!

Applied the patch and the html build's with no warnings on Mountain Lion with a freshly built 5.8. The pdf build with a few hyperref errors. 

The biggest problem that I see is that there sage code blocks that aren't getting recognized by sphinx sprinkled throughout the output. For example, 


```
La i-èssima entrada d’una seqüència (o d’un conjunt) C és C[i]. Però compte perquè Sage enumera les posicions des de 0!:

::
    sage: S[1] = 1000 sage: S [121, 1000, 25, 9, 9, 25, 49, 121] sage: S[3] 9 
```


It's been awhile since I worked with sphinx but I believe that the problem is not leaving a space after :: in the rst source.

Only need to apply this patch


---

Comment by mmasdeu created at 2013-04-25 22:31:56

I am sorry, I seen this problem and fixed about a week ago, and then forgot to make and upload the corresponding patch! Also, this includes a fix for a piece of code that wasn't working.

Please can you take a look now? All should be fine. Sorry again...

Patch to fix the spaces. Can be applied after the main patch.

Builds fine but there were still a few un-formatted code blocks on my system. I have attached a patch that fixes the problem on my system.

Changing keywords from "" to "tutorial catalan".

Comment by kcrisman created at 2014-11-13 14:56:22

Hey Frédéric, did it seem to you that there were any remaining _language_ or _math_ issues here?  Otherwise we could presumably make sure the output doesn't look horrendous and give a thumbs up.  Thoughts?

About language issues, I do not know. "Je parle seulement francais, pas catalan."

The doc builds, the tests pass. The doc looks good enough. I think this can go. Do you confirm ?

Ich habe auch dieses Problem.

~~I just feel uncomfortable without _someone_~~Oh, we have the above:
> All the doctests pass, and it has been reviewed for language correctness (by Xavier Guitart).
I guess your changes are minor but probably someone should double-check them so Volker doesn't have to worry about it - one moment.

Comment by kcrisman created at 2014-11-14 16:52:34

Actually, I found a few very minor things you may have missed.

* This will be machine-dependent, as it involves dictionaries.

```
sage -t src/doc/ca/tutorial/index.rst
**********************************************************************
File "src/doc/ca/tutorial/index.rst", line 494, in doc.ca.tutorial.index
Failed example:
    solutions = solve([sqrt(x) + sqrt(y) == 5, x + y == 10], x, y,solution_dict = True); solutions
Expected:
    [{x: -5/2*I*sqrt(5) + 5, y: 5/2*I*sqrt(5) + 5}, {x: 5/2*I*sqrt(5) + 5, y: -5/2*I*sqrt(5) + 5}]
Got:
    [{y: 5/2*I*sqrt(5) + 5, x: -5/2*I*sqrt(5) + 5},
     {y: -5/2*I*sqrt(5) + 5, x: 5/2*I*sqrt(5) + 5}]
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
```

  Since the solutions are then printed out nicely, I think the easiest fix is just to confirm the solutions are, in fact, dicts.
* There were two extra `skip`s that escaped because of a misplaced double colon.
* pdf doc didn't build due to something perhaps intentional, but which is a character that html recognizes but pdf/latex didn't.  Based on [this Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#Catalan), I am going to use a period, since `\textperiodcentered` wouldn't look to great in html :-)
* Finally, since in several other localizations (Spanish, Russian, French) the `tutorial` files are the translations of the original tutorial, I think we should rename this - maybe `introduction` or something.  I'm going to do that as well.

Then all that will need review ... sorry.

Okay, still needs review, now of _my_ changes.  I'm pretty happy with it, though.

ok, looks good enough.
