Please fix the syntax to fit with Sage standards:

1. You should have a look at the developer manual for documentation strings

    http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings

   For example you need to write `EXAMPLES` instead of `Examples`.
   There should be line breaks before and after `EXAMPLES`, etc.

2. For Python syntax, have a look at

    https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

    For example there should be spaces before and after each assignment.

3. Revise the description of the function. You can have a look at the developer manual again and look at other files in the Sage sources.

As an example

```
def allmultizeta(N,n,D):
	r''' the program computing first N-1 multiple zeta values:
    Example::
    sage: allmultizeta(10,170,100)
```

Should be changed to

```
def allmultizeta(N, n, D):
    r"""
    Return the first N-1 multiple zeta values.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: allmultizeta(10, 170, 100)
```




Minor detail: in the "Authors" field of the ticket you need to put your full name.

PARI indeed implements Akilesh algorithms. In the last master branch there is also some alternatives that are faster for some specific signatures. The only disadvantage I see with PARI is that the result is a floating point number and not a ball/interval with guarantees on the result. However, the implementation is very careful to provide an accurate floating point number.
