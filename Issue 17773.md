Keywords: multiple zeta values, sage days 64

This program computes multiple zeta values for any given precision (composition input) and also it helps to compute the 
relation between multiple zeta values (composition input) 
Example::
sage: mzeta([2,1])

Please fix the syntax to fit with Sage standards:

1. You should have a look at the developer manual for documentation strings

    http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings

  For example you need to write `EXAMPLES` instead of `Examples`.
  There should be line breaks before and after `EXAMPLES`, etc.

2. For Python syntax, have a look at

    https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

    For example there should be spaces before and after each assignment.

3. Revise the description of the function. You can have a look at the developer manual again and look at other files in the Sage sources.

As an example

```
def allmultizeta(N,n,D):
	r''' the program computing first N-1 multiple zeta values:
    Example::
    sage: allmultizeta(10,170,100)
```

Should be changed to

```
def allmultizeta(N, n, D):
    r"""
    Return the first N-1 multiple zeta values.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: allmultizeta(10, 170, 100)
```




Minor detail: in the "Authors" field of the ticket you need to put your full name.

BTW, how does your code compares with the `zetamult` function available in PARI/GP

```
? zetamult([2, 1])
%1 = 1.2020569031595942853997381615114499908
```

Indeed, in the source code of PARI/GP (file `basemath/zetamult.c`) one can read

```
ALGORITHM DUE TO P. AKHILESH. DO NOT REPRODUCE UNTIL PUBLISHED
```

You might want to coordinate with K. Belabas and/or B. Allombert on the PARI/GP mailing lists: http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/lists-index.html

How does it compare to the implementation in PARI/GP available through cypari2 (see [comment:9], [comment:10])?

Given that pari has multizetas, and that we have an interface to them, this ticket may be closed as invalid.

Vincent, do you agree ?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2020-08-27 16:32:26

shall we close as duplicate ?


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2020-08-28 04:28:47

Before we close it as a duplicate, it would be good to do some comparison timings IMO as Vincent suggested in comment:12. Or does the PARI version use the same algorithm?

Replying to [comment:16 tscrim]:

PARI indeed implements Akilesh algorithms. In the last master branch there is also some alternatives that are faster for some specific signatures. The only disadvantage I see with PARI is that the result is a floating point number and not a ball/interval with guarantees on the result. However, the implementation is very careful to provide an accurate floating point number.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

Comment by tscrim created at 2020-08-28 10:24:54

Then I would say we should close this as a duplicate.

thanx, closing now
