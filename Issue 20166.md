We use breadth-first-search via `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` to iterate through the elements of a finitely generated semigroup. This will allow us to deprecate `TransitiveIdeal*`

I want to do the deprecation on a separate ticket because only this part is needed for #17039.

There is another failure on 32-bit that seems to come from this ticket: http://build.sagedev.org/release/builders/%20%20slow%20AIMS%20%20%28Debian%207%2032%20bit%29%20incremental/builds/479/steps/shell_4/logs/stdio

My own doctesting earlier this afternoon, complained about a tab in `backtrack.py` as well.

The tab character should be fixed in 6272efd.

I am actually surprised the breadth first search is so consistent. It is somewhat non-deterministic because it uses a set for the next level, whereas it probably should be a list. However, that is an issue for another ticket because it will require much more large-scale changes.
