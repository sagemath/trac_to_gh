Error configuring MPIR (with CFLAGS unset).
```


This test already failed with Clang (cf. #13948); now that GCC (5.x) defaults to STDC inlining (as opposed to GNUC inlining) semantics, we have to adapt the test (which is supposed to detect an unrelated bug in older GCC versions) again.

Thought of that, too (already when we were fixing the test for `clang`), but this way it's more explicit, and more importantly doesn't change the test at all for older compilers.

After all, upstream will decide...

Since this is purely about a package not compiling, there is not even a need to bump the patchlevel:
- if a user already managed to compile `mpir`, there is no need for this fix.
- if a user did not manage to compile `mpir`, the version number doesn't matter anyway.

I don't like the test either; I'd simply require some minimal version of GCC.

But as I said, it's IMHO up to upstream to clean up / decide on the tests...




> but I can accept it.

Thanks.  We can discuss again when finally a new upstream release gets out... ;-)

I just don't want to have a Sage 6.7 that cannot even bootstrap Sage's GCC 4.9.2 with GCC 5.x for no real reason; distros with GCC 5.1 will presumably pop up soon.
