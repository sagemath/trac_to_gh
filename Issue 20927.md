- Simplify code in `__repr__` and allow customization.

- Minor improvement of documentation

- A couple of smaller bug fixes (correcting/updating the parameter stop when using slices)

- Various smaller code improvements and simplifications.

When creating a customized class (inherited from lazy_list) in my projects, then update_cache_up_to is what I override (as I have some other way of getting new values). AFAICS this makes troubles as my code is in pure Python and not Cython, so I need an interface.

- The function `update_cache_up_to` was not intended to be a public method. That is, you might want to override it but I do not see the point in actually using it directly. Is there a use case for calling it? Otherwise it might better be `_update_cache_up_to`.

- Why did you changed the following?

```
-        i = self.start + i*self.step
-        if self._fit(i):
+        cdef Py_ssize_t n = self.start + i*self.step
+        if self._fit(n):
```

  If that's just a matter of personal opinion about writing code, then do not change it.

- I do not like the copy in

```
+    elif isinstance(data, lazy_list_generic):
+        l = lazy_list_generic()
+        l.master = data
+        l.cache = data._get_cache_()
```

  why not

```
elif isinstance(data, lazy_list_generic):
    return data
```

  This is the behavior for tuples

```
sage: t = (1,2)
sage: tuple(t) is t
True
```

  And I like this behavior since if you have an attribute `_data` in your object that is supposed to be a lazy list then you just have to do `my_object._data = lazy_list(data)` instead of first checking whether it is already a lazy list with `isinstance`.

Initially I thought it improves the readability of the code (which is one of Python's goals). However, looking at the code again, I do not have a strong preference for the original or the changed code. Thus I've reverted this change.

Some more remarks

- In the module documentation, it is written

```
You can also create extension type inheriting from :class:`lazy_list_generic`
```

  but with your modifications, Python class can also inherit from `lazy_list_generic`. It should be updated.

- This example is misleading

```
+    Lazy lists created from each other share their cache::
+
+        sage: C = lazy_list(count())
+        sage: C[4]
+        4
+        sage: D = lazy_list(C)
+        sage: ...
```

  you would better say that the lazy list are unmodified and test something like

```
    sage: C is D
    True
```


- The following change makes things slower

```
-        cdef lazy_list_from_iterator l = lazy_list_from_iterator.__new__(lazy_list_from_iterator)
-        l.cache = self[:]
-        l.start = 0
-        l.stop = PY_SSIZE_T_MAX
-        l.step = 1
-        l.iterator = iter(other)
-        return l
+        return lazy_list_from_iterator(iter(other), cache=self[:])
```

  With your branch

```
sage: ll = lazy_list(count())
sage: l = [0,1,2]
sage: %timeit l + ll
1000000 loops, best of 3: 456 ns per loop
```

  versus on develop

```
sage: %timeit l + ll
1000000 loops, best of 3: 189 ns per loop
```

  (the main reason is that the call to the constructor `__init__` is avoided in the previous version)

- In `str` would be nice to explain what the argument are actually used for... `- ``name`` -- (default: ``'lazy list'``) a string` is pretty cryptic. Though it is quite clear within the example.

Done.

Indeed it is.

Example rewritten.

I wasn't aware of this at all. If so, I wouldn't have changed it. Reverted.
