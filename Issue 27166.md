Non-incremental sage builds apparently depend on the system sphinx-build, if any:

Indeed, `pplpy` depends on sphinx (for building the documentation) and this is not specified in `build/pkgs/pplpy/dependencies`.

Should we consider buildbots trying to build each individual package against its minimal set of dependencies?

Changing status from new to needs_review.

(I tested building `pplpy` from scratch: `make base && make pplpy` and it succeeded)

I get this problem, but also even with this branch, another problem:

```
    ppl/linear_algebra.cpp:8:17: warning: '/*' within block comment [-Wcomment]
                "ppl/*",
                    ^
    ppl/linear_algebra.cpp:641:10: fatal error: 'ppl.hh' file not found
    #include "ppl.hh"
             ^~~~~~~~
    1 warning and 1 error generated.
    error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
```

Should `ppl` be a dependency? It is listed as a requirement at the [pplpy gitlab page](https://gitlab.com/videlec/pplpy).

It should. As I have ppl installed on my system I did not noticed it... (hence my comment [comment:2]).
