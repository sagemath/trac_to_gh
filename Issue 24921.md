Keywords: cmake

If `cmake` is already installed (system wide) and is a dependencie of another sage package `cmake` sage package shouldn't be installed.

The desired behaviour is sort of similar to `gcc`, `yasm` or `curl`, except `cmake` is an optional package.

This ticket is following the ticket #25109 discussion.
