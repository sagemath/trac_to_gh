# Issue 13814: sage-location problem with symlinks

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14018

Original creator: cnassau

Original creation time: 2013-01-26 14:14:25

Assignee: tdb

CC:  jdemeyer

Keywords: relocation, symbolic link

With my setup I get this pretty often:

```
The Sage installation tree has moved
from /waste/cn/sage-5.6
  to //waste/cn/sage-5.6
Updating various hardcoded paths...
```

Source of the confusion appears to be an extra symbolic link `/jehova -> /` (that I need if I want to follow the link through an nfs share):

```
cn@jehova:/waste/cn> ll -d sage*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cn users   25 Jan 26 13:19 sage -> /jehova/waste/cn/sage-5.6
drwxr-xr-x 8 cn users 4096 Jan 26 14:45 sage-5.6
cn@jehova:/waste/cn> ll -d /jehova
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 1 Jan 10  2009 /jehova -> /
```

The attached patch uses `os.path.samefile` for path comparison and fixes this.

Not sure whether that's the right place to fix it (i.e., whether we shouldn't instead avoid the `//` in the first place).

It seems that `bash` treats `//` different from `/`:

```
jdemeyer@sage:/$ cd //
jdemeyer@sage://$ pwd
//
```


So it seems to be a feature rather than a bug.  It only happens for the root though:

```
jdemeyer@sage:/$ cd /usr//bin
jdemeyer@sage:/usr/bin$ pwd
/usr/bin
```

Indeed, a google search reveals [from  http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Nov/141 ]

  The following quote is from IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004 Edition:

    A pathname consisting of a single slash shall resolve to the root
    directory of the process. A null pathname shall not be successfully
    resolved. A pathname that begins with two successive slashes may be
    interpreted in an implementation-defined manner, although more than
    two leading slashes shall be treated as a single slash.

  http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/basedefs/xbd_chap04.html#tag_04_11

I think this means that processes **can** choose to interpret "`//whatever`" in some special, unforeseeable way. But this doesn't happen on my system where "`os.path.samefile(...)`" correctly verifies the identity between the two locations. So I think my patch is doing the right thing here.

Well, I meant `/jehova` shouldn't be "resolved" to `//`.  The problem with `sage-location` is just a consequence of doing so.

Jehova!  Jehova!

But `/jehova` **does** resolve to `/`, not `//`. 
It seems `pwd` is to blame here:

```
cn@jehova:/waste/cn/sage> pwd
/waste/cn/sage
cn@jehova:/waste/cn/sage> pwd -L
/waste/cn/sage
cn@jehova:/waste/cn/sage> pwd -P
//waste/cn/sage-5.6
```

But maybe this is `HIS` way to let me know, that `HE` doesn't want to point to '/', either...

I wonder why `./sage` uses the `-P` variant:

```
# Make SAGE_ROOT absolute
SAGE_ROOT=`cd "$SAGE_ROOT" && pwd -P`
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo >&2 "$0: cannot determine SAGE_ROOT directory"
    exit 1
fi
```

Probably this is normalizing the path somehow, which is probably a good thing and shouldn't be changed.

The real question is if there is a problem with using 'os.path.samefile' in 'sage-location'. According to the python docs that function only works under unix but that probably covers all Sage supported platforms for the foreseeable future, doesn't it?

How did you get into this directory, i.e. which "cd" command did you use?

I'm just using a plain 'cd'

```
cn@jehova:/waste/cn/sage> cd /waste/cn/sage
cn@jehova:/waste/cn/sage> pwd 
/waste/cn/sage
cn@jehova:/waste/cn/sage> pwd -P
//waste/cn/sage-5.6
```

Seems reasonable to me to ignore symlinks when deciding whether we need to relocate. I do not know what is the current state of relocating though so I can not really put this to positive review.

Thanks for looking into this. But since nobody found this problem pressing or interesting for the past three years I suggest to just close this ticket as "wontfix".
