This ticket adds a simple way to compute sums of products of real or complex balls from Python with reduced overhead. For example:

```
sage: Pol.<x> = RBF[]
sage: foo = list((1 + x/3)^10)
sage: %timeit RBF._sum_of_products((c,c,c) for c in foo)
100000 loops, best of 3: 7.67 µs per loop
sage: %timeit sum(c*c*c for c in foo)
The slowest run took 6.92 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 14.9 µs per loop
```

(The new methods are _private for now, because we may want to change the interface later, especially if we generalize it to other parents.)
