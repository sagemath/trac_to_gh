The reduction of doctest coverage is due to the replacement of lambdas by sub functions.

Out of curiosity, why is this an improvement (in style)?

```diff
-cimport cython
 from memory_allocator cimport MemoryAllocator
 from sage.sets.disjoint_set cimport DisjointSet_of_hashables
 from sage.misc.decorators import rename_keyword
+cimport cython
```

I am not against this change, but why replace lambdas by sub functions? I ask because in the instances here, lambdas do not look ugly.

These are 
- `E402 module level import not at top of file` (https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#imports). I think here the `cimport python` statement is not well understood by the `pycodestyle` checker. This change does not brake the code and make the checker happy.
- `E731 do not assign a lambda expression, use a def`. The primary reason for this is debugging. Lambdas show as <lambda> in tracebacks, where functions will display the functionâ€™s name. https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations

So the checker didn't understand the cython import statement `cimport`, and suggested a fix without understanding. In this case, I think it is more important to satisfy human beings than the ignorant checker. More basic imports are usually placed in front. In this case, `cimport cython` is more basic. I suggest to revert this change.
