# Issue 19078: Clean imports related to coding theory

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19315

For now, a lot of modules are imported from `sage.coding` when Sage starts.
These modules can be lazy imported instead for better performances.

In `all.py` there's also several deprecated imports related to a 2-year old ticket.
These deprecation warnings can be removed too.

I removed deprecation warnings in `all.py`, passed everything in lazy imports and fixed a few doctests that broke in the operation.

As putting `self_dual_codes_binary` in a lazy import seemed to mess up with the garbage collector doctests in `categories/homset.py` and `structure/coerce.pyx` I changed it for a hard import instead.

Salut David,

1. The function `cyclotomic_cosets` was deprecated in #16464 which is also more than one year old. Could you remove the function and the import as well?

2. Do you really want to keep `codesize_upper_bound`, `dimension_upper_bound`, etc in the global namespace?

Vincent

Hello Vincent,

Sure, I'll do that.

>Do you really want to keep `codesize_upper_bound`, `dimension_upper_bound`, etc in the global namespace? 

Not really. I can put them in a catalog so one could access them typing `sage.codes.bounds` or something like that. It would be better. But if I do that, I guess I need to put a new deprecation warning over these bounds, isn't it?

Can you please also remove the ugly backslashes, they are not needed inside `(...)` or `[...]`.

I removed `cyclotomic_cosets`method, add a new catalog for bounds so they won't be available in the global namespace... When the new deprecation warning I added will be deleted in a year. I fixed the doctests that went down in the process.

I also removed the backslashes.

I haven't actually reviewed, I just looked a diff and saw too many backslashes hurting my eyes :-)
