# Issue 16235: get rid of PermutationsNK

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2014-06-11 17:36:56

CC:  sage-combinat â€‹tscrim nthiery hivert

The class `PermutationsNK` in `sage.combinat.permutation_nk` was only used for its iterative property. The latter can be replaced from the `permutations` in the `itertools` Python module.

Hey Vincent, I've added a note about `itertools.permutations`. If you okay with this change, then positive review.

Yes. Makes sense!

Thanks

Hi Travis,

At least it works! I basically reproduced what I did a long time ago in `sage.combinat.alphabet`.

Here's a less hacky way (IMO) to handle the unpickling (it's something that was done for partitions). Pick whichever one you think is best and you can set this to positive review.

Hey Travis,

Your version is definitely better. Thanks. But I got

```
sage -t --long combinat/permutation.py
**********************************************************************
File "combinat/permutation.py", line 7458, in sage.combinat.permutation.PermutationsNK.__setstate__
Failed example:
...
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
```

It is because of a backslash that escaped a `"`. I put a commit for this and now everything is fine so I set to positive review.

Thanks for your help.

Vincent

That what I get for testing it in the command line `:P`. Thanks for catching that.
