Hey Travis,

Your version is definitely better. Thanks. But I got

```
sage -t --long combinat/permutation.py
**********************************************************************
File "combinat/permutation.py", line 7458, in sage.combinat.permutation.PermutationsNK.__setstate__
Failed example:

It is because of a backslash that escaped a `"`. I put a commit for this and now everything is fine so I set to positive review.

Thanks for your help.
