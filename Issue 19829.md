this should not happen:


```
sage: asymptotic_expansions.Binomial_kn_over_n('n', 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'NoneType' and 'int'
```


and


```
sage: asymptotic_expansions.Stirling('n')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: precision must be at least 3
```

For the Stirling generator, I couldn't get something along the lines of

```
if precision is not None and precision < 3:
    raise ...
```

to work: while it works in Sage on the console, the doctest-framework wasn't happy with my tests. Suggestions are welcome.

I've mistakenly started this from `asy/trunk`, this has to be rebased to something else.

Seems like this was open for a while. :-)

Threw away the old branch and redid this in a clean way. Should be rather easy to review.
