# Issue 22100: maxima not shutting down nicely in pexpect interface on Cygwin

This is a ticket to further track the issue I described here: 

https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/y79rSTdBLQA/LnkO66FCAwAJ

In short, after the master pty is closed when quitting the pexpect interface, ecl has inconsistent error handling on failed reads/writes to stdio.  On Cygwin this actually leads to a busy wait loop that, while possible to terminate, takes a long time due to the use in Sage of `terminate_async`, and the slowness of `fork()` on Cygwin.

This is particularly a problem when running the test suite, where lots of maxima pexpect interfaces are being started and stopped in rapid succession.  This leads to a snowball effect of processes that take forever to exit and eat up the CPU.

I'm looking into a patch for ecl to fix the problem on its end.  In the meantime it should be possible to work around this directly in Sage as well, even if only with a Cygwin-specific workaround.

Upstream bug in ECL is fixed.

Next question is should we port the patch or just wait until the next ECL version comes out? Considering ECL releases approximately once a year, I would say port it.

Practically speaking that would be simple enough and probably worth doing anyways.  But I'm trying to move away from reliance on patching packages in Sage so that it will be easier, in the future, to rely on system packages.  I'd rather implement a workaround that doesn't require a patched ecl to work.

Pardon my ignorance, but I don't see how using a system ECL would help things. We would need the patched ECL, so the only other option I see (which is not very far granted) would be taking a dev-cut of ECL. Do you have something in the works for this or do you want me to port the patch?

If the patch is accepted upstream, I think that's fine. It just means that we wouldn't be able to use the system ECL right now, but only later.

My point is that I'd rather not promote the habit of relying on patches (accepted upstream or otherwise) to solve problems where it isn't necessary.  I need a fix to this now for running the tests on Cygwin, and I can probably provide a workaround. I just haven't done it yet since I'm focusing on other things at the moment.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

For now I'll go ahead and add the patch to ECL.  As Jeroen says, for now there's no way to configure to use the system ECL anyways.  If/when this becomes an issue for a real user I will revisit.

Since it is accepted upstream, positive review.

Patches don't apply? Did anybody try to build the branch?

```
[ecl-16.1.2.p3] Error applying '../patches/flisten-bug.patch'
```

It worked for me, at least at one point.  The only difference here seems to be some whitespace.  Confirmed that this still works....

Okay, this version of the patch applies but breaks the build actually so nevermind...

Well, now I'm getting an unrelated error building ECL that I've never had before.

Found a workaround for the unrelated build issue and confirmed that this definitely works now.
