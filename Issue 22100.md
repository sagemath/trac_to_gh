This is a ticket to further track the issue I described here: 

https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/y79rSTdBLQA/LnkO66FCAwAJ

In short, after the master pty is closed when quitting the pexpect interface, ecl has inconsistent error handling on failed reads/writes to stdio.  On Cygwin this actually leads to a busy wait loop that, while possible to terminate, takes a long time due to the use in Sage of `terminate_async`, and the slowness of `fork()` on Cygwin.

This is particularly a problem when running the test suite, where lots of maxima pexpect interfaces are being started and stopped in rapid succession.  This leads to a snowball effect of processes that take forever to exit and eat up the CPU.

I'm looking into a patch for ecl to fix the problem on its end.  In the meantime it should be possible to work around this directly in Sage as well, even if only with a Cygwin-specific workaround.

Next question is should we port the patch or just wait until the next ECL version comes out? Considering ECL releases approximately once a year, I would say port it.

Practically speaking that would be simple enough and probably worth doing anyways.

I'd rather implement a workaround that doesn't require a patched ecl to work.
