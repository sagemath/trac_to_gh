This is dangerous as a module does not have to implement a `one_basis()` (in fact, some of them do not because it is not an element of the basis). I agree with the principle of this change, but you should pull out getting the `self.parent().one_basis()` outside of the loops and into a `try`-`except AttributeError:` block. I would set the stored `one_basis` variable you'll need to `None` for the exception branch.

The same change should be done in `_unicode_art_` as well.

Sounds good. Is there any examples of modules that don’t implement .one_basis that come to mind? I want to make sure I can add an example in the doctest where the fix I had breaks.

I think one of the bases for the `DescentAlgebra` doesn’t have a `one_basis()` since `one()` is a sum of basis elements. There is also a basis of one of the combinatorial Hopf algebras called the orbit basis that also has this IIRC.
