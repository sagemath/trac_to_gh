In #20086, 

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: (x**2)**(1/2)
x
sage: R(1)**(1/2)
1
```

was implemented.

However, this does not work in multivariate polynomial rings:

```
sage: R.<x, y> = ZZ[]
sage: (x**2)**(1/2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: non-integral exponents not supported
sage: R(1)**(1/2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: non-integral exponents not supported
```

#20666 is the general case (non-uniform behavior of powers for polynomials); this ticket shall handle the multivariate case.

I suggest three changes:

1. You could avoid importing `QQ` and use `Rational` instead (as `Integer` is used rather than `ZZ`).
2. Instead of using `QQ.coerce(exp)`, I would use `QQ(exp)` as it is done for integer exponents. It allows to use `p^.5` instead of `p^(1/2)`. 
3. You may catch the `TypeError` for rational exponents to raise more meaningful exception when the method is applied with some non-rational (nor integral) exponent.

Thank you for your comments; I am sorry for not reacting in a timely manner.

Anyhow, all three changes have been carried out.
