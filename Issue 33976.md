Under what circumstances will it matter whether `SAGE_LOCAL` is set or unset?

The function `var` in `sage.env` first takes the value of the environment variable. Only if it is unset, the value is taken from `sage_conf` or the fallback value.

At the time of installation, `sage_setup.setenv` manipulates `CPATH`, `LIBRARY_PATH` etc. based on the value of `SAGE_LOCAL`. This mechanism is not actually needed for installation within the Sage distribution because we have already set all of these environment variables in `sage-build-env`.

The `ld: warning: directory not found ... /doesnotexist/lib` are not really a problem, but I have marked the ticket as critical because these messages have the potential to confuse users.

(However, the Cygwin rebasing really was broken by #29779 and is also restored here.)

Sorry, I don't understand. Before #29779, we didn't touch `SAGE_LOCAL`. We have three options:

- `unset SAGE_LOCAL`
- do nothing — the status quo before #29779, I think
- poison `SAGE_LOCAL — causes all of the warning messages

The old comment (deleted in #29779) about not poisoning `SAGE_LOCAL` was deemed no longer valid, although I don't know why. Anyway, I'm happy to avoid poisoning that variable, but is the point here that we want to avoid problems if the user has somehow set `SAGE_LOCAL`? Otherwise, how does unsetting compare to just doing nothing?

Doing nothing with `SAGE_LOCAL`, i.e., keeping it at the value set by the build environment (`sage-env` + `sage-build-env`) would also work.

+unset SAGE_PKG_CONFIG_PATH

please remove the first one like you did with `SAGE_LOCAL`.
