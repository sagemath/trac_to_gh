# Issue 17074: polynomial_real_mpfr_dense.call() accepts only 1 arg

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17311

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2014-11-10 09:56:24

Keywords: real, mpfr, substitution

burcin mentions in comment 2 of #9769:

The `__call__()` function of RR[x] doesn't conform to the generic definition. You should be able to give the parameters as a keyword argument as well. This should be made to work:


```
sage: R.<x> = RR[]
sage: (x^2+1)(x=5)
26.0000000000000
```
