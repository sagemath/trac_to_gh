For many spkgs, the `build/pkgs/SPKG/spkg-build` and `spkg-install` script templates set environment variables before invoking `make`.

This ticket allows to move environment variable settings common between these scripts to a `build/pkgs/SPKG/spkg-env` file, which will be included by `build/bin/sage-spkg` at the top of the generated executable scripts (also named `spkg-build` and `spkg-install`).

Moreover, this ticket adds a command
`sage --buildsh SPKG`
which sources that file in addition to `src/bin/sage-env`.
This makes it easier to test new versions of packages.
