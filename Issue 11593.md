Keywords: pkgconfig .pc sage-env

Currently, `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` is only **set** to Sage's `pkg-config` directory (`$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/pkgconfig/`) if it is empty (or not set at all).

The patch now also prepends Sage's directory otherwise, such that Sage's `.pc` files will be picked up first.

The previous behaviour could obviously break the build if `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` was already set in the "global" environment, i.e. outside the Sage environment.

Perhaps an explanation, which was pointed out to me by François, is in order as to why the patch is needed here. I had previously built sage-4.7.2.rc0 on a gentoo system without a problem. However, the build process broke when done from within a gentoo prefix. On gentoo PKG_CONFIG_PATH is not defined, by default, and thus there was no problem. But from within gentoo prefix PKG_CONFIG_PATH is defined. Thus the patch is needed there to prepend to PKG_CONFIG_PATH the sage paths so the correct .pc files can be found.

PKG_CONFIG_PATH is not defined on Gentoo full stop. Prefix or regular. So this may break sage in subtle ways. R-2.10.1 as shipped in sage may break in the build stage because it is not compatible with png-1.5.

I will elevate this to blocker and rebase it ASAP. Jeroen can decide whether it should be shipped in 4.7.2.

Well, there's no fuzz, just a few lines offset, so you don't have to rebase the patch.
