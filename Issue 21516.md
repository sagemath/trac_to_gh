# Issue 21516: Minimize cimports from flint

In `.pxd` files, it is better to `cimport` minimally to avoid introducing spurious dependencies. Some extensions are forced to compile against `flint` but don't actually use FLINT.

Want a list for that?

No, I'm using a simple `grep`. But you can review it using that list :-)

so it is right that nothing `sage/modular/pollack_stevens/` is there. The rest seems to be moving declaration around and make them more defined. I will do a build of that.
