Can I help? Unfortunately, I don't know much about Pynac and it's interface in Sage.

I have no clue about pynac. It would be nice to have this future in Sage, especially in view of #31894. Can anyone help?

I believe the pynac `quo_rem` method requires both arguments to be univariate polynomials, not general expressions. (A search of the pynac source code shows that its only use is in the method that calculates the partial fraction decomposition of a rational function of a single variable.) A `quo_rem` method is already available for polynomial rings (even multivariate ones), so would this pynac function actually be useful for anything? Or were you looking for something else?
