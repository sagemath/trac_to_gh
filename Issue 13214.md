I just added a patch, which avoids the loading of numpy during startup.

Unfortunately comparison with numpy types fail for all rings:



```
sage: import numpy
sage: QQ(1) == numpy.int32(1)
False
sage: QQbar(1) == numpy.int32(1)
False
sage: AA(1) == numpy.int32(1)
False
sage: RR(1) == numpy.int32(1)
False
sage: RDF(1) == numpy.int32(1)
False
sage: RIF(1) == numpy.int32(1)
False
```

sage: import numpy
sage: 123 == numpy.int32(123)
True
```
