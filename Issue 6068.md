Currently all worksheets have URLs that end in a number (e.g. https://99.240.209.8:8000/home/pub/12)
.  It would be nice to have the option to specify a piece of text to
end the URL (e.g. https://99.240.209.8:8000/home/pub/Cruise_Perf).

I don't know, but even if someone remembers something that sounds like we can leave this open.

Proposing to close all sagenb tickets as outdated, so that all remaining open tickets in the notebook component are about the Jupyter notebook.
