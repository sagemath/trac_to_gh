# Issue 15919: Support renaming of Functor (define _repr_(), not __repr__())

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16156

Original creator: pbruin

Original creation time: 2014-04-14 09:51:23

Keywords: repr renaming

The class `Functor` and some of its subclasses define a `__repr__()` method which doesn't support renaming:

```
sage: F=IdentityFunctor(Rings())
sage: F
The identity functor on Category of rings
sage: F.rename('I')
sage: F
The identity functor on Category of rings
```

This ticket moves these methods to `_repr_()` so the standard `SageObject.__repr__()` is used, which makes renaming work at least for Python classes.
