I think there should be a keyword ("transposition=False" oder  something) to indicate the matrix N is wanted. Also I am not completely  sure I did the deprecations right in any way.

I just changed some minor things into documentation : I removed any reference related to weak Popov form, because it does not compute the weak Popov form and I added a new reference related to the row reduced form. I also removed the name "weak Popov form" from the output field.
