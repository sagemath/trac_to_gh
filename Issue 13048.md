The attached patch fixes a bug when defining morphisms of chain complexes: the code was supposed to check that a product of two matrices was zero, but used

```
A * B.is_zero()
```

rather than

```
(A * B).is_zero()
```

As a result, some valid maps of chain complexes were flagged as invalid. The patch fixes this.
