# Issue 14133: implement shuffle algebras

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14337

Original creator: chapoton

Keywords: shuffle algebra

It would be nice to be able to compute in the shuffle algebra over an alphabet.

The underlying vector space is spanned by words, and the product is commutative, given the sum over all shuffles of words.

No way the patch is ready for review, it's not even written yet! It says right there in line 6 of the file that it will not be written until May :P

Hey Frederic,

I've uploaded a review patch which adds some doctests and makes some tweaks to the documentation. If you agree with my changes, go ahead and set this to positive review.

Thanks,

Travis
