Trying to create an asymptotic ring involving a monomial non-growth group fails with:

```
sage: AsymptoticRing('n^(RBF*I)', ZZ)
AttributeError: 'ImaginaryGroup_with_category' object has no attribute 'one'
```

The following change seems to be enough to make it work, but I am not sure at all if it is correct.

```
