IMHO 10% performance decrease is not too bad. As well, it's unclear whether it's limited to a particular compiler/OS/hardware combo, or not. One can also say that MPIR has added more assembly codes, and I guess one can as well find a combo that shows a performance boost.

I really cannot see this as the reason not to upgrade MPIR. Consider using ODK funds to get a new CPU where new MPIR shines :-)

Maybe we can accept a 10% performance regression, but certainly not without further investigation. The problem may be much worse than it appears to be on the surface.
