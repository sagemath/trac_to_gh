Ticket #3624 has a document called "Sage and Coding Theory" that fits nicely in the classification "Sage HOWTOs".

The original proposal can be found on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/95afb345e872f9af) and [sage-combinat-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/msg/662eb0246c7bf9fc).
