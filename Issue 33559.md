# Issue 33559: .git-blame-ignore-revs

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33796

We add a file `.git-blame-ignore-revs` for use with `git blame --ignore-rev`.

We automatically list all commits in this file that would be empty if *black* was run on a and b.

Proper config of black is needed first.

Just the excludes from `src/pyproject.toml`, right?

Other than that, for this ticket, the exact configuration would not matter; only that black obtains *some* normal form of the source.

Ah, you want to exclude commits a -> b satisfying black(a) = black(b), instead of ones that satisfy black(a) = b? For this the exact config of black is indeed not needed.

Yes.
