# Issue 24753: fix libgap on python3

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24990

Original creator: @dimpase

CC:  chapoton embray jdemeyer

cython (cdef) function `initialize()` fails in `src/sage/libs/gap/util.pyx` with `TypeError: expected bytes, str found`.

This can be traced to the lines

```
    from sage.interfaces.gap import _get_gap_memory_pool_size_MB
    memory_pool = _get_gap_memory_pool_size_MB()
    argv[3] = "-o"
    argv[4] = memory_pool
```

which get a string `memory_pool` from Python and try to assign it to `argv[4]` of C type `char*`. This is something that needs extra care on Python3, as `memory_pool` is of type `str`.

I believe this kind of thing has been fixed already in other places.

these are few changes that I was able to figure out so far.

I get past `initialization()`, and can do things like
`libgap.eval("blah")`, but get a segfault on `libgap(1)` (but not on `libgap("1")`).

It seems to happen at
`return libGAP_IS_FUNC(self.value)`, line 1024 of `sage/libs/gap/element.pyx`.

see also #24269 and its dependencies

Wrapping with bytes() is not the correct way to go ; one should rather use str_to_bytes or the converse bytes_to_str, see other py3 tickets.

And cython understands basestring, no need to import it from anywhere.

I already fixed all the issues with `sage.libs.gap`.  I'm pretty sure there's already a ticket for it but let me make sure...

Changing status from new to needs_review.


---

Comment by embray created at 2018-03-16 13:27:39

Yeah, it's here, but I need to rebase it: #24460

I propose to close this ticket as a duplicate if that's alright.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

Comment by @dimpase created at 2018-03-16 13:40:05

This is fine. I opened it cause I missed #24460 in my search (I looked for libgap :/) and I needed libgap to work to be able to properly do the work on #24984, 
which depends on libgap a lot.


---

Comment by embray created at 2018-03-16 13:54:54

Ah, I should put libgap in the keywords as well.

Resolution: duplicate
