I've made some reviewer changes, but you are currently inconsistent. If the user inputs something that is not a map, we raise a `ValueError`, but if the map has differing domain and codomains, then you return `False`. In both cases, the input is nonsensical, and I would argue (just like for `is_similar` for matrices) that the return should be `False` in both cases because they are not contiguous. Thoughts?

I don't have strong feelings about it, so I don't mind returning `False` in both cases. The original version was intentionally inconsistent: it may make sense to ask if any two simplicial maps are contiguous, but it doesn't make sense to ask if a map is contiguous to a matrix.

By the way, `is_similar` raises an error if you plug in a non-matrix, but it just returns `False` if you plug in a matrix of the wrong shape. So the original behavior was more like `is_similar` than the new version.
