I don't have strong feelings about it, so I don't mind returning `False` in both cases. The original version was intentionally inconsistent: it may make sense to ask if any two simplicial maps are contiguous, but it doesn't make sense to ask if a map is contiguous to a matrix.

By the way, `is_similar` raises an error if you plug in a non-matrix, but it just returns `False` if you plug in a matrix of the wrong shape. So the original behavior was more like `is_similar` than the new version.
