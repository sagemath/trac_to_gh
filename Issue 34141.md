# Issue 34141: Do not print R NULL value

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34378

Original creator: novoselt

Original creation time: 2022-08-16 22:11:07

As reported at
https://github.com/sagemath/sagecell/issues/565

we currently have

```
sage: r.eval('cat("Hello, world!\n")')
Hello, world!
'<rpy2.rinterface_lib.sexp.NULLType object at 0x7ff05713c680> [RTYPES.NILSXP]'
```

and similar situation occurs for other cases where the last R command returns NULL. In Python such return values are not shown explicitly and it would be nice to catch them for R as well.

dup of #27025?

That ticket has more issues than this one. And I imagine this one is easier to fix and agree upon "the right way".

Since we now use rpy2 rather than the custom thing we had a decade ago, that might be a little tougher.  (But really just catching it there is probably the "easy, if not "right", way.)  I remember `NULL` returns from various R commands for many years, so I don't think this is new.  Sorry I can't help.
