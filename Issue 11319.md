# Issue 11319: Minor doc formatting problem in tachyon_repr

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: beginner graphics format

In plot3d/base.pyx, there is a problem with a missing line or something, so that the html doc for `Graphics3D.tachyon_repr` looks bad. Should be very easy to fix.

Changing keywords from "beginner graphics format" to "beginner graphics format sd31".

I'm not sure how to test this...I can't seem to figure out how to build documentation for different branches of sage.

There is only one documentation.  You just do `./sage -docbuild reference html` with the new one and check that it's right.  End of fun :)

This looks fine, though you must have fixed a lot of other newlines. 

For some reason I can't get this to update the doc.  The patch is correct, but seems to not be working right in terms of getting Sage to "see" it.  I've had this problem other times with Sphinx, so I am tempted to give it positive review anyway.  Currently building pdf doc to see what happens.

The pdf doesn't look right either, even though I built that from scratch.  I really have no idea why this doesn't work, but 'needs work'.  

Can you make a _minimal_ patch, with just that new line?

updated patch.  Had to use a raw string (which should have been used in the first place).  If needed, I will make all the docstrings in base.pyx to be rawstrings.

I could not get it to update properly on my computer - Sphinx would not "see" that the file changed - but it looks fine on Ryan's computer, and the code _is_ correct.  Positive review.

I fixed some issues with my editor removing trailing spaces at the end of lines.  Prevented patch from #2100 from applying cleanly.

I think removing white space is probably a good thing, so let's keep the original patch.

So the patch in alpha4 is [attachment:trac_11491_tachyon_repr.patch], correct?  Just want to make sure, as it affects #2100.
