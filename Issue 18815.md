# Issue 18815: Change _N to _level in zero_sums.pyx

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19052

Original creator: gouezel

Original creation time: 2015-08-18 11:40:22

The file `zero_sums.pyx` uses a variable named `_N`. It imports `ctypes.h`, which also defines `_N` on some systems (including cygwin)... The patch renames `_N` to `_level` in `zero_sums.pyx`.

Salut SÃ©bastien,

A global definition interfers with an attribute of a class!? Cython should be able to compile the following

```
cdef n
cdef class A:
    cdef n
```

(and it does for me)

No, it is a preprocessor command `#define _N 04` in `ctypes.h`... Which, of course, breaks every appearance of `_N`...

But then variable/function names like `cache_NumberField` or `compute_Nash` would be broken!! There is something broken from either the NTL or Cygwin side...
