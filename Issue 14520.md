Keywords: permutation, reading word

The following doesn't work:

```
sage: T = Tableau([1,1]) 
...
ValueError: The permutation has length 2 but its maximal element is 1. Some element may be repeated, or an element is missing, but there is something wrong with its length.
```

The `deprecated_function_alias` does not work properly with the `combinatorial_map` decorator.
