Trac #9739 broke doctesting of .sage files (as in `sage -t my_file.sage`).  The attached patch fixes this.

The problem was that before #9739, doctesting `file.sage` produced two Python files: a preparsed version of `file.sage`, and a file with the doctesting framework and the doctests, but not the actual Python/Sage code -- it just included a line like `from file import *`.  In #9739, we missed this, and we just produced one Python file, the second one, so the original Python/Sage code is nowhere to be found, and thus not importable.

At the same time, this patch fixes a small bug in the function `delete_tmpfiles`: the function used to quit completely if it couldn't find some file in the list `tmpfiles`.  Now if if can't find the file, it skips it and goes on to the next one.

I'd give this a positive review, but for the fact that it won't apply on sage-5.0.beta8 (the problem being with `cmdline.py`).  But patching that file by hand, everything seems to work as it should.

> Is it okay to add to `cmdline.py` instead of creating a new file `doctest.py`?
It looks like the sensible place to me.
