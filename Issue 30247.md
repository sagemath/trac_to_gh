A basic how to setup VS code for sage (from #25206#comment:63):

- Start Visual Studio Code.
- Install "Remote-WSL" extension.
- Press F1, enter Remote-WSL: New Window, and hit enter.
- Use the File menu to open your folder.
- For running & debuging, follow â€‹https://code.visualstudio.com/remote-tutorials/wsl/edit-and-debug
- Use ./sage -br to trigger a rebuild of sage.

Should also add instructions for cygwin shell under VS code; random link - https://superuser.com/questions/1511487/cygwin-shell-in-vs-code-tries-to-activate-conda-how-to-prevent-this

I'd suggest `make build && ./sage` instead.

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

Hmm, I can't figure out how to use vscode with a Sage notebook.
The problem is to get vscode to find the correct kernel...

At least for a "normal" jupyter notebook, selecting the venv created by sage worked for me.

There is also the possibility to connect to a "remote" jupyter instance. https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_connect-to-a-remote-jupyter-server So if you start sage's jupyter server, you should be able to connect to it in this way.

The question is, how does vscode's jupyter discover kernels? Where?
What should be set?

In the upper right corner you can select the kernel/python version, see attached screenshot.

The link https://code.visualstudio.com/remote-tutorials/wsl/edit-and-debug does not seem to work.

Not sure if it has just moved or this is a different document: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl

Or maybe this one: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl-tutorial

it's rather unpredictable whether Sage jupyter kernel will be available.
Often it's just not there. Perhaps it needs to installed to a specific location.

The changes mostly look good to me, but I think the ticket originally had a broader scope than only the configuration for Jupiter notebooks.

Moreover, according to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette Ctrl + Shift + P is the default/recommended shortcut to open the command palette. Maybe rephrase this part as `In the command palette (Ctrl + Shift + P), choose "xyz"`?

On macOS, its Cmd + Shift + P. Perhaps also include the link to the VS Code documentation?

I am new to the Visual Studio Code interface to the sagemath installed in WSL.

I followed the guide of the branch of this ticket. It mostly worked.

But in the first attempt, I could not select [SageMath](SageMath) kernel in the jupyter notebook. It was simply missing.

I wandered around for some time, and then found Jupyter Extension in the Extensions panel. I installed it, and did the ":Create: New Jupyter Notebook" thing again. Then I could finally select [SageMath](SageMath) kernel. 

So it seems that there is a missing step in the guide: "Install Jupyter Extension"

Anyway, this VSCode interface to sage is very nice!

Still it was not straightforward for me to setup the working jupyter notebook with sagemath kernel starting from building sage from source in WSL.
