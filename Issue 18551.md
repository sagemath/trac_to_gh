CC:  @jdemeyer

Proposal: Make /build the root for the `sage_bootstrap` Python module
* /build/sage_bootstrap/...
* /build/bin/sage-package
* /build/setup.py
* /build/tox.ini

Keep the current package metadata at 
* /build/pkgs/...

Move the makefile stuff to
* /build/make/Makefile
* /build/make/deps
* /build/make/install
* /build/make/...

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18788

I don't think this commit should be on this ticket, but on a separate blocker ticket with just this one commit.

Also: don't you test building from scratch when closing a ticket?

Well we just saw that the current system can't do reliable incremental builds, I think that this is pretty bad. That was ok 20 years ago but today this is hardly state of the art.

For the record, I'm only doing incremental builds for each ticket on the buildbot. In addition, there is a weekly full build.

You can review both tickets at the same time if the location of `sage_bootstrap` irks you.

So the fact that one ticket changing the build system breaks it proves that it's not reliable?

What do you want, a build system that is impossible to break when changing it?
