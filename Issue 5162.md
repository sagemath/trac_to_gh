In atlas-3.8.2.p1 I accidentally did something dumb and broken some non-g95 code on Linux. The spkg at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.3/alpha4/atlas-3.8.2.p2.spkg

fixes that problem and also resolves the Solaris issue I intended to fix in atlas-3.8.2.p1.

Cheers,

Michael
