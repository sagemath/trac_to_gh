Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  gmoose05 egunawan vichitk1

Keywords: Q-systems

We implement Q-systems for Cartan types expressed in terms of

- fundamental monomials (i.e., using the variables `Q_1^(a)`, where `a` ranges over the index set), and
- square-free monomials.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18680

FYI (mostly for my own record keeping) - There's also a very prelimiary branch for T-systems on the branch `u/tscrim/t_systems`.

Currently this is almost ready, just needs some documentation and a few other doctests.
