# Issue 18443: Implement Q-systems

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2015-06-11 17:33:53

Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  gmoose05 egunawan vichitk1

Keywords: Q-systems

We implement Q-systems for Cartan types expressed in terms of

- fundamental monomials (i.e., using the variables `Q_1^(a)`, where `a` ranges over the index set), and
- square-free monomials.

FYI (mostly for my own record keeping) - There's also a very prelimiary branch for T-systems on the branch `u/tscrim/t_systems`.

Currently this is almost ready, just needs some documentation and a few other doctests.

Question: There are `QSystem.algebra_generators()` and `QSystem.gen(a, m)` - Do you want QSystem.gens() to work as well?

No because `gens()` should return a tuple and there are an infinite number of generators (tuples must be finite).

Changing keywords from "Q-systems" to "Q-systems, days78".

Actually, from looking over my code, I was generating it by Q<sup>(a)</sup><sub>1</sub>, which is a finite (and ordered) set. So I decided to change the method `gen` to `Q` as to not conflict with other parts of Sage and with the `algebra_generators()` method, although I'm not 100% sold that this should be the method name.

Is the following something that is automatically included in the doc because of `CombinatorialFreeModuleElement`

```
Create a combinatorial module element. This should never be called directly, but only through the parent combinatorial free moduleâ€™s __call__() method.
```

Did you want to add more lines in `__classcall__` where you wrote: `# TODO: Check for tamely laced!!!`?

Changing keywords from "Q-systems, days78" to "Q-systems, Q-system, days78, days82".

I added a check for tamely-laced, moved the references to the master ref file, and added a short docstring to take care of the autogenerated stuff that comes from inheritance (comment:15).

Do you want to keep that TODO note for yourself for after you implement T-systems?

Travis, Could you explain the small letters you use in ``_unicode_art_term()`` for my benefit?

I've only done minimal reviewing for this ticket. If people are OK with that, you can set this to positive review.

This line

```
.. [KNS2011] Atsuo Kuniba and Tomoki Nakanishi and Junji Suzuki,
             `T`*-systems and* `Y`*-systems in integrable systems*.
             J. Phys. A, **44** (2011), no. 10.
```

seems to cause the following error:

```

I fixed the documentations issue(s) and removed the comment since I don't plan on implementing T-systems in the near future. I also tweaked the unicode output slightly to make it more readable. In fact, those small upper/lower numbers are the super/subscript numbers for the unicode output. If these changes are good with you, then you can set a positive review.
