In the flint declaration file you are giving access to the precise structure of the C struct, namely

```
cdef extern from "flint/fmpz_poly.h":
    ctypedef struct fmpz_poly_struct:
        fmpz* coeffs
        long alloc
        long length
```

This not part of the public API of flint and would better be avoided in public Cython headers. Moreover, flint provides macros for accessing them. Please change to

```
cdef extern from "flint/fmpz_poly.h":
    ctypedef struct fmpz_poly_struct:
