# Issue 11457: Evaluating the order of an ideal class fails

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11629

Original creator: wuthrich

Original creation time: 2011-07-26 14:06:37

Assignee: davidloeffler

Keywords: class group

The following does not work


```
sage: K.<t> = NumberField(x^5-9*x^4+22*x-71)
sage: v = K.ideal(2, t^3 - 8*t^2 - 7*t - 3)
sage: c = K.class_group()(v)
sage: c.order()
```


giving a type-error. While it should give back 3.

As aconsequence, one can not do `c^4`.

The problem was sorted out in #11234, which was merged in sage-4.7.1.alpha0.   So I think this ticket can be closed as a duplicate.
