Basically, the idea of this ticket is that upload/download is confusing for some people -- maybe load/save would be clearer.  Also, he's definitely right that there should be an Open option in the File menu when one is looking at a worksheet.

I guess this is what Peter Doyle wanted but I'm not sure its exactly right.  "Open worksheet" to me makes me think I'm going to get a file dialog or something, not go to the worksheet list.  Maybe "Open worksheets" would be better?  But this does do basically what the request asks for.

I'm playing with this, and I'm not at all sure it is less confusing.  It feels more confusing to me.  Given that only one person ever complained about this, I say we do *not* make the change.  If there were more complaints than we should.

Timothy -- thanks for your work on this.  I'm sorry
