Thomas Fernique reported the following bug by private email: from the console, some flat polygons in three-space lead to an empty picture with jmol (java version), for example:


```
sage: polygon([(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 0, 1)])
```


However, this is correctly displayed with jsmol (javascript version) from the notebook.

I can reproduce this bug on Sage 6.8, Debian GNU/Linux jessie 64 bit, openjdk-7-jre.
