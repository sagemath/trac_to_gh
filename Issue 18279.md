Yep, that's the idea. Though you can avoid creating a copy of the graph by:
1) computing the canonical label on _hasse_diagram
2) "relabel the canonical label" using the correspondance between _hasse_diagram vertices and poset vertices
3) call relabel on the poset itself with the "relabelled" canonical label

Hello !

> Why those `# random` parts on doctests?

Because the doctests wrongly assume that the canonical label should never change. We had this problem with bliss: the canonical labels it returns are different from the ones returned by 'native' Sage.

A labelling is 'canonical' in the sense that two isomorphic object will be relabelled to the same object. This being said, nothing says that a canonical label never changes in time, and in particular the documentation of Nauty says explicitly that it will.

> And isn't `sorted` unneeded, as the order of 'a' and 'b' is always the same?

I am not sure. These letters will be stored on dictionaries, and you never know what happens with dictionaires on different architectures. Anyway I removed that, because of your next comment:

> Also you say that this issue is now corrected, but give an example with `relabel` function, not with `canonical_relabel`? 

My mistake. I added another commit at the same location.
