The basis `L = J.interreduced_basis()` in the following example is incorrect. In particular, the variety of the ideal `J` contains a point (x,y)=(2,0), which is missing in the variety of ideal of `L`. Also, the equality `R.ideal(L) == J` does not hold.


```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing( Integers(4) )
....: J = R.ideal( [x+2, 2*x, y] )
....: L = J.interreduced_basis()
....: print( L )
....: print( R.ideal(L) == J )
[2]
False
