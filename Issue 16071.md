To be more precise, IMHO both a and b should be < n<sup>1/2</sup> (for `two_squares()`).

I agree.  Given that 0 is a square, it makes complete sense to allow it as a term in a sum of squares.  That convention makes a lot of things nicer, for example:
- every square is also a sum of two squares, and more generally every sum of *k* squares is also a sum of *k* + 1 squares;
- *n* is a sum of 2 squares if and only if *n* can be factored non-trivially in **Z**[*i*];
- *n* is a sum of *k* squares if and only if the lattice **Z**<sup>*k*</sup> has a point of squared distance *n* from the origin.
There are also nice formulae for the number of ways to write *n* as a sum of *k* squares if you interpret this number as the number of points (*x*<sub>1</sub> , ... , *x*<sub>k</sub>) in **Z**<sup>*k*</sup> with *x*<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + ... + *x<sub>k</sub>*<sup>2</sup> = *n*.

`algorithm="gap"`?

We'd need that for backwards compatibility anyway, besides that you said GAP is faster (in factoring at least) for some (which kind of?) inputs.

Hi there,

For very small integers (<500) a naive cython implementation is **much** faster (at least x100)... as this was the initial purpose of Nathann I make the remark here.

```
def two_squares_pyx(int n):
    cdef int i,ii,j,nn
    if n < 2:
        return True

    i = ii = 0
    while ii < n:
        j = 0
        while j <= i:
            nn = ii + j*j
            if nn >= n:
                break
            j += 1

        if nn == n:
            return (i,j)

        i += 1
        ii = i*i

    raise ValueError("%d is not the sum of 2 squares"%n)
```

then

```

What do you think of using it for entries < 500?

I was hoping someone would do this.

I agree with pbruin, though of course this is not the same function as "number of ways to write as two squares" or "all ways to write as sum of two squares".  This is what happens when we "unwrap" :-)

Minor correction: `while ii <= n` (such that we get "trivial" solutions with `j==0` as well).  Also, I'd swap i and j, or `return (j,i)`.

Hello,

I implemented what I said in Cython (i.e. `two_squares_pyx`, `three_squares_pyx` and `four_squares_pyx`). Timings are now much better for small values (but it also influences small values).

Based on the timings below (with the old version), I put the threshold to 500 for the three functions. But if you have strong opinion for another threshold please tell me. 

There are many comments, but is there somebody up for a review ?

Hi,

Sorry. I was a bit fast. The decision of choosing my branch or not might be the choice of the author of the ticket. So if you want to have a look at my changes, see either u/vdelecroix/16308 or public/16308

There's even more room for optimizations; a C/Cython version is probably faster up to at least 10000 or even 2<sup>16</sup> (for `two_squares()`).

I'd also compare the overall speed over a range.

Probably open a separate ticket "Improve sums of squares *for small input*" and we can later (re)base one of them on the other.

Sorry, I had been looking at some diff of Vincent's code against yours, and only saw some `return (foo,)` (and I **swear** it was more than one!1!!1 ;-) ), but in your original code, or the one that's again here now, it's of course only in the case k=1 (sum of *one* square), which is correct.

Sorry for the noise.

Hi,

Related to comment:12, can you justify why using pari? We already have `factor` and `is_pseudoprime` and `sqrtrem` might be the replacement for `N.sqrtint`.

There are also trailing whitespaces on the lines 5161 and 5246.
