Assignee: jason, jkantor

Keywords: erf erfc

Because the argument is converted to `float` first, the error function `erf()` cannot numerically be evaluated for complex arguments:

```
sage: erf(pi - 1/2*I).n()
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1108, 0))

Thanks for that info; I didn't realize it was the new Pari that made this possible.

I'd say that if someone reviews this, it should go in. #1173 is probably not going to get finished immediately, and we can always switch to mpmath if necessary or convenient or speedy at that time.

Unfortunately, this causes a nasty problem.

This example in the documentation is fine - comparing mpmath:

```
sage: mpmath.erf(pi-1/2*i)
mpc(real='1.0000111669099367', imag='1.6332655417638451e-6')
```


But anything along the imaginary axis seems to be off by exactly 1:

```
sage: for z in [3,33,333,3333,33333]:
....:     mpmath.erf(i*z); erf(n(z)*i)
....:     
mpc(real='0.0', imag='1629.9946226015657')
1.00000000000000 + 1629.86732385786*I
mpc(real='0.0', imag='1.5128697751040891e+471')
1.00000000000000 + 1.51286977510409e471*I
mpc(real='0.0', imag='5.1260939089106243e+48155')
1.00000000000000 + 5.12609390891062e48155*I
mpc(real='0.0', imag='2.6385510598470926e+4824525')
1.00000000000000 + 2.63855105984709e4824525*I
```

But other values seem ok.

```

    mpmath.erf(1+i*z); erf(1.+n(z)*i)

Type ? for help, \q to quit.
Type ?12 for how to get moral (and possibly technical) support.

parisize = 8000000, primelimit = 500509
? erfc(3*I)
%1 = 0.E-35 - 1629.5516567497094550267455532288372861*I

so I see that this is still in "our" version of Pari.  Is this fixed upstream?   Is it possible that this is not actually a bug in Pari, but in our use of it?  Wolfram Alpha [gives the mpmath answer](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=erfc%283*i%29), for what it's worth.

I should also point out that we even doctest that it is wrong - due to my reviewer patch on this ticket :( so this is certainly a mea culpa among others.
