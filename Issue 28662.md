This is my review:

- I doubt if this

```
idx = index[l + 1]
if (i == len(expo) - 1 or expo[i + 1][idx:] != cur_exp[idx:]): 
```

 is better than the original code

```
if (i == len(expo) - 1 or expo[i+1][index[l+1]:] != cur_exp[index[l+1]:]):  
```


 On one hand, python should be clever enough to do the obvious optimization. On the other hand, computing `idx` is unnecessary if the first condition is met.

- You may want to put spaces around `+` here

```
            sage: f = H([z^2+c])  
```


- You may want to make modifications here as well

```
        INPUT:

        -  ``gfan_polyhedral_fan`` - output from ``gfan`` of a
           polyhedral fan.
        -  ``polynomial_system`` - a list of polynomials
        -  ``poly_ring`` - the polynomial ring of the list of polynomials
        -  ``parameters`` (optional) - a list of variables to be considered as parameters
 }}}

All other changes look good to me.

Here are the required changes.

Concerning your first point: I moved the definition of idx up, as it was used before. Also the last test almost always use idx, except when at the last step of the englobing loop.
