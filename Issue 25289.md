No. The reason is that there is no guarantee that iterating through a dictionary via `iteritems` you always get the same order (you can check that in the doctests there are `sorted` everywhere). But before this ticket, it was clearly not a DFS

```
sage: for w in Word("cacao").suffix_tree().factor_iterator(): print w
c
a
ac
aca
ao
acao
o
ca
cac
caca
cao
cacao
```

With this ticket it is

```
sage: for w in Word("cacao").suffix_tree().factor_iterator(): print w
a
ao
ac
aca
acao
o
c
ca
cao
cac
caca
cacao
```

Before this ticket, this just eats all the memory and CPU:


```
sage: w = words.FibonacciWord([0,1])
sage: it = w[:10000].suffix_tree().factor_iterator()
sage: %time L = list(it)
Processus arrêté
```


With the branch of this ticket, I get:


```
sage: w = words.FibonacciWord([0,1])
sage: it = w[:10000].suffix_tree().factor_iterator()
sage: %time L = list(it)
CPU times: user 14 s, sys: 504 ms, total: 14.5 s
Wall time: 14.5 s
sage: len(L)
24337601
```


So, it is definitely an improvement.
