I fixed the SIGSEGV upstream. The bug is in a function which isn't used by Sage (and is not recommended to be called yet), so I'd wait with cutting a new release. If you'd like to clean this up though and close this ticket, I can cut a new release.

Replying to [comment:7 leif]:
> Disabling SSE2 for fat builds is only necessary on x86 (32-bit), not x86_64.

But there don't seem to be configure options to disable SSE3 or SSSE3; a few early AMD x86_64 processors didn't support SSE3, and SSSE3 is only supported by *recent* AMD CPUs.
