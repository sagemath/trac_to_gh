# Issue 20403: sage-logger: show log(s) each line is going to on stdout

Issue created by migration from Trac.

A minor enhancement to `sage-logger` that I've found incredibly helpful.  Every line output to stdout is prefixed with the name(s) of the log file(s) they are being logged to.

In particular this helps sort out stdout when there are large number of make processes running in parallel.  It helps to reason about what lines of output are associated with which packages.  I know each package build is logged individually as well, but this still helps understand what's going on at a glance.  It also helps quickly determine which log file to look at if I see something scroll past that I want to investigate further.

Was that the only test that changed as a result?  Should be easy enough to update.

Since it seems that `sage-logger` is used in a few places besides just building, maybe this behavior should be enabled only via a switch.

I added an optional `-p` flag for applying the line prefix.  This way the previous default behavior is preserved, but the `-p` flag is used throughout the build system where it's most useful.

Resolution: fixed

This causes every single line in the output of `make` to have `[install] ` prepended. Surely, that's not useful and we shouldn't use the `-p` flag for the top-level `sage-logger`.

Also: this causes leading whitespace to be dropped from the logfile, which messes up ASCII-art-style error messages from GCC for example. See #20708.
