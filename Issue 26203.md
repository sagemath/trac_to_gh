Fusion algebras for WZW conformal field theories can be computed easily as instances of WeylCharacterRings. The `WeylCharacterRing` code is modified with an optional parameter k, the level. If `k==None` the behavior is unchanged. However if k is a positive integer the corresponding fusion ring is created. The reason this works is that the Kac-Walton algorithm for computing the fusion products is closely similar to the Brauer-Klimyk (aka Racah-Speiser) algorithm that is already used by the `WeylCharacterRing`. One has only to add an affine reflection to make the algorithm compute the fusion product.

For fusion rings, we should have a method that returns the (finite) canonical basis as a list or an iterator. Actually `WeylCharacterRing` has a basis method that it inherits from `CombinatorialFreeModule`. 

To avoid confusion with this basis method, the method that returns the basis as a list could then be called `fusion_basis`.

So, what is the best way to enumerate all dominant weights of level `<= k`?

I am not sure I like the basis for the fusion ring being anything other than what you want to call the `fusion_basis`.

I just constructed this as a `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet`, but we could also use `WeightedIntegerVectors`. Between those two, I have not run timings to determine which is faster. Both should take 2 lines to construct (one to get the levels, one to construct the parent to iterate over).

Timing might matter if someone wants to construct a "large" rank and level example. In terms of elegance, I would say `WeightedIntegerVectors` is better and more inline with the output as sums of fundamental weights (as dense vectors).

Most of the new methods have doctests.

I just made a minor change which is to make dual a method of the element, not the ring.

I'm a little dissatisfied that the S-matrix has not been implemented but that can be another patch.
