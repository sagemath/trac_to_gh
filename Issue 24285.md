There are a number of methods in pynac's numeric module that don't check for error results from `PyObject_RichCompareBool`.  This leads to unhandled exceptions that, on Python 2, were somewhat by luck being cleared via `PyObject_Clear()` later in the call stack.  Maybe this was somewhat by design but it doesn't feel that way.

On Python 3 we're less lucky--the interpreter asserts `PyErr_Occurred` in more places and we don't get so lucky.  That, at least, seems to be the source of the difference.  I need to investigate a little more though.

Yes, this still looks like what I described.  On Python 3 the exception leaks out, and slightly later on a call to `PyObject_IsInstance` in turn calls the type's `__instancecheck__` which goes through `_PyObject_FastCallDict` which in turn asserts `PyErr_Occurred`.

On Python 3 there is no `_PyObject_FastCallDict`, no assertion checks on `PyErr_Occurred` in the relevant code path, and eventually that error gets cleared.
