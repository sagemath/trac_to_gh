# Issue 7525: developer's guide: add information about editing python files in the sage library

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/7525

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2009-11-24 18:11:04

Assignee: mvngu

There have been a few questions on sage-support and sage-devel recently about which files to edit in the Sage library.  The attached patch tries to address this.  (It also deletes a paragraph which got included twice.)

Applied OK against Sage 4.3.alpha0 and rebuilding of the Developers' Guide went fine. The expository content of the patch `trac_7525-developer.patch` is reasonable. I can confirm that that patch also removes a duplicate section.
