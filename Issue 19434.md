Ah, I see now why Sloane.

As I said in #19616, it does build doc successfully with these changes, though I don't have my Sage install convenient to actually try the tests.  Anyone else could review that.

Replying to [comment:6 kcrisman]:
> try the tests.
You mean doctests or something else? The doctests pass.

I mean doctests, but I didn't know if one was allowed to use the patchbot to confirm this or test it oneself.  I usually try them 'by hand' and a few other things, and I won't be able to do more with that until at least Monday, probably Wednesday.  If you think this is sufficient though then I certainly trust patchbot + you and you can set it to positive review.
