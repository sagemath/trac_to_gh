Interesting... so, this `_cmp_` method is never used?

My guess is that between parents being `UniqueRepresentation` (or `UniqueFactory`) and those that are not directly having to implement comparisons, this is no longer used.

Although I am slightly cautious about including this in such a late beta cycle. So I am inclined to wait for `8.4.beta0`, but that is not a strong position. Thoughts?

so do we try this now or wait until 8.4.beta0 ? any other opinion ?

Let me just do one more test and then I'll set this to positive review.
