# Issue 19978: cannot run python3 in sage-shell

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20215

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2016-03-15 14:40:30


```
sage -i python3
sage -sh
python3
```

fails with

```
Fatal Python error: Py_Initialize: Unable to get the locale encoding
  File "/.../sage/7.1.rc0/local/lib/python/encodings/__init__.py", line 123
    raise CodecRegistryError,\
                            ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```


It seems the wrong path is used: the symlink `local/lib/python` instead of `local/lib/python3`. Changing this symlink to `local/lib/python3` makes python3 work, but prevents python2 from working.

I don't think this is a bug: either choose Python 2 or Python 3. Supporting both at the same time would be a lot of unnecessary trouble. We don't support concurrent installations of GMP and MPIR either.

is this fixed now, or not yet ? it should be, because py3 is standard..

Also `local/lib/python` should no longer exist, because of #22764: there should just be `local/lib/python2.7` and `local/lib/python3.5`.

Closing tickets in the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix module with positive_review (i.e. someone has confirmed they should be closed).
