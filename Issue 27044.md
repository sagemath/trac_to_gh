Thought there was a notion of k-weak excedances that could be implemented as a method on permutations. After further reading, this is only a notion for decorated permutations, which will appear in a future implementation of positroids.

But there is still the minor fix that the method `weak_excedences()` should be `weak_excedances()`, which will be done in the next day as a tutorial.

In fact, wiktionary thinks differently and mathematicians used all sorts of spellings.  More precisely:

* 'exceedance': https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/exceedance, Corteel, Sedgewick, ...
* 'excedance': https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/excedance, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation, Stanley
* 'excedence': Williams, Corteel, van Willigenburg, ... 

Although 'exedance' also occurs, I think that this probably is by exitand.

Strange, I've only ever read papers using 'excedance' (excluding one by Foata and Zeilberger from 1990 which apparently used 'excedence').

Looks like this issue came up in ( #15454 ), which originally used 'excedences' to match what was in sage, but ultimately went with 'excedances' to match the relevant reference.
