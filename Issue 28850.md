This is a follow-up on #29053: Add debian/fedora/arch package information to build/pkgs, generate Dockerfiles and installation help

This ticket adds `.github/workflows/tox.yml`, which installs a number of system packages and then runs `./bootstrap`, `./configure` and a bit of `make`.

Most of the interesting parts are in #29053 - everything can be run "locally" (with tox and docker). This ticket only adds a simple additional file to run this automatically with several jobs on [GitHub](GitHub) Actions on a commit.

For each of the Linux distributions supported, there are two configurations: 
- `minimal` - has enough packages so that the build can succeed; 
- `standard` - has additionally all standard packages for which we have `spkg-configure.m4`.

Context: 
- #29060: Meta-ticket: Add `Dockerfile`s and CI scripts for integration testing of source and binary distributions and of downstream packages
- #27330: Meta-ticket: `spkg-configure`: Try to use as many system packages as possible
