I am not sure this is a problem. I thought that things like `zip` were (repeatedly) iterable. So the initial iteration should be okay, and `delete_edges` also iterates over the edges. Or can we only iterate over it once?

I see. I think a better solution in this case is to duplicate the zip (with a comment saying in Python3, we need a fresh iterator). That way we keep the advantages in Python3, and we still have to make a copy of the list in Python2. What do you think?
