I'll say that's damning evidence. I did a quick inspection to see if something else obvious was missing but I couldn't find anything. Shouldn't it also be in `requirements.txt` and `setup.cfg`? Especially if it blocks stuff on Pypi, I would expect those to be looked at rather than `dependencies` which is a sage build system artifact not a pure python one.

In between this ticket and my previous one about the `build` target that was also related to `autogen`, it occured to me that the whole `autogen` should probably moved somewhere else in the near future.

I should expand, with modularization `sage_setup` is providing some build tools for other sage modules and possibly downstream package. `autogen` is only used by one of these modules at most and should therefore live with it. It is not at the present a common infrastructure used by many modules. May be you already have a ticket about this that I am unaware off?

Yes, this is a good point. I haven't worked on it yet because I'm not 100% sure whether all of the "interpreters" that are built by autogen will end up in the same distribution package.
