# Issue 33122: Allow unary minus to define negative of function

Keywords: additive inverse, opposite, negative, sign change, negation, unary minus

One would expect to define the negative of a function
using unary minus.

However it sometimes causes a type error:

```
sage: f = cosh
sage: g = -cosh
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-12-bb84c79e4303> in <module>
----> 1 g = -cosh

TypeError: bad operand type for unary -: 'Function_cosh'
```

This could perhaps be done by setting up a coercion from functions to a `CallableSymbolicExpressionRing`

... so that `-cosh` would give `(-cosh(z)).function(z)`

for this to make full sense, some progress in #28434 is needed, in particular "7. Addition confusion".
