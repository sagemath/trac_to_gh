In #6949, we added `max_symbolic` and `min_symbolic` to a new file, but it apparently isn't in the reference manual.  Let's fix that; shouldn't be hard.

Hi, and thanks for your first contribution!  For now, I'll just point out that you can use

```
hg qrefresh -e
```

to change the commit message, which right now is the somewhat enigmatic `[mq]: minmax`.  See [the Sage developer manual](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#creating-your-own-patch-with-queues) for a similar command.
