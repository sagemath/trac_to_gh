# Issue 13653: Add symbolic max and min to reference manual

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: beginner

In #6949, we added `max_symbolic` and `min_symbolic` to a new file, but it apparently isn't in the reference manual.  Let's fix that; shouldn't be hard.

Hi, and thanks for your first contribution!  For now, I'll just point out that you can use

```
hg qrefresh -e
```

to change the commit message, which right now is the somewhat enigmatic `[mq]: minmax`.  See [the Sage developer manual](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#creating-your-own-patch-with-queues) for a similar command.

This works nicely.  As noted above, you do need to change your commit message to something helpful (such as "added symbolic min and max to reference manual").  Nice catch on the typesetting of min and max.

I think this also needs a little bit of work because, although the examples in the symbolic min and max functions explain why there is this difference, the introductory material you added is sort of contextless; some people might only read this part.  Giving a brief explanation of why these are necessary (perhaps along the lines already in the doc for the functions themselves) would be helpful.  Adding one or two examples from the underscore methods may also be useful, you could look at them to see.

When you've done this, you can replace this patch when you upload it if you give the same name to the file (there is a checkbox for this).  Then just set back to "needs review"!

I had to rebase this, for some reason the patch wouldn't apply properly.

Okay, I added one additional example which I think would be useful.  I also made some minor adjustments to wording.  This does need some minor review just to make sure my additional example works and everything is fine.


Patchbot, apply trac_13857-rebased.patch and trac_13857-review.patch
