We've have several requests and discussions ([on the mailing lists](http://groups.google.com/groups/search?q=equation+editor+group%3Asage-devel&btnG=Search&sitesearch=), etc.) for an interactive equation editor for Sage.

Some possibilities:

* [D. Cervone's experimental editor](http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/talks/2006-12-08.IMA/editor.html) (but see [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/28c918d66a421573/3ed595b482b889b4#3ed595b482b889b4))

Yes, I believe that an interactive equation editor will bring more non-programming math students to using SAGE, especially secondary school students, where programming is most likely not taught.

Davide has told me that he's designed MathJax with an equation-editor application in mind, so it's probably going to be better to start with MathJax.  Especially since we will likely soon move to using MathJax instead of jsmath.
