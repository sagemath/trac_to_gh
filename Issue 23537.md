If the Python function `makedirs` is used to achieve the effect of `mkdir -p`, one needs to distinguish two situations: Directory already exists; directory does not exist and cannot be created.

I prefer a simpler

```
if not os.path.isdir(path):
    raise
```

in the `except` block. Why do you need to check in addition the `errno`?
