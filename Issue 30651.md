After #30128 (enforce sourcing of `sage-env-config` before `src/bin/sage-env`) and #29850, `SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR`, set in `sage-env`, is not used for anything. We remove it.

What kind of solution is acceptable here? I've lost track of the big picture, but it looks like all of the important `./configure`-time settings are in `sage-env-config`, but `local/bin/sage` can't find `sage-env-config` because the path to it (determined during `./configure`) is contained in `sage-env-config`.

Are we allowed to stick autoconf values directly into `local/bin/sage` (after renaming with an `.in` suffix), like


```
: ${SAGE_ROOT:=@abs_top_srcdir@}
```


which would set a default value of `SAGE_ROOT` at `./configure`-time, but still allow custom values of `SAGE_ROOT` to be set in the environment?

The directory can be found from $0, with resolving symlinks.
Similar to what used to be in `sage-env`, but not bash-specific because it's for an executed script rather than a sourced script.

No, because the `sage` script is installed by `setup.py` and we plan to make this work even when `configure` has not been run.

We can fake `realpath` by copy & pasting the 70-line `resolvelinks()` function from sage-env, but I think that's pretty ugly:

* It's copy/pasting a ton of code. We can't source sage-env for it, because we don't know where sage-env lives.
* The function still doesn't work in some common cases, like hardlinks into the tree or symlinks out of the tree.
* It's a waste of time recomputing the same paths every time "sage" is run, in slow shell script.

If setup.py installs the script, it knows the correct location. It could replace a placeholder at install-time as in e.g. https://git.launchpad.net/dkimpy-milter/tree/setup.py

Hardlinks - granted.

What do you mean by "symlinks out of the tree"?

We would just document what is supported. The installation manual already has some guidance regarding "system wide installation" that needs updating anyway.

> * It's a waste of time recomputing the same paths every time "sage" is run, in slow shell script.

True, but perhaps the resolving code would only be run if the files cannot be found without resolving. Then it would impose the runtime penalty only if symlinks are in use.

No, this is unfortunately not true. The final install location of the Python package is not known at `setup.py` time.

If you move `local/bin/sage` elsewhere, and then create a symlink from `local/bin/sage` to that location. In that case, you don't want to use the absolute physical path of the script that's being run to find `SAGE_ROOT`, rather the absolute physical path of its original install location.
