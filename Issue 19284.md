```
sage: Q.<y> = SR.subring(no_variables=True)[[]]
sage: (y / 1).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Symbolic Ring
```

but the result should be

```
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Symbolic Constants Subring
```

since there is a coercion from the integer ring to the symbolc constants subring.

This is because the attrirute `coercion_reversed` of `ConstructionFunctor` is not taken into account.

Hi! I've merged the (positively reviewed) dependency into this branch and reviewed the code in this ticket.

I think I understand your fix as well as the strategy behind it, and I am willing to give this a `positive_review` (i.e. everything LGTM). However, I'd rather be sure:

In principle, all that happens is that you order the functors and parents from smallest to largest (in the sense of coercion) and iterate over this reordered tower such that actually the smallest parent with the required property is found?

For example, (using your notation from the comment), if we had a tower `A -> B <- C <- D -> E`, then the old code would iterate over `[A, B, C, D, E, F]`, and in your fixed version we iterate over `[A, D, C, B, E]`?

Also, I'd like to give the patchbots a chance to test this---or, at least, run `make ptestlong` myself.
