# Issue 23785: Rremove src/sage/misc/sage_itertools.py

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2017-10-12 13:36:37

`src/sage/misc/sage_itertools.py` contains the two deprecated functions `min_cmp()` and `max_cmp()` (deprecated since #21043) and one function `imap_and_filter_none` which is only used in `src/sage/combinat/backtrack.py`. This function is moved to `backtrack.py`.

good idea ! but beware that min_cmp and max_cmp are called somewhere.

If the patchbot is green, then positive review. (I'm also assuming you do want an 8.2 release for extra deprecation time.)
