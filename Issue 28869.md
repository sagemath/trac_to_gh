# Issue 28869: Add cygwin package information

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29106

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2020-01-30 02:59:24

CC:  embray dimpase tscrim

As a followup to #29053, in analogy to the work done for debian/fedora/arch/conda, we
add files `build/pkgs/SPKG/distros/cygwin.txt` to keep track of equivalent distribution packages

using these sources:
- https://github.com/sagemath/sage-windows/blob/master/cygwin-sage-build.list
- https://github.com/sagemath/sage-windows/blob/master/cygwin-sage-runtime.list

However, some of these instructions and packages I still need to confirm.  Some new packages have been added since I last tried installing them on Cygwin, and I don't know for sure if *all* of these packages are usable on Cygwin yet (or if I'm not missing a few).  I'm not at my Windows machine right now though so I'll have to confirm this later.

Looking great already.

src/doc/en/installation/cygwin*.txt should be removed from source tree and gitignored.

tests on #29295 seem to suggest that libcypt0 package should be added to the list.

Changing component from porting to porting: Cygwin.

All of these build errors should be fixed in follow-up tickets. 
Needs review!

looks good. It's great that GH actions provide means to test on cygwin.
