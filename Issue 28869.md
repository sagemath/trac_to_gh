As a followup to #29053, in analogy to the work done for debian/fedora/arch/conda, we
add files `build/pkgs/SPKG/distros/cygwin.txt` to keep track of equivalent distribution packages

using these sources:
- https://github.com/sagemath/sage-windows/blob/master/cygwin-sage-build.list
- https://github.com/sagemath/sage-windows/blob/master/cygwin-sage-runtime.list

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29106

However, some of these instructions and packages I still need to confirm.  Some new packages have been added since I last tried installing them on Cygwin, and I don't know for sure if *all* of these packages are usable on Cygwin yet (or if I'm not missing a few).  I'm not at my Windows machine right now though so I'll have to confirm this later.
