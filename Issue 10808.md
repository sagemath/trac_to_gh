When you try to upload this zip file using the URL box, there is an error.  When you download and then upload it to the notebook using the Browse box (from your local filesystem), it works fine:

#9875 and #7441 are almost certainly related, if not duplicates.

Also related to #10652 which needs review.

Only related, as it turns out.

Hi,

Could someone check whether the desired feature is not in Sage now that #10652 has been merged in?

If yes, please mark this ticket as a duplicate, so that it can be closed by the release manager.

Cheeers,
                   Nicolas

Proposing to close all sagenb tickets as outdated, so that all remaining open tickets in the notebook component are about the Jupyter notebook.
