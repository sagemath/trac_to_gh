# Issue 20235: Remove PyX optional package

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20472

See https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/9kx4zsnMYlQ/discussion with the summary: we have an ancient version of PyX as an old-style optional package which seems to break pip at least in some cases. On the other hand it is possible to install a newer version through pip directly.

You forgot to push...

Comment by dimpase created at 2016-04-20 06:39:32

there isn't anything to push, as far as I know, as it's an old style package...

Then why not simply add a new-style `pip` package for `PyX`?

what is the point of this?

This is pure bloat - why not add a package for everything in pypi?!

By the way, I don't even get what you mean, really. Do we even have any new-style optional packages without mirrored tarballs, just pypi-installable?

Yes, we do. See `mercurial` for one example.

No idea what you mean. It's broken, anyway:

```
$ sage -p mercurial
Attempting to download package mercurial
Downloading the Sage mirror list
...
Fastest mirror: http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/www.sagemath.org/
>>> Checking online list of optional packages.
>>> Checking online list of experimental packages.
>>> Checking online list of huge packages.
Error: could not find a package matching mercurial
       Try 'sage --package list' to see the available packages
       Did you mean: brial?
```

Why are you using `sage -p` to install packages? That's a low-level command that you should only use "if you know what you're doing". With `sage -i mercurial`, it works fine.

Is there any rationale for having all that

```
build/pkgs/blah/
```

with the only content `build/pkgs/blah/type`, so that one can do
`sage -i blah`, whereas one could just as well do `sage --pip install blah` with the same effect?

User-friendlyness of having one interface (`sage -i PKGNAME`) instead of multiple ones.

given that `sage --pip install blah` is available, you **create** more complexity by adding `sage -i blah`

besides, there is not telling whether what you install with `sage -i` can be uninstalled. At least in the case of `sage --pip` you can uninstall! And you still talk about user-friendliness...
