See https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/9kx4zsnMYlQ/discussion with the summary: we have an ancient version of PyX as an old-style optional package which seems to break pip at least in some cases. On the other hand it is possible to install a newer version through pip directly.

No idea what you mean. It's broken, anyway:

```
$ sage -p mercurial

Why are you using `sage -p` to install packages? That's a low-level command that you should only use "if you know what you're doing". With `sage -i mercurial`, it works fine.
