GCC 4.6.3 miscompiles `src/language/init.c` on OS X 10.4 PPC (32-bit), because of a problem with pointer arithmetic in `stack_base()` called in `pari_init_functions()`.

This is upstream bug [http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49330](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49330)

There is an easy work-around by reordering some code.
