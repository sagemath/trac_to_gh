I have uploaded an add-on patch which  
- puts the raise statements into python3 syntax
- adds the links to the trac tickets

But there is a problem with your patch: one doctest is failing, there is no curve called '50700u1', even after installing the extended Cremona database.

Chris, can you give us (here) a quick note about the new el5 assignment from roots of a quadratic instead of whatever it was before?

Also, we need to put instructions in the descriptions about applying both patches in sequence.

Yes, I am sure this improves this function.

The function `_ex_set(p)` at the start of the file lists the elements in PGL_2(F_p) that may appear in an exceptional subgroup A_n or S_n. Or rather it lists what `trace^2/det` evaluates on them. (This is taken from Serre's paper). In particular the elements of order 5 are the roots of `(X**2 - 3*X+1)`, which we add at the end to the list.

Now later this is used in the function `image_type`. Unfortunately, I took the last two elements, when in fact for some `p` there is are no such elements of order 5. As a consequence, the example that John found all possibilities for what the subgroup could be were eliminated. Hence the answer "bug". Now it gives the correct answer.

So the maths did not change, just a silly bug was eliminated.

Too late for this ticket, but unfortunately a typo causes this:

```
EllipticCurve([0, 0, 0, -1129345880,-86028258620304]).galois_representation().image_type(11)
```

gives

```
NameError: global name 'nonsplit_str' is not defined
```

because the identifier non_split_str is referred to wrongly on lines 1054 and 1108 in gal_reps.py.  I have another patch which I will put onto a new ticket: #14752.
