# Issue 34203: Conic parametrization does not check correctness of input points.

The `parametrization` method of plane conic curves has an optional `point` parameter. It should check the correctness of such a point, or at least warn in the documentation that it is not checked. This currently does not happen:

```
sage: C = Conic(QQ, [1,1,-1])
sage: l = [1,1,0]
sage: C(l) # correctly raises an error
...
TypeError: Coordinates [1, 1, 0] do not define a point on Projective Conic Curve over Rational Field defined by x^2 + y^2 - z^2
sage: f, g = C.parametrization(l) # silently accepts the incorrect point and creates an incorrect parametrization
sage: f([1,2])
...
TypeError: Coordinates [3/4, 5/4, 1] do not define a point on Projective Conic Curve over Rational Field defined by x^2 + y^2 - z^2
sage: 
```
