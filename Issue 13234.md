Hi Franco,

Essentially, vector(...) is very slow, in particular because it first has to figure out which dense free module F to use. The patch builds that free module once for all (in the _dense_free_module method which is cached). And then it saves a bit more by feeding the data directly to the element class of F, and being careful about the options).

```

As far as I can tell, the patch as posted does not functionally change anything. It changes the documentation of `CombinatorialFreeModuleElement._vector_` without changing the corresponding code, and adds the method `CombinatorialFreeModule._dense_free_module` without adding any code to have it called.

I confirmed this experimentally by getting the following timings on sage-5.3 for the first three tests in the ticket description (`f._vector_()`, `f.to_vector()`, `vector(f)`):

Before: 270, 270, 293 µs


After: 265, 266, 290 µs

and also by adding a `print` statement to `_dense_free_module` (so that I know the code is never called). I got similar results by trying this on sage-5.3 + combinat.

Is it possible that the patch file got corrupted, or that it is based on an already modified version of Sage, or that there is an unstated dependency which introduces `_dense_free_module` as a hook?

Yikes! Yes, definitely, a hunk (well, THE interesting hunk) was somehow lost in that patch. I can't find it either on the combinat server, so I must have screwed up somewhere. Thanks for catching this! I'll work on this tomorrow morning.

Cheers,

PS: I now better understand Franco's comment about the subtlety of this patch!
