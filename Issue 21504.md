For example


```
G = Graph()
known_kaboom = ['is_prime', 'layout_graphviz']
errors = []
for f in [y for y in dir(G) if y[0] != '_']:
    if f in known_kaboom:
        continue
    try:
        attrcall(f)(G)
    except TypeError as e:
        if "takes exactly" in e.message:
            continue
    except Exception as e:
        print(f, e)
        print
        errors.append(f)
        continue
errors
```


shows some errors on empty graph (or more general in a corner case: `eulerian_circuit` on any graph without edges). Correct them.

True, but that should done in every function, not just for those I now modified.

Maybe at the same time when checking docstrings. There are too many "Returns" vs. "Return", "Return if the graph..." vs. "Tests whether the graph" etc, and also some indentation errors.

I don't like these lines:

```diff

+            raise ValueError("can't get a random vertex from the empty graph")
```


There are graphs with no edges which are not the empty graph.

Perhaps you wanted to put there `self.order()` instead?

1. `g.average_degree()` (both this and `g.maximum_average_degree()` may raise, perhaps, `ZeroDivisionError`, but in this case a more informative error would be helpful probably)
2. `g.bridges()` raises `StopIteration`.  Should probably return an empty list.

Finally, should we add the alias `NullGraph` to `EmptyGraph`?

Comments **1**-**5** seems to be very much related to this ticket, but I see no real harm in opening a new ticket for them.

Comments **6**-**8** are directly related to your patch, so they should be probably discussed (and/or fixed) in this ticket.

Comments **9**-**11** are really different stuff. It might be better to open a new ticket(s) for these. I'll do that.

Don't be afraid of merge commits.  These can be handled.
