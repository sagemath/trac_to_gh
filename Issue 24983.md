CC:  tmonteil @EmmanuelCharpentier mafra

As reported at https://ask.sagemath.org/question/40733/integrate-sqrt1-cosx-integrinterval-from-0-to-2pi, the sage interface to the fricas integrator fails to do the definite integral

```
sage: integral(sqrt(1-cos(x)), x, 0, 2*pi, algorithm="fricas")
```

which this ticket fixes:

```
4*sqrt(2)
```


See also #24587.

I have compiled sage where the last commit is


```
commit 06a28da627ee5c08f3eede278c1338ff47bdc44a
Author: Martin Rubey <martin.rubey@tuwien.ac.at>

    add missing import
```

and I get a division by zero error that starts like this:

```
integrate(sqrt(1-cos(x)),x,0,2*pi,algorithm='fricas')

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)

    754     else:

Any ideas of what I did wrong? However, I checked that your `dilog` changes from #25224 are indeed fixed.

Hm, I cannot reproduce this.  Do you have all of

- #25174 	conversion of I to fricas is wrong
- #25220 	fix definite fricas integration
- #25224 	Mismatch in the definition of dilog() between fricas and sympy

applied?

Sorry for the noise, I missed the other ones when I merged your branch for #25224 as I was under the impression that it also contained the other fixes. Sorry again!
