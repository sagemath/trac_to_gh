# Issue 17433: Get rid of hook_tp_functions() hack

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17670

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-01-25 16:51:20

CC:  roed saraedum caruso

The classes `integer.pyx` and `real_double.pyx` use `hook_tp_functions()` to change `tp_new` and `tp_dealloc` at run-time. With Cython, such hacks are not needed: one can just define `__new__` and `__dealloc__` and things should "just work".

Some hackery is still needed because these types also disable garbage collection by changing `tp_flags` and there is no clean Cython interface to do this.

I've just had a look at your implementation (sorry for the delay).

I saw that you stored the address of the pool in a dictionary. Did you try to estimate the time penalty of this dictionary lookup? For instance, did you compare timings between (1) your implementation and (2) the current implementation for integers?

By design, your implementation cannot allow what I've called local pools (several different pools are possible for a same type) and global pools (a unique pool is shared all by all elements having a given type). I'm a bit sad about this because I think that having different pools may really make sense (for instance for p-adics when we are dealing with many different primes p and then objects with different sizes).
But OK, I can accept this :-).

Why are you limiting the number of pools to 4? Isn't it too small?

4 *per Cython module*.

A more general comment about pools is that everybody has a different set of features. For example, the `Integer` pool that we currently have in Sage is actually more than just a pool. It also constructs new objects quickly from a prototype object.

Let me continue with this... I'm adding a dependency on #24111 because that makes it a lot easier to write modules which are partially implemented in C and partially in Cython.

I am not doing any dictionary lookup (except for putting the pool in the dict). I am storing the pool in the dict for 2 reasons: for debugging purposes and to ensure that some reference is kept to the pool (to prevent it from being deleted). I do not use this dict in the implementation.

I never understood the need for local pools. I thought that you stored the pool in the parent only for practical purposes.

> and then objects with different sizes

What do you mean with "objects with different sizes"?

Cool!  I read through the code, but am too sleepy to make comments (or test further) tonight.  Overall, it looks good and tests pass!

There is worrying doctest failure on the patchbot that I'll need to check.

I do intend to come back to this ticket, but this really needs a new version of Cython.

Sorry, I merged by mistake ticket #23505 into this one.
This should be fixed now.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2018-02-26 14:23:08

So the branch should be reset to my branch then?


---

Comment by caruso created at 2018-02-26 14:38:15

Well, I also resolved a couple of conflicts, so that my branch is supposed to merge properly with develop.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2018-02-26 14:53:18

I see. But given that #24111 is not a "real" ticket, it's better to rebase instead of merge.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2018-03-14 19:34:27

#24111 just became a real ticket and it needs review :-)

Changing keywords from "" to "padicIMA".

Xavier, Julian and I are going to be working on p-adics this coming week in Bordeaux.  I'm just tagging this ticket as one we might want to look at.


---

Comment by roed created at 2019-09-07 11:48:35

Changing keywords from "padicIMA" to "padicIMA, padicBordeaux".

Jeroen, we're happy to work on this a bit this week (in particular, resolving merge conflicts).  Do you have any known issues with what you've written?


---

Comment by roed created at 2019-09-07 15:24:48

I resolved the merge conflicts, which were in the cython version level and `integer.pyx`, but now Sage crashes on startup.  When I ran `make build`, it surprisingly only rebuilt 4 Cython files.  Given that there are patches to Cython in this ticket, I think I might need to reinstall Cython with `sage -f cython`, but I think I'm going to work on other tickets for now rather than try to debug this.
