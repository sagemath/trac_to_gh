Add a patch for [http://bugs.python.org/issue26476](http://bugs.python.org/issue26476) which fixes a violation of the C++ standard. GCC accepts the code anyway, but gives a warning

```
/home2/jdemeyer/sage-linbox/local/include/python2.7/pyerrors.h:221:74: warning: ISO C++ forbids converting a string constant to ‘char*’ [-Wwrite-strings]
```
