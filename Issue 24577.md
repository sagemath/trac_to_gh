The function `prepare_dict` is meant to be used by the matrix constructor. However, it is also used in a convoluted and inefficient way in `ChainComplex`.

This should be fixed because #24742 plans to remove the `prepare_dict` function.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24814
