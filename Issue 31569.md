# Issue 31569: No help for primes function in the Jupyter notebook.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31806

Original creator: culler

Original creation time: 2021-05-10 01:07:01

When running sage in the terminal you can type

```
primes?
```

to get help on the function primes() and you can type

```
Primes?
```

to get help on the class Primes.  But in the Jupyter notebook there is no output in the first case.  The second one generates similar output in either context.

I can not reproduce the problem, i do have a doc in both cases in the Jupyter notebook.

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.
