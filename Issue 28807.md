Maybe Erik or Francois would be more apt to approve this one ?

In the exec tests, why add the explicit `pydebug_ignore_warnings` argument, when that behavior could be invoked automatically in a py-debug build?

In an ideal world we shouldn't special case debug builds. Its just that some commandline tests call third-party code that end up coughing up the default-ignored warnings. Really e.g. IPython should be fixed to not have warnings, but until that is the case we need a way to ignore them. So the `pydebug_ignore_warnings` argument intentionally looks ugly since we shouldn't use it.
