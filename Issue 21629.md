Is there a reason why you removed these tests:

```
sage: cmp(x, 3) is not 0
True
sage: x == 0
False
```

The former could be

```
sage: x == 3
False
```

The latter could be kept as-is.

Those are comparison to something not in the same parent.

Python3 is much more strict on what one can compare. For example, it is not allowed to compare strings (like 'e') and numbers (like 4).
