Playing with finite fields on Sage 6.10 or 7.0:

```
GF(30011**(19*3), name='z')
...
ValueError: the order of a finite field must be a prime power
```

Apparently `is_prime_power` returns `False` for that cardinality.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20025

Thanks, I was building the latest beta to see if the PARI update changed anything (though I could not say at this point if PARI is involved).
