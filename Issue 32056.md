# Issue 32056: Orlik-Terao invariant algebra

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32293

Original creator: tkarn

Original creation time: 2021-07-28 22:23:21

CC:  tscrim tkarn

Implement a subclass of FiniteDimensionalInvariantModule specifically for the Orlik-Terao algebra of a matroid, given an action on the groundset.

C.f. the related implementation for the Orlik-Solomon algebra #32027 (which is not a dependency for this ticket).

A few minor things:

```diff
-self._side = side = kwargs.pop('side', 'left')
+self._side = kwargs.pop('side', 'left')
```


```diff
     - ``action_on_groundset`` -- a function defining the action of
-    ``G`` on the elements of the groundset of ``M`` default
+      ``G`` on the elements of the groundset of ``M`` default
 
     OUTPUT:
 
-    - The invariant algebra of the Orlik-Terao algebra induced by
-    the action of ``action_on_groundset``
+    - the invariant algebra of the Orlik-Terao algebra induced by
+      the action of ``action_on_groundset``
```


```diff
-    The underlying ambient module is a ``Representation`` and so the
-    Orlik-Terao algebra itself is the ``.ambient()._module``::
+    The underlying ambient module is the Orlik-Terao algebra,
+    which is accessible via :meth:`ambient()`::
```


```diff
-Examples::
+EXAMPLES::
```


```diff
         - ``x`` -- the result of the action of ``g`` on ``f`` inside
-        of the Orlik-Terao algebra
+          of the Orlik-Terao algebra
```


```diff
-if f == frozenset():
+if not f:
```
