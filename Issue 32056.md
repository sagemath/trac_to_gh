CC:  tscrim tkarn

Implement a subclass of FiniteDimensionalInvariantModule specifically for the Orlik-Terao algebra of a matroid, given an action on the groundset.

C.f. the related implementation for the Orlik-Solomon algebra #32027 (which is not a dependency for this ticket).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32293
