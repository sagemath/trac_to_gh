Morphisms between free modules are basically represented by matrices.  Here is how they sometimes print:


```
sage: V = ZZ^6
sage: W = ZZ^4
sage: m = matrix(QQ, [[1, 0, 0 ,0], [0]*4, [0]*4, [0]*4, [0]*4, [0]*4])
sage: phi = V.hom(m, W)
sage: rho = phi.restrict_codomain(W.span([W.0]))
sage: rho
Free module morphism defined by the matrix
(not printing 6 x 1 matrix)
Domain: Ambient free module of rank 6 over the principal ideal domain ...
Codomain: Free module of degree 4 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
Echelon ...
```


The cutoff (...) on the domains is totally arbitrary, at 60 characters.

Here is the new output with upcoming patch:


```
Free module morphism defined by the matrix
[1]
[0]
[0]
[0]
[0]
[0]
Domain: Ambient free module of rank 6 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
Codomain: Free module of degree 4 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[1 0 0 0]
```

Passes all long tests for 4.7.1.alpha3

Small chance this will bitrot, relative to some other patches I have up for related files.  I'll try to stay on top of it, but let me know if this causes doctests failures.

patch applies (with fuzz) to 4.7.2.alpha3 and all long tests pass.
