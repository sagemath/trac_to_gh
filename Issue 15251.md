Many of these are my own fault, but

```
try:
    sig_on()
    ...
finally:
    sig_off()
```

should become

```
sig_on()
try:
    ...
finally:
    sig_off()
```

Hellooooooo Jeroen !

I have two questions about your patch:
* Why do you create two layers of try/catch in ppl.pyx around `rel.thisptr = new_relation_with(self.thisptr[0], g.thisptr[0])`
* Why do you replace `ValueError` by `BaseException` ?

Thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanks !

Because there is no other way to achieve the same result with only one `try`/`finally` ;-)

> * Why do you replace `ValueError` by `BaseException` ?
Because the only purpose of that `except` branch is to put the object in a consistent state before re-raising the exception. I guess the "putting the object in a consistent state" part should also be done when other exceptions happen.

And `except BaseException:` is equivalent to `except:`, since all exceptions derive from `BaseException`, don't they?  The second form looks slightly clearer to me.

Explicit is better than implicit (see [The Zen of Python](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)). I prefer `except BaseException:` because it's explicit that I really want to catch all exceptions.

In almost all cases where I saw `except:`, it was by mistake. In fact, as release manager, I simply rejected any patches containing `except:`.

More wisdom from The Zen of Python (see above):

```
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
