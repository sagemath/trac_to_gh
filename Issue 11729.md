Keywords: noisy zero epsilon threshold polynomial term

This is a follow-up to #7852 (and #11897).

As [reported on sage-release](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/msg/e885e53316c6880f), some doctests in Sage 4.7.2.alpha3 still failed on a PowerPC running MacOS X 10.4 due to numerical noise (or slightly different behaviour, giving correct but varying results).

The patch here further increases the threshold for noisy zero terms of polynomials slightly.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11901

This looks good to me, but I think we need to see if it does the job on Mac PowerPC?

I know this is sort of silly, but it is nice to have all tests pass :)

Works fine.

Of course.  Did I ever say it wasn't?  I don't actually *use* this machine, only to test Sage.
