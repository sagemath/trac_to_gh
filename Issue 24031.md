There are a few possible approaches to updating the pexpect interfaces in Sage to handle bytes vs. unicode:

1) By default pexpect deals with bytes (that is `str` on Python 2, `bytes` on Python 3).  This is probably the best way to continue using it, as I'll explain.

2) However, `pexpect.spawn` (and by extension `SageSpawn`) does accept an `encoding` and `coded_errors` arguments.  If given, it automatically encodes and decodes all strings using the given codec.  On Python 3 this would mean less code needs to be updated in the pexpect interfaces to explicitly use `bytes`.

The downside to 2) is that it means on Python 2 `pexpect.spawn` suddenly starts returning `unicode` strings when it didn't before.  While this *could* be useful in general it's an undesired regression.

I also suspect that 2) would be slower.  For example, it means all the regular expressions passed to expect need to be full unicode regexps.  That said in most cases they contain ASCII only, and current versions of Python 3 are well optimized for this case.  It still might be slightly slower though, especially when parsing binary codes like terminal command codes, which might require "surrogateescape" error handling.  It might be worth profiling in one or two cases (the GAP interface is a good choice for profiling this).

The downside to 1) is that it requires more code changes at the level of the individual interfaces, to encode/decode and work explicitly with `bytes` where appropriate.  I've already made experimental implementations of this approach with the GAP and Maxima interfaces and it wasn't too bad.   But I wonder if there's a middle ground between 1) and 2) that would make things easier.

#24957 implements a sort of middle ground, where we still use `pexpect.spawn` as a `bytes` interface, but we strategically add some wrappers around it that call `bytes_to_str`.
