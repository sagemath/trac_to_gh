In the docstring, should it be "characteristic polynomial"? The "polynomial" is missing.

The `.. SEEALSO::` `:meth:` blocks are not latex (both sides should be ```).

Be careful of this change:

```diff
-                for k from deb <= k <= d by r:
+                for k in range(deb, d+1, r):
```

The C code might not be a simple `for` loop as I don't think Cython is smart enough to realize when the step is an integer.

Trivially for PEP8, can you remove the spaces around the list-comprehension brackets (i.e., `[1 for x in L]` instead of `[ 1 for x in L ]`)?

Hence it appears as a bivariate polynomial.
