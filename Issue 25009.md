Maybe you should add an optional argument to allow naming the variables used in the polynomial ring.

In the case where the `base_ring not in (QQ, RR, ZZ)` I would find it more convenient to also output the actual value of the argument?

In the for loop, you might want to use the `enumerate(v)` function.

Changing keywords from "Boolean function, numerical normal form" to "Boolean function, numerical normal form, days94".
