I did a fresh install of Mountain Lion (after formatting the disk) and I installed the current version of Xcode and the commandline Tools. I downloaded sage 5.2 and it fails to build.

Error installing package mercurial-2.2.2.p0

The log is attached.

There is a subtle change in Mountain Lion which defaults to that system header files will use Objective C syntax constructs
although we are compiling just pure C.  This explains the build error in mercurial above. Setting the compiler flag OS_OBJECT_USE_OBJC=0
reverts this change, so that setting (globally, as I guess there is only pure C in sage) 

 `export CFLAGS="-DOS_OBJECT_USE_OBJC=0"`\\
 `make`

will compile mercurial.

A second build error occurred in gd-2.0.35.p7 where the header file fontconfig/fontconfig.h was not found. If you experience this, adding the include /opt/X11/include helps to compile gd but induces a version incompatibility between the fontconfig and freetype later when starting sage. A workaround for me was to compile fontconfig into the sage local tree using the correct free type libs and then continue with make.

A third error occurred  during compilation of scipy, where Mountain Lion does not specify the correct accelerators. Here the following helps.

 `export CPPFLAGS="-D__ACCELERATE__"` \\
 `make clean` \\
 `make`

After that sage 5.3 compiled (at least on my 10.8.1).

After upgrading to the latest Mountain Lion (10.8.2) and the latest Xcode (4.5 (4G182)), many of these problems are going away for me. Note that I do not have any version of X11 installed on my machine, which is perhaps good (I don't have any problem with gd, fontconfig, etc.) but perhaps not (there is a small issue with matplotlib).

For me, I need chsorger's fix for scipy, and I have a new spkg ready â€“ see the ticket description for the URL and see the attachments for the difference between the old spkg and the new one. There also seems to be a slightly different, but similar, fix in an unreleased upstream version: see  http://projects.scipy.org/scipy/ticket/1710.

Also, when matplotlib is being installed, I get a window saying

```
To open "gs," you need to install X11.
Would you like to install X11 now?
```

It turns out that on this machine, `/usr/local/bin/gs` was a link to `/usr/local/bin/gs-X11`, and changing the link to point to `/usr/local/bin/gs-noX11` fixed the problem.

Other than that, everything seems to work, at least on this machine.

Indeed, upgrading to 10.8.2 and XCode 4.5 worked. No need to specify the compiler flag OS_OBJECT_USE_OBJC any more (apparently Apple silently corrected this with the update). Also jhpalmieri's patch for scipy works very well, so no need to specify by hand the accelerator flag later!

I still run into gd complaining about the missing fontconfig/fontconfig.h file. But on my machine I installed Quartz (Apple no longer installs X11 by default) so that this is obviously related to this. On the other hand, I need X11 for programs like surf/surfex I use. I also installed poppler through brew (which in turn installed fontconfig and free type) as I compile texmaker on my own which depends on poppler.

iMac, 10.8.2. Works great.

Here is what I did:

1. install XCode from the App Store
2. install the [XCode command line tools](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9329243/xcode-4-4-command-line-tools)
3. download and extract sage-5.4.rc2.tar
4. switch to $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard directory and delete the scipy package (this step is not needed, I think)
5. download the scipy spkg from #13541 into $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard
6. `caffeinate make`

Notes:

5. I used the spkg from #13541 because it has a positive review and will likely be merged into version 5.5.
6. `caffeinate` prevents the machine from sleeping during the compilation: see [here](http://osxdaily.com/2012/08/03/disable-sleep-mac-caffeinate-command).

Is there anything else that needs to be checked before I set this to positive review?

Two possible ideas, although these could go on new tickets instead: we could always use `caffeinate` on Mountain Lion, with a patch like this to the root repository:

```diff
diff --git a/spkg/install b/spkg/install
--- a/spkg/install
+++ b/spkg/install
@@ -481,10 +481,19 @@ echo "*** ALL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES BEFO

+time $CAFFEINATE $MAKE "$@"
 if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
     echo >&2 "Error building Sage."
     exit 1
```

We could also try to avoid potential issues with gs pointing to gs-X11 by creating a new link, for example with this possible change to the matplotlib spkg:

```diff
diff --git a/spkg-install b/spkg-install
--- a/spkg-install

+    DARWIN_VERSION=`uname -r | cut '-d.' -f1`

+    GSNOX11=`command -v gs-noX11`
+    if [ $DARWIN_VERSION -eq 12 ] && [ `readlink "$GS"` = "gs-X11" ] && [ -x "$GSNOX11" ]; then
+       ln -s "$GSNOX11" "$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin/gs
+    fi
+fi
+
 # Write a configuration file to src/setup.cfg
 python make-setup-config.py
 
```

I'm not sure about this second idea, though, because the user might actually have X11 installed, so we would want a more sophisticated check. The linbox configure script also calls gs, so we would need a similar change there.

I'd also check that the package/patches continues to build on usual systems (say, Debian Linux).
Or you can just give it positive review as it is, assuming that the author was careful to check this.

I'm giving it a positive review. I suppose it's better to open a separate ticket on the `caffeinate` issue. (I'm not doing it, as I don't have OSX 10.8 machine available, sorry.)
