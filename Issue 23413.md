Untested for now.

Instead of adding

```diff
@@ -887,6 +887,8 @@ class Posets(object):
         except when `i + n = j`. The poset `P` is the so-called
         *standard example* of a poset with dimension `n`.
 
+        For more information see [Gar2015]_ or [Ros1999]_.
+
         INPUT:
 
         - ``n`` -- an integer `\ge 2`, dimension of the constructed poset
```

I think it is better to just have

```
REFERENCES:

- [Gar2015]_
- [Ros1999]_
```

Otherwise LGTM.

Well, why not. Done that.

(Actually a reference to 272 pages long book is not very good...)
