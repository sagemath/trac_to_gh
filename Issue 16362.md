At #10358, the function to install the database was updated to


```
def install(self, oeis_url="http://oeis.org/stripped.gz", names_url="http://oeis.org/names.gz", overwrite=False):
...
```


But the docstring still gives outdated defaults:


```
        INPUT:

        - ``oeis_url`` - string (default: "http://www.research.att.com...")
        ...

        - ``names_url`` - string (default: "http://www.research.att.com...")
        ...
```


So these urls should be corrected.  This problem was noted on this [ask.sagemath answer](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/23121/how-do-i-use-sloanes-encyclopedia-on-sage-math-cloud/?answer=23148#post-id-23148)
