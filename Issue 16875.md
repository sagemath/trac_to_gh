# Issue 16875: Reorganize developer's manual table of contents

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17112

I think the developer's manual table of contents is layed out in a confusing way: stuff about git is spread out in various places and the "Walk-Through and First Steps" section actually assumes familiarity with git and Trac.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Thanks, I had been thinking about this but didn't feel confident enough in my git to say this 'officially'.

Positive review, other than the little comment you changed about C stuff, but I'll assume that's correct.
