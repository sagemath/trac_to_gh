We need to support running both sagenb and ipynb notebooks.  Moreover, we need to support exporting sagenb to ipynb to ease the transition.  Auto-detection of existing sagenb notebooks and smartly offering to upgrade would be nice as well.

Here's a first pass.  I haven't tested the export functionality, which requires #19877.  Other than that the ability to choose which notebook to use is there and should work correctly.

Is this branch red due to #20119?  See also #20189.

I rebased on develop.  The conflict was actually with #20164.

I removed the dependency on #19877, since there wasn't a good reason for it to be there.  I opened #20316 to add it back.
