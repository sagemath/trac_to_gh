Keywords: jupyter can't connect

Sorry, cannot find where to report isse with sage-9.3 (rc4).

I just installed Sage 9.3 app under macOS Big Sur (11.3.1) on Intel iMac.  From SageMath-9-3.app I can run sage command-line in Terminal.

But I cannot seem to be able to use Sage from jupyter. I try to pen SageMath-9.3.app and choose "Jupyter notebook from folder" option, then Launch. I get error "Safari Can't Connect to the Server ... can't open the page 'localhost:8888/tree?token=......' because Safari can't connect to the server 'localhost'".

```

Further info: To start jupyter notebook, I have to start a conda environment in Terminal, then give command "jupyter notebook", which opens a jupyter notebook in Safari.

When the jupyter .ipynb notebook is open in Safari, it shows "Sage 9.3" as the kernel but I immediately see a Kernel error, which persists even if I try to restart the kernel or reconnect to it.

Part of the problem _might_ be that the python being accessed is from the anaconda3 distribution, since I need that to even use the conda environment in Terminal in order to launch jupyter notebook.

The "Unhandled error" for the kernel ends with:


```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/var/tmp/sage-9.3.rc2-current/local/bin/sage'
```


The complete text of the error message is attached.

Note that I can run, for example, a Julia 1.6.1 kernel from a jupyter notebook.
