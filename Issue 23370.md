# Issue 23370: Matrix.__str__: always show the entries

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23607

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2017-08-09 19:38:14

Currently, the `repr()` of a big matrix is this:

```
sage: random_matrix(ZZ, 100)
100 x 100 dense matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
```

That's useful for interactive sessions to avoid clutter. In non-interactive sessions, that's mostly useless information. I am thinking of scripts which `print()` or `write()` a matrix to a file.

To fix this, I suggest to keep `repr()` as-is but to change `str()` to always show the entries.

The latest patchbot run shows test failures in `combinat/matrices/hadamard_matrix.py`. Once fixed, LGTM.
