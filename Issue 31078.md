# Issue 31078: sage.numerical.backends: GenericBackend doctests failure in remove_constraints

Although the doctests in `generic_backend` are purely decoration (disabled using `optional - Nonexistent_LP_solver`), they provide template for copy paste to other backends. The following doctest from the method `GenericBackend.remove_constraints` fails, because the backend `p` does not have the methods `new_variable` and `add_constraints`. (These are methods of `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`.)

```
sage: from sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend import get_solver
sage: p = get_solver(solver = "Nonexistent_LP_solver")  # optional - Nonexistent_LP_solver
sage: p.add_constraint(p[0] + p[1], max = 10)           # optional - Nonexistent_LP_solver
sage: p.remove_constraints([0])                         # optional - Nonexistent_LP_solver
```

Notice that ``@`classmethod _test_remove_constraint` and `_test_remove_constraints` are missing. They should be added to `generic_backend_test.py` in #31103 later.

Are there copies of this test template in the backends that are correct?

This method is not defined in most backends. Only `glpk_backend.pyx` has it. The test there is correct, but it uses `p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(...)` instead.
