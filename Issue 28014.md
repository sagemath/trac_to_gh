A method `to_order_ideal()` should really return an order ideal, and not a plot of an order ideal (at least by default).

I would make the method arguments `to_order_ideal(plot=False, **plot_options)` . With the double asterisk, you get a dictionary that will have keys like 'down_color' and values whatever the user sets. In order to set it to the default values if the user doesn't specify those keywords, you'd do something like:

`size = plot_options.get('size', None)`

Then size will be set to whatever the user picks if they included a `size=` keyword argument, and defaults to None otherwise (using None as default instead of -1 seems more standard).
