I'm not sure to what extent the following behavior is deliberate or simply unavoidable, so maybe this bug report should be reclassified as bad documentation.  Also, I'm not sure whether I should be filing several different bug reports (but I do believe the issues I raise are very closely related).

My main issue is that for mathematicians who are used to thinking of the weight lattice of a root system living inside of the root lattice, itself living inside some common euclidean ambient space (which, I think, is standard practice), Sage's behavior is mind-boggingly confusing, if not outright insane.

Exhibit A (shows that elements of the root lattice and its ambient space, while comparing for equality, behave very differently when it comes to scalar product):


```
sage: rt = RootSystem(['E',8])
sage: lat = rt.root_lattice()
sage: spc = rt.ambient_space()
sage: lat.simple_root(1) == spc.simple_root(1)
True
sage: lat.simple_coroot(2) == spc.simple_coroot(2)
True
sage: lat.simple_root(1).scalar(lat.simple_coroot(2))
0
sage: spc.simple_root(1).scalar(spc.simple_coroot(2))
0
sage: spc.simple_root(1).scalar(lat.simple_coroot(2))
-1/2
sage: lat.simple_root(1).scalar(spc.simple_coroot(2))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-9-61492d33e12b> in <module>()
----> 1 lat.simple_root(Integer(1)).scalar(spc.simple_coroot(Integer(2)))

/work/sage-5.12/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/root_system/root_space.pyc in scalar(self, lambdacheck)
    245         # Find some better test
    246         if not (lambdacheck in self.parent().coroot_lattice() or lambdacheck in self.parent().coroot_space()):
--> 247             raise TypeError, "%s is not in a coroot lattice/space"%(lambdacheck)
    248         zero = self.parent().base_ring().zero()
    249         cartan_matrix = self.parent().dynkin_diagram()

TypeError: (1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) is not in a coroot lattice/space
```


Exhibit B (shows that Sage does not consider the root lattice as living inside the weight lattice):


```
sage: rt = RootSystem(['E',8])
sage: wlat = rt.weight_lattice()
sage: lat = rt.root_lattice()
sage: wlat.simple_root(1) == lat.simple_root(1)
True
sage: lat.simple_root(1) in lat
True
sage: wlat.simple_root(1) in lat
False
```


Exhibit C (shows how confusing the embedding of the weight lattice in the ambient space is):


```
sage: rt = RootSystem(['A',2])
sage: wlat = rt.weight_lattice()
sage: lat = rt.root_lattice()
sage: spc = rt.ambient_space()
sage: lat.simple_root(2) == wlat.simple_root(2)
True
sage: spc.simple_root(2)
(0, 1, -1)
sage: spc(lat.simple_root(2))
(0, 1, -1)
sage: spc(wlat.simple_root(2))
(1, 2, 0)
```


I'm not sure how all of this should be fixed, but certainly when x==y returns True then x and y should have a very similar behavior, and in particular x in y.parent() should also return True.

Nicolas can probably do a better job at explaining the math design choices, but hopefully this won't be too far off the mark.

For C, this is "correct" and is due to the projection used, i.e. `(1,1,1) = (0,0,0)`. I am slightly of the opinion that we need to standardize input when doing things like scalar products (maybe making the last coordinate 0, especially for equality checking). Some things are just easier in a larger space (such as the definition on a root).

For A, my knowledge of E<sub>8</sub> is somewhat limited. I'd expect the `TypeError` since there is no coercion occurring (perhaps there should be), so it's trying to do things in the base object. Here that's the root lattice. I do think that the scalar should be consistent between the root lattice and the ambient space.

For B, this does not surprise me (too much), again because it's trying to do things in the root lattice and that is a sublattice of the weight lattice. In general, I don't think one cannot take something from the weight lattice and express it in the root lattice.
