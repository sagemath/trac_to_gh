# Issue 18442: Deprecation of `maximization` within NormalFormGame

This ticket would be for the deprecation of the `maximization` parameter within the `NormalFormGame` class which is used be various functions when computing the Nash equilibrium. Some of the reasons include:

1. Finding a Nash with `maximization=False` is equivalent to solving an instance with negative payoffs. So in the two player instance, one might as well create an instance of (-A, -B) that way, creating the same instances over and over when you want to compute equilibria using different algorithms.
2. Technically, the game being represented isn't the game being solved. As a result, any further manipulations or computations which would need to be done on that instance, we would have to create the bimatrix (-A, -B) again.
3. For n-players, this gets a little bit messier, as we would have to enumerate the exponentially large number of payoffs in the game so as to negate all of them.

Just wondered why this ticket depends on 18536? Otherwise I'm happy to start reviewing it.

I had two main options: branch off from #18536 and deprecate it in all functions including the LP solvers; and the second was to deprecate both within this ticket and #18536. I chose the first as it places the deprecation in one ticket.

Actually, come to think of it, I could have just deprecated within this ticket and removed maximization from the LP solvers completely.

You could probably still do that... You could comment on #18536 to check if Karl has started reviewing and if not set it back to 'needs work'...

I won't be looking at any of this today, anyway.

There are some changes which were made in the #18536 ticket which would have caused a few merge conflicts. So in order to avoid that, I think it's best to stick with the current setting.

Which order should these tickets be reviewed in, if any?


---

#18536 should be reviewed first.

The branch no longer merges with current sage releases.
