`sage_setup.docbuild` has very different dependencies:

It depends on `sagelib` and `sphinx`, 
whereas the rest of `sage_setup` is for building `sagelib`.

We split it out.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30010

- Also, I don't understand the "tarball" aspects of this. There is no tarball, is there? So why have `spkg-src`?

- Is it built in `build/pkgs/sage_setup_docbuild/src/`? After building, I see new directories `build` and `sage_setup.docbuild.egg-info` there.

- The installation log file says `package init file 'sage_setup/__init__.py' not found (or not a regular file)`. I assume this is not a big issue, since everything worked after installation.

> - Also, I don't understand the "tarball" aspects of this. There is no tarball, is there? So why have `spkg-src`?

The spkg-src script can build a tarball for the purpose of uploading a source distribution to PyPI.

> - Is it built in `build/pkgs/sage_setup_docbuild/src/`? After building, I see new directories `build` and `sage_setup.docbuild.egg-info` there.

That's right. 

I should probably add a `sage_setup_docbuild-clean` target that deletes them.

> - The installation log file says `package init file 'sage_setup/__init__.py' not found (or not a regular file)`. I assume this is not a big issue, since everything worked after installation.

This is not an error. `sage_setup` is now a native namespace package - these do not have `__init__.py` files.
