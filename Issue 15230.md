Doesn't break anything and fixes some bugs, so positive review.

I've bumped the version number to 6 since the commits come from git.

Just out of curiosity, would it be okay for me to add an enhancement ticket asking that we could eventually add the ability to combine (say) `parts_in` with other options?  That would have been useful for me in a class tomorrow, but maybe there is no need.  Or maybe such a ticket already exists!

I do not know if such a ticket exists. I do not believe that it takes more than a couple of hours to write this feature (in Python), however.
