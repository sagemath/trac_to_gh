Just out of curiosity, would it be okay for me to add an enhancement ticket asking that we could eventually add the ability to combine (say) `parts_in` with other options?  That would have been useful for me in a class tomorrow, but maybe there is no need.  Or maybe such a ticket already exists!

I do not know if such a ticket exists. I do not believe that it takes more than a couple of hours to write this feature (in Python), however.
