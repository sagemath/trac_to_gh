New trac user here.  I have implemented the super RSK algorithm (as described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00420v1.pdf).  I would like to contribute it to sage.

I would first like to talk about where the code should be organizationally.  There is already a `combinat/tableau.py` containing the Tableau object which has a traditional RSK bump method.  There is also a `combinat/rsk.py` module with the complete RSK algorithm and 1-2 variants.

The interesting thing is that the `rsk` module does not actually use the bump method from the `tableau` module, but rather re-implements it.  I believe this should be changed (to eliminate redundancy).  Also, actual Tableau objects are not used in the algorithm, but rather a list of lists (until the very end, when they are converted to Tableau).  I believe this also should be changed.

So my *proposal* for organization is to make these changes, and then add my own super_rsk_bump method to the Tableau object, and then add my own super rsk insertion option to the `rsk` module, which would run the super rsk algorithm and call the super_rsk_bump method on the Tableau as needed.

The code I have *currently* does *not* follow the above proposal because I wrote it before discovering the `tableau` module.  But before I waste time reorganizing everything, I wanted to get your input.  I will include the code I have now as an attachment, even though it is unfinished.  It is a modification of the `rsk` module.

The super RSK doesn't use integers as tableau entries but rather an alphabet where some numbers have carat symbols over them and some numbers do not.  You can see that I implemented this alphabet with a linear ordering as the class Letter.  I'm wondering if this alphabet might already exist elsewhere on sage, so I don't make redundant code.  Also, I'm wondering where I should put this class, since it doesn't seem to belong in the rsk module.  Probably in its own dedicated file?

Thank you for your input.  I will strive to follow your recommendations thoroughly.

Welcome to Sage.

+1 for adding this. I saw the paper and have wanted to compare it with the bumping procedure of Benkart-Kang-Kashiwara (https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9810092, Sec. 4.5), of which the author seems to be unaware (actually, I probably should e-mail him and ask...). I'm cc-ing a bunch of people who might be interested in this ticket.

IMO, this should go in the `rsk` module as it is an RSK(-type) variant. I believe the letters are the same as what was recently done for the shifted tableaux (#22921), so you probably could use those.

> The interesting thing is that the `rsk` module does not actually use the bump method from the tableau module, but rather re-implements it. I believe this should be changed (to eliminate redundancy).


-1 the code within the `rsk` is **much** faster than using the `Tableau.bump()` (no intermediate objects in particular).

> Also, actual Tableau objects are not used in the algorithm, but rather a list of lists (until the very end, when they are converted to Tableau). I believe this also should be changed. 


-1 lists (of lists) are ~~easier to~~ meant to be manipulated.

Now while I understand why you want to break things into these localized functions, but you are passing far too much data around to do so. Also, my quick impression is that it is actually making the code more complicated because you are forcing yourself to work in either a row or column format.  In particular, you are not using your data structure efficiently nor taking advantage of the semistandardness by pulling out columns into a list. It might be time to have each of the bumping rules be implemented as classes, but I think we should refactor this code first and see what we get before doing that level of work.

Welcome to Sage!

Martin Rubey has recently implemented an insertion related to this in #23896. It is also planned to generalize this to the semistandard insertions #24659. He uses growth diagrams. 

In the code for shifted tableau, Kirill internally allowed entries 3.5 etc for primed entries. Perhaps something similar would work for you?

I think you should consider adding a class for super tableaux. That way you could start with a tableau and do a (series of) insertion(s) in a natural way and so the output has a clear object type. It will also make it much easier for performing the inverse as the `inverse_RSK` will know from the type of the input that it should do sRSK.

I am not sure where you're reading. There is a dedicated letter class `class PrimedEntry(SageObject)`. The tableau class has to (pre)process its input into these letters, but that is a necessary condition. Moreover, #22921 has been merged into Sage and is available in the latest beta. Since there is another use for this alphabet, +1 on extracting that part and the necessary other components into a dedicated module.

+1 on this. Just return some tableau objects.

Replying to [comment:5 tscrim]:

Please see my commit.  I left the original RSK algo unaltered (but I moved it into _RSK), even though my algo generalizes it so we could just as easily run my algo (_sRSK) only.

You can see I moved all my code pertaining to Letters, BiLetters, and BiWords into a separate file called alphabet.py (I will rename it appropriately soon).  I guess this is the major stuff that needs to change now, because as you said there is already a `PrimedEntry(SageObject)` class that is related.  As well as the related `ShiftedPrimedTableau` class from #22921.

I will deal with making a SuperTableau class after dealing with the Primed stuff.

NEW PROBLEM:

I don't know how to run the test runner on my code.  I am within the git repo on my branch, and I run `sage -t rsk.py`, and this results in the error '_is_horizontal() is not defined' even though it is.  I think this has to do with the fact that I haven't successfully run `make` to build my official-git-repo version of sage, even though I have sage installed elsewhere on my computer.

If I copy and paste my code (from both this file and the alphabet.py file into a single file `myrsk.py` elsewhere on my computer) and then run `sage -t myrsk.py` on THAT, I not only get past the error but with a few minor tweaks I get all tests passing.

The `PrimedEntry` class does indeed serve the same purpose as the `Letter` class I had before, so I will be using the PrimedEntry class.

I need to make a `SemistandardPrimedTableau` which is just a semistandard tableau whose entries are primed instead of integers.  To achieve this, I will make a class called `GeneralizedSemistandardTableau` which is just like SemistandardTableau but does not require the entries to be integers.  Then SemistandardTableau will become a subclass of the generalized class with the only alteration being the enforcement of integers, and likewise SemistandardPrimedTableau will be a subclass of the generalized class with the only alteration being the enforcement of primed entries.

I have no idea when this `__classcall_private__` method runs or why it exists, but here is what the `SemistandardTableau` class will look like as a subclass of `GeneralizedSemistandardTableau`:

```div style="font-size: 100%"

    @staticmethod
    def __classcall_private__(self, t):
        super(SemistandardTableau, self).__classcall_private__(self, t)

        # Check entried are integers
        if not all(isinstance(c,(int,Integer)) for row in t for c in row):
            raise ValueError("entries must be integers"%t)

    def __init__(self, parent, t):
        super(SemistandardTableau, self).__init__(parent, t)

        # Check the entries of t are positive integers
        from sage.sets.positive_integers import PositiveIntegers
        PI = PositiveIntegers()
        for row in t:

I have added a doctest for the inverse map, which is currently failing on a semistandard tableaux:

```
sage -t --warn-long src/sage/combinat/rsk.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/combinat/rsk.py", line 1984, in sage.combinat.rsk.RuleSuperRSK
Failed example:
    RSK_inverse(P, Q, insertion=RSK.rules.superRSK)
Expected:
    [[1', 1, 2', 2, 3', 3', 3', 3], [3, 2', 3, 2, 3', 3', 1', 2]]
Got:
    [[1', 1, 2', 2, 3', 3', 3], [3, 2', 3, 2, 3', 1', 2]]
```
There is a missing `[3', 3']` pair, so there is definitely a bug somewhere.

Also, I have added a few more doctests and done a little cleanup. I will do further review once the bug is fixed.

I have fixed it, it was because in superRSK the recording tableau columns can have repeated elements since we make upper row entries primed in case of column insertion.
