I give it a positive review, too, but if you want to change the lines

```
    - ``seq`` -- Two different possible types: 
      - A sequence of pairs (weight, value). 
      - A sequence of reals (a value of 1 is assumed). 
```

by adding a blank line after the first one, it looks a little better (to me) when typeset.  I'll give that a positive review in advance, so if you want to make the change, no need for more review.
