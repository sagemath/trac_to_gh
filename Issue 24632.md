Keywords: matrices


```
sage: A = Zp(2)
sage: I = matrix(2,2, [A(1,10), A(0,10), A(0,10), A(1,10)])
sage: I
[1 + O(2^10)     O(2^10)]
[    O(2^10) 1 + O(2^10)]
sage: ~I
[1 + O(2^10)           0]
[          0 1 + O(2^10)]
```


The non-diagonal entries of `I^(-1)` should not be exact zeros.

Changing keywords from "matrices" to "matrices, padicIMA".

We should use Smith form rather than row echelon form, since it's more stable.

This issue seems to be fixed after ticket #23486.
