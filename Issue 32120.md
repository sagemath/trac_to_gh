Keywords: gsoc2021 modular forms derivative

In #32343 the Serre derivative for `ModularFormElement` was implemented. This ticket implements similar feature but for the classes `GradedModularFormElement` and `QuasiModularFormsElement`. Moreover, this ticket aims to implement the derivative *q * df/dq* of a graded modular form and a quasiform using the Serre derivative.

This ticket is part of #31560

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32357
