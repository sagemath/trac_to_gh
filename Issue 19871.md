Indeed, looking at the setup.py, the only files that are installed using the `data_files` option are going into the selected site-packages (typically under `SAGE_LOCAL`, but in principle the appropriate site-packages for any Python that is used to run `setup.py).

This being the case it should be using `package_data` instead.

It's a file used by some Cython `.pxd` files. So yes it should be installed.

Of course, ideally this file shouldn't even exist in the first place: it mostly contains stuff to work around Cython limitations which are no longer relevant. Me and Jean-Pierre Flori already did some work to reduce the usage of `ntlwrap.cpp`, but we're not there yet.

I guess you can deduce from my comments that I don't always agree with those "current practices". It seems that, in many cases, they introduce more problems than they solve. And I really don't like arguments of the form "you should do X because everybody does X".
