A lot of people still seem to be missing the fact that you can do this, probably because the developer docs still say that manually requesting an account is the only way to use the Trac site.

The fact that it can't be used with `git trac` is unfortunate--this is simply due to the fact that the `git trac` plugin uses a user's Trac username and password to authenticate, and when using GitHub login they have no "password".

In the future I might fix this by extending the git-trac plugin to provide generated passwords/authentication tokens for this purpose.

FWIW this has been done, but https://github.com/sagemath/git-trac-command/pull/31 needs to be merged.
