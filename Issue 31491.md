The example `manifolds.Sphere` defines a method `minimal_triangulation`, which returns a simplicial sphere (the boundary of the (n+1)-simplex) as an abstract simplicial complex.

We propose to make the relationship between the two objects more concrete by introducing intermediate objects and maps as follows.

Define a geometric realization of the simplicial complex 
as the polyhedral complex that is the boundary of a geometric (n+1)-simplex (or of any full-dimensional polyhedron).

Define the `face_manifold_poset` (#31660) of the polyhedron. The poset elements are images of embedded submanifolds (and subsets) of the Euclidean space.

Let c be a point in the interior of the polyhedron.

Define the differentiable map sending E<sup>n+1</sup> \ c to E<sup>n+1</sup> \ 0, defined in Cartesian coordinates as x ‚üº (x-c)/|x-c|.
It pulls back to differentiable maps on the embedded submanifolds, defining differentiable embeddings into the sphere;
and to a continuous map on their union, 
defining a continuous embedding into the sphere.
