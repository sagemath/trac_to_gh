Keywords: py3, graph

Some doctests added in #27518 are failing in py3 due to: ordering issue when displaying a dictionary, and the fact that the solution to a problem was not unique (several shortests path in a grid between (0,0) and (1,1) for instance).

We change the failing doctests to more robust one.
