Hi there,

Some quick comments (I am not the person designed to review the mathematics in there):
- the patch does not apply on sage-5.13.beta2
- there are many trailing whitescaces that need to be removed
- the indentation must be 4 spaces wide (it is 3 in many places)
- sage convention is that `CamelCaseConvention` is somewhat reserved to classes and it would be better to not use it as variables names (I think this is too much pain to change it right now)
- in the examples one should use "a = bla()" instead of "a=bla()"

We also discussed a very specific issue in the code (line 2588 to 2601). The [attachment:trac_14219-optimize_root_order_computation.patch] proposes a much direct version with, as a consequence, a little bit of speedup.

The change for the eigenvalue computation looks fine, I've folded that into the main patch.

I removed the whitespace and added the spaces around the = signs.

I also adjusted the variable naming as that wasn't too tedious.

I couldn't find any 3 space indents, could you point out where those are.

To be modified in projective_morphism.py

1) trailing whitespaces in at lines 1663, 1754, 1954, 1971, 1982, 1985, 1992, 1998, 2085, 2106, 2158, 2169, 2221, 2257, 2273, 2317, 2352,

2) why do you use Hom(P,P) instead of End(P) ?

3) problem of upper case/lower case at line 1746 (Periods instead of periods)

4) prefer (line 1743-1746)

```
return sorted(periods)
```

instead of

```
periods=list(periods)
periods.sort()
return(periods)
```


5) in method dynatomic_polynomial the argument is called period but is refered in the documentation as n. Moreover the specification of arguments are given too late. In the examples it might be good to check that the dynatomic polynomial actually gives you solution!

```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
sage: H = Hom(P,P)
sage: f = H([x^2+y^2,y^2])
sage: f.dynatomic_polynomial(2)
x^2 + x*y + 2*y^2
sage: K.<c> = NumberField(X^2 + X + 2, 'c')
sage: PP = P.change_ring(K)
sage: ff = f.change_ring(K)
sage: p = PP((c,1))
sage: ff(ff(p)) == p
```

Here I get troubles with coercions (this is why I defined PP and ff): there should be some canonical coercions as there is for polynomials (this will go in another ticket)

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x')
sage: K.<c> = NumberField(x^2 + 3*x + 1, 'c')
sage: P = x^6 + 3*x + 19
sage: P(c)
-141*c - 36
```


6) The rational for the choice of putting methods in projective_point.py instead in projective_morphism.py is not at all clear to me. Why orbit, canonical_heights, etc methods of points and not of morphisms ?

Here are a few more comments:

1) Please remove debugging code from lines 1865-1968.

2) It would be helpful to have some more comments to the code for the Henzel lifting to make it easier to read.

3) Use is_endomorphism() where possible. Lines 2044, 2138, and 2199.

4) I think it would be clearer if the rational_preimages and all_rational_preimages were written in that order. That is the reverse of how they appear now.

5) Line 2145 the set 'preperiodic' as the name is misleading. Maybe 'all_preimages' would be better?

6) More comments on the Groebner basis code would be nice.

7) You should consider caching the functions rational_preperiodic_points and rational_periodic_points.

Multiplier check added for the (2)-previous comment. I added a parameter to specify whether to do this or not as this function is called many times for `rational_periodic` and it would be better not to check if you known the input is good.

1,2,3,4,5,6 all done

7) Not possible since the points are rational projective points and they are not hashable (only hashable over finite fields)

I also changed the mrange to xmrange in `lift_to_rational` to help improve the higher dimension performance.
