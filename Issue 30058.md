The Maclaurin series for trigonometric functions are implemented in the `PowerSeriesRing`:


```
sage: x = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, 'x').gen()
sage: sin(x)
x - 1/6*x^3 + 1/120*x^5 - 1/5040*x^7 + 1/362880*x^9 - 1/39916800*x^11 + 1/6227020800*x^13 - 1/1307674368000*x^15 + 1/355687428096000*x^17 - 1/121645100408832000*x^19 + O(x^20)
sage: cos(x)
1 - 1/2*x^2 + 1/24*x^4 - 1/720*x^6 + 1/40320*x^8 - 1/3628800*x^10 + 1/479001600*x^12 - 1/87178291200*x^14 + 1/20922789888000*x^16 - 1/6402373705728000*x^18 + O(x^20)
sage: tan(x)
x + 1/3*x^3 + 2/15*x^5 + 17/315*x^7 + 62/2835*x^9 + 1382/155925*x^11 + 21844/6081075*x^13 + 929569/638512875*x^15 + 6404582/10854718875*x^17 + 443861162/1856156927625*x^19 + O(x^20)
```


However, the hyperbolic functions are not:


```
sage: sinh(x)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: cannot coerce arguments: no canonical coercion from Power Series Ring in x over Rational Field to Symbolic Ring
```


We will add the hyperbolic functions `sinh`, `cosh` and `tanh` to the `PowerSeriesRing`.

Do you know who is in "charge" for the algebra stuff, i.e. who wants to be cc-ed on these tickets?
