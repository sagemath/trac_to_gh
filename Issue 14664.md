short_vector_list_up_to_length uses Pari's qfminim to find short vectors.  However, it does not use the full functionality of qfminim, in particular the ability to find short vectors for a non-integral quadratic form.

Once the change suggested in [http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14867](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14867) has been applied, qfminim could be usable for non-integral quadratic forms - this would be useful to me.

Currently, `short_vector_list_up_to_length` returns a list `L` such that `L[i]` is a _list_ of vectors of length `i`. Clearly, we can no longer do this with non-integral quadratic forms. What do you propose we do in that case? Add a flag to return simply a list instead of a list of lists?
