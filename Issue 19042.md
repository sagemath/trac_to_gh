it is a definition that is unnecessarily restrictive, and actually contradicts with what wikipedia defines as a polar space. Saying that a GQ is a polar space (and it is saying it) in wikipedia sense will disallow t=1 or s=1.

well, in a comment in the code you say that the girth must be at least 7; but you never ever get 7 or any odd number...

what in wikipedia is called GQ is called **regular** GQ in some other sources. They are also called GQs admitting parameters...

this is not so easy, even if one does not mess with polar spaces...

There several streams to cover for GQs; in addition to already mentioned,
there is a stream where GQs without a restriction on s,t are called weak GQs, 
see e.g. http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-0348-0271-0

you might want to check out the definition (7.4.1 p.323) of polar space here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B92yb82dH00zM1lNc1Y1eGVHZDQ/view?usp=sharing

A line space (P,L) is a polar space if, for each point p ∈ P and
each line l ∈ L, the set of points of l which are collinear with p, is either a singleton
or l.



They keep on mentioning GQs immediately after this definition, in Example 7.4.2:

Each projective space is a polar space in which, for each point p
and each line l, the set of points of l collinear with p, coincides with l. At the other
extreme, a generalized quadrangle is a polar space in which, for each point p and
each line l not on p, the set of points of l collinear with p, is a singleton.

> What the hell is this `c_j(x,y)`. Number of shortest paths? `:-/`

for x, y at distance j+1, it is number of neighbours of y in diameter j neighbourhood of x.

E.g. mu in SRG is c_2.

It is one of parameters of a distance-regular graph, no wonder it's used freely in [BCN]_

It seems that one should also say that there is at most one line on any 2 points. (Cause a general incidence system does not assume this).

I'll be mostly offline in the coming 36 hours - weekend...

This commit does what you requested. Observe that while the branch is not merged with #19226, the latter appears as a dependency of this ticket: this ensures that Volker will merge #19226 *first*, and so that the reference will be defined when he tests the patch.

Please do not merge again my branches with yours (until you learn to produce a readable history). Merging anything with your branches makes it impossible to review correctly.
