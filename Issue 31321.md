```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: L = K.extension(x^2 - 6*x - 4, 'a1')
sage: eigval = L.gen()
sage: eigval_conj = eigval.galois_conjugates(QQbar)
sage: f0 = hom(eigval.parent(), QQbar, eigval_conj[0])
sage: f1 = hom(eigval.parent(), QQbar, eigval_conj[1])
sage: f0(i)  # wrong embedding!!
0.?e-54 - 1.000000000000000?*I
sage: f1(i)  # wrong embedding!!
0.?e-54 - 1.000000000000000?*I

Let us try to make it to 9.3 since this is a bug with a mostly trivial fix.
