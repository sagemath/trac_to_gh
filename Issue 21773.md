# Issue 21773: Doctest continuation marker / schemes, categories, libs

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22010

Original creator: jmantysalo

Every grepping of source code is easier if there is just one way to do something. Also some user might wonder if there is a difference between `...` and `....:`. Hence I suggest mass change from old-style doctest continuation lines.

This part does that in three folders.

Done by


```
find src/sage/schemes src/sage/categories src/sage/libs -name '*.py' -or -name '*.pyx' |
xargs perl -e 's|^( *)\.\.\.  |\1....:|g;' -p -i.bak
```

Remove the lines with `...` immediately after `....:`. I believe there are 2 such lines in these folders from looking at the diff.
