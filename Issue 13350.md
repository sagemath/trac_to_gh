# Issue 13350: Documentation of random_matrix insists zero is never used, when it is.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13554

Original creator: JoalHeagney

Original creation time: 2012-10-01 02:59:08

Assignee: mvngu

Keywords: matrix, matrices, random_matrix, documentation

In the documentation for random_matrix http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/matrix/constructor.html#sage.matrix.constructor.random_matrix, it states in several locations that for several methods, entries are __never zero__. The examples themselves show plenty of zero entries.

This would have some overlap with #11968.  Maybe one or the other should be closed as a duplicate with a pointer to whichever one is kept.

You can't.  And are not suppose to.  The release manager will.  ;-)

See process/suggestion in last comment on #6003.
