# Issue 26420: Adapt unitary burau matrix to Sage convention

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26657

Original creator: soehms

Original creation time: 2018-11-06 22:01:17

CC:  tscrim

Keywords: braid, burau, unitary

The unitary Burau matrix has been implemented in #25760. The choice between the two adjoined possibilities has been made according to the used literature ([Squ1984]_).

Unfortunately, this is opposite to the convention used in Sage for example in :meth:`_check_matrix` of :class:`UnitaryMatrixGroup_generic`.

This discrepancy is corrected by the ticket. A deprecation of the former behavior doesn't seem to be necessary, since the new functionality has been released just a couple of months ago.

One little fix needed: `:trac:`25760` -> `:trac:`25760``. Once done, you can set to a positive review.

No Problem! 

Thank you, Travis! I will be waiting for the patchbot to see if I got rid of that merge error.
