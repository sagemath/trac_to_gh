One missed trailing `...`:

```diff

         sage: s1 = []; s2 = []
         sage: for v in y_out:

-        ...       F2 = v[:-len(F)].autoregressive_fit(len(F))
-        ...       s2.append(sum([(v[:-i].autoregressive_forecast(F2)-v[-i])^2 for i in range(1,20)]))
+        ....:     s1.append(sum([(v[:-i].autoregressive_forecast(F)-v[-i])^2 for i in range(1,20)]))

+        ....:     s2.append(sum([(v[:-i].autoregressive_forecast(F2)-v[-i])^2 for i in range(1,20)]))
         ...
 
     We find that overall the model beats naive linear forecasting by 35
```

Otherwise LGTM.
