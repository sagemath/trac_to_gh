`sage.misc.package` tests the installed version of `ppl`, but this fails if the system version of `ppl` is being used.

Also fix some other doctests in that file that depend on ordering of dictionaries, and possibly on packages which we may not install in the future.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29591
