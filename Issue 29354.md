# Issue 29354: Don't test whether ppl is an installed package

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29591

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2020-04-26 16:38:16

`sage.misc.package` tests the installed version of `ppl`, but this fails if the system version of `ppl` is being used.

Also fix some other doctests in that file that depend on ordering of dictionaries, and possibly on packages which we may not install in the future.

Thank you. #29042 will need to be rebased, but it wasn't marked "needs review" yet.
