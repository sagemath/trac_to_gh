As analyzed in #33531#comment:9, this is due to pytest running on this temprorary sage file failing with

In other words, pytest doesn't know how to analyze `.sage` files. We fix this by letting pytest know that `.sage` files are essentially normal python files after they run through the preparser (this is accomplished by implementing an importlib.Loader for `.sage` files, which is then used by pytest).

see #27074

Thanks for the pointer. The code of this ticket could indeed be helpful for #27074. What would be a good place to put the added importlib loader so that the can easily be reused in #27074?

`@`fbissey How did you manage to keep the temporary `.sage` file that is generated in these doctests?

I went through the steps to produce it manually from a sage session. And then printed its name to have a look at it.

For #27074, the thought was that this should work globally so that users can use it with their local scripts. But last time I was looking into #27074, I came across an old discussion that Python does NOT support this (and wontfix) - installing such a global handler. Sorry, can't find it right now.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Okay thanks, that worked!

Okay, then I would propose to keep the changes localized in conftest and if someone is working on  #27074 it can be easily extracted.

This actually looks very nice and perhaps the classes `SageSourceFinder`, `SageSourceLoader` could find a place somewhere in `sage.repl`? (Modularization context: #29941)

The actual activation (`sys.meta_path.append(SageSourceFinder())`) would stay where it is, in conftest.py

That would also work, but as long as they are only used for pytests I think it would make sense to leave them in conftest.py

No, the idea would be that we would not want to activate it by just loading the Sage library; but we may want to advertise it to sufficiently adventurous users.

Don't you think that goes way beyond the scope of this ticket and would need proper documentation and more testing?

Good point, but note that we don't actually have any `.sage` files in our test suite. 

What you are trying to solve is a failure from testing the behavior of the Sage doctester on user files. And for this the metapath manipulation seems to be an overkill.


---

Comment by @tobiasdiez created at 2022-03-22 22:41:27

What would be an easier solution to register the sage file loader then?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-03-22 22:54:19

Just skipping .sage files because there is no existing practice of having pytest tests in them.


---

Comment by @tobiasdiez created at 2022-03-22 22:57:37

But they can have "normal" doctests and for #33546 supporting this would be needed anyway. In fact, this ticket here is meant as an easy precursor to #33546, testing the grounds for custom test collectors without opening the box of doctest parsing.

Sure, it's fine.
