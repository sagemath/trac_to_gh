As analyzed in #33531#comment:9, this is due to pytest running on this temprorary sage file failing with

In other words, pytest doesn't know how to analyze `.sage` files. We fix this by letting pytest know that `.sage` files are essentially normal python files after they run through the preparser (this is accomplished by implementing an importlib.Loader for `.sage` files, which is then used by pytest).

Thanks for the pointer. The code of this ticket could indeed be helpful for #27074. What would be a good place to put the added importlib loader so that the can easily be reused in #27074?
