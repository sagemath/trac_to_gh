Javier, it looks good that you've taken out the white space in most tuples, especially those with just argument ranges. I think however that the tuples and lists containing functions would read better with a space after commas. Since there are a great many function statements in this file, they stand out more with the white space.

There are also a couple instances near the beginning of the file that have `u_max))``:` on the line after `u_min`. Please move those up to the previous line.

Thanks!

Currently:


```
sage: parametric_plot3d((sin,cos,lambda u: u/10), (0,20))
```


More easily read as:


```
sage: parametric_plot3d((sin, cos, lambda u: u/10), (0,20))
```

Looking good! There are three more instances that need space between functions in the list:

`parametric_plot3d(vector([x-y,x*y,x*cos(y)]), (x,0,2), (y,0,2))`

`sage: parametric_plot3d((sin,cos,lambda u: u/10), (0,20)) # indirect doctest`

`sage: parametric_plot3d((sin(u),cos(u),u/10), (u,0,20))`

I've also noticed something that is not your doing, but would appreciate it if you could fix it. If there is a space or new line between text and a double colon, then the colon doesn't show up in the documentation. Please search for a "space + double colon" after plot names or descriptions and make sure they directly follow with no white space.

For example, `Green bowtie ::` should be `Green bowtie::` and


```
    Dini's spiral

    ::
```


should be `Dini's spiral::`. I think there are only nine occurrences in this file, so if you could fix those it would be great.

I just noticed this behavior in some documentation I did last week. Thanks!

I like how you efficiently broke long lines in this file. Just a bit more nitpicking from me and it'll be done.

For the Star of David, please change `*K` to `* K` on one line. Please also change `**` to `^` on the line above to match other examples.

On the double heart, the long lines you broke in the Sphinx plot need a couple more spaces to align like the example above them.

For the 5-pointed star, please alter the line breaking in the Sphinx plot to match the example above, so that they read as the same equation more easily.

Please revert the changes you made to these two lines:

`G += line3d([(g[0](u, v), g[1](u, v), g[2](u, v)) for v in vrange], **boundary_style)`

`G += line3d([(g[0](u, v), g[1](u, v), g[2](u, v)) for u in urange], **boundary_style)`

I don't think it's a good idea to edit code for a ticket about documentation, but most of the changes you introduced make the code more readable except for these two lines.

And that should to it! Thanks.
