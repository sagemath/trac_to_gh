The output seems to be unstable in Python3, therefore a sorting is introduced. This is kind of cheap as the strings of the keys are determined anyway.

Non-Py3 related.

This seems to be indeed the reason of https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0479/#rationale, although in our case it was used intentional. However, after reading the PEP, the current behavior for `preview_word` can be considered as a bug, so the exception was changed (and other code adapted). Now everthing works out fine.
