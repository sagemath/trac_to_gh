# Issue 10091: export FC, F77, F90 and F95 from scipy_sandbox

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10092

Original creator: drkirkby

Original creation time: 2010-10-06 23:45:05

Assignee: GeorgSWeber

scipy_sandbox is picking up the wrong Fortran compiler (Sun compiler in /usr/bin) and ignoring the contents of the file `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage_fortran` This adds patch exports all 4 of these Fortran related variables, so scipy_sandbox uses the right compiler. 

For reasons unknown, following the update of Numpy (#9808), it 
became necessary to export these Fortran variables on both SciPy and
scipy_sandbox.

I also cleaned up SPKG.txt, as it was very bare.

This is now ready for review. A package can be found at

It all look good to me. Bring it inline with the other packages and cannot possibly interfere with anything else. It's surprising it didn't need this earlier.

Oh no! This needs clean up as per #5903 (removal of debian stuff).


---

Comment by drkirkby created at 2010-10-07 22:18:35

Give me 10 minutes and I'll remove the unneeded stuff.

I've deleted the Debian related files.

The new .spkg is in the same place at

patch looks fine, the spkg looks identical to the previous one. Unless I have a caching problem.

I think you do have a caching problem. I just downloaded it myself with:


```
wget http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/scipy_sandbox-20071020.p6.spkg
```


and it looks fine. The Debian stuff is removed from the .spkg.

Just got it with wget instead of firefox and it looks fine now!
Positive review it is then!

Thank you. I've been caught out with that before too.

I note this failed to build on _fulvia_ the Solaris x86 system. The buildbot log shows it failed


```
sage: An error occurred while installing scipy_sandbox-20071020.p6
```


though I can't see what anything other than the fact it failed. We might need to open a new ticket for this, or revert this change. I can't possibly understand how it can cause a problem on any platform, but it appears to have done on Solaris x86, which is especially strange given I tested this on OpenSolaris x86.

That's indeed very strange. Any chance that we will have access to a build log?
CC me on any ticket you open about this please.

Here's the error message:

```
./spkg-install: FC=/home/buildbot/build/sage/fulvia-1/fulvia_full/build/sage-4.6.alpha3/local/bin/sage_fortran: is not an identifier
```

I think fulvia's `/bin/sh` does not support the compact `export FOO=bar`.  Maybe we should just make `spkg-install` a bash script?

David or Fran√ßois, could one of you please open a 4.6 blocker to fix this?

By the way, adding links to individual spkg logs is already on the Sage Buildbot TODO list.

You beat me to it by 30 seconds. Here is what I had to say

The main buildbot page is here:

http://build.sagemath.org/sage/

The 'Waterfall display' seems the most interesting looking to me:

http://build.sagemath.org/sage/waterfall

 * _fulvia_ is the Solaris x86 machine at Skynet
 * _hawk_ (on far right) is my own personal OpenSolaris machine

I was not initially aware one could get the full log, but it is available. You have to click on the _build stdio_ for the machine. 

http://build.sagemath.org/sage/builders/fulvia%20full/builds/6/steps/shell_1/logs/stdio

The relevant bit is:

I can now see what is wrong:


```
export FC="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F77="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F90="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F95="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
```


is a bashism - using export on the same line. But the spkg-install script starts with:


```/bin/sh
```


The Solaris `/bin/sh` will not accept that syntax. (On OpenSolaris, a newer shell is used, which is why it worked on my machine).  

I've opened #10106 to address this. One could get around it by changing the shell used in the spkg-install, but personally I prefer to write code in a more portable fashion, so I'll change that later today. I've very tired and must get some sleep, so it will have to wait for 8 hours or so, unless someone else wants to beat me to it.

I've updated #10106 to a blocker, but I have not slept yet and it is 5:25 am here!! I need some sleep.

I'll do this now, perhaps someone can review it in 15 minutes or so.

#10106 iss now ready for review - I have check it on fulvia to be sure it worked.

It worked for me.
