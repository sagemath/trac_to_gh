Assignee: GeorgSWeber

scipy_sandbox is picking up the wrong Fortran compiler (Sun compiler in /usr/bin) and ignoring the contents of the file `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage_fortran` This adds patch exports all 4 of these Fortran related variables, so scipy_sandbox uses the right compiler. 

For reasons unknown, following the update of Numpy (#9808), it 
became necessary to export these Fortran variables on both SciPy and
scipy_sandbox.

I also cleaned up SPKG.txt, as it was very bare. 
 

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10092

I think you do have a caching problem. I just downloaded it myself with:


```
wget http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/scipy_sandbox-20071020.p6.spkg
```


and it looks fine. The Debian stuff is removed from the .spkg.

You beat me to it by 30 seconds. Here is what I had to say

The main buildbot page is here:

http://build.sagemath.org/sage/

The 'Waterfall display' seems the most interesting looking to me:

http://build.sagemath.org/sage/waterfall

* *fulvia* is the Solaris x86 machine at Skynet
* *hawk* (on far right) is my own personal OpenSolaris machine

I was not initially aware one could get the full log, but it is available. You have to click on the *build stdio* for the machine. 

http://build.sagemath.org/sage/builders/fulvia%20full/builds/6/steps/shell_1/logs/stdio

The relevant bit is:

I can now see what is wrong:


```
export FC="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F77="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F90="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F95="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
```


is a bashism - using export on the same line. But the spkg-install script starts with:


```/bin/sh
```


The Solaris `/bin/sh` will not accept that syntax. (On OpenSolaris, a newer shell is used, which is why it worked on my machine).  

I've opened #10106 to address this. One could get around it by changing the shell used in the spkg-install, but personally I prefer to write code in a more portable fashion, so I'll change that later today. I've very tired and must get some sleep, so it will have to wait for 8 hours or so, unless someone else wants to beat me to it.

I've updated #10106 to a blocker, but I have not slept yet and it is 5:25 am here!! I need some sleep.

I'll do this now, perhaps someone can review it in 15 minutes or so.
