TIDES (http://gme.unizar.es/software/tides) is a library that allows numerical integration of differential equations with arbitrary precission. It is usually more robust than the usual Runge-Kuta methods.

The usual workflow with this library is to write two .c files that deppend on your particular IVP, and compile them linking against this library. The resulting binary produces the desired ouput (the points of the orbit).

The authors of the library provide a Mathematica package that can produce this two files from the symbolic expression of the differential equation. Together with one of the authors, we have writen a Sage replacement for that functionality, bat that will be part of another ticket. 

This one is just about the inclusion as an optional package.

The tarball with the library can be downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miguelmarco/TIDES/master/tides-2.0.tar.gz

(The authors send it on request, but it is GPL3, so there is no problem in distributing it).

Hi Miguel,

These are not very useful as debug information

```
"Error configuring PACKAGE_NAME."
"Error building PACKAGE_NAME."
"Error installing PACKAGE_NAME."
```


And it compiles without any trouble on my computer.

Great!

I guess one might want to test the compilation on other architecture (mine is a linux, 64 bits)...

Do you know if the [webpage of packages](http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/) gets automatically updated?

For the record, GPLv3 only sucks as a license. What if the author disappears, and then a new version of the GPL comes out? Optional package is OK, though. If you know the author it might be good to get him to license it as GPLvN+ for some value of N. But without the "or later" there is bound to be trouble later.
