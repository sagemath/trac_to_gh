# Issue 10449: Cellular Automata Module

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10502

Original creator: eviatarbach

Assignee: tbd

Sage should have a module for generating and analyzing cellular automata. This should include statistical tests, image and animation generation, and preimage computation.

Based on the existing source here, http://code.google.com/p/cellular-automata-sage-toolkit/, work needs to be done on accessibility and features before implementation. As of now I have changed the generating function of lt.next(), changed variable names to be more recognizable and/or conventional, added more documentation, and made the code more Pythonic (changing to "self" for the first argument of classes, for example.

Planned features for immediate implementation include statistical tests such as entropy, better, more customizable plotting, and visual generation of rule functions.

Maybe `sage.combinat.finite_state_machine.Automaton` is of interest for this implementation.

Changing component from packages: standard to packages: optional.
