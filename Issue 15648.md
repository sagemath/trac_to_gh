Keywords: getitem, matrix rings

Expressions such as `R['x']` and `R[sqrt(2)]` are frequently used in Sage to denote various kinds of ring extensions. But `R[n]` could also refer to the `n`-th element of `R`. This second meaning is implemented in the case of matrix rings, and does not look very useful in this case, or in fact for parents in general except for very special cases. Furthermore, having `__getitem__` do two unrelated things depending on its argument is confusing, and will get even more so if some parents start supporting both, say, `R[I]` and `R[42]`. So we should consider deprecating `R[index]` and providing a method such as `unrank()` instead.
