If you change `INPUT` blocks, could you use the [standard syntax](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings) for `INPUT` blocks? You are using all different kinds of formatting for the arguments.

I am not sure I understand what you want. This file surely needs a large-scale clean-up
but this is not what I want to do here and now.

I think we have discussed something like this before.

If a file needs a large-scale clean-up, then what is the point of this small-scale clean-up? You are just wasting our time with this halfway job.

To be clear: I am not asking you to do additional work. I am only asking that, _if_ you do something, you do it right.
