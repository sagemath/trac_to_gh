Many of these graphs can be trivially generated in GAP using its package Grape (a part of the optional gap_packages spkg) and
a library of primitive groups (a part of optional databases_gap spkg).
E.g. here is how to get Schlaefli graph:

```
sage: gap.load_package('grape')
sage: gap.eval('G:=NullGraph(PrimitiveGroup(27,12),27);')
'rec( isGraph := true, order := 27, group := PSp(4, 3), \n  schreierVector := [ -1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, \n      2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2 ], adjacencies := [ [  ] ], \n  representatives := [ 1 ], isSimple := true )'
sage: gap.eval('AddEdgeOrbit(G,[1,2]);')
''
sage: gap.eval('VertexDegrees(G);')
'[ 10 ]'
sage: edges=gap('Orbit(G.group,[1,2],OnSets)')
sage: len(edges)
135
sage: schlaefli=Graph([[int(x[1])-1,int(x[2])-1] for x in edges])
sage: schlaefli.degree()
[10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]
sage: schlaefli.diameter()
2
```


IMHO there is a more fundamental issue here: Sage should handle such graphs in an efficient way --- just keeping all the edges is pretty much a waste, in particular for bigger examples with hundreds of vertices...

actually, Grape isn't even needed (I mentioned it for illustrative purposes): to construct the Sage graph, 
all you need is the following:


```
sage: edges=gap('Orbit(PrimitiveGroup(27,12),[1,2],OnSets)')
sage: schlaefli=Graph([[int(x[1])-1,int(x[2])-1] for x in edges])
```


PS. To get e.g. Hall-Janko graph, use `PrimitiveGroup(100,1)`...

Sage way: throw random points on the sphere, generate the facets of their convex closuse (using e.g. cdd), then take the skeleton of the polytope (again, using cdd).
Slow, but trivial to code :-)

I am not sure I understand how to implement things like add_vertex() and add_edge() - as we would start with a permutation group G, the set of vertices is the domain of the group, and edges cannot be added one by one, but only as whole G-orbits.
(Alternatively, not all orbits of G are used as the vertex set, and then adding a vertex would mean adding its G-orbit.)

Well, you can always raise an error in the add_vertex function:

RuntimeError: You can't add vertices to this kind of graph.

Or something similar. Then whenever you called a function which tried to add a vertex you would get that error, but the rest of the graph library would work just fine.

Brinkmann's student J. Goedgebeur implemented a new version using a different algorithm which is faster for the `small' cases: http://caagt.ugent.be/buckygen/ This program is available under the GPL, so I assume it can be integrated in Sage. I'm willing to work on this. I have some familiarity with the program, since I integrated it into CaGe (http://caagt.ugent.be/CaGe).
