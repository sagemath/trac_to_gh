# Issue 20943: cantor_product: allow keyword arguments to be passed on to IntegerListsLex

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21180

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2016-08-06 09:13:34

Allow, for example, `min_slope` to get combinations as an output instead of arbitrary tuples. E.g., make

```
sage: cantor_product(srange(5), repeat=2, min_slope=1)
```

work.
