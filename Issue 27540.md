This change worries me:

```diff
-            sage: SetPartitions(["a", "b", "c"], [2,1]).list()
-            [{{'a'}, {'b', 'c'}}, {{'a', 'c'}, {'b'}}, {{'a', 'b'}, {'c'}}]
+            sage: sorted(SetPartitions(["a", "b", "c"], [2,1]), key=str)
+            [{{'a', 'b'}, {'c'}}, {{'a', 'c'}, {'b'}}, {{'a'}, {'b', 'c'}}]
```
as the enumeration of set partitions should be constant. Maybe something is slightly different in the algorithm, but this needs a closer examination (that I do not have time for tonight).

Okay, so the issue should be in enumerating the linear extensions of a poset. I am not sure what to do about that, but I think we should not sort the output here as it is just a symptom of an underlying issue.

I am also getting a failure in the `_latex_` method, but that also should not happen. My guess is the underlying (frozen)sets are not ordered the same way, which falls out from applying the `str`.

In this case it looks like the difference of order depend on that :\\

py2

```
sage: sp = SetPartitions(["a", "b", "c"], [2,1])
sage: sp._set
frozenset({'a', 'b', 'c'})
sage: list(sp._set)
['a', 'c', 'b']
```

py3

```
sage: sp = SetPartitions(["a", "b", "c"], [2,1])
sage: sp._set
frozenset({'a', 'b', 'c'})
sage: list(sp._set)
['a', 'b', 'c']
```

The position of elements of `list(sp._set)` is used for generating `SetPartitions_setparts.__iter__` results.

Enumerating the linear extensions give me the same orders in py2 and py3: 

```
sage: P = sp._set_partition_poset()
sage: [e for e in P.linear_extensions()]
[[0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 0], [1, 0, 2]]

Why ? The sames elements are present in both lists.

That is a good catch, I missed that. It is also good to know that enumerating the linear extensions is the same. So that is where we need to fix things. In the `__iter__`:

```diff
-s = list(self._set)
+try:
+    s = sorted(self._set)
+except TypeError:
+    s = sorted(self._set, key=str)
```

It should be consistent because it is an enumerated set, so the unranking should be compatible. Imagine you run something in parallel, get the `i`-th element in the worker process, and then want to use the `i`-th element in the main process. Being an enumerated set guarantees that this is consistent. (Another scenario is replace process by sessions.)
