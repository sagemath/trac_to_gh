# Issue 19617: Index of functions to finite lattices

This patch modifies index of functions of finite lattices (`lattices.py`) to categorized like finite posets (`posets.py`) already have.

Daniel: I think that after #18489 there has been several additions and I want to add at least `is_relatively_complemented()`, and so this categorizing makes sense. Basically this "needs_review" asks if you agree on that. 

There are two broken links, but they will work after #19801, which I suppose to be merged.

(Of course this is _not_ good even after this because of categories, but...)

Not feeling like using the automatic generation of tables?

Good point. This can be a good test ball for that.

(I suppose that this was also implicit "yes", so that ~20 functions is enough to have categorized index.)

There are two points. First is technical one:

`lattices.py` contains three classes, i.e. (whole) lattice and semilattices. Now, hand-made version contained a table like


```
**Meet and join**

    :meth:`~FiniteMeetSemilattice.meet` | Return the meet of given elements.
    :meth:`~FiniteJoinSemilattice.join` | Return the join of given elements.
```


and this seems to be impossible to do with this.

Second is not so technical. It is possible to have for example


```
:meth:`~FiniteLatticePoset.is_geometric` | Return ``True`` if the lattice is atomic and upper semimodular.
```


in the index and


```
def is_geometric(self):
    """                                                                     
    Return ``True`` if the lattice is geometric, and ``False`` otherwise.   
                                                                                
    A lattice is geometric if it is both atomic and upper semimodular.
```


in the function documentation. I think that hand-made index can be better than automatically generated; and of course it needs more work.

But I am a fan of Nathann's code. I think I could use it at matrices and groups, at least. They are used is basic courses at university, so they should have good documentation page.

Yo !

Oh. I see ... Yep, no way to have the methods of different classes in the same table I believe ...

> Second is not so technical. It is possible to have for example

There I really don't see the problem in having the same message twice. Setting both to `Return ``True`` if the lattice is atomic and upper semimodular.` can't hurt anybody.

> But I am a fan of Nathann's code. I think I could use it at matrices and groups, at least. They are used is basic courses at university, so they should have good documentation page.

Yep. Matrices and groups could surely use an index. Crazy that it hasn't happened before btw `O_o`

OK. I return this to needs_review again; in any case it will be better with full and categorized index than with partial uncategorized. #19801 was closed, so I think this can be safely be reviewed without waiting for next beta.

> There I really don't see the problem in having the same message twice. Setting both to `Return ``True`` if the lattice is atomic and upper semimodular.` can't hurt anybody.

Yeah, it is a very minor thing. But for `is_modular_element` the issue is bigger (but still quite small...). It sounds odd to have "Return True if x is a modular element - -" in the index, where you don't see the parameter x.

I guess it will make quite a big difference for a student to start using Sage for graph theory or for linear algebra... http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/matrices/index.html vs. http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/index.html . There should be at least index in the `matrix2.py` -- but the file (or compiled .html) itself is quite hidden.

Yo,

Err... Hmmm, technically you do something weird here: add a link toward a function that is not even defined in the branch.

But well, it is already merged so it probably doesn't matter. Do you compile the doc with '--warn-links' ? It helps a lot when you work on the doc.

An index of functions would *really* make a difference. Seriously `>_<`

No. I have done that before, and then forgotten the option. Thanks. And thanks for review.

I opened #19859 for index of matrix functions.
