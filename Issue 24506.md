In principle, we should be able to do these changes:

```diff
-`Singleton design pattern <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern>`_.
+:wikipedia:`Singleton design pattern <Singleton_pattern>`.
```


```diff
-`LP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming>`_
+:wikipedia`LP <Linear_programming>`
```

etc.
akin to how we can use `:class:`a class <Foo>``.

This is done in a few places in the Sage library, already. For example, from `categories/weyl_group.py`:

```
    See the :wikipedia:`Wikipedia page of Weyl Groups <Weyl_group>`.
```
