From an email exchange about plotting arcsec, slightly out of order:

The immediate context for this issue is a couple of problems that include, among other things, graphing arcsec and its derivative (in one case), arcsec and arccsc (in the other).  Since the range of intended functions is known, it appears that this would work if the students follow instructions (big if).  But more generally, we want students to have total control over their "graphing calculator" -- at least over the input boxes we provide -- so there's nothing stopping them from entering arcsec(x/2) or something else that we can't anticipate.

The underlying problem is that the plotting code ignores everything
between -1 and 1 (since those values aren't real), but then simply
connects (-1,3) and (1,.2) (or so) with a line segment when it's done. I
have a couple ideas for fixing this, but they won't help you in the near
term.

----

One workaround for your `@`interact would be to select an option for
exclude based on the function: I'm thinking of something like this:

`@`interact
def foo(fn=textbox(), ....):
    setup stuff...

    if fn == 'arcsin':
        exclude=[]
    elif fn == 'arcsec':
        exclude=[-1,1]

    plot(fn, ...., exclude=exclude)


The idea is just to look at the function being plotted and set a list of
points to exclude based on that. It would be tedious to code, but would
work.

----

I think that fixing this is possible.  I spent about a half hour looking at http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/9ab4ab6e12d0/sage/plot/plot.py just now and I am pretty sure that one could extract bad points like nan in generate_plot_points.  Currently we just do

data = [data[i] for i in range(len(data)) if i not in exception_indices]

which means we completely ignore them, but presumably we could keep this data somehow and return it as part of generate_plot_points (not sure whether that would have to be deprecated) so that we could add that somehow to the exclude data around http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/9ab4ab6e12d0/sage/plot/plot.py#l1279  

The problem is that there could be a lot of these, and that could slow things down a lot to check all of them, but checking for a "consecutive series" would also take some time.

Anyway, it's at least doable in principle, but would take some time and care to implement, making sure it didn't cause any other regressions.

Here's an idea I thought of that would help avoid these ugly situations. The problem is that we build our plot out of lots of tiny line segments, and we have a line segment connecting things that it should not connect. So:

Let `w = xmax - xmin`. After building the list of `(x,y)` points for the plot, go through the `x`s. If the difference between any two consecutive `x` values is "too big", don't connect them.

Since going through the list would be expensive and rarely needed, we would only do this with a keyword, say `detect_gaps`. If set to `True`, it would default to ignoring gaps of, say, `0.01*w`. Otherwise, the user could specify a proportion: `detect_gaps=0.05` or whatever. This procedure would only run if `detect_gaps` was `True` or a number between 0 and 1.

Does that seem reasonable? That would fix the original problem at the cost of a little speed.

> Apart from that the patch no longer applies---and I'm not sure if the changes meanwhile done in Sage possibly change the overall situation or the necessary patch---, the given doctest fails with `AttributeError: 'complex' object has no attribute 'arccos'`.

I haven't considered rebasing this patch (and a couple other patches) because there doesn't seem to be much interest in this. The issue that this patch fixes did come up in the mailing list two or three months ago, but I haven't obtained any feedback since then. As far as I know, this issue is definitely not fixed even in the latest development versions.

The problem with `AttributeError` is not introduced with this patch. It seems to be a problem with Sage itself. The code where it fails is 

```
.../sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/functions/trig.pyc in _evalf_(self, x, parent, algorithm)
    732         if parent is float:
    733             return math.acos(1/x)
--> 734         return (1/x).arccos()
    735
    736     def _eval_numpy_(self, x):
```



EDIT: Sorry, I was wrong. The use of `instance(parent, (float, complex))` is not correct since `complex` can not be converted to `float` apparently. In that case, there is something else wrong in Sage that is producing `complex` entries, when the entries were `float` earlier.

The error about complex entries was introduced in between 5.10.rc1 and 5.11.rc1

Earlier it used to be a `ValueError` and was properly handled by the plot code:

```
sage: from sage.plot.misc import setup_for_eval_on_grid
sage: f, d = setup_for_eval_on_grid(arcsec, [(-2, 2)])
sage: xi = -0.992725195401
sage: f(xi)

Now it spits out `AttributeError` instead.

The following page is a problem set in our online text that has six interacts, the last two with my workaround for handling arcsec(x) and arccsc(x), as well as their derivatives, which involve 1/sqrt(x^2-1), another good test function, along with its reciprocal, sqrt(x^2-1).\n\nhttp://calculuscourse.maa.org/main2/Chapter5/Section5-5/Chapter5-5-6M.html\n\nIf you enter any of these in those last two \"Graph\" interacts (Problem 6 or 7), they will be drawn correctly -- because nothing is drawn between -1 and 1.  [But arcsec(x/2) will cause an error message, and arcsec(2*x) will not be completely drawn.]  If you enter any of these in the third or fourth interacts (Problems 4 and 5), there will either be an error message (arcsec or arccsc) or the graph will be incorrectly drawn between 1 and -1 (sqrt(x^2-1) or 1/sqrt(x^2-1)).\n\nI think the general class of functions for which this particular problem exists is those for which the domain is interrupted by an interval of finite length greater than 0.  The inverse trig functions seem to involve a different problem when trying to compute non-real values, but I don't understand the error messages.",

Thanks for this digging, ppurka.  I have to say there isn't a lot in [that changelog](http://www.sagemath.org/mirror/src/changelogs/sage-5.11.txt) that seems likely.  Maybe #13933?  But see below.

This ticket has exposed some bugs in trig.py as well.

    735 
    736     def _eval_numpy_(self, x):

```

Compare to behavior in Sage 5.2:

```

arcsec(-0.992725195401000)
sage: arcsec(float(-0.992725195401))
arcsec(-0.992725195401)

Related, I think - none of these take things nicely.

Anyway, I think I got it.  Old behavior:

```
sage: arcsec(float(-0.992725195401))
arcsec(-0.992725195401)
```

This is because *before* #13933, `arcsec.__call__`, a `BuiltinFunction` (**not** `GinacFunction`) was inheriting its `__call__` method directly from `Function`.    Then we hit [this branch of the code](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/symbolic/function.pyx#n459) which turns the argument into a symbolic argument.

But now, `arcsec` (still a `BuiltinFunction` now) uses the `__call__` method from what used to be the method for only `GinacFunction`, but which is now the method also for `BuiltinFunction`.  So after doing the same thing it did before, getting the symbolic version

```
sage: a = float(-0.992725195401)
KeyboardInterrupt
sage: res = super(sage.symbolic.function.BuiltinFunction,arcsec).__call__(a,coerce=True)
sage: res
arcsec(-0.992725195401)
```

it now [continues on instead of returning](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/symbolic/function.pyx#n936), and tries to evaluate `res` as a complex, which causes us to go back to `_evalf_` of `arcsec`

```
sage: complex(res)

AttributeError: 'complex' object has no attribute 'arccos'
```


I'm not sure if the correct fix is to just make sure trig.py can handle this, or whether this is a possible bug in the way `BuiltinFunction` was changed.  I'm going to ask at #13933.
----

Finally, from one of the original requesters, some more test cases.

Thanks for looking into this.  The following page is a problem set in our online text that has six interacts, the last two with my workaround for handling arcsec(x) and arccsc(x), as well as their derivatives, which involve 1/sqrt(x^2-1), another good test function, along with its reciprocal, sqrt(x^2-1).

http://calculuscourse.maa.org/main2/Chapter5/Section5-5/Chapter5-5-6M.html

If you enter any of these in those last two "Graph" interacts (Problem 6 or 7), they will be drawn correctly -- because nothing is drawn between -1 and 1.  [But arcsec(x/2) will cause an error message, and arcsec(2*x) will not be completely drawn.]  If you enter any of these in the third or fourth interacts (Problems 4 and 5), there will either be an error message (arcsec or arccsc) or the graph will be incorrectly drawn between 1 and -1 (sqrt(x^2-1) or 1/sqrt(x^2-1)).

I think the general class of functions for which this particular problem exists is those for which the domain is interrupted by an interval of finite length greater than 0.  The inverse trig functions seem to involve a different problem when trying to compute non-real values, but I don't understand the error messages.

Where do you see this behavior? I can not reproduce it. This is the output in sage-6.1.1

from the doctest doesn't seem to work for me.  I wonder if this worked before #16439?

I have a different comment.

```
sage: plot(sqrt(x^2-1), -2, 2, plot_points=500, ymin=0)
```

yields
![](tmp_W0a_CS copy.png)
As you can see, it never quite makes it down to the horizontal axis.    If you use the endpoints 1 and 2, it does; 0 and 2 doesn't.   (And presumably didn't in the past, either.)  Anyway, that is annoying, though I'm not sure there is much to do about it.

Here is what is going on.  For user-provided exclusion, we have

```
        if isinstance(exclude, (list, tuple)):
            exclude = sorted(exclude)
            # We make sure that points plot points close to the excluded points are computed
```

but we don't have something similar to that for the 'auto-excluded points'.  I don't see an easy way to do this, though.  

I am also annoyed (this has nothing to do with this patch) by the inconsistency between `exclude is not None`, `not exclude`, `exclude != None`, and so forth.  There are subtle things that can happen here, though I think that in this case they don't.

----

Now for something that I still see as a bug, though probably not a problem for this ticket.

```
sage: polar_plot(sin(sqrt(x^2-1)), (x, 0, 2*pi), exclude=[2,3])
sage: polar_plot(sin(sqrt(x^2-1)), (x, 0, 2*pi), exclude=[1/2,2,3])
```

Compare these.  The first one does just what you want.  The second one does not - presumably because I'm excluding a point already not in the domain, but why does that cause a problem?  The others should still be there.  You could say it's user error, but then again

```
sage: plot(x,(x,0,1),exclude=[-1,1/2])
```

works as desired, so I don't think that is why, and it occurs with and without this change.  
Actually, presumably this is via parametric from polar.

```
sage: parametric_plot((sqrt(x^2-1),sqrt(x^2-1/2)),(x,0,5), exclude=[2,3])
sage: parametric_plot((sqrt(x^2-1),sqrt(x^2-1/2)),(x,0,5), exclude=[1,2,3])
```

Is this a new ticket, or a wontfix?  I'm inclined to say this is a bug.
