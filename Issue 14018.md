For the record, here are a couple suggestions for further improvements for Polyhedrons that I though about during the Sage days in Bobo. The nice thing is that half of my list suggestion has already been implemented since then without me asking :-) Feel free to split/recycle/mark as duplicate this ticket as appropriate.

- Document the syntax for the ieqs option of Polyhedron

- Rename dim to dimension for consistency with vector spaces, or just add an alias:

   {{{
      sage: square = polytopes.n_cube(2)
      sage: UpperHalfPlane.dimension()
      2
   }}}

- Mixed intersections between Cones and Polyhedron returning a Polyhedron:

   {{{
      sage: cone = Cone([(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1)])
      sage: p = polytopes.n_cube(2)
      sage: p & cone
      A 2-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^2 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices
   }}}

   In an ideal world, maybe there should be a coercion Cone->Polyhedron, and this would be handled by the coercion framework? In the mean time, calling Polyhedron in the intersection code for Cone and Polyhedron should just do the jon.

the dimension alias is working..;
I remove it from the list.
