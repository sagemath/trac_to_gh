For the record, here are a couple suggestions for further improvements for Polyhedrons that I though about during the Sage days in Bobo. The nice thing is that half of my list suggestion has already been implemented since then without me asking :-) Feel free to split/recycle/mark as duplicate this ticket as appropriate.

- Document the syntax for the ieqs option of Polyhedron

- Rename dim to dimension for consistency with vector spaces, or just add an alias:

   {{{
      sage: square = polytopes.n_cube(2)
      sage: UpperHalfPlane.dimension()
      2
   }}}

- Mixed intersections between Cones and Polyhedron returning a Polyhedron:

   {{{
      sage: cone = Cone([(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1)])
      sage: p = polytopes.n_cube(2)
      sage: p & cone
      A 2-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^2 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices
   }}}

   In an ideal world, maybe there should be a coercion Cone->Polyhedron, and this would be handled by the coercion framework? In the mean time, calling Polyhedron in the intersection code for Cone and Polyhedron should just do the jon.
