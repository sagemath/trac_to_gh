The dependency on #12039 is because that ticket fixes a pickling bug in `sage.structure.parent.Set_PythonType_class`.

Is there any way you can make this not depend on #12039, or is that essential for (say) doing a `loads(dumps(X))` test?  Currently #12039 does not apply.

Patch does not apply. And depends on two tickets without patch `O_o`
