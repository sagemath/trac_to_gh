Depending on the parent, the polynomial-like elements have different way to access the variables
- `UnivariatePolynomial`: `variable_name` and `variables`
- `MultivariatePolynomial`: `variable` (uncomprehensible) and `variables`
- `(Laurent)PowerSeries`: `variable` (returning a string)

Note: for `MultivariatePolynomial`s, `variable(i)` returns the `i`-th variable. For some implementation, the parameter `i` defaults to `0` but not all of them.
