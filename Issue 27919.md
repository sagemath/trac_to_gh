Keywords: repr fpsac

According to https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_in_python.html#print-representation it is preferable to implement `_repr_` rather than `__repr__` for classes inheriting from `SageObject`. Currently there are quite a lot of `__repr__` usage, but not all of them are for `SageObjects`:


```
$ grep -R "def _repr_[(]" src/sage | wc -l
1749
$ grep -R "def __repr__[(]" src/sage | wc -l
498
```
