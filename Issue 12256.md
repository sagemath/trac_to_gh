# Issue 12256: make flintqs respect global CXX flag

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12428

Original creator: ohanar

Original creation time: 2012-02-04 17:20:08

Assignee: GeorgSWeber

The flintqs spkg currently does not respect the global CXX flag, we should fix this (for instance for #12426).

I've posted an spkg at [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/flintqs-20070817.p7.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/flintqs-20070817.p7.spkg).

Isn't CXX for the C++ compiler and CPP for the C preprocessor?

Yes, but flintqs disagrees (look at the makefile).

I don't understand why we still have this separate spkg; as mentioned on previous tickets, a more recent version of FLINT QS is included in FLINT 1.x (and hence also in our FLINT spkg), which we just don't build and/or install there, for whatever reason... :-/

Again, `$CXX` should be quoted.

Apparently, this rumour is false.

> Again, `$CXX` should be quoted.
Indeed. Or quote the whole argument `"CPP=$CXX"`.

About the flintqs vs flint rumor, see [Bill Hart's mail](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/flint-devel/lmRdEPV6el8/JNbZ4eTy_n0J) when I asked about it last year.

Obsoleted by new autotooled `flintQS`.
