When a finite field uses `givaro` as a backend, it is possible to deal with polynomial rings in a single variable, but dealing with multivariate polynomial ring (`libsingular`) leads to segfaults.

Here is an example:


```
sage: F = GF(3, impl='givaro')
sage: F
Finite Field of size 3
sage: type(F)                                                                                                                                                                                                
<class 'sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_givaro.FiniteField_givaro_with_category'>


sage: R.<a0> = PolynomialRing(F)
sage: type(R)
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring.PolynomialRing_dense_finite_field_with_category'>                                                                                                                                                                           
sage: F(R(2))
2

sage: R.<a0,a1> = PolynomialRing(F)
sage: type(R)
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomialRing_libsingular'>
sage: F(R(2))
....
Segmentation fault
```


Not sure who to blame though.
