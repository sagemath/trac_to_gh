As mentioned at https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/na7d3kwMk68/discussion 3D documentation can greatly benefit from someone actually trying to read/use it from the beginning.

Superficially this looks good, though

```
+Different viewers are supported other jmol, like a web-based interactive viewer
+using the Three.js JavaScript library and accesible through the ``show(viewer='threejs')``
+method of any 3d graphic. A raytraced representation is accesible by typing
+``show(viewer='tachyon')``:
```

needs to be updated a bit or changed for grammar, and I wonder about this change:

```diff

             sage: import scipy.interpolate
             sage: f=scipy.interpolate.RectBivariateSpline(v_phi,v_theta,m_r)
             sage: spherical_plot3d(f,(0,2*pi),(0,pi))
```

because I didn't think we changed the continuation style back, but I may not be knowledgeable about that any more.

Thank you very much for this work. It enhances significantly the 3D plot doc! 
I have two minor suggestions, that you might consider: 
- in the sentence _The viewer is invoked by adding the keyword argument viewer='jmol' (respectively 'tachyon' or 'threejs') to the command show() on any three-dimensional graphic_, one should rather write _(respectively 'threejs' or 'tachyon')_ to match the order of the previous sentence. 
- in the same sentence, it would nice to replace _show()_ by :funct:`~sage.plot.plot3d.base.Graphics3d.show`; this would ease the access to the documentation of `show`, which is somewhat hidden for the end user.

OK, since it is highly desirable to have this in Sage 8.0 and the current state of the ticket branch is already very nice, I am setting the ticket to positive review. The suggestions made in comment:11 are not crucial and could be added later on.
