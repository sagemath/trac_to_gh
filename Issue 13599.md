Keywords: limits, C datatype

Prior to #12224 we need to know what C types limits. The patch provides a direct Python access to limits.h.

`s/Mimimum/Minimum/` (once)

`s/a C long long max/a C long long int/`

Not sure whether the doctests make sense when they're all tagged `# random`...

We also have things like `sys.maxint`, a couple of (size-related) definitions from `distutils.sysconfig.get_config_var[s]()`, and `os.sysconf()`.

The values don't vary much on the platforms *supported by Sage*; AFAIK there are currently only differences depending on whether we're on a 32- or 64-bit operating system, or, more precisely, whether Sage *was built* 32-bit or 64-bit (as one could in principle run a 32-bit binary dist on a 64-bit OS, or even build and run a 32-bit version on a 64-bit OS, e.g. Solaris).

Thanks very much (I am not at all a specialist but I need to call char_max() in some constructor).

Is the following a safe test ?

```
sage: from sage.misc.limits import int_min
sage: int_min() # random (architecture and platform dependence)
-2147483648
sage: import sysconfig
sage: s = sysconfig.get_config_var('SIZEOF_INT')
sage: int_min() == - 2**(s*8-1)
True
```


Best,
Vincent

It seems that this would be a valuable upstream Cython contribution as well.

In fact, isn't this it?  https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/Cython/Includes/libc/limits.pxd

Maybe this patch would be cleaner if you did:


```
from libc cimport limits
```

at the top and then used limits.<whatever>?  Or maybe not.  It's a suggestion.
