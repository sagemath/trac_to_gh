Apparently our binary build doesn't have a portable MPIR: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/7nqyDJt2aBM/fXr4YiyyAwAJ

The mpir log also has some suspicious output, but of course we never stop for errors:

```
$ SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes sage -f mpir

I see, so `configfsf.guess` is not executable so you run it with `bash`. But defining `MACHINE_TYPE_MPIR` when you don't use it (apart from informational purpose seems over the top. 

Nevertheless, it should fix the problem.
