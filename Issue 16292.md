I could not find `imp.reload` in the Python 2.7 documentation!

But trying it gives:

```
>>> sys.version
'2.7.8 (default, Oct 20 2014, 15:05:19) \n[GCC 4.9.1]'
>>> type(reload)
<type 'builtin_function_or_method'>
>>> import imp
>>> type(imp.reload)
<type 'builtin_function_or_method'>
```

So it is available! It's just missing in the docs.

And for comparison:

```
>>> sys.version
'3.4.2 (default, Oct  8 2014, 13:08:17) \n[GCC 4.9.1]'
>>> type(reload)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'reload' is not defined
>>> import imp
>>> type(imp.reload)
<class 'function'>
```
