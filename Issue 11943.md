I have a repeatable failure.  This is presumably due to the MPIR 
upgrade in 4.8.alpha0 at #8664.

This is due to the change in mpir-2.1.3.p1 that enables the static library.

However, given that this has something to do with yasm, perhaps the new yasm would fix it?  Or is this something that would be fixed by rebasing?  (I don't see anything about forking, but I don't know how to interpret assembler (!) messages.)

On my Cygwin, the new spkg hangs on 

```
Checking what CFLAGS MPIR would use if they were empty...
```

This might have to do with the fact that my 32-bit Win 7 is run in a VMWare VM, rather than being a "real" iron, but this is certainly 
not good, one way or another.

Any ideas what can be tried to see what's wrong? 

EDIT: perhaps I was not patient enough. I tried doing `../../sage -f mpir-2.4.0.p7.spkg` and it this part worked OK, although I waited 30 minutes or so.

Yup, Cygwin is slow and MPIR configure is long.
moreover the spkg runs it a first time redirecting its output to some file to get the default flags...
