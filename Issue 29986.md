At the moment the examples at the top of the file fail and they shouldn't.
In particular using the objects defined there one gets:

```
sage: set(GQ2._points) == set(range(1,1106))
False
sage: for i in GQ2._points:
....:     if i not in range(1,1106):
....:         print(i)
....:         
sage: for i in range(1,1106):
....:     if i not in GQ2._points:
....:         print(i)
....:      
sage:
```
I wonder if I'm missing something or if `==` is returning some weird output.

`set(GQ2._points)` consists of GAP's  Integers, but in `range(1,1106)` you have Python `<int>`.

There is no automatic conversion between these set elements when you compare them:

```
sage: libgap(1)==int(1)
True
sage: type(libgap(1))
<class 'sage.libs.gap.element.GapElement_Integer'>
sage: set([libgap(1)])==set([int(1)])
False
```

The description of 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_quadrangle

How about renaming gen_quadrangles.pyx to gen_quadrangles_with_spread.pyx

Also, `generalised_quadrangle_hermitian` should be renamed to something like
`generalised_quadrangle_hermitian_with_ovoid`

Perhaps it makes sense to introduce spreads for general Sage's incidence systems
(sets of blocks that don't pairwise intersect and cover all the points) - then spreads here will be a particular case.

Do you have any idea on how to do so? We could add a field to the `IncidenceStructure` class or make a subclass `IncidenceStructureWithSpread`...

sage: set(tt.block_sizes())

```
Indeed, we got the collinearity graph of GQ(s,t)=GQ(4,16), as 68=s(t+1)=4*17, lambda=s-1=3, mu=t+1=17, and each of 325 blocks has size 17 (i.e. dually each of the 325 points has 17 blocks
of size s+1=5 on it).
