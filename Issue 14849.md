At #12630, quivers and their algebras and representations have been added to Sage. But it's all Python. The purpose of this ticket is to convert parts of the code to Cython, `QuiverPath` in particular.

Sorry for adding so many people on Cc---namely all which are Cc of #12630.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15086
