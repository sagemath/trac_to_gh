At #12630, quivers and their algebras and representations have been added to Sage. But it's all Python. The purpose of this ticket is to convert parts of the code to Cython, `QuiverPath` in particular.

Sorry for adding so many people on Cc---namely all which are Cc of #12630.

It seems you are right. Cythoned quiver paths definitely _are_ in Sage by now.

Closing tickets in the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix module with positive_review (i.e. someone has confirmed they should be closed).
