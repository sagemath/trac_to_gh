While doctesting `src/sage/repl/ipython_kernel/install.py`:
    

```
DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence '\s'
```

    
The solution is to make the regex a raw string.

Upstream: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/6253

On the one hand, this looks fine to me. But I also see that this has now been fixed upstream in 6.4.7 (https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/releases/tag/v6.4.7) and it would make sense to update from 6.4.6 to 6.4.7 or 6.4.8.

I agree, updating to the latest in the 6.4.x series is better
