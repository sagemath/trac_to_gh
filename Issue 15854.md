A (v,v,1)-BIBD is a set of size v. Though right now :

...
ValueError: I don't know how to build this design.
```

Looks good to me. I have considered what I think is a proper review: I got your remote branch and made it my local branch. Then, I did sage -b, opening a sage session, I tested out this code and it worked fine. Since this adds no new documentation, I did not rebuild the documentation. I hope this sounds fine.

Helloooooooooo !!

The beginning looks right, but when doing a review you should also check that all doctests pass : those are the examples of Sage code that we add in the doc, i.e. what comes after "A trivial BIBD" in the branch.

Each time you review a patch, make sure that what the patch changes/adds is tested in one such example, and that it returns what it shoud :

by running "sage -t file.py", you tests all those lines. That's how we can spot a LOT of bugs before a release, as all functions of Sage are tested in this way. If you change something very fundamental in the code and make a mistake, very often the doctests of all functions that use the code that you changed will be buggy, and you can spot that by running "sage -t" on related files.

You can also run "sage -tp X file.py" where X is the number of CPU that you have,if you have many of them.

Hah, thanks for the heads up! I did the sage -t:

```
Apples-MacBook-Pro:sage apple$ sage -t src/sage/combinat/designs/block_design.py
init.sage does not exist ... creating
Running doctests with ID 2014-04-23-21-17-34-0ba3f60d.
Doctesting 1 file.
sage -t src/sage/combinat/designs/block_design.py
    [23 tests, 1.47 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 1.5 seconds
    cpu time: 0.5 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 1.5 seconds
```

and all tests pass! Thank you Nathann for pointing out.
