# Issue 31320: Fix product(-x, x, 1, SR.var('n')) to return (-1)^n*factorial(n)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31557

Original creator: slelievre

Original creation time: 2021-03-25 03:34:19

CC:  @robert-dodier slelievre

Keywords: symbolic_product, maxima

From #30520.

Observed:

```
sage: product(-x, x, 1, SR.var('n'))
#0: simplify_product(product='product(-_SAGE_VAR_x,_SAGE_VAR_x,1,_SAGE_VAR_n))
...
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: ECL says: Error executing code in Maxima:
factorial: factorial of negative integer -1 not defined.
```

which amounts to:

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_product
sage: x, n = SR.var('x, n')
sage: symbolic_product(-x, x, 1, n)
#0: simplify_product(product='product(-_SAGE_VAR_x,_SAGE_VAR_x,1,_SAGE_VAR_n))
...
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: ECL says: Error executing code in Maxima:
factorial: factorial of negative integer -1 not defined.
```


Expected:

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_product
sage: x, n = SR.var('x, n')
sage: symbolic_product(-x, x, 1, n)
(-1)^n*factorial(n)
```

I've pushed commit c584c24 on maxima-code/master to fix this bug.

Thanks for fixing this and for the heads-up.

This should be applied as a patch in Sage until
a Maxima release has this and we upgrade to it.

Oops, spoke too soon. Commit c584c24 causes a stack overflow in some other code (namely simplify_sum). Commit c584c24 has been reverted, and I'm working on an update. Sorry to say the problem isn't actually fixed yet.

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.
