Yes.  It takes any polynomial or symbolic expression and turns
it into a very fast callable function that has input and output floats.
It should get used automatically by functions like find_min* but
we haven't pushed this through enough yet.

fast_float doesn't look like a win here in 3.1.2.alpha2, at least not in the cases I tried


```
sage: timeit('find_minimum_on_interval(x*sin(x)^2,3,3.4)')
25 loops, best of 3: 24.5 ms per loop
sage: sage: timeit('find_minimum_on_interval((x*sin(x)^2)._fast_float_(x),3,3.4)')
5 loops, best of 3: 109 ms per loop

# not sure what goes wrong here
sage: find_maximum_on_interval(-x^2,-1,1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: cannot coerce type '<class 'sage.calculus.equations.SymbolicEquation'>' into a SymbolicExpression.

sage: timeit('(-x^2).find_maximum_on_interval(-1,1)')
5 loops, best of 3: 22.4 ms per loop
sage: timeit('find_maximum_on_interval((-x^2)._fast_float_(x),-1,1)')
5 loops, best of 3: 61.5 ms per loop
```

I guess what is going on is that the time to compile the function to fast_float form swamps the time to find the minimum, at least in these cases.


```
sage: timeit('f = (-x^2)._fast_float_()')
5 loops, best of 3: 82.6 ms per loop
sage: timeit('find_maximum_on_interval(f,-1,1)')
625 loops, best of 3: 690 Âµs per loop
```

I notice that fast_float was sneaked into find_root in the first patch at #2703, which was nominally a doctest coverage patch.  It doesn't look like any kind of benchmarking was done there.

Oops, it was #2073.

See #3622 for a discussion of timings with fast_float.  Based on that discussion, this probably is worth doing.

It seems that both forms of find_minimum_on_interval use fast_float now (sage/symbolic/expression.pyx:8398 and sage/numerical/optimize.py:181) but only one form of find_maximum_on_interval does, i.e. the f.find_maximum_on_interval(a,b) (sage/symbolic/expression.pyx:8339). find_maximum_on_interval(f, a, b) does not.

I'm testing a patch for this and will be uploading it in a short while.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Comment by novoselt created at 2012-06-10 07:49:45

I'll be happy to review this if it is rebased on top of #2607.

It would be great also if you approve my last changes on that ticket which were implementing your suggestion of dropping "_on_interval".


---

Comment by aginiewicz created at 2012-06-24 10:32:34

Due to number of inevitable changes in #2607 and fact, that's it is ready for review with reviewers comments fixed, I already rebased this patch on top of it and added it to dependencies. This patch also looks cleaner on top of it.

Ah, forgot about that. Thanks for reminder, done now.

rebased on v5.4

This should just be applied. I rebased it on 5.4.

Setting to positive-review.

Why the milestone change?


---

Comment by ppurka created at 2012-12-24 07:08:10

Is anyone working with very large numbers, or is there any doctest which checks for very large numbers? Because this patch might affect the result. See #13559.

Patchbot: apply trac3955-find_local_maximum-ff.2.patch

jdemeyer: sorry about the milestone change, I didn't realize 5.5 was already in the RC stage.

ppurka: if I understand it correctly, all the other `find_{min,max}imum_on_interval` functions have already been changed to use `fast_float`. So already from a consistency point of view, this one should be, too.

Of course, you still have a point. Especially since before, you could always manually pass a `fast_float` function if you needed the speedup, but now you cannot disable that feature if you need the precision.

Maybe there should be something like a safe version of fast float, that checks its results for `NaN` or `Inf` and if so, redoes the calculation with the original expression.

I think that this patch should still be applied for consistency. Maybe such a safe version of `fast_float` could be the solution to #13559?


---

Comment by ppurka created at 2012-12-24 17:57:26

Ok. If it is improving consistency, then let it be. The bug in #13559 is less about safety and more about allowing `fast_float` to work with higher precision. `@`kcrisman there asks whether it is possible to make `fast_float` not just behave like python float, but be able to handle even larger numbers.

In the future, make sure the "apply" instructions in the ticket description remain up-to-date.

Resolution: fixed
