As listed in #7368, we should be able to compose isogenies.
See also discussions in #12880, comments 20 and 21.

As in #12880, only the doctests concerning equality fail; it will be fix as soon as #11474 will be fix.

Making #7368 a dependency would mean that this ticket will never get merged...

To continue the discussion from comment:17:ticket:12880 and comment:21:ticket:12880, I agree it is useful to have "formal" composition (returning a chain of isogenies) besides "flesh-and-blood" composition (returning a single isogeny).

Which of the two the user wants depends of course on the application.  The "principle of least surprise" suggests that if `phi` and `psi` are of type `EllipticCurveIsogeny`, then `phi * psi` should again be an `EllipticCurveIsogeny`.  I am thinking of the analogy with integers: if `m` and `n` are of type `Integer`, then `m * n` returns an `Integer`, which does not remember `m` and `n`; there is a separate `Factorization` class for that.

Hence I would be in favour of making `phi * psi` mean "flesh-and-blood" composition, and to have a differently named method, say `phi.chain(psi)`, that returns chains of isogenies.  (There doesn't seem to be an existing class for arbitrary finite chains of morphisms in a category; `sage.categories.map.FormalCompositeMap` only supports compositions of two morphisms.)

Oh, I had a bad intuition of how formal composition is implemented in Sage. I thought that the result of composition would still be an instance of `EllipticCurveIsogeny`. I see now that `Morhpism` does less magic than I thought.

Agreed. Let's not overdesign the `EllipticCurveIsogeny` class.

Still, I am a bit concerned about efficiency. Contrary to the case of integers and factorisations, the factored form requires much less storage than the "normalized" form. But this is a much more general discussion, that does not only affect isogenies.

Well, arbitrary chains are already supported by this class, although associativity is broken by design. It shouldn't be too much work to modify `FormalCompositeMap` so that it stores a list of morphisms instead of a pair.

However, such an object seems to belong to the category framework. Haven't the combinat people worked on this yet?

Merged the latest beta and made a few small whitespace fixes.

I think this is basically fine.  With regard to the above discussion about "formal" versus "real" composition, I don't have a strong opinion on what the default should be.  So if nobody objects to the current state (composing isogenies returns a `FormalCompositeMap`) this can get a positive review.

Has someone checked that this works on top of #11327, which has already been merged?

I just verified that all tests still pass after merging with the latest beta (6.4.beta1).

Since nobody objected so far, let's merge this ticket.
