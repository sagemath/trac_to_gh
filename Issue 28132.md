# Issue 28132: Improve progress report in gitlab-ci

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28369

Original creator: slelievre

Original creation time: 2019-08-20 03:46:24

CC:  jrueth slelievre

Keywords: gitlab-ci

In gitlab-ci the output for make is limited to 4MB so our scripts
only output dots for each line after a while, which makes it hard
to track progress.

We fix this by keeping the initial line of output for each new
package starting to be built.
