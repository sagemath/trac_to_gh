# Issue 20450: wrong result for is_subword_of

Issue created by migration from Trac.

I wouldn't have expected the following:

```
sage: phi = WordMorphism('a->aba,b->ab')
sage: w = phi('a', 3)
sage: w
word: abaababaabaababaababa
sage: Word('bb').is_subword_of(w)
True
```

By `subword` is meant the same definition as in [Chapter 6 Subwords](https://books.google.fr/books?id=eATLTZzwW-sC&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=subword+lothaire&source=bl&ots=ZriLpJXbK5&sig=OdHaDu_IWcUL_Qs6U0oKOZ2H0ic&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjS7onE-_DaAhVC8RQKHbriAnAQ6AEIQTAE#v=onepage&q=subword%20lothaire&f=false) of 1997 Lothaire's book.

LGTM; let's wait for the patchbot. (If the patchbot does not complain, then anyone who sees this, feel free to give it a positive review.)
