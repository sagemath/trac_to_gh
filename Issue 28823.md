Testing of source and binary distributions relies too much on manual testing by people.

We propose to set up Dockerfiles and CI scripts that document and test the expected capabilities of source and binary Sage distributions; and of downstream distribution packaging.

Examples:
- A Dockerfile for testing that the sage binary distribution runs on `ubuntu:latest` with the following set of installed distribution packages....
- A Dockerfile for testing that the sage binary distribution is able to install optional packages when run on `ubuntu:latest` with the following set of installed distribution packages....
- A Dockerfile for testing that all `spkg-configure.m4` scripts work as expected (using `./configure --with-system-PACKAGE=force`)
- Testing that it is possible to build without error when upgrading with git from some list of previous releases.
- Testing that `sage -c SAGECOMMAND`, `sage -t`, `sage -python -c COMMAND`, ... work with the `sage` script provided by the distribution (see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-packaging/BmkxIBdwbvE/fRMl2sjdBQAJ)
- Testing that a macOS binary distribution works on a set of OS versions, with and without XCode installed. (Sadly, cannot use Docker for that.)
- Testing the cygwin build using Azure pipelines / GitHub Actions.

See the following for some work in this direction:
- https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage-numerical-backends-coin (current)

I like the general idea of doing more CI a lot. Probably we should split this ticket up though or turn it into a meta ticket that tracks similar CI improvements such as #28457, #24854, #25262.

For this to be actually noticed by people we probably would need some integration with Trac.

Yes, that would be nice. But it would already help if this were run at the time that betas and releases are prepared. I don't think it needs to be run on every ticket.

`build/pkgs/DISTRO.txt` contains the minimal requirements for building sage from a source distribution
and `build/pkgs/DISTRO-bootstrap.txt` are the additional requirements so that `./bootstrap` works.
In #29124 I propose to create pseudo-spkgs to capture these, instead, to make this a bit more uniform.
