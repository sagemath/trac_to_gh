# Issue 29614: write-dockerfile.sh: Debian has Python3.8 instead of 3.7

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29851

Original creator: @cduston44

As per the wiki, running 


```

build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh debian "@(standard|optional)" > Dockerfile
```



Generates a Dockerfile, but running the dockerfile fails because Debian (at least) comes with Python3.8, not 3.7. This can be fixed by changing the file build/pkgs/python3/distros/debian.txt, but I don't know if that will have unexpected consequences.

Yes, this will have to be changed when we support Python 3.8 (#27754). At the moment, we only accept Python 3.7.x in `configure`; ticket #29033 adds Python 3.6.x support.

Also, see the flag IGNORE_MISSING_SYSTEM_PACKAGES in tox.ini, which we use both for too old versions of the distribution that don't have all packages, and for too new versions of the distribution, such as `ubuntu-focal`.

I already noticed the problem. So what this does it just make the workflow go through, even though it coulnd't install python3.7. It will later find out that no suitable python can be found and install python3.7 for sage.

That's right. Best we can do before we get to Python 3.8 compatibility in #27754, which seems to have stalled
