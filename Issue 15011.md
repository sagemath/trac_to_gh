# Issue 15011: Calling a lazy power series ring twice summons demons from hell

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15248

Keywords: coercion, lazy-power-series


```
sage: R = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: x = R.gen()
sage: x
x
sage: M = Matrix(R, [[x, x], [1, x]])
sage: M.det()
Uninitialized lazy power series
```


Sounds good so far. Now let's do this all again, in the same session:


```
sage: R = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: x = R.gen()
sage: x
x
sage: M = Matrix(R, [[x, x], [1, x]])
sage: M.det()

Classic example of constructing "unique" objects over "non-identical-but-equal" bases. Excellent find! It's well-known this is bound to give problems, but I'm not sure we had such a clear example yet.

```
sage: R.<x>=LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: S.<x>=LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: R is S
False
sage: R == S
True
```


```
sage: MR=MatrixSpace(R,2,2)
sage: MS=MatrixSpace(S,2,2)
sage: MR is MS
True
```

Since `R==S`, the construction of `MS` will return MR again. So `MS` has `R` as a base, not `S`:

```
sage: MS.base() is R, MS.base() is S
(True, False)
```

After this it's unavoidable:

```
sage: S.0 + R.0
RuntimeError: There is a bug in the coercion code in Sage.
Both x (=x) and y (=x) are supposed to have identical parents but they don't.
```

and you're hitting a more insidious form with

```
sage: MR(R.0)
[x 0]
[0 x]
sage: MS(S.0)
RuntimeError: There is a bug in the coercion code in Sage.
```

Great job tracing this to its origins in 15 minutes!

Just saw this ticket by chance: funniest title ever :-) I should try that to my own tickets too...

Changing keywords from "coercion, lazy-power-series" to "coercion, LazyPowerSeries".

This can be fixed by moving LazyPowerSeriesRing over to the new parent framework.  I'll do this this evening.

A fix is in #15673

Changing status from new to needs_review.

This works now, since #32367.

This isn't something specific to lazy power series, it is an issue for any ring where we can have equal-but-not-identical instances as per Nil's comment:2. We just need to find another instance of this with a different base ring.
