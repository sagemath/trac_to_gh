After #19600 there are still `EXMAPLES`, `EXAPLES` etc. left. They can be found with something like


```
egrep -R 'EX...+::' src/sage | fgrep -v EXAMPLES:: | fgrep -v EXAMPLE:: | fgrep -v 'EXAMPLES ::'
```


or


```
(E: And egrep -R 'PLES ?::' src/sage | fgrep -i -v example founds EXAPLES.)
```


This is a ticket for correcting those. I can do this, but I'll wait #19600 to get into beta.
