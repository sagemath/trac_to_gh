Can we at least put sage-unzip into build/bin/ and not expose it via a sage -unzip command line argument? It has no mathematical purpose, its just an internal tool for building Sage packages.

Oh. Well I have no strong objection to the removal of `sage -unzip`. I just thought that all sage-something had to be exposed as "sage -something". How would you want it to appear?
