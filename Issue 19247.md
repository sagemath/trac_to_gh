# Issue 19247: sage -unzip

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: ncohen

Original creation time: 2015-10-27 13:01:57

As discussed on sage-devel [1], we lack a way to unzip files.

This very short python script does the job.

Right, this was the ticket I meant when I posted in sage-devel on this.

Can we at least put sage-unzip into build/bin/ and not expose it via a sage -unzip command line argument? It has no mathematical purpose, its just an internal tool for building Sage packages.

And I agree that there are lots of stupid command line options like `sage --twisted`. I don't think that means that we should add more out-of-scope commandline options.

I thought that it would make more sense in the general bin folder. This is where one would find 'unzip' if we had chosen to package it.

As Dima raised, one can already find many non-mathematical 'utilities' in the general bin/ folder. Some examples: g++,cython,cythonize,python,scons,git, ...

Oh. Well I have no strong objection to the removal of `sage -unzip`. I just thought that all sage-something had to be exposed as "sage -something". How would you want it to appear?

There is no reason to expose everything as commandline option. There is no `sage --fix-pkg-checksums` (i hope). The script using sage-unzip can just call it directly.

Err... That's #18947.

Okayokay. So I'll remove that line, I do not mind much.
