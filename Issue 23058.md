Towards Python3. The only sensible thing to do right now is to use `cmp_to_key`.

AFAIK, this results in basically the same timings. Although using `WeylGroup` makes the computations really slow, but that is for a followup.

ok, let it be.

If I remember correctly, one can find a key for the Bruhat order somewhere (in type A, summing entries of the matrix left or up to get another matrix), but this would require some work to implement it.
