Here are minor amendments to a few of your corrections.

Change "Theoerem" to "Theorem" in

```
/src/sage/combinat/designs/bibd.py
# Non-existence by BRC Theoerem
```


Change "occurence" to "occurrence" in

```
/src/sage/misc/misc.py
once: keep only the first occurence of any item.
```


Change "improve" to "improved" and change "how about it already" to "go about that yet" in

```
/src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py
# d could be improve to be the exponent of the Galois group rather than the degree, but I do not see how to how about it already.
```



Change "safe" to "save" in

```
/src/sage/symbolic/ginac/mul.cpp
 *  to allow for early cancellations and thus safe memory.
```

Thanks for fixing these typos.  The patchbot failures have nothing to do with this ticket (and I ran `make testlong` with no errors).
