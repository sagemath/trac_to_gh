For Cython code dependending on *optional* packages, we can still run `cython` on that `.pyx` file. The advantage is that breakage due to Cython changes will be detected earlier.

One more advantage of this branch is that optional extensions are listed in between the normal extensions, which is much cleaner.

I cannot really parse your question, but I'll try to answer it anyway: `CythonizeExtension` is exactly like `Extension` except for the `skip_build` attribute. There is some code added to `src/setup.py` which checks this attribute. If `skip_build`, then the build (i.e. the `foo.c` -> `foo.so` part) of the extension is skipped.
