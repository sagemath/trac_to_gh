CC:  @dimpase @jdemeyer @embray @vbraun @jhpalmieri

We propose to create a venv (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) at `$SAGE_LOCAL/venv`, 
to activate the venv in the `sage-env` script, and to install all Python packages (including `sagelib`) into this venv.

This is preparation for #27824, in which the system's python3 will be used when available.

Note, the proposal is to use `venv` (new since Python 3.3), not `virtualenv`. So this change will be limited to Python 3 builds of Sage.

I wonder whether it uses a convoluted way to create python extensions, which got broken.

Minor bikeshed, but why the long path "lib/sage/venv/sage"?  What about something like just "lib/sage-X.Y"; analogously to "lib/python-X.Y"?  We've never had a "lib/sage" before in the first place, so I don't see any immediate need to make the path so much more complicated.

1) "venv" has to be in the path to indicate that it's a venv in the technical sense and not a random place with invitation to install stuff in it.

2) Definitely no versioning.

3) I suppose I could drop the final "sage", making it `lib/sage/venv`

That's correct.
In a fresh install, the first one will be empty.

In an install upgraded from earlier versions, there will be packages in both.
When there's an update, the old version if removed from the first one and the new version is added to the second one.

The ones in `find` and `clean` are I think #31314.

For the failure in `package` I know what to do
