Keywords: sd111

... in analogy of #29864 (sage-tdlib).

To try: `make sagemath_meataxe`

(or `./configure --enable-sagemath_meataxe && make build`)


This is part of #29705: Meta-ticket: Modularize sagelib into separate distributions (distutils packages)

Can you elaborate on what is supposed to be done to use meataxe --- both as a C library, as collection of executables, and as optional Cython extension module?

spkg `meataxe` stays as is. It installs the C library and executables. No dependency on anything from Sage.

spkg `sagelib` will no longer conditionally build the Cython extension module.

Instead, the new spkg `sage_meataxe` will build the Cython extension module. It declares both `sagelib` and `meataxe` as a dependency.

`sage_meataxe`, in the implementation of this ticket, does not have a source tarball (note there is no `checksums.ini`).

So, in order to use it, one has to do `make sage_meataxe`, right? It would automatically install its dependency `meataxe`, would build the corresponding Cython extension module, AND would also build the documentation of the Cython extension module? And `sage -testall` would run the doctests from the corresponding Cython extension module if and only if sage_meataxe is installed, so that there is no need to mark all its tests as "optional"?

If the documentation and test suite would be taken care of, it would indeed be very helpful.
