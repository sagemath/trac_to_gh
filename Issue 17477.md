# Issue 17477: Fix a bug in sorting RealSets

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Find a bug:
{{{ 
sage: RealSet((0, 1),[1, 1],(1, 2))
(0, 1) + [1, 2)
}}}
should return

```
(0, 2)
```

This can be fixed by a modification in `RealInterval.__cmp__`: when comparing two intervals with the same lower bound, put lower_closed before lower_open. i.e. [a, b] < (a, c].

Thanks. Please always include a doctest, and set needs review. I will do it this time and do the review, as well.

This looks fine, tests OK with `make ptestlong`.
