The above commit is a first attempt to add `EuclideanSpace` to the category of metric spaces. It endows the class `EuclideanSpace` with the method `dist()`, which computes the Euclidean distance between two points. However, `TestSuite(E).run()` fails with `_test_metric` because of the name clash between 
- the method `metric()` of `EuclideanSpace`, which is inheritated from `PseudoRiemannianManifold` and which returns the metric tensor (first fundamental form)
- the method `metric()` of `ParentMethods` in `MetricSpaces`, which is supposed to be the distance function.

It seems difficult to change the name of `PseudoRiemannianManifold.metric()`, even with a proper deprecation notice, because it is heavily used and it is the natural name in the context of differential geometry. On the other side, could the parent method `metric()` of `MetricSpaces` be changed to something else? e.g. `distance_function`? Also, it seems quite redundant with the other parent method `dist()`. Indeed, by default, the parent method `metric()` is defined as 

```
        def metric(self):
            return lambda a,b: a.dist(b)
```

with `a.dist(b)` being `self.parent().dist(self, b)`, so at the end of the day, if `M` is a metric space, `M.metric()(a,b)` ends to `M.dist(a,b)`.

I agree.

Overall, this category seems not very well developed, and I would be surprised if it was used much in user code. I think it will be safe to make changes to it (with deprecation).

> e.g. `distance_function`? 

Sounds good to me. But perhaps we can just deprecate the parent method `metric` altogether until a clear need for it arises?

Indeed, I was conflating metric spaces and normed spaces, which should be separated into 2 separate categories (with normed spaces being a subcategory of metric spaces of course).

Just to note: We do have an axiom for connected and the category `Manifolds().Connected()`.

I am -1 for removing the element and parent methods `dist` and the `metric` method. `a.dist(b)` is natural and easier to work with when you don't want to explicitly specify the parent of `a` (and `b`). It is also more conceptual when you don't want to care about the exact metric as long as there is some metric. Similarly, when you want to specify which metric (space) you want to use `M.dist(a,b)` or `M.metric()(a,b)` becomes the more natural choice. Additionally, sometimes you want to explicitly work or pass the metric, so `M.metric()` is something useful too. There should not be any conflict here and having extra (natural) methods doesn't hurt anything.

I would also be wary of saying there is no need just because something is not used in the Sage code: It could be used in a user's code and it feels natural from a teaching perspective. Additionally, me being the (dumb) non-geometer that I am, I would expect asking for the `metric()` of a metric space to return the metric function `d: X x X -> R`.

As Eric said in comment:4, the real issue is the name conflict. From some wikipedia searching, what is currently called a metric in the manifolds code is really a (very common) shorthand name for "metric tensor," whereas "metric" is the standard name for the function that defines a metric space. Of course, the metric tensor allows one to define a metric as Eric said, and it is clear from the context of the different fields what one means. Unfortunately there is not a good way to resolve this other than possibly replacing `metric` with `metric_tensor` in the manifolds code. However, I think it is reasonable to not put the connected Riemannian manifolds in the `MetricSpaces` category because of the computational infeasibility of the metric function.

I agree, but this does not solve the clash issue for `EuclideanSpace`, since the latter is considered as a Riemannian manifold (with a flat metric tensor).

I agree that renaming `metric()` -> `metric_function()` and using that internally is good. However, I might also advocate for doing `metric()` -> `metric_tensor()` in the manifold code as it is basically just one sed command, as well as providing `metric()` as a shorthand.

The slightly trickier question would be should we allow `MetricSpaces` to have `metric()` be a shorthand whose semantics could change?

You explicitly changed the default category to only be differentiable rather than smooth:

```diff
+        if category is None:
+            category = Manifolds(RR).Differentiable() & MetricSpaces()
```

See `sage.manifolds.differentiable.manifold.DifferentiableManifold.__init__`. So I think you need to change

```diff
-            category = Manifolds(RR).Differentiable() & MetricSpaces()
+            category = Manifolds(RR).Smooth() & MetricSpaces()
```
