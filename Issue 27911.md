# Issue 27911: sigma_invariants() bug over FunctionFields

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28148

Original creator: @Loops7

Original creation time: 2019-07-09 20:21:54

Keywords: SI2019

The function `sigma_invariants` in `projective_ds` should be able to work for dynamical systems defined over function fields, but there is a small error in the implimentation. For example, currently this code doesn't work: 

```
sage: F.<t> = FunctionField(GF(5))
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(F,1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem_projective([x^2 + (t/(t^2+1))*y^2, y^2], P)
sage: f.sigma_invariants(1)
```

The functionality looks fine, but there is a small typo. TESTS needs to be followed by two colons.
