Keywords: connected graph, subgraph

Currently the `connected_subgraphs_iterator` returns sets of vertices whose induced subgraphs are connected. Instead, add a parameter `induced` to `connected_subgraphs_iterator`. When `induced` is set to False, the iterator should return the connected subgraphs themselves, rather than the vertices that induce connected subgraphs.

This ticket was opened based on a suggestion from dcoudert on Ticket #32047.

This is a proposal for iterating over all non-induced subgraphs of a graph. I'm not sure that the name of the method is the best choice, but I don't have better proposals.

In my application I have a simple graph `G` with positive integer weights on its edges and an integer `k`. I need to iterate through subset of edges 
- whose corresponding subgraph is connected
- of size at most `k` (the argument `min_edges` works for this)
- of total weight at least `k` (there is no such thing yet)

This ticket is still a good step forward. Thanks.
