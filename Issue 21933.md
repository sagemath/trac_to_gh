This test from documentation : 


```
sage: var('x,y')
sage: plot3d(sin(x-y)*y*cos(x),(x,-3,3),(y,-3,3), mesh=True)
```


works on terminal, `*.sagews` in the cloud, local sage notebooks but... not in Jupyter notebook (both local and cloud-based). Trying it in Jupyter gives an empty `AssertionError`. (Full text of the error in the comment.)

This is happening because `mesh=True` adds a line to the Jmol data file starting with `pmesh` that does not have a quote-enclosed filename at the end of the line, hence the `AssertionError`. The `script` method in `repl/display/jsmol_iframe.py` needs to be modified.
