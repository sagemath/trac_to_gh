Shouldn't a working version of the example go into TESTS?  I'd do it myself -- probably take less time than writing this message! `:^)` -- but I'm not sure of the convention for when you should submit a patch to someone else's patch and don't want to step on toes.

Well... It could, but honestly on such short patches... I mean, this is something which should have been done when the original method was written, and it was forgotten. Adding 5 lines of doctest everytime we fix a mistake sounds a bit too much, even though more complicated bugs may ask for this "additional safeguard". `:-)`

"just my two cents"

I think it's a good idea to add a test.  I probably meant to, but forgot. :-)  Updated patch coming shortly.

New patch posted including a doctest to verify correct behavior, passes tests for graph directory, running -testall now just for fun.

By the way, `@`dsm, I am always happy to have my toes stepped on if it saves time. :-)
