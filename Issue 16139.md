# Issue 16139: Python 2.7.5's distutils pass `-R` to clang

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: leif

Original creation time: 2014-05-17 23:43:40

Keywords: _sqlite3 build import error elliptic_curves

This breaks e.g. building the `_sqlite3` extension module, such that installation of `elliptic_curves` fails as well.

----

Attached patch is as ugly as what's already there.

`_sqlite3` module and `elliptic_curves` were built fine here using clang 3.4.2 (and python 2.7.8) without applying the patch.

So apparently this got fixed upstream (such that the patch does no longer apply anyway?).

Can't check this right now, will probably do later.
