Reviewers should look at the built documentation to catch reST errors that don't stop the build but cause the docs to looks bad. One example: using ``some_code`` for source code instead of ```some_code``` – single quotes cause the contents to be set in math mode, and then the underscore will cause a subscript, which is probably not what was intended.

This is good advice in theory, but I must admit that I don't do this myself. The main reason: I have better things to do with my time than wait for the docbuild to finish. And doing that on a remote machine (where I can easily build or test Sage) is inconvenient since I cannot easily look at the built documentation on a remote machine from my desktop machine. Sad but true...

Minor nitpick about this ticket: mention that hyperlinks should also be checked. Something like "...but that may cause badly formatted output or broken hyperlinks"
