# Issue 26689: Add to the reviewer's checklist: look at the built documentation

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Reviewers should look at the built documentation to catch reST errors that don't stop the build but cause the docs to looks bad. One example: using ``some_code`` for source code instead of ```some_code``` – single quotes cause the contents to be set in math mode, and then the underscore will cause a subscript, which is probably not what was intended.

This is good advice in theory, but I must admit that I don't do this myself. The main reason: I have better things to do with my time than wait for the docbuild to finish. And doing that on a remote machine (where I can easily build or test Sage) is inconvenient since I cannot easily look at the built documentation on a remote machine from my desktop machine. Sad but true...

Minor nitpick about this ticket: mention that hyperlinks should also be checked. Something like "...but that may cause badly formatted output or broken hyperlinks"

I think that many reviewers (and authors) don't do large chunks of what's already in the checklist (for example, run the tests). I think it's appropriate to request this so that it might be on someone's mind when they are reviewing a ticket. For me, if I'm running all of the tests, I just run `make ptestlong` so the docs get built anyway. And as I'm sure you know, you can always do `sage --docbuild reference/homology html` to just build that one part of the reference manual, and that doesn't take very long.

Good idea about hyperlinks.

Note that I didn't actually look at the documentation built by this ticket :-)

Retarging tickets optimistically to the next milestone.  If you are responsible for this ticket (either its reporter or owner) and don't believe you are likely to complete this ticket before the next release (8.7) please retarget this ticket's milestone to sage-pending or sage-wishlist.
