This is 95% finished, there are still some loose ends but I'd like to wait at least for #16997 to be merged before continuing.

One issue: the documentation is not generated by default from a simple `make`. I had to do

```
sage: from sage_setup.autogen import autogen_all
sage: autogen_all(force=True)
```

Another one: the file `auto_gen.pxi` does not appear in the reference manual. The documentation is hence invisible (except the interactive one).

Unfortunately, there is no easy solution for this. If you really think that this should be fixed, we should probably use a `Makefile` instead of a Python script.

It's included in `gen.pyx`, also with the documentation.

It looks globally nice!

There are some bad formatting:
- some `:emphasis:` gets wrong (see `bnrconductor` or `bnrdisc`)
- some `:math:` directives get wrong  (see `binomial`, `contfrac`, `divrem` or `elleta`). Apparently, some backslash disappeared since we have `:math:`binomial(x,y)`` instead of `:math:`\binomial{x}{y}``. Idem in `polgalois`: `TbelongstoQQ[X]`
- the hyperlink to sections via `[Label: se:XYZ]` are very bad (see `factornf`, `fflog`, `fforder`, `galoisfixedfield`, `znlog`, `znorder`)

Some of the issue above looks fine in the `pari.desc` file... might be because of the `gphelp` script. For example

```
$ gphelp -raw binomial
...
binomial coefficient @[dollar]binom{x}{y}@[dollar].
...

$ gphelp -raw polgalois
...
@[dollar]T belongs to @[startbi]Q@[endbi][X]@[dollar]
...
```

On the other hand, the tex documentation with `gphelp XYZ` looks fine.

I can fix the `[Label]` stuff but the rest will require changing the whole approach (not using `gphelp -raw`). What do you think I should do...?

I think that it is already a lot of stuff and not so bad as a first approximation. Do you have an idea to get the right documentation everywhere? Do you understand the part of the `gphelp` script that generates the raw documentation?

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-03-24 07:26:21

I'm not sure that it's a good idea to hack on the `gphelp` script. It's probably better (but scary) to parse the TeX code manually.

I fixed the `[Label]` formatting.

I also manually changed the version of the PARI package, which will cause the auto-generated functions to be regenerated.

NOTE: despite the red link to the branch in the Trac interface, the branch merges cleanly.

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2015-03-31 14:10:16

Some almost clean documentation is much better than no documentation... I will try to see next week with Bill for implementing more options in the `gphelp` script.

The `# coding=utf-8` at the top looks suspicious, is this actually legal?

Slightly different on ARM:

```

Expected:
    Teichmüller character of the :math:`p`-adic number :math:`x`, i.e. the unique
    :math:`(p-1)`-th root of unity congruent to :math:`x / p^{v_p(x)}` modulo :math:`p`.
Got:

The fun is presumably that sys.stdout.encoding in the doctesting framework need not be utf-8

Indeed, see #14153.

Comment by vbraun created at 2015-04-11 09:26:27

At least for now you could change the doctest to `print get_rest_doc("teichmuller").encode('ascii', errors='ignore')`

Works but I would then prefer to always set it in `sage-env` instead of only when doctesting

That would be a very bad idea. We shouldn't interfere with encodings when doing "normal" Sage or Python work.

But we should also have doctests behave like the interactive Sage session. If we can't paste an interactive example into a doctests then we are broken... But then we can always see how many people trip over this.

That's a good goal which we should try to approximate as best as possible, but it will never be 100% possible. I consider terminal encodings to be a operating system-specific issue, so outside the scope of the Sage doctesting framework.

Probably yes. But then you would need to move the code for generating docs from `sage_setup` to `sage`.
