# Issue 10391: Make solve documentation better

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2010-12-08 12:54:27

Assignee: mvngu

CC:  jason burcin dsm benjaminfjones

Keywords: symbolic

To be precise, make sure the documentation at 

```
sage: x.solve?
```

is available from 

```
sage: solve?
```

There are a lot of keywords people are missing out on.

This patch at least begins to fix this issue.  It just copies the most obvious examples.  But I think it will help a lot.

Improvements welcome!  Otherwise, please review.

When applying the patch to my version 4.7, I received the error:

```
applying /home/travis/.sage/temp/euler.math.mc/4600/tmp_0.patch
patching file sage/symbolic/expression.pyx
Hunk #1 succeeded at 7365 with fuzz 2 (offset -44 lines).

Hunk #3 succeeded at 625 with fuzz 2 (offset 2 lines).
1 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/symbolic/relation.py.rej
abort: patch failed to apply

Also, what was left over had some odd spacing issues when checking x.solve?
```

This patch is based on 4.7.1.alpha2.

However, I see in the patch preview that for some reason there is extra whitespace, so I'll have to take care of that sometime.  For now, needs work for that reason.

Wow, I guess we let time forget this.  Surprisingly, it still applies in the important place, and the stuff that doesn't apply is no longer needed.

Updated patch coming up.

Okay, this really needs to get in.  Hopefully a quite easy review.

Looks really good. Thanks for taking care of this. I spotted two very small typos, a reviewer patch is attached. I'll set to positive review once I've checked out the html documentation, but everything looks good from the terminal!
