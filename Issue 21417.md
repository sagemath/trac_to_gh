I think it would be best if this were implemented as an entirely new command--`clean_stale`, say.  Or it could be rolled into the existing `clean` command.  It has a different purpose, but could be done as options to the `clean` command.  #21508 already mentions making the `clean` command work properly.  I've usually found that the built-in `setup.py clean` command is not always as useful as one would like, so it might be worth extending anyways.
