Follow-up from #25486 (Discover `SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR` to make `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage` work from any directory, in an environment without `SAGE_*` variables).

We make sure that `$SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR` appears at the beginning of the `PATH`.  For virtual environments such as those set up by tox (#29950), this may be different from and should take precedence over `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`.  This will ensure that the correct copy of auxiliary scripts such as `sage-eval` is invoked by `sage`.

Using the new script `sage-venv-config` is probably overkill.
If #30888 resolves the symlink of $0, we could just infer the `SAGE_VENV` from its directory.

Why do you actually need go through the trouble of determining `SAGE_VENV` in some shell scripts? Isn't it enough to use `SAGE_VENV = sys.prefix` (which is already done in `env.py`)?

This breaks if `sage_conf` is not installed, because VERSION is defined there

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/sage-venv-config", line 29, in <module>
    _main()
  File "/usr/bin/sage-venv-config", line 17, in _main
    version='%(prog)s ' + VERSION)
NameError: name 'VERSION' is not defined
```

If this is really intended and sage_conf is now mandatory, then ImportError from sage_conf shouldn't be trapped. But I hope it can still be possible to support `sage_conf`-less systems.
