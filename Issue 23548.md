This fixes a few issues, particularly with `clean_stale_files` on Python 3.  In particular, it prevents deletion of valid extension module and Python bytecode files, by better handling of `__pycache__` and the more complex filename extensions used in Python 3.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23785
