Hello !

What is the difference with the existing Chow ring (in `src/sage/schemes/toric/chow_group.py`) ? Are there cases where they are the same and cases where they are not ?

One general remark: it would be much better if what you define would be recognized as a ring by sage. This means that it should become a Parent class, and have an associated Element class. There are some tutorials on how to do that, but you can also look at existing examples.

Travis, would you have a good suggestion for a place to learn about `Parent / Element` ?

Basic remark: the first line in doc of every function should use "imperative" mode, so should contain "Return" (as an order) and not "Returns", and the same for other verbs.

most importantly, your file should be moved in the src/ folder, and more precisely in `src/sage/schemes/toric/`

for the moment, the patchbots will refuse to check your code because of its bad location

Replying to [comment:10 chapoton]:
> Travis, would you have a good suggestion for a place to learn about `Parent / Element` ?

So from a quick look at the code, it seems like it should be a subclass of `CombinatorialFreeModule`. So these tutorials would be relevant:

- https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/modules/sage/modules/tutorial_free_modules.html
- https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/tutorial-implementing-algebraic-structures.html
- (shameless plug for my notebook with code showing how to construct new algebras) https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/TravisScrimshaw/sage_notebooks/sagedays_109_talk.ipynb

This is also a very generic but useful tutorial:

- https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/categories/sage/categories/primer.html

These are all the ones I can think of right now.
