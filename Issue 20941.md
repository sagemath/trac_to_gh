Two typos of that kind _in addition_ in Sage 7.3.rc0 (identical to 7.3 final):

```
src/sage/schemes/generic/algebraic_scheme.py:3703:        OUPUT: an integer.
src/sage/schemes/product_projective/point.py:582:        OUPUT: an integer.
```

Wow, you really edited them _by hand_!?

There are colons missing after `OUTPUT` in `src/sage/combinat/sf/dual.py` and `src/sage/combinat/words/finite_word.py`.  Just looked at the diff though.

I only noticed afterwards the branch is public, and then did the two changes myself.

Unfortunately then I started making some corrections (mostly markup) in addition -- a can of worms at least in the case of `finite_word.py`... 8/

I'll revert the two changes you already made and then push my changes.

Done.

positive review from me on your commit. By the way, we are supposed to start doc with "Return" and not with "Returns". I am not asking you to do another commit (please do not add anything again to this patchbomb ticket), but to remember that in the future.

If you agree with my commits, you can set to positive review.

Please undo your last move. You should not have changed all the "Return" to "Returns"

This codestyle convention is stated there:

Sorry, I missed your previous post.

I actually (also) just normalized the few instances of `Return` to `Returns` because the vast majority of functions and methods in that file uses not just `Returns`, but also `Applies`, `Tests`, `Computes` and the like.

Wasn't aware that finally one form was agreed on, since this discussion happened a couple of times, essentially coming to the conclusion that it should be consistent within a file or package.

I'll try to change everything to imperative form then (although I don't like it, and a mathematician shouldn't either, perhaps except for some very computional ones, since you don't _tell_ a function to behave like this or that, but define its meaning, and a function application _equals_ some expression you obtain by term rewriting -- the only imperative being telling some interpreter or solver to _evaluate_ something according to given definitions).

Ok, done, now addressing the remaining:
 {{{
 6898-    A class to create a callable from a list of words. The concatenation of
 1050-        Alias for ``implicit_suffix_tree()``.
 6943-    A list subclass having a nicer representation for factorization of words.
 5959-        An iterator for :func:`~sage.combinat.rsk.RSK`.
 6298-        Applies the inverse of the phi function to ``self``.
 6253-        Applies the phi function to ``self`` and returns the result. This is
 1061-        Counts the number of distinct factors of ``self``.
 5224-        Counts the number of occurrences of ``letter`` in ``self``.
 1130-        Generates distinct factors of ``self``.
 4927-        Implements Lascoux and SchÃ¼tzenberger `s_i` operator, swapping the
 6084-        Lifts ``self`` via the delta operator to obtain a word containing the
 6328-        Specialized version of ``phi_inv()`` for long or incremental words.
 5498-        Sturmian desubstitutes the word ``self`` as much as possible.
 5651-        Tells whether ``self`` is a factor of a Sturmian word.
 5722-        Tells whether ``self`` is a tangent word.
 6903-        TESTS::
 889-        Tests whether ``self`` has ``other`` as a prefix.
 276-        Tries to return a pair of words with a common parent; raises an
 }}}
 Afterwards will push...

 How about `Alias for ...` and `An iterator for ...`, `Specialized version of ...`?

this ticket is already too large. As I said once before, please keep any new change for another ticket.


---

Comment by leif created at 2016-08-06 19:08:57

Well, my patches are all to the same file; either exclude it completely, or change every occurence.


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-08-06 19:10:20

If you do not mind, I would rather suggest that you split that in another ticket, dealing only with this file.


---

Comment by leif created at 2016-08-06 19:11:29

I would have been happier if I hadn't started changing some while on the original purpose, but noticed too late how large that file in fact is.


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-08-06 19:14:25

if you want, I can take care of the git magic. This should be easy, losing nothing.


---

Comment by leif created at 2016-08-06 19:17:19

Well, just reset hard / push -f (up to) your third commit to the branch, I'll open a follow-up depending on this ticket for my three commits.


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-08-06 19:23:26

done. I just gave a name to my last commit.

you can now just use the branch public/21178 on another ticket, that will depend on this one.

Thanks, reusing the original branch on #21181 is a bit easier.

Although I really liked _EXMAPLES<sup>TM</sup>_ (after all, they're also for _Ex-Maples_).

Branch is red; haven't checked why though.  (It would have been better if this ticket had made it into 7.3 or 7.4.beta0...)

I did the merge, only scalarfield was in conflict. This can remain in positive_review.

Please don't change this branch again, I've now rebased #21181 once more.  (Would have been easier if you simply removed the single hunk touching the file I'm modifying on #21181, as this was the only change causing the dependency.)
