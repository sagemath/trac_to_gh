Patchbot is green, but `FormalSums` is a subclass of `ModuleElement`. So it shouldn't need the decorator.

I do not understand what you say. `FormalSums` is a parent class, not an element class.

Ah, sorry, I mixed it up with `FormalSum`. However, the equality for `DivisorGroup_generic` is equivalent to that of its defining values, which `FormalSums` is a subclass of `UniqueRepresentation`. So it is better to let that handle equality checking and there does not seem to be a reasonable check for inequality. So I would still not add the decorator and instead just get rid of `__cmp__`. This also seems like it will not change the behavior from looking at the subclasses.
