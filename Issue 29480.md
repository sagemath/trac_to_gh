Keywords: cubic Hecke algebra braid group

Cubic Hecke Algebras are factors of the group algebra of the Artin braid groups, such that the images `s_i` of the braid generators satisfy a cubic equation:

```
    s_i^3 = u s_i^2 - v s_i + w
```

Here `u, v, w` are elements in an arbitrary integral domain and `i` is a positive integer less than `n`, the number of the braid group's strands. By the analogue to the
[Iwahori Hecke algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwahori%E2%80%93Hecke_algebra) ([Sage class](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/algebras/iwahori_hecke_algebra.html?highlight=iwahori%20hecke#module-sage.algebras.iwahori_hecke_algebra)) in which the braid generators satisfy a quadratic relation these algebras have been called *cubic Hecke algebras*. The relations inherited from the braid group are:

```
    s_i s_{i+1} s_i = s_{i+1} s_i s_{i+1} \mbox{ where } 1\leq i < n-1 \mbox{ and }
    s_i s_j = s_j s_i \mbox{ where } 1 \leq i < j - 1 < n - 1.
```

If the ring elements `u, v, w`  are taken to be `u = v = 0, w = 1` the cubic Hecke algebra specializes to the group algebra of the [cubic braid group](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/groups/sage/groups/cubic_braid.html?highlight=cubic%20braid#module-sage.groups.cubic_braid),
which is the factor group of the Artin braid group setting the generators order to be three.

More information on these algebras can be found in ["A  MAXIMAL  CUBIC  QUOTIENT  OF  THE  BRAID  ALGEBRA"](http://www.lamfa.u-picardie.fr/marin/arts/GQ.pdf) and the references given there.

This ticket implements a class to work with them. It uses [data files](http://www.lamfa.u-picardie.fr/marin/representationH4-en.html) supplied by Iwan Marin for a basis of the cubic Hecke algebras up to 4 strands and corresponding regular representation matrices. The implementation is experimental with respect to the following two aspects:

1. In a technical sense, since this class will cache results in the file system, for example: images of braids to accelerate the calculation of images of longer braid words or products of basis elements.
2. In a mathematical sense, since the cubic Hecke algebra on more than 4 strands is not equipped with an appropriate basis (not even an algorithm to produce a flat basis according to Iwan Marin's work on the five strand cubic Hecke algebra).
   At the moment, the "basis" for the algebras on more than 4 strands grows randomly (starting from the one from the data files) according to the users action, without any guarantee that this would lead to a generating set behaving good under specializations.

In general, it would be desirable to replace the dependence on the data files by algorithms implemented in this class. This would make sense as soon as such algorithms have been found which cover the case of five strands, as well.


The code is spread over two existing directories: `src/sage/algebras/hecke_algebras/, src/sage/databases` and two new sub directories in the former one: `base_rings_of_definition` and `matrix_representations`. Both of the new directories contain just one module. Their purpose is to describe the special properties of matrix representations and base rings concerning the cubic Hecke algebra. Thus, in the latter case the corresponding module contains special classes for the most general base ring of the algebra (called the *ring of definition*) and a corresponding ring for the coefficients of the split irreducible matrix representations.

From the point of view of the algebra the ring of definition must not necessarily contain the roots of the defining cubic equation. Thus, it is defined by `\Z[u, v, w, w^(-1)]` where the indeterminates are taken from the coefficients of the underlying cubic equation `x**3 - u*x**2 + v*x - w`. But, concerning the split irreducible representations the roots (in Ivan Marin's papers often denoted `a, b, c`) are needed, and in addition a third root of unity (for the nine-dimensional representations of the cubic Hecke algebra on 4 strands). Accordingly, this ring is realized as a Laurent polynomial ring in `a, b, c` over `\Z` adjoined with a third root of unity. It can be considered as an extension of the ring of definition, more precisely as the [link ticket splitting algebra] of the cubic equation.

These both classes of base rings posses a method `create_specialization` which allows the user to consider cubic Hecke algebras over other base rings. Thus, the user may choose his own coefficients or roots of the cubic equation as long, as they define a valid ring homomorphism from the corresponding generic base ring.

The module for the matrix representations contains enum classes to specify the type of the representation (left regular, right regular, split irreducible) and to specify a certain irreducible. Furthermore, it implements parent and element classes for a faithful representation (at least in the case of less than 5 strands) in block diagonal structure with irreducibles blocks (in the case of that representation type).

Everything that has to do with the access to the data files and the file cache is implemented in `src/sage/databases/cubic_hecke_db.py`. The data files are stored in `local/share/cubic_hecke_marin/` and the file cache in `$HOME/.sage/db/cubic_hecke/`. The former ones are created via the sage-package `cubic_hecke_marin` (from the attached tarball) at build time and the later one at runtime.

After a long break I do some major changes, now:

1.  As announced in the previous comment I change the integration of the database. It now consists of a static part covering the cubic Hecke algebras on at most 3 strand (according to the demonstration cases of the KnotInfo database) and an [optional extension](https://pypi.org/project/database-cubic-hecke) serving for the larger algebras. It can be installed via `pip`. The branch of this ticket represents the stand alone part so that the patchbots will check that everything is o.K. if the optional package is not present. In order to test the integration of the optional package I will open another ticket which will be tested via [GitHub](GitHub) actions.

2. I add another functionality to obtain Markov traces on the cubic Hecke algebras (method `formal_markov_trace`). 

3. I change the construction of the base ring of definition using localization of multivariate polynomial ring over the integers after this is available now.

4. A lot of improvements concerning style and documentation.

Shouldn't the database ticket be a dependency of this one?

I don't think we need the subfolders `base_rings_of_definitions` and `matrix_representations` since they effectively only contain one file.

There is one failure reported by the patchbot that needs to be fixed:

Some `Returns` -> `Return` in docstrings.

For `TestSuite`, you can implement `some_elements()` with the more interesting elements too.

Perhaps instead of `CubicHeckeRingOfDefinition`, maybe `CubicHeckeUniversalRing`? The term "ring of definition" is a bit strange to me, and a bit too generic of a name.

For `extension_ring()`, I think the extension ring should be the one setting the coercions rather than that method. It feels strange that the method is doing something that the class should "know" how to do.

There are some `$` in the docstrings to become ```.

Saying `optional default:` is redundant. I would remove `optional`.

```diff
-    TESTS:
+    TESTS::
 
         sage: CHA3 = algebras.CubicHecke(3)
         sage: TestSuite(CHA3).run()
```

Instead of setting `self._names = names`, I think it is better to pass it up to the `CombinatorialFreeModule.__init__`.

I will probably have more comments as I go further through the code, but this (still) is a very nice piece of code that I am looking forward to getting merged into Sage.

So what place do you suggest for these files? I didn't want to have them inside `hecke_algebras` since they describe no Hecke algebras for themselves.
Furthermore, these directories could be used in future, for example if we implement a wrapper around CHEVIE's cyclotomic Hecke algebras. Many of these have specific demands for their generic base rings and all come along with matrix representations.

At the moment the test for associativity already takes long time with one (interesting) element (for the algebra on four strands up to half an hour, if the filecache is empty). I fear that will increase a lot if there are more elements.

I would place them in there because they are used to create the Hecke algebras in question. I don't see what difference it makes for it being a subfolder as it just adds more complexity to the file hierarchy.

If it makes sense to do this because the files in that directory become sufficiently complicated, then we can do it then. However, where we are now, it makes things more cumbersome, not less.

Something like this perhaps:

Q1: Universal wrt to what?\\
A1: A Hecke algebra with a universal base ring\\
Q2: What is its universal base ring?\\
A2: See Q1.

Personally I think we get a more explicit chicken-and-egg-problem with "ring of definition." I also would not know how to make sense of this ring from the name. Well, it isn't anything that needs to be changed.

Convinced! I will do that on a next step.

Yes, that's the point!

I add an according explanation to the docstring.

Additionally, since `E` should be a `UniqueRepresentation`, there should not be any caching in `e()` (which can and usually does) create memory leaks. `E` should allow itself to be removed from memory when there is no way to obtain it from the current references. Basically it is about moving the line:

I misunderstood that because I was looking at the wrong `extension_ring` method (that of `CubicHeckeAlgebra`). I have fixed this, now.

The former commit removes the last dependency on the Sage library from the file-cache (it now consists of nothing else than dictionaries, lists, tuples, integers and strings).

The expected behavior for the patchbot which did the two jobs for this ticket would be to raise the new exception. All other patchbots should be green.
Is there a way to clean `SAGE_DOT` files on that special patchbot?

The [GitHub jobs](https://github.com/soehms/sage/actions/runs/2094438982) running on the commit with the dropped directories look good.

Thanks a lot, Travis! It's much improved, now!

> Can the result of `formal_markov_trace` ever be `0`? 


Yes (at least for elements which are not braid images):

```sage
sage: CHA3 = algebras.CubicHecke(3)
sage: CHA3.inject_variables()
Defining c0, c1
sage: d = c0 * ~c1 * c0 * ~c1 - ~c0 * c1 * ~c0 * c1; d
v/w*c0*c1^-1*c0 + (-u)*c0^-1*c1*c0^-1 + ((-v)/w)*c1*c0^-1*c1 + u/w*c0*c1*c0^-1*c1 + u*v/w*c1*c0^-1 + ((-u^2)/w)*c0*c1*c0^-1
sage: fmt = d.formal_markov_trace(); fmt
0
sage: fmt.parent()
Free module generated by {U1, U2, U3, K4} over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in u, v, w, s over Integer Ring localized at (s, w, v, u)
```

I think it's o.k. as it is, right?

No problem! Good thinks take time. Also, compared to the size of the branch and the amount of other reviews you do, I don't think that you are slow.


Reading your changes I found some more typos which I fix in the previous commit. Furthermore, since we now have the Links Gould polynomial I add a check of the formal Markov trace against it.

If the above happens, then it will return an `int`. Actually, I guess this could be fixed by simply doing `M.sum()` instead of `sum()`.

Thank you. Although thinking a bit more, is there a reason why we want the `formal_markov_trace()` to be a vector space element? Mainly, I am wondering if it makes sense to have `U1`, `U2`, `U3`, and `K4` be generators of a multivariate polynomial ring.

I would say: no (since the default of `sparse` in `to_vector` is `False`).

Anyway, this change can not be wrong. But benchmarks show a remarkable difference:

```

with `M.sum()`:

```sage

Actually, my first version was like that. But I think the module version is closer to the mathematical structure.

Okay, then we don't have to worry too much about this.

Actually, that gives me an idea for another micro-optimization that I have done.

Something has been cached the result for the top computation from the bottom. I first ran the `sum` and then the `M.sum`. Both times I got

```
CPU times: user 1.16 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 1.16 s
Wall time: 1.16 s
```
but the first time took noticeably longer; by my estimate around 5s.

I have changed the line altogether in my recent push.

No, there is no need to make it more complicated like that. It is more if you would expect the user to specialize the aforementioned parameters. Being a CFM element means that is not "easy" to do (it isn't hard, but it takes a little more thought than just `p.subs()`).

You are right, that is loading the coefficients for the 4-strand Markov trace from the database.

Great! With your current changes I now get:

```
sage: CHA4 = algebras.CubicHecke(4)
sage: %time CHA4.one().formal_markov_trace()
CPU times: user 5.81 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 5.81 s
Wall time: 5.88 s
B[U4]
sage: t = CHA4(KnotInfo.K9_42.braid())
sage: %time t.formal_markov_trace()
CPU times: user 15.6 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 15.6 ms
Wall time: 25.5 ms
((-u*v^2*s^4-u*v^3*s^2+v*w*s^4+v^2*w*s^2+u*v*w^2)/(w^3*s))*B[U1] + ((u^2*v^2*s^2-u*v*w*s^2)/w^3)*B[U2] + ((-v^2*s^2+u*w*s^2-u*v*w+w^2)/(w^2*s))*B[K4] + ((u*v^2-v*w)/w^2)*B[K4U] + ((v^2-u*w)/w^2)*B[K6]
```

That's correct. I'll think about a way to make it more convenient for the user (after my vacation, which will be in the next two weeks), for example, supporting the definition of a map. But I think that might be a follow-up ticket.

Great! Very good improvement. Thanks a lot again!
