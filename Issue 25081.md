Yes, I think so.

In the present case, I don't really see how without changing the implementation of p-adics, but if you have an idea I'd love to hear it!

Do you think it would be break anything if we modified the p-adic `is_zero()` and `is_one()` without touching `==`, though? While it can be argued that `==` is an “internal” operation on each parent (using it in combination with coercion is known to be dangerous anyway), whose semantics could vary from parent to parent, I really don't see anyone calling `is_one()` and expecting it to return `True` on anything but the exact unit element, even for p-adics... And I guess that change already would be enough to make most generic algorithms work on p-adics.

Perhaps it should always return `False`, or perhaps it should return `True` when the element is one up to the maximum precision of the ring... I guess it depends how you want generic objects to behave. For example, what should be the degree of a polynomial whose leading term is O(p<sup>k</sup>)?

> Currently, I think that the exact p-adic one does not exist in Sage (except for floating point arithmetics). So are you saying that `is_one` should always return `False`? Or that exact p-adic elements have to be implemented?

I don't know. Perhaps it should always return `False`, or perhaps it should return `True` when the element is one up to the maximum precision of the ring... I guess it depends how you want generic objects to behave. For example, what should be the degree of a polynomial whose leading term is O(p<sup>k</sup>)? When should multiplication by “zero”, resp. “one” yield `R.zero()`, resp. the other operand?

My personal philosophy is that a should be considered as equal to b as soon as they are indistinguishable (which is the current behavior), but I agree that this has disadvantages as well.

I'm not sure that it's a good idea to let `a == 1` have a different meaning than `a.is_one()`. Personally, I consider the two constructions as equivalent.

Thanks a lot for your comments--and sorry for taking so long to reply, you caught me at a bad time!

I assume you mean in `_add_`? But even so I don't understand the question: this line is under `if d.is_unit()`, and I'm dividing by `d` (or trying to) when that's not the case.

Replying to [comment:59 saraedum]:

A few lines below, the whole fraction is zero.

See the discussion above: I think it is correct over most inexact rings (RR, RDF, RBF, RIF, CC, CDF, CBF, CIF, SR... and constructions over them), but apparently not over p-adic rings, unfortunately. For want of a proper solution, I'm now using this logic over exact rings only.

I dropped the test because I didn't realize this behavior of `is_zero()` and `is_one()` was something the p-adics people actually wanted. I have restored it in the rebased branch.

Strictly speaking it isn't, but that's because we're unable to reduce over that ring, hence there is no point in trying again later. (Cf. the comment in front of the initial definition of `_is_reduced` in `__init__()`.)

I think you are right, `is_reduced=self._is_reduced` would be better in these cases.

AFAICT it is the other way around: the try-excepts that are present in some cases are leftovers from a previous version and are unnecessary.

See above for the other points.
