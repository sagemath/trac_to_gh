Yes, I think so.

In the present case, I don't really see how without changing the implementation of p-adics, but if you have an idea I'd love to hear it!

Do you think it would be break anything if we modified the p-adic `is_zero()` and `is_one()` without touching `==`, though? While it can be argued that `==` is an “internal” operation on each parent (using it in combination with coercion is known to be dangerous anyway), whose semantics could vary from parent to parent, I really don't see anyone calling `is_one()` and expecting it to return `True` on anything but the exact unit element, even for p-adics... And I guess that change already would be enough to make most generic algorithms work on p-adics.

My personal philosophy is that a should be considered as equal to b as soon as they are indistinguishable (which is the current behavior), but I agree that this has disadvantages as well.

I'm not sure that it's a good idea to let `a == 1` have a different meaning than `a.is_one()`. Personally, I consider the two constructions as equivalent.

Something I'm using times to times is to add a named argument (I usually use `secure` but it can also be `exact`, it's possibly better). If `secure` is true, then `a == b` returns false (or raises an error) if one cannot assert that they are equal for sure; otherwise, it behaves as it does currently.

In gcd, why is `self.__class__(self._parent, rnum*sden + rden*snum, rden*sden, coerce=False, reduce=False, is_reduced=True)` necessarily reduced? You then divide by `d` but in the `except:` case, it won't be reduced, right?

I assume you mean in `_add_`? But even so I don't understand the question: this line is under `if d.is_unit()`, and I'm dividing by `d` (or trying to) when that's not the case.

Strictly speaking it isn't, but that's because we're unable to reduce over that ring, hence there is no point in trying again later. (Cf. the comment in front of the initial definition of `_is_reduced` in `__init__()`.)

I think you are right, `is_reduced=self._is_reduced` would be better in these cases.

AFAICT it is the other way around: the try-excepts that are present in some cases are leftovers from a previous version and are unnecessary.

See above for the other points.
