Let `\Fq` be a finite field and `K` be an `\Fq[X]`-field. Let `\phi` be a
Drinfeld `\Fq[X]`-module over `K`. We denote `\mathcal{E}(\phi)` to be the
field `\Kbar` endowed with the standard `\Fq[X]`-module law `(P, z) \mapsto \phi_P(z)`. We call it the _module_ associate to `\phi`. A Drinfeld module
isogeny `u: \phi \to \psi` gives rise to an `\Fq[X]`-module morphism `\mathcal{E}(u): \mathcal{E}(\phi) \to \mathcal{E}(\psi)`; `\mathcal{E}` is a
covariant fonctor.

We propose to create a class `DrinfeldModuleModule` that is a parent
representing `\mathcal{E}(\phi)` and whose elements — instances of
`DrinfeldModuleModuleElement` — are elements of `\mathcal{E}(\phi)`. We would
define the action of `\Fq[X]` on those elements. We would also create a class
`DrinfeldModuleModuleMorphism` to represent the morphism `\mathcal{E}(u)`. String representation of elements in the module should differ to that of
elements in `\Kbar`, to avoid confusion.


```
    sage: # phi is a Drinfeld Fq[X]-module over K
    sage: module = phi.module()  # Get the module associated to phi
    sage: z = module(a)  # a is an element in Kbar
    sage: a
    a
    sage: z
    a * e_phi
    sage: P = X^2 + X + 1
    sage: P * z  # phi_P(z), the action of P on z
    (a^(q^2) + a^q + a) * e_phi
```


As the algebraic closure `\Kbar` is not always implemented, we suggest that the
method `DrinfeldModule.module` takes an optional `K`-algebra `L` as an argument
and returns `L` with its `\Fq[X]`-module structure.

This supplements the job of `DrinfeldModuleAction`, which we suggest to remove
(see ticket #33713). The module is a dual of the motive associated to a Drinfeld
module (ticket ???) but the two constructions are independent. We propose to
work on those tickets once the main ticket (#33713) is merged.

We also wish to implement torsion spaces of a Drinfeld modules. This will be
the job of a new, future ticket.

This is part of an ongoing work with Xavier Caruso.
