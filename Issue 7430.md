I'm marking this positive review since it is just an spkg with a bunch of positive reviewed code in it.

Actually, in light of #7417, wait for sagenb-0.4.3.

OK, so, I refreshed the sagenb-0.4.2 to contain also the patch from #7417, which is awaiting review.  When that gets a positive review, then 

   http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/sagenb/sagenb-0.4.2.spkg

can go in.
