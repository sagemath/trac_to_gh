# Issue 23210: faster conversions from number field to interval field

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23447

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2017-07-17 08:55:41

The conversion of number field elements to real interval field is slow (that was actually the main reason for the slow down constated in #23388). We implement a method `_real_mpfi_` on them (and refactor a bit `__richcmp__()` and `floor()`). This improves the overall performance of anything using approximation.

Most are because of #23402... so they are fixed there.
