It gets ugly with library conflicts, so more libraries available on the system should be used instead of ones shipped by Sage, e.g. `freetype` is a good example. Freetype may be used by R packages, and they in turn might depend on other system libraries we don't even know about, cf. e.g. #27163.

I actually do not know how to deal with freetype's deps: bzip2, libpng (and zlib - not explicitly listed, but a dep of libpng).

Naturally, if we have to build any of these, we cannot use a system's freetype.

Which brings up the need for a proper dependencies resolver, and raises the question whether we are doing all this right. 

IMHO a better plan would be to spin off some, and then all,
non-python deps of Sage into a separate (auto-tools) project/package, which builds and installs them into SAGE_LOCAL (just the autotools `--prefix` parameter).
This would allow this to be gradual, once the initial setup, with just a handful already `spkg-configure.m4`-ed packages spun off.
The advantage is that the dependency resolution would be a natural top-down thing.

Well, perhaps bundling is a wrong word, but the idea is that once you removed a lot of stuff from Sage, you need means to build few missing pieces in a coherent way.
The complexity of doing this inside Sage is too much, in particular due to inflexible and a bit broken dependency resolution we have.

I don't see why this always be the case. E.g. our current libgd is pretty old, and 
it does not need dependencies as new as provided by Sage (e.g. bz2). So the host system might have its own libgd, matching our version requirements, and spkg-configure.m4 would tell Sage to stay with the system's libgd. Yet, a newer libgd dependency, bz2, required by Sage for some reason, gets built by Sage. Oops, now we have system's libgd that might get mis-linked to Sage's bz2, or, worse, stuff gets broken during loading at runtime
(or, even worse, gets subtly broken and result in wrong results).
This is really playing with fire.

Often (freetype is a good example) Sage dependencies get updated just because something breaks on version N of BlaFoo OS, without much regard to whether this might break
Sage on version N-1 of BlaFoo OS (often, but by no means always, it is meant to continue working...).

Thinking more about it, I should take a part of my comments above back - I have not quite understood the whole scheme of things. 
It now seems to me that as soon as an spkg blah gets an spkg-configure.m4, all of its dependencies must have get it too, and then autoconf would do its magic just fine.

That is, for freetype this means that also libpng and bzip2 must also get spkg-configure.m4's. Thus the title change.

I agree with this ofc.  If for some reason Sage (or really some other dependency of Sage) specifically needs some recent-enough libbz2 (for example) then we really need to check for that version on the system (either by actual version number, though better by feature checks if possible).  If not found, then we have to build our own copy.
