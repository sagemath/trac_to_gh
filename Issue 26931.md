It gets ugly with library conflicts, so more libraries available on the system should be used instead of ones shipped by Sage, e.g. `freetype` is a good example. Freetype may be used by R packages, and they in turn might depend on other system libraries we don't even know about, cf. e.g. #27163.

I think we already have a generic ticket about this, so let's have this one just focus specifically on freetype.

We can probably reuse much of this.

I actually do not know how to deal with freetype's deps: bzip2, libpng (and zlib - not explicitly listed, but a dep of libpng).

Naturally, if we have to build any of these, we cannot use a system's freetype.

Which brings up the need for a proper dependencies resolver, and raises the question whether we are doing all this right. 

IMHO a better plan would be to spin off some, and then all,
non-python deps of Sage into a separate (auto-tools) project/package, which builds and installs them into SAGE_LOCAL (just the autotools `--prefix` parameter).
This would allow this to be gradual, once the initial setup, with just a handful already `spkg-configure.m4`-ed packages spun off.
The advantage is that the dependency resolution would be a natural top-down thing.

I understand what you're saying and have thought about this problem as well, albeit without a completely clear solution. On the one hand I think it should be possible to use a system package regardless of its dependencies. On the other hand it is asking for trouble doing something like, as in your example, building a bz2 for Sage, but then using a libfreetype from the system which was compiled against its system libbz2.

This was less of a problem when this mechanism was used only for a handful of packages that didn't live somewhere deep in the package dependency graph (the old configure.ac checked for these packages in more or less arbitrary order, and that is still the case unfortunately.

I don't agree with your idea of bundling a bunch of packages together but I'm not sure I understand it either. I think there are a couple things to do here:

Using the freetype/bz2 example again: if we add a spkg-configure.m4 for one package, we should also do so for all its build dependencies. That way, assuming they are detected properly, it will properly use the system packages for the entire dependency tree rooted at freetype.

However, I should also add some logic to SAGE_SPKG_COLLECT (likely with an external helper script) to actually load the package dependency graph and do these checks in a reasonable such that we don't even try to use a package from the system unless we've already detected all its dependencies from the system.

Well, perhaps bundling is a wrong word, but the idea is that once you removed a lot of stuff from Sage, you need means to build few missing pieces in a coherent way.
The complexity of doing this inside Sage is too much, in particular due to inflexible and a bit broken dependency resolution we have.

I don't see why this always be the case. E.g. our current libgd is pretty old, and 
it does not need dependencies as new as provided by Sage (e.g. bz2). So the host system might have its own libgd, matching our version requirements, and spkg-configure.m4 would tell Sage to stay with the system's libgd. Yet, a newer libgd dependency, bz2, required by Sage for some reason, gets built by Sage. Oops, now we have system's libgd that might get mis-linked to Sage's bz2, or, worse, stuff gets broken during loading at runtime
(or, even worse, gets subtly broken and result in wrong results).
This is really playing with fire.

Often (freetype is a good example) Sage dependencies get updated just because something breaks on version N of BlaFoo OS, without much regard to whether this might break
Sage on version N-1 of BlaFoo OS (often, but by no means always, it is meant to continue working...).

Thinking more about it, I should take a part of my comments above back - I have not quite understood the whole scheme of things. 
It now seems to me that as soon as an spkg blah gets an spkg-configure.m4, all of its dependencies must have get it too, and then autoconf would do its magic just fine.

That is, for freetype this means that also libpng and bzip2 must also get spkg-configure.m4's. Thus the title change.

I agree with this ofc.  If for some reason Sage (or really some other dependency of Sage) specifically needs some recent-enough libbz2 (for example) then we really need to check for that version on the system (either by actual version number, though better by feature checks if possible).  If not found, then we have to build our own copy.  And my point is that in that case we then need to also, at least by default, build all other dependencies that depend on that libbz2, regardless whether they can otherwise be found on the system.

Here the reason would be to avoid nasty surprises for people installing Sage in weird places. 

Actually, while I was at it

```
$ bzip2 --version 2>&1 | sed -n -e 's/bzip2.* Version *\([[0-9]]*\.[[0-9]]*\.[[0-9]]*\).*/\1/p'
