This comes up from an internal(?) email where it was asked that log scale plots should have automatic expansion of the axis if there are not enough ticks. The current behavior is to raise an error.

The attached patch implements this feature and works as long as the user doesn't provide too few ticks via the `ticks` option of `show()`. This patch should work well with the following plots, all of which fail without this patch:

```
sage: plot_loglog(x, (1,10)).show(xmin=10, xmax=1)
sage: list_plot_loglog(zip([1, 10], [0.5, 6.0]))
sage: list_plot_loglog(zip([2, 3], [3, 4.0]), base=2)
sage: list_plot_loglog(zip([2, 10], [0.5, 4.0]))
```

This patch fixes #13340 too.

Hi ppurka!

In principle, they should both curtail the plot (in different directions, of course).  But only the second one does.

Neither one of these plots axes, but they don't raise the error.  With putting one tick each, then we are fine.  But I'm not sure what we really want here.

(I'm not going to bother with the rebase because right now it just is removing a few removals of whitespace, so all one has to do is do `hg qrefresh` and that's it.)

This is #13368. The xmax when passed on to show works.

The behavior is the same without this patch, except that the second plot fails without this patch and passes with this patch. So this is some other bug.

Hmm, that makes sense.  Yup,

```
plot_loglog(x^2,(x,1,100),base=10).show(xmax=1.1)
```
> The behavior is the same without this patch, except that the second plot fails without this patch and passes with this patch. So this is some other bug.

Thanks.

Okay, how about these?

```
p = list_plot(range(1, 10), plotjoined=True)
p.show(scale='loglog')
```
Only one major tick

```
p = list_plot(range(1, 10))
p.show(scale='loglog')
```
no horizontal axis at all!

Haha! Those two plots are a classic but crafty examples of GIGO! `list_plot(range(1,10),...)` implicitly implies that we are plotting `list_plot(zip(range(0, 9), range(1, 10)),...)`.

Change the plots ever so slightly to the following and everything is fine and dandy

```
sage: rrr = range(1, 10)
sage: list_plot(zip(rrr,rrr), plotjoined=False, scale='loglog', size=20)
sage: list_plot(zip(rrr,rrr), plotjoined=True, scale='loglog')

The auto-expand is wonderful, but I don't think we should try to second-guess the user if he specifies the ticks manually. It's inconsistent with the rest of plotting, and annoying to be honest. It also doesn't in any way prevent me from creating a misleading plot.

I'm posting a patch on top of ppurka's that does two things:

* Removes the error when ticks are specified manually
* Factors get_vmin_vmax out into a separate method. It "fits" better where it was, but by making it a separate method, we can take advantage of the documentation/testing stuff that's already in place. I added a docstring and a few examples to show how it works.
