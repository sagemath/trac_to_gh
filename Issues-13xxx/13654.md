Thanks for contributing! I've had a look at your code. It looks like a good implementation of the algorithm in the article. I don't know much about quadratic forms, so I can't really say much about the math.

My most important review point is that your doctests don't cover all your code paths. The examples you give already have a diagonal inner product matrix, so all but the first step are not being tested.

In fact, the other code paths contain `1/2 in R` which I'm not sure will work as you seem to expect. I think it will just throw a `ZeroDivisionError` if 2 is not a unit. You could replace it by `R(2).is_unit()`.

I'll set this ticket's status to needs_work.

Here's a few additional suggestions to make your code more concise by using a few Python gimmicks:

* Instead of

```
E = self.basis()
f = []
for i in range(len(E)):
    f.append(E[i])
```
 for copying a list, you can write

```
f = self.basis()[:]
```
* You could implement a function `T(x,y)` because you use that expression a lot. It makes the code a lot more readable.

* Usually, you shouldn't need to have loops like

```
for i in xrange(len(f)):
    # do something with f[i]
```
   because you can write

```
for f_i in f:
    # do something with f_i
```

* One hard part is the sorting prescribed by
> Otherwise, let (i, j) with 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n be such that ord T(e_i, e_j) is minimal, taking i = j if possible and if not taking i minimal.

 I've found a way to implement that using the builtin `sort`. Namely, this is equivalent to sorting the tuples `(valuation, int(i != j), i)` lexicographically.

I've attached a patch including these comments.
