There seems to be a typo in the following section of the code. The variable `thislList` should be `thisList`. Don't know what it affects or if this variable is really needed to be reset.

```
                            if u in thisList:
                                best = depth*2-1
                                thislList = set()
                                break
```

Is this line really needed? I hadn't looked at what would be affected, if anything was indeed affected, when this typo is fixed. Is there an example of a graph where fixing the typo would actually affect the calculation of the girth?

Well, actually this line gets executed each time an odd cycle is found. The line :

```
best = 2*depth -1
```
is the only one that can set best to an odd value. The other one is 

```
best = 2*depth
```
I do not remember what it does at the moment.

I'm pretty sure I wrote this thing myself, but I find it *very* uncommented for what it does `:-/`

Oh, right. It is meant to do a "continue" on the loop ``for w in self.vertex_iterator():`` but you cannot do that. You cannot break two levels of loops at once. And actually, it is totally useless :

```
sage: s = set([1,2,3,4,5])
sage: for i in s:
...      print i
...      s=set([1])
1
2
3
4
5
```

So we can remove it... God, this code is bad. SOrryyyyyyyyyy `:-/`
