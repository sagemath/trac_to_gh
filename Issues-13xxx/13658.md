There seems to be a typo in the following section of the code. The variable `thislList` should be `thisList`. Don't know what it affects or if this variable is really needed to be reset.

```
                            if u in thisList:
                                best = depth*2-1
                                thislList = set()
                                break
```

<a id='comment:4'></a>Well, actually this line gets executed each time an odd cycle is found. The line :

```
best = 2*depth -1
```
is the only one that can set best to an odd value. The other one is 

```
best = 2*depth
```
I do not remember what it does at the moment.

I'm pretty sure I wrote this thing myself, but I find it *very* uncommented for what it does `:-/`
