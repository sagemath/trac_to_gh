With tickets #715, #11521, #12215, #12313, parent structures don't have eternal life anymore the way they used to have. That affects run-times, because chances are much higher now that the parent has to be rebuilt, whereas before, it was just looked up in a cache. It would be nice if we can mitigate much of this.

Ideal here, but given\nthe peculiar choices of primes, rarely all that useful in practice.\n\nWith the stricter collection, these spaces need to be created time and again.\nHowever, the number of times that covariant_functorial_construction gets called\nis *insane*.

(I've tried, these numbers seem representative).\n\nI have no explanation for what is faster here. Perhaps just some dictionary\nlookups that happen faster now thanks to 'MonoDict' and 'TripleDict'.\n\nSo apart from `echelon_form` being really badly tuned for its choice of\nalgorithm, what do we do about this parent construction? Should sage keep a\ncache of useful finite fields and be a little more restrained in its choice of\nprimes (promoting reuse of these finite fields)?",

This example seems fairly typical:

```
def test1(N,B,t):
    for i in range(t):
        m=matrix(QQ,N,N,srange(N*N)).echelon_form()

%prun test1(20,40,10^3)
```

You can see where a lot of that time is going: In category construction stuff.
The reason is simple: It's trying some multimodular approach. So there are all
kinds of matrix spaces over various finite fields involved. Previously, these
structures remained in memory, cached and ready for reuse. Ideal here, but given
the peculiar choices of primes, rarely all that useful in practice.

With the stricter collection, these spaces need to be created time and again.
However, the number of times that covariant_functorial_construction gets called
is *insane*. That almost looks like something needs to be constructed for
*every element*.

On the plus side, if we run instead

```
def test1(N,B,t):
    for i in range(t):
        m=matrix(QQ,N,N,srange(N*N)).echelon_form(algorithm="classical")

%prun test1(20,40,10^3)
```
we get with 5.3b2

so it's actually faster! (I've tried, these numbers seem representative).

I have no explanation for what is faster here. Perhaps just some dictionary
lookups that happen faster now thanks to 'MonoDict' and 'TripleDict'.

So apart from `echelon_form` being really badly tuned for its choice of
algorithm, what do we do about this parent construction? Should sage keep a
cache of useful finite fields and be a little more restrained in its choice of
primes (promoting reuse of these finite fields)?

Would it be useful to have a switch for `TripleDict` and `MonoDict`, such as `strong_cache_on()`, `strong_cache_off()`? The idea is that after calling `strong_cache_on()`, every item put into a `TripleDict` or `MonoDict` and every item created by `weak_cached_function` (such as `UniqueRepresentation`) and every item created with `UniqueFactory` is prevented from deletion by adding a strong reference, and `strong_cache_off()` deletes the strong references created since last calling `strong_cache_on()`, so that only the weak references remain and stuff becomes collectable? 

Perhaps that could even become a context, so that the computation of the echelon form could be like

```
   with strong_cache:
      <the multimodular code>
```

Concerning startup, I think 37 objects are easy to take care of. Perhaps one should add a strong reference to them in the modules creating them.

Since the profile above seems that an insane number of calls to `is_subcategory` is to blame for at least half a second, I took a look at it. As expected, it's recursive! And if you put a little print statement

```
        print "is_subcategory(self=%s,C=%s)"%(self,C)
```
it's pretty scary to see how often the system goes off on a investigation of completely trivial questions. For instance, just the line

```
N=20; matrix(QQ,N,N,srange(N*N)).echelon_form()
```
triggers 140 lines like

```
is_subcategory(self=Category of subquotients of monoids,C=Category of commutative rings)
is_subcategory(self=Category of subquotients of semigroups,C=Category of commutative rings)
is_subcategory(self=Category of subquotients of magmas,C=Category of commutative rings)
is_subcategory(self=Category of subquotients of sets,C=Category of commutative rings)
...
is_subcategory(self=Category of subquotients of semigroups,C=Category of fields)

The next big one seems to be `matrix_space.py:230(__init__)` which is costing us `0.572` cumulative and seems absent on plain 5.3b2. That's correct, because all these matrix spaces that are used for multimodular computation are now destroyed an reconstructed everytime, whereas before they remained in permanent cache. Setting `gc.disable()` helps a bit: 

```

so apparently some spaces get stuck in cycles, but not all.

... it *is* cached, mainly.

Do we talk about the same version of sage? Namely, with #11943, the set of super categories is created once and for all, stored as an attribute, and then testing subcategories just amounts to testing set containment. And before merging #11943, I think `is_subcategory` has even been a cached_method, by #11900 (but I could be mistaken here, I didn't verify it), so that the work also just amounted to a dictionary lookup.

Before looking into the set of supercategories, `self.is_subcategory(c)` calls `c._subcategory_hook_(self)`. The idea is that `c._subcategory_hook_` is a quick (!!) test that allows to avoid the creation of the whole set of supercategories (which can be a bottle neck) in many cases. See #11943 for examples where that helps.

Since `_subcategory_hook_` is not mentioned in your profiling, I assume that it isn't problematic. And then, `self.is_subcategory` can hardly be problematic either.

Actually I am pretty much sure that the categories involved in that computation are all different (namely, algebras over different base rings or so). If they are all different, then what could be done about it? One could improve the `_subcategory_hook_`, or (if creation of parent_class is the problem) use #11935 (whose patch currently needs to be rebased).

> Indeed, when you do that, you quickly get NO PRINT STATEMENT AT ALL anymore, so it seems that at least my first assumption is about correct.


The question is: Where did you put the print statement? Namely, the actual work is done in `_subcategory_hook_` and in the lazy attribute `_set_of_supercategories`. Can you include the print statement there, rather than in is_subcategory?

> The next big one seems to be `matrix_space.py:230(__init__)` which is costing us `0.572` cumulative and seems absent on plain 5.3b2. That's correct, because all these matrix spaces that are used for multimodular computation are now destroyed an reconstructed everytime, whereas before they remained in permanent cache.


My impression is that this is more of a problem then `is_subcategory`. And it illustrates what I meant when I changed the title of this ticket: The matrix spaces should be strongly cached *during echelon computation*, because they will be used repeatedly.

The question is whether we look into the code and do that manually. Say, by creating a list of all matrix spaces occurring in the computation, where the list either resides on module level (if the matrix spaces are used in different functions/methods) or locally (if there is just a single function creating these matrix spaces).

Or perhaps it is easier to create a context that prevents matrix spaces (or *all* weak values) to be temporarily strongly cached.

That said: There are precisely two `_subcategory_hook_` methods involved in that computation: The default one of Category, and the one of `JoinCategory`. I don't see how they could be improved, except by cythonisation.

Here is how one can cythonise the default `_subcategory_hook_`. The time for testing subcategories drops clearly. Without patch:

```
sage: C = Algebras(ZZ)
sage: R = Rings()
sage: %timeit R.is_subcategory(C)
625 loops, best of 3: 3.14 µs per loop
sage: %timeit C.is_subcategory(R)
625 loops, best of 3: 3.4 µs per loop
```
With patch:

```
sage: C = Algebras(ZZ)
sage: R = Rings()
sage: %timeit R.is_subcategory(C)
625 loops, best of 3: 1.97 µs per loop
sage: %timeit C.is_subcategory(R)
625 loops, best of 3: 2.1 µs per loop
```

However, that doesn't much improve the performance of

```
sage: def test1(N,B,t):
....:     for i in range(t):
....:         m=matrix(QQ,N,N,srange(N*N)).echelon_form()
....: 
```
which (together with the fact that _subcategory_hook_ does all the work in this example) shows that the problem is not in the subcategory test. Hence, my patch is off-topic.

I just notice: Apparently in your example, the is_subcategory function is not the usual one (sage/categories/category.py), but the one in sage/categories/covariant_functorial_construction.py.

It says

```python
    def is_subcategory(self, C):
        """
        .. todo:: doctests + explain why this method is needed
        """
        if C is self:
            return True
        return any(X.is_subcategory(C) for X in self._super_categories)
```
Actually I wonder why is it needed, myself.

Nicolas, is it not possible to use the default is_subcategory, by #11943?

Anyway, I think the real speed-up will not come from is_subcategory, but from a more intelligent caching.

The following is on top of sage-5.2.beta3 plus #12313 and its dependencies.

When I remove the custom is_subcategory method in covariant_functorial_constructions.pyx, and apply [attachment:trac_13400_subclass_hook_cython.patch], I get

```
sage: def test1(N,B,t):
....:     for i in range(t):

sage: %time test1(20,40,10^3)
CPU times: user 7.04 s, sys: 0.06 s, total: 7.09 s
Wall time: 7.11 s
```
When I apply my patch but keep the covariant functorial constructions as they are, I get

```
sage: def test1(N,B,t):
....:     for i in range(t):
....:         m=matrix(QQ,N,N,srange(N*N)).echelon_form()
....: 
sage: %time test1(20,40,10^3)
CPU times: user 7.38 s, sys: 0.06 s, total: 7.44 s
Wall time: 7.45 s
```
When I do nothing on top of #12313, I get

```
sage: def test1(N,B,t):
....:     for i in range(t):
....:         m=matrix(QQ,N,N,srange(N*N)).echelon_form()
....: 
sage: %time test1(20,40,10^3)
CPU times: user 7.58 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 7.60 s
Wall time: 7.63 s
```
Again, it isn't exactly a break-through. I didn't time it pre-#12313, yet.

In that case you might want to check if that ticket was properly merged in the
5.3b2 source, as available in `sage.math.washington.edu:/home/release`.

What I see is
`sage/categories/covariant_functorial_construction.py:359`: (**EDIT:** removed `@cached_method` line which was my addition that I accidentally copied here as well)

```python
    def is_subcategory(self, C):
        """
        .. todo:: doctests + explain why this method is needed
        """
        if C is self:
            return True
        return any(X.is_subcategory(C) for X in self._super_categories)
```
if I add  `print("is_subcategory(self=%s,C=%s)"%(self,C)")` as a first statement
I get the lines as listed above.

[**EDIT:** removed, because I gave a sample above]
 
a lot of them, and as you can see, all "static" categories. None of those funny
dynamically generated ones. If I decorate with `@cached_method` I get these
lines at startup but not afterwards anymore.

`make ptest` improves (5.3b2 + tickets + cached is_subcategory):

```
Total time for all tests: 989.4 seconds
Total time for all tests: 994.4 seconds
```

multimodular echelonization loop (5.3b2 + tickets + cached is_subcategory):

```
         1263618 function calls (1229625 primitive calls) in 5.191 seconds
```
The profile looks as above. I'm puzzled as to why I'm no consistently getting 2-3 seconds worse than before. Did some recompilation put things in unfortunate spots?

**Strongly caching matrix spaces**: Wouldn't help much with the current design.
The primes used in some of the multimodular steps are randomized, so even when
doing the same computation, you'll end up with other rings.

It might be an idea to keep a cache of good fields for multimodular stuff, that
get used before trying random primes. That at least saves creating the fields.
Caching the matrix spaces might be painful, since you don't know which
dimensions you'll need...

Hm, simply deleting `is_subclass` from `CovariantCategory` leads to a similar speedup:

Oops, honestly I don't remember at all; I should have done this todo!
I am actually surprised that it went into Sage with this comment in.

In any cases: if all tests pass after removing this method, please go
ahead.

Yes, I was talking about the is_subcategory method in sage/categories/category.py. I didn't know that the covariant functorial constructions have their own method (which may be deletable, according to Nicolas, provided tests pass)

Just for clarification: The `@`cached_method is your addition, isn't it?

Anyway. If deleting the method is an option, then we should try it. After all, it isn't cached *at all*, in contrast to what is done in the default is_subcategory method. Plus, if it turns out that my experimental patch gives more speed, I may consider to make it a proper patch.

If I remember correctly, improving the initialisation of finite fields was part of #11900.

We could consider to put stuff from `sage.rings.quotient_rings.QuotientRing_generic.__init__` or `QuotientRing_nc.__init__` directly into `sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod_ring.IntegerModRing_generic.__init__` and `sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_prime_modn.FiniteField_prime_modn.__init__`.

And we should test whether "small" finite fields shouldn't better be cached. I see that the *elements* of an `IntegerModRing` of order less than 500 are cached. But the rings themselves are *not* cached:

```
sage: id(IntegerModRing(123))
79926512
sage: import gc
sage: gc.collect()
673
sage: id(IntegerModRing(123))
78943376
```
versus

```
sage: R = IntegerModRing(123)
sage: R(12) is R(12)
True
```

Hence, I suggest that `IntegerModRing.__init__` puts the ring into a strong cache, if it would also cache the elements.

With a prudently chosen bound, this would probably not lead to excessive memory use. I'm wondering whether there's any benefit, though. For elliptic curve computations and other arithmetic-geometric things there might be: One often has to look at the reduction modulo *all* primes below a certain bound, so if one does so repeatedly, the gain can be substantial. This might explain why the elliptic curves code is relatively sensitive to these things. Although I think the most heavy duty applications of this get seconded to GP/Pari wholesale anyway, so would not involve sage finite fields at all.

It would not help multimodular stuff at all, though, because there one usually choses primes that are as large as possible while still allowing for the fastest arithmetic on the processor.

Usually one would randomize the choice of moduli, to amortize the cost of choosing "wrong" moduli. However, that's only theoretically wise. For an actual application, when you choose a prime a little below 2<sup>31</sup> (or whatever you need to still be able to do a full mult and do a mod computation afterwards. REALLY worth delving into your CPU's instruction set to see if a "mult into two 64-bit registers" combined with a "remainder of 128 mod 64 bit number" exist, because it gives you twice the number of bits for almost the same price -- hopefully we are already using libraries that do that for us), it's NEVER going to be a bad one, so using it all the time's not bad (OK, on a 4GHz machine in a computation that takes 10<sup>6</sup> cycles, it would be happening about 1.25 times a month)

What might be a good idea is to have a

```
GoodPrimesForMultiModularComputationsIterator()
```
which could always start with giving primes from a fixed set (in fixed order or not) and then continue with generating new ones. If we strongly cache the fields belonging to those first ones, we'd get most of the benefit at limited memory cost.

Of course it does mean changing all prime selection loops for multimodular stuff to using this iterator. 

The next bit is tuning the crossover points between naive/multimodular/padic methods for most of these.

The main thing this does is mitigate the effects if finite field construction cannot be made lightning fast in general. We still need conversion between ZZ and GF to be lightning fast, even if that means special casing this in relevant code paths. It's nice if derived conversions between matrix algebras and polynomial rings would be similarly fast.

OOPS! Turns out the default algorithm for these matrices is "padic", which is a bad choice as these examples show. It's particularly bad for low rank examples such as this one. If we take a vandermonde matrix, it's a little better

```
def test1(N,t):
    L=[[i^j for i in [1..N]] for j in [1..N]]
    for i in range(t):
        m=matrix(QQ,N,N,L).echelon_form()
```
but multimodular is a clear winner. There the fields DO get generated in a deterministic order:

```
sage.matrix.matrix_modn_dense.MAX_MODULUS
p=previous_prime(sage.matrix.matrix_modn_dense.MAX_MODULUS)
while ...:
   ...
   p = previous_prime(p)
```
so if it were an issue we should store finite fields for some of those p (and also for `sage.matrix.matrix_modn_sparse.MAX_MODULUS` for good measure).
Indeed:

```
sage: import gc
sage: def test1(N,t):
....:         L=[[i^j for i in [1..N]] for j in [1..N]]
....:     for i in range(t):
....:             m=matrix(QQ,N,N,srange(N*N)).echelon_form(algorithm="multimodular")
....:

sage: gc.collect()
523
sage: FieldCache=[]
sage: N=sage.matrix.matrix_modn_dense.MAX_MODULUS

523
sage: %time test1(20,10^3)

sage:

```
so it seems that with Thierry's code fixed, constructing the matrix rings 
is the only measurable overhead in this. And I don't think we can intelligently
cache those.

The REAL surprise is that in the padic variant the primes get selected via this
little pearl:

```
     p = previous_prime(rstate.c_random() % (MAX_MODULUS-15000) + 10000)
```
Random numbers are very expensive! So just changing that (in two places) to a
simple `p = previous_prime(p)` reduces the time SIGNIFICANTLY and in practice of
course behaves just as well, unless you have a particularly nasty adversary
(perhaps draw from a pool a bit larger than just the primes in sequence?).

In short, after picking off the `is_subcategory` problem, I don't think this
example is telling us much more than that the choice of algorithm in
`echelon_form` can use some tuning. Its preference for `padic` over
`multimodular` might be premature and was probably induced by William's euphoria
about discovering a really neat trick. As he documents, it should be used on
matrices with large entries.

Futhermore, perhaps the implementation of
`padic` is placing a little too much emphasis on properly emulating randomness.
That's probably a little less of an issue for matrices for which the algorithm
is suited, but I don't think one gets real benefit out of using such high
quality randomization.

I suspect there are some places we can benefit from more tuned/intelligent
coding and caching, this piece of code is not giving huge pointers where ...
Perhaps one should profile some examples in elliptic curves and see how much
time is spent in coercion/creation of parents.

Perhaps the routine I wrote for extracting the execution times of the individual tests was wrong. I tried again. In the following, I give the time t1 in sage-5.2.beta3 versus the time t2 with #12313 and the patch from here, followed by the name of the test.

In the following tests tests, patched sage is slower by at least 5 seconds with a regression of at least 15% (`t2>=1.15*t1`):

```
  18.40 vs.  24.80: sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/modular/hecke/submodule.py
  15.10 vs.  24.50: sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/modular/abvar/homspace.py

  27.80 vs.  38.30: sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/schemes/toric/chow_group.py
  23.80 vs.  30.00: sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/modular/abvar/abvar.py
 111.30 vs. 141.60: sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/plot/plot.py

  58.00 vs.  71.80: sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/modular/overconvergent/hecke_series.py
  20.60 vs.  25.80: sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/matrix/benchmark.py
  22.50 vs.  27.50: sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/modular/modsym/ambient.py
  38.70 vs.  45.70: sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padic_lseries.py
  23.00 vs.  28.00: sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/modular/modsym/space.py
   9.00 vs.  19.00: sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/combinat/sf/sfa.py
  29.50 vs.  50.20: sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/combinat/partition_algebra.py
  35.50 vs.  44.30: sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/quadratic_forms/quadratic_form__local_representation_conditions.py
   2.00 vs.  12.00: sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/structure/coerce_dict.pyx
  20.40 vs.  26.20: sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/modular/modform/element.py
```

Here are the tests that became faster in the patched version by at least 3 seconds, improving by at least 7% (`t1>=1.07*t2`):

```
 101.20 vs.  93.40: sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/calculus/riemann.pyx
  48.90 vs.  43.80: sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/lie/weyl_character_ring.rst
  68.30 vs.  41.10: sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/interfaces/expect.py
  33.30 vs.  28.70: sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_curve_isogeny.py
  67.30 vs.  54.90: sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/heegner.py
```

The worst regression seems to be in devel/sage/sage/combinat/partition_algebra.py, a regression of more than 70%: `(50.2-29.5)/29.5`. So, perhaps one should start to see what is happening there.

The worst change in cumulative time (it would probably be better to sort the profile data on that to see which part of the code is responsible - after that you can see which callees from that code use much time) seem to be in

```
set_partition.py:221(_iterator_part)
set.py:603(__init__)
```
but not that the NUMBER of calls here isn't much different, so it doesn't look like we're creating parents that much more often here (that would always show up in python profiles, right?) On the other hand, `lazy_attribute` has shown up, costing 5 seconds in total (and getting called a LOT), and those do tend to live in the category system, right?

Ah, and I finally found what the slash means and what `primitive calls` means. Those are *nonrecursive* calls, i.e., for recursive functions the *entry* into the recursion. In particular

```
488462/247161    3.742    0.000    5.013    0.000 lazy_attribute.py:506(__get__)
```
means `488462` total calls, `247161` of which are primitive. Glancing over the code gives me the impression this code might indeed be looking up further attributes (there's an mro loop)

I can imagine that these attributes take more time if they get called the first time on a parent, so perhaps this showing up IS an indication new parents are being made.

I experimented a bit further, towards an improved initialisation of finite fields.

I have already mentioned the idea of caching small fields: The elements of a small field are cached, hence, why should one not cache the field itself? That's in [attachment:trac_13400_cache_small_rings.patch]

And I created a short-cut for building ideals in ZZ. That's useful, because one needs an ideal in ZZ while initialising a finite field. It has a noticeable effect. With only the first two patches:

```
sage: %time L = [GF(p) for p in prime_range(100000)]
CPU times: user 5.25 s, sys: 0.06 s, total: 5.30 s
Wall time: 5.32 s
sage: timeit("ZZ.ideal(5)", number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 84 µs per loop
sage: timeit("ZZ.ideal(5)", number=5000)
5000 loops, best of 3: 90.5 µs per loop
sage: timeit("ZZ.ideal(5)", number=5000)
5000 loops, best of 3: 99.6 µs per loop
sage: timeit("ZZ.ideal(5)", number=5000)
5000 loops, best of 3: 122 µs per loop
sage: timeit("ZZ.ideal(5)", number=5000)
5000 loops, best of 3: 134 µs per loop
```

**Note that the time constantly drops - why is that?**

With all three patches:

```
sage: %time L = [GF(p) for p in prime_range(100000)]
CPU times: user 4.42 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 4.46 s
Wall time: 4.47 s
sage: timeit("ZZ.ideal(5)", number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 68.7 µs per loop
sage: timeit("ZZ.ideal(5)", number=5000)
5000 loops, best of 3: 76.1 µs per loop
sage: timeit("ZZ.ideal(5)", number=5000)
5000 loops, best of 3: 86.8 µs per loop
sage: timeit("ZZ.ideal(5)", number=5000)
5000 loops, best of 3: 98.1 µs per loop
sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod_ring import quick_ZZ_ideal
sage: timeit("quick_ZZ_ideal(5)", number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 2.89 µs per loop
sage: timeit("quick_ZZ_ideal(5)", number=5000)
5000 loops, best of 3: 2.87 µs per loop
sage: timeit("quick_ZZ_ideal(5)", number=5000)
5000 loops, best of 3: 2.89 µs per loop
sage: timeit("quick_ZZ_ideal(5)", number=5000)
5000 loops, best of 3: 2.86 µs per loop
sage: timeit("quick_ZZ_ideal(5)", number=5000)
5000 loops, best of 3: 2.82 µs per loop
```
Hence, the quick way of creating an ideal is much faster, and when using it in the creation of finite fields, it yields a speed-up of `(5.25-4.42)/5.25`, which is about 16%.

In a next step, one could try to unravel the `QuotientRing.__init__` in the finite field initialisation.

Are you taking the following into account?

```
sage: GF(13) is Integers(13)
False
```
The multimodular code I have seen uses `Integers(p)`, not `GF(p)`.

I did not quite understand the following:

```
sage: R=Integers(13); k=GF(13)
sage: a=R(1); b=k(1)
sage: R is k
False
sage: type(a); type(b)
<type 'sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_int'>
<type 'sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_int'>
sage: parent(a+b) is k
True
sage: R.has_coerce_map_from(k), k.has_coerce_map_from(R)
(False, True)
```
So `k` seems to be the more canonical in the eyes of sage. But why the difference between `k` and `R` at all?

Apparently I do, since the timings improve in the same way:
Without [attachment:trac_13400_quick_ZZ_ideal.patch] one has

```
sage: %time L = [Integers(n) for n in srange(10000)]
CPU times: user 4.36 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 4.40 s
Wall time: 4.42 s
```
With the patch, one has

```
sage: %time L = [Integers(n) for n in srange(10000)]
CPU times: user 3.38 s, sys: 0.08 s, total: 3.46 s
Wall time: 3.47 s
```
Hence the speedup is `(4.42-3.47)/4.42`: about 21%

Actually I have wondered about that, myself. I guess it is just a tribute to very old code. IIRC, someone (William Stein?) argued as follows: It is actually typical that coercion goes from "less structure / simpler" (e.g. from a base ring) to "more structure / more complicated" (e.g., to a polynomial ring or to a matrix space over the base ring).

And: If we have an object O in some category (say, GF(5) in the category of fields), and an object X that is obtained from O by a forgetful functor (say, Integers(5) in the category of rings), and we have a in O and b in X, then we typically want that a+b belongs to the "richer" structure - otherwise, we would have worked in X right away.

Above, I mentioned `ZZ.ideal(5)` becoming slower and slower with each iteration. I can narrow it down a bit more

With sage-5.3.beta2, #12313 and the patches from here, I get

```
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 46.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 49 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 50.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 52.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 54.7 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 56 µs per loop
```
In *unpatched* sage-5.3.beta2, one gets

```
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 15.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 15.8 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 38.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 38.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 25.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 15.8 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 15.8 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 29.8 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 15.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 35.3 µs per loop
```

I thought this was supposed to be fixed with #13370. but sage-5.3.beta2 plus #12313 plus the patches from here plus #13370 yields:

```
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 47.1 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 49.1 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 51.1 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 53.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 54.7 µs per loop
```

My impression is that, again, caching is to blame. Namely, since the weak caches from #715 and #12313 compare by identity, not equality, repeating `ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)` does put many copies of 5 into the cache (integers are not unique).

But have we not recently dealt with the same problem on another ticket? I currently can't find it.

I have updated the last two of my patches. The doctests should all pass with them.
