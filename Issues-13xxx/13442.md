Currently, to add gcd functionality for a new polynomial ring, one needs to add a specialized subclass of `PolynomialElement`.

The attached patch allows rings to provide a `_gcd_univariate_polynomial` method which will be called by `PolynomialElement` to compute gcds.

This is similar to #10635.

Is this part of some style recommendation?  I would say referring to `self` in the docstring is perfectly acceptable, since there is an object called `self` and it is usually clear what kind of object it is.  Personally, I strongly prefer `self` over constructions like "this element".

I have been asked on different tickets to replace `self` with something more appropriate. Sage is not really consistent with this.

I do not really care how we do this in sage. Either way is fine with me.
