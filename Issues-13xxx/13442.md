Currently, to add gcd functionality for a new polynomial ring, one needs to add a specialized subclass of `PolynomialElement`.

The attached patch allows rings to provide a `_gcd_univariate_polynomial` method which will be called by `PolynomialElement` to compute gcds.

This is similar to #10635.

Replying to [saraedum](#comment%3A3):
> I want to remove `self` from the docstrings.

Is this part of some style recommendation?  I would say referring to `self` in the docstring is perfectly acceptable, since there is an object called `self` and it is usually clear what kind of object it is.  Personally, I strongly prefer `self` over constructions like "this element".

I agree with [#comment:5 pbruin] on `self` versus `this polynomial`. I find the documentation clearer with `self`, and this seems to be more consistent with the rest of Sage. 

Tell me what do you think of this, I'll positive review the ticket then. All tests passed with the current commits.

Replying to [bruno](#comment%3A15):
> I agree with [#comment:5 pbruin] on `self` versus `this polynomial`. I find the documentation clearer with `self`, and this seems to be more consistent with the rest of Sage.

Both approaches have their drawbacks. `self` makes it harder to read if you do not know about python, i.e., if a 'user' consults the help. 'this polynomial' makes things slightly more difficult to understand if you know about `self`.
I have been asked on different tickets to replace `self` with something more appropriate. Sage is not really consistent with this.

> Tell me what do you think of this, I'll positive review the ticket then. All tests passed with the current commits.

I do not really care how we do this in sage. Either way is fine with me.

I actually haven't a strong case for or against any of both solutions. I could have set it to positive review earlier, so let me do it now!
