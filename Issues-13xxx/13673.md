I plan to include some features of GAP's package kbmag in finitely presented groups. So there would be several options:

1) Make a separated spkg with kbmag alone.
2) Include it in the gap-packages spkg.

There is also an issue with the fact that, since kbmag makes use of external code, doesn't work seamlessly with libgap (yet).

I have made a separate spkg, in case you want to test it:
http://poincare.unizar.es/mmarco/kbmag-0.2.spkg

It is made to work with gap-4.5.6 (see #13211).
