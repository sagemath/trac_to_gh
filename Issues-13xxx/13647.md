Currently, elements of extensions of Qp/Zp can not be initialized from polynomials in some cases:

```
sage: K = Zp(3)
sage: R.<u> = K[]
sage: L.<u> = K.extension(u^2 + 1)
sage: L(R.gen())
u + O(3^20)

sage: K = ZpCA(3)
sage: R.<u> = K[]
sage: L.<u> = K.extension(u^2 + 1)
sage: L(R.gen())
NotImplementedError

sage: K = ZpFM(3)
sage: R.<u> = K[]
sage: L.<u> = K.extension(u^2 + 1)
sage: L(R.gen())
NotImplementedError
```

The attached patch fixes this.
