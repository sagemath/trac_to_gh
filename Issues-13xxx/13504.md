Right now, `sage.misc.latex_macros` evaluates lots of things on startup. The attached patch modifies this: after the patch, the list of LaTeX macros is only computed when asked for.

There needs to be a corresponding change in sagenb: [pull request](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/96)


Depends on #13717

`latex` has more uses than just `latex(x)`, which is part of the problem: `latex.blackboard_bold(...)` uses `sage_latex_macros`. If we define `latex = LatexCall()`, then we lose

```
latex.add_macro                             latex.extra_macros
latex.add_package_to_preamble_if_available  latex.extra_preamble
latex.add_to_mathjax_avoid_list             latex.has_file
latex.add_to_preamble                       latex.mathjax_avoid_list
latex.blackboard_bold                       latex.matrix_delimiters
latex.check_file                            latex.pdflatex
latex.engine                                latex.vector_delimiters
```
With the patch, we should only have to do `LatexCall()(x)` a few times, in latex_macros.py; elsewhere, we can just use `latex(x)`.

Just noticed that I accidentally applied it to sage-5.3, not 5.4.beta1. Does indeed work fine on the newest version. Patch looks good to me.

Maybe I can interest you in reviewing #13361 which improves the measurement of the startup time?
