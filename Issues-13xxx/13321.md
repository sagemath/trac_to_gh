This is ok:

```
sage: (ZZ^2).hom([[2,3],[3,6]],QQ^2) 
Free module morphism defined by the matrix
[2 3]
[3 6]
Domain: Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
Codomain: Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
```
This should not be possible: 

```
sage: (QQ^2).hom([[1/3,1/4],[1/3,1/6]],ZZ^2)
Free module morphism defined by the matrix
[1/3 1/4]
[1/3 1/6]
Domain: Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
Codomain: Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
```

This should work

```
sage: (ZZ^2).hom([[1/3,1/4],[1/3,1/6]],QQ^2) #goes boom with an error you might have excpected in the previous example
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```

This should defenitly also not work:

```
sage: (GF(7)^2).hom([[20,0],[0,21]],ZZ^2)
Free module morphism defined by the matrix
[6 0]
[0 0]
Domain: Vector space of dimension 2 over Finite Field of size 7
Codomain: Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
```

The following should give a clue what is going wrong:

```

sage: (GF(7)^2).hom([[1/3,1/4],[1/3,1/6]],QQ^2)
Vector space morphism represented by the matrix:
[5 2]
[5 6]
Domain: Vector space of dimension 2 over Finite Field of size 7
Codomain: Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
sage: _.matrix().parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Finite Field of size 7
sage: (QQ^2).hom([[1/3,1/4],[1/3,1/6]],ZZ^2)
Free module morphism defined by the matrix
[1/3 1/4]
[1/3 1/6]
Domain: Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
Codomain: Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
sage: _.matrix().parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Rational Field
```
Seems that somewhere the domain and codomain are messed up.

D'oh!
Indeed. 

Hopefully nobody reads my question.
It is still incorrect in recent sage 7.6, beta 4.

As an update to this ticket as of Sage 8.9, this appears to be almost fixed by now. The incorrect example:

```
(QQ^2).hom([[1/3,1/4],[1/3,1/6]],ZZ^2)
```

Now gives an error (`no conversion of this rational to integer`), and the example which is correct:

```
(ZZ^2).hom([[1/3,1/4],[1/3,1/6]],QQ^2)
```

Does work. The part of this ticket that seems to be still relevant is the fact that the following does *not* give an error:

```
sage: (GF(7)^2).hom([[20,0],[0,21]],ZZ^2)
Free module morphism defined by the matrix
[20  0]
[ 0 21]

Codomain: Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
```

as mentioned above, since it doesn't make sense to coerce from `GF(7)` to `ZZ`. This is still something to fix
