```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,sparse=True)
sage: a = x^100000000
sage: -a     # very very long time
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
KeyboardInterrupt
```

The reason is that `a._neg_()` tries to construct the list of all coefficients of `a`. The attached patch fixes this.

Hi Xavier,

Your patch looks good to me. 

You should change the status of the ticket to "need review" (so that I can then change it to "positive review").
