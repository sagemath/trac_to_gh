At the moment, running `make` runs `make doc`, which in turn runs `make doc-html`. This runs Sphinx without the `-j` option, so MathJax (or jsMath, pre #9774) is not used: png image files are used instead. Using png images is much slower, so we should use MathJax (or jsMath) by default.

Timing and disk space information:

Tutorial without MathJax: 

```
$ rm -rf devel/sage/doc/output
$ time sage --docbuild tutorial html
...
real 2m17.950s
user 1m29.441s
sys 0m15.478s
$ du -s -h devel/sage/doc/output
3.9M output/
```
With MathJax:

```
$ rm -rf devel/sage/doc/output
$ time sage --docbuild tutorial html -j
...
real 0m9.871s
user 0m6.530s
sys 0m1.739s
$ du -s -h devel/sage/doc/output
 8.5M output/
```
When building all of the documentation, the disk space actually drops, going from about 320M (without MathJax) to about 295M (with).

Here's a question.  I've noticed that sometimes looking at MathJax stuff when I'm not on the internet is less than great.  What is the story then?

But this certainly looks right.

Maybe something should then also be added to the developer or installation guide (wherever the make options are documented other than in the Makefile) that points out how *not* to use MathJax in a build.   Like to do `make build doc-html` or whatever the correct syntax would be.

- pass the "no-pdf-links" option only when building the website document, so its presence (or lack) on the command-line doesn't cause the reference manual to be rebuilt.

I had a problem with Latex creating thousands of errors on CentOS 4.7 (an old version of Linux, which I need to run for some commercial software). See discussion at:

http://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-devel/7erAQRbHYUU

At John Palmieri's suggestion, I run:

```
$ rm -rf SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/output
$ sage --docbuild all html -j
```

and the documentation built OK, with no errors.

Hi John,

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A18):
> Great. Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

I'm running into some problems. Here are what I did: on a fresh 5.4.rc0, I
made a clone and imported the two `v2` patches. Then I removed the
`doc/output` directory and issued a

```
sage -docbuild reference html
```
After that some pages are perfectly Ok but for some other (I can't find a
pattern) there is a line in the bottom saying

```
Loading [MathJax]/fonts/HTML-CSS/TeX/png/imagedata.js
```
And after somehow ten seconds the text changes to

```
File failed to load: file:///home/data/Sage-Install/sage-5.4.rc0/devel/sage-doc/doc/output/html/en/reference/_static/fonts/HTML-CSS/TeX/png/imagedata.js
```
Indeed the file doesn't exists on my filesystem. By the way, I'm using
Firefox 15.0 on openSuSE 12.1 64 bits.

Am I missing something trivial ?

Cheers,

Florent

Hi Florent,

I have no idea. I tried on my machine (OS X). I browsed through 10-20 pages of the reference manual and saw no problems. Does this depend on this ticket? If you don't apply the patches and run

```
sage -docbuild reference html -j

do you see the same problem?

```

I still don't know what's going on with this. On several systems (OS X and sage.math.washington.edu), I don't see this.

For items on Sage's list that aren't recognized by MathJax, I looked at how they were used in the Sage library.

Here is one thing I found: compare http://www.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/numtheory_rsa.html and
the corresponding page in your output, somewhere in the middle:

```
Formally, let

Σ={A,B,C,...,Z}

be the set of capital letters of the English alphabet. Furthermore, let
```
On your pages (and also on my own build with this patch), the formula \Sigma={A,B,C,...,Z} is broken (viewed on OSX10.6.8, with Chrome or with Safari). Namely, 
it looks like Σ={\textttA,\textttB,\textttC,...,\textttZ}, with \texttt typeset in red.

In the source I see

```
.. MATH::

    \Sigma
    =
    \{ \texttt{A}, \texttt{B}, \texttt{C}, \dots, \texttt{Z} \}

```
which look like 100% kosher TeX to me.

Can you fix this in `MathJax` config?

> Can you fix this in `MathJax` config?

This appears to be a mathjax bug, of sorts, according to [google](http://www.mail-archive.com/wikibugs-l@lists.wikimedia.org/msg134519.html).
If I put the following into `Macro:` section of `mathjax_sage.js` in `output/html/en/thematic_tutorials/_static/` then it displays just right (`textfs` and `emph` are added just for good measure, as they suffer the same fate, apparently).

```
texttt:             ['\\mathord{\\tt{\\text{#1}}}',1],
textsf:             ['\\mathord{\\sf{\\text{#1}}}',1],
emph:               ['\\textit{#1}',1]
 ```

apparently this should be added to the appropriate `mathjax_sage.js_t` file, although how to rebuild the docs to take care of this change this way, I don't know. If someone tells me this, I could come up with a patch.
