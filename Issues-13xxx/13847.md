Replying to [malb](#comment%3A12):
> was only this patch applied?

No, this was on top of a trial version of sage-5.7.beta0, which includes a bunch of patches.

You could try downloading [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-5.7.beta0/sage-5.7.beta0.tar](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-5.7.beta0/sage-5.7.beta0.tar) but keep in mind the disclaimer from `README.FIRST`:

```
This version of Sage is under construction, it has not been officially
released.

There is no point in testing it.  In particular, you should *not* report
bugs for this version.  First of all, the issue might already be known
to the release manager, but more importantly: since the release can
still change, any bug reports might be difficult to reproduce.

That being said, it can still be useful to use a non-released Sage
version for rebasing a patch, but don't complain if the version changed
and broke your patch.

You can look at the file tickets.html to see which tickets have been
successfully merged in this version.  The file logs/tickets.html
shows the last attempt at merging tickets, which may or may not be
successful.  This does not mean that all these tickets will eventually
be merged in this version, the list of tickets can still change before
the actual release.
