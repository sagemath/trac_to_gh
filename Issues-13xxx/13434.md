Right now, CartesianProduct has no attribute 'list'. One would like to be able to index the elements of a Cartesian product. For instance:

```
S = Set([1,2])
C = S.cartesian_product(S)
C.list()
```

Those are different objects, and yes, it is somewhat confusion (I believe there's a ticket already about/related to this). So there is something to be fixed here.
