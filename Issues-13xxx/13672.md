Consider the following:

```
sage: R.<t> = GF(2)[]; S.<x> = R[]
sage: f=(t^2 + t)*x + t^2 + t; g=(t + 1)*x + t^2
sage: f.resultant(g)
t^3 + t
```
This is wrong: the resultant of `f` and `g` is `t^4+t`.

Plenty of failures can be found with the following code which computes the resultant as the determinant of the Sylvester matrix:

```
def Resultant(f,g):
   df = f.degree()
   dg = g.degree()
   K = f.base_ring()
   M = matrix(K,df+dg,df+dg)
   for i in range(dg):
      for j in range(df+1):
         M[i,i+j] = f.coeffs()[df-j]
   for i in range(df):
      for j in range(dg+1):
         M[dg+i,i+j] = g.coeffs()[dg-j]
   return M.det()

def check(df,dg):
   f = S.random_element(degree=df)
   g = S.random_element(degree=dg)
   r1 = f.resultant(g)
   r2 = Resultant(f,g)
   if r1 <> r2:
      print f, g, r1, r2
      raise ValueError
```

Apply `13672_pari_resultant.patch`

<a id='comment:3'></a>This seems to be a bug in Pari or our conversion to Pari:

```python
sage: R.<t> = GF(2)[]; S.<x> = R[]
sage: f=(t^2 + t)*x + t^2 + t; g=(t + 1)*x + t^2
sage: f.resultant(g)
t^3 + t
sage: f._pari_().polresultant(g._pari_(), x._pari_(), 0)              
Mod(1, 2)*x^3 + Mod(1, 2)*x

sage: Q = PolynomialRing(GF(2), f.parent().variable_names_recursive())
sage: Q(f).resultant(Q(g),variable=Q(x))
t^4 + t
```
Note that `resultant()` has this logic:

```python
variable = self.parent().gen()
if str(variable)<>'x' and self.parent()._mpoly_base_ring()<>self.parent().base_ring():
    # use multivariate instead
```

and this works:

```python
sage: R.<t> = GF(2)[]; S.<y> = R[]
sage: f=(t^2 + t)*y + t^2 + t; g=(t + 1)*y + t^2
sage: f.resultant(g)
t^4 + t
```

I don't understand why this `str(variable)<>'x'` check is there.

`x` is special because PARI has a concept of "variable" priority, where `x` has highest priority.

But it seems that PARI/GP can compute resultants w.r.t. a different variable:

```
gp> ?polresultant
polresultant(x,y,{v},{flag=0}): resultant of the polynomials x and y, with respect to the main variables of x and y if v is omitted, with
respect to the variable v otherwise. flag is optional, and can be 0: default, uses either the subresultant algorithm, a modular algorithm
or Sylvester's matrix, depending on the inputs; 1 uses Sylvester's matrix (should always be slower than the default).
```
