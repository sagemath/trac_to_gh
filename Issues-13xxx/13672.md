Consider the following:

```
sage: R.<t> = GF(2)[]; S.<x> = R[]
sage: f=(t^2 + t)*x + t^2 + t; g=(t + 1)*x + t^2
sage: f.resultant(g)
t^3 + t
```
This is wrong: the resultant of `f` and `g` is `t^4+t`.

Plenty of failures can be found with the following code which computes the resultant as the determinant of the Sylvester matrix:

```
def Resultant(f,g):
   df = f.degree()
   dg = g.degree()
   K = f.base_ring()
   M = matrix(K,df+dg,df+dg)
   for i in range(dg):
      for j in range(df+1):
         M[i,i+j] = f.coeffs()[df-j]
   for i in range(df):
      for j in range(dg+1):
         M[dg+i,i+j] = g.coeffs()[dg-j]
   return M.det()

def check(df,dg):
   f = S.random_element(degree=df)
   g = S.random_element(degree=dg)
   r1 = f.resultant(g)
   r2 = Resultant(f,g)
   if r1 <> r2:
      print f, g, r1, r2
      raise ValueError
```

This seems to be a bug in Pari or our conversion to Pari:

```python
sage: R.<t> = GF(2)[]; S.<x> = R[]
sage: f=(t^2 + t)*x + t^2 + t; g=(t + 1)*x + t^2
sage: f.resultant(g)
t^3 + t
sage: f._pari_().polresultant(g._pari_(), x._pari_(), 0)              
Mod(1, 2)*x^3 + Mod(1, 2)*x

sage: Q = PolynomialRing(GF(2), f.parent().variable_names_recursive())
sage: Q(f).resultant(Q(g),variable=Q(x))
t^4 + t
```
Note that `resultant()` has this logic:

```python
variable = self.parent().gen()
if str(variable)<>'x' and self.parent()._mpoly_base_ring()<>self.parent().base_ring():
    # use multivariate instead
```

and this works:

```python
sage: R.<t> = GF(2)[]; S.<y> = R[]
sage: f=(t^2 + t)*y + t^2 + t; g=(t + 1)*y + t^2
sage: f.resultant(g)
t^4 + t
```

I don't understand why this `str(variable)<>'x'` check is there.

Martin, indeed the documentation says that `x` is special:

```
sage: f.resultant?
...
       We can also compute resultants over univariate and multivariate
       polynomial rings, provided that PARI's variable ordering
       requirements are respected. Usually, your resultants will work if
       you always ask for them in the variable "x":
```
In the contrary it seems that using `x` as main variable gives wrong resultants...

Replying to [zimmerma](#comment%3A6):

> `polynomial_element.pyx` in cc.

`x` is special because PARI has a concept of "variable" priority, where `x` has highest priority.

But it seems that PARI/GP can compute resultants w.r.t. a different variable:

```
gp> ?polresultant
polresultant(x,y,{v},{flag=0}): resultant of the polynomials x and y, with respect to the main variables of x and y if v is omitted, with
respect to the variable v otherwise. flag is optional, and can be 0: default, uses either the subresultant algorithm, a modular algorithm
or Sylvester's matrix, depending on the inputs; 1 uses Sylvester's matrix (should always be slower than the default).
```
