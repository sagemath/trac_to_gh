In Sage, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` ends with ":", which means the *current working directory* will be searched also.  This must not happen because of obvious security dangers.

**Apply** [attachment: 13595_LD_LIBRARY_PATH.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13595/13595_LD_LIBRARY_PATH.patch.gz) to the `SAGE_ROOT` repository.
