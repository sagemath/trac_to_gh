Could you add some doctests to confirm that the floor division works as you would expect it would by analogy with the integers, i.e. `(x//y)*y + (x % y) == x?` [Possible typo there, haven't finished this coffee.]  It seems to:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQbar[]
sage: left = x*3+4
sage: y = x
sage: (left//y)*y + (left % y) == left
True
sage: y = 17
sage: (left//y)*y + (left % y) == left
True
sage: y = (2*x+7)
sage: (left//y)*y + (left % y) == left
True

```

If floor division wasn't working then there must not have been anything testing stuff like this.

The doctests at the `__floordiv__` method did actually not test that method but a more specialized method for polynomials over `QQ`. I changed that so the tests are run for polynomials over `QQbar`. So now there are actually a few tests. Should we add more?",
