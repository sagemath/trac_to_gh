one comment : the last part of fundamental_group, where you use many nested tests to distinguish cases, does not look good and is hard to read. Maybe rather do something like

```
z = dict()
for i in range(3):
    if bdry[i] in spanning_tree:
        z[i] = FG.one()
    else:
        z[i] = FG.gen(gens_dict[bdry[i]])
```
and then

```
rels.append(z[0]*z[1].inverse()*z[2])
```
?

Since the milestone for this ticket has been pushed back to 5.8, we can fix the problem in [comment 7](#comment%3A7) here, too. It's a one line fix: line 2543 in the new version. The rest of the patch is just modifications to doctests. It is possible that the various warnings like

```
This may give the wrong answer if the simplicial complex 
was constructed with ``maximality_check`` set to ``False``. 
```
may not be true any more, but I'm not sure. Since they say "This *may* give the wrong answer ...", I think we can leave them intact. People should know to be careful when constructing simplicial complexes with `maximality_check=False`.
