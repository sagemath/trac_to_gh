Consider the following example:

```
G = Graph([(1,2,0.1), (2,3,0.5), (1,3,0.3), (1,4,0.1)])  # whatever
G.min_spanning_tree(weight_function=lambda e:e[2])
w, L = T.longest_path(use_edge_labels=True)
```
In the last two lines, the functions are called differently, which is annoying, since one always has to look up the doc, to find out, which one is the correct. 

Since both ways of calling are good (`use_edge_labels` simple and easy, `weight_function` more flexible), either should be possible for each function.



A first step is to **unify the use of parameters `by_weight`, `weight_function` and `check_weight`**
- #32723 Helper function to avoid duplicated code when using weights
- #32798 Clean the use of weights in `generic_graph.py` - part 1
- #32800 Clean the use of weights in `generic_graph.py` - part 2
- #32801 Clean the use of weights in `generic_graph.py` - part 3
- #32802 Clean the use of weights in `graph.py`
- #32803 Clean the use of weights in `digraph.py`
- #32804 Clean the use of weights in `path_enumeration.pyx`
- #32805 Clean the use of weights in `spanning_tree.pyx`. Method `random_spanning_tree` in #30566.
- `c_graph.pyx` - depends on  other tickets
- `boost_graph.pyx` - depends on  other tickets


We also have to **deprecate `use_edge_labels`** and use instead `by_weight`, etc.
- 
- 


and check methods silently using `if self.weighted()` 
- #33562 Bad error message for weighted adjacency matrix
- `distance_graph` - requires to add parameters `by_weights`, ...

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

I would go for single argument "by_weight" with following semantics of its values:

* False would be default with meaning "all the same".
* True would use labels.
* Custom function would be used translate edges to weight.

I think this would be easy to remember. On the other side, it is quite a radical change that would require long transition period.

What do you think?
