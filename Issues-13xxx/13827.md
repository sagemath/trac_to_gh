This is my suggestion of problems and possible enhancements of graph plotting:

- For now we say either `vertex_colors='red'` or `vertex_colors={'red': [1], 'blue': [2, 3]}`. But contrary to this we have `edge_color` and `edge_colors`. Not good.

- Default vertex color is pink. Setting color of some vertices will change color for other vertices to light blue. Not good.

- `fontsize` affects to size of title font, not for vertex label or edge label font sizes.

- We have no way at all to change, say, fontsize of vertex labels or color of edge labels etc.

- And why we can have different colors in vertices, but not shapes etc?

**Suggestions**

- ~~Make pink true default color for vertices, so that setting color of vertex 1 will left vertex 2 to pink.~~ (Done in #21048)

- ~~Add option `vertex_color` that will be default color for vertices not colored with `vertex_colors`. Deprecate use of `vertex_colors='red'`.~~ (Done in #21048)

- ~~Allow using `edge_color` and `edge_colors` at same time like `edge_color='red', edge_colors={'blue': [(1, 2)]}`. (For now setting `edge_colors` will change color of other edges to black, overriding `edge_color`.)~~ (Done in #21053)

- Add `title_fontsize`. Deprecate `fontsize`.

- Add other options with same pattern. I.e. let we still have `vertex_shape`, but also add `vertex_shapes` to be used like `G.plot(vertex_shape='s', vertex_shapes={'d': G.sources(), 'c': G.sinks()})`.

- And last, we should decide how to give options for fonts. As a triples of color, font and fontsize, or as a three argument? If as triples, do not add `title_fontsize` but `title_font`.

First action point would be to think about my suggestion and modify it until we have common vision of what to do.

Above is a copy from dicussion, to be found easily. Here is original description:

There is no customization of text possible in plots of graphs (graphs as in graph theory). It is mentioned as a TODO in `sage.graphs.graph_plot.GraphPlot.set_vertices`

```
            # TODO: allow text options
            for v in self._nodelist:
                self._plot_components['vertex_labels'].append(text(str(v),
                    self._pos[v], rgbcolor=(0,0,0), zorder=8))
```

Here are some other bugs:

```
g = DiGraph({0:[1], 1:[0]})
g.show()  # OK
g.show(edge_colors={'red': [(0,1)]})  # Not OK
g.show(edge_style='dotted')  # OK

# Docstring says edge_style "currently only works for
# directed graphs" but the following works still.
graphs.CompleteGraph(3).show(edge_style="dotted")

# Even plain show() fails in extreme case:
g1 = graphs.CompleteGraph(2)
g2 = Graph({0:[1]})
print(g1==g2)  # True
g1.show()  # Not shown
g2.show()  # Shown
```

"For all the constructors in this database (except the octahedral, dodecahedral, random and empty graphs), the position dictionary is filled in" -- it is filled in octahedral and dodecahedral graph.

> Make pink true default color for vertices, so that setting color of vertex 1 will left vertex 2 to pink.

Maybe it should be blue/sage color, so as to be default with the sage plots.

Instead of adding many keyword arguments for the overall plot command, it might be better to let the methods take care of the setting. 

* `set_vertices` could be used to set only vertex properties.
* `set_edges` for setting only edge property.
* Maybe introduce a different `set_plot_font` because it seems customizing all the different font properties is going to be a complicated method in itself.
* Introduce the `vertex_shapes` and such other vertex related properties not in `plot` but in the `set_vertex` method.

Adding kcrisman for his expert comments :-)

Whatever. But I suppose that we agree that setting color of vertex 1 should not change color of vertex 2.

so we would have something like

```
p = G.plot()
p.set_vertex(('shapes', {'d': G.sources()}), ('colors', ...))
p.show()
```

? Sounds complicated.

Breaking it up into multiple methods should make it clearer which methods control which aspects of the graph.\n\nIt depends. User may not use all possible options. And if he/she uses, then it won't be that much easier with several lines of settings. And one can say\n\n```\nedge_colors = ... # something complicated\n ...\nvertex_shapes = ... # something complicated\n...plot(edge_colors=edge_colors, ...)\n```\n\n> From the programming point of view, it should also make the functions more manageable. Otherwise, all of that code will end up in a single huge function `plot`.\n\nI guess that backend should have `set_edges` and so on.

Replying to [@ppurka](#comment%3A12):
> In my opinion, it will get unwieldy if all the options are put into plot. Making a plot will involve a massive single line of `p.plot(shapes=, colors=, fonts=,....)`. Breaking it up into multiple methods should make it clearer which methods control which aspects of the graph.

It depends. User may not use all possible options. And if he/she uses, then it won't be that much easier with several lines of settings. And one can say

```
edge_colors = ... # something complicated
 ...
vertex_shapes = ... # something complicated
...plot(edge_colors=edge_colors, ...)
```

> From the programming point of view, it should also make the functions more manageable. Otherwise, all of that code will end up in a single huge function `plot`.

I guess that backend should have `set_edges` and so on. But `plot` can call them.

I believe that there is not very good solution. There are just too many options that could be useful to someone. OTOH reducing possible options sounds odd. So we can only make sure that the design is as orthogonal as it can.

Still about the desing... I the user is plotting just one graph, it is easier to have single `plot()` with massive list of options.

If the user wants to plot same graph somehow modified, then it will be easier to do something like

```
G.set_vertex_shape('a', 'rectangle')
G.set_vertex_shape('b', 'circle')
G.show()
G.do_something_inplace('a', 'x')
G.show()
```

From these choised I would choose first one. I would make a `plot()` with huge list of options, and internally `set_vertices()` and `set_edges()` with a manageable number of options.
