Geoff Tims mentionned aloud that it would make more sense for is_strongly_regular to return quadruples instead of triples : the current method does not return the number of vertices which -- although it is not hard to get in Sage -- is an important information on a strongly regular graph.

This small change is contained in the present patch. Along with the remark from http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1782/minor-improvement-to-chromatic-number

I'd say this is the **right** thing to return, it is extremely standard to quote all four at once.  At a minimum it is a big improvement.  Two initial comments.

1.  Patch has some changes to `coloring.py` that look totally unrelated.  Should they be somewhere else?
2.  What if somebody currently does

```
g.is_strongly_regular(return_parameters = True)[1]
```
because all they want is `lambda`.  Now they will get `k` and be none the wiser.  How about deprecating the current keyword and make up a new (similar) one?  Or maybe there is a better fix that I am not thinking of right now.  (There is an easy decorator for deprecating a keyword, iirc.)  Just `parameters` would be cleaner, imho.
