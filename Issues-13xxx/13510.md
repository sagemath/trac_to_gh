Geoff Tims mentionned aloud that it would make more sense for is_strongly_regular to return quadruples instead of triples : the current method does not return the number of vertices which -- although it is not hard to get in Sage -- is an important information on a strongly regular graph.

I'd say this is the **right** thing to return, it is extremely standard to quote all four at once.  At a minimum it is a big improvement.  Two initial comments.

1.  Patch has some changes to `coloring.py` that look totally unrelated.  Should they be somewhere else?
2.  What if somebody currently does

```
g.is_strongly_regular(return_parameters = True)[1]
```
because all they want is `lambda`.  Now they will get `k` and be none the wiser.  How about deprecating the current keyword and make up a new (similar) one?  Or maybe there is a better fix that I am not thinking of right now.  (There is an easy decorator for deprecating a keyword, iirc.)  Just `parameters` would be cleaner, imho.

Well, because the deprecation will be forgotten for a year or so, and it will require another patch to remove it `:-P`

I see it as "I create a patch to fix something, but I will have to write another patch in a long time, and I know that I will forget" `:-P`

Helloooooooooo !!

I just updated the patch so that return_parameters is now parameters, and added something in the documentation of spanning_trees.pyx. I tried to use the rename_keyword thing and I do not really see the point : it looks like renaming an argument with a deprecation just makes both names aliases to each other, so it is better to rename the code immediately. Besides, this way the documentation is consistent (otherwise users can still use return_parameters while it does not appear in the method's doc, that's weird `O_o`)
