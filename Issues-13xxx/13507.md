For a P a finite poset, one can define two polytopes :

the order polytope of P,

and the chain polytope of P.

This patch implements both.

Here is a new patch.

I have just enhanced the reference, using the new doi role introduced in #14011.

Please review !

In line 2909 you can indent 
"Discrete Comput. Geom. (1986), :doi:`10.1007/BF02187680` "
so that the documentation displays better.

Also, in the order polytope would the method be more efficient in generating the polytope if you include:


1. inequality for each cover relation (as it is currently done)

2. x >= 0 for minimal elements x and x <= 1 for maximal elements (instead of doing both inequalities for all elements of the poset).



Other than this it looks good.
