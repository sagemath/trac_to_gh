It sounds like the adaptative algorithm fails to find suitable
evaluation points when plotting large functions (like exp) in loglog
scale. In the following example, the exp function gets drawn with only
three points:

```
sage: plot([n^2,exp(n)], xmin=1, xmax=10^5, ymin=1,ymax=10^10, scale="loglog")
verbose 0 (2397: plot.py, generate_plot_points) WARNING: When plotting, failed to evaluate function at 198 points.
verbose 0 (2397: plot.py, generate_plot_points) Last error message: ''
```

If xmax is replaced by 10^10, the function is not even drawn:

```
sage: sage: plot([n^2,exp(n)], xmin=1, xmax=10^10, ymin=1,ymax=10^10, scale="loglog")
verbose 0 (2397: plot.py, generate_plot_points) WARNING: When plotting, failed to evaluate function at 199 points.
verbose 0 (2397: plot.py, generate_plot_points) Last error message: ''
```

On the other hand, the equivalent semilogy plot works smoothly:

```
sage: plot([10^n,exp(10^n)], xmin=0, xmax=5, ymin=1,ymax=10^10, scale="semilogy")
verbose 0 (2397: plot.py, generate_plot_points) WARNING: When plotting, failed to evaluate function at 86 points.
verbose 0 (2397: plot.py, generate_plot_points) Last error message: ''
```

(Such plots are typically useful in classes about algorithmic complexity http://combinat.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/agregation-option-calcul-formel/tris_et_complexite.html)

True, but that would be another ticket.  And sometimes one would want to plot the same data in two different ways, so we wouldn't want to remove that entirely.

Well, unless there is a quick solution for just the issue stated in this ticket, I am happy recycling it to whatever the right fix should be (taking into account the log scale early or delaying the generation of the evaluation points to `show`).

> And sometimes one would want to plot the same data in two different ways, so we wouldn't want to remove that entirely.


I don't know the current implementation, so there might be technical obstructions I can't see; however, in principle, isn't the data really the function rather than the points? In that case, should'nt the points just be recalculated as needed?

Maybe you are better off generating the list of data points by using exact arithmetic in Sage and then passing off the list to `list_plot`.

Huh, that is not good.

```
sage: F(709.7)

sage: F(709.8)
inf
```
That's as much bisecting as I want to do.  And really, here is what is going on, I suspect.

```

In [3]: import math

In [6]: math.exp(709.8)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
OverflowError                             Traceback (most recent call last)

/Users/.../<ipython console> in <module>()

OverflowError: math range error

In [7]: math.exp(709.7)
Out[7]: 1.6549840276802644e+308
```
So `fast_float` really is doing floats, but we need something better than that.

The solution of this ticket depends on #15030 and [this ask.sagemath](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/3001/contour_plot-issue-with-large-numbers) thread.

How? I suppose we can introduce a plot keyword `precision=53` that gets passed on to `fast_callable` and one can increase that to get higher precision but slower plots.
