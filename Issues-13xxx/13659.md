`matrix_mod_pn()` for elements in Eisenstein extensions of `Zp` suffers from the same inaccuracy problem as the one described in #13651.

```
sage: R=Zp(3,3)
sage: S.<a>=R[]
sage: L.<a>=R.extension(a^2-3)
sage: L(3).matrix_mod_pn()
[57  0]
[ 0 57]
```

The attached patch fixes this.

Depends on #13651
Depends on #13617
