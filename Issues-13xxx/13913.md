GCC does not provide separates tarball for each languages for the 4.7.x releases, so we have to cook our own if we do not want to include ADA, GO, JAVA, OBJC...

Try the spkg at [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/gcc-4.7.2.p0.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/gcc-4.7.2.p0.spkg)

The stripped src dir can be produced using the `spkg-src` provided in the spkg.

Or is it actually used or necessary somewhere?

I guess this is NLS related and in the end is not used because of the --disable-nls flag.
I've just built without it and everything seems fine.
(Without it the --disable-nls flag should not be that useful but let's keep it in anyway.)
