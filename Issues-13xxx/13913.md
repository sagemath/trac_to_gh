GCC does not provide separates tarball for each languages for the 4.7.x releases, so we have to cook our own if we do not want to include ADA, GO, JAVA, OBJC...

Try the spkg at [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/gcc-4.7.2.p0.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/gcc-4.7.2.p0.spkg)

The stripped src dir can be produced using the `spkg-src` provided in the spkg.

My `spkg-src` script (don't call it `spkg-dist` as that is really meant for scripts which create a spkg):

```

# Remove some unneeded pieces from GCC, after downloading and
# extracting the sources and renaming the directory to src/.

cd src || exit $?

rm MD5SUMS
rm -r maintainer-scripts

# Remove zlib, since Sage already ships with zlib
# and we build GCC with --with-system-zlib.
rm -r zlib

# Remove Native Language Support
rm -r gcc/po libcpp/po

# Remove support for Link Time Optimization
rm -r lto-plugin

# Remove all files for languages other than C, C++, Fortran.

I guess this is NLS related and in the end is not used because of the --disable-nls flag.
I've just built without it and everything seems fine.
(Without it the --disable-nls flag should not be that useful but let's keep it in anyway.)

I'm not entirely sure that it's not needed.  It contains gettext library, needed for internationalization.  I don't know whether `--disable-nls` truly disables the use of gettext.  The fact that it works on your system might be because your system already has gettext.  To be on the safe side, I would keep `intl`, it's only 100K compressed anyway.
