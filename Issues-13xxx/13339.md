here a fix will be a bit more involved. What happens is that `ext/interpreters/wrapper/wrapper_rdf.c`, which is Cython-autogenerated from the .pyx file, which in turn is generated by `ext/gen_interpreters.py`, has the line

```
 __PYX_EXTERN_C DL_IMPORT(double) interp_rdf(double *, double *, PyObject **, double *, int *);
```
which should be 

```
 __PYX_EXTERN_C double interp_rdf(double *, double *, PyObject **, double *, int *);
```

And the same holds for `ext/interpreters/wrapper/wrapper_cdf.c` (and `ext/interpreters/wrapper/wrapper_rr.c`, `..._py.c`, `..._el.c`), just replace `rdf` (resp. `rr`, etc.) by `cdf` in every place above.

After I do the corresponding changes in these C files, ./sage -b completes. 

---

Now the attempt to start Sage ends with 

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/Dima/sage-5.2.rc1/local/bin/sage-ipython", line 18, in <module>
    import IPython
ImportError: No module named IPython
```
(which is OK, I just have to run `make build`).

I've already a fix which consists in generating h files for the interp_*.c files which get included in wrapper_*.c files and avoid the Cython/import/_ _ imp _ _ stuff as desrcibed in the [CygwinPort](../wikis/CygwinPort) page, I'll post it a little later.

The IPython stuff was expected IIRC.
I'll confirm that later as well, but were closing to finishing the build and starting Sage.

Sure. By the way, I just encountered a GAP-specific problem (some `ln` hack, no longer needed, fails), which is easy to fix, but needs a new spkg. Have you dealt with this too? Or it worked for you without a problem? (In case, I can open a ticket for this and post a new spkg, just let me know).

Oh yeah I now remember about that problem.
We used to create a symlink from gap to gap.exe (or conversely) but my Cygwin was making the name conversion automatically and the symlink creation failed.

Anyway, let's create another ticket for that.
Not sure if the trick must be completely discrded or tthe error ignored if it fails.

This is now #13341.

I don't think I got that one with 5.1.rc1.
So either its a new problem, or I somehow got through it.
I'll confirm when I'm getting there.

I've crafted a new spkg for the crypto.lib problem, just moving it to crypto.xxx before installing pyOpenSSL and movind it back afterward.

You can test it at http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/sage/sagenb-0.9.1.p0.spkg
As I'm not sure whether there's a special procedure for updating the sagenb spkg, nothing is committed yet and no ticket created.

That's a fix, but not a proper cure to the problem. See #13344.
It's a bug somewhere else. That `crypto.lib` does not belong there at all!
