The standard `var` function can return a tuple of symbols:

```
sage: a1,a2,a3 = var('a1,a2,a3')
```

But `SR.symbol()`, which is recommended for use in library code, cannot:

```
sage: a1,a2,a3 = SR.symbol('a1,a2,a3')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/mjo/<ipython console> in <module>()

TypeError: 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression' object is not iterable
```

For convenience and consistently, they should behave the same. There is a slight possibility for backwards-incompatibility here, since `SR.symbol()` will create a symbol with a comma in the name:

```
sage: foo = SR.symbol('a1,a2,a3')     
sage: foo
a1,a2,a3
```

but hopefully, that's not actually used anywhere.

-1: we already have `SR.var` for that.

I'm pretty sure that `SR.symbol` is recommended in library code specifically *because* its return type does not depend on the presence of `,` in the input string. That makes it much easier to deal with its results in a programmatic manner.

In general, you want a primitive an absolutely basic access function to infrastructure (`SR.symbol`) that does minimal processing on input and is completely regular in its output. If it turns out certain usage patterns arise again and again, one can introduce convenience wrappers (which are easy to write *beause* the primitive is so regular):

```
map(SR.symbol,('a','b','c'))
```
which got wrapped as

```
map(SR.symbol,'a,b,c'.split(','))
```
because people were probably hesitant about making `var` variadic and/or didn't know that could be done while keeping keyword-only parameters as well and/or didn't like typing the extra quotes involved.
