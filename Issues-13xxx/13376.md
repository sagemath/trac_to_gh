Smalljac is a library and set of programs for computing L-polynomials and Jacobian group structures of low genus curves over finite fields. Given a curve C of genus 1 or 2 defined over Q or a quadratic number field, it will efficiently compute either the sequence of L-polynomials or Jacobian group structures arising from the reduction of C at all primes of good reduction up to a specified norm bound.

This set of SPKGs and the corresponding patch to Sage 5.6 add support for using smallJac from Sage.

* `EllipticCurve.aplist` can be run with `algorithm="smalljac"`, yielding run times of six times faster on a single core.

* `EllipticCurve.aplists` provides more usable representation the above, and supports number fields (multiple reductions per prime norm).  See the documentation for more, but in general `aplist` couldn't be made very easy to use for the number field case.

* `EllipticCurve.grouplists` gives the abelian groups isomorphic to various reductions of a curve.

* `EllipticCurve.lpolylists` yields the L-Polynomials of reductions of a curve.

* `EllipticCurve.guess_sato_tate_group` attempts to guess the Sato-Tate group of the Jacobian of a curve of genus 1 or 2 based on the distribution of its L-polynomial coefficients.

* `EllipticCurve.moments` yields the moments of the distribution of coefficients of the L-Polynomials.

* `EllipticCurve.trace_histogram` gives a very simple histogram for the distribution of traces of Frobenius of a curve, reduced at a range of primes.

For all of the above methods (except `aplist`), identical functionality exists (with the same name) for genus 2 curves.  All of the above methods also parallelize over multiple cores (currently, to a power of two cores).  For large problems, this achieves approximately linear speedup; for example, computing the first billion traces of Frobenius of an ordinary elliptic curve is 178 times faster on 32 cores.

For each of these features, there is Sage documentation docstring-style documentation.

The SPKGs only compile and work on 64-bit machines, since SmallJac only supports 64-bit architectures, and require GMP.  Two SPKGs are provided, since SmallJac depends on ff_poly, but so does some of Drew Sutherland's other code, so it makes sense to split the two.  They've been tested to work on a completely clean install of Sage on at least two differently-configured machines.

The patch has been tested to apply cleanly to 5.6.

SPKGs are available at [http://www.mit.edu/~pavpan/](http://www.mit.edu/~pavpan/).  Install first the ff_poly package and then the smalljac package, with the normal Sage package installation mechanisms.  Then apply the patch to a fresh branch of the source code and recompile that branch.

The "Software" section of [Drew Sutherland's page](https://math.mit.edu/~drew/) links to a tarball for SmallJac 4.1.3.

a few of quick comments:
* don't touch unrelated files (e.g. sage/numerical/backends/glpk_backend.pxd)
* it would probably make more sense to default to smalljac over pari if it is installed
* it would help if your trac ticket included installation instructions at the bottom, and if it is ready to be reviewed, you should change the status to needs review

also, I'm not the most knowledgeable on the matter, but my understanding was that optional packages need to work on all supported platforms, so it might be more of an experimental package since it doesn't work on 32bit platforms

Note that this doesn't even depend on its size; in general, binary files shouldn't be attached.

By convention, we also add which patch to apply (in which order) to which of the Sage repositories to the ticket's description.

Don't like the spkgs. Both SPKG.txt aren't updated to reflect the version changes. The first thing that I see in both is

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

CFLAGS="-fPIC -mtune=k8 -pedantic -std=gnu99"
LDFLAGS="-static"
```
-fPIC and -static are kind of opposite but you will want to fold a library that you only know how to build static into a shared object so you need the -fPIC. Would be better to build shared in the first place. Is the "-mtune=k8" the thing that impose 64bitness? Anyway that assume way too much about the underlying cpu even on x86_64. We have people working on arm and ppc64, that's 64bit too. 

When you say 64bit do you mean x86_64 as in "I have used simmd instructions that are only available on this cpus"(pet hate) or something else? 

If you have used x86_64 specific instructions I am not sure we can ever move this out of optional since we support (or at least aim to) a larger range of hardware.

And just looking I have found assembly....

My mistake, sorry.  I've updated the patch file to remove such garbage and add the actual files instead.

> * it would probably make more sense to default to smalljac over pari if it is installed

This seemed like a more controversial option, though of course that wouldn't be a problem.

> * it would help if your trac ticket included installation instructions at the bottom, and if it is ready to be reviewed, you should change the status to needs review

Will do.  I read through the developer guide, but either forgot or didn't see things like this.

Alright.  Links to the two SPKGs are at [http://www.mit.edu/~pavpan/](http://www.mit.edu/~pavpan/).  They have small updates from the ones included above.

No, I think the meaning (and I am not Drew Sutherland so I do not know exactly) is that fast 64-bit integer operations are assumed throughout, and some algorithms are optimized to use the extra registers available on 64-bit systems.  The single assembly instruction used is that which yields the high bit of an unsigned integer.  This can always be written as a loop, but that will hurt performance.  I do not know if such an instruction is available on arm, ppc, or elsewhere.

I believe static compilation is for performance reasons.  I can ask Drew Sutherland how important that is.  The compilation certainly works without it.  Similarly the tuning parameter, though suggesting to GCC that it is compiling to a platform with a full x86_64 register set and integer size is again important to performance.

GCC probably "knows" more about the platform it is compiling on (especially on x86/x86_64) or for than most of us. ;-)

`-mtune` btw. doesn't really affect the instruction set GCC compiles for, but the selection out of and ordering of these.  (`-march`, on some platforms `-mcpu`, and other target-dependent `-m...` options specify the architecture and hence the available instruction set of the target CPU.)

This code is absolutely state-of-the-art for what it does and it would be a shame to not have it available in sage, at least on platforms where it works (which is by far the most common platform presently!).

I agree that installation should work on all platforms sage supports, but that installation could consist of installing a routine that successfully tells "I'm not available on this platform". Correct usage of the library could then include "first check if it's available" and provide an alternative (via gp for some things perhaps) if it's not.

This is not so different from, say, the Magma interface, which is part of sage but only does something useful when Magma is actually available.

The unrelated changes are still there.

Ok, some needed changes to the sage patch:
* Full documentation and doctest coverage -- right now the `_smalljac` methods have no doctests, and `sage.libs.smalljac` has next to no documentation and no doctests
* All doctests not flagged as optional need to pass without smalljac installed
* Make sure your patch is properly exported from mercurial, so that it has all the relevant metadata (author, commit message, date, etc.)

? Using `uint64_t` would be portable.

With `uint_fast64_t`, you may (at some point in the future...) run into problems because the assumption is `sizeof(unsigned long)==8`, not `>=8`, at least in most cases.  (128-bit quantities are currently split into two `unsigned long`s; it would of course be worth using native integral types there if available.)

Yes, but the standard seems to not guarantee its existence:

http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/integer

making me believe you could have a C99-compliant compiler on a 32bit system that does not provide `uint_64_t`. Perhaps all our target systems do provide it, in which case it's probably a good choice.

It seems that C99 does guarantee the existence of `uint_fast64_t` (but indeed not that it is exactly 8 bytes long).

**EDIT:** I stand corrected. Apparently:

http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/integer

the type is guaranteed in C99 but is optional in C++11. That's rather insane. However, as long as smalljac is just C we should be OK (and I guess that as long as we're using C++ compilers that also support C, we can have good hopes that `int_64_t` etc. is available there too).
