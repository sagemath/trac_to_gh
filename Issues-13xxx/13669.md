What should be done to review the patches?

From looking at them, they seem good to me, but I am no expert for gdb. And I can confirm that "sage -gdb" now starts without error, in the sense of "I was able to do some non-trivial computation in an interactive session and quit Sage without gdb complaining".

But is that enough to constitute a positive review?

`./sage -t -gdb devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py` works as well.

Slight complaint: `./sage -gdb -t devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py` does not work.

Would it be possible to make the options -gdb and -t commute?
