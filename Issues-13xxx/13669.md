What should be done to review the patches?

From looking at them, they seem good to me, but I am no expert for gdb. And I can confirm that "sage -gdb" now starts without error, in the sense of "I was able to do some non-trivial computation in an interactive session and quit Sage without gdb complaining".

But is that enough to constitute a positive review?
