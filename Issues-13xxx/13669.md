applying trac_13669_fix_sage_gdb.patch
unable to find 'spkg/bin/sage' for patching
1 out of 1 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file spkg/bin/sage.rej
```

As say in http://wiki.sagemath.org/buildbot,

    Only the devel repository has branches, so the buildbot is unable to apply and try out patches to extcode/scripts/etc.

What should be done to review the patches?

From looking at them, they seem good to me, but I am no expert for gdb. And I can confirm that "sage -gdb" now starts without error, in the sense of "I was able to do some non-trivial computation in an interactive session and quit Sage without gdb complaining".

But is that enough to constitute a positive review?

Slight complaint: `./sage -gdb -t devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py` does not work.

Would it be possible to make the options -gdb and -t commute?

Q: How many Sage contributors does it take to change a light bulb? 

A: While looking at the broken light bulb we noticed some paint peeling on the wall, so we should probably re-do the foundation of the house first.
