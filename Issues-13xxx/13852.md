When building the documentation, a warning appears:

```
SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/matrix/benchmark.py:docstring of sage.matrix.benchmark.SetPartitionsAk:3: SEVERE: Unexpected section title.

Methods
-------
```
I think this is due to the line

```
from sage.all import *
```
at the top of that file. Its page in the reference manual includes (for reasons I don't understand) entries from all kinds of functions which are not present in that file, like `sage.matrix.benchmark.SetPartitionsAk(k)`, `sage.matrix.benchmark.allocatemem`, and others. Changing the import statement to be more precise seems to fix things.
