The documentation here http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/search.html should be able to search methods (those not starting with `_`) in the classes. For instance, the following search http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/search.html?q=integer_representation gives zero results even though `integer_representation` is a valid method for an element of `GF(2^p)`.

```
sage: F = GF(2**3, 'a')
sage: b = F.random_element(); b
a^2 + a
sage: b.integer_representation()
6
```

Almost certainly. Something like: "In sage, you can use `search_src` [with a link to its doc] to find functions in **all** of the source code, including private functions (those that begin with a leading underscore '`_`')." Possibly also adding: "If there is a module not linked in this documentation, it is a bug that needs to be reported."

Also `search_def` according to its documentation is the same as `search_src`.
