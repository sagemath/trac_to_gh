The documentation here http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/search.html should be able to search methods (those not starting with `_`) in the classes. For instance, the following search http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/search.html?q=integer_representation gives zero results even though `integer_representation` is a valid method for an element of `GF(2^p)`.

```
sage: F = GF(2**3, 'a')
sage: b = F.random_element(); b
a^2 + a
sage: b.integer_representation()
6
```

I don't think the problem is that it cannot search in methods. For instance, if you try

```
frobenius
```
you'll see plenty of methods show up. Are you positive that `integer_representation` is documented in the "sage reference"? If you look in the index under "I", you'll see many methods indexed, but not that one. So I guess that `sage.rings.finite_rings.element_givaro.FiniteField_givaroElement` is simply not included there.

Almost certainly.

Possibly also adding: "If there is a module not linked in this documentation, it is a bug that needs to be reported."

Also `search_def` according to its documentation is the same as `search_src`.

Those `search_*` functions are only available when you're running Sage, while the documentation search page just needs the build documentation — no need for Sage to be running. So that's one reason why they're not integrated, and probably why they shouldn't be.

I'm imagining text like "You can also run `search_src(...)` from while running Sage to search the source code. You can also browse the source code by running `hg_sage.serve()` from Sage."

Re `search_def('blah')`: it is like `search_src('blah')`, but it restricts its search to lines of the form `def blah` or `cdef blah`, so it sees both functions and methods which contain 'blah' in their name.
