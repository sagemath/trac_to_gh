This module computes the map from a elliptic curve in a toric surface to its Weierstrass form.

```
    sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
    sage: cubic = x^3 + y^3 + 1
    sage: WeierstrassMap(cubic)
    (-x^3*y^3 - x^3 - y^3, 
     1/2*x^6*y^3 - 1/2*x^3*y^6 - 1/2*x^6 + 1/2*y^6 + 1/2*x^3 - 1/2*y^3, 
     x*y)
```

Depends on #13084

When I try

```
for P in ReflexivePolytopes(2):
    E = CPRFanoToricVariety(P).anticanonical_hypersurface()
    p = E.defining_polynomials()[0]
    print WeierstrassForm(p, transformation=True)
```
it crashes on the 10th polytope with

```

Running it just for the 10th is OK, so looks more like a singular interface issue, but may be worth investigation...

This is still applicable, but otherwise the patch looks good to me modulo some typos fixed in reviewer patch and apparently is works for #3416 ;-)
