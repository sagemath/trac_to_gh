This module computes the map from a elliptic curve in a toric surface to its Weierstrass form.

```
    sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
    sage: cubic = x^3 + y^3 + 1
    sage: WeierstrassMap(cubic)
    (-x^3*y^3 - x^3 - y^3, 
     1/2*x^6*y^3 - 1/2*x^3*y^6 - 1/2*x^6 + 1/2*y^6 + 1/2*x^3 - 1/2*y^3, 
     x*y)
```

Running it just for the 10th is OK, so looks more like a singular interface issue, but may be worth investigation...

Why are we even using the Singular interface here, this is pretty sad. I can confirm your bug, even though it works if I just do the 10th polytope without the previous ones 

```
sage: P = ReflexivePolytopes(2)[10]
sage: E = CPRFanoToricVariety(P).anticanonical_hypersurface()
sage: p = E.defining_polynomials()[0]
sage: WeierstrassForm(p, transformation=True)
```

This is still applicable, but otherwise the patch looks good to me modulo some typos fixed in reviewer patch and apparently is works for #3416 ;-)

Reviewer patch looks good to me.
