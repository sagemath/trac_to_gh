<div id="comment:0"></div>

The current implementation of C3's algorithm in sage.misc.c3 (which is
used to compute the list of all the super categories of a category) is
incorrect.

Define indeed the following classes::

```
sage: class C(object): pass
....: 
sage: class F(object): pass
....: 
sage: class G(object): pass
....: 
sage: class B(C,F): pass
....: 
sage: class D(F,G): pass
....: 
sage: class E(F): pass
....: 
sage: class A(B,D,E): pass
....: 
```
Which gives the following mro:

```
sage: A.mro()
[<class '__main__.A'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.E'>, <class '__main__.F'>, <class '__main__.G'>, <type 'object'>]
```

Here is now the same hierarchy using categories::

```
class Cs(Category): 
    def super_categories(self): return []

class Fs(Category): 
    def super_categories(self): return []

class Gs(Category): 
    def super_categories(self): return []

class Bs(Category): 
    def super_categories(self): return [Cs(), Fs()]

class Ds(Category): 
    def super_categories(self): return [Fs(), Gs()]

class Es(Category): 
    def super_categories(self): return [Fs()]

class As(Category): 
    def super_categories(self): return [Bs(), Ds(), Es()]
```

The super categories are not given in the same order (g,e,f instead of
e f g)::

```
sage: As().all_super_categories()
[Category of as, Category of bs, Category of cs, Category of ds, Category of gs, Category of es, Category of fs]
```

This is due to popping X from the tail too early around line 186: O is
a candidate for being the next in line, but has not yet been
definitely chosen.


And indeed this is caught by the test suite::

```
sage: TestSuite(As()).run()
Failure in _test_category_graph:
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AssertionError: False is not true
```

Here is another hierarchy with an inconsistent MRO which is not
detected by Sage's current C3::

```
class B(object): pass

class C(B): pass

class A(B, C): pass

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<ipython console>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: Error when calling the metaclass bases
    Cannot create a consistent method resolution
order (MRO) for bases C, B
```

```
class Bs(Category): 
    def super_categories(self): return []

class Cs(Category): 
    def super_categories(self): return [Bs()]

class As(Category): 
    def super_categories(self): return [Bs(), Cs()]
    class subcategory_class(object): # just to bypass the MRO error when building the subcategory class
        pass

sage: As()
Category of as
sage: As().all_super_categories()
[Category of as, Category of cs, Category of bs]
```


Here the issue comes from the fact that the C3 algorithm is supposed
to work on the mro's of the bases *together with* the list of the
bases, which the current Sage's implementation does not.

Hi Simon,

I'll be working on this ticket today or so. We are currently exploring with Florent the theoretical limits of C3, and ways to fix the MRO issues once for all for categories. For that, we need a clean C3 implementation for further instrumentation. More on that topic on sage-combinat-devel shortly!

Hi!

I optimized and cleaned a bit the code; here are some timings, using the following for benchmarking (better suggestions welcome):

```
sage: l = GradedHopfAlgebrasWithBasis(GF(3)).all_super_categories() # to force preloading everything
sage: def f(n):
...       for i in range(5,n+5):
...            GradedHopfAlgebras(GF(nth_prime(i))).all_super_categories()
```

Before:

```
sage: %prun f(200)
...
2800/200    0.189    0.000    1.298    0.006 {sage.misc.c3.C3_algorithm}
```

With [attachment: trac_13501-categories-c3_fix-nt.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13501/trac_13501-categories-c3_fix-nt.patch.gz):

```
sage: %prun f(200)
...
 2800/200    0.249    0.000    1.430    0.007 {sage.misc.c3.C3_algorithm}
```

With further [attachment: trac_13501-categories-c3_fix-useless_optimization-nt.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13501/trac_13501-categories-c3_fix-useless_optimization-nt.patch.gz):

```
sage: %prun f(200)
...
 2800/200    0.249    0.000    1.429    0.007 {sage.misc.c3.C3_algorithm}
```

So, we have a 15% loss compared to the previous implementation. I am
not sure exactly where it's slower, but I guess it's just the price
for correctness (the previous implementation was popping out stuff too
early). As the second attachment shows, using PyList_GET_ITEM and
friends does not seem to bring anything substantial, so I'd vote for
sticking to more readable Python notations.

Here it is: without the break:

```
 2800/200    0.247    0.000    1.417    0.007 {sage.misc.c3.C3_algorithm}
```

with the break:

```
 2800/200    0.243    0.000    1.413    0.007 {sage.misc.c3.C3_algorithm}
```

Tiny difference, but it's natural to put it here anyway. I am about to
update the patch.

Note: I switched from 5.2 to 5.3 in the mean time, so the timings from this comment can't really be compared with the timings before.

Another thought: We want to compare the entries on the list by identity, not by equality, isn't it? But isn't then `if O in tail_set` unnecessarily slow, because it compares by equality rather than identity?

I wonder if one could instrument `MonoDict` from #12313.

Namely:

sage: Sid = set(id(O) for O in S)
sage: len(S)
1229
sage: len(Sid)
1229
sage: O = Algebras(GF(151))
sage: test1(S,O)

I am almost ready for a postive review (assuming the patchbot goes green). Two little questions: what happens if

- we use id(cat) rather than the obscure <size_t><void *> cat ?

- we use ``O in <set>tailsets[j]`` rather than assigning to a temporary variable?

In both cases, if the speed is roughly equivalent, then I vote for the more readable version.

Cheers,

Will it ever go green? Does the patchbot work at all.

I guess you mean `id(O) in <set>tailsets[j]`?

<div id="comment:25" align="right">comment:25</div>

The following "raw data" should advise us what syntax to use.

I defined

```
include "sage/ext/python_list.pxi"

def test1(list L, object O):
    cdef set S
    cdef size_t i
    cdef size_t l = len(L)
    cdef bint b
    for i from 0<=i<l:
        S = <set>PyList_GET_ITEM(L,i)
        b = <size_t><void *>O in S

def test2(list L, object O):
    cdef size_t i
    cdef size_t l = len(L)
    cdef bint b
    for i from 0<=i<l:
        b = <size_t><void *>O in <set>PyList_GET_ITEM(L,i)

def test3(list L, object O):
    cdef size_t i
    cdef size_t l = len(L)
    cdef bint b
    for i from 0<=i<l:
        b = <size_t><void *>O in <set>L[i]

def test4(list L, object O):
    cdef size_t i
    cdef size_t l = len(L)
    cdef bint b
    for i from 0<=i<l:
        b = id(O) in <set>L[i]

def test5(list L, object O):
    cdef size_t i
    cdef size_t l = len(L)
    cdef bint b
    for i from 0<=i<l:
        b = id(O) in <set>PyList_GET_ITEM(L,i)
```
and obtain

```
sage: L = [set(id(GF(p)) for p in prime_range(n,n+500)) for n in range(1,1000)]
sage: O = GF(next_prime(500))
sage: timeit("test1(L,O)", number=2000)
2000 loops, best of 3: 48.9 ¬µs per loop
sage: timeit("test2(L,O)", number=2000)
2000 loops, best of 3: 45.7 ¬µs per loop
sage: timeit("test3(L,O)", number=2000)
2000 loops, best of 3: 70.9 ¬µs per loop
sage: timeit("test4(L,O)", number=2000)
2000 loops, best of 3: 107 ¬µs per loop
sage: timeit("test5(L,O)", number=2000)
2000 loops, best of 3: 87.1 ¬µs per loop
```

So, I would say that it really matters whether or not we should do `<set>PyList_GET_ITEM(L,i)` or `<set>L[i]` (see test2 versus test3), and it also matters whether we do `<size_t><void *>O` or `id(O)` (see test3 versus test4 and test2 versus test5). Assigning to a temporary variable is not good (unless we need the same set twice, of course).

Seeing these data, I think a syntax as in test2 is best. Sure, C3 does more than an element test in a list of sets. But I do think it is a critical step.

<div id="comment:26" align="right">comment:26</div>

This time, I used `%prun f(1000)` for the timings.

When I change the syntax, as suggested in the previous post, I get

```
   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
14000/1000    0.385    0.000    1.330    0.001 {sage.misc.c3.C3_algorithm}
```

With the current version of [attachment: trac_13501-c3-speedup-sk.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13501/trac_13501-c3-speedup-sk.patch.gz), I get

```
   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
14000/1000    0.380    0.000    1.297    0.001 {sage.misc.c3.C3_algorithm}
```
So, a further "complication" of the syntax is not good.

If I use a more readable syntax, hence replace `<sizt_t><void *>` by id and avoid the temporary variable, I get roughly 10% slow-down:

```
   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
14000/1000    0.427    0.000    1.364    0.001 {sage.misc.c3.C3_algorithm}
```

Without the optimization patch (only your main patch), I get

```
   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
14000/1000    0.615    0.000    1.706    0.002 {sage.misc.c3.C3_algorithm}
```

Without your main patch (hence, the old buggy C3 version in Sage), I get

```
   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
14000/1000    0.442    0.000    1.558    0.002 {sage.misc.c3.C3_algorithm}
```

Hence, apparently the current version of my speedup patch is just fine.

The error is when unpickling stuff. In principle, a different mro could change things. On the other hand, this should only affect parent and element classes of categories - and they are pickled by construction (hence, it is not the case that the mro is stored in the pickle).

Anyway, I get:

But that's pure Python, and unrelated with our implementation of C3!

Could it be that the error message randomly choses between "Cannot create ... for bases B, C" and "Cannot create ... for bases C, B"?

If that is the case, I suggest to change the expected error message into "Cannot create a consistent method resolution order (MRO) for bases ..."

That sounds a bit strange indeed (I would have expected C3 to be
completely deterministic, including in its error messages), but I
vaguely remember having to change this order once.

+1

I just did that. I used the occasion to avoid using a temporary
``tail_set`` variable, as recommended by your benchmark. See
[attachment: trac_13501-c3-review-nt.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13501/trac_13501-c3-review-nt.patch.gz) for the changes.  The

all three patches folded together.
