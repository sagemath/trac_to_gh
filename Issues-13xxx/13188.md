This patch does absolutely nothing.

It removes functions that appeared twice in the code by importing them, which should have been done since the beginning. It also updates deprecation warnings.

Hi Nathan,

the patch fails to apply against sage 5.1rc1 (which barring unexpected failures should be released as 5.1 shortly). You probably want to rebase it.

I couldn't run the doctest and it seemed out of place. Now the patch applies and functions, however I get new docstring errors/warnings:

The error seems to be in `chromatic_polynomial()`, but I don't know where the bullet list warning is.

Could you try to see if this patch works better ? There's still a duplicate reference on my computer but I wonder whether it could be some Sphinx cache problem... So it may work on "any machine different from mine" `:-)`
