It removes functions that appeared twice in the code by importing them, which should have been done since the beginning. It also updates deprecation warnings.

Hi Nathan,

the patch fails to apply against sage 5.1rc1 (which barring unexpected failures should be released as 5.1 shortly). You probably want to rebase it.

This fails to apply for me on Sage 5.4.beta1. Additionally the deprecations changed in 5.2 and so sage fails to start properly. Also for line 120 in cliquer.py:

```
sage: C = Graph('DJ{')
```
is that brace `{` suppose to be there?
