Hi Nathan,

the patch fails to apply against sage 5.1rc1 (which barring unexpected failures should be released as 5.1 shortly). You probably want to rebase it.

This fails to apply for me on Sage 5.4.beta1. Additionally the deprecations changed in 5.2 and so sage fails to start properly. Also for line 120 in cliquer.py:

```
sage: C = Graph('DJ{')
```
is that brace `{` suppose to be there?

It is good now. I ran build the first time, got the duplicate reference. Popped the patch off, recompiled sage, pushed the patch, recompiled, then rebuilt the docstrings and it was clean.
