For some codes, the minimum distance is a known parameter. For instance, for Reed-Solomon code, Hamming code, Golay code, etc. For these cases, making Sage compute the minimum distance is quite a wasted effort.

I am introducing a patch which does the following
1. adds an extra parameter `d=None` to `LinearCode`. If `d` is provided, then the minimum distance of the code is set to `d`.
2. An extra attribute `self.__distance` is introduced which stores the distance. If `d` is not provided during the initialization of the class and if the minimum distance has already been computed before, then the computed value is stored in `d` so that it does not need to be recomputed the next time it is called.
3. To force recomputation of the distance, if desired, `LinearCode.minimum_distance()` takes the parameter `algorithm="gap"`.

To see why the patch can be useful, note the long time it takes to (force) compute the distance on a relatively small code:

```
sage: C = ReedSolomonCode(15,6,GF(16,'a'))     
sage: %time C.minimum_distance()               
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00 s
10
sage: %time C.minimum_distance(algorithm='gap') # forcing computation of distance
CPU times: user 0.25 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 0.29 s
Wall time: 8.55 s
10
```

Good, but could you please insert references to the distance data you are plugging in? E.g. I have no clue where to look for the minimum distance of toric codes...
You could insert some (#long time) tests to check your claims for particular values...

Looks like I missed the `ExtendedBinaryGolayCode`, `ExtendedTernaryGolayCode`. I will update the patch with the distances from those codes.
