There used to be such a warning until #11073, and then it was removed. It probably shouldn't have been.

Looks like the message used to be implemented in `$SAGE_ROOT/sage` as this:

```sh
if [ ! -f "$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-sage" ]; then
cat >&2 <<COMPLAINT
************************************************************************
You must compile Sage first using 'make' in the Sage root directory.
(If you have already compiled Sage, you must set the SAGE_ROOT variable
in the file '$0').
************************************************************************
COMPLAINT
    exit 1
fi
```

What does this have to do with `$SAGE_ROOT`? Do we even still want people to manually hardcode the `$SAGE_ROOT` variable anywhere? Isn't that supposed to be automatically determined these days?

I updated the patch to copy to stderr and use lines of asterisks as in the original message, but retained my new message.

Is it just the spkg-install script which needs changing? That makes sense to me anyway, since the sage spkg depends on the scripts spkg, but does not depend (explicitly, anyway) on the root spkg.

It seems that you are attempting to run Sage from an unpacked source

Why so? Do you expect the file type to change between different versions of Sage?

I don't *expect* it to change, but it seems strange to **require** that `libcsage.so` is a symbolic link. Also, the `-L` test will succeed if it is a broken symbolic link.

`-d .../sage` doesn't work because it is a symbolic link and not a directory. The other option is to try `-f .../sage`.

Why don't we instead try something like this? It will check if sage can be imported:

```sh
    python -c 'import sage' > /dev/null 2>&1
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "sage not built blah blah"
        exit 1
    fi
```
I did some tests with this and with checking directory and I don't see much of a difference in the time taken. I ran

```
echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
```
before every call to the `sage -c` command.

Just the default time taken by a simple command (cold starts, i.e. caches were dropped before every command).

```
~ [1] » time sage -c 'print ""'

sage -c 'print ""'  1.42s user 0.64s system 12% cpu 16.334 total
~» time sage -c 'print ""'

sage -c 'print ""'  1.47s user 0.62s system 9% cpu 22.283 total
~» time sage -c 'print ""'

sage -c 'print ""'  1.49s user 0.65s system 11% cpu 18.610 total
```


The same command after removing the `site-packages/sage` symbolic link, and with the check for `python -c 'import sage'` as written above. "aaaa.." was the echo command (cold starts, i.e. caches were dropped before every command).

```
~» time sage -c 'print ""'
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
sage -c 'print ""'  0.09s user 0.04s system 7% cpu 1.605 total
~ [1] » time sage -c 'print ""'
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
sage -c 'print ""'  0.06s user 0.05s system 8% cpu 1.237 total
~ [1] » time sage -c 'print ""'
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
sage -c 'print ""'  0.07s user 0.05s system 2% cpu 5.046 total
~ [1] » time sage -c 'print ""'
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
sage -c 'print ""'  0.06s user 0.04s system 9% cpu 1.159 total
```

The same command but with the check `-d $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python/site-packages/sage` (cold starts, i.e. caches were dropped before every command):

```
~» time sage -c 'print ""'
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
sage -c 'print ""'  0.04s user 0.04s system 4% cpu 1.703 total
~ [1] » time sage -c 'print ""'
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
sage -c 'print ""'  0.04s user 0.05s system 6% cpu 1.244 total
~ [1] » time sage -c 'print ""'
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
sage -c 'print ""'  0.05s user 0.03s system 7% cpu 1.093 total
~ [1] » time sage -c 'print ""'
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
sage -c 'print ""'  0.04s user 0.04s system 1% cpu 4.329 total
~ [1] » time sage -c 'print ""'
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
sage -c 'print ""'  0.04s user 0.04s system 6% cpu 1.212 total
```

Maybe there is a very slight slowdown, of the order of 100ms on using the python command (on a cold start), but it is about 10-20ms on a warm start. Compare this with an unpatched sage file.

Unpatched sage file (warm starts, no caches were dropped):

```
~» time sage -c 'print ""'

sage -c 'print ""'  1.17s user 0.32s system 96% cpu 1.546 total
~» time sage -c 'print ""'

sage -c 'print ""'  1.23s user 0.30s system 99% cpu 1.543 total
~» time sage -c 'print ""'

sage -c 'print ""'  1.27s user 0.29s system 98% cpu 1.579 total
```

Patched sage file with `python -c 'import sage'` (warm starts, no caches were dropped):

```
~» time sage -c 'print ""'

sage -c 'print ""'  1.29s user 0.22s system 96% cpu 1.558 total
~» time sage -c 'print ""'

sage -c 'print ""'  1.28s user 0.28s system 99% cpu 1.564 total
~» time sage -c 'print ""'

sage -c 'print ""'  1.20s user 0.35s system 98% cpu 1.563 total
```

Are you sure it doesn't work?  Being a symbolic link and being a directory are not mutually exclusive (a symbolic link to a directory is both a symbolic link and a directory).

It if really doesn't work for you: what is your version of Sage and of `bash`?

And what is the output of

```
ls -ld "$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python/site-packages/sage"
ls -ld "$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python/site-packages/sage/../../../../devel/sage/build/sage"
```
