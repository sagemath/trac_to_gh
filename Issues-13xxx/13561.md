Looks like the message used to be implemented in `$SAGE_ROOT/sage` as this:

```sh
if [ ! -f "$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-sage" ]; then
cat >&2 <<COMPLAINT
************************************************************************
You must compile Sage first using 'make' in the Sage root directory.
(If you have already compiled Sage, you must set the SAGE_ROOT variable
in the file '$0').
************************************************************************
COMPLAINT
    exit 1
fi
```

What does this have to do with `$SAGE_ROOT`? Do we even still want people to manually hardcode the `$SAGE_ROOT` variable anywhere? Isn't that supposed to be automatically determined these days?

I updated the patch to copy to stderr and use lines of asterisks as in the original message, but retained my new message.

Is it just the spkg-install script which needs changing? That makes sense to me anyway, since the sage spkg depends on the scripts spkg, but does not depend (explicitly, anyway) on the root spkg.

I don't *expect* it to change, but it seems strange to **require** that `libcsage.so` is a symbolic link. Also, the `-L` test will succeed if it is a broken symbolic link.

`-d .../sage` doesn't work because it is a symbolic link and not a directory. The other option is to try `-f .../sage`.

Why don't we instead try something like this? It will check if sage can be imported:

```sh
    python -c 'import sage' > /dev/null 2>&1
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "sage not built blah blah"
        exit 1
    fi
```
I did some tests with this and with checking directory and I don't see much of a difference in the time taken. I ran

```
echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
```
before every call to the `sage -c` command.

Just the default time taken by a simple command (cold starts, i.e. caches were dropped before every command).

```
~ [1] » time sage -c 'print ""'

sage -c 'print ""'  1.42s user 0.64s system 12% cpu 16.334 total
~» time sage -c 'print ""'

sage -c 'print ""'  1.47s user 0.62s system 9% cpu 22.283 total
~» time sage -c 'print ""'

sage -c 'print ""'  1.49s user 0.65s system 11% cpu 18.610 total
```


The same command after removing the `site-packages/sage` symbolic link, and with the check for `python -c 'import sage'` as written above. "aaaa.." was the echo command (cold starts, i.e. caches were dropped before every command).

```
~» time sage -c 'print ""'
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
sage -c 'print ""'  0.09s user 0.04s system 7% cpu 1.605 total
~ [1] » time sage -c 'print ""'
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
sage -c 'print ""'  0.06s user 0.05s system 8% cpu 1.237 total
~ [1] » time sage -c 'print ""'
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
sage -c 'print ""'  0.07s user 0.05s system 2% cpu 5.046 total
~ [1] » time sage -c 'print ""'
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
sage -c 'print ""'  0.06s user 0.04s system 9% cpu 1.159 total
```

The same command but with the check `-d $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python/site-packages/sage` (cold starts, i.e. caches were dropped before every command):

```
~» time sage -c 'print ""'
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
sage -c 'print ""'  0.04s user 0.04s system 4% cpu 1.703 total
~ [1] » time sage -c 'print ""'
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
sage -c 'print ""'  0.04s user 0.05s system 6% cpu 1.244 total
~ [1] » time sage -c 'print ""'
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
sage -c 'print ""'  0.05s user 0.03s system 7% cpu 1.093 total
~ [1] » time sage -c 'print ""'
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
sage -c 'print ""'  0.04s user 0.04s system 1% cpu 4.329 total
~ [1] » time sage -c 'print ""'
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
sage -c 'print ""'  0.04s user 0.04s system 6% cpu 1.212 total
```

Maybe there is a very slight slowdown, of the order of 100ms on using the python command (on a cold start), but it is about 10-20ms on a warm start. Compare this with an unpatched sage file.

Unpatched sage file (warm starts, no caches were dropped):

```
~» time sage -c 'print ""'

sage -c 'print ""'  1.17s user 0.32s system 96% cpu 1.546 total
~» time sage -c 'print ""'

sage -c 'print ""'  1.23s user 0.30s system 99% cpu 1.543 total
~» time sage -c 'print ""'

sage -c 'print ""'  1.27s user 0.29s system 98% cpu 1.579 total
```

Patched sage file with `python -c 'import sage'` (warm starts, no caches were dropped):

```
~» time sage -c 'print ""'

sage -c 'print ""'  1.29s user 0.22s system 96% cpu 1.558 total
~» time sage -c 'print ""'

sage -c 'print ""'  1.28s user 0.28s system 99% cpu 1.564 total
~» time sage -c 'print ""'

sage -c 'print ""'  1.20s user 0.35s system 98% cpu 1.563 total
```

Are you sure it doesn't work?  Being a symbolic link and being a directory are not mutually exclusive (a symbolic link to a directory is both a symbolic link and a directory).

It if really doesn't work for you: what is your version of Sage and of `bash`?

And what is the output of

```
ls -ld "$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python/site-packages/sage"
ls -ld "$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python/site-packages/sage/../../../../devel/sage/build/sage"
```
