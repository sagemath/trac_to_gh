Paulo Seijas reported the following bug on sage-support [1]

```
sage: P = Graph('Dl_')
sage: P.is_prime()
True
```

It can be easily fixed by just updating the code with upstream, as it looks like the bug has been solved since our last update.

That's all this patch does.

Is there anybody who still believes that non-English variable/function names are a good idea? Only in France ;-)

Since "upstream" is just a C file without anything (not even a makefile) I don't see any point in making it a spkg.

> Is there anybody who still believes that non-English variable/function names are a good idea? Only in France ;-)

Come ooooooooooon.. At least there are no accents in the function's name`:-P`

And it is nice sometimes to name a list "liste", because list is a Python keyword `:-P`

> Since "upstream" is just a C file without anything (not even a makefile) I don't see any point in making it a spkg.

Well, just to emphasize that it is some external code, and that it hasn't been reviewed by Sage developpers... That's the normal procedures, but I believe less and less in procedures and laws these days `:-P`

Possible, though for that you would have to compile with `-fextended-identifiers` and use `\uNNNN` escapes instead of accented characters...

And the spelling works for French & German!

I thought you'd rebase it on #17950, then fixing the invalid array accesses you discovered, which would probably also fix the issues on MacOS X.

I do not know how to fix this invalid array access. I seems to be the problem, but I did not write that code myself and what I did yesterday is remind it to the authors. Hoping that they will do something about it.
