Paulo Seijas reported the following bug on sage-support [1]

```
sage: P = Graph('Dl_')
sage: P.is_prime()
True
```

It can be easily fixed by just updating the code with upstream, as it looks like the bug has been solved since our last update.

That's all this patch does.

Since "upstream" is just a C file without anything (not even a makefile) I don't see any point in making it a spkg.

Come ooooooooooon.. At least there are no accents in the function's name`:-P`

And it is nice sometimes to name a list "liste", because list is a Python keyword `:-P`

> Since "upstream" is just a C file without anything (not even a makefile) I don't see any point in making it a spkg.


Well, just to emphasize that it is some external code, and that it hasn't been reviewed by Sage developpers... That's the normal procedures, but I believe less and less in procedures and laws these days `:-P`

Possible, though for that you would have to compile with `-fextended-identifiers` and use `\uNNNN` escapes instead of accented characters...

And the spelling works for French & German!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.
