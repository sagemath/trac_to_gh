Add functionality to `DyckWord` and `DyckWords` classes including:

* the ability to input a Dyck word by specifying the area sequence of the corresponding path
* injections/surjections to other combinatorial objects (e.g. touch composition, Haglund's area<->bounce map, etc.)
* combinatorial statistics (e.g. number of touch points, length of first/last run, area, bounce, dinv)
* connections with symmetric functions
* a pretty print function

It moreover makes the distinction (ie implements two different classes `DyckWords_class` and `DyckWords_complete` between complete Dyck words and uncomplete ones, since many methods are only defined for complete Dyck words.

You should add doctests to all fonctions.

And try not to insert new trailing whitespaces.

Two doctests are failing. They seem to be caused by changes in other places. Just change them to their new value.

I think I got the trailing whitespaces.  I had a mistake when I searched for them before.
I changed doc-tests failing in combinat/q_analogues.py and misc/latex.py.
I am not seeing the missing doc-tests.

Christian has asked to resolve a question about if we should join functions of the form .to_xyz_avoiding_permutation() to a .to_permutation() function in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-combinat-devel/jzGHkbcrLec/9WurflNlyEoJ

Hi,

I'd give this ticket a positive review as is. Nonetheless, I would prefer if someone else is giving his/her okay as well since I made many changes in this ticket myself.

Two issues I somehow do not like with Dyck words (but, if desired, should be taken care of in another ticket) are:

- the `__repr__` and the `__str__` methods for Dyck words differ:

```
sage: D = DyckWord([1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0])
sage: D
[1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
sage: print D
((()())(()))
```

- We now distinguish between complete and uncomplete Dyck words (and implicitly did that before as well). But iterating through `DyckWords` only yield complete Dyck words.

```
sage: I = iter(DyckWords())                   
sage: for i in range(10):^J    print I.next() 
....:     

()
()()
(())
()()()
()(())
(())()
(()())
((()))
()()()()
```

Would you expect this behaviour? Are there better solutions for those?

Best, Christian

I have looked at Christian's changes and approve.  This patch is ready to go.

About the two issues:

* I don't object strongly to the !__str!__ and the !__repr!__ being different, but I can see that is a bit unusual.  This patch adds a pretty_print method (and this isn't it at all), but we could rename !__str!__() to be .pp() or put an optional argument in .to_string(parens=True)

* I think that this seems like correct behavior to me. There isn't a natural way of iterating through incomplete DyckWords() that I would find particularly helpful.  As it is, if you want to access incomplete Dyck words you need to specify the the number of open and close parentheses.  That is DyckWords() is all complete DyckWords, DyckWords(n) is Dyck words with n open and n close and DyckWords(n,k) is Dyck words with n open and k close.  The truth is, I don't have a use for iterating through all complete/incomplete Dyck words.

The change to latex_extra_preamble came from a call to latex.add_package_to_preamble_if_available("tikz").  This was moved into its proper place and the change to latex.py was removed.  Christian will upload the patch since I don't have overwrite permission.

I do not know who I should send this to, but the following line fails, at least on my computer 

```
sage: view( DyckWord([1,0]))
```

This ticket is the last one which modified the ._latex_ function of Dyck words.
