Is "content" a well-known thing (especially for non-polynomials)?  I did find the definition in the Ginac documentation, but this should probably be slightly clarified since it will show up in the tab-completion.    Especially since this doesn't provide the corresponding `unit` and `primpart` methods (which might even be confused with other things in algebra) I'm reluctant for this to go in by itself.  Also,

```
sage: (2*x+4*sin(y)).content(2*x)
2*x + 4*sin(y)
```
and things like that seem to not really be in the spirit of this.  If anything, shouldn't this content be `1`?  Or should this be disallowed?  I don't think it can be considered user error with such minimal doc of an unfamiliar term.

That said, I realize this is needed for #13609 and hence #13729, so I will try to be responsive to any responses!

Thanks for looking into this.

I can rename the function to `_content()` and add a warning that the behavior is not well defined. I doubt if we will ever have proper input error checking or consistency with Sage's description of content for various domains. I definitely don't have time to implement this.

<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
It would be less confusing if we also wrap GiNaC unit and primpart and copy in some of the documentation

```
The methods

     ex ex::unit(const ex & x);
     ex ex::content(const ex & x);
     ex ex::primpart(const ex & x);
     ex ex::primpart(const ex & x, const ex & c);

return the unit part, content part, and primitive polynomial of a
multivariate polynomial with respect to the variable ‘x’ (the
unit part being the sign of the leading coefficient, the content
part being the GCD of the coefficients, and the primitive
polynomial being the input polynomial divided by the unit and
content parts). The second variant of primpart() expects the
previously calculated content part of the polynomial in c, which
enables it to work faster in the case where the content part has
already been computed. The product of unit, content, and
primitive part is the original polynomial.
```
This is `FactorTermsList[poly, x]` in Mathematica, so perhaps we can have a non-underscore method that returns all three?

Having `primpart()` and `unit()` available clarifies what these functions do. The answers they return are what one would expect as long as no exotic coefficients are involved. I don't know what would happen if you have a polynomial where the coefficients live in different domains. But this is the case for most symbolics functionality. I say we merge this and see if anyone complains. :)

That said, I don't understand why the patchbot complains about startup time. These patches should not effect that at all.
