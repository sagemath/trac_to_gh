#11795 allows one to customize viewers for DVI, PDF, PNG, and HTML content.

it would also be nice to allow one to customize the viewer for 3D plots.  (i guess this means supplying a path to something that looks like jmol.)

The default viewer can be changed using the following, for example in `init.sage`:

```
sage.plot.plot3d.base.SHOW_DEFAULTS['viewer'] = 'jmol'
```

Is what is being requested a way to do so through that same `viewer` object from #11795? Like:

```
viewer.plot3d('jmol')
```

...and/or to update the documentation to make this feature known? Perhaps by updating the [plot3d introduction](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plot3d/sage/plot/plot3d/introduction.html)?

this is a *very* old request i made.  i don't know if `sage.plot.plot3d.base.SHOW_DEFAULTS['viewer']` was available then.  but, i would say its existence now is enough to close this request.  thank you very much.
