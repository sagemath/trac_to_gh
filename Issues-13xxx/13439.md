`xgcd` is broken for padics:

```
sage: R.<x> = Qp(3,3)[]
sage: f = 3*x + 7
sage: g = 5*x + 9
sage: f.xgcd(f*g)[0].is_one()
True

sage: R.<x> = Qp(3)[]
sage: f = 490473657*x + 257392844/729
sage: g = 225227399/59049*x - 8669753175
sage: f.xgcd(f*g)[0].is_one()
True
```

The algorithm used is the standard Euclidean algorithm which is afaik not correct for inexact fields. Or are my examples somehow incorrect?

Just found out about stopgaps. A stopgap makes of course much more sense than just removing functionality.

I have now created git branches for all of this ticket's dependencies and merged them here.  Unfortunately the tests in this ticket description now trigger an error:

So there are some problems here, possibly caused by my rebasing . . .
