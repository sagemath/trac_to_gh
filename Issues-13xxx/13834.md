The linestyle argument is inconsistent across plots, as already pointed out in #13423. It seems this is spread out throughout many Sage components including `sage.plot.*` and `sage.graphs.graph_plot`.

Hello, Thanks for looking into this ticket. I will be able to do a more thorough review only later this week. With a casual look at the patch, I have the following comments about the formatting. In general, you can look at the [Sage developer's guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html) on how to format certain things.

1. Try to limit the lengths of your lines to about 80 characters. An example of how code can be written to fit within that limit is given in [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length). Very long lines are hard to read and edit. Long strings can also be broken up like this

```
    ValueError("this is a valueerror for %d"
               "something something %s.\n"
               "something else"%(20, 'abc'))
```
2. Don't try to catch the `ValueError` that is raised inside the new function `get_matplotlib_linestyle`. So you can get rid of the `try` block and `import verbose`.
3. In the docstrings, write the strings inside double backticks like this

```
    - ``linestyle`` - (default: ``'solid'``) The style of the line, which is one of
      ``'dashed'``, ``'dotted'``, ``'solid'`` ....
```

Hi

thanks for the extensive improvements!

I did the following in order to test the patches:

```
$ ./sage --testall --long
all tests passed
```

```
/sage -docbuild reference html
```
Built without errors or warnings

checked coverage of changed files:
There are only some old missing coverages in hyperbolic_arc and hyperbolic_triangle. But I'm not sure how one should test them reasonably.

The only thing which seems to be a little bit unlogical for me is:

```
        301         Linestyles with ``"default"`` or ``"steps"`` in them should also be 
 	302	    properly handled.  For instance, matplotlib understands only the short 
 	303	    version when ``"steps"`` is used:: 
 	304	 
 	305	        sage: get_matplotlib_linestyle("default", "short") 
 	306	        '' 
 	307	        sage: get_matplotlib_linestyle("steps--", "short") 
 	308	        'steps--' 
 	309	        sage: get_matplotlib_linestyle("steps-predashed", "long") 
 	310	        'steps-pre--' 
```

Wouldn't the following be more reasonable: If matplotlib in some functions only understand linestyles "stepsdashed" the function get_matplotlib_linestyle should be called with the "short" keyword (as you do it in lines.py) but the keyword shouldn't be ignored in the function itself. But I don't see that this makes any problems so its just a question.

I also tried to play with the enhanced functions and encountered no further problems.

In any case: Since I'm inexperienced someone more experienced should have a final look in order to confirm the patches.

Since `get_matplotlib_linestyle` is an internal function I just made it silently output the correct result even on incorrect input. maptlotlib understands only the short form in those cases and so I think it is safe to output the short form always when we know that there is no alternative.

Thanks for checking them. I had checked some but not all.

There were two rejects when I tried to apply the patches on 5.10.rc1 but short of this it looks good to me. Could you please rebase it ? I will then run all tests and set the ticket to `positive_review` `:-)`
