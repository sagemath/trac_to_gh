We have

```
sage: A.<a,b> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: A._is_category_initialized()
False
sage: isinstance(A,Ring)
True
```

Since `Ring.__init__` initialises the category, it seems that the the base class' initialisation is not called. That also prevents us from removing the alias for `_Hom_` in sage.rings.ring - see #12876.

Just 2 cents: alternatively, it could possibly call Parent.__init__ but passing down the appropriate category.

I think I'll even be getting category and coercion framework right (there was `__call__`, there was no `self.Element`, there was no `_coerce_map_from_`). With the patch I'm preparing:

```
sage: A.<a> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: TestSuite(A).run()
sage: A.<a,b> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: TestSuite(A).run()
```

Need to document the new stuff, though.

Hi Simon,

I am not sure I'll get through the review, but I am now browsing through the patch while Sage compiles C3. Here are some little comments:

Near the TestSuite calls, I see things like:

```
    sage: loads(dumps(X)) is X
    True
```
This is a generic test, so I'd rather not include those, and if you feel strong about them to add it as a generic test in the TestSuite. Maybe the X._test_pickling() should check whether X has unique representation, and test with `is` or `==` accordingly? Or instead one could just check elsewhere that equality is indeed defined in term of ``is`` (like testting whether the __eq__ method is that inherited from UniqueRepresentation)

line 362: this should be `is_MPowerSeriesRing(S)`:

```
        if (is_MPolynomialRing(S) or is_MPowerSeriesRing)
```

Cheers,
                     Nicolas

I added it near the `TestSuite` calls, *because* it looks like a generic test (I argue below that it isn't really generic), and because the `TestSuite` does not (and can not, I think) cover it.

> Maybe the X._test_pickling() should check whether X has unique representation, and test with `is` or `==` accordingly?

I thought that to `TestSuite(X)` belong all generic tests that only depend on the category of X. But apparently `X.category()` will not tell whether X is a unique parent.

Moreover, doing `if isinstance(self, UniqueRepresentation)` or testing the `__eq__` method would certainly not cover all unique parents. Namely some of them are created by a `UniqueFactory`. In that case, neither the category nor the class give a hint on whether pickling should work with `X is loads(dumps(X))`.

Just think of polynomial rings: They are unique parents, but that's because of a polynomial ring constructor, and they do have

```
    cdef int _cmp_c_impl(left, Parent right) except -2:
        if isinstance(right, (MPolynomialRing_libsingular, MPolynomialRing_polydict_domain)):
            return cmp((left.base_ring(), map(str, left.gens()), left.term_order()),
                       (right.base_ring(), map(str, right.gens()), right.term_order()))
        else:
            return cmp(type(left),type(right))
```

The `X is loads(dumps(X))` thus *not* being generic, I think it clearly does not belong to `TestSuite(X)`. I do feel strongly about having that test in addition `TestSuite(X)`.

> line 362: this should be `is_MPowerSeriesRing(S)`:
> 
> ```
>         if (is_MPolynomialRing(S) or is_MPowerSeriesRing)
> ```


Right. And there should obviously be a test where `is_MPowerSeriesRing(S)` is needed.
