For non-commutative rings the method `Matrix_sparse._matrix_times_vector_` does not take care of the right multiplication order in the ring, for example:
 
```
sage: A.<x,y> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, 2)
sage: P.<x,y> = A.g_algebra(relations={y*x:-x*y}, order = 'lex')
sage: M = Matrix([[x]])
sage: v = vector([y])
sage: M*v
(x*y)
sage: M.sparse_matrix()*v
(-x*y)
```

This patch fixes this bug.

Done. I was not sure how to catch the UserWarning on modules over non-commutative
rings. Is this the right way?

Best wishes,

Hey Thomas,

I don't think so. The best way is to have the warning output in the doctest (or if possible, change the doctest to avoid the warning).

Thanks,

The indentation in the doctest isn't right. It should be

```

        sage: ...
