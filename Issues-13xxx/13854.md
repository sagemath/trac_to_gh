```
For non-commutative rings the method `Matrix_sparse._matrix_times_vector_` does not take care of the right multiplication order in the ring, for example:
 

```
sage: A.<x,y> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, 2)
sage: P.<x,y> = A.g_algebra(relations={y*x:-x*y}, order = 'lex')
sage: M = Matrix([[x]])
sage: v = vector([y])
sage: M*v
(x*y)
sage: M.sparse_matrix()*v
(-x*y)
```

This patch fixes this bug.

Done. I was not sure how to catch the UserWarning on modules over non-commutative
rings. Is this the right way?

Best wishes,

Hey Thomas,

I don't think so. The best way is to have the warning output in the doctest (or if possible, change the doctest to avoid the warning).

Thanks,
