Implement a map reduce algorithm in parallel on large sets described by a `SearchForest`. We use a work-stealing algorithm (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_stealing) based on Python's multiprocessing.

Salut Florent et Nathann,

I am starting to think/work on #6637... I have some questions. Mainly, I would like to know what is this ticket, because the above one liner in the description does not say much...

- Will SearchForest survive or not? 
- Does it replace SearchForest?
- Does it improve SearchForest? 
- Does it use SearchForest?
- Or is it used by SearchForest?

Also, Florent wrote on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/5XHvEx89RlQ/Tb_QBWepC5YJ) in October 2012 that 

```
   I'm also in the process of finalizing a patch which do parallel and even
   distributed map-reduce on recursively enumerated sets (currently badly named
   SearchForest, I'll change the name in my patch, ticket #13580, patch on
   Sage-Combinat queue [1]).
```

- I do not see in the cited patch that the name of SearchForest is changed.
- What would be a better name for SearchForest ?
- What patch is the more recent? the "old" one or the "experimental" one?

```
    trac_13580-map_reduce-fh.patch #+experimental
    map_reduce_improved_loop-fh.patch #+experimental
    map_reduce_condition-fh.patch #+experimental
    trac_13580-map_reduce-old-fh.patch 
```

Dear Florent, I know that you like multiline doctests, but for two reasons I prefer to avoid them as much as possible in doctests:

1. It is not fun for the user who wants to adapt an example after a copy paste in the console. The up arrow brings the multiline all at once and it is not fun to change the value 10 to a value 25 let say.
2. Using variables to store the input before calling the method gives lot of information easily to the user: what are the argument names, in what order should they be used.

I know I am asking you to change your style by asking you this, but don't you agree with me or can you provide some counter-arguments to mine? I give an example below:

I'm tempted to answer that I don't have this problem with emacs ;-). Of course, for the people using a two letters editor...

I'm much more convinced by this argument. I'm watching an exam tomorrow evening. I'll change my code accordingly.

Actually, I'm not that much convinced. It's not clear for me that

```
      sage: map_function = lambda x: 1
      sage: reduce_function = lambda x,y: x+y
      sage: reduce_init = 0
      sage: S.map_reduce(map_function, reduce_function, reduce_init)
      131071
```
is much better than

```
      sage: S.map_reduce(
      ....:   map_function = lambda x: 1,
      ....:   reduce_function = lambda x,y: x+y,
      ....:   reduce_init = 0 )
```
In this second version which is the style I adopted in `map_reduce.py`, we don't repeat the name twice, which is better in my opinion.

A third possibility is

```
      sage: S.map_reduce(lambda x: 1, lambda x,y: x+y, 0)
```
It is the one used through the whole `backtrack.py` files. Unless for very short example, I don't find it very readable. But since it's not adding new code but changing old one, which needs even more cleanup and doc improvement, I'd rather keep it for another ticket. More precisly, I'd rather do that during #16351.

What do you think ?

Is this happening on MacOS ? I know that Semaphore are implemented differently on this system. See in particular [the note](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#synchronization-primitives) after class `multiprocessing.BoundedSemaphore`, where it says:

    on Unix platforms like Mac OS X where sem_getvalue() is not implemented.

If so and if the rests behave correctly, I'm tempted to replace the doctests with

```
    <Semaphore(value=...)>
```

What do you think ?

I didn't document this one because I'm was not sure It was a sensible default. If you think it is then let's go for it.

By the way thanks for your careful review !!!

<div id="comment:67" align="right">comment:67</div>

Hello and merry christmas every one,

I have some question on this ticket.

Firstly, I don't understand the documentation from the line 571:

```
    Decription of the map/reduce operation:

    - ``map_function=f`` -- (default to ``None``)
    - ``reduce_function=red`` -- (default to ``None``)
    - ``reduce_init=init`` -- (default to ``None``)
```

What means `f`, `red` and `init`? My opinion is that `f`, `red`and `init` are irrelevant but an example should be interesting at this point: 

(copy-paste of one in the module documentation)

```
 sage: from sage.parallel.map_reduce import RESetMapReduce
 sage: S = RESetMapReduce(
 ....:   roots = [[]],
 ....:   children = lambda l: [l+[0], l+[1]] if len(l) <= 15 else [],
 ....:   map_function = lambda x : 1,
 ....:   reduce_function = lambda x,y: x+y,
 ....:   reduce_init = 0 )
 sage: S.run()
 131071
```

Ok, there is the `seealso` which says go to see the documentation of the module for examples, but one example there is interesting, no?

Then it seems there is some useless import (like line 1345 `from multiprocessing import current_process`) (I try to compile sage soon and I can remove all useless import if you want).

Finally, I'm not sure to understand the use of `AbortError`. It is used to abort the computation and to say to the workers and the thiefs every think is done?

Jean-Baptiste

Hello,

I can reproduce test failures on El Capitan (os x):

- [log_map_reduce](http://kerios.fr/downloads/sage/2016/log_map_reduce)
- [log_map_reduce2](http://kerios.fr/downloads/sage/2016/log_map_reduce2)
- [log_map_reduce3](http://kerios.fr/downloads/sage/2016/log_map_reduce3)

I run 3 tests and I obtained 3 distincts failures. My problem is that if I try to execute those lines which fails in sage terminal (several times) then it does not fail!

Is it possible that the test environment is not robust specially on mac os?

I read the code and I don't know how to understand this:

```
res = post_process(node)
if res is not None:
    self._res = reduc(self._res, mapp(res))
```

in the worker code of `walk_branch_locally` method.

I think this is useless, no? Or if not then the documentation of `post_process` function should be improve to specify that if `post_process` returns `None` then there is a specific behavior.

Ok, this behavior is specify in the documentation of `RESetMapReduce` but this is not specified in paragraph (line 135) associated of this module.

I propose two solutions:

I'm clearly in Favor of this solution. We assume that `None` doesn't blong to the set described by the underlying RESet. Note that this is something which concerns more the underlying RESet than the map-reduce computation.

We finally got the problem with Jean-Baptiste. It occurs that semaphore are broken on MacOSX (or at least are not fully POSIX compliant). In particular, on standard unixes, when two processes are trying to acquire a semaphore whose value is more than two, they always both succeeded. On MacOS, one of them may fail.

Is there a standard Sage/Python way to check if we are on MacOS ?

<div id="comment:94" align="right">comment:94</div>

some typos:

`compute the the cardinality`

`its job. Non only mapping` -> `Not only`

`method so that to compute the number of element you only need to call::` -> wrap the line

`precedingly by we only ` -> `previously`? , `but` 

I would suggest to replace this:

```
        OUTPUT: Calling :meth:`task_done` decrement the counter and returns
        its value after the decrementation.
```

by

```
        OUTPUT: 

        Calling :meth:`task_done` decrement the counter and returns
        its value after the decrementation.
```

to follow sage standards (more than once).

Also, I would replace this:

```
INPUT: ``o`` -- a node
```

by

```
INPUT: 

- ``o`` -- a node
```

to follow sage standards (more than once).

`the computation are done i` -> s missing

Sebastien is currently rereading it. I think he is very close to put a positive review.

> Also, what are the current plans to cythonize `SearchForest` and the parallel reduce map?

Concerning Cythonization of map-reduce, my current opinion is that, the code
is designed for case where the computation of the children is costly. In this
case the cost of the current code should be negligible. There are a lot of
function calls, I'm using Python synchronization primitive, but most
importantly, communication is are by pickling/unpickling which is very
slow. So the idea is to reduce at most at possible the communication, but
without drastically changing the technology, I don't think you get a large
improvement without great effort. You'll need to rewrite all the communication
primitive and to inline the function call to the client code.

On the other hand, If you are allowed to write the code directly in C/C++
(which is the case for small basic objects), then the Cilk extension of C is
wonderful. It's a small extension which is supported by GCC since version 5,
ICC and in recent CLANG (https://cilkplus.github.io/). I've several code where
I've been able to have very large speedup. See
e.g. https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00823339/file/article.pdf if you are
curious.

Now if you have a specific use case, I'll be happy to experiment.

Christian, Vivien, and I are working on trying to speed up the iteration of finite Coxeter groups by using (subgroups of) permutation groups and the iterator method of generic Coxeter groups, which uses a `SearchForest` (see #11187 and the `CoxeterGroups` category). Our goal is to try and match or beat GAP3 iteration time (which we are about ~30x slower).

We are in the process pushing our successor computation code to Cython and some of our other methods, but we would appreciate any insights you have.

Yet the code on this ticket will definitely help with that. Thank you for finishing it.

I'll be both very happy and interested to have usecase for this code.

Do you have a typical example relying on `SearchForest` of code on top of
#11187 that I can profile ? Note that I included in the documentation of
map_reduce.py a guide on how to profile the parallel code. I'd like to measure
the proportion of time that is spend on Coxeter code one one hand and on the
parallel infrastructure on the other.


Now, concerning coxeter group, I'm quite sure that rewriting part of the code
in C/C++ and using advanced parallel stuff (AVX instruction set + SIMD) you
can get speedup a large as several hundreds and even thousand ! As a witness
on https://github.com/hivert/IVMPG I wrote a code whose goal is to enumerate
integer vector modulo permutation group. Compared to the code we have in Sage
which has been Cythonized and optimized by Simon King I manage to get speedup
a large as x2000 ! I need help on the build system to be able to distribute
it. I'm pretty sure the code there is very similar to what you need in Coxeter
groups.

By the way, should we transfer this discussion on #11187 ?

This ticket breaks the doctests on my patchbot, i do not know whether it is because it is run from a VM or from a 32-bit system, see http://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/0/debian/8.3/i686/3.16.0-4-586/tmonteil-debian-jessie-32/2016-04-15%2012:13:01?short
