Teaser
------

Python handles multiple inheritance by computing, for each class,
a linear extension of all its super classes (the Method Resolution
Order, MRO). The MRO is calculated recursively from local
information (the *ordered* list of the direct super classes), with
the so-called ``C3`` algorithm. This algorithm can fail if the local
information is not consistent; worst, there exist hiearchies of
classes with provably no consistent local information.

For large hierarchy of classes, like those derived from categories in
Sage, maintaining consistent local information by hand does not scale
and leads to unpredictable ``C3`` failures (the dreaded "could not
find a consistent method resolution order"); a maintenance nightmare.

This patch implements a final solution to this problem. Namely, it
allows for building automatically the local information from the bare
class hierarchy in such a way that guarantees that the ``C3``
algorithm will never fail.

Err, but you said that this was provably impossible? Well, not if
one relaxes a bit the hypotheses, but that's not something one
would want to do by hand :-)

Details
-------

Please see the extensive documentation at the top of the file
sage/misc/c3_controlled.py in the attached patch.

Content of the patch
--------------------

- Implement controlled C3 in sage.misc.c3_controlled.

- Implement a total order in Category, and have Category use
  C3 controlled by this order instead of plain C3.

- Tweak the current total order to minimize changes in the order of
  categories.

- Update doctests w.r.t. remaining changes of in the order of
  categories.

- Remove a coupld doctests displaying "all_super_categories" that did not bring useful information to the user nor intesting test, yet needed to be constantly updated; nothing but a good source of conflicts.

- Rewrite doctests in sage.misc.c3 to be independent of categories
  since those do not use anymore this implementation of C3.

- Resolve some ambiguities to make the code more independent of the
  order of categories. In particular, FiniteCoxeterGroups prefer
  __iter__ and some_elements from CoxeterGroups to that of
  FiniteGroups.

- Update the section in the primer about order of categories.

- Provide further tools in ``sage.misc.c3_controlled`` to
  experiment with C3 and friends.

- Extract category_sample from category_graph

Credits
-------

This patch is a followup to a study of the C3 algorithm together with
Florent Hivert, and to discussions with Simon King and his
implementation of C3.

Hello,

Could you update your patch, there is several hunk in the last sage versions (i work without combinat to use NCSF...)

```
patching file sage/categories/category.py
Hunk #6 FAILED at 1090
Hunk #7 FAILED at 1200
Hunk #9 FAILED at 2003
Hunk #10 FAILED at 2084
4 out of 11 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/categories/category.py.rej
abort: patch failed to apply
```

Furthermore, it could be useful to add that quickly in sage. The graded Hopf algebras seems to be the last bastion before recurrent MRO errors.

Thanks, Jean-Baptiste

Hi Simon,

The updated patch should be roughly close to completion. Most if not all tests should pass (they did when I was working on the patch in git; I may have screwed up my export back to mercurial, and/or some dependencies).

I still need to scan once again through the patch to check that everything is 100% doctested, and I also want to reread the explanations in sage.misc.c3_controlled. I'll do that tomorrow. But I think you can start reviewing it in particular checking whether the whole logic makes sense to you. Let me know if/when you start working on it so that we avoid conflicts.

Thanks!
                                Nicolas

Hi Simon,

The patch is now completely ready for review:
- I fixed the coverage and continuation issue. 
- I cythoned sage.misc.c3_controlled; hopefuly this will fix the startup time regression
- I went through the whole module, improved the doc and threw away some scories.
- I don't know why the bot complains about the non existent modules sage.categories.inspect and itertools. I guess its just confused. As for sage.misc.c3_controlled, well yes, it's new :-)
- I am running all long tests, and will report soon.

Thanks for your upcoming review!

Off to work on the main functorial construction patch!

The cythonization has not improved the startup time. It's not yet clear to me what can be causing the slower startup time. To be investigated ...

Some random remarks:

- Why is `Category._cmp_key` a cached method and not a lazy attribute?
- Why is `CategoryWithParameters._cmp_key` a method and not a lazy attribute or at least a cached method?
- Why has this example

  ```
  sage: Groups().example().algebra(ZZ).categories()
  ...
  ```
  been completely removed from sage/categories/groups.py? Similarly `sage: Modules(Integers(9)).all_super_categories()` from sage/categories/modules.py etc.
- In the documentation of primer.py:

  ```rst
  However this must be considered as an *implementation detail*: `C_1` 
  and `C_2` are incomparable categories, then the order in which they 
  appear must be mathematically irrelevant:
  ```
  I guess there is "If" missing after the first colon.
- In sage/misc/c3_controlled.pyx, line 123: Should be "classes that an object inherits from.", not "classes that an object inherit from."
- ... line 139, "However, this has several inconvenients:" I guess this should be "However, this has several drawbacks" or "However, this is inconvenient in several regards" or so.


Do I understand correctly: As you outline in lines 148-166, the creation of classes will become slower (`O(n^3)` instead of `O(n^2)` for getting the MRO, etc) if one explicitly puts the desired MRO into a long list of bases. This would certainly be a reason for an increased startup time and other regressions. Therefore, in a first step, you compute *short* lists of bases that ensure that the C3 algorithm still reconstruct the intended MRO. However, is this additional step (namely: Computing lists of bases) takes some time, not affecting the startup time?

I still have to read the actual code (and not just the documentation). One question, though, which is in the spirit of #11935. In sage.categories.category, you have

```python
        (result, bases) = C3_sorted_merge([cat._all_super_categories 
                                           for cat in self._super_categories] + 
                                          [self._super_categories], 
                                          key = attrcall('_cmp_key')) 
        self._super_categories_for_classes = bases 
        return [self] + result 
```
I guess in many cases the result will be the same up to the base rings. Shouldn't we think of a way to avoid duplication of work? I could imagine that here is the reason for the startup time regression.

To be discussed. If I remember correctly, it's slightly easier to use
super in cached methods than attributes, but I guess both would work.

Because they neither bring useful test or information, and
need to be updated whenever the category order changes which is a good
source of conflicts.

Thanks, I'll fix that! Probably on Monday, together with the fix for
the failing long test.

This code is only called if all_super_categories is called. And by
#11935 this should happen only once for all base ring in the same
category.  (unless one calls explicitly all_super_categories).  I have
not kept the timings under hand, but I did not see a difference in our
usual elliptic curves benchmark.

I am not surprise that some posets are easier to control than others. Why do you expect that `all_bases_controlled_len` is the same in all cases?

Even for this example, the number of bases to be added *does* depend on the linear extension.\n\nSo all is good, the python/cython implementations agree.\n\nThe updated patch:\n\n- fixes the typos you mentionned\n- reworks a bit the text to make it clearer that the code implements an optimized \"add bases\" trick which does not have the drawbacks of the brute force approach.\n- fixes the incorrect doctest, and gather some stats on the number of bases to be added for each linear extension\n- mentions the removed doctests, and the rationale for removing them, in the patch header\n\nThere remains to decide between a lazy attribute or a cached method for _cmp_key. Any idea on how to investigate the startup time welcome.\n\nCheers,\n                            Nicolas",

Hi Simon!

It turns out that I had just fooled myself because of a typo in the test. Even for this example, the number of bases to be added *does* depend on the linear extension.

So all is good, the python/cython implementations agree.

The updated patch:

- fixes the typos you mentionned
- reworks a bit the text to make it clearer that the code implements an optimized "add bases" trick which does not have the drawbacks of the brute force approach.
- fixes the incorrect doctest, and gather some stats on the number of bases to be added for each linear extension
- mentions the removed doctests, and the rationale for removing them, in the patch header

There remains to decide between a lazy attribute or a cached method for _cmp_key. Any idea on how to investigate the startup time welcome.

Cheers,
                            Nicolas

While playing with larger hierarchy of classes for the functorial construction patch, I stumbled on one execution path which was not treated correctly. I'll post an updated patch shortly.

Ok, the updated patch includes the (hopefuly) now correct implementation together with relevant tests. At this occasion, I declared a couple more variables for cython and added some debugging code (commented out by default).

You can look at :attachment:c3-fix-nt.patch if you just want to see the changes.

I guess last time I wrote such a long function was when I played around with F5! It would be a good candidate for a computer assisted proof of correctness or for automatic test generation.

This is a minimal example of what Nicolas wants to do:

```
sage: class A(object):
    @lazy_attribute
    def x(self):
        print "computing the attribute with A"
        return 1
....:     
sage: class B(A):
    @lazy_attribute
    def x(self):
        print "this is lazy attribute with B"
        r= super(B,self).x
        self.y = r
        return r
....:     
sage: b = B()
sage: b.x
this is lazy attribute with B
computing the attribute with A
1
sage: b.y
1
```

So, it seems to work with lazy attribute, and this will be much faster than calling a method (repeatedly). Trying to change it now.

To me, the code looks fine. Patchbot does not report any errors. However, it reports a significant increase of 2.5% of startup time.

How can this be analysed?

Something findings:

- C3_sorted_merge was called 121 times with the current patch during startup.
- C3_sorted_merge is called on different Groupoids, which should not happen, because all groupoids have the same super categories. Solution: Make it `CategoryWithParameters`. Then, C3_sorted_merge is only called 93 times during startup.
- There are some optimizations possible in C3_sorted_merge:

```
sage: L1 = Fields().all_super_categories()
sage: L2 = Algebras(QQ).all_super_categories()
sage: cython("""
def test1(list L):
    cdef list out = L[::-1]
def test2(list L):
    cdef list out = list(reversed(L))
""")
....: 
sage: %timeit test1(L1)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 541 ns per loop
sage: %timeit test2(L1)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.25 us per loop
```
and

```
sage: cython("""
....: def test1(list L):
....:     cdef set S = set(x for x in L)
....: def test2(list L):
....:     cdef set S = set([x for x in L])
....: """)
....: 
sage: %timeit test1(L1)
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.91 us per loop
sage: %timeit test2(L1)
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.99 us per loop
sage: %timeit test1(L1)
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.89 us per loop
sage: %timeit test1(L1)
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.89 us per loop
sage: %timeit test2(L1)
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.06 us per loop
```

In both examples above, test2 is what is currently done in C3_sorted_merge, and test1 is apparently what *should* be done. I am preparing a patch now.

On my computer, running startuptime once, it seemed to me that the problem was close to being solved. However, the patchbot still sees a slow-down of 2.5% with very high confidence.

So, let's try to find further tweaks.

100 loops, best of 3: 10.8 ms per loop
sage: %timeit test(L,sk)
100 loops, best of 3: 12.9 ms per loop
```

So, in C3_controlled, we could implement this cpdef inline function as the default key for comparison.

In addition, we could decide that the key *must* return a tuple, because this is the format of Category._cmp_key. But this would mean we loose flexibility.

Let's do some statistics.

This is what I get in three runs of `sage -startuptime`, when only the dependencies of this ticket are applied.

```
    29.550   1376.061          4  sage.all
Total time (sum over exclusive time): 1455.386ms
    30.054   1389.055          4  sage.all
Total time (sum over exclusive time): 1469.172ms
    29.410   1376.077          4  sage.all
Total time (sum over exclusive time): 1455.600ms
```

Adding the first patch from here

```
    28.707   1390.722          4  sage.all
Total time (sum over exclusive time): 1470.469ms
    28.887   1397.835          4  sage.all
Total time (sum over exclusive time): 1477.698ms
    28.699   1409.829          4  sage.all
Total time (sum over exclusive time): 1489.124ms
```

Is that really a significant slow-down? I don't think so.

And when applying the other patches (including an update of the last, that I did not post yet):

```
    29.099   1386.676          4  sage.all

Here is another possibility to speed things up: Replace itertools.count() by a cpdef method, defined in some auxiliary file.

Timing:

```
sage: cython("""
cdef long counter = 0
cpdef count1():
    global counter
    counter += 1
    return counter
def count2():
    cdef long c = 0
    while True:
        c += 1
        yield c
""")
sage: C = count1
sage: %timeit a = C()
10000000 loops, best of 3: 73.8 ns per loop
sage: C = count2()
sage: %timeit a = C.next()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 252 ns per loop
sage: import itertools
sage: C = itertools.count()
sage: %timeit a = C.next()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 231 ns per loop
```

Note that this would also make the startup_module plugin happy, since it complains about the new import of itertools during startup.

Thanks for the timings! The startup gain should be of roughly 50*(231-74)ns which will be anyway far less than a ms and negligible. I would thus tend to stick to the standard Python module itertools, and ignore the little indicator from the startup module plugin.

As for the time increase: I will post a poll on sage-devel later today.

Too late... I already posted an update of my patch.

Well, I'd say let the patchbot try, at least.

Thank you.

I've put the cpdef counter into sage.misc.c3_controlled---I think this is a good place, given that it is needed when applying the controlled c3 in categories.

With the original patch, one had `Category._cmp_key_generator.next()`, hence, two attribute lookups and a function call. With the new patch, one just has one function call, which also seems to be faster than the function call to `next()`.

Let us keep our fingers crossed concerning the findings of the patchbot...

In the computation of _cmp_key, it says:

```
    atoms = ("FacadeSets", "Finite", "Infinite", "EnumeratedSets", "FiniteDimensionalModulesWithBasis", "GradedModules", "ModulesWithBasis", "AdditiveMagmas", "Magmas", "Semigroups", "Monoids", "FinitePermutationGroups", "Rngs", "Domains")

```

First a Python question: Will the tuple `atoms` be constructed repeatedly in this method? If this is the case, it might be better to move it to module level.

Second question: With the exception of "Finite" and "FiniteDimensionalModulesWithBases", the atoms are pairwise incompatible, in the sense of "if classname starts with one of the atoms, then it will certainly not start with any other atom". Hence, it seems possible to rewrite it such that the `for` loop is quit after the first case in which the `if` clause is true.

But again, probably a speed gain in a method that is called only once will be negligible.

We have to save a total of about 70 ms in 93 function calls. This is not much, and perhaps it could be obtained by cythoning the computation of _cmp_key.

Also, you do

```
assert not isinstance(self, JoinCategory)
```
and later comment

```
for cat in self._super_categories: # not self.super_categories() to avoid join categories!

So, is the assertion not needed, after all?

Are the patch bots out of work? I've not seen any non-grey blob recently.

Anyway. I implemented a Cython version of the _cmp_key attribute. It is similar to lazy attribute, but avoids some overhead, because it is known that it is applied to instances that allow for attribute assignment.

Certainly there can not be a big speed-up. We are talking here about the attempt to make 90 function calls 1 ms faster in each run. I'd really be interested to know what the startup_time plugin finds. So, let us hope that the patch bots resume work soon...

Of course, it could be that we will eventually disregard my startup time patches, should it turn out that they don't help.

I did some timings. My benchmark is: Delete and recreated `Rings()._cmp_key` in a tight loop.

With only the first two patches, I get:

```
sage: C = Rings()
sage: C._cmp_key
(6016, 12)
sage: timeit("if C._cmp_key: del C._cmp_key", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 12.9 ¬µs per loop
sage: C._cmp_key
(6016, 300059)
```

With all four patches, I get:

```
sage: C = Rings()
sage: C._cmp_key
(6016, 12)
sage: timeit("if C._cmp_key: del C._cmp_key", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 901 ns per loop
sage: C._cmp_key
(6016, 300059)
```

Since the time needed to delete the attribute should be the same, it follows that the last two patches save 12 ¬µs for each creation of the _cmp_key attribute. Better than nothing, but by far not enough to sum up to 70 ms.

I have cythoned the _cmp_key attribute of `CategoryWithParameters` as well. The raw improvement is:

Without the first two patches:

```
sage: C = Algebras(FractionField(QQ['x']))
sage: timeit("if C._cmp_key: del C._cmp_key", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 5.38 ¬µs per loop
```

With all patches:

```
sage: C = Algebras(FractionField(QQ['x']))
sage: timeit("if C._cmp_key: del C._cmp_key", number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.28 ¬µs per loop
```

But I think the startup time is what we are really interested in. My starting point is sage-5.11.b3 with these patches applied:

```
trac_14471_dynamic_class_hash.patch
trac_14471-review.patch
trac_14516-crystals_speedup-ts.2.patch
trac_14722-lazy_import_at_startup-nt.patch
```

I am giving the total time provided by sage -startuptime, in 5 consecutive runs:

```
Total time (sum over exclusive time): 1485.052ms
Total time (sum over exclusive time): 1499.287ms
Total time (sum over exclusive time): 1499.921ms
Total time (sum over exclusive time): 1492.086ms
Total time (sum over exclusive time): 1493.375ms
```

After applying the first two patches, I get:

```
Total time (sum over exclusive time): 1495.342ms
Total time (sum over exclusive time): 1504.880ms
Total time (sum over exclusive time): 1502.199ms
Total time (sum over exclusive time): 1497.281ms
Total time (sum over exclusive time): 1508.277ms
```

And after applying the other two patches, I get:

```
Total time (sum over exclusive time): 1499.909ms
Total time (sum over exclusive time): 1498.731ms
Total time (sum over exclusive time): 1499.289ms
Total time (sum over exclusive time): 1502.179ms

```

Oh wow!

Congrats Simon :-) 

I was not expecting we could really do anything about that, and had just sent an e-mail to sage-devel; counter e-mail sent!

Thanks a lot, I'll review your patches!

One typo in the review patch: "It is sematically equivalent" should be "It is semantically equivalent". Also I think you mean

```
:func:`operator.attrgetter```("cmp_key")``
```
not

```
:func:`operator.attrgetter```(category)``
```

I wonder: You changed the default sort function from `category_sort_key` to `identity` (as we agreed on by phone), but you do not explicitly use the now non-default `category_sort_key` when calling c3_sorted_merge in sage.categories.category, isn't it? That should be fixed.

Hooray, patchbot is back, and says:

```
+With 60% confidence, startup time increased by at least 0.5%
+With 96% confidence, startup time increased by at least 0.25%
+With 99.1% confidence, startup time increased by at least 0.1%
```

60% confidence is not significant, hence, we only have a significant regression of 0.25%, which I deem acceptable and a price worth paying.

So, I'm already putting it to positive review, but please add a proper commit message to the review patch!

<div id="comment:85" align="right">comment:85</div>

While looking through the Sage sources, I noticed the following doctest, coming from this ticket:

```
    sage: for l in L:
    ....:     x = HierarchyElement(10, l.to_poset())
    ....:     try:
    ....:         x.mro_standard
    ....:         assert False
    ....:     except:
    ....:         pass
    ....:     assert x.mro            == list(P)
    ....:     assert x.mro_controlled == list(P)
    ....:     assert x.all_bases_len() == 15
    ....:     stats.append(x.all_bases_controlled_len()-x.all_bases_len())
```

What is the purpose of the `assert False` here? I am asking because

```
try:
    foo()
    assert False
except:
    pass
```
is entirely equivalent to

```
try:
    foo()
except:
    pass
```
