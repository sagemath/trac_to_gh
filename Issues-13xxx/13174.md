Calling help on a cached method returns the help for cached_method, not for the actual method being cached :

```
sage:chi=DirichletGroup(6).0
sage:help(chi.conductor)
Help on CachedMethodCallerNoArgs in module sage.modular.dirichlet:

conductor(...)
    File: sage/misc/cachefunc.pyx (starting at line 1259)
    
    Utility class that is used by :class:`CachedMethod` to bind a
    cached method to an instance, in the case of a method that does
    not accept any arguments except ``self``.
    
    NOTE:
    
    The return value ``None`` would not be cached. So, if you have
    a method that does not accept arguments and may return ``None``
    after a lengthy computation, then ``@cached_method`` should not
    be used.
    
    EXAMPLE::
    
        sage: P.<a,b,c,d> = QQ[]
        sage: I = P*[a,b]
        sage: I.gens
        Cached version of <function gens at 0x...>
        sage: type(I.gens)
        <type 'sage.misc.cachefunc.CachedMethodCallerNoArgs'>
        sage: I.gens is I.gens
        True
        sage: I.gens() is I.gens()
        True

```

This is with 5.1.beta6 on an x86_64 box ; and I think it's a pretty big bug since introspection is an important feature of sage.

All Sage functions may have a `sage_getdoc` method, but not all magic objects can be recognized in one comparison (no superclass of magic objects: `CachedFunction` directly inherits from object).

This indeed gives you the help for *all* functions, regardless if magic or not, and even python builtins. However, text formatting is lost somewhere, so there is a bit more to it. What do you think, magic superclass or rewrite of `sagedoc.py:help()`?
