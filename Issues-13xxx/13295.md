```
There is a new version of the optional p_group_cohomology package.

**__Installation__**

First, install Gap's Small Groups library (contained in the database_gap spkg). Then, do

```
sage -i http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/p_group_cohomology-2.1.3.spkg
```

**__Testing__**

If the environment variable `SAGE_CHECK` is set to `yes`, then a test suite is run. This will take a considerable amount of time (the test coverage is 100%). Parallel testing is possible by setting the environment variable `SAGE_NUM_THREADS` to the number of threads being used, or by defining the environment variable `MAKE` to use multiple threads.

**__Documentation__**

Set the environment variable SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS to yes. Then, while installing the package, the documentation will be put into `SAGE_ROOT/local/share/doc/p_group_cohomology/html/`. Or see [here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/)

**__Reasons for upgrading__**

__Name mangling__

There has been yet another Cython upgrade between sage-5.0 and sage-5.2. By consequence, Python's infamous name mangling now also applies to Python classes defined in Cython code:

```
sage: cython("""
....: class Foo:
....:     def __init__(self):
....:         self.__cache = "hi"
....: """)
sage: F = Foo()
sage: F.__cache
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/simon/SAGE/prerelease/sage-5.2.rc0/<ipython console> in <module>()

AttributeError: Foo instance has no attribute '__cache'
sage: F._Foo__cache
'hi'
```
In Sage-5.0, the attribute `F.__cache` would be available. Hence, I had to rename some attributes.

__An improved heuristics for choosing between Hilbert-Poincar√© and Symonds criteria__

The new version uses an improved heuristics for deciding what methods should be used to construct parameters (without extending the base field) or proving the existence of parameters over some extension of the base field.

As an example, the new version of the spkg can detect completeness of the mod 2 cohomology ring of `SmallGroup(384,5602)` in degree 7 using the Hilbert-Poincare criterion, whereas the old version detected completeness in degree 10 using Symonds criterion.

__Storing Gap data__

Some computed data (e.g., ideals in the cohomology ring simultaneously restricting to zero on a given set of subgroups) are defined in terms of data in Gap (namely, subgroups). We would like to store such data, since obviously we don't want to recompute everything from scratch.

Unfortunately, pickling of general Gap objects is not available. The new spkg version works around, so that pickling works, provided that the Gap object can be reconstructed from its string representation (which holds, e.g., for permutation groups).

__Use lower bounds for the depth__

Some completeness criteria benefit from knowing a good estimate for the depth. In some cases, a good estimate is difficult to obtain. In the new spkg version, the computation of a good bound can be interrupted by Ctrl-C, and then an easier (but potentially weaker) bound is used.

__New web repository__

Due to a hardware problem on sage.math, the data in the old web repository are lost. Meanwhile I reconstructed the data and put them to a new location (namely my home directory on sage.math) which has a back-up. The new spkg version knows about the new location of the repository.

__Creating a private data base__

When creating a "private" data base of cohomology rings, symbolic links to the "public" data base (shipped with the package) are created. The old spkg version did sometimes fail to create the symbolic links.

__A fix for `MeatAxe` matrices__

In the old spkg version, comparing an MTX matrix with None would have resulted in a crash.

**__Information for the reviewer__**

I successfully installed and tested the package with sage-5.2.rc0 on an `OpenSuse` laptop and on bsd.math. It would be nice to test it on a variety of platforms, in particular on machines of different endianness, or on 32-bit machines.

Apart from that, there is not much new mathematics in the spkg: It is mainly a bug fix release (coping with the Cython upgrade).

A few minutes ago, I posted a [modified spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/p_group_cohomology-2.1.3.spkg) (still version 2.1.3). I am sorry if you already downloaded the previously posted spkg.

Please make sure you got the right spkg: There should now be a mew method `pGroupCohomology.modular_cohomology.MODCOHO.parameter_degrees_over_field_extension`.

The reason for the change is that in the last few days I improved the heuristics to choose between different methods to construct or to prove the existence of parameters. For example, consider the mod 2 cohomology of `SmallGroup(384, 5602)` (which occurs when computing the mod 2 cohomology of the symmetric group of degree 8). The cohomology ring can be presented in degree 6, but the previously posted spkg could detect completeness only in degree 10, using Symonds' criterion. But the current spkg can prove completeness in degree 7, using the Hilbert-Poincar√© criterion.

This is a new doctest.

Speaking about doctests: I still need to run the test suite on bsd.math, and post the current documentation on the project page.

Hi Simon,

I'm going to try building this on several platforms. Meanwhile, here are one or two things which need easy fixes:

- the repository isn't clean: there is a file "spkg-check.orig" present.
- In spkg-check, I would suggest changing `SAGE_NUMBER_THREADS` to `SAGE_NUM_THREADS`, since the latter variable is set automatically in `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin/sage-env`.

Thank you for spotting that!

Cool, I didn't know about that one. Hence, if you define `MAKE="make -j4` then the variable will automatically be fine?

Otherwise, this looks good to me. It builds and passes tests on several different platforms (linux, OS X 10.7, OpenSolaris). So if you fix the two small issues, positive review.

Sorry that it took so long to fix the remaining issues. I have updated the spkg.

hg status is now fine, and am now using `SAGE_NUM_THREADS` instead of `SAGE_NUMBER_THREADS`.

Caveat: I need to test it (e.g., on bsd.math) with the latest sage prerelease - just in case. As much as I know, upgrading GAP #13211 will break a couple of things. So, the current spkg version may soon be obsolete... :(

The spkg is now updated again. The package and its documentation build fine on bsd.math.

I am now running the tests on bsd.math, and i already found some that fail (although most seem to pass). No idea if that is due to a recent Singular upgrade...

Anyway, it again needs work, because of the test failures.

> But what does that mean to us? Of course, I could work around by temporarily switch off `redSB`.

It would be as follow:

```
sage: from pGroupCohomology import CohomologyRing
sage: H = CohomologyRing(64,245)
sage: I = H.essential_ideal()
sage: singular.option()
//options: redSB redTail redThrough redefine loadLib usage prompt
sage: singular.option("noredSB")
sage: singular.option()
//options: redTail redThrough redefine loadLib usage prompt
sage: (I*I).NF('std(0)').interred()            
a_4_8*a_6_8*a_1_0^3*a_1_3
sage: singular.option("redSB")
sage: (I*I).NF('std(0)').interred()
a_4_8*a_6_8*a_1_0^3*a_1_3,
a_4_8*a_6_8*c_8_16*a_1_0^3*a_1_3
```

Does the reviewer think that it is a valid work-around?

Should we test this spkg with the new GAP spkg from #13211?

I have just updated my spkg, temporarily switching `redSB` off. I think that would be better than skipping the test.

> Should we test this spkg with the new GAP spkg from #13211?

IIRC, I have already tried, and there were various errors (including GAP crashes, so, it isn't just random noise). I guess this will be version 2.1.4 of the spkg...

I am now testing the updated spkg, but I think it should again be ready for review...
