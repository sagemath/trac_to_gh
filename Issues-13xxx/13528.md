1. I've been experiencing some problems with logarithmic scale plots since the 'semilogy', 'semilogx' and 'loglog' options had been added. For example, when I use the 'semilogy' plot, I can adjust the 'ymax' value, but not 'ymin' value. 'ymin' is always set automatically, and not always correctly.
2.  I have also noticed that if I have several curves on a single 'semilogy' plot, the lower Y limit is set according the minimum value of the FIRST curve. **Can not reproduce this case -basu.**

Example showing weird behavior on decreasing `ymin` to `1e3`, `1e4`, etc., but exhibiting correct behavior on changing `ymax`.

```
dPhi = 6.02e10 * x**(2.481) * exp(-x / 1.205)
plot(dPhi, 0, 20, scale='semilogy', figsize=(5,4), ymin=1e7, ymax=1e11, xmin=0, xmax=20, frame=True)
```
