Currently, the following code fails:

```
sage: R.<x> = Zp(3,2)[]
sage: S.<xbar> = R.quo(x^2+1)
sage: xbar.matrix()
TypeError: cannot construct an element of Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over 3-adic Ring with capped relative precision 2 from [0, 1 + O(3^2), 2 + 2*3 + O(3^2), 0, O(3^2)]!
```

The problem is that the p-adic quotient with remainder does not determine the degree of the result and therefore `p%f` might have (inexact zero) coefficients beyond its degree:

```
sage: R.<x> = Qp(3,5)[]
sage: S.<xbar> = R.quo(x^2 + (O(3^2)*x) + (3+O(3^2)))
sage: xbar^3
(O(3^5))*xbar^3 + (O(3^2))*xbar^2 + (2*3 + O(3^2))*xbar
```

Just throwing away such coefficients would be wrong however. In the above example this would give `(2*3 + O(3^2))*xbar` with an *exact* constant coefficient `0` which is incorrect. The correct thing to do is to reduce any leading inexact zero coefficients with the defining equation of the quotient. This is done in this ticket and gives the correct result:

```
sage: R.<x> = Qp(3,5)[]
sage: S.<xbar> = R.quo(x^2 + (O(3^2)*x) + (3+O(3^2)))
sage: xbar^3
(2*3 + O(3^2))*xbar + (O(3^3))
```

Depends on #14482

I think this patch is dangerous. Just truncating the list of coefficients without checking will make this code very prone to producing erroneous results silently.

In this case there is another solution anyway: The present code computes the coefficients of `[self,x*self,x<sup>2*self,...,x</sup>(d-1)*self]` and puts that into a matrix. If your arithmetic is to be trusted, that's probably the more efficient way of doing it.

There may be other, better solutions too and perhaps the current approach (if equipped with reasonable checks) turns out to be good/better/more efficient and acceptable, but in its current form it seems to me it is masking the underlying problem rather than resolving it.

I decided to just reduce leading zero coefficients mod `f` explicitly when creating the quotient ring elements. This appears to be the right thing to do to me. A different algorithm to compute the matrix would be an alternative of course. I just did what appeared to be easier to implement.

Michel, I imagine you know how to do the L-series computations, so you can probably even verify that the added precision did not produce incorrect coefficients.

Quick question about formatting, why when you are looking at examples like:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a1')
sage: E.is_ordinary(3)
False
sage: E.is_ordinary(5)
True
sage: L = E.padic_lseries(3)
sage: alpha = L.alpha(10)
sage: alpha^2 - E.ap(3)*alpha + 3
(O(3^11))*alpha + (O(3^11))
sage: L = E.padic_lseries(5)
sage: alpha = L.alpha(10)
sage: alpha^2 - E.ap(5)*alpha + 5
O(5^10)
```
What's going on in the ordinary versus supersingular case?
