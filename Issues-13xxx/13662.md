```
Currently, the following code fails:

```
sage: R.<x> = Zp(3,2)[]
sage: S.<xbar> = R.quo(x^2+1)
sage: xbar.matrix()
TypeError: cannot construct an element of Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over 3-adic Ring with capped relative precision 2 from [0, 1 + O(3^2), 2 + 2*3 + O(3^2), 0, O(3^2)]!
```

The problem is that the p-adic quotient with remainder does not determine the degree of the result and therefore `p%f` might have (inexact zero) coefficients beyond its degree:

```
sage: R.<x> = Qp(3,5)[]
sage: S.<xbar> = R.quo(x^2 + (O(3^2)*x) + (3+O(3^2)))
sage: xbar^3
(O(3^5))*xbar^3 + (O(3^2))*xbar^2 + (2*3 + O(3^2))*xbar
```

Just throwing away such coefficients would be wrong however. In the above example this would give `(2*3 + O(3^2))*xbar` with an *exact* constant coefficient `0` which is incorrect. The correct thing to do is to reduce any leading inexact zero coefficients with the defining equation of the quotient. This is done in this ticket and gives the correct result:

```
sage: R.<x> = Qp(3,5)[]
sage: S.<xbar> = R.quo(x^2 + (O(3^2)*x) + (3+O(3^2)))
sage: xbar^3
(2*3 + O(3^2))*xbar + (O(3^3))
```

I decided to just reduce leading zero coefficients mod `f` explicitly when creating the quotient ring elements. This appears to be the right thing to do to me. A different algorithm to compute the matrix would be an alternative of course. I just did what appeared to be easier to implement.

This failing doctest is a problem:

```
             sage: L.series(4)         # takes a long time (several seconds)
-            (O(3))*alpha + (O(3^2)) + ((O(3^-1))*alpha + (2*3^-1 + O(3^0)))*T + ((O(3^-1))*alpha + (2*3^-1 + O(3^0)))*T^2 + O(T^5)
+            (O(3^2))*alpha + (O(3^3)) + ((O(3^-1))*alpha + (2*3^-1 + O(3^0)))*T + ((O(3^-1))*alpha + (2*3^-1 + O(3^0)))*T^2 + O(T^5)
```
The precision should only go down by this change.
