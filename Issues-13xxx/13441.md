Currently, some classes define a `_gcd` method which is called by a `gcd` method of euclidean domain elements. Most elements already define `gcd` directly, and I see no real use in having this method in between.

The attached patch renames all `_gcd` methods to `gcd` and also streamlines the use of ``@`coerce_binop` on them.

This is similar to #13628.

sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 430 ns per loop
sage: x,y=234/234525,4324525/12351

625 loops, best of 3: 11.5 µs per loop

sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 6.06 µs per loop
```

With the patch:

```
sage: x,y=34912364,123324234
sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.13 µs per loop
sage: x,y=234/234525,4324525/12351
sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 14.1 µs per loop
sage: R.<T>=ZZ[]

So there is actually a speed penalty. This seems to be caused by a bug in `coerce_binop`:

```
sage: x.gcd

sage: x.gcd
<sage.structure.element.NamedBinopMethod object at 0x1bc27290>

This is just how decorators work on methods (if they don't do tricks like cached_method) - the `__get__` has to create a new instance on every call.

<a id='comment:20'></a>A question: is there a good technical reason to make `gcd()` a method of `EuclideanDomains.ElementMethods` instead of `EuclideanDomainElement`?  To me it seems conceptually preferable to keep it a method of `EuclideanDomainElement`.

To be honest, I don't really see the (mathematical) point of having a category of Euclidean domains, at least not in its current form.  There would presumably need to be some condition requiring the "quotient and remainder" function to be compatible with morphisms in this category, and even then I wonder how useful it would be.  Again, maybe there is a good technical reason to have such a category?
