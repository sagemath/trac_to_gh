Currently, some classes define a `_gcd` method which is called by a `gcd` method of euclidean domain elements. Most elements already define `gcd` directly, and I see no real use in having this method in between.

The attached patch renames all `_gcd` methods to `gcd` and also streamlines the use of ``@`coerce_binop` on them.

This is similar to #13628.

My main concern is with a speed penalty in doing gcds for rationals, polynomial_integer_dense_ntl, etc.  Have you compared the runtime of the gcds before and after your changes?

I agree that it's conceptually nicer.

Without the patch I get:

```
sage: x,y=34912364,123324234
sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 430 ns per loop
sage: x,y=234/234525,4324525/12351
sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 11.5 µs per loop
sage: R.<T>=ZZ[]
sage: x,y=123*T^2+23424*T+1231,1231451*T^3+65*T^2+352*T+234251
sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 6.06 µs per loop
```

With the patch:

```
sage: x,y=34912364,123324234
sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.13 µs per loop
sage: x,y=234/234525,4324525/12351
sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 14.1 µs per loop
sage: R.<T>=ZZ[]
sage: x,y=123*T^2+23424*T+1231,1231451*T^3+65*T^2+352*T+234251
sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 6.21 µs per loop
```

So there is actually a speed penalty. This seems to be caused by a bug in `coerce_binop`:

```
sage: x.gcd
<sage.structure.element.NamedBinopMethod object at 0x1bc255f0>
sage: x.gcd
<sage.structure.element.NamedBinopMethod object at 0x1bc27290>
```

I'm looking into this.

This is just how decorators work on methods (if they don't do tricks like cached_method) - the `__get__` has to create a new instance on every call.

The speed problems seem to be resolved with the new patch:

With the patch:
