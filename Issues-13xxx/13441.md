Currently, some classes define a `_gcd` method which is called by a `gcd` method of euclidean domain elements. Most elements already define `gcd` directly, and I see no real use in having this method in between.

The attached patch renames all `_gcd` methods to `gcd` and also streamlines the use of `@coerce_binop` on them.

This is similar to #13628.

My main concern is with a speed penalty in doing gcds for rationals, polynomial_integer_dense_ntl, etc.  Have you compared the runtime of the gcds before and after your changes?

I agree that it's conceptually nicer.

Without the patch I get:

```
sage: x,y=34912364,123324234
sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 430 ns per loop
sage: x,y=234/234525,4324525/12351
sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 11.5 µs per loop
sage: R.<T>=ZZ[]
sage: x,y=123*T^2+23424*T+1231,1231451*T^3+65*T^2+352*T+234251
sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 6.06 µs per loop
```

With the patch:

```
sage: x,y=34912364,123324234
sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.13 µs per loop
sage: x,y=234/234525,4324525/12351
sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 14.1 µs per loop
sage: R.<T>=ZZ[]
sage: x,y=123*T^2+23424*T+1231,1231451*T^3+65*T^2+352*T+234251
sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 6.21 µs per loop
```

So there is actually a speed penalty. This seems to be caused by a bug in `coerce_binop`:

```
sage: x.gcd
<sage.structure.element.NamedBinopMethod object at 0x1bc255f0>
sage: x.gcd
<sage.structure.element.NamedBinopMethod object at 0x1bc27290>
```

I'm looking into this.

This is just how decorators work on methods (if they don't do tricks like cached_method) - the `__get__` has to create a new instance on every call.

The speed problems seem to be resolved with the new patch:

Without the patch:

```
sage: x,y=34912364,123324234
sage: sage: sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 427 ns per loop
sage: sage: R.<t>=PolynomialRing(GF(3),implementation="NTL")
sage: sage: x,y=t^2-1,t-1
sage: sage: sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 35.5 µs per loop
age: sage: x,y=234/234525,4324525/12351
sage: sage: sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 11.4 µs per loop
age: sage: R.<t> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,implementation="NTL")
sage: sage: x,y=t^2-1,t-1
sage: sage: sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 17.8 µs per loop
```

With the patch:

```
sage: x,y=34912364,123324234
sage: sage: sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 421 ns per loop
sage: R.<t>=PolynomialRing(GF(3),implementation="NTL")
sage: x,y=t^2-1,t-1
sage: sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 32.7 µs per loop
sage: x,y=234/234525,4324525/12351
sage: sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 11.5 µs per loop
sage: R.<t> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,implementation="NTL")
sage: x,y=t^2-1,t-1
sage: sage: timeit('x.gcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 17.3 µs per loop
```

Let's see what the patchbot thinks about it…

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A25):

thanks!  

> if you're happy with my changes, then go ahead and set this to positive review.

I haven't reviewed this patch, just converted it to a git branch so I can work with it.  I can see that it seems to work, and that the documentation builds correctly and looks good.  But I haven't looked more closely at it; in particular I haven't verified the timing results.  I do give a positive review to your changes -- are you giving positive review to the earlier parts of the patch/branch?

I double-checked and I am getting the same times (up to noise), so then it's positive review all around.
