> Spkg?
Soon?

Seriously, I completely got out of the Cygwin stuff since christmas and just started dropping an eye recently on ATLAS and GCC/ECL.

I indeed have a (surely dirty) spkg on my home computer, but as it is surely dirty, I'll wait this week end to have a last look at it and won't scp it everywhere just now.

Fair enough, I wouldn't have asked (since I have patch installed on my Cygwin) except I saw your reappearance.

I don't think it's necessary yet in any case, since we can first require it, then drop that requirement.
