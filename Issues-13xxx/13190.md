Currently the sage library uses distutils. Switching to setuptools will give us the `setup.py develop` command, which bypasses the need to rebuild the sage library when modifying python files.

This is more or less #12659 after switching to setuptools, and is where the other dependencies creep up (they aren't strictly necessary, but the alternative is to hack around setuptools, which is less preferable than patching it IMO).

I'll rework the patch to only do A once we have a 5.4 beta (mainly because #13031 more or less needs to be rebased with every development release).

Any thoughts on this?  It hasn't been touched in quite some time despite there being (a likely outdated by now) patch. I can take this issue over and see it to completion if desired.

I don't know what files need to be installed with the `sage` package.  For the majority of Python-based projects `package_data` is preferred, but of course Sage is 'special'.

Let me look into what files are installed with the sage package, and I can worry about the details.
