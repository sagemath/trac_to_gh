Currently the sage library uses distutils. Switching to setuptools will give us the `setup.py develop` command, which bypasses the need to rebuild the sage library when modifying python files.

Do you mean the sdist issues? No, I have not tried them yet, but I wouldn't doubt that there may be issues with them. Also, as noted in deps, there is an issue with parallel instances of setuptools, so either deps has to be hacked to force sage into the serial build, or we depend on #12994 (my vote is the later, since it is cleaner).

This is more or less #12659 after switching to setuptools, and is where the other dependencies creep up (they aren't strictly necessary, but the alternative is to hack around setuptools, which is less preferable than patching it IMO).

I'll rework the patch to only do A once we have a 5.4 beta (mainly because #13031 more or less needs to be rebased with every development release).
