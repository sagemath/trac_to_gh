Currently the sage library uses distutils. Switching to setuptools will give us the `setup.py develop` command, which bypasses the need to rebuild the sage library when modifying python files.

This should only require #13031.
> B. Use setup.py develop

This is more or less #12659 after switching to setuptools, and is where the other dependencies creep up (they aren't strictly necessary, but the alternative is to hack around setuptools, which is less preferable than patching it IMO).

I'll rework the patch to only do A once we have a 5.4 beta (mainly because #13031 more or less needs to be rebased with every development release).
