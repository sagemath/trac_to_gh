See [this ask.sagemath.org post](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1559/a-bug-in-graphicspy).  The proposed fix there is to replace [this line](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/9ab4ab6e12d0/sage/plot/graphics.py#l634) by

```diff
-self.__axes_labels = (str(l[0]), str(l[1]))
+self.__axes_labels = (l[0], l[1])
```
Considering that `l` is already supposed to be a tuple or list of two strings, this seems pretty plausible.

There is an update at the ask.sagemath.org post.  Apparently it's actually a fair amount of work to get matplotlib to do certain unicode fonts properly... that doesn't mean this isn't a bug.

I'm wondering what the Sage-mobile people at Sunkyunkwan U. in Korea do for this, if they do anything?  Dan, do you know?

I came up with this bug yesterday using sage-5.0. Here are the notes I took :

The following works:

```
sage: c = circle((0,0), 1)
sage: c.axes_labels(['X', 'Y'])
sage: c
```

Accent in normal string gets a ValueError:

```
sage: c.axes_labels(['an accent : é', 'Y'])
sage: c
Traceback (most recent call last): 
... 
ValueError: matplotlib display text must have all code points < 128 or use Unicode strings
```
 
Accent in unicode string gets translated to str which yields a UnicodeError :

```
sage: c.axes_labels([u'an accent : é', 'Y'])                               
Traceback (most recent call last):
...             
--> 634         self.__axes_labels = (str(l[0]), str(l[1]))
...
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 12-13: ordinal not in range(128)
```

Not declaring the unicode for command `text` also gives a ValueError:

```
sage: text('an accent : é', (0,0))
Traceback (most recent call last): 
... 
ValueError: matplotlib display text must have all code points < 128 or use Unicode strings
```

But declaring unicode works for command `text`. Although, no error are raised, the result is not good : the "é" gets printed as the two characters "~A commercial c" :

```
sage: text(u'an accent : é', (0,0))
```

Strangely it gets printed correctly if the command is written in a file (without declaring encoding) and then attached :

```
# file.sage
t = text(u'an accent : é', (0,0))
```

and then

```
sage: attach file.sage
sage: t
```

is perfect! This shows that somehow matplotlib is able to work with unicode strings. We just have to make it work properly.

Patch up. I removed the `str()` calls, and also just wrote `tuple(l)`, since the code guarantees that we have a tuple or list of length 2.

I see the problem reported by Sébastian, though; using Unicode strings, the generated plots have the wrong characters. But I think that is a font problem and could be fixed on another ticket; for now, let's get our own code working.

I never builded the documentation as pdf before. I just did it and get the same error.

Could this be related to the first line added by the patch:

```
# -*- encoding: utf-8 -*- 
```

which should be 

```
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*- 
```

? 

Another possibility would be to write the test as

```
sage: c.axes_labels(['z',u'\xeb\x8b\xb4']) 
sage: c._axes_labels 
('z', u'\xeb\x8b\xb4') 
```

instead of

```
sage: c.axes_labels(['z',u'ë�Ž']) 
sage: c._axes_labels 
('z', u'\xeb\x8b\xb4') 
```

I am testing those two options right now.

My guess is that the Asian (?) character used in the doctest is not recognized by utf-8 encoding, or at least by PDFLaTeX's unicode implementation. So we should try a different character instead, for example with this change:

Hi, it seems that there will be some diffcult if I use my name in Chinese,sorry for that,and I will change it into Roman characters.Thanks very much.

Also,I want to report another bug of sage to deal with CJK(Chinese,Japanese,Korean),I open a ticket for it ,this is the [ticket](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/13332) .As I am not familiar with the process,maybe I have made some mistake here.

I just added a patch which applies on top of the previous one and which adds real life example of french word which can occur in axis label and which contain an accent :

- Axes des abscisses (axe des X)
- Axes des ordonnées (axe des Y)

Needs review!
