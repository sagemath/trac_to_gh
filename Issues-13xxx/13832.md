If I really have to rant, I'd ask for the trac ticket number to be included in SPKG.txt (between * and U).

It's just that such information can sometimes save so much time, not that I think it will really be the case here, but...
I've just wasted so much time understanding and reinventing the wheel at #13864...

Trac ticket numbers belong into `SPKG.txt` (i.e., an spkg's changelog) as well as into the commit messages (at least the last one, in case there are a couple of for a single patch level), while for spkgs the first is IMHO more important (even if Trac's search functions were smart...).

You may save a few seconds omitting it, at the expense of N other developers later wasting much more time searching.

Also, the `SPKG.txt` is for human consumption, so appropriate references should be added but that can be a trac ticket, a mailinglist post, or something else. In this case there is just nothing to point to.

Even the trac search engine is good enough to give you this ticket if you search for "cython-0.17.3.spkg". 

More importantly, we should strive to make Sage development more agile and avoid making it look like filling out a German tax declaration. **Now go to trac and obtain your unique identifying number.

I, personally, wouldn't even think to look at the SPKG.txt for this information, which would necessarily send me to the trac site anyways.
