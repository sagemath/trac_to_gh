Trac ticket numbers belong into `SPKG.txt` (i.e., an spkg's changelog) as well as into the commit messages (at least the last one, in case there are a couple of for a single patch level), while for spkgs the first is IMHO more important (even if Trac's search functions were smart...).

You may save a few seconds omitting it, at the expense of N other developers later wasting much more time searching.
