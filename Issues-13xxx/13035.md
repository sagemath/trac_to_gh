This patch primarily moves the code for the Cholesky decomposition up to the "matrix double dense" module, where it belongs, and is consistent with the approach for other decompositions.  The SciPy code is general enough to handle RDF/CDF symmetric/Hermitian cases simultaneously so the move is easy.

Side-effects:
* Significant documentation upgrade.
* No doctest in matrix2 needs adjustment due to the code change here.
* First step in un-deprecating the `cholesky()` method.

The `cholesky_decomposition()`, `_cholesky_decomposition()` situation is a **total mess** and needs fixing.  The shorter name is more consistent with others, such as `schur()` and `SVD()`.  Once the exact version of `cholesky()` is concluded at #11274, then I plan to get the mess all straightened out.  This patch is independent of the ones for the exact matrices, so has no dependencies.
