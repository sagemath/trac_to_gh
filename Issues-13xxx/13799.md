As in the summary.   Lots of `undefined reference to` messages about things like `__imp____gmpq_clear` and the like.

Use spkg at
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/cvxopt-1.1.5.p0.spkg

It adds back the glpk needed dependencies removed at #13160.

I guess overlinking was so muchfixed in #13160 it became underlinking.

Maybe.  We do 

```
 # Set to 1 if you are installing the glpk module.
-BUILD_GLPK = 0 
+BUILD_GLPK = 1 
```
in setup.py.patch, and got rid of 

```
- if BUILD_GLPK:
--    glpk = Extension('glpk', libraries = ['glpk'],
-+    glpk = Extension('glpk', libraries = libraries+['glpk', 'gmp', 'z'],
-         include_dirs = [ GLPK_INC_DIR ],
--        library_dirs = [ GLPK_LIB_DIR ],
-+        library_dirs = libdirs + [ GLPK_LIB_DIR ],
-         sources = ['C/glpk.c'] )
-     extmods += [glpk];
- 
```
but Cygwin is notoriously finicky about extensions, so maybe we need to add this back in.  Have you seen any problems at all on Windows 7?  Maybe 

```

 # Directory containing libglpk (used only when BUILD_GLPK = 1).
-GLPK_LIB_DIR = '/usr/lib'
+GLPK_LIB_DIR = SAGE_LIB
 
 # Directory containing glpk.h (used only when BUILD_GLPK = 1).
-GLPK_INC_DIR = '/usr/include'
+GLPK_INC_DIR = SAGE_INCLUDE
```
is sufficient there, if those are even relevant here (are they where it is put, or where it looks for things it depends on?).

The fix is just to add back gmp and z as dependencies for glpk, or I guess so, more or less as your first solution proposes.
Your second solution won't work (or could but that's not a good idea, it will use the system gmp I guess).
I've got a quite working spkg, but will only post it tomorrow, too late for today.

Just FYI, there are two hunks that succeed but are offset by one line each.  Otherwise this seems fine.  Builds ok on Mac and sage.math and XP Cygwin, passes tests on the `numerical_sage` doc module on Mac and sage.math.

By the way, at some point I also had a p1 spkg that (according to sage-devel list I said that) Volker had made, but I can't find what ticket, if any, that was related to.
