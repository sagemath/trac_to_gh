As in the summary.   Lots of `undefined reference to` messages about things like `__imp____gmpq_clear` and the like.

Use spkg at
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/cvxopt-1.1.5.p0.spkg

It adds back the glpk needed dependencies removed at #13160.

Maybe.  We do 

```
 # Set to 1 if you are installing the glpk module.
-BUILD_GLPK = 0 
+BUILD_GLPK = 1 
```
in setup.py.patch, and got rid of 

```
- if BUILD_GLPK:
--    glpk = Extension('glpk', libraries = ['glpk'],
-+    glpk = Extension('glpk', libraries = libraries+['glpk', 'gmp', 'z'],
-         include_dirs = [ GLPK_INC_DIR ],
--        library_dirs = [ GLPK_LIB_DIR ],
-+        library_dirs = libdirs + [ GLPK_LIB_DIR ],
-         sources = ['C/glpk.c'] )
-     extmods += [glpk];
- 
```
but Cygwin is notoriously finicky about extensions, so maybe we need to add this back in.  Have you seen any problems at all on Windows 7?  Maybe 

```

 # Directory containing libglpk (used only when BUILD_GLPK = 1).
-GLPK_LIB_DIR = '/usr/lib'
+GLPK_LIB_DIR = SAGE_LIB
 
 # Directory containing glpk.h (used only when BUILD_GLPK = 1).
-GLPK_INC_DIR = '/usr/include'
+GLPK_INC_DIR = SAGE_INCLUDE
```
is sufficient there, if those are even relevant here (are they where it is put, or where it looks for things it depends on?).

The fix is just to add back gmp and z as dependencies for glpk, or I guess so, more or less as your first solution proposes.
Your second solution won't work (or could but that's not a good idea, it will use the system gmp I guess).
I've got a quite working spkg, but will only post it tomorrow, too late for today.
