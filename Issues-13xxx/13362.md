The function `build_flow_graph` (called by the `flow` function) contains a

```
g.set_edge_label(l)
```
instead of

```
g.set_edge_label(sp[i],sp[i+1],l) 
```
where ``l`` is a number.

It wasn't in the doctests. In fact the existence of 0-cost cycles in flows depends on the LP solver and the instance. Some LP solver simplifies the solution returning the minimum possible number of non zero variables.

I added some very artificial doctests, but it does the job.
