How to reproduce on Sage 5.3 main on Unbuntu 11.10. Run:

```
   sage -notebook
```

Go to any help page, and type in

```
   o = 3
   o.<tab>
```

Nothing happens and the following traceback appears in the terminal
where sage-notebook was launched:

```

exceptions.NotImplementedError: User _sage_ can not access URL introspect
```

There is no such failure in 5.1.

The attached patch fixes the white list to enable some missing notebook
actions and features in the live documentation:

- Introspection
- Delete all output
- Copy worksheet
- New cell after
- Restart Sage

There certainly are more of them that should be added. I let a notebook expert complete the list.

Hi Karl!

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment:8):

Nicolas, we wouldn't close a ticket for an upstream bug until we actually merged that functionality into Sage - it isn't sufficient to just report the bug!  Who knows if it would ever be fixed?  Luckily, we have a "good relationship" with sagenb :) but with other spkgs, especially ones that are essentially not being developed any more, that may not be the case (see for instance #13947).

Well, I guess my idea was that this ticket should never have been
created here in the first place, since notebook development occurs
elsewhere. We don't want to create tickets here for every bug / pull
request on the sagenb web-site, right?

Anyway, I don't mind either way.

Cheers,
                      Nicolas
