Currently, some classes define a _xgcd method which is called by a xgcd method of euclidean domain elements. Most elements already define xgcd directly, and I see no real use in having this method in between.

The attached patch renames all _xgcd methods to xgcd and also streamlines the use of `@`coerce_binop on them.

This is similar to #13441.

The patch introduces a speed penalty for integers. Therefore I left the method `_xgcd` in for integers for places where this really matters. The following timings are `without/with` the patch applied.

```
sage: x,y=3,21
sage: timeit('x.xgcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 986 ns/1.56 µs per loop
sage: timeit('x._xgcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 713 ns/704 ns per loop
sage: x,y=1/3,1/21
sage: timeit('x.xgcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: --- --/7.92 µs per loop
sage: R.<t> = QQbar[]
sage: x,y=t-1,t^2-1
sage: timeit('x.xgcd(y)')
125 loops, best of 3: 1.17 ms/1.18 ms per loop
sage: R.<t> = PolynomialRing(GF(3),implementation="NTL")
sage: x,y=t-1,t^2-1
sage: timeit('x.xgcd(y)')
625 loops, best of 3: 80 µs/80.9 µs per loop
```

Notice that there was no `xgcd` method for rational numbers before since it was defined only for `PrincipalIdealDomainElement` which `FieldElement` does not inherit from.

Also the docstring for Integers talked about some `weirdness` that was actually not present anymore. I checked all combinations of integers between -20 and 20 but could not find a single case where the output of xgcd without the `minimal` option produced something really surprising.

If the patchbot does not find any problems, then this is ready for review.

Got some failing doctests here; if you fix them I can give positive review to your changes.  (You could also change tuples in the documentation to use parentheses, which I like too.)  Are you giving positive review to the other parts of the patch?
