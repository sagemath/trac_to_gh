As reported in [1], the following code produces an exception :

```
sage: B = {0:{1:2,2:5,3:4},1:{2:2,4:7},2:{3:1,4:4,5:3},3:{5:4},4:{5:1,6:5},5:{6:7}} 
sage: grafo3 = Graph(B,weighted=True) 
sage: matad = grafo3.weighted_adjacency_matrix() 
sage: grafo4 = Graph(matad,format = "adjacency_matrix", weighted=True) 
sage: grafo4.shortest_path(0,6,by_weight=True)
```

This, because Sage has some problems understanding that the graph is not a multigraph...
