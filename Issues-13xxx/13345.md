```
In the definition of a QuotientRing there is the following assumption

```
ASSUMPTION:

    ``I`` has a method ``I.reduce(x)`` returning the normal form
    of elements `x\in R`. In other words, it is required that
    ``I.reduce(x)==I.reduce(y)`` `\iff x-y \in I`, and
    ``x-I.reduce(x) in I``, for all `x,y\in R`.
```

On the other hand, the default definition of reduce in `sage/rings/ideal.py` says

```
    def reduce(self, f):
        return f       # default
```

As a consequence one gets 

```
sage: Z4x.<x> = Integers(4)[]
sage: GR.<y> = Z4x.quotient_ring(x**2+x+1)
sage: R = GR.quo(GR.ideal(2))
sage: R(y+2) == R(y)
False       
```

This patch adds a deprecation warning in `reduce()`. It also introduces a test in `QuotientRing_nc.__init__()`, which determines if the ideal class overwrites the definition of `reduce()`.

There is also a discussion about this on https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/s5y604ZPiQ8/discussion.

If yes, are the tests wrong or did they pass only by accident in the past?

I don't know the involved math, but it sounds to me like sage currently returns wrong answers. If this is the case, the bug should be fixed and not deprecated. This means: a) use `NotImplementedError` right away and b) reimplement `reduce()` where necessary.

I was talking about the failures where I did not catch the deprecation warning. I will start this work as soon as there is a decision if there should be some deprecation warning or a NotImplementedError at those places.

This is definitely a bug. I am not sure if I will be able to reimplement all occurrences of reduce.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Judging just from reading the patch, I think you make the assumption very clear :)

I don't have any experience with deprecation, but what you're doing to sage/rings/ideal.py looks fine to me.

About the `DeprecationWarning` you are adding to sage/rings/quotient_ring.py:

1) Any existing Sage doctest where your patch gives this warning is very likely a Sage bug. Thanks for finding them, you can list them in a separate ticket.

2) For your final patch, please remove this test and this warning. There is not much added benefit of this warning (you get an indirect warning from reduce when you use the quotient ring anyway), and it tests something different from what it claims to check (reduce being implemented is not equivalent to the assumption being satisfied, so lots of potential false positives and false negatives), while it also forces people to do extra work later (when the deprecated function "reduce" is changed to `NotImplementedError`). Also, you are not deprecating any functionality at this location in the source code.

Replying to [comment:5 mstreng]:

I removed the `DeprecationWarning` from sage/rings/quotient_ring.py as you proposed and started a new ticket, see ticket:13347.

I suppose that the documentation of mod() in sage/structure/element.pyx should also be modified:     
        ''Return a **unique** representative for self modulo the ideal I (or the ideal
        generated by the elements of I if I is not an ideal.) '''I.e. it is required that
        x.mod(I) == y.mod(I) `\iff x-y \in I`, and
        x-x.mod(I) in I, for all `x,y\in R`.*' *
