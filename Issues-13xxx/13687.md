Groups are based on the deprecated `ParentWithGens`. This ticket is about forward-porting them to the new coercion framework.

To limit the size of the patchbomb I'm only porting the Abelian groups. The rest depends on `old.Group`

Various oddities needed to be cleaned up in the process:
* make parents unique and elements immutable (often requires tuples instead of lists)
* rename `AbelianGroup_class.invariants()` -> `AbelianGroup_class.gens_orders()` since they are not necessarily the abelian invariants (=elementary divisors).
* rename `element.list()` -> `element.exponents()` for the exponent vector.
* implement a `AbelianGroupWithValues` where you attach values to the (abstract) generators. Used in the unit group of a number field, for example.
* lots of places return lists when they should return tuples

I haven't actually deprecated `.invariants()` and `.list()`, just changed the documentation to suggest the equivalent `.gens_orders()` and .exponents()` methods. But I think we should deprecate them. Though I first want to work my way through the remaining groups code.

Hi Volker,
I'm about halfway through this.  Overall it's looking great.  Here are some comments (let me know if anything is unclear):

* in the `_normalize` function for `AbelianGroup`, perhaps the 0s should come last, since that lines up with the standard divisibility condition for invariants.  Also, if `gens_orders` is a string of length `n` then it will get through your error checking.

* `_normalize` should have examples.

* In `random_element`, shouldn't the fact that doctesting consistently chooses a random seed mean we don't need to mark `G.random_element()` as `# random output`?

* In the docstring for `equals`, the documentation for the output is wrong: should be checking whether they are the same subset.

* In `invs()`, where you write `raise Exception # WTF`, maybe we should figure out what was intended by this function and fix it.  :-)

* In the module summary of `dual_abelian_group`, you can use floating point tolerance rather than just marking the output as random.  In particular, shouldn't your first example be exact?

* In module doctoring for `dual_abelian_group_element`, you should take out the `# random` marking on some doctests (using floating point tolerance instead if necessary)

I should go to sleep, but I'll try to get through more of this tomorrow.  When you make changes, could you upload a separate patch?

1. The 0's were prepended, I just kept that behavior. I think its more in line with the mathematical expectation of writing a group as free+torsion instead of the other way round. Also, the `gens_orders` are not the abelian invariants. 

5. I still haven't figured out what `invs()` is for, I'll just delete it ;-)

I agree with the rest. Most of it is just stuff that was already there and I didn't fix...

Here are some more suggestions.  I'm going to leave it marked as needs review so that the patchbot will continue testing.

1. In `AbelianGroupElement.__init__`, I think it's useful to allow `ints` in the `generator_orders`, rather than asserting that they all be `Integers`

2. Documentation of `exponents` doesn't line up with `__init__` method in `AbelianGroupElementBase`.  You should give an example in the documentation of that function showing that the exponents are still integers, not elements of the base ring.

3. In docstring for `AbelianGroupWithValues`, maybe you should note that `values_group` could be a ring or field, since Sage doesn't currently support the group of units in a ring very well.

4. I don't think that `AbelianGroupWithValuesEmbedding` should inherit from `CallMorphism`, but rather just from `Morphism`.

5. For the arithmetic operations in `AbelianGroupWithValuesElement`, I would keep the computation of `_value` lazy (check to see if both left and right values are not None).  By being nonlazy you'll get more floating point drift and also you may compute unnecessary values.  

6. Your docstring for `AbelianGroupWithValues_class.values_group` is incomplete.

7. Indentation problem at the end of the docstring for `Group` (right before `def __init__`)

8. You set  `Element = FractionalIdealClass` on `SFractionalIdealClass(FractionalIdealClass)`.  This should be done on the parent, not the element.

9. There doesn't seem to be a failure in the test suite for `ClassGroup`, so you should remove the sentence about a failure caused by not having a category of additive abelian groups.

10. In `unit_group.py` you use `_.value()` a few times; can you give `UK.torsion_generator()` (etc)  a name and use it instead of `_`?

21. You have a docstring floating that needs to be deleted where `gen(self, i=0)` used to be in `UnitGroup`

* There's a failure in the startup plugin.  I have no problem giving a positive review even so, but I thought I'd point it out in case you wanted to change anything related to imports.  :-)
