The MIP backends just need a method base_ring(), say, that returns the base ring that the backend wants.

OK, this is easy, I hope. I'll work on this tonight. As far as I understand, the base ring is RDF for all the backends, expect PPL.

Actually, is it even needed to provide base_ring() in the backends that have RDF as the base ring? Can't PPL backend just overwrite it? I gather Python has such an option:

```
    class A(object):
        ...
       def a(self):
           ....
    class  B(A):
       ...
       def _A__a(self):
           ...
     
```
so B overwrites A.a() this way. Or is this wrong/not applicable?

I'll hook this into the LinearFunctionsParent, patch coming...

Does anybody mind if we typeset the linear functions more like polynomials? That is,

```
sage: R.<x_0,x_1> = QQ[]
sage: 1+2*x_0+3*x_1
2*x_0 + 3*x_1 + 1
```
instead of

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: x = p.new_variable()
sage: 1+2*x[0]+3*x[1]
1 +2 x_0 +3 x_1
```
I think spaces around +/- and explicit * are more readable, and would make the output more uniform.

This is not what the classic file formats for inputting LPs do, see e.g.

http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/5.0/reference-manual/node746

Designed for punchcards, I reckon :-)

Myself, I'd prefer it polynomial way though. I think, ideally, this should be customizable.

The patch now enforces that the coefficients are in the base ring. Also, pretty printing is fixed. There is also a way to change the default for the multiplication symbol if you want to.

I noticed that the `mip.show()` code doesn't use the pretty printing of linear functions but rolls its own, so its output is unchanged for now.
