So, I guess that's the job of #13868...

I beat you to it, the metaticket is #13864 ;-)

I suggest we close this as duplicate

I first considered #13864 not as a meta-ticket, but as a ticket with the single purpose to configure Python with pydebug when SAGE_DEBUG is set to "yes". But as you now changed it into a "task": Yes, it is a duplicate.
