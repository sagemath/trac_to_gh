```
The .reduce() function for a polynomial ring can return an 'int' type when the base field is a p-adic field.

```
R.<y1,y2>=PolynomialRing(Qp(5),2, order='lex')
G=[y1^2 + y2^2, y1*y2 + y2^2, y2^3]
type((y2^3).reduce(G))
```
It should be returning an element of the polynomial ring.

This was noticed since it causes .variety() to fail.

```
R.<y1,y2>=PolynomialRing(Qp(5),2, order='lex')
G=[y1^2 + y2^2, y1*y2 + y2^2, y2^3]
I=ideal(G)
I.variety()
```

If you mean that the warnings are bothering you, then yes, that's okay. Unless I misread the Singular manual, it doesn't deal with Qp, though I could be wrong (I know next to nothing about p-adics, and Singular does deal with Zp). If Singular DOES implement Qp, then we haven't yet implemented that interface. That should be another ticket, though, because this bug would likely pop up even if we weren't in Qp.

Hunh. I didn't know about that. I wonder if I can remember it for the future... `;-)`

Thanks.  This looked good on my tests as well.

Yes, that result from .variety() is the correct final answer, well really the result is the point (1:0:0) in projective space Qp, but up to precision that is what is returned. The warnings I ignored ;)
