```
With Python 2.7 there's a native implementation in python's itertools:

```
sage: list(itertools.combinations_with_replacement([1,2,3,4],2))
[(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)]
sage: sage.combinat.combinat.unordered_tuples([1,2,3,4],2)
[[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 3], [3, 4], [4, 4]]
```
Given that the current doc of `unordered_tuples` mentions that it wraps a GAP routine and that this is undesirable, replacing it (or deprecating it!) may be a good idea.

In order to get the behavior to match, I had to call `sorted(set(S))` on the base set `S` when using `itertools`. On using the output from GAP, I had to do `map(tuple, eval(ans))` because that returned lists (or sometimes strings). I've given the choice to the user to decide on which algorithm. Here are some timings (with GAP already running):

```
sage: %timeit unordered_tuples([1,2,3],2,algorithm='itertools')
10000 loops, best of 3: 31.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit unordered_tuples([1,2,3],2,algorithm='gap')
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.65 ms per loop
sage: %timeit eval(gap.eval( "UnorderedTuples(%s,%s)"%([1,2,3],ZZ(2)) ))
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.65 ms per loop

sage: %timeit unordered_tuples([1,2],6)
10000 loops, best of 3: 31.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit unordered_tuples([1,2],6,algorithm='gap')
100 loops, best of 3: 2.33 ms per loop
sage: %timeit eval(gap.eval( "UnorderedTuples(%s,%s)"%([1,2],ZZ(6)) ))
100 loops, best of 3: 2.06 ms per loop

sage: %timeit unordered_tuples(range(30), 6)
1 loops, best of 3: 590 ms per loop
sage: %timeit eval(gap.eval( "UnorderedTuples(%s,%s)"%(range(30),ZZ(6)) ))
# I got bored after a minute and killed it
```
So even with everything, there is a major speedup. Now once this gets replaced with libgap (#16719), we'll have to rerun timings.

Hello,

Why not a deprecation? It is nowhere used in Sage code and it would be good to advertise users that it is infinitely better to use itertools directly.

What about `tuples` vs `itertools.product`

```
sage: S = [1,2]
sage: %timeit tuples(S,3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 26.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit list(product(S,repeat=3))
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.74 µs per loop
```
And the function `number_of_tuples` should not wrap anything, the answer is just `len(S)^k`.

In the present case `itertools` is always faster and I think people should use itertools directly.

Yes it does. This is one more function in the global namespace, one more file to maintain.

This seems to be a very bad political idea. It is very likely that even though nobody ever uses this implementation because it is obviously slower than itertools, nobody will ever be able to give a formal proof that it is slower in all cases.

All of `tuples`, `number_of_tuples`, `unordered_tuples` and `number_of_unordered_tuples` are in the global namespace. I do not claim that your branch adds something to the namespace but that it was already useless noise.

@nathanncohen Even if you could show it is always slower (large sets can behave very differently, so it's not obvious to me), it makes it better testing because they are independent algorithms (although it is highly unlikely one of the algorithms has a bug).

The "native" implementation of `tuple` is recursive, and with the current implementation it passes the string `'native'` to itself a zillion times. Am I seeing ghosts or could this be an inefficiency? (I would implement the native algorithm, if anywhere, then in a separate method `tuples_native`, which would recurse upon itself, and which I would then reference *one time* from `tuples`.)

On `number_of_tuples`, is there really any chance for a gap call to beat `return ZZ( len(set(S)) )**k` ? I imagine the `set` call could take a while if `S` consists of complex things, but then again the doc of `unordered_tuples` warns against passing complex things to gap, which I assume should also apply to `number_of_tuples`. But I am too lazy to do timings...
