```
With Python 2.7 there's a native implementation in python's itertools:

```
sage: list(itertools.combinations_with_replacement([1,2,3,4],2))
[(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)]
sage: sage.combinat.combinat.unordered_tuples([1,2,3,4],2)
[[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 3], [3, 4], [4, 4]]
```
Given that the current doc of `unordered_tuples` mentions that it wraps a GAP routine and that this is undesirable, replacing it (or deprecating it!) may be a good idea.

In order to get the behavior to match, I had to call `sorted(set(S))` on the base set `S` when using `itertools`. On using the output from GAP, I had to do `map(tuple, eval(ans))` because that returned lists (or sometimes strings). I've given the choice to the user to decide on which algorithm. Here are some timings (with GAP already running):

```
sage: %timeit unordered_tuples([1,2,3],2,algorithm='itertools')
10000 loops, best of 3: 31.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit unordered_tuples([1,2,3],2,algorithm='gap')
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.65 ms per loop
sage: %timeit eval(gap.eval( "UnorderedTuples(%s,%s)"%([1,2,3],ZZ(2)) ))
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.65 ms per loop

sage: %timeit unordered_tuples([1,2],6)
10000 loops, best of 3: 31.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit unordered_tuples([1,2],6,algorithm='gap')
100 loops, best of 3: 2.33 ms per loop
sage: %timeit eval(gap.eval( "UnorderedTuples(%s,%s)"%([1,2],ZZ(6)) ))
100 loops, best of 3: 2.06 ms per loop

sage: %timeit unordered_tuples(range(30), 6)
1 loops, best of 3: 590 ms per loop
sage: %timeit eval(gap.eval( "UnorderedTuples(%s,%s)"%(range(30),ZZ(6)) ))
# I got bored after a minute and killed it
```
So even with everything, there is a major speedup. Now once this gets replaced with libgap (#16719), we'll have to rerun timings.

Hello,

Why not a deprecation? It is nowhere used in Sage code and it would be good to advertise users that it is infinitely better to use itertools directly.

Because using the `itertools` directly for a multiset gives multiple copies of the same tuple

```
sage: list(itertools.combinations_with_replacement([1,1], 2))
[(1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1)]
```
which is a different behavior (this should just return a single tuple of `[(1, 1)]`).

What about `tuples` vs `itertools.product`

```
sage: S = [1,2]
sage: %timeit tuples(S,3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 26.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit list(product(S,repeat=3))

And the function `number_of_tuples` should not wrap anything, the answer is just `len(S)^k`.

In the present case `itertools` is always faster and I think people should use itertools directly.

Yes it does. This is one more function in the global namespace, one more file to maintain.

The "native" implementation of `tuple` is recursive, and with the current implementation it passes the string `'native'` to itself a zillion times. Am I seeing ghosts or could this be an inefficiency? (I would implement the native algorithm, if anywhere, then in a separate method `tuples_native`, which would recurse upon itself, and which I would then reference *one time* from `tuples`.)

On `number_of_tuples`, is there really any chance for a gap call to beat `return ZZ( len(set(S)) )**k` ? I imagine the `set` call could take a while if `S` consists of complex things, but then again the doc of `unordered_tuples` warns against passing complex things to gap, which I assume should also apply to `number_of_tuples`. But I am too lazy to do timings...
