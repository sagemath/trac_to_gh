The main problem is that lists are not hashable. Therefore a cached function can't take a list as an argument and, consequently, I can't use the decorator `@`cached_function to cache the result of q_jordan (at least without changing the prototype of this function).
Moreover, working with just one function would imply to check the shape of the inputs at each recursive call (which is of course useless and may cost a lot).

I propose another implementation (using `@`cached_function and a nested function) in trac_13640_qjordan-2.patch. Please tell me whether it's better or not according to you.

Maybe this would also solve the hash problem ?

Sorry I did not comment earlier; the network at the airport was crappy. It would certainly be natural for the input to q_jordan to be a partition, and it should indeed fix the problem.

That being said, this does not necessarily imply that q_jordan should be a method of partitions. It might be more natural to put instead q_jordan with the other q-analogues, as a function taking a partition as input.

I let you judge which option is best.
