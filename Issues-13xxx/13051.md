When a 2D point is plotted with the `faceted argument, there is no way to change the colour of the border from black. This makes it look inconsistent with other graphical objects, such as function plots, if they are of another colour (see attached image). These faceted points are useful for showing discontinuities in functions, so it'd be nice to be able to customize.

As well, the default border colour should probably be blue in accordance with the default for normal points.
