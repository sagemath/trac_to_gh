Two small remarks on this patch:
1. "is the one roduced by this method." -> "is the one produced by this method."
2. edges are added twice: (x, bar(x)) and later (bar(x), bar(bar(x))=x ). I don't know how to prevent this with simple tests without increasing current running time, but if you have some nice idea...
