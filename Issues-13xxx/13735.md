Currently, we have

```
sage: alpha,beta,gamma=FreeAlgebra(ZZ,3,'alpha,beta,gamma').gens()
sage: latex(alpha-beta)
\alpha + \left(-1\right)\beta
```

This patch turns this into

```
sage: alpha,beta,gamma=FreeAlgebra(ZZ,3,'alpha,beta,gamma').gens()
sage: latex(alpha-beta)
\alpha - \beta
```

Hi!

Scratching my own itch, I've changed the code for repr_lincomb to properly handle negative coefficients as well as zero. It required one change to how coeff_repr works which may cause problems. I've included testcases for repr_lincomb. 

Is there a way how can I test the rest of sage only for this specific change? I don't want to run all the numerical test which take quite a while on my machine.

To see if your patch causes problems somewhere, you cannot do much that running the complete doctests...

I am in the middle of bugfixing right now. 

```
sage: R.<q> = ZZ[]
sage:  A2 = WeylCharacterRing(['A',2], base_ring = R, style="coroots")
sage: [A2(x) for x in [-1]]

[-1*A2(0,0)]
```

This is because the type of the coefficient -1 is sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_integer_dense_flint.Polynomial_integer_dense_flint and the test c < 0 evaluates to False

Is this a bug or intended behaviour?
