Since we're setting `LIBRARY_PATH` in `sage-env` (which is the *compile-time* equivalent of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, corresponding to the compiler flag `-L`), we should analogously set `CPATH` to `SAGE_LOCAL/include` (corresponding to the compiler flag `-I`).  This is already done in the `spkg-install` file for `sagenb-0.10.2`.

Within Sage, `SAGE_LOCAL` effectively acts as installation prefix, so this is the logical thing to do.  A GCC compiled within Sage will already look at `SAGE_LOCAL/include` by default.

This doesn't immediately change anything, but it will allow simplifying many `spkg-install` files by not having to care about `-I$SAGE_LOCAL/include` anymore.

**Apply** [attachment:13348_CPATH.patch] to `SAGE_ROOT`.

Furthermore, Sage's paths should get **pre**pended, not **ap**pended, at least if using this feature is supposed to "replace" explicitly specifying paths in commands / `CFLAGS`, `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS`, e.g. in `spkg-install` scripts.

And if `ld` is used directly (as opposed to linking with `gcc` / `g++` etc.), `LIBRARY_PATH` won't get used at all (unless it is part of the `make` rule, say).

Even if `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` got **pre**pended to `LIBRARY_PATH`, system folders might still get searched before those specified in `LIBRARY_PATH`.
