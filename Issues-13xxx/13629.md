Keywords: sd59

Currently, to add xgcd functionality for a new polynomial ring, one needs to add a specialized subclass of PolynomialElement.

The attached patch allows rings to provide a `_xgcd_univariate_polynomial` method which will be called by PolynomialElement to compute xgcds.

This is similar to #10635, #13442.

> 1. In which case(s) will each of these implementations be used?
  
The implementation in `sage.rings.ring.Field` is used if the base ring inherits from `Field`.
The implementation in `sage.categories.fields.Fields.ParentMethods` is used if the base ring is a field but does not inherit from `Field`; the method is then looked up by the category framework.

The latter situation is sometimes detected only at runtime:

```
sage: R = Zmod(7)
sage: R._xgcd_univariate_polynomial
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'IntegerModRing_generic_with_category' object has no attribute '_xgcd_univariate_polynomial'
sage: R in Fields()
True
sage: R._xgcd_univariate_polynomial
<bound method IntegerModRing_generic_with_category._xgcd_univariate_polynomial of Ring of integers modulo 7>
```
I suspect it is a feature (to avoid a potentially costly primality test) and not a bug that the method only appears after we have forced `R` to refine its category...
> 2. Is the implementation in `Fields` really needed?
  
I think it is, as the above example shows.
> I note that the exact same questions are equally relevant for the positive-reviewed (by myself!) ticket #18461. I simply did not think of that issue before.

I did have the above picture in mind when working on both tickets, and I am afraid the situation is unavoidable without lots of refactoring.

One thing that could be done to reduce duplication is making `quo_rem` the primitive operation that base rings of polynomial rings should implement, instead of the two operations `_[x]gcd_univariate_polynomial`.  That would be something for a follow-up ticket, though.

I am not sure what would be the best solution to avoid code duplication in such cases, though I totally agree that it does not belong to this ticket! 

I'm running tests to check everything is OK.

Hmmm, there my git knowledge is not sufficient I guess. So let me take the opportunity to ask a few questions:

1. My `develop` branch is up-to-date (6.8.beta1). When I switch to this branch (`git checkout t/13629/...`) I need to recompile a lot. I there a way to decrease the compilation needed to work on such tickets?
2. Since the ticket depends on #18467, shouldn't you add a commit to merge #18467?
3. What is the correct (or the best one if there are several) way to merge #18467, so that I can correctly test this branch?
