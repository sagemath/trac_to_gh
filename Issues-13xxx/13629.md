```
Currently, to add xgcd functionality for a new polynomial ring, one needs to add a specialized subclass of PolynomialElement.

The attached patch allows rings to provide a `_xgcd_univariate_polynomial` method which will be called by PolynomialElement to compute xgcds.

This is similar to #10635, #13442.

There's a typo in the documentation of `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx`: 

```diff

I'm happy with the current state of the ticket, but it is probably good if someone checks my last two commits before this can get a positive review.

The implementation in `sage.rings.ring.Field` is used if the base ring inherits from `Field`.
The implementation in `sage.categories.fields.Fields.ParentMethods` is used if the base ring is a field but does not inherit from `Field`; the method is then looked up by the category framework.

The latter situation is sometimes detected only at runtime:

```
sage: R = Zmod(7)
sage: R._xgcd_univariate_polynomial
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'IntegerModRing_generic_with_category' object has no attribute '_xgcd_univariate_polynomial'
sage: R in Fields()
True
sage: R._xgcd_univariate_polynomial
<bound method IntegerModRing_generic_with_category._xgcd_univariate_polynomial of Ring of integers modulo 7>
```
I suspect it is a feature (to avoid a potentially costly primality test) and not a bug that the method only appears after we have forced `R` to refine its category...

I think it is, as the above example shows.

I did have the above picture in mind when working on both tickets, and I am afraid the situation is unavoidable without lots of refactoring.

One thing that could be done to reduce duplication is making `quo_rem` the primitive operation that base rings of polynomial rings should implement, instead of the two operations `_[x]gcd_univariate_polynomial`.  That would be something for a follow-up ticket, though.

I am not sure what would be the best solution to avoid code duplication in such cases, though I totally agree that it does not belong to this ticket! 

I'm running tests to check everything is OK.

The current branch does not pass the tests. The failed test is in `src/sage/rings/ring.pyx`, lines 2196-2203:

```python
sage: for A in (RR, CC, QQbar):
....:     g = A._gcd_univariate_polynomial
....:     R.<x> = A[]

....:     assert(g(2*x, 2*x^2) == x and

....:            g(2*x, z) == x and
....:            g(z, z) == z)
```

More precisely, I've got the following severe bug:

```python
sage: R.<x> = RR[]
sage: z, h = R(0), R(1/2)
sage: (xx, hh, zz) = RR._xgcd_univariate_polynomial(2*x, 2*x^2)
sage: zz == z
False
sage: zz-z
BOOOM! (SegFault)
```

The crash log is empty.

Hmmm, there my git knowledge is not sufficient I guess. So let me take the opportunity to ask a few questions:

1. My `develop` branch is up-to-date (6.8.beta1). When I switch to this branch (`git checkout t/13629/...`) I need to recompile a lot. I there a way to decrease the compilation needed to work on such tickets?

3. What is the correct (or the best one if there are several) way to merge #18467, so that I can correctly test this branch?

> > 1. My `develop` branch is up-to-date (6.8.beta1). When I switch to this branch (`git checkout t/13629/...`) I need to recompile a lot. I there a way to decrease the compilation needed to work on such tickets?

> `git pull trac u/pbruin/13629-xgcd_univariate_polynomial`; this merges with the branch that you have currently checked out (`develop` in this case)

Doesn't this modify my *local* `develop` branch? What I did finally to review the ticket is to create a new branch (`git branch ticket/13629`), then pull your branch (`git trac pull 13629`, which I guess does the same as what you propose). So finally this is close to what you mention. 

My question though: Isn't it *dangerous* to modify the local `develop` branch? (I wouldn't like to take the risk to mess up some things I do not understand ;-).)

Thanks again!

Right, I did not mention the `git checkout ticket/13629` that I indeed did. Thanks again, and thank you for the shortcut! The way it works is now clearer.
