Currently, to add xgcd functionality for a new polynomial ring, one needs to add a specialized subclass of PolynomialElement.

The attached patch allows rings to provide a `_xgcd_univariate_polynomial` method which will be called by PolynomialElement to compute xgcds.

This is similar to #10635, #13442.

There's a typo in the documentation of `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx`: 

```diff
+ Compute an extended gcd of this polynomialn and ``other``.
```

Otherwise, I've the same comment as for [ticket:13442#comment:15 #13442] on `self` versus `this polynomial`.

<a id='comment:27'></a>
With the current state of this ticket, there are two implementations of `_xgcd_univariate_polynomial`, one in the class `Field` (in `src/sage/rings/rings.pyx`) and one in the class `ParentMethods` of the class `Fields` (in `src/sage/categories/fields.py`). 

1. In which case(s) will each of these implementations be used?
2. Is the implementation in `Fields` really needed?

I note that the exact same questions are equally relevant for the positive-reviewed (by myself!) ticket #18461. I simply did not think of that issue before.

The implementation in `sage.rings.ring.Field` is used if the base ring inherits from `Field`.
The implementation in `sage.categories.fields.Fields.ParentMethods` is used if the base ring is a field but does not inherit from `Field`; the method is then looked up by the category framework.

The latter situation is sometimes detected only at runtime:

```
sage: R = Zmod(7)
sage: R._xgcd_univariate_polynomial
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'IntegerModRing_generic_with_category' object has no attribute '_xgcd_univariate_polynomial'
sage: R in Fields()
True
sage: R._xgcd_univariate_polynomial
<bound method IntegerModRing_generic_with_category._xgcd_univariate_polynomial of Ring of integers modulo 7>
```
I suspect it is a feature (to avoid a potentially costly primality test) and not a bug that the method only appears after we have forced `R` to refine its category...

I think it is, as the above example shows.

I did have the above picture in mind when working on both tickets, and I am afraid the situation is unavoidable without lots of refactoring.

One thing that could be done to reduce duplication is making `quo_rem` the primitive operation that base rings of polynomial rings should implement, instead of the two operations `_[x]gcd_univariate_polynomial`.  That would be something for a follow-up ticket, though.

I am not sure what would be the best solution to avoid code duplication in such cases, though I totally agree that it does not belong to this ticket! 

I'm running tests to check everything is OK.

The current branch does not pass the tests. The failed test is in `src/sage/rings/ring.pyx`, lines 2196-2203:

```python
sage: for A in (RR, CC, QQbar):
....:     g = A._gcd_univariate_polynomial
....:     R.<x> = A[]
....:     z = R.zero()
....:     assert(g(2*x, 2*x^2) == x and

....:            g(2*x, z) == x and
....:            g(z, z) == z)
```

More precisely, I've got the following severe bug:

```python
sage: R.<x> = RR[]
sage: z, h = R(0), R(1/2)
sage: (xx, hh, zz) = RR._xgcd_univariate_polynomial(2*x, 2*x^2)
sage: zz == z
False
sage: zz-z
BOOOM! (SegFault)
```

The crash log is empty.

> Yes, I should have said that you should create a new branch first, which seems to be what you did (but be careful to check out the branch first with `git checkout ticket/13629`; you can actually create the new branch at the same time with `git checkout -b 13629`).
Right, I did not mention the `git checkout ticket/13629` that I indeed did. Thanks again, and thank you for the shortcut! The way it works is now clearer.
