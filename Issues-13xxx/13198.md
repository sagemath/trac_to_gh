The following is clearly wrong

```
sage: M=ModularSymbols(Gamma1(22),sign=1)
sage: S=M.cuspidal_submodule();S
Modular Symbols subspace of dimension 6 of Modular Symbols space of dimension 25 for Gamma_1(22) of weight 2 with sign 1 and over Rational Field
sage: S.new_submodule()
Modular Symbols subspace of dimension 4 of Modular Symbols space of dimension 25 for Gamma_1(22) of weight 2 with sign 1 and over Rational Field
sage: S.old_submodule()
Modular Symbols subspace of dimension 3 of Modular Symbols space of dimension 25 for Gamma_1(22) of weight 2 with sign 1 and over Rational Field
```
It's wrong because the new and the old subspace should be disjoint and together span the whole space. 
Note that the answers are as expected when using modular forms:

```
sage: M=ModularForms(Gamma1(22))
sage: S=M.cuspidal_submodule();S
Cuspidal subspace of dimension 6 of Modular Forms space of dimension 25 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma1(22) of weight 2 over Rational Field
sage: S.new_submodule()
Modular Forms subspace of dimension 4 of Modular Forms space of dimension 25 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma1(22) of weight 2 over Rational Field
sage: S.old_submodule()
Modular Forms subspace of dimension 2 of Modular Forms space of dimension 25 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma1(22) of weight 2 over Rational Field
```

Ps. I tested this using sage 5.2.alpha0

I am not sure I agree with your diagnosis on the sage-devel thread. The definition of the old submodule as the sum of the images of the degeneracy level-raising maps makes perfect sense in this setting; it won't be orthogonal to the kernel of the level-lowering maps, but it should still be Hecke-invariant and the space Sage is returning here just isn't:

```python
sage: M22 = ModularSymbols(Gamma1(22), sign=1)                                                       
sage: M2 = ModularSymbols(Gamma1(2))                                                                 
sage: d1 = M2.degeneracy_map(M22,1)                                                                  
sage: d2 = M2.degeneracy_map(M22,11)                                                                 
sage: M22.hecke_matrix(17).restrict((d1.image() + d2.image()).free_module())                         
...
ArithmeticError: subspace is not invariant under matrix
```
The problem, I think, is this:

```
sage: M2                                                                                             
Modular Symbols space of dimension 1 for Gamma_0(2) of weight 2 with sign 0 over Rational Field
```
and thus M2 is trying to use code intended for passing between Gamma0 levels instead of Gamma1 levels.

I will fix this during SD51 if I have time.

Here's a patch. The actual change is very small, but I cleaned up some ReST formatting and added a file to the ref manual at the same time.
