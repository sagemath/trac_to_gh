Since the `full_output.txt` files generated by the notebook are often changed, the client web browser should always ask for a new version instead of retrieving a cached version.

We need to add the right HTTP headers to instruct the browser to always request a new version of `full_output.txt` from the server.

Are you sure it doesn't update? Are you requesting an explicit reload from your browser? As an example:
If I do

```
for i in range(1000):
    print i
```
in the notebook and click `full_output.txt` I get the output as requested (in a new tab).

If I now change the same cell:

```diff
 for i in range(1000):
-    print i
+    print i^2
```
the tab `full_output.txt` doesn't change when I use firefox. This is because newer versions of Firefox, when asked to open a URL that is already open in some tab or window, will just change to that tab/window; it does not reload the content. Once I explicitly ask to reload that file, I do get the updated output.

The above behaviour is not a bug in Sage. It's an issue with Firefox and it's probably considered a feature. There may be a setting in `about:config` to influence this behaviour. Probably other browsers have similar behaviour.

If your observations do not agree with what is described above, please describe them.
