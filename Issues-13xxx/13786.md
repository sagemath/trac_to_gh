Some of these were fixed in #10772, but a few remain. Find/grep show,

* ./rings/padics/padic_capped_relative_element.pyx
* ./rings/padics/padic_fixed_mod_element.pyx
* ./rings/padics/padic_ZZ_pX_CR_element.pyx
* ./rings/padics/padic_ZZ_pX_FM_element.pyx

Unless any of these are special (for whatever reason), we should return `1` instead from the appropriate ring.

See also: #13894, #13895, #13897, #13941.

Just a general statement on the documentation in these patches. I'd prefer to see the `0^0` formatted either in latex <code>\`0^0\`</code> (which would display as 0<sup>0</sup>) or as a code literal <code>\`\`0^0\`\`</code>.

Thanks,

Thank you. It suppose to make the docreader (which may only really be me) understand that it is suppose to be code/input.

Also, for the remaining ones in the padics, could you just put them all in one patch (possibly on this ticket)?

Thanks,

Travis

Patch is up. I had split them initially to make it easier for (potentially) multiple reviewers. Thanks for taking a look at all of them.

I've removed ntl_lzz_p.pyx from the list per #13940. This patch should take care of the remaining four.

Does this depend on #13940 anymore?
