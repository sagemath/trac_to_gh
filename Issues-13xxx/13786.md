Some of these were fixed in #10772, but a few remain. Find/grep show,

* ./rings/padics/padic_capped_relative_element.pyx
* ./rings/padics/padic_fixed_mod_element.pyx
* ./rings/padics/padic_ZZ_pX_CR_element.pyx
* ./rings/padics/padic_ZZ_pX_FM_element.pyx

Unless any of these are special (for whatever reason), we should return `1` instead from the appropriate ring.

See also: #13894, #13895, #13897, #13941.

I've removed ntl_lzz_p.pyx from the list per #13940. This patch should take care of the remaining four.
