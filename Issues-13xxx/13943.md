It would be good to have a method to compute the automorphism group of a simplicial complex.

This patch implements that.

And also a procedure to check wether two simplicial complexes are isomorphic

It would be good to have a method to compute the automorphism group of a simplicial complex.

This patch implements that.

And also a procedure to check wether two simplicial complexes are isomorphic.
