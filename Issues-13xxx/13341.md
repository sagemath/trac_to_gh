Rather than expressing hope, how about testing for the presence of `gap`? ;-)

You could also just use `ln -sf ...` ("force"), which doesn't fail if the source (second parameter) already exists, i.e., with `-f` a new link is created regardless.  No idea how that behaves on Cygwin with "virtual" files; it may create a cycle (symbolic link from 'gap.exe' to itself), or fail in other ways, then hopefully raising an error...

(Note that `ln -s <non-existent-1> <non-existent-2>` does **not** fail, but instead creates a "dead" symbolic link [although not sure about that on Cygwin, since we use `touch` to create a dummy target].  So you may also have to check whether the target, `gap.exe`, really exists, i.e., the "build" so far succeeded, here meaning `mkdir`, `cd` and `touch` worked... :-) )


If you don't want to use the "force" option, you could instead do

```sh
        mkdir -p bin/i686-pc-cygwin-gcc &&
        cd bin/i686-pc-cygwin-gcc &&
        touch gap.exe &&
        (test -f gap || ln -s gap.exe gap)   # Probably don't use '-x'
                                             # since 'gap.exe' is yet a dummy.

        if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
           # *Something* really went wrong...
           ...
           exit 1
```

But perhaps it's better to at least slightly untangle the command chain:

```sh
        mkdir -p bin/i686-pc-cygwin-gcc &&
        cd bin/i686-pc-cygwin-gcc &&
        touch gap.exe

        if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
            # Some serious error...
            ...
            exit 1
        fi

        # We may need a link from 'gap' to 'gap.exe', since the former later gets
        # stripped by GAP.
        # On newer Cygwins, 'gap' is automatically "translated" to 'gap.exe',
        # such that 'ln' (without '-f') would fail (and we don't have to create the
        # link on these systems anyway, since 'strip gap' there works without it).
        if [[ ! -f gap ]]; then
            ln -s gap.exe gap
            # May check exit status here, since the above should never fail.
        fi
```

Good point, let's do something more sensible.
I prefer your two second solutions.
Maybe more the last one, although I'm not sure the first exit code test is really needed.
But ok it does not hurt.
