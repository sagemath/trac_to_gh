This ticket implements plot options to control the graphical display of polygons:

```
    def plot(self, 
             point={}, line={}, polygon={},
             wireframe={}, fill={},
             **kwds):
        """
        Return a graphical representation.

        INPUT:

        - ``point``, ``line``, ``polygon`` -- Parameters to pass to
          point (0d), line (1d), and polygon (2d) plot
          commands. Allowed values are

          * Python dictionary: Passed as keywords to the plot
            commands.

          * String or triple of numbers: The color. This is equivalent
            to passing the dictionary ``{'color':...}``.
          
          * ``None`` or ``False``: Switch off drawing of the
            corresponding graphics options.

        - ``wireframe``, ``fill`` -- Similar to ``point`` / ``line`` /
          ``polygon``, but ``fill`` is used for the graphics objects
          in the dimension of the polytope and ``wireframe`` is used
          for all lower-dimensional graphics objects.

        - ``**kwds`` -- optional keyword parameters that are passed to
          all graphics objectcs.

        OUTPUT:

        A graphics object.

        TESTS::

            sage: square = polytopes.n_cube(2)
            sage: plt = square.plot()
            sage: for p in plt:
            ...       print p.options()['rgbcolor'], p
            (0, 0, 1) Point set defined by 4 point(s)

        Draw the lines in red and nothing else::

            red Line defined by 2 points
            red Line defined by 2 points

        Draw vertices in red, no lines, and a blue polygon::

It looks like there is absolutely no way to guess from looking at [1] which options are accepted by all these methods... Would it be possible to add a list of them, or at least a pointer toward a place where those options are defined ?

Hi Volker!

Yes, the user interface is much better as you did it! Thanks for the gift :-)

I ran some systematic tests and added them to the documentation/tests
of plot. I stumbled on a couple corner cases, and reworked a bit the
logic in plot. In particular, the default value for the colors is now
handled by plot. A consequence is that the default coloring is uniform
for all dimension, whereas we used to have:

- 2D: blue wireframe, light green (0,1,0) fill
- 3D: light green (0,1,0) fill, blue wireframe
- 0D, 1D: everything blue

Is that ok?

The default is currently set to "green" for the fill and "blue" for
the wireframe, but feel free to change it to your taste. I also did a
couple micro improvements to the doc. If you are happy with the
reviewer patch, feel free to fold it in, customize the default colors
and set a positive review on my behalf (assuming I did not screw up
and the patchbot remains green of course).

Cheers,
                       Nicolas

Oh, just one thing: since there maybe several points, lines, and even polygons (3D), should the options be named ``points``, ``lines``, ``polygones``?

There may be multiple points but only one point option setting, which is why I settled on the singular. Also, none of the other plot options are plural afaik. Since you apparently don't have a particular preference either I'd say we keep it in singular.

Positive review to the revewer patch...

Ok!

Great :-)

That might well be our first joint patch; it's been a pleasure!

And at the end of the day, I am actually going to use the point/line option to get a wireframe root system plot that my daughter can reproduce with her construction kit :-) So you were perfectly right it was to be done in full!
