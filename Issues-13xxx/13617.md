The following code produces a SEGFAULT:

```
sage: R = ZpCR(5,5)
sage: S.<x> = R[]
sage: f = x^5 + 75*x^3 - 15*x^2 +125*x - 5
sage: W.<w> = R.ext(f)
sage: W.zero().matrix_mod_pn()
```

If you set it to "needs review" then the patchbot will run doctests for you.  You can feel free to make a comment saying that you're waiting on the patchbot to run tests.

I just didn't want to give various tickets a positive review if you were still planning on adding more code/documentation.  :-)

I think one should avoid writing <code>\`\`self\`\`</code> in the docstrings. As a beginner, I found it quite hard to understand what it meant and it is present in quite a few documentations. Only when I started writing classes could I grasp its true meaning. Perhaps the last line can be rewritten as follows? It's up to you, whether you deem it acceptable.

My suggestion is to change this

```
(unless ``self`` is zero to arbitrary precision; in that case the entries are integer zeros.)
```
to

```
If this element of the ring is zero to arbitrary precision,
then the entries of the matrix are integer zeros.
```

The patchbot will eventually pick up "new" tickets, but only after doing all the needs and positive review ones. 

+1 removing the explicit reference to self

Just as a note, it's easier to read the diff (and see what changed) if you don't re-wrap the portion of the docs that you're not editing.
