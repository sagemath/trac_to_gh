```
There are two problems with the current spkg on Cygwin:
* -lgmp should come after -lntl and -lpari, I fixed this in configure.ac
* the executables names in tests/Makefile.am should finish with $(EXEEXT), fixed there as well.
* the -no-undefined flag should also be passed to libtool so that a shared library gets built on Cygwin and for sage.libs.mwrank to be functional.

All of this is fixed in the 2012-08-30 upstream release.

Updated spkg available at:
http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/sage/eclib-20120428.p0.spkg

Although I'd prefer package an updated upstream version including such fixes.
John, could you update eclib ggoglecode repo?
If you're convinced the changes I propose are useful...
At least, they seem harmless on Linux and let the spkg build on Cygwin.

Another question to John:
 For the PARI stuff, would you consider renaming the function to something
 else?
 That would allow to link the programs statically (not that I really care,
 I think it's more important to let Cygwin find the shared lib of PARI
 before the static one anyway).

Apparently pari creates a libpari.dll.a file but I guess Sage does not correctly copy it.
I also see strange
if test "libpari-gmp.dll" != "libpari-gmp.dll"

Have to have a look to pari spkg install script...

Yes you have to somehow tweak PARI to let d2 build.

The quickest hack is to copy libpari.dll to libpari.dll.a.

However I'd prefer to copy the proper import file dll.a ggenerated by PARI when it's build.

And I'd prefer such a fix to be included in PARI itself rather than in a Sage spkg.
I'll contact the PARI team today.
Hopefully this could make it into 2.5.2 for which Jeroen is currently preparing a spkg as well.

there are 2 files named libpari.dll in SAGELOCAL. One in bin/, and another in lib/...
And both of them aren't archive files, but "real" dlls.
Tried your hack for the one in bin/, it didn't help.

And, by the way, how would it help the problem of <code>multiple definition of \`_roots'</code>
This looks like overlinking rather than underlinking to me.

I never said they were archive files...

I said that when linking the linker finds libpari.a BEFORE libpari.dll.
But as there is already a function named _roots in an object file included in libpari.a it fails.
That's the problem.

From now on, lets suppose we live in the lib directory and forget about the bin one which is not of interest for our purposes.

So a hack consists in making sure that the linker find libpari.dll BEFORE libpari.a.
To do that, you can copy libpari.dll to libpari.dll.a.
You could just rename it if you want to have some fun.
You could also delete libpari.a or rename it to jdlksjlkdjls.

Or we could explicitely tell the linker to use libpari.dll, rather than just passing -lpari, but that needs more work.
And anyway, PARI generates a file ending by .dll.a.
AFAIK it's not a copy od libpari.dll, not a dll file, but some import file.
The point is that the linker will find it BEFORE libpari.a if its present and by looking at it it will automatically use the libpari.dll file.

The point is that if you link to the dll rather than the archive file, ld won't complain, which is quite understandable because the _roots function from libpari is not needed nor called directly from eclib (and how could it be anyway as theres a function called so in eclib itself).
The two namespaces/worlds are kept as separate as possible with ld just doing its magic when needed.

If you link archive files together, ar will try to put everything from pari and from eclib in one file, in particular it will have some trouble putting to functions with the same name in that one file.
The two namespaces/worlds are colliding.

I'm going to need some help & advice here.  Since the last release of eclib with autotools there are three sets of changes:  (1) the ones by you people for Sage (triggered by cygwin issues);  (2) some changes sent to me by email by Bernhard Link of debian;  (3) changes made by me to make FLINT 3 a prerequisite, since by using FLINT in a few key places I obtain a vast speedup of some programs (nto ones used by Sage currently).  Clearly I can absorb the first two sets easily, but I am not sure about the last one, since until Sage starts to use FLINT 3 I would have to get autoconf to determine whether or not to use FLINT by setting some compiler switches or similar.  And I am very capable of getting very confused in merging 3 sets of changes to anything...

FLINT 3? Is that a super secret project :)
If you mean FLINT 2.3, I personally think that it should quickly go into Sage, see #12173, which seems (almost?) functional to me.

I still have some issues with Cygwin there, so the spkg I posted is not vanilla #12173, but rather vanilla plus a quite large rewrite of the build system.
I'm aware that's a bad idea, because it won't get into FLINT 2.3, but I won't have the time to produce a bunch of small patches in order for only the Cygwin part to get included.

As Cygwin is not required to be supported, we should surely just ship a vanilla FLINT 2.3 when it gets released and wait for Bill to integrate my changes (if he feels like) in a 2.4 or subsequent release.

Spkg is now fixed.
The error was caused by the fact that files of the build system were patched and so their timestamp updated.
Then autotool magic wanted to regenerate some of them, which would fail because some pieces needed to do that are missing (this would also be true with the previous spkg).
So touching some files in the right order after patching solves the issue.

I want to make sure that understand the changes that you made so I can make them "upstream" and hence avoid any patching.  I realise that this will mean a new version of the spkg:  when I am done the eclib version will be bumped up to 2012-08-21 (assuming that I finish today) so the next spkg can have a new name instead of a patch level.

From the Changelog in SPKG.txt:

```
+ * #13325: let eclib build on Cygwin.
+ * Put -lgmp after -lntl and -lpari in configure.ac.
+ * Add $(EXEEXT) to the targets in tests/Makefile.am.
+ * Add '-no-undefined' flag to libjc.la LDFLAGS so that a shared library
+   is built on Cygwin.
+ * automake and autoconf were run to regenerate the configure script and
+   Makefiles.
```

1. will no longer be necessary.  These flags are now set i nthe various Makefile.am using the macros LIBADD and LDADD, and I did put gmp last.

2. $(EXEEXT).  I assume that this is set on cygwin (to ".exe" or something) but not otherwise, so (apart from cluttering up the Makefiles) there will be no effect on other systems?   You say that this is done in src/tests, but should it also be done in src/progs?  The latter builds some binaries which are actually installed (e.g. mwrank).

3. '-no-indefined' OK I can add that too.  By the way, the library name is now libec and not libjc.

4. OK, so I'm a bit uncertain as to which auto* files to actually include.  When I change configure.ac or any Makefile.am files I run autoreconf.  I never touch or look at configure or the actual Makefiles.

So I will now deal with points 2 and 3 and hand back to you, if that is OK.

Yes, this is only "really" needed on Cygwin.
On most systems, let's say Linuxes, $(EXEEXT) will be void, so putting it or not won't have any visible effect.

If I remember correctly, the executables in the progs directory already magically included the $(EXEEXT) (or at least the file produced ended up in .exe).
There must be some difference between the two Makefile.am you used.
I can have a look if you want.

I'm not really sure of what should be included in a distribution tarball, I've begun fighting with autotools just a few weeks ago.
What was really painfull here is that it seemed that having a more recent configure than aclocal.m4 was detected by configure itself and let it try to regenerate aclocal.m4 (which failed because of the lack of a proper m4 directory with I don't really know what macros inside).
The same was true for Makefile.in.

Don't know what the behavior if you actually omit the configure.ac and Makefile.am files.

Disregard this last comment, I did not get what you said.
The splitting of progs and tests is posterior to the current spkg Sage ships.

But yes, I guess you could add $(EXEEXT) everywhere I guess, I must admit I don't really really remember if this is really necessary on Cygwin... but on Windows executables usually finish with .exe, so it can not hurt.
Plus, on recent Cygwin versions, there seems to be some automatic translation from prog to prog.exe (I guess this also made my changes actually work when setting SAGE_CHECK, because I did not add $(EXEEXT) at each invocation of the programs as I just realized).

I think I now remember what the problem was:
* autotools indeed does its magic with $(EXEEXT),
* but you directly put smattest (and others) in a target, so make tries to build it generically and doesn't use the magic smattest$(EXEEXT) target and its autotools CFLAGS (and the one you provided to it) so it fails
* except on Linux (and others) where the autotools magic defines a target for smattest and we get lucky...

Here is an excerpt of what failed on Cygwin:

```

smattest.cc:30:25: erreur fatale: eclib/arith.h : No such file or directory

```
After adding $(EXEEXT) I got

I fear the problem is still present.
Have a look at tests/Makefile.in; there at line 571, the PROCS_TESTS variable is defined as a list of executable names which do not include $(EXEEXT).
So when make will try to build the procs_tests target, it try to build targets without the $(EXEEXT), which on Cygwin are not defined by the autotools magic because EXEXT is not empty.
On Linux, as EXEEXT is empty, there will be no problem.

I'll confirm that Cygwin fails in a few tens of minutes.

Mmmm, in fact the build failed while linking libec.
Not really sure what the point of LIBADD is, but it does not get used for libec.
Although there is a libec_la_LIBADD variable which is empty in Makefile.in.
Maybe that's what you meant to add?
http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/autobook/autobook_92.html suggests it is at least (no plain LIBADD variable mentionned there, only the LIBADD macro).

The non-failure of the smattest and co might just be luck.
Now the Makefile producedfirst includes an all target line with as dependencies all the binaries (so with the EXEEXT extension).
And at the end of the Makefile, the all dependencies from your Makefile.am file is also included, so it points through the procs_tests target to the binaries without the EXEEXT extension.

What happens I guess is that make first generates the file with a .exe extension, and when it want to generate the files without .exe, the automagic translation made by Cygwin makes it think that smattest=smattest.exe is already uptodate.

Not sure why this did not happen before.
Maybe was the noinst_PROGRAMS line in Makefile.am added recently?

Whatsoever, I'm not convinced that relying on this behavior from Cygwin is a good idea.

Great!
I guess this implies removing noinst_PROGRAMS but also some dependencies for the all target:

```
progs: procs_progs qcurves_progs qrank_progs g0n_progs
```
which would become

```
progs: $(bin_PROGRAMS)
```
if that works,
or something like

```
if ALLPROGS
PROGS = $(PROCS_PROGS) $(QCURVES_PROGS) $(QRANK_PROGS) $(G0N_PROGS)
else
PROGS = mwrank$(EXEEXT)
endif

progs: $(PROGS)
```

For all the programs tested in a similar way, you could replace

```
check_qrank: qrank_progs
	@echo Checking qrank programs...
	./mwrank < $(test_input_dir)/mwrank.in > mwrank.testout 2>/dev/null && diff mwrank.testout $(test_output_dir)/mwrank.out
	./reduce_quartics < $(test_input_dir)/reduce_quartics.in > reduce_quartics.testout 2>/dev/null && diff reduce_quartics.testout $(test_output_dir)/reduce_quartics.out
	./quartic_points < $(test_input_dir)/quartic_points.in > quartic_points.testout 2>/dev/null && diff quartic_points.testout $(test_output_dir)/quartic_points.out
	rm -f PRIMES 1
```
by something like

```
check_run = ./$(prog)$(EXEEXT) < $(test_input_dir)/$(prog).in > $(prog).testout 2>/dev/null && diff $(prog).testout $(test_output_dir)/$(prog).out || exit $$?

check_qrank: qrank_progs
	@echo Checking qrank programs...
	$(foreach prog, $(PROCS_PROGS), $(check_run))
	rm -f PRIMES 1
```
Or, potentially better cause it can use parallelism, using Makefile dependencies

```
check_run = ./$<$(EXEEXT) < $(test_input_dir)/$<.in > $<.testout 2>/dev/null && diff $<.testout $(test_output_dir)/$<.out || exit $$?

%_RUN: %$(EXEEXT)
	$(check_run)

qrank_progs_RUN: $(addsuffix _RUN, $(QRANK_PROGS))

check_qrank: qrank_progs qrank_progs_RUN
	rm -f PRIMES 1

```
provided it works.

And for parts were not every executable is tested in this way, you could create a secondary variable

```
QRANK_PROGS_TEST = ...
```
including only the ones to be tested and use it instead of

```
QRANK_PROGS
```
directly.

I'll test such ideas tonight.

Here is a patch which seems more or less functional in Linux at least (except that autoreconf -i rants about GNU extensions...).

A couple of remarks:
* the programs in test are only built for make check
* in progs, when make check is run all programs are built and tested even when -disable-allprogs was passed, thats maybe not the most sensible choice
* as mentionned above, some comments about files checked should be modified, and some other added
* I've forgot to remove some file which should not be tested, so it fails at some point

About the fact that only mwrank is installed in Sage, after thinking a little bit about that, I'm not convinced anymore that providing an option in your build system only to please Sage is really relevant.

I mean that if at some point someone decides to integrate more of them, you'll have to modify your build system once more.
Whereas having everything installed by default is not so painful, that's just a few more kB which are insignificant in comparison with Sage's current size.

Oh, I somehow failed to included such changes in the patch I uploaded here.
As you noted, the changes should be similar to those for progs.

Just one remark, for the programs to be built in test, you can use check_PROGRAMS which ensures that they are only built for make check, rather that noinst_PROGRAMS.

OK, I will try using check_PROGRAMS, good idea.

One side-effect of using the loop (foreach...) for the tests is that instead of each test being visible on a separate line they are all run together with ";" separating them (which I see you included, as it does not work without).  That does not look good.  I have a version in which first check_run is changes slightly replacing $(prog) by $${prog}, and then instead of the foreach I have

```
for prog in $(PROCS_TESTS); do	$(check_run); done
```
which works --it gives no output at all when the tests pass except echoing the whole input line:

```
jec@fermat%(cd tests; make check)
Running procs checks...

Looks really nice.

In tests dir, you forgot to replace LDADD by LIBS and the dependencies of check targets by binaries names with EXEEXT appended (it should work as is, even on Cygwin, but for a bad reason as mentioned before).

And unfortunately, I don't think the echo -e command is portable.
For example it will behave differently on bash and dash.
(On of them will just print -e and will not interpret the \c).

Finally, as I'm a little confused by your answer about what programs in progs are built/check, I did not suggest not to check every program when allprogs is not set and make check is run.

In fact I rather suggested to always build and install (and check) every program, i.e. remove the allprogs option.
Hence, in the future, if Sage uses more programs from your package it wont need further modification (and it will only take a little more time, and a tiny amount of memory, when built for Sage).

If you want to keep the option, i suggest you add the programs different from mwrank in check_PROGRAMS when the option is disabled (I'd say you could even include mwrank for simplicity, to use the already defined variables).
That way, automake will generate its magic targets to build the executables (Ive not tested yet, but Id say the generated Makefile won't include anything specific currently and they will be built generically... and surely fail).

In fact automake always generates its magic for all file because their all in one of the bin_PROGRAMS, its just the one actually built which change.
Anyway, using check_PROGRAMS cannot hurt.

Fixed.   The testing just outputs the test name (one per line) as it goes, with no "done" at the end since that would go on a separate line which did not look good.  So, no news is good news for test output.

I have kept the allprogs option (set to true by default).  When false: "make" builds the library and mwrank only (nothing in tests, nor the other prgrams in progs) while "make check" builds and tests everything.  When true: "make" builds the library and all programs in progs (nothing in tests) while "make check" builds and tests everything.

The spkg at
http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/sage/eclib-20120824.spkg
built and passed its tests on Linux.
It also built on Cygwin but got stuck while testing smattest at the end of the test during the rank computation.
I don't think the later failure should be a blocker, the situation is already much better on Cygwin, and the problem could have another origin (some dependency being broken or I don't know what).
And Cygwin is not supported officialy anyway.

I've updated module_list.py to take the name change into account.
I've also removed Leif comment about pari and leave it in the libraries dependencies.
Indeed, this is needed if we try to link the concerned modules against a static version of eclib.
This triggers the need of a static version of pari and the corresponding dependency, and that not only on Cygwin.

In a perfect world, this will never be needed because everything will properly build as shared libraries, but we never know what will happen.
Until now eclib was only build static on Cygwin, so the problem surfaced, now it is also shared, but things may change and I don't think the inclusion of pari hurts enough to be removed right now.

And I think this is now needs_review

I think I got the smattest issue.
This must be a type length issue (and several warning about overflow in xmod.h during compilation should have made me realize it earlier).

In smat_elim.cc, if I use the "works fine" code in xmm0 rather than the David Harvey's one, the test passes.

I think the problem is with INV_BIGPRIME being defined as long, which is 32 bits here on Cygwin I guess and does not fit (1<<33)+140!) rather than int64_t, whence the warnings during compilation.
I'm recompiling right now and will retest.
If that's indeed the problem, that should not be restricted to Cygwin but anywhere where long is only 32 bits.

What needs to be done before there's a positive review?  More checking on Cygwin (which I cannot help with) or what?  Do we need more people to test jpflori's spkg on other architectures?

It is ok on Windows 7.
I think the main point is to someone to look at the spkg diff.
Anyway, most of the work has been done by John upstream (or let's say integrated for the few things I suggested if there are any), so the spkg diff is quite minimal (if there is any, I don't really remember).
So this should really be trivial.

I don't think "testing" on "exotic" (let's say non linux) architecture is still needed.

Nor testing on Linux, but that won't hurt :)

What I think really matters is for someone to look at [attachment: trac_13325.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13325/trac_13325.patch.gz) and say "ok, this makes sense, let's merge this".

I think that even John could put himself as reviewer here as he worked on the "upstream" side of this ticket (and I agree with all the great work he did if he needs some approbation on his side).
