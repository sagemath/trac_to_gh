Currently

```
sage: R = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: type(R.gen().coefficient(0))
<type 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>
sage: type(R.gen().coefficient(1))
<type 'int'>
sage: type(R.gen().coefficient(2))
<type 'int'>
```
it should be always `Rational`

I also fixed the following bug:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.species.series import LazyPowerSeriesRing
sage: L = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: g = L.gen(); z = L.zero()
sage: s = z+g; s
Uninitialized lazy power series
sage: s.coefficients(10)
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
sage: s
Uninitialized lazy power series
```
It should be:

```
sage: s.coefficients(10)
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
sage: s
x + O(x^10)
```

Salut Florent,

There are some failing tests:

```
sage -t sage/combinat/tutorial.py  # 5 doctests failed
sage -t sage/tests/french_book/polynomes.py  # 7 doctests failed
```

Could you fix those or move the patch down the queue?

Thanks,
                            Nicolas

Ceterum censeo, `_sum_generator_gen` and `sum_generator` still need to be documented...

Mike, thank you for the docstring! I've understood it now. I've just attached my version of your review patch, which adds another example hopefully clarifying how to use sum_generator *in practice*.

I must say I'm a bit surprised to see division (`__div__`) defined in `generating_series.py` but not in `series.py`. I am also surprised by the lack of `_neg_` (or `__neg__`?) in both files, although one can use (-1) * u of course. Finally, subtraction of lazy power series does not seem to work (it ends in `RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in __instancecheck__`).
