```
Currently

```
sage: R = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: type(R.gen().coefficient(0))
<type 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>
sage: type(R.gen().coefficient(1))
<type 'int'>
sage: type(R.gen().coefficient(2))
<type 'int'>
```
it should be always `Rational`

I also fixed the following bug:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.species.series import LazyPowerSeriesRing
sage: L = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: g = L.gen(); z = L.zero()
sage: s = z+g; s
Uninitialized lazy power series
sage: s.coefficients(10)
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
sage: s
Uninitialized lazy power series
```
It should be:

```
sage: s.coefficients(10)
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
sage: s
x + O(x^10)
```


Depends on #14685

Salut Florent,

There are some failing tests:

```
sage -t sage/combinat/tutorial.py  # 5 doctests failed
sage -t sage/tests/french_book/polynomes.py  # 7 doctests failed
```

Could you fix those or move the patch down the queue?

Thanks,

Ceterum censeo, `_sum_generator_gen` and `sum_generator` still need to be documented...
