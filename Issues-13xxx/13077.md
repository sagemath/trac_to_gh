The Tamari lattice is a partial order on planar binary trees or Dyck paths.

(see [Tamari Lattice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamari_lattice) in Wikipedia)

It has been generalized recently by F. Bergeron and his collaborators.

The patch below implements these lattices, and even more general versions.

Salut Frédéric--

A couple of thoughts.  Maybe paths_in_triangle should take a parameter "slope" instead of a,b?  Alternatively, I think the code should check that (i,j) is actually in the rectangle between (0,0) and (a,b).  

In the definition of "swap", the code as written requires m to be an integer, but why do it like that?  For arbitrary relatively prime a,b, I think a/b is a natural choice of parameter.  This matches the "rational Catalan combinatorics" (see the two sets of Rational Catalan Combinatorics slides at Drew Armstrong's website http://www.math.miami.edu/~armstrong/research.html).  One downside to the further generality is that I don't know whether or not it's a lattice.  But I don't think that's really an argument against implementing it.  Maybe an appropriate analogue of Bousquet-Mélou--Fusy--Préville-Ratelle, arXiv:1106.1498, Proposition 4 holds?  But a glance, it wasn't obvious to me that it would.  

I also think it would be good to include a reference for the generalized Tamari lattice in the documentation (and/or a more complete definition).

cheers,

Hugh

Hello Hugh,

thanks for having a look at that.

I have added a few tests in the new version of the patch. In particular, one checks that (i,j) is in the correct half-rectangle.

In these lattices, m is really another independant parameter, having nothing to do with a/b. It would not make sense here to make m a rational number. Morally, m is the quotient of the lengths of vertical and horizontal steps, which defines a hidden notion of diagonal, which is used in "swap" to define the coverings.

I understand that I would be much better if these lattices are described somewhere. So far, they do not appear in print.

Do you think it is neccessary to explain in the patch why they are indeed lattices ?

Maybe the paper I mentioned above by Bousquet-M\u00e9lou--Fusy--Pr\u00e9ville-Ratelle.  That shows the m-Tamari poset is a lattice, and it's not very far from that to the general (a,b) case, right? (Since the (a,b,m) case occurs as an interval in the m-Tamari.)  I don't think it's necessary to include a reference for every relevant mathematical fact, of course, but I think it could be helpful for someone who stumbles across this code to be able to find some further information and context.  \n\nSpeaking of which, I'm wondering how a user is supposed to find this code.

Replying to [chapoton](#comment%3A11):

Hi Fred,

I attached a review patch containing several improvements (hopefully) for the doc strings. Beside that, I think the patch is ready to go. I though have two remaining questions:

- I think you should mention that the generalised Tamari lattice is only conjectured to be a lattice (there is at least no publicly available source of a proof).

- You are mixing British English ("nonnegative") and American English ("generalised"): I think it would be nice to make this consistent, and to actually check if "generalised/generalized" is already used in other placed in Sage to keep consistency here.

Cheers, Christian
