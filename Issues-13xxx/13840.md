This patch speeds up `IntegerListsLex` by removing calls to sage's `infinity` and instead uses `float('+inf')` and `float('-inf')`.

Before the patch:

```
sage: time p = Partitions(150, max_slope=-1, length=15).list()        
Time: CPU 14.04 s, Wall: 14.64 s
```
After:

```
sage: time p = Partitions(150, max_slope=-1, length=15).list()
Time: CPU 3.97 s, Wall: 4.14 s
```
