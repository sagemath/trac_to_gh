Keywords: (semi-)monomial group, semilinear action, isometry group

A semimonomial group over a ring `R` of length `n` is equal to the semidirect product of the monomial group and the group of ring automorphisms. The multiplication of two elements `(\phi, \pi, \alpha)(\psi, \sigma, \beta)` with

* `\phi, \psi \in  {R<sup>*}</sup>n`
* `\pi, \sigma \in S_n`
* `\alpha, \beta \in Aut(R)`

is defined by:

  `(\phi, \pi, \alpha)(\psi, \sigma, \beta) := (\phi * \psi^{\pi, \alpha}, \pi * \sigma, \alpha * \beta)`

with

  `\psi^{\pi, \alpha} := (\alpha(\psi_{\pi(0} ) ), \ldots, \alpha(\psi_{\pi(n-1} ) ) )`

and an elementwisely defined multiplication of vectors.

This group plays an important role in coding theory since it is the group of all semilinear isometries (relative to the Hamming/Lee/homogenous metric) of the ambient space.

I do not understand the rest of your comment. This group **is** a generalization of the monomial group, since you just add the group of field automorphisms, similar to the construction of the general semilinear group. I think `AutomorphismGroupOfLinearCode` would be confusing, since the elements of this group need not to define an automorphism of a linear code. The automorphism group of a linear code is a subgroup of the semimonomial group.

Another characterization would be the group of semilinear Hamming isometries.

I did not find any answer to your question. But the wreath product G \wr S_n is known as the
*complete monomial group*. So, do you think I should call my group  
`CompleteSemimonomialGroup` or `SemimonomialTransformationGroup` to emphasize the difference?

The symmetric group S_n is the group of monomial automorphisms of the n-dimensional binary vector space.

Oh, good point. I was somehow assuming that there is at least one non-trivial unit.

Unfortunately, people do not use group actions in coding theory... I also prefer *semimonomial transformation group* and *semimonomial transformation* for the elements. So, I changed the class names to these names.
