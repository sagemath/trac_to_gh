I am having difficulty how I'd go around verifying if I am doing it right. I build after modifying and check the docs from the notebook -- it is the same, although I expect some improvement! Should I commit? Please leave some pointers so I could work on this, when I get time.

Hello, you need to do the following.
1. Start a notebook and open a new worksheet.
2. Do your modifications to the file. Save it and rebuild it using `sage -b`
3. Go to the worksheet and select `Action -> Restart worksheet`.
4. Go to step 2 until done. `:-)`

To test your modifications:
1. For the stuff at the top of the file, simply evaluate `sage.ext.fast_eval?` (or press TAB after typing that path). If there are stuff like "Traceback...." in the doctest, then evaluating it might not show the full documentation. This is a bug in the notebook. In this case, either simply press TAB, or click to the left of the cell output just once, and you will see the full doctest.
2. For classes within that file, again simply evaluate them or press TAB, for instance you would see the output of the docstring in the class `FastDoubleFunc` by running `sage.ext.fast_eval.FastDoubleFunc?`.
3. For the methods within a class, use the full path to the method again, for example `sage.ext.fast_eval.FastDoubleFunc.__cmp__?`.
4. Finally, for functions within the file, again give the full path `sage.ext.fast_eval.fast_float?`.
5. If you have written each of those functions, methods, etc, in a different cell, then after selecting "Action -> Restart worksheet" after a rebuild of sage, you can select "Action -> Evaluate all" to evaluate all the cells. It is fast way to check your modifications.

The functions or methods which are starting with `cdef` are never visible from the python interface, so it is up to you whether you want to fix the docstrings in them or not. For a first pass, just leave them alone since there is no way to verify whether they are fixed or not.

EDIT: You **do not** need to build the docs with `sage -docbuild`, `make doc`, etc. You just need to build sage using `sage -b`.

For string formatting, you should look at the developer's guide
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#docstring-markup-with-rest-and-sphinx

Comments:

- remove trailing whitespaces (line 27, 42, ...)

- the docstring at the begining of the file should not be indented
 
- NOTE, AUTHOR field is not appropriately formated
 
- in `_richcmp_`  (line 928), you should add a linebreak between the description
  "Compare left and right." and the beginig of the examples

More to come at your next commit...
