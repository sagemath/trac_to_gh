Helloooooooo !!

This patch exposes the all_blocks method from GAP. I am not familiar with Sage's groups nor with the interface with GAP, so please feel free to teach me the basics while reviewing this patch `^^;`

I like this, but I'd like to bring up some issues and propose solutions. I'll help with writing, as much of this will depend on code I've written to the relevant file.

**Issues:**

1. We should implement more than just "AllBlocks" from GAP. First, this creates a naming problem for tab completion in sage. I propose the names such as "blocks," "blocks_maximal," "blocks_all_representatives," and so on.
2. GAP and Sage view permutation group domains differently. With certain automatically generated structures, this won't be an issue. But, with a group like <(2,3)>, which is viewed as transitive in GAP and intransitive in Sage (it fixes 1), we have an issue. I'm going to write the "non_fixed_points()" command that currently exists as an alias to "support()" and redefine the transitivity, regularity, etc. commands with this instead. (That will be backwards compatible. It's just that "support()" is more consistent with literature than "non_fixed_points()" and we should be using that if we're talking about blocks.) That's really a trivial change, but I should have realized this when I wrote "non_fixed_points()" in the first place. My bad. It will still exist and function in any case.
3. What isn't trivial is how these functions should apply to various groups. I've seen on the GAP lists some questions about GAP's block functions. The literature does largely discuss blocks for only transitive groups, but the definition of a block doesn't require it. As my research area is intransitive groups, this annoys me and GAP's functions are pretty inadequate. I think it should be relatively obvious that a maximal non-trivial block system for an intransitive group should simply consist of the orbits. A generic block system for an intransitive group should return a non-trivial block system on orbits, including the consideration of fixed points sitting outside of a transitive component (as happens in Sage and does not in GAP). I'll work on this and come up with something that makes sense.
4. As in GAP, we should have optional domain and seed parameters. This should function seamlessly with issue (3). I'll work on that.

Hi Nathann,

Looks good, I'm happy to see more of GAP wrapped. A couple of suggestions,

1. Strictly speaking, the function doesn't return a list of blocks, but as the GAP manual puts it: "a list of representatives of all block systems for a permutation group G acting transitively on the points moved by the group." I think it's clear from the output that what a user is getting is not a partition of the set, but a list of reps for an invariant partition, but it would be nice if the documentation mentions this.

2. In the `INPUT` description, I would change representants --> representatives.

3. Add a description of `OUTPUT`. In particular, I would have expected the function to return a list of lists of ints in all cases (each inner list representing a partition of the set). Instead, it returns either a list of lists, or a list of lists of lists depending on the input.

Otherwise, looks great to me! I think the enhancements `@`jasonbhill has brought up should be made a new ticket (which he can create if he's still interested).
