```

new functionality for the composition constructor:

- construct a composition from a subset


new functionality for compositions:

- parent -- returns Compositions()
- reversed - reverses
- refinement_splitting
- refinement_splitting_lengths
- deprecated refinement in favour of refinement_splitting_lengths
- partial_sums(self, final=True):
- to_subset(self, final=False):
- to_partition(self):
- shuffle_product(self, other, overlap=False):


new functionality for the set of all compositions:

- put it in the category of `InfiniteEnumeratedSets`
- subset method to extract subsets of composition (by size)

The errors were mainly due to the fact that the new category of *graded* enumerated sets does not yet exist (it exists on the sage-combinat queue, which is why tests passed on my machine). So I removed the two lines related to that.

I also modified a couple of doctests in `permutation.py`, which was caused by the change  the descents method.

Hello Mike,

Here is a final patch fixing some the issues with the documentation. The documentation now builds and renders nicely. Thanks for your suggestions.

I made separate patches so that it is easier for you to look at my recent changes (but if you prefer, I can post one patch). You only need to look at the following two files to see the changes I made after your review of the first patch:

- trac_13243-review_changes-fs.patch
- trac_13243-documentation_fixes-fs.patch

Hi Franco,

You promised to import these patches also to the sage-combinat queue, since the current patch there completely breaks sage-5.2.rc0. I am confused as to which patches are supposed to be applied. For example trac_13243-rebased_deprecated_function_alias-fs.patch also has a newer version trac_13243-rebased_deprecated_function_alias-fs.2.patch, but this is not the one listed in your list.

Thanks,

Anne
