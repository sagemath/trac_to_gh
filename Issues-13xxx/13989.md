PolyBoRi's next minor release will be out soon.
There were no changes of the interface between PolyBoRi 0.8.3 and 0.8.2, so we just have to update the sources from here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/polybori/files/polybori/0.8.3

PolyBoRi 0.8.3 is a bugfix release incorporating all previous patches from Sage.
It also fixes some bugs in the build system and tries to become more standard conformimng (library naming scheme).

<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
I add two issues, which are not strictly due to the spkg, but for compatibility reasons with the polybori 0.8.3 package on sage-on-debian.

The Sage library currently uses the .conf file generate by polybori to get `PolyBoRi`'s preprocessor defines. This is not necessary any more, since polybori stores them consistently in polybori/config.h now. (Removing this dependency is necessary, since .conf file is not part of polybori 0.8.3's debian package.)

Also, the Sage library should use the fully qualified library names, i.e. polybori-0.8, polybori_groebner-0.8, since the convenience link libpolybori.so is not installed by the debian package. This strictly depends on this ticket, because the library naming scheme had changes with 0.8.3.
