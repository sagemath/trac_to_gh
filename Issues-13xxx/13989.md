PolyBoRi's next minor release will be out soon.
There were no changes of the interface between PolyBoRi 0.8.3 and 0.8.2, so we just have to update the sources from here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/polybori/files/polybori/0.8.3

PolyBoRi 0.8.3 is a bugfix release incorporating all previous patches from Sage.
It also fixes some bugs in the build system and tries to become more standard conformimng (library naming scheme).

### Current spkg
* **Install** http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/polybori-0.8.3.spkg

### devel/sage
* **Apply** [attachment:remove_deprecated_polybori_stuff.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13989/remove_deprecated_polybori_stuff.patch)

**Assignee:** @malb

**CC:**  @burcin @malb PolyBoRi

**Upstream:** None of the above - read trac for reasoning.

**Reviewer:** Martin Albrecht, Julien Puydt, Jean-Pierre Flori

I add two issues, which are not strictly due to the spkg, but for compatibility reasons with the polybori 0.8.3 package on sage-on-debian.

The Sage library currently uses the .conf file generate by polybori to get `PolyBoRi`'s preprocessor defines. This is not necessary any more, since polybori stores them consistently in polybori/config.h now. (Removing this dependency is necessary, since .conf file is not part of polybori 0.8.3's debian package.)

Also, the Sage library should use the fully qualified library names, i.e. polybori-0.8, polybori_groebner-0.8, since the convenience link libpolybori.so is not installed by the debian package. This strictly depends on this ticket, because the library naming scheme had changes with 0.8.3.

Ok my latest try on Solaris with a better built GCC (using Sun's ld and as rather than GNU ones) was more successful with polybori 0.8.2 which buil successfully.

I'll check it is also the case for 0.8.3 asap.
