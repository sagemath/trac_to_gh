PolyBoRi's next minor release will be out soon.
There were no changes of the interface between PolyBoRi 0.8.3 and 0.8.2, so we just have to update the sources from here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/polybori/files/polybori/0.8.3

PolyBoRi 0.8.3 is a bugfix release incorporating all previous patches from Sage.
It also fixes some bugs in the build system and tries to become more standard conformimng (library naming scheme).

+PolyBoRi's next minor release will be out soon.
+There were no changes of the interface between PolyBoRi 0.8.3 and 0.8.2, so we just have to update the sources from here:
 
+https://sourceforge.net/projects/polybori/files/polybori/0.8.3
+
+PolyBoRi 0.8.3 is a bugfix release incorporating all previous patches from Sage.
+It also fixes some bugs in the build system and tries to become more standard conformimng (library naming scheme).
+
+### Current spkg
+* **Install** http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/polybori-0.8.3.spkg
+
+### devel/sage
+* **Apply** [attachment:remove_deprecated_polybori_stuff.patch]
 
 Upstream: None of the above - read trac for reasoning.
