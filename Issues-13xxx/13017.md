Several references to Chapters of HLA.  These should be removed or made clear.  First paragraph is from the chapter saying there is a Sage tutorial.  This **is** the tutorial.  So...this needs a sweep for references or comments that only make sense for the HLA chapter and not for the thematic tutorial.
