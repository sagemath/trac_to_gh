I added the main patch, as well as a second patch that I used to patch Sage's local copy of sphinx to generate "nicer" tex output.  I think you can probably safely ignore the sphinx patch.

Several references to Chapters of HLA.  These should be removed or made clear.  First paragraph is from the chapter saying there is a Sage tutorial.  This **is** the tutorial.  So...this needs a sweep for references or comments that only make sense for the HLA chapter and not for the thematic tutorial.
