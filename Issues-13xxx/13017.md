Jason Grout, Rob Beezer, Robert Bradshaw, and William Stein have mostly written a rather extensive thematic tutorial on linear algebra for Sage (for inclusion in the HLA = Handbook of Linear Algebra, 2nd edition).  It has a creative commons license.  This ticket is for getting the tutorial into Sage itself.  

The PDF version of this chapter is here: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/sage-HLA2.pdf

A git branch with the necessary changes is at https://github.com/jasongrout/sage/tree/hla (changes are listed at https://github.com/jasongrout/sage/compare/hla)

So...this needs a sweep for references or comments that only make sense for the HLA chapter and not for the thematic tutorial.
