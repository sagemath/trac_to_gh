Currently, one cannot call `content()` for a polynomial defined over `Qp`:

```
sage: K = Qp(3)
sage: R.<t> = K[]
sage: t.content()
TypeError: ground ring is a field.  Answer is only defined up to units.
```

The intention is apparently to protect the user from calling `content()` if he mistakenly got from `Zp` into `Qp`, since the content there would be always zero or one. However, this can be annoying when writing algorithms which work over `Zp` and `Qp` but which have to take the content into account over `Zp`.

Additionally, the content shows a somewhat strange behaviour for zero polynomials::

```
sage: R = Zp(3)
sage: S.<t> = R[]
sage: f = S(R(0,3)); f
(O(3^3))
sage: f.is_zero()
True
sage: f.content()
3 + O(3^23)
sage: _.is_zero()
False
```

I don't think that the current behaviour is mathematically incorrect, but I believe it's not very intuitive.

I believe `Polynomial_padic` did not exist when I wrote this first. Anyway, there is no reason, I'll change it.

This would be inconsistent with the current behaviour of `content()` over `QQ`. What should be the answer if a coefficient has negative valuation? I would rather stick to the usual definition of content. If people are interested in the content over `Zp`, then they should change the base ring.

`p^k` where `k` is the minimal valuation of the coefficients.

The "usual" definition doesn't care about the unit part, so answering `p^k` is a more useful and equally correct answer over `Qp`.

What is the value of `content_gen()`? It is almost always equivalent to `content().gen()` unless in some cases where both should raise an error?
