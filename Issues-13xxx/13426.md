```
In pull request https://github.com/gap-system/gap/pull/1135
I have attempted to reduce a list of packages loaded by default to

[ "autpgrp", "ctbllib", "factint", "fga", "irredsol", "tomlib" ],

With dependencies, this results in the following set of
packages being loaded at startup:

AtlasRep 1.5.1, AutPGrp 1.6, Browse 1.8.6, CRISP 1.4.4, CTblLib 1.2.2,
FactInt 1.5.3, FGA 1.3.1, GAPDoc 1.5.1, IO 4.4.6, IRREDSOL 1.3.1,
SpinSym 1.5, TomLib 1.2.6
```
so we should aim to have as many from the latter list as possible.
(packages that need GAP kernel extensions, like IO, are not possible to support ATM, as this will need changes in libGAP).

The bigger thing for me right now is `QuaGroup`. I got an e-mail where I could point towards #22623, but had some issues with telling them how to get the `QuaGroup` in a robust way.

I agree completely with points 1 and 2. For point 3, I feel that `gap_packages` is the closest thing that Sage has to an "official" way to install optional GAP pacakges because I think Sage tells users " you do not have to know anything about the underlying pacakges". So this would be a change to the official way, but I think in a good way.

Some other technical questions:

- What if we want a GAP package to only be for one version of Sage, what should the official way to install it (do we even care)?
- On my system, I do not have a `~/.gap` folder (of course, I can create one), but I do not have a non-Sage copy of GAP. Do we want this in `~/.gap` or some subfolder of `~/.sage` (in particular, `~/.sage/gap`)? At least, I don't think your proposal will work because:

  ```
  sage: gap.console()
  gap> Print( GAPInfo.RootPaths, "\n"); 
  [ "/home/travis/sage-build/local/gap/latest/" ]
  ```
- How do we get users to run `gap_reset_workspace()` (IIRC it is necessary)?

I am not sure we can enforce that. At the very least the version of gap associated with that version of sage would need to be unique.

After inspection, it seems to be related to how gap is started from sage. That will need to be inspected.

fbissey@moonloop ~/sandbox/git-fork/sage $ ./sage -sh

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.  Don't forget
to exit when you are done.  Beware:
 * Do not do anything with other copies of Sage on your system.
 * Do not use this for installing Sage packages using "sage -i" or for
   running "make" at Sage's root directory.  These should be done
   outside the Sage shell.

Bypassing shell configuration files...

Related to your previous question, RootPaths can be customised (and obviously it is done in sage already), so you could imagine adding a unique location for that version of sage.

I am aware of that problem and I am not sure. I wonder if upstream sees this as a problem or if it is particular to the way sage interface with gap.

I guess we already have this sort of problem with multiple Sage versions and `init.sage` being in `~/.sage`. So putting something in `~/.sage` would not exacerbate the problem.

Doing this, I get:

```
gap> Print( GAPInfo.RootPaths, "\n");
[ "/home/travis/.gap/", "/home/travis/sage-build/local/gap/latest/" ]
```
However, via `gap.console()` might be considered a special way of starting gap, but it is something I think we will need to address because

```
sage: %gap

  --> Switching to Gap <--

gap: Print( GAPInfo.RootPaths, "\n");
[ "/home/travis/sage-build/local/gap/latest/" ]

sage: gap('GAPInfo.RootPaths')
[ "/home/travis/sage-build/local/gap/latest/" ]
```
So within Sage calls to gap, it seems to use that version.

> Related to your previous question, RootPaths can be customised (and obviously it is done in sage already), so you could imagine adding a unique location for that version of sage.

I propose `~/.sage/gap`.

I'm guessing anything installed as proposed would also be available via libgap. At least via `gap_packages` in #22623 I was able to make calls via libgap. (Granted, I think this will be made moot when we go to the next gap version).

I have no idea. At least if we had some way to install this using something like `sage -i`, we could run it as part of our installation process.

I may have misunderstood you. You meant a gap package only available to sage, while with your wording I understood sage-X.Y. Is it correct?

Let me try to be more precise. Suppose I have two versions of sage, X and Y. I want to be able to install gap packages only available to X but not to Y.

Actually, thinking about this more, I don't think this would be a problem as if a gap package doesn't work with a particular version of gap, then it will fail normally. Plus there are probably better ways to compare two versions of a package. So I don't think this is really necessary.
