Add a file into the sage library about double square tiles. Double square tiles are polyominoes which tile the plane in two (regular) ways as a square (i.e. having four neighbors).

This file should go in `sage/combinat` or `sage/combinat/discrete_geometry` or `sage/combinat/polyomino` ?

<a id='comment:19'></a>Hello,

* this is about tiling but we see only one tile at a time... For example, it would be cool to have a parameter `translate` to `plot` in order to do:
    {{{
    sage: tile.plot(translate=(0,0)) + tile.plot(translate=(x,y))
    }}}
* what is the point of `verify_definition`? I guess its only purpose is for the constructor. If so 
  1. make it private
  2. do not use assert but rather raise a `ValueError` if something is wrong
* please consider moving `figure_11_BGL2012` to `sage/tests/`. It is not a library function!
* you should really add definitions, I can not understand what this code is doing. If you want to make it usable, then add documentation. Otherwise, put everything into `sage/tests`
* can you fold `apply_reduction`, `reduce_ntimes` in one function. It confuses to have different methods doing the same stuff.
* It is cool to have an `AUTHORS` section but please one line is enough:
  {{{
  - Alexandre Blondin Massé and Sébastien Labbé (2008-2013) - initial version
  }}}
* could you move `triple_square_example` to the examples at the begining (i.e. within the documentation)? or it is important to have it as a standalone function in the library?

More to come
Vincent
