I think that the whole point is to return an embedding of F<sub>q</sub> into its splitting field. For that, one has to be careful when constructing the extensions: either choosing the given polynomial (or a factor of it) to define the extension, or using some root finding algorithm.

Also, the patch fails in the last couple of Sage releases...

No, for F<sub>q</sub> the calling of Hom works:

```
sage: F = GF(3^4, 'z')
sage: K = GF(3^12, 'zz')
sage: F.Hom(K)
Set of field embeddings from Finite Field in z of size 3^4 to Finite Field in zz of size 3^12
sage: F.Hom(K)[0]
Ring morphism:
  From: Finite Field in z of size 3^4
  To:   Finite Field in zz of size 3^12
  Defn: z |--> 2*zz^10 + zz^8 + 2*zz^7 + zz^6 + 2*zz^5 + zz^4 + 2*zz^3 + 2*zz^2 + zz + 2
```

The problem over F<sub>q</sub> is elsewhere: some coercion problem when calling poly.change_ring().

I was going to review this, but ended up wanting to change almost everything, so here is a new version.  The doctests are the same as in the original, up to cosmetic changes.

The new implementation of this function is very short, as suggested by the above comments.  It just computes the degree of the splitting field over the base field, and then calls the `FiniteField_base.extension()` method implemented by #8335.

The `map` flag from the original patch is currently not understood, but for more flexibility, any additional arguments are now passed to `FiniteField_base.extension()`, which would be the right place to implement the `map` parameter.

The currently unused parameters have been removed; this ticket will probably be merged before #2217, and that one might change dramatically for all we know.

For coherence purpose, I copied the syntax of the patch proposed for ticket #2217 (hope it's ok), which is about splitting field for polynomial over number fields. Some of the argument are not used in the function, but again, it is for the overall coherence in case of integration of both patches.
+The purpose of this patch is to add the splitting_field() function to polynomial elements with coefficients in a finite field.
+
+See also #2217, the number field analogue of this ticket.
