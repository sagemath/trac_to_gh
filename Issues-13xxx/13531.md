1. The method short_vector_list_up_to_length does not return a list of vectors as claimed in the documentation.
2. Even with lattices of rank 6 and determinant 3 it takes really long to get the result. This is not PARI's fault (which is called in the background), but pexpect's.
3. In some cases no result will be returned because to many GP queries are performed. This exceeds the maximal number of GP's sage[...] variables.

All this is fixed (the speed only in parts) by the attached patch.

This is PARI Bug#1394, fixed upstream in commit 2d4455dc481cc0f0b09900e97c4fbb2e87b8db4d.

I had to make even further changes, since Pari sometimes returns incorrect results. I will send a report to upstream, and I have built in a work around for the moment. For the record, I reproduce the corresponding example here.

```
qf = [72, 12; 12, 120];
vecs = qfminim(qf, 2*22953421 - 2);
matsize(vecs[3])
for(i=1,matsize(vecs[3])[2],if(72 * vecs[3][1,i]^2 + 24 * vecs[3][1,i]*vecs[3][2,i] + 120 * vecs[3][2,i]^2 > 2*22953421 - 2, print(vecs[3][,i])))
```
gives the following:

The test for the too long vectors is marked long time, because on my system it takes about 140 seconds. Currently, this is the best example I have.

I have looked for the bug report, and I can't find it. I might have forgotten to send it, so I have just sent it. I post the bug number as soon as possible.
