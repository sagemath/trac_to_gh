<a id='comment:4'></a>The patch looks good. I have some minor comments on the documentation :

- the sentences " a dictionary containing all keys of dictionaries in ``dict_list`` (and non-zero values) being the sum of the values in the different dictionaries. "

are not extra-clear. Maybe something like that would be more clear :

a dictionary containing all keys of dictionaries in ``dict_list``, with values being the sum of the values in the different dictionaries (keys with zero value are omitted)

- if you use :param x:, maybe you need to write r""" at the beginning of the doc ?

I saw that Travis used parameters for simplicial complexes - and I must say that I do very much prefer this in the html documentation!

If others say: but most people use the command line, and there "INPUT" is nicer. Then okay, I would revert back to use "INPUT". Otherwise I leave parameters as is.
