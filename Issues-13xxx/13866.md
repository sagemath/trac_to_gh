I made a quick gdb spkg. If you used `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` to build a debug python, then the host python will most likely be unhappy: debug and normal python have a different ABI, and new gdb's link against libpython since they have significant knowledge about python internals.

Are you sure that gmp, mpfr, mpc and ppl are dependencies of `gdb`?  I don't really find any evidence of that.  I agree that PPL is checked for, but it doesn't seem required:
