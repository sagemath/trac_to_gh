Looks good to me. (I'm not sure how this fits in with #13432; would it be worth it to recast everything in terms of `SAGE_LOCAL`? At the top of the file, you could do something like this:

```
SAGE_ROOT      = os.path.realpath(os.environ['SAGE_ROOT'])
try:
    SAGE_LOCAL     = os.path.realpath(os.environ['SAGE_LOCAL'])
except KeyError:
    SAGE_LOCAL     = os.path.join(SAGE_ROOT, 'local')
```
and then use `SAGE_LOCAL` everywhere in the rest of the script. This belongs on another ticket, though.)
