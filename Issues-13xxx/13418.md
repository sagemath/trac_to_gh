This adds the following method :

sage: g.g_ivank_string()

Oups, I updated the patch but forgot to click the box. Redone it: now both patches are the same.

The patch now works for any graph !

(there might be a limit for the size... I don't know)

Needs review!

Hello!

I like this graph visualisation very much, but the implementation is, I think, a problematic one.

I see no issue with the situation chapoton described (calling the method in a terminal) as user probably do not expect great results from trying to invoke an interactive visualisation inside a terminal. :-) Actually, I do not know if show or plot makes any effort in this direction. It may be a topic for a new Trac ticket.

The problem is, IMHO, the IFRAME -- dependency on some internet server is not good at all, because admins could track our users, because Sage should work without an internet connection as much as possible, and because this internet server do not have to work in future.

So, what to do now? Well, the webpage with the script seems very non-free, the author explicitly claims copyright. There are similar open source solutions on the web that we can use locally (http://arborjs.org/ , for example). I would gladly help with that. Also, you can try to contact Ivan, and ask him if he wants to open the code. Again, I would gladly help with the integration.

Or, you can just ignore me as I am no big authority here. :-)

I agree with you. Returning an iframe that is hidden to the user was not a good idea.

Although there exists other open source alternative for doing such graph visualisation, I believe this patch is simple to code and useful for integration in Sage (I used it myself at least two times to visualize graphs since September). The interaction with other software (closed source or not) is not forbidden in Sage as there exists interfaces to Magma, Maple for instance. An interface to arborjs would be nice as well and I am willing to referee such tickets.

I uploaded a new patch. Instead, I just return an inoffensive string. The user may do whatever he wants with it. I think it is better like that. Before, the earlier code returning `html(s)` was problematic and prevented code reuse.

Needs review again!

Also, I followed the convention that methods returning string representation of a graph ends with `"string"` :

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.*string*?
g.graph6_string
g.graphviz_string
g.sparse6_string
```
