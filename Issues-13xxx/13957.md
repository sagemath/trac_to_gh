Can you add a doctest that illustrates the fix ?

Since I am not familiar with this, I would have prefer to do some test starting from a doctest, thus my question. So, no, I did not do any further review.

I completely forgot about this ticket. Vincent, could you do a minimal/small example by doing the doctest something like

```
sage: cython("""
....: class Foo(Element):
....:     pass
....: """)
sage: Foo() == Foo()
sage: Foo() < Foo()
```

Thanks,

Travis

Hi Travis,

I open the ticket because we made some stupid design decisions for #12224. The point was that we implement a coercion from lists to Words and we raised some `ValueError` if the content of the list does not match the alphabet. As I learn, it is definitely not what we want from a coercion: a coercion should always succeed.

I close it as wont fix.
