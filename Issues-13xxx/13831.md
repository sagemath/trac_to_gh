```
How to reproduce:
In a clean directory, put the following makefile

```
truc:
/opt/sage-5.2/sage crash-maxima.sage
```
(editing the location of sage to your local setup)

In a file crash-maxima.sage, put

```
x, y = var('x y')
desolve_rk4(x*y*(2-y), y, ics=[0,1], end_points=[0, 1], step=0.5)
```

then type:

```
    make truc
```

I did not manage to reduce this further, and in particular to reproduce the issue without going through ``make``. I tried the obvious things like checking what had changed in the environment and which shell was used to run the make recipe.

This is on Ubuntu 11.10, with Sage 5.3, 5.4, 5.4.1, and 5.5.rc0. With Sage 5.3 the memory seems to be eaten up at a faster speed. A few colleagues got the same crash on slightly different platforms (it appeared in our build process for the book Calcul Math√©matique avec Sage).

Same behavior when running `sage -c '...'` (replacing the single-quotes in `var(...)` by double-quotes of course) from a Sage subshell invoked by `make`, but not when starting `sage` interactively, pasting the commands, from such a subshell.

No idea yet what's really going on (i.e., what Maxima or ECL end up doing), but apparently some Sage scripts indeed "get confused" (or behave differently) when run from a `make` environment, probably then triggering some Maxima bug.

(And I can't reproduce Maxima running mad with `env MAKE=... MAKEFLAGS="" MFLAGS="" MAKELEVEL=1 /path/to/sage -c '...'`.)

Both tickets are still work in progress atm, or at least needing review... :P
