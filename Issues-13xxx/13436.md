Keywords: Elliptic curves, enumeration

Add functionality to Sage that allows one to enumerate elliptic curves over Q by height for a range of Weierstrass families of curve.

This code has grown from work with Wei Ho, who desired a way to enumerate curves over Q by height (where the height of a curve is a function of the coefficients in its Weierstrass model) so that the average value of some datum (e.g.rank, 2-Selmer size) could be computed for curves up to a given height. This code introduces a class, CurveEnumerator(), that computes lists of curves ordered by height for this purpose.

For the three_selmer function, you need a doctest.

```
sage: magma('2+2')  # optional - magma
```

Then

```
sage -t --only_optional=magma curve_enumerator.py 
```
to test.

* Here: `over Q up` I would put ``\\QQ`` or at `QQ`. 

* Either: Or: -- maybe instead a sublist of two things?

* weird formatting:

```
sage: C = EllipticCurveEnumerator(family="short_weierstrass")
sage: C.n_torsion?

       * "rank"              -- (Default True): Compute the rank versus
         size of the curve's torsion/n-torsion subgroup. If True, the
         n-torsion rank is computed (i.e. 0, 1 or 2). If set to False, the

         * "output_filename" -- (Default None): If not None, the string
    
         name of the file to which the output will be saved.
```

*  Restructure code so that this is natural:

```
v = EllipticCurveEnumerator(family="short_weierstrass", height=1000).ranks()
``` 

Will need caching:

```
sage: from sage.misc.cachefunc import cached_method
sage: cached_method?

There are three `AssertionErrors` that should be `ValueErrors`.

also `two_selmer` and `three_selmer` have an extra space for the OUTPUT portion of the docstring.

Thanks for converting this to git and fixing the docstring formatting (which I will trust has been done properly)!

Authors:  can you remove the place(s) where there are comments "this should be checked" or "todo"?  And in several similar places you can delete the comment that some integers must be Sage integers or ... some rather frivolous consequence will occur?

I see that you have carefully allowed for the unavoidable fact that there will be "problem curves" and have an option output filename for these.  But I don't think that any of the doctests illustrate this -- please add one or more doctests which do.  Meanwhile I am trying the functions out.
