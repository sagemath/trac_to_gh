That's the problem, there isn't really a good way to do this. There are some plans to change this, see #12720.

But usually when you're writing doctests, you would first run it interactively inside Sage (to know at least what the correct answer is). Then you would notice if the answer isn't returned immediately.

But I suppose when putting those into the book we could have taken notice which tests took a long time.\n\nAnne",
