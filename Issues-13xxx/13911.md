That's the problem, there isn't really a good way to do this. There are some plans to change this, see #12720.

But usually when you're writing doctests, you would first run it interactively inside Sage (to know at least what the correct answer is). Then you would notice if the answer isn't returned immediately.

Thanks for letting me know! In our case sagetex actually made the doctests from the latex source of the book. But I suppose when putting those into the book we could have taken notice which tests took a long time.
