This patch implements the bijection for type D_n^{(1)} between KR crystals and KR tableaux (which form a filling of the Kashiwara-Nakashima tableaux to rectangles). We went through several review cycles by e-mail and the patch looks good to me now.

Positive review! Thanks Travis for your work on this!
