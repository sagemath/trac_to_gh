At some point, the means of setting options for a `CombinatorialFreeModule` changed, but the file `interfaces/chomp.py` didn't get upgraded to use the new versions. As a result, some doctests fail in that file when CHomP is installed and `sage -t --optional ....` is run on it. The attached patch fixes this.

On OpenSuse 12.2 with gcc version 4.7.1 20120723 the CHomP package can't be installed: I had to fix some C++ name resolution errors first:

* change 'erase' to 'this->erase' in 'include/capd/homologicalAlgebra/ChainT.h'
* change 'containsPixel' to 'this->containsPixel' in 'include/capd/bitSet/CubSetT.hpp'

With these changes CHomP can be installed and the attached patch does indeed fix the mentioned doctest failures.
