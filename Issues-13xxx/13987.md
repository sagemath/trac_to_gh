Assignee: @VivianePons

CC:  @hivert sage-combinat @tscrim @darijgr

Keywords: trees

In the same manner as #8703 we want to implement trees with a fixed number of subtrees (equivalent of binary trees but with m subtrees). Especially to use them in the context of the m-Tamari lattices.

This ticket depends on #8703 as we use the implementation of OrderedTrees.

Related:

- #11369: generate k-trees up to symmetry
- #19479: Implement k-ary trees

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13987

Thanks. I've fixed the doctest. I don't know why the import of BinaryTrees wouldn't be needed. A good point can be made for conversions between `MaryTree(2, ...)` and `BinaryTree(...)`, but this can wait for another ticket.

Now to review the rest of this...

This is exactly the existing behaviour in binary trees. So I guess we can keep that for the moment. The recursive check is handled when creating a tree, I think.

```
sage: from sage.combinat.abstract_tree import from_hexacode
sage: M = MAryTrees(3)

...
TypeError: This is not a 3-ary tree

Some comments:

- I think it would be good to do a `TestSuite` on something like `MAryTree(3, [])` as an extra security check in the `MAryTree.__init__`.
- Do we want this MRO: `class MAryTrees_all(DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets, MAryTrees)`? If it is the other way -- `class MAryTrees_all(MAryTrees, DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets)` -- then I think we can remove the `__call__`. Even without changing the order, do we need it to go up the `MAryTrees` path?
- Do we want to have 2-ary trees create the corresponding `BinaryTree*` class? This would mean we do not have to convert back and forth.
- Related, do we want to have `BinaryTree*` inherit from its corresponding `MAryTree*` class?
- The `LabelledMAryTrees.__call__` can be removed.
- Lowercase error messages: `"Invalid word"` and `"Wrong number of nodes"`.
- There is a non-standard `.. note::` block.
- We should also specify in the `MAryTree` class-level doc that m-ary trees are plane/ordered trees.

I can make these changes tomorrow (tonight I am feeling a little lazy `^^;;`).

OK, what about point (2)?

Thank you.

Why not? It doesn't make sense to me both mathematically and programmatically. I can understand you wanting to postpone it for a later ticket (although I think change it really quickly), but I don't understand the opposition to having inheritance (and the constructors returning the `BinaryTree*` object when `m = 2`).

I'd like to try and help get this finished, though I'm not sure I'm qualified to be final judge and jury on the OOP/MRO aspects. At the very least, I can implement Travis's suggestion of removing ```LabelledMAryTrees.__call__``` , and try to reverse the order of inheritance for ```class MAryTrees_all(DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets, MAryTrees)``` and remove the ```__call__`` and make sure nothing breaks.

In terms of m=2, people seem fine with having conversion for now, and having inheritance be part of a later ticket to get this finished.

I can implement Travis's suggestion that the documentation being clearer about these being ordered/plane trees.

In terms of ```check``` only checking the outer layer, I'm pretty sure this should be fine, and it will recursively check the entire tree. But I can try and make a test case to be sure.

I'll make a thorough pass in the next day or two to test things out, check doc and examples for clarity to somebody that may not be as familiar with m-ary trees, and make sure the doc compiles properly. One thing that's more a note to self to fix later when I do this is that enumerated m-ary trees of a given size is still labeled as 'enumerated set of binary trees of a given size' in the code.
