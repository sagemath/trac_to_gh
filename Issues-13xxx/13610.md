#12415 introduces the ability to drop into a Python debugger when an unexpected error is encountered.  I was attempting to have a similar behavior happen when an incorrect result was obtained so that it's easier to figure out what has gone wrong in the doctest.  But problems with interrupt handling were delaying the completion of #12415 (already a patchbomb), so I've stripped out that functionality and put it here.
