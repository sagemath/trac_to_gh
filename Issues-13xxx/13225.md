The issue in hasse_diagram was that taking the dual of the lattice somehow created a situation where the dual poset would attempt to take a join, but joins wouldn't be defined. 

For example, 

```
L = LatticePoset({0:[1,2,3],1:[4],2:[4],3:[4]})
P=L.dual()
x=P.random_element()
y=P.random_element()
P.join(x,y)
```

produces 

```
/Applications/sage-5.3/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/posets/lattices.pyc in join(self, x, y)
    268         """
    269         i, j = map(self._element_to_vertex,(x,y))
--> 270         return self._vertex_to_element(self._hasse_diagram._join[i,j])
    271 
    272 ####################################################################################

AttributeError: 'HasseDiagram' object has no attribute '_join'
```

I must admit I no longer see why the code currently in sage fails to create ` _join ` when it's needed. (I realise I produced the example using 5.3, not 5.4. I don't have 5.4 to hand at the moment.)
