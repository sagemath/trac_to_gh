Path intersection can be detected in a fast way using the algorithm described
in [BKP2011]. The algorithm is based on radix trees.

As of now, the node structure is:

```
#Node structure
cdef struct Node:
    int node_number
    int node_id
    Node* parent
    Node** children
    Node** neighbors
    int* coords
    int visited
```

I believe it could be simplified. For example, I believe `node_id` is unused by the important 4 functions. Also `node_number` and `visited` are used by distinct functions. So, they could be merged into one `int data` which could do both job.

Moreover, I thought the coords were not necessary inside the node as we can find them from the data structure. Hence, a simplified node structure could be :

```
#Node structure
cdef struct Node:
    Node* parent
    Node** children
    Node** neighbors
    int data
```

What do you think?
