Currently when constructing an elliptic curve from a j-invariant over QQ,  a curve with minimal conductor is created (the so-called "minimal twist").  This could be expensive since it involves factoring j and j-1728, so an option to *not* find the minimal twist should be allowed, with the current behaviour as default for backwards compatibility.

For example:

```
sage: EllipticCurve(j=2^256+1)
```
currently triggers factorization of `F_8` (which is quite quick) but also `F_8-1728` (which is not).

 I removed trailing whitespace on lines I edited (or nearby) but not on the whole file as that makes it harder for reviewers to see what has changed.  Of course I could go back and remove the rest.  Does patchbot tell us what tests actually fail?
