This is a doctest error on Solaris SPARC and FreeBSD introduced by #12557:

```
sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/real_double.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "/home/buildbot/build/sage/mark-1/mark_full/build/sage-5.1.beta5/devel/sage-main/sage/rings/real_double.pyx", line 1741:
    sage: all( check_error(x) for x in sxrange(0.01, 2.00, 0.01) )
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
**********************************************************************
```

It turns out that the bug is actually in the `ulp()` method which returns a value which is a factor 2 too small.  Since in all other systems (except Solaris SPARC and FreeBSD) the RDF `log()` method is accurate up to 0.5 ulp for these inputs, the tests for #12557 passed.
