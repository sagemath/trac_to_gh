Hellooooooooo !! Well, this one's good to go, short of an example that can now be written thanks to #13943. Oh, and I also reformatted the list of simplices a bit, so that it matches its description in the paper. Only superfical stuff `:-)`

If you agree with this reviewer's patch, then you can set the ticket to `positive_review`.

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun !
