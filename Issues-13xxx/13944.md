There exists a conjectural triangulation of the projective plane over the ring of quaternions, with 15 vertices and 490 facets. This patch implements that as a simplicial complex.

Apply only [attachment: trac-13944-quaternion-plane-fc.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13944/trac-13944-quaternion-plane-fc.patch.gz).

Hellooooooooo !! Well, this one's good to go, short of an example that can now be written thanks to #13943. Oh, and I also reformatted the list of simplices a bit, so that it matches its description in the paper. Only superfical stuff `:-)`

If you agree with this reviewer's patch, then you can set the ticket to `positive_review`.
