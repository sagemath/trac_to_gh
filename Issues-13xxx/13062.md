Currently Sage will refrain from doctesting a file if the string "nodoctest" is in the first 50 characters.  50 characters is pretty short, and I think it's also good to encourage people to start the line with nodoctest.  So I would propose that we change "somewhere in the first 50 characters" to "one of the first 10 lines starts with '# nodocteset' or '.. nodoctest'".
