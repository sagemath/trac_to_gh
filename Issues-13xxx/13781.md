A common doctest in `polynomial_modn_dense_ntl.pyx` goes something like this:

```
sage: R.<x> = Integers(100)[]                                    
sage: (x + 5) * 3                                                
3*x + 15
```

At some point, I guess, this used to construct a Polynomial_dense_modn_ntl_zz. But now it looks like the default implementation uses flint:

```
sage: R.<x> = Integers(100)[]                                    
sage: type((x + 5) * 3)                                          
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_zmod_flint.Polynomial_zmod_flint'>
```

So a large number of the functions in this file are actually untested, because they're testing the flint implementation instead of the ntl one. It looks like this is the workaround:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(Integers(100), implementation='ntl')
sage: type((x + 5) * 3)                                          
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_modn_dense_ntl.Polynomial_dense_modn_ntl_zz'>
```

<a id='comment:1'></a>For everyone's sanity, depend on the dead code/whitespace cleanup patch.

It appears we can also just pass a huge number to Integers() to force the NTL implementation, but it might be safer to do it explicitly anyway.
