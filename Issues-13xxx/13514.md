On [sage-nt](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en-GB&fromgroups=#!topic/sage-nt/Hj9G0Pr_kLw), it was noted that it would be helpful if the documentation of `representative_vector_list` for quadratic forms mentions the fact that this function is for positive definite quadratic forms only, and that it returns random `PariErrors` otherwise.

    "body": "<a id='comment:10'>Comment 10:</a>\nMore towards bikeshedding, but I don't think it should it be a `TypeError`. I feel more like it should be a `NotImplementedError`, since it is more like a feature that is lacking. Or perhaps a `ValueError` since it is based on the values of the matrix.\n\nHowever, the PARI error that is raised seems fairly descriptive:\n\n```\nsage: R = QuadraticForm(ZZ,2,[-4,-3,0])\nsage: R.representation_vector_list(10)\n...\nPariError: domain error in minim0: form is not positive definite\n```\nThus, I'm not completely convinced about doing a check on the Sage side, which seems to be done on the PARI side too.\n\nAlso, changing the error type might break some code. Although the chances of this are unlikely, so that is a very weak argument.",

More towards bikeshedding, but I don't think it should it be a `TypeError`. I feel more like it should be a `NotImplementedError`, since it is more like a feature that is lacking. Or perhaps a `ValueError` since it is based on the values of the matrix.

However, the PARI error that is raised seems fairly descriptive:

```
sage: R = QuadraticForm(ZZ,2,[-4,-3,0])
sage: R.representation_vector_list(10)
...
PariError: domain error in minim0: form is not positive definite
```
Thus, I'm not completely convinced about doing a check on the Sage side, which seems to be done on the PARI side too.

Also, changing the error type might break some code. Although the chances of this are unlikely, so that is a very weak argument.
