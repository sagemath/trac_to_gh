I am using the notebook to print lines of data.  I changed the data, reprinted the output.  The truncated outlook is refreshed, but the hyperlink to the full_output.txt.  When I erase the text in the cell and clear it, maybe even remove the cell, the full_output.txt file is refreshed.  I'm running 5.3 on xubuntu.
