Intersection graphs are generated by a representations of geometric objects like intervals, parallelograms, etc. Unlike graphs listed under "Families of Graphs" in graph_generators.py, these graphs do not depend on just a few integer parameters. Hence, we create a new section "Intersection Graphs". Example classes of intersection graphs are interval graphs and permutation graphs (already implemented) as well as tolerance graphs or trapezoid graphs.

A tolerance graph is generated by a tolerance representation. And a *tolerance representation* can be described by a list `((l_0,r_0,t_0), (l_1,r_1,t_1), ..., (l_k,r_k,t_k))` where `I_i = (l_i,r_i)` denotes a closed interval on the real line and `t_i` a positive value, called tolerance. This representation generates the *tolerance graph* with the vertex set {0, 1, ..., k} and the edge set

`{(i, j): |I_i \cap I_j| >= min{t_i, t_j} }`

where ``|I_i \cap I_j|`` denotes the length of the intersection of `I_i` and `I_j`.

---

For easier review, our patch is divided into parts.

Part 1 (...-1_intersection_graphs.patch):
- Creating section "Intersection Graphs"
- Moving of functions `IntervalGraph`, `PermutationGraph` into this section

Part 2 (...-1a_corrections.patch)

- Typo in documentation of function PermutationGraph
- Speed improvement of function IntervalGraph
- Renaming `RandomInterval()` to `RandomIntervalGraph()`

Part 3 (...-2_tolerance_graphs.patch):

- Adding method `ToleranceGraph` which generates the tolerance graph for a given tolerance representation
- Adding methods to generate random (bounded) tolerance graphs

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
Hello,

so far I'm unable to install the patch since my installation of 5.2.rc0 is not finished.

However, I have small remarks:
- use xrange instead of range
- it is usually faster to add edges directly (see example bellow)
- is the instruction graph.Graph(n) correct?

```
sage: def toto(n):
....:     G = Graph()
....:     for i in xrange(n):
....:         for j in xrange(i+1,n):
....:             G.add_edge(i,j)
....:     return G
....: 
sage: def titi(n):
....:     G = Graph()
....:     E = []
....:     for i in xrange(n):
....:         for j in xrange(i+1,n):
....:             E.append((i,j))
....:     G.add_edges(E)
....:     return G
....: 
sage: %timeit toto(10)
625 loops, best of 3: 406 µs per loop
sage: %timeit titi(10)
625 loops, best of 3: 674 µs per loop
sage: %timeit toto(20)
625 loops, best of 3: 1.45 ms per loop
sage: %timeit titi(20)
125 loops, best of 3: 2.58 ms per loop
```

So for the *IntervalGraph* function, I would prefer:

```
n = len(intervals)
g = Graph(n)

for i in xrange(n-1):
    minI, maxI = sorted(intervals[i])
    for j in xrange(i+1,n):
        minJ, maxJ = sorted(intervals[j])
        if maxI < minJ or maxJ < minI: continue
        g.add_edge(i,j)

rep = dict( zip(range(n),intervals) ) 
g.set_vertices(rep) 

return g 
```

The same should be done in the ToleranceGraph function.

With a fresh install of 5.2.rc0: install OK, long tests OK, docbuild OK.
I think the functions are working correctly.

While implementing running time improvements proposed above, you could also implement a RandomIntervalGraph function. That would be useful.

I think it is. But because of the inclusion `from sage.graphs.graph import Graph`
at the beginning of the file it is easier to write `Graph(n)`.

Originally, `max(I)` and `min(J)` were calculated, but `max(J)` and `min(I)` only in some case. Your solution will calculate all four values (maybe faster) but probably create a new tuple.

The following test shows that regarding the endpoint ordering the original version
is slightly faster. So I left this as it was...

```

    n = len(intervals)
    g = Graph(n)
    for i in xrange(n-1):
        minI, maxI = sorted(intervals[i])
        for j in xrange(i+1,n):
            minJ, maxJ = sorted(intervals[j])
            if maxI < minJ or maxJ < minI: continue
            g.add_edge(i,j)
    return g
def oldconstr(intervals):
    n = len(intervals)
    g = Graph(n)
    for i in xrange(n-1):
        I = intervals[i]
        for j in xrange(i+1,n):
            J = intervals[j]
            if max(I) < min(J) or max(J) < min(I): continue
            g.add_edge(i,j)
    return g

I1 = [tuple(sorted((random(), random()))) for i in range(14)]

Furthermore, I have added a parameter that can switch off the sorting of the
interval endpoints. This speeds up the creation of an interval graph by 25% in average.

Done.

> While implementing running time improvements proposed above, you could also implement a RandomIntervalGraph? function. That would be useful. 

This functionality already exists. It is not really obvious that the function "RandomInterval" produces a graph and not an interval. Hence, should I rename "RandomInterval" to "RandomIntervalGraph" and desprecate "RandomInterval"? One might object that the name becomes too long but at least two persons find it better to read... ;-)

Thanks!
