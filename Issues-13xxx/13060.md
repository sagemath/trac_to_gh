Valgrind 3.7.0 configure script complains about glibc version 2.15 (which is shipped e.g. with Ubuntu 12.04).

The usual solution is to treat this version as the previous one:
see commit r12323 in the valgrind svn, or tickets on different distribution bug tracker.

Furthermore, the autogen.sh scripts fails with recent automake version.
This is commit r12396.

All these fixes are in Valgrind 3.8.1.

Try spkg at
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/spkg/valgrind-3.8.1.p0.spkg

Support is announced upstream for OS X from 10.6.X onward, but building Valgrind might fail if you're using a non Apple gcc (such as the FSF one in Sage's spkg).

**CC:**  @gvol jpflori @haraldschilly

**Keywords:** valgrind spkg

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.

After applying the diff of the above commit, one has to rebuild the configure scripts with autogen.sh (which is available in the svn, not in the usual tarballs).
This basically calls auto* stuff, but the current input *.am files are incompatible with the current automake tool...

Here comes a slightly updated spkg:
http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/sage/valgrind-3.7.0.p0.spkg

I've applied the two mentioned patches and rerun autogen.sh to regenerate the build system files.
The package installs and seems functional with my Sage installation.

Another solution whould be to properly package a recent valgrind svn version, although I'd prefer to use this light solution and wait for a proper stable release to make a real update to valgrind.
Feel free to disagree and rant here.

Installing the debug version of libc6 (libc6-dbg) on my Ubuntu installation solves both the startup problem.
Nonetheless, it might be useful to actually print something when valgrind fails for this reason.
Currently running "sage -valgrind" exits without complaining although tunning directly valgrind from the local/bin folder provides some hints.

On a debian installation on top of recent hardware (corei7-avx) I'm able to install the old spkg (debian currently ships eglibc 2.13), but get a SIGILL when launching sage, which comes as no surprise:
https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=273475

The latest svn version is enough to let sage starts.


On the same install, the test suite with the old spkg yields

```
## 599 tests, 77 stderr failures, 56 stdout failures, 0 stderrB failures, 1 stdoutB failure, 3 post failures
```
the one proposed here yields

```
## 599 tests, 77 stderr failures, 56 stdout failures, 0 stderrB failures, 1 stdo
utB failure, 3 post failures ==
```
which was expected.
With the latest svn version (you can test it by replace p0 by jp in the above url):

```
## 545 tests, 4 stderr failures, 0 stdout failures, 0 stderrB failures, 1 stdo
utB failure, 0 post failures ==
```


On the ubuntu install mentioned above, with the 

```
## 591 tests, 79 stderr failures, 57 stdout failures, 0 stderrB failures, 0 stdo
utB failure, 3 post failures ==
```
and with the latest svn version

```
## 534 tests, 4 stderr failures, 1 stdout failures, 0 stderrB failures, 1 stdo
utB failure, 0 post failures ==
```

Whatsoever, I'm not sure that the problem of dealing with avx instructions should be dealt with here.
We surely should wait for a proper release by the valgrind team, the tested development version is completely arbitrary.

About the test suite failure, I'm not convinced it should prevent including the updated p0 spkg proposed here, if they were present before.
I must admit I do not remember seeing errors when dealing with #7766, but we potentially forgot to run the testsuite all along.

If we expect these failures to be fixed, I can definitely not take care of this with my little knowledge of valgrind.

I know I ran the test suite last time at least once, but I think I saw a few failures on my Mac.  Now trying to install it on Sage 5.0 neither will even build.  I should have thought to build it when I was testing the betas.  The old spkg gives 

```

```

So it looks like the former is a problem with the new gcc package:

```
sage -sh -c 'which gcc'
/Users/gvol/SageStuff/sage-5.0.rc0/local/bin/gcc
```

And the spkg for review here gives.

```

configure: error: cannot run /bin/sh ./config.sub

```

Here `config.sub` is a symlink to `/usr/share/automake-1.11/config.sub`.  
This probably has something to do with you running `./autogen.sh`, but I'm not an expert in how to fix that.  If I run `./autgen.sh` myself then it configures fine but runs into the `-arch` problem as before.

Oh, I didn't realize that...
I've uploaded a new spkg obtained with autoreconf -fi rather than autogen.sh which has no symlinks.

I'll look into the arch stuff but have no apple stuff to test it.

Cool, thanks.  I just tried it (in the same place) and got the same error though.  Perhaps, it's in a different place?

I think if you can force sage to use the gcc spkg it would exhibit the same problem, unless you are already using it.  What does `sage -sh -c 'which gcc'` return?

It might be worth asking Jeroen (or on sage-devel) since he knows it a lot better.

The spkg is up now, I was a little slow to upload it.

About the gcc -arch problem, I think the problem is with Valgrind configure script which adds this flag as soon as it detects that its run on OSX because it assumes that someone on OSX will be using an Apple gcc.
That's the reason why I get no problem on Linux with the FSF gcc, the Ubuntu one or the Sage one.

No problem.  It works now—except for actually building.  :-)

Ah, now I see it.  I guess we'll have to patch that, or ask them to do it upstream.  

Fink simply disabled mpicc http://fink.cvs.sourceforge.net/fink/dists/10.7/stable/main/finkinfo/devel/valgrind.info?view=markup which was the FSF compiler rather than gcc.

I've included some autotools magic to test if the -arch i386/x86_64 flag is supported and fall back to the -m32/64.
Could you test the updated spkg at the same address as usual (at least the spkg still build on my linux)?

I've put the diffs into the patches directory (although they are already applied because we have to run autoreconf) and will upload them here for review purpose.

 Furthermore, the autogen.sh scripts fails with recent automake version.

New spkg including 3.8.1 at
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/valgrind-3.8.1.spkg

Upstream claim to support OSX from 10.6.X onward (10.8.x being currently limited).
We used to claim from 10.5.x onward.
Could some Apple user check that?

Not sure if you can now build it with FSF GCC (such as the one shipped by Sage's spkg.
Could someone test that as well?

At least this spkg runs correctly on recent Linuxes with GLIBC 2.15 and supports AVX instructions.

Note: see also the FAQ in the source distribution.
It contains workarounds to several common problems.
In particular, if Valgrind aborted or crashed after
identifying problems in your program, there's a good chance
that fixing those problems will prevent Valgrind aborting or
crashing, especially if it happened in m_mallocfree.c.

If that doesn't help, please report this bug to: www.valgrind.org

In the bug report, send all the above text, the valgrind
version, and what OS and version you are using.  Thanks.
```

For the record, the exact way that I made the "fixes" was to add 

```
perl -pi.bak -e 's/[-]arch x86_64/\@FLAG_M64@/;' -e 's/[-]arch i386/\@FLAG_M32@/' configure.in Makefile.all.am
./autogen.sh
export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -D__private_extern__=extern"
```
to `spkg-install` just before calling configure.  I don't suggest this method of "fixing" it.

Perhaps we should ask the maintainers of valgrind the best way to proceed.

I think the best way to proceed is unfortunately to use Apple's GCC.
Valgrind build system seems completely thought for it...
That would mean an additional check in spkg-install and would be much easier than fixing upstream build system to work with an FSF GCC.
