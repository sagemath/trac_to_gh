The bug was found by Geoff Tims. It has been introduced in #12791, exactly as already spotted in #13091.

After loops and multiple edges, I begin to hate directed graphs now.

I *HATE* to see Sage return wrong answers. HATE it.

Sorry about that. It means that the doctests were not sufficient to identify the error.

The patch is working, passes all tests, and the documentation is correctly build.
However, could you add an extra doctest to check that strong product is the union of tensor and cartesian products. This is working correctly with this patch but not without this patch.


Something else: I'm pretty sure that this part http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/12791/trac_12791-edge-iterator.patch of patch #12791 has not been included in Sage since most of the graph product functions are without iterators. Don't know what to do.

The third patch from #12791, which hasnot been merged into Sage, could not be applied anymore after this patch. I just rebased it on top of this ticket and added after trac_13699.patch.
