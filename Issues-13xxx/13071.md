Something seems to be going wrong in maxima_lib:

```

-cos(x)
sage: integrate(sin(x)*exp(x), x)
1/2*(sin(x) - cos(x))*e^x

This happens in 5.0 and beyond.  Unfortunately I don't have a 4.8 at hand so I can't track it down before that.

Strangely enough, if you do it again, you get a different error:

```

    745                 raise ValueError, "Computation failed since Maxima requested additional constraints; using the 'assume' command before integral evaluation *may* help (example of legal syntax is 'assume(" + s[4:k] +">0)', see `assume?` for more details)\n" + s
    746             else:
--> 747                 raise error
    748 
    749     def sr_sum(self,*args):

RuntimeError: ECL says: Error executing code in Maxima: conjugate: wrong number of arguments.

```

So -- and this might be independent -- something's stateful which probably shouldn't be.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

Yep, sage is trying to learn how to translate "conjugate" and gets tripped up. The following does work because it primes the dictionary.

```
sage: integrate(conjugate(Ei((I+1)*x)),x)
integrate(-conjugate(Ei(-(I + 1)*x)), x)
sage: integrate(sin(x)*exp(x)/x, x)
-1/4*I*conjugate(Ei(-(I - 1)*x)) + 1/4*I*conjugate(Ei((I + 1)*x)) + 1/4*I*Ei(-(I - 1)*x) - 1/4*I*Ei((I + 1)*x)
```
The problem is that sage tries to learn what conjugate is from this expression:

```
sage: expr=maxima("conjugate(gamma_incomplete(0,(-%i-1)*x))")
conjugate(gamma_incomplete(0,(-%i-1)*x))
```
but its conversion to SR pulls out a minus sign:

```
sage: SR(expr)
-conjugate(Ei((I + 1)*x))
```
so in [max_to_sr line 1530](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/9ab4ab6e12d0/sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py#l1530) text-based fallback we find that the corresponding operator is:

```
sage: SR(expr).operator()
<built-in function mul>
```
Once conversion of multiplication is broken, we of course get all kinds garbage. A warning for exactly this problem is in the source.

Work-around for this particular issue: Prepopulate [sage_op_dict](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/9ab4ab6e12d0/sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py#l1050) with conjugate

A better solution would be to once and for all solve this problem by initializing sage_op_dict from the same source where the text-based interface gets its knowledge from.
