Just look at the output of this command

```
list_plot(range(3), plotjoined=True, marker='o', legend_label='square here, circle there')
```
The marker in the legend should be a `o` but it is actually printed as a square. This seems to be a bug in Sage because I couldn't reproduce it in matplotlib. I tried the following two variants:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(range(3), range(3), '-o')
plt.legend('square here')
plt.savefig('a.png')
```

```
import matplotlib.lines as lines
from matplotlib.figure import Figure

options = {'marker': 'o'}
p = lines.Line2D(range(3), range(3), **options)
p.set_label('square here, circle there')
figure=Figure()
subplot = figure.add_subplot(111)
subplot.add_line(p)
subplot.legend()
from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg
figure.set_canvas(FigureCanvasAgg(figure))
figure.savefig('a.png')
```

The bug dates back to at least sage-4.7. That's the oldest precompiled version of sage I had around here.
