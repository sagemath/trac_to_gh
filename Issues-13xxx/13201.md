Well no you don't have to run it every time sage starts, just every time a package using setuptools is installed, since setuptools always inscribes the absolute path into easy-install.pth (even if you specify a relative path for `--egg-path`).

At this point I'd like to point you to SPKG.txt and actually read it:

```
# setuptools

## Description

setuptools is a collection of enhancements to the Python distutils (for Python 2.3.5 and up on mo
st platforms; 64-bit platforms require a minimum of Python 2.4) that allow you to more easily bui
ld and distribute Python packages, especially ones that have dependencies on other packages.

Website: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/

The present spkg is based on the fork of setuptools known as distribute.
Website: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute
```
And

```
### setuptools-0.6.16 (Francois Bissey, June 1, 2011)
 * Switch to the "distribute" fork of setuptools and update to 0.6.16, 
 * adopt a Gentoo patch to avoid warnings with python-2.7 (works with 2.6 too). 
 * Remove the two windows binaries and patch so setup.py doesn't
   try to install them.
```
This was a pre-requisite to the upgrade to python-2.7.3. Fell free to upgrade to a newer version of distribute and change the name if you want too.
