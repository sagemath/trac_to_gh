Currently we have to force the spkgs that use setuptools to build serially because setuptools does not do any file locking with `easy_install.pth`. This is an inconvenience that has a fairly straightforward fix.

I unfortuntely don't understand `setuptools` well enough to review this.  It seems there are some changes unrelated to the locking.  What do they do?

Also, do we really need to do this *every time* Sage runs (could it be moved to `sage-location`?):

```
    # Hack around setuptools since --egg-path isn't fully respected 
    sed -i 's-.*sagenb.*-\.\./\.\./\.\./\.\./devel/sagenb-' \ 
        "$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python/site-packages/easy-install.pth" 
```
You also need to handle the case that `$SAGE_ROOT` isn't writeable.

Well no you don't have to run it every time sage starts, just every time a package using setuptools is installed, since setuptools always inscribes the absolute path into easy-install.pth (even if you specify a relative path for `--egg-path`).

Absolutely. I 100% think that sagenb should be installed like any other python package, i.e. in the site packages directory.

At this point I'd like to point you to SPKG.txt and actually read it:

```
# setuptools

## Description

setuptools is a collection of enhancements to the Python distutils (for Python 2.3.5 and up on mo
st platforms; 64-bit platforms require a minimum of Python 2.4) that allow you to more easily bui
ld and distribute Python packages, especially ones that have dependencies on other packages.

Website: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/

The present spkg is based on the fork of setuptools known as distribute.
Website: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute
```
And

```
### setuptools-0.6.16 (Francois Bissey, June 1, 2011)
 * Switch to the "distribute" fork of setuptools and update to 0.6.16, 
 * adopt a Gentoo patch to avoid warnings with python-2.7 (works with 2.6 too). 
 * Remove the two windows binaries and patch so setup.py doesn't
   try to install them.
```
This was a pre-requisite to the upgrade to python-2.7.3. Fell free to upgrade to a newer version of distribute and change the name if you want too.
