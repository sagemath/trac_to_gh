My guess is that one can check whether the input is empty, dealing with that special case separately. Alternatively, if empty columns are acceptable, the assertion should be `nr_columns >= 0` rather than `nr_columns > 0`.

The problem occurs in the add_rows method, if no rows are given: we would then have an uninitialised vector_vector_int that is used in some c-level function - and this is asking for trouble.

My suggestion: If the input is empty, then return before using the uninitialized value.

With your change the following in combinat/tiling.py will have to be changed

```
    def is_suitable(self):
        r"""
        Return whether the volume of the box is equal to sum of the volume
        of the polyominoes and the number of rows sent to the DLX solver is
        larger than zero.

        If these conditions are not verified, then the problem is not suitable
        in the sense that there are no solution.

        .. NOTE::

            The DLX solver throws a Segmentation Fault when the
            number of rows is zero::

                sage: from sage.combinat.matrices.dancing_links import dlx_solver
                sage: rows = []
                sage: x = dlx_solver(rows)
                sage: x.search()        # not tested
                BOOM !!!

Apologies! When I saw your patch I became convinced it would do something for this. To the point of obsession only once, I posted (and gone to bed) did it occur to me that  it wouldn't. I'll do one or two extra tests and give this ticket a positive review later today.
