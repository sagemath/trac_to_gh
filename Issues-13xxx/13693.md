<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

I'm trying this out. A few quick comments:

- In SPKG.txt, the line `=== matplotlib-1.1.0 (Jason Grout, 09 Nov 2012) ===` should say `1.2.0`.
- The file `patches/mkdir-race-condition.patch` should be removed from the repository (according to `hg status`, the repo is not clean right now).
- I'm getting doctest failures in the plot directory:

```
The following tests failed:

	sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/plot/colors.py # 8 doctests failed
	sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/plot/graphics.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/plot/plot.py # 2 doctests failed
	sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/plot/plot3d/plot_field3d.py # 1 doctests failed
```
 The ones in colors.py are all of the form

```
    sage: get_cmap('jet')
Expected:
    <matplotlib.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap instance at 0x...>
Got:
    <matplotlib.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap object at 0x11103e8d0>
```
 and the ones in graphics.py are similar. These are easy to fix, of course. Other failures:

```

Regarding the failures: I can easily fix all of them except the ones in plot.py:

```
        sage: q1 = plot([sin(x), tan(x)], legend_label='trig')
        sage: len(q1.matplotlib().axes[0].legend().texts) # used to raise AttributeError
        1

    ::

    Make sure that we don't get multiple legend labels for plot segments
    (:trac:`11998`)::

        sage: p1 = plot(1/(x^2-1),(x,-2,2),legend_label="foo",detect_poles=True)
        sage: len(p1.matplotlib().axes[0].legend().texts)
        1
```
For the first one (`q1`), with the new spkg there are two legend labels ("trig" and "None"), where there used to be just one. For `p1`, there are now three labels, in direct contradiction of the text. It looks like the picture at #11998, except the labels are "None", "None", and "foo". I don't know how to fix these. See my patch for the other fixes.
