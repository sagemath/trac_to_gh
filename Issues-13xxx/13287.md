Currently only `CC` and `CXX` get modified (in `spkg/bin/sage-env`) if Sage's GCC spkg is installed (more precisely, if `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/{gcc,g++}` are present).

We should also set / override `CPP` and (at least) also various commonly-used Fortran compiler variables to make sure the versions from *Sage's* GCC installation get used, since the user may have specified these, and the build might break (due to mixing different compiler versions).  (As an example, building ECL currently fails if `$CPP` finds `ffi.h` although it is not really installed system-wide, but rather only in e.g. `/usr/lib/<ARCH>/<$CPP's version>/include/`; see [comment:ticket:13150:5] ff.)

Not sure whether we have to (or should) handle `OBJC`, `OBJCXX` etc. as well.

Although compilers for further languages may get built and installed by the GCC spkg, these aren't used by Sage or its components, at least -- AFAIK -- not currently (with the exception of R using an Objective C compiler, but on MacOS X only).

Hmmm.  If it's not already defined, exporting it has no effect.  It may be (defined and) empty, but in that case it originates from the "global" environment, i.e., has been set to `""` (and already exported) by the user, which is certainly wrong.   

Any reason it doesn't get a default value if it's not already set in `sage-env` (like `CC`, but also `AR`, `RANLIB` etc.)?

I could either add the latter, or maybe only export `CPP` if we set it there (`if [ -x ... ]`).


The whole thing looks a bit inconsistent, but spkgs may rely on the other variables being defined, so I'd prefer to also let `CPP` always have a value.
