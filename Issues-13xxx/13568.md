<a id='comment:20'></a>I started reviewing it, and made some changes. Some are to make it more pythonic, some are for clarity.

I've set it to needs_work because the patch fails when using quaternion algebras not defined over number fields:

```
sage: A.<i,j,k> = QuaternionAlgebra(ZZ['x'].fraction_field(),-1,-1)
sage: A.quaternion_order([1,i,j,k])                                
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
UnboundLocalError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
...
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'M1' referenced before assignment
```
