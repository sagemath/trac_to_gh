# autotools

## Description

This package contains a recent version of GNU m4 and help2man.
It contains the git repository of autoconf, automake and libtool.

For the latter 3 packages (commonly referred to as "autotools"),
many different versions are installed, by checking out the versions
from the git repo and building/installing them separately. Since the
complete git repository is shipped in the spkg, this does not require
internet access.

For m4 and help2man, just one version is installed. This is because
they are prerequisites for autotools. Even though m4 is already a
prerequisite of Sage, autoconf requires an up-to-date version of GNU m4.

The package makes wrapper scripts in $SAGE_LOCAL/bin for the various
autotools, which call the "correct" version. This means that, if a file
"configure" already exists in the current directory, the same autoconf
version is run which created the original file. Otherwise, the latest
version is run. The goal of all this is to make it easier to patch
configure.ac or Makefile.am files inside a spkg. By using the same
version of autotools as originally used, the patch files should be
relatively small.

## Special !Update/Build Instructions

This package has only been tested on GNU/Linux systems and will likely
fail to build on other systems. Since this package is only intended for
package developers, that should not be a big problem.

The file spkg-src can be used to automatically create or update the git
repositories.

## Changelog

### autotools-20120810 (Jeroen Demeyer, 10 August 2012)

* Initial release, contains m4-1.4.16, help2man-1.40.11 and git
  sources for autoconf, automake and libtool.

Why did you go for a git snapshot for auto{conf,make} and libtool? I understand that automake is in transition (some commands are removed and so on). I understand that you want something that will last a bit but you could still have gone for real releases.

I understand now. Rather than shipping the usual spkg way you pull from git for every versions you want to install. It is fairly involved but it is an experimental spkg. I am not sure keeping all the versions in question is necessary (but I am familiar with the goal).

I cannot see any obvious problems with this definitely non-obvious spkg. It should be made clear that this spkg requires internet access unlike standard spkg.

It doesn't require internet access, the full git tree is shipped with the spkg.
