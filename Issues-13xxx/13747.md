As mentionned in the following discussions :
* http://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-devel/qQzzZEh-JRo/WxU_qyxH2igJ
* http://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-combinat-devel/bfWbG54sedM/discussion (sage-combinat fork of the discussion)
* https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/xQxQLkm-RUU/discussion

This patch changes the default behaviour of the Poset constructor to facade = True, so that the elements that you define the Poset with are the elements it contains.

Two comments about this ticket :
* While the documentation of the poset/ files say that `facade` is a boolean, it is not. Its former default value is actually `None`, and the code itself tests several times `if facade is None`. No idea why. All I know is that I first tried to make it really boolean, and to replace those `None` tests by `if not facade`, but I was not able to make all tests pass without any idea why. I added a warning about this in the file's header, and the doctests based on the former versions of Posets are now defined with a `facade = None` flag. Even though it should be a boolean. Well, if this wasn't a problem before, no reason why it should become one now. This clearly has to be fixed too.
* There is a `Poset.linear_extensions` method whose default behaviour is also `facade = None`. Despite taking an optional flag, this method *DOES NOT WORK* as it is clearly indicated in its docstring. One can easily wonder what the hell this function is doing in Sage's code. Hence this function's behaviour is left untouched. It will use `facade=None` by default until it is rewritten correctly, or removed.

facade=None just means that the facade option is *not* specified at this stage. The default value will be decided at a lower level, or from the context.

Hey Nicolas, when you DO WRITE in the documentation that a thing is binary, make it binary. Else, you HAVE TO explain what None means. What you have in your head when you look at code stays in your head. What am I guilty of in this case ? Not guessing what you intended ? There are PROBLEMS with the combinat documentation, and each time a stupid guy like me is wasting his week-end and going to sleep at 4am in order to fix your bugs and write your documentation (and bear in mind that it is precisely what is happening right now), this mess is improving a bit.

Hello Nathann,

a few remarks from my side:

* Yes, the doc is better :-)

* I still don't feel very comfortable with the following facade doc: " the `facade` variable will be set to `True` or `False` by a lower-level call, or depending on the context." Depending on what context? I believe the doc should clearly state what influence a certain parameter has.

* In the examples you sometimes changed the former default facade value (i.e. facade = None) to facade = False, in other examples you left the coding as it was so the examples work with the new defualt value facade = True. (See 1st and 2nd example of Posets(...)). Not sure whether this was done on purpose of forgotten

* I think there is one "`" to much in the Output doc of the constructor (class FinitePoset)

Cheers

Christian

Cool `:-D`

Ahem. I believe so, too... But from the comments on this ticket you can see that I just said there what Nicolas gave me to chew.

Oh. Yeah, easy. Many explanations usually : as the new default is `facade = True`, I felt like this should be heavily tested in the docstrings. So when a docstring did not fail after that change, I left it like that. If it worked by changing it to `facade = False`, I was happy.

Hello Nathann,

I only had the time to run a few tests up to now:

These are the failures:

Looks like I finally found my way through this chaos ! `:-D`

The only problems actually came from a couple of files, and everything was solved once this was fixed. I still have a problem with a couple of doctests in geometry/cone.py, and ask for some help on sage-devel.

Hello Nathann,

as far as I can judge there are no more issues with this patch:

* All test passed successfully
* The doc look ok
* The methods are behaving as promised in the doc (default behavior with facade = True etc)

BTW, the explanation for the facade = True / False / None bevavior is much clearer than in your first version ;-)

Just be clear about the extension of my review: I focused ONLY on the changes you made. IMHO there is still room for improvment in this module, as you stated earlier. ;-)

Good work!

Christian

You're not in the right frame of mind to appreciate such a change. Here is a quote from the Wikipedia Page on monochrome paintings (it actually talks about things like that : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Black_square.jpg)

Suprematism and Constructivism

Monochrome painting as it is usually understood today began in Moscow, with Suprematist Composition: White on White [5] of 1918 by Suprematist artist Kazimir Malevich. This was a variation on or sequel to his 1915 work “Black Square on a White Field”, a very important work in its own right to 20th century geometric abstraction.
In 1921, Constructivist artist Alexandr Rodchenko exhibited three paintings together, each a monochrome of one of the three primary colours. He intended this work to represent The Death of Painting.[6]

While Rodchenko intended his monochrome to be a dismantling of the typical assumptions of painting, Malevich saw his work as a concentration on them, a kind of meditation on art’s essence (“pure feeling”).

These two approaches articulated very early on in its history this kind of work’s almost paradoxical dynamic: that one can read a monochrome either as a flat surface (material entity or “painting as object”) which represents nothing but itself, and therefore representing an ending in the evolution of illusionism in painting (i.e. Rodchenko); or as a depiction of multidimensional (infinite) space, a fulfillment of illusionistic painting, representing a new evolution—a new beginning—in Western painting’s history (Malevich). Additionally, many have pointed out that it may be difficult to deduce the artist’s intentions from the painting itself, without referring to the artist’s comment.

So of course, f=f could seem a bit trivial and useless to you. You may even think that you could have done it by yourself. But the truth is that there is a depth behind that you just cannot appreciate.

I removed it from the new version of my patch, because I don't get it either.

Totally. I love change. I first intended to replace "agree" by $#$aaaagrRRrrrrrrrrreeeeeee$#$ but hesitated when I considered the extravagant cost of the characters.
This, and because emacs seems to have trouble with the " in the docstring, and for this reason believed that in the rest of the file comments were code, and code comments...
Do you mind ? `^^;`

Of course here I have to make the same remark as previously. There is depth in `(e for e in level)`, a depth that is not reached by the expression `iter(level)`. I changed it anyway, there and at all other places where it was needed.

Sorry for all that. It's just that I changed these files sooooooooooooo many times that I was a bit too excited when it passed all doctests. Thank you for looking at it.

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun !

P.S. : By the way, if only to relieve you of a legitimate fear if you thought that all this was done without me looking : I indeed did most of these changes with emacs macros, but each time something was about to be changed in the code emacs asked me whether I agreed with the change (he's that kind).
