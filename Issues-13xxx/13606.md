When working with matrices, the commutator is a useful feature. However, the anticommutator is handy when one is working with representations of, say, Clifford algebras.

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
I'd like to review this ticket. Here are my comments: 

1. Please fix the docstring: we need "anticommutator" and NOT "commutator". I'd be glad if you rewrote the docstring along the lines of: 

```
"""
Return the anticommutator of ``self`` and ``other``. 

The anticommutator of two square matrices `A` and `B` of same 
dimension is defined to be `AB + BA`. 

EXAMPLES::


"""
```
2. Perhaps, we could add atleast one more example, like the trace of anticommutator. May be, also, how the product AB is related to commutator and anticommutator of A and B. But, this is just my feeling. 

Other than these, the patch looks great! :)
