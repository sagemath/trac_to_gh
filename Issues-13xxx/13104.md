<div id="comment:0"></div>

This is in contradiction with other functions (BooleanPolynomial.nvariables), and with the behavior of the "normal" class MPolynomial.

Example:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = BooleanPolynomialRing()
sage: p = R(1)
sage: p.variables()
(1,)
sage: p.nvariables()
0
```
Which differs from:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = GF(2)[]
sage: p = R(1)
sage: p.variables()
()
sage: p.nvariables()
0
```

Hi,

I actually did, in fact. I modified the existing docstring to verify that:

```
sage: P.one_element().variables()  
()
```
Should I add anything else?
