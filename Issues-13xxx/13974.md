The docstrings containing some math in them display oddly. The math is typeset, but enclosed by red \( and \). A way to reproduce this bug:

1. pick any class that contains some mathematical symbols in its docstring (e.g. IntegerMatrices (of the combinat class), fibonacci).

2. View the class description by saying `<classname>?`.

Fixed by #13717.

I'm not sure that I agree with the "blocker" status. I think blockers should really be bugs which prevent somebody from using Sage at all. That being said, if somebody can come up with a small patch fixing this, I don't mind making a sage-5.6.rc2.
