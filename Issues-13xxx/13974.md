The docstrings containing some math in them display oddly. The math is typeset, but enclosed by red \( and \). A way to reproduce this bug:

1. pick any class that contains some mathematical symbols in its docstring (e.g. IntegerMatrices (of the combinat class), fibonacci).

2. View the class description by saying `<classname>?`.

Fixed by #13717.
