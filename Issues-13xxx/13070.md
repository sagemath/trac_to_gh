From [this stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10775775/the-bug-in-sage-math-notebook-when-using-r) and [this ask.sagemath post](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1400/may-there-is-a-bug-in-notebook), the same question:

```
I know that when calls R with Sage,the dot will convert to underscores.
But even when I set the "system" to R with combo box above in notebook,
the dot will convert to underscores, and that is the problem. 
Is there any solution?
```

This is now [Github issue 103](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/issues/103).  Note that I'm not sure whether this is in Sage or sagenb, though sagenb seems plausible.
