Different plot commands have different arguments or keywords for achieving the same final effect. This is very confusing.

This ticket aims to go through the plot functions one by one and fix the arguments so that the Sage interface remains consistent and uniform across all the plot commands irrespective of the underlying plotting method used (currently matplotlib).

It is conceivable that the changes could be extensive (there are many plot functions) - then the changes can be broken up into other tickets and added to the "Dependencies" of this one.

Depends on #8570

Depends on #13830

Depends on #13834

Depends on #13576

Depends on #15002

Depends on #10032

Is there an example of this? Also, how should we determine what keywords should be used as the standard ones?

 Somewhere in this set of related tickets we should also unify the usage of
 `figsize` between graphics objects and graphics arrays.  Maybe graphics
 arrays need to be a separate file eventually..
