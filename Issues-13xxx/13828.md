Different plot commands have different arguments or keywords for achieving the same final effect. This is very confusing.

This ticket aims to go through the plot functions one by one and fix the arguments so that the Sage interface remains consistent and uniform across all the plot commands irrespective of the underlying plotting method used (currently matplotlib).

It is conceivable that the changes could be extensive (there are many plot functions) - then the changes can be broken up into other tickets and added to the "Dependencies" of this one.
