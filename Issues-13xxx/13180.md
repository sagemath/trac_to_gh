Finite fields are not ordered fields. But of course cmp can still be applied to them. It would be nice to have a consistent way of comparison of elements in different rings. In most cases, one gets the same answers:

```
sage: K = GF(2)        
sage: K(0) < K(1)
True
sage: K = GF(4,'z')      
sage: K(0) < K(1)  
True
sage: K(0) < K('z')
True
sage: K = GF(3)   
sage: K(0) < K(1) 
True
sage: K(0) < K(-1)
True
sage: K = GF(9,'z')
sage: K(0) < K(1)  
True
sage: K(0) < K(-1) 
True
sage: K(0) < K('z')
True
sage: K = GF(3^100,'z')
sage: K(0) < K(1)      
True
sage: K(0) < K(-1)     
True
sage: K(0) < K('z')    
True
```
But alas:

```
sage: K = GF(2^100,'z')
sage: K(0) < K(1)      
False
sage: K(0) < K('z')     
False
```

I suggest to make big finite fields of characteristic 2 behave like the other fields.

You need to indent the examples you added. Could you limit the line length of the ..note part to maximal 80 characters.

I think we do, see

* [PEP-0008 maximum line length](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length)
