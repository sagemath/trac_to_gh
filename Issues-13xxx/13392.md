See [this sage-devel post by William](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.devel/54802/). Remove the following SPKGs:

* python_gnutls
* gnutls
* opencdk
* libgcrypt
* libgpg_error

Furthermore, as I understand it, our switching to OpenSSL had already made GNUTLS useless in Sage when we started shipping the Flask notebook (Sage 5.2), so we can get rid of GNUTLS and related SPKGs at the same time.

See also #13385.
