See [this sage-devel post by William](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.devel/54802/). Remove the following SPKGs:

* python_gnutls
* gnutls
* opencdk
* libgcrypt
* libgpg_error

Furthermore, as I understand it, our switching to OpenSSL had already made GNUTLS useless in Sage when we started shipping the Flask notebook (Sage 5.2), so we can get rid of GNUTLS and related SPKGs at the same time.

See also #13385.

I think `notebook.setup()` uses `certtool` from `gnutls` and with these packages gone it is no longer sufficient to run `sage -u openssl pyopenssl` to start using a secure notebook. (I've installed gnutls system-wide and it works now.)
