The "percent" style still works in Python 3 and I couldn't find a notice about its deprecation.

See the current discussion at #13899 for why it might not be wise to do a large, commonly used directory all at once.

There are about 51 affected modules. 4 of them have a new line `from __future__ import print_function`. 

But there are also modules with the new function `print()` but no `from __future__`. An example is `/src/sage/misc/attached_files.py`.

How can this work?

In these cases it's still the print statement and not the function that is used. The parentheses are ignored like in

```
sage: a = (5)
sage: a
5
```
so in most cases you can write
`print("some string")` instead of `print "some string"` without using `from __future__`

<a id='comment:23'></a>Yes, meanwhile I have also discovered it while working on ticket:15989.

But apparently the tool 2to3 fix_print (or futurize fix_print_with_import) does not detect this case and wraps another pair of parenthesis around it.

Maybe we should not add `from __future__ import print_function` but just make sure that the print statement has those extra parenthesis?

I will mention this in ticket:15989.

In my opinion we should use `from __future__ import print_function` if necessary. It's a simple way to get python 2 and python 3 compatible `print`.

BTW could you review this patch? Thanks.

<a id='comment:26'></a>Looks good to and all doctests pass.

`from __future__ import print_function` is apparently only added when trailing "," are converted to `end=" "`.

Currently I would suggest NOT to wrap the print parameters with parenthesis in //doctests// as this might be handled be a new version of the preparser (see also ticket:15989).

BTW: I hope the changes to the `raise` statements will not interfere to much with ticket:15990.

While I went through the patch I did some polishing and added it to a reviewer patch.
