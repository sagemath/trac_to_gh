Two questions that sound overly critical, but are really just out of curiosity:
* Curious why you ported these forward right now; the current release manager has been skeptical of changes hitting many files that are mainly cosmetic (like whitespace), since it means a lot of rebasing for others (or can, anyway) - not that these won't be very needed eventually, but we aren't switching to Python 3 anytime soon.
* Why not also move to the new string formatting syntax for these (ones only)?  The "percent" style wouldn't work in Python 3 either, so the job is sort of half done.

Although we aren't switching to Python 3 in the near future, this work has to be done anyway. It might also speed up the process.

>  * Why not also move to the new string formatting syntax for these (ones only)?  The "percent" style wouldn't work in Python 3 either, so the job is sort of half done.
 
The "percent" style still works in Python 3 and I couldn't find a notice about its deprecation.

Thanks for reviewing my patches.

See the current discussion at #13899 for why it might not be wise to do a large, commonly used directory all at once.

[Interesting but true](http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting)!  My [usual source of info](http://docs.python.org/release/3.0.1/whatsnew/3.0.html#pep-3101-a-new-approach-to-string-formatting) apparently never was incorporated.  My guess is that so many people found it irksome to switch legacy code that they never bothered deprecating it ... yet.

I had a look at the patch "trac 13255: replace some deprecated python functions in sage/misc".

There are about 51 affected modules. 4 of them have a new line <code>from \`__future__\` import print_function</code>. 

But there are also modules with the new function `print()` but no `from __future__`. An example is `/src/sage/misc/attached_files.py`.

How can this work?

In these cases it's still the print statement and not the function that is used. The parentheses are ignored like in

```
sage: a = (5)
sage: a
5
```
so in most cases you can write
`print("some string")` instead of `print "some string"` without using `from __future__`

Yes, meanwhile I have also discovered it while working on ticket:15989.

But apparently the tool 2to3 fix_print (or futurize fix_print_with_import) does not detect this case and wraps another pair of parenthesis around it.

Maybe we should not add <code>from \`__future__\` import print_function</code> but just make sure that the print statement has those extra parenthesis?

I will mention this in ticket:15989.

In my opinion we should use <code>from \`__future__\` import print_function</code> if necessary. It's a simple way to get python 2 and python 3 compatible `print`.

BTW could you review this patch? Thanks.

Looks good to and all doctests pass.

<code>from \`__future__\` import print_function</code> is apparently only added when trailing "," are converted to `end=" "`.

Currently I would suggest NOT to wrap the print parameters with parenthesis in *doctests* as this might be handled be a new version of the preparser (see also ticket:15989).

BTW: I hope the changes to the `raise` statements will not interfere to much with ticket:15990.

I tested the change OK.

While I went through the patch I did some polishing and added it to a reviewer patch.


If you agree with my branch, you can set this to positive review. Otherwise set your latest patch to positive review.

The majority of changes simplify `"{0}{1}{2}"` to `"{}{}{}"`. Since Python 2.7 (and Python 3.1) the positional argument specifiers can be omitted [Format strings](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/string.html#formatstrings).
