#9257 removed one of the last remnants of the darcs revision control system from Sage.   Currently we have

```
$ grep -r darcs Downloads/sage-4.8/devel/sage/
Binary file Downloads/sage-4.8/devel/sage/.hg/store/00manifest.d matches
Binary file Downloads/sage-4.8/devel/sage/.hg/store/data/changes.i matches

Binary file Downloads/sage-4.8/devel/sage/.hg/store/data/notes.txt.i matches
Binary file Downloads/sage-4.8/devel/sage/.hg/store/data/sage/misc/darcs.py.i matches
```
which is fine, all repo history.  But apparently we still have a file named sage-mirror-darcs-script:

```
$ grep -r darcs Downloads/sage-5.0/local/bin/
Binary file Downloads/sage-5.0/local/bin/.hg/dirstate matches
Downloads/sage-5.0/local/bin/.hg/store/fncache:data/sage-mirror-darcs-scripts.i
Binary file Downloads/sage-5.0/local/bin/.hg/undo.dirstate matches
Downloads/sage-5.0/local/bin/.hgignore:(^|/)\_darcs($|/)
Downloads/sage-5.0/local/bin/.hgignore:darcs
Downloads/sage-5.0/local/bin/sage-mirror:rsync -axLH --rsh=ssh --delete -r -v  bin/sage-* bin/_darcs modular:/home/was/www/sage/dist/src/scripts-darcs/
Downloads/sage-5.0/local/bin/sage-mirror-darcs-scripts:cd _darcs/
Downloads/sage-5.0/local/bin/sage-mirror-darcs-scripts:rsync -axLH --rsh=ssh --delete -r -v  * was@modular.math.washington.edu:www/sage/dist/src/scripts-darcs/_darcs/
```
and it's even still in spkg/bin/sage (the old sage-sage)!

```
$ grep -r darcs Downloads/sage-5.0/spkg/bin/
Downloads/sage-5.0/spkg/bin/sage:if [ "$1" = '-darcs'  -o "$1" = '--darcs' ]; then
Downloads/sage-5.0/spkg/bin/sage:    darcs "$@"
```
Needless to say,

```
$ sage -darcs
/Users/.../sage-5.0/spkg/bin/sage: line 606: darcs: command not found
```
So let's get rid of these last things.  Especially if we might be migrating to git in the mid-range future...
