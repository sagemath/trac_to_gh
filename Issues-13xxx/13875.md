This patch adds tests on memory allocation in the distances_all_pairs module. This is to prevent returning NULL pointers when the memory space is insufficient to allocate data structure.

These tests are not doctested since the behavior depends on the computer (ram).

You cannot do things like `if distances==NULL or predecessor==NULL:` and raise an exception in that case. If distances has been allocated and predecessor hasn't, then an exception is raised before `distances` is freed.

Besides, I expect this patch to be incompatible with your hyperbolicity patch. This ticket should depend on #13808 !

Oh. And I am not sure that it is wise to return as a message "Not enough space". Sometimes there is sufficient memory available, but not a contiguous segment as long as you need it to be. In such cases there is sufficient memory, just not allocated as it should. Something like `raise MemoryError()` is ok I guess.

No, this ticket is hopefully independent on the hyperbolicity patch. Furthermore, it don't change the behavior of the hyperbolicity patch. I have tested all possible combinations and I have no conflicts.

Thanks !

As before, though, there are memory leaks if `t_prec` is allocated but not `prec`.

```
 t_prec = <unsigned short *> sage_malloc(n*n*sizeof(short)) 
 if t_prec==NULL: 
     raise MemoryError() 
 prec = <unsigned short **> sage_malloc(n*sizeof(short *)) 
 if prec==NULL: 
     raise MemoryError() 
```

You should add a `sage_free(t_prec)` before the second `raise MemoryError()`, and it hppens several timees in the file.
