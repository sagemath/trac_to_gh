```
If R is a ring equipped with an endomorphism sigma, the ring of skew polynomials over (R,sigma) is the ring of usual polynomials over R with the modified multiplication given by the rule X*a = sigma(a)*X.

Skew polynomials play an important role in several domains like coding theory or Galois representations theory in positive characteristic.

This ticket provides:

1. a basic implementation of skew polynomials over any commutative ring (including addition, multiplication, euclidean division, gcd...)
2. construction of skew polynomial rings

With your changes it is now possible to test some element in an Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring to be a unit and to compute its inverse. Unfortunately, this computation gives wrong results:

```
sage: Z16x.<x> = Integers(16)[]
sage: GR.<y> =  Z16x.quotient(x**2 + x+1 )
sage: (2*y).is_unit()
True
sage: (2*y)^(-1)
15*y + 15
sage: (2*y)*(2*y)^(-1)
2
```

Maybe you should produce a seperate trac ticket for the fix of 

```
sage: (2*y)^(-1)
...
NotImplementedError: The base ring (=Ring of integers modulo 16) is not a field
```

By the way, I know that this is a problem which also occurs for usual polynomials (because of the default definition of the reduce function). Do you have any idea how to fix this:

```
sage: Z16x.<x> = SkewPolynomialRing(Integers(16)) 
sage: # Z16x.<x> = Integers(16)[] # has the same behaviour
sage: GR.<y> =  Z16x.quotient(x**2 + x+1 )
sage: I = GR.ideal(4)
sage: I.reduce(6)
6

I started a discussion on\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/s5y604ZPiQ8/discussion.\nThe function reduce() does what it says *returning an element of the ring*.\nBut in the definition of a QuotientRing there is the following assumption\n    `I.reduce(x)==I.reduce(y) \\iff x-y \\in I`, and\n    `x-I.reduce(x) \\in I`, for all `x \\in R`.\nWith this default behaviour, the quotient ring is just a copy of the original ring R. \n\nBest, Thomas",

Hi Xavier,

you are right this is a more general problem. I started a discussion on
https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/s5y604ZPiQ8/discussion.
The function reduce() does what it says *returning an element of the ring*.
But in the definition of a QuotientRing there is the following assumption
    `I.reduce(x)==I.reduce(y) \iff x-y \in I`, and
    `x-I.reduce(x) \in I`, for all `x \in R`.
With this default behaviour, the quotient ring is just a copy of the original ring R. 

Best, Thomas

It would be great to have all this in Sage. Thanks a lot for your work.

I haven't had a chance to look at the patches yet. I will try to make some time available for this in the coming weeks. For now, I have two questions,

* Did you consider using Singular's noncommutative component, Plural, as a basic data structure for skew polynomials? I expect the arithmetic to be much faster with Plural than a new implementation in Cython.
* Can the patches be broken down into smaller components for easier review?

I don't know yet. It depends on how many functionally independent parts there are. For instance, the short representations for morphisms can be an independent piece that is trivial to review.

> I had a quick look at the documentation of Plural but I didn't find how to create a skew polynomial ring (i.e. I don't know how to represent a skew polynomial ring as a G-algebra). Could you please learn me this?

For example, QQ[n, S:n->n+1] :

```
sage: A.<n, S> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, 2)
sage: R.<n, S> = A.g_algebra({S*n: n*S + 1})

```


After applying the patches on this ticket and its dependencies, I get the following error:

```

The hash functions for morphisms would also be a separate bug fix. Actually, I attempted to fix that a long time ago at #9016.

From a cursory reading of [attachment: trac_13215_skew_polynomials.patch,.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13215/61d842e1bb167012bfc80316c0f7f56f.gz) I see these separate parts that should have a ticket of its own:

- short representations for morphisms
- hash functions for morphisms (#9016)
- q_jordan
- modular exponentiation of polynomial_element

A few comments (not a full review):

- the operator `/` always constructs the quotient domain in Sage, even if exact division is possible. Since in this case we need a generic Ore localization for `/`, I suggest you only implement exact division with `//` and raise an error on `/`.

 ```
 +    sage: d = a * b
 +    sage: d/b == a   # Right division
 +    True
 +
 +    sage: c/b
 +    Traceback (most recent call last):
 +    ...
 +    ValueError: the division is not exact
 ```

- For the constructor, why don't you check if the argument of the `__getitem__` method is a `Morphism` instead of this:

 ```
       from sage.categories.morphism import Morphism
        if isinstance(x,tuple) and len(x) == 2 and isinstance(x[1],Morphism):
 ```
 This should remove the limitation of having to specify the variable name on the right hand side as documented here:

 ```
 +One can also use a shorter syntax::
 +
 +    sage: S.<x> = R['x',sigma]; S
 +    Skew Polynomial Ring in x over Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Integer Ring twisted by t |--> t + 1
 +
 +Be careful, with the latter syntax, one cannot omit the name of the 
 +variable neither in LHS nor in RHS. If we omit it in LHS, the variable 
 +is not created::
 +
 +    sage: Sy = R['y',sigma]; Sy
 +    Skew Polynomial Ring in y over Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Integer Ring twisted by t |--> t + 1
 +    sage: y.parent()
 +    Traceback (most recent call last):
 +    ...
 +    NameError: name 'y' is not defined    
 +
 +If we omit it in RHS, sage tries to create a polynomial ring and fails::
 +
 +    sage: Sz.<z> = R[sigma]
 +    Traceback (most recent call last):
 +    ...
 +    ValueError: variable names must be alphanumeric, but one is 'Ring endomorphism of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Integer Ring
 +      Defn: t |--> t + 1' which is not.
```

- There is a class `SkewPolynomialRing_finite_field` defined in `sage/rings/polynomial/skewpolynomial_ring.py`. There is also a file `sage/rings/polynomial/skewpolynomial_finite_field.pyx`. It seems that the class defined in the latter does not use the latter:

 ```
 cdef class SkewPolynomial_finite_field_dense (SkewPolynomial_generic_dense):
```

- I suggest using `skew_polynomial` in the file names instead of `skewpolynomial`.

- Are the `Left` and `Right` objects defined in `sage/structure/side.py` really necessary? If `Right` is the default, can't you just have a keyword argument `left=<bool>`?

- There are many functions missing a docstring or tests. Here is partial coverage output:

Thanks a lot for all your comments!

Replying to [@burcin](#comment%3A19):

Ok, I've done it (see tickets #13640, #13641 #13642 and old ticket #13214 for "hash functions for morphisms").

> After applying the patches on this ticket and its dependencies, I get the following error:

It's now fixed. (I haven't really understood what was the problem. It worked well on sage 5.1.0. I just removed some `inline` somewhere.)

> - the operator `/` always constructs the quotient domain in Sage, even if exact division is possible. Since in this case we need a generic Ore localization for `/`, I suggest you only implement exact division with `//` and raise an error on `/`.

Done.

> - For the constructor, why don't you check if the argument of the `__getitem__` method is a `Morphism` instead of this:
> 
>  ```
>        from sage.categories.morphism import Morphism
>         if isinstance(x,tuple) and len(x) == 2 and isinstance(x[1],Morphism):

>  This should remove the limitation of having to specify the variable name on the right hand side as documented here:

It's not possible to remove this limitation this way because of the preparser (you see in the following example that the variable 'x' doesn't appear in the first instruction on the last line).

```
sage: k.<t> = GF(5^3)
sage: Frob = k.frobenius_endomorphism()
sage: preparse(S.<x> = k[Frob])
sage: preparse("S.<x> = k[Frob]")
'S = k[Frob]; (x,) = S._first_ngens(1)'
```

> - I suggest using `skew_polynomial` in the file names instead of `skewpolynomial`.

Done.

> - Are the `Left` and `Right` objects defined in `sage/structure/side.py` really necessary? If `Right` is the default, can't you just have a keyword argument `left=<bool>`?

Sometimes, `Left` is the default (for lcm). I agree that we can just have a boolean argument but, when I wrote this code, I thought that it was more elegant to do this way. Anymay, I can change if you insist :-).

> - There are many functions missing a docstring or tests.

I've added some documentation and doctests (but I'm still far from a 100% coverage).

Needs to be rebased on sage-5.12beta5. The patch fails to apply to sage/structure/all.py.

I'd do it myself but when I try to open the file in gedit, I get:
"The file you opened has some invalid characters. If you continue editing this file you could corrupt this document.
You can also choose another character encoding and try again."
Might be some accents or umlauts on names.

Some bugs still remain.

A little thing I noted: `is_SkewPolynomial` should be removed, I think. Sage
moved away from that kind of functions. The category framework should be used
instead, but I don't think we need to find a replacement for it just now.

We planned on breaking up this skew polynomials ticket into five pieces namely:
1. Ticket A - The main framework. Skew polynomials, basic operations, coercions, skew polynomial rings, etc.
2. Ticket B - Class SkewPolynomial_finite_field_dense, class SkewPolynomialRing_finite_field and related methods
3. Ticket C - cdef class SkewPolynomial_finite_field_karatsuba and related methods
4. Ticket D - class SectionSkewPolynomialCenterInjection, class SkewPolynomialCenterInjection, class CenterSkewPolynomialRing and related methods
5. Ticket E - Irreducibility and Factoring related methods.

The current ticket #13215 has been modified to cover Ticket A. I will post an update here with the links to the remaining tickets once they have been created. For now, based on discussions, the main framework has been refactored, appended to, edited, documented and tested. I'm now opening this ticket for review.

```json
{
    "body": "<a id='comment:59'>Comment 59:</a>\nHello,\n\nI started reviewing your work. For now, I mostly read documentation and checked\nformatting, without focusing on the code itself. \nHere are my comments:\n\n## Generic comments:\n\n- For now, there's nothing related to skew polynomials in the index file, so it won't be possible\n  for the user to access the documentation through the online reference manual.\n  Can you please add a dedicated section in the related index file? See `src/doc/en/reference/polynomial_rings/index.rst`.\n\n- I would also use the experimental decorator here: the code in itself seems stable, but it\n  will allow us to make later name changes (for instance) without putting deprecation warnings\n  all over the place. In particular, I have in mind later implementations of sparse rings and\n  multivariate rings, which might trigger some renaming in the classes implemented here.\n\n## skew_polynomial_ring_constructor.py\n\n- I might be wrong, but it does not seem to have any reason to get both input `name` and `names`.\n  The argument in the `NOTE` block sounds weird to me, especially when reading the code: it seems\n  to be some kind of argument for later enhancements (multivariate skew polynomial rings), as for now\n  it does not work if the list contains more than one element. Furthermore, the input `names` is\n  only used to set `name` if the latter is `None`, and dropped just after.\n  And in any case, I think it's better to use only one input and use type checks.\n  I propose to remove `names`, rename `name` into `variable_names`, and use sanity checks: if it's \n  a string, or a list with a single string, use it, otherwise return an appropriate error.\n  I also suggest to add a line in the note block to say that multivariate rings are not\n  supported (it's only detailed in tests for now).\n- Can you please explicit what `LHS`/`RHS` means?\n- There's an option `sparse=False` which, if set to `True`, returns a `NotImplementedError`.\n  I suggest to remove it for now in order to not confuse the user, and reinstate it later\n  when it will be fully implemented. In this case, also remove all references to this feature\n  in the documentation.\n- `INPUT` block could be enhanced: I would rather explain what's `name` (or `variable_names` if\n  you agree with my comment above) instead of just saying \"a string\". I would also rename `sigma`\n  to something more indicative. What about `base_ring_endomorphism`?\n- As I suggest to remove some not implemented but planned features, it might be a good\n  idea to add a `TODO` block as a reminder of these features (sparse rings, multivariate rings).\n- Module title says \"constructorS for skew polynomial rings\", while there's only one method\n  in this module. `</quibbling>`\n- Module documentation itself is not great. I think it might be a good idea to add a few\n  links to `skew_polynomial_ring.py`, and even to give a small definition of a skew polynomial ring\n  in this module.\n\n## skew_polynomial_ring.py\n\n- The short description of this module:\n  \"Sage implements dense skew univariate polynomials over commutative rings.\",\n  seems unhelpful. I'd rather replace it by something explaining the purpose of this\n  module.\n- I think the definition can be enhanced a bit: for instance, you find references to \"twisting\"\n  all over the examples, but it's not defined everywhere. Reading what's in the `DEFINITION` block\n  should be enough to understand the terminology used in the module, even if you're not familiar with\n  skew polynomials at all.\n- Same remark as above regarding `LHS`/`RHS`.\n- Some imports are not necessary anymore, e.g. `import sage.misc.latex as latex`.\n- Some methods here do not follow the mandatory documentation template.\n  For instance, `__init__` does not have a short description, nor an `INPUT` block...\n- There are a few methods in this file which are commented. If these are no longer useful,\n  I suggest to remove them instead of commeting them.\n- In some methods, documentation is not really helpful: see `twist_map` for instance. \n  If says \"Return the twist map [...]\" which is not very informative... \n- While I'm talking about it, would it be possible to explain why this method might fail\n  if you pass a negative number as input? The sentence \"Sometimes it succeeds\" seems to imply\n  it's more or less random, but if you could investigate this a bit it would lead to a more\n  satisfying documentation.\n\n## skew_polynomial_element.py\n\n- Same remark as above regarding the definition of a skew polynomial ring.\n- Same remark as above regarding imported packages.\n- Same remark as above regarding informativeness of docstrings for some methods.\n- Same remark as above regarding documentation itself: a few methods (e.g. `conjugate`) do\n  not have a short description, while `make_generic_skew_polynomial` does not have documentation at all!\n\nBest,\n\nDavid",

<a id='comment:59'>Comment 59:</a>
Hello,

I started reviewing your work. For now, I mostly read documentation and checked
formatting, without focusing on the code itself. 
Here are my comments:

## Generic comments:

- For now, there's nothing related to skew polynomials in the index file, so it won't be possible
  for the user to access the documentation through the online reference manual.
  Can you please add a dedicated section in the related index file? See `src/doc/en/reference/polynomial_rings/index.rst`.

- I would also use the experimental decorator here: the code in itself seems stable, but it
  will allow us to make later name changes (for instance) without putting deprecation warnings
  all over the place. In particular, I have in mind later implementations of sparse rings and
  multivariate rings, which might trigger some renaming in the classes implemented here.

## skew_polynomial_ring_constructor.py

- I might be wrong, but it does not seem to have any reason to get both input `name` and `names`.
  The argument in the `NOTE` block sounds weird to me, especially when reading the code: it seems
  to be some kind of argument for later enhancements (multivariate skew polynomial rings), as for now
  it does not work if the list contains more than one element. Furthermore, the input `names` is
  only used to set `name` if the latter is `None`, and dropped just after.
  And in any case, I think it's better to use only one input and use type checks.
  I propose to remove `names`, rename `name` into `variable_names`, and use sanity checks: if it's 
  a string, or a list with a single string, use it, otherwise return an appropriate error.
  I also suggest to add a line in the note block to say that multivariate rings are not
  supported (it's only detailed in tests for now).
- Can you please explicit what `LHS`/`RHS` means?
- There's an option `sparse=False` which, if set to `True`, returns a `NotImplementedError`.
  I suggest to remove it for now in order to not confuse the user, and reinstate it later
  when it will be fully implemented. In this case, also remove all references to this feature
  in the documentation.
- `INPUT` block could be enhanced: I would rather explain what's `name` (or `variable_names` if
  you agree with my comment above) instead of just saying "a string". I would also rename `sigma`
  to something more indicative. What about `base_ring_endomorphism`?
- As I suggest to remove some not implemented but planned features, it might be a good
  idea to add a `TODO` block as a reminder of these features (sparse rings, multivariate rings).
- Module title says "constructorS for skew polynomial rings", while there's only one method
  in this module. `</quibbling>`
- Module documentation itself is not great. I think it might be a good idea to add a few
  links to `skew_polynomial_ring.py`, and even to give a small definition of a skew polynomial ring
  in this module.

## skew_polynomial_ring.py

- The short description of this module:
  "Sage implements dense skew univariate polynomials over commutative rings.",
  seems unhelpful. I'd rather replace it by something explaining the purpose of this
  module.
- I think the definition can be enhanced a bit: for instance, you find references to "twisting"
  all over the examples, but it's not defined everywhere. Reading what's in the `DEFINITION` block
  should be enough to understand the terminology used in the module, even if you're not familiar with
  skew polynomials at all.
- Same remark as above regarding `LHS`/`RHS`.
- Some imports are not necessary anymore, e.g. `import sage.misc.latex as latex`.
- Some methods here do not follow the mandatory documentation template.
  For instance, `__init__` does not have a short description, nor an `INPUT` block...
- There are a few methods in this file which are commented. If these are no longer useful,
  I suggest to remove them instead of commeting them.
- In some methods, documentation is not really helpful: see `twist_map` for instance. 
  If says "Return the twist map [...]" which is not very informative... 
- While I'm talking about it, would it be possible to explain why this method might fail
  if you pass a negative number as input? The sentence "Sometimes it succeeds" seems to imply
  it's more or less random, but if you could investigate this a bit it would lead to a more
  satisfying documentation.

## skew_polynomial_element.py

- Same remark as above regarding the definition of a skew polynomial ring.
- Same remark as above regarding imported packages.
- Same remark as above regarding informativeness of docstrings for some methods.
- Same remark as above regarding documentation itself: a few methods (e.g. `conjugate`) do
  not have a short description, while `make_generic_skew_polynomial` does not have documentation at all!

Best,

David

I disagree with these comments. This is documenting an upcoming feature, it helps keeps the API consistent with future plans and other parts of Sage, and tells someone reading the code what is currently not implemented.

I treat this more as a strong guideline than a hard rule, but with that being said, anything more non-trivial should at least document its inputs (e.g., the `__init__` would be useful).

I agree with the rest of David's comments.

Also, from a cursory glance, there seems to be a lot of duplication with the current implementations of polynomials (i.e., the elements). I feel there could be a lot of simplification of the code by either subclassing or creating a mix-in (cython) class that overrides the `_mul_` of polynomials. Is there a reason why you didn't do this? This might entail doing some refactoring/abstracting of the polynomial code though, but it should make the implementation of skew polynomials a lot easier (and bug proof).

I read up a little on Sphinx documentation and from what I understand, I need to add the following in the file you mentioned, right?

```

Placing the experimental warning (like I did above) is not the right way to do it because it does not throw an error. Do I instead place this line at the start of every class in all the three files instead?

I agree. `names` and `name` are both not required and `variable_names` along with tests to check type of the input is cleaner. I've made this change.

Like @tscrim mentions, I think LHS/RHS are extremely common terms that are used almost everywhere and perhaps don't need explicit description.

There are a lot of places where a NotImplementedError is raised and not just in this ticket but in other polynomial files as well. I think it makes more sense to have them if they are already there. However, there is then the inconsistency in that derivations in skew polynomials are not implemented and are marked as `todo` as is the multivariate case in some places. Still, I argue for keeping sparse as it is since it is integrated in the framework already unlike the other two. And with the experimental warning showing up, changing this will not create too much trouble.

An endomorphism that admits an inverse is an automorphism and skew polynomial rings AFAIK are based on automorphisms. Please correct me if I'm mistaken in this. If so, the places where it says that the twist map is not invertible, maybe should say that twist map should be invertible. And accordingly, the name can be changed to `base_ring_automorphism`.

Understood. I've made changes and expanded on the definitions and examples from other files. Same goes for all other notes (below) about improving explanations. 

> - Some imports are not necessary anymore, e.g. `import sage.misc.latex as latex`.

I tried to do that with the ones I thought were not needed/deprecated. I've obviously missed a few. I'll go over this once again.

Is there a reference doc or something where I can go through the mandatory documentation template? Or is it that Description, Input, Output, Examples, Tests - should these be present for every method? A lot of places, it doesn't make sense to have all of this.

Oh right! I mentioned this in the email thread with Johan except that I somehow messed up the name. I wasn't sure of what this method was doing.

Yup! I you're not sure of what you're doing, here's a way to test it:
run `sage --docbuild src/doc/en/reference/polynomial_rings html`, it will compile the 
doc and give you an address. Copy-paste this address in your browser, and click on "index"
in the page which opens. If what you added in `index.rst` works, you should see it here (and
you'll be able to check its formatting as well).

Mmh, I reconsidered my position on this thanks to Travis' comment: as we'll not change the public API (which is the method in `skew_polynomial_ring_constructor.py`), I don't think it's necessary to
put experimental warnings everywhere, as long as we're future proof as Travis suggests.
\\\\

Yes, you're both right, let's drop that and keep `LHS`/`RHS`.

> There are a lot of places where a NotImplementedError is raised and not just in this ticket but in other polynomial files as well. I think it makes more sense to have them if they are already there. However, there is then the inconsistency in that derivations in skew polynomials are not implemented and are marked as `todo` as is the multivariate case in some places. Still, I argue for keeping sparse as it is since it is integrated in the framework already unlike the other two. And with the experimental warning showing up, changing this will not create too much trouble.

Yes, thinking again about it, I think you're both right. It's better to be future proof, and if
it's used elsewhere in `polynomials`, there's definitely no trouble in doing so.

Err, yes my bad. `base_ring_automorphism` sounds good `:)`

Don't worry, it's quite tricky.

You can read this [tutorial](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings) for Sage developers.
But I agree this is not strong rules: while I do follow the "short description, jump line, optional
long description" for my methods, I only write an `OUTPUT` block when the output is not obvious from reading the short description. I always write an `INPUT` block when there's input arguments, as I
think that even if the names of the input arguments seems obvious, it's always nice to have an
explicit definition. `EXAMPLES` are of course mandatory. `TESTS` are not, I think you should only 
use them when you want to run a few more tests which do not really make sense for the user. For instance, I use `TESTS` to doctest sanity checks. It's nice to add a doctest to ensure everything is
sanitized, but it's of little interest for the user.

Oh ok! I'll read it and try to understand what it does.

That command you mentioned didn't work. I get the following error message.

```
'src/doc/en/reference/polynomial_rings' is not a recognized document. Type 'sage --docbuild -D' for a list
of documents, or 'sage --docbuild --help' for more help.

```

I've made the other changes according to the discussions above.

This is debatable: sparse skew polynomials are not very useful whenever there is a derivation (since sparsity is not retained well across operations), and it's not very clear what a multivariate skew ring is. The most natural generalisation of this structure is Ore polynomials, but that would likely be a separate class.

One would perhaps add skew polynomials with derivations before full-fledged Ore rings, though :-)

I'm not asking for perfection. If we do decide to subclass, then it just makes it somewhat harder to refactor once this is included. Just to be clear, I am just raising the question, not making the refactoring a requirement.

Hello,

Oh, ok I was not aware of that. I tested it on my side, and indeed whenever you use diamond bracket, it expects an argument called `names`. 
Xavier's comments on the `NOTE` block makes sense now.

In that case, what about removing the argument `name` and keep only `names`?
Then, through input sanitization, allow only string, list containing one string, fail with a specific error if one passes a list with several strings in it explaining multivariate ring is not yet supported, and fail with a generic error message, e.g. "You can only pass a string, or a list of string for input `names`" otherwise.
I think it does the trick.

You have a point. The names and conventions are unlikely to change within the
limited scope of this ticket. For the follow-up tickets containing the rest of
Caruso's code the experimental decorator could be considered.

You do want to use `names`:

```
sage: preparse('R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)')
"R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, names=('x',)); (x,) = R._first_ngens(1)"
```

Some notes on the code from a skim through:

- You seem to be using the exact same format of polynomials, which contains a lot of old code. For example, don't implement a `_repr_()` that just calls (a *Python* function) `_repr()`. This is useless (even in the usual polynomial ring code it seems); instead just implement `_repr_()`. Similarly, there are a number of methods you could simply `cpdef`.
- Kill with fire and holy water `is_*` methods. They just trivially call `isinstance`.
- You can use

  ```
  self._no_generic_basering_coercion = True
  ```
  to avoid constructing the coercion from the base ring when initializing the skew polynomial ring.
- `_cmp_` is planned to be removed. Use `_richcmp_` instead.
- You should lazy import the ring constructor.
- You are double importing things in the element class; only keep the `cimport`'s.

You seem to understand these things quite well, and we had quite some problems
with getting this code to work, so could you please elaborate on the following
things:

To be precise, do you mean that can insert the above line in `SkewPolynomialRing_general.__init__` just before the call to `Algebra.__init__`, and then remove the call to `self._unset_coercions_used()`? Or is there more to it?

> - `_cmp_` is planned to be removed. Use `_richcmp_` instead.

Are you talking about `SkewPolynomial._cmp_`? We spent many hours debugging the comparison code because it threw strange errors and segfaults. To avoid me spending many more hours, could I ask you to tell us exactly how to write the correct comparison code then?

Simon King's tutorial on implementing algebraic structures should be updated to be more informative on this, I think.

> - You should lazy import the ring constructor.

Do you mean `sage.rings.ring` in `skew_polynomial_ring.py`? Why is exactly that one important to lazily import?

Thanks for the help!

This is useless (even in the usual polynomial ring code it seems); instead just implement `_repr_()`. Similarly, there are a number of methods you could simply `cpdef`.

Anything python method (a `def`) which only calls a `cdef` method. Another example is `list` calling `_list_c`. IIRC, you can't do this for `__hash__` because this is a Python special method. I think `_list_c` is the only other one (and you can replace this by just calling the attribute `__coeffs`).

Yes, exactly.

You can look at `src/sage/rings/real_arb.pyx` or `src/sage/rings/real_double.pyx` for example. We can include the `_cmp_` as it is now, but it means some more hardship when we finally start converting.

> Simon King's tutorial on implementing algebraic structures should be updated to be more informative on this, I think.

Yes, it should be. It was written before we really had to worry about going to Python3.

>

It is the thing which imports the rest of the code (once the `is_*` functions are gone). So all of the other files are not imported on startup, which helps keep that down because this is not a "common" object that the average user will use (IMO).

> Thanks for the help!

Thank you for the good discussions and work.

Hello,

Good work on docstrings and module documentation, it's much better now.
However, I have some comments:

- documentation does not compile: it seems you have some formatting errors in bullet lists.
- you used single backquote notation at some places in the documentation where it should be 
  double backquotes, e.g. in `SkewPolynomial` class, you wrote `self` between single backquotes (which triggers LaTeX formatting) instead of double.
- a few lines below, `default: False`, `False` should be between double backquotes.
- you kept the import `import sage.misc.latex as latex`. I'm quite sure you can remove it, but in that case, you'll have to change `latex.latex(self.base_ring())` to `self.base_ring()._latex_()` (l. 359, skew_polynomial_ring.py). There's probably some more to change.

Apart from that, it looks good to me.
Patchbot says some doctests fails, but according to which doctests are failing, I'm quite sure it's not because of this ticket.

Best,

David

I think I managed to replace the `_cmp_` method with _richcmp_. Please let me know if I did it incorrectly or something. Back tick inconsistencies are resolved. The latex import in skew_polynomial_element.pyx was removable, but the skew_polynomial_ring did not allow it. It threw up errors and I think its because the latex method of the self._map does not support it. 

Also, I don't understand what is going wrong when I try to build the documentation. I can't find any indentation errors.

```

This is the kind of error sphinx returns when there's no blank line after a bullet list. 
Usually, it's because you did not indented properly if you put several lines in a single bullet.
It should be like this:

```
- my first line
  and my second line
```

so it's not 4 whitespaces, it has to be aligned with the first character of the line above.

Anyway, for your issues, I'd say run `make doc-clean` and `make`.

David

Hi David,

I finally managed to make sense of the error messages that were showing up in the documentation. For instance,
[polynomia] docstring of sage.rings.polynomial.skew_polynomial_element:16: WARNING: Literal block expected; none found.

Represents some error in the 16th line of the documentation of the file and so on..

And like you suggested, one set of errors was because it indented incorrectly. Anyway, I think I've solved all the issues (docs build successfully on my system) and I do get a path to all the html files. Can you please confirm this?

Oh, sorry, I thought you knew how to read these! Otherwise, I would have told you... It's not the most intuitive error message for sure, and I had some troubles with Sphinx compiler messages when I started working on Sage `:)`.

I just pulled your branch and I'm recompiling the reference manual. 
If everything goes smoothly, I don't have other remarks, so if Johan and Travis agree, we can set this to `positive_review`.

And it worked just fine.
So, documentation compiles, tests passes, you fixed what we asked you to, I'm fine with it.
If no one objects, I'll set this to `positive_review`.

<a id='comment:92'>Comment 92:</a>
The important thing is the first comment. The rest is more polish, but I think a fair amount more is needed.

- *All* methods and functions must have doctests (e.g., the one added to `map.pyx` and hidden methods). Also, I think you should remove the commented out code.
- You should remove this line from `module_list.py`:

  ```
  # depends = numpy_depends),
  ```
- I would swap these lines in `rings.py`:

  ```diff
              
  -            from sage.categories.morphism import Morphism
               if isinstance(arg, tuple):
  +                from sage.categories.morphism import Morphism
                   if len(arg) == 2 and isinstance(arg[1], Morphism):
                      from sage.rings.polynomial.skew_polynomial_ring_constructor import SkewPolynomialRing
                      return SkewPolynomialRing(self, arg[1], names=arg[0])
                   
  ```
- Remove all trailing whitespace (well, at least do not add any).
- In `skew_polynomial_element.pyx`, there are a number of things that need to be in latex mode (and an equation using the `.. MATH::` block).
- I would move most-to-all of the module-level doc to the user entry point and then have a `.. SEEALSO:: block referencing said doc`, so it is visible from the `?` on the command line. This also applies to the parent class(es?) (i.e. module-level to class-level).
- You should make `list` into a `cpdef` with an output type of `list` and remove `_list_c`.
- For `__iter__`, just iterate over `self.__coeffs`. Actually, a similar statement applies to many other places you call `_list_c` where you don't expose it to the user or modify the list (e.g., `__getitem__` and `_richcmp_`. The multivariate and sparse versions should be overriding these methods anyways.
- You should use the cached version of `0` instead of going through coercion and getting a new object in memory:

  ```diff
           try:
               l = (<SkewPolynomial>self)._list_c()[n]
               return l
           except IndexError:
  -            c = self.base_ring()(0)
  -            return c
  +            return self.base_ring().zero()
  ```
- Use Python3 syntax for errors: `raise IndexError("skew polynomials are immutable")`.
- Similar to above: `self.parent()(0)` -> `self.parent().zero()`.
- `is_nilpotent` should have a short description of what the method should do (as well as the intended operation).
- `Returns` -> `Return` in a few first-line of docstrings.
- `.. Note::` -> `.. NOTE::` (this is a consistency thing).
- You have a blank `.. SEEALSO::` in `__floordiv__`.
- `is_left_divisible_by` doesn't have a short description. Similar for other such methods.
- Error messages should start with a lowercase letter (this was something we've agreed upon in somewhat more recent history).
- There is a preference to have <code>\`\`True\`\`</code> in code formatting since it is a Python object/concept.
- Actually, a number of functions that use `_list_c` should be moved to the concrete class (and maybe an `@abstract_method` placeholder done in the ABC.

I might have some more comments later too. However this is looking very good and it will be a great addition to Sage.

Also, the `_richcmp_` looks correct (although I don't have time right now to run any serious tests).

<a id='comment:94'>Comment 94:</a>
The implemented operator evaluation `__call__` is incorrect. For instance, `1(a) = a` and `x(a) = sigma(a)` in a correct implementation, but that is not the case here. The following implementation works:

```
    if eval_pt not in self._parent:
        raise TypeError("Evaluation point must be a ring element")
    sigma = self._parent.twist_map()
    coefficients = self.coefficients(sparse=False)
    sum = self._parent.zero()
    a = eval_pt
    for c in coefficients:
        sum += c * a
        a = sigma(a)
    return sum
```

I think we should make an effort to cythonize this method. Could you try that Arpit?

Best,
Johan

class `SkewPolynomial_general` inherits from class `SkewPolynomial`. The `_list_c` method is implemented in the former while in the latter it is not. Are you suggesting that I remove _list_c from both classes and only have a `cpdef list list(self)` in the latter class?

There is no `__coeffs` attribute in class `SkewPolynomial` and it is actually defined in class `SkewPolynomial_general`. Is it Python convention to access from one class, an attribute with double leading underscores of another class? If so, what is the correct way of doing that?

I would make a change like this:

```diff
 """
 Top/Module-level
 
-Description
 """
 class Foo:
     """
     Class-level.
+
+    Description
     """
```
That way when you do `Foo?`, you get `Description`. You also want some cross-linking so that someone using the online doc has links to follow to get to `Description`.

ABC = Abstract Base Class, so the methods you have that just raise a `NotImplementedError` (e.g., `_inplace_add`), you should have them be blank (modulo a docstring and a doctest of a concrete implementation) with a `@abstract_method`. These then get picked up by a failure of the `TestSuite`.

I tried adding the `@`abstract_method to the `cdef void _inplace_add` method and I got an error message saying "Cdef functions/classes cannot take arbitrary decorators." According to [their docs](http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/tutorial/pure.html), I don't think decorators are implemented yet.

Hello,

Some doctests are still missing. If you're not sure you documented everything, use the following command: `sage -coverage <path_to_files>`. On my side, it returns:

```
david@david:~/Desktop/sage/src/sage/rings/polynomial$ sage -coverage skew_polynomial_*

     * line 892: def is_nilpotent(self)

Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):

     * line 3129: cpdef Element _call_with_args(self, x, args=(), kwds={})

Missing documentation:

     * line 191: def __reduce__(self)
     * line 514: def parameter(self)
     * line 567: def is_sparse(self)
``` 

Also, documentation does not compile:

```
sage.rings.polynomial.skew_polynomial_ring.SkewPolynomialRing_general:53: 
WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
```

- line 872 in `skew_polynomial_element.pyx`, I think it would be better to return an error message with the exception `ValueError`.

- There are some undocumented methods/classes in `skew_polynomial_element.pyx` (starting at line 2776 with `_left_pow`).

- There's still one old style `raise` statement (l. 494 in `skew_polynomial_ring.py`).


David

Replying to [dlucas](#comment%3A103):

The `is_nilpotent` method is not implemented since order of the automorphism is not supported in Sage yet. How about if I remove this method completely and place the note instead in `def is_unit`? Or should I leave it as it is? 
> Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):

There is a `cpdef Element _call_(self, x)` method that does exactly the same thing as the above method. Do we need to keep both or can we keep the more general `_call_with_args` and remove `_call_`?

There's a bug in `right_lcm`. I don't yet know what it is but here is an example which makes it blow up:

    ```
    k.<a> = GF(3^2,'a')
    sigma = k.frobenius_endomorphism()
    S.<x> = k['x', sigma]
    (x^2 + 1*x + a).right_lcm(x - a)
    <BOOM>
    NotImplementedError: the leading coefficient is not a unit
    ```

Since we're over a field, it must be the `ZeroDivisionError` causing this, which should never happen.

I also don't see why we should catch the `ZeroDivisionError`: it is never
expected behaviour that `V3` is 0?

As an aside, the naming in this and related methods is terrible: `R` means two very different things in 10 lines, and the skew polynomial variables should not be capitalised.

Best,
Johan

The problem comes from the multiplication by the skew polynomial 0 which does not work as expected (it returns a polynomial of positive degree):

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(5^2)
sage: S.<x> = SkewPolynomialRing(k, k.frobenius_endomorphism())
sage: zero = S(0)*x
sage: zero.degree()
1
sage: zero + 1
 + 1

Just skimming the code, not a full review...

1. All this

```
        if op == 0:
            return x < y
        elif op == 1:
            return x <= y
        elif op == 2:
            return x == y
        elif op == 3:
            return x != y
        elif op == 4:
            return x > y
        else:
            return x >= y
```
can be replaced by `return PyObject_RichCompare(x, y, op)`, see `src/sage/structure/coerce.pyx` for an example.

2. Lots of private methods are unused:

```
    cdef void _inplace_add(self, SkewPolynomial_generic_dense right)
    cdef void _inplace_sub(self, SkewPolynomial_generic_dense right)
    cdef void _inplace_lmul(self, SkewPolynomial_generic_dense right)
    cpdef _leftpow_(self,right,modulus=*)
```
Since these are private, I see no point in implementing them.

3. The `.pxd` file contains too much stuff. In particular, the following all seems unused:

```
include "cysignals/signals.pxi"
include "../../ext/cdefs.pxi"
include '../../ext/stdsage.pxi'

from sage.rings.integer cimport Integer
from polynomial_compiled cimport CompiledPolynomialFunction
```
Some of this might be needed in `.pyx` files, but then it should be in the `.pyx` file. The `include` statements for `cdefs.pxi` and `stdsage.pxi` should be replaced instead by the relevant `cimport` statements.

4. Use the standard copyright template from http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files

5. `__getslice__` is deprecated.

6. `__mod__` should use the coercion model (#269).

7. `__floordiv__` should use the coercion model (#2034).

8. Replace `trac #13215` by <code>:trac:\`13215\`</code>

9. In several places, you use exact type checks of the form `type(x) is foo`. Why not `isinstance(x, foo)`?

Hello Jeroen,

> 10. according to the patchbot, the documentation does not build.

The patchbot might have used an older version of this ticket, because documentation builds just fine on my side.

Hi Jeroen,

I've made changes to the ticket based on your comments. Please do let me know if I've made a mistake and if there are any other changes I should be making.

Also, as David mentioned, the documentation builds on my system as well. I don't know the patchbot is suggesting otherwise.

Best,
Arpit.

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
Just a remark (feel free to change this or not): there is no point in writing `cdef list` here since you're not using the fact that it's a `list`:

```
        cdef list x = (<SkewPolynomial>left)._coeffs
        cdef list y = (<SkewPolynomial>right)._coeffs
        return PyObject_RichCompare(x, y, op)
```

In general one should avoid such pointless type declarations.

In this case, it doesn't hurt since Cython knows anyway that it's a list (`_coeffs` is declared to be a `list`).

By copyright, do you mean add names inside the block too? I added myself and Johan as authors (commit ac109c8)

As for the cdef list, I went with the rest of the code on the ticket which declares  things similarly at the time. But I can change that.

Actually, there's a template for copyrights in Sage (Jeroen sent you the link yesterday).

The copyright statements in this ticket are like this:

Hello,

I've updated the copyright banner. 

`@`Johan: Sorry for misspelling your name.

I've kept the `inplace_pow` and `inplace_rmul` methods because they are being used by `power_right_mod` and `power_left_mod`. I'm now opening it for review.

Best,
Arpit.

Hello,

There's still some small issues here:

- `ValueError` line 836 in `skew_polynomial_element.pyx` does not have any error message to explain
  to the user why this exception was raised.

- There's one old raise statement l.528 in `skew_polynomial_ring.py` (`raise IndexError, "generator n not defined"`) 

- Some methods in `skew_polynomial_element,pyx` are still undocumented. Even if I'm kind of ok with `_call_` not having a short description, I'm definitely not fine with a constructor  (l. 2945) without any description of its input parameters...

Back to `needs_work`.

David

Hello,

It seems good to me.
I just have two remarks:

- You wrote error messages for every exception, including `ZeroDivisionError` and `NotImplementedError`. IMHO, it's not necessary to write (for instance) `ZeroDivisionError("division by zero is not valid")`. To be honest, I would have been fine with it... But you wrote `ZeroDivisionError: division by zero is not valid` which I think is not compatible with Python 3 (not sure though).

- There's a broken doctest:

```
File "../rings/polynomial/rings.py", line 744, in sage.rings.polynomial.rings.Rings.ParentMethods.__getitem__
Failed example:
    k['x',Frob]
Expected:
    Skew Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field in t of size 5^3 twisted by Frobenius Endomorphism x |-> x^5 on Finite Field in t of size 5^3
Got:
    Skew Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field in t of size 5^3 twisted by t |--> t^5

```

Apart from that, I'm fine with your changes, tests pass and a lot of work have been done here. Issues found by reviewers have been fixed, and if no one objects, I'll set this to `positive_review` on the next iteration.

Best,

David

Mmh maybe... But it's weird though because I recompiled 7.3 a few days ago, then made a branch and pulled your branch from #13215. I have the latest version of this ticket on my local branch (commit 88196bf) and there's a file `rings.py` in `rings/polynomial`.
Even with my clean version of 7.3 as it's available from download (I always keep a clean version of the `develop` branch), I can find such a file...

Anyway, as `git log rings/polynomial/rings.py` returns nothing while `git log categories/rings.py` returns your commits, I probably messed up somewhere.

So, I guess we're good to go now.
If no one objects, I'll set this ticket to positive review.

In particular, his natural notion of evaluation is *not* operator evaluation, but rather right (resp. left) modulo of `x-a`.\n\nThis reminds me of the three approaches to evaluating a skew polynomial we discussed once before. One of them was, given a skew polynomial `p` and a point `a`, `p(a) = p.right_quo_rem(x-a)` (resp. left). Which I believe is what you are referring to? I think we now have the features to support this generalization of the remainder evaluation method in the non-commutative case. Or perhaps, we add an option to the `call` method. It takes as argument the algorithm \"remainder\" (or \"operator\") and default is set to one of them. That way the third approach of using normal basis can also be easily added if need be in the future.\n\nBest,\nArpit.",

Hi,

> Sorry to object, but I would like to re-insist on adding the experimental decorator on construction of skew polynomials. The reason is that I'm right now talking to a researcher in skew polynomials (Felice Manganiello), and he is making me aware of considerations that might mean some restructuring down the road. In particular, his natural notion of evaluation is *not* operator evaluation, but rather right (resp. left) modulo of `x-a`.

This reminds me of the three approaches to evaluating a skew polynomial we discussed once before. One of them was, given a skew polynomial `p` and a point `a`, `p(a) = p.right_quo_rem(x-a)` (resp. left). Which I believe is what you are referring to? I think we now have the features to support this generalization of the remainder evaluation method in the non-commutative case. Or perhaps, we add an option to the `call` method. It takes as argument the algorithm "remainder" (or "operator") and default is set to one of them. That way the third approach of using normal basis can also be easily added if need be in the future.

Best,
Arpit.

The bigger problem is that a skew polynomial itself does not pickle:

```
sage: R.<t> = ZZ[]
sage: sigma = R.hom([t+1])
sage: S.<x> = SkewPolynomialRing(R, sigma)
sage: loads(dumps(x))

PicklingError: Can't pickle <type 'dictproxy'>: attribute lookup __builtin__.dictproxy failed
```

With that being said, the above pickling issue with the Frobenius endomorphism is a separate issue that necessitates a ticket:

```
sage: loads(dumps(Frob))
Identity endomorphism of Finite Field in t of size 5^3
```
in addition to this independent issue:

```
sage: Frob.parent() is Hom(k, k)

sage: Hom(k, k)(Frob)

The (un)pickling of the Frobenius (well, perhaps its base class) is not setting the `_power` correctly:

```
sage: Frob.power()
1
sage: loads(dumps(Frob)).power()
0
```
The solution is probably to make the `__reduce__` less generic. This will need to be a separate ticket (which we don't have to make as a dependency of this one).

It is a \"local beta\", in that it says: \"you can count on this functionality being in Sage soon in roughly the same shape. If you want to use it already, be prepared that the API might change mildly\". It facilitates Request-for-comments from developers who believe they have well-designed some module, but acknowledge that they might not have considered everything. This goes doubly for math code, since any given math structure can be considered from so many angles, and usually the initial developer considers mostly just one. It allows building other new stuff on top of it (which we really need now: #20970), which postponing the ticket wouldn't, and that new stuff might not need an `@experimental` warning itself (for #20970, skew polynomials is just a tool, and its exact API has roughly no bearing on the API of the Gabidulin codes).\n\nThe decorator was originally suggested because without it, it is difficult to start introducing the \"basic\" modules on a new set of functionality, since one can only really judge its design once many things have been developed on top of it. This happened for us in coding theory, where we felt forced to have our own fork of Sage and develop for nine months before making the first pushes to Sage, greatly complicating the development process.\n\nSee also the discussion here:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/LXWs6KOw0Lk.\nThis ticket is exactly one of the intended use cases for this decorator.\n\nI still insist on the module-wide experimental warning here. I expect I will be active in polishing the skew polynomial module in the coming months, and I really don't want to be burdened/limited by deprecation considerations all the time. On the other hand, we really need this ticket to go into Sage to proceed with the GSoC, and at least >95% of the current functionality and API is good.",

If the behavior could undergo (radical) changes, then the code isn't (IMO) correct and should not be included.

> (Personally, I see very little use-cases for `@experimental` and no real use at the top-level. People who will actually experiment with the code will be those who can just get the code from the trac server (which requires no login). By marking something at the top-level, nobody will really use the code because there are no guarantees.)

I see we disagree on the `@experimental` decorator itself. It is a "local beta", in that it says: "you can count on this functionality being in Sage soon in roughly the same shape. If you want to use it already, be prepared that the API might change mildly". It facilitates Request-for-comments from developers who believe they have well-designed some module, but acknowledge that they might not have considered everything. This goes doubly for math code, since any given math structure can be considered from so many angles, and usually the initial developer considers mostly just one. It allows building other new stuff on top of it (which we really need now: #20970), which postponing the ticket wouldn't, and that new stuff might not need an `@experimental` warning itself (for #20970, skew polynomials is just a tool, and its exact API has roughly no bearing on the API of the Gabidulin codes).

The decorator was originally suggested because without it, it is difficult to start introducing the "basic" modules on a new set of functionality, since one can only really judge its design once many things have been developed on top of it. This happened for us in coding theory, where we felt forced to have our own fork of Sage and develop for nine months before making the first pushes to Sage, greatly complicating the development process.

See also the discussion here:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/LXWs6KOw0Lk.
This ticket is exactly one of the intended use cases for this decorator.

I still insist on the module-wide experimental warning here. I expect I will be active in polishing the skew polynomial module in the coming months, and I really don't want to be burdened/limited by deprecation considerations all the time. On the other hand, we really need this ticket to go into Sage to proceed with the GSoC, and at least >95% of the current functionality and API is good.

I don't consider the `__call__` discussion a major change. My current idea for accommodating multiple notions of evaluation would be to throw a warning/error when `__call__` is used before "setting" the default evaluation on the skew polynomial ring in question. That's a completely local change (local to `__call__`. But as I mentioned, I prefer to postpone that discussion to a later ticket.

I am somewhat shocked at how vehemently you are against the `@experimental` decorator. Discussion on sage-devel it is, I guess...

The discussion on sage-devel seems to have tapered off, so we need to take a decision here. We got two pieces of input: leif suggested a compromise with a warning in the doc, and wstein seemed to favour something like not pre-importing the module until the module is deemed "stable".

IMHO, neither of the two shared your concerns of not being able to build upon
the module, and seemed OK with the idea of accepting not-completely-stable code
into Sage. Conversely, they apparently didn't really like `@`experimental in the current form either.

I like both of the alternative suggestions less than just including the module and defining it as stable, handling any possible deprecation warnings that might arise in the near future. However, I still claim that using `@`experimental on the module is the right way to go.

But in the interest of progressing, I leave it to you Travis: if you are still strongly against a module-level `@`experimental, let's drop it. I guess you are still OK with having `@`experimental on `__call__`, together with a sensible message in the doc, e.g.

```
    WARNING::

        Currently only "operator evaluation" of skew polynomials is implemented. There are two other common notions of evaluation of `f(x)` at some `a` from the base ring, namely the remainder after left or right modulo by `x-a`. The current calling convention might change in the future to accommodate these.
```

Best,
Johan

Hello,

I've added the experimental warning to the `__call__` method manually based on the source code for `experimental` as suggested by @johanrosenkilde. There are a couple of doctests that "fail" because they issue the experimental warning before returning the correct answer. Should I modify the doctests or keep them as it is?

Best,
Arpit.

As David, I have my doubts about this too...

- You need to change the docstring of `_call` to reflect that its existence is only because of `@experimental`:

```
Helper function for the ``__call__`` method to accommodate
the ``@experimental`` decorator.
```
- I think you should make `operator_eval` into a `cpdef` method as it will likely be an important method (and should have a C version). You also need to change

  ```diff
  -(<RingElement> c)*a
  +c * a
  ```
  so the skew polynomial ring can support non-`RingElement` classes as a coefficients and to avoid an unneeded type check by Cython.
- You have added extra coercion checks for each step of things like `left_xgcd`. I feel that you would be better having a public method that does `@coerce_binop` and then private (`cdef`?) functions that assume both elements belong to the same parent.

Seems like the gain would currently be very small, since these methods now mostly do not call each other internally. If this changes later on, the private method can be added at this time.

Usual commutative polynomials have a `monic` method. This is the analogue for non-commutative polynomials.

However this feels it could be used in tight loops, and so while individual calls are marginal, the net sum over 10000 loops can add up. I leave it up to you.

Only for univariate, and in that case all it does is divide by the leading coefficient. However, in that case it extends the base ring so the leading coefficient is a unit, which is different than the behavior here. Also, I don't necessarily see the point of having `monic` in the public API for commutative polynomials (and don't take that as a guide for what must/should be included in the API).

It's mostly the relative gain that's important, which is still low as long as the functions don't call each other a lot.

I think it's a handy helper function that I think people will expect. I've used `monic` for univariate polynomials many times. (for multivariate polynomials, it's much more ambiguous what can be meant so the helper function is less useful).

I've made the `operator_eval` method a cpdef method. And I've edited the docstring to mention that it is a helper function to accommodate the `@experimental`decorator.

  At least I don't see a reason why must go `monic=True` as an argument (for everything but `left_xgcd`).
  Actually, I don't see why `left_xgcd` has unlimited number of arguments but `right_xgcd` does not.
- This change make it seem like there is one unique skew polynomial ring (to rule them all :P).

  ```diff
  -    Return the globally unique skew polynomial ring with given
  -    properties and variable name or names.
  +    Return the globally unique skew polynomial ring.
  ```
- The part about the general case not being implemented should be in a `.. NOTE::` or `.. WARNING::` block:

  ```diff
           r"""
           Return ``True`` if this skew polynomial is a unit.
   
  -        .. NOTE::
  +        When the base ring `R` is an integral domain, then a skew polynomial `f`
  +        is a unit if and only if degree of `f` is `0` and `f` is then a unit in
  +        `R`.
   
  -            When the base ring `R` is an integral domain, then a skew
  -            polynomial `f` is a unit if and only if degree of `f` is

- You should revert this change so we keep it under 80 characters/line:

  ```diff
               else:
                   return False
           else:

- You should not break <code>:trac:\`13215\`</code> across multiple lines (I might just be paranoid for this one though).
- AFAIK, only operator evaluation is implemented, so I don't understand this removal:

  ```diff
           .. NOTE::
   
  -            Currently, only "operator evaluation" of skew polynomials is implemented
  -            (see :meth:`.operator_eval`).
               There are two other common notions of evaluation of `f(x)` at some element `a`
               from the base ring, namely the remainder after left or right modulo by `x-a`.
  ```
- <code>\`__call__\`</code> is not latex, it should be <code>:meth:\`__call__\`</code> (or <code>\`\`__call__\`\`</code>).

Otherwise all your changes look good to me.

Indeed. I've chatted with Xavier, and the original reason for the "This parameter must be passed as named argument" (and perhaps the `*` in `left_xgcd`) is the broken behaviour of `coerce_binop`. This has now been fixed, see #21322. Therefore I've now set the doc and the code to what it should be as soon as #21322 is merged.

OK, that change was a bit fast ;-)

I found this overkill, which is why I removed it. But if you insist.

I disagree. It makes the source code look terrible. Also:

```
$ grep  '.\{80,\}' -r src/sage | grep "raise" | wc -l 
4703
```

So the 80 chars/line is defacto not a convention upheld in raise-statements.

Indeed. Emacs reflow doesn't understand Sphinx magic syntax probably doesn't allow line breaks :-)

The entirety of the `__call__` doc reads better now, IMHO: the first line clearly states that operator evaluation is considered. So the note doesn't need to repeat this.

Indeed.

Does #21322 need to be a dependency of this ticket then?

It makes the source code look fine if you are using < ~160 chars wide editors. We do try to stick to ~80 character lines overall in the code, but it is not absolute. Plus, there is a big difference between 90 chars and ~160 chars. IMO, a more fair comparison would be to look at how many `raise` statements are 80,90,100,100+ lines.

The key word is "only", and the `__call__` doc does not mention this (nor is it anywhere else IIRC).

I went through the docs once and clarified them in some places where it was not clear/missing and made some small changes to standardize the docs whereever possible.

Based on discussions with @xcaruso and @johanrosenkilde, the `def reverse` method is inappropriate in that, reversing a skew polynomial actually involves creating a new skew polynomial ring over the inverse twist map. And that requires more consideration since twist map cannot always be inverted in Sage and also perhaps since "dual_ring" or something like that could also be nice to have.

Best,
Arpit.

You made a change `.. TODO::` -> `.. NOTE::`, where the message is describing a TODO.

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A221):
> Does #21322 need to be a dependency of this ticket then?

Not in our opinion: what we do here is the intended behaviour of coerce_binop,
and the decorated methods works as well as all other methods in Sage decorated
with coerce_binop. So #21322 is just a (already known) bug that should be fixed.

> It makes the source code look fine if you are using < ~160 chars wide editors.

??? The line is 141 chars. Also, having a < 160 chars editor doesn't make the
old 4-line wrapping look good.

> We do try to stick to ~80 character lines overall in the code, but it is not

absolute.

Indeed my point before.

> Plus, there is a big difference between 90 chars and ~160 chars. IMO, a more
> fair comparison would be to look at how many `raise` statements are
> 80,90,100,100+ lines. I do not see the gain for the long line unless you have an

```
    $ grep  '.\{100,\}' -r src/sage | grep "raise" | wc -l
    1628

    $ grep  '.\{120,\}' -r src/sage | grep "raise" | wc -l
    588

    $ grep  '.\{140,\}' -r src/sage | grep "raise" | wc -l
    210
```

Also, btw:

```
    $ grep  '.\{140,\}' -r src/sage | wc -l
    10459
```

So it's not like you're not likely to come across a long line in your editor
while editing Sage codes.

It says "The current calling convention might change in the future to
accommodate these. Therefore, the current method has been marked as
experimental.". Try to read the doc-string in its entirety -- it really does say
everything.

Best,

It makes it more consistent and it is a standard way to split long lines of text by PEP8.

I can accept the 92 char lines as a compromise.

There are a number of lines that are forced to be long because they are large numbers with no spaces. Plus, I have no idea exactly how many lines of code we have in Sage, but this smells of a fallacy.

I very carefully had read it, and no, it does not say everything. It does not say that this is the *only* type of evaluation currently implemented. I know this is dangerously close to bikeshedding because this is only visible at the code level. Yet, I think it is important to state why we are (currently) doing things this way: there currently is no other option.

Sorry I have a bit of a stick up my @$* about this, but I'd like to get this right. So we don't have to deal with issues because someone came along and changed things due to a lack of documentation.

Anyways, I believe we are at a positive review.
