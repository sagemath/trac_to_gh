Seems ok.  Works on OS X  and sage.math.

I'm wondering whether 

```

 == Special Update/Build Instructions ==
  * setup.py change takes care of a few parsing issues and location issues
  * does this need to be reported upstream, or is it Sage-specific?
+ * #13603: Removed src/.DS_Store
```

should have just instructions to remove that if present, like the other bullet points in similar lists.

Note that now we have r-2.14.0.p6.spkg, and it seems to be gone. 

```
$ ls -aR | grep DS_Store
```
Also, apparently 2.7.1 R introduced

```

    o   R CMD build tries harder to clean up the inst/doc directory
        from the remnants of earlier builds.

        It also removes any directories with extension .Rcheck, and
        files .DS_Store and ._* (created by tar on Mac OS X under some
        circumstances: it now sets environment variables to ask for
        such files not to be created by that tar.)
```
So I think we can close this.  Sorry your spkg didn't get in, Paul-Olivier!  Though I guess I'm glad this was taken care of *up*stream.
