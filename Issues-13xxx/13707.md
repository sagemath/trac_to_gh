Reported by Timo Jolivet.

Sometimes the string representation is ambiguous:

```
sage: a = WordMorphism({1: [1, 2], 2: [12], 12: [1, 2]})
sage: print a
WordMorphism: 1->12, 12->12, 2->12
```

I just pushed a commit with one possible resolution. Roughly, I think that any resolution of this ambiguity should be along these lines. My logic was that potential ambiguities are more likely when the domain letters have length larger than 1. Whenever this occurs, the string representation should always use the letter separator (as defined in `WordOptions(letter_separator=',')`).

Now the behavior would be like

```
    sage: a = WordMorphism({1: [1, 2], 2: [12], 12:[1, 2]})
    sage: print(a)
    1->1,2, 12->1,2, 2->12
    sage: WordOptions(letter_separator=":")
    sage: print(a)
    1->1:2, 12->1:2, 2->12
```

I note however that this is not a very sophisticated idea. For example, we would also have

```
    sage: a = WordMorphism({1: [1, 3], 2: [12], 12:[1, 3], 3:1})
    sage: print(a)
    1->1,3, 12->1,3, 2->12, 3->1
```

+1 on fixing this. I don't think it is worth the trouble of being more precise about what could not be ambiguous. Although the ambiguity actually comes from higher up with printing the words:

```
sage: a(1)
word: 12
sage: a(2)
word: 12
sage: list(a(1))
[1, 2]
sage: list(a(2))
[12]
```
So I think it should be changed in printing the word to resolve ambiguities there.
