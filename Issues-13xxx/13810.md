```
In 5.4, with KASH installed:

```
NumberField(x^21-2, 'a').galois_group(type="pari").order()
```
gives answer 252, but with

```
NumberField(x^22-2, 'a').galois_group(type="pari").order()
```
I got

```
Error, the variable '_s_' must have a value
```
I guess this relates to kash interface.

There has been some other modifications on `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_rational_flint.pyx` that conflicts with this patch.

In any case, http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~kant/.3a6ca5.html clearly says that polynomials up to degree 23 are supported. But just changing given example `x_O:=MaximalOrder(X^2+5); Galois(x_O);` to have `x^23+5` gives segfault and degree 22 get stuck. So I suggests trying KASH only when degree <= 21.
