Some doctests are marked

```
# optional - gcc
```
but it seems reasonable to require `gcc` for doctests.  After all, compiling Cython code is an integral part of Sage.  Indeed, many doctests already fail without `gcc`.

Unfortunately, this exposes #12446, so we need "`# known bug`".

The problem is that there are quite a few doctests *already in Sage* which require a C/C++/Fortran compiler.  So we certainly could mark all those "# optional - foo compiler".  But then a lot of tests would be missed in normal doctesting.  For example, #12446 would not have happened if the "# optional - gcc" wasn't there.

I think it's not too much to ask for a user to have binutils installed in order to run Sage doctests. Why only binutils? If #13515 is merged (which will happen, since it's a blocker), we can ship all the needed *compilers* with Sage, which means the host system only needs to provide binutils (assembler, linker, archiver...)

A different —more pragmatic— answer is the following: if a user doesn't have a compiler toolchain, he is very unlikely to be a Sage developer.  Why would a non-Sage-developer want to run all doctests?

The only way to have a working Sage without gcc is to download a binary.  For this obscure platform, there won't be binaries, so you need gcc to build Sage in the first place.
