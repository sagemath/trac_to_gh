[See #15608 for a list of open simon_two_descent tickets]

The current upper bound in `rank_bounds` do not take into account two torsion. This corrects this and thus gives a tighter upper bound.

I do think that Simon's scripts already take 2-torsion into account, even though he returns 2-torsion points in the list of gens (which I remember filtering out).  Needs checking though.

A simple example:

```
sage: K.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([2+3*i,0])
sage: E.simon_two_descent()
(0, 1, [(0 : 0 : 1), (0 : 0 : 1)])
sage: E.rank_bounds()
(0, 1)
sage: Em = magma(E)
sage: Em.TwoSelmerGroup()
Abelian Group isomorphic to Z/2
...
```

Simon's script returns indeed as the second argument the dimension of the 2-Selmer group and currently `rank_bounds` copies that. So the supposed change here is indeed good. However, we need to add an example in the doctest, too.

Furthermore, I will correct a few other things there, while I am at it.
