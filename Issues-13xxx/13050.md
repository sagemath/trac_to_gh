Keywords: sd40.5 mpmath pari erf

In #1173 an mpmath numerical evaluator for `erf` was written by Douglas McNeil. This ticket proposes to save that code, incorporate it with the ability to pass an `algorithm` parameter to `numerical_approx` from #12289.  We could support Pari, mpmath, and Maxima.

It would even be useful to see where Pari is faster.

This looks like a duplicate of #1173 to me.

I think that the point of this ticket was to do some of the things at #1173 more quickly, or using a different infrastructure, or something.  Ben, what was the rationale exactly?

I think that we can repurpose this ticket to adding the algorithm keyword here.  Some good examples from #1173 (most were added in #13001):

```
Verify we're returning the appropriate zero:: 

            sage: erf(0) 
            0 
            sage: erf(0.0) 
            0.000000000000000 
            sage: erf(RealField(100)(0)) 
            0.00000000000000000000000000000 
```

```
set(erf(45*10**i).n() for i in range(10)) 
```

```
sage: CC(erf(ComplexField(1000)(2+3j))) 
```
