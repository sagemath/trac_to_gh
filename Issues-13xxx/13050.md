In #1173 an mpmath numerical evaluator for `erf` was written by Douglas McNeil. This ticket proposes to save that code, incorporate it with the ability to pass an `algorithm` parameter to `numerical_approx` from #12289.  We could support Pari, mpmath, and Maxima.

It would even be useful to see where Pari is faster.

I think that the point of this ticket was to do some of the things at #1173 more quickly, or using a different infrastructure, or something.  Ben, what was the rationale exactly?
