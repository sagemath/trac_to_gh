#12791 introduced a bug in the graph tensor_product if the graph is an undirected graph (only half the edges get added).  The bad thing was there was a test that would have uncovered this, but the test output was wrong, so apparently wasn't checked by hand!

I have a patch, but I'm waiting to hear from the person that mentioned this bug to me about who I should credit.
