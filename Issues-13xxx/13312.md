The .polar() method of the Polyhedron class is incorrect, currently it returns the inversion of the correct answer.  Thanks to sarah-marie belcastro for pointing this out.

Another bugfix/improvement is adding support for negation, which inverts polyhedra.  Implementing this revealed that scalar multiplication by negative numbers gave incorrect answers for polyhedra with rays.

Finally this adds a convenience function for obtained faces in terms of vertex and inequality indices.

Patch applies to sage-5.3.beta1, I'm building sage-5.3.rc0 now to see if there is any issue.

I thought about how to handle things and I'd like to
* Not make PolyhedronFace derive from polyhedron - can be confusing as not every `Polyhedron` method makes sense.
* The PolyhedronFace should have a `polyhedron()` method to get it as a polyhedron without reference to ambient
* Other methods `outward_normal()` or `offset_polyhedron()` (exploded?), `plot(color)` to implement what you want.
Thoughts?

Yooooooooooooo !!

I agree with this patch, though I don't understand one bit : why this change in `.polar` ?

```python
-  verts = [list(v.vector() - self.center()) for v in self.vertex_generator()]
+  verts = [list(self.center() - v.vector()) for v in self.vertex_generator()]
```

If it is just to have your example of code work, shouldn't you change the constructor instead ?

By the way, running `polytopes.n_cube(3).show()` just gives me a black Jmol window. I mean, empty. It's like the world is missing a cube.
