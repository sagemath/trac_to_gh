This patch adds the PALP normal form algorithm natively into the `lattice_polytope` class, as well as a modified algorithm that is more efficient for some polytopes. This is then also used directly to calculate a normal form for Laurent polynomials.

These algorithms require abilities to permute rows and columns of matrices, as well as find automorphisms of matrices under these operations, and lattice polytopes under GL(n,Z) transformations. These are also implemented here.

Apply the latest patch only.

Very nice! Thanks for tackling this, I always wanted this implemented!

Some minor nitpicks: Whenever you return a list of stuff, its better to return a tuple (which is immutable).

```
def matrix_transformation(self,NewPolytope): 
```
CamelCase should only be used for class names, not parameters. Also, space after comma. Thats just the standard Python code style.

```
def lexicographical_order(self,certify=False): 
```
The name is a bit confusing, how about `permutation_normal_form()` or something like that?


```
def is_isomorphic(self,N,certify=False): 
```
The linear algebra people will probably object to that kind of isomorphism check of matrices. How about `is_permutation_of()`?

```
By default, in general one can't mix matrices and permutations
```
Should be just "in general, ...".

PS. Well, I am very curious to find out what it is. That's one of the reasons I ask :–)

Volker kindly [wrote](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/3o7vRy2FByI/pLPEAPgNbn4J):
See Section 3.4 of http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9805190.pdf for the definition of the PALP normal form. 
So this would be a reference to add.

I have one brief remark about the method *automorphisms()*. If I see this correctly, you build the complete face lattice, compute its automorphism group (i.e. the combinatorial automorphism group of the polytope) and filter those permutations that correspond to GL(n,ZZ)-transformations.

There seems to be already a method of *Polyhedron* that computes the combinatorial automorphism group, so you could use this method. For the combinatorial automorphisms of the polytope you don't need the whole face lattice, but the bipartite vertex-facet-incidence graph is enough.

I think that, depending on the polytope, either the size of the face lattice or the number of group elements will cause problems if you go to dimensions beyond the PALP limit.

This is one of the main reasons of having implemented the PALP algorithm natively, the overflow errors that PALP is susceptible to in higher dimensions is removed when running the algorithm through python.

I have tried to rebase the patch and, in particular, tried to adapt to the changes from #14319. However, automorphisms of LatticePolytopes do not work yet and there is probably much code that could be rewritten.

As far as the code in lattice_polytope.py is concerned, I've only reformated and not checked what the code actually does.
The same is true for all other normal_form methods.

Alright, I think I am more or less done rewriting the patch. I have
* removed functionality for Laurent normal form and finding isomorphisms between LatticePolytopes. These were broken and at least the latter will be reintroduced (in more general form) in #15280
* restructured the _palp* methods for computing normal forms in lattice_polytope.py
* rebased and partially rewritten the code and tried to use the common formatting conventions
* included permutation read-out directly from PALP
* extended docstrings and tests

There are some issues:
Two key functions, namely LatticePolytopeClass._palp_normal_form_native and Matrix.permutation_normal_form, both of which calculate the maximal form of a matrix under permutations of columns and rows have fairly tense bits of code and I did not understand everything.
While I verified that after fixing a couple of small errors they now give the correct results for several thousand examples, there may additional bugs. There might also be potential for optimization.

What should be done in this case?
