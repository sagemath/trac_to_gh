Hi John,

Yes, you are right about that. All this assumed that the function field was generated by the field of functions with Fourier coefficients in QQ, and even used that as the definition of the rational model. So it does not directly apply to your example. However, on a quick reading, I can't find where the documentation claims that it does apply to all modular curves. In any case, you are right that a warning in the documentation is in order. Something like "This only gives well-defined cusps if the field of functions is generated by functions with rational Fourier expansions, such as for Gamma = ...."?

At the same time, maybe the output is not completely bogus even in your example. Does the following interpretation make sense?

Your curve has a model over a cubic field, and Gal(QQab / QQ) acts by sending cusps of your curve to cusps of Galois conjugates of your curve. So even though (2 mod 13)*c1 is not equivalent to (2 mod 13)*c2 modulo A_4, it is equivalent modulo some conjugate of A_4.

This would be a GL_2(ZZ/13ZZ) conjugate of A_4 corresponding to a Gal =[ (ZZ/13ZZ) / cubes ] conjugate of your curve.

Hi, I think this error slipt in because I'm more used to thinking something that I will denote by X'(N). Namely the modular curve that parametrized Z/NZxZ/NZ immersions. The action of galois is trivial on Z/NZxZ/NZ there are no problems in this case since for a congruence subgroup Gamma \supset Gamma(N) one can define the quotient X'(N)/(Gamma/ Gamma(N)) and in this way the galois action on the cusps is compatible between all modular curves.

This X'(N) has some disadvantages, namely its not geometrically connected and hence not a model of H^*/Gamma(N), but instead it's a model of several copies of H^*/Gamma(N). What is used in sage is the modular curve X(N) that parametrizes mu_NxZ/NZ immersions together with some condition on the weil paring. This X(N) this will be an irreducible component of my X'(N) after base change to Q(zeta_N) 

Now in sage I just didn't think about the fact that the action of GL_2(Z/NZ) cannot be defined on mu_NxZ/NZ and hence that it is not possible to define an arbitrary modular curve of level N as X(N)/(Gamma/ Gamma(N)) since this will mess up the galois action as John mentioned.

I wonder whether the condition mentioned by John that:

     The field of modular functions for the group in question is generated by functions whose Q-expansions have rational coefficients.

Is equivalent with the condition:

    H/Gamma can be given a model over Q such that X(N)=H/Gamma(N) -> H/Gamma is defined over Q.

I think John's condition "the field of modular functions is generated by functions whose q-expansions have rational coefficients" is equivalent to "the subgroup of SL2( Z / N ) corresponding to Gamma is normalized by [1, 0; 0, x] for every x in (Z / N)*".

If we want to do this properly, we should make galois_action take more data about the modular curve in its arguments, rather than trying to make the answer be valid for all modular curves simultaneously, which is impossible.

Perhaps we need to have some new classes defined, inheriting from the base class Cusp (which just means an element of `P^1(QQ)`), which refers to a specific congruence subgroup.  Then some cusp functions, including equality and Galois action, could be over-ridden in that class.

Doing this properly and well would not be very easy, I think!

In fact, it depends on a choice that is usually only made implicitly.  Namely, a modular curve *X<sub>H</sub>* of level *n* is defined by a subgroup *H* of GL<sub>2</sub>(**Z**/*n***Z**).  The natural field of definition of *X<sub>H</sub>* is *K<sub>H</sub>* = **Q**(\u03b6<sub>n</sub>)^det *H*^.  To get a modular curve defined over **Q**, we therefore need the determinant to be surjective.  Let *H*<sub>1</sub> be the group of matrices of determinant 1 in *H*.

In the context of embeddings of (**Z**/*n***Z**)<sup>2</sup> into elliptic curves, this corresponds to marking the point of order *n* which is the image of the second basis vector.\n\nFor general *H*, not necessarily with surjective determinant, there is an action of Gal(**Q**(\u03b6<sub>n</sub>)/*K<sub>H</sub>*) = det *H* on the set of cusps.

Compute *w* = *g*(*sv*); this is still a primitive column vector.  Lift *w* to a primitive column vector *x* over **Z**.

This is consistent with David's remark above.  For a general congruence subgroup, one first has to extend its image in SL<sub>2</sub>(**Z**/*n***Z**) to a group *H* as above (with appropriate image of the determinant, possibly giving a larger base field than **Q**).  Second, one has to implement choosing the element *g* as above.\n\nTo implement this in complete generality, we would have to allow the user to construct the modular group by giving a subgroup *H* of GL<sub>2</sub>(**Z**/*n***Z**), not just a congruence subgroup.",

It is certainly true that the Galois action depends on more than just the element of **P**<sup>1</sup>(**Q**).  In fact, it depends on a choice that is usually only made implicitly.  Namely, a modular curve *X<sub>H</sub>* of level *n* is defined by a subgroup *H* of GL<sub>2</sub>(**Z**/*n***Z**).  The natural field of definition of *X<sub>H</sub>* is *K<sub>H</sub>* = **Q**(ζ<sub>n</sub>)^det *H*^.  To get a modular curve defined over **Q**, we therefore need the determinant to be surjective.  Let *H*<sub>1</sub> be the group of matrices of determinant 1 in *H*.  When starting from a congruence subgroup, one gets *H*<sub>1</sub> instead of *H*; one needs to specify how to extend this to a subgroup *H* as above.

For Γ<sub>1</sub>(n), the *H* that one needs to take to get the usual modular curve *X*<sub>1</sub>(*n*) is the subgroup of GL<sub>2</sub>(**Z**/*n***Z**) consisting of the matrices with bottom row (0 1).  In the context of embeddings of (**Z**/*n***Z**)<sup>2</sup> into elliptic curves, this corresponds to marking the point of order *n* which is the image of the second basis vector.

For general *H*, not necessarily with surjective determinant, there is an action of Gal(**Q**(ζ<sub>n</sub>)/*K<sub>H</sub>*) = det *H* on the set of cusps.  The recipe for computing it is as follows, if my back-of-the-envelope calculation is correct.

Let *s* be in det *H* and let *a*/*b* be in **P**<sup>1</sup>(**Q**).  Choose a matrix *g* in *H* of determinant *s*<sup>-1</sup> in det *H*.  Map *a*/*b* in the obvious way to a primitive column vector *v* over **Z**/*n***Z**.  Compute *w* = *g*(*sv*); this is still a primitive column vector.  Lift *w* to a primitive column vector *x* over **Z**.  Finally, map *x* in the obvious way to an element of **P**<sup>1</sup>(**Q**).  This represents the desired cusp obtained by applying the Galois automorphism corresponding to *s* to the cusp *a*/*b*.

In the case of the usual congruence subgroups, one can take *g* to be the diagonal matrix with (*s*<sup>-1</sup> 1) on the diagonal.  This is consistent with David's remark above.  For a general congruence subgroup, one first has to extend its image in SL<sub>2</sub>(**Z**/*n***Z**) to a group *H* as above (with appropriate image of the determinant, possibly giving a larger base field than **Q**).  Second, one has to implement choosing the element *g* as above.

To implement this in complete generality, we would have to allow the user to construct the modular group by giving a subgroup *H* of GL<sub>2</sub>(**Z**/*n***Z**), not just a congruence subgroup.

I think Peter's envelope calculation agrees with what I did with my level 13 example.

Whatever else we do, I think that the mathematical content of this ticket (and #13253) is rather higher than most, and at some point we ought to collectively write a full account of our conclusions, since these issues are not (as far as I know) discussed in such explicit detail in any books.
