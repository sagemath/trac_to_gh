User 'Mathemage' reports at [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1611/existence-of-a-limit) that

```
sage: bool( lim(sin(x), x=oo) == ind)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

NameError: name 'ind' is not defined
```
and indeed although Maxima outputs this for similar limits, we do not have a conversion.  

What the heck would we do with it, anyway?  Does any other Sage subsystem have such an element?  Does Maxima even have it, or just print it?  Anyway, worth exploring.
