```
Polynomial sequences over GF(2) should have a solve method which supports solving via

* Gröbner bases (PolyBoRi)
* SAT solving (CryptoMiniSat and friends)
* exhaustive search (FES library)
* ~~(Mixed Integer Programming) (Sage's MIP stuff and SCIP)~~

All these interfaces exist, they only need to be properly exposed.

Very nice! But the optional arguments are not correct:

```
./sage -t --show-skipped multi_polynomial_sequence.py
```

i.e. the "needs" is incorrect.
