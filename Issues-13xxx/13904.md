In #715, `TripleDict` has been modified, so that the key items are compared by identity rather than equality, and so that weak keys are used when possible.

However, as it turns out, the deletion of the items tracked in a `TripleDict` was done improperly. The aim of this ticket is to fix that.

Superseded by #13387.

There's the more severe problem that during GC cleanup, a weakref callback could lead to the deletion of a non-weakreffable key, which could retrigger the dealloc of the object that has just generated the weakref. That would lead to a double dealloc.

The following might be a solution:
- equip TripleDict with an attribute `self.deathrow=[]`.
- when TripleDictEraser finds itself removing a non-weakreffed key (other than None, int, float, etc), it appends the key to `self.deathrow` instead.
This way, we don't trigger the deletion (and the whole cascade that may follow) in the callback.

Deathrow will be cleaned up eventually, as part of the regular cleanup code for deallocation of TripleDict.

The problem is that weakref callback operates in a strange environment: There is a dealloc call higher up the stack somewhere. Normally python code doesn't run under those circumstances. It shouldn't make much difference, but you should *absolutely not* delete that object again. Hence, I think the default should be: Don't delete objects in callback. You can modify this rule, but only on a case-by-case basis, by carefully reasoning that the deletions that you do allow won't lead to nasty unpredictable deletion cascades.

Nils, indeed it might be an idea to use the ideas from #13387. However, the ticket here is not about optimization.

Anyway.

I am starting with Sage's debug version as in #13864. With the first patch applied, one gets a crash in modules/module.pyx

With both patches applied, one gets

```
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/modules/module.pyx"          
         [3.5 s]
```
So, that looks like a progress.

However, at least with a slightly different version of the first patch, make ptest still results in

```
        sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_point.py # Killed/crashed
        sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/algebras/free_algebra_quotient.py # Killed/crashed
        sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/algebras/free_algebra_quotient_element.py # Killed/crashed
        sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/categories/modules_with_basis.py # Killed/crashed
        sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/categories/homset.py # 1 doctests failed
```
when both patches are applied. Note, however, that I can *not* reproduce these crashes when I run them independently.

Hence, one needs to dig deeper. See[comment:1](#comment%3A1).

Let's say we have a key `(A,B,C)`, where `A` is weakrefed and got deleted, so that the key `(A,B,C)` gets removed by means of `A`'s callback function. Now let `B` be non-weakrefable.

One could provide a new method `TripleDict.kill_deathrow`, that will be called in any other method of `TripleDict`. Hence, the deletions would occur when the `TripleDict` will be used another time, and in particular this will only happen *after* the "dealloc call higher up the stack" has been completed.

Perhaps `kill_deathrow` could also be called at the beginning of the callback function - so that it performs the deletions that were scheduled by the preceding callback function.

Problem could be a severe slow-down.

The cython-induced crash has only weakreffable keys. The hypothetical behaviour *has not been observed*.

> One could provide a new method `TripleDict.kill_deathrow`, that will be called in any other method of `TripleDict`. Hence, the deletions would occur when the `TripleDict` will be used another time, and in particular this will only happen *after* the "dealloc call higher up the stack" has been completed.


But arbitrary code can be executed during weakref callbacks, including arbitrary `TripleDict` operations. So you'd never be sure if it's safe to kill `deathrow`. 

Really, this is starting to look more like a design deficiency in CPython: it should really mark objects on which dealloc is running to prevent GC, decref, whatever, from reentering dealloc. Preventing this by code protocol just seems to unduly restrict allowed data structures.

> Perhaps `kill_deathrow` could also be called at the beginning of the callback function - so that it performs the deletions that were scheduled by the preceding callback function.


You wouldn't be sure that deathrow entries are now safe to delete ...

**EXECUTIVE DECISION:** we mandate that key components to `TripleDict` be either weakreffable or do not hold references to other objects (i.e., are non container-types). Perhaps we can relax this rule once we come up with a smart mechanism.

The "debug_only" patch is updated. With it, I tried the following:

```
sage: cython("""
....: cdef class A:
....:     cdef object x
....:     def __init__(self, x):
....:         self.x = x
....: """)
sage: import gc
sage: from sage.structure.coerce_dict import TripleDict
sage: T = TripleDict(31)
sage: while(1):
....:     b = B()
....:     a = A(b)
....:     T[b,a,None] = a
....:     del a,b
....:     foo = gc.collect()
....:     
```

That should be exactly the theoretical situation you were describing, isn't it?

But there is no crash. When I interrupt it after a while, with Ctrl-C, I get

```
sage: len(T)
1681
```
This I don't understand. Is `TripleDict` broken, in the sense of it doesn't allow its weak keys be cleared??

No, nothing is broken. You haven't included the definition of `B`, but I assume it's a weakreffable type.

Although you delete `a,b`, your dictionary `T` is still holding a strong reference to `a` (because it can't weakref it) and `a` is holding a strong reference to `b`, so `b` is reachable. Nothing gets collected.

Attachment [trac13904_use_del.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket13904/trac13904_use_del.patch) by @simon-king-jena created at 2013-01-21 10:10:44

I think using `del` rather than calling `__delitem__` makes sense even though the segfaults from #715 seem to be fixed by the Cython upgrade: Apparently `del` results in shorter C code.

The new patch uses `del` both on `TripleDict` and the new `MonoDict`, hence, it depends on #12313, where the latter was introduced.
