## Task

* no longer ship pyOpenSSL with sagenb (this will be taken care of in #13121)
* no longer require OpenSSL dev headers in prereq

## Rationale

`notebook(secure=True)` is rarely used, and is not even really that desirable to use, except for people setting up multiuser Sage servers, which is a small percentage of Sage users. Therefore we will require users who want to use `notebook(secure=True)` to perform the additional step of installing pyOpenSSL into Sage's Python. This allows us to get rid of our sort of problematic dependencies on OpenSSL.

So far

```
sage -i openssl
```
was sufficient (in 5.2 and later), but if this could be done automatically during build, it would be awesome.

<a id='comment:8'></a>
So what needs doing here?

Root repo:
- remove the spkgs, modify `deps` and `spkg/install` accordingly
- modify prereq so it no longer checks for openssl (i.e., undo some of the changes at #13329)
- in README.txt, document what needs to be done to use the secure notebook
- possibly add a new target to the Makefile

Sage library:
- in the installation guide, document what needs to be done to use the secure notebook

Sagenb:
- make it work without openssl

Anything else?

Looking at sagenb's README.rst, I notice that besides HTTPS notebook login, OpenSSL is also used by OpenID authentication, this time through Python's bundled ssl module rather than through pyOpenSSL.

This means that if a user wanted to use OpenID authentication on their server, they'd have to install OpenSSL dev headers on their system (or install the optional openssl SPKG) and then rebuild Python, which is a bit involved. This should also be included in the "ssl" makefile target, I guess. Preferably the "ssl" makefile target shouldn't build Python twice.

So the "ssl" target should install openssl, then build Sage, then install pyopenssl. Fortunately, the openssl spkg has very few requirements: patch should be enough, I think (and patch is necessary on Solaris, at least: the system's patch is brain-dead).

So if the ssl makefile target should include openssl, perhaps it should run a script to download the spkg and then maybe modify spkg/standard/deps, adding openssl in the appropriate place (after patch). Or maybe, given the change at #13373, you could add three (?) new targets:

- "patch", which does `./sage -i patch`
- "openssl", which has patch as a prerequisite and does `./sage -i openssl`
- "sslbuild", which has openssl as a prerequisite and just builds Sage.

Then "ssl" would have "sslbuild" as a dependency and would do `./sage -i pyopenssl`. This all seems kind of clunky, especially since we should only install openssl if necessary.

Other ideas: 
- force the user to read README.txt and install openssl manually (`./sage -i patch; ./sage -i openssl`), and then `make ssl` will take care of everything else, by building Sage and installing pyopenssl.
- include a script to check whether openssl is present, and run it as part of `make ssl`. If openssl is not present, exit and tell the user to install it.

(Wouldn't it be nice if Sage used configure? Then the user could do `./configure --ssl=True; make` and the script would figure out whether openssl was necessary, and also install pyopenssl at the end.)

I am reading the documentation and from what I understand of it, shouldn't this line be part of the ssl section of the `Makefile`?

```
./sage -f python # after ./sage -i openssl
```

Then the documentation can be simplified to:

```
1. If you don't have OpenSSL development headers installed, then run
make ssl
to get a local copy of OpenSSL and pyOpenSSL within your Sage installation.

2. If you have OpenSSL development headers installed, but pyOpenSSL is not installed,
then you can run
./sage -i pyopenssl
to install it.
```

Volker, does your third option involve gutting the upstream source and only shipping the header files, or can we also build and install the actual libraries if OpenSSL exists on the system? If the latter, then even if OpenSSL doesn't exist on the system, aren't we, by hosting the SPKG, still "distributing OpenSSL", since the user could just untar the SPKG and run `make && sudo make install` in the src directory?

It could be that we're violating the GPL, yes.  But it's not really clear to me, who knows?

I do think that adding the `ssl` make target doesn't change much, since it just automates something which is already possible anyway.
