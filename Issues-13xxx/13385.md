## Task

* no longer ship pyOpenSSL with sagenb (this will be taken care of in #13121)
* no longer require OpenSSL dev headers in prereq

## Rationale

`notebook(secure=True)` is rarely used, and is not even really that desirable to use, except for people setting up multiuser Sage servers, which is a small percentage of Sage users. Therefore we will require users who want to use `notebook(secure=True)` to perform the additional step of installing pyOpenSSL into Sage's Python. This allows us to get rid of our sort of problematic dependencies on OpenSSL.

So far

```
sage -i openssl
```
was sufficient (in 5.2 and later), but if this could be done automatically during build, it would be awesome.

<a id='comment:8'></a>So what needs doing here?

Root repo:
- remove the spkgs, modify `deps` and `spkg/install` accordingly
- modify prereq so it no longer checks for openssl (i.e., undo some of the changes at #13329)
- in README.txt, document what needs to be done to use the secure notebook
- possibly add a new target to the Makefile

Sage library:
- in the installation guide, document what needs to be done to use the secure notebook

Sagenb:
- make it work without openssl

Anything else?

It could be that we're violating the GPL, yes.  But it's not really clear to me, who knows?

I do think that adding the `ssl` make target doesn't change much, since it just automates something which is already possible anyway.
