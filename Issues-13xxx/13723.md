Hamming weights are defined in sage.coding.linear_codes for vectors. This is the wrong place, since we can not use the implementation specific structure of a vector, for example in the binary case.

This patch adds a function hamming_weight to the class sage.modules.free_module_element.FreeModuleElement and deprecates  sage.coding.linear_codes.hamming_weight.

You need to deprecate the top level function (which you have already done) and not remove it entirely. The removal can happen after the deprecation period is over (typically 1 year).

Anyway, the question is whether it should be deprecated. There is nothing wrong with having it both as `v.hamming_weight()` and as a global function `hamming_weight(v)`. In the latter case, you could modify the function to use the attribute if it is available:

```python
def hamming_weight(v): # the function in sage/coding/
    try:
        return v.hamming_weight()
    except AttributeError:
        # the old code comes here
```

Ok. I missed the fact that you haven't removed it from global scope.

There are three comments I have about the patch (sorry for nitpicking :)):
1. It is missing the hg headers containing your name and other information. Maybe you don't have a hgrc? Also, the patch should have the ticket number in its name (like `trac_13723-hamming_weight.patch` or `13273-hamming_weight.patch`). If I am not mistaken Jeroen has some script which parses the patch name to get the ticket number. Since you have already made this patch, you can simply rename it using hg like

```
$ cd <sage_root>/devel/sage
$ hg qmv hamming_weight_simplex_code.patch trac_13723-hamming_weight.patch
-- OR if you don't have hg installed in your system --
$ sage -hg qmv hamming_weight_simplex_code.patch trac_13723-hamming_weight.patch
```
2. In the example in `vector_mod2_dense.pyx` file, the answer should be 2.
3. Can you fix the `type(v) == list` statements with `isinstance(v, list)`? It is not your mistake, but it would be nice to have them fixed.

Otherwise the patch looks fine to me.

It is ok, I learned a lot from those comments.

Of course, thanks.

Sorry but it's my turn to be nitpicking. There's some documentation things I would like to see addressed:

- It should be <code>:trac:\`13723\`</code>, the `#` is added automatically and as you have it written, the link is incorrect as it includes the `#`.
- I prefer to see everything set it code format/linked as much as possible:
  - In the authors section: <code>Added :meth:\`CLASSNAME.hamming_weight\`</code> or <code>Added \`\`hamming_weight()\`\`</code>
  - Change all appropriate lines:

  ```
  Return the number of positions ``i`` such that ``self[i] != 0``.
  ```
- I don't like the deprecation message. Perhaps something like

```
The global function hamming_weight(v) is deprecated, instead use v.hamming_weight().
```

Thanks,

Travis
