The following code produces a SIGABRT:

```
sage: R = Zp(5,5)
sage: S.<x> = R[]
sage: f = x^5 + 75*x^3 - 15*x^2 +125*x - 5
sage: W.<w> = R.ext(f)
sage: z = (1+w)^5
sage: y = z - 1
sage: t=y-y
sage: t.unit_part()
fatal error:
   internal error: can't grow this _ntl_gbigint
exit...
```

I added print statements, and it seems that the line

```
ans.unit = self.unit
```
is causing the trouble.

I have no clue what could be the problem here. Do you have any hints?

The problem is that `_normalize` deletes `self.unit` if there's no relative precision, since NTL can't handle modulus 5<sup>0</sup>.  The attached patch fixes the problem and adds some documentation for fixed modulus elements.
