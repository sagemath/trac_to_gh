There is a lot of inconsistency between the methods in `Graphics` class. Is there any reason to not have the methods be better named? The old method names could be still kept around for backward compatibility.
0. `old_method -> new method(s)`
1. `aspect_ratio -> get_aspect_ratio`
2. `axes* -> get_axes*, set_axes*`
3. `fontsize -> get_fontsize, set_fontsize`
4. `-> set_minmax_data`
5. `legend -> set_legend, get_legend`
6. `-> get_legend_options`
7. `tick_label_color -> set_tick_label_color, get_tick_label_color`
8. `xmax/xmin/ymax/ymin -> get/set_xmax/xmin/ymax/ymin`

The following methods are good:
1. `get/set_aspect_ratio`
2. `get/set_axes_range`
3. `set_legend_options`

Actually, `set_legend_options` apparently works like `get/set_legend_options` depending on whether an input is provided.
