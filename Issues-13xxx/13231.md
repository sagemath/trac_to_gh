Define is_atomic to check whether a lattice is atomic. There seems to be some ambiguity as to what 'atomic' means. Wikipedia makes a distinction between atomic posets, where each element lies above an atom, and 'atomistic' lattices, where every element is a join of atoms. This is_atomic checks the latter, which coincides with Stanley's usage in EC1.
