There was a discussion on sage-devel a while ago about including the Boost headers [1]. As noted there, the latest version of the optional spkg `polymake` doesn't compile with the current boost package. The current boost package is called `boost-cropped` because it contains only a subset of the boost headers, because of package size.

This new package is contains *all* headers, which is still only a subset of the upstream tarball. The total packaged size is ~ 5M, which feels reasonable to me.

I've checked that the current version `polybori-0.8.2` and the current upstream version `polymake-2.12-rc3` both compile under Sage with these headers. I'm also submitting an spkg for polymake in another ticket.

I attached a patch doing just that. I don't know how to instruct the patchbot to apply this to sage_root, and it wouldn't work anyway since it needs the new spkg. Let me know if I can do anything more, though.

Note that the file spkg/Makefile is automatically generated, so I didn't patch it.

Since we're doing a rather large update 1.34 - > 1.52, it's quite possible that the implementation has changed sufficiently to obtain different random values even with the same seed.\n\nI would be inclined to just update the doctests, since these are inherently random results. But I would prefer to first hear the opinion of someone who actually uses polybori.",

Yes, I'm pretty sure it has: I can reproduce this issue on my stock 5.5 installation with upgraded boost and recompiled polybori.

The reason is possibly that polybori probably relies on `Boost.Random` for its randomness. Since we're doing a rather large update 1.34 - > 1.52, it's quite possible that the implementation has changed sufficiently to obtain different random values even with the same seed.

I would be inclined to just update the doctests, since these are inherently random results. But I would prefer to first hear the opinion of someone who actually uses polybori.

These random ;-) changes in `PolyBoRi`'s random functions won't cause any problems.

But maybe we should just ignore the doctest results and add additional tests for the following assumed properties `result =  random_set(monomial, n)` should obey
`len(result) == n` and `result.diff(monomial.divisors()).empty()` .

No, because it didn't say to.  Maybe there should be something that retriggers this on update?  Anyway, works fine now, sorry for the noise (on the way to #13768...)
