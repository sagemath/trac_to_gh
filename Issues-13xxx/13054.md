PARI's `polred()` returns reducible polynomials.  GP session:

```
gp> pol = x^4 - 4294967296*x^2 + 54265257667816538374400;
gp> L = polred(pol);
gp> factor(L[4])
%14 =
[x^2 + 211955648366398871041 2]
```

This bug causes problem with arithmetic over `QQbar`:

Line 1563 (5.1.beta0) of sage/rings/qqbar.py:

```
rev = parent(best_elt.Mod(pari_poly).modreverse().lift())
```

Here, we are calling `modreverse()` on a element of a subfield. It would make a lot of exact linear algebra **much** more reliable if this was resolved.

This is not the same bug as above, but could be another symptom.  Still hunting for an example to grab onto.  

Run

```
n = 3
A = matrix(QQbar, n, n, [i/(i+1) + (i^2+3)*I for i in range(n^2)])
ev = A.eigenvalues()
(A-ev[0]).rref()
```

which should hangup and when killed with Ctrl-C yields

```

Found in [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/4b5aaadddf01db5d?hl=en)

```
sage: R.<x,y>=QQbar[]
sage: f=x^2+x^3-y^2+y^4*x^4
sage: RX=PolynomialRing(QQbar,'x')
sage: RY=PolynomialRing(QQbar,'y')
sage: x0=3+2^-8
sage: y0=RY(f((x0,y))).roots(multiplicities=False)[0]
sage: f(x+x0,y0)
```
sounds like it might be triggerering the same problem as reported in the ticket.

The slightest bit of `%debug` fun shows that the problem arises here
`> /usr/local/sage/5.6rc0/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/qqbar.py(1563)do_polred()`:

```
   1562     parent = poly.parent()
-> 1563     rev = parent(best_elt.Mod(pari_poly).modreverse().lift())
   1564     return parent(best_elt), rev, parent(best)
```
with these inputs:

```
R.<y>=QQ['y']
best_elt = (1/16*y^2 - 134217728)._pari_()
pari_poly = y^4 - 4294967296*y^2 + 54265257667816538374400
rev = parent(best_elt.Mod(pari_poly).modreverse().lift())
```
confirming a degree mismatch problem.

**EDIT**: actually, from this example you don't see any degree mismatch problem immediately. The problem is that the minimal polynomial of `best_elt.Mod(pari_poly)` is quadratic rather than quartic. So `modreverse` is right in complaining. However, these polynomials were obtained from a routine that misreported a minimal poly somewhere.

Why is this a bug in PARI?  It seems to me that PARI behaves as documented.  The degree of the minimal polynomial is less than the degree of the field.

What would you *expect* PARI to do in this case?

```
sage: R.<y> = QQ['y']
sage: best_elt = (1/16*y^2 - 134217728)._pari_()
sage: pari_poly = y^4 - 4294967296*y^2 + 54265257667816538374400
sage: rev = parent(best_elt.Mod(pari_poly).modreverse().lift())

-Bug results in the situation when `best_elt.Mod(pari_poly)` is not square free, in contrast to the PARI docs, which say:
+Here, we are calling `modreverse()` on a element of a subfield. It would make a lot of exact linear algebra **much** more reliable if this was resolved.
 
-```
-Help: modreverse(a): reverse polymod of the polmod a, if it exists
-Doc: $a$ being a polmod $A(X)$ modulo $T(X)$, finds
- the ``reverse polmod'' $B(X)$ modulo $Q(X)$, where $Q$ is the minimal
- polynomial of $a$, which must be equal to the degree of $T$, and such that if
- $\theta$ is a root of $T$ then $\theta=B(\alpha)$ for a certain root $\alpha$
- of $Q$.
-```
-
-So the assumption of the equality of the degrees is violated.  This causes a trap in PARI.
-
-It would make a lot of exact linear algebra **much** more reliable if this was resolved.
-
-I'll try to find a reproducible example.

Nils and Jeroen,

THANKS for making some progress on this one.  David Roe and I had some "debug fun" with this last summer and I wasn't quite able to keep up and top of what was happening, so I'm glad we've got some better ideas about the source of the problem.

Hopefully this will make some matrix arithmetic over QQbar work better.

Rob
