Consider the following code:
    

```
ff.<z> = GF(2**8, 'z')
poly.<c1,c2,c3> = PolynomialRing(ff, 3, 'c')
r1,r2 = var('r1,r2')
expression = -(c1*r2 - c2*r1)/c3
print expression.substitute(r1=z, r2=z)
```

This produces a TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Finite Field in z of size 2pow8' and 'Rational Field'. I know that 'expression' is not an element of the ring 'poly', but using a PolynomialRing is the only way I found to achieve symbolic arithmetic on finite fields.

However, the interesting story is that if I replace the expression by


```
expression = -(r2 - c2*r1)/c3
```

it work perfectly well, but if instead the expression is


```
expression = -(c1 + r2 - c2*r1)/c3
```

then I get a segmentation fault.


To make things a little bit more interesting I can rename r1 and r2 to a and b:

```
ff.<z> = GF(2**8, 'z')
poly.<c1,c2,c3> = PolynomialRing(ff, 3, 'c')
a,b = var('a,b')
expression = -(c1*b - c2*a)/c3
print expression.substitute(a=z, b=z)
```

Then it works fine, but produces a segmentation fault for,


```
expression = -(c1 + b - c2*a)/c3
```

so you can think that it might be a problem with the use of the names r1 and r2. But this is not the case, if I rename the PolynomialRing variables instead, from c's to x's:

```
ff.<z> = GF(2**8, 'z')
poly.<x1,x2,x3> = PolynomialRing(ff, 3, 'x')
r1,r2 = var('r1,r2')
expression = -(x1*r2 - x2*r1)/x3
print expression.substitute(r1=z, r2=z)
```

Then it works again for the first two expressions but produces a segmentation fault for the third too.

Any idea of what is going wrong here?

I can confirm the segfaults. The following three examples lead to a crash:

```
ff.<z> = GF(2**8, 'z')
poly.<c1,c2,c3> = PolynomialRing(ff, 3, 'c')
r1,r2 = var('r1,r2')
expression = -(c1 + r2 - c2*r1)/c3
expression.substitute(r1=z, r2=z)
<boom>

a,b = var('a,b')
expression = -(c1 + b - c2*a)/c3
expression.substitute(a=z, b=z)
<boom>

poly.<x1,x2,x3> = PolynomialRing(ff, 3, 'x')
r1,r2 = var('r1,r2')
expression = -(x1 + r2 - x2*r1)/x3
expression.substitute(r1=z, r2=z)
<boom>
```

The fact that this depends on variable names made me think of ordering issues like #9880, but the examples above still lead to a segfault with patches from that ticket. I am now suspecting a coercion problem.

BTW, the backtrace looks like this:

```

Would it be possible to give a little more details in the doctests introducing text?
like explaining that depending on the name/ordering of the variables, the bug was/ was not triggered, whence the different tests made.

And putting expression or ex everywhere rather than changing the name in the middle?

With this I'll happily give positive review.

I uploaded a new patch with some text [attachment: trac_13609-gf2_content.take2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13609/trac_13609-gf2_content.take2.patch.gz). To demonstrate the content of the expressions involved, I wrapped GiNaC's `content()` method in #13736. This ticket now depends on the patch there.

Note that multiplying the numerator I give in the doctests by the content
gives

```
sage: -num.content(c1)*num
c1 + z*c2 + z
```

which changes the original leading coefficient `-1` by coercing it to `GF(2^8)`.

This does not happen during normalization, since `numeric::div_dyn()` is used
directly to modify the coefficients. There is a shortcut in that function to
do nothing if we are dividing by `1`. Perhaps I should back out the current
fix in Pynac and change `numeric::div_dyn()` to disable the shortcut if the
characteristic is not 0.

Comments?

The fix has been in Sage's version of Pynac for one year. The patch attached to this ticket (which just adds new tests) applies cleanly to sage-6.2.beta4, and the new tests pass. Is there any reason this ticket still needs review?

In any case, the patch in this ticket only documents the currently implemented behaviour. I'd say any changes to address the behaviour noted in Burcin's comment belong in another ticket.
