sage: ~SR(2L)

local/bin/sage-sage: line 303:  9165 Segmentation fault      sage-ipython "$@" -i

```
`~SR(2L)`is evaluated to ` SR(2L)^(-1) `

because of a faulty simplification in the power::eval function it generates power objects recursively.

A Pynac update fixing that is available in #13316.
Here are the corresponding doctests.

I've just slightly homogenized the patch.
I'll test it tomorrow and should then give positive review.
I've opened another ticket for the update to pynac 0.2.5;
maybe not the greatest idea, but at that time I thought that #13262 should be affected by 0.2.5 as well.
Whatsoever, both this ticket and #13316 should be merged together.

I've rebased on top of 5.2 and removed the ALLOW_TAB stuff together with the 3 corresponding tabs from expression.pyx.

As far as I'm concerned, the original patch together with this similarly minor modifications gets positive review.

Someone now needs to review the similarly simple #13316 which I have now tested to work on top of 5.2.

Only apply [attachment: power+eval.2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13107/fb16253c8198ea928fa44ef421a9c9aa.gz)
