sage: ~SR(2L)

local/bin/sage-sage: line 303:  9165 Segmentation fault      sage-ipython "$@" -i

```
`~SR(2L)`is evaluated to ` SR(2L)^(-1) `

because of a faulty simplification in the power::eval function it generates power objects recursively.

A Pynac update fixing that is available in #13316.
Here are the corresponding doctests.

<a id='comment:4'>Comment 4:</a>
I've just slightly homogenized the patch.
I'll test it tomorrow and should then give positive review.
I've opened another ticket for the update to pynac 0.2.5;
maybe not the greatest idea, but at that time I thought that #13262 should be affected by 0.2.5 as well.
Whatsoever, both this ticket and #13316 should be merged together.

<a id='comment:5'>Comment 5:</a>
I've rebased on top of 5.2 and removed the ALLOW_TAB stuff together with the 3 corresponding tabs from expression.pyx.

As far as I'm concerned, the original patch together with this similarly minor modifications gets positive review.

Someone now needs to review the similarly simple #13316 which I have now tested to work on top of 5.2.

Only apply [attachment: power+eval.2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13107/fb16253c8198ea928fa44ef421a9c9aa.gz)
