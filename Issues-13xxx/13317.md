Hey Mike,

Why doesn't `GenericCombinatorialSpecies` just inherit from `UniqueRepresentation`, and have just one`__classcall__()` there (as I recall, this works fine with inheritance, but you can override this as necessary)? If you keep the current code structure, I would move the caching tests in `__init__()` to the respective `__classcall__()` as tests.

Also, I recommend the formatting:

```
Returns the species of singletons.

This species has exactly one structure on a set of size `n`.
It is the same (and is implemented)  as ``CharacteristicSpecies(1)``.
```
for the `__init__()` methods.

Finally (and more trivial), trailing whitespace.

Thank you,

Travis
