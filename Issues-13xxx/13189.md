This patch implements testing for isomorphism (equivalence up to `GL(n,ZZ)` rotation) of fans

```
  sage: m1 = matrix([(1, 0), (0, -5), (-3, 4)])
  sage: m2 = matrix([(3, 0), (1, 0), (-2, 1)])
  sage: m1.elementary_divisors() == m2.elementary_divisors() == [1,1,0]
  True
  sage: fan1 = Fan([Cone([m1*vector([23, 14]), m1*vector([   3,100])]), 
  ...               Cone([m1*vector([-1,-14]), m1*vector([-100, -5])])])
  sage: fan2 = Fan([Cone([m2*vector([23, 14]), m2*vector([   3,100])]), 
  ...               Cone([m2*vector([-1,-14]), m2*vector([-100, -5])])])
  sage: fan1.is_isomorphic(fan2)
  True
  sage: fan1.isomorphism(fan2)
  Fan morphism defined by the matrix
  [18  1 -5]
  [ 4  0 -1]
  [ 5  0 -1]
  Domain fan: Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice N
  Codomain fan: Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice N
```
This is implemented by first computing the isomorphisms of auxiliary labelled graphs, and then trying to lift those to actual fan morphisms.

Glanced through, spotted a few typos that I'll fix in the reviewer patch.

What do you mean by the following change of output description??

```
By default, ``True`` if ``self`` and ``other`` are in the same
`GL(n, \ZZ)`-orbit, ``False`` otherwise.
```

Do you mind if I also switch computation of the virtual rays to the fan constructor and allow user to specify them? It is convenient e.g. when considering an affine toric variety corresponding to a face of another cone, or a subfanfan with similar structure. Then coordinates on the smaller variety can match the bigger ones.

The new module also has to be included into documentation, I think. Is there actually a particular reason why it is not just in `fan.py`?

I'm trying to say that it returns whether the two fans are equivalent up to a `GL(n,ZZ)` basis change. Apparently not comprehensible enough ;-)

> Do you mind if I also switch computation of the virtual rays to the fan constructor and allow user to specify them?

If you want to implement that, go for it.

The `fan_isomorphism.py` file is just a way to prevent `fan.py` from getting too large. The relevant user-visible documentation is in `fan.py`, so I don't think we should include `fan_isomorphism.py` in the developer guide.

OK, positive review to Volker's patches modulo reviewer's one, which needs review now.

Changes:
* move `virtual_rays` method to fans only and allow specifying them during fan construction;
* allow addition of point collections, which results in some simplification of code and examples;
* a bunch of clarification/typo fixes in the documentation.

Also, am I right that with automatically chosen virtual rays the choice cannot affect the isomorphism of cones?

I forgot the commit message in trac_13189_cone_isomorphism.patch, no actual code changes.

The reviewer patch looks good to me.

The virtual ray choice doesn't change whether or not there is a isomorphism of two cones / two fans (barring any bugs), but the matrix entries of the lattice map of course differ.
