Dear John,

Thanks for working on this.  This should be my mess to cleanup, but I have not had a chance to get to it.

Some comments.  I get 7 doctest failures.  This is on 5.1.beta3, but the offending #10795 applied cleanly, along with your #13140.

It looks to me like the following stanza in `_normalize_columns()` finds the first negative entry of the column, and adjusts that.  Which would not be the leading (non-zero) entry.

```python
for j from 0 <= j < M.ncols():
    for i from 0 <= i < M.column(j).degree():
        if M.column(j)[i] < 0:
            M = M.with_rescaled_col(j, -1)
            break
```

If I replace this with

```python
for j from 0 <= j < M.ncols():
    for i from 0 <= i < M.column(j).degree():
        if M.column(j)[i] != 0:
            if M.column(j)[i] < 0:
                M = M.with_rescaled_col(j, -1)
            break
```

then the number of failures goes down to 4.  Notice this does not carefully consider the possibility of `-0.0` before the desired leading entry (can we just test on that literal?).

Line 2517 (new line number according to patch) has a `.normalize_columns()` without an underscore.

With my change above I think any remaining problems (barring one) are just +/- 0 mixups.  It might make sense to normalize first, then round/clip to six places.

Most critically - `Q*R` should be the original matrix.  So if we adjust a column of `Q`, then we need to adjust a **row** of `R` before testing `Q*R == A`.  We could test this property **before** normalizing.  Then a companion `_normalize_rows()` might be indicated before displaying `Q` and `R`.  But still, the rows of `R` to normalize may not be the same as the columns of `Q` to normalize.

I'll do my best to stick with this one, but the next three days are full of family obligations (taking care of the parental generation!).

Thanks again for working on this.  It'd be good to have a pair of these normalization routines available.

You're right, thanks, I've fixed it.

> then the number of failures goes down to 4.  Notice this does not carefully consider the possibility of `-0.0` before the desired leading entry (can we just test on that literal?).

Within Sage, `RDF(-0.0)` prints as "-0.0", so I think it's the right thing to look at. `RDF(-0.0) == 0` returns True while `RDF(-0.0) < 0` returns False, which suggests that we're okay, but I'm not absolutely sure.

> Line 2517 (new line number according to patch) has a `.normalize_columns()` without an underscore.

Fixed.

> With my change above I think any remaining problems (barring one) are just +/- 0 mixups.  It might make sense to normalize first, then round/clip to six places.

Right, good idea.

Everything checks out fine on version 5.1.rc1 and all looks good.  Thanks for putting this together, maybe QR decomposition will finally be in good order.

One final idea.  I made a slightly different version of this routine ("inplace"), using the matrix routine that scales the column without making a copy of the matrix.  Runs about 10% faster on a moderately large matrix.

```
sage: A = random_matrix(RDF, 1000)
sage: timeit("A._normalize_columns()")
5 loops, best of 3: 5.38 s per loop
sage: timeit("A._normalize_columns_inplace()")
5 loops, best of 3: 4.84 s per loop
```


Patch implements the suggested change, and the relevant tests pass when applied.  If you like it, then go ahead and add it to the list of patches and flip this all to positive review.  Thanks again.
