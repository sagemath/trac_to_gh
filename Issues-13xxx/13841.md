I think hardware shouldn't be the problem, I'm sure William can setup a VM for this if needed. Time, on the other hand, is a more valuable resource...

Yeah that would be very helpful, at least for a buildbot (though it may need human intervention somehow because of rebasing issues, but also note that 64 bits cygwin is on its way and seems quite already in a usale state except for the lack of an installer and me being able to find where to downnload it!).

For at least one year, or mybe two years, i.e. until I change job, I should have some time for that.

Yup, completely sure, it just reads what's there to rebase after what already exists, but does not write anything.

E.g. if you "rebase -O" two copies of sage and try to run them at the same time, it will likely fail because "rebase -O" will have used the same addesses.

What is "incredibly slow"? For me, there is no problem if Sage can be built and tested within 48 hours. Is that feasible?

The mapping of dlls to addresses must be stored somewhere. (where?)
Are you saying that the next run of "rebase -O" completely erases this mapping, and builds a new one from scratch?

I'd say it's stored into the dlls themselves, not sure though, but not in the system-wide database for sure, my usual user doesnt have write access to it anyway.

I'm not sure a second run would change everything, it just acts like a usual rebase (without -O) but does not record the results into the system-wide database, so if no dll was added into the global database and you're not adding new stuff to the list of additional files you want to rebase then nothing will change (maybe if you remove some then it will try to pack the address space used).

This ticket hasn't been updated in 4+ years, and doesn't really discuss anything that's still an open issue for the Cygwin port.

The best way right now to track progress on the Cygwin port is to just search on the [porting: Cygwin component](https://trac.sagemath.org/query?status=needs_info&status=needs_review&status=needs_work&status=new&status=positive_review&component=porting%3A+Cygwin&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&order=priority).
