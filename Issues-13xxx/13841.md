I think hardware shouldn't be the problem, I'm sure William can setup a VM for this if needed. Time, on the other hand, is a more valuable resource...

Yeah that would be very helpful, at least for a buildbot (though it may need human intervention somehow because of rebasing issues, but also note that 64 bits cygwin is on its way and seems quite already in a usale state except for the lack of an installer and me being able to find where to downnload it!).

For at least one year, or mybe two years, i.e. until I change job, I should have some time for that.

yes, but if you want to install a new version of Sage, then you probably want to wipe the rebase databases and do a full, cygwin-less, rebase.

Yup, completely sure, it just reads what's there to rebase after what already exists, but does not write anything.

E.g. if you "rebase -O" two copies of sage and try to run them at the same time, it will likely fail because "rebase -O" will have used the same addesses.

The mapping of dlls to addresses must be stored somewhere. (where?)
Are you saying that the next run of "rebase -O" completely erases this mapping, and builds a new one from scratch?
