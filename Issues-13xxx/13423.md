From sage/plot/arrow.py:

```
@rename_keyword(color='rgbcolor')
@options(width=2, rgbcolor=(0,0,1),zorder=2, head = 1, linestyle='solid', legend_label=None)
def arrow2d(tailpoint=None, headpoint=None, path=None, **options):
...
```

This works, but the docstring doesn't mention it:

```
INPUT:

    - ``tailpoint`` - the starting point of the arrow

    - ``headpoint`` - where the arrow is pointing to

    - ``path`` - the list of points and control points (see bezier_path for detail) that 
      the arrow will follow from source to destination

    - ``head`` - 0, 1 or 2, whether to draw the head at the start (0), end (1) or both (2)
      of the path (using 0 will swap headpoint and tailpoint).  This is ignored
      in 3D plotting.

    - ``width`` - (default: 2) the width of the arrow shaft, in points

    - ``color`` - (default: (0,0,1)) the color of the arrow (as an RGB tuple or a string)

    - ``hue`` - the color of the arrow (as a number)

    - ``arrowsize`` - the size of the arrowhead

    - ``arrowshorten`` - the length in points to shorten the arrow (ignored if using path
      parameter)

    - ``legend_label`` - the label for this item in the legend 

    - ``zorder`` - the layer level to draw the arrow-- note that this is ignored in 3D
      plotting.

    EXAMPLES:
...
```

Nope, doesn't work, although I'm at a loss as to why. Matplotlib throws "`ValueError: Unrecognized linestyle: --`". On the other hand, if I do,

```
sage: line2d([(1, 1), (3, 3)], linestyle='whatever')
```

It's totally cool with it, but the plot is empty. So there's two different code paths somewhere I just haven't been able to untangle them.

My main reason for not doing this is to first determine the reason for this inconsistency. Hence, I sent the email.

I thought about putting in a pull request, but I don't know mpl well enough. There are modifications required at several places in the file I linked to in the email, and I haven't as yet checked all the documentation (across several files) that would need to be changed. To make a proper patch will require quite a bit of effort - I would rather not spend so much time on it and then find out that they are not interested in the change.
