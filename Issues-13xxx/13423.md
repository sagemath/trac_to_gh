Assignee: jason, was

Keywords: beginner

From sage/plot/arrow.py:

```
@rename_keyword(color='rgbcolor')
@options(width=2, rgbcolor=(0,0,1),zorder=2, head = 1, linestyle='solid', legend_label=None)
def arrow2d(tailpoint=None, headpoint=None, path=None, **options):
...
```

This works, but the docstring doesn't mention it:

```
INPUT:

    - ``tailpoint`` - the starting point of the arrow

    - ``headpoint`` - where the arrow is pointing to

    - ``path`` - the list of points and control points (see bezier_path for detail) that 
      the arrow will follow from source to destination

    - ``head`` - 0, 1 or 2, whether to draw the head at the start (0), end (1) or both (2)
      of the path (using 0 will swap headpoint and tailpoint).  This is ignored
      in 3D plotting.

    - ``width`` - (default: 2) the width of the arrow shaft, in points

    - ``color`` - (default: (0,0,1)) the color of the arrow (as an RGB tuple or a string)

    - ``hue`` - the color of the arrow (as a number)

    - ``arrowsize`` - the size of the arrowhead

    - ``arrowshorten`` - the length in points to shorten the arrow (ignored if using path
      parameter)

    - ``legend_label`` - the label for this item in the legend 

    - ``zorder`` - the layer level to draw the arrow-- note that this is ignored in 3D
      plotting.

    EXAMPLES:
...
```

Nope, doesn't work, although I'm at a loss as to why. Matplotlib throws "`ValueError: Unrecognized linestyle: --`". On the other hand, if I do,

```
sage: line2d([(1, 1), (3, 3)], linestyle='whatever')
```

It's totally cool with it, but the plot is empty. So there's two different code paths somewhere I just haven't been able to untangle them.

This is really bad - it crops from inconsistent "API" of the linestyle in `FancyArrowPatch` of matplotlib, compared to the default plot commands. I will have a go at fixing it.

Since mpl is unresponsive to my mail, I have added a new patch to make sure that the usual linestyle options are possible to be used with the `arrow` command. Even more advanced linestyles are possible in matplotlib by passing tuples to the `linestyle` option, but that method is properly documented only in the POSTSCRIPT reference manual.

I am ok with the earlier patch. If you feel that my patch is OK, then you can set this to positive review.

My main reason for not doing this is to first determine the reason for this inconsistency. Hence, I sent the email.

I thought about putting in a pull request, but I don't know mpl well enough. There are modifications required at several places in the file I linked to in the email, and I haven't as yet checked all the documentation (across several files) that would need to be changed.
