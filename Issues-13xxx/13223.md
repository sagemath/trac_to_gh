Some sources define graded poset like what Sage define ranked. For that see #16998 and doc for `is_graded` on `posets.py`.

My code lacked one `set()` function. But after that also `minimal_elements()` takes more time that I thinked, hence this code is still slower than original in many (most?) cases.

Also, original code is O(n). Hence I dropped this to minor priority.

Oh. I thought that it would go unnoticed.

Well, try replacing the code of sinks/source from

```
return [x for x in self if self.out_degree(x)==0]
```

to

```
return [x for x,d in self.out_degree(labels=True).iteritems() if d==0]
```

It means less calls to `out_degree`. Perhaps that's what you detected ?

I'll try that.

Whole question is irrelevant, but interesting. It should be clear that checking if a poset is graded is faster when doing it "directly" and not throught rank function. Rank should need both in- ja out-edges of underlying graph, direct method just out-edges; and out-edges are just picked up from memory, not searched in any way.

However, many timinigs say against this.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:17'></a>\nHello !\n\nJust looked at the code again, but I do not see what possible improvement you expect. Algorithmically, things are done correctly. Now, if you really need to save some time on this function you can change a couple of lines to avoid creating lists unnecessarily, turn the Python list into a C arrays, things like that. But I think that the Poset code still needs other improvements before this kind of things begin to be the critical costs.\n\nAbout definitions, though: what is implemented is not equivalent to `return all(rf(i) == rank for i in maxes)`, for you need to do the same with mins. This `Poset` is not graded according to the definition involving \"all maximal chains\":\n\n`Poset(DiGraph({1:[2],3:[2],4:[3]})).show()`\n\nIt would be interesting to compare the speed of `rank_dict` and `is_graded` though, as their code is very similar.\n\nNathann",

Hello !

Just looked at the code again, but I do not see what possible improvement you expect. Algorithmically, things are done correctly. Now, if you really need to save some time on this function you can change a couple of lines to avoid creating lists unnecessarily, turn the Python list into a C arrays, things like that. But I think that the Poset code still needs other improvements before this kind of things begin to be the critical costs.

About definitions, though: what is implemented is not equivalent to `return all(rf(i) == rank for i in maxes)`, for you need to do the same with mins. This `Poset` is not graded according to the definition involving "all maximal chains":

`Poset(DiGraph({1:[2],3:[2],4:[3]})).show()`

It would be interesting to compare the speed of `rank_dict` and `is_graded` though, as their code is very similar.

Yep. Should this one be marked as positive_review and moved to wontfix-milestone?

True.

> It would be interesting to compare the speed of `rank_dict` and `is_graded` though, as their code is very similar.


I made a code that was slightly faster when calculating how many of `Posets(8)` are graded (assuming that ranks were not already computed). IF "going up" is cheaper than going down, i.e. poset is internally saved as digraph of upper covers, then in principle current implementation would be `O(n^2)` and my implementation `O(n)`. But in reality this sppedup is not happening.

As current algorithm already is `O(n)` with small constant factor, and Nathann also suggest closing this, I mark this ticket as dontfix-positive_review.

Todo-note from `posets.py` must also be removed. However, I can do that on #16998.
