Currently, `Ring` inherits from `ParentWithGens`, making it difficult to transition rings that have generators to the new model.  This ticket adds a new class that skips over the methods in `ParentWithGens`, thus modeling what would happen if `Ring` were changed to inherit from `Parent` directly.

There are no tests for `gens`, `ngens`, etc in `sage.structure.category_object.CategoryObject` since there aren't any parents using this new functionality yet.  I will add tests to these functions as part of #5768, which will depend on this ticket and #13684.

I keep being told to break changes up into smaller chunks....
