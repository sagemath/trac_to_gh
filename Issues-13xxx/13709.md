Well.. I have been told to never remove all trailing whitespaces from a patch at once because it broke patch, and to remove them slowly instead, patch by patch. So I remove some when I go over them.

I would prefer to remove them all at once, of course.

For instance, when I look at the source code of the patch in my browser, the "Schäfli" are replaced with some stupid "SchlÃ€fli"... When I do graphs.SchaefliGraph?? the output is with "ä" in my terminal. Shouldn't you use only "ae"?
