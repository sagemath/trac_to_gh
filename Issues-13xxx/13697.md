The class `QuotientRingElement`, which implements the operations an element of the quotient `R/I` of a ring `R` by an ideal `I`, suffers from several problems and limitations. Most of these were uncovered while working on #13670 and #13675.

* While `QuotientRingElement` aims to be generic, it contains code dedicated to the case where `R` is a multivariate polynomial ring. In particular, the implementation of division first checks if `R` supports the computation of Groebner bases. This is not the proper way to go ; a special class should be created, following the approach taken for univariate polynomial quotient rings (`PolynomialQuotientRing`, `PolynomialQuotientRingElement`). We should create `MPolynomialQuotientRing` and `MPolynomialQuotientRingElement`, and host multivariate-polynomial-specific code here.

* The `is_unit()` function does almost nothing (it checks if its argument is a unit in `R`). In the case of (multivariate) polynomial rings, an actual test can be implemented.

* The class lacks an `is_regular()` methods (that detects zero divisors).

* In the case of (multivariate) polynomial rings, `is_regular()` can be implemented.

* The interest of `is_regular()` is that division by `x` should only be allowed if `x` is regular.

* The present implementation of division has problems. It contains multivariate-polynomial-specific code, which is bad.     Furthermore, it allows division by zero-divisors, even tough the result is not defined :

  ```
  sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
  sage: S = R.quotient_ring(R.ideal(x^2, y))
  sage: S(2*x)/S(x)
  S(2)
  sage: S(2) * S(x) == S(2*x)  # indeed, division works correctly....
  True
  sage: S(2+x) * S(x) == S(2*x) # but several "quotients" are possible, because ``S(x)`` is a zero-divisor
  ```

  In contrast, univariate polynomial rings behave more rigorously:

  ```
  sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
  sage: S = P.quotient_ring(x^2)
  sage: S(2*x)/S(x)
  ZeroDivisionError: element xbar of quotient polynomial ring not invertible
  ```

* This raises the question of how we want division to proceed:
   * ignore the problem? (current status, no overhead)
   * test for regularity before dividing (mathematically better, may be **much** slower)

* Clarifying all this would then open the possibility to have, for example, special code to deal with ideals given by a regular chain instead of a Groebner basis

I ran into the following:

```
sage: R.<x,y>=QQ[]
sage: Q.<xx,yy>=R.quotient(x^2-y^3)
sage: xx/yy
...
ArithmeticError: Division failed. The numerator is not a multiple of the denominator.
```
It would be nice if in this situation, the quotient ring could check if it is a domain, and if so, return `xx/yy` as an element of the fraction field.
