Let `C` be a plane projective curves over a finite field `k` and `S` a finite set of `k`-sections of the curve.

REFEREE REPORT:

It looks good!

More precisely, I (William Stein) read the code for style, and Max Leiblich (an algebraic geometer) read the code for the mathematics, and we both agree it looks good.

Well, there is one unusual thing.  There are backslashes in the comments so they occupy less than 80 characters, but when read, are wide.  I've never seen this before anywhere in Sage/Python code.  I'm not sure whether we should allow it or not.  I'll leave this to the release manager.
