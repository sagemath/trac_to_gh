```
Currently, quantum integers are only defined for non-negative integers:

```
        sage: q_analogues.q_int(-2)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: Argument (-2) must be a nonnegative integer.
```
The correct definition is that the quantum integer [n]_q is

  [n]_q  = { 1+q+...+q!^  {n-1}, if n\ge 0
                               { -q!^ -n [-n],             if n<0

This patch corrects this. That is, if q\ne1 then [n]_q = (q!^n-1)/(q-1).

Note: prior to trac !#11411 these quantum integers were defined to be zero, and #11411 made q_int() return a ValueError. Patch !#11411 was motivated by q_binomial(2,3), for example, previously returning incorrect answers. With this patch both q_int() and q_binom()  return the correct answers.

This is my first attempt at reviewing a ticket so please let me know if I am breaking any rules...

I just uploaded an update to your patch which addresses the following:
* I tried to correctly format the doc strings (but as I am no export on documentation, it would be good if somebody could check).
* Added an initial check whether n is an integer (previously, q_int(3/2) would result in 0 without complaint).

Because of these changes, I am leaving this ticket as needing review.

Thanks for your review. I agree with all of your suggestions except for changing the return statement when n<0 to:

```
return -p**n * sum([p**i for i in range(-n)])
```
because multiplying polynomials tends to be expensive. Perhaps you thought the previous use of `range(-1,n-1,-1))` wasn't very nice? If so this could be replaced by 

```
return sum([-p**(n+i) for i in range(-n)])
```

I am also not very experienced as to what happens next in the review process... Because this patch is so short I am tempted to just incorporate your changes and post a new version.

The updated patch just fixes a tiny latex issue.

Replying to [@AndrewAtLarge](#comment%3A6):

You're right: I changed the return statement mostly because of "looks" and to make it visibly agree with the documentation.  However, it actually turns out that the new statement is also **much** faster than both the previous one or the one you suggested as an alternative:

```
sage: p = ZZ['q'].gens()[0]
sage: n = -10
sage: %timeit -sum(p**j for j in  range(-1,n-1,-1))
625 loops, best of 3: 972 µs per loop
sage: %timeit sum([-p**(n+i) for i in range(-n)])
625 loops, best of 3: 979 µs per loop
sage: %timeit -p**n * sum([p**i for i in range(-n)])
625 loops, best of 3: 158 µs per loop
sage: n = -100
sage: %timeit -sum(p**j for j in  range(-1,n-1,-1))
25 loops, best of 3: 22.7 ms per loop
sage: %timeit sum([-p**(n+i) for i in range(-n)])
25 loops, best of 3: 27.6 ms per loop
sage: %timeit -p**n * sum([p**i for i in range(-n)])
625 loops, best of 3: 716 µs per loop
```

I certainly didn't anticipate this.

Thus, I would suggest leaving the two patches as they are.  From my (little) experience, I would say that there is no need to combine the two patches into a single one.  However, I just noted that your patch does not contain the ticket number in the comment line (at the top).  So when changing this, you might as well combine the two patches.

There is a problem building the documentation:

```
release/merger/sage-5.4.beta0/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/q_analogues.py:docstring of sage.combinat.q_analogues.q_factorial:18: WARNING: Literal block expected; none found.
```

Have a look gain at the documentation of `q_factorial`, lines 80--82.
