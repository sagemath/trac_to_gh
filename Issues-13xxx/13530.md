The ```list``` member function of ```sage.gsl.interpolation.Spline``` returns a reference to the spline interpolation points, allowing one to change these points without having the spline be recomputed: 

```
sage: s = spline([(0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4)]); s
[(0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4)]
sage: s(1)
2.0
sage: s.list()[1] = (1, 100); s
[(0, 0), (1, 100), (2, 4)]
sage: s(1)
2.0
```

This issue came up in #12036 and is related to #13520.

<a id='comment:4'>**Comment 4:**</a>
Could you change the doctest to show that the list is a copy such as

```
sage: S = spline([(1,1), (2,3), (4,5)])
sage: L = S.list(); L
[(1, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5)] 
sage: L[2] = (3, 2)
sage: L
[(1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)]
sage: S.list()
[(1, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5)]
```
showing the change and testing it (in a TEST:: block), as well as coping a form of what is in the trac description into the method description?

Edit: Functionally it is good.

A TESTS:: block is when something is not an example per say, but used in showing some bug has been fixed.

Looks good to me.
