On CYGWIN, the Singular LIB files, i.e. files with code in Singular language, normally installed to `SAGELOCAL/share/singular/`, also get copied to `SAGELOCAL/lib/`. This, apart from being plainly wrong, is breaking the installation of pyOpenSSL, as mentioned in comments on #13339.

Depends on #13237

I agree that's wrong.
did you check that everything was ok on a Linux install?
I won't have any at hand before tomorrow.

Quite strangely my install log says:

```
./mkinstalldirs /home/jp/sage-5.2/local/share/singular
mkdir /home/jp/sage-5.2/local/share/singular
for file in `pwd`/LIB/*.lib; do \
  /usr/bin/install -c -m 644  $file /home/jp/sage-5.2/local/share/singular; \
done
```
while make install-nolns in Singular
And then

```
./mkinstalldirs /home/jp/sage-5.2/local/LIB
for file in `pwd`/LIB/*.lib; do \
  /usr/bin/install -c -m 644  $file /home/jp/sage-5.2/local/LIB; \
done
```
while make install-libsingular in Singular.

I guess some Makefile is broken for Cygwin as in #12089.

It's OK on MacOSX and on Linux.

The problem should be that we call

```
but

```
$MAKE install-libsingular

although that does not explain the discrepancy between Cygwin and other systems.

I'm currently building your 3-1-5.p1 on MacOSX. I'll see what I get soon, and post the log, too.

Adding it to MAKE seems a little bit invasive to me, although it might be the only sensible way to be sure that the share dir is correctly set when make is used (for Singular, but imagine we also happen to use make for something else... ok that's exagerated)

Too bad there is no configure option to set slibdir, maybe this is worth an upstream fix?

Ok course, I intended to changes this locally in the spkg's `spkg-install` only. If you're sure that this is enough than it's better to do it (even more locally ;-) ) in the second invocation only.
