On CYGWIN, the Singular LIB files, i.e. files with code in Singular language, normally installed to `SAGELOCAL/share/singular/`, also get copied to `SAGELOCAL/lib/`. This, apart from being plainly wrong, is breaking the installation of pyOpenSSL, as mentioned in comments on #13339.

Depends on #13237

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

I agree that's wrong.
did you check that everything was ok on a Linux install?
I won't have any at hand before tomorrow.

Quite strangely my install log says:

```
./mkinstalldirs /home/jp/sage-5.2/local/share/singular
mkdir /home/jp/sage-5.2/local/share/singular
for file in `pwd`/LIB/*.lib; do \
  /usr/bin/install -c -m 644  $file /home/jp/sage-5.2/local/share/singular; \
done
```
while make install-nolns in Singular
And then

```
./mkinstalldirs /home/jp/sage-5.2/local/LIB
for file in `pwd`/LIB/*.lib; do \
  /usr/bin/install -c -m 644  $file /home/jp/sage-5.2/local/LIB; \
done
```
while make install-libsingular in Singular.

I guess some Makefile is broken for Cygwin as in #12089.

The problem should be that we call

$MAKE install-libsingular

although that does not explain the discrepancy between Cygwin and other systems.

but that's an old spkg, I'd like to also check the later ones (I could also look into the old spkg sources but i'm lazy).

Your Cygwin log is similar to mine.

I'm currently building your 3-1-5.p1 on MacOSX. I'll see what I get soon, and post the log, too.

Adding slibdir to the second make invocation would please me.

Adding it to MAKE seems a little bit invasive to me, although it might be the only sensible way to be sure that the share dir is correctly set when make is used (for Singular, but imagine we also happen to use make for something else... ok that's exagerated)

Too bad there is no configure option to set slibdir, maybe this is worth an upstream fix?
I see that a bunch of other directories can be tweaked at configure time.
