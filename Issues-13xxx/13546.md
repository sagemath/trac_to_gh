The method for recognizing perfect graphs if flawed. Consider the following sage function:

```
def f(n):
    c= 0
    for g in graphs.nauty_geng(str(n)):
        if g.is_perfect():
            c+=1
    return c

```

one can readily see that f(7) = 607 and f(8) = 8899 which is, (according to oeis http://oeis.org/A052431) incorrect. What should be true is that f(7) = 906 and f(7) = 8887.

I propose to rewrite a correct algorithm perhaps using the  polynomial algorithm (www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/vuskovi/FOCS03final.ps).

<a id='comment:4'></a>Ahahaahah... Stupid bug `:-)`

Ok, it is now fixed by the following patch. Here's what it does :

* It tests if the graph's complement is bipartite. Just a potential speed improvement.
* Returns a result immediately if the girth is odd and > 3, and not only if it is equal to 5
And ... more importantly `:-D`

* replaces an occurrence of ``self`` which should have been ``self_complement`` from the beginning `:-DDDDDDD`

With sage-5.6.rc0 + the patch:

With sage-5.6.rc0 and no patch applied:

Starting from scratch. With sage-5.6.rc0, I get True with this graph:

sage: g.is_perfect()

```

Strangely, I get a runtime error if I reconstruct the graph from the sparse string:

```
sage: Graph(':FgGE@I@GxGs').is_perfect()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: Segmentation fault
```

I don't know what this sparse string is doing... It does not seem to be injective for instance... Anyway.

With sage-5.6.rc0 + the patch, everything is fine:

```
sage: Graph(':FgGE@I@GxGs').is_perfect()

sage: g = Graph({0: [2, 3, 4, 5], 1: [3, 4, 5, 6], 2: [0, 4, 5, 6], 3: [0, 1, 5, 6], 4: [0, 1, 2, 6], 5: [0, 1, 2, 3], 6: [1, 2, 3, 4]})
sage: g.is_perfect()
False
```

Can we add this previous doctest in the patch? because there is no doctest in the patch in its actual version. It would have to be an optional one since it depends on the optional package nauty....

There is something I still do not understand (related to sparse string). `is_perfect` does not seem to be preserve under the passage to the `sparse6_string`... Only 818 of the graph are still perfect after the recovery... All this would be more easy if graphs were hashable... Anyways...

No way. If somebody calls this method, he/she wants to test a simple graph. No other way. If they expect anything by giving non-simple digraphs, it would be getting incoherent results.

> * Document that non-simple graphs are going to be treated as simple


Perfect graphs are only defined for simple graphs.

> * Simply test at the beginning if the graph is simple and return an exception if it is not.

The point is that in the situation of sparse6 strings, the graph given is simple but *allows* loops and multiple edges.

Anyhow. I am aware of the sparse6 issue but in my opinion that is an issue of how we currently handle sparse6 strings! So if we enforce the simplicity rule in is_perfect then at some point someone will perhaps get annoyed and want an option of the form 

```
Graph('sparse6_string',force_simplicity=True)

instead of Sage having to guess if the user sent a sparse6 graph that was converted to a non-simple graph etc... Or perhaps the Graph() constructor could check if the resulting graph is simple and automatically flag it as such.

As far as I see, the patch need not remove loops and multiple edges from the complement now?

Right now there is no problem with sparse6 strings, because the functions does not check whether the graph ALLOWS loops and multiple edges, but whether it HAS some. So the exception is not raised for sparse6 string, and is only raised if there is a loop in the graph, or multiple edges.

It is still needed, for instance for graphs coming from sparse6, because even though they contain no multiple edges and loops they allow it. So the complement will have multiple edges.

Actually, the problem is probably that taking the complement of a graph that allows loops will add loops and multiple edges to the graph, and I don't really think that's a good behaviour.

There's nothing called "simple" graph is Sage. What we have is 4 methods : has_loops, allows_loops, has_multiple_edges, allows_multiple_edges. I don't know why that's how it got written, but that's how it is. We can change that of course, and even define a is_simple function. But well, that's how it is.

> What about the remark on handling sparse6 strings? If a sparse6 string represents a simple graph there is no need to return a graph allowing multiple edges?


It means that whether a graph allows loops depends on whether the sparse6 string you feed it with allows it. So if you store 1000 sparse6 string and load them all, some of the graphs you get will allow multiple edges and loops, some others will not. I think that this would be dirty.

What could be done is this :

```
Graph(my_string, allow_loops = True, allow_multiple_edges = True)
```
returs graphs allowing loops and multiple edges.

```
Graph(my_string, allow_loops = False)
```
raises an exception if the string does not correspond to a non-simple graph.

The point is that you wouldn't create graphs allowing loops and multiple edges by mistake.

<a id='comment:31'></a>Hello!

Thanks for the clarifications.

What I don't like is this. The "looped" here implies as if the graph is non-simple.

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()  
sage: G
Petersen graph: Graph on 10 vertices
sage: Graph(G.sparse6_string())   
Looped multi-graph on 10 vertices
```

I see that this is not an issue with is_perfect hence I'll flag this ticket with a positive review. But I really don't like the current way we are handling multigraphs as it introduces messy situations and I would really like to get a clear distinctions for this.
