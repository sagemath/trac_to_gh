Implements the finite Generalized dihedral groups. 
A Generalized dihedral group is the semi-direct product of an abelian group with C2, where C2 acts on the abelian group by sending elements to their inverse.
This adds a group of order 18 that is not part of any other family currently implemented in sage, as well as others of not so small order.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Looks great. I found a few typos while reading the doc strings. I'll look at the _init_ code more carefully, later, but on first glance and playing around with it for a few minutes it seems solid.

Typos to check in `sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.py`:

* Line 767: The first sentence here is not a sentence.
* Line 770: replace "factor" with "product"
* Line 776: What do you mean by "degree" here? Do you mean "order"? If so, I would say that or else clarify degree.
* `__init__()` needs a docstring. In these cases I tend to write something like

```
def __init__():
    r"""
    Init method of class <CLASSNAME>. See the docstring for :class:`<CLASSNAME>`.
    
    EXAMPLES::

        sage: ex1
    """
    ...
```

Nice work, I'm glad this is on its way to getting into Sage. More later..
