installing `Gurobi` switches the default LP solver to `Gurobi`, leading to doctest failure in `mip.pyx`

```
File "/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.2.rc0/devel/sage-main/sage/numerical/mip.pyx", line 298:
    sage: q = copy(p)
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.2.rc0/local/bin/ncadoctest.py", line 1231, in run_one_test

      File "<doctest __main__.example_4[4]>", line 1, in <module>
        q = copy(p)###line 298:
    sage: q = copy(p)
      File "/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.2.rc0/local/lib/python2.7/copy.py", line 80, in copy
        return copier(x)
      File "mip.pyx", line 320, in sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.__copy__ (sage/numerical/mip.c:2352)
        p._backend = (<GenericBackend> self._backend).copy()
    AttributeError: 'sage.numerical.backends.gurobi_backend.GurobiBacke' object has no attribute 'copy'
```

And indeed, there is no copy() in gurobi backend.

Another bunch of tests that fail in a similar fashion, due to Gurobi (version 5) automatically naming constraints, and so 
one gets 

```
File "/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.2.rc0/devel/sage-main/sage/numerical/mip.pyx", line 1132:
    sage: p.show()
Expected:
    Maximization:
    <BLANKLINE>
    Constraints:
      x_0 + x_1 <= 10.0
      x_0 - x_1 <= 0.0
      x_0 <= 4.0
    ...
Got:
    Maximization:
    <BLANKLINE>
    Constraints:
      R0: x_0 + x_1 <= 10.0
      R1: x_0 - x_1 <= 0.0
      R2: x_0 <= 4.0
    Variables:
      x_0 is a continuous variable (min=0.0, max=+oo)
      x_1 is a continuous variable (min=0.0, max=+oo)
```
and other similar failures from `show()`.

One particular way to fix this would be to set the solver to be `GLPK` in all these tests, and create similar
optional tests for `Gurobi`.

And, lastly, Gurobi version 5 on OSX 10.6 outputs `[-0.0, 3.0]` rather than `[0.0, 3.0]` in a doctest in `gurobi_backend.pyx`.
