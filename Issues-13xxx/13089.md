This ticket aims at an implementation of weighted projective spaces in Sage. This was discussed on sage-devel here: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/rahI8ewn1_c/discussion. 

One approach is to implement weighted projective spaces as toric varieties.

The attached patch is intended as a starting point to be revised and expanded upon. 

It might make sense to give weighted projective spaces a class of their own. 

Also, it might be suitable to make them as CPR Fano toric varieties (I think they are all of this type). When making polytopes with LatticePolytope there seems to be a limit on the dimension (<=6)  and I think it might make sense to allow weighted projective spaces of bigger dimension than that.

The attached patch constructs the fan using quotient lattices, so Sage chooses a basis for the lattice. I like the basis it picks except that (in the present context) one might prefer a different order of the basis vectors.

Not all WPs are (singular) Fano and general toric varieties are handled by PPL so there are no dimension limits.

If one of the weights is one, e.g. WP(1,1,4,6), then one can take for the fan rays the standard basis plus "negative weights except for one 1", i.e. (-1,-4,-6).

In general you take the standard basis of dimension+1 and quotient by the weights. If this works - great, I just was not sure if there are still problems with fans in quotient lattices in Sage - there were some but we were gradually improving the situation.

New patch attached. 

It is based on Sage 5.1.beta5 (so should be consistent with #13023).

The weights need no longer be packed into a tuple or list.

Added keyword 'names' for user defined coordinate names.

It seems that quotient lattice are not quite ready for fans. For example, there seems to be a need for a length function for elements of quotients. I did not look at this very carefully though.

In either case, I think it would be good to get the weighted projective space code into the toric varieties library and then simplifications can be made later as functionality of lattice quotients is expanded.

Thanks for trying to use quotient lattices, I though I took care of length, but apparently not for all cases. Let's move on with WPs as is, just a couple little picks:

Instead of 

```
print "keyword argument %s (value %s) will be ignored" % (key,kw[key]) 
```
you should raise an exception, since ideally we want

```
def WP(self, *q, K=QQ, names="z+"): 
```
and it would. (Showing the traceback that lead to it instead of just the error.)

It is also deprecated in Python to use `raise Error, "message"`, rather it should be `raise Error("message")`.
