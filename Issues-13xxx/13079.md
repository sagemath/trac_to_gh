In #12993, Christian had the great idea to use the rank function (for a ranked poset) to compute the heights when plotting a poset.

For example, we would want the following poset

```
sage: P = Poset(([1,2,3,4],[[1,4],[2,3],[3,4]]), facade = True)
sage: P.plot()
```
to be plotted like this:

```
        o
       / \
      o   o
     /
    o
```

apply trac-13079-rebase-fc.patch

Depends on #14006

The patch I just posted extracted the relevant bits from #12993. It probably doesn't even apply, but one can reconstruct the modifications from the patch.

**Work issues:**

- fix the patch
- figure out the pickling issue

I won't have time to work on this over the next week.

This has been reduced to the following problem :

```
sage: P = Poset(DiGraph())                      
sage: dumps(P)
```
the dumps work. Then

```
sage: P.rank_function()
```

```
sage: dumps(P) 
```
the dumps does no longer work

is there a chance to merge the (basically identical) iterations:
