Keywords: sd59 padics

Currently, the following does not work because some padic extension elements do not define a hash function (see #11895 for why they do not define a hash function):

```
sage: K = Qp(3)
sage: R.<a> = K[]
sage: L.<a> = K.extension(a^2-3)
sage: L.ideal(a)
TypeError: unhashable type: 'sage.rings.padics.padic_ZZ_pX_CR_element.pAdicZZpXCRElement'
```

The problem is that `sage.rings.ring.Ring` is looking for a coercion from `a` to `L`. There is none, since `a` is not a parent. The attached patch fixes this.
