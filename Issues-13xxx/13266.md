Another question: The current implementation makes

```
E.weilrestriction()
```
an alias for

```
E.defining_ideal().weilrestriction()
```
so it saves typing 17 characters, at the expense of implementing "weilrestriction" for elliptic curves as a functor from the category of elliptic curves over a number field K to the category of ideals over Q.

I'm afraid most people would expect the weil restriction of an elliptic curve to be an abelian variety, not an ideal.

Plus, in what sense is the returned ideal describing the Weil restriction?

Since you're restricting a projective ideal, you have to be careful what you divide out by.
Projective equivalence for `(x:y:z) in P^2(K)` is modulo `K^*` whereas for
`(x0:x1:y0:y1:z0:z1) in P^5(Q)` it's only modulo `Q^*`.

You also run into problems because there are subvarieties where (x0,x1,y0,y1,z0,z1) are not all zero and yet correspond to (x,y,z) with no x,y,z invertible (if K is a field over Q then these varieties won't have Q-rational points, though), so you'd have to take something much more complicated than Proj(...), and something that depends on the field extension that you have forgotten by now, before this gives you the Weil restriction.

There is a reason why Weil restrictions are taken of affine varieties and then glued together.

I'm afraid that saving 17 keystrokes is not worth the misleading terminology. This routine needs a fundamentally different approach before it can be considered for inclusion.
