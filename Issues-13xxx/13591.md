`add_bigoh()` handled negative inputs very inconsistently. Now it tries to
bring the element into the fraction field and apply `add_bigoh()` there.

Additionally, `add_bigoh()` did not work for infinity which can be annoying sometimes:

```
sage: K.one().add_bigoh(infinity)
TypeError: unable to coerce <class 'sage.rings.infinity.PlusInfinity'> to an integer
```

Replying to [roed](#comment%3A3):

Right. This makes more sense. The problem was that it returned `O(3^-1)` in the ring but not in the fraction field — probably we should not allow elements with negative absolute precision in the ring (but this will be a different ticket). I'll change it accordingly.
> * I do think that ZpFM(3,20).one().add_bigoh(10) should not raise an error.  The whole point of fixed modulus elements is that they don't worry about precision.
 
Ok. I'll change that. I have no strong opinion about it.
