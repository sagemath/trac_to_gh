`add_bigoh()` handled negative inputs very inconsistently. Now it tries to
bring the element into the fraction field and apply `add_bigoh()` there.

Additionally, `add_bigoh()` did not work for infinity which can be annoying sometimes:

```
sage: K.one().add_bigoh(infinity)
TypeError: unable to coerce <class 'sage.rings.infinity.PlusInfinity'> to an integer
```

Replying to [@roed314](#comment:3):

Right. This makes more sense. The problem was that it returned `O(3^-1)` in the ring but not in the fraction field — probably we should not allow elements with negative absolute precision in the ring (but this will be a different ticket). I'll change it accordingly.
> * I do think that ZpFM(3,20).one().add_bigoh(10) should not raise an error.  The whole point of fixed modulus elements is that they don't worry about precision.

Ok. I'll change that. I have no strong opinion about it.

-There are a few minor issues with `add_bigoh()` of the padics:
+`add_bigoh()` handled negative inputs very inconsistently. Now it tries to
+bring the element into the fraction field and apply `add_bigoh()` there.
 
-I believe that all these should produce errors:

-sage: K = ZpCR(3,20)
-sage: K.one().add_bigoh(-1)

-sage: K = ZpCA(3,20)

-O(3^0)
-sage: K = ZpFM(3,20)
-sage: K.one().add_bigoh(10)
-1 + O(3^20)
