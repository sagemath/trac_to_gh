This is a followup to #11080. During the review process of #11080, which stretched for quite a while, at some point we decided to have a feature freeze on the version of sagenb 0.9.x associated with #11080, just to simplify the review process. The purpose of this ticket is to incorporate some new features, bugfixes, code refactoring, etc. into the version of sagenb shipped with Sage, beyond what was reviewed in #11080. sagenb 0.10 contains the following (among other things):

* refactoring of the startup code, uWSGI and Tornado added as possible WSGI servers
* code allowing .sws files to be uploaded by supplying a URL pointing to the .sws as an argument to the upload page's URL
* new dependency on webassets for js/css autominification (not currently used in the master branch)
* the mathjax branch, and a doctest fix in sphinxify.py (#9774 depends on and contributed to this)
* support for uploading .sws files from the local disk via the command line (#8473 basically is this)
* refactoring of sageinspect to not have a duplication of code between the notebook and the Sage library (#11913 depends on this)
* Upgrading Jmol again and allowing for advanced interactive features more easily, solve some memory issues (#12299)
* Remove strict dependency on pyOpenSSL; allow for graceful failure of HTTPS functionality when pyOpenSSL is not installed (#13384 and #13385 coordinate with this)

Changes not in sagenb itself but in how sagenb is incorporated into sage:

* No repository will be installed with sagenb - developers will need to clone sagenb themselves and install the new clone into their Sage installation manually (which is not difficult).

* **SPKG**: http://wstein.org/home/keshav/files/sagenb-0.10.2.spkg (a comparatively svelte 13 MB)
* **Apply** [attachment:trac_13121-scripts.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13121/trac_13121-scripts.patch) to the scripts repository.

Sorry for the delay, John.

I'm going to release a 0.10.1 with the fixes for #8473 and also hopefully a fix for Jason Yeo's javascript event shuffling (see comments at the bottom of [PR #69](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/69) on github), so I'm leaving this ticket as needs_work.

after which all proceeds normally.  It just looks a lot like [#11080 comment:314](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/11080#comment:314) so I wondered.

Edit:

```
./spkg-install: line 76: cd: sagenb: No such file or directory

which is weird enough that I must have done something wrong.  I'll try beta0 instead, sorry for the noise.

I've installed this version on Sage-5.2.beta1 and it is still not possible to sign out.

Moreover, when I removed all cookies of the site and got to the login page, I was able to register as a new user and I am pretty sure I have never enabled it (I did add one user manually as admin). I can't reproduce it, however, so maybe I've done something wrong.

Two issues:
1. Evaluate button does not work for a cell until it loses focus to another (pull request 85 on git).
2. Secure mode does not work even with system wide ssl-dev headers ( I have libcurl4-openssl-dev and libssl-dev installed).  Either the specifications or install checking need to be more specific.  I suggest that the spkg check for what is needed and prompts for a local install of openssl if what is needed is not available.

You're welcome.  I was just updating my server so thought I would  try to pile in all the notebook stuff we thought was working.
>

That's all the error output I get when I try to start a secure notebook on my system, without doing a local install of openssl.  Note, that this doesn't happen on all my systems.  I suspect that the way openssl is searched for is not working. Ubuntu 12.04 are the systems I'm having trouble with.

I'll see what I can do.  I think I saved the .tar so can make a clean copy to work with.

I found what seems to be an upstream bug report about this:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/pyopenssl/+bug/845445

Not much progress though.

Jonathan, do you see the non-empty new worksheets problem in the version of the Flask notebook in 5.2?

Other than that, the only remaining work issue before this can be set to needs_review again is for someone to review [this pull request](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/95) which makes pyOpenSSL an optional dependency of sagenb. Once that's in, I'll release 0.10.2 and make a new SPKG, since I have no idea where this non-empty new worksheets problem is coming from, nor can I seem to replicate it...

I haven't seen the problem again since I manually reset my last worksheet id.  However, unless someone added code to check the worksheet directory on launch, I don't think it is fixed.  I only think the problem occurs if the server shuts down inappropriately; thus this should not be a blocker.  I vote for removing it as an issue from this ticket and setting up a separate ticket on the sagenb site.

I like the make pyOpenSSL optional solution.

I'm in my last week of ramp-up to classes, but I will see if I can do a test of things ASAP.

I have just noticed that I cannot stay connected to two notebook servers: both are on the same machine on different ports (usernames and passwords are also different). One is 5.2, another 5.3.rc1+this notebook. When I login to one, another one logs out. This is a bit annoying and such interaction between servers may be dangerous, i.e. now they drop connection because of the other - can there be a situation when logging into one server will trigger logging into another?

OK, Jason please open a ticket in trac (I'm still getting my feet wet with GIT).  Please describe the options you think would be useful to you, remembering that I have not found a way to make live Jmols in interacts reliable over the network without a major rewrite of how interacts work (something I'm not in a position to commit to doing, but think should be done).  Personally, I vote for some kind of a switch.  Please make sure to cc me on the new ticket.

When you try to recover a forgotten password in the new notebook, you are asked for the username, and then get the response "invalid username" even if the username is valid, and the email has been confirmed.


I think that the problem is in the file authentication.py

The function forgot_pass() has the following lines:

```
def forgot_pass():
    if not g.notebook.conf()['email']:
        return current_app.message('The account recovery system is not active.')

    username = request.values.get('username', '').strip()
    if not username:
        return render_template(os.path.join('html', 'accounts', 'account_recovery.html'))

    def error(msg):
        return current_app.message(msg, url_for('forgot_pass'))

    try:
        user = g.notebook.user(request.values[username])
    except KeyError:
        return error('Username is invalid.')

    if not user.is_email_confirmed():
        return error("The e-mail address hasn't been confirmed.")

    #XXX: some of this could be factored out into a random passowrd
    #function.  There are a few places in admin.py that also use it.
    from random import choice
    import string
    chara = string.letters + string.digits
    old_pass = user.password()
    password = ''.join([choice(chara) for i in range(8)])
    user.set_password(password)

    from sagenb.notebook.smtpsend import send_mail
    from sagenb.notebook.register import build_password_msg
    # TODO: make this come from the server settings

    listenaddr = g.notebook.interface
    port = g.notebook.port
    fromaddr = 'no-reply@%s' % listenaddr
    body = build_password_msg(password, username, listenaddr, port, g.notebook.secure)
    destaddr = user.get_email()
    try:
        send_mail(fromaddr, destaddr, "Sage Notebook Account Recovery", body)
    except ValueError:
        # the email address is invalid
        user.set_password(old_pass)
        return error("The new password couldn't be sent."%destaddr)

    return current_app.message("A new password has been sent to your e-mail address.", url_for('base.index'))
```

But 

```
    try:
        user = g.notebook.user(request.values[username])
```

doesn't work because username is already defined as 

```
   username = request.values.get('username', '').strip()
```


Also, the process of changing passwords with user.set_password() does not work. I think g.notebook.user_manager().set_password(g.username, new) should be used instead (that is what settings.py does).
