It seems that nothing really guarantees the existence of the directory `SAGE_EXTCODE` (`$SAGE_ROOT/local/share/sage/ext`) apart from the installers of some packages.

If Sage is started when that directory doesn't exist:

```
[...lots of stuff...]
/release/merger/sage-5.7.beta0/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/interfaces/gap.py in <module>()
   1457 # if the modification time of the gap link has changed (which signals
   1458 # that gap has been somehow upgraded).
-> 1459 if not os.path.exists(WORKSPACE) or os.path.getmtime(WORKSPACE) < os.path.getmtime(GAP_STAMP):
   1460     #print "Automatically updating the cached Gap workspace:"
   1461     #print WORKSPACE

/release/merger/sage-5.7.beta0/local/lib/python/genericpath.py in getmtime(filename)
     52 def getmtime(filename):
     53     """Return the last modification time of a file, reported by os.stat()."""
---> 54     return os.stat(filename).st_mtime
     55
     56
```

This is a regression because conway_polynomials from #12205 **runs Sage code at build time** at a time when the existence of `SAGE_EXTCODE` is not guaranteed.

The attached patch solves this problem in two ways:
* It only checks for and generates workspaces when actually starting GAP, not when Sage is started.
* Instead of using `SAGE_EXTCODE` (which doesn't really make sense), check the modification time of `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gap`.

Minor comments:

* `GAP_BINARY` is misleading, as `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gap` is a shell script.

* A failure upon creation of `README.txt` is silently ignored in the first place.  (This has been in before.)

* The created README could contain a note on the automatic deletion of old GAP workspaces.




Avoiding to think of the race conditions we may run into here... ;-)

I think that the name `GAP_SCRIPT` would be even more misleading.  Besides, for this code it doesn't really matter whether it's a binary or a script, it's only needed to check the time when GAP was installed.

> Avoiding to think of the race conditions we may run into here... ;-)

It mainly depends on how GAP's `SaveWorkspace()` is implemented because that would be the most obvious place to check for race conditions.

P.S.:

Well, a *binary* is more likely to change upon reinstallation than some (more or less generic) script.

(Haven't checked whether it actually gets [re-]created by the GAP spkg.)

I'd still let `-O0` override a user's O-level (in `$CFLAGS`) if `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`, like most -- if not all -- other spkgs do.

And while you're at it, change the `==` to `=` there, and/or use `[This is the Trac macro *... * that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#... -macro)`.

There are also a few error checks missing, and `SPKG_ROOT` isn't always quoted.  (One should also probably do some sanity check on `$VERSION` at least.)

The `-f` in `ln -sf ... latest` is redundant, as we always first delete the symbolic link (if present).

I don't think Sage should ever override user-chosen flags, so we should always do

```
CFLAGS="-sage -specific -flags $CFLAGS"

Well, IMHO depends.  If `-foo` is mandatory to not break the build, it should be *ap*pended; same for options to `configure`.  (`-L` is even more troublesome, and `-I-` for example isn't portable.)

Unfortunately there's not always an option to toggle or invalidate a previously (i.e., "user-specified") option, and flags may even conflict.  (The same is true for the opposite case, when a user wants to override some option added by Sage or an spkg's build system.  This especially holds for `-g`, which we almost always add by default -- thereby probably already overriding a user's choice; stripping afterwards may be inappropriate in some cases.)

If a user sets `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`, he will or should be aware of the consequences, which are documented (I think), and usually subject of a corresponding warning message.  If someone really wants to do debugging without e.g. `-O0`, he'll certainly be able to modify `spkg-install` for that purpose, which is trivial.  Temporarily modifying `C*FLAGS` is more tedious, and less experienced users may have (more or less intentionally) some of them set, while still expecting `SAGE_DEBUG` to work as advertised, without having to mess with other environment variables.

Ideally, we'd have some `SAGE_DEBUG_LEVEL`, or we'd at least separate "standard" compiler options *probably* useful for debugging (such as `-O0`) from usually package-specific ones, like `-DDEBUG_FOO`;  `configure` may also take special debug options specific to the package (which IMHO is the main reason we do have `SAGE_DEBUG`).

Until we have `SAGE_DEBUG_CFLAGS`, say, which could easily be set/modified by the user, I'd still (try to) override e.g. `-O2` by default (if `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` of course).

I don't think there are many situations where it's known that a flag is absolutely required to not break the build.  I like the principle of "the user knows best" and not "the Sage developers know best".

> This especially holds for `-g`

The `-g` option can be cancelled by `-g0`.

> If a user sets `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`, he will or should be aware of the consequences

Sure, but exactly the same holds for `CFLAGS`.

> If someone really wants to do debugging without e.g. `-O0`, he'll certainly be able to modify `spkg-install` for that purpose, which is trivial.

So now we require users to **modify a spkg** to get the options they want?  Why make things hard which should be easy?

> Temporarily modifying `C*FLAGS` is more tedious

Why that?  Changing `CFLAGS` is equally easy as changing `SAGE_DEBUG`.

> and less experienced users may have (more or less intentionally) some of them set

Why do you think that?  Are there any distributions which have `CFLAGS` set in the environment by default?
