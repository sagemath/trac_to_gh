For testing purposes, or just to have the latest GCC, some people might prefer GCC-4.7.2 over the Sage-shipped GCC-4.6.3.

**spkg**: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/gcc-4.7.2.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/gcc-4.7.2.spkg) (based on the gcc-4.6.3 spkg by just bumping the `src/` directory version).

**md5sum:** `ea1018aa0020d534b830d2952ea6c7cc  gcc-4.7.2.spkg`

This includes *all* of GCC, i.e. also Java, Go, Objective-C,... compilers in addition to C, C++ and Fortran in the Sage GCC spkg.

FWIW, R 2.14.0 still fails to build (segfault when byte-compiling package "base") with GCC 4.7.1 and `-O3`, like it did with [FSF GCC] 4.7.0, at least on Ubuntu x86_64.




More related to this ticket (or the GCC spkg in general), ECL somehow gets confused if the "native" GCC has libffi, and fails to build because the spkg's GCC doesn't provide it (and ECL doesn't build its own either).

But maybe my installation is somehow "messed up", or at least untypical:

While `ffi.h` is located in `/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.{6.3,7.0}/include/`, the libraries (including unversioned `.so`s) are installed in `/usr/{lib,lib32}/`; the original Ubuntu GCC 4.4.3 doesn't come with libffi.

Ah, while writing, I did again take a closer look at the build logs...  The following should certainly get fixed:

```

checking for C compiler default output file name... a.out
checking whether the C compiler works... yes
checking whether we are cross compiling... no

```
(Note the `CPP` setting; `gcc` is `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/gcc`.)

It's rather luck that only the ECL spkg is affected; we should either set `CPP` properly or unset it (before `sage-env` is called) if we're using Sage's GCC.

Similar is probably true for `FC`, `F77` etc.:

```sh
$ ./sage --sh -c 'env | egrep -w "CC|CPP|CXX|FC|F77"' 
CPP=cpp-4.7.0
F77=gfortran-4.7.0
CXX=g++
FC=gfortran-4.7.0
CC=gcc
```
(I don't set `F95` and the like, others may perhaps.)

Looks like we just have to extend the following part of `spkg/bin/sage-env`:

```
...

# Override CC and CXX if the gcc spkg was installed.
if [ -x "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gcc" ]; then
    CC=gcc
fi
if [ -x "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/g++" ]; then
    CXX=g++
fi
export CC CXX
```

I'm not sure how to handle Java, Objective C/C++ etc. if compilers for these get also built by Sage's GCC spkg.  (I only recall some Objective C was used on MacOS X by some spkg[s].)

P.S.:

More problems will arise if `CFLAGS` et al. have been set by the user, but Sage's compiler versions don't understand / support these.  In that case we may have to make excessive use of `testcflags` (`testcxxflags`, `testfflags`, ...?) to sort out such options, or at least exit early with an appropriate error message.

Don't know whether that interferes / is consistent with the `SAGE_FORTRAN` variable and/or the odd `sage_fortran` script (which should IMHO get removed anyway).

Setting / overriding `OBJC` etc. may not be necessary at the moment, but certainly would make sense, too, if we build compilers for more languages (as is currently the case with the GCC 4.7.x spkg).
