Presently, #715 + #11521 help not permanently keeping parent in memory. In the process we uncovered a hard-but-consistently triggerable problem with the collection of `MPolynomialRing_libsingular`. We have only observed the problem on `bsd.math.washington.edu`, MacOSX 10.6 on x86_64.

The present work-around is to permanently store references to these upon creation, thus preventing collection. It would be nice if we could properly solve the problem (or at least establish that the problem is specific to `bsd.math`)

On 5.4-beta0 + #715 + #11521, there is a doctest failure on `bsd.math.washington.edu`, an x86_64 machine running MacOSX 10.6:

```
bash-3.2$ ../../sage -t sage/misc/cachefunc.pyx
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/misc/cachefunc.pyx"          
The doctested process was killed by signal 11
         [12.7 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


        sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/misc/cachefunc.pyx" # Killed/crashed
Total time for all tests: 12.7 seconds
```
The segmentation fault happens reliably, but is hard to study because
- running the same examples in an interactive session does not trigger the problem
- running with `sage -t -gdb` (yes, that's possible!) or `sage -t --verbose` does not trigger the problem.
- the order of tests in the file seems fairly important. You can change and
delete some tests but not others. The likely explanation is that a garbage
collection has to be triggered under the right conditions, so that the memory
corruption (which likely happens upon deallocate somewhere) happens in the right
spot.

The segfault happens in the doctest for `CachedMethodCaller._instance_call` (line 1038 in the sage source; `example_27` in the file `~/.sage/tmp/cachefunc_*.py` left after doctesting), in the line

```
            sage: P.<a,b,c,d> = QQ[]
```
Further instrumentation showed that the segfault happens in 
`sage/libs/singular/ring. pyx`, in `singular_ring_new`, in the part that copies the strings over.

```diff
+    sys.stderr.write("before _names allocation\n")
     _names = <char**>omAlloc0(sizeof(char*)*(len(names)))
+    sys.stderr.write("after _names allocation\n")

     for i from 0 <= i < n:
         _name = names[i]
+        sys.stderr.write("calling omStrDup for i=%s with name=%s\n"%(i,names[i])
        _names[i] = omStrDup(_name)
+        sys.stderr.write("after omStrDup\n")
```
The call `_omStrDup` segfaults for `i=1`. Unwinding the `_omStrDup` call:

```diff
     for i from 0 <= i < n:
         _name = names[i]
+        sys.stderr.write("calling omStrDup for i=%s with name=%s\n"%(i,names[i]))
-        _names[i] = omStrDup(_name)
+        j = 0
+        while <bint> _name[j]:
+            j+=1
+        j+=1     #increment to include the 0
+        sys.stderr.write("string length (including 0) seems to be %s\n"%j)
+        copiedname =  <char*>omAlloc(sizeof(char)*(j+perturb))
+        sys.stderr.write("Done reserving memory buffer; got address %x\n"%(<long>copiedname))
+        for 0 <= offset < j:
+            sys.stderr.write("copying character nr %s\n"%offset)
+            copiedname[offset] = _name[offset]
+        _names[i] = copiedname
+        sys.stderr.write("after omStrDup\n")
```
shows that it's actually the `omAlloc` call segfaulting. For `perturb=7` or higher, the segfault does not happen. For `perturb` a lower value it does. Given that the omAlloc addresses returned on earlier calls do not seem close to a page boundary, the only way `omAlloc` can fail is basically by a corrupted freelist an 8-byte bin. Likely culprits:
- a double free (although I'd expect that would trigger problems on more architectures)
- someone writing out-of-bounds in omAlloc-managed memory.
Perhaps someone claiming an `<int>,<int>` structure and storing a `<void *>` in the second one?

Note the `<char*>` to `<long>` cast in the print statement. With an `<int>`, the compiler complains
about loss of precision, but not with `<long>`. I haven't checked whether
`<long>` is really 64 bits on this machine, though.
 
I have tried and the problem seems to persist with the old singular (5.4b0 has a
recently upgraded singular).

It would help a lot if someone could build singular to use plain malloc
throughout and then use valgrind or a similar tool, which should be able to
immediately catch a double free or out-of-bounds error. If the root of the
problem is not OSX-specific, this would even show up on other architectures.

295] and below for some more details on how the diagnosis above was obtained.

OK, I did a little experiment and tried to build singular with plain malloc rather than omalloc. In principle, omalloc has an `--with-emulate...` flag, but the API offered in that mode is woefully incomplete for singular use. I tried to extend it a little. Very rough result:

[http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nbruin/singular-3-1-5.malloc.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nbruin/singular-3-1-5.malloc.spkg)

One problem is supplying a `memdup`, which needs to know the size of an allocated block from its pointer. On BSD, you can use `malloc_size` for that. On linux one could use `malloc_usable_size`. The rest is a whole swath of routines that need to be supplied.

The package above is very dirty, but on bsd.math it did provide me with an apparently working libsingular. The singular executable produced didn't seem usable, so keep your old one!

The doctest passes! Not exactly what we were hoping for, but it does make a double-free unlikely. That would have been detected. Corruption after freeing could still be possible, since `malloc` allocates way bigger blocks, so freelist data is likely missed.

There is of course also the possibility of some routine writing out of bounds, which is less likely to trigger problems with malloc too.

Singular people might be interested in incorporating the changes to omalloc (and preferrably extend them a little bit) so that `--with-emulate...` becomes a viable option for Singular debugging. Then you can valgrind singular code.

I think Martin should be Cc for this as well.

I am not sure if changing to malloc is an acceptable option for Singular. If I understand correctly, omalloc is very important for having a good performance in Gröbner basis computations.

Replying to [SimonKing](#comment%3A6):
> I am not sure if changing to malloc is an acceptable option for Singular. 

I am sure it is not acceptable for production, but being able to swap out omalloc for debugging can be very useful. That's why I tried. I understand that there are great tools to do memory management debugging and omalloc puts them all out of play because it hides all memory alloc/free activity.

It seems omalloc has its own tools but I wasn't able to get them working, I've seen indications that they don't work on 64 bits, and there's a good chance they're not as good as the general ones because they're for a smaller market.

I'm sure someone more familiar with the Singular and omalloc code bases can make a more informed decision on whether having the option of straight malloc memory management for debugging is worthwhile. My initial finding is that it quite likely can be done with relatively small modifications. I got it to more or less work in an evening, while being unfamiliar with the code.

      SMC Version (processor tray): 1.39f11

    System Software Overview:

      System Version: Mac OS X 10.6.8 (10K549)
      Kernel Version: Darwin 10.8.0
      64-bit Kernel and Extensions: Yes
      Time since boot: 16 days 6:14
```
Both these machines exhibit the same problem that on 5.4b0 + #715 + #11521, the doctest for `cachefunc.pyx` segfaults in the same spot.
Note that the iMac claims to not have a 64-bit kernel. Sage is compiled to be 64-bit on that machine, though (and seems to work).

Have we actually established that this bug does not occur on newer OSX versions?

And have we actually established that this problem does not occur with older Singular versions? I am not totally sure, but I think the problem with #715+#11521 first emerged in sage-5.4.beta0, when Singular-3-1-5 was merged.

Quoting from[comment:1](#comment%3A1)
>>I have tried and the problem seems to persist with the old singular (5.4b0 has a recently upgraded singular).


In the mean time, a bit of googling led me to OSX's "GuardMalloc". While sage+`singular-malloc` does not crash on the doctest, it does crash when run with

```
export DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/libgmalloc.dylib
```
Since gmalloc is a memory manager that places each allocation on its own page with protected/unmapped memory as close as possible around the block and that unmaps the block as soon as freed (I'm just parroting the manpage), a segfault is likely due to an access-after-free or access-out-of-bounds -- the one that would normally cause the corruption and then the segfault much later. (that's the whole idea of replacing omalloc -- I don't think it's doable to get omalloc to segfault on an access-after-free). This all comes at a significant speed penalty of course, so experiments are painful and I wouldn't even be able to interpret the backtrace/coredump if I got it (I'd hope that the gmalloc-induced segfault would be reproducible in gdb). It would really be useful if the test file would be pared down to an absolute minimum. That's basically just a backtracking search on which elements can be removed while still triggering a segfault.

However, I think this is a strong indication that there is a real memory violation at the base of this and that it is tracable.

Then, I ran `python -t` on the segfaulting test. Observation: It happens precisely twice that "WARNING" is printed, i.e., the `__dealloc__` method is called even though there remain multiple references to the underlying libsingular ring.

In both cases it is `QQ['a','b','c','d']`.  Here is a snipped from the output:

However, I am not totally sure whether this indicates a problem, because in both cases the remaining references are immediately removed. Also, it is always the case that 4 references are set to the libsingular ring before actually creating the polynomial ring in Sage.

One last observation: You may notice a libsingular ring at address 4409549416 that is referenced here as well, aparently in the middle of the construction of `QQ['a','b','c','d']`. It is later used for `QQ['x','y','z']`. The last report before the segfault is 

```
reference 32 to 4409549416, wrapper 4302568952
```

Seems like a wild-goose chase to me, though.

Result: No segfault. OSX comes with `gmalloc`, which is a guarded malloc for debugging purposes. It places every allocation on a separate page and unmaps that page upon freeing.

OK! good progress. Instrumenting `sagedoc.py` a little bit we can indeed see the order in which the doctests are executed:

```
`__main__`
`__main__`.change_warning_output
`__main__`.check_with_tolerance
`__main__`.example_0
`__main__`.example_1
`__main__`.example_10
`__main__`.example_11
`__main__`.example_12
`__main__`.example_13
`__main__`.example_14
`__main__`.example_15
`__main__`.example_16
`__main__`.example_17
`__main__`.example_18
`__main__`.example_19
`__main__`.example_2
`__main__`.example_20
`__main__`.example_21
`__main__`.example_22
`__main__`.example_23
`__main__`.example_24
`__main__`.example_25
`__main__`.example_26
`__main__`.example_27
Unhandled SIGSEGV
```
so that indeed seems to be alphabetical order.

Now let's run the doctests with singular-using-malloc. Result: No segfault. OSX comes with `gmalloc`, which is a guarded malloc for debugging purposes. It places every allocation on a separate page and unmaps that page upon freeing. So, any access-after-free leads to a segfault. Now we do get a segfault and it happens a lot sooner than `example_27`. In fact, now the segfault survives in `gdb`. The error happens when executing

```
G = I.groebner_basis()###line 921:_sage_    >>> G = I.groebner_basis()
```

Here's a session with `gdb` once the segfault has happened. I think I have been able to extract enough data to point at the probably problem.

####NB: because gmalloc has unmapped the page, cause a segfault)
####NB: Could it be that the code here should really test for uring being still valid?

```
So I think the issue is in `sage.lib.singular.function.call_function`:

```
...
    if currRingHdl.data.uring!= currRing:
        currRingHdl.data.uring.ref -= 1
        currRingHdl.data.uring = currRing # ref counting?
        currRingHdl.data.uring.ref += 1
...
```
The evidence points absolutely to `currRingHdl.data.uring` pointing to unallocated (probably freed) memory. The access then of course can have all kinds of effects. At this point it is probably doable for a `LibSingular` expert to reason about the code whether `uring` should always be valid at this point (I suspect not).

It looks suspicious to me that `sage.libs.singular.ring.singular_ring_delete` does do a careful dance to zero out the `currRing` variable but doesn't seem to care about `currRngHdl`. I also find it worrying that there apparently is a refcount system right on the ring structures (as you can see above) and yet in `singular_ring_delete` a separate refcounting dict is used. One would think the same refcounting system should be borrowed by `singular_ring_new` and `singular_ring_delete`. It looks to me the code above thinks that by increasing `...uring.ref` the reference is protected, but `singular_ring_delete` doesn't seem to take into account this refcount. It could well be that I'm misinterpreting the code and that this is all perfectly safe, though.

Libsingular specialists: Keep in mind that in principle, singular code can get executed in rather awkward moments, possibly as part of clean-ups of circular garbage and call-backs on weakref cleanup, where equality might be tested of objects that are soon to be deallocated themselves.

The fickleness of the bug is consistent with this condition arising during a cyclic garbage collection with just the right amount of junk around. That would make the occurrence of the bug depend on just about everything in memory. Or at least if you depend on the corruption leading to a segfault, it depends on which location exactly gets corrupted.

I think we might be getting close to a badge for debugging excellence here!

I didn't test the patch yet. However, it seems very straight forward to me: There already is a refcounting, and thus one should use it. I am Cc'ing Volker Braun and Martin von Gagern, the authors of #11339. Does [attachment:trac_13447-consolidated_refcount.patch] make sense to you as well?

Keeping a double refcount (as with [attachment:trac_13447-double_refcount.patch] seems suspicious to me.

Perhaps one should let the patchbots test it? Thus, I'll add this as dependency for #715, and for the patchbot:

Apply trac_13447-consolidated_refcount.patch

PS: You really deserve a badge for debugging excellence! Do I understand correctly that the bug is *not* on the side of Singular? I'll inform Hans accordingly.

Two errors mentioned in[comment:18](#comment%3A18) look (again) difficult.

The first one:

Hence, the way how one refcounts libsingular rings influences the dimension of Hecke modules. Strange at least...

Note, however, that the value returned by the "dimension()" method above is not constant, because it only returns a lower bound (if I recall correctly) that is increased when one learns more about the Hecke module. Hence, it could very well be that `ModularSymbols(20,2).boundary_space()` used to be cached but is now garbage collected, so that information on the dimension is lost.

The second error is apparently ignored and only printed to stderr:

I have seen that error before, with other work-arounds (and I think also with `singular-malloc`), so if it's indeed only a lower bound, then sage has merely changed. It's not an error. If you're worried you can see where that dimension is computed and put a hard ref in the creation of the relevant object. If garbage collection is the cause of the observed amnesia, a hard ref should "solve" it. In that case you can just change the doctest answer.

This is a worrisome error because it's fickle. One a linux x86_64 box, get this reliably in `sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx`. When I let it print the lines it's doctesting I get:

```

change_warning_output(sys.stdout)
F = GF(Integer(7)**Integer(2), names=('a',)); (a,) = F._first_ngens(1)###line 1913:_sage_    >>> F.<a> = GF(7^2)
R = F['x, y']; (x, y,) = R._first_ngens(2)###line 1914:_sage_    >>> R.<x,y> = F[]
p = a*x**Integer(2) + y + a**Integer(3); p###line 1915:_sage_    >>> p = a*x^2 + y + a^3; p
q = copy(p)###line 1917:_sage_    >>> q = copy(p)
p == q###line 1918:_sage_    >>> p == q
p is q###line 1920:_sage_    >>> p is q
lst = [p,q];###line 1922:_sage_    >>> lst = [p,q];
matrix(ZZ, Integer(2), Integer(2), lambda i,j: bool(lst[i]==lst[j]))###line 1923:_sage_    >>> matrix(ZZ, 2, 2, lambda i,j: bool(lst[i]==lst[j]))
Exception AttributeError: AttributeError('PolynomialRing_field_with_category' object has no attribute '_modulus',) in  ignored
Exception AttributeError: AttributeError('PolynomialRing_field_with_category' object has no attribute '_modulus',) in  ignored

sig_on_count()
```
so it happens when doctesting line 1923. These are probably errors encountered during a dealloc, so it might be happening in a garbage collection. It could also be a `WeakValueDict` deletion callback that's trying to do a comparison that fails. Googling shows that you've asked about that exact error message on `cython-users` on 27 January, 2012, so if you solved the bug that led to that question then, perhaps you can also solve this one. It could also be a straight memory corruption. [**edit**:] OK that was on #11521. You didn't really find that error. You just made it go away by inserting a garbage collection.

I am not a number theorist, but I have learnt from the code that the dimension is computed from the number of "cusps". Hence, if one adds the compution of cusps to that test and assigns the involved Hecke modules to variables, then the tests pass:

```
            sage: M = ModularSymbols(20, 2)
            sage: B = M.boundary_space(); B
            Space of Boundary Modular Symbols for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(20) of weight 2 and over Rational Field
            sage: M.cusps()
            [Infinity, 0, -1/4, 1/5, -1/2, 1/10]            
            sage: M.dimension()
            7
            sage: B.dimension()
            6
```

I think this would be a good solution.

Agreed.

> Googling shows that you've asked about that exact error message on `cython-users` on 27 January, 2012, so if you solved the bug that led to that question then, perhaps you can also solve this one.


Yes, but that question was a pure Cython question, namely like: "Wouldn't it be a good idea to print the function name in which an error was ignored, rather than printing an empty string? That would help debugging."

> It could also be a straight memory corruption. [**edit**:] OK that was on #11521. You didn't really find that error.


Yes. But if it surfaces again, we should now solve it for good. I guess deletion from a weak dictionary is a likely candidate.

I only find two files in sage/rings/ where the string "._modulus" occurs: polynomial_ring.py and polynomial_zz_pex.pyx:

```

devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring.py:            self._modulus = ntl_ZZ_pEContext(ntl_ZZ_pX(list(base_ring.polynomial()), p))
```

Hence, it should be easy to find out which of the few locations is actually involved.

Printing messages to stderr, it seems to me that the error occurs during deallocation of a polynomial template, namely in sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_template.pxi:

```
    def `__dealloc__`(self):
        """
        EXAMPLE::

            sage: P.<x> = GF(2)[]
            sage: del x
        """
        celement_destruct(&self.x, get_cparent((<Polynomial_template>self)._parent))
```

Is the cparent of self deallocated too early (perhaps because the refcounting is still not accurate)?

Or is it a nasty race condition? Namely:

* A polynomial p in a polynomial ring R is about to be garbage collected.
* All python stuff is deleted first. In particular, p's reference to its parent R is gone.
* Incidentally, because the reference from p to R is gone, R can now be collected as well.
* When R gets deleted, its underlying libsingular ring is deallocated.
* Now, `p.__dealloc__` is finally called, and tries to access the underlying libsingular ring - but it is too late.

Question: If a polynomial is created, will the reference counter to the underlying libsingular ring be incremented?

From what I understand, `__dealloc__` methods cannot assume that python attributes are still valid. They fundamentally cannot, because otherwise it wouldn't be possible to clean up cyclic garbage (`__del__` methods are run when all attributes are valid and hence if they are present in cyclic garbage, it is not cleared).

We have:

```
    def `__dealloc__`(self):
        celement_destruct(&self.x, get_cparent((<Polynomial_template>self)._parent))
```
and for us:

```
get_cparent(parent) == <ntl_ZZ_pEContext_class>(parent._modulus)
```
The `_parent` attribute is a cython slot. However, it holds a reference to a python-managed object, so I think cython ensures it's properly taken into account in GC cycle counting. But that would suggest to me python could clear this slot to break cycles! So in that case, `Polynomial_template` is never safe. It could be I'm wrong, however.

I haven't been able to locate what `parent._modulus` is in this case. However,

```
sage: K.<a>=GF(next_prime(2**60)**3)
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(K,implementation='NTL')
sage: '_modulus' in  R.__dict__.keys()
True
```
suggests this attribute is stored in a dictionary. It's set in `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring.PolynomialRing_field.__init__`:1367

```
        if implementation == "NTL" and is_FiniteField(base_ring) and not(sparse):
            from sage.libs.ntl.ntl_ZZ_pEContext import ntl_ZZ_pEContext
            from sage.libs.ntl.ntl_ZZ_pX import ntl_ZZ_pX
            from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_zz_pex import Polynomial_ZZ_pEX

            p=base_ring.characteristic()
            self._modulus = ntl_ZZ_pEContext(ntl_ZZ_pX(list(base_ring.polynomial()), p))
            element_class = Polynomial_ZZ_pEX
```
I guess we've just found that this is not a very good place to store `_modulus`. Where else, though?

Interestingly, there is no complaint about a missing attribute `_parent`. It is `_modulus` that is missing.

But that would suggest to me python could clear this slot to break cycles! So in that case, `Polynomial_template` is never safe. It could be I'm wrong, however.

Why don't you do something along the lines of:

```
cdef cparent get_cparent(parent) except? NULL:
    if parent is None:
        return NULL
    cdef ntl_ZZ_pEContext_class c 
    try:
        c = parent._modulus
    except KeyError:
        c = <some vaguely appropriate proxy value>
    return &(c.x)
```
This should really only be happening upon deletion anyway and I I'd be surprised if having the correct `_modulus` is very important at that point. It's a dirty hack but alternatives probably mean a full reimplementation of these polynomial rings.

Looking in ntl_ZZ_pEX_linkage seems to indicate it only leads to

```
if parent != NULL: parent[0].restore()
```
so perhaps you can just use `NULL` as a proxy value!

Great! I didn't expect that NULL would work here, because, after all, c-data of a polynomial is supposed to be deallocated with the help of c-data of a polynomial ring `celement_destruct(&self.x, get_cparent((<Polynomial_template>self)._parent))` - but if someone has already thought of the possibility that the parent is invalid, then doing the same with an invalid parent._modulus seems the right thing to do.

While we are at it, I changed the "Reported Upstream" field, because it isn't an upstream bug, after all.

A bit later today, I will also provide a patch fixing the Hecke module dimensions, as in[comment:23](#comment%3A23). Do you want me to ask a number theorists whether the fix ("Compute the cusps, which implies that the dimension is computed as well") is mathematically correct?

I have provided a new patch, that removes the custom refcounter, using Singular's refcounter (ring.ref) instead.

As I have announced, I also fixed the failing modular symbols test, by computing the dimension before displaying it: The test previously worked *only* because a computation happened in a different test that happened to be executed early enough, that side effect being possible because Hecke modules would stay in memory permanently.

I did not run the full test suite yet. But sage/rings/polynomial/plural.pyx and sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx and sage/modular/modsym/ambient.py all work.

Problems for the release manager and the reviewer:

* I removed the custom refcounting. But there were tests using the custom refcounters. The original tests demonstrated that the underlying c-data (the libsingular ring) is properly deleted. I replaced them by tests showing that the `MPolynomialRing_libsingular` get garbage collected. Is that OK from your point of view?

* The mentioned tests will *only* work with #715 and #11521, because they are responsible for making polynomial rings garbage collectable. Hence, #13447 and #715 and #11521 need to be merged together; just having #715 and #11521 would result in the OS X problem we encountered, and #13447 alone would have two failing tests.

* #13145 has already been merged in sage-5.4.beta1. I suggest to unmerge it, because it uses the old unreliable "double refcount" approach. My new patch also takes care of refcounting of plural rings.

Good news! With the new patches, i.e.

trac_715_safer.patch
trac_715_specification.patch

trac_13447-consolidated_refcount.patch
trac_13447-modulus_fix.patch
trac_13447-rely_on_singular_refcount.patch
```
there is only one crash with make ptest, namely

```
sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/libs/singular/groebner_strategy.pyx # Killed/crashed
```

The crash seems harmless, this time: It occurs at `strat = GroebnerStrategy(None)`, and I suspect that the attempt to incref "None" is a bad idea...

While we are at it: Perhaps it would be better to *not* unmerge #13145, but to use it as a dependency.

<a id='comment:37'></a>
Having a function that shows the refcount really is a good idea! I already found that elements of a non-commutative ring do not increment the refcount to the underlying "libplural" ring.

Anyway, a new test in the commutative setting shall be:

```
            sage: import gc
            sage: gc.collect()  # random
            sage: R.<x,y,z> = GF(5)[]
            sage: R._get_refcount()
            7
            sage: p = x*y+z
            sage: R._get_refcount()
            8
            sage: del p
            sage: gc.collect()  # random
            sage: R._get_refcount()
            7
```

Of course, the question is whether we really need to incref the ring if we create an element. I think, in the commutative case, it *is* needed, because deallocation of an element refers to the cparent.

It could be that in the non-commutative case we have already a work-around:

```
    def `__dealloc__`(self):
        # TODO: Warn otherwise!
        # for some mysterious reason, various things may be NULL in some cases
        if self._parent is not <ParentWithBase>None and (<NCPolynomialRing_plural>self._parent)._ring != NULL and self._poly != NULL:
            p_Delete(&self._poly, (<NCPolynomialRing_plural>self._parent)._ring)
```

I think we could leave it like that, for now. If someone feels it is needed, then he/she may change `NCPolynomial_plural` to use templates.

There is one nasty detail with singular_function. If one sets `ring = singular_function('ring')` and then uses the singular_function to create a ring, then its reference counter is *not* incremented, even though the following function is called in this case:

```
cdef inline RingWrap new_RingWrap(ring* r):

    ring_wrap_result._ring = r
    ring_wrap_result._ring.ref += 1
    
    return ring_wrap_result
```

I do not understand it, yet. But anyway, that's the problem I am currently dealing with.

The problems that I mentioned are now solved with the new patch version.

Note that the new patch is relative to #13145, which I made a new dependency for #715.

So, for the record:

```
$ hg qa
trac_715_combined.patch
trac_715_local_refcache.patch
trac_715_safer.patch
trac_715_specification.patch
trac_11521_homset_weakcache_combined.patch
trac_11521_callback.patch
13145.patch
trac_13447-consolidated_refcount.patch
trac_13447-modulus_fix.patch
trac_13447-rely_on_singular_refcount.patch
```

Let's keep the fingers crossed that the tests pass this time.

Hooray!

All tests passed!

```
And I did not notice any "ignored" errors.

I think I can give Nils' part of the patches a positive review, and suggest a cross-review.

Now I think I understand:

`currRingHdl = enterid("my_awesome_sage_ring", 0, RING_CMD, &IDROOT, 1)` has the purpose to create `currRingHdl` (it is only called if `currRingHdl==NULL`), but the value assigned to `currRingHdl.data.uring` is *invalid*. In particular, the attempt to change to `currRingHdl.data.uring` results in a segfault. Hence, `singular_ring_delete(currRingHdl.data.uring)` would not work.

Solution: We create `currRingHdl`, but we immediately delete the invalid `currRingHdl.data.uring` and replace it by a new reference to `currRing`. If there is no `currRing` then I print a warning, but I hope that we will never see that warning...

I'm not so sure that

```python
    currRingHdl = enterid("my_awesome_sage_ring", 0, RING_CMD, &IDROOT, 1) 
    currRingHdl.data.uring.ref += 1
```
is entirely safe. In 'libsing-test2.cc' (in the Singular package, the following similar code is used:

```C++
    // prepare the arguments
    // create a ring Q[x,y]
      // the variable names
      char **n=(char**)omAlloc(2*sizeof(char*));
      n[0]=(char*)"x";
      n[1]=(char*)"y";
      // create the ring
      ring R=rDefault(0,2,n);
      // n is not needed any more:
      omFreeSize(n,2*sizeof(char*));
    // make it the default ring, also for the interpeter
    idhdl newRingHdl=enterid("R" /* ring name*/,
                           0, /*nesting level, 0=global*/
                           RING_CMD,
                           &IDROOT,
                           FALSE);
    IDRING(newRingHdl)=R;
    rSetHdl(newRingHdl);
```
I'd assume `IDRING(newRingHdl)` is `newRingHdl.data.uring`, so the assignment above does not assume anything about that field being initialized. So who knows where `newRingHdl.data.uring.ref` points!

I get the impression that indeed, `currRing` is set to something valid nearly always, so your assumption that it is during `SingularFunction.__init__` (that's earlier than calling!) might be OK. The singular code does contain an awful lot of `currRing!=NULL` checks though, so I'm not so sure that's really guaranteed.

```
            currRingHdl = enterid("my_awesome_sage_ring", 0, RING_CMD, &IDROOT, 0)
            currRingHdl.data.uring = NULL
```
(or whatever is the appropriate value for uring), as per the libsing example above)

```
    if currRingHdl.data.uring!= currRing: 
        if currRingHdl.data.uring != NULL:
            singular_ring_delete(currRingHdl.data.uring)
        currRingHdl.data.uring = currRing
        singular_ring_reference(currRing) 
```
(or indeed just leave init=1 in place so that `currRingHdl.data.uring` is never NULL. In any case, this happens at most once in any sage session, so the leaked memory (if any) would be minuscule.

Concerning refcounts: I found the following in `dyn_modules/python/ring_wrap.h`

```C++
#include <boost/intrusive_ptr.hpp>
using namespace boost;
//typedef intrusive_ptr<ip_sring> Ring;
// inline void intrusive_ptr_add_ref(ring r){
//     r->ref++;
// }
// inline void intrusive_ptr_release(ring r){
//     r->ref--;
//     if (r->ref<=0) rDelete(r);
// }
```
which is in step with our use of the ref field. But the code is commented out! There is such a thing as an `intrusive_ptr` in Boost and I think it needs exactly those two functions declared to function. If this is what is intended then we're OK. If this is commented out because now a different scheme is used, we may be in trouble.

**EDIT:** `kernel/Number.h` contains uncommented definitions:

```C++
using namespace boost;
inline void intrusive_ptr_add_ref(ring r){
    r->ref++;
    //Print("ref count after add: %d", r->ref);
}
inline void intrusive_ptr_release(ring r){
    if (r->ref<=0) rDelete(r);
    else {
    r->ref--;

    }
    //Print("ref count after release: %d", r->ref);
}
```
I find the `ptr_release` a little worrisome: Do the singular people believe that `r->ref ==0` means that there is still a reference? Do they really want to count references "-1"-based? I guess one can count it as "additional" references. I'm afraid they might. From 
`Singular/ipshell.cc`:

```C++
void rKill(ring r)
{
  if ((r->ref<=0)&&(r->order!=NULL))
  {
...
    rDelete(r);
    return;
  }
  r->ref--;
}

void rKill(idhdl h)
{ 
  ring r = IDRING(h);
  int ref=0;
  if (r!=NULL)
  {
    ref=r->ref;
    rKill(r);
  }
  if (h==currRingHdl)
  { 
    if (ref<=0) { currRing=NULL; currRingHdl=NULL;}
    else
    {
      currRingHdl=rFindHdl(r,currRingHdl,NULL);
    }
  }
}
```
this code all indicates that special action is required only if `ref<=0` 'before' decreasing. Can you check with singular people if that's the correct usage of the `ref` field? If we use it in a different way I image nasty bugs could arise later (our use would prevent singular from ever deleting a ring we've had our hands on (if it would ever do that) and if we get a ring that singular initially constructed, we could delete it prematurely, due to an off-by-one.

In that case we should probably ensure that `singular_ring_ref` and `singular_delete_ring` are somehow aliased to `boost::intrusive_ptr_add_ref` and `intrusive_ptr_release` from `kernel/Number.h`.

According to the code snipped, the ring is deleted if `r->ref==0`. So, apparently `r->ref==0` means that there is *no* reference.

> this code all indicates that special action is required only if `ref<=0` 'before' decreasing.


If `ref<=0` then no reference is left, hence, the ring is deleted. Otherwise, the reference counter is decremented. I really don't understand the problem.

> In that case we should probably ensure that `singular_ring_ref` and `singular_delete_ring` are somehow aliased to `boost::intrusive_ptr_add_ref` and `intrusive_ptr_release` from `kernel/Number.h`.


Singular tests whether `ref<=0`; if it is, then the ring is deleted, but if it isn't then the counter is decremented.

We first decrement the counter, and then test whether `ref<0`; if it is, then the ring is deleted, but if it isn't then no further action is taken.

Isn't that logically the same?

Indeed, but this is tested *before* decrement. So for this to work, you'd need

```
   R=create_ring_with_appropriate_refcount
   // here R.ref should be 0
   //for the following to cause deletion.
   intrusive_ptr_release(R)
```
We initialize `R.ref=1` in `singular_ring_new`.
 
> If `ref<=0` then no reference is left, hence, the ring is deleted. Otherwise, the reference counter is decremented. I really don't understand the problem.


If `ref<=0` BEFORE the reference count is decreased. The difference is that `intrusive_ptr_release` happily leaves a ring in memory that AFTER the call has R.ref==0. Our `singular_ring_delete` will only abstain from calling `rDelete(doomed)` if after the call we have `doomed.ref > 0`.

```
 	401	    doomed.ref = doomed.ref-1 
 	402	    if doomed.ref > 0: 
 	403	        return 
```
The two behaviours are off-by-one.

We don't. We test whether `ref<=0` (or rather whether `ref>0` to see if we should do an early exit).

As our doctests show, apparently we're never calling `singular_ring_delete` on rings we haven't initialized the `ref` field on ourselves and that singular expects to to survive after we do, since that would probably lead to an error (Singular would try to access a deallocated ring).

A mismatch in the other direction would be milder: Singular takes a reference on a ring we initialized the ref field on, we lose our last reference via a `singular_ring_delete` (no rDelete gets called because Singular correctly increased the refcount). However, Singular will never delete the ring because we originally initialized the ref field to 1 whereas Singular apparently expects it to be initialized to 0.

I think that thanks to the `init=1` the memory for the ring is allocated, but initialized to 0 thanks to the `omAlloc0`. My failure to locate a `ref = 1` anywhere in Singular's code also makes me believe that they're happy giving back a ring where `ref = 0`. 

I'm not so sure the `rChangeCurrRing` dance is necessary in `singular_ring_delete`. The code in `intrusive_ptr_release` doesn't need it. I suspect Volker put it in as an extra precaution while he was trying to debug other issues. A cursory reading of the code of `rDelete` doesn't seem to indicate its operation is affected in any way by whether the current ring is equal to the one being deleted.

OK, I asked Hans Schönemann. I hope he'll answer soon.

If `r->ref==0` really means in Singular that there is exactly one reference left, then we should act accordingly.

Hans Schönemann gave me a couple of answers - many thanks! I hope I am translating and summarising correctly:

`r->ref` counts the number of *interpreter variables* referencing a ring *minus one*. Hence:

```
ring r=.....; // ref is 0
def rr=r;     // ref is 1
kill r;       // ref is 0
kill rr;      // ref is 0 when calling rKill -> delete it.
```

There are locally generated rings (in std, for example), unbeknownst to the interpreter - they have ref zero.

Singular uses `r->ref` only in `rKill` - it makes me wonder why we use `rDelete` and not `rKill`, by the way. In fact, `rKill` deletes local data, but `rDelete` doesn't.

Generally, one should have `currRingHdl.ring == currRing`, or `currRing==NULL` and `currRingHdl==NULL`. I just notice that he wrote `currRingHdl.ring`, not `currRingHdl.data.uring` - is that a difference?

Concerning debugging: If one builds Singular so that `OM_NDEBUG` is *not* defined, then a debug version of omalloc is used. In that way, we would have more easily detected the original problem with `omStrDup`.

**Conclusions**

I am not sure if you agree with my conclusions, but here we go:

Since `r->ref` does not play a rôle in libsingular, we are free to use `r->ref` to count the number of pointers to r (not "number of pointers minus one"). However, when calling singular interpreter functions, we must make sure that `r->ref>0`. With our patch, we already do so - hence, that's fine.

Since we apply `singular_ring_delete` to non-commutative (quotient) rings, and we do not call `rKill` but only `rDelete`, we currently have a memory leak for non-commutative rings. `rKill` will first test that `r->ref==0`, then kills local data, then kills the ring, and sets `currRing` and friends to NULL if the to-be-deleted ring is `currRing`. **Hence, we should use `rKill` in `singular_ring_delete`,** but probably without the `rChangeCurrRing` dance.

If `currRing==NULL`, we should *not* create `currRingHdl`. If `currRing!=NULL` then we should let uring point to it. the latter is already done in my patch, **the former should be done.**

So far I forgot to ask Hans about `enterid("my_awesome_sage_ring", 0, RING_CMD, &IDROOT, 1)`.

Or perhaps we do *not* have a leak. Namely, the internal data are also referenced via python, and thus will be deleted when the ring is deleted.

I have updated [attachment:trac_13447-sanitise_ring_refcount.patch].

Changes:

1. `currRingHdl` is only created if `currRing!=NULL`, and `currRingHdl.data.uring` is subsequently set to `currRing`.
2. `singular_ring_delete` is now using `rKill` in lieu of `rDelete`, so that local data are guaranteed to be deallocated.

In my previous comment, I was a bit sceptical about the second point. However, all doctests pass on bsd.math, hence, using `rKill` does not result in a segfault. In other words, the local data are not double-freed, und thus `rKill` is better than `rDelete`.

Here is one comment of Hans on the following lines of the patch:

```
          global currRingHdl
          if currRingHdl == NULL and currRing!=NULL:
              # Create an invalid mock ring - it would not be possible
              # to make that ring currRing!
              # The only aim is to create currRingHdl
              currRingHdl = enterid("my_awesome_sage_ring", 0, RING_CMD, &IDROOT, 1)
              # Now we assign proper data to currRingHdl
              rDelete(currRingHdl.data.uring)
              currRingHdl.data.uring = singular_ring_reference(currRing)
```
He says that it is ok like that. However, it would be better to do

```
          global currRingHdl
          if currRingHdl == NULL and currRing!=NULL:
              # Create an invalid mock ring - it would not be possible
              # to make that ring currRing!
              # The only aim is to create currRingHdl
              currRingHdl = enterid("my_awesome_sage_ring", 0,  RING_CMD, &IDROOT, 0)
              # Now we assign proper data to currRingHdl
              currRingHdl.data.uring = singular_ring_reference(currRing)

```

Note the difference in the last argument of `enterid`.

I'll try it...

Also note that you might be creating a new ringhandle an arbitrary number of times, so knowing whether you leak becomes important. The sequence I use above is what i think the libsingular examples that are shipped with singular do.\n\nYou can already see here that the use of rKill (which does look at reference counts) forces us to follow Singular's conventions of what the `ref` field. At this point we're assuming that if currRingHdl holds the last reference to a ring, we should probably delete it.\n\nI think the convention is that currRingHdl (if it's relevant) is pointing to the same ring as currRing, so they are treated as one reference: `currRingHdl.data.uring = currRing` does not increase a refcount. That obviously leads to problems when `currRing` diverges from `currRingHdl`.\n\nEither you attach memory management ONLY to `currRingHdl` and trust that when `currRing` is changed, someone else will still have a reference to the original value, who can throw away the ring (so, `currRing` is only changed by straight assignments -- no increfs or decrefs. It's always a borrowed reference) or you always ensure that `currRingHdl` gets updated (or at least cleared) when `currRing` changes. My impression is that refcounting in singular is only an interpreter thing, so that the former is the model used by Singular itself.\n\n**Double free implies segfault**: Have you verified this is true with omAlloc?\n\n**Refcounting base**: I agree that as long as our created rings and rings created internally live separate lives, it doesn't matter what semantics we attach to the `ref` field. I just think it's dangerous to implicitly assume these rings do live separate lives. They do now, but who's to guarantee that they do in the future? And even then it may take a long time for a visible error to occur, which by then might be difficult to track down. I think we should adjust to the semantics Singular uses in other places (and document the slightly unusual refcounting semantics of Singular in our code!) to make the libsingular interface as robust as possible. You know how extensions/modifications are going to happen: people will just copy/paste what's already there.",

I'm afraid you (at least theoretically) have recreated the possibility for our original error to occur. We essentially have:

```
SingularFunction.__init__:
	if currRingHdl == NULL and currRing!=NULL: 
            currRingHdl = <create ring handle>
            currRingHdl.data.uring = currRing

SingularFunction.__call__:
	if currRingHdl.data.uring!= currRing: 
	    singular_ring_delete(currRingHdl.data.uring) 
	    currRingHdl.data.uring = singular_ring_reference(currRing)
```
If we init with `currRing == NULL` we may be leaving `currRingHdl == NULL`. If a subsequent invocation of call happens after `currRing` has a new value and `currRingHdl` is not updated (if that would never happen we wouldn't need this code) we'd be calling

```
	if NULL.data.uring!= currRing: 
	    singular_ring_delete(NULL.data.uring) 
	    NULL.data.uring = singular_ring_reference(currRing)
```
which will segfault (OK, this error is much better than the original).

From what you describe, `rKill` can set `currRingHdl=NULL` as well, in which case we definitely get an error in the above code. Thus it seems to me it's theoretically possible that `__call__` happens when `currRingHdl=NULL` and `currRing!=NULL`. In that case you should recreate a handle:

```
    if currRingHdl != NULL:

                currRingHdl.data.uring = currRing #I don't think this should up refcounts
        else: #currRing == NULL and currRingHdl != NULL
            rKill(currRingHdl) #delete the handle as well. You could also save it for reuse
                               #I think this looks at the refcount
            currRingHdl = NULL

        if currRing != NULL:
            currRingHdl = enterid("my_awesome_sage_ring", 0, RING_CMD, &IDROOT, 0) #note the 0
            currRingHdl.data.uring = currRing
# NOW the following invariant holds:
    assert (currRingHdl == NULL and currRing == NUL) or currRingHdl.data.uring == currRing
```
I think that without extra assumptions you must be prepared to deal with all those conditions. Also note that you might be creating a new ringhandle an arbitrary number of times, so knowing whether you leak becomes important. The sequence I use above is what i think the libsingular examples that are shipped with singular do.

You can already see here that the use of rKill (which does look at reference counts) forces us to follow Singular's conventions of what the `ref` field. At this point we're assuming that if currRingHdl holds the last reference to a ring, we should probably delete it.

I think the convention is that currRingHdl (if it's relevant) is pointing to the same ring as currRing, so they are treated as one reference: `currRingHdl.data.uring = currRing` does not increase a refcount. That obviously leads to problems when `currRing` diverges from `currRingHdl`.

Either you attach memory management ONLY to `currRingHdl` and trust that when `currRing` is changed, someone else will still have a reference to the original value, who can throw away the ring (so, `currRing` is only changed by straight assignments -- no increfs or decrefs. It's always a borrowed reference) or you always ensure that `currRingHdl` gets updated (or at least cleared) when `currRing` changes. My impression is that refcounting in singular is only an interpreter thing, so that the former is the model used by Singular itself.

**Double free implies segfault**: Have you verified this is true with omAlloc?

**Refcounting base**: I agree that as long as our created rings and rings created internally live separate lives, it doesn't matter what semantics we attach to the `ref` field. I just think it's dangerous to implicitly assume these rings do live separate lives. They do now, but who's to guarantee that they do in the future? And even then it may take a long time for a visible error to occur, which by then might be difficult to track down. I think we should adjust to the semantics Singular uses in other places (and document the slightly unusual refcounting semantics of Singular in our code!) to make the libsingular interface as robust as possible. You know how extensions/modifications are going to happen: people will just copy/paste what's already there.

As you indicate, currRingHdl can be NULLed again by rKill. We need to correct that if we need currRingHdl later.

In fact, without extra infrastructure to clean up after it, it seems that `rKill` leaks ringhandles. Is it the case that ring handles are registered in some global data structure that allows them to be deleted? This loop might be the candidate:

```
    while (r->idroot!=NULL)
    {
      killhdl2(r->idroot,&(r->idroot),r);
    }
```
that might do this. In any case, rKill just does a straight `currRingHdl=NULL` if `(r==currRing)`, so `currRingHdl` is definitely gone.

Is it really necessary to use `rKill`? It seems it is more part of the interpreter layer and that the libsingular interface itself is largely one level lower. Have we initialized enough of the interpreter to let `rKill` function as advertised?

It is by now clear that up to now, the Sage-libsingular interface was largely based on empirically verified guesses. Now that Simon has good contact with Hans, perhaps we can ensure the interface follows official protocol?

No, we don't. With the current patch, `rKill` is *only* called if ref==0.

I disagree, since we only call rKill with `r->ref==0`.

In a way, we do. Namely, one could argue that a Sage polynomial ring `MPolynomialRing_libsingular` is an interpreter variable (roughly, it is an object that does not live in the Singular kernel but points to a ring in the Singular kernel). Hence, when creating a polynomial ring, it agrees with Singular's conventions to increase the refcount.

`currRingHdl` is only NULLed if `currRing` is deleted. So, that should be fine.

You mean, it doesn't free it before assigning `NULL`? Yes, that would seem to be a leak.

> Is it really necessary to use `rKill`? It seems it is more part of the interpreter layer and that the libsingular interface itself is largely one level lower.


I'll try `rKill` versus `rDelete` in `singular_ring_delete` and will try to see if there is a leak when creating and deleting super commutative rings (SCA).

The wrong refcount appears to be in sage/libs/singular/function.pyx, where in the current patch we have

```
            # We need to incref the to-be-converted data,
            # since apparently removing to_convert.data would
            # decref it.
            return new_RingWrap( singular_ring_reference(<ring*> to_convert.data) )
```
There was some example where the refcount was wrong *without* calling `singular_ring_reference`, but for SCA it is wrong *with* that call.

So, that is something that we need to understand, and needs work.

Some suggestions:

The singular function `rKill` seems to do what we want in `singular_ring_delete`. Hence, to keep it simple, `singular_ring_delete` should call `rKill`, and nothing more (unless we want a sanity test, such as printing a warning if `singular_ring_delete` is called on NULL).

`rKill` only takes action if `r->ref` is zero when it is called. Indeed, according to Hans, `r->ref` is the number of interpreter variables pointing to a ring, minus one. In order to avoid confusion, we should follow the same idea.

So, what means "interpreter variables" for us? I think this should be "any Sage object whose deallocation needs the libsingular ring being alive". This is every polynomial ring, every Gröbner strategy, and any element of a polynomial ring.

Since ref is -1 based, when a Sage ring R is created then ref shall be zero, so that the underlying libsingular ring can be properly deleted if R is deallocated. And if any element or Gröbner strategy on that ring is created, ref needs to be incremented. The deallocation of an element or Gröbner strategy must involve a call to `singular_ring_delete`.

A complication arises when calling a singular_function. When we call a Singular interpreter function, then we should have ref>0, again according to Hans. Hence, at the begin of a call, ref must be incremented, and decremented when leaving it.

Special care needs to be taken on `currRingHdl`. According to Hans, `rKill` can make it NULL, and it should be NULL if and only if `currRing` is NULL. Currently, we create `currRingHdl` when we *create* a Singular function, but we only use it when we *call* a Singular function. That's asking for trouble. Hence, we should move the creation of currRingHdl to `SingularFunction.__call__`, where we also set the correct `currRing`. `SingularFunction.__init__` is not the right place.

Here is one complication for singular_function: If you do `singular_function("std")`, then a `SingularKernelFunction` is created. In its `__init__`, it creates a call handler, and for that purpose it needs to find out the arity of the Singular kernel function.

But apparently the arity of std can not be correctly determined, if `currRing==0`: One obtains arity 0, not 1, for std.

Therefore, when I move the creation of `currRingHdl` from `SingularFunction.__init__` to where the function is called, an error occurs.

A question arises: Is there a singular function that changes its arity depending on `currRing`? If it is the case, then we must determine `SingularKernelFunction.call_handler` each time the function is called, rather than during initialisation.

I suspect the records do get cleared, because otherwise Singular would leave a dangling pointer around and one would have what is essentially a singular ring variable with NULL pointer to a ring or a pointer to unallocated memory .
If those variables do get properly removed, by the time we have to redefine the thing there should be no trace of the original and hence it would not be a redefinition. If the skeleton somehow does remain (with a nulled out `data.uring` field then, I suppose?), we could keep it around:

```
    saved_skeleton=enterid("my_awesome_sage_ring", 0, RING_CMD, &IDROOT, 0)
    ....
    if currRingHdl == NULL:
        currRingHdl = saved_skeleton
        currRingHdl.data.uring = singular_ring_reference(currRing)
```
Incidentally, doesn't `currRingHdl` count as a ring reference? The code in `SingularFunction` that started this whole thing seems to indicate this. In that case the only `singular_ring_delete(R)` that can trigger nulling of `currRingHdl` and `currRing` is when the explicit intention is
`singular_ring_delete(currRingHdl.data.uring)`. When decreffing any other pointer that just happens to be pointing to the same ring structure, there would still be a refcount left, so no actual deletion would take place.

Note that after `singular_ring_delete(currRingHdl.data.uring)` we should absolutely NULL `currRingHdl.data.uring` (probably safer/better to do `currRingHdl=NULL`) even if deallocation didn't occur, because we should remove the reference. Therefore, I find it surprising that `rKill` does do a `currRingHdl=NULL` conditionally internally. With correct usage, `rKill` should never execute that code usefully, because it needs to happen unconditionally outside of `rKill` if it ever happens. Is it there as a safety net against sloppy programming?

Note that doing `singular_ring_delete(currRing)` is nearly always wrong, because `currRing` is a borrowed reference as far as I understand.

Are we the only ones ever setting `currRingHdl` or can one write/call singular functions that internally will change `currRingHdl`?
If the former holds, the code becomes a little easier to reason about and then we can make our own provisions and ensure they are followed properly (such as saving a skeleton).

In the latter case we really have to play by Singular's rules, because Singular might be doing the deallocating outside of our control.

I am afraid Singular knows that the mock ring has been defined. OK, that's relative to #12313. But it happened when I did

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.plural import SCA
sage: E = SCA(QQ, ['x', 'y', 'z'], [0, 1], order = 'degrevlex')
sage: import gc
sage: del E
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: E = SCA(QQ, ['x', 'y', 'z'], [0, 1], order = 'degrevlex')
```
#12313 is needed to make E collectable.

Hans didn't answer, but I found out myself: `currRingHdl=rFindHdl(currRing,NULL,NULL)`, which could still be NULL. If it is NULL, then we may create the mock ring.

> Are we the only ones ever setting `currRingHdl` or can one write/call singular functions that internally will change `currRingHdl`?


No idea.

<a id='comment:74'></a>
I have attached a new version of the patch. Here are a few comments:

For easier debugging, I created methods returning the refcount for `RingWrap` and for polynomial rings, and for g-algebras.

**__Concerning singular_function__**

`currRingHdl` is now taken care of when the function is called, and not when it is created. In that way, one prevents nastinesses like `currRingHdl` being NULL because of a previous deallocation. When creating it `currRing` is guaranteed to exist. I call `rFindHdl(currRing,NULL,NULL)`, which may find a previously defined thingy. If it can not be found, a mock ring is created by

```
currRingHdl = enterid("my_awesome_sage_ring", 0, RING_CMD, &IDROOT, 0)
```
Since the last argument is 0, we can then do

```
currRingHdl.data.uring = currRing
```
without the need to call `rDelete(currRingHdl.data.uring)`. Problem: See below.

Since `currRing` is now not necessarily available when initialising `SingularKernelFunction`, it is impossible to determine its arity during initialisation, but fortunately it is still possible to determine whether the function exists in the Singular kernel.
Therefore, during `__init__`, I merely test for existence, while the creation of `self.call_handler` is postponed to a point were `currRing` is guaranteed to be around.

Since Hans said that we need to make sure that `currRing->ref` is positive when calling an interpreter function, I temporarily increment the counter during the call.

**__Concerning ref counting__**

I think we should simply rely on Singular's `rKill` for deletion of rings, so that internal data are taken care of.

`currRingHdl.data.uring` and `currRing` do not constitute a reference in the sense of "interpreter variable". Therefor I am not incrementing or decrementing the refcount on them (unless I missed something).

Because of ref counting based at -1, a naked `MPolynomialRing_libsingular` and `NCPolynomialRing_plural` should have `self._ring.ref == 0`, so that `self._ring` can be properly deleted. All other ring-related data, such as a Gröbner strategy or elements of the ring, constitute a new reference.

The same should hold for a `RingWrap`: If one has a naked `RingWrap` then the underlying ring should be deletable when deleting `RingWrap`. A complication arises if both a `RingWrap` and a polynomial ring refer to *the same* underlying libsingular ring.

This occurs in `NCPolynomialRing_plural`, which is created from a ring wrap. I do

```
        cdef RingWrap rw = ncalgebra(self._c, self._d, ring = P)

        #       rw._output()
        self._ring = singular_ring_reference(rw._ring)
```
hence incref, because at the end of the initialisation of self, `rw` will be deleted, so that the refcount for `self._ring` will then be fine. The same holds for `new_CRing` and `new_NRing` in sage.rings.polynomial.plural.

**__Some experiments with the new patch__**

Worst of all: I did not run the tests yet.

Here is a test whether there is a memleak when creating a super-commutative algebra repeatedly. Note that one needs

```
$ hg qa
trac_715_combined.patch
trac_715_local_refcache.patch
trac_715_safer.patch
trac_715_specification.patch

trac_12313_quit_sage.patch
trac13370_deprecate_is_field.patch
trac_13447-sanitise_ring_refcount.patch
```
because otherwise super commutative algebras could not be garbage collected.

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.plural import SCA
sage: import gc
sage: while 1:
....:     E = SCA(QQ, ['x', 'y', 'z'], [0, 1], order = 'degrevlex')
....:     print get_memory_usage(),id(E)
....:     del E
....:     _ = gc.collect()
....:     
223.98828125 4520110400
223.98828125 4520102992
223.98828125 4520145584
223.98828125 4520100800
223.98828125 4520190656
223.98828125 4520116128
223.98828125 4516130448
223.98828125 4520183424
223.98828125 4338291168
223.98828125 4520148816
223.98828125 4520173408
223.98828125 4510376384
223.98828125 4520106672
...
```

Conclusion: There is no leak, even though it really is a new ring each time.

However, not all is good. Namely, we interrupt the computation above, and continue as follows:

```
sage: from sage.libs.singular.function import singular_function
sage: P.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: ringlist = singular_function("ringlist")
sage: l = ringlist(P)
// ** redefining my_awesome_sage_ring **
```

So, here you see the problem with creating the mock ring. I can only hope that Hans will tell us how one can *create* a `currRingHdl` for a given `currRing`, rather than only finding a previously created `currRingHdl`.

Because of that last problem, I think it doesn't make much sense to test. However, comments are welcome.

Unfortunately one gets a segfault in the tests of sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py, apparently related with a singular_function call (namely in the method `variety`).

Too bad. I really thought that the new approach towards refcounting is safe.

If so, you use that one and you let the Singular variable `my_awesome_sage_ring` dangling in the system. If you don't find a Singular variable pointing to `currRing` then you (re)create the variable `my_awesome_ring` to refer to `currRing`. But it could be that that variable is alive and well, happily pointing at some other ring (that once was `currRing`). I think the system probably has good reason to complain.\n\nWhat you should probably do is create `my_awesome_sage_ring`, keep a pointer to it, and refcount rings that you let it point to. Now you're simply holding a singular variable reference to a ring. When you need `currRingHdl` to point somewhere, you can do that via `my_awesome_sage_ring`. If you need to NULL `currRingHdl`, you can do so without consequence. You still keep your own pointer to `my_awesome_sage_ring`.\n\nIt means that the ring pointed to by `my_awesome_sage_ring` is protected against garbage collection, but that's correct: We're holding a reference to it!

I think what your code does, is look up if there is a Singular variable that points to `currRing`. If so, you use that one and you let the Singular variable `my_awesome_sage_ring` dangling in the system. If you don't find a Singular variable pointing to `currRing` then you (re)create the variable `my_awesome_ring` to refer to `currRing`. But it could be that that variable is alive and well, happily pointing at some other ring (that once was `currRing`). I think the system probably has good reason to complain.

What you should probably do is create `my_awesome_sage_ring`, keep a pointer to it, and refcount rings that you let it point to. Now you're simply holding a singular variable reference to a ring. When you need `currRingHdl` to point somewhere, you can do that via `my_awesome_sage_ring`. If you need to NULL `currRingHdl`, you can do so without consequence. You still keep your own pointer to `my_awesome_sage_ring`.

It means that the ring pointed to by `my_awesome_sage_ring` is protected against garbage collection, but that's correct: We're holding a reference to it! Such rings will become eligible for deletion once `my_awesome_sage_ring` is made to point elsewhere. If you don't like rings that were `currRing` to survive until `currRingHdl` is actually needed to point elsewhere, you could NULL the `data.uring` field of `my_awesome_sage_ring` as soon as you get a chance, but I wouldn't bother.

I haven't traced through your precise usage, but grabbing and dropping Singular variables without adapting reference counts sounds fishy to me and liable to lead to segfault.

I'm pretty sure `currRingHdl` is just a Singular Interpreter level entry to `currRing` and probably in the singular interpreter, the current ring is always only a ring that actually has a name in the interpreter, so `currRingHdl` is simply a borrowed reference to that variable. That's why `currRingHdl` manipulations in singular do not involve refcounting (I haven't checked, but it seems to me you claim they don't): The rings themselves are refcounted, but that has already happened when the handle struct that `currRingHdl` is pointing at was instantiated. That struct is surving independent of `currRingHdl` because it represents a variable binding in the singular interpreter and therefore is probably indexed in some tree, linked list or hash table (i.e., the index that `rFindHdl` goes digging in).

Using it does solve the problem with the warning message in[comment:74](#comment%3A74).

In addition, it makes the segfault in `sage -t devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.pyx` disappear - which is a bad news, because instead the test hangs during some call to a singular_function...

I have posted a new patch [attachment:trac_13447-attempted_improvement.patch]. According to Hans, it may happen that Singular functions return NULL, which means that there has been an error. Therefore, I suggest to actually *raise* a `RuntimeError` if the return value is NULL. Apart from that, I postpone another `ggetid` call to a location where `currRing` is guaranteed to exist; however, according to Hans, that call to `ggetid` (namely in the case of a library functions) should be fine also without `currRing`.

Here is the problem:

```
sage -t --verbose devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py
...
Trying:
    R = QQ['a, b']; (a, b,) = R._first_ngens(2); I = R.ideal(a**Integer(2)+b**Integer(2)-Integer(1))###line 3581:_sage_    >>> R.<a,b> = QQ[]; I = R.ideal(a^2+b^2-1)
Expecting nothing
ok
Trying:
    Q = QuotientRing(R,I); K = Frac(Q)###line 3582:_sage_    >>> Q = QuotientRing(R,I); K = Frac(Q)
Expecting nothing
// ** char_series returns 0 x 0 matrix from 2 input polys (0)
I[1,1]=b2+a2-1*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! PROCESS KILLED! *** ***

         [360.3 s]
```

I have absolutely no idea why that happens.

The error occurs in the Singular library function `primdecSY`. I did check that `currRing` is definitely not NULL when calling the function, `currRingHdl.data.uring==currRing`, and there are plenty of references to `currRing`. Moreover, the error does not occur if one copies the whole example (which is from the groebner_basis method) into an interactive session.

`primdecSY` hangs, there is no return value (not even NULL).

Since there is no segfault, I guess gdb would not help here. Since currRing is referenced several times, I guess that it has not been double-freed - but who knows? Can it be that a ring was double-freed, then a new ring was created in the same location, and then an error occurs when working with that new ring?

I found something fishy with the refcount during `sage.libs.singular.function.call_function`.

I changed the code as follows:

```

    # In the Singular interpreter, we must ensure that currRing->ref > 0.
    si_ring.ref += 1  
    cdef int orig_ref = si_ring.ref   # CHANGE: store the reference count
    try:
        with opt_ctx: # we are preserving the global options state here
            if signal_handler:
                sig_on()
                _res = self.call_handler.handle_call(argument_list, si_ring)
                sig_off()
            else:
                _res = self.call_handler.handle_call(argument_list, si_ring)

        if myynest:
            myynest = 0

        if currentVoice:
            currentVoice = NULL

        if errorreported:
            errorreported = 0
            raise RuntimeError("Error in Singular function call '%s':\n %s"%
                (self._name, "\n ".join(error_messages)))
        if si_ring.ref!=orig_ref:  # CHANGE: Test if Singular has changed the refcount
            ff = file("/Users/SimonKing/blubber","a")
            ff.write( "Here is something fishy!\n")
            ff.close()

        res = argument_list.to_python(_res)
        ...
```

When running the failing `sage -t devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py`, the refcount changes exactly once before the test hangs.

It is definitely not supposed to happen that Singular changes the refcount of `currRing`. Changes in the ref counter should only happen in the next line, when the results are converted to python (any polynomial will increase the refcount by one).

I don't know yet what function is causing the trouble - but I hope I'll find out soon...

Oh boy. So, do we have another circular dependency, meaning that this ticket depends on #12313? Perhaps we should apply Python's cyclic garbage collector on my trac tickets :(

Anyway, I am currently unable to do any programming, since I very urgently have a manuscript to write.

Does #12313 depends on this ticket?
I see Jeroen recently put it as a dependency there but with no explanation.
I've now quite read everything here, but it still looks mysterious to me why this was done.

If I am not mistaken, #715 plus #11521 in these versions have a positive review, without #13447.

Now, why did I put #13447 as an explicit reference at #12313? I guess that is because (1) I thought that #13447 is close to being fixed (I was mistaken...) and (2) the patchbot got confused by the circular dependency #715 <-> #11521.

IIRC, it was found that part of the problem was an upstream bug, that got fixed. And we meanwhile have a weak cache for polynomial rings. Hence, the original problem seems to be solved.

However, we may see whether it makes sense to use the existing reference counter from Singular, rather than relying on our custom reference counter. It might be conceptually better, though not necessarily more stable.

What do the other participants of this ticket think?

I think it's a little more than just conceptual. Some rings may be created by direct library calls from sage. Other rings may be generated internally in libsingular. These rings can get mixed up, meaning that a sage created ring might end up being referenced only directly by some internal libsingular data structure and rings created internally to libsingular might end up being referenced by sage.

For reliable, non-leaking memory management you'll have to use the same refcounter in such a situation.

In libecl a different approach is taken: Every lisp object referenced from sage is referenced via a python proxy object that creates a binding to the referenced object in lisp, to prevent garbage collection. The deallocation routine for the proxy includes removal of the lisp binding.
We could do that too, but last time it seemed we were relatively close to deciphering libsingular's conventions for handling its refcount.

I don't think so.

According to Hans Schönemann, the internal refcount is *only* relevant in the Singular user interface. One could argue that libsingular replaces the Singular's user interface and should thus use the same refcounting than the user interface. However, internal calls in Singular will not change the refcount.

> For reliable, non-leaking memory management you'll have to use the same refcounter in such a situation.


See above: The refcounter is not used internally in Singular (only for the user interface), I think.

I haven't looked at the code in a long time, but I know that at the time, I noticed that we DO call into the interpreter, at the very least in the doctests that test something about "functions" in singular.

I also recall that in some of the noncommutative stuff, singular goes off and creates a bunch of polynomial rings, in ways that seemed to me equivalent to what happens in the singular interpreter.

Unsurprisingly, those were the areas where we got problems when we started messing with the code.

So what shall we do?

#12876 has been basically sitting there for one year with a positive review, just waiting for dependencies. There only remains this one. And I now have to rebase it once more because #13184 jumped in the middle the way, reimplementing a little piece of #12876.

Would it be reasonable, or not, to consider that #12876 does not depend on this guy?

From what I read, #13447 was added because the ticket depended on #11521 which was though to depend on #13447.
But in the end it was not the case (#11521 is merged now), so just remove it and get your ticket merged!

I just stumbled into to this in sage/libs/singular/function.pyx:949 in to_python:

```
        elif rtyp == POLY_CMD:
            #FIXME
            res_poly = MPolynomial_libsingular(self._sage_ring)
            res_poly._poly = <poly*>to_convert.data
            to_convert.data = NULL
            #prevent it getting free, when cleaning the leftv
            return res_poly
```
this looks like the simple transfer of ownership of a reference here, but if some of the comments on this ticket quoting Schoenemann are correct and Singular indeed has a mix of refcounted and non-refcounted uses (depending on whether objects are actively interfaced in the interpreter or not) then this step might need attention: the leftv arriving here almost certainly is coming from the interpreter (via SingularFunction) and the res_poly object possibly shouldn't be considered as such.

Any new attempt at resolving this ticket should probably look into this bit of code too.

Should we have a look how much of the issues tracked here are now fixed by #18905?

I still think we should switch to use Singular's c-slot for refcounting. What we currently do: Create a python object from a libsingular `ring*` and put it into a Python dictionary, where the number of references is stored. Wouldn't it be a lot faster to store the number of references in a c-slot?

If we use it, then I still think it makes sense to adopt Singular's convention on that c-slot: It counts the number of references minus one.

I am trying to revive this ticket.

In a branch that I am currently testing, I change the `.ref` field of Singular's `ring` struct whenever Sage's ring refcount is operating, and assert that always both refcounts are consistent.

However, in the following example

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = GF(3)[]
sage: I = R*R.gens()
sage: I.groebner_basis()
```
I find that Sage counts 8 references for some ring, but Singular counts 9 references for the same ring. Perhaps Singular is increasing the refcount internally and isn't resetting it, but I need to investigate it.

I found two spots in which the ref counting currently is not consequently done:
- `SingularFunction.__init__`: In some cases it artificially creates a ring and sets `.ref = 1`, but ignores it in Sage's own refcounting.
- `call_function`: When it changes `currRingHdl` from the previously used to the current ring, it modifies `.ref` but ignores Sage's own refcounting.

So, that's where Singular's and Sage's ring refcounts get out of sync.

If I understand correctly, `my_awesome_sage_ring` is just some ring that is there to make Singular happy, although it is defunct and cannot be deleted. So, in the current code, its ref count in Singular is increased in order to prevent it from being deleted.

The commit that I just posted implements the new approach to refcounting:
- Each singular object that relies on a libsingular ring should have a pointer to that ring (`ring *_ring`), and in addition an int-pointer for the refcount of that ring (`int *_ring_ref)
- If `self` is created using a new ring `r`, then we would have

  ```python
    self._ring_ref = <int*>sig_calloc(1, sizeof(int))
    self._ring = singular_ring_reference(r, self._ring_ref)
  ```
- If `self` is created using a ring that is referenced by `other`, then we would have

  ```python
    self._ring_ref = other._ring_ref
    self._ring = singular_ring_reference(other._ring, self._ring_ref)
  ```
- For deallocation, one does

  ```python
    singular_ring_delete(self._ring, self._ring_ref)
  ```
  Note that it is not needed to do `sig_free(self._ring_ref)`, because this is done inside of `singular_ring_delete(self._ring, self._ring_ref)` when there remain no references to `self._ring`.

In the commit, I am not removing the old refcounting approach. This is for testing purposes: I assert that the old and the new refcount coincide, to demonstrate that the new approach works.

Next step will be to remove the old refcount, and to find a way to replace the doctests for the old refcount.

Question: Would it make sense to add a function that would automatically test that all rings created after "from sage import all" are properly deleted when Sage is shut down?

I inserted print statements whenever certain rings/algebras and elements are created or deallocated, and found that in the following code

```
sage: from sage.libs.singular.groebner_strategy import NCGroebnerStrategy
....: A.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, 3)
....: H.<x,y,z> = A.g_algebra({y*x:x*y-z, z*x:x*z+2*x, z*y:y*z-2*y})

....: strat = NCGroebnerStrategy(I)
....: del strat, I, x,y,z,H, A
....: import gc
....: gc.collect()
```
the G-Algebra `H` is garbage collected and its underlying libsingular ring is properly deleted. However, the free algebra is not garbage collected, and the polynomial ring involved in the creation of the free algebra isn't garbage collected either.

So, there is a memory leak, but I suppose it is because of improper strong references in Sage's coercion system, not because of references to libsingular rings.

<a id='comment:9'></a>
Here is an assessment for the time needed to increment or decrement the reference count in the various approaches. I am using

```python
from cpython.object cimport Py_EQ, Py_NE
from cysignals.memory cimport sig_calloc, sig_free
from collections import defaultdict

refcount_dict = defaultdict(int)

cdef int total_refcount = 0

cdef class Wrap(object):
    cdef void *p
    def `__hash__`(self):
        return <long>(self.p)
    def `__richcmp__`(Wrap self, other, int op):
        if not (op == Py_EQ or op == Py_NE):
            return NotImplemented
        if type(other) is not Wrap:
            return op != Py_EQ
        return (self.p == (<Wrap>other).p) == (op == Py_EQ)

cdef inline wrap(void *p):
    cdef Wrap W = Wrap.__new__(Wrap)
    W.p = p
    return W

cdef inline void *incref1(void *p):
    refcount_dict[wrap(p)] += 1
    return p

cdef inline void decref1(void *p):
    cdef Wrap W = wrap(p)
    cdef int c = refcount_dict[W] - 1
    if c == 0:
        del refcount_dict[W]
    else:
        refcount_dict[W] = c

cdef inline void *incref2(void *p):
    refcount_dict[<long>p] += 1
    return p

cdef inline void decref2(void *p):
    cdef int c = refcount_dict[<long>p] -1
    if c == 0:
        del refcount_dict[<long>p]
    else:
        refcount_dict[<long>p] = c

cdef inline void *incref3(void *p, int *count):
    count[0] += 1
    return p

cdef inline void decref3(void *p, int *count):
    count[0] -= 1

cdef inline void *incref4(void *p, int *count):
    global total_refcount
    total_refcount += 1
    count[0] += 1
    return p
cdef inline void decref4(void *p, int *count):
    global total_refcount
    total_refcount -= 1
    count[0] -= 1

cpdef test1(long x):
    cdef int i
    cdef void *X = <void *>x
    for i in range(1000):
        X = incref1(X)
        decref1(X)

cpdef test2(long x):
    cdef int i
    cdef void *X = <void *>x
    for i in range(1000):
        X = incref1(X)
        decref1(X)

cpdef test3(long x):
    cdef int i
    cdef int *Count = <int*>sig_calloc(1, sizeof(int))
    cdef void *X = <void *>x
    for i in range(1000):
        X = incref3(X, Count)
        decref3(X, Count)
    sig_free(Count)

cpdef test4(long x):
    cdef int i
    cdef int *Count = <int*>sig_calloc(1, sizeof(int))
    cdef void *X = <void *>x
    for i in range(1000):
        X = incref4(X, Count)
        decref4(X, Count)
    sig_free(Count)
```
and with that I get

```
sage: %timeit test1(123456)
1000 loops, best of 3: 362 µs per loop
sage: %timeit test2(123456)
1000 loops, best of 3: 366 µs per loop
sage: %timeit test3(123456)
The slowest run took 111.51 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000000 loops, best of 3: 126 ns per loop
sage: %timeit test4(123456)
The slowest run took 46.28 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000000 loops, best of 3: 129 ns per loop
```

`__Conclusion__`

- test1 is how reference count in sage.libs.singular.ring currently works.
- test2 would be a mild modification of test1, and would apparently not be an improvement.
- test3 is the simplest form of my suggestion.
- test4 is a mild modification of my suggestion, making it possible to preserve the doctests that currently involve `sage.libs.singular.ring.ring_refcount_dict`

I suppose we can afford 3ns loss per 1000 increments and decrements and thus will implement the fourth version of incref/decref. And then we can see if it has an effect on the speed of polynomial arithmetic.

Good news!

1. With plain Sage, one gets

   ```
   sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
   sage: %timeit p = 2*x^3+x*y*z-z^2*x^2
   The slowest run took 83.44 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
   100000 loops, best of 3: 10 µs per loop
   ```
   whereas with the two commits of the current branch one gets

   ```
   sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
   sage: %timeit p = 2*x^3+x*y*z-z^2*x^2
   The slowest run took 73.46 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
   100000 loops, best of 3: 5.37 µs per loop
   ```
2. Doctests with the current branch pass.

So, it would already make sense to use this. OTOH, the purpose of this ticket is not to speed-up polynomial arithmetic but to make multivariate polynomial rings collectable. So, I will next try and remove the strong cache for multivariate polynomial rings, and see what will then happen.

Since I have added ring refcounting not only for the ring itself but also for its elements, it could be that the new code is enough stable to survive deletion of polynomials ring without segfaulting. Keep fingers crossed!

Even better news: With the last commit, multivariate polynomial rings can to some extent be garbage collected:

```
        sage: from sage.libs.singular.ring import total_ring_reference_count
        sage: n = total_ring_reference_count()
        sage: P.<x,y,z> = GF(19)[]
        sage: del P,x,y,z
        sage: import gc
        sage: _ = gc.collect()
        sage: n == total_ring_reference_count()
        True
```
Hence, the purpose of this ticket is fulfilled. I consider it therefore as "needs review".

Caveat: Arithmetic operations are still preventing a garbage collection. But that seems to be a totally different topic.

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = GF(19)[]
sage: p = 2*x^3+x*y*z-z^2*x^2
sage: del P,x,y,z,p
sage: gc.collect()
21
sage: n == total_ring_reference_count()
False
```

Replying to [tscrim](#comment%3A132):
> Perhaps it would be better to make the libsingular and the other multivariate polynomial rings be separate tickets to have more granular changes as they are largely (completely?) independent. This already seems like a bigger ticket and the other change would likely be a bigger changeset as well. 


Actually it isn't that big. The change of refcount does change a couple of .pxd files, but I consider the changes small. And the removal of the strong cache (commit:70c08b0) really is small.

Therefore, splitting the ticket is not needed. But careful testing: In old attempts to fix this ticket, we saw random segfaults in doctests. I don't see them on my machine, but nonetheless it should better be tested with care on various machines. I am curious what the patchbots have to say...

However, because polynomial rings can still not be collected as soon as an algebraic operation is performed on its elements, I suppose there still is a leak coming from strong references in the coercion system. I believe that THIS really should be on a different ticket. Actually it would make sense to test together with the ticket that introduces "optional weak references" (or how was it called?) to store actions. But what was the ticket number?

Anyway, I think the ticket is now ready for review -- changes are relatively small, and tests pass, at least for me...

EDIT: Sorry for not being able to count. I originally thought it was three commits, but there are four.

Looking at the diff, I see that some changes are still in that I meant to revert (they are leftovers from my failed attempt to use `ring->ref` for refcounting).

So, I'll remove these leftovers and see if things still work.

In the new commit, I am removing the TODO block. Recall: The TODO block is visible in the documentation, but refers to stuff written in a TESTS block and thus is invisible in the documentation.

Of course it is still "needs review". Next, I plan to create a wrapper for Singular's `leftv*`, so that it becomes possible to interact with libsingular objects on a very basic (thus, fast) level - of course on a different ticket.

Also it would be nice to understand why polynomial rings can only be collected when no arithmetic operation took place on its elements. But this shall be on yet another ticket.

However, I do have a more broader question: Why are the polynomials holding a reference to the singular ring?

That's what I originally thought. However, it seems that this is why previous attempts to fix this ticket failed, with segmentation faults in doctests, typically **after** the actual tests.

If a reference cycle is deleted during cyclic garbage collection, the objects are deallocated in arbitrary order. Hence, a polynomial could be deleted after its parent, and thus it needs a pointer to a valid libsingular ring.

I have merged the latest beta and get the two test failures below. It also seems that indeed this ticket will help with the problem in #29528, which came up in the upgrade of Singular #25993.

```

The above is equal to `n + 3`.
