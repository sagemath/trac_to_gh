Isn't it a bug in maxima that it warns about Principal Value when it really is just the proper value?

See https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2880/ which was the genesis of #17608.  I feel like they are two separate tickets, however you can feel free to disagree and I won't object very strongly, it's quite amorphous.",

<a id='comment:8'></a>It gets even more exciting:

```
(%i2) integrate(sec(x),x,0,%pi/4);

(%o2) log((sqrt(2)+2)/2)/2-log(-(sqrt(2)-2)/2)/2
(%i3) integrate(sec(x),x,-%pi/4,0);
