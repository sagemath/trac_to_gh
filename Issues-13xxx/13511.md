Perhaps more importantly, sometimes the principal value returned is correct even without considering improper integrals!

```

(%i1) integral(sec(x), x, -%pi/4, %pi/4);
                                              %pi  %pi
(%o1)                   integral(sec(x), x, - ---, ---)
                                               4    4
(%i2) integrate(sec(x), x, -%pi/4, %pi/4);
Principal Value
                         sqrt(2) + 2          sqrt(2) - 2
(%o2)                log(-----------) - log(- -----------)
                              2                    2
```
See #17608.

Isn't it a bug in maxima that it warns about Principal Value when it really is just the proper value?

It gets even more exciting:

```
(%i2) integrate(sec(x),x,0,%pi/4);

(%o2) log((sqrt(2)+2)/2)/2-log(-(sqrt(2)-2)/2)/2
(%i3) integrate(sec(x),x,-%pi/4,0);
Principal Value
(%o3) log((sqrt(2)+2)/2)/2-log(-(sqrt(2)-2)/2)/2
```
