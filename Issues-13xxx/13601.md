Numpy and Scipy has functions to load matrix save in text files (Numpy: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.io.html and Scipy: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/io.html).

Will be nice to have a Sage function to call some of this function as backend and to handle with more file formats.

In attachment trac_13601-matrix_io.patch was suggest the follow formats:
* A single matrix in a text file without header or any other information.
* Coordinate Text File.
* Octave's binary data format.
* Octave's binary data format.
* hdf5 format.
* The Matrix Market (MM) exchange formats.
* The Harwell-Boeing format.
* Matlab format.
* IDL save file.
* Mathematical Programming System (mps).

Load Matlab and IDL format was implemented as a backend of Scipy and MPS was implemented from scratch.

Load others suggest formats wasn't implemented. Neither the functions to write.

**To improve this module to handle with any of the not implemented formats or any new format, please open other ticket.**

Will be nice to implemented the suggest of [vbraun](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/13601#comment:4).

I would rather see matrix(str, ...) try to parse the string, so one could do

```
matrix("""
[1, 2]
[3, 4]
""")
```

And use matrix(open("/path/to/file", ...) for loading from a file.

IMHO, for the string to be parse it must be equal to the nice string representation of:

* a flat list of elements: `'[1, 2, 3, 4]'`;
* a list of lists (i.e., a list of rows): `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`;
* a list of Sage vectors: `'[(1, 2), (3, 4)]'`
* a dictionary having positions as keys and matrix entries as values: `'{(0, 1): 2, (1, 0): 3, (0, 0): 1, (1, 1): 4}'`

Once in all the four cases above the 0-position of the string is `[` or `{` it can be used to disambiguate between the two.

Will be good too that one could do

```
matrix("""
1, 2
3, 4
""")
```

For this special case we can use the new line character to disambiguate.

I think it would be odd if `ZZ(s)` tried to open the file `s` if it didin't represent a valid integer (and/or refused to if it did). Same issue applies to matrices. IMHO, better to raise an error than have very different semantics here.

You could rebase this atop the #13678 (using matrix.load) to sidestep the whole issue.

To parse a string-matrix I think we should just match numbers and strip everything else out, as in

```
sage: number = re.compile('[-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?')
sage: [ match.group() for match in number.finditer('[ 1e3, 0 | 3 6, 1.3 .123)') ]
['1e3', '0', '3', '6', '1.3', '.123']
```
Then put the numbers from each line into the rows of a matrix. This should grok all ascii-art matrix representations.

If the input string is already valid Python, say, then the user can just eval it directly. So we shouldn't worry too much about that case.

+1 to use `matrix.load()` to load the matrix.

+1 to use matrix.load() to load the matrix !

This ticket should really be rebased on top of #13678 !

Minor problems I spotted : there are a lot of english mistakes in the patch, copyright notice should not say 2005 W.stein, but 2012 R.Silva.

Lastly, I find it weird to write a whole lot of boilerplate, especially in the (user-visible) documentation, about things that are not implemented. I think it could confuse users, and I personally think that it would be better if we took the pain of actually doing the work before merging the ticket. Or at least it could be rephrased "TODO : other formats that we could possibly handle in the future include...."

About the MatrixMarket format : as Raniere mentions, SciPy has functions to read/write this format. These functions could probably be used as-is for floating-point matrices, but as far as I understand what they do, they do not support integer matrices. And even if they would, they would be limited to 32/64 bits integers because they rely on NumPy.

Oh, a last detail : the MatrixMarket format comes in a dense and in a sparse version, real, complex, integer or binary, thus it would seem natural that the loader itself sets the sparsity flag and the ring. In the patch they are given to the loader.
