For some reason, it is impossible to directly build the (standard benchmark) cyclic ideals over BooleanPolynomialRing

```
sage: from sage.rings.ideal import Cyclic
sage: R = BooleanPolynomialRing(10, 'x')
sage: I = Cyclic(R)
***BOOOM***
....
TypeError: cannot convert <type 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular'> to BooleanPolynomial
```

Note that there is a possible workaround:

```
sage: R = BooleanPolynomialRing(10, 'x')
sage: R2 = PolynomialRing(GF(2), 10, 'x')
sage: I = ideal([ R(f) for f in Cyclic(R2).gens()])
```

Note that from a mathematical point of view, this is not a very interesting example since this ideal is rather trivial in the boolean polynomial ring... yet something is wrong...

hm, good question. the `TypeError` arises from `BooleanPolynomialRing`'s `_element_constructor_`, but for conversions it should not go there. (As the workaround shows.)
Alos, something like

```
R2.ideal(R2.gens()).change_ring(R)
```
works nicely.

> Rebased myself, needs review...

It matches my original 5.2 patch  up to one empty line and the `:trac:` construct. So I think, I can give positive review for this part.

> Note: in general, it is not a good to add two versions of a patch for two different versions of Sage, *especially* if the latest patch is for the oldest version and *espcially* when there are no clear instructions on which patch to apply.

Sorry, I thought the patchbot data would be utilized.

BTW we have to tell patchbot to 
Apply 13284_boolean_conversion.patch
