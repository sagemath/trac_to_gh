Keywords: groups semidirect product GAP

Adds a semidirect product method.
A generic, top-level method is added to categories/groups.py, which simply raises a `NotImplementedError`. This  is then overridden in permgroup.py. This method wraps GAP's `SemidirectProduct` function. It is implemented so that the calling group is the group acting on an inputted normal subgroup.

Look great! A couple of comments to start:

* Line 92 `sage/categories/groups.py`: I think the exception message would be more clear if we just say something like "semidirect prodcuct of %s and %s is not yet implemented."

* Line 1762 `sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py`: I think it would be clearer here to say that `N` is a group which acted on by `self` and which is isomorphic to a normal subgroup of the semidirect product.
* Line 1803: "where it is generally thought that" --> "where, by convention,"
* Line 1870: The three tests at the beginning of the method are a good measure, but I wonder if they pose too large a computational cost when the input groups are large? Have you tried constructing any large semidirect products with your code? I would be interested to see how much overhead the three checks cost.

One thing you could do is add an optional parameter, something like `check=True` that defaults to True, but if the user sets it to False then the three checks aren't done and the user takes full responsibility if, e.g. the supplied list of elements of `self` does not generate `self`.

I ran some time tests on the checks. I'll leave it up to you to determine if they are to costly (I don't think they are, but then again, I'm no more than a novice when it comes to sage, or even CS in general).

First, I should note that my computer is kind of slow. For calibrating purposes, see that the following process gave 31.9 ms per loop on RAB's computer:


```
sage: G = DihedralGroup(2000)
sage: gens = G.gens()
sage: timeit("G == PermutationGroup(gens = gens)")
5 loops, best of 3: 127 ms per loop
```


Now, for the semidihedral group tests:

I didn't build actually build a semidirect product with this group, but the following does exactly what the first test does on the calling group:


```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(15)
<(1,2,6,7,5),(11,1,12,2,13,3,14,4,15,5),(6,7,8,9,10,11,1)]  #this is the end of an initialization of an 8 element list of random permutations that generates Sym(15)
sage: len(gens)
8
sage: timeit("PermutationGroup(gens) == G")         
25 loops, best of 3: 18.2 ms per loop
sage: G.order()
1307674368000
sage: PermutationGroup(gens) == G
True
```

The second test simply compares the length of lists using basic sage commands, which I think is clearly not very costly (though please do tell me if you disagree).

Finally, I have again not built a full product, but rather an isomorphism that would be inputted into the second list of the ``mapping`` input. Obvioulsy, this list could contain more than one isomorphism, but to account for this we can just multiply this time by some small integer factor.

```

Sorry for the delay, I've been out of town. 

Good catch about the bijection check. I think the `check` optional parameter is a good idea. The only comment I have after reading over your most recent patch is that you should document what the `check` parameter does in the docstring somewhere, preferably under the description of the two required parameters.

Also, the most recent patch applies cleanly to sage-5.3.rc0 but there are a few failing doctests in `sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py`, one of them is just a difference in the text of a thrown exception, but there are others.
