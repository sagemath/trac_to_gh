A very common problem is that people don't understand how to set environment variables on OS X.  This is because GUI applications don't inherit from a shell session and hence don't pick up changes in .bash_profile etc.  It should be possible to have Sage.app (optionally) run a shell command which returns the (relevant?) environment variables from `.profile` and then put those in Sage.app's environment.  Actually, it would probably be enough for the server starting script to source the user's `.profile` to pick up the changes since other uses go through a shell, though this would need to be checked.

Ok.

The original code to produce a macOS app was
no longer maintained and had stopped working.

A new macOS app was rewritten from scratch
in 2021 by Marc Culler, starting with Sage 9.2.

It has its own code repository at:

- https://github.com/3-manifolds/Sage_macOS/releases
