<a id='comment:6'></a>Ok.

The original code to produce a macOS app was
no longer maintained and had stopped working.

A new macOS app was rewritten from scratch
in 2021 by Marc Culler, starting with Sage 9.2.

It has its own code repository at:

- https://github.com/3-manifolds/Sage_macOS/releases
