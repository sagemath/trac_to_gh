The error returned by multiplication of symbolic expressions is hard coded to `ArithmeticError` in the Cython wrappers (`sage/libs/ginac.pxd`). Since the time that was written, Cython got far better at handling errors, so this is not necessary. Removing this directive actually allows us to return more informative error messages. For example:

```
sage: t = GF(5)(3)
sage: u = GF(7)(4)
sage: var('y')
y
sage: e = t*x + u*y
sage: t*e
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Finite Field of size 7' and 'Finite Field of size 5'
```

Your patch replaces the author line on the patch. I don't think this is appropriate. If we were using mercurial properly, we wouldn't run into such problems. But while we have to struggle with patches exported from queues, you should take care to keep the author credit on the patches.

What should I do here? Yours also had a more-informative commit message. To rebase it, I started a new patch on a fresh queue so that I could apply yours with fuzz (hg qimport won't let me do that).

Now when I export it, it has my info/commit message.

Should I just mangle the patch header myself?
