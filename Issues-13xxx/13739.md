The error returned by multiplication of symbolic expressions is hard coded to `ArithmeticError` in the Cython wrappers (`sage/libs/ginac.pxd`). Since the time that was written, Cython got far better at handling errors, so this is not necessary. Removing this directive actually allows us to return more informative error messages. For example:

```
sage: t = GF(5)(3)
sage: u = GF(7)(4)
sage: var('y')
y
sage: e = t*x + u*y
sage: t*e
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Finite Field of size 7' and 'Finite Field of size 5'
```

I had to rebase the last hunk to apply on 5.5.rc0, but it looks like it works.

I also noticed that a similar issue (fixed by this patch) was reported as #10960, so I added the test case from that ticket.

Any extra review needed, then?  Michael, do you consider your patch to more or less be a rebase with an extra test?  (Assuming you rebased it away from dependency on #13609).

If so, looks like positive review; if you'd like to add yourself as an author, then presumably someone else (including Burcin) would have to do the final once-over.

Your patch replaces the author line on the patch. I don't think this is appropriate. If we were using mercurial properly, we wouldn't run into such problems. But while we have to struggle with patches exported from queues, you should take care to keep the author credit on the patches.

What should I do here? Yours also had a more-informative commit message. To rebase it, I started a new patch on a fresh queue so that I could apply yours with fuzz (hg qimport won't let me do that).

Now when I export it, it has my info/commit message.

Should I just mangle the patch header myself?

If the patch won't import properly, that is probably the best quick solution.  Actually, you can use `hg qrefresh -e` to edit the commit message.

Yeah, why not?  If the patch won't import properly, that is probably the best quick solution.  Actually, you can use `hg qrefresh -e` to edit the commit message.  It doesn't look like there is an easy way to change the author, so you can do that by hand, just use the same info as in Burcin's patch.
