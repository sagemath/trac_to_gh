This algorithm follows John Voight's Alg. 2.10 in Identifying the Matrix Ring. This currently works only for quaternion algebras. The goal is to make it more functional once Algebras have more functionality.

Never use

```
try:
    ...
except:
    ...
```
(this catching thinks like `KeyboardInterrupt` and `SystemExit` which you really don't want).
You should always catch a *specific* exception, like:

```
try:
    ...
except AttributeError:
    ...
```
