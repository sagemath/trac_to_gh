It is often useful to consider the group action of a permutation group G acting in the natural way on sets and tuples of the original point set. 

For example we need this thing in the graph theory module for testing edge/arc-transitivity of graphs (#13721). Since there is currently no way to do this directly in sage we use a (ugly) hack and call gap directly as

```
gap("OrbitLength("+str(A._gap_())+"," + str(e) + ",OnTuples);")
```

it would be nice if somehow we could implement the Orbit and Orbits method of permutation groups to handle these actions as well.

I believe the patch to be quite simple but would like to hear what you guys think and suggest before considering to implement it myself.
