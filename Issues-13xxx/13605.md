Adding a `Partitions.global_options()` method which (globally) sets options for partitions as noted in #5439 - http://wiki.sagemath.org/combinat/Weirdness similar to `PermutationOptions()`. This will also affect tableau classes and friends. Additionally this will also clean up some of the documentation/code in the respective files.

---

Here's what is included in the patch:

- Added partition and tableau options
- Converted `Partition_class` to `Partition`
- Converted `Partitions*` (except `PartitionsRestricted`) into the category framework
- Converted `IntegerListsLex` into the category framework with element class of `ClonableArray`
- Renamed *katabolism to *catabolism
- Moved construction functions for partitions `from_*` to `Partitions().from_*`.
- Renamed `dominate()` to `dominated_partitions()` in `Partition`.

Thanks for opening this ticket, and even better working on it :-)

For the syntax, I would prefer something like:

```
   Partitions.options(...)
```
in order to not polute the global namespace. It's relatively consistent with what's done in a couple other places (e.g. CombinatorialFreeModule). Of course, PermutationOptions should be renamed to Permutations.options as well (and by the way the l2r option of PermutationOptions should be deprecated because global options should not change the semantic).

Some places use `set_options`; `options` is more Pythonic; it makes it explicit that the same gadget can be used to set and get the options. 

Cheers,
                            Nicolas

Hi Travis,

I like the concept of various methods being controlled by global options, however, I think that it would be much better if all of the methods provided by the options were also accessible directly as methods to the class. 

In fact, for me this is vital. The reason I introduced the `compact` option to `_repr_` for partitions, tableaux and their tupled variants is that I need this option in order to improve the readability of the output from some external code that I have for working inside the graded Specht modules of arbitrary level (to be made publicly available in ``sage`` some time next year).

Consider the following:

```
sage: S=GradedSpechtModule(3,[4,4,3,2,1]); S
Graded Specht module S(4^2,3,2,1) with e=3 over the Integer Ring
sage: S.an_element()
  2*[1,6,10,13/2,7,11,14/3,8,12/4,9/5] 
+ 2*[1,5,10,13/2,7,11,14/3,8,12/4,9/6] 
+ 3*[1,4,10,13/2,7,11,14/3,8,12/5,9/6]
sage: S.an_element().homogeneous_components()
{0: 2*[1,5,10,13/2,7,11,14/3,8,12/4,9/6], 
 1: 2*[1,6,10,13/2,7,11,14/3,8,12/4,9/5], 
-1: 3*[1,4,10,13/2,7,11,14/3,8,12/5,9/6]}
sage: S.an_element().y(3)                    
-3*[1,3,10,13/2,7,11,14/4,8,12/5,9/6]
```
The elements of this Specht module are indexed, as usual, by standard tableaux which are *compactly* printed here inbetween brackets `[...]`. Without the `compact=True` option which is passed the `_repr_` methods the output here would be almost unreadable. (It's still not that easy in this example, but compare with the output of the default `_repr_` methods!:)

The way your partition options code is currently written many of the individual options are coded "inline" inside the optionable methods. This means that the only way for external code to access the different variants of an optionable method is to artificially tweak `partition_options`, whilst making sure to reset it to its original state after the external code has finished doing whatever it was doing.

It would be more useful, I think, if each optionable variant was directly accessible and accessible in a *systematic* way. This would allow external code, which might have its own options, to easily access the different variants of the method. Perhaps the best way of doing this would be something like the following:

```python
def _repr_(self):
    try:
        repr=getattr(self, '_repr_'+ self.parent().options['display'])
    except AttributeError:
        raise ValueError, "Invalid display option"
    return repr()

def _repr_list(self):
    return '[%s]' % ', '.join('%s'%m for m in self)

def _repr_exp(self):
    exp = self.to_exp()
    return '%s' % ', '.join('%s%s' % (m+1, '' if e==1 else '^%s'%e)
                                     for (m,e) in enumerate(exp) if e > 0)

def _repr_diagram(self):
    return self.ferrers_diagram()

def _repr_compact(self):
    exp=self.to_exp()[::-1]  # reversed list of exponents
    M=max(self)
    return '%s' % ','.join('%s%s' % (M-m, '' if e==1 else '^%s'%e)
                                     for (m,e) in enumerate(exp) if e>0)
```
This model has the advantage of being easy to read and very easy to extend: you simply add another `_repr_X` method and you are done. A better approach might be to write a generic `optionable_method` function and then simply define

```python
def _repr_(self):
    '''
    It's probably essential to give documentation describing 
    possible global options.
    '''
    return optionable_method(self, '_repr_', option_name='display')
```
where `option_name` defaults to name of the method but which we want to override in this case. (Perhaps it is subjective that this is better?) This would allow global options to be used uniformly across all classes. If necessary, passing arguments to the optionable methods would be straightforward too.

As a final note, can there please be an honest *compact* variant of `_repr_` which returns a string with no spaces and is as short as possible but still readable? I want this for use inside code like the above which uses partitions to index objects. Of course, such code could do this itself but it seems more sensible to have this done inside `Partition_class`. I have several different examples/contexts where I want to do this and presumably other people will too?

Cheers,

Andrew

Thanks Travis!

I was thinking that the extra overhead wouldn't be significant, however, I was thinking of methods like `_repr_`. If this is adopted as a general framework then for methods like`_cmp_` the overhead will probably be too high. To get around this it would be better to take the option parsing out of the individual methods and instead do it only once when the options are changed.

I am really thinking of a general options framework for parent/element classes here. In the parents, there would be a generic method which looks something like this:

```python
def options(self, *option, **options):
    # print the current settings for the options in ``option``
    for opt in option:  
        try:
            print getattr(self.element_class,opt).__name__
        except AttributeError:
            raise ValueError, '%s is not a valid option' % opt
    # change the option settings for the options in ``options``  
    for opt in options:
        new_opt=option+'_'+options[opt]
        if hasattr(self.element_class,new_opt):
            self.element_class.__setattr__(opt, new_opt)
        else:
            raise ValueError, '%s is not a valid option for %s' % (options[opt], opt)
```
and, in the element classes, the different options would be coded something like this:

```python
def _repr__list(self):
    return '[%s]' % ', '.join('%s'%m for m in self)

def _repr__exp(self):
    exp = self.to_exp()
    return '%s' % ', '.join('%s%s' % (m+1, '' if e==1 else '^%s'%e)
                                     for (m,e) in enumerate(exp) if e > 0)

def _repr__diagram(self):
    return self.ferrers_diagram()

_repr_= _repr__list  # default option for _repr_
```

Why don't I try and implement this and see how it works for a few different examples? Perhaps it's safer to discuss this first on sage-combinat. What do you think?

I like the concept, however how would you change the option function on those elements which have already been created? I currently don't see a way to make this feasible. This probably would be best discussed on sage-combinat-devel.

Hi Travis,

Could you please tell what the rationale is for having partition_options and tableau_options defined in their own files. In the long term, we need to be careful about "polluting" the file space so I don't think it is a good idea to have these little code snippets in their own files.

Similarly, I'm not convinced that it is a good idea to give the partition options their own page/index entry in the manual (btw, tableau_options doesn't seem to have a manual entry yet). I think that it would be better to have the partition options discussed in a new section at the top of partitions.rst.

Hi Travis,

Here are some more questions/issues. Consider

```
sage: a=Partitions(4)
sage: b=Partitions(4,order='containment')
sage: a
Partitions of the integer 4
sage: b
Partitions of the integer 4
sage: a == b
False
```
This is correct, of course, but it is potentially confusing because a and b look exactly the same when printed, I think that it would be better if the ordering ordering on the class was returned by ``_repr_``, at least when the default ordering is not being used. That is, I am suggesting the following behaviour:

```
sage: a=Partitions(4)
sage: b=Partitions(4,order='containment')
sage: a
Partitions of the integer 4
sage: b
Partitions of the integer 4 with the containment ordering
sage: a == b
False
```

Continuing this example:

```
sage: a[:]       
[[4], [3, 1], [2, 2], [2, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]]
sage: a._list.sort(); a[:]
[[1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 1], [4]]
```
This, to me, just looks wrong: the default ordering should correspond to the order in which the partitions are generated by the iterator. That is, the default really should be 'rev_lex' or the iterator should change.

A second related issue is that in calling Partitions(4)[:], via a[:], we have created the list of *all* partitions of 4 BUT b does not know about this:

```
sage: a._list
[[1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 1], [4]]
sage: b._list
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'Partitions_n_with_category' object has no attribute '_list'
```
In this particular example this is not important because generating the list of partitions of 4 is very quick, but if instead we were looking at the partitions of 50 or 100 then this starts to become an issue.

The reason, of course, is that ``Partitions`` is a subclass of ``UniqueRepresentation`` and ``order`` is an argument to the `__init__` method of the class. I think that it would be preferable to make the "ordered classes" proper subclasses of the ``Partitions`` class with the default ordering. This way they would all be able to share their _list attributes so that the list of all partitions in the class would only ever need to be computed once. This could easily be done inside Partitions.__classcall_private__. 

Another possibility would be to make ``order`` a part of partition_options. In terms of the code this would be almost trivial  as currently ``order`` is used only inside the comparison methods. Mathematically, I think that you can argue both ways: it is useful to be able to use different orderings on the set of partitions so you don't want an individual partition to be restricted to using a fixed order, on the other the the poset of partitions with a particular order is a useful structure. 

I think that Nicolas objected to doing it this way on the basis that it might break code which implicitly assumed a particular order on the partitions. I don't like this argument as it encourages bad coding: if a particular ordering is required by the code then this should be explicit in the code. (Up until now it hasn't been possible to easily change the ordering being used, but now that it is becoming possible the algorithms which require a particular ordering should be updated to make this explicit.)

**I think that moving ``order`` into ``partition_options`` is the best solution.**

On the other hand, if you think it better to have honestly different classes for each ordering then I think that the iterator should be modified to produce the partitions in the correct order. This would be annoying to do properly but could be done by first constructing the list of all partitions and then sorting. This is potentially time consuming, but if some one honestly needs a class for the poset with a particular order then they probably need all of its elements(?).

This smells like a bug since I would think `sort()` would used the ordering on the objects (i.e. the list may not be actual partitions but lists).

#12313 introduces a speed regression related with the fact that currently Partitions are not unique parents. This is dealt with at #13991.

If I understand correctly, you intend to make partitions unique parents. Hence, it would probably solve the speed regression. But how soon do you expect this ticket to be ready for being merged (given that one dependency does not have a positive review yet)?

At #13991, I have attached a patch that turns `Partitions_FOO` for various values of FOO into a `UniqueRepresentation` (actually, I do it for all classes which do not take lists as input data). It is not finalised yet, but since it does fix the speed regression, it could be a short-term solution, if you need more time with the ticket here.

Hey Andrew,

As I recall, Nicolas' main reason was suppose you did something like the following:

```
sage: P = Partitions(4)
sage: Partitions.options(order="dominance")
sage: y = Partition([2,1])
sage: L = [x for x in P if x < y]
```
and you depended on this being dominance ordering. Somewhere along the way, you set the ordering back to "lex", and then needed to recreate `L`. You would (generally) end up with a different list. I do agree with you that (new) code relying on a particular ordering should call that order method directly, but I agree with Nicolas assessment more in that this is somewhat subtle behavior and can lead to subtle bugs.

End of the day, I'm really starting to think that deciding an ordering is more trouble than it's worth. At the very least, given #13991, should we separate this feature out to another ticket?

Last thing for now, are there any other major issues currently with this patch? I really appreciate you reviewing this.

As I said above, I was concerned that patch might increase the time that it takes to compare partitions because the new order option manifests itself as a series of if-then-else statements inside each of the comparison functions `__lt__`, `__le__` etc. I just did some timings on 5.5 to see if there is a significant difference in sorting speeds. 

*The short answer is that sorting appears to be almost 3 times slower with the patch.* 

It could be that my test is not the best, so please feel free to suggest a better one.

With the patch applied:

```
sage: parts=list(Partitions(50));  
sage: %timeit parts.sort()
5 loops, best of 3: 627 ms per loop
```

Without the patch applied:

```
sage: parts=list(Partitions(50));   
sage: %timeit parts.sort()
5 loops, best of 3: 221 ms per loop
```


Rather than having the if-then-else structure inside the comparison functions there would be less overhead using somethng like the syntax used for _repr_:

```python
def __lt__(self, other):
    return getattr(self, '__lt__'+partition_options['order'])(self, other)
```
Of course, this won't work at the moment as order is not an option...

Looking more at the orderings the following behaviour strikes me as being counter intuitive and confusing:

```
sage: mu=Partition([5,4])
sage: Partitions(order='dominance')(mu) in Partitions(9)
True
sage: Partitions(order='dominance')(mu) < Partitions(9)(mu)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.5/devel/sage-combinat/sage/combinat/<ipython console> in <module>()

/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.5/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/partition.pyc in __lt__(self, other)
    632             order = self.parent().order()
    633             if order != other.parent().order():
--> 634                 raise TypeError("orders must be the same")
    635             elif order == "lex":
    636                 return self._list.__lt__(other._list)

TypeError: orders must be the same
```

If the ordering really is "part" of the elements then, above, I think that we should have the following behaviour:

```
sage: Partitions(order='dominance')(mu) in Partitions(9)
False
```
Two other (minor) things that I don't like about the current way the orderings are done are:

* the name "lex" and '"rev_lex" should really be "lexicographic" and "reverse lexicographic", but accept shorthands. Having order[:3] == 'lex' etc would solve this.
* I don't really like have to use *Partitions(order="...")*¬† for some orderings and *reverse(Partitions(order="..."))* for others. I think that each of the ordering should allow a *reverse* modifier: so *Partitions(order='dom')* and *Partitions(order='rev dom')* should both be OK.

Hi Travis,

One aspect of the options code that I don't like at the moment is that some of the options are only accessible if you change or set the corresponding global option. For example, there are five different options for TeX-ing partitions (and friends) but there is no easy way for an external class to access these individual options.

I can see three alternatives here:

1. Don't worry about this and leave everything as it is.
2. Have the option as a optionable argument to the method using something like:

```python
def _latex_(self, latex=None):
    if latex is None: latex=partition_options['latex']
    ...
```
 This has the advantage that it won't be necessary to have a plethora of minor variations for the different options of the method.
1. Implement each option as a separate method as has been done for `_repr_` and then define the optionable method using something like

```python
def _latex_(self):
    return getattr(self,'_latex_'+self.options['latex'])()
```
 This has the advantage that you could check generically to see whether an option was a valid option by checking hasattr(self,'_latex_'+self.options['latex']) when the option is changed.

The reason that I care about this is that I have a class which wants to use particular TeX and display options for partitions -- namely, a class for displaying matrices which which have rows and columns indexed by particular partitions. As it is currently written, the only way that my class will able to access the latex methods it wants is by playing silly games with partition_options. As partitions and tableaux are widely used as indices I would think that there will be other examples eventually.

A second point, as above, I think that none of the "option clients" should ever access partition_options and tableau_options directly. Rather, they should call self.options() or self.parent().options() to do this.

Let me know what you think about these. I can fold your answer into my review patch.

Andrew

Yes, I noticed this but I wasn't completely convinced this was a good idea because tex_from_array is generic and it can be called by anything. If there were uses which had nothing to do with partitions or tableaux this would be a little strange. I think it's is OK as it is currently used only by these two classes, however, I'll add a warning about this to the documentation.

Hi Travis,

Not sure that I will be able to upload to the queue from the airport, but I've found two problems that I can't see an easy fix for. Quite possibly you have already fixed them, but please try:

```
TestSuite( OrderedPartitions(5,3) ).run(
TestSuite( Partitions(5, min_part=2) ).run()
```

Both of them give errors for me.

Apart form this I have finished my review. I'll have to have a look over the changes that you have made and someone will have to review my review as it has gotten quite large -- as I discussed with you and Nicolas, I have replaced your partition and tableau options with a general global_options class and I also fixed up tex_from_array so that it now copes with arbitrary skew composition tuples.

Will upload to trac and the queue as soon as I am able, but this probably won't be until Monday Sydney time due to the connection here -- and I first need to rebase over your changes.

Cheers.,
Andrew

The patch is good except for two TestSuite failures above which come down to the following:

```
sage: [5]  in Partitions(5, min_part=2)       
True
sage: Partition([5])  in Partitions(5, min_part=2)
False
sage: [3,1,1] in OrderedPartitions(5,3)
True
sage: Partition([3,1,1]) in OrderedPartitions(5,3)
False
```

They look like they are both the same issue with IntegerListsLex, but I couldn't see how to fix this. Once these problems are fixed -- and once some one reviews my review patch -- I am happy to give this a positive review.

Given  my review patch is so long I thought that I ought to document what it does:
* defines a generic GlobalOptions class in sage.structure.global_options which replaces the previous dictionaries partition_options and tableau_options and provides more features for them.
* adds the missing option variations for PartitionTuple and TableauTuple together with doc-tests for them
* rewrites tex_from_array in sage.combinat.output so that it now returns valid latex for drawing the diagrams of arbitrary "skew composition" shape. The code is much cleaner, and the latex produced is shorter, with the consequence that many doc-tests across many files had to be updated.
* small reorganisation of the partition like objects in the reference manual as discussed on [sage-combinat](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-combinat-devel/40YJR38-VU0)

I've folded the review patch and should have fixed up everything. Nicolas is willing do the final look-over of the patch. After that, this should be done. Thank you both for your work on getting this reviewed.

The dependency on #13688 is for cardinality tests in partitions.

Hi!

I went through roughly the first half of the patch. Altogether it's good!

I just posted a reviewer's patch on the patch server, mostly to follow the guidelines of the developpers manual. Please have a look at my changes; similar ones probably need to be done in the rest of the patch. Note that I also did a couple changes directly in Travis's version of the patch on the queue.

One thing that would need a small clarification: there is some duplication between the documentation of the "global_options" module and the "GlobalOptions" class. That's not necessarily bad since they can serve different roles (tutorial/reference). But this should be stated explicitly with appropriate cross references.

Thanks!
                             Nicolas

Mostly this seems to be adding missing input statements to the code that I wrote for global options. As Travis wrote the rest of patch, probably everything else is OK:)

I have been through and added some links in GlobalOptions. Part of the duplication is between the module documentation and the documentation for the methods. However, as almost all of the methods have names beginning with an underscore they won't appear in the reference manual. This means that, as far as the reference manual is concerned, there is very little overlap.

I noticed that the indentation in documentation generated by a GlobablOptions class was incorrect. The problem is that because the initial and final parts of the documentation are passed to GlobalOptions as strings the documentation gets confused if strings have uneven white space at the start of different lines. 

I have just pushed a second version of Nicolas' review patch to the combinat queue which addresses this.

Secondly, I noticed that the documentation for sage.structure.global_options contains the links

```
    :meth:`~sage.combinat.partition.Partitions.global_options` and
    :meth:`~sage.combinat.tableau.Tableaux.global_options`.
```
Unfortunately, these do **not** display as links in the manual. Similarly, the auto generated doc-strings for a GlobalOption end with

```
See :class:`~sage.structure.global_options.GlobalOptions` for more features of these options.
```
and this prints as ``GlobalOptions`` in the manual and, again, there is no link to the relevant section of the manual. See Partitions.global_options.

I thought in all of these cases a link should appear, but none of variations of this that i have tried make the link appear. 

Hopefully this is caused by my local configuration...if not, then this is a minor bug...
