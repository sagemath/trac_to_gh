Thanks! Here's a reviewer patch.

For future reference, if you have a long string literal which you want to split into pieces, you can do it by just placing the strings next to each other separated by whitespace:

```python
>>> "a" "b" == "ab"
True
```

This is actually more efficient than writing `"a" + "b"`, because it is parsed directly as `"ab"`, whereas with `"a" + "b"`, Python first creates two string objects `"a"` and `"b"`, and then concatenates them together into a new string object `"ab"`, which essentially causes two useless objects to be created.

I decreased the indentation of some lines in the doctest by two spaces because later, once David Roe's work at #12415 fixes #10458, the `...` can be replaced with `....:` (two characters more) without making the indent excessively wide.

By the way, why

```
edge_list = [] 
for u, v in edges: 
   edge_list.append((int(u),int(v))) 

   g = graph.Graph(edge_list, pos={}) 
```
and not 

```
   g = graph.Graph([(int(u),int(v)) for u,v in edges], pos={})
```
The latter is not only shorter and more readable, but faster, too...

Oh, right.. Well, it's just because this piece of code did other things before... Well it does not matter much and this patch has been changed many times already -- I will fix that discretely later on in a totally unrelated patch `:-)`

Well, actually it is currently

```python
edge_list = [] 
for u, v in edges: 
   edge_list.append((int(u),int(v))) 

g = graph.Graph(edge_list, pos={})
```

If the last line had been indented like Dima said it would be much, much worse :P

An even faster way is probably the following:

```python
g = graph.Graph(((int(u), int(v)) for u,v in edges), pos={})
```

And we shouldn't need `pos={}` in order to use `_circle_embedding()` and `_line_embedding()` either.

Good catch, Dima - not sure why I missed that...
