<a id='comment:2'></a>Attachment [trac_13058.reviewer.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket13058/trac_13058.reviewer.patch) by @kini created at 2012-05-29 23:54:28

Thanks! Here's a reviewer patch.

For future reference, if you have a long string literal which you want to split into pieces, you can do it by just placing the strings next to each other separated by whitespace:

```python
>>> "a" "b" == "ab"
True
```

This is actually more efficient than writing `"a" + "b"`, because it is parsed directly as `"ab"`, whereas with `"a" + "b"`, Python first creates two string objects `"a"` and `"b"`, and then concatenates them together into a new string object `"ab"`, which essentially causes two useless objects to be created.

I decreased the indentation of some lines in the doctest by two spaces because later, once David Roe's work at #12415 fixes #10458, the `...` can be replaced with `....:` (two characters more) without making the indent excessively wide.

If the last line had been indented like Dima said it would be much, much worse :P
