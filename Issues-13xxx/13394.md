The standard Python `WeakValueDictionary` is built on top of a normal dictionary, built on top of a normal dictionary. Let's say we have

```
W = WeakValueDictionary()
```
There is an underlying `D = dict`. If we do

```
W[k] = v
```
then it really executes

```
D[k] = KeyedRef(v, k, remove_callback)
```
This is a weak reference to v, so v can still get collected. If it does, the callback can ensure that

```
del D[k]
```
gets executed. This locates the entry by computing the hash of `h`, finding the right bucket and finding an equal key by comparison. When we create the entry, we have better lookup information, though: We already have `hash(k)` and `id(v)`. These two don't necessarily pin down the entry in the dictionary, but in our applications they do and for a `WeakValueDictionary` identical `v` would be the same (dead) `KeyedRef` anyway, so it wouldn't hurt to remove them all. We need one more method on our dictionary:

```
D.remove_entry_by_hash_and_value_id(h,i):
    """
    remove all entries { k : v } from the dictionary that have
    hash(k) == h   and  id(v) == i
    """ 
```
Then the callback can be

```
function remove(ref):
    D.remove_entry_by_hash_and_value_id(hash(ref.key),id(ref))
```
and the `KeyedRef` that gets stored would be

```
KeyedRef(v,hash(k),remove)
```
(normal precautions to put the dict reference in a closure or a class should apply here in defining `remove`)

Or one could just immediately integrate the `KeyedRefs` in the design. See also #13387 for discussions about dictionary designs.

In either case, the main effect is that removal does not cause any hashing or comparison methods to be called on `k` anymore.

I have attached a proof of concept. I think the class `WVD` defined in the attachment is feature-complete. According to my benchmarks, it is faster than `weakref.WeakValueDictionary`, and it is safer.

__Performance__

```
sage: def test_dict(D,L):
....:     for k,v in L:
....:         D[k] = v
....:     for k,v in L:
....:         if k not in D:
....:             raise RuntimeError("containment")
....:     for k,v in L:
....:         D[k] = v
....:     for k in D.iterkeys():
....:         if k not in D:
....:             raise RuntimeError("second containment")
....:     for k,v in L:
....:         assert D.get(k)==v
....:         del D[k]
....:     for k,v in L:
....:         if k in D:
....:             raise RuntimeError("anti-containment")
....:         
sage: L = [(p,GF(p)) for p in prime_range(2*10^4)]
sage: from weakref import WeakValueDictionary
sage: D = WeakValueDictionary()
sage: %timeit test_dict(D,L)
10 loops, best of 3: 43.2 ms per loop
sage: D = WVD()
sage: %timeit test_dict(D,L)
10 loops, best of 3: 29.4 ms per loop
```
Hence, the WVD is faster than the `weakref.WeakValueDictionary`.

__Safety__

```
sage: class Vals(object): pass
sage: class Keys:                       
....:     def __init__(self, val):
....:         self.val = weakref.ref(val)
....:     def __hash__(self):
....:         return hash(self.val())
....:     def __eq__(self, other):
....:         return self.val() == other.val()
....: 
sage: ValList = [Vals() for _ in range(10)]
sage: D = WeakValueDictionary()
sage: for v in ValList:
....:     D[Keys(v)] = v
....:     
sage: len(D)
10
sage: del ValList
Exception KeyError: (<__main__.Keys instance at 0xdcfc96c>,) in <function remove at 0xdcb9df4> ignored
Exception KeyError: (<__main__.Keys instance at 0xdcfc90c>,) in <function remove at 0xdcb9df4> ignored
Exception KeyError: (<__main__.Keys instance at 0xdcfcc2c>,) in <function remove at 0xdcb9df4> ignored
Exception KeyError: (<__main__.Keys instance at 0xdcfc9ec>,) in <function remove at 0xdcb9df4> ignored
Exception KeyError: (<__main__.Keys instance at 0xdcfca4c>,) in <function remove at 0xdcb9df4> ignored
Exception KeyError: (<__main__.Keys instance at 0xdcfc9cc>,) in <function remove at 0xdcb9df4> ignored
Exception KeyError: (<__main__.Keys instance at 0xdcfc98c>,) in <function remove at 0xdcb9df4> ignored
Exception KeyError: (<__main__.Keys instance at 0xdcfccac>,) in <function remove at 0xdcb9df4> ignored
Exception KeyError: (<__main__.Keys instance at 0xdcfca0c>,) in <function remove at 0xdcb9df4> ignored
sage: len(D)
10
```
Hence, the `weakref.WeakValueDictionary` is unsafe.

```
sage: ValList = [Vals() for _ in range(10)]
sage: D = WVD()
sage: for v in ValList:
....:     D[Keys(v)] = v
....:     
sage: len(D)
10
sage: del ValList
sage: len(D)
1
sage: del v
sage: len(D)
0
```
Hence, the WVD is safe (or at least: safer...)

I suppose I should add tests and documentation to the proof of concept, put into sage.misc and rename `WVD` into `sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary`. And then we should see if we can really smoothly replace `weakref.WeakValueDictionary` in Sage.

If instead you "inline" the tuples by making the bucket a list with the layout `[key1, weakref_to_value1, key2, weakref_to_value2,...]` you can save yourself some overhead. Normally these lists should only contain one key-value pair anyway.

I have posted an initial version, that still lacks documentation and tests (and with the next commit I will also fix some trailing whitespace).

I am afraid that the current version of a weak value dictionary is not faster than what I have described in the proof of concept, although I used the improved bucket layout and am using C-API functions rather thoroughly.

Anyway. I guess part of the documentation will be benchmarks for each separate task. Then we will see what should be further improved.

I did not address this one: I do not switch garbage collection off during iteration. I could, of course. Later perhaps.

> [http://bugs.python.org/issue17816](http://bugs.python.org/issue17816).

This is fixed in my implementation. A slight variation of the example that issue 17816 is proposing, showing that the weakref version of `WeakValueDict` is a mess:

```
sage: import weakref
sage: import sage.misc.weak_dict
sage: class A(object):
....:     def __init__(self,n):
....:         self.n=n
....:     def __repr__(self):
....:         return "A(%d)"%self.n
....:     
sage: def mess(D, n):
....:     L=[A(i) for i in range(n)]
....:     for i in range(n-1):
....:         j=(i+10)%n
....:         D[L[i]]=L[j]
....:     return D
....: 
sage: D = weakref.WeakValueDictionary()
sage: D = mess(D,10000)
sage: len(D)
sage: D.clear()
Exception KeyError: (A(6760),) in <function remove at 0xbe5110c> ignored
Exception KeyError: (A(6761),) in <function remove at 0xbe5110c> ignored
...
Exception KeyError: (A(968),) in <function remove at 0xbe5110c> ignored
Exception KeyError: (A(958),) in <function remove at 0xbe5110c> ignored
sage: len(D)   # in spite of the errors, the items *are* removed
0
```

Instead, `sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary` works just fine:

```
sage: D = sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary()
sage: D = mess(D,10000)
sage: len(D)
9000
sage: D.clear()
sage: len(D)
0
```

Here is an example concerning "garbage collection during iteration". Features of the example:
- Many hash collisions
- Reference cycles, so that Python's cyclic garbage collector comes into play
- The garbage collection is postponed until after the first iteration.

First, with `weakref.WeakValueDictionary`:

```
sage: class Cycle(object):
....:     def __init__(self, n):
....:         self.n = n
....:         self.ref = self
....:     def __cmp__(self, other):
....:         c = cmp(type(self),type(other))
....:         if c:
....:             return c
....:         return cmp(self.n, other.n)
....:     def __repr__(self):
....:         return "Cyc(%s)"%self.n
....:     
sage: class Keys(object):
....:     def __init__(self, n):
....:         self.n = n
....:     def __hash__(self):
....:         return self.n%5
....:     def __cmp__(self, other):
....:         c = cmp(type(self),type(other))
....:         if c:
....:             return c
....:         return cmp(self.n, other.n)
....:     def __repr__(self):
....:         return "Key(%s)"%self.n
....:     
sage: C = [Cycle(n) for n in range(100)]
sage: K = [Keys(n) for n in range(100)]
sage: import gc
sage: import sage.misc.weak_dict
sage: import weakref
sage: D = weakref.WeakValueDictionary()
sage: for k,c in zip(K,C):
....:     D[k] = c
....:     
sage: del c
sage: gc.disable()
sage: del C
sage: for k,c in D.iteritems():
....:     print k,c
....:     gc.enable()
....:     _ = gc.collect()
....:     
Key(0) Cyc(0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration
```

And with `sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary`:

```
sage: D = sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary(zip(K,C))
sage: len(D)
100
sage: gc.disable()
sage: del C
sage: for k,c in D.iteritems():
....:     print k,c
....:     gc.enable()
....:     _ = gc.collect()
....:     
Key(0) Cyc(0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
IndexError: list index out of range
```

So, there is an error, too. Perhaps one could improve the error message.

With the current commits, `weakref.WeakValueDict` is replaced by `sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDict` everywhere in Sage. All doc tests pass. The doctest coverage of the new module is 100%.

Hence, I make it "needs review", and we will see whether we will report upstream.

Next, I'll try to construct finer grained benchmarks, to see if there are aspects in which the implementation in `weakref` is still better.

Even though all tests pass, I wonder about one implementation detail. The callback for `weakref.WeakValueDictionary` looks like this:

```
        def remove(wr, selfref=ref(self)):
            self = selfref()
            if self is not None:
                del self.data[wr.key]
```
Hence, the callback has a weak reference to the dictionary. In my implementation, it is just a method.

Why is a weak self-reference needed? Is this just to prevent problems that could arise when one of the internally used weak references creeps out of the dict?

What shall be done with pop()/popitem() in an iteration context? should it return an item without removing it (resp. postpone removal)? Or should it raise a straight error? I'd prefer the latter.

If "`del D[k]`" is called in an iteration context, I suppose we simply want to postpone deletion until the iteration has finished.

With the latest commit, there is a context manager preventing the dictionary from negative effects of deletions. The doctests show what the context manager is capable of.

It is still "needs review". Perhaps one should test if the whole thing is still faster than `weakref.WeakValueDictionary`. Since `sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary` now seems to be bullet proof regarding garbage collection and explicit deletions, we should use it, unless it is significantly slower than Python's own implementation.

I couldn't resist trying to implement our extra primitive straight onto python's dict. It turns out to be fairly straightforward after reading `lookdict_string` and `PyDict_DelItem` in Python's `Objects/dictobjec.c`. As an example:

```
sage: %attach deldict_exact.pyx
Compiling ./deldict_exact.pyx...
sage: D={}
sage: L=[]
sage: for n in prime_range(2,100):
....:         R=Integers(n)
....:         k=R(1)
....:         L.append(k)
....:         D[R(1)]=n
....: 
sage: len(D)
25
sage: init_dummy()
sage: for l in L[3:10]:
....:         del_dictitem_exact(D,l,hash(l))
....:
sage: len(D)
18
sage: set(L[:3]+ L[10:]) == set(D.keys())
True
```
So the interface is: `del_dictitem_exact(D,key,hash)`, where `hash` is `hash(key)` (but is separately supplied for efficiency). This routine removes the entry `D[key]` if `key` identically occurs as a key in `D`. We could match on value too if we want, but these semantics make most sense for a dictionary.

Problematic/hackish things:
- I have hardcoded PERTURB_SHIFT since that constant isn't available outside `dictobject.c`.
- I had to write a programmatic routine to go looking for the `dummy` sentinel key value (which is used to mark deleted entries)
- I am relying on the internals of `PyDictEntry` and `PyDictObject`. However, I'm getting those from `Python.h`, so we shouldn't get silent failure on those.

With this extra primitive you could write a safer callback on `WeakValueDictionary` without needing the extra indirection. You'd call `init_dummy` upon instantiation of a WeakValueDictionary, to ensure that it's initialized.

**EDIT:** The value of PERTURB_SHIFT is of course critical, but it is a value that was found after extensive tuning. This value is not going to change any time soon. So hardcoding this is not a big issue for maintainability. The extraction of `dummy` is of course clumsy, but fairly robust. Therefore, I think this approach is feasible. It may be worth testing how it works. A lot of the routines on your WeakValueDictionary will be a lot simpler and avoiding the "double hashing" that happens now (access to the dict means computing the hash of what is already the hash of an actual key).

(I've tried your branch, by the way, but it crashes. Reverting your last two commits does give me something that seems to work)

do I understand correctly: What you tried means patching Python, and you want to propose this upstream, but do not necessarily want to include it in Sage yet?

Replying to [@nbruin](#comment%3A25):
> (I've tried your branch, by the way, but it crashes. Reverting your last two commits does give me something that seems to work)

Strange. How does it crash? By commit [changeset:c3dba98] the `WeakValueDictionary` is used in Sage. Are you saying it crashes at startup? What does it say?

<a id='comment:29'></a>
I use the following data for my benchmarks.

```
sage: import sage.misc.weak_dict
sage: import weakref
sage: L = [(p,GF(p)) for p in prime_range(10^5)]
sage: N = prime_range(10^6)
```

Note that this has no hash collisions. Below is an example that
has lots of hash collisions, on purpose.

__Creation of dictionaries__

```
sage: %timeit D = weakref.WeakValueDictionary()
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.39 us per loop
sage: %timeit D = sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.65 us per loop
```
=> Sage is faster

__Initial assignments__

```
sage: %timeit D = weakref.WeakValueDictionary(L)
10 loops, best of 3: 35.7 ms per loop
sage: %timeit D = sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary(L)
10 loops, best of 3: 38.4 ms per loop
```
=> Python is faster.

Since the creation of the empty dictionary is faster in Sage, it seems that
there could be room for improvement.

__Overriding assignments__

```
sage: D = weakref.WeakValueDictionary(L)
sage: %timeit for k,v in L: D[k]=v
10 loops, best of 3: 40.6 ms per loop
sage: D = sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary(L)
sage: %timeit for k,v in L: D[k]=v
10 loops, best of 3: 37.1 ms per loop
```
=> Sage is faster

This may be surprising, as the initial assignment was slower!

__Reading__

```
sage: D = weakref.WeakValueDictionary(L)
sage: %timeit for k,v in L: w=D[k]
100 loops, best of 3: 12.3 ms per loop
sage: %timeit for k in N: w=D.get(k)
1 loops, best of 3: 326 ms per loop
sage: D = sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary(L)
sage: %timeit for k,v in L: w=D[k]
100 loops, best of 3: 5.54 ms per loop
sage: %timeit for k in N: w=D.get(k)
10 loops, best of 3: 31.3 ms per loop
```
=> Sage is *much* faster

__Containment__

```
sage: D = weakref.WeakValueDictionary(L)
sage: %timeit for k in N: k in D
1 loops, best of 3: 347 ms per loop
sage: D = sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary(L)
sage: %timeit for k in N: k in D
100 loops, best of 3: 18.8 ms per loop
```
=> Sage is *very much* faster

__Item deletion__

```
sage: def test():
....:     D = weakref.WeakValueDictionary(L)
....:     for k,v in L: del D[k]
....:     
sage: %timeit test()
10 loops, best of 3: 44.9 ms per loop
sage: def test():
....:     D = sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary(L)
....:     for k,v in L: del D[k]
....:     
sage: %timeit test()
10 loops, best of 3: 47.5 ms per loop
```
=> Python is a bit faster

__Iteration__

```
sage: D = weakref.WeakValueDictionary(L)
sage: %timeit _ = list(D)
1000 loops, best of 3: 312 us per loop
sage: %timeit _ = list(D.itervalues())
100 loops, best of 3: 2.88 ms per loop
sage: %timeit _ = list(D.iteritems())
100 loops, best of 3: 4.9 ms per loop
sage: D = sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary(L)
sage: %timeit _ = list(D)
100 loops, best of 3: 2.67 ms per loop
sage: %timeit _ = list(D.itervalues())
100 loops, best of 3: 2.22 ms per loop
sage: %timeit _ = list(D.iteritems())
100 loops, best of 3: 3.82 ms per loop
```
=> Iteration over the keys is *much* faster in Python, there seems room for
improvement. But the other iterations are slightly better in Sage

__Copying__

Note that deepcopy for Python's weak value dictionaries is not exactly deep,
as only the keys, but not the values, are copied:

```
sage: class C(object): pass
sage: v = C()
sage: w = C()
sage: D = weakref.WeakValueDictionary()
sage: D[1] = v
sage: D[w] = ZZ
sage: E = deepcopy(D)
sage: w in E  # keys are copied, which is good
False
sage: E[1] is D[1] # values aren't copied
True
```
But this is actually correct, since copied values would be immediately garbage
collected! So, my implementation does alike and only copies the keys, not the values.

Timings:

```
sage: D = weakref.WeakValueDictionary(L)
sage: %timeit E = copy(D)
10 loops, best of 3: 45.5 ms per loop
sage: %timeit E = deepcopy(D)
1 loops, best of 3: 453 ms per loop
sage: D = sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary(L)
sage: %timeit E = copy(D)
10 loops, best of 3: 46.1 ms per loop
sage: %timeit E = deepcopy(D)
1 loops, best of 3: 452 ms per loop
```
=> Python and Sage are compatible

__With hash collisions__

Here are the corresponding timings with hash collisions.

```
sage: class Keys(object):      
....:     def __init__(self, n):
....:         self.n = n
....:     def __hash__(self):
....:         return self.n%5
....:     def __cmp__(self, other):
....:         c = cmp(type(self),type(other))
....:         if c:
....:             return c
....:         return cmp(self.n, other.n)
....:     def __repr__(self):
....:         return "Key(%s)"%self.n
sage: L = [(Keys(n),Integers(n)) for n in range(4000)]
sage: N = [Keys(n) for n in range(8000)]
# initial assignments

```

**__Sanity checks__**

Apparently we should expect the most severe problems in the case of hash
collisions. Hence, we use the above class `Keys`. We verify that the results
are as expected. Moreover, we test this during iteration over the keys of the dictionary.

```
sage: class Vals(object): pass
sage: L = [(Keys(n),Vals()) for n in range(4000)]
sage: D = sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary(L)
sage: for k in D.iterkeys():
....:     del L[0]
....:     assert len(L) == len(D)
....:     
sage: len(D)
1310
```
It is of course not surprising that some items remain in the dict, since some
are deleted before they are visited in the loop, others are deleted after they
are visited in the loop. The remaining items coincide with what is left in `L`:

```
sage: set(D.items()) == set(L)
True
```

Trying the same with Python's weak value dictionaries of course fails:

```
sage: L = [(Keys(n),Vals()) for n in range(4000)]
sage: D = weakref.WeakValueDictionary(L)
sage: for k in D.iterkeys():
....:     del L[0]
....:     assert len(L) == len(D)
....:     
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration
```
At least the remaining items are correctly kept track of:

```
sage: set(D.items()) == set(L)
True
```


**__Conclusion__**

The timings show that with few exceptions the new implementation is faster
than the generic implementation in Python's weakref module. This is not much
of a surprise, since weakref is written in pure Python, while my
implementation is in Cython.

According to the above timings, only the iteration over the keys of the
dictionary are considerably faster in the old implementation. This is not much
of a surprise, since in this task the old implementation can fully rely on
iteration over a Python dict, whereas in the new implementation one needs more
work. I will try to make this faster, though.

The new implementation behaves well in the case of hash collisions. This
actually is a surprise for me, and in order to be on the safe side, it would
make sense to add some consistency tests.

Other than that, the new implementation is not slower but much safer than the
old implementation. We should use it---unless the crash you are getting is reproducible.

No, it doesn't mean patching python. The file I attached is straight cython, you can compile it on pretty much any sage, and it will give you the routine `del_dictitem_exact`.

You'd end up with an implementation that stays very close to Python's original `dict`. The only other thing to do is to ensure that values get wrapped and unwrapped upon entering/leaving with the appropriate KeyedRef (and backport the iteration protection if we care)

Some arguments against doing so are:
- We rely on some of the fields of PyDictObject that are declared in `Python.h` but that are not part of the documented C-API of cpython
- We rely on the method python currently uses to "delete" elements from a dict
- We rely on the probing formula that python uses.

Arguments for:
- None of these things have changed in ages and they haven't changed in Python3 either, so from a practical point of view it's unlikely this will trigger incompatibilities
- If this changes, the implementation details of PyDictObject would be different and we'll notice this by changes in `Python.h`. So, even if this changes we won't get silent errors, we'll just get a compilation error, telling us exactly which code to adapt.
- I expect that this is more efficient and easier to write.

we could propose it, but it's not going to be in Python2 (I suspect it'll be considered a new feature, not a bug-fix. Even [http://bugs.python.org/issue7105](http://bugs.python.org/issue7105) which is recognised as a bug hasn't been backported to 2.7.

> Strange. How does it crash? By commit [changeset:c3dba98] the `WeakValueDictionary` is used in Sage. Are you saying it crashes at startup? What does it say?

Hmm. How can this be related with weak value dictionaries? Sure, categories are put in a weak dictionary (because of `CachedRepresentation`), and join categories have an additional weak cache. Perhaps this is why?

The disadvantage of our git workflow is: putting experimental patches on trac wouldn't be a problem. But putting experimental commits on trac *is* a problem, since the experiments may show that the commit should be changed, which means to "rewrite history" (at least for some weird notion of history).

Two notes:

I thought so, too. However, 

```
sage: type(hash(ZZ))
<type 'int'>
```
and that's why I chose `int` in my code.

> - I think you might be going overboard a bit with the iteration protection. Python dictionaries (and lists) are clearly documented as not safe to mutate while iterating over them.

Yes, but there should be an error and not a crash, in this case. Moreover, there should be no error if there is no iteration attempted by the user. And it seems to me that an iteration is detected where the user does not iterate.

> Weak dictionaries are a little different because you never know if there's a callback triggered by a GC, so iterating over a weak dict would never be safe. However, I think the *only* thing to be guarded against is callbacks during iteration (so just defer them and execute them when the guard goes down again). Any other mutation is just for the user to live with.

Yes, but I think the situation here looks different. I really can not see any iteration in the examples that fail for me. Hence, I thought there might something else going on, which motivated my question on the details of the callback function.

With the current commit, the callback function protects its own internal iteration against other callbacks happening at the same time. Now, assume there is the callback of a value `v_0`, and we want to assign some value `D[k]=v` *without* iteration.

Question: Is it possible that some lines of `D.__setitem__(k,v)` are executed, then some lines of the callback for `v_0` are executed, and then further lines of `D.__setitem__(k,v)` are executed, before finally the callback for `v_0` finishes?

If the answer is "yes", then I know the problem:
- `D.__setitem__(k,v)` starts
- the callback for `v_0` starts, enters the iteration context, but does not exit the context yet
- `D.__setitem__(k,v)` continues, and tests whether the dictionary is in an iteration context. Answer is "yes", and so an error is raised.

Can this happen?

Haha! Python's <dict> does in fact **not** prevent this from happening! I think I have just found a bug in Python!

Here is an example that exposes the problem:

```
sage: import sage.misc.weak_dict
sage: D = sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary()
sage: class Key(object):
....:     def __hash__(self):
....:         print "hash of",id(self)
....:         return 5
....:     def __cmp__(self, other):
....:         print "inserting 5"
....:         D[5] = ZZ
....:         return self is other
sage: D[Key()] = QQ
hash of 215823980
sage: D[Key()] = ZZ
hash of 216179948
inserting 5
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: Can not add items while iterating over the dictionary
```

And this is what Python's dict does. There is no error, but it silently fails:

```
sage: D = {}
sage: class Key(object):
....:     def __hash__(self):
....:         print "hash of",id(self)
....:         return 5
....:     def __cmp__(self, other):
....:         print "inserting 5"
....:         D[5] = ZZ
....:         return self is other
sage: D[Key()] = QQ
hash of 215853068
sage: D[Key()] = ZZ
hash of 215853580
inserting 5
sage: len(D)
2
sage: D.keys()
[<__main__.Key at 0xcdda80c>, 5]
sage: id(_[0])
215853068
```
In other words, the second of the explicitly inserted items is missing! That's a bug, I believe.

The same of course also happens with Python's weak value dictionaries (of course, since they use a dict internally). Hence, Sage's `CachedRepresentation` has been running into this bug all the time.

You haven't implemented equality in the way you think:

```
sage: k1=Key()
sage: k2=Key()
sage: k1 is k2, k1==k2
inserting 5
(False, True)
```
so python's dict acts consistently with the results of "==" as it should. (if you implement `__cmp__` then `0` means equal, which is a falsey value. If you implement this with `__eq__` instead, you see that `dict` works properly).

No, that's still not safe (apart from the fact you'd do `i+=2`) . If i=2, you could have a `del bucket[0:2]` happen and if the bucket was long enough, you'll now be skipping a key-value pair. That could be the pair you were supposed to find! You might be able to get by with placing "not in use" sentinels in the bucket slots you're not using anymore, instead of properly deleting them. That's what python does (see below), but then cleaning/reusing that garbage comes natural in python's scheme.

If your dictionary changes, you have to start over. Note that this isn't an issue in `TripleDict` etc., nor is it for exclusively string-keyed dictionaries in python, because then you can guarantee the dict won't change as a result of your equality tests.

To see the kind of care necessary (and taken in `dict`!):

```
D={}
class EvilKey(object):
    def __init__(self,nr):
        self.evil = False
        self.nr = nr
    def __hash__(self):
        return 0
    def __repr__(self):
        return "Evil key nr. %s"%self.nr
    def __eq__(self,other):
        if self.evil:
            del D[0]
        return self is other
        
k1=EvilKey(1)
k2=EvilKey(2)
D[0]='a'
D[k1]='b'
k1.evil=True
D[k2]='c'
k1.evil=False
D[k1]='d'
```
In this script, `D` does not get reshaped, so python does not "start over" at any point. However, a side effect of `D[k2]='c'` is that an earlier slot (previously taken by `0`) becomes available again. This slot is already passed, in the probing for finding a spot for `D[k2]`, so its value does not end up there. This seems dangerous for the `D[k1]='d'` assignment: a free slot would be encountered before `k1` is found to already be a key. `dict` doesn't get fooled, though:
the slot previously occupied for `D[0]` is marked as "freed", not as "never used".

So, python continues probing the entire bucket (for as far as you can talk about buckets in an open-coded hash table) and indeed finds the key `k1` is already in there and uses that entry. If it would have found that the key `k1` didn't occur yet, it would have reused the freed slot it found earlier.

I'd say this is all a pretty good argument to try and stick with python's `dict`. Coding a bullet-proof, high performance hash table is not an easy task.

I have attached a WeakValueDictionary based on your prototype, but directly implemented on `dict`. It's a drop-in replacement, so you can use it right away (and you can probably more easily test its performance). In my preliminary checks it seems (much) faster than `weakref.WeakValueDictionary` in all situations (not surprising since it's cythonized) and I think also always a bit faster than your prototype (it should be with one level of indirection less)

I have not made explicit modifications "safe" for dictionary iteration, although in most cases they should be fairly safe: python's dict only reshapes on *adding* entries, so mixing enumerating entries and removing them shouldn't lead to huge problems (except for non-determinism), but I think doing so is always a bug waiting to happen.

Notes I found when adapting your code:
- if we only use `pending_removals` for callbacks, there's no need to check that list for retrieval etc. You can recognize these entries from the dead weakref.
- in `_IterationContext.__exit__` you must check the guard level every time. Key deletion could have any consequence, including creation of new iterators.
- for now I have left `len` as the length of the dict itself. We could make it `len(self)-len(self.pending_removals)`, but length of a `WeakValueDictionary` doesn't say much anyway.
- there's a `PyObject_Hash` that's a little more efficient than calling hash (you get a `long` immediately).

Interesting detail: when I put this file in place in by `sage-git`, your branch worked! That indicates that the MRO error reported above is indeed triggered by some changed memory management or dict order.

Debugging by seeing if dicts that have an active iterator get mutated might be useful. But note that people can keep iterators around without intention to consume them any more.

Even python's `dict` isn't quite properly guarded against mutating iteration: they only check that the size doesn't change from one yield to the next, but that isn't enough, of course:

```
D=dict( (i,i) for i in range(5))

   print "processing key",k
   M=max(D.keys())+1
   print "adding 10 starting from",M

   L=D.keys()[:10]

Aha. That's safer in my implementation (I think): During iteration, I protect against changing the length of a bucket, not just against changing the length of the whole dict. Anyway, I do believe that it is enough to have a weak value dictionary that is as robust as a plain dict---but we don't need to be better than `<dict>`.

Some remarks/questions about your code:
- I wanted to call `PyWeakref_GetObject` with borrowed references, but it somehow didn't work. Why is it working in your code?
- You still do `cdef PyObject* Py_None = <PyObject*>None`. Couldn't we import `Py_None` from somewhere? Unfortunately I couldn't find it, although `Py_None` is mentioned in the documentation of the C-API.
- In `del_dictitem_by_exact_value`, you ask `#perhaps we should exit silently if no entry is found?`. I agree. Namely, you use this function during callback (that's the only place), and I think we really don't want an error being raised there. Could it be that the callback of a reference can not find the item that contains the reference? I think so, by a weird race condition! Namely:
  - Create an item `D[k] = v`, with weak reference `r` to `v`
  - delete v, but make sure that v does not become garbage collected yet
  - Do `del D[k]`
  Now, I believe the following could happen:
  - `D.__delitem__(k)` proceeds until `(k,r)` is removed from the dictionary, but it does not return yet.
  - Just before `r` is freed inside of `__delitem__`, a garbage collection happens on `v`. Hence, the callback of `r` is executed.
  - The callback finds that `(k,r)` is not in the dict and raises an error
  I don't know if this can really happen. But in any case, I guess silently returning is what we want here.
- Why is `del_dictitem_by_exact_value` cpdef and not cdef? Does `<void *>value` cost a CPU cycle? If this is so, one shouldn't call it in a while loop, and instead have `cdef del_dictitem_by_exact_value(dict D, PyObject *value_addr, long hash)`.
- In `pop()`, you say `#we turn out into a new reference right away because...`. However, wouldn't the following save a CPU cycle in case of an error:

 ```
 cdef PyObject *out_ref = PyWeakref_GetObject(wr)
 if out_ref==Py_None:
     raise KeyError(k)
 out = <object>out_ref
 del self[k]
 return out
  ```
- The last line of `__contains__` should be deleted, as it will never be executed (in my code, I have a while loop, and thus I need to have `return False` after the while loop.
- Thanks for spotting the race condition in `_IterationContext.__exit__`.

I suggest that I'll merge your code into my branch, do the changes suggested above and create a new commit.

Because in the cython pxd header files, they define all those routines with `<object>` type parameters. That tends to work nicer, because it means the routine can "borrow" the reference itself. In the cython file I referenced there is a warning about reference counting and a remark that you can change that to `<PyObject *>` if you know what you're doing, which I pretended here.

As you are away, a type cast from `<PyObject *>` to `<object>` generates code: an incref.

> - You still do `cdef PyObject* Py_None = <PyObject*>None`. Couldn't we import `Py_None` from somewhere? Unfortunately I couldn't find it, although `Py_None` is mentioned in the documentation of the C-API.

It's in `object.h`. line 839 or so:

```
PyAPI_DATA(PyObject) _Py_NoneStruct; /* Don't use this directly */
#define Py_None (&_Py_NoneStruct)
```
We can do "cdef extern PyObject * Py_None" without problem.

> - In `del_dictitem_by_exact_value`, you ask `#perhaps we should exit silently if no entry is found?`. I agree.

We've considered things like this when working on TripleDict and I don't think we ever found a smoking gun. It seems that Python tries to organize things such that callbacks don't have to run. Obviously when I was testing this routine I DID want to see the errors. I'm fine with silent, I would prefer to see a scenario actually play out where it is necessary.

> - `D.__delitem__(k)` proceeds until `(k,r)` is removed from the dictionary, but it does not return yet.

The only shot you have for this is the dereffing of `k`. If the value is freed before the key, this never happens. The deletion code in `delitem_..._exact` is copied from Python's `PyDict_DelItem` and there also first the value is dereffed before the key is. So this scenario doesn't happen.

No, it's a cast from one pointer type to another, so is free. It was `def` before (the routine is in principle safe to call from python too, except that its semantics are a bit wonky), but I don't mind if it's something else.

Yes, I figured the error raising and handling would swamp a "cycle" (whatever that is on a modern CPU) anyway, so I went for the shortest code and making sure that we don't waste an allocation in the most common code path (although a good compile should optimize that out).

> - The last line of `__contains__` should be deleted, as it will never be executed (in my code, I have a while loop, and thus I need to have `return False` after the while loop. 

Ah right! I noted the "unreachable code" warning, but when you `load` something into sage, the reported line numbers are off, so I thought it was complaining about unreachable comments ...

Aw, shoot. We do have a problem:

```
sage: from sage.misc.weak_dict import WeakValueDictionary
sage: D=WeakValueDictionary()
sage: V=set([2])
sage: W=set([3])
sage: D[1]=V
sage: i=D.iteritems(); d=i.next(); del d #raise the guard
sage: del V  #queue a callback
sage: D[1]=W #invalidate the callback (but it's queued!)
sage: len(D)
1
sage: del i #lower guard; callback gets triggered.
Exception KeyError: KeyError('key not found',) in <generator object at 0x65b0140> ignored
sage: len(D)
1
```
so it seems indeed that if there are queued removals, any other destructive mutation (changing the value of an existing key or removing a key) should check if the corresponding value is queued and, if so, remove it.

**Lemma:** We can get away with silently abandoning the callback if we don't find the value. This is OK if we're sure the value we're looking for (the weakref) still exists in its original form and hasn't been reused. And we know that because we're holding an `<object>`, not just an id of an object! So we've kept the weakref alive ourselves and prevented that id from being reused until the callback actually happens or is thrown away.

So: yes, we should remain silent on failure.

OK, I updated my local git repository but can't push it to the ticket here (I can't push it anywhere), so I've attached the changed file. git commit log:

```
commit dbeb58ba955ebfe9b37d4241871e0d8f41b20a1d
Author: Nils Bruin <nbruin@sfu.ca>
Date:   Thu Oct 31 12:16:11 2013 -0700

    documentation and clean-up of del_dictitem_by_exact_value.
    In particular:
     - add a hash check so that behaviour is a little better defined
     - include a stress test to verify that it behaves as documented
     - put a test on WeakValueDictionary to verify that deferred callbacks that
       become invalidated are dealt with appropriately.

I have tested (by inserting print statements into `del_dictitem_by_exact_value`) that the following is a valid test for the callback silently doing the right thing:

```
sage: from sage.misc.weak_dict import WeakValueDictionary
sage: V = [set(range(n)) for n in range(5)]
sage: D = WeakValueDictionary(enumerate(V))
sage: for k in D.iterkeys():
....:     V[k] = None
....:     D[k] = ZZ
```
So, this could be added as a test.

I just see that you have also tried to push something. I'll see what you suggest, will merge, and then I'll push the result.

Yes, indirectly.

I don't think the indirect tests are thorough enough in this case.
The implicit tests that we have presently probably don't exercise the probing function at all (we probably find what we're looking for or NULL on the first try)

I would like to see the test I wrote, or something similar, in the regular test suite (perhaps scaled down a bit or marked `#long` if it's too expensive in its present form). We are relying here on implementation details that python doesn't explicitly guarantee.

I am taking keys and values from the same list so that there's a chance to screw up the dictionary if they inadvertently get confused (i.e., if the layout of `mp.ma_table` changes).

Why waste effort on trying to come up with an indirect test if you can just test it directly? Call the routine `_test_of_del_dict_dont_bother_calling_this_for_other_reasons` if you like.

I think the semantics of the routine are well-defined, though, so we shouldn't go out of our way to hide it.

Do you think this is from a design flaw (race condition) in my test? Or do you think it is a genuine problem of our code?

To my understanding, deletion of a value (and thus execution of the callback) should happen immediately after replacing the value on the list `L`: Cyclic garbage collection is not involved, and hence there should be no delay. However, just to be on the safe side, I explicitly added a garbage collection.

Or did I misunderstand how deallocation of Python objects without reference cycles is working? Can there be a delay?

Arrgh, I am so stupid!! Of course, if `ki==ko` then `vi` lurks around and prevents the item in `D2` from "death-by-garbage-collection"!

This works:

```
sage: from sage.misc.weak_dict import WeakValueDictionary
sage: class C(object):
....:     def __init__(self, n):
....:         self.n = n
....:     def __hash__(self):
....:         return hash(self.n)
....:     def __cmp__(self, other):
....:         return cmp(type(self),type(other)) or cmp(self.n, other.n)
sage: B=10
sage: L = [None]*B
sage: D1 = WeakValueDictionary()
sage: D2 = WeakValueDictionary()
sage: import gc
sage: for i in range(10000):
....:     ki = floor(random()*B)
....:     vi = C(floor(random()*B))
....:     D1[ki] = vi
....:     D2[ki] = vi
....:     L[ki]  = vi
....:     del vi
....:     ko = floor(random()*B)
....:     if ko in D1:
....:         del D1[ko]
....:         L[ko] = None
....:     assert D1 == D2
```

Do you agree that this test is an indirect version of your test, as `del_dictitem_by_exact_value` is triggered by the line `L[ko] = None`?

With B=500 and 50000 runs, the indirect test takes 23 CPU seconds on my laptop. Would this be good for a "normal" test, or would this needed to be called "long"?

I guess your direct test is faster, since you don't need to create instances of `C`.

This version of your test (using a python wrapper for the cdef function) needs 12.5 CPU-seconds on my laptop. I think that's fine for a long test.

```
def test_del_dictitem_by_exact_value(D, value, h):
    """
    This function helps testing some cdef function used to delete dictionary items.

    INPUT:

    - ``D`` -- a Python ``<dict>``.
    - ``value`` -- an object that is value ``D``.
    - ``h`` -- the hash of the key under which to find ``value`` in ``D``.

    See :trac:`13394` for a discussion.

The latest commit adds a small indirect stresstest and a long (nearly) direct stresstest, using a python function that wraps the cdef function (and could in principle be used in python code).

For me, running `sage -t --long  --verbose src/sage/misc/weak_dict.pyx` takes 21 seconds, without errors.

Hence, from my perspective it is good to go.

**Attachment:** [weak_dict.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13394/weak_dict.patch)

I've attached some changes (both as a patch and the file that should be the end result).

Some small type corrections and some major example changes for `_IterationContext`: the examples were testing behaviour that the guard doesn't influence in its current incarnation. I have replaced it with an example that should also illustrate that people should really only use a `WeakValueDictionary` if they really need that, because their behaviour can be very strange (especially when the same objects occur as keys and values)

I'd be OK with giving a positive review to "your part" and since you've given a positive review to "my part" (provided you're OK with the changes I've made) all code has a positive review. I think we've been pretty careful in developing this code.

Would it be possible to "fold" the commits on the branch here? It would be silly to document the little "back and forth" on some bits in the "official" sage history.

Good to go for me! Incidentally, we're running into something I can only explain as an illegal optimization in python's `print` command:

```
sage: from sage.misc.weak_dict import WeakValueDictionary
sage: D=WeakValueDictionary()
sage: D[1]=QQ
sage: print D
{1: <weakref at 0x34128f0; to 'RationalField_with_category' at 0x1ffb4d0>}
sage: repr(D)
'<WeakValueDictionary at 0x6225ae0>'
sage: str(D)
'<WeakValueDictionary at 0x6225ae0>'
```
and it's an odd optimization too. The only explanation I can see is that `print` doesn't think `dict` can be subclassed and thus, based on a type test, decides to use `PyDict` routines on it. I'm afraid that our solution won't necessarily work in all places where a `UserDict` would get recognized as a type that needs method resolution.

Discussion on [cython-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/cython-users/ktsXt_o4M0Q) has some details. We could hack our way around it by doing

```
cdef extern from "Python.h":
    ctypedef struct PyTypeObject:
        void * tp_print

cdef WeakValueDictionary(dict):
    def __init__(self):
        ....

#clear the tp_print field on the type after PyType_Ready has executed on it.
(<PyTypeObject *><void *>WeakValueDictionary).tp_print = NULL 
```
It feels like a horrible hack but it does have the desired effect.

**UPDATE:** Cython is planning to do this for us in their next release.

Hi Nils,

I guess we don't really need to take care of `print D`.

Now, I plan to create a follow-up ticket. Namely, I notice that in different places in Sage we use something like a "weak value dictionary without callbacks", for example `sage.modular.etaproducts._cache`: This is a normal Python dict, but its values are weak references. 

Hence, it would make sense to use a proper `sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary` instead.

Nils, from the discussion at cython-users, it seems that the reason for defining `dict.tp_print` is that for large dicts one would not like to create a giant string and return it, but would like to print it bit by bit.

And this may give rise to a suggestion: Python could allow `__str__` resp. `__repr__` to become iterators returning a list of strings, and then it could print them bit by bit. Such as (for a dictionary):

```
def __repr__(self):
    yield "{"
    i = self.iteritems()
    try:
        k,v = i.next()
        yield "%s: %s"%(k,v)
    except StopIteration:
        pass
    for k, v in i:
        yield ", %s: %s"%(k,v)
    yield "}"
```

If you think that this would be a reasonable feature, you could suggest it to upstream (I guess you know the Python community better than I).

OK. My plan is:
- remove some trailing whitespace that I spotted and push the change (is this needed, or would you automatically remove it when you merge it? In this case, I'd skip that).
- `git diff master > some_file.patch`
- Edit it, so that it matches the old folder layout
- apply `some_file.patch` to a non-git version of Sage, and run tests.
- post the patch here, and Nils double checks whether the patch looks good to him.

I have removed the trailing whitespace from the patch, but not from the branch yet (I can do so when requested).

This patch does apply to sage-5.12.beta5 (that's the latest non-git version on my machine). Note that there was a mismatch in `sage/structure/factory.pyx`, because someone appears to have removed trailing whitespace. It must have happened somehow between sage-5.12.beta5 and the master branch on trac, but `git blame` does not show how the whitespace has vanished.

Anyway. Nils, please verify that the attached patch applies to some non-git Sage, and that the patch does what we do in the branch.

The `WeakValueDictionary` behaves differently from regular dicts for unhashable keys:

```
sage: {}[[]]
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
sage: sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary()[[]]
KeyError: []
```

This is because http://docs.python.org/2/c-api/dict.html#PyDict_GetItem does not throw a `TypeError`. Was this done on purpose, or should I open a ticket for it?
