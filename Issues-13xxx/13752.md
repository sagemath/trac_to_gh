Running Sage with

```
sage -notebook directory='test'
```
leads to an error (in 5.4 and 5.4.1). This worked at least in 5.1. It seems that a directory `test.sagenb` is created, but then an error is produced. 

However, it works with

```
sage -notebook directory='test.sagenb'
```


Depends on #14330

**Assignee:** @jasongrout, @qed777, @williamstein

**Keywords:** notebook directory

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.

This is solved by #14330, I believe; see [this sagenb pull request](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/138).  If someone could just verify that, we would be all set here.

No, if I try `/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.10.rc1/sage -notebook directory='test1'` I get

```
  File "/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.10.rc1/devel/sagenb/sagenb/notebook/interact.py", line 157, in <module>
    from sage.misc.cachefunc import cached_method
exceptions.ImportError: No module named cachefunc
```
and

```
  File "/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.10.rc1/devel/sage-main/sage/misc/prandom.py", line 58, in <module>
    from sage.misc.randstate import current_randstate
ImportError: No module named randstate
```

Looks bizarre...
