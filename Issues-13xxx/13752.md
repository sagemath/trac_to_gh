Running Sage with

```
sage -notebook directory='test'
```
leads to an error (in 5.4 and 5.4.1). This worked at least in 5.1. It seems that a directory `test.sagenb` is created, but then an error is produced. 

However, it works with

```
sage -notebook directory='test.sagenb'
```


Depends on #14330

Upstream: **Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.**
