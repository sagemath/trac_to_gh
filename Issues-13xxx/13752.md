Running Sage with

```
sage -notebook directory='test'
```
leads to an error (in 5.4 and 5.4.1). This worked at least in 5.1. It seems that a directory `test.sagenb` is created, but then an error is produced. 

However, it works with

```
sage -notebook directory='test.sagenb'
```


Depends on #14330

No, if I try `/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.10.rc1/sage -notebook directory='test1'` I get

```
  File "/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.10.rc1/devel/sagenb/sagenb/notebook/interact.py", line 157, in <module>
    from sage.misc.cachefunc import cached_method

and

    from sage.misc.randstate import current_randstate
ImportError: No module named randstate
```

Looks bizarre...
