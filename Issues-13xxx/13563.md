Implementation of spinor KR crystals B^{r,s} of type D_n^{(1)} for r=n-1,n and bug fixes in crystal code

This patch implements:

- the spinor Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals `B^{r,s}` of type `D_n^{(1)}` for `r=n-1,n`. 

- fixes a bug in the module_generator method in CrystalOfTableaux for type `D_n`, when the last entry is negative (i.e. in the odd spinor case). 

- fixes the documentation of Demazure operators in crystals and makes them use CombinatorialFreeModules instead of lists.

Hi Dan,

I fixed the issue that the Demazure operators were not idempotent (one of the inequalities
was wrong). Also, I removed the truncated option from demazure_operator since it was not really used anywhere anymore.
