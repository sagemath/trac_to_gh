<div id="comment:0"></div>

Currently, the docs for the functions in `sage/combinat/symmetric_group_representations.py` are not in the manual, as this file is not mentioned anywhere in the doctree.

As a result, people looking for the corresponding functionality in CA systems miss it in Sage.

Attached patch fixes his, and a lot of typos in `symmetric_group_representations.py`.

Oops, I think when I tested this 1st time, I forgot to do `sage -b` to update the python files
in SAGELOCAL, so the update was ignored by Sphinx. In fact, my change (adding extra ':') had no effect.

But I have absolutely no clue why these bizzare warnings pop up...

There are some errors in the documentation build (although no warnings were given from docbuild). In particular, the examples blocks in `SpechtRepresentations`, `YoungRepresentations_Orthogonal`, `YoungRepresentations_Seminormal`,  and `SymmetricGroupRepresentation_generic_class.to_character()`.

Once these are fixed then I can give it another review.

I think the problem is in docstrings being put in the wrong places; e.g. 

```
class YoungRepresentation_Orthogonal(YoungRepresentation_generic):
    _default_ring = SR

    def __repr__(self):
        r"""
        String representation of self.

        EXAMPLES::
        ....
```
and not like

```
class YoungRepresentation_Orthogonal(YoungRepresentation_generic):
      r"""
      Orthogonal representation of the symmetric group corresponding to...

      EXAMPLES::
      ....
```

EDIT: <s>
But I have no idea how the docstrings should be placed when there is more that one instance of  `class YoungRepresentation_Orthogonal` present. Hell, I don't even have an idea what this means in Python! Different class constructors?</s>
 *Sorry, it's OK. I didn't notice that one is `YoungRepresentation_Orthogonal` and the other `YoungRepresentation`**s**`_Orthogonal`*

Anyhow, the purpose of opening this ticket was to merely put this functionality in some way into Sage docs, for without it it's simply not possible to find! Bad documentation is better than no documentation at all...

How about letting this ticket through, and opening another one, to fix docstrings in `sage/combinat/symmetric_group_representations` ?

by the way, at the Sage prompt the docstrings for, say, `YoungRepresentation_Orthogonal` are as broken as in the `sphinx` output:

Travis, if you are going to fix the documentation it would be good to also specify which bases are used in each of the representations. I used this code a couple of days ago with a colleague and it differs from the conventions in Sagan's book.

It seems you are trying to apply it onto a modified repo.
I did check that it applies to unpatched `sage-5.4.rc0`. And, by the way, I don't even know what `qstatus` is.  Is it one of hg extensions? I suppose your last line indicates that you have something applied on the stack of patches, that conflicts with my patch.
