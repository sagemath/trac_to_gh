Yeah, if it works, then we are set.  It just finished building for me... `sage -b` now... that worked... Trying to start, `sage-location` is being run... it works!!!

Commit and make the spkg, this is ready to go.

> Not sure what you mean by needing to start GAP for Sage. Sage startup doesn't start a GAP session. The GAP workspace cache needs to be rebuilt once, though.

Well, there is a GAP command that is run (and fails here, `gap -r -b -p -T -o 251m .../gap/sage.g`), so that sounds like GAP to me.  Also, upon a first start (or relocation), Sage always says something about stopping a GAP session.  But if it's not technically a session, that's fine; my point was that it does *something*, which e.g. Singular and Maxima don't.

I directly patch configure and leave configure.in as is.
This is dirty but what GAP does is so it's fair.

Of course, it somehow got out of my head.

I'll take this chance to provide a slightly cleaner patch, maybe using -lgmp to let the linker chose, not sure though, because if we really check for the existence of a shared *gmp*.* we can as well pass its full path to the linker.

however, I took the diff above and applied it in the gap spkg directory as follows:

```
patch -p1 <gap-4.5.7.p2.diff
```
the resulting spkg installed just fine on cygwin.

Ive uploaded a new spkg based on #13963.

After a quick look it does not seem that libgap which uses better checks for GMP will need any action from here, but I've not actually tried to build it yet.
As I've finally found where my Cygwin memleak came from, I might test 5.7.beta1 quickly though.
