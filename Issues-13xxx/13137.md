As the summary says. Also, mpir-2.4.0.p5.spkg fails self-tests, moreover it's old.
Upgrading to 2.6.0 fixes both issues.

This requires the fixed LinBox spkg from #13755.

**Apply:**
* [attachment:trac_13137-stopgap.patch] to the SAGE_ROOT repository.

**New spkg:** [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/mpir-2.6.0.p0.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/mpir-2.6.0.p0.spkg)

**md5sum:** `ec21b55dce699d3c8ddf0492e1413107  mpir-2.6.0.p0.spkg`

### mpir-2.6.0.p0 (Jean-Pierre Flori, 12 January 2013)
* Trac #13137: Update to MPIR 2.6.0.
* Modify `spkg-install` to rename `*,asm` files to `*.asm` files.
* Remove `-Wl,-z,noexecstack` fix which has been integrated upstream.
* Remove old code about 32 bits Apple Darwin and use slightly modified upstream fix.

### mpir-2.5.2.p0 (John Palmieri, 3 October 2012)
* Trac #13137: Update to MPIR 2.5.2.
* Remove the patch `patches/yasm__tools__re2c__code.c.patch`.
* Do not use clang, which fails to compile MPIR, on OS X.

### mpir-2.4.0.p7 (Karl-Dieter Crisman, Jean-Pierre Flori, 1 August 2012)
* Trac #12115: let MPIR build on Cygwin.
* Only build the shared version of the library on Cygwin.
* Export `ABI=32` on Cygwin.

There may be other issues, but I haven't encountered them yet.

On hawk (OpenSolaris): linbox fails to build, as mentioned above, and the new spkg from #12883 doesn't help. libm4rie passes its test suite, though.

On sage.math (linux, Sage's gcc): the ppl build fails to configure ("checking which instantiations are enabled... configure: error: invalid instantiation Polyhedron Error configuring the Parma Polyhedra Library."). linbox fails to build, and libm4rie fails its test suite.

On taurus (linux, gcc 4.7.0): same as with sage.math, and also pari fails its test suite.

I'm still building on OS X; I'll report the results when they're available.

I don't know enough to troubleshoot these. If someone else wants to work on this, please go ahead.

MPIR 2.6.0 is out and will be needed for FLINT 2.3.
Should we cope with this upgrade here? Or in a subsequent ticket?

By the way, it would be nice to integrate the easy Cygwin fix of #12115 while upgrading MPIR.

I gave MPIR 2.6.0 a shot, and the problem with linbox remains.
That's really strange, because somehow in gmpxx.h the member function get_sx is defined to invoke the C mpz_get_sx function, conditionally on the fact that stdint.h is included, and the mpz_get_sx is prototyped in mpir.h conditionally on the same fact.
But somehow, the mpz_get_sx is not found.
I'm asking that on mpir-devel as well because I have no clue.

Anyway, these functions are not necessary, so badly removing the definition of the member functions in gmpxx.h let you compile linbox and go on with other bits of Sage, as long as a proper solution is not found.

The discussion about headers inclusion at mpir-devel can be read at:
https://groups.google.com/d/topic/mpir-devel/m__z0PR_wBw/discussion

Anyway, even if MPIR puts in a solution at some point, I think LinBox must be fixed anyway.
So #13755 makes sense and I'll put it as a dependency here.

The discussion about sage.math.washington.edu failure (which is highly likely to be unrelated):
https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/Tmg6nA1eWGk/discussion

I guess what must be done now is to retry some builds on different archs/compilers combinations (to check the clang thing for example) because this spkg is highly sensitive to that, and then we could launch the patchbots (or launch them directly but I don't know how to do that, nor how to get their results), so I put this as need_info now.

We should also decide what to do with the "history" of the spkg.
For now, I've based the spkg on the one from #12115, mentionned in SPKG.txt with an hg commit plus an hg tag done by myself (if #12115 gets merged before that one, I guess we'll do a "proper" rebasing), then added mentionned of 2.5.2.p0 by John in SPKG.txt but without hg commit or hg tag, and finally mention of 2.6.0.p0 in SPKG.txt with an hg commit but no hg tag, assuming it will be automagically by Jeroen scripts.

Waiting for confirmation here:

As I have little doubt about this I'll add a patch to move the files and update the quote_patch patch.

As it seems diff/patch lack the ability of properly detecting filename changes, I propose to manually move the ,asm files to .asm files before patching.
This takes something like ten lines rather than more 1264 with a patch file which just - the *,asm and + the *.asm ones.

With the mv solution, I intend to hardcode the filenames in spkg-install, anyway this should get upstream and this part can (and will have to) then be removed.
I'll report the quoting part as well while I'm at it.

Does this seem ok to everyone?

Ok it seems this is because of `@`GOT.
See http://lists.apple.com/archives/scitech/2006/Dec/msg00004.html which is more informative.

But now MPIR ships with YASM so I guess all of this is not needed anymore?
Could someone who has access to a OS X 10.4 running on 64 bits intel processor test the spkg without the call to remove_32... function?

I'd suggest changing the relevant lines in `configure[.in]` to

```sh

    # 32bit apple darwin doesn't like our PIC format asm code
    case $host in
        i[34567]86-apple-darwin*|
        pentium*-apple-darwin*|
        prescott-apple-darwin*|
        core-apple-darwin*)
            path="x86/applenopic" ;;
        *-apple-darwin*) # assume Core2 or later
            path="x86/applenopic/core2 x86/applenopic" ;;
        *)                                                      ;;

All files in the p2 except `configure` are vanilla 2.6.0 again (especially `config.guess`)?

Another reason for the difference *might* be him setting `ABI=32` manually inbetween (which should matter only in the plain MPIR builds, as `spkg-install` does this as well, always on MacOS < 10.6 I think).

I probably just confused the output of `config.guess` and `-march=...`; in his recent logs we have:

`configure` run "manually", Apple GCC 4.0.1:

```

```

`configure` run "manually", Apple GCC 4.2.1:

```

```

MPIR 2.6.0.p2 (with `sage -i ...`, Apple GCC 4.2.1, build 5577):

```
...
Settings chosen by MPIR when configuring with CFLAGS unset:
  CC:      gcc -std=gnu99
  CFLAGS:  -m32 -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -mtune=core2 -march=core2
...
Finally using the following settings:
  CC=gcc
  CFLAGS=-m32 -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -mtune=core2 -march=core2  -g 
...
checking build system type... nehalem-apple-darwin9.8.0

      CPPFLAGS=""
      CXX="g++"
      CXXFLAGS=""
      MPN_PATH=" x86/applenopic generic"
...
```

(Looks like our first "dry" `configure` run influences the second; we should probably delete some more cache files...)

And FWIW, the `-std=gnu99` still(?) gets dropped in the first place at least, for whatever reason.  (It was a long-lasting MPIR bug that `gmp.h` -- in contrast to `mpir.h` -- was lacking this in the definition of `__GMP_CC`.)

Also, IMHO `CXXFLAGS` shouldn't be empty.  And it doesn't look like yasm's `configure` would pick up the settings from MPIR's...

I reread your message above.

The p0 is the one targeted for inclusion. It should have pristine src directory, except some useless dir for us are deleted.
The patches modify configure for this apple problem, and for some fortran things which were here before.
I also move "by hand" the wrongly name *,asm files.

A priori, the p2 was based on p0, with editing in a sligthly more dirty way configure (i.e. I put somethign at the end of the swith case, that's the only difference as far as configure is concerned) and adding some asm files to the applenopic.
Nonetheless I don't expect that to have any influence on config.guess.

:-) Unfortunately we first need new FLINT and GMP-ECM spkgs as well, AFAIK; not sure what else...

(Or does just the *new* FLINT spkg require MPIR 2.6, but not vice versa?  I only know at least GMP-ECM currently won't build with MPIR 2.6.)

I think there are already some mentions of CC and CXXFLAGS in SPKG.txt, so this does not seem new.

Its the new FLINT which depends on the new MPIR.
The old one should build which whatever version.
In fact the new FLINT release "officially" depends on MPIR 2.6.0.
The real deal is that there are symbols conflicts with MPIR 2.5.x, but as Sage still ships MPIR 2.4.x, there is no problem.

I'll have a look at the GMP-ECM problems, but it indeed reminds me of something, thanks for the hint.

I don't notice any talk there about getting rid of it, though I see the name changes.  That said, there are only three files in `module_list.py` which include `zn_poly` in their library list, and then there is the whole sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hypellfrob/ folder, also by David Harvey, which definitely depends on it.

In `spkg-install`, we have:

```sh

    Darwin)
        # In some cases (see SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin/sage-env), on Darwin,
        # CC might be set to clang, but MPIR doesn't seem to build
        # with clang.
        CLANG=`command -v clang`
        GCC=`command -v gcc`
        if [ -n "$CC" ] && [ "$CC" = "$CLANG" ] && [ -n "$GCC" ] ; then
            export CC="$GCC"
        fi
```

Which means we use `$GCC` even if `CC` is set to `clang` (actually, the output of `command -v clang`) *if GCC is available* (more precisely, if `command -v gcc` is non-empty).

Apart from that these tests are pretty limited [to not say broken] (and `CC` is always set btw.), that doesn't prevent the use of Clang.  So we should either issue an error message if GCC is not available (while `command -v gcc` might actually give a link to `clang` :-) ), or we should fix the build(?) issues with Clang...

I don't think we support clang so that comes as no surprise.
By the way I've reportd some time ago the clang problem upstream but I saw you even proposed fixes, that's great.

I don't really know what the best solution is.
Personally I don't use Apple stuff, so I would be inclined to merge the current spkg with minimal changes and deal with the clang nightmare in a later ticket.

This is not 100% platform independent; I get the same failure on Cygwin on XP, with gcc 4.5.3, with this MPIR spkg.  The Mac one is of course with the Sage-provided gcc.

For the first file, linking to zn_poly should not be needed anymore and should be fixed at #12173.
In fact I'm not really sure anyway it was, there is no direct reference to zn_poly there and it must in fact use it through FLINT 1.5.2 (which ships zn_poly...).

For the second file, the sole function which still really directly use is some "experimental preview"...
The real deal is operated through FLINT (which then use its own zn_poly).
I think this should be removed as well and the preview function deleted (I don't think it used anywhere).
> there is the whole sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hypellfrob/ folder, also by David Harvey, which definitely depends on it.

I assume its functionality is still in the "complete rewrite" of FLINT 2.x?

Indeed the hypellfrob spkg will still depend on zn_poly.
Although I think all functionalities of zn_poly should be given by FLINT 2.3 (and even 1.5.2 which ships zn_poly remember).
This is more problematic as we would need to patch hyperellfrob to use what is exposed by FLINT 1.5.2 or rather 2.3...

Just for info as it is surely unrelated, I have also always had random segfaults while building zn_poly on my 64 bits Windows 7 Cygwin install, with the old or the new MPIR.
It occured while doing some timings for multiplications.
After a few tries it could go through though.

There is also a problem mentioned on the zn_poly page about GCC 4.6.3 and make tune, but I don't think we use that target anyway.

No, I can't, I'm sorry - or to be more accurate, it's just too much time on the Cygwin.

No problem, I should have some WinXP installs at my old workplace and at home on a laptop (with broken screen...).
That's not the best, but I should be able to try to reproduce it.

Could you also specify the CPU used on this WinXP install? So far I assumed it was a 32 bits CPU and the install is 32 bits but I'm not sure about the former fact anymore.

I'm not sure whether `xmlto` was installed when testing the betas and RCs of MPIR 2.6.0, can't find the build logs right now.  Our MPIR 2.4.0 does look for `xmlto` as well, finds it, but apparently doesn't try to build yasm's man pages with it, in contrast to 2.6.0.

Hmmm, the reports on sage-release for 5.6.beta3 also point that there is a problem with zn_poly on top of MPIR 2.4.x [on OS X], and I don't know why but I have strong suspicion it could be in nuss_mul [as well].
> One would probably have to run *the tuning* multiple times under heavy load to reproduce this; haven't at all looked at the code...

The problem is not during the tuning phase but during the quick test one.

The testing code is quite simple, it multiplies two (large) polys using FFT:
* first with the zn_poly code,
* then with the underlying MPIR/GMP code (using KS)
and compare the results.

So a potential culprit was the new MPIR FFT, but as the [same] bug seemed to happen with older version of MPIR and the FFT code was completely changed inbeetween, we can mostly rule out that MPIR is to blame.
It looks like we have to blame zn_poly, which is unfortunate because it is unmaintained.

And remember I mentioned I get segfaults quite often in different places as well on Cygwin when building zn_poly during the tuning phase (and tuning the threshold for FFT IIRC).
So it does not seem completely crazy to blame zn_poly rather than MPIR for the other problem as well.

Of course a good test would be to try to reproduce the error on the problematic systems but on top of GMP.
If the problem persists, I guess we can definitely rule out that MPIR is buggy.

Well, it shows up during the tests, but presumably the tuning generates invalid code (or code triggering a compiler bug) under certain circumstances, like perhaps heavy load.

From what I see after a quick look, the tuning process only chooses thresholds, and does not generates code.
So maybe the code is genuinely buggy for certain random values, or there is a compiler bug (but from what we gathered I wouldn't say we always use the same GCC, bugs appear at least with FSF GCC 4.6.3 on different Os X and with Cywgin GCC 4.5.3 (maybe with later FSF GCC don't remember) on ... Cygwin) that generates code which fails on certain random values.

Or maybe under heavy load, the thresholds get chosen so that code is called on value ranges it is not meant for and boom (but only on Os X and Cygwin, if that was to be true on Linuces I guess we would have seen it before).

I just did

```sh
for ((r=1;r<=100;r=r+1)); do
    tune/tune > src/tuning.c && make && test/test -quick nuss_mul || break
done
```
on bsd.math, with an older version of Sage (but GCC 4.6.3) though, and also zn_poly-0.9.**p5** (not sure whether that matters...).

Since "unfortunately" the sysload happened to be low, I started building Sage in parallel during the 50th run, but that didn't "help" either. 8-)

I'll probably retry with the `.p9`...

Ceterum censeo we should open another ticket for the zn_poly issue.

Updated spkg fixing the offset of configure.patch.

From my point of view the last thing to fix in this ticket is the xmlto one.

I'd prefer to postpone the clang one to another ticket and the zn_poly as well.

- on the other hand, if the system is not loaded when installing the spkg, the test seems to pass consistently (regardless of the load while the test is being run).

I haven't tried this with any new versions of the spkgs.
