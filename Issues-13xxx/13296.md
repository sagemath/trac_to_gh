`utf-8` seems to be the default encoding in Python 2.7 for unicode strings:

```python
Python 2.7.2 (default, May 30 2012, 14:00:43) 
[GCC 4.6.3] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 'é'
'\xc3\xa9'
>>> u'é'
u'\xe9'
>>> unicode('é', encoding='utf-8')
u'\xe9'
```

But, in sage-5.2.rc0, latin1 seems to be the default :

```python
sage: 'é'
'\xc3\xa9'
sage: u'é'
u'\xc3\xa9'
sage: unicode('é', encoding='latin1')
u'\xc3\xa9'
sage: unicode('é', encoding='utf-8')
u'\xe9'
```

As reported by John Palmieri, the problem seems to be from ipython:

```
$ sage --ipython
Python 2.7.2 (default, May 30 2012, 14:00:43) 
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

In [1]: 'é'
Out[1]: '\xc3\xa9'

In [2]: u'é'
Out[2]: u'\xc3\xa9'

In [3]: unicode('é', encoding='utf-8')
Out[3]: u'\xe9'

In [4]: unicode('é', encoding='latin1')
Out[4]: u'\xc3\xa9'
```

This bug was first reported as a problem in matplotlib used from the command line as unicode letter é gets replaced by "Ã©" in matplotlib plot:

```
sage: text(u'an accent : é', (1,1), color='red')
```

With #13161 the same problem appears for axes labels :

```
sage: t = text(u'an accent : é', (1,1), color='red')
sage: t.axes_labels([u'an accent : é', 'Y'])       # broken without #13161
sage: t
```

But, as mentionned in ticket #13161, if the same code is written in a file (even without encoding declared), then unicode gets printed perfectly :

```
# this is file.sage
t = text(u'an accent : é', (1,1), color='red')
t.axes_labels([u'an accent : é', 'Y'])       # broken without #13161
```

Is perfect :

```
sage: attach file.sage
sage: t
```

What makes it work in a file but not for the command line?

But `sage file.sage` doesn't work. Probably the functions in `interpreter.py` don't get called?

Using sage-5.2.rc0, I don't see this note. It diseappeared? or appeared later?
 
> But `sage file.sage` doesn't work. Probably the functions in `interpreter.py` don't get called?


But if the encoding is declared in `file.sage` :

```
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# this is file.sage
t = text(u'an accent : é', (1,1), color='red')
t.axes_labels([u'an accent : é', 'Y'])       # broken without #13161
t.show()
```

then `sage file.sage` works perfectly : the accent "é" gets properly written. So the problem seems to be from the command line...

Of course, it works then. All that the functions in `interpreter.py` do is put the string `-*- coding: utf-8 -*-` in the beginning of the python file they create. After that it "just works." Which is why I said that perhaps the necessary functions in the `interpreter.py` are not called when Sage is run in command line.

Sorry, I misunderstood the "doesn't work". Thanks for the clarifications.

So now, we need to understand how to put the string `-*- coding: utf-8 -*-` somewhere for the commande line?

Great, thanks for the documentation link. I just read all of it. I now see the difference between unicode and utf-8, which I was seeing vaguely as synonyms.

Surprisingly, whereas Sage returns `False`, in Python 2.6 and 2.7, `ss == s` returns `True`:

```python
>>> s = unicode('an accent : é', encoding='utf-8')
>>> ss = u'an accent : é'
>>> s == ss
True
```

That means utf-8 is the default encoding in Python 2.7 for unicode strings. In more details:

```python
Python 2.7.2 (default, May 30 2012, 14:00:43) 
[GCC 4.6.3] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 'é'
'\xc3\xa9'
>>> u'é'
u'\xe9'
>>> unicode('é', encoding='utf-8')
u'\xe9'
```

But, in sage-5.0, latin1 seems to be the default encoding for unicode strings :

```python
sage: 'é'
'\xc3\xa9'
sage: u'é'
u'\xc3\xa9'
sage: unicode('é', encoding='latin1')
u'\xc3\xa9'
sage: unicode('é', encoding='utf-8')
u'\xe9'
```

I did not look at the patch yet.
