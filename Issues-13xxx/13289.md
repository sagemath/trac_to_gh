I'm not fully satisfied of this patch, but I have no better implementation in mind.

For digraphs, this patch considers weakly connected components, but it could also considers strongly connected components. I'm not sure of the most relevant definition.

I added a test on a digraph.

There is major problem with this patch. It modifies the given graph.

While it tries to revert the effect, this is still a bad idea. If an exception occurs between the removal of the vertex and the addition of the edges then the graph will end up modified (just think of CTRL+C or out of memory).

Also the reversal doesn't work for directed graphs currently. Just check the number of edges of D in your test case.

I'd argue that you shouldn't try to fix the reversal, but get rid of it. I don't now much about the problem, so can't suggest a better algorithm that what a quick google search would reveal. If you can't find a better algorithm, make a copy of the graph and modify this copy.

At least for the undirected case you could perform two DFSs and count the visited vertices. The first search would start at v and run on the orginal graph. The second one would ignore all edges incident to v and start at any neighbor of v. If v is not a cut vertex, the number of visited vertices should decrese only by 1.

For the first search you could call connected_component_containing_vertex. For the second run you need to inline the code and add the ability to ignore edges.

IIRC they are both implemented as hash maps, which should make the set faster. I think it has something to do with the fact that the "v in s" has to catch the KeyError and return False instead of just raising the exception. That's exactly what happens with your dict here. It doesn't catch KeyError, but that's fine because it never occurs. Making it faster.

In contrast, if you let it catch the exception aka "seen.get(w, False)", the dict is a lot slower.

Ouppss. This is solved in this new version. I'm using a set of vertices to restrict the DFS to the vertices in the connected or strongly connected component containing u.

I have also restored the `seen = set([start, u])` instead of a dict since only a subset of the vertices are now considered. In fact I don't know if it has a real impact on the performances, but it reduces initialization cost per loop.

I hope everything is in order now ;-)
