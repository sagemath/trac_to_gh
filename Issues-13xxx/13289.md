For digraphs, this patch considers weakly connected components, but it could also considers strongly connected components. I'm not sure of the most relevant definition.

While it tries to revert the effect, this is still a bad idea. If an exception occurs between the removal of the vertex and the addition of the edges then the graph will end up modified (just think of CTRL+C or out of memory).

Also the reversal doesn't work for directed graphs currently. Just check the number of edges of D in your test case.

It could be faster to access a cell of a >dictionary than to test is a elt is in a set.\n\nIIRC they are both implemented as hash maps, which should make the set faster. I think it has something to do with the fact that the \"v in s\" has to catch the KeyError and return False instead of just raising the exception. That's exactly what happens with your dict here. It doesn't catch KeyError, but that's fine because it never occurs.

IIRC they are both implemented as hash maps, which should make the set faster. I think it has something to do with the fact that the "v in s" has to catch the KeyError and return False instead of just raising the exception. That's exactly what happens with your dict here. It doesn't catch KeyError, but that's fine because it never occurs. Making it faster.

In contrast, if you let it catch the exception aka "seen.get(w, False)", the dict is a lot slower.

Good idea.

Once I checked the manual and ptestlong, I'll give it a positive review.

I have also restored the `seen = set([start, u])` instead of a dict since only a subset of the vertices are now considered. In fact I don't know if it has a real impact on the performances, but it reduces initialization cost per loop.

I hope everything is in order now ;-)

Is this really necessary for the undirected case? Aren't all neighbors of v in the same connected component as v?
