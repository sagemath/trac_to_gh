The entries of a tableau are Integers::

```
    sage: T = Tableau([[1]])
    sage: type(T[0][0])
    <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```

This invariant should be preserved by inverse promotion::

```
    sage: type(T.promotion_inverse(2)[0][0])
    <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```

But this is currently not if the input is a plain int::

```
    sage: type(T.promotion_inverse(int(2))[0][0])
    <type 'int'>
```


Depends on #13074

Once done, you can set a positive review on my behalf (where is the patchbot?)

Thanks!
