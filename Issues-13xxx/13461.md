```
After trac_13461-demazure-speedup.patch, if a WeylCharacterRing is created with style="coroots",
characters are computed using not the Freudenthal multiplicity formula, but
rather the Demazure character formula. This can be done using only integer
addition and subtraction. If we run `sage -t --long weyl_characters.py`,
it is more than twice as fast (26 seconds versus 69 seconds) as previously.
If we omit `--long` it is slightly slower, so there is a speedup for
big computations and a slight penalty for small ones.

Demazure characters are added as a method of WeylCharacterRing and the
Demazure operators and Demazure-Lusztig operators are implemented as methods 
of WeightRing elements.

<a id='comment:5'>Comment 5:</a>
I can confirm that this patch gives a major speedup for the long tests in /combinat/root_systems/weyl_characters.py:

28.6 seconds versus 69.9 seconds

Without the long option I get 13.4 seconds versus 12.1 seconds.

Here are a couple of comments on the patch:

- Nicolas taught me that the standard doc strings should have a one-line description, followed by the INPUT and then, if necessary, a longer description. It might be good to follow these standards.

- Do you want to keep the "debug" options in _demazure_helper? If so, please give a short description of what it is for and a doc test with it.

- In demazure_character you refer to analogous methods in WeightRing elements and as methods of crystals. It might be good to link these using :meth:, so this is an easy click in the documentation.

- Would it make sense to briefly explain how the notation in 

```
sage: A2=WeylCharacterRing("A2",style="coroots") 
sage: sage: h=sum(A2.fundamental_weights())
sage: A2.demazure_character(h,word=[1,2]) 
a2(0,0) + a2(-2,1) + a2(2,-1) + a2(1,1) + a2(-1,2)
```
and

```
sage: C = CrystalOfTableaux(['A',2],shape=[2,1])
sage: C.demazure_character([1,2],reduced_word=True)
x1^2*x2 + x1^2*x3 + x1*x2^2 + x1*x2*x3 + x2^2*x3
```
match?

- The description of the patch trac_13461-demazure-lusztig.patch seems to refer to itself "Depends on trac_13461-demazure-lusztig.patch". Perhaps it is best to fold both patches.

- There is a spurious "xo" in line 548 in trac_13461-demazure-lusztig.patch.

- It might be good to use REFERENCES: for the references in demazure_lusztig. It currently does not read well after `sage -docbuild reference html`.

So much for now!

Anne

Regarding the link that Anne suggested to the method of `ClassicalCrystals` I tried:

This doesn't produce an html link. Note that demazure_character is a `ParentMethod` of the

How do I do this?

Hi Dan,

Most likely you need 

<code>:meth:\`~sage.categories.classical_crystals.ClassicalCrystals.demazure_character\`</code>

(with the tilde in front of sage).

I guess:

<code>:meth:\`~sage.categories.classical_crystals.ClassicalCrystals.ParentMethods.demazure_character\`</code>

which in fact should be should be shortenable to:

<code>:meth:\`ClassicalCrystals.ParentMethods.demazure_character\`</code>

Now it could well be that the above links currently break because #9107. In that case, just use this last form and the link will eventually work.

Thanks!

My experience (with GNU Go) is that it is a good idea to leave debug code in for something this complicated. There is also debug code in the Freudenthal method. However this code is not meant
to be used in normal operation. A doctest would look something like this:

```
sage: A2=WeylCharacterRing("A2",style="coroots")
sage: A2.demazure_character((1,1),word=[1,2],debug=True)
cm[1]=(2, -1)
cm[2]=(-1, 2)
i=2
   v=(1, 1), coroot=1
     mu=(1, 1), next[mu]=1
     mu=(2, -1), next[mu]=1
i=1
   v=(2, -1), coroot=2
     mu=(2, -1), next[mu]=1
     mu=(0, 0), next[mu]=1
     mu=(-2, 1), next[mu]=1
   v=(1, 1), coroot=1
     mu=(1, 1), next[mu]=1
     mu=(-1, 2), next[mu]=1
a2(0,0) + a2(-2,1) + a2(2,-1) + a2(1,1) + a2(-1,2)
```
This can be really helpful for figuring out what the code is doing but I'm dubious that a doctest is appropriate. Should I take the code out?

If you think the debug code it useful to have around, you can leave it in. I have just never seen this before integrated into sage.

A quick grep shows a couple of occurences of a similar idiom in e.g. `schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_finite_field.py`. So I guess it's ok as long as it is consistent with what's done there.

Per Anne's recommendations:

The patches are now folded, xo is gone, `:meth:` is used `:meth:`odically
and most methods in `weyl_characters.py` now have docstrings consisting
of a single line followed by INPUT and then further doc. I added a sentence
comparing the Demazure methods of crystals. 

I did not take out the debugging code per discussion in comments 10, 11 and 12.

I did not use REFERENCES but instead reformulated the citations for DL
operators so they look good in the reference manual.

Hi Dan,

The patch looks good and the tests pass on my machine. Here 
are some trivial remarks about the documentation that you
might still want to fix:

- In the demazure_lusztig method replace devisible -> divisible

- In the method symmetric_power something went wrong between h_k and p_k
(at least on the website link you posted).

Other than this, positive review!

Anne
