We should use environment variables `LIBRARY_PATH` and `CPATH` to support the GCC spkg on recent Debian and Ubuntu systems.

**Blocker** because this causes a lot of support requests.

1. [attachment: 13515_debian_gcc.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13515/13515_debian_gcc.patch.gz) to `SAGE_ROOT`.
2. [attachment: 13515_gcc_doc.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13515/13515_gcc_doc.patch.gz) to the Sage library.
