We should use environment variables `LIBRARY_PATH` and `CPATH` to support the GCC spkg on recent Debian and Ubuntu systems.

**Blocker** because this causes a lot of support requests.

Apply:
1. [attachment:13515_debian_gcc.patch] to `SAGE_ROOT`.
2. [attachment:13515_gcc_doc.patch] to the Sage library.
