This ticket implements the Weierstrass form (of the Jacobian) of anticanonical hypersurfaces in toric surfaces defined by reflexive polygons:

```

  sage: cubic = x^3 + y^3 + 1
  sage: WeierstrassForm(cubic)  # cubic in P^2

This is surely a fun ticket! 

But I am not familiar with the number theory part of it, and lately falling behind with everything, including reviewing my son's nappy's :–)
Besides, it ought to be reviewed by number theorists.

Let me in turn invite you to consider taking part in this: http://web.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~dima/IMS2013/

Attempting to look at the maths side. It's confusing that you start off talking about a **toric** elliptic curve, but then speak about "the elliptic curve". What is going on there?

further nitpicks:

```
There are 16 reflexive polygons in 2-d.
```
Could you add a reference and change this to 

```
There are 16 reflexive polygons in the plane.
```

And add an exact reference to the next statement.

```
Each defines a toric fano  variety, which (in 2-d) has a unique crepant resolution to a smooth 
 toric surface.
```
Which should also be changed to 

```
Each of them defines a toric Fano  variety...
```

Then,

```
It turns out that the anticanonical hypersurface equation...
```
Reference?
