As discovered on #13400, there is a bad implementation of `is_subcategory` in `categories/covariant_functorial_construction.py`: It doesn't cache although it should, it doesn't have a proper docstring and it shadows a better implementation on a superclass. It simply needs to be removed.

We have discussed on #13400 that the removal if this is_subcat method makes sense, the change is indirectly doctested by the fact that the existing tests don't break. Hence, the patch seems fine to me.

The patchbot is happy, and I am happy as well.
