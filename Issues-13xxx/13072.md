Instead, I have deprecated the individual options of number_of_partitions() so deprecation warnings are only generated when A() does NOT call B(). In the global namespace, number_of_partitions still points to A().

This patch implements the following classes:

* PartitionTuple          - returns a tuple of partitions
* PartitionTuples         - factory class for all tuples of partitions
* PartitionTuples_level   - class of all tuples of partition of a fixed level
* PartitionTuples_size       - class of all tuples of partition of a fixed size
* PartitionTuples_level_size - class of all tuples of partition of a fixed level and size. The first three of these are infinite enumerated classes whereas the last is finite. They all have iterators.

The idea is to implement a fully function class for PartitionTuples as I currently need this together with a class for tuples of (standard) tableaux (coming soon).

PartitionTuples of level 1 are in natural bijection with Partitions so  when given a 1-tuple of partitions, or a partition, PartitionTuples() returns the corresponding Partition. This works almost seamlessly, making it possible to almost ignore the distinction between Partitions() and PartitionTuples(). One exception is that the expected behaviour of

```
     for component in mu: 
          do X
```

is different for partitions and partition tuples (in the first case, you expect to loop over the parts of the partition and in the second over the components of the tuple). To get around this both classes now have a components() method so that you can uniformly write

```
for nu in mu.components():
      do X
```
Improvements welcome!

In terms of implementation, for my use of these objects the `level` is more intrinsic than the size so I have set the syntax for the PartitionTuples classes as

```
PartitionTuples(level=l, n=n)
```

where `level` and `n` are both optional named arguments BUT level is specified first. Previously, `n` was given first and `level` second. I think that it makes much more sense this way around, but if people feel really strongly about this I will change it back. Previously, `level` was just called `k`, which is a fairly random variable whereas `level` makes sense in terms of categorification and higher level Fock spaces. (Replacing `n` with `size` would also be sensible but I didn't go there.)


**Deprecations of old functions**:
Finally, in addition to these new classes I have removed a bunch functions which were depreciated years ago and depreciated some more functions, as discussed on sage-combinat. I also reinstated the beta_numbers() methods which were removed in the last patch to partition.py (this patch said that beta_numbers and frobenius_coordinates are identical objects, but they are actually different).

For discussion about the functions being deprecated please see the following two discussions on sage-combinat:
* [Implementation of partition tuples](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-combinat-devel/NFNRYjqoouM)
* [number_of_partitions and friends](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-combinat-devel/utAsQzZQKLo) and [number_of_partitions](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-combinat-devel/-8yTNjkCuW0)

Below is a summary of the above listed in order of what I think is decreasing controversy.

1. A=sage.combinat.partition.number_of_partitions() is marked for deprecation in favour of B=sage.combinat.partitions.number_of_partitions(), which is what function A() calls most of the time. As agreed above, number_of_partitions() will stay in the global name space, but this made the deprecation somewhat fiddly as I did not want to deprecate number_of_partitions() for "normal use" because from the user perspective this function will not change. Instead, I have deprecated the individual options of number_of_partitions() so deprecation warnings are only generated when A() does NOT call B(). In the global namespace, number_of_partitions still points to A(). When the functions which are marked for deprecation below are removed, number_of_partitions() should be changed to point to B() and A() should be changed into a deprecated_function_alias to B(). See the patch for more details.

2. For use in Partitions().random_element() the function number_of_partitions() was cached. This cached function was almost never used so, assuming that caching this function is a good idea, I decided to use a cached version of number_of_partitions() inside partition.py always. *As shown in the comments below, this leads to a dramatic speed-up.* 

    This probably should be **revisited** when Fredrik Johansson's patch #13199, which uses FLINT to implement a faster version of number_of_partitions, is merged into sage.

3. The two functions
    * cyclic_permutations_of_partition
    * cyclic_permutations_of_partition_iterator
    are deprecated in sage.combinat.partition and they have been moved to sage.combinat.set_partition and renamed ...._of_set_partition... As far as I can tell these functions are never used but, in any case, they are methods on set partitions rather than partitions. Nonetheless, they need to be deprecated from the global name space.

4. The following functions were marked for deprecation several years ago so they have been removed from sage.combinat.partition.py:
    * partitions_list
    * number_of_partitions_list
    * partitions_restricted
    * number_of_partitions_restricted

5. For the reasons given in #5478, RestrictedPartitions was also slated for removal but it was decided not to deprecate this class until Partitions() is able to process the appropriate combinations of keyword arguments. See #12278 and the comment by John Palmieri below for more details. Nicolas has suggested that one way of addressing this may be to refactor the partitions code so that it uses Florent's enumerated sets factories #10194.

6. The following functions now give deprecation warnings and they are marked for removal from the global name space:
    * partitions_set
    * number_of_partitions_set
    * ordered_partitions
    * number_of_ordered_partitions
    * partitions,
    * ferrers_diagram
    * partitions_greatest
    * partitions_greatest_eq
    * partitions_tuples
    * number_of_partitions_tuples
    * partition_power
    
In all cases, these function are deprecated in favour of (methods in) parent classes.

The following timings show that there is a dramatic speed-up when number_of_partitions is cached:

**With caching**:

```
sage: %timeit [Partitions(n).random_element() for n in range(100)]
25 loops, best of 3: 25 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [Partitions(n).random_element() for n in range(100)]
25 loops, best of 3: 24.6 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [Partitions(n).random_element() for n in range(100)]
25 loops, best of 3: 25.4 ms per loop
```

**Without caching**:

```
sage: %timeit [Partitions(n).random_element() for n in range(100)]
5 loops, best of 3: 1.23 s per loop
sage: %timeit [Partitions(n).random_element() for n in range(100)]
5 loops, best of 3: 1.23 s per loop
sage: %timeit [Partitions(n).random_element() for n in range(100)]
5 loops, best of 3: 1.26 s per loop

Hi Andrew and Travis,

Thanks both for your work. I'm hate to switch back to needs works but looking at the compiled doc, I see various small problems which should be fixed. Here are some of them:

- Don't indent bulleted list. It adds an extra uneeded indentation (see e.g. REFERENCE vs AUTHORS in the module class;

- There is a proper markup for references (see developper guide);

- In the doc of the class `PartitionTuple`, there is a miss indentation between `INPUT` and `EXAMPLES:`

- in the doc of `Garnir_tableau` please write <code>\`\`self\`\`</code> <code>\`\`cell\`\`</code>, <code>\`\`FALSE\`\`</code> ... (verbatim set-up) but don't forget single back-quote for <code>\`(k,a+1,c)\`</code> (latex set-up) and similar. The hyperlink in SEE ALSO are missing

- There is a proper markup for linking to trac ticket eg: <code>:trac:\`13123\`</code>

- There is a typo in "The Garnir tableau are the “first” non-standard tableaux which arise when you at by simple transpositions."

Sorry for being picky for the doc. If it wasn't so late et France, I would have written a review patch. 

For Travis: please check the compiled doc when your are reviewing a patch. You can refer to `http://wiki.sagemath.org/ReviewChecklist`.

Cheers,

Florent

Florent,

Thank you for catching these docstring problems. I appreciate you begin picky about the docs. I didn't know about the indentation of the bullet lists, and I did miss that indentation of EXAMPLES:: block in the compiled doc.

Andrew,

A few more minor issues.
- I believe this line (line 263 in `partition_tuple.py`) has a comma misplaced:

```
When these algebras are not semisimple partition, tuples index...
```
- In `partition_tuple.hook_length()` it should be <code>coordinates of the form \`(k,r,c)\`</code>
- In `partition.random_element()`, the inputs `uniform` and `Plancherel` should be indented one more since they are the types of inputs for `measure`.

Hi Travis,

I have uploaded a new version of the patch which fixes the errant comma and the indentation in random_element but I think that the <code>\`\`(k,r,c)\`\`</code> in the hook_length function is correct because k,r and c are arguments to this function. Of course, it would be more correct to write <code>(\`\`k\`\`,\`\`r\`\`,\`\`c\`\`)</code> but ReST complains about this.

Hi Jeroen,

Perhaps I am confused, but most of these pickles shouldn't exist any more as they should have been removed by the new pickle jar attached to #9265. Specifically, the pickles

  _class!__   sage_combinat_skew_tableau_SemistandardSkewTableaux_n!__   .sobj')
   _class!__   sage_combinat_skew_tableau_SemistandardSkewTableaux_nmu!__   .sobj')
   _class!__   sage_combinat_skew_tableau_SemistandardSkewTableaux_p!__   .sobj')
   _class!__   sage_combinat_skew_tableau_SemistandardSkewTableaux_pmu!__   .sobj')
   _class!__   sage_combinat_skew_tableau_StandardSkewTableaux_n!__   .sobj')
   _class!__   sage_combinat_tableau_SemistandardTableaux_n!__   .sobj')
   _class!__   sage_combinat_tableau_SemistandardTableaux_nmu!__   .sobj')
   _class!__   sage_combinat_tableau_SemistandardTableaux_p!__   .sobj')
   _class!__   sage_combinat_tableau_SemistandardTableaux_pmu!__   .sobj')
   _class!__   sage_combinat_tableau_StandardTableaux_n!__   .sobj')
   _class!__   sage_combinat_tableau_StandardTableaux_partition!__   .sobj')
   _class!__   sage_combinat_tableau_Tableau_class!__   .sobj')
   _class!__   sage_combinat_tableau_Tableaux_n!__   .sobj')

shouldn't be there having been replaced with new improved pickles with slightly more informative names (for example, `_n_` -->  `_size_`, `_p_` --> `_shape_` etc.).  The pickle

  _class!__  sage_combinat_partition_PartitionTuples_nk!__  .sobj

I agree is mine to fix but I am also not entirely convinced that the first three pickles are caused by this patch, that is the following pickles:

  class!__  sage_combinat_crystals_affine_AffineCrystalFromClassicalAndPromotion_with_category_element_class!__  .sobj')
  class!__  sage_combinat_crystals_tensor_product_CrystalOfTableaux_with_category_element_class!__  .sobj')
  class!__  sage_combinat_crystals_tensor_product_TensorProductOfCrystalsWithGenerators_with_category!__  .sobj')

as I think that I might have also created new pickles for these in #9265. I am, of course, happy to rebuild them just in case.

Can you please confirm that the pickle_jar was updated as per the attachment for #9265. The mistake is quite probably mine as I assumed that the whole pickle jar would be replaced whereas if you just added in the new pickles then you would not have been aware that some of the old pickles needed to be deleted (although presumably it would not have been possible to unpickle them...??). If there is any documentation on updating the pickle jar please let me know.

Please advise.

Cheers,

Andrew

OK, I have fixed the long-test problem. With the pickle it seems to me that the only way to fix the problem is to replace the bad

```
PartitionTuples_nk
```
pickle in the pickle jar with a good one (and leave the other pickles untouched) as the underlying class has changed too much (vbraun posted a comment on #9265 suggesting that I should use `register_unpickle_override instead but I tried experimenting with this and it doesn't seem to work).`


Jeroen can you please confirm that you are are happy for me to do this.

Given the comments of Volker Braun and Simon King, I cannot be happy with this.  No objects should be removed from the pickle jar.
