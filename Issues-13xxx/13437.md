I can't tell. I have no access to a machine where these errors occur, nobody has ever produced a backtrace of it, and I even don't know in what test in each file the error occurs, what happens with gdb, what happens verbose, etc.
The three errors just "look" the same, in the sense of the doctester reports the same problem. That's why I think that the underlying problem could be the same.

I applied the patch and changed sage/parallel/use_fork.py as follows (this should cover all instances of `signal.signal(SIGALRM,...)` in that file):

The whole point of setting an alarm here is to interrupt a system call. Sage's default SIGALRM handler exits. So once we're not interested in alarms anymore, we should make sure we cancel any that we may have scheduled -- not that they get ignored.

It's mildly interesting to see that on at least one system, apparently a SIGALRM did trigger an unexpected system call termination. The `sigalrm.patch` changes two things: The type of exception that is caught (was a `RuntimeError` raised by the signal handler, now an `OSError` raised by python upon receiving an `EINTR` in os.wait) and the scheduling of alarms. Either one could have an effect, but note that it's quite likely that the observed differences in behaviour are almost certainly due to gdb's interference.

What exactly is the problem that this ticket is trying to fix? Because there is no longer a problem with #715 + #11521. There is also #13311 which changes the working of `alarm()`.

Proposal: close this as invalid. But if the problem can be more clearly stated and still persists with #13311, go ahead.
