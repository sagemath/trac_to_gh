libfes is a library (under development) that solves systems of boolean equations by exhaustive search. It is dramatically faster than Groebner bases in general.


## Installation Guide

* Download the fes-0.1 spkg [here](http://www.lifl.fr/~bouillaguet/download/fes-0.1.spkg)
* Apply [attachment:fes.2.patch] to the sage library
* Test:

```
sage: from sage.libs.fes import exhaustive_search
sage: R.<x,y,z> = BooleanPolynomialRing()
sage: f = [x*y + z + y + 1, x+y+z, x*y + y*z]
sage: ideal(f).variety()
sage: exhaustive_search(f)
```

**Note to release manage** the SPKG should be added to the experimental repository, but the patch should be applied to Sage.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Hi, I found a few small issues (so far) :)

**SPKG**

* little error in SPKG.txt

```
  === mypackage-0.1 (Charles Bouillaguet, 25 June 2012) ===
```
* `hg status` in the SPKG reports files that are not checked in.
* please include the Trac ticket number in the SPKG.txt changelog (and the hg commit message of your SPKG)

**Patch**

* since FES is a library its interface should live in sage.libs.fes and not sage.rings.polynomial.fes
* `exhaustive_search` has neither documentation nor doctests

  * INPUT shouldn't get a double ":" but a single one
  * AFAIK the argument list after input should look like

```
INPUT:

 - ``foo`` - description
```
* There shouldn't be leading "#" in your comments between code blocks, indentation does take care of it
* `sage:` blocks should be indented by four spaces wrt to the preceding block ending with `::` this includes the comments in between these code blocks
* who frees `dense_rep_eqs`?

* line 2: Sage is spelled Sage not SAGE, in fact "Binding for the FES library" should be sufficient, that this is for Sage is kind of obvious
* You define exhaustive_search as !`cpdef` but you don't specify input and output types, defeating the purpose of having it callable from C
* If it that function ought to be a Python function then perhaps max_sols should accept infinity as a parameter for "no restriction". It's what the SAT solver interface in Sage does.

* One can also specify verbosity with !`set_verbose`, if you like !`verbose` as a parameter better for some reason, no strict need to change it, most people don't use !`set/get_verbose` in their code it seems.
* "The order in which the solutions are returned is implementation dependent" if that's the case, then the doctests need to take that into account, i.e., they have the order hard coded at the moment. You could run sorted() on the output (in the doctests)

My understanding is that this is caused by the conditional inclusion of the cython module to the Sage library, depending on whether the actual spkg has been installed. I thought that this was the way to go for experimental packages. But apparently, it prevents me from including stuff in the reference manual.

What should I do ? Unconditionally include the python code to the SAGE library and mark all the doctests as optional ?

That's not true.  The `module_list.py` magic is only about *compiling* the Cython file, which is completely orthogonal to doctests.  The `fes.pyx` file is always there (regardless of whether it is compiled), so the doctests are there.

Hi malb & Jeroen. OK, I get it now, sorry for the noise. I marked the doctests as optional and fixed the spkg. 

Since I have installed the libFES package in my sage tree, I don't see how I could test without it? (how to uninstall a spkg ?).
