Currently if you set scientific notation for the real interval field, it does not print in scientific notation.

```
sage: RIF.scientific_notation(True)
sage: RIF(0.025)
0.025000000000000002?
sage: RIF.scientific_notation()
True
sage: RIF(0.025)
0.025000000000000002?
sage: RIF(0.025).str(no_sci=False)
'2.5000000000000002?e-2'
```
This is caused by not checking when `no_sci` option is `None` (and then checking the parent). After patch:

```
sage: RIF(0.025)
0.025000000000000002?
sage: RIF.scientific_notation(True)
sage: RIF(0.025)
2.5000000000000002?e-2
```

Minor nit: I'd prefere "not no_sci" to  "no_sci == False" in case the user passes a value like `0`. But other than that, looks good (including the nice docstring cleanups).
