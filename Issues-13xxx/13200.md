The patch adds dedekind_sum() to arith.py, wrapping the FLINT implementation. 

Pari is also exposed (inefficiently, using the gp interface) for reference purposes. Note that FLINT and Pari return different results when gcd(p,q) != 1. The Dedekind is usually simply not defined in this case. If anyone knows a use for Dedekind sums with gcd(p,q) != 1, and a reason to prefer one definition over the other, I would be interested in hearing about it.

We could, alternatively, check that gcd(p,q) = 1 and otherwise return 0 or raise an exception (this would add a bit of overhead).

The patch depends on #13199 for a library file added there.
