Version 0.11.0 of scipy was released on September 26, 2012. We should update: among other things, the new version builds out of the box on OS X Lion and OS X Mountain Lion.

The new version has two changes which affect doctests and Sage library code:

- the "order" argument for the Pade approximation for matrix exponentiation has been deprecated and no longer has any effect (except to print a deprecation message). So this requires fixing a doctest or two. I also removed any use of this argument from the Sage code.

- the function `stats.ttest_ind` seems to return its output in a slightly different format. So another doctest needs to be changed.

**Apply**: [attachment:trac_13541-doctest.patch]
