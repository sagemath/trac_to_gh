Right now `sage -startuptime` reports startup time including children. This isn't particularly useful since that just means that the first module (which loads most of sage as dependencies) is the slowest. The more meaningful number is exclusive children, which can tell us if the module does computations during initialization.

Now with disabled garbage collector (it did skew timings) and with optional argument a module that you want to know more about:

Two questions:

- would it be useful to be able to sort by times including children (keeping the default as is) by specifying a command-line argument? (I don't know the answer to this one.)

- should the usage `sage --startuptime [modulename]` be documented in `sage --advanced` and in `devel/sage/doc/en/reference/options.rst`? (I think the answer to this one is "yes". See the attached referee patches.)

I don't think there is much point in the inclusive startup time, that just tells you which library was imported first (and then pulled in a lot of sage modules for the first time). Thats why the old startuptime always showed a ridiculously long time for `sage.algebras.iwahori_hecke_algebra` despite this being a very lightweight module.

Thanks for the referee patches, they look great!
