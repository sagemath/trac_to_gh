Right now `sage -startuptime` reports startup time including children. This isn't particularly useful since that just means that the first module (which loads most of sage as dependencies) is the slowest. The more meaningful number is exclusive children, which can tell us if the module does computations during initialization.

The more meaningful number is exclusive children, which can tell us if the module does computations during initialization.
