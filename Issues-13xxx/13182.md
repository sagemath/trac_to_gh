After updating to 0.7 in #13176 we should move to the latest release.

The 0.9.1 spkg is at https://bitbucket.org/gvol/sage-mode/downloads/sage_mode-0.9.1.spkg

Version 0.8 includes support python.el by fgallina which will is in Emacs 24.2.

Version 0.9 includes improved sage-view rendering and, importantly, support the new ipython.  Without 0.9 simple things such as tab completion are completely broken in Sage 5.7 and later.

Version 0.9.1 Fixes some problems reported on this ticket.

The AUCTeX integration is great! But I do notice one problem with emacs 24:

If you don't have org-mode installed and you load a TeX file -- with or without any Sage stuff in it -- I get "Can't find library org". If I then install org-mode, loading a TeX file gives `File mode specification error: (void-function loop)`.

This is with the current state of Ubuntu 13.04: emacs 24.2, AUCTeX 11.87 and org-mode 7.9.2. In Ubuntu 12.10 (versions 23.4, 11.86, 7.8.11, respectively) things work fine.
