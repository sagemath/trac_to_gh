Version 0.8 includes support python.el by fgallina which will is in Emacs 24.2.

Version 0.9 includes improved sage-view rendering and, importantly, support the new ipython.  Without 0.9 simple things such as tab completion are completely broken in Sage 5.7 and later.

Version 0.9.1 Fixes some problems reported on this ticket.
