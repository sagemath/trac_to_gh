Version 0.8 includes support python.el by fgallina which will is in Emacs 24.2.

Version 0.9 includes improved sage-view rendering and, importantly, support the new ipython.  Without 0.9 simple things such as tab completion are completely broken in Sage 5.7 and later.

> Backtrace for the problem when org isn't installed: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/drake/13182load-tex-file-backtrace.txt . Your 0.9.1 spkg fixes the `loop` problem when I have org-mode installed in emacs 24.


This seems to be a bug in org-mode (the version that's shipped with your emacs).  It's finding some org files (in particular org-latex), but can't actually `(require 'org)`.  Normally org wouldn't be loaded at run time, only at compile time, but since byte-compilation failed (due to this error), it also occurred at run time.  I have updated the spkg on bitbucket to work around this issue (I hope). 

Thanks for testing.

I have tried on sage 5.10.rc1, and it works fine.

In particular, tab completion works.

I had to install preview-latex-style, which is not by default on my ubuntu LTS.

I would give a positive review, but I would prefer if Nicolas or Florent confirm me !
