Executing:

```
M=ModularForms(Gamma1(29),base_ring=GF(29))
S=M.cuspidal_subspace()
S.basis()
```
gives:

```
[
1 + O(q^6),
q + O(q^6),
q^2 + O(q^6),
q^3 + O(q^6),
q^4 + O(q^6),

```

The first element is clearly not cuspidal

Looking at sage/modular/modform/cuspidal_submodule.py, it seems that the cuspidal submodule is just defined by

* computing its dimension d
* taken the first d vectors of the basis of modular forms

So it implicitly assumes that the cusp forms come first in the listing of the basis.

On the other hand, the "is_cuspidal" method just checks that the element is in the cuspidal submodule. Is there a way to really check if something is cuspidal ?
