Executing:

```
M=ModularForms(Gamma1(29),base_ring=GF(29))
S=M.cuspidal_subspace()
S.basis()
```
gives:

```
[
1 + O(q^6),
q + O(q^6),
q^2 + O(q^6),
q^3 + O(q^6),
q^4 + O(q^6),
q^5 + O(q^6),

```

The first element is clearly not cuspidal

Looking at sage/modular/modform/cuspidal_submodule.py, it seems that the cuspidal submodule is just defined by

* computing its dimension d
* taken the first d vectors of the basis of modular forms

So it implicitly assumes that the cusp forms come first in the listing of the basis.

On the other hand, the "is_cuspidal" method just checks that the element is in the cuspidal submodule. Is there a way to really check if something is cuspidal ?

The issue was in `sage.modular.modform.ambient_R.py`, where `q_integral_basis` was used for positive characteristic base rings.  However, `q_integral_basis` does not guarantee that its output is in the format exhibited by `q_expansion_basis`, i.e. starting with a basis for the cuspidal subspace and completed to a basis of the entire space.

The modified code now computes an integral basis for the cuspidal subspace and then completes it to an integral basis of the whole space.  This strategy works for rings of prime power characteristic (e.g. finite fields or integers modulo a prime power, the two main use cases currently in Sage).
