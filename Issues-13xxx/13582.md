```
According to http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#chapter-testing

"Creates the directory .doctest if it does not exist and the file .doctest/foo.py."

Unfortunately, it probably does this in the ~ directory, right?  No way to force something else?

From the installation guide:

    SAGE_TESTDIR - a temporary directory used during Sageâ€™s doctesting. The default is to use the directory $DOT_SAGE/tmp, but you can override that by setting this variable. 

So try setting this environment variable. You could also set DOT_SAGE to something else.


Thanks, John!  I knew this had to be somewhere, but it's not in the "testing" section. In fact, it's neither in 

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/doctesting.html 

nor 

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html
```

This ticket is to put at least brief references or links on those pages (in the appropriate doctest places) to any relevant environment variables, such as `SAGE_TESTDIR`.

Wow, I guess the old documentation was just wrong, then.  Thanks very much.

I would ask for "See the Sage installation guide" to have a link.  Otherwise it looks very comprehensive and ok.  I won't be able to confirm these data points independently (though I certainly don't doubt them) immediately, but once I check whether it applies etc. I'll do that too.

One more interesting thing, though I don't think it's important.

```
gc04855:tmp $ ls new_[tab]
new_83093.py           new_host_2.home-43116/ new_host_2.home-58497/
new_83093_orig.py      new_host_2.home-44201/ new_host_2.home-59194/
new_83093_orig.pyc     new_host_2.home-49485/ new_host_2.home-62339/
```
Note the `.pyc` file; this happens with the `.sage` files as well.

```
gc04855:tmp $ ls new_[tab]
new_83339.py             new_host_2.home-43116/   new_host_2.home-59194/
new_83339.sage           new_host_2.home-44201/   new_host_2.home-62339/
new_83339_preparsed.py   new_host_2.home-49485/   new_host_2.home-64436/
new_83339_preparsed.pyc  new_host_2.home-49732/   new_host_2.home-66925/
```
What do you think?

Right, that's what I was wondering.  If not, positive review.  If yes, they should be mentioned.  

I guess since Sage doesn't actually create them per se, maybe it's ok?   Revert to something else if you think otherwise.  It doesn't seem crucial, though I thought I would point it out.

I think it's okay to omit them. I view this passage in the documentation as being a description of what `sage-doctest` does, and I think it does that accurately. Creating pyc files is a side effect, and I don't think it needs explicit mention.
