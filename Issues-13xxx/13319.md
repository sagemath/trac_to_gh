<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

Some further details:
- issue 9665 is still opened (and as it is back from 2010 and was not modified since, I doubt it will be closed any time soon unless one of us takes action);
- issue 14337 has been merged, but unfortunately after the Python 2.7.3 release;
- issue 14338 has been closed as invalid and marked as a Cygwin, rather than Python, bug, why not... but what's sure is that it prevents to build Python on Cygwin.

The patche we need from 9665 modifies configure.in (the other patch is just issue 14337).
In order to take it into account in the configure script, I ran "autoreconf -i" which also modified the configure script in several other places, but in a seemingly harmless way.
It is mainly because I used a newer version of autotools than the one originally used for the Python 2.7.3 release, and autotools decided inbetween to prefix some variables names with "ac_".
A somehow less invasive solution would be to directly patch the configure script, but I'm less inclined to do so than properly patching configure.in.

The updated spkg is available at:
http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/sage/python-2.7.3.p1.spkg

It builds correctly on Ubuntu 12.04 64 bits and is currently building on my Cygwin 1.7.16 on Windows 7 64 bits (it failed a first time but because of memory exhaustion which I often get while using Cygwin or MinGW).

I've search trac for a more recent spkg than the 2.7.3.p0 but did not find anything.
If I missed some tickets including such an spkg, please let me know or directly rebase the patches proposed here.

this patch (apparently) allowed Python spkg to build on my Cygwin installation (on 32-bit Win 7). Good!

The next spkg, mercurial, failed with a typical fork() trouble. But this is probably not related. I guess now I need to rebaseall, including newly created dlls...

Indeed.  This is likely because the previous `configure` script was created by a distribution-patched `autoconf` with the same version number, but some patches added.

Ok, I've slightly reworked your spkg to properly rebase it on the sage shipped spkg (I guess you took the spkg from the ticket page which does not contain the hg tag).
I've simplified a patch which modified useless parts of configure.
I've updated the patches so that there is no fuzz.
There does not seem to be tar problems anymore (I got these with your original spkg).

If you wanna have a look and check it builds correctly it shoudl stay positive review I guess.

I've checked it builds ok on Linux and will try Cygwin tonight.
As downloading sage 5.5.rc0 from boxen is too low and I've deleted the tar, I'll try to begin from a built dir from my linux install,  not sure it will work.

Attachment: **[python-2.7.3.p3.diff.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13319/python-2.7.3.p3.diff.gz)**

I've built the spkg successfully with sage-5.5.rc0 on my windows 7 (64 bits) as well.
Python says some modules were not build, but the same is true under linux (in fact there is no inclusion between the two lists, some modules were built on Cygwin (_curses, _curses_panel, imageop, dbm, dl) and not on Linux and vice-versa (nis, spwd, linuxaudiodex, ossaudiodev))/

So let's leave this as positive review, nothing really changed since Dima review, and merge this asap to avoid further rebasing.

Hilarious - it's yet another combo on XP and another on Mac.

That's because of a slightly different tar format (GNU tar vs. BSD tar). But that's no problem because my merger script always untars and tars the spkgs to ensure a consistent format.
