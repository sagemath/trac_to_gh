Presently, there are whole ranges of matrix sizes and ranks where the default heuristic for choosing an `echelon_form` algorithm for matrices over `QQ` chooses the slowest choice possible:

```
from sage.misc.sage_timeit import sage_timeit
def timemat(n,m,r,B):
    """
    does some matrix timings on a single random matrix described by the
    parameters given:
      n : Number of distinct rows
      m : Number of colums
      r : Number of times the rows should be repeated
      B : Height bound on rational numbers put in the matrix
    
    The matrix is essentially generated by constructing an n x m matrix
    with random entries and then stacking r copies. This is meant as a cheap
    way of making non-maximal rank matrices.
    """    
    M = MatrixSpace(QQ,n*r,m)
    L = r*list(randint(-B,B)/randint(1,B) for j in range(n*m))
    D = globals().copy()
    D['M'] = M
    D['L'] = L
    t1=min(sage_timeit('M(L).echelon_form("classical")',D).series)
    t2=min(sage_timeit('M(L).echelon_form("multimodular")',D).series)/t1
    t3=min(sage_timeit('M(L).echelon_form("padic")',D).series)/t1
    return (1,t2,t3)
```
Timings are reported as `(classical,multimodular,padic)` with `classical` scaled to 1. These tests are all in the range where currently `padic` is chosen as a default. These timings are all done on 5.3b2 + #12313 + fix of Thierry's code + un-randomization of prime choice in `padic`. Without #12313 one would run out of memory on `padic` and without the other ones, the timings of padic would be much worse:

```
sage: timemat(10,10,1,10^3)
(1, 1.4593604789072667, 2.25968735560318)
sage: timemat(10,10,1,10^800)
(1, 1.4550198262904093, 2.2320730206016584)
sage: timemat(20,20,1,10^800)
(1, 0.26421709436394647, 0.39672901423049933)
sage: timemat(50,50,1,10^20)
(1, 0.028462514595311343, 0.04085242952549667)
sage: timemat(20,30,2,10^20)
(1, 1.311503148833886, 1.0495737479473444)
sage: timemat(20,30,1,10^20)
(1, 1.1408739793541882, 0.8243377328388548)
sage: timemat(20,30,2,10^800)
(1, 1.0566089264644132, 1.2234341427870548)
sage: timemat(50,60,2,10^800)
(1, 0.5444370157383747, 0.18547612309046932)
```
so it seems that the cross-overs could use some tuning. In particular, for non-maximal rank matrices it seems to take a while longer to overtake classical. It would be great if someone would be able to tune this code properly. It is very useful if sage would echelonize small matrices quickly over arbitrary base fields quickly in most most cases (and not make silly choices), because it allows linear algebra intensive algorithms in a base-field agnostic way.

See [#13400, comment 29](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/13400#comment:29) for the context of some of the remarks about the conditions under which these timings were made. The essential problem reported in this ticket is quite independent of memory issues, though!
