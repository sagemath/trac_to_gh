The converter is available here

  https://github.com/Daeinar/anf2cnf-sage/blob/master/anf2cnf_sage.py

we should consider it for inclusion as it is more flexible than what we have now.

**ANF**
Algebraic Normal Form = Boolean polynomials = Square free polynomials over GF(2)

**CNF**
Conjunctive Normal Form = ANDs of OR clauses = form SAT-solvers understand

The code is not ready for inclusion in Sage yet:

* `phi` is a function in this converter, but an attribute in the one currently included in Sage. Also, `phi` returns a reference to an internal mutable variable, instead of a copy

Made some modifications to the code:

* Every function now has at least one doctest
* `phi` is now a `@property`
* marked `self.one` and `self.zero` as local (although `self.zero` could be deleted completely as it is never used) 

What I want to do next is adding some error checking mechanisms for user parameters and re-implementing the `c_lin_cnf` function in a more generic way. Anything else that I forgot?

Note that you misformated the doctest blocks: There's a `::` after the preceding line (e.g. `EXAMPLE::`) which starts a code block. Also, there's supposed to be an empty line between the `EXAMPLE::` and the first line of the code block. Again, this is part of the markup which starts a code block.

> * `phi` is now a `@property`

Lets remove it then :)

As far as I can see, no.

Something that I think would be nice to have is some kind of mechanism which automatically selects (per polynomial?!) the "best suited" conversion strategy, as by now the user has to specify how all the polynomials get converted. But first one would have to find out what "best" means in this case before anything in that direction could be done. And even then I guess we would get very fast into NP complete areas. So a heuristic would be fine, too ...

Hi!

Please add in the doc and ticket description what ANF and CNF mean; that will save some time for the non experts, and will help find them through searches.

Thanks!

Today I've added the generic implementation for `c_lin_cnf` using some combinatorics. By now I've restricted the `cutting_number` to range(3,8) (see line 58). I don't think greater `cutting_numbers` are really that useful as the number of clauses grows exponentially. Nevertheless, if required, this restriction can be easily removed. Well now only some further error checking is missing...
