```
The converter is available here

  https://github.com/Daeinar/anf2cnf-sage/blob/master/anf2cnf_sage.py

we should consider it for inclusion as it is more flexible than what we have now.

**ANF**
Algebraic Normal Form = Boolean polynomials = Square free polynomials over GF(2)

**CNF**
Conjunctive Normal Form = ANDs of OR clauses = form SAT-solvers understand

<a id='comment:4'></a>Made some modifications to the code:

* Every function now has at least one doctest
* `phi` is now a ``@`property`
* marked `self.one` and `self.zero` as local (although `self.zero` could be deleted completely as it is never used) 

What I want to do next is adding some error checking mechanisms for user parameters and re-implementing the `c_lin_cnf` function in a more generic way. Anything else that I forgot?

Lets remove it then :)

As far as I can see, no.

Something that I think would be nice to have is some kind of mechanism which automatically selects (per polynomial?!) the "best suited" conversion strategy, as by now the user has to specify how all the polynomials get converted. But first one would have to find out what "best" means in this case before anything in that direction could be done. And even then I guess we would get very fast into NP complete areas. So a heuristic would be fine, too ...

Please add in the doc and ticket description what ANF and CNF mean; that will save some time for the non experts, and will help find them through searches.
