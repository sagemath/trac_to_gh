Not required, as John said.

Not really a big deal I think

>  * we're adding another dependency of sage


No we're not - we're including another package in Sage.

By the way, I asked the author of speaklater on IRC to release a new version containing the fix for the pickling problem we ran across in sagenb many months ago, and a couple of days ago he seems to have released 1.3, so here's a new SPKG: http://wstein.org/home/keshav/files/speaklater-1.3.spkg

There was a typo in Mike's version of `speaklater.py` (`__eq__` was broken); os.path.join now works without the explicit string cast.

`os.path.exists` doesn't though (and I'm not sure exactly why, since I can't find the source code of `os.stat`).

```
The temporary doctesting directory
   /Users/palmieri/.sage/tmp/jpalmieri538-76123
was not removed: it is not empty, presumably because doctests
failed or doctesting was interrupted.
```
With your change, the files get left in subdirectories of `tmp/jpalmieri538/` which are then cleaned up the next time Sage runs (or maybe when it exits). Since we have in the past decided to intentionally not delete the failing files, I'm not sure it's appropriate to automatically delete them.
