+1 for Mike's solution, I know nothing about the flask notebook, but we certainly shouldn't include speaklater in the manner it is done in the patch.

Also, why are we using temp files and directories in `DOT_SAGE` still, I see no reason to not use the tempfile module with Mike's patch.

I also vote for the spkg. The one Keshav provided looks fine.

Not required, as John said.

Not really a big deal I think

>  * we're adding another dependency of sage


No we're not - we're including another package in Sage.

By the way, I asked the author of speaklater on IRC to release a new version containing the fix for the pickling problem we ran across in sagenb many months ago, and a couple of days ago he seems to have released 1.3, so here's a new SPKG: http://wstein.org/home/keshav/files/speaklater-1.3.spkg

There was a typo in Mike's version of `speaklater.py` (`__eq__` was broken); os.path.join now works without the explicit string cast.

`os.path.exists` doesn't though (and I'm not sure exactly why, since I can't find the source code of `os.stat`).

Okay, the problem is the line

```
return os.path.join(SAGE_TMP, 'spyx', os.sep) 
```
According to the documentation for [os.path.join](http://docs.python.org/library/os.path.html#os.path.join):

    If any component is an absolute path, all previous components are thrown away, and joining continues.

So if you use os.sep (which is '/', an absolute path), everything before that is discarded. I've provided a revised referee's patch to fix this. My changes need review.

Failed doctests are *supposed* to leave files lying around. For example, when I run `sage -tp ...` and there is a failure, I see a message

```
The temporary doctesting directory
   /Users/palmieri/.sage/tmp/jpalmieri538-76123
was not removed: it is not empty, presumably because doctests
failed or doctesting was interrupted.
```
With your change, the files get left in subdirectories of `tmp/jpalmieri538/` which are then cleaned up the next time Sage runs (or maybe when it exits). Since we have in the past decided to intentionally not delete the failing files, I'm not sure it's appropriate to automatically delete them.

I would suggest moving the Sage root patch and corresponding discussion to #12415, since that ticket modifies the doctesting framework considerably. I think that temporary files are not even created anymore during doctesting with the patches there. (Maybe you can help out with the interrupt issues, too.)
