New upload: added documentation and examples for new commands.

Still to do: 

1) Add a function _has_two_cycles

2) Fix documenation for, or possibly delete "old-methods"

3) More thorough check of code and trying to break functions or find corner cases.

Just added the missing _has_two_cycles function.

Christian's recent changes seems to have solidified the documentation and coverage. (Although I don't see ClusterSeed or MutationClass.py commands showing up)

Pending 13369 and some additional testing to make sure no corner cases, should be ready to go.

<div id="comment:7" align="right">comment:7</div>

Here is a first review:

- we should add some tests that the computed class sizes coincide with the expected class sizes in QuiverMutationType

- the non-iter methods (mutation_class <-> mutation_class_iter) should also contain examples since these are the typical used methods

- l1318: "# runs forever without the mutation type recognition patch applied" we should make clear what this means (I don't even know currently).

- recheck that the file mutation_class.py is organized well.

- building the doctest and going through the docs.

Beside these, the patch looks good to me: the code is a little complicated but the methods are well-documented.

<div id="comment:17" align="right">comment:17</div>

I just posted a fourth review patch that 

-slightly improves the documentation for up_to_equivalence, and

-starts depth counting at 0 when show_depth=True.  This is most relevant for the iterator functions.

I uploaded this a second time (meaning to rewrite over the original) but forgot to check the "replace" box.

Consequently, I replaced the first file with a 216 byte empty patch.

Hopefully the patchbot will be happy with this.  Christian, if you get a chance, feel free to delete the 216 byte patch.

Pending the patchbot and other further issues, I think this ticket is now ready for a positive review.
