Hello,
1. you need to provide a good commit message. You can do that by using hg. This will then appear in your patch instead of the `[mq]: bandwidth` at the top of the patch.

```
sage -hg qref -m "a good commit message"
```
2. Also, name your patch as per this ticket number. Such as `trac_13565-bandwidth.patch`, instead of simply `bandwidth.patch`.

Both these modifications help the release manager when the patch is merged into Sage proper. Same comments apply to your dependency ticket #13564.
