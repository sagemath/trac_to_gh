Kevin,

Very nice.  This will be a great contribution.  Comments, in order of appearance,I think.

Rob


1.  Title:  I'd avoid symbols in the title.  Both bad grammar and potential text-processing problem.  Maybe "...every group of order 31 or less" or "...every group of order less than 32"
2. "They can all be initiatilized relatively easily." -> "created easily"?
3.  "permutation groups already implemented in sage" -> "already created"  or "already initialized"  (implementing is what you are doing)
4.  "The group outputted by the semidirect product command" -> "output"
5.  "witheld" - two h's
6.  "KleinFourGroup" as description:  C2 x C2 would fit better with the remainder (and the command you used has this name in it)
7.  `D_6` is used for order 14 dicyclic
8.  I presume you used lists to get multiline output into the table.  Maybe for a consistent look you should use a one-line list in other locations.  Did you try to experiment with any kind of "verbatim" or "pre-formatted" code to enforce line breaks on the hunks of code?  Might be possible, could be impossible.  At least the lists cut/paste cleanly.  Do you need the "sage: " prompts?  Do these get doctested?
9.  Add your name as author. (At the bottom?)
10.  Would it be feasible to add the !Thomas/Wood numbers/id to each row of the table??  That'd add some credibility.  Should probably reference the whole book at a minimum.
21.  Would it make sense to add some of this as simple doctests, so if a key construction function changes, then it'll get relected here?

RAB

Attached is an updated table. After quite a bit of experimenting, I figured out a way to get all of the commands to get set as script and be doctests. Do you think this was the right choice (addressing 8 and 11)?

Also, I didn't add the Thomas/Woods ids, as I don't own a copy of the book anymore. I don't think they are really necessary, considering how difficult the book is to get one's hands on, but if you really do we can figure out a way for me to get a copy.

I don't know !Thomas/Woods. But I think the de-facto standard of enumerating the small groups in computational group theory circles is GAP's `IdGroup`, being a pair `(order, n)` where `n` starts at 1 and indexes the groups. Of course its easy to compute if you install the (non-GPL) small group database:

```
sage: install_package('database_gap')
...
sage: G = DihedralGroup(10)
sage: gap(G).IdGroup()
[ 20, 4 ]
```
