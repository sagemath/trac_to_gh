Not at all, it is just that we did not customize the win32 makefile correctly before.
Whence the need to install zlib and zlib-devel (or Cygwin equivalents, not sure of the name now) because our own zlib was lacking shared objects.

I mean it is unrelated because zlib does not use autotools at all.

If you really want it can be related in the sense that in the end the problem is that shared objects are not installed (even though in the autotools case they are not even built).

That is what I meant, I guess.

So this would remove the zlib-devel dependency on Win 7, okay, I understand now.

OK, it builds and works on 64-bit Windows 7 with the latest stable Cygwin, and native Cygwin gcc and gfortran.
Needed to rebase 2 times during the build. Running tests now.

This ticket looks good, positive review.

But, on my side at least, it seems that somehow the situation has gotten better recently.
For my last attempt, I just had to rebase once after installing everything to be able to launch Sage (although after reinstalling some spkg I got stuck with a fork error).

this script, which basically runs the same 2 shell commands as we use to rebase Sage, must be run in a non-cygwin shell (Cygwin includes a copy of dash for this purpose), not in bash. Perhaps we should convert it into a dash  script.

Next time state the obvious problem at once instead of linking to a not so obvious for anyone log...
Especially when it seems that all objects are rebuilt there and the problematic libz.a is repackaged correctly.

And I don't usually look into the src folder, too bad this one comes from a test build and is not vanilla.

The newly uploaded spkg should be clean.
It stills builds on Cygwin and Linux correctly (note the previous one did as well).
No access to Os X, but checking the src dir is vanilla should be enough.

"obvious" refered to the fact that a *zlib build failure* might likely be caused by a *zlib package update*.  I hadn't checked the spkg at that point.
