Not at all, it is just that we did not customize the win32 makefile correctly before.
Whence the need to install zlib and zlib-devel (or Cygwin equivalents, not sure of the name now) because our own zlib was lacking shared objects.

I mean it is unrelated because zlib does not use autotools at all.

If you really want it can be related in the sense that in the end the problem is that shared objects are not installed (even though in the autotools case they are not even built).

That is what I meant, I guess.

So this would remove the zlib-devel dependency on Win 7, okay, I understand now.

You can run ldd on libs which should use zlib, I'd say it's the case of libgd and libfreetype (from inside a Sage shell).
Or you could just check that the zlib1.dll file is indeed installed.

OK, it builds and works on 64-bit Windows 7 with the latest stable Cygwin, and native Cygwin gcc and gfortran.
Needed to rebase 2 times during the build. Running tests now.

But, on my side at least, it seems that somehow the situation has gotten better recently.
For my last attempt, I just had to rebase once after installing everything to be able to launch Sage (although after reinstalling some spkg I got stuck with a fork error).
Before that I sometimes had to do horrible stuff like rebasing in the middle of the build of the Maxim spkg, which was kind of painful.

Especially when it seems that all objects are rebuilt there and the problematic libz.a is repackaged correctly.
