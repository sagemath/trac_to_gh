Since this function is working for undirected graphs only, it should not be in generic_graph.py.

The following function should be way faster and avoids a copy of the graph.

```
def is_edge_cut(self,e):
    if not self.has_edge(e):
        raise ValueError, 'edge not in graph' 

    eu = e[0]
    ev = e[1]

    visited = dict([(u,False) for u in self.vertex_iterator()])
    visited[eu] = True
    s = set(self.neighbors(eu))
    s.remove(ev)
    while (len(s) > 0) and not visited[ev]:
        w = s.pop()
        visited[w] = True
        for x in self.neighbor_iterator(w):
            if not visited[x]:
                s.add(x)

    return (not visited[ev]) and (self.degree(ev)>1)
```

Well, you can let it in generic_graph since it has also some interest for connectivity in digraphs.

My fault (last test in the return). 
This new version is much better. It allows multiple formats of input, solves the pending edge problem, cope with multi-edges. It remains to add examples and tests.

```

    visited[u] = True
    s = set(self.neighbors(u))
    s.remove(v)
    while (len(s) > 0) and not visited[v]:

        visited[w] = True

            if not visited[x]:

Last, I don't know if the function should be named is_edge_cut or is_cut_edge

Also, I'm not sure of the behavior of 'EXAMPLES' versus 'TESTS'. Are examples also considered as tests for 'sage -t'? Is anyone able to answer?

I tested docbuild and it looks fine.  Is your issue at 4024 that """ should be 4 spaces back.  I fixed that and uploaded again.

Hello,

I had some discussions with Nathann, and he said that the following should be faster:

```
    self.delete_edge(u,v,label)
    ans = self.distance(u,v) < self.order()
    self.add_edge(u,v,label)
    return ans
```

I tried it on large graphs and it is definitively faster (10x to 100x). It is in fact the same algorithm behind, but the distance function is in cython, so it's fast.

Sorry for the extra work, but it would be better to replace the lines from **# We search for a path from** till the end with above code.

This no longer works for digraphs.  It returns that an edge in a directed cycle is a cut edge because if we remove that edge there is no *directed* path between those two vertices.  There is a connected_components_number function for digraphs, but comparing connected_components_number(G) and connected_components_number(G-e) is probably not the fastest way to make it work for digraphs.

Another option is:

```
    self.delete_edge(u,v,label)
    if self.is_directed():
        ans = self.is_connected()
    else:
        ans = self.distance(u,v) < self.order()
    self.add_edge(u,v,label)
    return not ans
```

the self.is_connected() function would be sufficient, but the distance function is faster for undirected graphs.

Don't forget to explain the behavior for directed graphs in the description of the function.

Apparently you did something wrong when updating the patch. It contains only parts of the function (last modifications).

Your proposition for directed graphs can be improved because you don't need to copy the graph. It is sufficient to remove edge (u,v), and to later restore it. For instance, you can do:

```
self.delete_edge(u,v,label)
if self.is_directed():
    # (u,v) is a cut edge if u is not in the connected component 
    # containing v of self-(u,v), 
    sol = not u in self.connected_component_containing_vertex(v)
else:
    # (u,v) is a cut edge if there is no path from u to v in self-(u,v) 
    sol = not self.distance(u,v) < self.order()

self.add_edge(u,v,label)
return sol
```
In fact, the connected_components_number function uses the connected_component_containing_vertex function. So it is easier that way.
