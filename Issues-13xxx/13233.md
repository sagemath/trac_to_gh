Hi Jessica and Julie,

Great that you wrote your first patch. I have a couple of requests for the doc tests:
First of all, there is a spelling error "certianly". Also, the EXAMPLES are not so useful. It might be a good idea to include a test like 

```
sage: P.vertices()
...
sage: P.cover_relations()
```
to make sure to really specify the poset in the doctests.

Thanks,

Anne
