Currently, libGAP doesn't give useful errors if something goes wrong during initialization.

Also, the GAP SIGINT handler got installed, this is fixed in the new spkg. Now Ctrl-C works as expected.

I don't know if it is an issue related with this patch or if it comes from libgap itself, but i have experienced some problems when i use tab completion in a session in the command line (i haven't checked it in the notebook).

An example:

```
sage: F=libgap.eval('FreeGroup(2)')
sage: (a,b)=F.GeneratorsOfGroup()
sage: H=F/libgap([a^2,b^2,a*b*a*b])
sage: H
<fp group on the generators [ f1, f2 ]>
sage: H.IsomorphismSimplifiedFpGroup()
[ f1, f2 ] -> [ f1, f2 ]
sage: H=F/libgap([a^2,b^2,a*b])    
sage: c=H.Gene
H.GeneralLinearGroup      H.GeneralisedEigenspaces  H.GeneralizedEigenvalues  H.GeneratorsOfIdeal
H.GeneralOrthogonalGroup  H.GeneralisedEigenvalues  H.GeneratorsOfField       
H.GeneralUnitaryGroup     H.GeneralizedEigenspaces  H.GeneratorsOfGroup       
sage: c=H.GeneratorsOfGroup()[0]

The new patch allows to change the comparison method for libgap objects since not all GAP objects can be compared. This is important if you want use them as cache keys.

Also, the comparison was not properly wrapped in `sig_on/sig_off`

While building the documentation with this patch included, twice something went wrong.
1. First time, I got an "unhandled SIGSEGV" in Sage while reading the sources of some elliptic curve file (sorry, forgot which one) for the PDF documentation.  I didn't store the exact logs since I thought it was a cosmic ray or something...
2. Next attempt, building from scratch again during the build of the HTML documentation:

MemoryError
```

I cannot say for sure that this ticket is to blame, but the `MemoryError` certainly made me suspect GAP. And I also saw some "halving pool size" messages appear during the docbuilding.

Theoretically true, but a normal Sage session won't start GAP until it has to and libGAP is lazily imported as well. Even then, none of that has anything to do with the elliptic curve stuff. 

Right now the only thing in this ticket that seems to actually influence the docbuild is that the documentation becomes larger.

I suspect that GAP has something to do with this.

Could you somehow fix the memory allocation to allocate an absolutely minimal amount during docbuilding?  Maybe it would make sense to introduce an environment variable `SAGE_GAP_MEGABYTES` which could be user-set to the desired memory size and which would be set by the docbuilder to a small number (say, 1 MB).

I've added a setting to our Sphinx config (`doc/common/conf.py`) and builder config (`build_options.py`) to use only the minimum amount for GAP memory pool. The builder and sphinx itself both import everything to get at docstrings, so two libgap instances are being created when building the documentation. I verified that I can now build all documentation with `ulimit -v 2500000`).

The following is fairly reproducible (with #13717 applied):

```
sage -t  -force_lib devel/sagenb-main/sagenb/misc/support.py
**********************************************************************
File "/release/merger/sage-5.7.beta1/devel/sagenb-main/sagenb/misc/support.py", line 479:
    sage: sage.server.support.syseval(gap, "2+3")
Expected:
    '5'
Got:
    ** Gap crashed or quit executing '2+3;' **
    Restarting Gap and trying again
    '5'
**********************************************************************
```

Note that GAP is started with only 1MB of memory, as the top of this `strace` log shows:

```
execve("/release/merger/sage-5.7.beta1/local/gap/latest/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc-default64/gap", ["/release/merger/sage-5.7.beta1/local/gap/latest/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc-default64/gap", "-m", "24m", "-l", "/release/merger/sage-5.7.beta1/local/gap/latest", "-r", "-b", "-p", "-T", "-o", "1m", "-s", "1m", "/release/merger/sage-5.7.beta1/local/share/sage/ext/gap/sage.g"], [/* 84 vars */]) = 0
```
