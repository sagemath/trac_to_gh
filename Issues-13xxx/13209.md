Things like `letters` should be `'letters'`, and I'm pretty sure that the list in `elements` should be a list of strings?  This would be easy for people to check - just try out all options!

```
           INPUT:

            - ``names`` - the type of names used, values are:

              * ``letters`` - lowercase ASCII letters are used
                for a base 26 representation of the elements'
                positions in the list given by :meth:`list`,
                padded to a common width with leading 'a's.
              * ``digits`` - base 10 representation of the
                elements' positions in the list given by
                :meth:`~sage.matrix.operation_table.OperationTable.column_keys`,
                padded to a common width with leading zeros.
              * ``elements`` - the string representations
                of the elements themselves.
              * a list - a list of strings, where the length
                of the list equals the number of elements.

            - ``elements`` - default = ``None``.  A list of
              elements of the set.  This may be used to impose an
              alternate ordering on the elements, perhaps
              when this is used in the context of a particular structure.
              The default is to use whatever ordering is provided by the
              the group, which is reported by the 
              :meth:`~sage.matrix.operation_table.OperationTable.column_keys`
              method.  Or the ``elements`` can be a subset
              which is closed under the operation. In particular,
              this can be used when the base set is infinite.

I have figured out where this piece of code is. But, I don't follow what you mean when you say ``elements`` returns a list of string as opposed to actual elements. Here's what I tried: 

```
sage: G = CyclicPermutationGroup(4) 
sage: L = G.list()
[(), (1,2,3,4), (1,3)(2,4), (1,4,3,2)]
sage: L[2] * L[3] 
(1,2,3,4)
```
So, it does return a list of elements, not strings. 

> Don't hesitate to ask more, of course.  We like to make the curve as easy as possible to developing, though it could be even easier.

Thanks for offerring to help. 

Finally, you'd like that ``letters``, ``elements`` be changed to ``'letters'`` and ``'elements'``, right?

Sure.  But that's not what the keyword `elements` is referring to.  Try using that keyword and see what happens if you pass elements and not strings.

By the way, `{{{stuff`}}} is one way to mark up things that are code in these comments.  The [WikiFormatting](WikiFormatting) link you should see also will have lots of other help for that.

Here's what my Sage returns for this query: 

```
matrix/operation_table.py:39:      * ``'letters'`` - lowercase ASCII letters are used
matrix/operation_table.py:102:    The default symbol set for elements is lowercase ASCII letters,
matrix/operation_table.py:768:          * ``'letters'`` - lowercase ASCII letters are used
categories/groups.py:113:              * ``letters`` - lowercase ASCII letters are used
categories/magmas.py:151:              * ``letters`` - lowercase ASCII letters are used
categories/additive_magmas.py:123:              * ``letters`` - lowercase ASCII letters are used
categories/additive_magmas.py:158:            elements as lowercase ASCII letters.  ::
``` 

Clearly, the first and third have been fixed. And, the second is of irrelevant nature.  Similarly, the last one. And, the other two required fix. I have fixed it.

But that's not what the keyword `elements` is referring to.  Try using that keyword and see what happens if you pass elements and not strings.\n\nAlright, I think there is no real issue with this one. Well, what I mean is, since `(foo, bar)` stands for a tuple, having things like `(1,2)(3,4)` scares Sage. Reasonable.

> Sure.  But that's not what the keyword `elements` is referring to.  Try using that keyword and see what happens if you pass elements and not strings.

Alright, I think there is no real issue with this one. Well, what I mean is, since `(foo, bar)` stands for a tuple, having things like `(1,2)(3,4)` scares Sage. Reasonable. I looked at how its overcome in general: 

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(5)
sage: sigma = G("(1,3) (2,5,4)")
```
which is basically coercion at play. 
So, there are two work arounds: 
1. Pass the elements as strings, because after all the code coerces them into an element of the said group. *(done in the documentation)*
2. Or, suppose you have a group G. List its elements using `G.list()`. Now determine the indices which you'd like to include in the list and use a for loop to iterate. 

Here's a test case: 

```
sage: H = CyclicPermutationGroup(4)
sage: L = H.list()
sage: elts = [] 
sage: for i in {0, 2}: 
...      elts.append(L[i])
...
sage: elts
[(), (1,3) (2,4)] 
sage: from sage.matrix.operation_table import OperationTable
sage: T = OperationTable(H, operator.mul, elements = elts) 
sage: T
*  a b
 +----
a| a b
b| b a

```

So, does this solve the "thingy" issue? I will submit a patch for the other two OperationTable docs. And, should this alternative way of passing elements be documented?

Looking better!  Thanks for working with the often-multistep process.

A couple things:
* Very minor - you may want to name the patch after the ticket issue, like `trac_13209-cayley.patch` or something.  No biggie.
* Slightly less minor - the commit message is very long.  Try to have a short one first, then in the next lines more detail.  I think the limit is 88 characters or whatever the standard terminal window is.  I thought this was in the [developer guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/) but I can't find it...
* Same issue with the documentation changes.  They look good, but you made some lines too long.  Try to keep them the same length as the current lines.  This is a big enough deal to make it "needs work".
* Also, although you are probably right about the "able to be coerced" thing, it would be nice to make it explicit that strings work.  That is why I originally opened the ticket.  Maybe "such as strings" or something.  I know this is just my personal preference, but I think it's likely that it's a use case; people may not be able to easily get the exact elements they want for passing in in a given order (if it's a strange order) but it's easy to type those elements in, in which case they will need to be strings, like in one of the examples.
