Using:

* Sage 5.3.rc0 built with gcc 4.5.0 (i.e. NOT the gcc in Sage)
* Solaris 10 3/05 s10_74L2a SPARC
* Sun Blade 2000 with two 1200 MHz UltraSPARC III CPUs

```
File "/export/home/drkirkby/sage-5.3.rc0/devel/sage-main/sage/numerical/optimize.py", line 135:

  sage: find_local_maximum(fast_float(8*e^ (-x)*sin(x) - 1, x), 0, 8)^

Expected:

  (1.579175535558..., 0.78539817...)

Got:

  (1.5791755355586758, 0.78539816111340355)
```
Actually, the result returned on SPARC is more accurate in this instance, as according to Mathematica 7 at least,

```
In[3]:= FindMaximum[8 E^(-x) Sin[x] -1,{x,0,8},WorkingPrecision->50]

Out[3]= {1.5791755355586755940189354764810356787023224274029, 
 
>    {x -> 0.78539816339744830961566077712689095303902649201882}}

In[4]:= 
```
So on SPARC, the relative error is -2.91x10<sup>-9</sup> and the absolute error of -2.28x10<sup>-9</sup> So the test needs changing to '0.7853981...' rather than '0.78539817...'

I'll attach a patch later.

There is indeed another maximum, and the function will find it if the range is set from 7 to 8, rather than 0 to 8.

```
sage: find_local_maximum(fast_float(8*e^ (-x)*sin(x) - 1, x), 0, 8)
(1.5791755355586758, 0.78539816111340355)
sage: find_local_maximum(fast_float(8*e^ (-x)*sin(x) - 1, x), 7, 8)
(-0.9951835373923219, 7.0685835822289791)
```

So perhaps the test does need two changes.
