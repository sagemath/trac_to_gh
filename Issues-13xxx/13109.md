As discussed on https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/I12IeaFlE7g/discussion, change the deprecation function to the new arguments

```
deprecation(trac_number, message) 
```
where both arguments are mandatory.  Once this code is in Sage, one 
can deduce every possible thing discussed above in this thread from 
the trac number.   The deprecation warning can produce the URL of the 
trac ticket. 

Analogous changes are made to `deprecated_function_alias` and `deprecated_callable_import`. Finally, the `@rename_keyword(deprecated="sage version string", ...)` decorator is changed to

```
@rename_keyword(deprecation=<trac_number>, ...)
```

I just have to say it, please don't hurt me!

```

Definition:     sage.misc.misc.deprecation(message, version=None)
Docstring:
       Issue a deprecation warning.
    
       INPUT:
    
          * "message" - an explanation why things are deprecated and by
            what it
               should be replaced.
    
          * "version" - (optional) on which version and when the
            deprecation
               occurred. Please put there the version of sage at the time
               of deprecation.
```
That's incompatible with the current one, as far as I understand the ways optional args with defaults work.  So will the syntax for the deprecation function have to be ... deprecated?

Oops, removing that was a mistake.

One more thing; to make *sure* that this supersedes #8073, if we do keep Sage versions in, let's make sure to make it very very clear whether we are doing >= or >.  

Also, reading through the ticket number patch confirms my sense that Sage version is important; looking at something that says Sage version 4.3 (!!!) is far more revealing than Trac number so and so.

The :trac: markup shows nicely in the html reference. I've opened #13116 to properly render it on the commandline.

If you record the trac number then its == and there is no question about >= or >.

We should collect deprecated ticket numbers during doctest so we can list them. Then its easy to list the deprecations sorted by age, say. But this is for another ticket.

Simply not true.  You have

```
doctest:1: DeprecationWarning: 
```
but one needs an ellipsis, and this is standard in the tests I've seen.  Probably not always necessary, but good protocol.  

```
doctest:...: DeprecationWarning: 
```
In fact, you even change this in several of the tests in your patch.  

Also, I'm wondering why the tests pass in developer/conventions.rst when you don't use the `doctest:` at all.  Is that itself completely optional?  Now I'm confused.  

In fact, even putting in a blatant error in that file doesn't cause a problem in testing.  Do these even get tested?

Hi guys!

I love this new syntax; it's a great way to point to the right piece of information! I also appreciate the tremendous work you put into recovering the ticket number for all deprecation warnings in Sage.

However, I am deeply concerned by the fact that this patch touches so many files in Sage. It is going to create conflicts with many upcoming patches, including many in the Sage-Combinat queue. We are already having great trouble getting things in and this would waste a *lot* of good developpers time.

I thus would strongly recommend, if not request, that this change be made with a transition period where including a track ticket number is  mandatory for getting new/refactored code into Sage, but where old deprecation warnings could be left as is. Anyway, those deprecation warnings are doomed to progressively disapear by themselves; is it really worth refactoring them?

John: sorry for voicing this, ... well ... loudly, earlier today. Sorry also for not sumbling earlier on this ticket to give my view point before all the work is done.

Cheers,
                 Nicolas

Hi Nicolas,

How many conflicts do you actually get? The assumption is that deprecated code isn't under current development, so although we touch a lot of files we don't actually get many conflicts. 

Many deprecation warnings didn't even have a "since Sage version x" attached, so its doubtful that they will be removed over time.

We can add a stub old-style `sage.misc.misc.deprecation`, but I think that'll just delay the pain of updating the deprecations until later since nobody will be forced to switch.

Best,
Volker
