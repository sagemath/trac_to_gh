Some cleaning there, and some doc, ... and a way for me to define a default size for Graph plots, even if I am not allowed to hardcode it in Sage because of the notebook.

Here are the new lines in my init.sage file :

```
import sage.graphs.graph_plot
sage.graphs.graph_plot.default_show_options['figsize'] = 15
```

Hell Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh !! `:-P`

I think the option could be termed as `SHOW_OPTIONS` to keep the terminology compatible/similar with what is there in `sage.plot.graphics`.

Also, why did you decide to create another dictionary, when there is already `graphplot_options` available?

Really ? `O_o`
Upper case variables are so ugly...

Well, because the `graphplot_options` dictionary seems to associate text descriptions to keywords, while I want to associate actual values.

Btw, I will try to deal with the pictures of our Belgian evening in Singapour sooner or later `:-)`

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunn !

Yes, they are ugly. But this acts like a global variable in the file. Also *if* (and that's a big *if*, looking at my near future) I get time, I will try to clean up some of the options in plots (#13828), so I would prefer there are less inconsistencies introduced in new patches! :)

Whoops! Of course! That was so silly of me.

Patch updated ! As for the bug, it's yet another combinat side-effect `>_<`

The decorator added a dictionary of default options to all graphs, and some code in this file modifies the dictionary so that *THIS* graph will be well displayed.

Vincent : it seems to come from your patch #11422. How do you propose that we fix this ?

Hi Nathann,

> Vincent : it seems to come from your patch #11422. How do you propose that we fix this ?

In the method in Arithgroup.coset_graph() I create a graph and modify the option dictionnary in order that color_by_label is True by default. The reason is that I want a nice picture with

```
sage: G = ArithmeticSubgroup_Permutation(S2="(1,2)(3,4)",S3="(1,2,3)")                
sage: G.coset_graph().show()
```

If you provide another way to initialize the default options to plot/show, just tell me and I can do it or do it yourself. Otherwise, remove the annoying line in ArithmeticSubgroup_Permutation.

Cheers,
Vincent

Well, I guess that can be easily solved this way : would the "options" decorator work if you used it with empty parameters ? Something like that :

```
@options()
def plot ....
```

This way the dictionary of default arguments would be empty unless you fill it manually, and as a result the general default options from this patch would be used.

This being said, this `@`options decorator has to be mentionned in the documentation of every function to which it is applied. Could you write an explanation of what it does and how it is to be used ? This doc should appear in sage/misc/decorators, toward which the doc of all functions using `@`option should point so that users know that this feature exists, and how it is to be used.

Attachment: **[trac_13891.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13891/trac_13891.patch.gz)**

I tested the patch. All tests passed. Documentation builds fine. The intended behavior works well for me. Although, here are some remarks below. Mainly, I believe it should be better documented in the doc string of plot and show methods. I also added some questions...

1. In the documentation of `plot` method, I do not understand this:

```
- Default parameters for this method can also be set through the 
  :class:`~sage.misc.decorators.options` mechanism. 
```

Can you provide an example instead? like:

```
  
  EXAMPLE:

  Default parameters for this method can also be set through the 
  :class:`~sage.misc.decorators.options` mechanism::

      sage: how_should_I_use_the_decoration_mechanism() 
```

2. Same comment for `show` method. I prefer to see an example in the doc which illustrates the utilisation of this default parameters.

3. Add example in both `plot` and `show` like this one:

```

Create a graph and show it::

    sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
    sage: g.show()

Change default options for all graphs::

    sage: sage.graphs.graph_plot.DEFAULT_PLOT_OPTIONS['edge_color']='red'

Now edges of all graphs are red::

    sage: g.show()
    sage: g = Graph({3:[4,5]})
    sage: g.show()

```

4. `dictinary` still appears

**The following point are just questions...**

A. Somebody can explain me what is the specification differences between `show` and `plot`?

B. Why do you remove the element from the kwds? Is there some efficiency gain?

```
14511	        # This dictinary only contains the options that graphplot 
14512	        # understands. These options are removed from kwds at the same 
14513	        # time. 
14514	        plot_kwds = {k:kwds.pop(k) for k in graphplot_options if k in kwds} 
```

C. Should not `{}` be the default ? In genereal, this should be a dict. I guess None is fine.

```
"edge_colors"         : None, 
```

D. What is this?

```

For me, I think the confusion comes from the fact that using plot actually opens the png. I like it if plot returns the Graphics object without opening any png and show returning None and openning the png.

Thanks for your answers!

I will continue my review (on sage-5.6.rc0 the patch applies fine) and let you check the other SHOW_OPTIONS thing.

One more point. This does not affect the result of plot:

```
sage: import sage.graphs.graph_plot
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: sage.graphs.graph_plot.DEFAULT_SHOW_OPTIONS['figsize'] = 20
sage: g.plot()
sage: sage.graphs.graph_plot.DEFAULT_SHOW_OPTIONS['figsize'] = 2
sage: g.plot()
```

One may say it is because I should use `DEFAULT_PLOT_OPTIONS` instead. But it is not the case. As the following is not affected by changing `DEFAULT_PLOT_OPTIONS` :

```
sage: import sage.graphs.graph_plot
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: sage.graphs.graph_plot.DEFAULT_PLOT_OPTIONS['figsize'] = 2
sage: g.plot()
sage: sage.graphs.graph_plot.DEFAULT_PLOT_OPTIONS['figsize'] = 20
sage: g.plot()
```

Hence, I believe the documentation at the start of the file `graph_plot.py` should contain at least one example using `DEFAULT_PLOT_OPTIONS` and one example using `DEFAULT_SHOW_OPTIONS`. As a user I want to understand why there are two such dict and which one I should use.

Hellooooooooo Sebastien !

I can now answer your many comments, and write down what we said orally across the table `:-)`

1/2) I fixed this doc, but only where it is related to what this ticket implements, and not related to the `"@options"` decorator. This has to be documented where the decorator is defined, not in these files.

3) There is a link from the documentation of show toward graph_plot 

4) Fixed

D) Because I want those two methods to appear in the doc, even if they begin with a `_`

What this new patch does :

1) It changes the documentation of GraphPlot so that the list of admissible keywords appear only once, and in the documentation.
2) The GraphPlot.plot() method accepts any options, and ignores them. I remove the `**kwds` in its definition, and remove the long description of its possible parameters
3) I remove two default arguments of Poset.plot() which were ignored
4) There's a dprecation warning when a wrong keyword is used

Tell me what you think of it !

Great for the second patch. I like the improvements in the documentation. However, here are some issues:

1. The following used to work, but is broken by the actual patches. A deprecation warning is needed :

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: p = g.graphplot()
sage: p.plot(my_favorite_useless_option_I_always_used_in_my_code=45)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: plot() got an unexpected keyword argument 'my_favorite_useless_option_I_have_used_in_my_code'
```

2. (Suggestion) I don't know of another way of sending warning to the user, but in our case it is not really a deprecation warning. Because for instance `'scaling_term'` was used as an argument by some code and was not used if I understand correctly. Hence, there will be no deprecation as it was not used and will still be unused. Therefore, I suggest to improve the message like this:

```diff
 from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation 
-deprecation(13891, (str(opt)+" is not a registered argument for"+ 
-   	                     "GraphPlot ! Please tell us that if it "+ 
-    	                     "should be by writing to sage-devel !")) 
+deprecation(13891, (str(opt)+" is not a registered argument for "
+   	                     "GraphPlot and never was! Please tell us that if it "
+    	                     "should be by writing to sage-devel ! "
+                            "In a future version of Sage, it might raise "
+                            "an error instead so you should fix it."))
```

3. (Remark) BTW, the `+` are not necessary above. For instance:

```
sage: ('first  line'
....:      'second line\n'
....:    'third line')
'first  linesecond line\nthird line'
```

4. There are some errors reported by the buildbot:

1. There is a doctest error

    sage: list(sorted(layout_options.iteritems()))

I saw a few more documentation problems that are a leftover from your earlier patches. Noticing this only now - sorry `:-/`
The following should be `GenericGraph.graphplot` since plot doesn't take any options now.

```
29	Here is the list of options accepted by :meth:`GraphPlot.plot` and the

79	This module defines two dictionaries containing default options for the
80	:meth:`~GraphPlot.plot` and :meth:`~GraphPlot.show` methods. These two 

29	This module defines two dictionaries containing default options for the 
30	:meth:`~GraphPlot.plot` and :meth:`~GraphPlot.show` methods. Obviously, these 
```

Shouldn't this be changed now? Now, graph.plot() doesn't take anything.

```
    def graphplot(self, **options):
        """
        Returns a GraphPlot object.

        EXAMPLES:

        Creating a graphplot object uses the same options as graph.plot()::
```
Maybe write it like this?

```
    def graphplot(self, **options):
        """
        Returns a GraphPlot object.

        See :mod:`the documentation of the graph_plot module<sage.graphs.graph_plot>` for

Hellooooooooooo !!!

Well, why is there a graphplot() method in graphs anyway ? .graphplot and .plot seem to do the same. Shouldn't we remove one of them ?

I am actually in favor of this (actually `plot = graphplot`). Just make this alias so that current stuff doesn't break. Moreover, it will still remain consistent with the other commands and with the `plot` command from `sage.plot`.

If you remove graphplot, you should revert all the warnings and deprecation that was introduced in plot. As of now, I would say, keep both and make `plot = graphplot`.

I hate having the graph files stuffed with useless stuff that we keep to prevent two guys in the world from having to do a google search.

I will just have to change the calls to graphplot to plot.

Tell me if there is anything wrong with that. If you think that it is fine I will begin fixing the doctests.

What do you mean ?

Why ? plot does not call graphplot !

> As of now, I would say, keep both and make `plot = graphplot`.

Hey, I just noticed that .graphplot and .plot just do not do the same thing.

graphplot :

```
return GraphPlot(graph=self, options=options)
```

plot :

```
return GraphPlot(graph=self, options=options).plot()
```

So it does not really make sense to deprecate one by making it an alias to the other one !

The question is : do we need a graphplot method, and what for (knowing that it takes two lines to create the graphplot object from the graph) ? If we do then it stays, if we don't we remove it, or add whatever deprecation warning you may want, but we can't make it an alias of anything.

Thanks. This is a huge mess.

I understand why the plot method is needed. If you look at the code for `plot(f)` (the generic plot function) then, it returns the output `f.plot()` method if it is present. I think the current patch is OK. I also think slabbe is right in [comment:41](#comment%3A41).

1. show method of a graph doesn't do anything now. There is a line missing in the code.

2. 2 doctests are still failing (see [Comment 42](#comment%3A42))

**Questions.**

A. Sorry to ask this question, but why is figsize not an option for `plot` again?

B. If I understand correctly,

   - `DEFAULT_SHOW_OPTIONS` will affect `g.show()`.
   - `DEFAULT_PLOT_OPTIONS` will affect `g.plot()`.

   but

   - `DEFAULT_SHOW_OPTIONS` will not affect `g.plot()`.
   - `DEFAULT_PLOT_OPTIONS` will affect `g.show()`.

   Right?

**Comments.**

C. This works:

```
    sage: sage.graphs.graph_plot.DEFAULT_PLOT_OPTIONS['edge_color']='red'
    sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
    sage: g.plot()  # red edges
    sage: g.show()  # does not show anything
    sage: g = Graph({3:[4,5]})
    sage: g.plot()  # red edges
    sage: g.show()  # does not show anything
```

D. This is now ok:

```
   sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
   sage: p = g.graphplot()
   sage: p.plot(my_favorite_useless_option_I_always_used_in_my_code=45)
   /Users/slabbe/Applications/sage-5.6.rc0/local/bin/sage-ipython:1: DeprecationWarning: This method takes no argument ! You may want to give it as an argument to graphplot instead.

Soooooooooooo !

I just refolded them all to check where the missing line in `G.show()` was coming from, to notice that I stupidly removed it myself in the "fourth pass". Well.

* [attachment: trac_13891-fourth_pass.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13891/trac_13891-fourth_pass.patch.gz) is left unchanged, even if what it does is stupid
* [attachment: trac_13891-fifth_pass.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13891/trac_13891-fifth_pass.patch.gz) fixes it, and also applies Punarbasu's modification
* [attachment: trac_13891-bugfix.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13891/trac_13891-bugfix.patch.gz) removes the useless option in the combinat/ directory.

And of course [attachment: trac_13891-all_in_one.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13891/trac_13891-all_in_one.patch.gz) applies all that. Now, to answer Sebastian's questions :

1) Fixed in [attachment: trac_13891-fifth_pass.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13891/trac_13891-fifth_pass.patch.gz), sorry for that, good job noticing it as no doctest checks that `:-P`
2) Fixed in [attachment: trac_13891-bugfix.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13891/trac_13891-bugfix.patch.gz)
A) Noooooo idea on earth.
B) Yep. Because basically, `show` calls `plot`.

Well, if you like it, this "small patch that defines new default options" can go `:-P`

Thanks for your help !!!

About A - the reason is that figsize is a property that is handled by matplotlib. 
It is only the show method that actually calls matplotlib.
The plot method just prepares the set of points that are going to be on the figure and that will eventually be passed on to matplotlib.

So if somebody uses `show_default(True)` which is the actual default, then `show` is automatically called (with no option) when `plot` is called, and there is no way of changing the `figsize` through the `plot` method. Right? This is the kind of thing that made plot and show mysterious to me when I started using sage. Now, I am starting to understand!

Attachment: **[trac_13891_note-sl.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13891/trac_13891_note-sl.patch.gz)**

1. I just added a patch which adds the notes about what dict affect what function. Do you agree to fold it into yours?

2. Another question (it should be my last now!!): What are the available options for `show` or for `DEFAULT_SHOW_OPTIONS` ?

To know available options for `plot`, I may look at the keywords of the default dict. I think they are complete right?

```
sage: sage.graphs.graph_plot.DEFAULT_PLOT_OPTIONS.keys()
['edge_color', 'tree_orientation', 'layout', 'vertex_labels', 'max_dist', 
'partition', 'loop_size', 'heights', 'color_by_label', 'dist', 'graph_border', 
'iterations', 'edge_colors', 'edge_style', 'edge_labels', 'vertex_size','talk']
```

or at the following docstring :

```
sage: g.plot?  # they do not corresponds exactly with the defaut dict, but it is not too bad
```

But, for show, it seems more difficult to know the possible options. The keywords of the default dict contain only one :

```
sage: sage.graphs.graph_plot.DEFAULT_SHOW_OPTIONS.keys()
['figsize']
```

and the docstring of `show` does not say much about those options "not used by plot" :

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()   
sage: g.show?
Docstring:                                                                        
       Shows the (di)graph.                                                       
                                                                                  
       For syntax and lengthy documentation, see G.plot?. Any options not         
       used by plot will be passed on to the Graphics.show method.                
                                                                                  
       Note: See the documentation of the "sage.graphs.graph_plot" module for     
         information on default arguments of this method.                         
                                                                                  
       EXAMPLES:                                                                  
                                                                                  
          sage: C = graphs.CubeGraph(8)                                           
          sage: P = C.plot(vertex_labels=False, vertex_size=0, graph_border=True) 
          sage: P.show()  # long time (3s on sage.math, 2011)
```

Could we add a sentence in the above show docstring explaining where we can find what are the possible options for show accepted by matplotlib?

This has annoyed the hell out of me about 100 times in the last month:

```

I strongly disagree with this deprecation.  It is an extremely useful feature that the plotting functions hold their arguments, then pass the unused arguments on to show, just like the do (by design!) in 3d graphics, and did do (by design!) for many years in 2d graphics.

Your turn. Silently ignored arguments annoyed the hell out of me for a while too. I had no idea why nothing happened.

I agree we should never deprecate it as I guess so much code are using useless arguments out there. Maybe the "DeprecationWarning" was not well chosen, just a "Warning" would have been ok without mentionning any future deprecation. So, what annoyed you in fact? The deprecation? or the warning that was printed 100 times?

On my side, I would be happy to learn that the input I am giving to a function is just totally ignored. Why? Because this is just normal Python I am used to (we can also think of a mispell argument written by dyslexicy) :

```
sage: def f(a,b): return a+b
sage: f(4,5)
9
sage: f(4,5,color='blue')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-15-d3f7a3aa970a> in <module>()
----> 1 f(Integer(4),Integer(5),color='blue')

TypeError: f() got an unexpected keyword argument 'color'

I agree that options should not be ignored silently - so in that sense I agree with Nathann.

On the other hand, it seems that some other plot functions silently pass on their options to the show() method. I think something similar should be done here. I have opened #14632 to track this.

I also agree that options should not be completely ignored silently.  I want them to be passed on to the show command, which would then complain if the options are invalid.

Looking now, I see that I agree with what you propose there.
