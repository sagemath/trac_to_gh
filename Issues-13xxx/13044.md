Added the patch to the spkg.  It applies to the current version of the spkg with a bit of fuzz.  

If I understand correctly I should also update the patch version, and upload a new source package? Not sure exactly how to go about that though.

In this exceptional case I think it's not needed because there is no reason to rebuild everybody's ECL with this patch. And in the cases where ECL didn't install before, there is no **re**build needed since there couldn't have been a build in the first place.

> and upload a new source package?

No, because you are not changing the source tarball, just adding a patch.

Building with `CC="ccache cc" CXX="ccache c++"` now works.

I cleaned up the packaging and build of ECL. In particular, I separated the patches which need to be applied by `spkg-src` from the ones which are applied at build-time. This part still needs to be reviewed.
