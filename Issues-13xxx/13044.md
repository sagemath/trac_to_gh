I can confirm this is still an issue--sage build breaks on ecl when `CC=ccache gcc`--obviously this can be worked around easily enough, but setting `CC` like that is not uncommon either, and only seems to be a problem with ecl.

Would this be worth patching in ecl (both upstream and in sage)?

Added the patch to the spkg.  It applies to the current version of the spkg with a bit of fuzz.  

If I understand correctly I should also update the patch version, and upload a new source package? Not sure exactly how to go about that though.

In this exceptional case I think it's not needed because there is no reason to rebuild everybody's ECL with this patch. And in the cases where ECL didn't install before, there is no **re**build needed since there couldn't have been a build in the first place.

> and upload a new source package?

No, because you are not changing the source tarball, just adding a patch.
