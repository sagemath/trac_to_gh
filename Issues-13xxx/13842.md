hi.  with #11795 installed, misconfiguring the, e.g., PNG viewer causes a plot to fail silently.

```python
import sage.misc.viewer
viewer.png_viewer('/x/y/display')
circle((0,0), 1, rgbcolor=(1,1,0))
```

note the "e.g." above.  the same thing happens for PDF and DVI files.  browser, on the other hand, reports an error:

```
sage: viewer.browser('/x/y/w3m')
sage: tutorial()
/Users/buildsage/src/import/sage/sage-5.4.1/local/bin/sage-native-execute: line 8: /x/y/w3m: No such file or directory
```

on the mailing list, Ivan Andrus commented thus:

(ps -- let me know about formatting, tagging, etc., mistakes i may have made.)

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
The file sage/misc/viewer.py passes all the doctests precisely because it does not care whether the commands that are being doctested are actually present in the system. I tried adding a check and then almost everything fails.

How should I go about adding the test for a command then? Introduce a new keyword to the `Viewer._set()` method called `check_command=True`?

To add a test use `sage.doctest.DOCTEST_MODE` in the code to avoid user settings, as in for example `sage/misc/hg.py` or `sage/plot/animate.py`.
