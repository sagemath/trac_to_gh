Looks good on OSX 10.6.8 and Sage 5.2.beta1 with #10508 applied.
I tried both lapack/blas, the ones from Apple, and the ones from Atlas 3.10 from  #10508, with `SAGE_CHECK` on.

By the way, shouldn't #10508 be a dependence of this ticket? (I added it here, tentatively.)

Also, I wonder if there is anything to report upstream here.

Shouldn't it install docs by default? (Currently, you need to set `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS`)

Also, I don't understand what you mean by "dependence" on sphinx. Isn't sphinx included in Sage?

Yes sphinx is shipped with sage but if this spkg uses sphinx it has to be listed as one of its dependencies in spkg/standard/deps. In this particular case it is probably ok because cvxopt can be build after sage I think. But in the alternative there are problems as far as I remember from a previous upgrade of numpy way back.

I didn't remember how the discussion had ended. Probably because I wasn't on the follow up ticket where things were discussed. Should I remove the section about documentation until one day we sort this out?

We should note that some packages already put their doc in $SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc:

```

```
I am not even sure those obey SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS and some are html. The cvxopt spkg linked in this ticket doesn't need sphinx because the doc is prebuilt in the tarball.

There are leftovers of debugging in src/src/C/blas.c, starting from line 295, which reads

```
    printf("scal\n");
```

This is very strange.

EDIT: I checked the upstream, and they don't have these printfs...

Moreover, the upstream files base.c, blas.c, and sparse.c in src/src/C have earlier dates (and different sizes) than the ones in spkg.
And replacing the spkg files by upstream files makes the package seemingly work on OSX10.6.8. I didn't test much, but the file `src/examples/doc/chap10/l1svc.py` which gives me crashes with the spkg, works OK with the upstream replacement.

On Fedora 17 x86_64:

```
building 'gsl' extension

C/gsl.c:28:25: fatal error: gsl/gsl_rng.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
```
The header is in Sage but the include path is wrong:

```
[vbraun@laptop sage-5.2]$ find | grep gsl_rng
./local/include/gsl/gsl_rng.h
```
The fix is to set If I edit `GSL_INC_DIR = SAGE_INCLUDE` in `setup.py`, and not `SAGE_INCLUDE/gsl`.

I've updated the spkg (see description, only change is the `GSL_INC_DIR`) and it builds for me now.

From the sage shell can you check the output of 

```
otool -L local/lib/python/site-packages/cvxopt/blas.so
```
It should tell you against which library it was linked in some form.
