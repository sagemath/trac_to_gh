Looks good on OSX 10.6.8 and Sage 5.2.beta1 with #10508 applied.
I tried both lapack/blas, the ones from Apple, and the ones from Atlas 3.10 from  #10508, with `SAGE_CHECK` on.

By the way, shouldn't #10508 be a dependence of this ticket? (I added it here, tentatively.)

Also, I wonder if there is anything to report upstream here.

When you closed #10509 you said it is fixed by atlas-3.10.0 spkg. And #10508 is the one the provides atlas-3.10.0 spkg.

Shouldn't it install docs by default? (Currently, you need to set `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS`)

Also, I don't understand what you mean by "dependence" on sphinx. Isn't sphinx included in Sage?

Yes sphinx is shipped with sage but if this spkg uses sphinx it has to be listed as one of its dependencies in spkg/standard/deps. In this particular case it is probably ok because cvxopt can be build after sage I think. But in the alternative there are problems as far as I remember from a previous upgrade of numpy way back.

I didn't remember how the discussion had ended. Probably because I wasn't on the follow up ticket where things were discussed. Should I remove the section about documentation until one day we sort this out?

We should note that some packages already put their doc in $SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc:

I am not even sure those obey SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS and some are html. The cvxopt spkg linked in this ticket doesn't need sphinx because the doc is prebuilt in the tarball.

Can do that but I don't think it will be much different from the one shipped. The first thing that sphinx does when it is run is check whether what is already built is up to date. Rebuilding it again is just a waste of cpu cycles.

I don't really care about it that much myself. So if people are quite happy about rebuilding the doc I'll just remove the pre build from the spkg to save space and produce the other needed patch.

There are leftovers of debugging in src/src/C/blas.c, starting from line 295, which reads

```
    printf("scal\n");
```

This is very strange.

EDIT: I checked the upstream, and they don't have these printfs...

Moreover, the upstream files base.c, blas.c, and sparse.c in src/src/C have earlier dates (and different sizes) than the ones in spkg.
And replacing the spkg files by upstream files makes the package seemingly work on OSX10.6.8. I didn't test much, but the file `src/examples/doc/chap10/l1svc.py` which gives me crashes with the spkg, works OK with the upstream replacement.

compilation terminated.
```
The header is in Sage but the include path is wrong:

```
[vbraun@laptop sage-5.2]$ find | grep gsl_rng
./local/include/gsl/gsl_rng.h
```
The fix is to set If I edit `GSL_INC_DIR = SAGE_INCLUDE` in `setup.py`, and not `SAGE_INCLUDE/gsl`.

I've updated the spkg (see description, only change is the `GSL_INC_DIR`) and it builds for me now.

From what I put in the spkg cvxopt will use the OS X accelerate framework instead of ATLAS. You should note that it is not the only spkg for which it will be the case. linbox will do that as well for example. iml also comes to mind as well and numpy and scipy should be checked.
From the sage shell can you check the output of 

```
otool -L local/lib/python/site-packages/cvxopt/blas.so
```
It should tell you against which library it was linked in some form.
