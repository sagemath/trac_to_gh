Assignee: @jasongrout

* TABs in Makefiles are needed, so keep them.
* Some TABs not used for indentation are also kept.
* TABs in the obsolete directory `devel/sage/sage/server/notebook` (#11409) are not fixed.
* The directory `sage/graphs/planarity_c` uses a very inconsistent indentation scheme (mixing spaces and TABs and having varying amounts of indentation) is hopeless to easily fix automatically.
* Also, make indentation consistent and/or remove trailing spaces in some places.

The release manager script has been updated to check all new patches for added TAB indentation.

Apply:
* [attachment:13899_TAB_sage_root.patch] to the root repository
* [attachment:13899_TAB_sagelib.patch] and [attachment:13899_doctest.patch] to the Sage library
* [attachment:13899_TAB_scripts.patch] to the scripts repository

This patch needs some work.   At least you should remove the remaining reference(s?) to `cdd_convert`.  Also, I'm a little surprised that you indented the last two examples by one more - shouldn't they be exactly four spaces from the start of the colon (I mean that column)?  I'm not sure why some of the doc has three spaces to the colon and then four more, but I've seen it before.  I assume the links for `tmp_dir` and `tmp_filename` work fine?

Good point.  But in that case should they just be

```
`tmp_dir`
```
instead of

```
:func:`tmp_dir`

Scratch that - I see what happened, Jeroen introduced the problem in his previous patch and then fixed it.  Now I have to wait for all those Cython files to rebuild to check how nice the developer guide looks... one moment.

Apart from the changes to `conventions.rst`, this patch is only about touching files for beauty's sake.  Given that #12719 is already rebased to this ticket, unmerging would be unwise. It seems that #12719 (which is a **huge** patch) conflicts with this in only one hunk, for a file which is removed in its totality.

So it's not a total disaster and it's not contradictory to leif's and my idea that these patches only touch rarely-edited files (except `conventions.rst` but that file really needed to be fixed).

Just checked, and as far as I can see, the only offending patch here was removing an empty line from a file that #12719 removes in its entirety.  So I wouldn't say we broke much here, at least until now...
