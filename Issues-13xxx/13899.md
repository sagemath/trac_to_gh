* TABs in Makefiles are needed, so keep them.
* Some TABs not used for indentation are also kept.
* TABs in the obsolete directory `devel/sage/sage/server/notebook` (#11409) are not fixed.
* The directory `sage/graphs/planarity_c` uses a very inconsistent indentation scheme (mixing spaces and TABs and having varying amounts of indentation) is hopeless to easily fix automatically.
* Also, make indentation consistent and/or remove trailing spaces in some places.

The release manager script has been updated to check all new patches for added TAB indentation.

Apply:
* [attachment:13899_TAB_sage_root.patch] to the root repository
* [attachment:13899_TAB_sagelib.patch] and [attachment:13899_doctest.patch] to the Sage library
* [attachment:13899_TAB_scripts.patch] to the scripts repository

Good point.  But in that case should they just be

```
`tmp_dir`
```
instead of

```
:func:`tmp_dir`

<a id='comment:30'></a>For the record, I would be +1 on reverting the parts of this patch that are touching lots of files for beauty's sake only (like removing trailing whitespace).  Large rebasing of tickets like #12719 could easily introduce subtle code errors, and not forcing those changes should take priority over end-of-line spacing.

Apart from the changes to `conventions.rst`, this patch is only about touching files for beauty's sake.  Given that #12719 is already rebased to this ticket, unmerging would be unwise. It seems that #12719 (which is a **huge** patch) conflicts with this in only one hunk, for a file which is removed in its totality.

So it's not a total disaster and it's not contradictory to leif's and my idea that these patches only touch rarely-edited files (except `conventions.rst` but that file really needed to be fixed).

Just checked, and as far as I can see, the only offending patch here was removing an empty line from a file that #12719 removes in its entirety.  So I wouldn't say we broke much here, at least until now...

In general, patches IMHO shouldn't touch parts they don't have to (i.e., only doing some reformatting there), which we agreed on IIRC.  But in this case, the *purpose of the ticket* is to remove tabs (and "normalize" code -- once and for all -- hopefully), so it does *not* touch code it doesn't have to...
