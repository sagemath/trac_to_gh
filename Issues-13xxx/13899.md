* TABs in Makefiles are needed, so keep them.
* Some TABs not used for indentation are also kept.
* TABs in the obsolete directory `devel/sage/sage/server/notebook` (#11409) are not fixed.
* The directory `sage/graphs/planarity_c` uses a very inconsistent indentation scheme (mixing spaces and TABs and having varying amounts of indentation) is hopeless to easily fix automatically.
* Also, make indentation consistent and/or remove trailing spaces in some places.

The release manager script has been updated to check all new patches for added TAB indentation.

Patches look sane (yes, I've read the whole Sage library patch!), haven't tried to apply them yet though.

Other than removing trailing whitespace (and removing useless backslashes at the end of a few lines), I don't see much value in touching the C/C++ and HTML files.  In particular, removing tabs that introduce end-of-line comments (in the C/C++ files) is rather counter-productive.

Not sure whether you planned to add further patches here; just noticed it was still "new".

Patches apply to Sage 5.6.beta1, doc builds...  (The Sage library patch btw. triggers the rebuild of half of the Sage library.)

Haven't reviewed the merger script though.

At least you should remove the remaining reference(s?) to `cdd_convert`.  Also, I'm a little surprised that you indented the last two examples by one more - shouldn't they be exactly four spaces from the start of the colon (I mean that column)?

> The Sage library patch [attachment: 13899_doctest.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13899/13899_doctest.patch.gz) needs review.

This patch needs some work.   At least you should remove the remaining reference(s?) to `cdd_convert`.  Also, I'm a little surprised that you indented the last two examples by one more - shouldn't they be exactly four spaces from the start of the colon (I mean that column)?  I'm not sure why some of the doc has three spaces to the colon and then four more, but I've seen it before.  I assume the links for `tmp_dir` and `tmp_filename` work fine?

No they don't, but I think links between two different manuals (in this case, from the developer manual to the reference manual) are not supported.

Good point.  But in that case should they just be

```
`tmp_dir`
```
instead of

```
:func:`tmp_dir`
```

Apart from the changes to `conventions.rst`, this patch is only about touching files for beauty's sake.  Given that #12719 is already rebased to this ticket, unmerging would be unwise. It seems that #12719 (which is a **huge** patch) conflicts with this in only one hunk, for a file which is removed in its totality.

So it's not a total disaster and it's not contradictory to leif's and my idea that these patches only touch rarely-edited files (except `conventions.rst` but that file really needed to be fixed).

Just checked, and as far as I can see, the only offending patch here was removing an empty line from a file that #12719 removes in its entirety.  So I wouldn't say we broke much here, at least until now...

In general, patches IMHO shouldn't touch parts they don't have to (i.e., only doing some reformatting there), which we agreed on IIRC.  But in this case, the *purpose of the ticket* is to remove tabs (and "normalize" code -- once and for all -- hopefully), so it does *not* touch code it doesn't have to...

Automatically enforcing code style is nice but should only be done though local commit hooks. Having a check in Jeroen's release script is BS, that just adds a completely avoidable multi-week ping-pong game when trying to merge a ticket.

In any case this ticket is done so lets leave it at that. But please post to sage-devel next time so we can talk you out of it ;-)
