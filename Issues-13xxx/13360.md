I've been struggling with some unexpected results in my computations with polynomials over the symbolic ring. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that it should not be possible to *coerce* polynomials to the symbolic ring. (Note: I'm not saying that you can't *convert* to the symbolic ring!) Here's some reasons for disallowing it.

I've also attached an initial patch implementing this. It needs more work though, because the same thing holds for `LaurentSeries` and `PowerSeries`.


Reasons for not allowing PolynomialRing -> SR coercion:

1) This inconsistency:

```
  sage: R.<t> = QQ[]
  sage: SR(t^2)
  t^2
  sage: R.<t> = SR[]
  sage: SR(t^2)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  TypeError: not a constant polynomial
```
  I think the first one should raise a TypeError, too.

2) This one:

```
  sage: R.<t> = ZZ[]
  sage: (t + 1/2).parent()      # automatic base extension
  Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
  sage: R.<t> = ZZ[]
  sage: (t + pi).parent()   # expect base extension SR[t]
  Symbolic Ring
```
  It is not hard to imagine that this gives all kinds of unexpected results when trying to manipulate these kind of rings programmatically. This must have cost me days and days.

3) There is also a better way to convert a polynomial to the symbolic ring,
namely just substituting a symbolic variable:

```
sage: R.<t> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,'t')
sage: f = t^2 - t
sage: t = var('t')
sage: f(t)
(t - 1)*t
sage: f(t).parent()
Symbolic Ring
```
This has the advantage that the conversion is explicit.

4) Philosophically, I would say that the name of the variable is just a display label, but as it is, it has the side effect of determining what variable to coerce to. Then if you want to return a polynomial from a library routine, you can't be sure that it won't collide with a user-defined variable upon coercion.

Replying to [@nbruin](#comment:3):

Thanks for commenting, nbruin! Yes I agree (I actually mention that in italics right at the top).

> 
> ```

> B.<b>=A[]

I would suggest replacing this with

```
sage: a,b=var('a,b')
sage: f(a,b)
```
Which relates to ...
> Even though there is an explicit conversion asked, I think the system uses coercion on the coefficients of f, which are elements of the polynomial ring A. The same thing applies even more essentially to evaluating f at a symbolic expression.

I'm glad you mention this example. For me, this is not the same thing. In a way, it is *exactly* the distinction I'm trying to make with this ticket. I think your example should be allowed whereas coercion shouldn't.

> For your other examples:
>

The sage documentation explicitly states that this is supported (at least in the case of the `PowerSeriesRing`).

As for it not being useful, I strongly disagree with that. As soon as you need coefficients like pi or sin(3), this is the only way to go. For example, to come back to your code:

```
sage: A.<a>=QQ[]
sage: B.<b>=A[]
sage: f=a^2*b+a*b^2
sage: f(b=pi)      # would expect an expansion in a, like pi*a^2 + pi^2*a
(pi*a = a^2)*pi
sage: f(b=pi).parent()   # I would expect: SR[a]
Symbolic Ring
```
Or, for a more specialized example: I'm doing calculations with Lax matrices in integrable systems. Then you want to calculate Laurent series in the spectral parameter, whereas all other variables are manipulated symbolically (i.e. functions can be applied to them). Just doing those calculations in the symbolic ring is much slower, you would need to collect and expand all the time, and the symbolic ring cannot keep track of big ohs.

Of course, this ticket is exactly about inconsistencies arising from polynomial rings over SR. If you believe those should raise an error already, than it is logical to say that that is the source of the inconsistency. If, like me, you believe that it is very useful, then you open a ticket like this one. :-)

Similarly, elements from `QQ['x']` coerce into `QQ['x','y']` but not into `QQ['a','b']`. Coercing by name into SR is completely in step with that, whatever collisions that causes.

I think this is unfortunate, but I agree that the philosophy is in line with this.

A solution like this would need an expert in the coercion system to implement correctly, because the coercion system is one area of sage where a small and seemingly innocuous change can easily have huge consequences (for performance, correctness or both) for the entire system.

Roughly: if R.coerce_map_from(SR) is not None then SR.coerce_map_from(R['a',...]) should be None. I think that would remove most of the unexpected results.

Polynomials with coefficients in SR are very useful and it is a pity that their support is not ideal - hopefully it will improve.

I do not agree that construction in 1) should give errors: as it is written, it is explicit conversion of a polynomial to the symbolic ring and I was annoyed by `TypeError: not a constant polynomial` recently, having to write `SR(str(f))`.

How about

```
R=SR['t']
f=SR('t') * R.0
```
It's much better if `SR(f)` gives an error for that. The error you're seeing is the failure of a non-constant polynomial to be converted to an element of its base ring, as expected. Really, what you're looking for is a "specialization" of your polynomial, effected by an evaluation:

```
f(SR('t'))
```
No reason to convert to strings.

Polynomial rings should really not be coercible to their base rings, and probably also not generally convertible to them (apart from constants). Sage's concept of coercion really relies on there not being "loops" in the coercion graph. They wreak havoc with finding common covering structures.

There is a transcendental in `SR` with the print name `t`, so that is a natural image for `t` the polynomial variable over `ZZ`. So both `t` and `sqrt(2)` fit in `SR`, so that's where the answer lives.

For your application, it seems that you would like to restrict `SR` to what one would consider constants in calculus, such as `sin(2)` etc. A kind of transcendental version of QQbar. The problem is that `SR` is not such a ring. It also contains all kinds of non-constant transcendentals. In fact, it would normally appear that SR contains all constructible transcendentals (for the right meaning of constructible).

That's where `SR['T']` is special: You are clearly asking for a transcendental that doesn't lie in `SR`.
As you remark, sage already (justly) recognizes that by not allowing coercion of `T` into `SR`. So in my opinion sage already has exactly the right support for such rings.

For that user, however, it really makes no big difference whether the result is in `SR` or in `SR[t]`: it is just as possible to plot, evaluate, etc, elements of `SR[t]` w.r.t. to `t` as it is for elements of `SR`. I will concede that there may come a point when it will surprise them, though.

> For your application, it seems that you would like to restrict `SR` to what one would consider constants in calculus, such as `sin(2)` etc. A kind of transcendental version of QQbar.

No, definitely not, that's just the simple examples I've been giving. In my use case, the coefficients are all functions of symbolic variables.

> The problem is that SR is not such a ring. It also contains all kinds of non-constant transcendentals.

I'm not sure what difference that makes from the point of view of adding a transcendental not in `SR`.

> That's where `SR['T']` is special: You are clearly asking for a transcendental that doesn't lie in `SR`.
> As you remark, sage already (justly) recognizes that by not allowing coercion of `T` into `SR`. So in my opinion sage already has exactly the right support for such rings.

Let me just give one more example. `ZZ` is an initial object for unitary rings, so this function:

```
def transformation(polynomial):
    R.<t> = ZZ[]
    return sum ( polynomial[i] * t^i for i in range(polynomial.degree())    
```

will be the identity for all polynomials over any base ring, except for the symbolic ring. This map may not seem useful in practise, but imagine applying some map to the coefficients, or anything more interesting. The point is that the above may be a special case of some complicated transformation you're doing on polynomials.

I know that one could probably work around this by

```
    R.<t> = polynomial.base_ring()[]
```
instead, but since we're talking about the coercion system, I'm trying to show examples where I think it doesn't work as expected. I'm also thinking of the case where a library algorithm I didn't write would work excellently on `SR[]` based on the above assumption, except for the nonstandard handling of Sage of `SR` as a base ring. Then it is a shame if Sage's coercion system would force you to dig into the algorithm because it would have required the programmer to continuously check for the anomalous condition 'base_ring == SR'.

Well, it is about as anomalous as the set of all sets: it is the only ring with canonical coersions into it from arbitrarily construction that uses it as a base ring.

I am really starting to think that my previous idea of introducing white/black-listed symbolic rings would be a good solution and it should not be too hard to implement (although I don't know much about how SR is done).

SR is similar to `automatic_names(True)` - any name appearing in a string fed to it will be treated as a new variable. If I could write something like

```
sage: R = SR(allowed_names="a b beta")
sage: R("sqrt(a) * sin(beta)")
sqrt(a) * sin(beta)
sage: R("sqrt(a) * cos(alpha)")
...
NameError: alpha is not a variable in this symbolic ring
```
it would definitely suit my purposes and I think it would allow adjusting coercion in such a way, that treating polynomials in t over this R or adding a polynomial over integers and elements of R behaves consistently with regular rings.

By the way, I think that this is a bug:

```
sage: QQ["t"]["t"]
Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
```
Nobody in mathematics uses the same variable in the same expression with the same meaning, so there is no reason to support it. Moreover, this may indicate a logical error and a user would appreciate catching it. So I think that constructions that "add names" should check that they are absent in the base ring. This way it would be prohibited to create `SR["t"]`, but all polynomials can remain coercible to `SR`.

I suppose adding such a check is also not extremely difficult, but care should be taken when constructing polynomials "for internal purposes". There should be some standard way to get from a ring a name that can work as a "new name". And it should raise an exception for SR.

I also think that for any element of any ring we should have `R(str(f)) == f` which is impossible to hope for if we do not insist on distinct names for generators.

This map may not seem useful in practise, but imagine applying some map to the coefficients, or anything more interesting. The point is that the above may be a special case of some complicated transformation you're doing on polynomials.

That example doesn't work because sage refuses in a lot of cases to construct a suitable parent. Try:

```
transformation(ZZ['a']['b']([1,2,3]))
```
If it did work, it would only work for base rings that don't have a generator named `t` in them
already. So for any of

```
Q['t','s']['a','b']
`QuadraticField(5,name='t')
PowerSeriesRing(QQ,name='t')['u','v']
```
this would give a different answer than the functorial one I think you're expecting.

The fact that sage attaches meaning to print names of variables really does have some profound effects. 

> I know that one could probably work around this by

Indeed. It's much better to be explicit than making the system guess where you want your answer to live.

I would probably do

```
    t=polynomial.parent().0
    return sum ( polynomial[i] * t^i for i in range(polynomial.degree())
```
in order to avoid introducing new (hard coded) names unnecessarily.
