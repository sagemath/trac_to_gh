Wonder whether Singular automatically uses FLINT if it finds the proper version (2.x?)...

Singular 3-1-5 (with our old FLINT 1.5.2) says

```
configure: WARNING: Unable to find FLINT (which is strongly recommended) on your machine: please use --with-flint=PATH_TO_DIR_CONTAINING_LIB_AND_INCLUDE (see also ./configure --help if you do not understand what we are talking about)
```

Does this ticket depend on #13237?

I guess it should.
It should even depend on the updated spkg I'll post in a few moments in #12089 based on the one in #13237.

Modified the options passed to configured, cleaned up a little bit SPKG.txt and updated the deps file for pkgs.
Added a patch so that libsingular.so and not only Singular exe is actually linked to flint.
That should prevent future failure when I decide to test it under cygwin,I'll test it tonight.

I did not forward the little patch upstream for two reasons:
* I'm not sure it will be needed by Singular 4-0-0 whose build system is completely different.
* Singular issue tracker listens on an exotic port that I cannot access from the machine I developed the patch on.

This seems all good except for two failing doctests where the output is a list whose ordering has changed:

```
sage -t --long src/doc/en/developer/coding_in_other.rst  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/doc/en/constructions/algebraic_geometry.rst  # 1 doctest failed
```
