```
Currently, the padics lack an `inverse_of_unit()` method:

```
sage: (-1).inverse_of_unit()
-1
sage: ZpCA(3)(-1).inverse_of_unit()
AttributeError
```

The drawback with simply using `~` is that it puts the result in the fraction field and it can be annoying to always convert it back to the original ring when implementing general algorithms for all padics rings and fields:

```
sage: t = ZpCA(3,2)(-1)
sage: t
2 + 2*3 + O(3^2)
sage: t.parent()
3-adic Ring with capped absolute precision 2
sage: ~t
2 + 2*3 + O(3^2)
sage: (~t).parent()
3-adic Field with capped relative precision 2
```

The attached patch implements a method `inverse_of_unit()` and fixes a conversion error that came up when testing it.

Depends on #13600
