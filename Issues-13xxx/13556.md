The reason this takes for ever is that Sage is trying to create the infinite vector 

```
(0.000000000000000, 1.00000000000000, -1.00000000000000, 0.500000000000000, -0.500000000000000, 2.00000000000000, -2.00000000000000, 0.333333333333333, -0.333333333333333, 3.00000000000000, -3.00000000000000, 0.666666666666667, -0.666666666666667, 1.50000000000000, ... ) 
```
whose entries are an enumeration of the rationals.  It's line 504 of `sage/structure/sequence.py` (sage-5.3):

```
            x = [universe(t) for t in x]
```
in which `universe` is `RR` and `x` is `QQ`, that's hanging.

An initial segment of this vector can created as

```
sage: vector(RR, QQ.range_by_height(3))
(0.000000000000000, 1.00000000000000, -1.00000000000000, 0.500000000000000, -0.500000000000000, 2.00000000000000, -2.00000000000000)

To the best of my knowledge, sage currently does not handle infinite sequences. So the following also run indefinitely

```
sage: list(QQ)
sage: tuple(QQ)
sage: Sequence((1..))
sage: Sequence(ZZ)
sage: Sequence(Partitons())
```
I've started a thread on sage-devel about how to proceed.
