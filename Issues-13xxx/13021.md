I think this ticket is now obsolete having been leapfrogged by whichever one introduced eclib-20120830.

I had been planning to make a new eclib spkg after flint-2.3 was in Sage, though the current build system (as at github now (April 2013)) works with or without it, the part of the code which provides Sage's CremonaModularSymbols() is rather faster with Flint.

Unless you are afraid that we will run out of ticket numbers, I don't think tha would save a lot -- the attachments here need changing as well as the description.  A new ticket with a forward reference here seems simpler to me.
