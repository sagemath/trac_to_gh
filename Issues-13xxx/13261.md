Section 2.3 of the SageTeX documentation ("Using TeXShop") is incomplete.  It mentions the "%!TEX" string, but more details are either necessary or potentially helpful.

I have modified sagetex.dtx and attached an updated .spkg.

I don't know "obvious" it is, but I read sage-devel, so mentioning it there is as good as "reporting upstream". :)  You can also email me directly.

I can pull a diff out of your spkg. I'll try to get to this later this week.
