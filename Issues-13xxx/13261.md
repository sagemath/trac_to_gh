<div id="comment:0"></div>

Section 2.3 of the SageTeX documentation ("Using TeXShop") is incomplete.  It mentions the "%!TEX" string, but more details are either necessary or potentially helpful.

I have modified sagetex.dtx and attached an updated .spkg.


Component: **documentation**

Keywords: **TeX, SageTeX**

I don't know "obvious" it is, but I read sage-devel, so mentioning it there is as good as "reporting upstream". :)  You can also email me directly.

I can pull a diff out of your spkg. I'll try to get to this later this week.
