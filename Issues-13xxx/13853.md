```
The docstring of the `FreeModule.coordinates` method advertizes a `check` parameters, which defaults to `True`, and whose effect is in principle to check that the arguments belongs to the module. If not, an `ArithmeticError` is said to be raised.

The actual implementation deviates in several ways.

* The `check` parameter does not check that the argument belongs to the module. It checks that the argument belongs to the ambient vector space of the module. The coordinates returned are coordinates in the ambient vector space.

```
sage: M = ZZ^3
sage: v = vector(QQ, [1/2,0,1])
sage: v in M
False
sage: M.coordinates(v)
[1/2, 0, 1]
```
According to the docstring, the call to `M.coordinates(v)` should have failed with an `ArithmeticError` exception

* When the method fails, it does not fail with the right exception.

```
sage: M = ZZ^3
sage: M.coordinates( [sqrt(2), 1, 1] )
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unable to convert sqrt(2) to a rational
```
According to the spec, it should have failed with an `ArithmeticError` exception.


**Proposed Solution** : modify the function so that its behavior match the specification, by rejecting things that are not in the module itself with an `ArithmeticError` exception

Arguments AGAINST modifying the specification to match the present behavior are:
* The ambient vector space does not always exist (e.g. when the ring is not a PID)
* When it does, the present functionnality is still available through `M.vector_space().coordinates()`

Depends on #13780

I feel these are actually very good arguments. Could you explain why you chose to update the code instead of the documentation?

I tested your patch. Overall, it looks very good. I like the attention to detail evident from including a doctest such as

```
Wrong arguments are presumably caught with a ``TypeError`` exception:: 
	 
    sage: (ZZ^3).coordinates( QQ ) 
    Traceback (most recent call last): 
    ... 
    TypeError: can't initialize vector from nonzero non-list 
```

I tried the examples you gave in the bug description. The first one:

```
sage: M = ZZ^3
sage: v = vector(ZZ, [1/2,0,1])
sage: v in M
False
sage: M.coordinates(v)
[1/2, 0, 1]
```
already fails with a `TypeError` in the call to `vector`. However, after replacing `ZZ` by `QQ`, and with your patch applied, the call to `M.coordinates` gives the desired `ArithmeticError`.

Your second example still gives the same `TypeError`. Maybe that needs some work, but I don't mind either way. I'll set it to needs-work, but I would be willing to give a positive review if you would just document the fact that it could also raise a `TypeError` (depending on "how badly" the coordinate is outside of the base ring).

There should be a space after the comma in 

```
sage/modules/free_module.py:

    except (TypeError,ArithmeticError): 
```

Hi Timo,
