```
The method "_element_constructor_" within the class "CombinatorialFreeModule" has a bug. The following code:

```
elif ((hasattr(self._basis_keys, 'element_class') and
    isinstance(self._basis_keys.element_class, type) and isinstance(x, self._basis_keys.element_class))
  or (sage.structure.element.parent(x) == self._basis_keys)):

    return self.monomial(x)

elif x in self._basis_keys:
    return self.monomial(self._basis_keys(x))
```

will return a monomial indexed by that object before checking that x is an element of the basis. For instance, in the current implementation of kSchur functions, one can try:

```
sage: ks = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).kBoundedSubspace(3,1).kschur()
sage: ks(DyckWord([1,0,1,0]))
ks3()()
```

This should clearly be returning an error. For k-Schur functions, I have fixed this in Track #13762, but was afraid to fix in general because I didn't want to mess up functionality for others.
