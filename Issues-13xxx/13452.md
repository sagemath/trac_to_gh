Some various clean-up of `sage-location`, in particular:
1. Don't use `realpath()` or `abspath()` everywhere.  Just once should be more than sufficient.
2. Merge `initialize_pkgconfig_files()` and `update_pkgconfig_files()`.
3. Improve the logic, i.e. `install_moved()` should not write the processor flags.
4. Improve structure by creating a new top-level function `sage_relocate()` which then calls the other functions.
5. Better documentation.

Follow-up tickets: #13407, #5155.

Depends on #13397

-1, `etc` should be used for text configuration -- these files aren't configuration files, they are storing state information (which is precisely what `var/lib` is for).

At least according to the FHS, there shouldn't be an `/usr/etc` either. The FHS doesn't really cover prefixed environments, so I think it is fair to use relevant directories in `/` when necessary.

OK, `/usr/etc` isn't official either, so that part of the argument is moot.

Still (I know, bikeshedding) I think the description of `etc` as read-only configuration files fits these files much better than `var`'s "state information".  It's something which under normal usage of Sage does not change.  It's equally read-only as the content of `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin`.

Regardless, I prefer not to change this in this ticket because other tickets depend on it.  I'd rather finish #5155 first and then think about where to put these files.

A speed-up was never the intention of this ticket. Perhaps the speed-up is because files are opened only once instead of twice?
