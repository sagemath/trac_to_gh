This patch implements the `blocks_and_cut_vertices` method as proposed by Tarjan in 1972. The time complexity is now in O(|V|+|E|). The running time improvement is significant compared to previous implementation, in particular on large-scale graphs with many blocks.

Before:

```
sage: GP = graphs.PathGraph(6)
sage: %timeit B,C = GP.blocks_and_cut_vertices()
625 loops, best of 3: 167 µs per loop
sage: import networkx
sage: Gbig = Graph(networkx.read_edgelist('/PATHTOFILE/as-rel.20120601.edgelist'))
sage: Gbig.num_verts(),G.num_edges()
(41203, 121309)
sage: %timeit B,C = G.blocks_and_cut_vertices()
5 loops, best of 3: 44.1 s per loop
```

After:

```
sage: %timeit B,C = GP.blocks_and_cut_vertices()
625 loops, best of 3: 152 µs per loop
sage: %timeit B,C = Gbig.blocks_and_cut_vertices()
5 loops, best of 3: 1.61 s per loop
```

In fact the time complexity is more than O(|V|+|E|) since I'm sorting the lists, but the extra computation time is negligible. This can be removed.

I'm using a try...except to test the end of iterations. This could be replaced with a more appropriate test, if any.

When you are to implement Tarjan's algorithms, you have to be smart ;-)

This algorithm has been published 40 years ago. We have to show some respect to the Master!

HelloooooooooooooooooooOO again !

Here is a patch that contains documentation only (if you like it), and three comments :

* What about replacing top by -1 everywhere ? This is Python code, not C arrays ! :-P
* Instead of ``if stack`` and indenting maaaaaaaaany lines in the code, what about writing instead ``if not stack: return whatever`` (and remove the terminal 'return' line) or ``if not stack: break`` and leave the code at its natural level ?
* ``w = stack.pop()`` at this line w is equal to v, isn't it ? ``O_o`` as it appears often afterwards I would sleep easier (unless I make a mistake) if it were replaced by ``w = v`` to make it explicit. With a ``stack.pop()`` just near, or course.

Thaaaaaaaanks for that patch ! I'll go enjoy some sun while it stays `:-)`

Oh. It was only to make it easier to read. Just adding a comment above like "at this point w=v, as v is the value of stack[-1]" is more or less the same.

By the way, do we move the code to graph.py ?

I have added a comment before `w = stack.pop()`

I have nothing against moving the code, but are you sure no one is using this method on directed graphs?
Also, this method is used in `generic_graph.py` by several methods: `genus, vertex_connectivity, is_gallai_graph`, and in `isgci.py`. Would that be a problem?
