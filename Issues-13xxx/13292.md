I downloaded the file sage-5.1-linux-64bit-ubuntu_12.04_lts-x86_64-Linux.tar.lzma from the official website. Sage was unable to use the graphs database.

An example of failure is (taken from the documentation):

```
Q = GraphQuery(display_cols=['graph6','num_vertices','degree_sequence'],num_edges=['<=',5],min_degree=1)
```


The file SAGE_DATA/graphs/graphs.db is a broken symlink to /tmp/graphs.db.cm5Li3EYGT. Replacing it with a link to graphs.db.orig fixed the problem.

From sage root directory:

```
$ cd data/graphs
$ rm graphs.db
$ ln -s graphs.db.orig graphs.db
$ ls -l
total 2452
lrwxrwxrwx 1 steven steven      14 Jul 26 14:35 graphs.db -> graphs.db.orig

It's because of the buildbot setup.

This goes back to the Mitesh Patel days, which is sage-4.6 or something.  So I don't understand why nobody ever noticed this before.

FWIW, some of the temporaries are kept as well:

```
leif@redhawk:~$ ls -l /tmp/graphs.db.*
-rw------- 1 buildbot buildbot 1258496 2012-07-27 05:51 /tmp/graphs.db.Uc0awza1Zl
-rw------- 1 buildbot buildbot 1258496 2012-07-27 02:01 /tmp/graphs.db.zX74CFVi9b
```

No idea why they're copied to `/tmp` at all, since the database is fairly small.

At least the original files are also part of the bdists...
