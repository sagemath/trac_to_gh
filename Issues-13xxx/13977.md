```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: I = R.ideal(1)
sage: I.variety()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: The dimension of the ideal is -1, but it should be 0
```

While it's a matter of conventions whether ideals can have negative dimensions... the variety of QQ[x,y] should just be empty.
