Facade sets are used in many places but there are two small errors that prevent from using it everywhere...

The first error concerns multiple categories initialisation. Here is a minimal example

```
class A(Parent):
    def __init__(self):
        Parent.__init__(self, 
            category=((FiniteEnumeratedSets(),Monoids()),
            facade=True)
```
for which we get

```
sage: A()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'is_subcategory'
```

The second problem concerns the behavior of .facade_for() which is better explained with a minimal example

```
class B(Parent):
    def __init__(self):
        Parent.__init__(self, category=Sets(), facade=True)
```
for which we get

```
sage: b = B()
sage: b.facade_for()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'B_with_category' object has no attribute '_facade_for'
```

The ticket provides the (trivial) corrections for both problems and add two doctests.
