we have to deal with what remained from #12091.  At least, report errors for the inputs like the following:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable()
sage: b[0] <= 555*b[1] >= 2
sage: b[0] <= 555*b[1] == 2
```
which even with #12091 are incorrectly processed

```
sage: b[0] <= 555*b[1] >= 2
2 <= x_0 <= 555*x_1
sage: b[0] <= 555*b[1] == 2
555*x_1 == 2
```
