Currently, show() method of an (MI)LP hardwires the coefficients of inequalities and equations to (Cython) double. 
This is asking for trouble when an arbitrary precision (MI)LP solver, such as one provided by PPL (see #12533) is used.

Worksforme:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="PPL")
sage: x = p.new_variable(nonnegative=True)
sage: p.add_constraint(4/7*x[0] >= 1/2)
sage: p.show()
Maximization:
 
Constraints:
  constraint_0: -4/7 x_0 <= -1/2
Variables:
  x_0 is a continuous variable (min=0, max=+oo)
