This implements a new class `CartanTypeFolded` which takes a Cartan type and considers the diagram folding and stores the associated data.

This also cleans up the references in `kirillov_reshetikhin.py`.

here is a review patch, just cleaning up and putting things into pep8 shape.

Once the bot has turned green again, and if you agree with my review patch, I will give a positive review, but there is a point that bothers me :

I have never heard the words "virtual cartan type" before. Could you give a reference to an article where this terminology is used ?

Nicolas and I are going to look at the patch this week since we had some specific comments about the implementation. So please wait until we have looked at it!

Thank you,

Hi Travis!

We finally had a brainstorm with Anne about this ticket. Sorry that
they come so late in the process, but we have some suggestions on how
to improve the user interface and so.

- Documentation improvements for the main class:

   Start from the definition of `folding` of a simply laced Dynkin
   diagram from :wikipedia:`Dynkin_diagram` (note that, unlike the
   current documentation suggests it's not specific to affine).

   Say that the object in Sage models the Cartan type `X`, endowed
   with the folding from `\hat(X)`.

   Mention that, in the affine case, the code makes the assumption
   that the special node is fixed.

   Mention applications to crystals, with refs.

   For the scaling factors, start from a conceptual type free
   definition. Maybe, following [Schilling FPSAC 2006 p.4] something
   like: the \gamma_i are (up to overall factor?) the unique numbers
   so that:

        \Lambda_i   ->    \gamma_i \sum_j \Lambda_{j\in\orbit(i)}

   is a proper embedding from the weight lattice of X to that of
   \hat{X}?

   Then give the combinatorial description in term of the Dynkin
   diagram and the type-free formula in affine type.

- Suggestions for the user interface:

  ```
  sage: ct = CartanType(["G",2]); ct
  ['G',2]
  sage: vct = ct.as_folding(); vct
  ['G', 2] as folding of ['D', 4]
  sage: type(vct)
  <class '....type_folded.CartanType'>
  sage: vct.folding_of()                 # replaces virtual
  ['D', 4]
  sage: sigma = vct.folding_automorphism()       # replaces sigma
  ```

- Put the implementation accordingly in .../root_system/type_folded.py

- Does scaling_factors work for type BC relabelled?

- Does the type free formula for the scaling factors work for type
  BC/dual? If not, the doc needs to be updated.

Thanks for this useful addition!

Cheers,
                    Anne and Nicolas

Hi Travis,

We forgot a few more things:

- You seem to only work with the orbit of the Dynkin diagram automorphism. Hence the name

```
    sage: sigma = vct.folding_orbit()       # replaces sigma
```
might actually be more appropriate.

- The output of the orbit is a dictionary. Hence it would make more sense to also take as an input a dictionary with keys the Dynkin labels. In a list it is not completely clear which label go to which (since for example in the finite case the Dynkin nodes are labeled from 1 to `n` rather than 0 to `n`). The output could actually be a family instead of a dictionary.

Thanks for your work on this!

Here's with the fixed doctest in `type_relabel.py`. IDK about the one in `weierstrass.py`, seems completely unrelated to this patch, and it passed for me:

```
sage -t --long ../../schemes/toric/weierstrass.py
    [134 tests, 7.30 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 7.5 seconds
    cpu time: 6.0 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 7.3 seconds
