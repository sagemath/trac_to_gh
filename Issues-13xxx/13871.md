This implements a new class `CartanTypeFolded` which takes a Cartan type and considers the diagram folding and stores the associated data.

This also cleans up the references in `kirillov_reshetikhin.py`.

<a id='comment:14'></a>Hi Travis!

We finally had a brainstorm with Anne about this ticket. Sorry that
they come so late in the process, but we have some suggestions on how
to improve the user interface and so.

- Documentation improvements for the main class:

   Start from the definition of `folding` of a simply laced Dynkin
   diagram from :wikipedia:`Dynkin_diagram` (note that, unlike the
   current documentation suggests it's not specific to affine).

   Say that the object in Sage models the Cartan type `X`, endowed
   with the folding from `\hat(X)`.

   Mention that, in the affine case, the code makes the assumption
   that the special node is fixed.

   Mention applications to crystals, with refs.

   For the scaling factors, start from a conceptual type free
   definition. Maybe, following [Schilling FPSAC 2006 p.4] something
   like: the \gamma_i are (up to overall factor?) the unique numbers
   so that:

        \Lambda_i   ->    \gamma_i \sum_j \Lambda_{j\in\orbit(i)}

   is a proper embedding from the weight lattice of X to that of
   \hat{X}?

   Then give the combinatorial description in term of the Dynkin
   diagram and the type-free formula in affine type.

- Suggestions for the user interface:
  {{{
  sage: ct = CartanType(["G",2]); ct
  ['G',2]
  sage: vct = ct.as_folding(); vct
  ['G', 2] as folding of ['D', 4]
  sage: type(vct)
  <class '....type_folded.CartanType'>
  sage: vct.folding_of()                 # replaces virtual
  ['D', 4]
  sage: sigma = vct.folding_automorphism()       # replaces sigma
  }}}

- Put the implementation accordingly in .../root_system/type_folded.py

- Does scaling_factors work for type BC relabelled?

- Does the type free formula for the scaling factors work for type
  BC/dual? If not, the doc needs to be updated.

Thanks for this useful addition!

Cheers,
                    Anne and Nicolas

<a id='comment:15'></a>Hi Travis,

We forgot a few more things:

- You seem to only work with the orbit of the Dynkin diagram automorphism. Hence the name

```
    sage: sigma = vct.folding_orbit()       # replaces sigma
```
might actually be more appropriate.

- The output of the orbit is a dictionary. Hence it would make more sense to also take as an input a dictionary with keys the Dynkin labels. In a list it is not completely clear which label go to which (since for example in the finite case the Dynkin nodes are labeled from 1 to `n` rather than 0 to `n`). The output could actually be a family instead of a dictionary.

Thanks for your work on this!

This is currently confusing in the documentation.
