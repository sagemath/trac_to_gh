It would be nice if face/normal fans could be constructed from a generic (QQ-)polytope and not just from a lattice polytope:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z>=ZZ[]
sage: f=x*R.random_element()+y*R.random_element()+z*R.random_element()

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

`NormalFan` takes a lattice polytope as argument, not any QQ-polytope:

```
sage: NormalFan(Q.lattice_polytope())
Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice N
```
Having said that, it would be nice if any polytope would work.

I think the normal fan is defined for non-compact polytopes as well - rays are normals to facets (hence we need full-dimensionality) and higher dimensional cones are given by smaller dimensional faces. I don't insist on implementing it, but perhaps `NotImplementedError` is more suitable than `ValueError`?
