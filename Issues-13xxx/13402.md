see "Bug in Graph.matching" thread on sage-devel:

```
sage: sage: g = graphs.PathGraph(3) # an unweighted graph                                                                                  
sage: sage: g.matching(value_only=True, use_edge_labels=True)                                                            
1.0
sage: sage: g.matching(value_only=True, use_edge_labels=False)                                                                   
2
```
as mentioned there, the bug is in the line `return Integer(len(d))` near line 6786 in `sage/graphs/generic_graph.py`.

It should be `return Integer(len(d)/2)`
