In order to make Sage as self-contained as possible, it would be good if Sage would run assuming write access only to $TMPDIR (`/tmp` by default) and $DOT_SAGE (`~/.sage` by default).

In #5155 we already fixed write access to `$SAGE_ROOT`, the only remaining problem is SciPy which wants to write to `$HOME/.python27_compiled`.
