```
When using the example in the documentation of the function the following results are displayed for critical points:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: f1 = x^0
sage: f2 = 10*x - x^2
sage: f3 = 3*x^4 - 156*x^3 + 3036*x^2 - 26208*x
sage: f = Piecewise([[(0,3),f1],[(3,10),f2],[(10,20),f3]])
sage: f.critical_points()
[5.0, 12.000000000000124, 12.999999999999725, 14.000000000000151]
```

When doing the same with y instead of x as a variable an empty list is returned as a result:

```
sage: R.<y> = QQ[]                                        
sage: f1 = y^0                                            
sage: f2 = 10*y - y^2                                     
sage: f3 = 3*y^4 - 156*y^3 + 3036*y^2 - 26208*y           
sage: f = Piecewise([[(0,3),f1],[(3,10),f2],[(10,20),f3]])
sage: f.critical_points()                                 
[]
```

This behavior does not change even if y is explicitly defined as the variable:

```
sage: f = Piecewise([[(0,3),f1],[(3,10),f2],[(10,20),f3]],y)
sage: f.critical_points()                                   
[]
```

A variable besides default_variable() is also used (to varying effects) in the functions trapezoid(), derivative(), tangent_line() and convolution(). The fourier series functions that find coefficients use a variable other than default_variable() in the code, but it doesn't affect output, and probably doesn't need to be changed. However, the _fourier_series_helper() function probably should be changed.

```
sage: y = var('y')
sage: f(y) = y^2
sage: f = Piecewise([[(-1, 1),f]])
sage: f._fourier_series_helper(3, 1, lambda n: 1)
-4*cos(pi*x)/pi^2 + cos(2*pi*x)/pi^2 + 1/3
```

It should be possible to obtain consistent results no matter what the name of the variable is.

Thanks for the quick patch. Can you add doctests to demonstrate the fix? The example in the description should be enough.

It would be good to make sure this plays well with the `var` argument of the `PiecewisePolynomial` constructor and the `default_variable()` function. I don't think this is necessary for a positive review though.

{
    "body": "<div id=\"comment:6\" align=\"right\">comment:6</div>\n\nHello Andrew,\n\nthank you for the patch. It indeed seems to solve the reported problem. However, allow me to make a few remarks:\n\n* I am not sure whether you intentionally put the patch and the doctest for the patch in two seperate patches\n* I think the second part of your doctest does not proove anything as y is the only variable in your PiecewisePolynomial. I can do the following:\n\n```\nsage: f1(y) = y^0\nsage: f2(y) = 10*y - y^2\nsage: f3(y) = 3*y^4 - 156*y^3 + 3036*y^2 - 26208*y\nsage: f = Piecewise([[(0,3),f1],[(3,10),f2],[(10,20),f3]], y)\nsage: f.critical_points()\n[5.0, 12.000000000000124, 12.999999999999725, 14.000000000000151]\nsage: z = var(\"z\")                                           \nsage: g = Piecewise([[(0,3),f1],[(3,10),f2],[(10,20),f3]], z)\nsage: g.critical_points()\n[5.0, 12.000000000000124, 12.999999999999725, 14.000000000000151]\n```\n* From personal experience: I would avoid doctests with precion outputs like this because they might fail due to slightly different results on 32 bit machines.\n* The following modification results in an error, although e is a constant and not a variable. However, I think this is (also) a problem related to maxima. At least the exception raised currently is misleading. I modified the f2 in the example above:\n\n```\n\nsage: f2(y) = e^2*y - y^2\nsage: f = Piecewise([[(0,3),f1],[(3,10),f2],[(10,20),f3]], y)\nsage: f.critical_points()\n...\nValueError: No differentiation variable specified.\n\n```\n\n* I looked through the piecewise.py module to see whether there are other instances of forcing the variable to x. There are indeed, but the errors they are causing are different (see example below). Do you think it would be sensible to deal with these cases also in this patch (as they are related to the same root cause)? Here is an example were the output is basically correct but the variable is wrong (g is the function defined above):\n\n```\nsage: g.derivative()\nPiecewise defined function with 3 parts, [[(0, 3), x |--> 0], [(3, 10), x |--> 0], [(10, 20), x |--> 0]]\n```\n\nChristian",

Hello Andrew,

thank you for the patch. It indeed seems to solve the reported problem. However, allow me to make a few remarks:

* I am not sure whether you intentionally put the patch and the doctest for the patch in two seperate patches
* I think the second part of your doctest does not proove anything as y is the only variable in your PiecewisePolynomial. I can do the following:

```
sage: f1(y) = y^0
sage: f2(y) = 10*y - y^2
sage: f3(y) = 3*y^4 - 156*y^3 + 3036*y^2 - 26208*y
sage: f = Piecewise([[(0,3),f1],[(3,10),f2],[(10,20),f3]], y)
sage: f.critical_points()
[5.0, 12.000000000000124, 12.999999999999725, 14.000000000000151]
sage: z = var("z")                                           
sage: g = Piecewise([[(0,3),f1],[(3,10),f2],[(10,20),f3]], z)
sage: g.critical_points()
[5.0, 12.000000000000124, 12.999999999999725, 14.000000000000151]
```
* From personal experience: I would avoid doctests with precion outputs like this because they might fail due to slightly different results on 32 bit machines.
* The following modification results in an error, although e is a constant and not a variable. However, I think this is (also) a problem related to maxima. At least the exception raised currently is misleading. I modified the f2 in the example above:

```

sage: f2(y) = e^2*y - y^2
sage: f = Piecewise([[(0,3),f1],[(3,10),f2],[(10,20),f3]], y)
sage: f.critical_points()
...
ValueError: No differentiation variable specified.

```

* I looked through the piecewise.py module to see whether there are other instances of forcing the variable to x. There are indeed, but the errors they are causing are different (see example below). Do you think it would be sensible to deal with these cases also in this patch (as they are related to the same root cause)? Here is an example were the output is basically correct but the variable is wrong (g is the function defined above):

```
sage: g.derivative()
Piecewise defined function with 3 parts, [[(0, 3), x |--> 0], [(3, 10), x |--> 0], [(10, 20), x |--> 0]]
```

I was going to change laplace too, but after looking at it more closely I decided to leave it alone.
I had no idea what to do with convolution().

No, it was a mistake, sorry.

I put this in the doctest because Burcin suggested I made sure that default_variable() worked well, but it does seem a little redundant.

Fixed this.

This also fails if you try to do it in the current version of SAGE (with x as a variable). So yes, it is a bug in maxima. Also, I get the error

```
TypeError: ECL says: Error executing code in Maxima: allroots: expected
a polynomial in one variable; found variables [%e,x]

Hello Andrew,

I think there is still a small inconsistency in your code: In most methods you use the default_variable as the parameter. However, in critical_points() you just deleted old asignment of using "x" as the variable. While the other methods work with expressions with more than variable, critical_points() raises a TypeError.

What would be even nicer than using the default_variable IMHO would be the use of the "var" parameter in the constructor (if defined). What do yout think? Or maybe this would be something for a nother patch.

I fixed the critical_points inconsistency, thank you for pointing that out. As for the default_variable(), I was just using what was already written for the purpose, I think it's rather helpful. If var is undefined, we have to end up using default_variable() anyway, so IMHO it would be better to keep it a little simpler.

Andrew

P.S., I fixed a small grammatical error in the docstring for default_variable().

Hello Andrew,

sorry for the long silence but now finally I find time to look into your patch. Running the doctest I currently get one failure:

That's weird, because when I test piecewise.py everything passes:

```
andrew@andrew-laptop ~/sage-5.6/devel/sage $ ../../sage -t --long sage/functions/piecewise.py 
sage -t --long "devel/sage-main/sage/functions/piecewise.py"
	 [26.7 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 26.7 seconds

```

I also manually tested the code, (which I assumed to be my addition to the trapezoid docstring) and achieved the expected results.

Hello Andrew,

finally found the time to study this patch again. Meanwhile I updated to 5.7 and could not reproduce the error I reported. However, two new ones popped up, although the second one IMHO is just related to me not having build the complete doc.

```
The following tests failed:


	sage -t  --long -force_lib "devel/sage/doc/en/constructions/calculus.rst"
	sage -t  --long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/misc/sagedoc.py"
```

The details from the log file:

```
sage -t  --long -force_lib "devel/sage/doc/en/constructions/calculus.rst"

```

I believe that the error is caused by the fact that piecewise.default_variable() raises a TypeError when lambda functions are used (the example in calculus.rst uses lambda functions). Correct me if I am worng but I don't think this is related to anything you changed in piecewise.

So I do not know whether this patch can be set to positive review or whether that bug needs to be fixed first.
