No, there really is a conflict with William's referee patch at #13035. Shouldn't be too hard to fix up.

That's from an integer matrix, so putting a `round()` in there will not harm anything.

Thanks, Dan and Andrey.  v2 patch is standalone patch.

* Rebased with missed reviewer patch from other ticket.
* Double "square" is gone.
* `round()` on all integer determinants and output reformatted

Thanks for all your work on the Cholesky stack!
