The attached patch adds the Degree Negative Lexicographical term order (`DegNegLex`) to Sage 5.1.

It is defined as follows: x<sup>**a**</sup> < x<sup>**b**</sup> if and only if deg(x<sup>**a**</sup>) < deg(x<sup>**b**</sup>) or deg(x<sup>**a**</sup>) = deg(x<sup>**b**</sup>) and there exists 1 <= i <= n such that a<sub>1</sub> = b,, 1,, , ... , a,, i-1,,  = b,, i-1,,, ..., a<sub>i</sub> > b<sub>i</sub>. 

It is a native term ordering of `PolyBoRi` ("`dp_asc`") which Sage does not support yet. But Sage uses it internally to implement `DegRevLex`-ordered `BooleanPolynomialRing`s by reverting  `.gens()`. It is useful for Sage to distinguish between the original `dp_asc` and `DegRevLex`. It will help to fix some design issues discovered when fixing #13202.

Singular supports this as `(a(1:n),ls(n))`. The patch also includes the patches for the interfaces `libSingular` and Singular-pexpect.
