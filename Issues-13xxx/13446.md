In #11919, I added a workaround for picking of symbolic functions. An upgrade to Pynac in #12950 made the workaround unnecessary, so we should just remove it.

Do you really need to change the text before the doctest? IMHO, we don't need to discuss the history of the bug in the reference manual.

Is it a big deal? We at least need the code explaining why the doctest is there, but the explanation that's there now isn't really correct anymore. It's only a few lines and it serves to give anyone who would modify that function a little background on it.

Plus, that function doesn't wind up in the reference manual anyway, so it doesn't hurt anyone who isn't digging into the code.
