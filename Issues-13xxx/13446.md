In #11919, I added a workaround for picking of symbolic functions. An upgrade to Pynac in #12950 made the workaround unnecessary, so we should just remove it.

Do you really need to change the text before the doctest? IMHO, we don't need to discuss the history of the bug in the reference manual.

Plus, that function doesn't wind up in the reference manual anyway, so it doesn't hurt anyone who isn't digging into the code.
