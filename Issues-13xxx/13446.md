Do you really need to change the text before the doctest? IMHO, we don't need to discuss the history of the bug in the reference manual.

Is it a big deal? We at least need the code explaining why the doctest is there, but the explanation that's there now isn't really correct anymore. It's only a few lines and it serves to give anyone who would modify that function a little background on it.

Plus, that function doesn't wind up in the reference manual anyway, so it doesn't hurt anyone who isn't digging into the code.
