Currently if you specify the egg-path when using setuptools' `setup.py develop`, it still places the absolute path in `easy_install.pth`. This causes issues with relocation. Currently this only affects the sage notebook (which works around it by using a sed command), but with #13190 it will also affect the sage library. Since the `easy_install.pth` file is regenerated whenever setuptools detects that it needs to be, trying to use sed commands to work around this issue is unrealistic.
