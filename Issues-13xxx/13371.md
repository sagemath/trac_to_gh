As per #4529, there was an upstream bug with noninteger bases in logarithmic plots.
This has now been
[fixed upstream](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/909#issuecomment-7756212) and we should remove notes like this from the plot commands
and instead encourage the use of noninteger base if the user so desires.

```
    .. note::

        - Although it is possible to provide a noninteger ``base``, the
          tick labeling and formatting is not ideal. Hence, in case you do
          use noninteger ``base`` for the logarithm, then provide your own
          tick formatter using the option ``tick_formatter``.
```
This can be done once matplotlib is released with the fix.
