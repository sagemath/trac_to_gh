Currently sage environmental variables are set in both `sage-env`, and a subset are set in `spkg/install`. This should be refactored. Also, since `sage-spkg` is now always called from within the sage environment (as it should be), so it is no longer necessary to source `sage-env`.

**Installation instructions:**

Apply [attachment:trac13448.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13448/trac13448.patch) to the root repo.

Depends on #13123

**Attachment:** [trac13448.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13448/trac13448.patch.gz)

This is going to break badly because `sage-env` is sourced only once (in this case, at the very beginning of the installation) but it needs to be re-sourced at various times during the installation because of environment variables which are conditionally set.  This can be seen during upgrading for example, where `sage-env` is sourced by `sage --upgrade`, requiring various ugly work-arounds.  To support upgrading, `spkg/install` needs to keep working with an old `sage-env`.

I agree there is a little bit of duplication between `spkg/install` and `sage-env` but I don't see a clean way to fix this.  I'm open for suggestions though...

I propose to postpone this ticket, perhaps at a later time refactoring will be easier.
