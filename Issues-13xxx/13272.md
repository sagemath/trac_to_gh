Working on #11731, I realized that the docstring for factor() could also be cleaned up.

To make reviewing easier, I moved this to a separate ticket.

I mostly tried to simplify the wording in some places and unify the way polynomial rings are constructed. I changed the example where `_factor_univariate_polynomial()` is replaced since adding factorization where none is present seemed more natural to me. I removed the test for `Test that this factorization really uses ``nffactor()`` internally` since it apparently did not test anything: PARI's debug output is sent to stderr so the doctests do not see it; since there is an empty line after the line `F = pol.factor()`, the doctests expected no output to stdout which is what actually happened.

Ok. If this was indeed intended, then I can of course revert these changes. I just had the feeling that the different constructors should not be tested in the `factor()` method. When I was new to sage I found such docstrings quite confusing because I wondered if these different constructors had any influence on the code that was actually demonstrated.

<a id='comment:15'></a>After the switch to Git, I thought it was a good time to come back to this ticket (and the others related to #11731).  I converted the two patches into a branch based on Sage 6.0 (to be pushed shortly).  I omitted most of the changes in the polynomial constructors (see comment:3) and did not delete the `nffactor()` test (see comment:1; it does see the `stderr` output).  Furthermore, I made a few small cosmetic fixes.  If you are happy with this version, feel free to set it to positive review.
