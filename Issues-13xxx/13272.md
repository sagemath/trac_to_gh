Working on #11731, I realized that the docstring for factor() could also be cleaned up.

To make reviewing easier, I moved this to a separate ticket.

Hello, some comments on your patches :)
1. You can mention class functions in your patches by writing it as <code>:meth:\`._factor_univariate_polynomial\`</code> instead of writing that as <code>\`_factor_univariate_polynomial()\`</code>. See this [dev doc](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/sage_manuals.html#chapter-sage-manuals-links) for more details.
2. I don't understand why you made all the changes like the one below. I think all these forms of declarations test different ways of calling and/or declaring the rings or variables. Unless I am mistaken, it should be good to leave them alone. Maybe someone who knows the code better can comment.

```
-            sage: C = ComplexField(100)
-            sage: R.<x> = C[]
+
+            sage: R.<x> = ComplexField(100)[]
             sage: F = factor(x^2+3); F
```
