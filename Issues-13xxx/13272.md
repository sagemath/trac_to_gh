I mostly tried to simplify the wording in some places and unify the way polynomial rings are constructed. I changed the example where `_factor_univariate_polynomial()` is replaced since adding factorization where none is present seemed more natural to me. I removed the test for `Test that this factorization really uses ``nffactor()`` internally` since it apparently did not test anything: PARI's debug output is sent to stderr so the doctests do not see it; since there is an empty line after the line `F = pol.factor()`, the doctests expected no output to stdout which is what actually happened.
