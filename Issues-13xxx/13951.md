Computing local heights uses functions that are only available when the base field is a NumberField, and not over the RationalField:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0, 0, 0, -36, 0])
sage: P = E(-3, 9)
sage: P.archimedian_local_height()
...
AttributeError: 'RationalField_with_category' object has no attribute 'places'
sage: P.nonarchimedian_local_height()
...
AttributeError: 'RationalField_with_category' object has no attribute 'factor'
```

Note: at the moment this bug only shows up for non-torsion points because of bug #13953 (asking for local heights of torsion points always returns 0, which is in general incorrect).

A second comment, of a different kind:  how can it have happened and never been noticied that these related functions are all spelled wrong!  It is "archimedean" and not "archimedian" (think "Archimedes").

I don't think I will be able to resist correcting all these: about 24 occurrences including doctests.  Interestingly, in almost all places the word is spelled correctly in comments.  But should we just deprecate the old spelling?  I will consult sage-devel.

1. In line 2858 of the patched file I removed the division by K.degree() since that is 1.  This appeared to cut the time to doctest this file (with --long) by a few seconds, but that might have been a freak!

2. The global height function would now work without calling pari, hence with no special case needed for K==QQ.  Alternatively, we could easily add an "algorithm" parameter which could be either "sage" or "pari", with "pari" the default.  I think that over QQ pari uses Mestre's AGM method for the real place, which is likely to be faster.  Having the choice of algorithm would make it easy to add a doctest to compare the two;  there should already be a doctest showing that the global height is the sum of the arch. and non-arch. heights which would actually be a test since we are computing them entirely indepependently!

3. The non-arch. height has a parameter "weighted" which is not documented and should be, with doctests shoing its use.  Similarly with the is_minimal parameter.  And for consistency, surely the arch. height should also have a weighted parameter?

Sorry to be awkward;  mathematically the patch is certainly ok!

I have a second patch which deals only with (1) spelling corrrections, but no deprecation warning, (2) not dividing by K.degree() when it is 1.  I can add to that after this discussion, so will not upload it yet.

One easy solution would be to rely on the fact that K.places() returns the r_1 real embeddings followed by the r_2 complex embeddings:


```
r1, r2 = K.signature()
pl = K.places()
return (sum(self.archimedian_local_height(pl[i], prec) for i in range(r1))
        + 2 * sum(self.archimedian_local_height(pl[i], prec) for i in range(r1, r1 + r2))) / K.degree()

```
This leaves the job of distinguishing real and complex places to the NumberField code.  I just tested this and it appears to work

> A second comment, of a different kind:  how can it have happened and never been noticied that these related functions are all spelled wrong!  It is "archimedean" and not "archimedian" (think "Archimedes").

I agree with the spelling "archimedean".  (It is "archimedisch" in German and Dutch, and "archimédien" in French, but in these cases the "i" is part of the suffix.  Similarly, "Euclidean geometry" vs. "géométrie euclidienne" etc.)

If we are changing the spelling anyway, should we also write "non_archimedean_local_height" instead of "nonarchimedean_local_height" for readability?

I also noticed that "independent" is spelled "independant" in three places in the documentation.

Yes, the division by K.degree() should clearly be omitted.

Alternatively, we could easily add an "algorithm" parameter which could be either "sage" or "pari", with "pari" the default.

As far as I can see the doctest verifying that the height equals the sum of the archimedean and non-archimedean local heights is not there yet, but there should certainly be one!

Yes, that sounds reasonable.

It seems to me that the parameter "weighted" still makes sense if v = None: we should take the weighted sum of the local heights at all (non-)Archimedean places, and if weighted = False, we divide this sum by the degree of K.

Although it would certainly be good to have a parameter "weighted" for archimedean_local_height, the drawback is that we would again need to distinguish between real and complex places.

The current conventions for the return values of (non)archimedian_local_height are consistent.  The difference is that the calculation is done differently: for v Archimedean we compute with the smaller of the two all the time and multiply by the local degree at the end if necessary, while for v non-Archimedean we compute with the larger of the two and divide by the local degree at the end if necessary.

Peter, this is ready for review again.  It would be useful if you could review the changes I made before we ask a 3rd party;  I am sorry that because of the rebasing, by patch is not separate.

I did not add a weighted parameter to the archimedean height, for the reasons discussed.

I was about to add a normalised parameter to the global height, defaulting to True, but changed my mind since that would require having two different cached values, one normalised and one not, and I was lazy.

By the way, I did verify using independent code in eclib that the examples you added (local heights over QQ) give the correct values.

Thanks!  The only problem was a warning while building the documentation.  The new patch fixes this and polishes the documentation of [[non_]archimedean_local_]height.

I now added a "weighted" flag to the global height function (only the normalised height is cached) and to archimedean_local_height.  For the latter I reintroduced the ugly way of checking whether an Archimedean place is real (v.im_gens()[0] in rings.RR).  However, this is only needed when the user directly calls archimedean_local_height(v, weighted=True), not when v = None.

Replying to [@JohnCremona](#comment%3A18):

> I was about to add a normalised parameter to the global height, defaulting to True, but changed my mind since that would require having two different cached values, one normalised and one not, and I was lazy.

Probably "normalised" (default True) is more intuitive than "weighted" (default False); I changed this in the latest patch, together with some minimal extra polishing of the documentation.

One small point:  on line 2618 you set w=1, which will be a python int, and then you multiply the final returned height by w (in 3 places, 2 with the cached value and one when it is computed).  Maybe I am old-fashioned, but I don't like multiplying by 1: can we reply on python doing nothing when that value of 1 is a plain python int?  If it were not for this scaling needing to be done in three places I would suggest not defining w at all and ending the function with

```
if normalised:
    return height
else:
    return height * K.degree()
```
but it is not very nice to add that three times.

Perhaps multiplying by one in the usual (and default) case is not serious.

The only other thing to point out is that there is no new doctest to show the effect of the normalisation parameter.  How about:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a1')
sage: P = E([0,0])
sage: P.height()
0.0511114082399688
sage: P.height(normalised=False)
0.0511114082399688
sage: K.<z> = CyclotomicField(5) # or perhaps something simpler
sage: EK = E.change_ring(K)
sage: PK = EK([0,0])
sage: PK.height()
0.0511114082399688
sage: PK.height(normalised=False)
0.204445632959875

I added an additional bugfix and doctest in the patch trac_13951_extra.patch.

Peter, there's a patch by you not listed in the description.  Is that intended to be applied too?

Good!

No, the idea of that patch was to mark some docstring because of an accented character, but it did the wrong thing (using `r"""`, which just prevents backslashes from being interpreted).  In fact, nothing had to be done since the file was already UTF-8-encoded.

I assume Jeroen Demeyer's comment on sage-support when you mentioned this ticket
(https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/xe69MXW0aSE) qualifies as such!
