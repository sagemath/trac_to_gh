CC:  @ppurka @dimpase @vbraun

The default rings `RR` and `CC` do not support eigenvalue and eigenvector computations for all the cases. It varies from matrix to matrix, and hence these fields shouldn't be encouraged for eigenvalue/eigenvector computations. I am adding a patch to the tutorial which mentions `RDF` and `CDF` as the go-to field for such computations.
