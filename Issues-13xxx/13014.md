At the moment, we can do 

```
sage: gcd(2/3, 4/5)
2/15
sage: lcm(2/3, 4/5)
4
sage: gcd(2/3, 4/5) * lcm(2/3, 4/5) == 2/3*4/5
True
```

but

```
sage: gcd(SR(2/3), SR(4/5))
2/15
sage: lcm(SR(2/3), SR(4/5))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

   1646                 return ZZ(a).lcm(ZZ(b))
   1647             except TypeError:

   1649         return LCM(b)
   1650 

TypeError: unable to find lcm of 2/3 and 4/5

```

We can improve the symmetry just by trying QQ instead of ZZ, as discussed in the comments to #10771.

<a id='comment:9'></a>REFEREE REPORT:

Sorry, but I have a few issues...

* Doing this is a sort of gotcha mistake in Python:

```
raise TypeError("unable to find gcd of %s and %s"%(a,b))
```
The problem is that the error message may take a very, very long time to generate.  The error should just be `TypeError("unable to compute gcd")`.  Similar remarks for lcm.

* Give me an example in the docstring that illustrates every exception in your code actually getting raised.  If you can't, then maybe the code isn't needed.

* The bool in all your tests is not needed since nothing is symbolic in the comparison. E.g., 

```
sage: bool(gcd(2/5, 3/7) == gcd(SR(2/5), SR(3/7))) 
```
should be

```
sage: gcd(2/5, 3/7) == gcd(SR(2/5), SR(3/7))
```

Sorry, I was actually testing your code with lcm, and there the parent is **not** SR:

```
sage: parent(lcm(SR(2/5), SR(3/7)))
Rational Field
```
I thought your gcd would be the same.  It's bad that it isn't.     I think the answer should be in SR as you say, though.  So replace 3 by the error regarding the parent for lcm.

<a id='comment:23'></a>I think it should probably come out entirely.  What seems to be going on is that gcd is getting called during evaluation on a lot of floats, e.g.

```

sage: f = lambda t: 1/(t+pi)
sage: f(1.5r)               
GCDing 1 <type 'int'> 1 0 <type 'int'> 0

GCDing 1.5 <type 'float'> 1.5 1.0 <type 'float'> 1.0
returning on QQ 1/2
GCDing 3.0 <type 'float'> 3.0 2.0 <type 'float'> 2.0
returning on ZZ 1
```
