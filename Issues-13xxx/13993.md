Looks like this patch should be rebased !

Otherwise : 

```
[ (v,w,l) for (v,w),l in cover_labels.iteritems() ]
```
Looks more efficient than

```
[ (v,w,cover_labels[(v,w)]) for (v,w) in cover_labels ]
```
But what you want to do, I think, is this :

```
for u,v in graph.edges(labels = False):
    graph.set_edge_label(cover_labels.get((u,v),''))
```

And that also means that you do not need to use a boolean cover_labels variable anymore.

Yes. I know. Who the hell cares ?
It's just that it hurts to see computers do more things that they need to. But of course it will not make the slightest difference in speed.
Of course `:-P`

For me personally, it hurts even more to see humans spending time on implementing things that do not make the slightest difference ;-)

If you feel like you wanna finish this patch, go ahead. Otherwise I will rebase it (and add your suggestions) when I find the time to do so (hopefully soon).

Yeessssssss, but come ooooooon !!! I work in a lab where basically everybody is paid to write "efficient algorithms" on papers, and I wouldn't replace a "nlog(n)" by a "n" when I can ? `:-P` 

> If you feel like you wanna finish this patch, go ahead. Otherwise I will rebase it (and add your suggestions) when I find the time to do so (hopefully soon).


Nono, I don't need it. I just happened to find a patch that needed review and that I could understand, sooooo... `:-)`

See youuuuuuuuuuuuuu !

Hello again !

The branch looks good.

There are many functions in the graph code that are meant to associate values to the edges, and we never exactly know whether we should only accept dict-only input and ask the user to convert his to that, or if we should do what you did, i.e. reproduce almost the same code for all different inputs.

Perhaps in this case it is more justified than in others, as it is a very simple function (plot) that beginners will probably use too.

Anyway. Good to go.

Nathann
