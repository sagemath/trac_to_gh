Something is wrong with the patch at #13579. This breaks the patchbot on Fedora:

```
(sage-sh) patchbot@volker-desktop:sage$ python -Werror -c ''
RuntimeWarning: not adding directory '' to sys.path since it's writable by an untrusted group.
Untrusted users could put files in this directory which might then be imported by your Python code. As a general precaution from similar exploits, you should not execute Python code from this directory

```

Hugh, could you provide the same information as Volker (`umask`, group ids, permissions of the relevant directory).

Also, Volker and Hugh: which version of Sage are you talking about?  In particular, is #13459 applied?

I can get the same error without the patchbot.

I get the same output from the above commands (ls, etc.) in sage-main as in sage-0. 

It works fine if I run sage -t from ~/sage-5.4.rc2.  There, I get:
