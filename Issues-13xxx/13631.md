Something is wrong with the patch at #13579. This breaks the patchbot on Fedora:

Hugh, could you provide the same information as Volker (`umask`, group ids, permissions of the relevant directory).

Also, Volker and Hugh: which version of Sage are you talking about?  In particular, is #13459 applied?

I was running 5.4.rc2.  

I'm not sure which directory is relevant. The directory which it refused to run doctests in was one that had just been created by the patchbot, /home/hugh/sage-5.4.rc2/devel/sage-0.  In that directory, I get the following:

```
hugh@hugh-laptop:~/sage-5.4.rc2/devel$ cd sage-0/
hugh@hugh-laptop:~/sage-5.4.rc2/devel/sage-0$ ls -ald .

I don't know what the output from these commands means, so please let me know if you need more or different information.

I can get the same error without the patchbot.

```
hugh@hugh-laptop:~$ cd sage-5.4.rc2/devel/sage-main/

RuntimeError: refusing to run doctests from the current directory '/home/hugh/sage-5.4.rc2/devel/sage-main' since untrusted users could put files in this directory, making it unsafe to run Sage code from
```

I get the same output from the above commands (ls, etc.) in sage-main as in sage-0. 

It works fine if I run sage -t from ~/sage-5.4.rc2.  There, I get:

```
hugh@hugh-laptop:~/sage-5.4.rc2$ ls -ald .
drwxr-xr-x 9 hugh hugh 4096 2012-10-20 22:44 .
```

I get same error as above if I run sage -t from ~/sage-5.4.rc2/devel, where the output from ls -ald ., etc., looks very similar.  to sage-5.4.rc2/devel/sage-main.
