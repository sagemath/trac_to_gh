Yes. It is mpl code that is the problem here. Quoting from [mpl docs](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/mlab_api.html#matplotlib.mlab.griddata),

''
If interp keyword is set to ‘nn‘ (default), uses natural neighbor interpolation based on Delaunay triangulation. By default, this algorithm is provided by the matplotlib.delaunay package, written by Robert Kern. The triangulation algorithm in this package is known to fail on some nearly pathological cases. For this reason, a separate toolkit (mpl_tookits.natgrid) has been created that provides a more robust algorithm fof triangulation and interpolation. This toolkit is based on the NCAR natgrid library, which contains code that is not redistributable under a BSD-compatible license. When installed, this function will use the mpl_toolkits.natgrid algorithm, otherwise it will use the built-in matplotlib.delaunay package.
''

So, essentially the delaunay code is not considered very robust.

Now, I had a look at the `natgrid` code and there is one file's license which is the main problem I think, and due to which I believe it won't be possible to distribute/include it in Sage.

I can't remember the context for this trac ticket. Are you suggesting that we remove the code in Sage which checks for duplicate points?

I was saying that maybe we don't need to add noise any more.  But upon further review, the commit in question was about duplicate points, not points in the same subspace, so we probably still need the randomization for now.  I don't know if we have code checking for duplicates.
