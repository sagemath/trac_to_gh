ok, here is a short review patch of your code.

I have removed trailing whitespaces that you had introduced, and made small changes to the code. I have also made sure that each method starts with a brief (one-line) description of what it does. Details are then given on other lines.

I would prefer not to propose the use of another variable in the code, but rather give no option. The user will get a polynomial, that he can then evaluate on whatever he wants. I think this keeps the code cleaner and shorter.

Combining patches is indeed easy, and can be done just once when everything is ready.

Hello !

Would it be possible to add definitions of what these polynomials are, possibly as links toward wikipedia pages ?

I also think that you should cache minimal and maximal elements in the code of `remove_top_and_bottom`, otherwise you compute the maximal and minimal elements for each vertex :

```
sage: def a():                                 
....:     print "Hey"
....:     return [1]
....: 
sage: [x for x in range(5) if x in a()]
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
[1]
```

Hence if you want to write this function, this really should not be computed so many times.

Besides : you only implement this method for bounded posets, which means that there is one max and one min elements. Hence this complicated line only checks that each vertex is different from two given vertices.

I personally do not think that this `remove_top_and_bottom` method is useful, especially when it build a copy of the whole poset, which can be very costly. You would probably save yourself a lot of time if you worked on `self` in each of your methods, and just ignored the top and bottom elements. No copies of the poset, no call to `remove_to_and_bottom` either.

Oh, and Florent thinks that it would be nice to add "seealso" sections toward "is_bounded", or toward polynomials that are related with each other.

See youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuUU !!

Nathann

What about making it an option of "chains" ?

UPDATED! everything reviewed, except for the two flag_* functions which I don't really understand nor can find a reference for.

Thanks, Nathan, for alerting me to this patch!

The file I just attached gives a review of everything but the two flag polynomials (f and h) which I couldn't find in literature. Please give a reference or a full definition (how exactly are those monomials built from the ranks etc.).

#13223 notwithstanding, I've replaced the hyperpolynomial-time `is_graded` method by a polynomial-time (and memory) one. Speed comparisons:

before:

```
sage: B2 = Posets.BooleanLattice(2)
sage: %timeit B2.is_graded()
10000 loops, best of 3: 84.9 us per loop
sage: B3 = Posets.BooleanLattice(3)
sage: %timeit B3.is_graded()
10000 loops, best of 3: 195 us per loop
sage: B4 = Posets.BooleanLattice(4)
sage: %timeit B4.is_graded()
1000 loops, best of 3: 663 us per loop
sage: B5 = Posets.BooleanLattice(5)
sage: %timeit B5.is_graded()
100 loops, best of 3: 2.86 ms per loop
sage: B6 = Posets.BooleanLattice(6)
sage: %timeit B6.is_graded()
100 loops, best of 3: 16 ms per loop
sage: B7 = Posets.BooleanLattice(7)
sage: %timeit B7.is_graded()
10 loops, best of 3: 109 ms per loop
sage: P = Poset({1: [2, 3], 3: [4, 5], 2: [6]})
sage: %timeit P.is_graded()
10000 loops, best of 3: 103 us per loop
sage: C = Poset([list(B7) + [1337], B7.cover_relations() + [[127, 1337]]])
sage: %timeit C.is_graded()
10 loops, best of 3: 146 ms per loop
```

after:

```
sage: B2 = Posets.BooleanLattice(2)
sage: %timeit B2.is_graded()
10000 loops, best of 3: 82.3 us per loop
sage: B3 = Posets.BooleanLattice(3)
sage: %timeit B3.is_graded()
10000 loops, best of 3: 149 us per loop
sage: B4 = Posets.BooleanLattice(4)
sage: %timeit B4.is_graded()
1000 loops, best of 3: 290 us per loop
sage: B5 = Posets.BooleanLattice(5)
sage: %timeit B5.is_graded()
1000 loops, best of 3: 525 us per loop
sage: B6 = Posets.BooleanLattice(6)
sage: %timeit B6.is_graded()
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.02 ms per loop
sage: B7 = Posets.BooleanLattice(7)
sage: %timeit B7.is_graded()
100 loops, best of 3: 2.07 ms per loop
sage: P = Poset({1: [2, 3], 3: [4, 5], 2: [6]})
sage: %timeit P.is_graded()
10000 loops, best of 3: 108 us per loop
sage: C = Poset([list(B7) + [1337], B7.cover_relations() + [[127, 1337]]])
sage: %timeit C.is_graded()
100 loops, best of 3: 2.14 ms per loop
```

Also I have optimized the polynomial-computing methods (apart from the ones I don't understand) by letting them work with the `_hasse_diagram` of the poset rather than the poset itself, because all methods that are used (minimal elements, top, Moebius etc.) currently work by calling the corresponding methods on the Hasse diagram and then relabelling vertices back. This also fixes the issue of `chain_polynomial` throwing errors if the poset wasn't labelled 0,1,...,n (one of the doctests I made checks for this now).

Probably someone will have to review my review...

Thanks Darij, for your review patch.

Your review looks good to me.

concerning flag f-vector and flag h-vector, there is something here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-vector#Flag_h-vector_and_cd-index

It can also probably go through the hasse diagram.

Hi Frederic,

I've completed my review, editing again all four f/h-polynomials (flag and usual). Please check that:

1) the definitions I've added to the docstring are correct (I have deduced them from the implementation, except for the size-1 poset case which I just found had to give 1 for reasons of consistency);

2) all four methods return what they should in the case of a poset with 1 vertex (this is doctested, but I don't know if it's what you want);

3) you really want the flag h-polynomial to be returned as a polynomial over QQ, even if it has integer coefficients.

If these are fine, feel free to set this to positive review!
