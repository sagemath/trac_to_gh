```
Finite unions of open/closed/semi-closed subsets of the real line, for example

```
    sage: RealSet(0,2) + RealSet.unbounded_above_closed(10)
    (0, 2) + [10, +Infinity)
```

This ticket also encountered a number of bugs in the comparison of infinity with various field elements like

```
sage: RLF(0) < oo
False
```
These are now also fixed and extensive doctests were added.

In fact, maybe these should inherit from something related to that... probably not, but just raising the possibility.

How do I get more exotic sets like the union of `1/n` for positive integer n?  ;-)

It think it is better to stick to the category of finite unions of intervals and points, then with functions defined on such sets and their periodic extensions (like 1 on [0, 1], 0 on (1,2), then extend periodically in one or both directions to get square wave).

Things with infinite unions lead to accumulation points and cannot really be handled in a uniform way, I suspect.

<div id="comment:20" align="right">comment:20</div>

It fails in OSX 10.7.5 too.
The error seems to be in the comparation involving one `sage.rings.real_lazy.LazyWrapper` instance:

```
sage: s1 = RealSet(0,2) + RealSet.unbounded_above_closed(10);  s1
(0, 2) + [10, +oo)
sage: s2 = RealSet(1,3) + RealSet.unbounded_below_closed(-10);  s2
(-oo, -10] + (1, 3)
sage: s1.intersection(s2)
(-oo, -10] + (1, 2)
```
Not right. Look at the intersection of the first intervals:

```
sage: i1 = s1._intervals[0]; i1
(0, 2)
sage: i2 = s2._intervals[0]; i2
(-oo, -10]
sage: i1.intersection(i2)
(-oo, -10]
```
Wrong. Compare the bounds:

```
sage: (i1._lower, i2._lower)
(0, -Infinity)
sage: cmp(i1._lower, i2._lower)
-1
sage: i1._lower < i2._lower
True
```
It doesn't fail for floats or integers:

```
sage: 0.0 < i2._lower
False
sage: type(i1._lower), type(i2._lower)
(sage.rings.real_lazy.LazyWrapper, sage.rings.infinity.MinusInfinity)
```

I don't like this change:

```diff
+        elif isinstance(x, sage.rings.real_mpfi.RealIntervalFieldElement):
+            if x.upper().is_infinity() or x.lower().is_infinity():
                 return self.gen()
```
since `RIF(0, oo)` gets turned into infinity (where is very likely to not be):

```
sage: UnsignedInfinityRing(RIF(2, oo))
Infinity
```
I think we should follow the usual paradigm for RIF:

```
sage: RIF(2, 4) == 4
False
sage: RIF(2, 4) <= 4
True
sage: RIF(2, 4) < 4
False
sage: RIF(2) == 2
True
```
So I would say this is wrong:

```
sage: RIF(2, oo) == oo
True
```
and I would raise an error anytime we're converting something which is not directly equal to a (signed) infinity. For example:

```
sage: UnsignedInfinityRing(RIF(2, oo))
Infinity
```
should raise an error, but this would be okay:

```
sage: UnsignedInfinityRing(RIF(oo, oo))
Infinity
```

I forgot that SR can also represent infinity and **conversion** to the infinity ring should work. For SR there is no coercion to the infinity ring since SR wants to handle its own infinities (in fact: the infinity ring coerces into SR).

Arguably that should be changed and SR also coerce into the infinity ring instead of the other way round. But then SR wouldn't be able to react to things like `oo * x`. Downside of the current way is 

```
sage: bool(SR(-1000) > oo), bool(SR(-1000) < oo)
(False, False)
```
i.e. SR doesn't know how to decide this rather simple inequality. In any case, thats for another ticket.

I'm mostly happy with the fixes related to infinity, although we are nowhere close to fixing all the bugs in #11506.  Of the examples listed there, the following one is changed by this ticket:

```
sage: InfinityRing(CC(oo))
A positive finite number
```
This used to return `+Infinity`, which is not perfect either, but is at least consistent with `InfinityRing(UnsignedInfinity(oo))`.  (I'd argue that both of these should probably be undefined, since complex and unsigned infinity are in no way more positive than negative.)

Could you fix the above example to return `+Infinity` again?

I leave it to someone else to review the new code for real sets.  It would have been better if the infinity-related stuff had been done on a separate ticket.

I let this slip off, sorry Volker. I think there should be no coercion because there is no way to deal with these (semi)infinite intervals. However if we are forced to make this a coercion, then it should be less than infinity since my (very anecdotal) evidence says that most computations won't escape to `oo`, but instead just don't have a good upper bound.

That being said, I think this should not be positively reviewed as it stands.

Do you think Nils would be a good person to ask about this, someone else, or go directly to sage-devel?
