See #13137 for more info.
This is true with different versions of MPIR so seems to be because of zn_poly and not of MPIR.
No problems where spotted on Linuces.

Does it really segfault, and especially does *the tuning* segfault?

I thought zn_poly would just occasionally generate "unexpected<sup>TM</sup>" values during tuning on MacOS X and Cygwin (presumably only under heavy system load), such that afterwards *some tests* (with zn_poly rebuilt, or more precisely, relinked with these paramaters) would deterministically fail.

(This might still depend on the compiler as well, at least *the way* it fails.)

How?  I tried hard yesterday, but didn't manage.

Even with [John's tuning parameters](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/tuning.c-FAILED) that made the test(s) fail for him, still all tests (quick as well as extensive) pass for me on bsd.math (with Sage 5.6.beta3 [with GCC 4.6.3 built], and the included MPIR 2.4.0, FWIW).

I was actually hoping we could reproduce the test failures on e.g. Linux as well with such "failing" parameters, although probably depending on the GCC version, too.

Hmmm, I probably forgot to run `make test` (which rebuilds `test/test` with a *debug version* of `src/tuning.c`) in addition to `make` (which apparently just rebuilds the static library, not used by `test`; IMHO a flaw in the Makefiles).

But still, I cannot reproduce the failure with John's parameters.

IIRC (and I'm quite sure I am) I got segfault as well during the tuning itself on Cygwin (64bits Windows 7), mostly when issuing make with MAKE="make -j4" so the system must have been busy as well, but IIRC (less sure) it also happened when building zn_poly alone.

The segfaults happened while tuning KS/FFT things, mostly the last one which is mulmid, but I seem to tremember it also happened during the previous KS/FFT things sometimes.

Of course I tried to reproduce that this morning and could not (I let ATLAS build in parallel to keep the system busy but that did not seem to do the trick).

I'll give it another shot in the next couple of days.

Could you give it a shot by only testing the MPIR part and disabling the comparison in the test code?
And do the same with zn_poly code only?
So if it's really a bug in MPIR, or calling a function on invalid (let's say really too small) parameters we'll be settled.

???

It's just the comparison that fails (or, more precisely, the tests make the "success" depend on the comparison only); no segfaults, no failed assertions.

I removed the "exit on first failure" and got 5 failures (from the "extensive" `nuss_mul()` test; all other tests passed, as mentioned).

> So if it's really a bug in MPIR, or calling a function on invalid (let's say really too small) parameters we'll be settled.

Well, since the failure depends on **zn_poly's thresholds** (for *zn_poly's* functions), it's IMHO clearly in zn_poly, not MPIR.  (Unless zn_poly was right only with the "failing" tuning parameters, and incidentally MPIR [2.4.0 and 2.6.0] and zn_poly would give the same wrong results otherwise.  Or am I missing something?)

There are still random numbers involved though, so the tests may pass or fail under different circumstances.

The offending parameter in John's `tuning.c` seems to be `tuning_info[62].mul_fft_thresh` (=90, which is extraordinarily low), i.e., that's the one that (for me) causes the `nuss_mul()` test failures here.

When I set all `mul_fft_thresh`s to 1, I get a lot more failures (although not all tests/comparisons fail).

More interestingly, the failures only happen when squaring.  If I use *separate* "buffers" for both operands (in `test/nuss-test.c`), all failures vanish, so this seems to be an aliasing problem.

I also get the quick test to fail with all (2...64 bits) `mul_fft_thresh` entries set to 1.

And I meanwhile managed to get "invalid" tuning parameters on Linux x86_64, too (although just once, but unintentionally).

I don't think the bug (or test failure) is in any way related to the compiler / GCC version or compilation options, as I've so far been able to force it with every GCC version I tried (4.4.3, 4.6.3, 4.7.0, 4.7.2), regardless of whether I used e.g. `-O0` or `-O3`, or `-fno-strict-aliasing`.

Still don't know whether (just) `testcase_nuss_mul()` is broken (in violating preconditions by using the same array for both [identical] operands when squaring [`sqr==1`], although assertion checking is enabled when compiling for the `test` program), or whether it actually triggers a real bug by doing so.  Someone more knowledgable than me should probably check this.

[As mentioned, all failures vanish when `buf1 != buf2`, i.e., when they don't alias even if `sqr==1`.]

Oh, I don't recall right now (searching logs ...), but I think I just faked the values in `tuning.c` (generated by `tune/tune[.c]`) by modifying `test/test.c` (i.e., added something like `{ int i; for (i=2;i<=64;i++) tuning_info[i].mul_fft_thresh=1; }` to the beginning of `test/test.c`(?)'s `main()`).

After running `sage -f -s zn_poly`, start a Sage subshell and enter the build directory.

Then you can play with it, i.e., modify the code (or tuning values), and run `make test && test/test [-quick] [tests_to_run]*` (in `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/build/zn_poly-0.9.p{9,10}/src/`) IIRC.

(More to come if I find the logs, otherwise also see the comments above for more info.)

Confirm what exactly?

Tuning fails if the box is too busy?  And if so, how?

Building itself (before and/or after tuning) can also fail?

Or does just the quick test after "successfully" building zn_poly fail (due to failing comparisons, as intended, or with a segfault or whatever)?

Correct; with one other spkg being built it was too much.  Segfault during tuning in KS/FFT mul, repeatable.  No problems during short self-test, though of course I couldn't try that without using just one thread in any case.

Hi, I am the original author.

I have debugged this issue outside of sage, using the version of zn_poly 0.9 on my web page. I can reproduce the issue with "test/test nuss_mul" on sage.math (or maybe I've logged into boxen?), using the tuning file provided by wdj above.

After some debugging, I have found a genuine bug in the test code. In nuss-test.c, line 60 currently reads

```
   ulong x = nuss_mul_fudge (lgL, 0, mod);
```
It should be

``` 
   ulong x = nuss_mul_fudge (lgL, sqr, mod);
```

Basically what's happening is that `nuss_mul` returns its results multiplied by a fudge factor, and the test code has to undo that fudge factor to compare the results. The current version always uses the thresholds from the "multiplication" version of the code to figure out the fudge factor. But when sqr == 1, it should be using the "squaring" thresholds.

Please let me know if that solves the problem.

Ok, did so.

You can now install the spkg with `ZN_POLY_FAKE_THRESHOLDS` set to something non-empty to set all `mul_fft_thresh`s to 1, [as I previously did to provoke failures](#comment%3A22).

(Even) with this, the "quick" test suite (still) passes for me now.

Further changes for debugging:  Failures in `test_nuss_mul()` now get reported, and the test suite doesn't exit on the first failure, but continues testing.  (Especially `test_nuss_mul()` now performs all tests regardless of failures.)

Feel free to change `patches/conditionally_fake_mul_fft_threshs.patch` to fake other tuning parameters as well; as the name says, I'm only changing `tuning_info[2..64].mul_fft_thresh` since doing so previously triggered failures for me.

Ok, did so, see [attached diff](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13947/zn_poly-0.9.p10-p11.diff).

I agree that tuning on heavily loaded OS X systems has not been addressed.

I also don't know about any segfaults.

Anyway, I tried building the old and new spkgs on a loaded OS X system. I could not reproduce any failures in the quick test suite, but the old spkg reliably failed its full test-suite, while the new spkg reliably passed its full test suite.

klee, can you test it out, too?

Interim report:

1) Making Sage 5.10.beta2 again, I checked it fails at the same spot, zn_poly's quick test suite, with "null_mul()... FAIL!".

2) I installed the new spkg with the command "./sage -f http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/zn_poly-0.9.p11.spkg" and succeeded. It passed the zn_poly's quick test suite smoothly!

3) Now my machine is making Sage 5.10.beta2. 

4) Then I downloaded Sage 5.10.beta4, the latest, and replaced zn_poly-0.9.p10.spkg with zn_poly-0.9.p11.spkg in the directory spkg/standard. Then I started making Sage 5.10.beta4. So now my machine is making both beta2 and beta4 at the same time. Perhaps this makes sure the machine is quite loaded. Also the machine is running two virtual machines and some usual applications like Chrome browser.

I will report the final result as soon as the machin finishes building!

By the way, thank you all so much.

**package** `sage-5.10.beta4` = the Sage library spkg failed to install, so apparently zn_poly did install successfully, as the former depends on the latter.

On the other hand, (re)installing zn_poly afterwards (with just `sage -i ...`) should have just told you that it's already installed, which you at least did not explicitly mention.

(But you said you copied the `.p11` into `spkg/standard/` before building Sage 5.10.beta4.)

Yes, I copied `.p11` into `spkg/standard/` and removed `.p10` before I started building Sage 5.10.beta4.

Sorry that I don't remember the reason of the failure of beta4. The message was somewhat unclear to me, but seemed unrelated with zn_poly. Now I am building beta4 to reproduce the failure.

I used "sage -i" rather than "sage -f", and remember the installation of the spkg started as if it was not done before. On this point, I am not so confident of my own memory though. Anyway, the installation was successful.

This is both unrelated to zn_poly and hardly related to Sage 5.10.beta4.

Outdated `init.sage`?  Cf. #14217, merged into Sage 5.10.beta3.

P.S.:  The relevant "layout" change was announced (or suggested) on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/56f410b9f5bd9eac#) a while ago.

I successfully installed Sage-5.10.rc0 without the zn_poly failure issue. (the error after starting Sage as reported in a previous comment was just because of my own out-dated scripts, and is irrelevant with this ticket. Sorry for the noise.)

Thanks a lot!
