`IntegerListsLex` has some issues with finiteness:

```
sage: L = IntegerListsLex(NonNegativeIntegers(), max_length=3, ceiling=lambda i: 3)
sage: L
Integer lists of sum in <class 'sage.sets.non_negative_integers.NonNegativeIntegers'> satisfying certain constraints
sage: for x in L:
....:
[]
[1]
[0, 1]
[0, 0, 1]
...
[3, 3, 2]
[3, 2, 3]
[2, 3, 3]
[3, 3, 3]
# Continues looping for forever (which I guess is okay)
sage: L.is_finite()
True
sage: L.category()
Category of finite enumerated sets

sage: L2 = IntegerListsLex(NonNegativeIntegers(), max_length=3)                   
sage: L2.is_finite()
True
sage: L2.category()
Category of finite enumerated sets
```
The last two are not correct, and this would likely need moderate checking of combinations of the input arguments.

Depends on #13605
