The following ticket aims at enhancing the is_vertex_transitive method and introducing new symmetry tests for graphs namely if a graph is edge-transitive, arc-transitive, half-transitive and semi-symmetric. 

I am still struggling to digest all sage development conventions so it might well be that the code is not yet in the proper format. I apologize for the inconvenience and hope someone can correct this.

Following are some comments related to the patch.

* is_vertex_transitive. This function has been changed so that it uses GAP to test transitivity. In addition a quick check for regularity has been added.  The change was tested using the following function 

```
def f(n):
    for i in xrange(1,n+1):
        c = 0 
        for el in graphs.nauty_geng(str(n)):
            if el.is_vertex_transitive():
                c+=1
        print i,c
``` 

and the results are 

%timeit f(10)
5 loops, best of 3: 567 s per loop 

for the old function and

%timeit f(10)
5 loops, best of 3: 222 s per loop 

for the improvement.


* is_edge_transitive. This new function tests if a graph is edge-transitive. The main idea of the this test was suggested by Tom Boothby, see this sage-devel [post](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-devel/b-wsvun9L7g).

* is_arc_transitive. Similar to the edge-transitive case. I believe there is a more efficient way to test for arc-transitivity but for now I suppose this one is good enough.

* is_half_transitive. This function tests if a graph is vertex and edge-transitive but not arc-transitive. As a speedup it uses the fact that a half-transitive graph is Eulerian (see Lemma 3.2.2 in the book Algebraic graph theory by Godsil and Royle.)

* is_semi_symmetric. Tests if a graph is regular, edge-transitive but not vertex-transitive. Again we use the fact that such graphs are always bipartite (Lemma 3.2.1 in Godsil & Royle) to speed up the test.

I haven't tested this, but I've got a couple of comments so far.

1. Edges of graphs can be labeled.  The graph `Graph([(0,1,0),(0,1,1)])` will be counted as edge-transitive by this implementation, which is wrong.  I recognize the irony of this: the slapdash code I posted to sage-devel has the same issue.  My recommendation is to add a parameter `edge_labels=True` because that's the default 'round these parts.  You'll get errors if unhashable edge labels are used, but that is also true of `line_graph` so I think this is acceptable.

2. I'd drop the `is_symmetric` alias.  That's partially motivated by my dislike for the term (full disclosure).  But it's mostly because the Graph class already has so many methods, we shouldn't frivolously add aliases.

3. It would be really nice if `is_arc_transitive` took an extra parameter so you could check if a graph is (for example) 2-arc transitive.

Hello!

1 . Is there any other way to solve 1. It seems like a serious limitation not to allow line graphs by default. Perhaps a careful relabelling of the graph?

2. I kind of a agree. I thought it might be useful since this patch already defines the notion of semi-symmetric graphs.

3. I agree I had that one in mind after this patch is pushed forward since I haven't worked with k-arc-transitive graphs yet and don't feel comfortable in writing a patch for it.

1.  There's been a misunderstanding here.  My point is that

```
sage: G = Graph([(0,1,[])])
sage: G.line_graph()
```

results in an error because lists are not hashable (and vertices of graphs must be hashable).  And so, I think that it's reasonable for the same graph to fail in other places because of the same reason.  Also, this should be documented.




2.  I'd like somebody else's opinion here.  I love the amount of stuff we can do with graphs... but I hate the length of the list. ;)

3.  Okay, yeah, I shouldn't be asking for new features.

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: L = G.line_graph()
sage: L.is_arc_transitive()

If so, then I believe this is a serious limitation that needs to be solved. I can see many real life scenarios in which one needs to these types of things on line graphs.

Hellooooooo Jernej !

First, thank you ver much for these patches ! I love to have fun with the graphs' automorphism groups these days -- though I really am a beginner -- and it is nice to see Sage improve on that side :-)

I have many questions, though :
* Why do you insist on returnin the group ? It feels like it is a very complicated object that shouldn't be built unless necessary :-)
  I do agree that the current implementation seems QUITE wasteful when just checking that a graph is indeed vertex_transitive. But I do not really get what the four lines after ``new_partition = ...`` actually do. Isn't it totally equivalent to check that the two partitions are equal up to reordering ? Something like that should do the trick, as (if I make no mistake) the partition can only be more refined than the one given as an input) : ``sorted(map(len,partition)) == sorted(map(len,new_partition))``
  And I expect that this plugged with the current code, should be faster than calling GAP :-)
* You write is_edge_transitive by copying the graph twice. Wouldn't it work to just build the automorphism group, and then ask GAP to give you the order or the Orbit of *only one edge* with the permutation group acts on it ? I think that this can be done (and probably faster), but I am a beginner with GAP so perhaps you are right.
* Not sure if this can also be done on is_arc_transitive, because we are not talking of sets anymore, but of ordered pairs.
* ``return self.is_edge_transitive() and self.is_vertex_transitive() and not self.is_arc_transitive()`` this line makes Sage compute the automorphism group 3 times, but I have no idea how bad it is. Perhaps not worth the trouble.
* ``is_symmetric`` I share Tom's advice on aliases `^^;`. His wording is actually very nice : "I love the amount of stuff we can do with graphs... but I hate the length of the list." `:-P`
* There are some problems with the documentation and doctests : the way it is written (the "::" are not placed where they should) many doctests do not appear correctly on the HTML documentation.
* The way it is written, the function is_edge_transitive is a member of DiGraph objects. When in doubt, the behaviour of the method should be made clear in the documentation. Or else we can move it to Graph.py `:-)`

Hello ncooohen!!1

Thank you for the review. Let me answer the points as posted by you.

1. I am not sure if this can be done without computing the automorphism of the group. Note however that the resulting group is represented with generators and is probably not that expensive. I have no clue what the partition thing is meant to do (most likely something related to the previous version of the code that computed orbits). What exactly do you mean by refined partition? I don't understand this part.

2. I agree. Though I am not sure how to get the orbit for an action that acts on edges (not on vertices.) I am not sure this is possible. Can someone verify this?

3. That is a good point! This could be solved by having an optional argument that supplies the automorphism group to the named functions!

4. Hahaha agree about the wording - I am waiting for the right time to tell it to someone IRL :-) 

5.
6. This should most likely be moved to Graph.py

Helloooooooooo !!

Well, I guess that it cannot, but it can be done without dealing manually in Sage with an automorphism group that is internally built by the automorphism_group function (possibly Nauty), even when return_group is set to False. From what I understand of the algorithm, the partition that is returned consists in the orbits of the graphs's vertices. Hence in our case, the graph is transitive if and only if the partition returned has only one element in it (--> the whole vertex set). When the partition given as an input is *NOT* this trivial partition, the algorithm considers that vertices from differents sets of the partition are of a different "kind" (or color, or type, or whatever) and returns the orbits of the graphs respecting the vertices' kind/color/type/whatever. The small patch I attach replaces a nasty loop by a unique line, and your example of code returns the same answers for the values I was able to compute, and all tests pass on all files of the graph/ folder `:-)`

> What exactly do you mean by refined partition ?

By "refined", I mean that each set of the new partition is a subset of one set of the former partition.

> 2. I agree. Though I am not sure how to get the orbit for an action that acts on edges (not on vertices.) I am not sure this is possible. Can someone verify this?


Well. I am no GAP expert but I used to use it with a guy who knew much better what he did with it, and I can still understand the code's meaning. What I have is the following : if G is a GAP Group acting on a set (of vertices), then you can compute the orbit of a pair of edges like that :

```
gap('Orbit(G,[1,6],OnSets)') 
```

And it looks like there is another keyword for ordered sets : OnTuples. There is even one made especially for pairs : OnPairs.
So I guess that gap('Orbit(G,my_edge,OnSets)') would do the trick for edge-transitivity, and gap('Orbit(G,my_edge,OnPairs)') for arc-transitivity `:-)`

Argggggggg.... Nasty TRAC. There is no "question mark". They keywords are ``OnSets``, ``OnTuples`` and ``OnPairs``.

Hello!

Nathan, I have now modified the patch to use your suggestion. That is, the code now directly uses gap OrbitLength on sets/tuples to decide if a graph is edge/arc-transitive.

Comments and suggestions are appreciated!

Helloooooooooo Jernej ! I loooooooooooooove this patch, thank you so much for working on it ! `:-D`

Several comments :
* You make useless copies of the graph. The purpose of these two lines 

```
G = self.relabel(T,inplace=False) 
e = list(G.edges(labels=False)[0])
```
  is just to get ONE edge of the graph with 0...n-1 coordinates !! To do this, you copy the whole graph with the first line, get the list of ALL EDGES in the second line, and ignore them all to only get the first of them. What's the point ? You can get the same result with this :

```
e = self.edge_iterator(labels = False).next()
e = T[e[0]], T[e[1]]
```
* You can replace 

```
if not self.is_eulerian(): 
   return False  
return self.is_edge_transitive() and self.is_vertex_transitive() and not self.is_arc_transitive()
```
  by 

```
return self.is_eulerian() and self.is_edge_transitive() and self.is_vertex_transitive() and not self.is_arc_transitive()
```
  Or rather (to make it easier to read) :

```
return (self.is_eulerian() and 
        self.is_edge_transitive() and
        self.is_vertex_transitive() and
        not self.is_arc_transitive())
```
  (and the same goes for `is_semi_symmetric`).
* The documentation of `is_half_transitive` and `is_semi_symmetric` appears to be wrong. When you have a `::` somewhere, what should follow is an indented block of Sage code. And the result should appear nicely in the output of `sage -docbuild reference html` (that's the point of these `::` commands).
* Your functions are added to the file `generic_graph.py` which means that they will also be methods of `DiGraphs` objects. Could you add to the docstring of `is_edge_transitive` and `is_arc_transitive` an explanation of their meaning when `self` is a DiGraph ? The expected meaning of `is_edge_transitive` for DiGraphs is actually the one obtained by `is_arc_transitive`. Or do you think that `is_edge_transitive` should only be a method of `Graph` ?

Thank you again for this patch ! I'll be glad to see it in Sage `:-)`

Hello Mr. Cohen!!!1

Thanks for the review! I have implemented the suggested changes (whoops for the relabel thing :) ) except the one of "merging" is_eulerian() with the other conditions for is_semi_symmetric (and other analogues of this.)

The reason being that by definition a graph is semi-symmetric if it is edge/vertex-transitive and not arc-transitive. And this is one logical condition. The other (being an Eulerian graph) is just an optimization since a semi-symmetric graph is always Eulerian and is somehow a different logical unit than the direct definition of a semi-symmetric graph. So I much rather like it to be separate for clarity sake and in case some other guys will add additional optimizations like that in the near future.

Let me know if you still think its better to mix all conditions together!

PS. I believe I have now fixed the documentation but I was not able to test it (doing things on a remote shell and its a mess to copy the files up and down). Hopefully its fine now.

I wrote a patch ([attachment:trac_13721-rev.patch]) that changes the following :
* The links toward the methods were broken (they point toward `GenericGraph` while the methods are now in `Graph`)
* `def is_edge_transitive` was not properly indented.
* adds documentation to all methods
* fixes Sphinx problems

And I just noticed that after all that the patch does not work....

Helloooooooo again !

Well, the patch still does not apply on Sage even if that is no big deal (the last version is 5.6.beta1 and not 5.4, see [1]), but I have another question : why do you prefer to use {{{
new_partition, T = self.automorphism_group(partition,translation=True)
new_partition.is_transitive(domain=[T[x] for x in cell])
}}}
rather than 

```
new_partition, T = self.automorphism_group(partition,return_group=False,translation=True)
len(partition)=len(new_partition)
```
As I understand it, `new_partition` is necessarily more refined than `partition`, and they have the same length if and only if the group of automorphisms of `G` which respect `partition` has as orbits the list `partition`, which is exactly what we want `O_o`

By the way, as it is the variable that you name `new_partition` is not a partition, but a Group.

Hellooooooooooooooooo !

We can do as you say, but in that case I will create a ticket afterward to fix only that part, for I believe I should be simplified `:-)`

As for DiGraph objects, we can indeed use is_vertex_transitive on them (and it makes sense !)

```
sage: d = DiGraph()
sage: d.add_edge(0,1)
sage: d.is_vertex_transitive()
False
sage: d.add_edge(1,0)         
sage: d.is_vertex_transitive()
True
```

FML. I am so bad with this revision system thing (somehow it produced the wrong patch)

I have now removed the vertex-transitive thing out completely. Let us ship just the additional symmetries test here and consider the VT case separately.
