LinBox does not build with MPIR > 2.5.0 because the interface for Sage, in interface/linbox-sage.[C|h] includes some headers file in a problematic order:
* first "gmp.h" without "stdint.h", so functions related to "stdint.h" types are not defined
* at some point "stdint.h" through other linbox header files (if available) 
* then "linbox/integer.h" which in turn includes "gmp++/gmp++.h" which includes "gmpxx.h"
As "stdint.h" was included in the way, the C++ wrapper look for the C functions related to "stdint.h" types, but these were not defined.

I've reported this on linbox-devel as well, now waiting for reactions there, but this looks clean enough to become needs_review anyway.

Replying to [kcrisman](#comment%3A5):
> On Cygwin on XP, linbox-1.3.2 built fine with mpir-2.6.0.p0.  So maybe this isn't always necessary, but whatever.

That's some header inclusion black magic, so if somehow stdint.h was included before, the patch won't be needed.
But it should be safer with the patch.
