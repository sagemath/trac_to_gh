```
LinBox does not build with MPIR > 2.5.0 because the interface for Sage, in interface/linbox-sage.[C|h] includes some headers file in a problematic order:
* first "gmp.h" without "stdint.h", so functions related to "stdint.h" types are not defined
* at some point "stdint.h" through other linbox header files (if available) 
* then "linbox/integer.h" which in turn includes "gmp++/gmp++.h" which includes "gmpxx.h"
As "stdint.h" was included in the way, the C++ wrapper look for the C functions related to "stdint.h" types, but these were not defined.

After discussing this on mpir-devel, it appears it does not hurt and is even a good idea to prevent this in LinBox itself (although some workaround could also appear in MPIR later):

I've reported this on linbox-devel as well, now waiting for reactions there, but this looks clean enough to become needs_review anyway.

That's some header inclusion black magic, so if somehow stdint.h was included before, the patch won't be needed.
But it should be safer with the patch.
