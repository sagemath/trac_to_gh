I have found the following :

```
sage: w,z=var('w','z')
sage: solve([z-4,w-3],[z,w])
[[z == 4, w == 3]]
sage: solve([z-4],z)                                       
[z == 4]
sage: solve([z-4,z-2],z)
[]
sage: solve([z-4,z-2],[z])
[]
sage: solve([z-4],[z])
TypeError: [z] is not a valid variable.
```

The last line is a really ***bad*** behaviour ! It forces to distinguish the case when there is only one equation and one variable. Compare also with the first solve.
