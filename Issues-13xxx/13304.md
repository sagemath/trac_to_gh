As reported in a [thread in sage-support](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/jlLTyY-8H8c/discussion) trivial scalar multiplication in `FreeModule_ambient` can be extremely slow or lead to out of memory errors:

```
n = 10000
v = vector([0]*n)   # ok so far
v2 = v/1            # kaboom
```

The problem is that, during coercion, `_an_element_impl()` and in turn `gen(0)` of `FreeModule_ambient` gets called. The default implementation of `gen` calls `basis()`, computing the entire standard basis, and then returns the first basis vector.

If I understand correctly, the basis we are talking about is essentially the identity matrix. In fact, I am not convinced caching it (strongly at least) is such a good idea even in general—either recomputing it or computing whatever information one really needs instead sounds better in all cases I can think of. But in any case I think it is insane to call a function that may keep in cache a basis of, say, ℤ<sup>10000</sup>, unless one absolutely needs the whole basis!

Hello,

You got it right for integer vectors but the generic constructor of `FreeModuleElement_generic_dense` does call the basis in a very stupid way

```
    coefficient_ring = parent.basis()[0][0].parent()
```
In particular the following also takes life time for the very same reason

```
sage: V = ZZ['x']^50000
sage: V([0]*50000)
```

```

Since this ticket looks quite independent of #17585, it makes sense to have both.
