```
This works:

```
sage: sr = mq.SR(1,2,2,4,gf2=True, polybori=True, order='deglex')
sage: F,s = sr.polynomial_system()
sage: F.eliminate_linear_variables()
Polynomial Sequence with 103 Polynomials in 55 Variables
```

This doesn't:

```
sage: sr = mq.SR(1,2,2,4,gf2=True, polybori=True, order='degrevlex')
sage: F,s = sr.polynomial_system()                                  
sage: F.eliminate_linear_variables()                                
...
IndexError: index of root must be less than the values of roots of the branches.

Thanks, the code indeed assumes that the indices really
coincide with the diag. structure, i.e. are consistent (all index accessing functions
give really the same result).
`top_index  <-> .navigation().value()`, 
or `v.index()`
which are really the same, if you don't do anything,
more problematics looks `iter(Monomial(v).variables()).next().index()` to be the same (but does not seem to be the problem).
Moreover, we assume here that indices coincide with diag structure (i.e. < relation on indices has a meaning).

Be aware that in this case code is broken while in other cases it might be just extremely slow when using wrong indices.
I must say that I have extreme 	 bellyache for this index game. I appreciate all efforts on the topic.

I was afraid of asking it. We would really prefer doing so.
I understand that it's a lack of convenience, but still nothing is worth the trouble.
