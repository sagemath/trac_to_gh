* I tested the patch using Sage 5.5.
  * It is well documented and it solves the bug as far as I can see.
  * The documentation builds.

But I am not convinced that the implementation of NumberField_cyclotomic._log_gen should stay like it is. It is a private method but it might be used within the class for ther purposes later. Therefore, I think the output should always make sense. But it doesn't always and it is not completely consistent. Here is an Example.

This is what I expect from the documentation:

```
 sage: K.<zeta>=CyclotomicField(5, embedding=CC(exp(2*pi*i/5)))    
 sage: K._log_gen(10)
 sage: type(K._log_gen(10))
 <type 'NoneType'>
```
So, this is o.k., but:

```
 sage: K.<zeta>=CyclotomicField(5, embedding=CC(exp(2*pi*i/5)))    
 sage: K._log_gen(CDF(10))
 sage: 0
 sage: type(K._log_gen(CDF(10)))
 sage: <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```
This behaviour is more or less documented in the docstring. It says that "If x is complex, returns the nearest such e whether or not the result is exact.". But I don't agree that it should be this way.

But I think this is not consistent and it should be fixed.
