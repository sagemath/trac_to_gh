The following three commands work as expected (a Graphics object is returned)

```
sage: points([(1,1)])

but the following command raises an `AttributeError`.

<a id='comment:10'></a>This applies, but apparently needs rebasing since I still get the same error after applying this.  There does seem to be some new code in that spot.

Interestingly, n the meantime the original error has changed.

```
sage: points(iter([(1,1,1)]))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1077 
   1078     """
-> 1079     if len(v) == 3:
   1080         try:
   1081             # check if the first element can be changed to a float

TypeError: object of type 'listiterator' has no len()
```

By the way, should we try to accommodate generators as well?   

```
points( (x,x,x) for x in range(3) )
```
or the like.

<a id='comment:18'></a>Sorry, other business (Sage-wise as well) to attend to, and then a break.  Is this behavior desired?

```
sage: point(iter([]))  # works

sage: point2d(iter([]))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError             
```
Actually, probably only the latter (and 3d version thereof) is desired, since one can't know what dimension an empty list should be... or we could default to 2d.
