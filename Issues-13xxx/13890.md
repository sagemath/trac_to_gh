The following three commands work as expected (a Graphics object is returned)

```
sage: points([(1,1)])                                                                                      

sage: points(iter([(1,1)]))                                                                                

sage: points([(1,1,1)])                                                                                    
```
but the following command raises an `AttributeError`.

```

This applies, but apparently needs rebasing since I still get the same error after applying this.  There does seem to be some new code in that spot.

Interestingly, n the meantime the original error has changed.

```
sage: points(iter([(1,1,1)]))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1077 
   1078     """
-> 1079     if len(v) == 3:
   1080         try:
   1081             # check if the first element can be changed to a float

TypeError: object of type 'listiterator' has no len()
```

By the way, should we try to accommodate generators as well?   

```
points( (x,x,x) for x in range(3) )
```
or the like.
