The few remaining instances of this error are tracked at #13786. In this case,

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(Integers(100), implementation='NTL')
sage: R(0)^0
...
ArithmeticError: 0^0 is undefined.

Looks good to me. I'm adding #13894 as a dependency to make so the following works:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(Integers(1), implementation='NTL')
sage: R(0)^0
0
```

Thanks,

Travis
