Some conversion between different BooleanPolynomial rings fail but they should not.

example :

```
sage: B.<a,b,c,d> = BooleanPolynomialRing(order='degrevlex')
sage: P.<c,d> = BooleanPolynomialRing(order='lex')
sage: P(B('c'))
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1369, 0))
.......
TypeError: cannot convert polynomial c to Boolean PolynomialRing in c, d: name b not defined
```

Still, there is something relatively annoying :

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = BooleanPolynomialRing(order='degrevlex')
sage: m = x          # a random monomial
sage: x.lm().index() # the index of the first variable of m, most people would expect "0"
2
sage: R.gen(2)
z
```
And in fact, to make it shorter:

```
sage: R.gen(0) == R.gen( R.gen(0).lm().index() )
False
```

While this is not a bug in itself, it is disturbing, and it has caused at least one problem in my code. It also exposes to the user something that should be kept hidden from her (namely, how the sage interface implements the degrevlex ordering on top of polybori). 

Fixing the .index() function to avoid this would in any case break Alexander's patch. If I understand correctly, his patch relies on this "feature"

Well, it would break much more since the the Sage uses `pbori.pyx` also to interconnect betweento `PolyBoRi`'s  python modules and its C++-based kernel (supplementing `PolyBoRi`'s original interface here). As long as Sage-only and `PolyBoRi`-only function are not mixed, this should not be a problem.

But I just realized, that `.variable()` is reordered (unlike `.gen()` it shouldn't), so I'll check this for consistency.

So, I don't exactly understand what the plan is. The patch, even though it fixes the problem at the origin of this ticket, does not fixes all problems:

- m.index() exposes the hack behind the current implementation of degreglex
- Alexander seems to believe that there is a problem with variables() 

So, do we want to remove the degrevlex from BooleanPolynomialRing altogether, and instruct users to use the newly implemented degneglex instead, or do we want to actually support degrevlex? (and how?)

I thought ring.variable(i) should give the i-th polybori variable (not reordered). But thinking twice, that would cause more problems than it solves.
 
> So, do we want to remove the degrevlex from BooleanPolynomialRing altogether, and instruct users to use the newly implemented degneglex instead, or do we want to actually support degrevlex? (and how?)

The problem is the ambigious nature of pbori.pyx:
On the one hand, it is the Sage implementation of BooleanPolynomial which should support degrevlex in such a way, that the user is not aware of the reversed variables hack.
On the other hand, Sage uses pbori.pyx as a lightweight alternative to polybori's original (boost-based) C++-to-python interface (for running polybori's highlevel library stuff in <python-site>/polybori/*). We don't need degrevlex here (but degneglex).

The latter is trivial, once `DegNegLex` is in Sage. For the first point, I will provide a first variant later this day.
