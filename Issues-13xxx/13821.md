As I mentioned a long time ago in #5288, the `combinations()` method is not ideal for working with Sage objects. This warning is also present in the documentation of this command. There is a much better command `Combinations`. The `combinations` command should be made to return a list by calling `Combinations` instead.

The result of this change in the code will be that
1. It will also speed up the function considerably, partly because it won't depend on string parsing from GAP.
2. It will be able to handle Sage objects much better.

Similarly, `combinations_iterator` should directly return a `Combinations` object, instead of duplicating stuff.

The attached patch performs this change.

It could be deprecated. But I don't know why it was written in the first place. It doesn't depend on #5288 at all.

I don't mind. But the patchbot seems to have failed in exactly the same position. This is unexpected. I didn't see any other use of `combination` from `search_src()`.

Moreover, my local testing gave no errors on those files.

Did it fail to apply? My guess is that is because #13503 was merged in `5.6.beta1`. I've formally added it as a dependency.
