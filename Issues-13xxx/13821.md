```
As I mentioned a long time ago in #5288, the `combinations()` method is not ideal for working with Sage objects. This warning is also present in the documentation of this command. There is a much better command `Combinations`. The `combinations` command should be made to return a list by calling `Combinations` instead.

The result of this change in the code will be that
1. It will also speed up the function considerably, partly because it won't depend on string parsing from GAP.
2. It will be able to handle Sage objects much better.

Similarly, `combinations_iterator` should directly return a `Combinations` object, instead of duplicating stuff.

The attached patch performs this change.

It could be deprecated. But I don't know why it was written in the first place. It doesn't depend on #5288 at all.

<div id="comment:6" align="right">Comment 6</div>

A few more documenation things:
- The `INPUT:` for `combintions_iterator()` is still indented.
- You have `..note::` but there should be a space there: `.. NOTE::` (personally I prefer the capitalized form since it is consistent with the dev-guide, but if you prefer the lowercase, that's fine).
- I don't like the formatting of

```
It is possible to take combinations of Sage objects.::
```
  as it will output in the html

```
It is possible to take combinations of Sage objects.:
```
  Thus either remove the period or put a space between the period and the colon (i.e. as `objects. ::`).

Thanks,

Travis

Works for me as well:

```
travis@travis-virtualbox:~/sage-5.5.rc0/devel/sage-reviews/sage$ sage -t graphs/generic_graph.py geometry/polyhedron/base_ZZ.py 
sage -t  "devel/sage-reviews/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base_ZZ.py"
	 [24.3 s]
sage -t  "devel/sage-reviews/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py"  
	 [91.9 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 116.3 seconds
```
(For whomever is interested, the replace patch depends on #13503)

I've had this issue of the patchbot using old patches come up a few places before. I've kicked the patchbot, so hopefully next time the patchbot will pass all tests. Since the tests pass for me, I'm going to set this to positive review.

Thanks.

I didn't know it was a more common occurrence with the patchbot. It looks like it doesn't clear the queue while applying new patches.

Did it fail to apply? My guess is that is because #13503 was merged in `5.6.beta1`. I've formally added it as a dependency.
