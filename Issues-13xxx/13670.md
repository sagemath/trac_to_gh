```
As of #13671, we have

```
sage: R.<x1,x2> = QQ[]
sage: S = R.quotient_ring( R.ideal(x2**2 + x1 - 2, x1**2 - 1) )
sage: 
sage: 1 / S(x1 + x2)
...
ValueError: polynomial is not in the ideal
```
Before #13671, it was worse: NotImplementedError.

This can be clarified.

There's a problem with the documentation in the patch: "that when the error message actually describes what happens when division is not possible"

You can also be more precise than "not possible" in the string of the Error. How about "Left hand side is not a multiple of right hand side in quotient ring element division". My problem is that "not possible" is vague and can mean many other things, such as non-uniqueness, a computability problem, or a practical problem.

And then there is the following problem (which was there already). For most rings, only unique division is allowed, and non-unique divisions give a `ZeroDivisionError`:

```
sage: 0/0 # every integer a satisfies 0*a=0, so we don't give an answer at all
ZeroDivisionError: Rational division by zero
sage: L = Zmod(8)(4); R = Zmod(8)(2)
sage: L/R # both a=(2 mod 8) a=(6 mod 8) satisfy a*R=L, so we don't give an answer at all
ZeroDivisionError: Inverse does not exist.
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: S = R.quotient_ring(R.ideal(x^2, y))
sage: 0/S(x) #any polynomial p with p(0)=0 satisfies p*S(x)=0 in S, but still we output one such element
0
```
Obviously you don't have to do anything with this non-uniqueness at this ticket, which is just about clarifying errors.

So, if I understand correctly, division by `f` should only be allowed if `f` has an inverse in `R/I`. Is that correct? 

Thinking about this file more generally : most of the functions in this file are completely generic and do not depend on what `R` and `I` are. However there are a few exceptions to this : 

* `is_unit()`. Currently does almost nothing. Could possibly be improved while staying generic by trying the `inverse_mod` method of the parent ring `R`.

* `_div_`. Currently does something specific when `R` is a polynomial ring (computing a Gröbner basis, etc.), and something generic in other cases (multiplying the numerator by the inverse of the denominator, using the `inverse_mod` function of `R`). 

`__invert__` is somewhat generic: it tries to use the `inverse_mod` function of `R`, and if this is `NotImplemented`, then it tries `_div_`. This is bizarre, because in the end it will also fall back to `inverse_mod`, except when `R` is a polynomial ring, but these now have the `inverse_mod function` thanks to #13675.

So, maybe this ticket could become "Various Small Improvements to QuotientRingElement", and could implement:
* the improvement to the error message already discussed above
* small improvement to the `is_unit` function
* small improvement to the `_div_` function

I also wonder whether it is the Right Thing to have polynomial-specific code here...
