pyOpenSSL 0.13 doesn't build on systems with sufficiently old OpenSSL versions. A patch exists for this but has not been included upstream. So, we have to make an SPKG.

(This SPKG continues the history of an old pyOpenSSL SPKG I found somewhere.)

Jeroen is the one to ask, as I believe this problem first came up when Jeroen was testing on a buildbot which had an old OpenSSL (OS X 10.4 I think).

But personally I'd go for (1) as I want to see #13121 and its web of dependencies get merged ASAP :)

If it's an *optional* package: go for it!  I don't really care about OpenSSL on this OS X 10.4 machine.

Be sure to test the combination of the OpenSSL spkg with the PyOpenSSL spkg though.
