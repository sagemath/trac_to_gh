pyOpenSSL 0.13 doesn't build on systems with sufficiently old OpenSSL versions. A patch exists for this but has not been included upstream. So, we have to make an SPKG.

(This SPKG continues the history of an old pyOpenSSL SPKG I found somewhere.)

Install [this spkg](http://wstein.org/home/keshav/files/pyopenssl-0.13.p0.spkg).

Depends on #13121

As I said earlier, this builds properly for me. The patch makes sense, too.

I think we have two options with this ticket: (1) Accept the spkg as is, so we can get the new notebook (etc.) merged; then if there are remaining issues with conflicting versions of OpenSSL, we can work on fixing them. (2) Try to get people who have already had issues with old versions of OpenSSL to see if this spkg fixes them.

Since this is an optional spkg, and since I don't know who to ask about option (2), I'm inclined to go with option (1). Keshav, what do you think?

Jeroen is the one to ask, as I believe this problem first came up when Jeroen was testing on a buildbot which had an old OpenSSL (OS X 10.4 I think).

But personally I'd go for (1) as I want to see #13121 and its web of dependencies get merged ASAP :)

If it's an *optional* package: go for it!  I don't really care about OpenSSL on this OS X 10.4 machine.

Be sure to test the combination of the OpenSSL spkg with the PyOpenSSL spkg though.
