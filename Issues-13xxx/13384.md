Jeroen is the one to ask, as I believe this problem first came up when Jeroen was testing on a buildbot which had an old OpenSSL (OS X 10.4 I think).

But personally I'd go for (1) as I want to see #13121 and its web of dependencies get merged ASAP :)

Be sure to test the combination of the OpenSSL spkg with the PyOpenSSL spkg though.

OK report: I have started with a fresh 5.3.rc0 and got a crash on Debian Wheezy. Then I followed instructions on #13121 and got a message to read README, which after #13385 tells to install pyopenssl. Installing it from this ticket made everything work.
