```
The `RealNumber()` and `ComplexNumber()` global functions are converting string to floating-point numbers. They do not do what their names suggest

```
sage: RealNumber(1/3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to convert '1/3' to a real number
sage: ComplexNumber(complex('13.8+6.2j'))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to coerce to a ComplexNumber: <type 'str'>
```

These two functions are mostly intended for the Sage preparser and shouldn't be used directly. We deprecate them in view of removing them from the global namespace. In the future, we might use the names `RealNumber` and `ComplexNumber` as proper factories.

I disagree since the output from `ComplexNumber(1, 1)` is `1.0... + 1.0...*I`, so we should allow this as valid input to be consistent with python's `complex` function and because we do accept python `complex` strings.

```

makes much more sense to solve the problem at hand.
- The fact that `ComplexNumber` would assemble a complex number from numerical input by converting to a string is ludicrous in its own right: If you're handed real and imaginary parts in numerical form, you should NOT be converting to strings as an intermediate. That's just asking for precision loss (and horrible performance).

I realize that we have the documentation:

```
def create_ComplexNumber(s_real, s_imag=None, int pad=0, min_prec=53):
    Return the complex number defined by the strings s_real and
    s_imag as an element of ``ComplexField(prec=n)``,
    where n potentially has slightly more (controlled by pad) bits than
    given by s.
```
According to that documentation, the proposed input is not valid anyway. By changing that you're changing the interface the routine offers. That's fine, but once you start changing it, you should *improve* it.

Note that `CC(complex("1+2j"))` already works. By the looks of it, `CC.__call__` is already taking a much saner approach. Perhaps `ComplexNumber` should share more with that routine? Or be documented that people should really use `CC(...)`? or perhaps `ComplexNumber` can be deprecated altogether?

This is already how I've done it done in the current patch.

That was the original implementation with two reals as input, and I haven't changed that. Nevertheless, I agree that it should be changed (see below).

How about we check if the input is a (pair of) `str`, and if not, then it just feeds it to `CC` in an appropriate fashion? I don't think we should deprecate it because the naive person IMO would likely look for `ComplexNumber` before `CC`.


Volker, good point. I don't use regex too often so it's never really something I think of. I'll do that on the next patch.

Yes, indeed. That very "eval" instruction is marked with a "TODO", indicating that it could use improvements. I'd say that's the place to a string interpretation routine, rather than in `create_ComplexNumber`. Note, by the way, that most machinery for making complex numbers sits in `sage.rings.complex_number.ComplexNumber.__init__`.

There is one thing that `create_ComplexNumber` does that other routines don't: It takes the string lengths as an indication of the number of bits required in the representation. None of the other routines do that. It also indicates that `create_ComplexNumber` perhaps shouldn't be used for anything more general, or in its other roles, take a hint from its input to choose what precision to use.

I think in general, guessing precision from number of digits written down is rarely going to produce desirable results, so I'd be for providing the user interface with a default precision (complex) field.

Yes, I was suggesting that [ComplexNumber](ComplexNumber) and RealNumber be aliases for CC and RR. Unless I am missing some functionality that these are supposed to provide that CC and RR don't. I think that, for a lot of students, they would easily recognize the command [ComplexNumber](ComplexNumber), but might not recognize the command CC, so I think it is useful as an alias.

Why *should* they recognize the command `ComplexNumber`? Most likely they will type something like `1.2 + 3.4 * I` and that works fine.
