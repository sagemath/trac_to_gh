Assignee: jason, jkantor

The `RealNumber()` and `ComplexNumber()` global functions are converting string to floating-point numbers. They do not do what their names suggest

```
sage: RealNumber(1/3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to convert '1/3' to a real number
sage: ComplexNumber(complex('13.8+6.2j'))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to coerce to a ComplexNumber: <type 'str'>
```

These two functions are mostly intended for the Sage preparser and shouldn't be used directly. We deprecate them in view of removing them from the global namespace. In the future, we might use the names `RealNumber` and `ComplexNumber` as proper factories.

I disagree since the output from `ComplexNumber(1, 1)` is `1.0... + 1.0...*I`, so we should allow this as valid input to be consistent with python's `complex` function and because we do accept python `complex` strings.

True, but it's the "natural" in between since python complex strings are `2 + 2j` and I think a typical user is likely to try `2 + 2i` first.

The ticket states that `ComplexNumber(complex(...))` doesn't work and proceeds by implementing a more elaborate string parser. That's not the most obvious way of soving the ticket:
- a python `complex` already has a nice `.real()` and `.imag()`, so stuffing them together in a string to just pry them apart is not a smart move. Doing

```
    if isinstance(s_real, complex):
        s_real, s_imag = s_real.real(), s_real.imag()
```
makes much more sense to solve the problem at hand.
- The fact that `ComplexNumber` would assemble a complex number from numerical input by converting to a string is ludicrous in its own right: If you're handed real and imaginary parts in numerical form, you should NOT be converting to strings as an intermediate. That's just asking for precision loss (and horrible performance).

I realize that we have the documentation:

```
def create_ComplexNumber(s_real, s_imag=None, int pad=0, min_prec=53):
    Return the complex number defined by the strings s_real and
    s_imag as an element of ``ComplexField(prec=n)``,
    where n potentially has slightly more (controlled by pad) bits than
    given by s.
```
According to that documentation, the proposed input is not valid anyway. By changing that you're changing the interface the routine offers. That's fine, but once you start changing it, you should *improve* it.

Note that `CC(complex("1+2j"))` already works. By the looks of it, `CC.__call__` is already taking a much saner approach. Perhaps `ComplexNumber` should share more with that routine? Or be documented that people should really use `CC(...)`? or perhaps `ComplexNumber` can be deprecated altogether?

This is already how I've done it done in the current patch.

That was the original implementation with two reals as input, and I haven't changed that. Nevertheless, I agree that it should be changed (see below).

`CC._element_constructor_` is probably slow for string input since it evaluates the input. I'm a bit uncomfortable with that security-wise, though there are certainly bigger fish to fry.

I agree that it would be best if `ComplexNumber` would just delegate everything to `CC`. The latter even handles two strings as input. The docstring should reflect that and say that it is preferred to use `CC` / `CDF` directly.

That very \"eval\" instruction is marked with a \"TODO\", indicating that it could use improvements. I'd say that's the place to a string interpretation routine, rather than in `create_ComplexNumber`. Note, by the way, that most machinery for making complex numbers sits in `sage.rings.complex_number.ComplexNumber.__init__`.

Replying to [comment:15 vbraun]:
> `CC._element_constructor_` is probably slow for string input since it evaluates the input. I'm a bit uncomfortable with that security-wise, though there are certainly bigger fish to fry.


Yes, indeed. That very "eval" instruction is marked with a "TODO", indicating that it could use improvements. I'd say that's the place to a string interpretation routine, rather than in `create_ComplexNumber`. Note, by the way, that most machinery for making complex numbers sits in `sage.rings.complex_number.ComplexNumber.__init__`. It can deal with various inputs, including strings for real and imag, by virtue of just calling `RR(real)` and `RR(imag)` (where `RR` is the underlying real field). Thus, the only thing a "complex number" parser would have to do is locate the likely real and imaginary part in the string and pass them on. This could even be put in this routine itself.

There is one thing that `create_ComplexNumber` does that other routines don't: It takes the string lengths as an indication of the number of bits required in the representation. None of the other routines do that. It also indicates that `create_ComplexNumber` perhaps shouldn't be used for anything more general, or in its other roles, take a hint from its input to choose what precision to use.

I think in general, guessing precision from number of digits written down is rarely going to produce desirable results, so I'd be for providing the user interface with a default precision (complex) field.
