The `RealNumber()` and `ComplexNumber()` global functions are converting string to floating-point numbers. They do not do what their names suggest

```
sage: RealNumber(1/3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to convert '1/3' to a real number
sage: ComplexNumber(complex('13.8+6.2j'))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to coerce to a ComplexNumber: <type 'str'>
```

These two functions are mostly intended for the Sage preparser and shouldn't be used directly. We deprecate them in view of removing them from the global namespace. In the future, we might use the names `RealNumber` and `ComplexNumber` as proper factories.

I disagree since the output from `ComplexNumber(1, 1)` is `1.0... + 1.0...*I`, so we should allow this as valid input to be consistent with python's `complex` function and because we do accept python `complex` strings.

That's not the most obvious way of soving the ticket:\n- a python `complex` already has a nice `.real()` and `.imag()`, so stuffing them together in a string to just pry them apart is not a smart move. Doing\n\n```\n    if isinstance(s_real, complex):\n        s_real, s_imag = s_real.real(), s_real.imag()\n```\nmakes much more sense to solve the problem at hand.\n- The fact that `ComplexNumber` would assemble a complex number from numerical input by converting to a string is ludicrous in its own right: If you're handed real and imaginary parts in numerical form, you should NOT be converting to strings as an intermediate. That's just asking for precision loss (and horrible performance).\n\nI realize that we have the documentation:\n\n```\ndef create_ComplexNumber(s_real, s_imag=None, int pad=0, min_prec=53):\n    Return the complex number defined by the strings s_real and\n    s_imag as an element of ``ComplexField(prec=n)``,\n    where n potentially has slightly more (controlled by pad) bits than\n    given by s.\n```\nAccording to that documentation, the proposed input is not valid anyway. By changing that you're changing the interface the routine offers. That's fine, but once you start changing it, you should *improve* it.\n\nNote that `CC(complex(\"1+2j\"))` already works. By the looks of it, `CC.__call__` is already taking a much saner approach. Perhaps `ComplexNumber` should share more with that routine? Or be documented that people should really use `CC(...)`? or perhaps `ComplexNumber` can be deprecated altogether?",

The ticket states that `ComplexNumber(complex(...))` doesn't work and proceeds by implementing a more elaborate string parser. That's not the most obvious way of soving the ticket:
- a python `complex` already has a nice `.real()` and `.imag()`, so stuffing them together in a string to just pry them apart is not a smart move. Doing

```
    if isinstance(s_real, complex):
        s_real, s_imag = s_real.real(), s_real.imag()
```
makes much more sense to solve the problem at hand.
- The fact that `ComplexNumber` would assemble a complex number from numerical input by converting to a string is ludicrous in its own right: If you're handed real and imaginary parts in numerical form, you should NOT be converting to strings as an intermediate. That's just asking for precision loss (and horrible performance).

I realize that we have the documentation:

```
def create_ComplexNumber(s_real, s_imag=None, int pad=0, min_prec=53):
    Return the complex number defined by the strings s_real and
    s_imag as an element of ``ComplexField(prec=n)``,
    where n potentially has slightly more (controlled by pad) bits than
    given by s.
```
According to that documentation, the proposed input is not valid anyway. By changing that you're changing the interface the routine offers. That's fine, but once you start changing it, you should *improve* it.

Note that `CC(complex("1+2j"))` already works. By the looks of it, `CC.__call__` is already taking a much saner approach. Perhaps `ComplexNumber` should share more with that routine? Or be documented that people should really use `CC(...)`? or perhaps `ComplexNumber` can be deprecated altogether?

That was the original implementation with two reals as input, and I haven't changed that. Nevertheless, I agree that it should be changed (see below).

Volker, good point. I don't use regex too often so it's never really something I think of. I'll do that on the next patch.

`CC._element_constructor_` is probably slow for string input since it evaluates the input. I'm a bit uncomfortable with that security-wise, though there are certainly bigger fish to fry.

I agree that it would be best if `ComplexNumber` would just delegate everything to `CC`. The latter even handles two strings as input. The docstring should reflect that and say that it is preferred to use `CC` / `CDF` directly.
