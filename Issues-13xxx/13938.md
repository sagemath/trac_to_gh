This is a follow-up to #13032.  After consulting [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-devel/QRIRSL4qk7I), it seems like a bad idea to set `CCACHE_DIR` unconditionally, so let's not do this.

Blocker because #13032 is a regression for people using a system-wide ccache installation.
