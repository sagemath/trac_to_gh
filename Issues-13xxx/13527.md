According to the standards set out in #13404, we want:

```
A = Sets().WithRealizations().example()
sage: F   = A.F()  ; F
The subset algebra of {1, 2, 3} over Rational Field in the Fundamental basis
```
instead of:

```
sage: F   = A.F()  ; F
The subset algebra of {1, 2, 3} over Rational Field on the Fundamental basis
```
