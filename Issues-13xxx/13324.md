On my 1.7.16 installation of Cygwin, the ecl spkg does not build because it defines unconditionaly _WINSOCKAPI_ in h/ecl-cmp.h which then prevents the definition of fd_set in /usr/include/sys/types.h.
I guess this is harmless on Linux, intended on Windows, but on Cygwin this breaks the build of ECL.

The proposed spkg patches h/ecl-cmp.h so that _WINSOCKAPI_ is not defined on CYGWIN.
This has been merged upstream and is in 12.12.1:
https://sourceforge.net/p/ecls/ecl/ci/07c4ab7db83eda2eed7fa4a5ddeec2e28c7eb58b/

Moreover comes patches from upstream to get correct signal handling and is in 12.12.1:
* http://sourceforge.net/p/ecls/ecl/ci/c4a538dd278407f91f6105ebbeadf1b371c1124f/
* http://sourceforge.net/p/ecls/ecl/ci/15033d5a8ad7297e5f76e2e70446b0eea2f2d2a7/
* http://sourceforge.net/p/ecls/ecl/ci/ec1fe8781a5f137284cc6c0d0cfa6b0cc9b9b291/

We build ECL single threaded to get hopefully more correct signal handling in library mode and avoid problems with the pexpect interface.

And a later patch to avoid infinite loops while compiling lisp to C:
http://sourceforge.net/p/ecls/ecl/ci/13459a98f0c0c58ccc4e9241c3bf0625e39f2383/

Older patches which are now upstream have been removed.

Be sure to use Sage 5.6.beta2 or higher, so that the Maxima spkg is ready for this.

That was expected.
In fact I guess the build is not nearing the end at all.

You can rerun "./sage -b" and you'll see that a lot of cpp files produced from pyx files still have to be compiled.
The first that should refail then is ecl.cpp.
See #13334 for that one.

For the following ones I've not opened tockets yet, but there should be instructions enough on the [CygwinPort](CygwinPort) page (although you'll have to implement the ideas evoked there yourself, no code provided).

It's at
http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/sage/ecl-12.7.1.p0.spkg

I've updated the spkg-make file and homogenized the indentation in the spkg-install file as well.

Two trivial doctests had to be changed, and it passes make ptestlong on Ubuntu 12.04 64 bits.
No time to retest Cygwin yet.

I think you are cloning ECL from an old repo, no longer updated (they recently switched).
In the right repo 12.7.1 does have your commit already applied.

Our interfacing with ECL got behind the times a little (and perhaps was never fully with it). Google e.g.
"Making an external signal handler play nice with embedded ECL" [to get to this](http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.ecl.general/8211). There are more places where we could use a face-lift. ECL has really improved its thread-ready API and we should really be using that (e.g., look up return values and other things on a "ecl_process_env()" data structure).

Anyway, there are some improvements we could make to handling interrupts and catching other stuff.

I had a look into the signal issue and came up with a patch (submitted upstream).
Inbetween, here comes an updated spkg based on the latest sage spkg:
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/ecl-12.7.1.p0.spkg
containing patches for Cygwin and the signal problem.

The patch to the Sage library is no longer necessary (or seems so on my install), must have been done somewhere else.

Replying to [kcrisman](#comment%3A49):
> I'm getting to work earlier tomorrow, I'll try to set up an XP Cygwin build and test this - may not have feedback for several days, though!

Thanks, that's great.

Nonetheless the new patches should not influence the spkg on Cygwin, so your and my previous tests are still valid for Cygwin.
I'll be working on the remaining issue this week end hopefully (#9167) and propose patches upstream.

The important thing to test is the timeout problems and this now looks fine.
It passed make ptestlong on two different Linux x86_64 Debian and Ubuntu for me and stressful testing of the previous problematic files.

So I guess that if someone thinks that the changes are ok, with minimal additional testing, we can put this as positive_review and let the patchbot make their work (or rather the release manager, as it seems spkg are not tested by patchbot, am I wrong?).

This spkg is an old spkg from #9167 and is not up to date with the one here and should be rebased once the one here gets positive review.
Indeed, the one here does not contain the fixes in the one from #9167 and I don't plan to do so because the changes there still need some work.

Anyway these fixes at #9167 are not needed to build Sage on Cygwin, they are needed to be able to import maxima in Sage.
The fixes here let Sage build on Cygwin and prevent signal problems with the updated ECL.

I don't think I mentioned it here but the bug page upstream was
http://sourceforge.net/p/ecls/bugs/216/

To produce a completely correct library would need
http://sourceforge.net/p/ecls/bugs/222/
but that might be done in a follow up ticket.

The spgk here fulfill its purpose (in fact more than what originally planned):
- upgrade to 12.7.1,
- build on cygwin (with backported patches).

So I guess it should be integrated asap.

On the Sage side, the only changes are that I removed the two patches backported for 12.7.1.

Oh, I see what you mean!  I was thinking it was something else, but you mean that in attachment:ecl-12.7.1.p0.diff you have the same configure options in both cases, but need to remove `--with-dffi=no` from the `else` clause?

I also had rebase problems once when building Maxima, this was quite horrible to deal with.
I had to let it fail, rebase and restart from where it failed.

And now I found something more problematic, Maxima does not seem to build as a library on my Linux system with the 12.12.1 version.
And the Maxima spkg does not detect that (although there should be code to detect this), if confirmed, this should go on another trac ticket.

Seen from Sage, this "new" file seems to work just as well.

Precisely what happens is that it raises an error that smells of needing rebasing, and drops me into an interactive (ECL, I think) terminal for whether I want to continue compiling, does that a few times, and then just plain old fails, again smelling of needing a rebase.  But the rebase doesn't help.

I'll try it all again just now, now that I confirmed I can get it working again by going back to the old (well, 12.7.1) ECL, rebasing, then doing `sage -f maxima`.  I should be able to report back in about 15-20 minutes...

I have no idea why, especially since rebasing seems to have nothing to do with it even though there is this inaccessible comment.  There is indeed a `maxima-package.{fas,o}` in the build directory in `src/src/binary-ecl`, but I don't see any `maxima-system`.  Is this similar to the problem you had?  And if you have an idea on how to continue in the ECL debugger, that would be great - probably that is part of my problem...

That looks very scary and completely different from what I get.

I think that in my case (on Cygwin, not on Linux where the problem looks different and much easier to solve), the compilation goes much further.

Ok here comes an updated 12.7.1 spkg.
It should be fine although I'm not sure anymore it properly compiles on my Cygwin.

We can postpone 12.12.1 to another ticket if it looks even more problematic.

I don't seem to have the compilation problem with the old ecl 11-*cvs.p2 spkg I posted a long time ago...
It has not finished building Maxima 5.26.p0 yet but went through the problematic SLATEC:DBESJ.
Too bad.

By the way, I did not need any rebase so far (for ECL or Maxima, I think the only one I did here was to start Sage, nothing needed before).

Maybe we should go back to 12.2.1 if my problem disappears with it.

I'm getting the same problem now even with 12.7.1.p0 now.  And in fact I think I had not tested the p0 spkg before with Sage 5.5.rc0, only with 5.4.rc2.  Aargh.  Is it possible that it's the changes in 12.7.1.p1 at #9167 actually fix the problem I'm having?  So far, that's the only one of the three that worked in building Maxima with 5.5.rc0.  And of course the old spkg you mention was fine.

Indeed, the spkg at 12.7.1.p1 at #9167, even if it isn't 100% updated, is letting Maxima build normally.

Can you provide a new spkg there based on your p0 here?  I don't see how that fixed things, but somehow it does.  So maybe this allows us to at least keep 12.7.1 instead of 12.2.1, though I would be open to that too...

What same problem do you mean?
Getting stuck at SLATE:DBESJ?

Because what #9167 deals with is completely unrelated.

Really strange.

The point here is that ECL gets stuck while compiling Maxima.
All the (other) pieces of Sage have nothing to do with that.

With ECL 12.2.1, the Maxima spkg goes past SLATEC::DBESJ (not finished yet though).
If it is fine on XP as well, let's go with it for the time being.

Potentially both our problems are incarnation of the same problem.

We should also try the 12.7.1 and 12.12.1 ECLs with the new Maxima 5.299.1 from #13364, who knows...
It might not fix the ECL bug if any, but make it so that it is not triggered for us.

I have to go somewhere, but I'm going to at least set it to trying 12.2.1.p0 with #13364.  But I don't expect anything happy.

Are you *sure* that the changes at #9167 wouldn't make a difference?  You do change where certain files are sent, and maybe that has some relation to it.

Maybe in your case, some file are not properly deleted and then you're using different versions of ECL and that segfaults.
Not sure.

I think the best to do is to try to build all of this outside of Sage, but that is more involved.
Or relauunch a clean build with the new spkg directly in spkg/standard to avoid messing different versions together.

In my case, using 12.2.1, the Maxima 5.26.0 spkg installs cleanly.
So my problem was introduced between 12.2.1 and 12.7.1 if that's on the ECL side.

And i now doubt both issues are related.

Because I would not not understand why the fixes of #9167 could fix your problem.
From what I understand, there really would be no reason.
What I did in #9167 is just renaming some files produced when building ECL, and more precisely the most relevant thing is moving lib/ecl.dll to bin/cygecl.dll and creating a new lib/libecl.dll.a.
And frankly I see no reason why this should prevent a segfault when building Maxima with ECL.
Maybe it does, I cannot say it's not the case, but if it it is then I cannot say why...

My point was that if you got these differently named files (cygecl.dll and libecl.dll.a) and the customary one (ecl.dll), maybe somthing got mixed up and lead to a segfault, but that's just a guess.

So if we clear the other issue or confirm its bad interaction between different versions of ECL, we can go ahead with 12.12.1!

I can believe that having the new files along with the usual one would do that, since it was similar conflicts that led to other messes on Cygwin.

I see, that's what you were saying.  I can believe that having the new files along with the usual one would do that, since it was similar conflicts that led to other messes on Cygwin.  I had compiled it first with the package from #9167 before trying all of these.  So your diagnosis that #9167 wasn't solving a problem, but that doing these was causing it, seems reasonable.

If so, could this cause problems on upgrade on Cygwin?  Not that we are expecting Cygwin users to do upgrades necessarily.

Anyway, I'll try to get by that machine on Monday and see how it did over the weekend with the compile from scratch with 12.12.1!  Then we can test it quick on some Macs (you have Linux covered, I guess) and hopefully get this positive review as well.

I think we have pretty much established that ecl is not the problem since we have reproduced the crash in maxima with at least 3 different lisp interpreters (ecl, clisp and sbcl).

Well, still IMHO *Sage* should catch the segfault (or whatever).

[Note that CLISP IIRC detected a (Lisp) *stack overflow*, which ECL did only on some systems; to me this is pretty different to a few thousand times issuing "access to protected memory detected", finally really crashing with an uncatched segfault.]

Yes, that's nearly what I meant.  I think -- if ECL doesn't [properly] -- Sage should catch the segfault, abort the current computation, and [ideally] return to the `sage:` prompt.

So, as I see it, ECL currently doesn't properly detect or handle the stack overflow (returning with an error instead of doing whatever it currently tries to, if the behavior is [partially] intentional at all), nor does Sage catch the segfault apparently because ECL installs its own signal handler(s).

What is the status of this ticket?  I can't help on the Cygwin side for a while yet but am happy to do any sage.math or recent Mac testing.  Is it "needs work" on the uncaught error?  And is there a link to the upstream report?  Just trying to gauge the status, thanks.

Too ad, that's exactly the kind of issues I had and thought to be solved by building ECL single threaded (which I intended to do anyway, it is just I forgot to configure it so in the first place, i don't think the way we handle signals woud be compatible with a multi-threaded ECL, Nils surely have an opinion on that, there are also potentiel problems with Maxima as written in SPKG.txt, but I have not looked at this).

So the new ECL interacts badly with pexpect?

I tried this with the *old* ECL (on Linux x86_64) and didn't get a single failure / timeout, so the timeouts are definitely a regression.  (Although I must admit I haven't tried with the new ECL [on the same machine].)

Ok, I think I got a little more info on this one by enabling the pexpect logs in our Sage classes:
* we throw (+ 1 random) to ECL for synchronization,
* it seems the output is somehow split on multiple lines randomly, e.g. on the last failing example I got we threw (+ 1 937780183) and here is what is in the log

```
...
> (+ 1 937780183)

(+ 1 937780183)^M
^M
93^M
7780184^M
> 
```
So indeed we will never read 937780184 back.
(Not sure what `^M` exactly is)

By the way, the lisp.py file needs a big cleanup, especially all the :: for the examples and tests.

This is a massive regression due to this ECL upgrade:

Execute

```

- Before: about 2.5s

It makes we wonder whether we should unmerge this upgrade, what if more ECL-related functionality has slowed down?

what time do you measure?

```
sage: time print(len(maxima._commands(verbose=False)))
1926

See http://trac.sagemath.org/12719 for details.
```

Anyway, it's only the very first time that this is really slow, presumably due to Maxima starting up.  However, there is a brief slowdown.

```
sage: time print(len(maxima._commands(verbose=False)))
1926
CPU times: user 0.32 s, sys: 0.07 s, total: 0.39 s
Wall time: 16.06 s
sage: time print(len(maxima._commands(verbose=False)))
1926
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00 s
sage: %timeit print(len(maxima._commands(verbose=False)))
<many 1926 later>
100000 loops, best of 3: 5.09 us per loop
```

With 5.6:

```
sage: time print(len(maxima._commands(verbose=False)))
1871
Time: CPU 0.37 s, Wall: 16.32 s
sage: time print(len(maxima._commands(verbose=False)))
1871
Time: CPU 0.00 s, Wall: 0.00 s
sage: %timeit print(len(maxima._commands(verbose=False)))
625 loops, best of 3: 2.16 µs per loop
```

Testing another command.  Old:

```
sage: %timeit integrate(cos(x^2),x)
25 loops, best of 3: 21.4 ms per loop
```

New:

```
sage: %timeit integrate(cos(x^2),x)
1 loops, best of 3: 21.2 ms per loop
```

I think this is a non-issue.  How often are people going to need really fast listing of all Maxima commands?

On startup, it only seems to add an extra 1.5 seconds for Maxima to start, so the list seems to take 15+ seconds. \n\nOkay, it seems to be creating the whole list for tab completion, actually.

Hmm, true.  On startup, it only seems to add an extra 1.5 seconds for Maxima to start, so the list seems to take 15+ seconds. 

Okay, it seems to be creating the whole list for tab completion, actually.   I'm used to seeing this slowness, but on my 10-year-old machine with a 1/2 G of memory.

My guess? This line from `maxima.completions??`:

```
cmd_list = self._eval_line('apropos("%s")'%s, error_check=False).replace('\\ - ','-')
```
Recall that we also upgraded Maxima in 5.7.beta0, #13364.  Perhaps "apropos" slowed down.

Or maybe the IPython upgrade in #12719 made

```
sys.stdout.flush()
```
slower, if this only shows up in 5.7.beta1.  I'm going to check this momentarily.

Okay, it also is in beta0, and in retrospect that was a silly comment by me, because that is only called with `verbose=True`.

So I wonder about "apropos".

>> How often are people going to need really fast listing of all Maxima commands?

> I was going to say "TAB completion", but that's apparently cached in $DOT_SAGE.
And 

```
        try:
            return self.__commands
        except AttributeError:
```
So it's cached there as well.

Well, I would say open a ticket, and let's see if we can find a way to find a Maxima command to mimic this slowdown in this listing command to report upstream.
