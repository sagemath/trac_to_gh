When I run `sage --python` and then try to import something "specific" (e.g. from the `rings` module), I get the following:

This also happens for other modules, e.g. `from sage.modules.all import *`. However, it does not occur when I do

```
from sage.all import *
```

first.

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
Before you can do any of those specific imports, you need to do

```
import sage.all
```

which will import things in the correct order and make sure everything is initialized.  After that, you can import what you need.

I think this nevertheless witnesses some problems with Sage's imports and modularity. Is there a good reason why this shouldn't work ?
