The Legendre polynomials, returned by `legendre_P()`, of the first kind are orthogonal over [-1,1] and are normalized to have value +-1 at the endpoints.

When solving least-squares problems, it's convenient to be able to construct them over an arbitrary interval [a,b].

I tried this, but it's producing the wrong results. For example,

```
sage: legendre_P(1, x)
-1/2*x - 5/2
```

That said, there are two reasons it might seem over-complicated.

The first is that I was very careful not to break any existing doctests, even though they're doing some crazy things. I tried to comment each of these hurdles.

The second is that I wanted to be clear about what was happening. The `c(m)` and `g(m)` functions are as defined in A&S. So the final `return` statement is exactly the form given in the reference. The use of the affine transform `phi()` allows me to retain that form, and also provides some rationale for the result. I think this makes it (more) clear that we're composing the standard `P()` over [-1,1] with an affine transform, which will intuitively preserve orthogonality.

I'm happy to change this if it can be done without breaking the existing doctests. I'll wait to see what you say about the first thing.



> * I don't see the need to use `bool` in doctests such as
> 
> ```

Often, the `==` operator will return a symbolic equality rather than True/False. This is true even in this simple case:

```
sage: p0 = 1
sage: legendre_P(0, x, 0, 1) == p0
1 == 1
```

If you cast the symbolic equality to `bool`, you get,

* True, if Sage can convince itself that equality holds.
* False, if Sage can "prove" inequality.
* False, if it's not sure.

So it should be safe to test for `True`.

I was just careless with that one, I'll fix it. I think backticks or single quotes are needed around 'a' and 'b', otherwise it reads weird. But 'n' at the beginning is fine without it.

I've fixed the variable quoting in the new patch, and allowed the endpoints a,b to be symbolic. There's also a new test to make sure that the symbolic endpoints work as expected.

I haven't heard back, so maybe you bought my reasoning for the affine transform =)

The `bool()` casts do have to stay, otherwise the tests just don't work.

Thanks for taking a look.

This is what results from using `^` rather than `**` in python.  I'm sorry my proposed code had only been testing in Sage, and therefore was being prepared.  This dealt with, my version does pass all the doctests, is faster when if the variable is a polynomial generator, and the error

```
sage: legendre_P(4, Zmod(5)(1), 3, 6)
...
ArithmeticError: 0^0 is undefined.
```
is eliminated.  Apologies for mistyping this before.

> The `bool()` casts do have to stay, otherwise the tests just don't work.

Another way of doing this is to introduce a polynomial variable.  Thus

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: legendre_P(1, x) == x
True
```
I know very little about the symbolic side of Sage, but I do find things like

```
sage: SR(1) == SR(1)
1 == 1
```
very strange, and confusing when compared with

```
sage: 1 == 1
True
```

I removed the RR check, so you can actually pass in anything you want now. I'm not convinced this isn't a foot-gun, but it's still a clear improvement over what we have now so I'm happy with it.

Ah, yes, I should have caught that, sorry.

I believe this is another bug, elsewhere. I've set out to fix it and am trapped in a rabbit hole at the moment, about four bugs from here. Once that's sorted out, I'll do some experiments.

You'll get no argument from me there. I do prefer to test with the default symbol `x` though just because that's what most people will use.

That's too big to ever get merged... I would break out the functions into individual tickets where possible.

Anyway, I was waiting here on #13786 which fixes the `ArithmeticError: 0^0 is undefined` mentioned above. Unfortunately, both implementations now fail due to some other error on `legendre_P(4, Zmod(5)(1), 3, 6)`, but what can you do.

Now the only difference between my implementation and the one in comment 2 is speed: mine is slightly faster unscaled, and that one is slightly faster on a nonstandard interval. But both deltas are negligible, and I have an aesthetic preference for the algorithm that's described in the reference.

This still passes all the tests and is a big improvement over what we have so I'm going to put it up for review again.

Brief questions:
* When special-casing `n=0`, you have 

```
return 1
```
  Will this be a Python int?
* What if `n` is a Python int?

```
We can accept Python integers for ``x`` as well::
```
* How's speed?  I can imagine the sum thing getting slow.
* Am I misreading this?  Should it be beta = 1?

```
# From Abramowitz & Stegun, (22.3.2) with alpha = beta = 0. 
```
  Oh, I see.  [It's actually (22.3.1)](http://people.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_775.htm) and maybe this should be in the code with a reference section.

**Attachment:** [sage-trac_13720.2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13720/sage-trac_13720.2.patch.gz)

When n=0, I try to return unity from the same ring as the variable:

```
if n == 0:
    # Easy base case, save time. Attempt to return a value in the
    # same field/ring as x.
    try:
        return x.parent()(1)
    except AttributeError:
        # In case something without a parent was given for x.
        return 1
```

The exceptional case is just there as a failsafe, and it would probably give a python int. I guess ZZ(1) is better, so I've changed it.

If `n` is a python int, we're happy. Early in the function we check that `n` can be coerced into `ZZ`. Then later,

```
# Ensure that (2**n) is an element of ZZ. This is used later --
# we can divide finite field elements by integers but we can't
# multiply them by rationals at the moment.
n = ZZ(n)
```


For speed, the current implementation has,

```
sage: timeit('legendre_P(100,x)')
5 loops, best of 3: 57.1 ms per loop
```

The posted patch has,

```
sage: timeit('legendre_P(100,x)')
5 loops, best of 3: 47.3 ms per loop
```

So, even for the unscaled version it's an improvement. There's a slowdown for the scaled version, of course:

```
sage: timeit('legendre_P(100,x,-5,10)')
5 loops, best of 3: 70.4 ms per loop
```

But it's still very fast.

You're right about the reference, I must have typo'd it. It's fixed, and I've added a REFERENCES section to the docs.

The new patch is up, I forgot to check the box, so use the one with the "2" at the end.

Thanks.  I'm glad I asked, because before

```
sage: legendre_P(0,float(1))
1
sage: type(_)
<type 'int'>
```
but now

```
sage: legendre_P(0,float(1))
1
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```

Work:
* So to my surprise, plotting these things works great.  It would be nice to add one or two examples.
* I wouldn't ask for this on this ticket, but it probably should have one or two examples of the errors actually catching silly input.  I find it worthwhile to test those branches.
Is that okay?  Otherwise I think this is nice.

**Attachment:** [trac_13720_review.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13720/trac_13720_review.patch.gz)

I really don't understand why `a` and `b` get converted into symbolic expressions.  This has some very strange consequences, e.g.,

```
sage: legendre_P(3, 7, -1/2, 1/2).parent()
Symbolic Ring
```
It is my understanding that coercion should arrange that the parent of an expression is as close as possible to the parents of the constituant parts.  It is thus wrong to force (almost) everything into the Symbolic Ring.

But anyway, I'm afraid I still prefer my version of the code: (1) for its simplicity (having 3 local functions, two of them only used once, seems far too over-elaborate); (2) my code is significantly faster.

If you don't like that then something like

```
    if a == -1 and b == 1:
        _init()
        return sage_eval(maxima.eval('legendre_p(%s,x)'%ZZ(n)), locals={'x':x})
    else:
        return legendre_P(n, (2*x - a - b)/(b - a), -1, 1)
```
would be a very simple change to the existing code which avoids 'reinventing the wheel'.  This would also have the advantage that an almost identical change would provide scaled versions for the the Legendre functions `legendre_Q` of the second kind.  However the maxima code is very slow.

Incidentally, in all cases there needs to be a check to see if `a == b`.

I had a comment in the code about this, but I've forgotten the details. In any case -- whatever the issue was -- it seems to be fixed. I removed the manual coercions of n,a,b and all of the tests still pass.

So this is fixed:

```
sage: legendre_P(3, 7, -1/2, 1/2).parent()
Rational Field
```


> Incidentally, in all cases there needs to be a check to see if `a == b`.  

This will throw a divide-by-zero. What's the alternative?

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A27):

Those two functions are different than our `legendre_{P,Q}`. Maxima has matching `legendre_p(n,x)` and `legendre_q(n,x)` which we're currently using for our implementations.

I updated the note on the wiki page.

It would be tricky since `legendre_P` is now implemented as a `BuiltinFunction`. You would need a different symbolic function for each interval `[a,b]` because, for example, its symbolic derivative changes when the interval does. But it's probably doable somehow.

I was the original reporter and also the author. If I remember correctly, I needed it to simplify  some finite element example problem, and these days I have no need for it. But naturally I wouldn't object to someone else making an attempt.
