Currently, computing the determinant, minimum polynomial, characteristic polynomial, etc of sparse matrices over the integers and finite fields switch them to a dense representation, then runs the dense algorithm.

This works, but is quite suboptimal. Linbox packs a few algorithms tailored for sparse matrices, e.g. iterative methods for the determinant, minpoly, etc. These methods have the advantage that they only read the matrix, and are memory efficient.

The aim of this ticket is to make these algorithms available in Sage.
