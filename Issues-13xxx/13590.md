Random simplicial complexes don't have the right number of vertices. From the doctests:

```
            sage: simplicial_complexes.RandomComplex(6, 2)
            Simplicial complex with vertex set (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and 15 facets
            sage: simplicial_complexes.RandomComplex(6,12)
            Simplicial complex with vertex set (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) and facets {(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)}
```
In both cases, these should have 6 vertices, but they have 7 and 8 instead. Thus this method gives mathematically incorrect answers. The attached patch fixes the problems.
