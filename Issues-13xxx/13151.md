On the Skynet machine `mark` (Solaris SPARC), pickling a `Matrix_modn_dense_double` results in a Bus Error (as reported at #12841):

I tried `gcc -munaligned-doubles` but that didn't help.

The problem seems to be that malloc on 32-bit SPARC solaris generally returns 4-byte aligned buffers.

That's not necessarily the case.  The string `<char*>s` isn't directly generated from a `malloc`, instead it is the result of a `PyString_AsString()` call.  That isn't guaranteed to be 8-bytes aligned.

The obvious solution is to allocate a buffer ourselves, fill that and pass the result to `PyString_FromStringAndSize(buf, size)`. This will cause an extra `memcpy()` but that might be unavoidable.

You could try building the current Sage with that `gcc` version instead of using the GCC spkg (note that we currently only support the Sun linker on Solaris, but that's okay).

I built Sage sage-5.3.rc0 on a Sun Blade 2000 (2 x UltraSPARC III 1200 MHz CPUs, 8 GB RAM) using gcc 4.5.0, which was on my system, and so I did **not** use the gcc packaged with Sage. I get the same problem, so it is not some bug related to the particular gcc in Sage. 

Is Skynet's SPARC machine running? If not, and someone wants to look at this, they can use my SPARC. I don't keep it on 24/7, but now I am writing some code to control a vector network analyzer, so the machine will be on for a week or two.

OK, you write the patch or me (just asking to avoid duplicating effort).

It would be really cool if we could have full SPARC suppport in sage-5.9, and maybe even full Cygwin support also.
