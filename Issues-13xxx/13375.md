Sage crashes with the following code

```python
p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(maximization=False, solver = "GLPK")
p.set_problem_name(''.join('a' for j in range(256)))
```
because the name is longer than 255 chars.

I wrote a patch that checks the length before passing it to GLPK and raises an exception in case it would be too long.

Hello,

please add your real name to the "Authors" field of the ticket

Your ticket looks allright to me:
* I can confirm the defect you patch is trying to solve
* I could apply the patch without problems
* No errors found in your coding, the ValueError is thrown as promised
* Although you did not change the doc I ran the doctest, of course: No issues

A small but helpful change! 

Thanks!

Christian
