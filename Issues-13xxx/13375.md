Sage crashes with the following code

```python
p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(maximization=False, solver = "GLPK")
p.set_problem_name(''.join('a' for j in range(256)))
```
because the name is longer than 255 chars.

Hello,

please add your real name to the "Authors" field of the ticket

Your ticket looks allright to me:
* I can confirm the defect you patch is trying to solve
* I could apply the patch without problems
* No errors found in your coding, the ValueError is thrown as promised
* Although you did not change the doc I ran the doctest, of course: No issues

A small but helpful change! 

Thanks!

Christian
