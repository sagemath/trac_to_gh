Projective points and morphisms are currently only support over fields. Support for rings is needed.

Summary: Adding support for rings in projective spaces.

See comments from: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-devel/HXXqQ_XP358


point.py:

-no automatic normalization (as is currently done with fields)

-implemented `__eq__` and `__ne__`, added a note in `__cmp__` for ell_point.py that `__eq__` and `__ne__` are implemented for projective points

-implemented scale_by() - scales the coordinates by a given amount

-implemented normalize_coordinates() - removes the gcd of the coordinates


morphism.py:

-no automatic gcd removal (even over CC this does not work)
This change reverses part of Trac: 3964 (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/3964)

-removed "immutable" for .__polys since you can scale projective coordinates

-added "check" to `__call__` to help deal with indeterminacies and allow for bypassing the initialization checks for points

-implemented scale_by() - scales the coordinates by a given amount

-implemented normalize_coordinates() - removes the gcd of the coordinates


homset.py:

-allowed rings


projective_space.py:

-implemented dimension() - since the current implementation was giving incorrect values when the base ring is a ring (for example ZZ)


general changes:

-added many examples

-cleaned up imports

I ran -t on each of the following files:

* schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_point.py
* schemes/generic/homset.py
* schemes/generic/morphism.py
* schemes/generic/point.py
* schemes/generic/projective_space.py
* schemes/readme.py

and "All tests passed!" 

I ran -coverage to check the doctest coverage, all affected files had 100% coverage, except: 

* schemes/generic/morphism.py (95%) 
* schemes/generic/point.py (37%)

****************
I brought morphism.py to 100%, but point.py is still missing things.

I ran --testall --long and got the following error:

```
******************************
File "/Users/annahaensch/sage-5.2/devel/sage/sage/interfaces/r.py", line 1169:
    sage: os.path.realpath(tmpdir) == sageobj(r.getwd())
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
******************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of   7 in __main__.example_43
Test Failed**** 1 failures.
```

Just to be sure, I ran a longtest just on interfaces/r.py, and all tests passed, which is unsurprising, since this patch doesn't touch that file…not sure what to do about that one.

I ran -docbuild reference html and got one LaTex error, line 531 of sage/schemes/generic/projective_space.py.  Changed <code>\`\PP^N\`</code> to <code>'\mathbb{P}^N\` </code>.

I wasn't sure what the convention was for fixing patches.  If that's easier, I can certainly upload a new patch to reflect that convention.

> It is also not clear if failures in `r.py` are related to this ticket. Do you always get an error with `--testall` when this patch is installed and never without it?

That's correct.  Before testing this patch I built sage-5.2 from source and ran --testall --long, and all tests passed.  I applied the patch, re-ran the test, and got the error.

* `dimension` method is defined to just return `relative_dimension` Why??? `dimension` does work already and works differently:

 ```
 sage: ProjectiveSpace(3,QQ["y"],'x').dimension_relative()

 sage: ProjectiveSpace(3,QQ["y"],'x').dimension()
 4
```
 The patch breaks backward compatibility and makes dimension inconsistent between different spaces.

as another data point the --testall --long passes on my machine (Ubuntu)

To answer the questions in the last comment:

The formatting I can address. I had thought I'd followed the conventions, but I'll go back through and check all the changes.

_element_constructor was removed since it was simply returning NotImplemented. As in 
points_projective_field, removing that place holder allows the SchemeHomset_points _element_constructor to be used for point_projective_ring


SchemeMorphism_polynomial_projective_space was moved to have the projective classes together. If it is more standard in Sage to have the `_polynomial_` classes together, then I can certainly move it back.


Dimension was changed since it seemed to be not working for projective spaces. Before the new dimension function you would get

sage: ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2,'x').dimension()

2

sage: ProjectiveSpace(ZZ,2,'x').dimension()

3

I assumed that the value for ZZ was wrong. Although it seems that Spec(ZZ).dimension() does in fact return 1 while Spec(QQ).dimension() returns 0. Is this really the desired behavior, that the dimension of projective space over the integers is +1?
