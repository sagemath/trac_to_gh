Assignee: jason, was

Keywords: matrix space

The following code does not return in sage 5.1.rc1.

```
sage: MatrixSpace(Qp(3),1,1)([Qp(3).zero()]) 
```

The problem is that the matrix constructor tries to unpack a padic zero which is an infinite list of zeros.

Another example where the unpacking does not work is the following:

```
sage: MatrixSpace(Qp(3),1,1)([Qp(3)(4/3)])
[1 + O(3^20)]
```

The problem here is that the iterator returned for a padic (implicitly defined through `__getitem__`) starts at the term with valuation 0.

I think that padics should probably not return iterators at all.

What should the iterator for `Qp(3).zero()` be â€” should it be infinite or empty? Should the iterator for `Zp(3)(3)` and `Qp(3)(3)` iterate over `[0,1]` or over `[1]`?

I believe that if one wants to iterate over the terms, then one should have to call `.list()` or similar explicitly.

I think the real problem is that your example is missing some parentheses

```
sage: MatrixSpace(Qp(3),1)([[Qp(3).zero()]])
[0]
sage: MatrixSpace(Qp(3),1,1)([[Qp(3)(4/3)]])
[3^-1 + 1 + O(3^19)]
```

This causes the matrix constructor to look if it can unpack the element Qp(3).zero()] in the list [Qp(3).zero()] .

If you want it also to work with fewer parentheses I'd say that it's the fault of MatrixSpace.__call__ not checking if Qp(3).zero() is a ring element before just trying to unpack it.

Note that it's not only the p-adics that give rise to strange behaviour. You can also use polynomials:

```
sage: K.<x>=QQ[]
sage: MatrixSpace(K,2)([x+2,3*x+4])
[2 1]
[4 3]
```

Thanks for pointing this out Maarten.

I'll have a look if the check you propose can be done easily. Btw, the original problem I had was the following:

```
sage: K=Qp(3)
sage: V=K^1
sage: V.hom([V.zero()])
```

This hangs and there don't seem to be any parentheses missing, right?

So apparently the `hom` does too much unpacking along the way.

Anyway, I'll look into this and most probably split this ticket into two tickets, since I still think that padics should not be iterable.
