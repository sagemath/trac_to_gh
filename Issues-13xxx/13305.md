Looks good, but there are doctest failures:

```
sage -t --long src/doc/de/tutorial/tour_numtheory.rst  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/doc/fr/tutorial/tour_numtheory.rst  # 1 doctest failed

```
They all look like this:

```
File "src/doc/de/tutorial/tour_numtheory.rst", line 160, in doc.de.tutorial.tour_numtheory
Failed example:
    K.units()
Expected:
    [3*a^2 + 13*a + 13]
Got:
    (3*a^2 + 13*a + 13,)
