Some comments:
1. Line 1308 is missing a backtick on closing.

```
Returns the leading term of ``self`` i.e., ``self.lc()*self.lm()`. The
```
2. Lines 1577 and 1578 should have the latex variables enclosed in single backticks not double (like <code>\`I = (f_1,...,f_r)\`</code>:

```
       given an ideal ``I = (f_1,...,f_r)`` and some ``g (== self)`` in ``I``, find 
        ``s_1,...,s_r`` such that ``g = s_1*f_1 + ... + s_r*f_r``. 
```
3. Shouldn't line 1975 also have `\ne` in the latter expression?

```
        - `LT(g_i) \neq LT(g_j)` for all `i != j` 
```
4. Should we refer to the `derivative()` function in line 342 instead as <code>:meth:\`sage.calculus.functional.derivative\`</code> ? This will create a hyperlink to the derivative documentation in the notebook help.
5. I am not very happy to see lots of "self" throughout the docs, but converting all of them would be a lot of work. So, I guess we can just let it pass and hope it gets fixed little by little over time.
6. Most importantly, this patch touches a huge number of lines in several files. I am ok with this change (in fact, ok with any change which improves docs), but ultimately its up to Jeroen whether this gets merged, since he doesn't usually like massive minor changes. :)

Removing the "beginner" tag from old tickets. Some could be returned to beginner-friendly status by adding a comment about what needs to be done. Some others might be easy for an experienced developer to finish.
