When a symbol returned by `SR.symbol()` is passed through Maxima, it is turned into another symbol. They compare equal (because comparison invokes Maxima, probably) but they are not the same object.

This sounds as if it should not make a big difference, but it does in the case of Taylor series. In this example, I try to obtain taylor series coefficients. The call to `coefficient` returns zero, however, because the variable has changed identity because the Taylor series was generated by Maxima.

sage: bool(converted_s == s)

sage: converted_x1 = x1._maxima_().sage()

The problem is a little more widespread:

```
sage: s = SR.symbol()
sage: s1 = s._maxima_().sage()
sage: s2 = sage.calculus.calculus.maxima(s).sage()
sage: s3 = integrate(s,s).variables()[0]
sage: [id(s),id(s1),id(s2),id(s3)]
[140326504362424, 96060840, 96060840, 96060696]
sage: (s^2 + 3*s + 1).taylor(s,0,2).coefficient(s3)
0
sage: (s1^2 + 3*s1 + 1).taylor(s1,0,2).coefficient(s3)
0
sage: (s3^2 + 3*s3 + 1).taylor(s3,0,2).coefficient(s1)
3
```

```
sage: s = SR('t')
sage: s1 = s._maxima_().sage()
sage: s2 = sage.calculus.calculus.maxima(s).sage()
sage: s3 = integrate(s,s).variables()[0]
sage: [id(s),id(s1),id(s2),id(s3)]
[95996024, 95996024, 95996024, 96062064]
sage: (s^2 + 3*s + 1).taylor(s,0,2).coefficient(s3)

sage: L=[integrate(s,s).variables()[0] for i in range(10)]
sage: [id(l) for  l in L]

```
As you see, the variables produced by integrate, which go through the symbol-based interface with libmaxima (i.e., no direct string translations) don't maintain symbol identity at all. However, that doesn't always seem to affect how they behave (perhaps the python wrapper id doesn't reflect the identity of the wrapped pynac entity).

Perhaps `SR.symbol` produces an "uninterned" symbol? In that case, the most straightforward solution would be to let `SR.symbol()` produce interned symbols. That would leak memory, but converting symbols to maxima already does (because we have to interface with a non-refcounting system)

What do you mean by an "uninterned" symbol? Is that a Sage, a Pynac, or a Maxima concept?

`SR.symbol()` is intended to return uninterned symbols when called without an argument. In the source, you will see that there is a branch `if name is None:` where `pynac_symbol_registry[name] = e` is not called. My intention was to let the user create symbolic variables without the risk of picking the name of a variable used in the input. 

The conversion back from Maxima always creates an interned symbol if it cannot find one already existing in the registry. I admit that this use case never occured to me before. So we have a bug.

I don't want to lose the current `SR.symbol()` behavior (uninterned symbols). One possible solution here is to keep two symbol registries. Keeping the current one and introducing a new one which contains all symbols including the "uninterned" ones, to be used for Maxima conversions.
