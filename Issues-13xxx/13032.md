This is needed to eliminate the majority of the build time when switching between various branches in the git based workflow. It is also useful in the short run for dramatically speeding up the build process for many spkgs.

Installation:
* Add the spkg http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/ccache-3.1.8.spkg to spkg/standard
* Apply [attachment:trac13032_root.1.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13032/trac13032_root.1.patch) to the root repository
* Apply [attachment:trac13032_scripts.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13032/trac13032_scripts.patch) to the scripts repository 
* Apply [attachment:trac13032_doc.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13032/trac13032_doc.patch) to the sage library

This is set in the spkg-install to 3G.

Both good points, I'll see about changing these.

I just reported the problem upstream. A special dispensation is irrelevant, it must be GPL since it derivative of ccache-2.4, which is licensed under GPL-2+, so it is an issue with violating the GPL.

Regardless, I think it would be best to place a f90cache spkg in a different ticket.

I don't understand what you're trying to say here.  The GPL talks both about running the code (I guess this is what you refer to when talking about "the body of its source code in general") and distributing the code.  Running and distributing are two essentially independent things, but both governed by the same license.

sage -sh ccache --max-size=SIZE

surely isn't correct.  Either you mean "first run `./sage --sh`, then `ccache --max-size=SIZE`", or you mean "`sage --sh -c "ccache --max-size=SIZE"`" or you mean "`sage --ccache --max-size=SIZE`" with adding a `--ccache` option to `spkg/bin/sage`.

Actually it turns out you have to make a bit of a hack to make it optional while integrating with the build system (since part of the point is that you would want it to cache as much of the build as possible).

I've been working with the git layout too much, where it is easy to get to the point of `newest_version` working, but where `sage-spkg` can't find the spkgs, so it tries to download them all (problem here is that `newest_version` relies on the spkg being included with the sources).

I am installing a system ATLAS now. I have been bitten a bit too many times with failing ATLAS builds with sage. It's not a fault of sage; it is probably that the laptop overheats or something. It builds fine on a desktop.

That said, the root patch needs to be rebased on sage-5.4.rc. The rebased patch is [available here](https://github.com/ppurka/sage-patches/blob/master/sage_root/trac13032_root.1.patch). I forgot to upload it, but maybe you can take that, rename it, and upload it here, as the original file name.

Just to check, cchache is shared across sage builds, right?

Regarding ATLAS, ideally most people will either be using a system build or match one of the pre-shipped tuning parameters.

Because it keeps the sage files in a fixed sage directory instead of the home directory of the user. The default sizes of those directories are huge (4G) and are needed because Sage itself is huge. I am already using 3.5G of that.

I still don't quite like how this patch uses a separate `CCACHE_DIR` inside `.sage`.  Because now, I have:

```
$ ccache -s
cache directory                     /home/jdemeyer/.ccache
[...]
cache size                           3.2 Gbytes
max cache size                       4.0 Gbytes
```

```
$ ./sage --sh
(sage-sh) ccache -s
cache directory                     /home/jdemeyer/.sage//ccache
[...]
cache size                         935.1 Mbytes
max cache size                       1.0 Gbytes
```

I would like to have just one `.ccache` directory, especially since my default ccache dir is already used for Sage.  I don't think we should add 1GB of data inside the home directories of unsuspecting users.

Also note that the default size of 1GB is too little anyway to be useful for Sage.

You can of course have only one ccache dir. In that case, simply define the environment variable `CCACHE_DIR` in your shell rc file. Then everything will use that directory. The default is set for those people who don't bother with setting up ccache variables.

Because I don't consider cache compilation files to be Sage-related.

Imagine I want to compile a package X outside of Sage, a package which happens to be part of Sage (I do that with PARI for example). Then it's a pity that the cached object files for package X appear twice in my home directory: once in `.ccache` and once in `.sage`.

My problem really boils down to this: why would you want a separate ccache directory for Sage?

I would say that, by not setting `CCACHE_DIR`, I am showing a preference for the default ccache directory `$HOME/.ccache`

I think that setting a variable explicitly to its default value should be the same as not setting it at all.

I must reiterate. **If** you don't provide any ccache directory settings at all, then [it is set to 4GB](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13032/trac13032_doc.patch) with this ticket/spkg.

Well, then you set your ccache environment variable appropriately. To use ccache while compiling with sage you need to set `SAGE_INSTALL_CCACHE=yes` in your environment variable. Then, it will use whatever ccache directory you have set and otherwise it will use the default of ~/.sage/ccache.

In fact, one question that I would ask is - what other sage setting is present outside the ~/.sage directory? If there is, then it makes sense to mix and match sage specific settings and folders with system/user specific settings.

Again false, as a system ccache might be used.

>Probably Sage's readline uses non-Sage-specific configuration files (`$HOME/.inputrc`).

Does Sage *change* `~/.inputrc` or  just read it? Sage of course reads tons of files all over the system. An example of another dotfile in `~` that Sage (or Sage's Mercurial anyway) reads is `~/.hgrc`. But it will *change* `~/.ccache`.

>Of course it's not much burden for me, but what about other people in the same situation?

As I said, we can print a note at the end of the SPKG installation process, or otherwise document it. I suspect that most users will not mind that the ccache directory `~/.sage/ccache` is used, and if they do, it is probably because they are already running ccache on their system and want to consolidate the cache directories together, so they're probably savvy enough to make a symlink.

>This patch changes the ccache directory and the cache size *behind people's back* if they were using system ccache before.

Sage installs another copy of Python on the system "behind people's back" as well and nobody complains (or at least we don't listen to such complaints). I don't see the problem.

Also, maybe I am misunderstanding something. Are you saying that installing this SPKG into Sage will change the behavior of the system ccache running independently of Sage?

>Which is a problem because ...........?

For one thing, it means more detritus around the system to clean up if you want to remove Sage from your system. And very large unwanted detritus at that, if the user doesn't have a system ccache. Of course, it's an optional package, so we can assume the user at least knows they have installed the ccache SPKG, but most users would expect that they can completely eradicate Sage and all its artifacts by deleting the Sage directory and `$DOT_SAGE`.

Also, this kind of lack of compartmentalization just seems unhygienic. I kind of don't like the idea of Sage interacting with and modifying data that belongs to other programs which I've installed systemwide. I like that Sage is a sandbox mini-distribution of software which is self-contained.

I'd argue that in this case, the interaction is a feature, not a bug.

> And very large unwanted detritus at that, if the user doesn't have a system ccache

But I do have system-wide ccache. For me, this patch adds 1GB of extra detritus in `.sage/ccache` and actually **reduces performance** by using a smaller cache.

I think what you are really asking about is

*What should the zero-configuration scenario, even for advanced users, look like?*

I count you as an advanced user since you are using a user-wide ccache, and you don't want sage to use any other ccache directory by default. On top of that, you want sage to use the ccache directory that you are already using, which may or may not be the default ccache directory.

I think this question should be asked to the general audience in sage-devel. There might be people who keep the ~/.sage directory separate, along with the rest of their sage installation. For a heavy user of sage or for someone running a server, I can contemplate that the ~/.sage (or `DOT_SAGE`) will not be small and there might be people who are using a different (maybe mounted) directory that is separate from their home directory.
