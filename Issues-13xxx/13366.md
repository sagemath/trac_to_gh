Adds two new families of groups to Sage's named permgroups database.
These are two families of p-groups notable for the fact that each group contains a cyclic subgroup of index p. 

The semidihedral groups are 2-groups which can be thought of as the semidirect product of `C_2` with `C_2^{m-1}`, for some m, where `C_2` acts on `C_2^{m-1}` by sending elements to their `-1+2^{m-2}` th power. It adds new groups, not part of any other family of named permgroups, of order `2^m` for each m greater than or equal to 4.

The splitmetcyclic groups are p-groups which can be thought of as the semidirect product of `C_p` with `C_p^{m-1}`, for some m, where where `C_p` acts on `C_p^{m-1}` by sending elements to their `1+p^{m-2}` th power. It adds new groups of order `p^m`, for odd p and m greater than or equal to 3, and new groups of order `2^m` for m greater than or equal to 4.
