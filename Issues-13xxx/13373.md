```
The following works right after extracting the Sage source tarball:

```
./sage -i /path/to/foo.spkg
```
But this doesn't work for remote packages:

```
./sage -i http://example.com/foo.spkg
```
or

```
./sage -i foo
```
Using either `wget`, `curl` or system Python, we should also make this work.

**Apply**:
1. [attachment:13373_sage-i.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13373/13373_sage-i.patch) to `SAGE_ROOT`.
2. [attachment:13373_remove_scripts.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13373/13373_remove_scripts.patch) to `SAGE_LOCAL/bin`.

<a id='comment:1'></a>
So we need some `sage-latest-online-package` and `sage-download_package` [replacement / wrapper] scripts in `spkg/bin/`?

(In case there's some capable system-wide Python in the user's `PATH`, the original scripts [copied to `spkg/bin/`] should already work, right?)

To not have different files with the same name (in `local/bin/` and `spkg/bin/`), we might rename the current [Python] versions to `*.py` and make `sage-{latest-online-package,download_package}` plain shell scripts (then moved to `spkg/bin/`), which just call the original Python implementation if appropriate (Sage's or some other Python available), or otherwise mimic the behavior using `wget` or `curl`.

We could probably drop the Python implementations completely in favor of Bash versions (although in theory neither `wget` nor `curl` [nor `perl`], but some `python` may be available), but as the features of these scripts are IMHO unlikely to change, we can keep parallel implementations without hassle as well.

**Attachment:** [latest-online-spkg.sh](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13373/latest-online-spkg.sh)

Ok, couldn't resist to write [some shell script](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13373/latest-online-spkg.sh) to replace `sage-latest-online-package`, using `curl`, `wget` or `$URL_GRABBER` instead of Python (which the shell script currently doesn't support at all), and not requiring any "Sage environment".

Do what you want with it... ;-)

Replacing `sage-download_package` like that should be even easier, I just haven't [yet] done so...

Now if the programs are not available, sage-download-file is executed four times (`for repo in optional experimental standard archive; do ...`), so the error message prints four times.

I was wondering if you could use egrep instead of grep. sed is fine, though...

Why do you use `>&2` on line 280 in `echo >&2 "Found $PKG_NAME"`?

I think it might be clearer with some extra output, say like this:

With Sage's Python, hitting ctrl-c not only interrupts the download but also causes the file to be deleted: the `if` block in the following gets executed:

```sh
    sage-download-file "$PKG_URL" >"$PKG_TMP"
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        # Delete failed download
        rm -f "$PKG_TMP"
        echo >&2 "Error: failed to download package $PKG_NAME"
        exit 1
    fi
```

Personally, I wouldn't worry about the non-deleting of that temporary file and just leave things as they are.  That temporary file will be overwritten anyway if the user tries to download that package again.

Concerning `patch`: one can always do

```
./sage -i patch
./sage -i openssl
```
That should work, so I wouldn't worry too much either.
