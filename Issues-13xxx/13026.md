This all makes sense.  I've opened #13056 to address that we might eventually want to have the docs available again.

All spkg and geometry/ tests pass on sage.math and my MacBook Pro.  As discussed with Andrew, just want to make sure that hard links were used as pointed out in SPKG.txt, which I can't check - otherwise positive review.

Your changes could run into timestamp troubles, when the timestamp of the `Makefile.am` file is more recent than the `Makefile.in` file. This might cause `automake` to be run and should be avoided. Since "am" comes alphabetically before "in", you will not actually run into this problem, but it seems fragile to rely on that.

A standard solution that I have used for several packages is to create 1 patch file which patches both the `.am` and the `.in` file **in that order**. `patch` applies patches in order of the patch file.

Alternatively we can just elect to not patch the `.am` files since they aren't needed during the actual build process. I just updated the spkg so it will skip those patches.

My only change was to add the following in the patch loop:

```sh
if echo "$patch" | grep 'Makefile.am.patch$' > /dev/null; then
    continue

This isn't such a big deal, but since your goal is better standardization of packages, you should use `-p1` patch files.

Bonus points for patching `sage -pkg` to check that all files are indeed world readable and all directories listable. On another ticket, of course ;-)

I take it that `src/ChangeLog (Autosaved)` (outdated version of `src/ChangeLog`) was already in the upstream sources. Does anybody know which editor has such a tempfile convention? But oh well if upstream ships it then we should include it by default ;-)

I think upstream is also missing some auto-generated files, or has mismatched versions. When I just configure/make the vanillas sources, I get

```

aclocal.m4:16: warning: this file was generated for autoconf 2.63.
You have another version of autoconf.  It may work, but is not guaranteed to.
If you have problems, you may need to regenerate the build system entirely.
To do so, use the procedure documented by the package, typically `autoreconf'.

While I'm still in favour of just replacing all the autotool'ed files by new ones generated from scratch, I guess its good enough if this builds on all buildbot machines.

Looking at the log file, I *did not* get this problem with the spkg I tested in [comment:28]. Could it be that you accidentally messed up the timestamps?

I do consider it a serious issue, because it could cause build failures on systems which don't have autotools (or which have the wrong version) installed.

As far as I can tell this spkg is still patching cddlib pretty heavily (the random.* stuff) and adding two executables which aren't in upstream (cdd_both_reps_gmp and cdd_both_reps).

That means debian's cddlib (which comes from upstream) is incompatible with sage's fork.

We are shipping the extra executables in Gentoo. I guess a better solution for a distro would be to split them in a separate package. Have to check the random stuff, autotool patching is quite necessary as far as I remember.

I wanted to contact upstream and query about the bunch of patches we apply and if they were aware of it when I was working on #13354 to be able to build a shared library  on cygwin, but then I thought I should first ask here if someone already tried just in case, and cddlib is not really a problem for cygwin as the static lib seems to work ok and I went on to something else and it was maybe 8 or 7 monthes ago...

So yes, I think we should definitely contact upstream first.
Most of the teams I've contacted for #13354 have reacted quite quickly.
Of course some gave some signs of life and then disappeared.
And some never reacted.
But who knows, we should contact them first.

Note that in the case of lrcalc, see #13839, upstream even ended up distributing two tarballs:
* one historical, with the build system they developped;
* one based on our patches, with an autotool based build system.
