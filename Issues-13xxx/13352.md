This patch improves the running time of the `bitset_len` method by using `mpn_popcount()`.

Before:

```
sage: B = Bitset('10'*10000)
sage: len(B)
10000
sage: %timeit len(B)
1000 loops, best of 3: 245 us per loop
```

After:

```
sage: B = Bitset('10'*10000)
sage: len(B)
10000
sage: %timeit len(B)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.52 us per loop
```

This patch also reorganizes the bitset files, including deleting the `sage/misc/bitset_pxd.pxi` file.

I'd rather "implement" the functions in C (where you can use the C preprocessor and `__builtin_popcount()` if available) and write a thin Cython wrapper.

GCC e.g. chooses efficient machine implementations (probably a single instruction), depending on the (configured or specified) target and perhaps also further compiler flags.

Note that GMP has functions like `mpz_popcount()` for `mpz_t`s as well.

As reported in https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/GnudTUwbGG4, I tried to implement the function in C with `__builtin_popcount()`. I was able to compile successfully, but then sage was not working anymore.
See attached patch [attachment:trac_13352-bitcount-in-c.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13352/trac_13352-bitcount-in-c.patch).


> Note that GMP has functions like `mpz_popcount()` for `mpz_t`s as well.

It could be another solution, but I have not been able yet to find how to access the functions used for int behind? 


> Not sure what the `parallel` refers to ... ;-)

In fact, the 4 lines ` n = __COUNT32__(n, 0) ` can be executed in parallel and gcc is sometimes able to optimize the sequence of instructions. For instance, all methods have similar running times on my macbook air, but parallel methods are slower on my old PC (system still in 32-bits...).

Well, obviously not, since you have the data dependence on `n`. ;-)





Btw., you should use `UINT32_C(1)` instead of `0x1u` etc., and e.g. `UINT32_MAX` instead of `(<uint32_t>-1)` (Cython code) etc.

The types of the shift parameters (of `__TWO??__()`) are slightly overdim'ed...

I'm able to import UINT32_MAX, but not UINT32_C.
- with `from libc.stdint cimport UINT32_C`: it is apparently not imported
- with `from libc.stdint import UINT32_C`: it compiles, but sage crashes with weird messages

Any special trick?

Hello,

Since I have now understood how to use `__builtin_popcountl` (not obvious when you don't know), I have uploaded a new version of the patch.

before:

```
sage: B = Bitset('00'*10000+'1')
sage: len(B)
1
sage: %timeit len(B)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 268 ns per loop
sage: B = Bitset('10'*10000)
sage: len(B)
10000
sage: %timeit len(B)
1000 loops, best of 3: 245 us per loop
sage: B = Bitset('10'*1000000)
sage: len(B)
1000000
sage: %timeit len(B)
10 loops, best of 3: 24.1 ms per loop
```

after:

```
sage: B = Bitset('00'*10000+'1')
sage: len(B)
1
sage: %timeit len(B)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 275 ns per loop
sage: B = Bitset('10'*10000)
sage: len(B)
10000
sage: %timeit len(B)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.52 us per loop
sage: B = Bitset('10'*1000000)
sage: len(B)
1000000
sage: %timeit len(B)
1000 loops, best of 3: 236 us per loop
```


I'm wondering if I should add a wrapper in case the `__builtin_popcountl` method is not available. This is not difficult, but I don't know which environnement variables should be tested.

Thanks.

I have now implemented the function in C in file `popcount.h` with a small wrapper. The result is a bit slower than without wrapper, but still way faster than previous method.

```
sage: B = Bitset('00'*10000+'1')
sage: len(B)
1
sage: %timeit len(B)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 361 ns per loop
sage: B = Bitset('10'*10000)
sage: %timeit len(B)
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.03 us per loop
sage: B = Bitset('10'*1000000)
sage: len(B)
1000000
sage: %timeit len(B)
1000 loops, best of 3: 287 us per loop
```

I have used the `_WIN32` flag, but I'm not sure it's the good one. So if one knows the best flag to use to detect when the `__builtin_popcount` method is not available, please let me know.

Hello,

after browsing the web, I came up with this new version. The current version tests is the cpu has builtin support. If yes, we use builtin version. Else, we use hakmem methods.
* http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/X86-Built_002din-Functions.html
* http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.8/changes.html
* http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-ext4/msg35827.html

We don't need all the methods for `bitset_len` but it could be useful for other usage.

Let me know if it is OK.

Volker said that it should be sufficient to make it a .cc file, and that GCC would take the hint and use the right compiler instead. It does work when outside of Sage :

Though there does not seem to be anything wrong with "default" on my computer. Which version of gcc are you using ? It's probably < 4.8.

Similar improvements could be made to other bitset functions (in particular to `bitset_next()` and the like). But that would be for a new ticket...

Strangely, many places were importing `bitset` without actually using bitsets... so I removed those redundant imports.

Even stranger were two files `sage/combinat/debruijn_sequence.pxd` and `sage/matroids/unpickling.pxd` containing just one line

```
include 'sage/misc/bitset_pxd.pxi' 
```
which was in both cases unused.

Excellent! The patch is working perfectly (install, doctests on sage/ , etc.). The simplification of the hamming weight method is also very good.

Thank you very much.

This is ridiculous and shows how fast `mpn_popcount()` is:

sage: B = FrozenBitset(capacity=10^5)
sage: timeit('B.isempty()', repeat=100, number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 100: 980 ns per loop
