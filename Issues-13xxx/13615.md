As of Sage 5.4, we can compute l-isogenies of elliptic curves only for l=2,3,5,7,13 (the ones for which X_0(l) has genus 0), together with some "sporadic" degrees which can occur over QQ.

In this ticket we will add extra functionality to be able to compute l-isogenies for arbitrary prime degrees.

The patches apply fine to version 5.11.beta3.  But there are some issues which need to be addressed:

1. The references to John C and Jenny C need to be moved to the new file, and the header information on the new file needs to be completed with additional author, dates, etc. with a citation to Kimi's thesis for justification of all the formulae.

2. Some new functions have no docstring, or no one-line summary:  `hyperelliptic_isogeny_data`,  `Psi2`.

3. `least_semi_primitive` docstring missing an asterisk.

4. The interface to the isogeny function from the elliptic curve class in `ell_field.py` needs to be updated, otherwise the new functionality will not be available to users!   This should include a new helper function in `isogenies_genus_0` which makes the decision about which of the three functions to call.   It will also be necessary to disable the code which allows for an empty list of primes to be given, since we can now handle *all* primes with the sole exception of the characteristic.

Nice work! I'm reviewing the patch, but of all the new functions in `isogeny_genus_0.py` the only one I could understand is `isogenies_prime_degree_general()`.

I can't seem to find Kimi's thesis online. Could you put it somewhere, so that we can compare with the theory? Also, it would be nice if the docstrings of the new functions pointed to the corresponding sections in Kimi's thesis (assuming that's the only source).

Here's more thoughts:

- It seems weird that `isogenies_prime_degree_general()` is in `isogeny_genus_0.py`. Why is it not in `ell_curve_isogeny.py()` or in some other *generic* place?

- `least_semi_primitive()` is a purely internal function, I would rename it to `_least_semi_primitive()`. 

- In the docstring of `least_semi_primitive()`, the `{1,-1}` should be `\{1,-1\}` (although this is not very important if you follow my previous suggestion).

I have put the thesis at http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/theses/tsukazaki.pdf
since it has not appeared on Warwick's official repository (but was approved in July 2013).

I agree that the filename is not wonderful, but we  did want to split off the general isogeny code now in ell_curve_isogeny from the special cases.  Perhaps you are right that the "general" one belongs in the other file.

`least_semi_primitive` is indeed internal. If I thught there would be other applications I might have suggested putting it with primitive roots and similar functions.

I am about to go on holiday, but feel free to ask more questions if you don't mind a little delay.

Perhaps you are right that the \"general\" one belongs in the other file.\n\n\nI agree, it is best to keep specific algorithms separate from the isogeny class. On second thought, all the algorithms in that file have something in common: they are generic algorithms only practical for small prime degrees (as you suggest in the title of the doc page). Maybe it's just the filename that needs to be changed. What about `isogenies_small_degree.py`?\n\n> `least_semi_primitive` is indeed internal.

Thanks for the link, and congratulations to Kimi. I quickly read it through. I obviously didn't check line by line, but no doubt that you got the maths and the coding right. So, I'm ready to give a positive review.

> I agree that the filename is not wonderful, but we  did want to split off the general isogeny code now in ell_curve_isogeny from the special cases.  Perhaps you are right that the "general" one belongs in the other file.


I agree, it is best to keep specific algorithms separate from the isogeny class. On second thought, all the algorithms in that file have something in common: they are generic algorithms only practical for small prime degrees (as you suggest in the title of the doc page). Maybe it's just the filename that needs to be changed. What about `isogenies_small_degree.py`?

> `least_semi_primitive` is indeed internal. If I thught there would be other applications I might have suggested putting it with primitive roots and similar functions.


I had the same feeling about the variable `isog_table` and the function `hyperelliptic_isogeny_data`. Hence, I renamed all the three by adding an underscore in front of them.

I also 

- Edited the copyright banner by adding your names
- Fixed the docstring of `_least_semi_primitive()`
- Added `ALGORITHM::` sections to some functions, pointing to the relevant chapter in Kimi's thesis.

I'm attaching my reviewer's patch. I'm working with the git repo, and I'm confused by this directory renaming stuff, so I guess it'll be easier if I link to my git branch on trac.

I'm not giving a positive review right away, so that you can review my patch, and give your opinion on renaming the file. Enjoy vacation!

Before your last patch they used to be only in one place: `_isog_table`, after they were replicated in `_sporadic_Q_data` **and** `isogenies_sporadic_Q`, making it harder to verify that you did not leave out some j by mistake.\n\n2. Efficiency-wise, your code does 11 + 11 equality tests in `QQ`, mine does 11 * 11. An equality test in `QQ` takes ~3\u03bcs on my laptop, and indeed testing `isogenies_sporadic_Q` I get a ~300\u03bcs slowdown for a curve which has no isogeny (and thus goes through all tests).

Yes, definitely. But,

1. These j-invariants are big numbers, hard to compare visually. Before your last patch they used to be only in one place: `_isog_table`, after they were replicated in `_sporadic_Q_data` **and** `isogenies_sporadic_Q`, making it harder to verify that you did not leave out some j by mistake.

2. Efficiency-wise, your code does 11 + 11 equality tests in `QQ`, mine does 11 * 11. An equality test in `QQ` takes ~3μs on my laptop, and indeed testing `isogenies_sporadic_Q` I get a ~300μs slowdown for a curve which has no isogeny (and thus goes through all tests). That's a serious penalty (about 10x) for a curve which has no isogeny, but it's negligible for a sporadic curve (where it takes in the order of milliseconds to return the isogeny). Do we really care?

`_sporadic_Q_data` takes less than 1/2 a second to compute its output from scratch for any j-invariant. I see no reason not to compute the data on the fly and store it with `@cached_function`

This new patch removes the precomputed data from the code (most of it is moved in the doctest), and makes `_sporadic_Q_data` a cached function. `isogeny_sporadic_Q` now tests its input against a dictionary mapping j-invariants to degrees, and is thus much faster on non-sporadic curves.

Here is the timings I get on my laptop.

```
sage: from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.isogeny_small_degree import sporadic_j, `_sporadic_Q_`data
sage: for j in sporadic_j.keys():
....:    timeit('_sporadic_Q_data(j)', globals=globals().update({'j':j}), number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 167 ms per loop
1 loops, best of 1: 71.2 ms per loop
1 loops, best of 1: 400 ms per loop
1 loops, best of 1: 69.1 ms per loop
1 loops, best of 1: 59.7 ms per loop
1 loops, best of 1: 110 ms per loop
1 loops, best of 1: 139 ms per loop
1 loops, best of 1: 64.8 ms per loop
1 loops, best of 1: 107 ms per loop
1 loops, best of 1: 113 ms per loop
1 loops, best of 1: 66.9 ms per loop

sage: from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.isogeny_small_degree import isogenies_sporadic_Q
sage: E = EllipticCurve(j=QQ.random_element())
sage: timeit('isogenies_sporadic_Q(E)', globals=globals())
625 loops, best of 3: 1.1 µs per loop
```

What do you think of it?

Previously the function `isogenies_sporadic_Q` checked that l is primes before tesing to see if (l,j) is in the list.  Now we don't.  But I think that this is fair, since by definition there are no sporadic l-isogenies if l is not prime.  So I am moving the (pseudo-)primality test for l into `ell_rational_field` where the failing doctest is.

We have a problem, which I am investigating:

```
sage: K.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)                                                                         
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K,[-2*i-1,0])                                                                   
sage: E.isogenies_prime_degree(17)
...

ValueError: The polynomial does not define a finite subgroup of the elliptic curve.
```
while in fact this curve does have 2 17-isogenies:

```
sage: from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.isogeny_small_degree import isogenies_prime_degree_general
sage: isogenies_prime_degree_general(E,17) # rather slow
[Isogeny of degree 17 from Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (-2*i-1)*x over Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (-82*i-641)*x over Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1,
 Isogeny of degree 17 from Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (-2*i-1)*x over Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (-562*i+319)*x over Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1]

This was found by Warwick undergraduate Warren Moore, and I am looking into it....

This problem can be fixed as follows:  in line 1770 of isogeny_small_degree.py replace -27*c4 by -27*c4/1296 (or -c4/48) twice.  Something similar may be needed on line 1690 (the j=0 endomorphism case).  I will check that out and make a patch.

See #15434 for the extra patch!
