Older versions of `sage-location` (before #13397) do not properly fix GCC, leading to problems with upgrading from sage-5.3 if GCC was installed and Sage was relocated after building GCC but before upgrading. The problem shows up during the build of LinBox from #12883:

Which exact version of Sage did you try?

> Does the wrong path for `dependency_libs` actually matter?

Not sure.  The main point is that this patch makes upgrading work.

> Which exact version of Sage did you try?

I built Sage 5.3 from scratch, moved the build directory, did `./sage -f spkg/standard/ppl-...` and `./sage -f spkg/standard/linbox-...`. No obvious errors. I also tried doing `./sage -upgrade ...`, upgrading from 5.4-rc4. This was all on sage.math.

> Also: with #13452 and #13407, all paths would be fixed at least after the build.


I'm not sure about that. When you upgrade, the old sage-location script is run so sage-current-location.txt is changed but a few paths aren't, so how can those old paths ever be fixed?

If you build sage 5.3, then move the installation, then upgrade, then dependency_libs is not fixed.

In practice, I applied the patches here, #13407, and #13452, to sage-5.4.rc4, built a copy of sage 5.3, moved it, and upgraded it from the patched 5.4.rc4. The path for dependency_libs was not fixed.
