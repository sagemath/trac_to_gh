For block orders you just have to make the blocks smaller. That' not a oneliner, but something like 

```python
blks=R.term_order().blocks()
max_idx = len(blks[0])
if idx < max_idx:
  if nlen > 0:
    new_order = TermOrder(bl, len(bl)-1)
else:
  new_order = bl

for bl in blks[1:]:
  nlen = len(bl)
  max_idx += nlen
  if idx < max_idx:
     if nlen > 0:
       new_order += TermOrder(bl, nlen-1)
  else:
     new_order += bl
 
```
should do.

It the line above do not work out for some case, it would be an acceptable alternative.

I implemented a compromise solution, and for good measure I also adapted it to generic polynomial rings.

AlexanderDreyer, do you like it?

Yeah, that indeed a good comprise: it works out of the box in typical use cases and is not to hard in the remaining cases (where people probably know their way thru). So this is a positive review, if patchbot agrees.
