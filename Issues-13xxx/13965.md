I mimicked what existed in multi_polynomial_ring_generic.pyx, and it ignored the order (my intuition would be that sometimes it must not be possible to carry on the order, when it is a block order for instance).

I think that we could let the user optionally provide an order for the "reduced" ring, and not try to do anything automatically... Do you agree ?

For block orders you just have to make the blocks smaller. That' not a oneliner, but something like 

```python
blks=R.term_order().blocks()
max_idx = len(blks[0])
if idx < max_idx:
  if nlen > 0:
    new_order = TermOrder(bl, len(bl)-1)
else:
  new_order = bl

for bl in blks[1:]:
  nlen = len(bl)
  max_idx += nlen
  if idx < max_idx:
     if nlen > 0:
       new_order += TermOrder(bl, nlen-1)
  else:
     new_order += bl
 
```
should do.

It the line above do not work out for some case, it would be an acceptable alternative.

Yeah, that indeed a good comprise: it works out of the box in typical use cases and is not to hard in the remaining cases (where people probably know their way thru). So this is a positive review, if patchbot agrees.
