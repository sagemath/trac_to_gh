The following is from an email of François Brunault:

I got the following error when trying to compute minimal twists in Sage. Here f is the newform attached to the elliptic curve 256a1, and the minimal twist of f has level 64.

Best,
François

```
sage: f=Newforms(256,names='a')[0]
sage: T=TypeSpace(f,2)
sage: T.is_minimal()
False
sage: T.minimal_twist()
