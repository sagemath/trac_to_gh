<a id='comment:2'></a>* trac_13369-cluster_seed-cs-NEW.patch is an exact copy of trac_13369-cluster_seed-cs.patch, except in quiver.py where the change to lines 97-100 now apply to lines 201-204 instead.  (Also one typo fixed.)

This was done because trac_13369-cluster_seed-cs.patch no longer applies after recent changes to 10538, although it really was only this four line conflict.

* More substantially, trac_13369-cluster-seed-gm.patch fixes compatibility issues with recent changes to 10538 and 10527.  One can now apply all patches in 10527 in order, then all patches in 10538 in order, then the *two patches*

trac_13369-cluster_seed-cs-NEW.patch followed by trac_13369-cluster_seed-gm.patch,

and then the rebuilt sage passes all doc tests and appears to work correctly.

* A more substantial review will be forthcoming.
