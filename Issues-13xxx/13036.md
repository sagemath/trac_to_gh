```
sage: a = pari('0.5 << (2^60+1)')
sage: a
0.E347063955532709825
```
This is incorrectly printed as zero.

The issue is really with printing, as a/2 is printed correctly:

```
sage: a/2
2.92746393008563 E347063955532709820
```

The GP interface works correctly:

```
sage: gp('0.5 << (2^60+1)')
5.8549278601712617670452189594528185681 E347063955532709820
```
