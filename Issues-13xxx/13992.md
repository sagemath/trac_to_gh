Since SCons is too stupid to figure out by itself how to compile Fortran code (#13985), we should set environment variables in `sage-env`, similar to how we do for `CC` and `CXX`.  This is sort-of a follow-up to #13349 (deprecate `SAGE_FORTRAN`).

Just for information:

**Parts of Sage still using `sage_fortran`**:
- atlas (see #10508 which currently doesn't fix this)
- blas (spkg removed by #10508)
- lapack (spkg removed by #10508)
- numpy (see #11334 which currently doesn't fix this)
- scipy (fixed by #13985)
- the `sage-inline-fortran` script (fixed by [attachment:13992_inline_fortran.patch])

**Apply**:
1. [attachment:13992_fortran_env.patch] to `SAGE_ROOT`
2. [attachment:13992_inline_fortran.patch] to `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`
