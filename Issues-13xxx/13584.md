3. When you use `for i in xrange(n)`, you should declare the type of `i`.
4. You can replace `xrange()` by `range()` in such code.
5. More generally, try to declare the types of your variables.
6. (*) When you `cdef` a type, make sure it is correct. In particular `ncols()` is not an `int`!
7. Instead of `matrix.ncols()`, in Cython you can use `matrix._ncols`.
8. About the private methods you add (like `_find_pseudo_peripheral_node`): you should consider making them `cpdef` for speed.

The (*) items must be fixed, the rest are suggestions.

Some more comments:

9. What is the point of having `_adj_list` when we already have `nonzero_positions_in_row`? If you are not happy with the diagonal terms you can either remove them from the output of `nonzero_positions_in_row` or add an optional argument. You can also adapt `_adj` accordingly.

10. The design is very ugly. If you need several methods to achieve a task then create a new class to handle them. It is a nonsense to add 6 private very specific methods (that will furthermore not appear in the documentation). Having an independent class can also be useful to avoid duplication with #13583.

21. The call

  ```
  if self[i,j] != 0:
      ...
   ```
   is very slow compared to

  ```
  if self.get_unsafe(i,j):
      ...
   ```
   The latter avoids a creation of tuple, conversions between C variables and Python variables and a coercion (the `0` in the first version is a Python int).

Hellooooo everybody,

I was not aware of this ticket, and it seems that we work on very similar topics. I implemented this recently, which is the exact (and much slower) version of the problem that the `RCM` tries to solve. 

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/graph_decompositions/bandwidth.html

When you will have decided where exactly the new module will be, can you think of adding a 'seealso' from this heuristic to the graph's 'bandwidth' function, and conversely?

Thaaaaaaaaaaanks,

Nathann
