This is a continuation of #13364, and aims at including more upstream bug fixes, which e.g. fix an
[issue reported on sage-support](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.support/30644), 
which was reported as Maxima bug [2535](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2535), and marked there as closed in post-5.29.1.

Fixes #11894, #13526, #13712, #14209, #14306, #15386 and possibly other Maxima-related bugs.

Ought to fix #13733 (but loading the `abs_integrate` package currently causes this to fail).

Ought to fix #8728 (but Maxima asks for more constraints which follow from the existing ones).

Does not fix #14591, #14677, #15033.

**tarball:** [http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/P.Bruin/sage/maxima-5.33.0.tar.bz2](http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/P.Bruin/sage/maxima-5.33.0.tar.bz2)

Note about the existing `maxima_bug_2526.patch`: â€‹the bug was marked "closed" in the [Maxima bug tracking system](http://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2526/), but the commit somehow disappeared from the Maxima repository and the bug has been reopened.  Hence this patch is still needed to fix it.

while we are at it, it seems strange to me that `sage/interfaces/maxima_abstract.py` contains a doctest for the maxima version used:

```
File "/localdisk/tmp/sage-5.5/devel/sage-12615b/sage/interfaces/maxima_abstract.py", line 422:
    sage: maxima.version()
Expected:
    '5.26.0'
Got:
    '5.29.1'
```
What really matters is the **functionality** provided, not the actual version?
Does Sage check the actual version of each component?

seems that http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/13364/doctests.2.patch
was not installed into the Sage installation you work with.

Sage provides versions at least for some other components, e.g. `gap.version()`

Sometimes it might be useful; AFAIK some optional packages check this.

Also

```
sage -t devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima.py  # Time out
```
due to a timeout of

```
sage: maxima('limit(x^a,x,0)')
```
This is fixable, it is because of a slightly different output format of assumptions.

Jeroen, while it's true that the error is slightly different in format, I don't think this is the problem (or at least not the whole one).  The other things are still passing doctests, and we never even *get* to the 

```
           if i > 0:
                v = self._expect.before
```
branch, as one can verify by inserting print statements.
> This looks problematic:

Thanks to Barton Willis for this workaround.

```
This bug is due to circa January 2013 changes to matrix inversion. A workaround is to set ratmx to true:

Maxima branch_5_30_base_98_g29f9239_dirty http://maxima.sourceforge.net
using Lisp Clozure Common Lisp Version 1.9-r15764  (WindowsX8632)

(%i1) matrixexp(matrix([%i*%pi]));

Unable to find the spectral representation

(%i2) matrixexp(matrix([%i*%pi])), ratmx=true;
(%o2)                                 - 1
```
I've reported this [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2596/).  I don't know if doing this ratmx thing universally is good, though:

```
 if FALSE will cause determinant and matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication to be performed in the representation of the matrix elements and will cause the result of matrix inversion to be left in general representation. If it is TRUE, the 4 operations mentioned above will be performed in CRE form and the result of matrix inverse will be in CRE form. Note that this may cause the elements to be expanded (depending on the setting of RATFAC) which might not always be desired.

The problematic doctest is the following one from `sage/misc/functional.py`:

```
sage: f = exp(-x) * sinh(sqrt(x))
sage: t = integrate(f, x, 0, Infinity)
```
With an unpatched Sage 6.2 this does finish, but takes a very long time (2-3 minutes).  The same situation occurs for

```
sage: maxima('integrate(exp(-x)*sinh(sqrt(x)), x, 0, inf);')
```

This is surprising given that the following takes less than a second in Maxima (both the one that comes with Sage and a standalone copy, and both versions 5.29.1 and 5.33.0):

```
(%i1) integrate(exp(-x)*sinh(sqrt(x)), x, 0, inf); 
(%o1) 
    1/4                                              1
  %e    (2 gamma_incomplete(1, 1) - gamma_incomplete(-, 1) - sqrt(%pi) - 2)
                                                     2
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                      4
                                    1/4                  1
     1/4                          %e    gamma_incomplete(-, 1)
   %e    gamma_incomplete(1, 1)                          2
 + ---------------------------- - ----------------------------
                2                              4
     1/4               1/4
   %e    sqrt(%pi)   %e
 + --------------- - -----
          4            2
```
It would seem to be an interface problem that already exists in some form in Sage 6.2 and manifests itself more relentlessly with the Maxima 5.33.0 spkg I am making.

I am not at all convinced it is the interface problem. It is more likely the Maxima packages loaded by default in Sage library (see the corr. Sage source files) and not loaded in your test run. When I only `load(abs_integrate)` i Sage's 6.2 Maxima, or don't load anything at all, I get an almost instant answer.
When I load the whole bunch from lines 142-4 of `sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py`

```
init_code = ['display2d : false', 'domain : complex', 'keepfloat : true',
            'load(to_poly_solve)', 'load(simplify_sum)',
            'load(abs_integrate)']
```
it goes much slower.

You're right; I tested this inside Maxima (`sage --maxima`), but Sage loads additional packages.  In this case the failure is caused by loading `abs_integrate`.  Using 5.33.0:

```
$ sage --maxima
...
(%i1) display2d: false$

(%i2) integrate(log(cot(x)-1),x,0,%pi/4);

(%o2) (%i*li[2]((%i+1)/2)-%i*li[2](-(%i-1)/2))/2
 -(%i*(2*li[2](%i+1)-2*li[2](1-%i))+%pi*log(2))/4
(%i3) load(abs_integrate)$

(%i4) integrate(log(cot(x)-1),x,0,%pi/4);

log: encountered log(0).
log: encountered log(0).
log: encountered log(0).
log: encountered log(0).
log: encountered log(0).
log: encountered log(0).
log: encountered log(0).
log: encountered log(0).
log: encountered log(0).
PSLOG: internal error.
 -- an error. To debug this try: debugmode(true);
```
