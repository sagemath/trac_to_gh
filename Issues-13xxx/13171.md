```
The following cannot be evaluated in Sage

```
sage: var('k N')
(k, N)
sage: (sum(1/sqrt(k),k,1,N) - 2*sqrt(N)).limit(N=oo)
limit(-2*sqrt(N) + sum(1/sqrt(k), k, 1, N), N, +Infinity)
```
But Mathematica can

```
In[1]:= Limit[Sum[1/Sqrt[k], {k, 1, N}] - 2 Sqrt[N], N -> \[Infinity]]

             1
Out[1]= Zeta[-]
             2
```

Component: **symbolics**

Keywords: **limit expression sum zeta mathematica**

Is this only a problem in the way we convert `sum()` to maxima? Otherwise, this ticket should be put in the `sage-wishlist` milestone.
