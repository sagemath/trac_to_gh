```
Fix vector normalization so that it agrees with the standard definition of normalizing a vector. Right now it divides the entries of the vector by the first nonzero entry of the vector. For instance:

`sage: v = vector([1,2,3])`

`sage: v.normalize()`

`(1, 2, 3)`

Shouldn't the default implementation be the Euclidean norm? Especially since v.norm() returns the Euclidean norm.

What if your base ring/field does not have any square roots?

```
sage: v = vector([1,2,3])
sage: n = v.norm()
sage: n
sqrt(14)
sage: u = (1/n)*v
sage: u.base_ring()
Symbolic Ring
```

We start with a free module element (integer entries) and then we end up in the Symbolic Ring (which is often hard to get out of).

Over RDF/CDF I'd agree entirely.  For **exact** linear algebra, I'm not convinced.

If you think of vectors as specifying directions, then normalization gives you a "random but fixed" vector pointing in the same direction as the original. If you store a lot of directions, then comparing normalized vectors is quicker than using dot-products.
