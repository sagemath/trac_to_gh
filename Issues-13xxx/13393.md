```
Fix vector normalization so that it agrees with the standard definition of normalizing a vector. Right now it divides the entries of the vector by the first nonzero entry of the vector. For instance:

`sage: v = vector([1,2,3])`

`sage: v.normalize()`

`(1, 2, 3)`

Shouldn't the default implementation be the Euclidean norm? Especially since v.norm() returns the Euclidean norm.

What if your base ring/field does not have any square roots?

```
sage: v = vector([1,2,3])
sage: n = v.norm()
sage: n
sqrt(14)
sage: u = (1/n)*v
sage: u.base_ring()
Symbolic Ring
```

We start with a free module element (integer entries) and then we end up in the Symbolic Ring (which is often hard to get out of).

Over RDF/CDF I'd agree entirely.  For **exact** linear algebra, I'm not convinced.

If you think of vectors as specifying directions, then normalization gives you a "random but fixed" vector pointing in the same direction as the original. If you store a lot of directions, then comparing normalized vectors is quicker than using dot-products.

If you want to go that route, I could argue, what if your ring doesn't have division...

I'm sure you have a good point, and I'm not as Sage savvy as most users here, but from my perspective someone who is trying to use Sage for basic functionality (like an undergrad trying to do homework) will be really confused and frustrated if v.normalize() does not return a normalized vector.
