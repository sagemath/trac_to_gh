Is there a functional reason why comparing domains of functions we can't wrap them as sets before comparing them?  A domain and codomain of a map are sets and ultimately should be compared as such when order doesn't matter.

Please advise.

I believe this would be better asked on sage-devel since it is a question rather than a bug or feature request.

Nevertheless, the biggest problem as I see it is how do you compare infinite enumerated sets, much less uncountable ones.
