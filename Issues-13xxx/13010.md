Right now it says:

```
          * APPLE OS X:
              (a) create a file called math (in your PATH):
                  #!/bin/sh
                  /Applications/Mathematica\ 5.2.app/Contents/MacOS/MathKernel $@

              Note that the 5.2 part will depend on the version of
              Mathematica you have, and the above path could be different
              if you installed mathematica elsewhere.
```

For a while now, Mathematica ships their OS X app as "Mathematica.app", i.e., without the version number, which means the above message can be significantly simplified.
