Assuming you're referring to [the instructions below this point](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sagenb/notebook/notebook_object.html#sagenb.notebook.notebook_object.NotebookObject), you have to actually give the `dir` a name!

```
sage: load_notebook?
Definition:     load_notebook(dir, interface=None, port=None, secure=None, user_manager=None)
Docstring:
       Load and return a notebook from a given directory.  Create a new
       one in that directory, if one isn't already there.
    
       INPUT:
    
       * "dir" - a string that defines a directory name
    
```
I'm not sure this is really a bug, though perhaps a little change in documentation wouldn't hurt.

I see what was going on here now.  The [phrasing here](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/blob/master/sagenb/notebook/notebook_object.py#L66) could make it clear that `dir` doesn't work.

I've opened [this sagenb pull request](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/166).
