```
sage: load_notebook?
Definition:     load_notebook(dir, interface=None, port=None, secure=None, user_manager=None)
Docstring:
       Load and return a notebook from a given directory.  Create a new
       one in that directory, if one isn't already there.
    
       INPUT:
    
       * "dir" - a string that defines a directory name
    
```
I'm not sure this is really a bug, though perhaps a little change in documentation wouldn't hurt.
