#13579 changed `SAGE_TMP`. There are some places with less-than-ideal handling of `SAGE_TMP` that are broken in the process.

* `sage-cleaner` hardcodes '.../temp/...' but thats not correct any more.
* Many doctests use SAGE_TMP+'foo.bar'. The new SAGE_TMP doesn't end in a backslash any more. Using `os.path.join` would have saved the day.

Follow-up: #13147

Apply 
* [attachment: 13681_scripts.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13681/13681_scripts.patch.gz) to the `SAGE_ROOT/local/bin` repo
* [attachment: 13681_sagelib.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13681/13681_sagelib.patch.gz) to the Sage library

One advantage would have been so #13147 wouldn't need rebasing, and it also solved some of the same issues. But now I guess it will need rebasing anyway.

Doctesting still litters files around than don't get deleted because `SAGE_TESTDIR` is not a the expected `DOT_SAGE/tmp/hostname/pid/...`. I'll attach a patch to fix this.
