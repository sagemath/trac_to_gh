#13579 changed `SAGE_TMP`. There are some places with less-than-ideal handling of `SAGE_TMP` that are broken in the process.

* `sage-cleaner` hardcodes '.../temp/...' but thats not correct any more.
* Many doctests use SAGE_TMP+'foo.bar'. The new SAGE_TMP doesn't end in a backslash any more. Using `os.path.join` would have saved the day.

Follow-up: #13147

Apply 
* [attachment:13681_scripts.patch] to the `SAGE_ROOT/local/bin` repo
* [attachment:13681_sagelib.patch] to the Sage library

One advantage would have been so #13147 wouldn't need rebasing, and it also solved some of the same issues. But now I guess it will need rebasing anyway.

Is this a regression due to #13579?  If it's not, I prefer to leave this change for a different ticket.
