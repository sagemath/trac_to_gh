The recent changes to the geometry/polyhedra module broke support for the lrs_volume() method of the Polyhedron class.  This is not tested usually because it relies on the lrs optional package.  The fix is very simple, just a couple of imports needed to be added.

While we are at it, implement the native volume computation whose bits and pieces (triangulation and volume of simplices) have been around for a while but haven't been hooked up.
