The recent changes to the geometry/polyhedra module broke support for the lrs_volume() method of the Polyhedron class.  This is not tested usually because it relies on the lrs optional package.  The fix is very simple, just a couple of imports needed to be added.

While we are at it, implement the native volume computation whose bits and pieces (triangulation and volume of simplices) have been around for a while but haven't been hooked up.

We came across this exact issue today when exploring the polyhedra functionality in Sage at Sage Days 45. And we came up with the same fix, except that we put the import statements directly in the `lrs_volume` method.
