This patch fixes a bug in the cyclic sieving phenomenon.

Without the patch applied, we have

```
sage: from sage.combinat.cyclic_sieving_phenomenon import CyclicSievingPolynomial
sage: S42 = [ Set(S) for S in subsets([1,2,3,4]) if len(S) == 2 ]; S42
sage: cyc_act = lambda S: Set( i.mod(4)+1 for i in S)
sage: CyclicSievingPolynomial( S42, cyc_act, order=8, get_order=True )
[q^6 + 2*q^4 + q^2 + 2, 4]
```

while with the patch applied, you get

```
sage: CyclicSievingPolynomial( S42, cyc_act, order=8, get_order=True )
[q^6 + 2*q^4 + q^2 + 2, 8]
```
