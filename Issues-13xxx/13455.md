It does hurt - try `type(1)` in typeset mode or just a string like `1<2`. With the patch they work great for me.

With the patch, `type(1)` looks good. `html("1<b>2</b>")` shows "2" in boldface, while `html("$1<b>2</b>$")` prints a string of inequalities in math mode. All tests passed. I think this patch is good.
