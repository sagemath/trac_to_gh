In #11498 I replaced </> with lt/gt in verbatim strings that were displayed by jsMath. The reason was that it worked and otherwise it didn't. With a switch to MathJax there is no need it in as it correctly renders all verbatims and does not turn lt/gt back into </>.

Hmmm...it probably wouldn't hurt to have it in there anyway.  If this is passed as html: `\begin{verbatim} a<b>c\end{verbatim}`, then mathjax won't ever see the <b> since the browser will interpret that as html.  So it might make sense to go ahead and escape it anyway so that the browser doesn't interpret it before mathjax ever sees it.
