As reported by Fredrik Johansson in #12173 this is a horrible horror:

```
sage: a = ZZ['x'](range(100000))
sage: R = Integers(3)['x']
sage: %time R(a);
CPU times: user 39.38 s, sys: 28.55 s, total: 67.93 s
Wall time: 71.19 s
```

Pruning the command shows the whole time is spent calling `R._element_constructor_(a)` so we should take a look on how that function works to see what's going on.

As a point of comparison, if we convert the polynomial back into a list then the operation runs about 500x faster:

```
sage: %time R(list(a));
CPU times: user 0.12 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.14 s
Wall time: 0.14 s
```
So we probably have a 'lost in coercion' situation here.

The main problem is in compiled files (which is why `%prun` doesn't see it). In particular `polynomial_modz_flint.pyx` `_element_constructor_` calls `Polynomial_template`'s `__init__()` which converts `a` into a list of coefficients, which then reconstructs the polynomial by adding individual monomials together.

Where the time is taken is each time a monomial is added, a new polynomial is created. A partial solution is to convert polynomial inputs in `_element_consturctor_` to a list and do that (this runs fast because it just does the coefficient coercion and sets the coefficient list of the new polynomial). I haven't looked too deeply into a general solution yet (I don't quite know if this is the only case where this slowdown occurs), but I would suspect one exists.

Well, I should say that's where it used to be...it's now in `polynomial_ring.py`.

Something even more scary to me, this did not scale linearly with `n`:

```
sage: a = ZZ['x'](range(30000)) 
sage: R = Integers(3)['x']
sage: %time L = R(a)
CPU times: user 4.48 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 4.52 s
Wall time: 4.61 s
sage: a = ZZ['x'](range(60000))
sage: %time L = R(a)
CPU times: user 17.84 s, sys: 0.09 s, total: 17.93 s
Wall time: 18.22 s
```

However I'm uploading a patch which just checks if it is a polynomial, and if so, it handles it as if it were a list. With the patch:

```
sage: a = ZZ['x'](range(1000000)) # Note the number of 0's
sage: R = Integers(3)['x']
sage: %time L = R(a)
CPU times: user 2.00 s, sys: 0.19 s, total: 2.18 s
Wall time: 2.55 s
```

To be honest, I'm still not perfectly happy with this solution since feels like a hack. If someone else can find an example of a significant slowdown which is not caught by this patch, please share. However as it stands, this patch is ready for review.

Best

Travis

Yes it does:

y^2
```

I'll see what I can do.

Attachment: **[trac_13257-modn_conversion_speedup-ts.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13257/trac_13257-modn_conversion_speedup-ts.patch.gz)**

I've changed the fix to have `Polynomial_template` just convert the input polynomial into a list of coefficients and then pass that list back as a corresponding call the the *original* class's `__init__()` (rather than back to `Polynomial_template`) to take advantage of the specific implementations. This doesn't work quite as well for `GF2`, but that was significantly faster before anyways.

My timings with the patch:

```
sage: a = ZZ['x'](range(100000))
sage: R = Integers(3)['x']
sage: %time L = R(a)
CPU times: user 0.22 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 0.26 s
Wall time: 0.35 s
sage: type(L)
sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_zmod_flint.Polynomial_zmod_flint

sage: S = GF(3)['x']
sage: %time L = S(a)
CPU times: user 0.22 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.22 s
Wall time: 0.26 s
sage: type(L)
sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_zmod_flint.Polynomial_zmod_flint

sage: T = GF(2)['x'] % different because it uses NTL
CPU times: user 1.40 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 1.40 s
Wall time: 1.50 s
sage: %time L = T(list(a))
CPU times: user 1.06 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 1.06 s
Wall time: 1.16 s
sage: type(L)
sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_gf2x.Polynomial_GF2X
```

Ready for review again.

Thanks,

Travis

I think the horrible horror has been fixed in #12173 itself.
At least it takes 0 sec on my computer to perform this (except for Integers(2) where it is slightly solwer, 0.41 sec, surely because NTL is slow :)).

So I propose to close this as duplicate.
