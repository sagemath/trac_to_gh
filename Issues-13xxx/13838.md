The current implementation of `KleberTree` is only valid for the simply laced types. This ticket will implement the virtual Kleber algorithm and thus expand `KleberTree` to generate rigged configurations for all affine types.

It is fine to inherit from KleberTree, but the construction is mathematically inherently different. For example for type `C_n^{(1)}` the construction is via the `A_{2n-1}^{(1)}` Kleber tree and type A weights, rather than type C weights.

Hey Anne,

Here's the new version with the changes we've discussed (via e-mail/in person) along with a method `latex_options()` for controlling the latex output. I also think it's okay for the virtual Kleber tree to accept simply-laced types as input and for them to not compare as equal (since they are different mathematical constructions because we consider it as a folded type). I've documented this behavior.

Thank you for doing the review,
