    "body": "<a id='comment:12'></a>\nHi Travis,\n\nIt would be good if you could implement the tensor product multiplicity (and please call it tensor_product_multiplicity) which is formula (3.2) of http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9809087.pdf in order to check that the code is giving the correct output. For nonsimply-laced types it would be the virtual analogue of this formula. The Kleber tree gives the admissible partitions, but to get the multiplicity one needs to sum over the product of binomial coefficients.\n\nAlso, I think it would be better to access the VirtualKleberTree through its own class (rather than through KleberTree). It is fine to inherit from KleberTree, but the construction is mathematically inherently different. For example for type `C_n^{(1)}` the construction is via the `A_{2n-1}^{(1)}` Kleber tree and type A weights, rather than type C weights. Since this is mostly just used in later code on rigged configuration, I think it won't be necessary to export VirtualKleberTree into the namespace.\n\nThanks for your work on this!\n\nAnne",

Hey Anne,

I've documented this behavior.

Thank you for doing the review,
