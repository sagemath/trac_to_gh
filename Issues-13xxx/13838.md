The Kleber tree gives the admissible partitions, but to get the multiplicity one needs to sum over the product of binomial coefficients.\n\nAlso, I think it would be better to access the VirtualKleberTree through its own class (rather than through KleberTree). It is fine to inherit from KleberTree, but the construction is mathematically inherently different. For example for type `C_n^{(1)}` the construction is via the `A_{2n-1}^{(1)}` Kleber tree and type A weights, rather than type C weights.

Hey Anne,

Here's the new version with the changes we've discussed (via e-mail/in person) along with a method `latex_options()` for controlling the latex output. I also think it's okay for the virtual Kleber tree to accept simply-laced types as input and for them to not compare as equal (since they are different mathematical constructions because we consider it as a folded type). I've documented this behavior.

Thank you for doing the review,

If you want to allow for simply-laced input in the VirtualKleberTree, don't you want to select all nodes and bracket them in the output?
