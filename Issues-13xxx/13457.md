The last two changes are actually crucial: you need a `cd "$SAGE_ROOT"` before line 75 because otherwise, the working directory is wrong and the `if [ -d devel/sagenb ]` block doesn't execute.

I'll try to keep looking at this.

Attachment [13457_sage_bdist.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket13457/13457_sage_bdist.patch) by @jdemeyer created at 2012-09-16 17:40:40

I haven't looked at the OpenSolaris issues, but in any case it's not a regression of this ticket.

Agree on removing the `tar v` flag, new patch needs review.
