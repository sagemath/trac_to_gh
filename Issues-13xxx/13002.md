This has been causing lots of errors lately:

```
sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/interfaces/expect.py
**********************************************************************
File "/padic/scratch/jdemeyer/merger/sage-5.1.beta1/devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/expect.py", line 832:
    sage: singular.interrupt(timeout=3)  # sometimes very slow (up to 60s on sage.math, 2012)
Expected:
    False
Got:
    True
**********************************************************************
```

When it succeeds, it often takes a very long time (I've even seen 1000s on sage.math).
