Hi, This ticket is about entering a deprecation in `finite_class.py` to no longer use it and instead use `FiniteEnumeratedSets`.

`finite_class.py` (`FiniteCombinatorialClass`) is derived from `CombinatorialClass`, which has the comment:

```
   946     """
   947     This class is deprecated, and will disappear as soon as all derived
   948     classes in Sage's library will have been fixed. Please derive
   949     directly from Parent and use the category :class:`EnumeratedSets`,
   950     :class:`FiniteEnumeratedSets`, or :class:`InfiniteEnumeratedSets`, as
   951     appropriate.
```
We go a step further in and fully deprecate `finite_class.py` and redirects them to use/develop `FiniteEnumeratedSets` instead.

    947     This class is deprecated, and will disappear as soon as all derived
    948     classes in Sage's library will have been fixed. Please derive
    949     directly from Parent and use the category :class:`EnumeratedSets`,
    950     :class:`FiniteEnumeratedSets`, or :class:`InfiniteEnumeratedSets`, as
    951     appropriate.
-
-We should have a similar type of comment under finite_class.py which directs them to use/develop FiniteEnumeratedSets instead........  
+```
+We go a step further in and fully deprecate `finite_class.py` and redirects them to use/develop `FiniteEnumeratedSets` instead.
