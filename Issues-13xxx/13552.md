Hi, This ticket is about entering a deprecation in `finite_class.py` to no longer use it and instead use `FiniteEnumeratedSets`.

`finite_class.py` (`FiniteCombinatorialClass`) is derived from `CombinatorialClass`, which has the comment:

```
   946     """
   947     This class is deprecated, and will disappear as soon as all derived
   948     classes in Sage's library will have been fixed. Please derive
   949     directly from Parent and use the category :class:`EnumeratedSets`,
   950     :class:`FiniteEnumeratedSets`, or :class:`InfiniteEnumeratedSets`, as
   951     appropriate.
```
We go a step further in and fully deprecate `finite_class.py` and redirects them to use/develop `FiniteEnumeratedSets` instead.

Ouch, I did not intend to change the owner to "was"! Not sure how to fix it now; I seem to be unable to remodify. Anyway, I only hope I have not done any harm.
