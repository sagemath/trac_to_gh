On Cygwin, PARI produces not only a shared library dll file but also an import dll.a file.
Nonetheless, the dll.a is not copied by the install targets of the Makefile.

And having it would ensure that other shared libraries linked with -lpari would link to libpari.dll rather than libpari.a (and some as eclib won't work with libpari.a anyway, see #13325), because ld looks in order for dll.a, then a, then dll.

This has been included upstream, see git rev 2c34d58be7f844581733e7c2b96f2a60ee3eb82a and ffd02415dde8a48f7c06765635b0457b23ba60e8

No return from upstream yet (which means some weeks now).
If someone thinks the changes made here are logical, let's use the spkg at
http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/sage/pari-2.5.2.p1.spkg
in Sage.
At least they make sure that the shared version of Pari is found before the static one when linking (and so surely fix broken pieces of Sage) by only copying a file produced by Pari itself (the only drawback might be that linking should be a little slower, but Cygwin is already slow as hell and I did not notice any difference).

In the PARI spkg, patches are supposed to be documented in `patches/README.txt`.  Also, I prefer a more descriptive name for the patch file than "Makefile.SH.patch".

I made those fixes in #13534.  You could either make those changes here, or wait for #13534 (then this gets closed as duplicate).
