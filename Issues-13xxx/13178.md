See [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-support/h_JO1Jgx9a4).

Basically, 

```
str1 = r"""

for n in [1..10] do
   for m in [1..10] do
      Print(m*n);
      Print(" - ");
   od;
od;
"""
gap.eval(str1)
```
erroneously adds newlines, while

```
str = r"""
for n in [1..10] do
   for m in [1..10] do
      Print(m*n);
      Print(" - ");
    od;
   Print("\n");
od;
"""
gap.eval(str)
```
doesn't return anything at all (well, the empty string).

```
gap.eval(str,newlines=False)
```
doesn't help, though it seems like there must be something going on related to it, given the first command.

This makes (for instance) a lot of stuff not work in the notebook with %gap.

There are two ways that sage sends data to GAP.  The first is to send it line by line, and the second is to send it via a file.  This last is used when there is a lot of data because, IIRC, it's faster.  However, this messes up the use of stdout e.g. Print.  So what's happening is if the input is long enough, it goes to a file.  That's why removing some of the prints makes a difference.  You can also get the same effect by adding a bunch of spaces in the middle (they are stripped from the beginning and the end).

One way around this is to use 

```
gap.eval(...., allow_use_file=False)
```
which allows you to see that this is in fact the cause of the problem.  The second method is to change the cutoff (default is 100)

```
gap._eval_using_file_cutoff = 1000
```
or disable it entirely

```
self._eval_using_file_cutoff = None
```

You can set it in `~/.sage/init.sage` to make it "permanent".  

As for a truly permanent solution, we could try disabling it if we see a function that prints to stdout like Print or Display, but it wouldn't work for custom functions.  I don't think there is a way around this based on how GAP is currently written (except not using a file), but I could be wrong.

Hmm, I don't know that one would want to completely disable it, but at least MUCH better documentation on exactly when to expect this problem - and how to work around it, like your suggestions - would be really helpful to close this ticket.

Also, how horrible would it be to expand the cutoff to something higher in general?
