Sage currently doesn't defined the variable 'x' when using `sage -c`:

```
$ sage -c "print x"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/sage-5.4.rc1/local/bin/sage-eval", line 13, in <module>
    eval(compile(s,'<cmdline>','exec'))
  File "<cmdline>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```
We should fix this.

Apply [attachment:trac_13598-x.patch] to the scripts repository.

The line

from sage.calculus.predefined import x
```
is present in both all_cmdline.py and all_notebook.py, so it is executed during any normal Sage session.
