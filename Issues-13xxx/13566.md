Since each of the examples are unique, there should only be one (immutable) instance of each. In other words, we do not recreate the example each time it is called. For example

```
sage: S1 = simplicial_complexes.KleinBottle()
sage: S2 = simplicial_complexes.KleinBottle()
sage: S1 == S2
True
sage: S1 is S2
False
```
where the last should return `true`. Possibly do this by something like

```
def KlienBottle(self):
    if not hasattr(self, "_klien_bottle_output"):
        self._klien_bottle_output = SimplicialComplex(facets)
    return self._klien_bottle_output
```
This is an expansion on the concept in #13244 and the dependency on #12587 is in making simplicial complexes immutable.

A simpler solution would be to turn the constructors in the `SimplicialComplexExamples` class into `@cached_methods`. I'm attaching this as a patch.

Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.

Why is this caching desirable? As far as I can see, this creates a memory leak:

```
i=1
while true:
   simplicial_complexes.Sphere(i)
   i=i+1
```
fails much sooner than it should because all the now useless previous examples are still nailed in memory. 

You aren't proposing the cache to save computation time, I suppose? It's probably because you find it desirable to guarantee uniqueness when these things exist (are they parents?) In that case, you can get what you want by inheriting from UniqueRepresentation or UniqueFactory. That keeps a weak cache, so that

If I understand #13115/the thread correctly, a way to do this would be:

- have an `import homology/examples as simplical_complexes` in the `all.py`
- Make each of these methods into a subclass of `SimplicialComplex` and `UniqueRepresentation` and have these be at the module level

since right now `SimplicialComplex` is mutable until specified otherwise. (I guess with this we can also do some optimization with certain methods, such as homology for `Sphere`... and that should be a different ticket.)

(I guess with this we can also do some optimization with certain methods, such as homology for `Sphere`... and that should be a different ticket.)\n\n\nYes, that sounds looks like a sensible approach. Additionally, if that seems like a heavy-weight solution (it does to me), one should probably see if uniqueness is so important that it warrants a subclass and/or if there are other pressing reasons to make these subclasses. Reasons against uniqueness:\n\n- `SimplicialComplex` is not a parent so there's no sage-technical reason to enforce uniqueness (that's just a reason *not for* uniqueness)\n\n- While any two `Sphere(3)` complexes are isomorphic, they are not canonically so, so mathematically there can be good reasons to have multiple non-identical spheres in memory.\n\n- It makes things like `Sphere` behave different from `SimplicialComplex` (and more generally not simply *be* a `SimplicialComplex`. That makes code harder to maintain because now you have similar-but-subtly-different acting objects. You should only do that if there's a benefit elsewhere.\n\nShould uniqueness of `SimplicialComplexes` be desirable in general (why? are they meant to become parents?) then it should perhaps be fixed on that level. Mutable obviously can't be forced to be unique, so then you should probably make two: `SimplicialComplex` and `MutableSimplicialComplex` (one a subclass of the other if at all possible), where you can make the immutable one unique by also inheriting from UniqueRepresentation.

Yes, that sounds looks like a sensible approach. Additionally, if that seems like a heavy-weight solution (it does to me), one should probably see if uniqueness is so important that it warrants a subclass and/or if there are other pressing reasons to make these subclasses. Reasons against uniqueness:

- `SimplicialComplex` is not a parent so there's no sage-technical reason to enforce uniqueness (that's just a reason *not for* uniqueness)

- While any two `Sphere(3)` complexes are isomorphic, they are not canonically so, so mathematically there can be good reasons to have multiple non-identical spheres in memory.

- It makes things like `Sphere` behave different from `SimplicialComplex` (and more generally not simply *be* a `SimplicialComplex`. That makes code harder to maintain because now you have similar-but-subtly-different acting objects. You should only do that if there's a benefit elsewhere.

Should uniqueness of `SimplicialComplexes` be desirable in general (why? are they meant to become parents?) then it should perhaps be fixed on that level. Mutable obviously can't be forced to be unique, so then you should probably make two: `SimplicialComplex` and `MutableSimplicialComplex` (one a subclass of the other if at all possible), where you can make the immutable one unique by also inheriting from UniqueRepresentation. Going to the immutable one then of course should return an immutable *copy*, not just change a flag.

Alternatively, (I don't know if that would be too hackish) you could add another flag, `canonical_instance=true/false` (only to be used with `is_mutable=False`), or make (a renamed version of) `is_mutable` tristate, to determines whether a cache is involved. That would have the severe drawback you'd have to break open the caching mechanism used in `UniqueRepresentation`.

If you find there's no need for `Sphere` etc. to be anything more than just a `SimplicialComplex` the implementation becomes *really* easy: `sage.homology.examples.Sphere` can simple be a function, returning the relevant `SimplicialComplex`.

That is a good point since I believe not all triangulations of a (high enough dimensional) sphere can be obtained by bistellar flips.

Also a good point.

If it is decided to essentially do nothing, perhaps we should use this ticket to move everything down to a function.

Also it seems like this needs to be rebased to 5.6.beta1.

Of course, in a `UniqueFactory` one would usually ask for a Klein bottle by `simplicial_complexes("KleinBottle")`. But of course one could still define methods `KleinBottle` and so on, so that `simplicial_complexes.KleinBottle()` is equivalent to `simplicial_complexes("KleinBottle")`.

The latter could be automatised by a `__getattr__` method:

```
    def __getattr__(self, s):
        return lambda : self(s)
```

Why would that solve the problem with permanent caching? Well, `UniqueFactory` will soon be using weak dictionaries for caching (in fact it already uses weak references, but improperly, and that's supposed to be fixed in #12215).

My belief is still yes and so I'd support going to a `UniqueFactory`, however this is at odds with what the graph code does:

```
sage: g = graphs.StarGraph(5)
sage: g
Star graph: Graph on 6 vertices
sage: g.add_vertex(10)
sage: g

```
Since the graph is given a special name, I'd rather that be immutable. (If we do keep them immutable, we probably should give each of our simplicial complex examples special names too...)

Anyways, what are everyone else's thoughts?

For example

```
sage: S = simplicial_complexes.Sphere(4)
sage: S.is_mutable()
False
sage: T = SimplicialComplex(S, is_mutable=True) # This should work and is a bug I didn't catch
sage: T.is_mutable()
False
sage: T = SimplicialComplex(S) # This one I'm happy with leaving immutable
sage: T.is_mutable()
False
```
However I do think we should also have a method to make a mutable copy, my suggestions are either `copy()` and/or `make_mutable()`.

Agreed. This was something I introduced, so I'll be happy to fix it.

This is very strange to me as well. Part of the thing is the identity matrix function is cached, so it must return an immutable object.

Here is a branch which makes two more examples of simplicial complexes immutable, and then converts all of the examples from methods to functions. They are not cached (and I think that was the consensus).

As Travis said above:

> If it is decided to essentially do nothing, perhaps we should use this ticket to move everything down to a function.


I guess that's what I've done.
