Okay I see where the problem is. SubgraphSearch assumes the graph always has at least two vertices! I'll post a patch soon.

I agree with your patch of course! I am not sure how to make a commit message though! Could you make it or perhaps explain it to me how to do it?

Helloooooooooooooo !!

I just asked one of my colleagues (who uses mercurual queue too, so he wasn't so sure) and he told me to give "hg rollback" a try.
