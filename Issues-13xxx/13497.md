Here's another option: instead of disabling the test, sage-bdist can store the info in the placeholder spkg file, and sage-spkg can read it from there. See the attached patches. In sage-bdist, we could instead use `sage -i --info ...` instead of the code stolen from sage-spkg.

This isn't very well tested, but it's an idea.

Maybe better would be to create an *actual* spkg but only put `SPKG.txt` in it...

But my feeling is that we're overdoing things.  I would still simply disable the test.
