In Sage 5.3, the function prime_powers behaves a little strange:

sage: prime_powers(4,10)
[4, 5, 7, 8, 9]
# As expected

sage: prime_powers(5,10)
[7, 8, 9]
# 5 isn't a prime power anymore???

# And now things become even worse:
sage: prime_powers(7,10)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

Yeah, this seems problematic.  The code in question is *old*, too, so perhaps there is a more efficient way to do it in the meantime...

I would prefer to leave 1 as a prime power because it is listed in Sloane's tables as a prime power:  http://oeis.org/A000961

There he says "Since 1 = p^0 does not have a well defined prime base p, it is sometimes not regarded as a prime power.", which might be where your misgivings come from. 

If by  "prime power" one thinks of "power of a prime", the only question is in what set are we considering the prime powers.  If we take the natural numbers, then the number 1 is definitely a power of a prime.    

If by "prime power" one thinks "power of a specific canonical prime", then 1 is not such a thing.  

In this case, the best thing to do is stick with what is there (to avoid introducing bugs in other people's code!) and clearly document/define what a prime power is in Sage.

The comment on line 708 in `sage/rings/arith.py` needs to be fixed, too - it talks about primes rather than prime powers.

I also think that the following:

```
       sage: prime_powers(10,7) 
 	761	        Traceback (most recent call last): 
 	762	        ... 
 	763	        ValueError: the first input must be less than the second input, however, 10 > 7 
```
i.e. the corresponding implementation logic is not right, in the sense that it should just return empty lists rather than throwing exceptions.  And negative `start`  should be allowed too (cf. the semantics of `range()`).

Then, in the following fragment

```
 	783	    output = prime_range(start,stop) 
 	784	    if start == 1: 
 	785	        output.append(1) 
 	786	     
 	787	    s = stop.sqrt() 
 	788	    for p in prime_range(stop): 
```
`prime_range()`, which is not cheap, is basically called two times instead of one.
One can do with one call to `prime_range(stop)` just fine.

You always should coerce `stop` into Integer. Indeed, currently one gets:

```
sage: prime_powers(1,int(9))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.4.rc0/devel/sage-main/<ipython console> in <module>()

/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.4.rc0/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/arith.pyc in prime_powers(start, stop)
    761     from sage.rings.integer import is_Integer
    762     if not (is_Integer(start) and (is_Integer(stop) or stop == None)):
--> 763         raise TypeError, "both inputs must be integers, but your inputs were %s and %s"%(start,stop)
    764 
    765     # deal with the case in which only one input is given

TypeError: both inputs must be integers, but your inputs were 1 and 9
```
This is because taking `sqrt(int(9))` does not work too well in Sage...

Second issue: the comment `    # check that all inputs are positive integers` on line 760 is misleading!

Dimpase,

I'm not sure if I understand what you're suggesting I do. Should I replace the check that the inputs are Integers with a coercion of the inputs into Integers? Once I coerce the elements the check is redundant, as either it raises an error in and of itself (say, if it was passed a string it will raise a TypeError), or will fix the problem.

I think there is a bug in the code, coming from the fact that

```
sage: Integer(None)==None
False
```
You also should have test cases (doctests) for all the different combinations of start/stop, and test them, too. You know that you can run Sage so that it tests doctests in a particular file, right?
E.g. the bug above would have been caught by the proper doctest.
Also, for some reason you removed the test `sage: v = prime_powers(10)`, but it was there for good reason.

 Yeah, this seems problematic.  The code in question is *old*, too, so perhaps there is a more efficient way to do it in the meantime...

Nice work.  Below, things almost certainly not worth addressing now that ppurka and khalasz have worked so hard to get this in, but I'll still point them out if ppurka is really bored and wants to fix them:
* Typo

```
# inserted to prevent an error from occuring
```
* Might be worth using Python 3 string formatting in the error messages
* Conceivable to replace the reference to #922 with a nice new `:trac:` thingie

Ah, I knew I shouldn't have asked about this, because now of course I have to keep following up... you can't do 

```
sage: type(v[0])      # :trac:`922` 
```
and have it formatted, because it's in a literal block, it would have to be

```
TESTS:

Check :trac:`922`is fixed::

    sage: v = prime_powers(10)
    sage: type(v[0])
    <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```
or something like that.  But I don't know if that's worth it...
