The following seems to occur only on OS X systems.  When building R in parallel, sometimes the following can happen:

```
[...]
mkdir /Users/jdemeyer/sage-5.3.rc0/local/lib/R/bin
mkdir /Users/jdemeyer/sage-5.3.rc0/local/lib/R/include
mkdir: /Users/jdemeyer/sage-5.3.rc0/local/lib/R/include: File exists
make[2]: *** [installdirs] Error 1
make[1]: *** [install] Error 1
make: *** [install] Error 1
Error installing R.
```
The problem is that `libintl.h` has been copied to the **file** `/Users/jdemeyer/sage-5.3.rc0/local/lib/R/include`.
