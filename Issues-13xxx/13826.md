The patchbot is on a separate harddisk, mounted under /mnt/storage2TB. But my temp directory is tmpfs. So the pickle is moved across block devices, which is of course not atomic. Hence the patchbot sometimes dies here while opening a half-written file. The temporary file should be created in the target directory, only then can we be sure that the move is atomic.

While we're nitpicking on possible race conditions anyway, isn't this unsafe?

```
    if star_imports is None:
        cache_file = get_cache_file()
        if os.path.exists(cache_file):
            star_imports = pickle.load(open(cache_file))
        else:
            star_imports = {}

``` 
The file could get deleted between the existence check and the open. Shouldn't one do

```
    if star_imports is None:
        cache_file = get_cache_file()
        try:
            opened_cache_file=open(cache_file)
        except IOError, <whatever other errors should be caught>:
            opened_cache_file=None
        if opened_cache_file:
            star_imports = pickle.load(opened_cache_file)
            opened_cache_file.close()
        else:
            star_imports = {}
```
This is of course assuming that either the cachefile is valid or does not exist. A "mv" on the filename shouldn't affect an already opened file.

I've added a warning if the pickle is corrupted and converted `sage.sandpiles` to lazily import so we actually have something to test. Though neither of these changes is anywhere near as important as fixing the race condition.

Looks good to me (mostly). Few small issues:
- whitespace plugin complains about introduced whitespace
- the code writing the cache file first deletes the cachefile, writes the new one in a temporary file, and then moves it in place. Why not leave the old cache file in place while the new one gets written?
I'm setting review to positive anyway.

So? Go ahead and design a workflow that takes care of it automatically if it bothers you.

Because os.rename() will fail if the destination exists on Windows (thanks for the well-thought out filesystem semantics, Bill G.!)

It's a space after a colon on a line you introduce, not some whitespace on an empty line left by an auto-indenting editor.

> Because os.rename() will fail if the destination exists on Windows (thanks for the well-thought out filesystem semantics, Bill G.!)

That's not what I meant. You can first write the temp file and then unlink the old one and move the new one in place. Presently the old cache file is already gone while you're writing the new one. An old cache file is better than none at all, it seems in this setting?

OK, I don't know what we're supposed to do with whitespace anymore. I hope someone else can sign off on that.

Concerning the caching strategy: I'm not so sure the current code is particularly safe in the face of now-current development practices: If a cache file is present and contains an entry for a module then a lazy star import of that module will use that entry to initialize the namespace. I don't think the cache ever gets updated should it be discovered the data is out-of-sync.

The cache-file is only specific to the "branch" of sage. Now that people mostly use mercurial queues, the branch name hardly identifies the particular sage version. In particular, if I apply a patch that changes a lazily imported module, the cache will not be marked as stale and I will continue working with that. The cache will be resaved upon startup (see `all.py`), but only the entries of modules that weren't in the cache before will be updated, because the cache is blindly trusted for the other ones.

I don't quite know what the best solution is. Perhaps `sage -b` should just always mark the cache as invalid (i.e., delete it)? In that case, `sage -b` should perhaps create the cache as well. In that case, there is no need to rewrite the cache every time and there's no race condition either.

It means that the cache would only reflect the sage "system library" and would need to be located somewhere in the tree rather than in a user's `.sage`. The problem is that in general the only way to know if the cache is stale is by looking at the modification dates of the module files and once we're statting all of those, we've lost what we were trying to gain.

I realize that this is escalating the scope of this ticket a bit, but if `lazy_import` lies about objects available in the to-be-imported namespace (due to using a stale cache), we have a rather critical problem. I'm including Robert on the CC here in the hope he can explain why the current approach is safe.

Or perhaps we should simply not do lazy star imports, only specific ones. Then the whole cache is not necessary.

Ah, ok, it does. That alleviates the problem to some degree. I haven't been able to locate the code that does it, but it will only delete the cache in the `.sage/cache` of the UID running `sage -b`. So other UIDs are still out of luck. It seems to me that if `sage -b` knows when the cache needs to be refreshed then it should do so and the cache should probably be somewhere in sage_root rather than in a user directory.

Perhaps rationalizing where the cache is held is something for a follow-up ticket.
