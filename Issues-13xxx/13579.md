`test_executable` runs various executables in `/tmp`. When running a script, Python puts the directory containing that script in `sys.path`. Therefore, it is trivial for any user to have code executed by the user running the doctests. For example:

```
[eviluser@hostname ~]$ echo 'print "EVIL!!"' > /tmp/socket.py
...
[vbraun@hostname ~]$ sage -t -force_lib devel/sage/sage/tests/cmdline.py
sage -t -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/tests/cmdline.py"       
**********************************************************************

    sage: print out
Expected:

Got:
    EVIL!!
```
`test_executable` should securely create a temp directory and run the executable in there.

Why not simply put

I don't think we should supply an explicit working directory in `Popen()`.  I think the explicit `os.chdir()` statements in the doctest are clearer.

There are various other things which I'd like to change, so I'll prepare a reviewer patch.

The insecurity is not because of `test_executable`, but because of Python.  So such a check should be added in `spkg/bin/sage` before running `sage-run`.

CPython doesn't check for permissions of the script directory, though arguably you want the script directory in the path if you put the script there in the first place.

I'm not sure whether upstream is really aware of the security consequences of their `sys.path` handling.

My proposal would not disable the "script directory" situation completely: I would add the script directory to `sys.path` **only if it is safe** to do so.

<a id='comment:37'></a>Do the write permissions on the directory actually say anything about security? Imagine the following:

```
$ su A

$ mkdir /tmp/test/secure

Any open files for the running `python_test.py` will remain, but any files that are newly looked up by (absolute) path name will be found in what used to be `/tmp/test/new`. In particular a late `import sys`.

Of course, this is why there's a `t` flag on `/tmp`.

In any case, apparently python comes with a caution: Don't run scripts in directories writeable by people you don't trust, not even `t` flagged ones.

We're changing that caution to: Don't run scripts in directories that have components in their path that are writeable by people you don't trust, although `t` flagged is fine lower down. We'll warn you if the top level is writeable, since that is particularly easy to exploit.

The proposed change fixes the particular issue for Sage, but with the formulation above, I don't think there's any chance of this getting accepted upstream. It doesn't look like a real solution. It's just kicking the ball a little further (far enough for us).

In fact, it's a very conceivable setup if you have multiple administrators that you want to give a lot of latitude, short of root (e.g., because your filesystem is NFS with root-squash)\n\nCase (C): (script dir only user writable but by different UID): That's how I install packages like sage! Because they need frequent updates, they're not owned by root but by a dedicated maintenance account.\n\nIn fact, if the dir is `go-w` and owned by a different UID, the script is very likely also owned by a different UID. The security risk really isn't in the imports in that case (if there is any at all)\n\nNone of these affect correct functioning of sage with the patch, since the required paths are explicitly added to sys.path, but it does illustrate that your detection heuristics are not very accurate.\n\nAs pointed out before, even `o+w` isn't necessarily a security risk, but since `/tmp` likely is, I'd find that an acceptable compromise.

Serious question: why do you consider `test_executable()` as much more dangerous than other doctesting?  I.e. you seem to say that it's okay to run doctests in `/tmp` except for `test_executable()`.

I think it's quite unlikely that somebody would doctest the Sage library from `/tmp`.

The problem I have with your approach is that it unexpectedly changes directory.  In some cases, you might want to run a test from a given directory, but that's impossible with your patch.

Would you accept a patch which checks in `test_executable()` (or maybe `sage-doctest`?) that the current directory is not world-writable and raises an exception if it is?

    Testing ``sage --preparse FILE`` and ``sage -t FILE``.  First create
    a file and preparse it::

        sage: s = '\"\"\"\nThis is a test file.\n\"\"\"\ndef my_add(a,b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Add a to b.\n\n        EXAMPLES::\n\n            sage: my_add(2,2)\n            4\n        \"\"\"\n    return a+b\n'
        sage: script = os.path.join(tmp_dir(), 'my_script.sage')
        sage: script_py = script[:-5] + '.py'
        sage: F = open(script, 'w')
        sage: F.write(s)
        sage: F.close()
        sage: (out, err, ret) = test_executable(["sage", "--preparse", script])
        sage: ret
        0
        sage: os.path.isfile(script_py)
        True

    Now test my_script.sage and the preparsed version my_script.py::

        sage: (out, err, ret) = test_executable(["sage", "-t", script])
        sage: ret
        0
        sage: out.find("All tests passed!") >= 0
        True
        sage: (out, err, ret) = test_executable(["sage", "-t", script_py])
        sage: ret
        0
        sage: out.find("All tests passed!") >= 0
        True
...
}}}

The latter four tests failed.

That's unrelated.  It's IMHO pretty ok to have `SAGE_TESTDIR=/tmp` (or whatever world-writable scratch directory; same for `SAGE_TMP`).

The test just shouldn't write the script into that directory, but instead into a "safe" subdir, just where all other doctest scripts end up.

Orthogonal to the safety issue, the test could just fail because different test instances (in this case, on different machines, but sharing the test directory) use the same file at the same time.
