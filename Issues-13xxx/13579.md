`test_executable` runs various executables in `/tmp`. When running a script, Python puts the directory containing that script in `sys.path`. Therefore, it is trivial for any user to have code executed by the user running the doctests. For example:

```
[eviluser@hostname ~]$ echo 'print "EVIL!!"' > /tmp/socket.py
...
[vbraun@hostname ~]$ sage -t -force_lib devel/sage/sage/tests/cmdline.py
sage -t -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/tests/cmdline.py"       
**********************************************************************
File "/home/vbraun/opt/sage-5.4.beta1/devel/sage/sage/tests/cmdline.py", line 248:
    sage: print out
Expected:
    1
Got:
    EVIL!!
```
`test_executable` should securely create a temp directory and run the executable in there.

I'd say that the function `get_tmpdir()` is a bit overkill.

Why not simply put

```
sage: test_tmpdir = tmp_dir('cmdline_test_')
```
inside the doctest?

I don't think we should supply an explicit working directory in `Popen()`.  I think the explicit `os.chdir()` statements in the doctest are clearer.

There are various other things which I'd like to change, so I'll prepare a reviewer patch.

Its pretty difficult to reliably determine if others have write access to the directory. Your system might not use the traditional u/g/o security model but rely on one of the SELinux ACMs, or even a completely different security model. 

I'm in favor of removing cwd from `sys.path` in `sage-env` if it is not a subdirectory of the users home directory. Thats a pretty specific measure that keeps the convenience of easy importing while keeping use pretty safe. But that should be an additional security measure, and is definitely not the solution to the issue here.

`test_executable` has to be implemented in a manner that its safety is not dependent on other scripts, or we will see the same issue crop up again at a later time.

I disagree.  I think `sage-run` is the real issue and that adding stuff to `test_executable` is simply a work-around.

I think all systems on which Sage runs have at least the classic unix security model.  Additions like SELinux mostly affect system services, and normally have no impact on normal users.  As far as Python or Sage is concerned, I think we can still check the standard Unix permissions.

CPython handles this already, cwd is not in the path if it is run non-interactively:

```
[vbraun@laptop ~]$ cat /tmp/test.py
#!/usr/bin/env  python
import sys
print sys.path

[vbraun@laptop ~]$ /tmp/test.py 
['/tmp', '/usr/lib64/python27.zip', '/usr/lib64/python2.7', ...]

[vbraun@laptop ~]$ python /tmp/test.py 
['/tmp', '/usr/lib64/python27.zip', '/usr/lib64/python2.7', ...]

[vbraun@laptop tmp]$ python
Python 2.7.3 (default, Jul 24 2012, 10:05:38) 
[GCC 4.7.0 20120507 (Red Hat 4.7.0-5)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import sys
>>> sys.path
['', '/usr/lib64/python27.zip', '/usr/lib64/python2.7', ...]
```
CPython doesn't check for permissions of the script directory, though arguably you want the script directory in the path if you put the script there in the first place.

I'm not sure whether upstream is really aware of the security consequences of their `sys.path` handling.

My proposal would not disable the "script directory" situation completely: I would add the script directory to `sys.path` **only if it is safe** to do so.  In normal situations (a script with 0755 permissions in a directory with 0755 permissions owned by the same user), I would keep the current `sys.path` handling.

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A25):
> I'd strongly advise against breaking the Python specs just because you don't like them.

That's a very silly advise when the specs are inherently unsafe.  If the specs are bad, I don't mind breaking them.  Especially if my proposal would not change anything for most use cases.

Do the write permissions on the directory actually say anything about security? Imagine the following:

```
$ su A
$ mkdir /tmp/test
$ chmod a+wrx /tmp/test
$ mkdir /tmp/test/secure
$ chmod go-w /tmp/test/secure
$ cp python_test.py /tmp/test/secure
$ /tmp/test/secure/python_test.py
[...]
```
Now (from a different terminal):

```
$ su B
$ mkdir /tmp/test/new
$ cp -R /tmp/test/secure /tmp/test/new
$ cp evil_sys.py /tmp/test/new/sys.py
$ mv /tmp/test/secure /tmp/test/secure_bak; mv /tmp/test/new /tmp/test/secure
```
Any open files for the running `python_test.py` will remain, but any files that are newly looked up by (absolute) path name will be found in what used to be `/tmp/test/new`. In particular a late `import sys`.

Of course, this is why there's a `t` flag on `/tmp`.

In any case, apparently python comes with a caution: Don't run scripts in directories writeable by people you don't trust, not even `t` flagged ones.

We're changing that caution to: Don't run scripts in directories that have components in their path that are writeable by people you don't trust, although `t` flagged is fine lower down. We'll warn you if the top level is writeable, since that is particularly easy to exploit.

The proposed change fixes the particular issue for Sage, but with the formulation above, I don't think there's any chance of this getting accepted upstream. It doesn't look like a real solution. It's just kicking the ball a little further (far enough for us).

Having said that, I don't mind if we try out this patch in Sage until the next upstream release.
* Error messages don't clearly state that this is a security risk. The "not adding directory to sys.path since the write permissions are too loose" implies that its OK to run scripts off `/tmp` and therefore implicitly encourages insecure behavior.
* Since many packages (including some in the stdlib) re-add `cwd` if it is missing, the patch doesn't actually guarantee safe execution in `/tmp`.

A short & sweet **Warning: It is not safe to run scripts in a world-writeable directory (including /tmp)** would be better ihmo.

Serious question: why do you consider `test_executable()` as much more dangerous than other doctesting?  I.e. you seem to say that it's okay to run doctests in `/tmp` except for `test_executable()`.

I think it's quite unlikely that somebody would doctest the Sage library from `/tmp`.

The problem I have with your approach is that it unexpectedly changes directory.  In some cases, you might want to run a test from a given directory, but that's impossible with your patch.

Would you accept a patch which checks in `test_executable()` (or maybe `sage-doctest`?) that the current directory is not world-writable and raises an exception if it is?

Volker, I hope you can be happy with these patches.  I know `test_executable()` isn't as secure as you wanted, but I think that problem is solved by doing the tests before allowing doctesting at all.

```
...
    Testing ``sage --preparse FILE`` and ``sage -t FILE``.  First create
    a file and preparse it::

        sage: s = '\"\"\"\nThis is a test file.\n\"\"\"\ndef my_add(a,b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Add a to b.\n\n        EXAMPLES::\n\n            sage: my_add(2,2)\n            4\n        \"\"\"\n    return a+b\n'
        sage: script = os.path.join(tmp_dir(), 'my_script.sage')
        sage: script_py = script[:-5] + '.py'
        sage: F = open(script, 'w')
        sage: F.write(s)
        sage: F.close()
        sage: (out, err, ret) = test_executable(["sage", "--preparse", script])
        sage: ret
        0
        sage: os.path.isfile(script_py)
        True

    Now test my_script.sage and the preparsed version my_script.py::

        sage: (out, err, ret) = test_executable(["sage", "-t", script])
        sage: ret
        0
        sage: out.find("All tests passed!") >= 0
        True
        sage: (out, err, ret) = test_executable(["sage", "-t", script_py])
        sage: ret
        0
        sage: out.find("All tests passed!") >= 0
        True
...
```

The latter four tests failed.

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A82):
> You'll always be able to make doctests fail if you point `SAGE_TESTDIR` at an ill-suited directory. Try `SAGE_TESTDIR=/proc`.

That's unrelated.  It's IMHO pretty ok to have `SAGE_TESTDIR=/tmp` (or whatever world-writable scratch directory; same for `SAGE_TMP`).

The test just shouldn't write the script into that directory, but instead into a "safe" subdir, just where all other doctest scripts end up.

Orthogonal to the safety issue, the test could just fail because different test instances (in this case, on different machines, but sharing the test directory) use the same file at the same time.

Can we get rid of this patch during the Python 3 upgrade by using Python's isolated mode (`-I`)? There's an unanswered question about this at https://bugs.python.org/issue16202 btw.
