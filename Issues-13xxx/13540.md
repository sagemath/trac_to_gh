I'd deferred actually fixing the broken doctests to #13884, #13885, and #2120 so we can start using this (and not have everything optional broken).

For the internet test: could you use `www.sagemath.org` instead of `173.194.33.3`.  In any case, an IP address is bad because
1. you don't test DNS, which is required.
2. it can change.

For all intents and purposes, at the moment, gcc really means gcc. And building a Cython extension with a different compiler than Python was compiled with (and the relevant libraries, for C++ in particular) gets really messy. 

In any case, the point of this ticket is to introduce a framework that lets us test optional doctests automatically, as they the current setup means they're never tested and so quickly broken. We could do something more sophisticated with CC, etc. but gcc, at the very least, provides a common enough dependency to actually exercise this code for most (probably all) developers (and it's not near as brittle as others).

Replying to [@robertwb](#comment%3A17):
> For all intents and purposes, at the moment, gcc really means gcc. And building a Cython extension with a different compiler than Python was compiled with (and the relevant libraries, for C++ in particular) gets really messy.

We might then even use Python's / distutils' settings for testing tool availability (although there's no variable for the Fortran compiler AFAIK).  Not sure what to do with bdists (in case they don't contain a pre-built GCC as well).




> In any case, the point of this ticket is to introduce a framework that lets us test optional doctests automatically, as they the current setup means they're never tested and so quickly broken. We could do something more sophisticated with CC, etc. but gcc, at the very least, provides a common enough dependency to actually exercise this code for most (probably all) developers (and it's not near as brittle as others).

Yes.  Nevertheless, I don't think I'm the only one that almost always sets `CC`, `CXX` etc., in order to use *different versions of GCC*.

Support for other compilers (e.g. `clang`), probably also flags to pass, is certainly out of the scope of this ticket.  (It would be convenient to have something like `config.status`, i.e., a mechanism for storing and restoring the build environment, and/or also a "`.sagerc`" local / specific to the *Sage installation*, one overriding the other...)

How is this supposed to interact with the `--optional` and `--only-optional` command line options? I have a hard time understanding the new code.
