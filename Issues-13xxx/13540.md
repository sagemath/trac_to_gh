CC:  @jhpalmieri @gvol @slel

I'd deferred actually fixing the broken doctests to #13884, #13885, and #2120 so we can start using this (and not have everything optional broken).

Superseded / fixed by #18558, #20182.

For the internet test: could you use `www.sagemath.org` instead of `173.194.33.3`.  In any case, an IP address is bad because
1. you don't test DNS, which is required.
2. it can change.

We might then even use Python's / distutils' settings for testing tool availability (although there's no variable for the Fortran compiler AFAIK).  Not sure what to do with bdists (in case they don't contain a pre-built GCC as well).

Support for other compilers (e.g. `clang`), probably also flags to pass, is certainly out of the scope of this ticket.
