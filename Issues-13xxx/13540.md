I'd deferred actually fixing the broken doctests to #13884, #13885, and #2120 so we can start using this (and not have everything optional broken).

For the internet test: could you use `www.sagemath.org` instead of `173.194.33.3`.  In any case, an IP address is bad because
1. you don't test DNS, which is required.
2. it can change.
