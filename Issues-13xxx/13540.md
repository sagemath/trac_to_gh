Checking just for the existence of `gcc` is insufficient, you would have a lot of false positives with missing/broken assemblers/linkers...  You actually need to compile something, preferably a shared library.

For the internet test: could you use `www.sagemath.org` instead of `173.194.33.3`.  In any case, an IP address is bad because
1. you don't test DNS, which is required.
2. it can change.

We might then even use Python's / distutils' settings for testing tool availability (although there's no variable for the Fortran compiler AFAIK).  Not sure what to do with bdists (in case they don't contain a pre-built GCC as well).
