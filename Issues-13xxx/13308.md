In this example m is a matrix with rational coefficients. So according to the documentation this should just work.

Thanks for the quick fix. I didn't expect someone else to magically run into this ticket and write a fix this fast :). The modified documentation doesn't display correctly in the html version of the doc. The sentence:

check that #13308 is fixed:

was shown as a part of the block of sage code while it should be rendered as text. While I was at it I also used the nifty feature to create hyper links to sage trac tickets. And I changed the doctests so that it tests that the found eigen vectors are really eigen vectors instead of just storing the results in a variable called tmp.

Do you agree with the minor improvements I made?

The only test that failed was:

---

The following tests failed:

	sage -t --long devel/sage-main/sage/tests/startup.py # 1 doctests failed

---

But this was because I was testing on a slow disk on sage.math. So it's not caused by this ticket.
