```
Sage incorrectly computes:

```
var('n')
l  = (3^n + (-2)^n) / (3^(n+1) + (-2)^(n+1))
l.limit(n=oo)
```
gives 0.

However, 


```
var('n')
l  = (3^n + (-2.0)^n) / (3^(n+1) + (-2)^(n+1))
l.limit(n=oo)
```

gives the correct result 1/3, and

```
var('n')
assume(n,'integer')
l  = (3^n + (-2)^n) / (3^(n+1) + (-2)^(n+1))
l.limit(n=oo)
```

also does.

maxima also gives the value 0 to the corresponding limits, but changing (-2)\^n by (-2.0)\^n only produce meaningless results.

I'd rather say: did you try this with maxima 5.28.0 ? (Sage still uses 5.26.0)

The bug does show in 5.28: it gives 0 instead of 1/3.

oops, I wasn't paying enough attention :-)
