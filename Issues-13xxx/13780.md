There is a minor typo in the docstring for the function: `echelon_coordinate_vector` in the FreeModules reported in the sage-support mailing list [https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/qhzchfrq-5M/discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/qhzchfrq-5M/discussion) by Philipp Kerling. 

>The description of the function "echelon_coordinate_vector" of sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule_submodule_with_basis_pid says: "Write v in terms of the user basis for self." while it should correctly read: "Write v in terms of the echelonized basis for self."
