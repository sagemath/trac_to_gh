I think the way to handle the slow down is to reduce the `num_points` to 100.

It is not really a "slow down" per se, but it actually gives an accurate plot. Before #13135 3d plots of lists of points were just plain wrong.

I think the following is a good means of checking the time that the plot in the revised description takes

```
sage: %time list_plot3d([(0,0,1), (2,3,4), (-1,-1,-1)],num_points=400).export_jmol('/tmp/a.jmol')            
CPU times: user 5.37 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 5.42 s
Wall time: 5.44 s
sage: %time list_plot3d([(0,0,1), (2,3,4), (-1,-1,-1)],num_points=100).export_jmol('/tmp/a.jmol')
CPU times: user 0.35 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.35 s
Wall time: 0.35 s
```
Can you run this command on the Solaris machine and find out what is the time taken? If it takes much less time on the latter command, then it would be good to have the latter one (with 100 points) instead of the former one (with 400 points).

Here's an other weird thing: the test takes *much* longer when running the doctests than when run individually.  Inside Sage, there is not much difference with/without the #12798 patches.  But when running the doctest, there is a huge difference.

Could there be a resource leak of some kind?

A resource leak might be a possibility. I ran the following two commands:

**Vanilla sage-5.1beta5**

```
...sage-5.1.beta5/devel/sage» ../../sage -t --long -force_lib sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py 
sage -t --long -force_lib "devel/sage-main/sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py"
	 [10.3 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 10.3 seconds
```

Then I changed that `list_plot` example to the following:

```
sage: list_plot3d([(0,0,1), (2,3,4), (-1,-1,-1)],num_points=400).export_jmol(tmp_filename()+'.jmol') # long time
```

**After change to the `list_plot` example**

```
...sage-5.1.beta5/devel/sage» ../../sage -t --long -force_lib sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py 
sage -t --long -force_lib "devel/sage-main/sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py"
	 [8.6 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 8.6 seconds
```
That is quite a bit of a difference just for dumping the jmol into a file.

Is there some automated way to measure the memory/cpu usage of a running process?

That doesn't solve the underlying problem. Why are `NaN`s suddenly appearing? That didn't happen before #23696.

From commit [950bdd8145d262e493321bef67d3d57d26f9c464](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/diff/src/sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py?id=950bdd8145d262e493321bef67d3d57d26f9c464) the changes to `src/sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py` contain

```
-        T=delaunay.Triangulation(x,y)
-        f=T.nn_interpolator(z)
-        f.default_value=0.0
-        j=numpy.complex(0,1)
-        vals=f[ymin:ymax:j*num_points,xmin:xmax:j*num_points]
+        points=[[x[i],y[i]] for i in range(len(x))]

+        f = interpolate.CloughTocher2DInterpolator(points,z)
         from .parametric_surface import ParametricSurface
```
So if I'm not mistaken the old `delaunay triagulation` implementation fills points outside the convex hull with zeros, i.e. `f.default_value=0.0`. The same thing can be achieved with scipy.interpolate.CloughTocher2DInterpolator with the change

-1.

Plotting `NaN`s makes no sense at all. It can only lead to [garbage in, garbage out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out).

I am actually surprised that removing the `NaN`s changes the output. I haven't looked at the code, but it makes me suspect that maybe the `NaN` removal is not done correctly.

```
sage: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sage: fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2)
sage: ax1.plot([1, 2, 2, 2, 3], [1, 1, NaN, 2, 2]);
sage: ax2.plot([1, 2, 2, 3], [1, 1, 2, 2]);

There may be other ways, but both scipy and matplotlib know how to handle such things.

I cannot reproduce that failure but the original test had `texture...` so I'll change that.

On my very old, although x86_64, computer

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 10.0 src/sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py
    [45 tests, 23.20 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 23.3 seconds
    cpu time: 4.4 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 23.2 seconds
```
The results do visually look to be correct. I can't test on anything but x86_64 but if it is slow elsewhere it's not now due to the `NaN`s.
