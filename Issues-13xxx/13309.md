There is a subtle change in Mountain Lion which defaults to that system header files will use Objective C syntax constructs
although we are compiling just pure C.  This explains the build error in mercurial above. Setting the compiler flag OS_OBJECT_USE_OBJC=0
reverts this change, so that setting (globally, as I guess there is only pure C in sage) 

 `export CFLAGS="-DOS_OBJECT_USE_OBJC=0"`\\
 `make`

will compile mercurial.

A second build error occurred in gd-2.0.35.p7 where the header file fontconfig/fontconfig.h was not found. If you experience this, adding the include /opt/X11/include helps to compile gd but induces a version incompatibility between the fontconfig and freetype later when starting sage. A workaround for me was to compile fontconfig into the sage local tree using the correct free type libs and then continue with make.

A third error occurred  during compilation of scipy, where Mountain Lion does not specify the correct accelerators. Here the following helps.

 `export CPPFLAGS="-D__ACCELERATE__"` \\
 `make clean` \\
 `make`

After that sage 5.3 compiled (at least on my 10.8.1).

After upgrading to the latest Mountain Lion (10.8.2) and the latest Xcode (4.5 (4G182)), many of these problems are going away for me. Note that I do not have any version of X11 installed on my machine, which is perhaps good (I don't have any problem with gd, fontconfig, etc.) but perhaps not (there is a small issue with matplotlib).

For me, I need chsorger's fix for scipy, and I have a new spkg ready – see the ticket description for the URL and see the attachments for the difference between the old spkg and the new one. There also seems to be a slightly different, but similar, fix in an unreleased upstream version: see  http://projects.scipy.org/scipy/ticket/1710.

Also, when matplotlib is being installed, I get a window saying

```
To open "gs," you need to install X11.
Would you like to install X11 now?
```
It turns out that on this machine, `/usr/local/bin/gs` was a link to `/usr/local/bin/gs-X11`, and changing the link to point to `/usr/local/bin/gs-noX11` fixed the problem.

Other than that, everything seems to work, at least on this machine.

I have X11 installed (XQuartz 2.7.3 (xorg-server 1.12.4) to be exact), and both gd and matplotlib build without issues. The build hasn't finished yet, but it's looking good. I haven't done anything to X11. I just installed the one that Apple linked me to when I got that notice jhpalmieri got. So a standard install, including X11/XQuartz, causes no issues.

Oh, Sage 5.4-beta1 and XCode 4.5 on 10.8.2.

Update: Built fine, with no errors. The docs are building now.

iMac, 10.8.2. Works great.

Here is what I did:

1. install XCode from the App Store
2. install the [XCode command line tools](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9329243/xcode-4-4-command-line-tools)
3. download and extract sage-5.4.rc2.tar
4. switch to $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard directory and delete the scipy package (this step is not needed, I think)
5. download the scipy spkg from #13541 into $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard
6. `caffeinate make`

Notes:

5. I used the spkg from #13541 because it has a positive review and will likely be merged into version 5.5.
6. `caffeinate` prevents the machine from sleeping during the compilation: see [here](http://osxdaily.com/2012/08/03/disable-sleep-mac-caffeinate-command).

Is there anything else that needs to be checked before I set this to positive review?

I'd also check that the package/patches continues to build on usual systems (say, Debian Linux).
Or you can just give it positive review as it is, assuming that the author was careful to check this.
