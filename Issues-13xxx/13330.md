The FLINT 1.5.2 source is a mess with regard to line terminators.

Because of that patch gets confused on Cygwin.
And I found no way to produce patches that apply both on CRLF and LF line terminators systems (i.e. Cygwin and Ubuntu).
Using --binary flag on Cygwin solves the problem. 

Here is an updated spkg fixing that while we wait for FLINT2 of ticket #12173:

Right; we fought with flint people (w00t? they develop, like, on Windows? :â€“)) for a while regarding these broken line endings, that confuse the hell out of Cygwin.
