There is a little confusion about the latest sage-mode - see, for example, [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1567/sage-mode-does-not-work). On the more or less official [wiki page](http://wiki.sagemath.org/sage-mode), it is definitely at 0.7, but on the optional spkg page (and when downloading via `sage -i sage-mode` one only gets 0.6.  This needs an upgrade.

#1861 and #2666 are related, but ancient.  The SPKG.txt should at least be updated a little, for sure post 0.7 since the maintainer has changed.

The spkg is located on the wiki: [sage-mode-0.7.spkg](http://wiki.sagemath.org/sage-mode?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=sage-mode-0.7.spkg)

#1861's issues have already been dealt with on the [wiki](http://wiki.sagemath.org/sage-mode), which is more or less official, so that is good now.

The spkg is located [here](http://wiki.sagemath.org/sage-mode?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=sage-mode-0.7.spkg).  I see that 0.8 has all the other good changes mentioned at #1861 and elsewhere.

A question about the 0.8 spkg, though perhaps that doesn't belong here:

```
$ hg st
? emacs/sage-load.el
```

Ivan, do you think the goal of this ticket should be 0.7 on the optional spkg?  If so, then since Nick wrote it, you can review it.  For 0.8, though, you'd have to find someone else to review it, and that could take a while.  I recommend the former course.  In that case we can open another ticket for 0.8, where all these doc issues are 100% taken care of, I already given positive review to that stuff and the spkg qua spkg (well, except for the thing above!).

That is a good question.  If we want 0.7 to get out that's fine.  I can review it, even though there are a few known bugs in it.

Well, if you think that 0.8 is bug-free and can get someone to review it, we can do that here too.  But your big warnings about being EXPERIMENTAL and so forth kind of made me think that you weren't too keen on that yet :)

But it's been that way for a long time, so IMHO it's not worth recreating the 0.7 spkg just for that.  Can you tell I'm lazy? :-)

Not lazy, just more efficient with your time than I am.  

So does that mean you are ok with this spkg as is?  I mean, it's been out there six months...  I mean, if the point of sage-mode is to be functional, not bug-free, and has been for a while, then this is not necessarily horrible.  Sage isn't bug-free either.  Are the bugs documented?  As long as they aren't nasty silent failures, I guess.

Just let me know, or (better) open your own ticket for that, then, and let's get this out the door.  I can only review the dumb stuff like above, since I don't use, nor know how to use, nor have interest in learning how to use, emacs.
