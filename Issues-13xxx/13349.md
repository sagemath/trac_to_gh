Thanks to the GCC spkg, most uses of the `SAGE_FORTRAN` and `SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB` environment variables are not needed anymore.  So I propose to continue supporting them for now, but deprecate their usage.

Instead, we should support the standard variable `FC` as alternative to `SAGE_FORTRAN`. And I think (`LD_`)`LIBRARY_PATH` is a good alternative for `SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB`.

<a id='comment:4'></a>I'd replace *"not every Sage package recognizes this"* by *"not every Sage package recognizes this **yet**"*.

Not sure whether that's still true; at least all standard spkgs should respect `CC` (and `CXX`) [meanwhile or soon] -- Andrew Ohana and me opened tickets for all spkgs (we were aware of) which didn't a while ago.

I'd also keep the `SAGE_FORTRAN` and `SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB` entries for now, just stating that these are deprecated (or, more precisely, obsolete), and shouldn't be used anymore (with a reference to `FC` and `FCFLAGS`).




Not directly related to this ticket, but `CPP` and `CPPFLAGS` should IMHO be mentioned as well.

I don't like that, because it sounds too much like a promise.  If in 2 years, still not all packages support `$CC`, it will look ridiculous. The current sentence is simply an informative statement of fact.

If they shouldn't be used anymore, what's the point?

> Not directly related to this ticket, but `CPP` and `CPPFLAGS` should IMHO be mentioned as well.

I think we should only mention the most important ones, namely CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and FCFLAGS. Otherwise, there is an essentially endless list of environment variables...

If `FC` is unset, it will default to "gfortran" anyway, see how the `sage_fortran` script is created.

Well, `CPP` and `CPPFLAGS` are closely related, and one or two more entries don't make the list endless.  In addition, there seem to be quite many people confusing `CPP*` with `CXX*`.

If it should not be used, why should it be documented?  The message when doing `make` states clearly what should be used *instead*.

I was mainly concerned about ATLAS, for example, telling people to set `SAGE_FORTRAN` when that variable has been deprecated. It also looks like sqlite might print "annoying messages" if `SAGE_FORTRAN` is unset.
