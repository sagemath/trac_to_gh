Thanks to the GCC spkg, most uses of the `SAGE_FORTRAN` and `SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB` environment variables are not needed anymore.  So I propose to continue supporting them for now, but deprecate their usage.

Instead, we should support the standard variable `FC` as alternative to `SAGE_FORTRAN`. And I think (`LD_`)`LIBRARY_PATH` is a good alternative for `SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB`.

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

I'd replace *"not every Sage package recognizes this"* by *"not every Sage package recognizes this **yet**"*.

Not sure whether that's still true; at least all standard spkgs should respect `CC` (and `CXX`) [meanwhile or soon] -- Andrew Ohana and me opened tickets for all spkgs (we were aware of) which didn't a while ago.

I'd also keep the `SAGE_FORTRAN` and `SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB` entries for now, just stating that these are deprecated (or, more precisely, obsolete), and shouldn't be used anymore (with a reference to `FC` and `FCFLAGS`).




Not directly related to this ticket, but `CPP` and `CPPFLAGS` should IMHO be mentioned as well.

If they shouldn't be used anymore, what's the point?

I think we should only mention the most important ones, namely CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and FCFLAGS. Otherwise, there is an essentially endless list of environment variables...

If `FC` is unset, it will default to "gfortran" anyway, see how the `sage_fortran` script is created.

Documentation.  In a couple of years, we can certainly remove it.

Well, `CPP` and `CPPFLAGS` are closely related, and one or two more entries don't make the list endless.  In addition, there seem to be quite many people confusing `CPP*` with `CXX*`.

At least in the long run, we should get rid of the `sage_fortran` script as well.

If a package sees `FC` being set, it'll (hopefully) use that.  If it's unset, it'll try to guess the Fortran compiler, which might yield (Sage's) `gfortran`, but also some other Fortran compiler which happens to be installed on the system.
