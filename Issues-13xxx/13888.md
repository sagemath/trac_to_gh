Hey Frederic,

Just to let you know, right now we are having a discussion over implementation of examples of simplicial complexes in #13566 that might have an impact on this patch.

Best,

Travis

Hellooooooooooooo !!

Well, I was just able to check the definition of Barnette sphere as given in the third of your references, and those coordinates are not the ones you use... So I added a new doctest that cheks that your definition is equivalent to this one. This is a simplicial complex isomorphism test, so if you end up implemnting it somewhere you can 1) use this code 2) update the doctest.

As everything else is fine, you can set this ticket to `positive_review` if you agree with those changes.

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunnn !!
