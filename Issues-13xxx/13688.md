Right now the category `FiniteEnumeratedSets` overrides a parent class's `cardinality()` when creating a list. Below is a minimal example of this behavior:

```python
from sage.structure.parent import Parent
from sage.categories.finite_enumerated_sets import FiniteEnumeratedSets

class TestParent(Parent):
    def __init__(self):
        Parent.__init__(self, category=FiniteEnumeratedSets())

    def __iter__(self):
        yield 1
        return

    def cardinality(self, bad_arg):
        """
        EXAMPLES::

            sage: P = sage.combinat.category_doctest_fail.TestParent()
            sage: P.cardinality(-1)
            1
            sage: v = P.list(); v
            [1]
            sage: len(v)
            1
            sage: P.cardinality()
            1
            sage: P.cardinality(-1) # This test breaks
            1
        """
        return 1 # we don't want to change the semantics of cardinality()
```

This seems to be caused by not checking if the parent class has a `cardinality()` function implemented, and just overriding it with `_cardinality_from_list()` (which takes no [optional/keyword] parameters).

In `partition.py` after #13605 is applied (of course without this patch).

Also done. Thank you for reviewing this.
