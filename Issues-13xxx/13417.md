This patch defines an iterator class for finite \ZZ-submodules and especially for subspaces over finite fields.

It improves the running times of this computations significantly:

```
    sage: from sage.modules.finite_submodule_iter import FiniteFieldsubspace_iterator
    sage: A = random_matrix(GF(2), 15, 100)
    sage: X = A.row_space()
    sage: x = [0 for _ in X] #long time #takes 7.12 seconds
    sage: y = [0 for _ in FiniteFieldsubspace_iterator(A)] # takes 0.05 seconds
```

I made a small change in the patch. The line

```
        basis = [_p*x for _p in pows for x in basis] # a ZZ_p-basis for the vectorspace 
```
is changed to

```
        basis = [_p*x for x in basis for _p in pows] # a ZZ_p-basis for the vectorspace
```
Functionally the patch is unchanged, but this small change will enable me to implement `__getitem__` for a linear code (the current implementation of `__getitem__` is a memory hog).

Maybe I should have been more precise in the description of this class. For me, a point is just a one-dimensional subspace. The iterator should just return one basis vector for each one-dimensional subspace.

In fact, the way we construct these representatives can be seen as a multiplication by a vector w from the left. The last nonzero coordinate of w is equal to 1. I am not sure about the "norm" for projective points.

I will modifiy the description of this class. The problem could be solved by
echelonizing the basis during the init method (I will only provide an optional argument for those who do care).

Am I right? The reason is that once someone new uses this class, the output will not conform to what one would expect. I am myself not very familiar with projective spaces, so this was the first thing I noticed. Technically, the output is correct since the output contains only the representatives of each line.\n\nEchelonizing the basis is too much computations I think. All that is required is to determine the first nonzero element of a vector and multiply by its inverse. Something like\n\n```python\nring = v.base_ring()\nfor vi in v:\n   if vi:\n      if vi != ring.one():\n          v = vi**(-1) * v\n      break\n```\nThis can be done only once during the iteration.",

By "norm" I meant that in usual places like textbooks, the convention followed is to have the first nonzero element as 1. Am I right? The reason is that once someone new uses this class, the output will not conform to what one would expect. I am myself not very familiar with projective spaces, so this was the first thing I noticed. Technically, the output is correct since the output contains only the representatives of each line.

Echelonizing the basis is too much computations I think. All that is required is to determine the first nonzero element of a vector and multiply by its inverse. Something like

```python
ring = v.base_ring()
for vi in v:
   if vi:
      if vi != ring.one():
          v = vi**(-1) * v
      break
```
This can be done only once during the iteration.

I do not understand why this should be too complicated, as far as I understand you would suggest to normalize all computed vectors (by the way there is already a function ```v.normalize()``` doing exactly the same)? But there are (q<sup>k</sup>-1)/(q-1) of them, while you have only to echelonize a (k x n) matrix over F<sub>q</sub>.
