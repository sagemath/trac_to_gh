The `sage.gsl.interpolation.Spline` class does not recompute the spline when the interpolation points are changed:

```
sage: S = spline([(1,1), (2,3), (4,5), (5, 4)]); S
[(1, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
sage: S(4.1)
4.953437500000001
sage: del S[1]; S
[(1, 1), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
sage: S(4.1)
4.953437500000001
sage: S.append((4, 100)); S
[(1, 1), (4, 5), (5, 4), (4, 100)]
sage: S(4.1)
4.953437500000001
```

Also I think you should use single backticks to get math mode and double backticks for inline code in the documentation, and use the automatic trac link `:trac:'13519'` where the single quotes are backticks (since I don't know how to get the escape to work here) instead of !#13519 on line 131.
