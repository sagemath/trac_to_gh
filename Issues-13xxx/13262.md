```
In current sage (5.1), parenthesis printing in power objects depends on the expression they are part of:

```
sage: latex(x^(2/3))
x^{\frac{2}{3}}
sage: latex(x^(2/3)+1)
x^{\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)} + 1
```

This comes from pynac, and has been fixed there. The attached patch fixes the corresponding doctests in sage (requires pynac at least from 15/07/2012)

Depends on #13729
