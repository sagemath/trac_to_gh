That awful thing again. See bug report at :
https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/VVTWhE0w7i0/discussion

The problem is that the linear functions need to integrate with the rest of sage to play nice. The patched mip.pyx adds a parent class for linear functions and suitable coercion and rich comparison. Now the following works as expected:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: x = p.new_variable()
sage: x[1] >= 10
10 <= x_0
sage: 10 <= x[1]
10 <= x_0
```

I've folded your changes into my patch.

There are two things to do. 1) the chained inequalities need a parent as well, analogous to linear functions. 2) the base ring of the linear functions needs to match the capabilities of the backend. I've hardcoded the base ring as RDF for now. But somebody needs to add a method to the backends to query their supported base ring so we can plug that into the linear functions parent.

But I think those can be dealt with separately, and I'll leave them as an exercise for you :-) The biggest usability wart is patched, at least.

I don't think I understand the logic of the design to be able to do the exercise. Why does the base ring need to be hardcoded to anything? Ideally, I would like to see this coordinated with #12533.

It used to return None, and I lived fine with it.

Volker,

Before anything, please consider that your patches *DO* break a lot of code I (and some others probably that I do not know) have been using for a while, and that I have a very hard time keeping from shouting by myself in my office when I see you do that without caring about those consequences in any way.

Now that this is said, your patch has good aspects too. So let's talk about it, without forgetting this important detail.

> Returning `None` as the value of a sum is not cool,

Yeah.... Let's not make a mess of a code just because of that.

> stuff will almost certainly break if you return nothing and not the neutral element in the module.

Well, please consider that it just *does not*. All the code that you touch has been running for a while now, it wasn't even a module, and there was nothing wrong with it, except this ``4 <= variable`` thing. So NO, having it return None sometimes is not a problem by itself. I don't have to explain why as you just have to accept that it does not. And I swear this code has been used.

> `None` is also the value of undefined variables (e.g. typos), this is rather dangerous.

In this case True/False are the value of undefined linear expressions. No problem with None. You shouldn't say such things without knowing how this code is used.

> This is why I switched sum to a method, 

Yeah, and it destroys years of source code I have. As I said, I don't mind much if the changes are good, but it would be very impolite of you to not inquire about it before sending that patch.

> so that it can return the correct neutral element. As a side effect it saves you from manually importing `Sum` and it makes it discoverable by tab completion.

Do we agree if we say that this change with Sum has *NOTHING TO DO* with the change of base ring ? As you hardcode the basering once, you could hardcode it twice (once in MILP, another in Sum), and anyway because we are dealing with RDF and nothing more complicated this Sum may all the same return int(0) when it is empty for all we care ?
It could even return MixedIntegerLinearProgram.base_ring()[1] for all we care ?

If these changes are disjoint, please say so. I would be glad to have this patch only fix the bug reported, and create another ticket for the change from Sum to p.sum. This latter part is more problematic, I mentionned many times that it destroyed years of code, but it seems to be a nice change anyway so why not, after all ?
But it would be nice to do this in a different ticket. If only to be able to actually see what this patch does with respect to the bug reported `:-P`

Thank you for your help in solving this thing though. I had no idea how to do that `:-)`

How come you ignored my question about returning int(0) ?

Nice.

It has been an option to not have a base ring at all for a very long while now.

Having `Sum()` return `int(0)` is also tricky, think about

```
p.add_constraint( Sum(...) <= 123 )
```
Now this breaks because int(0) <= 123 evaluates to ``True``. Since neither the left nor the right hand side is of type `LinearFunction`, there is no type information to construct a `LinearConstraint`.

It wasn't really ever an option to not play nice with the coercion system, you just let users again and again fall into the same trap ;-) But since now there is a QQ in addition to RDF backends its even more pressing to fix this up, I think.

One surely can code in a very dangerous style, but this does not mean that it should be forced upon the many Sage users.
E.g. #12091 (largely a duplicate of the current ticket) is a very good example (actually, #12091 seems to be fixed by the Volker's patch---at least the 1st example in the ticket description is fixed!) of pitfalls the current LP code is creating.

For one, I would kill for Sum() returning what it should, and not None.

It's sad it might break some private code, but it's a fact of life. Sage cannot always maintain the backward compatibility, after all. E.g. a move to Python 3 will break stuff for a lot of people.

Sure, but it was a bad design decision not to have one.

```
    Constraints:
      R0: x_0 + x_1 <= 10.0

rather than

```
