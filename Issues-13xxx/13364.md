Subject: [Maxima] Maxima 5.28.0 release
Message-ID: <k09djd$dvj$2@dough.gmane.org>

Hi, I've created branch-5_28 in Git and tagged branch-5_28-base and
5.28.0. I've created tar.gz, srpm, and rpm's and uploaded them to the
SourceForge file manager. (http://sourceforge.net/projects/maxima/files)

```

The new spkg is for ECL 11 as well as for ECL 12, i.e. ASDF-agnostic, along the lines of maxima 5.26.0 at #13860. Moreover it has
an **upstream patch** preventing segfaults. This fixes few tickets.

Doing some tests with ecl 12.2.1+maxima 5.29.1 right now. I assume the target will be 12.12.1 /5.29.1 and enabling unicode in ecl if possible. Anyway I have a nasty

Yup 12.12.1 plus 5.29.1.
About the name changes I mentioned here and on #13324, I got upstream confimation it was expected and is not a problem, see
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=30232028

I'd prefer to postpone Unicode and deal with it in let's say #12985, unless it is really trivial.

Got these ones and similar in other places.
Everything looked trivial to fix and consisted in:
- version number changes,
- integration which did nothing, surely the assumption stuff we mentioned here,
- trivial simplification which was not done anymore, maybe a call to simplify could fix these,
- the strange ? things.

Ok, now the build "succeeded", although I get:

(I think this was already mentioned on the ECL ticket.  Not sure how the *new* library is supposed to work when it doesn't get installed...)




I also get a couple of new warnings (w.r.t. Maxima 5.26.0 and the old ECL) like

as far as I understand, the name might have changed, due to asdf changes in ECL.
It might be maxima-system.* rather than maxima.*

That the build "succeeded" despite of the error is due to a subtle bug in `spkg-install`:

```sh
...
check_error() {
    if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
        echo >&2 "***********************************************************"
        echo >&2 "Error:" $@
        echo >&2 "***********************************************************"
        exit 1
    fi
}

...

echo "Now installing the Maxima library as '$ECLLIB/maxima.fas'..."
cp -f maxima.fasb "$ECLLIB/maxima.fas"
check_error "Failed to install '`pwd`/maxima.fasb' as '$ECLLIB/maxima.fas'."

...
```

The exit status (`$?`) tested in `check_error()` is that of <code>\`pwd\`</code>, not the one we're interested in, namely that of `cp`.

I do have `$SPKG_BUILD_DIR/src/src/maxima.system.fasb` (i.e., with a period rather than a hyphen).

The fact that this spkg would not install the maxima library (and the error was undetected) was expected.
That is what I meant by "build with latest ECL".
And thanks for finding out why the error was undetected!!!
And yes the new library file is the maxima.system.fasb.
See
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=30232028
I've not replied yet but I don't think we need to ask more work from upstream adsf-bundle.
We'll just change the filename in spkg-install.

The makeinfo thing reminds me of something.
It should definitely not be required.
I think the solution was to touch some files, but I guess something changed in Maxima and the file we touch are not sufficient now.

I just manually copied `maxima.system.fasb` to `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/ecl/maxima.fas`, hoping that this was correct.  (Currently running `ptestlong` with Sage 5.5.rc0 on Ubuntu 10.04.4 x86, i.e., an old Pentium4 with currently just 1 GB RAM, which will take ages...)

Or should we keep the new name (`.fas` or `.fasb`?), probably having to make changes elsewhere?

Presumably yes, I was thinking of the same...  (Although IMHO `configure` should have checked whether `makeinfo` is available in advance, in order to eventually skip a few things later.)

I mean the fact that the produced file for Maxima in Lisp libary mode is no longer maxima.fasb but maxima.system.fasb and its not because of the updated Maxima, but of the updated ECL.

I thing we keep maxima.fas as the name of the file in the Sage library ($SAGE_???/lib/ecl/).

On Ubuntu 10.04.4 x86 (Pentium4; FSF GCC 4.7.2, with `-march=native` and `-O3`, FWIW) I get slightly more than 23,000 instances (exact number varies) of

and finally

Segmentation fault

	 [56.5 s]

...

The following tests failed:

	sage -t --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/symbolic/integration/integral.py # 0 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 66.3 seconds
```
(with `./sage -tp 1 --long ...`; with `make ptestlong`, the test was said to have timed out).




P.S.: The *"kwown"* is not a copy-paste accident.  Probably some ECL idiom, like ''"outermost toplevel"'... ;-)

Yep,

```
sage: f = abs(sin(x))
sage: integrate(f, x, 0, 2*pi)
```
behaves exactly the same, i.e., the interpreter "exits" with a segmentation fault, after thousands of *"Detected access to protected memory ..."* messages.

(Sage's own signal handler doesn't get called.)

Well, using the Maxima library segfaults.

I'm not at all familiar with Maxima, but

Which according to the doctest is pretty much what we expect. Trying with clisp give exactly the same result. Problem at the library interface is a good candidate.

I get all of these and that last doctest is actually a good thing<sup>TM</sup> from the file

```
    Note that due to some problems with the way Maxima handles these
    expressions, definite integrals can sometimes give unexpected
    results (typically when using inexact endpoints) due to
    inconsistent branching::

       sage: integrate(sinh_integral(x), x, 0, 1/2)
        -cosh(1/2) + 1/2*sinh_integral(1/2) + 1
        sage: integrate(sinh_integral(x), x, 0, 1/2).n() # correct
        0.125872409703453
        sage: integrate(sinh_integral(x), x, 0, 0.5).n() # incorrect!
        0.125872409703453 + 1.57079632679490*I
```
One problem may be fixed here.

Hmmm, I was probably quicker (but I'm leaving it up to you to fix this! :-) ):

```sh

# Touching html and info files to avoid to regenerate them.
# This must be done after configuration since the timestamps need
# to be later than include-maxima.texi which is generated at
# configuration time:
for i in doc/info/*.html ; do
    touch "${i}"
done
touch doc/info/maxima.info*

```

```
...
config.status: creating doc/info/Makefile
config.status: creating doc/info/include-maxima.texi
config.status: creating doc/info/de/Makefile
...
```

(The TeXinfo file is created twice, since `config.status` gets run when *building* Maxima as well.)




There are also

```
maxima-5.29.1.p0/src/interfaces/xmaxima/doc/xmaxima.info
maxima-5.29.1.p0/src/interfaces/emacs/imaxima/imaxima.info
```
so we should perhaps use

```sh
touch `find doc/info -name \*.info\*`
```
or

```sh
find doc/info -name \*.info\* -exec touch {} \;
```

Using `-name \*.info\* -o -name \*.html` in a single statement (instead of the `for`-loop) would also make sense.

same for 5.1. So I suppose this is a bug in Maxima 5.26, which remained in 5.29. Oh dear. Both 5.26 and 5.29 give the following nonsense:

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.integration.external import maxima_integrator
sage: g(x)=maxima_integrator(abs(cos(x)), x); g(x)
-((2*sin(x)/((cos(x) + 1)*(sin(x)^2/(cos(x) + 1)^2 + 1)) - 1)*sgn(sin(x)/(cos(x) + 1) - 1) - 2)*sgn(sin(x)/(cos(x) + 1) + 1)
sage: g(0)                                                            
1
sage: g.limit(x=pi)
x |--> 0
```
This, indeed, one gets -1...

they also both "can" compute maxima_integrator(abs(sin(x)), x)...

```
sage: g(x)=maxima_integrator(abs(sin(x)), x); g(x)
-(2*sin(x)*arctan(sin(x)/(cos(x) + 1))/(cos(x) + 1) - log(2))*sgn(1/(cos(x) + 1))*sgn(sin(x)) + log(sin(x)^2/(cos(x) + 1)^2 + 1)*sgn(1/(cos(x) + 1))*sgn(sin(x)) - log(2*sin(x)^2/(cos(x) + 1)^2 + 2)*sgn(1/(cos(x) + 1))*sgn(sin(x)) + 2*(sin(x)/((cos(x) + 1)*(sin(x)^2/(cos(x) + 1)^2 + 1)) + arctan(sin(x)/(cos(x) + 1)))*abs(sin(x))/abs(cos(x) + 1)
sage: g(0)
0
```

no, you  need to load some stuff, as spelled out at `maxima_lib.py`:

```
init_code = ['display2d : false', 'domain : complex', 'keepfloat : true',
            'load(to_poly_solver)', 'load(simplify_sum)',
            'load(abs_integrate)']
```
In maxima, you type in

```
display2d : false;
domain : complex;
keepfloat : true;
load(to_poly_solver);
load(simplify_sum);
load(abs_integrate);
integrate(abs(sin(x)),x);
```
to get a symbolic answer. It's weird that the definite integral does not get computed, perhaps due to an uncaught error...

no, it does not matter. It suffices to load abs_integrate only.
Actually, then I can reproduce 

```
;;;
;;; Detected access to protected memory, also kwown as 'bus or segmentation fault'.
;;; Jumping to the outermost toplevel prompt
;;;
```
from within maxima (so no, the library interface does not matter!) if I try 

```
integrate(abs(sin(x)),x,0,2*%pi);
```
What will you get with the CLISP-based maxima here? 

If I try the same on 5.26.0 (from Sage 5.5.rc0 on OSX 10.6.8) , I don't get a segfault; I just get back an unevaluated integral, if I try definite integral, and I get the same (wrong) symbolic expression for the indefinite integral.

I think the makeinfo problem is my fault, I did not preserved timestamps when updating the src directory and I think this triggers the regeneration of some autocrap and finally lead to running a second time config.status.

I'm reuploading a proper spkg in a few minutes.

Just for future reference, bug tracker is best, but also putting something on the mailing list as a "heads up" doesn't hurt - but my experience is that the mailing list either gets lots of traction or none.

Yeah, I also noticed that and made an spkg with "fresh" `src/` (also `spkg-dist`'ed), but only after I had already triggered a new build from scratch with the ECL and Maxima spkgs replaced, so haven't tested that yet.

IMHO all necessary files get touched, but as mentioned, the TeXinfo file gets recreated upon building as well.

Well, presumably we'll never merge a new Maxima without new *known* bugs (although fixing some old ones), probably even regressions, but I feel a bit uncomfortable with *how* symbolic integration (using the Maxima library interface) now fails, since Sage actually *crashes* (without itself catching the segfault).

(Others may say that's better than "silently" giving a wrong answer... ;-) )

We could mark the doctest `# not tested` for now, but who knows where else similar can or will happen.

Thoughts?

We should probably fix that in `sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py` (in the `init_code` list), perhaps `sage/calculus/calculus.py` (where the code is commented out, and is there for explanation only, apparently), and in a couple of docstrings elsewhere (`sage/symbolic/{expression,relation}.py*`).

<div id="comment:80" align="right">comment:80</div>

there is quite a bit of activity on maxima's tracker on the reported bug. There seem to be several(?) bugs triggered, not in abs_integrate package, but in the "core" maxima.

Anybody a clue where the extra question mark (in e.g. "Is a an ?integer?") may originate from?

I don't get it with `sage --maxima`.

Ahem, yes, presumably... ;-)  [AFAICS the original `retrieve` function hasn't changed.]

I was wondering whether some non-printable character (like ASCII BEL) gets mapped to a literal `?`, but at least the position is strange, and e.g. "Is  a  positve, negative, or zero?" (note the [IMHO inconsistent] extra spaces) in contrast is just as before (at least on the Python level, i.e., the string passed with the exception, before we strip "ECL says: Maxima asks: ").

4e2e7fb738e6f9f1955a5378ae392a1930b30bce
Merge branch 'share-cleanup-branch-2011-10'
```
Maxima identifies itself as `Maxima 5.26.0_70_g4e2e7fb_dirty`, and one gets

```
sage: var('a');assume(a>0);limit(x^a,x=0)
a
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line string', (205, 187))
[...]
RuntimeError: ECL says: THROW: The catch MACSYMA-QUIT is undefined.
```
looking at the commit more carefully, one sees renaming `to_poly_solver` to `to_poly_solve`.
If I make this change in sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py, line 142, the error go away. So in fact these `?integer?` things got in later.

Back to `git bisect` now.

Actually, he had fewer changes than I thought.  The change in Dima's package to deal with various names for the library was already positively reviewed at #13860.  So... lookin' good.  Shall we say positive review?  It's certainly been tested quite a bit.

<div id="comment:105" align="right">comment:105</div>

a minor point: for the test in functional.py that (now) takes a long time, without the
`-long` option, the variable `t` is not defined, and the test on
`t.simplify_exp()` fails with:

```
NameError: name 't' is not defined
```
Probably the `t.simplify_exp()` line should be commented with `# long time` too.

Otherwise all doctests pass on top of Sage 5.5, thus I would give a positive review, but since this ticket is quite long, I'm not sure...

> This spkg should be rebased to maxima-5.26.0.p1, it is currently based on maxima-5.26.0.p0.

as far as I am concerned, maxima-5.26.0.p1 may just as well die. It would cost me half an hour of fooling around with hg, with 0 benefit for anything.

When I worked on #13860 it was not clear that the current ticket can be done so fast.

The  changes on #13860 are all basically repeated, in a slightly different way, on this ticket. Due to our scheme of working on packages it wasn't trivial to properly merge the changes, so I just copy/pasted from source.
