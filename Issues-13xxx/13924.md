For the doctest in,

```
diff --git a/sage/categories/homset.py b/sage/categories/homset.py
```
would you agree with the change

```diff
-        sage: for p in prime_range(10^5):
+        sage: for p in prime_range(10^2):
         ...    K = GF(p)
         ...    a = K(0)
         sage: import gc
         sage: gc.collect()       # random
         624
         sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_prime_modn import FiniteField_prime_modn as FF
         sage: L = [x for x in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(x, FF)]
-        sage: len(L), L[0], L[len(L)-1]
+        sage: len(L), L[0], L[len(L)-1]
         (2, Finite Field of size 2, Finite Field of size 97)
```
This doctest obviously doesn't have to take long (unless `gc.get_objects()` is slow on `sage.math`) and it would be nice if we can test it as often as possible. I can update your patch if you prefer.
