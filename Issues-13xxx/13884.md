```


The files `sage/databases/sloane.py` and `sage/combinat/words/paths.py` are really covered by #10358.

The file `sage/interfaces/r.py` is a situation needing clarification at #7771.

This ticket is to fix the minor issues in the integral, preparer, and stock files.

What happens is that when the test is done, the deprecation warning, which **only occurs once**, occurs with the internet test.  This is a two-character fix.  I'll try to see if I can fix any others along with it.

And although the data is still there if one uses e.g. a URL [like this](http://www.google.com/finance/historical?q=AAPL&startdate=Jan%201%2C%201990&enddate=Jan%2003%2C%202013&histperiod=daily&start=5790&num=30&ei=Xs_lULgX56nQAe0t) downloading the CSV only gives you so much.  

What should we do, oh many Sage devels who are Google employees?  ;-)  I can fix some stuff but don't want to fix more of this if it's going to be gone eventually anyway.
