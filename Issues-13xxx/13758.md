Sage does not currently support orders in number fields or their ideals.  Part of the reason for that is that all ideals are in fact just fractional ideals.

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 - 2)
sage: OK = K.maximal_order()
sage: I = K.ideal(3)
sage: I.ring() is K
True
sage: J = OK.ideal(3)
sage: J.ring() is OK
False
sage: I == J
True
```
I propose that `K.ideal(3)` should be replaced by `K.fractional_ideal(3)`, that `I.ring()` and `J.ring()` should both return `OK`: the ring for which this "ideal" is a module.  To get the number field out of `I` or `J` use the `number_field()` function instead.

Since making such a change suddenly is frowned upon, this ticket deprecates the functions `ideal()` and `ring()` so that we can change their meaning in a future version of Sage.

Depends on #12064
