`sage -rst2sws` and `sage -rst2txt` introduced in #11459 are not doctested and are suceptible to be broken in the future. Such doctests can be added to the file `sage/tests/cmdline.py`.

Indeed, `sage -rst2sws` was broken, cf. #17371. This is fixed here and doctests are now added.

Motivated by the (second) issue found in #17371, I finally wrote doctests for cmdline rst2txt and rst2sws.
