`sage -rst2sws` and `sage -rst2txt` introduced in #11459 are not doctested and are suceptible to be broken in the future. Such doctests can be added to the file `sage/tests/cmdline.py`.

Indeed, `sage -rst2sws` was broken, cf. #17371. This is fixed here and doctests are now added.

The new tests seem to be reasonable. Doctests pass. The `.sws` file generated in the test can be imported into the sage worksheet, so it seems to be ok. I manually checked `./sage -docbuild file=src/sage/tests/cmdline.py html` to check that no new `ReSt` errors are introduced by this ticket (the list at the top is rendered messily, but that's not this ticket's fault).

For me, this is a positive review. I do not yet press the button in order to give Karl-Dieter or others still a possibility to comment.
