It would be convenient to construct a 2-d fan just from rays (by creating the maximal number of 2-d cones). This is what this patch does.

```
sage: fan = Fan2d([(1,1), (-1,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1)])
sage: [ cone.ambient_ray_indices() for cone in fan ]
[(2, 1), (1, 3), (3, 0), (0, 2)]
sage: fan.is_complete()
True
```

Depends on #12544

How about expanding one-liner

```
Construct a 2-dimensional fan
```
into

```
Construct the maximal 2-d fan with given ``rays``.
```
?

It would be nice also to have a more descriptive name, maybe `FanFromRays`? And perhaps one example can go to the module-level documentation to increase visibility of the constructor. (Or it can be mentioned in the documentation of `Fan`.)

I also believe that one more case needs special treatment: two opposite rays, in which case there are two 1-d generating cones. (So far care was taken of no rays at all and a single ray.)

Selecting distinct rays is a bit convoluted, but especially strange is repeating this selection on sorted rays which are already distinct just to trigger the complete removal of a single ray. How about something like this:

```
...
n = len(rays)
if n == 1 or n == 2 and rays[0] == -rays[1]:
    cones = [(i, ) for i in range(n)]
    return RationalPolyhedralFan(cones, rays, lattice, False) 

import math
sorted_rays = sorted(...)
cones = []
...
# there are definitely some 2-d cones now
```

Just as in the `Fan()` constructor, it is permissible to pass an arbitrary number of duplicate rays. For example:

Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N

I fixed the completeness bug.

I was complaining not about removing duplicates - that is fine - but about the way how it is done. Nonetheless, it is still clear what is going on. But the line

```
sorted_rays = [ r for i,r in enumerate(sorted_rays) if r[1] != sorted_rays[i-1][1] ] 
```
is very confusing: sorted rays are already unique and the equality can be triggered only when the first element is equal to the previous, i.e. the last one, which is the same as first when the length is one. In other words the effect of this line is the same as

```
if len(sorted_rays) == 1: sorted_rays = []
```
and it does require some thinking to figure out that this is what happening and then realize how the rest of the code depends on it.

So I still propose to unwind the code a bit, if you agree with the changes in the reviewer patch, please set it to positive review!
