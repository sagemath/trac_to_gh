Attachment: **[trac_13537.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13537/trac_13537.patch.gz)**

Instead of adding a second stopgap warning to the `_xgcd` method of `Polynomial_padic_field_dense`, I removed it entirely. It is a protected method, with no doctest which is not called anywhere in sage:

```

rings/polynomial/polynomial_element_generic.py:777:class Polynomial_padic_field_dense(Polynomial_padic_generic_dense, Polynomial_generic_dense_field):

sage: search_src("Polynomial_padic_field_lazy_dense")

I followed the developer's guide: "Stopgap tickets should be marked as blockers." Should I have changed the version?
