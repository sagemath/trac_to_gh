The extra debugging output "`[number of refs]`" before each command line prompt breaks the pynad build. the problem is that the test used by the AX_PYTHON_DEVEL autoconf macro to check for distutils fails when Python is built with pydebug.

Also, breaks the Sage test suite.

I'm just removing this extra output. Its not that useful, really, since object counts in Sage are always pretty large and widely fluctuating with stuff like coercion running in the background. It also doesn't offer any extra info over `gc.get_count()`.

export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS `testcflags.sh -fwrapv`"

I'm ok with the solution Volker proposes, we don't need that "extra" output, but I still think that Pynac should be able to deal with a vanilla Python debug build.
So I'm just posting that here so that Burcin can take notice (I'll post on pynac-devel as well).

I use the package successfully with SAGE_DEBUG=yes.

Some criticism: SPKG.txt contains a section "Patches", but the new patch disable_print_refs_debug.patch is not mentioned.

The content of environment variables is sometimes tested like

```
if ["x$SAGE_DEBUG"="xyes"]; then
```
if I am not mistaken, but here it is

```
if ["$SAGE_DEBUG"="yes"]; then
```
Is that a problem?

I've added a line documenting the disable_print_refs_debug.patch

The `xyes` thing is a historical artifact.

Looks good.

If you really wants me to rant, I'd say:
* first, there is a useless line at the end of the new patch for some emacs generated tmp file.
* or even less problematic, you could remove the historical artifacts from spkg-install while you're at it.
