Over lunch today, Jamie Radcliffe at University of Nebraska, Lincoln, suggested making the vertex label plotting more flexible to take a dictionary or function that gives the vertex labels.  This patch makes that possible.

Still to do: do the same thing for the edge_labels parameter.

This is a git version of the patch. I added a few examples.

For `edge_labels`, it seems way more difficult to do as we have to take into account loops, multiple edges, orientation, etc. So I propose to let it for a future ticket.
