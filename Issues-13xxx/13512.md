sage/misc/misc_c.pyx needs some double colons and blank lines.  For example

```
sage: prod?
...
       EXAMPLES:
          sage: prod([1,2,34]) 68 sage: prod([2,3], 5) 30 sage:
          prod((1,2,3), 5) 30 sage: F = factor(-2006); F -1 * 2 * 17 * 59
          sage: prod(F) -2006
...
```
The patch should solve the problem.
