Thanks for the patch. There are some minor issues, so I'm switching to needs_work. Here is a short review:

* The patch lacks doctests or a commit message.

* The call to `_pow_modulus` should be of the form `self._pow_modulus(right, modulus)` instead of `Polynomial._pow_modulus(self, right, modulus)`. If Cython does not recognize that `self` is a `Polynomial`, you can declare that in the function definition, e.g. use `def __pow__(Polynomial self, right, modulus)`.

* To extract maximum performance, I suggest replacing calls to `self.parent()` by direct attribute access (`self._parent`) and declaring the type of the `n` in the `_pow_modulus()` function to be an `int`, and `pow` to be `Polynomial`.

Thanks for you review. I've updated my patch.

- I added doctesta dn a commit message

- I replaced `Polynomial._pow_modulus(self, right, modulus)` by `self._pow_modulus(right, modulus)`

- It seems that I can't use `self._parent` in a def function and I don't want to assume that `n` fits in a `int` (e.g. for applications to skew polynomials where I need this function for very large `n`). I declared the variables `pow` and `r`.

Some remarks (maybe useless, I am no Cython expert)

Maybe you could declare modulus to be a Polynomial ?

Maybe you could declare right to be an Integer (instead of an int) ?

Can you post here some timings to show how much this improves things ?

I declared right to be an Integer but not modulus to be a Polynomial because I guess that it could be also an Integer (or even something else).

Here are timings you are asking for:

```
sage: k = GF(5)
sage: l = k.extension(x^2 + 2)
sage: R.<x> = l[]
sage: f = R.random_element(5)
sage: h = R.random_element(5)

# Without the patch
sage: timeit("g=pow(f,50,h)")
5 loops, best of 3: 2.43 s per loop

# With the patch
sage: timeit("g=pow(f,50,h)")
5 loops, best of 3: 68.8 ms per loop
sage: timeit("g=pow(f,10000000,h)")
5 loops, best of 3: 276 ms per loop
```
