#12205 sort of broke `sage-starts`.  Since it runs Sage code at install time, the `sage-started.txt` file is written when it shouldn't be.

Solution: create `sage-started.txt` only from `sage-starts`.

While we're at it, move that file to `$SAGE_LOCAL/etc/sage-started.txt`.

**Apply**:

`/etc/` is for configuration files that should be backed up, definitely not time stamps.

I think our long-term goal should be to introduce a `/var/cache/sage/<sage-version>/` directory that will contain cached data like the gap workspace and  time stamps for the sage install. 

But as this ticket shows, its painful to do until we have a unified repository. So I don't mind merging this as a bandaid until we have a better solution in place.

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A2):
> `/etc/` is for configuration files that should be backed up, definitely not time stamps.

I think there is little difference between "configuration files" and "time stamps".  Ideally, all the files

```
sage-current-location.txt
sage-flags.txt
sage-started.txt
```
should be moved to one place and I do think that `$SAGE_LOCAL/etc` is the best place.
