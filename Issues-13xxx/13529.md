Hello, I am just getting started developing in Sage.  I followed the directions here on my Linux Machine:

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_in_python.html#creating-a-new-directory

but the sage command prompt wasn't recognizing the **from sage.<package-name>.all import *** command.

After restarting, the issue wasn't fixed.  So I ran **./sage -b **based on the preceding subsection of the link above.

Now I can't even run sage.

Why would this occur?  What can be done to fix this problem?

Attached is the output from the **./sage -b **DIRECTLY FOLLOWED by output when I try to run **./sage** now.

This is my first programming experience.  Thank you.

What happens if you download Sage, **don't run ./sage -b** and simply run **./sage**?

Do you have a C compiler?  If you want to develop Sage, you need to install `gcc`.

Hi, I don't know whether I had a C compiler, and if I didn't and it's a prerequisite, then maybe that should be noted?

It is indeed a prerequisite for *developing* Sage.

So it is a prerequisite for developing Sage, but not a prerequisite for running Sage and therefore is not and should not come with the Sage Binary.  Is that correct and should we then close this ticket?

In any case, it is sort-of duplicate of #11162.

But even *without* a C compiler, running `./sage -b` should not destroy Sage.  So I think that's still a bug.
