Hello, I am just getting started developing in Sage.  I followed the directions here on my Linux Machine:

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_in_python.html#creating-a-new-directory

but the sage command prompt wasn't recognizing the **from sage.<package-name>.all import *** command.

After restarting, the issue wasn't fixed.  So I ran **./sage -b **based on the preceding subsection of the link above.

Now I can't even run sage.

Why would this occur?  What can be done to fix this problem?

Attached is the output from the **./sage -b **DIRECTLY FOLLOWED by output when I try to run **./sage** now.

This is my first programming experience.  Thank you.

It is indeed a prerequisite for *developing* Sage.

But even *without* a C compiler, running `./sage -b` should not destroy Sage.  So I think that's still a bug.
