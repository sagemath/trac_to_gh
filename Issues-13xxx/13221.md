Somewhere between Sage 4.4.4 and 4.8 we changed behavior - not correctly, I'd say.

The problem is that `limit` ends with

```
return ex.parent()(l)
```
and functions depending on certain variables have limits depending on the same variables. I wonder where else such a behaviour may pop-up and what would be a good generic way to handle it.

I do get the reported behaviour in 6.5beta

```
sage: f(x) = x^2
sage: limit(f,x=1)
x |--> 1
```
This is coming from the fact that sage does this transformation (well, it's a side-effect of the implementation above):

```
limit( E.function(t), t=1) ---> E.limit(t=1).function(t)
```
That transformation really has no merit whatsoever. The thing that's hard about this is that the type of `E.function(t)` is just `SymbolicExpression`. The callable bit is entirely stored in the parent.

Another way would be to subclass to CallableSymbolicExpression and override things like `limit` and `integral` to produce errors instead (or do something useful if there is a reasonable choice).

Arithmetic on callable expressions in general seems pretty sane:

```
sage: f(x)=x^2
sage: g(y)=1+y
sage: f+g
(x, y) |--> x^2 + y + 1
```
