According to `spkg/standard/deps`, GAP depends on SAGE.  But there is nothing in the GAP sources which refers to Sage, `gap_reset_worksheet()` is a Sage libary function.

GAP does use readline if available, and we do link against it:

```
(sage-sh) vbraun@volker-desktop:hg$ ldd $SAGE_LOCAL/gap/latest/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc-default64/gap
	linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fff78fff000)
	libm.so.6 => /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00000036c4800000)
	libreadline.so.6 => /home/vbraun/opt/sage-5.3.rc1/local/lib/libreadline.so.6 (0x00007f2291759000)
	libncurses.so.5 => /lib64/libncurses.so.5 (0x00000036da400000)
	libtinfo.so.5 => /lib64/libtinfo.so.5 (0x00000036d5800000)
	libdl.so.2 => /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00000036c5000000)
	libutil.so.1 => /lib64/libutil.so.1 (0x00000036d6800000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00000036c4400000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00000036c4000000)
```
We don't need the Sage library, at least gap-4.5.5 doesn't build the workspace cache as part of the spkg. Adding TERMCAP to the deps sounds good to me.

You must be using a different version of GAP:

```
jdemeyer@arcanis:/usr/local/src/sage-5.3.rc0$ ./sage --sh -c 'ldd $SAGE_LOCAL/gap/latest/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc-default64/gap'
ldd: /usr/local/src/sage-5.3.rc0/local/gap/latest/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc-default64/gap: No such file or directory
```

However:

```
jdemeyer@arcanis:/usr/local/src/sage-5.3.rc0$ ./sage --sh -c 'ldd $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/gap-4.4.12/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc/gap'
        linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fffe05f5000)
        libm.so.6 => /lib/libm.so.6 (0x00007f40c9311000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f40c910d000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007f40c8db1000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f40c9594000)
```

GAP-4.5.5 links against readline indeed.  So the person who wrote these dependencies must have had a crystal ball to predict that GAP would be using `readline`.
