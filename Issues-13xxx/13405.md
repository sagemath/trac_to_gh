When upgrading the notebook from the pre-flask notebook, the reference manual gives WARNING because of old `.rst` files still present:

```
/release/buildbot/sage/sage-1/sage_upgrade_5.0.1/build/sage-5.4.beta0/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/sagenb/notebook/twist.rst:9: WARNING: autodoc can't import/find module 'sagenb.notebook.twist', it reported error: "No module named twist", please check your spelling and sys.path

```

The solution is to delete the `doc/en/reference/sagenb` directory when installing the notebook.
