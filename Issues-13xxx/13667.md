In `sage/coding/code_bounds.py` there is a comment:

```
 (1) Indirectly, using minimum_distance_lower_bound(n,k,F) and
 minimum_distance_upper_bound(n,k,F) (both of which which connect
 to the internet using Steven Sivek's linear_code_bound(q,n,k))
```

However, linear_code_bound (in databases/lincodes.py) is completely commented out.
This happened more than 5 years ago:

```
$ hg blame databases/lincodes.py | grep def\ linear_code_bound
 4858: ## def linear_code_bound(q, n, k, verbose=False):

$ hg log -g -r 4858 databases/lincodes.py

summary:     doctest fixes
```

There are up-to-date (and much bigger) tables on http://www.codetables.de/
maintained by Markus Grassl (who took over from Andries Brouwer his tables---
used by  `linear_code_bound`). They are hooked up in `sage/coding/linear_code.py`, function `best_known_linear_code_www()`. 

So `sage/coding/code_bounds.py` should mention this, and not the obsolete stuff.

Markus Grassl works at NUS's CQT. I already asked Fred E. to contact him regarding this; it should be trivial to hook up a "raw" interface to his site, I guess.

The statement above it says

```
Thus, solving the solving a generalization of the game of "20
questions" is equivalent to determining `A_2(n,d)`! Using
Sage, you can determine the best known estimates for this number in
2 ways:
```
And then it goes on to talk about `linear_code_bound` and other stuff, which you have now fixed. The problem is that `A_2(n,d)` gives the estimate for nonlinear codes and not (just) for linear codes. Something else needs to be added to the paragraph before these functions are mentioned. Something which says that the bounds in (1) and (2) do not always give `A_2(n,d)`.... Will think of a proper sentence later. Too sleepy now.
