This patch implements the following fixes to symmetric functions:
- HL creation operator for k-Schur functions
- it fixes omega for k-Schur functions for generic t
- it changes the multiplication for k-Schur functions for generic t, so that
  the result stays in the k-bounded subspace if possible and lifts to symmetric functions otherwise
- it moves coproduct_by_coercion to SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_generic and
  inserts a coproduct function in KBoundedSubspaceBases, ElementMethods
- it fixes the coersion between the Jack P and Pq basis; this was previously extremely slow,
  for example for

  ```
      sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['t']))
      sage: Qp = Sym.jack().Qp()
      sage: P = Sym.jack().P()
      sage: P(Qp[2,1])
      ((-192*t^3+192*t^2-192*t+192)/(-64*t^3-224*t^2-224*t-64))*JackP[1, 1, 1]
      + ((128*t^2-64*t+80)/(64*t^2+64*t+16))*JackP[2, 1] + ((8*t-8)/(8*t+4))*JackP[3]
   ```
- it fixes the coproduct for Jack symmetric functions

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

Speaking of fixes/improvements for symmetric functions: the current code is not perfectly consistent for the naming of the bases:

```
sage: S = SymmetricFunctions(QQ['q,t'].fraction_field())
sage: S.s()
Symmetric Function Algebra over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field, Schur symmetric functions as basis
sage: S.macdonald().P()
Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field in the realization MacdonaldPolynomials_p
```

And indeed in the code, S.s()._repr_ comes from SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_classical, where as
S.macdonald().P()._repr_ comes from generic with_realization code.

What about moving (in this ticket, or later), the `_repr_` from
SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_classical to SymmetricFunctionsBases?

A bit of fiddling with ._basis might be needed to get the string 'Macdonald P symmetric functions' right, but this should not be too bad.

Cheers,
                       Nicolas

PS: as a side effect, this would help me a bit with my functorial
construction patch, as it currently breaks the naming of the
macdo/llt/hl basis, and would not anymore with the changes above.

Hi Mike,

Thanks for the addition! I made some more changes to the doc explanations (there was still a reference to monomial symmetric functions even though coproduct_by_coercion was moved to sfa.py). I also added some further tests for k-Schurs and LLTs. Both patches are now folded, so please only

All tests pass on sage_5.3.rc0 + two additional 5457 patches. No idea what the current version of sage is that we are supposed to test against!

Best,
