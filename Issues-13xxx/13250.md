Various combinatorial objects already have order relations available, but the posets themselves are not available. (An example of such a poset that is available is SymmetricGroupWeakOrderPoset.)

Posets to add:
* set partitions ordered by refinement (done)
* Young's lattice up to rank n (done)
* Principal order ideal in Young's lattice (done)
* dominance order on partitions (done)
* poset of cells in a Young diagram (done)
* absolute order on the symmetric group (done) (see also #14816)

Hellooooooooooooo !!

Two comments : 
* You can use in the code of `PartitionsDominanceOrder` the same trick that you used in `SetPartitions` : instead of defining `dominance_leq` you can directly return

```
Poset([Partitions(n),Partition.dominates])
```

* Could you add an INPUT section to the docstrings of all functions ? It is in particular impossible right now to guess what the `"labels"` argument of `SymmetricGroupAbsoluteOrderPoset` can accept as an input, and what the result would be. I do not understand what this `n<10` constraint does either.

And a question too... Do you have any idea what "mro" does inside of posets ? `O_o`

```
sage: posets.mro??
Error getting source: <built-in method mro of sage.misc.classcall_metaclass.ClasscallMetaclass object at 0x4533aa0> is not a module, class, method, function, traceback, frame, or code object
Type:       builtin_function_or_method
String Form:<built-in method mro of sage.misc.classcall_metaclass.ClasscallMetaclass object at 0x4533aa0>
Docstring:  mro() -> list return a type's method resolution order
sage: 
```

I do not see where it is imported there, but I don't get why it should `O_o`

I'm not totally sure what you mean, so I might be about to say things you know. My rough understanding is that `mro` is a method that all classes have (so it wouldn't get imported) that returns a list telling you what precedence the classes it inherited form have when looking for functions (i.e. if it inherited `foo` from two different classes, which `foo` wins?).

Hey,

So `cls.mro()` returns the method resolution order (MRO for short), which is the sequences of superclasses of the type (class) `cls` in some linear order that used to in order to determine which method to call. The MRO is used to solve what is known as the diamond problem with multiple inheritance. All things in python will have one since all objects have one and everything is an object. Also `cls.mro()` is equivalent (up to tuple -> list) to calling `cls.__mro__`. In short, it does exactly as it says it does because `posets` is a class.

More importantly, for the patch could you do the following:

- Implement Young's lattice using

  ```
  Poset((partitions, Partition.contains))
  ```
  as with the other similar prebuilt functions.
- It's not good practice to call the variable you iterate over the same as the defining variable for the iteration:

  ```
  partitions = flatten([list(Partitions(n)) for n in range(n+1)])
  ```
  because `n` gets overwritten (of course that's not a problem here, but in general this can be a subtle bug).
- The `cell_leq` method is not needed since the default comparison between lists/tuples in python is lex which matches your definition (and your current implementation does not match your def'n in that the def'n has "or" whereas the test has "and").
- Could you split line 570 a few times? It's quite long.
- You'll need to put your real name as the author.

Once these are done, I'd be happy setting this to positive review.

Thanks,

Travis

My question is pretty simple : this mro thing is not really a function that will be used by the typical user of the poset class, so why don't we just hide it ? It's internal stuff, so why don't we keep it internal ?

And I don't insist on anything. I just wondered about it, as it did not seem right. What do you think ?

> Implementing fences ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fence_(mathematics) ), which is a generalization of the zig-zag poset, would also be good.

Wikipedia says that up-down -posets are a generalization of fences. Should we implement it directly, as a fence would be then available as `updown_poset(1, n)`?

Young's lattice is a semilattice. Should the function then return a semilattice instead of "only" poset? Or should we have an option for return type? I.e. `type='poset'` or something like it?

These are of course only suggestions.

Yes, I meant to say up-down posets are a generalization of the zig-zag poset.

Maybe implement up-down posets generally, and then have `zigzag_poset(n)` as an alias for `updown_poset(1,n)` ? Zig-zag poset is something that people might be interested in without necessarily knowing the generalized notion of up-down posets.

Created ticket #19383 for up-down posets and the dimension n on 2n elements example, so this ticket can be reviewed and closed without being delayed every time we think of a new kind of poset to add.

It is what some people call a "meta ticket". I don't know what exactly people create them for, but I believe that they are meant to be closed once their are fulfilled?

I set it to 'close', feel free to change the status if you believe that something should be added to this ticket's description.

This is a good addition. However, some comments:

- Index of `poset_examples.py` is missing functions. Maybe this could be a place for Nathann's automatic indexing feature.

- `print "TEST FAILED"` -part should be on `TESTS`, not on `EXAMPLES`.

- `SetPartitions` works. However, actually you can say `Posets.SetPartitions('junk')`, but the documentation mentions only integers. Safe option is to check input type and raise exception if it is not an integer; it is always easier to extend than to deprecate.

- `YoungsLattice` is returned as a poset. Not so important, but why not as a meet-semilattice?

- Similarly, `YoungsLatticePrincipalOrderIdeal` is lattice. And I think that `PartitionsDominanceOrder` is also.

- Should an input section crosslink to type when the input is of type `Partition`? See output block in `antichains`. OTOH maybe just a noise.

- `PartitionsDominanceOrder('junk')` gives error but `PartitionsDominanceOrder(-1)` does not.

- Maybe a stupid question, but is "integer partitions" by definition sorted partitioning, i.e. not for example `[4,2,3]`? I was just wondering about doc of `PartitionsDominanceOrder`.

As I don't know Coxeter groups, this needs another reviewer. But I can check `poset_examples.py`.

I have tried to use "reflections()". This forced me to change the behaviour of the existing reflections method for finite Weyl groups.

Where should I put a "method for elements of the symmetric group" ? I have not found the place to do so.

The usual length is not cached. Why should I cache absolute length ?

Maybe it would be better to split this ticket into the part that Jori can review and the part about absolute order ?

Replying to [@fchapoton](#comment%3A58):

It does not look like need to change the behavior of `reflections()`, but just need to get the keys with `reflections().keys()`. However, I do agree that there is some ambiguity with `reflections` in the sense of Coxeter groups. This latter issue warrants a separate discussion/ticket.

We probably need to add such a class. I can do that.

> The usual length is not cached. Why should I cache absolute length ?

I didn't say cache it, but what I said was somewhat vague. I meant store it as a variable before you run the list comprehension in `absolute_covers`.

> Maybe it would be better to split this ticket into the part that Jori can review and the part about absolute order ?

We can do one of 3 things:

1 - include it all here,
2 - make it a dependency, or
3 - make it a completely separate issue.

Although the absolute order/length things I can finish with things tomorrow (Monday) too. So personally I'm in favor of 1.

<a id='comment:67'>Comment 67:</a>
I made a few changes:

- Added `coxeter_matrix()` to symmetric group so its some geneic methods of its elements are not broken.
- Added a new class for elements of the symmetric group (the permutation group element code could use a cleanup to bring it up to our current standards; e.g., the first input for the element should be the parent and we should use the category framework).
- Changed `dict` into dict comprehension.
- Added an absolute order example poset for Coxeter groups.
- Removed the size of `n` restriction for the symmetric group. It's artificial and someone might want the `n = 11` case to test a conjecture on a good machine.

If you agree with my changes, then you can set a positive review.
