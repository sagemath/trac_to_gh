With `sage -ipython`:

```
In [9]: for line in meminfo.splitlines():
    if line.startswith('PhysMem'):
        line = line.split()
   ....:         break
   ....:         
   ....:         

In [12]: line
Out[12]:

 'wired,',
 '89.6M',
 'active,',
 '138M',
 'inactive,',
 '293M',
 'used,',
 '218M',
 'free']
```
Seems okay here, I'm not sure why it is doing this.
