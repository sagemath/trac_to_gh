Assignee: jason, was

Keywords: block_matrix

Writing the following

```
m = matrix(ZZ,2,2, [1,2,3,4])
M=block_matrix([m,m],nrows=1)
block_matrix([M,M],ncols=1)
```
should return the same as

```
m = matrix(ZZ,2,2, [1,2,3,4])
block_matrix([m,m,m,m],nrows=2)
```
However, the former forgets the subdivided structure of M when constructing the second block-matrix.

The above will not be possible in cases where the sub-sub-divisions do not line up, but in cases where it is, there seems to be no reason to throw away this information. In particular, it makes block_matrix much more useful for iteratively constructing a large matrix while still retaining the most detailed level of sub-divisions (since there is no notion of multi-level sub-divisions).

Maybe for a different ticket...

```
A = matrix([[1,2],[4,2]])
B = block_matrix([ [1, A], [0, 1] ])
B+B; B*B
```
Neither seems to "preserve" the block structure.
