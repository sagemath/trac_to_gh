```
unlike the rest (?) of Sage, factor_trial_division returns  exponents of primes as Python longs:

```
sage: from sage.rings.factorint import factor_trial_division
sage: [t for t in factor_trial_division(8)]
[(2, 3L)]
```
It is a bug or a feature? It leads to this kind of data also being returned by factor():

```
sage: [t for t in Integer(8).factor(limit=1000)]
[(2, 3L)]
```
as opposed to 

```
sage: [t for t in Integer(8).factor()]
[(2, 3)]
```
See this [sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/whnvwlDrAEo/discussion).
Something should be fixed - either factor(), or factor_trial_division()

Problem was that exponent was a `cdef unsigned long`, which doesn't necessarily fit in a python int, so apparently cython converts that to a python long automatically.

By defining it to be a `cdef long` instead I don't think we'll get any overflow (it's an exponent of a prime in the factorization of an integer!) and now the exponent is returned as a `python int` instead. Unless people feel strongly that this should be cast to a `Integer` instead, I think this should be sufficient.

To have the exponents of type int() is consistent, it seem. Looks good, positive review.
