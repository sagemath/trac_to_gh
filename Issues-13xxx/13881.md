The purpose of these patches is to make cython emit debugging output (unless `SAGE_DEBUG=no` since it only costs some disk space) and run cygdb instead of gdb for `sage --gdb` (unless `SAGE_DEBUG=no`, in which case you get the plain gdb). cydbg can be a bit slow to start up, but gives cython source-level debugging. For example:

```
[vbraun@volker-desktop sage-5.6.beta1]$ SAGE_DEBUG=yes ./sage -gdb

| Type "help()" for help.                                            |
