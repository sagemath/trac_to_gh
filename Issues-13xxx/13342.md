There is a nice thematic tutorial on Sandpiles (http://www.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/sandpile.html), but the functions are not included in the reference manual. This is the goal of this patch.

Do you mean that 

> sage -docbuild reference html


does not work?  I read about making the document in the installation guide.  You can also enter

> sage -docbuild -H


to see all the options.

I don't use the hg_sage.apply('...') function to apply a patch but

```
sage -hg qimport some_patch.patch
sage -hg qpush
sage -b
...
```

Currently the patch has no effect when running:

```
sage -docbuild reference html
```
The objective is to build a reference page for sandpiles, as for all other modules in sage.


Most probably, I'm missing some informations in some .rst or .py file, but I don't know which one :(

Let's hope someone will be able to find the solution.

When I was trying to build this documentation, I did some cleaning to setup.py, but you are right this should not be in this patch. I will remove it.


I still don't know what's missing for building the documentation.

When I run trying to build the documentation, I got the following message. It builds a page sandpiles.html, but it is empty :(
