The current implementation of spanning_trees_count returns 1 as the number of spanning trees for the empty graph

```
sage: G = Graph()
sage: G.spanning_trees_count()
1
```

which is of course incorrect. 

The attached patch fixes this and also removes the unnecessary call to abs().

Helloooooooo !!

Well... Thinking about it, why isn't the empty set a good spanning tree for the empty graph ? And by the way, why do you think that you can remove this "abs" ? Can't this thing be negative sometimes ? I only saw that result with "abs" around `:-)`

A tree is a set of edges such that the graph induced by the set of edges is connected. Hence there is one spanning tree of the empty graph.

I'm not playing with words, just saying that one can either expect 1 or 0 there...

For instance, people there expect 1 : http://oeis.org/A000272
And I guess that you will always need one when you define a recursion formula to compute it.

Agreed for you modification to "abs". Looks like everybody out there agrees that this is not needed `:-)`

Yeah!

Though if you take this definition in mind the complete graph is itself a tree! 

I agree with your remark that this is probably just a matter of how you define it but then I think it Sage is not consistent with respect to the "is_tree" routine.

```
sage: G = graphs.EmptyGraph()
sage: G.is_tree()            
False
```
