Fix is_graded to use the following definition ``a poset is graded if
all maximal chains have the same lengths``. See Stanley, EC1.

As per this definition, the following poset is not graded:

```
    sage: P = Poset([[1,2,3,4], [[1,2],[2,4],[3,4]]])
    sage: P.is_graded()
    True
```

Beware that not everybody agree on this choice of definition for
ranked / graded. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_poset.
