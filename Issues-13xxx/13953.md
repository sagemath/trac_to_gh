```
For torsion points of elliptic curves over number fields, nonarchimedian_local_height incorrectly returns 0, and archimedian_local_height raises an error:

```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0, 0, 0, K(1), 0])
sage: P = E(i, 0)
sage: P.nonarchimedian_local_height()
0
sage: P.archimedian_local_height()
NameError: global name 'QQ' is not defined
```

The correct behaviour (for the normalisation used in Sage) is

```
sage: P.nonarchimedian_local_height()
-1/2*log(2)
sage: P.archimedian_local_height()
0.346573590279973
```

Note: the same would happen for rational points on elliptic curves over Q, but computing local heights over Q is broken (see #13951).

No, but I have another branch where I made the same patch based on #12509; would it be better to upload that one?

> (2) is your fix just to remove the wrong quick exit for torsion points (as appears)?


Yes, the rest of the patch just adds a doctest.
