There are a few surprises/bugs in the way that slices and `__getitem__` works for padics.

* Slices are not supported in some cases:

```
sage: R = Zp(5, 6, 'capped-rel')
sage: a = R(1/2); a
3 + 2*5 + 2*5^2 + 2*5^3 + 2*5^4 + 2*5^5 + O(5^6)
sage: a[0:5]
ValueError: due to limitations in Python 2.5, you must call the slice() function rather than using the [:] syntax in this case
```
* The precision is sometimes wrong over fields:

```
sage: K = Qp(5, 6)
sage: a = K(1/25); a
5^-2 + O(5^4)
sage: a.slice(2, 4)
O(5^6)
```
* Over fields, the coefficients are sometimes wrong:

```
sage: a.slice(-5, -1)
5^-5 + O(5)
```
* Some indices produce an error, even though they are inside the precision:

```
sage: a.precision_absolute()
4
sage: a[0]
IndexError: list index out of range
```
* The returned values are sometimes padics

```
sage: a = K(1/5 + 5); a
5^-1 + 5 + O(5^5)
sage: a[-2].parent()
5-adic Field with capped relative precision 6
sage: a[-1].parent()
Integer Ring
```
* They do not seem to work over unramified extensions. This is the topic of #13300.

When I tried to apply this on top of version 5.2 nothing happened. Now, I've never tried to apply anyone else's patch, so maybe I'm just incompetent. But here are a few comments (having not tried the patch):

For LocalGenericElement:

-line 55 should say "nonnegative integers `l`"

-line 89 should say "if `i` exceeds `j`"

-I think it would be nice if there was some relative version of slicing. Maybe by adding a True/False parameter like "relative". Then, j would represent a length rather than an absolute cutoff. This would allow a slice that keep a certain number of "significant digits".

Thanks for having a look at this.

I only have 5.1 installed right now. I'll try to apply the patch again, as soon as I upgrade to 5.3.

> For LocalGenericElement:


> -line 55 should say "nonnegative integers `l`"


> -line 89 should say "if `i` exceeds `j`"



I updated the patch with these two changes.

> -I think it would be nice if there was some relative version of slicing. Maybe by adding a True/False parameter like "relative". Then, j would represent a length rather than an absolute cutoff. This would allow a slice that keep a certain number of "significant digits".


It would not be hard to implement something like this. Probably it should not be called slicing but use a different method to not confuse people who are used to python's slicing. If you would like to see such a feature, you should probably open a new ticket and link it here.
