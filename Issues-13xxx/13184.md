I guess it is a bug:

```
sage: k = GF(5) 
sage: H = Hom(k,k)
sage: H2 = Hom(k,k)
sage: H is H2
False
```

I don't know what is the correct way to fix this problem.

More precisely, in sage.categories.homset (l. 223-227), one can read:

```
try:
    # Apparently X._Hom_ is supposed to be cached
    return X._Hom_(Y, category)
except (AttributeError, TypeError):
     pass
```

However, in this particular case, k._Hom_ is apparently not cached. IMHO, caching should be the job of sage.categories.homset.Hom is all cases, but I might be wrong.

Same error. I'm running `5.5.rc0`. The patchbot agreed with me on the previous version as well (all doctests basically fail), and I suspect it will agree with me on the new patch. Do you have any patches applied in your queue, or if are running something before `5.5.rc0`, do you have every patch which modifies `homset.py` applied before the patch in the queue?

Thanks,

Travis

PS - it's generally not a good idea to have periods in your filenames since they are used for extension types; typically people replace them with underscores.

For patchbot:

Apply only: trac_13184_sage_5.5.0.beta.patch

Frederic, could you change

```
_cache[key] = KeyedRef(H, _cache.eraser, (signed_id(X),signed_id(Y),signed_id(category)))
```
to

```
_cache[key] = H
```
