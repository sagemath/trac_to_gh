```
The following code produces an error:

```
sage: R.<T>=Qp(3)[]
sage: f=1926*T^2 + 312*T + 387
sage: f.factor()
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.padics.padic_capped_absolute_element.pAdicCappedAbsoluteElement' object has no attribute 'add_big_oh'
```

This appears to be a typo. Changing it to `add_bigoh` resolves the problem.

A typo: "Check that :trac:`13293` if fixed".

Other than that, I'm happy to give this a positive review once patchbot tests it.
