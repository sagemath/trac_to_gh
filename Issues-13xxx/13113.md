`sage -pkg -n dir1` fails because the main sage command line handler actually turns this into basically `sage-pkg -n && sage-pkg dir1`, which is stupid since `sage-pkg` is already using `OptParse` to parse arguments and is perfectly capable of handling all of its command line arguments at once. These patches make it do so.

Oops, I lied - another difference is that I moved the message about what package we're creating from `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin/sage` to `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-pkg`, and also I removed line 55 for obvious reasons.

The first of these fixes this stupid situation:

```
[1] fs-boone@zhenghe /opt/sage/local/bin $ sage -pkg --help
Creating Sage package --help
Usage: sage-pkg [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n, --no-compress, --no_compress, --nocompress
                        don't compress the spkg file
```

(Note the second line.)

You don't need leading spaces on lines 74-75 or 77. I think the same is true for selected lines in the range 102-126. Otherwise, the patches look good in principle. I haven't actually tested them, of course...
