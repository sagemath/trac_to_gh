Currently there is no way to know how many variables an LP actually has, without parsing its constraints. However, this information is readily available from the backend. Hence the patch attached.

Ahem... With Gurobi installed the doctests do not pass, because of their stupid way of storing double inequalities :

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: p.add_constraint(p[0] - p[2], min = 1, max = 4)
sage: p.number_of_variables()
3
sage: p.show()
Maximization:
 
Constraints:
  R0: 4.0 <= x_0 - x_1 + RgR0 <= 4.0
Variables:
  x_0 is a continuous variable (min=0.0, max=+oo)
  x_1 is a continuous variable (min=0.0, max=+oo)
  RgR0 is a continuous variable (min=0.0, max=3.0)
```

Of course I expect that your code works with any other solver `^^;`

Could you change the first constraint so that it is a "simple" inequality (with not both an upper and lower bound) ?

Your patch also needs some commit message. And I do not know if there is any rule about patches filenames ending with a .patch, but we will find out soon `:-)`

Sorry about this Gurobi ugliness `:-p`

as far as I am concerned this is an LP with 3 variables, not 2.
So my code is right :–)
(well, you don't have means to control that RgR0, so what?)
When you construct the usual dual of such an LP, you'll end up with
a different dual.

Yeah, but itbreaks doctests.

None at all. When you add a as a constraint a linar function + two bounds (min and max) Gurobi automatically creates a newbounded variable and makes the constraint an equality.
That's stupid, boring, whatever you want, but this is still how it behaves.

Yeah. That's why I told you by email that you would be surpised by the behviour of some solvers on his respect.

If you remove either the min or the max bound from your code Gurobi will not do that and break the doctest, that's all...

it only does so if you hack your Sage installation to make Gurobi the default
solver. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the default LP solver GLPK?

Well, I constructed LPs that CPLEX can solve by primal simplex, but not by the dual. LPs that CPLEX finds out to be infeasible, but for which it fails to give you an infeasibility certificate. I don't think they can surprise me any more :-)

Well. No, Gurobi becomes the default solver as soon as you install it.

But that is not the problem Dima. I you remove this "min" or "max" in your file the doctest does not break anymore, what's the point of insisting to keep it ? What's the point ?

Cause this would not be what I'd call 100% doctest coverage. :–) 
If someone else (or me, 6 months later :–)) would stumble upon this crap?

OK, I can specify the solver to use, then it will work. 
By the way, how would I mark a test so that it would only be invoked if GUROBI is installed?
Is it ` # optional ???` ? And what would be `???` there?

It would. You will find out how it behaves by looking at numerical/backends/generic_backend, bottom of the file.
This is made so that the best solver available will be used to solve.... graph problems :-P

It would be # optional - gurobi

One way or another, this weirdness must be exposed in doctests and/or  in docs. And I'll add this in docs.

I presume there is a function to find the default solver...

Probbly there... Actually I' surprised I did not write it already.

Or else we can change that... What would you think of forgetting about this behavour, and deciding that the default solver is GLPK unless some line in ~/.sage/init.sage says otherwise ?

I would find this behaviour much more sensible now `:-)`

Hello, I think there should be just two minor changes
1. in the documentation, the latex equations should probably be enclosed under backticks like <code>\`m <= c^T x <= M\`</code>, so that the superscripts are rendered properly in the notebook.
2. the patch should contain the ticket number in its name (I suppose in the name is preferred now?) or in its commit message.

Ahahahaha. Right, right, and for that I blame the rose wine of southern France (God, this place is sunny !!)

> 2. the patch should contain the ticket number in its name (I suppose in the name is preferred now?) or in its commit message.

Hmmmm... On the other hand I believe that the ticket numbers are now added automatically and that Jeroen prefers when there are none in the patch's message.

HAve fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun !
