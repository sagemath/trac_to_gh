Due to accumulating history, the names of the various bases of
Symmetric functions and variants are not very consistent:

```
    sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['q,t'])); Sym
    Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field
    sage: Sym.s()
    Symmetric Function Algebra over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field, Schur symmetric functions as basis
    sage: Sym.macdonald().P()
    Macdonald polynomials in the P basis over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field
    sage: Sym.hall_littlewood().P()
    Hall-Littlewood polynomials in the P basis over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field
```

This is not consistent either with NCSF/Qsym:

```
    sage: NCSF = NonCommutativeSymmetricFunctions(QQ)
    sage: NCSF.Psi()
    Non-Commutative Symmetric Functions over the Rational Field in the Psi basis
```

Besides, it is verbose and does not support renaming Sym to get shorter names:

```
    sage: Sym.rename("Sym")
    sage: Sym.s()
    Symmetric Function Algebra over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field, Schur symmetric functions as basis
```

I am in the process of refactoring the _repr_ code to improve this:

```
    sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['q,t'])); Sym
    Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field
    sage: Sym.p()
    Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field on the powersum basis
```

In the following examples, we rename `Sym` for brevity:

```
    sage: Sym.rename("Sym"); Sym
    Sym
```

Classical bases:

```
    sage: Sym.p()
    Sym in the powersum basis
    sage: Sym.m()
    Sym in the monomial basis
    sage: Sym.e()
    Sym in the elementary basis
    sage: Sym.h()
    Sym in the homogeneous basis
    sage: Sym.s()                           # Mind the capital here
    Sym in the Schur basis
    sage: Sym.f()
    Sym in the forgotten basis
```




Macdonald polynomials:

```
    sage: Sym.macdonald().P()
    Sym in the Macdonald P basis
    sage: Sym.macdonald().Ht()
    Sym in the Macdonald Ht basis
```

Macdonald polynomials, with specialized parameters:

```
    sage: Sym.macdonald(q=1).S()
    Sym in the Macdonald S with q=1 basis
    sage: Sym.macdonald(q=1,t=3).P()
    Sym in the Macdonald P with q=1 and t=3 basis
```

Hall-Littlewood polynomials:

```
    sage: Sym.hall_littlewood().P()
    Sym in the Hall-Littlewood P basis
    sage: Sym.hall_littlewood().Qp()
    Sym in the Hall-Littlewood Qp basis
```

Hall-Littlewood polynomials, with specialized parameter:

```
    sage: Sym.hall_littlewood(t=1).P()
    Sym in the Hall-Littlewood P with t=1 basis
```


Jack polynomials::

```
    sage: Sym.jack().J()
    Sym in the Jack J basis
    sage: Sym.jack().P()
    Sym in the Jack P basis
    sage: Sym.jack().Q()
    Sym in the Jack Q basis
    sage: Sym.jack().Qp()
    Sym in the Jack Qp basis
```

Jack polynomials, with specialized parameter::

```
    sage: Sym.jack(t=1).J()
    Sym in the Jack J with t=1 basis
```

Zonal polynomials::

```
    sage: Sym.zonal()
    Sym in the zonal basis
```

LLT polynomials:

```
    sage: Sym.llt(3).hspin()
    Sym in the level 3 LLT spin basis
    sage: Sym.llt(3).hcospin()
    Sym in the level 3 LLT cospin basis
```

```
    sage: Sym.kBoundedSubspace(3,1)
    3-bounded Symmetric Functions over Rational Field with t=1
    sage: SymmetricFunctions(QQ['t']).kBoundedSubspace(3)
    3-bounded Symmetric Functions over Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
    sage: Sym.kschur(3,1)                                
    3-bounded Symmetric Functions over Rational Field with t=1 in the 3-Schur basis also with t=1
    sage: Sym.khomogeneous(3)  
    3-bounded Symmetric Functions over Rational Field with t=1 in the 3-bounded homogeneous basis
    sage: SymmetricFunctions(QQ['t']).kschur(3)
    3-bounded Symmetric Functions over Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field in the 3-Schur basis
```

Salut Nicolas--

My 2c: 

"in the ... basis", not "on the ... basis".  

And for me, I don't think of the h basis as "homogeneous", but rather as "complete".  The bases are all homogeneous, after all!  I guess some people say "complete homogeneous", and maybe that's best -- it gives the word "complete" more meaning (i.e., the h_i are complete subject to being homogeneous).  But maybe I was brought up wrong...

cheers,

Hugh

Replying to [saliola](#comment%3A4):

I definitely disagree. Most author abbreviate to "homogeneous". Why is this symbol for this "h" and not "c"? You can change it to "complete homogeneous" if you care about this. But I think just "complete" is a confusing convention.

Hi Anne,

Replying to [aschilling](#comment%3A12):
> I looked over the patch and overall it looks very good to me. Thanks, Nicolas, for making these changes!


You are welcome!

> Just a quick questions: so this is now consistent with NSym and QSym, right?


Yes! Well, almost: there remains the on->in change for NSym and Qsym
(and in general "with realizations"), but that's for another patch.

> Don't you want to keep some tests when q is set to a value or both parameters are set to a value?


That would have been better indeed. That being said, the doctests of
SymmetricFunctionsBases.ParentMethods._repr_ includes an example with
two parameters, and the failure when q is wrong is tested in
Macdonald.__init__; so if you don't mind I'll be lazy and leave things
as is.

> Also, where is zee specified in this code?


```
 	1519	    def _dual_basis_default(self): 
 	1520	        ...
 	1548	        return self.dual_basis(scalar=zee, scalar_name = "Hall scalar product") 
                                                      ^^^ Here ?
```

> Other than these questions I am happy to set a positive review!


Thanks!

There is one more thing that Mike pointed out to me. Currently we have

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['t']))
sage: ks = Sym.kschur(4)
sage: ks
4-Schur functions with t=t
sage: s = Sym.schur()
sage: s
Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field in the Schur basis
```
Should ks be changed to

```
4-Bounded Subspace of Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field in the 4-Schur basis
```

Good question. It's a bit long, but has some desirable features
besides consistency with realizations/bases:

- The ground field is specified
- It refers to Sym, in such a way that if Sym is renamed to something short, this gets shorter as well

Btw 1: it would be good to have t specified in the name of the kBoundedSubspace.

```
sage: Sym.kBoundedSubspace(3)
3-bounded Subspace of Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
sage: Sym.kBoundedSubspace(3,1)
3-bounded Subspace of Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field with t = 1
```

Btw 2: in the docstrings of new_kschur, wouldn't we want to change

```
sage: KBoundedSubspace(Sym,3,1)
```

to

```
sage: Sym.kBoundedSubspace(3,1)
```

(except probably once in the __init__, for testing purposes)?

I am not sure I'll have the time to implement that before Tuesday, so
feel free to beat me to it.

Cheers,
                           Nicolas

Hi Mike, the changes look good to me with one exception. Nicolas mentioned in his Btw 2:
"(except probably once in the init, for testing purposes)". Could you please leave one of the original kBoundedSubspace tests in the _init_ ?
