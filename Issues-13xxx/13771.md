Keywords: linear code, canonical form, automorphism group, semilinear equivalent

Two linear codes C, C' over a finite field F of length n are equivalent, if there is

* a permutation pi in S<sub>n</sub>
* a multiplication vector phi in F*<sup>n</sup> (F* the unit group)
* an automorphism alpha of F

with C' = (phi, pi, alpha) C and the action is defined via

(phi, pi, alpha) (c<sub>0</sub>, ..., c<sub>n-1</sub>) = ( alpha( c<sub>pi(0)</sub>) phi<sub>0</sub><sup>-1</sup>  , ... , alpha( c<sub>pi(n-1)</sub>) phi<sub>n-1</sub><sup>-1</sup> )

This patch adds an algorithm for calculating a unique representative within the equivalence class of a given linear code. Furthermore, it computes the automorphism group of the code as a byproduct.

Finally, it can also deal with the action of subgroups of the semimonomial group.

If the same algorithm works for any (or some other nontrivial well-defined class, e.g. the normal subgroups) of the subgroups of the semimonomial group, then there should be a proper interface for this exposed.

You are right, it would be nice to distinguish these different notions of equivalence in
`automorhpism_group` and also in `canonical_representative`. I will change that.
There is also the possibility to restrict the permutational part of the action to Young subgroups.
This is non-standard, should I provide an interface for that, too?

> Then you wouldn't need `_canonize`.


My algorithm computes the canonical representative and the automorphism group at the same time. Therefore I thought that I have to implement the method `_canonize`, which guarantees that the computation is carried out only once. But I think, I should define

```
     @cached_method
     def _canonize(self, equivalence="semilinear"):
     ...
```
instead and `automorphism_group` and `canonical_representative` need not to be cached.
> and return the actual automorphism group, not a list of generators and order. For that, you'd have to implement subgroups of the semimonomial transformation groups as a parent ...


I agree, but I am not sure how difficult this task will become. I am not working in academia anymore, so I am not sure if I will find enough time. Maybe we could open a seperate ticket with someone else being responsible?

Just saw this mentioned on sage-combinat-devel; sorry I can't be of any actual help, so I thought I'll just drop a few remarks...

tfeulner: Given that you reference your thesis in the code, wouldn't it make sense to put it online on, say, arXiv?

I don't understand what `_cyclic_shift` is supposed to do. What is being cycled? If you want to get a cyclic permutation, why the `+ 1`'s in:

```
 	122	        x[p[i - 1]] = p[i] + 1 
 	123	    x[p[len(p) - 1]] = p[0] + 1 
```

"quadrupel" should be "quadruple".

```
 	45	    For every `i \in \{0, \ldots, n-1\}` 
 	46	    there is a group `G^{(i)}` and a surjective group homomorphism `f^{(i)}: G 
 	47	    \rightarrow G^{(i)}` such that `(f^{(i)}, \Pi^{(i)})` is a homomorphism of 
 	48	    group actions where `\Pi^{(i)}: X^n \rightarrow X` is the projection to 
 	49	    the `i`-th coordinate.
```
Isn't this a rather complicated way to say that the action of `G \rtimes \{id\}` on `X^n` is given by a direct product of several `G`-sets `X` ? I agree that the above is more precise, but can't you at least get rid of the `G^{(i)}` by assuming it to be `G` right away?

At the moment, it is getting reviewed. The final version will be published online by the university,  maybe in about three months.
