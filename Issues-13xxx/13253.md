In #8998 there was some incorrect documentation added to Cusp.galois_action . This ticket is to fix the documentation.  It is also to fix the following error, since in some cases the galois action is not even a permutation. For example the following:

```
N=5
G=Gamma1(N)
for i in G.cusps():
    print [j.galois_action(2,N).is_gamma1_equiv(i,N)[0] for j in G.cusps()].count(True)
```
Outputs:

```
2
1
0

I think I incorporated all your comments.

I also made a slight change to the NOTE:: section since it was mathematically incorrect. Parametrizing all $\mu_N \times \ZZ/N\ZZ$ embeddings gives you reducible scheme that consists of euler_phi(N) isomorphic copies. The quotient of the upper halve plane by Gamma(N) however just gives one of these copies. The new version fixes this.
