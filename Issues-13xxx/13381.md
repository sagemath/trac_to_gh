<a id='comment:3'></a>Here is a referee patch. If it's okay with you, then one item remains to be addressed: in `NumAnalysis.rst`:

- "The first step is to normalize" - The first step in what? It's not clear what's being done here. It looks like you want to convert x to floating point binary, but it also looks like that was done a few lines earlier in `x.str(base=2)`. So a little more explanation would be helpful.

Other comments (I think most of my changes are self-explanatory): 

- in `Abstract-Algebra.rst` and elsewhere, I've changed `\ZZ_n` to `\ZZ/n\ZZ`. The subscript notation is ambiguous â€” many people will read `\ZZ_p` as denoting the p-adics, not the integers mod p, and so in my opinion this notation should never be used to denote quotient rings of the integers.

- in `Linear-Algebra.rst`, I've added a definition of "left kernel": personally, I can tell from the name "left kernel" that either the matrix or the vector is supposed to be on the left, but I can never remember which.

The use of upper case in the file names here (and in the parent directory) doesn't follow the same pattern as elsewhere in the Sage library. This is certainly not a big deal, but it looks a little strange to me.

While you're at it, you should also use the new-style doctest continuations

```
sage: for K in D.conjugacy_classes_subgroups(): 
....:     print K 
```
instead of

```
sage: for K in D.conjugacy_classes_subgroups():

Because the only previous complaints were about non-doctest issues.  Patchbot is very flaky, in my opinion, and often fails for trivial reasons.

Interestingly, at least one of these failures indicates a regression in Sage.  The rest are pretty easy to fix, I'll do this later today along with the new-style continuations.

<a id='comment:15'></a>I also changed to new continuations in the main prep stuff.  Very annoying.  Some of the changes are pretty recent as well.

There are two remaining issues, I think.

```
sage: import scipy.stats
sage: my_data=[lognormvariate(2,3) for i in range(10)]
sage: scipy.stats.scoreatpercentile(my_data, int(50))
1.2439846750720158
sage: scipy.stats.scoreatpercentile(my_data, 50)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

TypeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object is not iterable
```
This is because scipy now assumes a Sage Integer is not a scalar.  I'm not sure whether this is an upstream bug or not.

Then there is this strange regression in plotting power series.

```
sage: R.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: c = t + 1 + O(t^2)
sage: plot(c,(t,0,1))
AttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute 'parent'
```
If I just do the polynomial, it's fine, so I can fix the test.  Interestingly, I get a different error with the standard syntax:

```
plot(c.polynomial(),(t,0,1))
Error...
```
