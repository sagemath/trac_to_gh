Converting a `CombinatorialFreeModule` element to a vector (i.e. dense
`FreeModule` element) was ridiculously slow:

Before:

```
sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, range(10))
sage: f = F.an_element()
sage: %timeit f._vector_()
625 loops, best of 3: 142 µs per loop
sage: %timeit f.to_vector()
625 loops, best of 3: 143 µs per loop
sage: %timeit vector(f)
625 loops, best of 3: 159 µs per loop
```

After:

```
sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, range(10))
sage: f = F.an_element()
sage: %timeit f._vector_()
625 loops, best of 3: 17.7 µs per loop
sage: %timeit f.to_vector()
625 loops, best of 3: 17.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit vector(f)
625 loops, best of 3: 34.6 µs per loop
```

This impacts for example Weyl group actions, and thus lots of the root
systems arithmetic.

Before:

```
sage: W = WeylGroup(["A",5])
sage: %time l = list(W)
CPU times: user 3.55 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 3.55 s
Wall time: 3.57 s
```

After:

```
sage: W = WeylGroup(["A",5])
sage: %time l = list(W)
CPU times: user 2.80 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 2.81 s
Wall time: 2.81 s
```

The patch builds that free module once for all (in the _dense_free_module method which is cached).

As far as I can tell, the patch as posted does not functionally change anything. It changes the documentation of `CombinatorialFreeModuleElement._vector_` without changing the corresponding code, and adds the method `CombinatorialFreeModule._dense_free_module` without adding any code to have it called.

I confirmed this experimentally by getting the following timings on sage-5.3 for the first three tests in the ticket description (`f._vector_()`, `f.to_vector()`, `vector(f)`):

Before: 270, 270, 293 µs


After: 265, 266, 290 µs

and also by adding a `print` statement to `_dense_free_module` (so that I know the code is never called). I got similar results by trying this on sage-5.3 + combinat.

Is it possible that the patch file got corrupted, or that it is based on an already modified version of Sage, or that there is an unstated dependency which introduces `_dense_free_module` as a hook?

Yikes! Yes, definitely, a hunk (well, THE interesting hunk) was somehow lost in that patch. I can't find it either on the combinat server, so I must have screwed up somewhere. Thanks for catching this! I'll work on this tomorrow morning.
