This was first noted at [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1571/plot-solution-for-y-2xy-1).  Here are *some* of the symptoms.

* Being off by a real part of 1 along the imaginary axis

```
sage: for z in [3,33,333,3333]:
....:     mpmath.erf(i*z); erf(n(z)*i)
....:     
mpc(real='0.0', imag='1629.9946226015657')
1.00000000000000 + 1629.86732385786*I
mpc(real='0.0', imag='1.5128697751040891e+471')
1.00000000000000 + 1.51286977510409e471*I
mpc(real='0.0', imag='5.1260939089106243e+48155')
1.00000000000000 + 5.12609390891062e48155*I
mpc(real='0.0', imag='2.6385510598470926e+4824525')
1.00000000000000 + 2.63855105984709e4824525*I
```

* Starting to be wrong in the imaginary component as well as the number gets closer to 0

```
sage: pari(3*i).erfc()
-1.76710569338983 E-16 - 1629.86732385786*I
sage: mpmath.erfc(3*i)
mpc(real='1.0', imag='-1629.9946226015657')
sage: 1-pari(3*i).erfc()
1.00000000000000 + 1629.86732385786*I
sage: mpmath.erf(3*i)
mpc(real='0.0', imag='1629.9946226015657')
sage: erf(i*1.42)
1.00000000000000 + 4.03986343036907*I
sage: import mpmath
sage: mpmath.erf(i*1.42)
mpc(real='0.0', imag='3.8217653554366318')
```

Ideally this would be fixed by #1173 or #13050, but if there is something else we can do (and soon) that would be fine too.

The madness with `erf` has gone on long enough! Here is a patch to tide us over until the `algorithm=...` parameter to `_evalf_` can be implemented. 

I only had to make one (tiny) change to one doctest after switching the numerical eval to mpmath. I also added a couple of doctests that reference this ticket.

@kcrisman, it looks like your reviewer patch on #11948 was merged in 4.8.alpha6, but then my patch at #13001 reorganized the doctests (moved a bunch from `__init__` to the class docstring) and the `erf(3*I).n()` doctest got removed in the process (oops!). 

Should I add it back in do you think? I have `erf(3.0*I)` which calls `_evalf_` just the same.

That's hilarious! You must have done this at the Sage Days, and not mentioned it to me :)  So you removed an erroneous doctest.  Glad you nabbed the one in symbolic/expression.pyx, though.

No, the one you changed is sufficient, since it does integer times I instead of real times I.  Nice.

Should this be a blocker for Sage 5.2, since it is mathematically wrong?  Anyway, on a first glance this seems like a good patch.

Before:

```
sage: timeit('erf(320).n()')
625 loops, best of 3: 147 µs per loop
sage: timeit('erf(320*I).n()')
125 loops, best of 3: 5.49 ms per loop
sage: timeit('erf(-100).n()')
625 loops, best of 3: 160 µs per loop
sage: timeit('erf(100-100*i).n()')
125 loops, best of 3: 1.81 ms per loop
sage: timeit('erf(1+i).n()')
125 loops, best of 3: 1.65 ms per loop

```
After:

```
sage: timeit('erf(320).n()')
625 loops, best of 3: 138 µs per loop
sage: timeit('erf(320*I).n()')
125 loops, best of 3: 2.15 ms per loop
sage: timeit('erf(-100).n()')
625 loops, best of 3: 137 µs per loop
sage: timeit('erf(100-100*i).n()')
125 loops, best of 3: 2.36 ms per loop
sage: timeit('erf(1+i).n()')
125 loops, best of 3: 1.73 ms per loop
```

Sometimes slower, sometimes faster, except on the one that was wrong before, where it's faster.

Looks pretty good.  I'll see what the patchbot says.
