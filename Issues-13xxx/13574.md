The script `spkg/bin/sage-spkg` *first* downloads a package if it doesn't exist, and *then* checks whether it should be installed.  If we want to give `bdists` without spkgs (#6822) a chance, we should reverse this order and check *first* whether the package is already installed.

This is actually slightly more involved when users do

```
./sage -i git
```
(i.e. a package name without version).
To be able to handle this properly, we need to have a second check whether the package is already installed: after determining the version number (from the online packages) but before downloading the package.

Results with the patch, starting from a binary without spkgs (created with #6822):

```
jdemeyer@sage:/release/sage-5.5.beta0-sage.math.washington.edu-x86_64-Linux$ ./sage -i mpir
Attempting to download package mpir
>>> Checking online list of optional packages.
[.]
>>> Checking online list of experimental packages.
[.]
>>> Checking online list of standard packages.
[.]
>>> Found mpir-2.4.0.p6.
Package mpir-2.4.0.p6 is already installed.
Use 'sage -f http://www.sagemath.org/packages/standard/mpir-2.4.0.p6.spkg' to force a reinstallation.
```

```
jdemeyer@sage:/release/sage-5.5.beta0-sage.math.washington.edu-x86_64-Linux$ ./sage -i http://url/to/mpir-2.4.0.p6.spkg

What should be the behavior of `sage --info mpir` in a binary distribution? I think that with this patch, the mpir spkg will be downloaded and SPKG.txt will be extracted. This is not very efficient. Either the command should exit with an appropriate error message, or we should just download [SPKG.txt](http://sagemath.org/packages/standard/mpir-2.4.0.p6.txt). I think it should be enough to change the URL to end with ".txt" instead of ".spkg".

When looking for the spkg in cases 2a or 3, why not look in spkg/installed instead of spkg/standard and spkg/optional?

         fi

The script could actually terminate at this point, if `$FORCE -eq 0` etc.

> When looking for the spkg in cases 2a or 3, why not look in spkg/installed instead of spkg/standard and spkg/optional?

Mainly, I simply didn't want to change the functionality of

```
./sage -f foo
```

It's hard to tell which behaviour would be the most expected when doing

```
./sage -i mpir
```
in the case that mpir is already installed, but no local mpir package exists in `spkg/`.  Should it re-install the installed version or should it download the latest online version?

If you look in `installed/`, then

```
./sage -i mpir
```
is going to fail in a lot more cases (it needs to download the exact version, which might not be found).  So maybe I prefer to increase the chances of success, even if a different version might be installed.  That means, don't consider `installed/`.

In any case, `./sage -i` and `./sage -f` should be consistent, the version cannot depend on whether `-f` was given.
