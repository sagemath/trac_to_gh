The script `spkg/bin/sage-spkg` *first* downloads a package if it doesn't exist, and *then* checks whether it should be installed.  If we want to give `bdists` without spkgs (#6822) a chance, we should reverse this order and check *first* whether the package is already installed.

This is actually slightly more involved when users do

```
./sage -i git
```
(i.e. a package name without version).
To be able to handle this properly, we need to have a second check whether the package is already installed: after determining the version number (from the online packages) but before downloading the package.

Results with the patch, starting from a binary without spkgs (created with #6822):

```
jdemeyer@sage:/release/sage-5.5.beta0-sage.math.washington.edu-x86_64-Linux$ ./sage -i mpir
Attempting to download package mpir
>>> Checking online list of optional packages.
[.]
>>> Checking online list of experimental packages.
[.]
>>> Checking online list of standard packages.
[.]
>>> Found mpir-2.4.0.p6.
Package mpir-2.4.0.p6 is already installed.
Use 'sage -f http://www.sagemath.org/packages/standard/mpir-2.4.0.p6.spkg' to force a reinstallation.
```

```
jdemeyer@sage:/release/sage-5.5.beta0-sage.math.washington.edu-x86_64-Linux$ ./sage -i http://url/to/mpir-2.4.0.p6.spkg
Package mpir-2.4.0.p6 is already installed.

```

```
jdemeyer@sage:/release/sage-5.5.beta0-sage.math.washington.edu-x86_64-Linux$ ./sage -i mpir-2.4.0.p6.spkg
Package mpir-2.4.0.p6 is already installed.
Use 'sage -f mpir-2.4.0.p6.spkg' to force a reinstallation.
```

+The script `spkg/bin/sage-spkg` *first* downloads a package if it doesn't exist, and *then* checks whether it should be installed.  If we want to give `bdists` without spkgs (#6822) a chance, we should reverse this order and check *first* whether the package is already installed.
 
+This is actually slightly more involved when users do
+
+```
+./sage -i git
+```
+(i.e. a package name without version).
+To be able to handle this properly, we need to have a second check whether the package is already installed: after determining the version number (from the online packages) but before downloading the package.

Mainly, I simply didn't want to change the functionality of

```
./sage -f foo
```

It's hard to tell which behaviour would be the most expected when doing

```
./sage -i mpir
```
in the case that mpir is already installed, but no local mpir package exists in `spkg/`.  Should it re-install the installed version or should it download the latest online version?

If you look in `installed/`, then

```
./sage -i mpir
```
is going to fail in a lot more cases (it needs to download the exact version, which might not be found).  So maybe I prefer to increase the chances of success, even if a different version might be installed.  That means, don't consider `installed/`.

In any case, `./sage -i` and `./sage -f` should be consistent, the version cannot depend on whether `-f` was given.
