PyQt_x11 doesn't build on OSX. We should either fix the x11 build or package the aqua version.

I've made an updated sip spkg that removes the Python framework check reported at #13022:
http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/sip-4.13.2.p1.spkg

Someone with OSX please test and let me know!

Where does Qt on OSX put its qmake tool? Is there a standard location or file name in the PATH? e.g. Fedora seems to use qmake-qt4.

For me the default location (installing the qt packages for OSX) is `/usr/bin/qmake`. If they get installed using Macports then the location is `/opt/local/bin/qmake`. HTH.
