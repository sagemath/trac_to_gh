in the file sage/geometry/lattice_polytope.py

inside the procedure

```
def _read_nef_x_partitions(data):
```

the line

```
        sage: print s
```

should be replaced  by 

```
        sage: print s  # random
```

because the result contains a timing result, which does not have a fix value. Inside the same file, three other similar tests do already have this tag.
