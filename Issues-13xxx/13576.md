`point2d` by default doesn't allow customization of markers. The patch below adds this functionality by adding two extra options `marker` and `markeredgecolor`.

Oh, ppurka, I would love you if this works, I always get stuck using `line(... linestyle='')` for this very thing!

Is there an option for the width of the marker edge?  They kind of overwhelm the marker color with the default point size; I have to go to `size=60` or so to have it really seem like an *edge*.

Am I correct in my suspicion that `markeredgecolor` sort of automatically implies `faceted=True` in mpl internally?  At least, the plots look like it, and `faceted=False` does nothing when I use `markeredgecolor`.  The `markeredgecolor` seems to govern the color of the facet; I assume this is right, but the quite different names might make one think they control two different things.

In general I really like this patch, though, including the careful small local improvements that have nothing to do with the ticket but which are still valuable.  Passes tests, so... answer my questions and you might get a positive review.  Thanks for looking into this!

I will need some time to recall what this patch is doing, and what other changes I had in mind regarding this.

I do remember that I resisted adding some extra keywords which are synonymous to the keywords in `plot`, `list_plot`, etc, and which have the same functionality as other keywords in this function. I think `size` is the same as `markersize`, `color` keyword is missing, `markeredgecolor` and `faceted` control the same thing, except the second is a boolean, and so on. Essentially, a bunch of inconsistencies on the Sage interface side mainly because the keywords used are the same as the mpl scatter command. It is really jarring that many different plot commands have different keywords for achieving the same effect.

Do you think it will be useful to either deprecate some keywords or add other keywords like color, markersize, etc which are similar to the keywords used in plot, list_plot, line, etc?

Actually, it is true that `line(... linestyle='')` is more powerful than `point` (mpl's `scatter`). Many options are not present in the scatter command.

> Is there an option for the width of the marker edge?  They kind of overwhelm the marker color with the default point size; I have to go to `size=60` or so to have it really seem like an *edge*.

There is no such option for scatter/point. But there is the option `markeredgewidth` for plot/line.

Well, let's defer that to another ticket as well - I was annoyed by this again last week.

Just one more question, about the `plot3d` method:

```
raise NotImplementedError("3D points can not be faceted.")
```
but you don't do the same thing for the marker option.  It just silently fails.  In fact, both of these work.

```
sage: point([(0,1),(1,2)],marker='^',size=100,markeredgecolor='purple',color='yellow').plot3d()
sage: point([(0,1,0),(1,2,1)],marker='^',size=100,markeredgecolor='purple',color='yellow')
```
But hopefully we are okay otherwise, I don't see any reason not to merge this other than perhaps wanting to document or raise an error here.  Maybe to point people to a list of markers elsewhere in the documentation.

I was about to make this change. Then I realized that the default marker color is blue. So, blue face with blue edge will not be visibly faceted at all, whereas blue on black can be just about discerned. So, *if* you change the default marker color, then change the edge color too to be consistent with your plot.

Dumb comment - I know the defaults would mean this could only happen if someone purposely used the graphics primitive.  But 

```
scatteroptions['marker'] = options.pop('marker')
```
maybe should have the optional default argument.

`marker` should always be defined because `Point` class is never exposed to the user and the method for `points` has `@options(marker='o')`.

The list of markers might be different between the two. We should probably just point people to the other list; for example the list in `plot`. The list should probably be compared with mpl and checked to make sure that it is up to date.

1. The information about marker was already present in points. The documentation asks users to look at `points.option` to find the information about allowed options. `points.option` does mention marker and was already asking the reader to look at `plot` for more information.

2. The marker list in `plot` was mostly complete. Added a few more.

Eventually we'll need to unify scatter plot and point, I think there is even a ticket for this... 

I would love to add more examples sometime.

```
sage: plot(x^2,marker="$x^2$",markeredgecolor='red')
```
Hilarious!

Anyway, I'm happy with this.
