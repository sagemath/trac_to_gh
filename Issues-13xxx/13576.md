Is there an option for the width of the marker edge?  They kind of overwhelm the marker color with the default point size; I have to go to `size=60` or so to have it really seem like an *edge*.

Actually, it is true that `line(... linestyle='')` is more powerful than `point` (mpl's `scatter`). Many options are not present in the scatter command.

> Is there an option for the width of the marker edge?  They kind of overwhelm the marker color with the default point size; I have to go to `size=60` or so to have it really seem like an *edge*.


There is no such option for scatter/point. But there is the option `markeredgewidth` for plot/line.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Well, let's defer that to another ticket as well - I was annoyed by this again last week.

Just one more question, about the `plot3d` method:

```
raise NotImplementedError("3D points can not be faceted.")
```
but you don't do the same thing for the marker option.  It just silently fails.  In fact, both of these work.

```
sage: point([(0,1),(1,2)],marker='^',size=100,markeredgecolor='purple',color='yellow').plot3d()
sage: point([(0,1,0),(1,2,1)],marker='^',size=100,markeredgecolor='purple',color='yellow')
```
But hopefully we are okay otherwise, I don't see any reason not to merge this other than perhaps wanting to document or raise an error here.  Maybe to point people to a list of markers elsewhere in the documentation.

I was about to make this change. Then I realized that the default marker color is blue. So, blue face with blue edge will not be visibly faceted at all, whereas blue on black can be just about discerned. So, *if* you change the default marker color, then change the edge color too to be consistent with your plot.

`marker` should always be defined because `Point` class is never exposed to the user and the method for `points` has ``@`options(marker='o')`.

The list of markers might be different between the two. We should probably just point people to the other list; for example the list in `plot`. The list should probably be compared with mpl and checked to make sure that it is up to date.
