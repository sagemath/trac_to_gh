Here is the new proposed spkg: 

    http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/slabbe/pyzmq-2.1.11.p1.spkg

As reported on sage-devel [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-devel/CuZNKclprIQ), there is an error when installing the optional package pyzmq #12843 (after its dependency zeromq of course!) on OSX 10.5.8 :

```

The reason to this is that Sage's gcc spkg does not build a compiler which  understands the option `-arch` of Apple's clone of gcc.

The following patch applied on the spkg fixes the problem :

in a nutshell: 

* rename the package directory pyzmq-2.1.11.p2
* put the patch in pyzmq-2.1.11.p2/patches
* adjust spkg-install so that this patch is applied (assuming your patch is not a change to Sage's patches to the upstream, but a change of the upstream)
* create pyzmq-2.1.11.p2.spkg by running sage -spkg pyzmq-2.1.11.p2/ in the corresponding directory i.e. `SAGEROOT/spkg/optional`
* test it.
* upload it somewhere and put a link to it into the ticket description.
* mark the ticket as needing review

(I know, sounds like a lot of work :-))

Hi Volker,

well, it was a (brain)dead response by me, the code is alive. 
Later I was able to reproduce the bug on another installation.

Replying to [jtremblay](#comment%3A12):
> Apparently not, zmq was not installed when I tried installing pyzmq :


Yes, but this was not my question: zeromq needs to be installed before pyzmq.

To summarize: 

- The `pyzmq-2.1.11.p0.spkg` is broken on OSX 10.5.8.
- The `pyzmq-2.1.11.p1.spkg` fixes the bug at least for OSX 10.5.8. 
- The `pyzmq-2.1.11.p1.spkg` also work on OSX 10.7.3.
- And we do not know if `pyzmq-2.1.11.p0.spkg` was broken on OSX 10.7.3 also (which was my previous question).

#12719 will be merged soon, so it would be nice if this ticket could be reviewed, no?
