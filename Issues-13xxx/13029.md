Fine by me, I'm just happy to see this finally get in :). When Cython 0.17 is finally released, it should be a trivial upgrade.

It is just a problem sage-on-gentoo side because I don't have an upstream package. I will have to distribute an ebuild fetching the spkg until 0.17 is released. If there was a snapshot on the cython website I would prefer to use that.
