Why the change from

```
cdef void _pari_trap "_pari_trap" (long errno, long retries) except *: 
```
to

```
cdef public void _pari_trap "_pari_trap" (long errno, long retries) except *:

This causes a file `sage/libs/pari/gen.h` to be generated.  Either this file should not be distributed, or it should be added to `.hgignore`.

For the record, the spkg is based on the commit at https://github.com/cython/cython/commit/a7d6ec066e480eb4cf2cdebd5392e0c674b83f96 

We don't have a timeline for the 0.17 release (it's being worked on, intermittently), so we shouldn't wait on that.
