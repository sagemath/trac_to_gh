The order of quadratic field with specified embedding is not induced from the order of RR and CC. More precisely we have

```
sage: K.<sqrt2> = NumberField(x^2 - 2, 'sqrt2', embedding=1.4142)
sage: sqrt2 < 100
False

sage: K.<s> = NumberField(x^3 - 2, 's', embedding=1.26)
sage: s < 100
False
```
which is not compatible with the order of RR and

```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: i > 1
True
sage: 1 > i
True
```
which is not compatible (!) with the order of CC.

The ticket implements the order for quadratic field (for which comparisons are made using only operations on integers).

Note:
* this patch is partly a duplicate because of #7160
* the modifications for quadratic field field modify the behavior of many commands (especially about output order).
* the patch introduces a new attribute to NumberFieldElement_quadratic called standard_embedding (of type bint)

---

There is no significant lost of speed as shown on the following timings.

```
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2, 'sqrt2', embedding=1.4142)
sage: a = (3*sqrt2 + 18)/7
sage: b = (5*sqrt2 + 14)/5
sage: %timeit a < b
1000000 loops, best of 3: 408 ns per loop

sage: K.<s> = QuadraticField(-2)
sage: a = 3*s + 2/4
sage: b = 5/7*s + 1/3
sage: %timeit a < b
1000000 loops, best of 3: 352 ns per loop
```
Timings without the patch

```
sage: sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2,'sqrt2',embedding=1.4142)
sage: a = (3*sqrt2 + 18)/7
sage: b = (5*sqrt2 + 14)/5
sage: %timeit a < b
1000000 loops, best of 3: 393 ns per loop

sage: K.<s> = QuadraticField(-2)
sage: a = 3*s+2/4
sage: b = 5/7*s+1/3
sage: %timeit a < b

I had a short look at your patch.
Could you use Python 3 compatible syntax to raise errors. E.g.

```

Thanks again for the patch. A few comments:

* Do you really need to use rich comparisons? Working only with `__cmp__` should simplify the case comparisons before the return statements and avoid the new `python_object.pxi` include.

* `left.D` is of type `Integer`. Cython tries to do the right thing for `<unsigned int> left.D`, but it would be better to use `mpz_mul()` with `left.D.value`.
* `mpz_sgn()` returns 0 if the argument is `0`. You don't seem to cover this case, though I couldn't find any example that returns wrong results.
* To avoid code duplication, it might be better change the if statement to:

```
        if mpz_sgn(i)*mpz_sgn(j) == 1:
            # both i and j are positive or negative
            mpz_mul(i, i, i)
            mpz_mul(j, j, j)
            mpz_mul_ui(j, j, <unsigned int> left.D)

            test = mpz_cmp(i, j)
            if mpz_sgn(i) == -1:
                # both i and j are negative
                test *= -1

Done and done.

We loose speed (~1 micro sec) by doing this. I quickly look at the code of comparison for Integer.

What do you mean by too close ? How do I certify that my float comparison is accurate enough ?
Moreover, if we proceed that way we have to perform conversion from mpz_t to float (or double or real_mpfr). A way it may work is to look first if a,b, D and denom have reasonable values (recall that mpz_t have unlimited precision) and if yes, convert it to double and try to compare the arguments.
Last, I'm not sure the gain of speed would be terrific. Comparison requires only 7 integer operations.

Actually there is no problem since we compute the sign of an expression of the form a^2 + b^2 D where a and b are both integers (and one of them is non null) and D is a square free integer. Hence the sign is never 0.

Sure but that way we call twice mpz_sgn(i)... I may change it if you prefer.


Actually, the part where a lot of time is lost is the check for embedding

```
if not RDF.has_coerce_map_from(left._parent):
    ...
```
By replacing it by

```
if left.D < 0:
   ...
```
I pass from 4 micro second to 2 micro seconds. That way comparison without embedding for positive discriminant will be equivalent to comparison with the standard embedding. This is in the last version of the patch. What do you think about that ?

The code for comparison introduces a small bug as it ask to the parent whether the embedding is standard or not (via the boolean attribute _standard_embedding). But the latter was not defined for Cyclotomic field of order 3,4,6 (which are the ones which are quadratic). In that case, the attribute _standard_embedding is created at the initialization of the cyclotomic field.

The new patch takes care of this.

I don't care very much, but I think it should be clear how the various tickets relate to eachother.  

Also #10064 is related, at least it has #7160 as dependency.

Hello,

Actually, a lot of time is lost for asking questions to the parent. For quadratic number field, it is for asking about the attribute _standard_embedding. I build a new patch with a bint attribute added to NumberFieldElement_quadratic and the speed of comparison is divided by 10 (from 4 milliseconds to 400 nanoseconds). It will be updated as soon as possible.
As modifying the structure of NumberFieldElement_quadratic is a major change, I will split the patch into two parts : quadratic number fields and general number fields.

Vincent
