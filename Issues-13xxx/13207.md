As far as I checked, the sagemath gfan spkg patches are already applied to gfan 0.5.

I made a few changes to the package in a RFE (request for enhancement) to the gfan 0.5 fedora package at https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=837857. Most noticeable one should be that I added a gfan-permissive.patch to make it work if called as `gfan` instead of erroring out and telling to call it `gfan_bases`. But it could be changed to be called as 'gfan_bases' in `sage/interfaces/gfan.py`.

See #11395 instead.
