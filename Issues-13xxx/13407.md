There is a rare race condition associated to `sage-make_relative`: when a file is open for writing, it cannot be executed (you get a "Text file busy" error). Since the `sage-make_relative` Python script opens all files in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin` for writing, it can happen that a Sage build fails.

Example from `install.log` of a failed parallel build:

```
sage_fortran -fPIC  -c sposv.f -o sposv.o
sage_fortran -fPIC  -c sposvx.f -o sposvx.o
sage_fortran -fPIC  -c spotf2.f -o spotf2.o
Making Python scripts relocatable...
sage_fortran -fPIC  -c spotrf.f -o spotrf.o
sage_fortran -fPIC  -c spotri.f -o spotri.o
sage_fortran -fPIC  -c spotrs.f -o spotrs.o
sage_fortran -fPIC  -c sppcon.f -o sppcon.o
make[2]: execvp: sage_fortran: Text file busy
make[2]: *** [sppcon.o] Error 127
make[2]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/buildbot/build/sage/lena-1/lena_upgrade_4.7.1/build/sage-5.3.rc1/spkg/build/lapack-20071123.p2/src/SRC'
make[1]: *** [lapacklib] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/buildbot/build/sage/lena-1/lena_upgrade_4.7.1/build/sage-5.3.rc1/spkg/build/lapack-20071123.p2/src'
Error compiling lapack.
```

The best solution is to move `sage-make_relative` to `sage-location`: the latter script is intented precisely to fix relocation issues.  It would also be faster, as currently every file in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin` is checked after every package is installed.  It also means we need a mechanism to force a `sage-location` run even when the installation tree hasn't moved.  For this, I propose to use the existence of the file

```
$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/sage-force-relocate.txt
```
