Before:

625 loops, best of 3: 2.09 µs per loop
sage: %timeit number_of_partitions(10^3)
625 loops, best of 3: 197 µs per loop
sage: %timeit number_of_partitions(10^6)
25 loops, best of 3: 32.8 ms per loop
sage: %time number_of_partitions(10^9); 
CPU times: user 37.92 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 37.92 s
Wall time: 37.93 s
```

After:

```
sage: %timeit number_of_partitions(1)
625 loops, best of 3: 1.94 µs per loop
sage: %timeit number_of_partitions(10^3)
625 loops, best of 3: 51.4 µs per loop

CPU times: user 0.47 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.47 s
Wall time: 0.48 s

TODO: should add a 64-bit only test to check that evaluation works with n >= 2^32.

I am happy to review this, although it is not clear to me what the status of #12173 is and until this patch is merged it seems rather cumbersome to load the current patch on top of #12173 in order play around with this patch and check to see that it actually works.

Assuming that it is OK, I would like to see some more explicit tests inside the new number_of_partitions to show that it is working. I'd suggest simply reusing the ones that are in sage.combinat.partition.number_of_partitions. That is, adding the following tests to the doc-string for your number_of_partitions:

```
        sage: from sage.combinat.partitions import number_of_partitions
        sage: number_of_partitions(3)
        3
        sage: number_of_partitions(10)
        42
        sage: number_of_partitions(40)
        37338
        sage: number_of_partitions(100)
        190569292

Here's a review patch which should fix the problem, which was the Bober's implementation was cached (since it was the default). I changed this to the FLINT.

```
sage -t ../misc/cachefunc.pyx
    [593 tests, 78.50 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 79.6 seconds
    cpu time: 8.1 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 78.5 seconds
```
I also added the additional tests Andrew wanted and fixed the docstrings.
