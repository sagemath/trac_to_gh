I am happy to review this, although it is not clear to me what the status of #12173 is and until this patch is merged it seems rather cumbersome to load the current patch on top of #12173 in order play around with this patch and check to see that it actually works.

Assuming that it is OK, I would like to see some more explicit tests inside the new number_of_partitions to show that it is working. I'd suggest simply reusing the ones that are in sage.combinat.partition.number_of_partitions. That is, adding the following tests to the doc-string for your number_of_partitions:

```
        sage: from sage.combinat.partitions import number_of_partitions
        sage: number_of_partitions(3)
        3
        sage: number_of_partitions(10)
        42
        sage: number_of_partitions(40)
        37338
        sage: number_of_partitions(100)
        190569292
        sage: number_of_partitions(100000)

Here's a review patch which should fix the problem, which was the Bober's implementation was cached (since it was the default). I changed this to the FLINT.

```
sage -t ../misc/cachefunc.pyx
    [593 tests, 78.50 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 79.6 seconds
    cpu time: 8.1 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 78.5 seconds
```
I also added the additional tests Andrew wanted and fixed the docstrings.

For patchbot:

Apply: trac_13199_flint_partition_function_v2.patch, trac_13199-flint_partition-review-ts.patch
