<a id='comment:2'></a>I am happy to review this, although it is not clear to me what the status of #12173 is and until this patch is merged it seems rather cumbersome to load the current patch on top of #12173 in order play around with this patch and check to see that it actually works.

Assuming that it is OK, I would like to see some more explicit tests inside the new number_of_partitions to show that it is working. I'd suggest simply reusing the ones that are in sage.combinat.partition.number_of_partitions. That is, adding the following tests to the doc-string for your number_of_partitions:

```
        sage: from sage.combinat.partitions import number_of_partitions
        sage: number_of_partitions(3)
        3
        sage: number_of_partitions(10)
        42
        sage: number_of_partitions(40)
        37338
        sage: number_of_partitions(100)
