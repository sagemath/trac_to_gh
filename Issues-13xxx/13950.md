Looks good to me!

The non-ascii plugin causes lots of false positives. It is fine to use non-ascii in thedocumentation if the correct coding was specified in the file. While non-ascii in the actual code would be wrong, of course. Though that can't be checked by looking at the patch only, but requires some actual understanding of the code...

I am mystified. Here's the log

http://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/0/Fedora/18/x86_64/3.7.2-201.fc18.x86_64/volker-desktop.stp.dias.ie/2013-01-15%2023:18:53%20+0000?plugin=plugins.startup_time

The timings are right there (and I even ignore the top 15, but that doesn't impact the results much here as there's little warm-up needed).

What the patchbot did is

```
for k in range(10):
    os.system("sage -b 0")
    for n in range(8):
        os.system("sage -c ''")
```

and, with a high statistical significance, it took longer when k was even then when k was odd. Unless I'm completely off on the math here...

Any ideas?

The even/odd values of k are main vs ticket?

```
Main:   0.65512 sec (25 samples, std_dev=0.00494)
Ticket: 0.65906 sec (25 samples, std_dev=0.00382)
```

```
With 70% confidence, startup time increased by at least 0.5%
With 75% confidence, startup time increased by at least 0.47%
With 90% confidence, startup time increased by at least 0.36%
With 95% confidence, startup time increased by at least 0.29%

I'm a bit confused here. You can't be 100% sure that the startup time increased at all. Which statistical test is going on? (Yes I could read the source ;-)

Really, what we're trying to do is estimate the minimum startup time, and cut out the possibility of some short-term activity messing up the timings. I'm open for other suggestions. 

> Also, I was using the computer at the time and its possible that I did something that was periodic with the frequency of the tests. E.g. click on web links in a ~5 second rhythm. In other words, I'm not sure that it is valid to treat the samples as statistically independent. Its probably better to randomize which test counts as main and ticket for the startup.

I'd think it'd already be randomized based on when the test starts. I alternate back and forth to try to eliminate any bias, but I suppose this won't catch something periodic.

Argh, found the error: https://github.com/robertwb/sage-patchbot/blob/master/src/plugins.py#L244 I should be using variance, not standard deviation.  I'm using Welch's t-test (well, actually computing various confidence intervals around the observed mean.)

Thanks for taking a deeper look at this. Wonder why it never tripped up on my computer. Now I just hope we're doing enough samples to ever detect anything...

Welch t-test is appropriate, but I don't think this is right:

```
err = math.sqrt(s1**2 * (n1-1) / n1 + s2**2 * (n2-1) / n2)
```
The t-value should asymptotically be proportional to sqrt(n), so that more samples = more certain that the observed difference is actual effect (if sample means and stddevs remain unchanged).
