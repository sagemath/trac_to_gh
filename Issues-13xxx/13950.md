I am mystified. Here's the log

http://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/0/Fedora/18/x86_64/3.7.2-201.fc18.x86_64/volker-desktop.stp.dias.ie/2013-01-15%2023:18:53%20+0000?plugin=plugins.startup_time

The timings are right there (and I even ignore the top 15, but that doesn't impact the results much here as there's little warm-up needed).

What the patchbot did is

```
for k in range(10):
    os.system("sage -b 0")
    for n in range(8):
        os.system("sage -c ''")
```

and, with a high statistical significance, it took longer when k was even then when k was odd. Unless I'm completely off on the math here...

Any ideas?

Really, what we're trying to do is estimate the minimum startup time, and cut out the possibility of some short-term activity messing up the timings. I'm open for other suggestions.

I'd think it'd already be randomized based on when the test starts. I alternate back and forth to try to eliminate any bias, but I suppose this won't catch something periodic.

Argh, found the error: https://github.com/robertwb/sage-patchbot/blob/master/src/plugins.py#L244 I should be using variance, not standard deviation.  I'm using Welch's t-test (well, actually computing various confidence intervals around the observed mean.)

Thanks for taking a deeper look at this. Wonder why it never tripped up on my computer. Now I just hope we're doing enough samples to ever detect anything...

Welch t-test is appropriate, but I don't think this is right:

```
err = math.sqrt(s1**2 * (n1-1) / n1 + s2**2 * (n2-1) / n2)
```
The t-value should asymptotically be proportional to sqrt(n), so that more samples = more certain that the observed difference is actual effect (if sample means and stddevs remain unchanged).
