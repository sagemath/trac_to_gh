Ticket #12615 is a dependency, you need to apply that first. 

I can't think of any standard efficiency tests, but this is most useful when creating a large number of small Sage integers. For example, 

Before:

```
sage: sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a')             
sage: sage: v = E.anlist(10000, python_ints=True)
sage: sage: %timeit [ZZ(a) for a in v]           
25 loops, best of 3: 15.5 ms per loop
```

After:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a')             
sage: v = E.anlist(10000, python_ints=True)
sage: %timeit [ZZ(a) for a in v]           
25 loops, best of 3: 12.8 ms per loop
```

It'll be faster elsewhere, but it's mostly a tiny improvement all over the place. Startup time may also be slightly improved (despite initializing the pool). The most important is to review the code for correctness (and of course verify the tests pass).

[Hmm, there was a typo in the branch name, sorry for that.]

Replying to [@zimmermann6](#comment:16):
> sorry with the change to git I don't know how to review that ticket (and no time currently to learn how to)

I think all that remains to do is for someone to have a look at my patch (https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/9ab4bd04dfac93d95c7b169be62a3054f2eef850).

If you want to test it:
* checkout the corresponding branch (using something like `git checkout trac/u/mmezzarobba/13981-small_int`);
* optionally, merge in the main development branch (`git merge develop`);
* rebuild sage, test;
* use `git checkout master` or `git checkout develop` to go back to the mainline when you are done.

I confirm the speedup on my machine.

Vanilla 6.0:

```
sage: sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a')    
sage: v = E.anlist(10000, python_ints=True)
sage: %timeit [ZZ(a) for a in v]       
100 loops, best of 3: 15.3 ms per loop
```

With the patch applied:

```
sage: sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a')    
sage: v = E.anlist(10000, python_ints=True)
sage: %timeit [ZZ(a) for a in v]       
100 loops, best of 3: 13.2 ms per loop
```
