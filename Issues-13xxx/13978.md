"java -version" does not work for me unless I increase virtual memory limit above 4Gb.

The permission issue is with references to files which are stored in server directories closed to everybody except for the server. Trying to manually set group access bits does not help - they are reset on cell reexecution. I don't think there is anything wrong with jmol here and memory issue, while annoying, can be lived with. But permission errors don't go away even after using [Jason's patch](https://gist.github.com/3527075#file-patch-to-sagenb-patch) to make plots interactive by default (I see the plots and they are interactive, but somewhere there is still access to restricted files generating errors). I do not think it is related to browser security.
