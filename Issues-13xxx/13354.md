A bunch of spkg using autotools do not build shared libraries of Cygwin because -no-undefined flag is not passed to libtool:

* libfplll (see #13804 for a quick (different problem) fix and #12835 for the fact we ship a really old version, should update it before thinking about the problem here, fixed in new upstream version 4.0.3),

MPFI is fixed upstream, see:
https://gforge.inria.fr/scm/viewvc.php?view=rev&root=mpfi&revision=656

Givaro is fixed upstream:
https://forge.imag.fr/scm/browser.php?group_id=187

I'm working on lrcalc as now Sage is more or less upstream.
(I guess IML will be the same.)

And I'll provide quickly a patch for upstream ECM and it should get merged.

Feedback from fplll which I guess will be fixed in a couple of weeks in the new version (so we'll have to update to get a shared library).

Feedback from GSL and GLPK as well.

No feedback from LinBox yet.
