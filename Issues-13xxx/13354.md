A bunch of spkg using autotools do not build shared libraries of Cygwin because -no-undefined flag is not passed to libtool:
* cddlib (update in #13026, we ship a lot of patches for that one, so if I report upstream for that particular issue, what for the others? opened #15872),
* eclib (fixed in #13325 with new upstream version),

* givaro (updated in #9511 and #13164, try http://www.infres.enst.fr/~flori/sage/givaro-3.7.1.p0.spkg, reported upstream, got in, see https://forge.imag.fr/scm/browser.php?group_id=187),

* libfplll (see #13804 for a quick (different problem) fix and #12835 for the fact we ship a really old version, should update it before thinking about the problem here, fixed in new upstream version 4.0.3),
* linbox (updated in #12883, try http://www.infres.enst.fr/~flori/sage/linbox-1.3.2.p0.spkg, reported upstream, fixed, see https://groups.google.com/d/topic/linbox-devel/sHan2BB8HVM/discussion),
* lrcalc (fixed in #13839 which should be half upstream),
* mpfi (fixed upstream, see https://gforge.inria.fr/scm/viewvc.php?view=rev&root=mpfi&revision=656),
* ntl (broken and fixed in #11635, no real upstream anymore as far as I understand, in fact Shoup is working on NTL again and I've made him aware of that),
* libgap (guess we are more or less upstream, see #14038)
* gf2x (fixed in #15014, reported upstream, I'll provide a proper fix when I have time)

<a id='comment:16'></a>MPFI is fixed upstream, see:

Givaro is fixed upstream:
https://forge.imag.fr/scm/browser.php?group_id=187

I'm working on lrcalc as now Sage is more or less upstream.
(I guess IML will be the same.)

And I'll provide quickly a patch for upstream ECM and it should get merged.

Feedback from fplll which I guess will be fixed in a couple of weeks in the new version (so we'll have to update to get a shared library).

Feedback from GSL and GLPK as well.

No feedback from LinBox yet.
