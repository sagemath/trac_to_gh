We want to fix the following error on sage 5.4. Given the input

```
sage: p = disk((0,0), 5, (0, pi/4), color='red')
sage: p += disk((0,0), 5, (pi/4, pi/2), color='red', alpha=0.5)
sage: p.save("test.pdf")

```
we get the error

```
TypeError: Don't know a PDF representation for <type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral'> objects.

```

This can be fixed in the backend quite easily.

**Note:** The problem appears to occur only in `disk()`. In fact, it's clear that someone manually fixed this for other objects earlier, or else programmed it correctly and overlooked `disk()`. The patch fixes the problem in a way that is consistent with the other approaches.

Fixing it in the backend was easy, though the fix was strongly discommended, so I applied a different fix, which was fairly easy. I added a very simple doctest to each modified file.

I have a feeling there's a better way to do this; after all, the same bug doesn't show up when decimals are used for coordinates, etc. However, this works for now.

Hi, nice start!  Very comprehensive.  Here are some comments, some of which make it "needs work".
* I think the preferred syntax is `if alpha is not None`.

```

In [12]: % timeit D is not None
10000000 loops, best of 3: 43.8 ns per loop

In [13]: % timeit D != None
10000000 loops, best of 3: 65.1 ns per loop

```

Oh, wow. I'll take care of that.

Ack. I'd had so many problems with alpha that I just assumed saving it wouldn't work on anything. Still, that makes sense, considering that coordinates don't raise objections from matplotlib.

Alright; I'll look for that.

I thought there was something, but I couldn't remember it, and I figured that someone would correct me if so. Bingo. :-D

Okay, I'll get to work fixing this now.

**NEEDS REVIEW**

It looks like you forgot to change the status to "needs work", so I will leave it as "needs review" ;-)

It turns out that **all** the other files I had worked on were okay. That gave me the idea to look at how `arc()` handles the same problems, since it also accepts the `alpha` keyword. By mimicking that solution (which also showed me why the coordinates don't raise the same error), I avoided the whole `!= None` problem.

To be honest, it looks as if someone either noticed this problem before & tried to fix it, remembering everything except `disk()`. Here I was thinking I was making a great contribution, when in fact I was just cleaning up behind someone else. I'll go weep into some hot tea. ;-)

By the way, I hope you're not too snowed in, way up there in New England.

Excellent.  I'm sure that I've seen all this before, too, and didn't recognize it.  That's the problem with viewing patches and not the whole code.

I suppose one could run into trouble anyway, if one used the `Disk` primitive and called this method, but that's not intended use and it's pervasive in the code, so it would be another ticket, if even worth opening.

You may want to fix the commit line.

Oh yes.  Took over two hours to shovel all the way out to where the plows "created" the street so the car is ready to get out - though now church is cancelled due to lack of parking, so I guess tomorrow is another day at home.

I've fixed that commit message now (& I'll also change the ticket description to match the problem more accurately).

Only in the paper? You must not watch CNN! :-)

They're saying it was an EF-3. The southern edge of campus was ripped up but good: several buildings were damaged, one severely, and one apparently destroyed. So far, there are no reports of serious injuries, which strikes me as a miracle.

I get the same error in Sage 5.9 with:

```
sage: f = lambda x, y : (abs(cos((x + I * y) ** 4)) - 1) 
sage: g2 = implicit_plot(f,(-4, 4),(-3, 3),linewidth=0.6)
sage: g2.save('/tmp/cosz4_2.pdf')
TypeError: Don't know a PDF representation for <type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral'> objects.
```
Replacing `0.6` by `float(0.6)` solves the problem. Should I reopen or open a new ticket?

I think it needs a new ticket, for two reasons.

1. It has to do with coordinates, not `alpha`. You might want to see if `alpha` works with `implicit_plot()`, but...
2. The fix given here for `disk()` really does fix `disk()`.
