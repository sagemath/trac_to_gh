We plan to revamp the development workflow for Sage, involving a few separate (big) changes:

* switch to gitÂ 
* consolidate our repositories into a single repository
* simplified development interface

We break down the steps needed for this transition in the following tasks/tickets:

* #14480 - switch to new directory layout and update build system
* #14481 - write a new developer manual; see https://github.com/sagemath/git-developer-guide
* #14482 - write development scripts
* Make sure the patchbot works with the new layout (this seems to be okay).
* Make sure the buildbot works with the new layout (VB: works now)
* #14962 - Make sure optional spkgs work with the new layout.
* #15241 - ignore various temporary files
* #15222 - `make download` to download all tarballs
* #15221 - always rebuild packages if the version number changes
* #15401 - Build git without gettext if necessary
* #15420 - Borken git doctests.
* #15430 - Enable cython caching
* #15436 - Cksum uses tabs instead of spaces, breaking sage-spkg's regex
* #15458 - "make distclean" fails on Solaris
* #15465 - Allow using Sage without git repository
* #15468 - update to latest upstream git
* #15469 - Symmetrica spkg-check fails due to whitespace
* #15472 - Fixes for the source tarball generation (sage -sdist)
* #14968 - Store actual tarball name in pkg metadata.
* #15517 - Run sage-upgrade *outside* of the Sage shell

Instructions for using the new workflow: [QuickStartSageGit](QuickStartSageGit)

 We plan to revamp the development workflow for Sage, involving a few separate (big) changes:
 
 * switch to gitÂ 
-  * switch to using commits and a history graph for collaboration rather than patch files
 * consolidate our repositories into a single repository
-  * main 4 repos for now, spkgs can be merged in one by one after we transition
 * simplified development interface
-* etc.
 
-Help develop scripts and other things related to this project at http://github.com/kini/sage-workflow . A significant portion of the work to transition to git can be done before we actually carry it out (without affecting how sage presently functions). For these portions, we are making tickets and adding them as dependencies.
+We break down the steps needed for this transition in the following tasks/tickets:
 
-Related tickets:
+* #14480, #14954 - switch to new directory layout and update build system
+* #14481 - write a new developer manual; see https://github.com/sagemath/git-developer-guide
+* #14482 - write development scripts
+* Make sure the patchbot works with the new layout (this seems to be okay).
+* Make sure the buildbot works with the new layout.
+* #14962 - Make sure optional spkgs work with the new layout.
+* Advertise to sage-devel so that people can try it out before the final transition.
 
-* #13025 and its subtickets, to clean up some SPKGs
-* #13190 and #13201, switch sage library to setuptools and allow for parallel easy_installs
