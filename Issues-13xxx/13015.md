We plan to revamp the development workflow for Sage, involving a few separate (big) changes:

* switch to git 
* consolidate our repositories into a single repository
* simplified development interface

We break down the steps needed for this transition in the following tasks/tickets:

* #14480 - switch to new directory layout and update build system
* #14481 - write a new developer manual; see https://github.com/sagemath/git-developer-guide
* #14482 - write development scripts
* Make sure the patchbot works with the new layout (this seems to be okay).
* Make sure the buildbot works with the new layout (VB: works now)
* #14962 - Make sure optional spkgs work with the new layout.
* #15241 - ignore various temporary files
* #15222 - `make download` to download all tarballs
* #15221 - always rebuild packages if the version number changes
* #15401 - Build git without gettext if necessary
* #15420 - Borken git doctests.
* #15430 - Enable cython caching
* #15436 - Cksum uses tabs instead of spaces, breaking sage-spkg's regex
* #15458 - "make distclean" fails on Solaris
* #15465 - Allow using Sage without git repository
* #15468 - update to latest upstream git
* #15469 - Symmetrica spkg-check fails due to whitespace
* #15472 - Fixes for the source tarball generation (sage -sdist)
* #14968 - Store actual tarball name in pkg metadata.
* #15517 - Run sage-upgrade *outside* of the Sage shell

Instructions for using the new workflow: [QuickStartSageGit](QuickStartSageGit)

+* #15241 - ignore various temporary files
+* #15222 - \`make download\` to download all tarballs

+We plan to revamp the development workflow for Sage, involving a few separate (big) changes:
 
+* switch to git 
+* consolidate our repositories into a single repository
+* simplified development interface
+
+We break down the steps needed for this transition in the following tasks/tickets:
+
+* #14480 - switch to new directory layout and update build system
+* #14481 - write a new developer manual; see https://github.com/sagemath/git-developer-guide
+* #14482 - write development scripts
+* Make sure the patchbot works with the new layout (this seems to be okay).
+* Make sure the buildbot works with the new layout (VB: works now)
+* #14962 - Make sure optional spkgs work with the new layout.
+* #15241 - ignore various temporary files
+* #15222 - \`make download\` to download all tarballs
+* #15221 - always rebuild packages if the version number changes
+* #15401 - Build git without gettext if necessary
+* #15420 - Borken git doctests.
+* #15430 - Enable cython caching
+* #15436 - Cksum uses tabs instead of spaces, breaking sage-spkg's regex
+* #15458 - "make distclean" fails on Solaris
+* #15465 - Allow using Sage without git repository
+* #15468 - update to latest upstream git
+* #15469 - Symmetrica spkg-check fails due to whitespace
+* #15472 - Fixes for the source tarball generation (sage -sdist)
+* #14968 - Store actual tarball name in pkg metadata.
+* #15517 - Run sage-upgrade *outside* of the Sage shell
+
+Instructions for using the new workflow: [QuickStartSageGit](QuickStartSageGit)
