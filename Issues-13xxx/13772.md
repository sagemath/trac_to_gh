Sometimes user's initial_guess can lead to fractional power of a negative number on some substituted independent variable from "data" variable.

It happend to me, when I wanted calculate diode's parameters. I know approximate diode parameters and I pass them as initial_guess, but get error. Of course, I can try to select other values until ending of errors, but it isn't cool.

Simple code to illustrate:

```python
def f(x, q):
    return sqrt(x - q)

var('q')
a = [[5, 2], [10, 3], [17, 4], [26, 5]] # it's y = sqrt(x - 1)
M = Matrix(a)
five = 4.9999999 # Calculated normally, solution ~= 1
#five = 4.99999999 # Fails
find_fit(M, f, parameters = [q], variables = [x], initial_guess = [five])

# this works correctly with the same initial guesses, when it fails, it returns initial guess as a result
model(x) = sqrt(x - q)
find_fit(M, model, initial_guess = [5])
```
