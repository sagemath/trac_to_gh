Seems to be a problem for digraphs also.

```
sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(4)
sage: G.all_paths(2,2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

For this trivial situation, there is no "previous" iterator.  We could immediately return the trivial answer, or catch the exception, or place an empty iterator on the list.
