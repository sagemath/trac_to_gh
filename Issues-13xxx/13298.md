Attachment: **[trac_13298-elliptic-curve.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13298/trac_13298-elliptic-curve.patch.gz)**

Without the patch there's one test which will fail if the optional database is installed since it relies on a curve of conductor 10001 not being in the database.  I replaced it by one of conductor `>10^8`.
