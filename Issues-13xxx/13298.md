Since there is a (1/p) calculation in the Cython file, if p is a python integer, that (1/p) is 0 (since 1 is also a python integer).

This fix is to make the 1 in 1/p actually a Sage integer, which does the right thing.  The 1 is cached at the module level.

Example of wrong behavior:

```
sage: v = vector(QQ, [1,2])
sage: v.norm(int(2))
1
```

**Apply:**

```

By the way, this also seems to speed up the norm calculation too:

Before:

```
sage: sage: v=vector((1.71964708011116, 1.94742583018281))
sage: sage: timeit('v.norm(2)')
625 loops, best of 3: 66.9 µs per loop
sage: sage: timeit('v.norm(int(2))')
625 loops, best of 3: 39.6 µs per loop
```

After

```
sage: v=vector((1.71964708011116, 1.94742583018281))
sage: timeit('v.norm(2)')
625 loops, best of 3: 64.6 µs per loop
sage: timeit('v.norm(int(2))')
625 loops, best of 3: 31.7 µs per loop
```

How about having a Trac number in the relevant doctest?
