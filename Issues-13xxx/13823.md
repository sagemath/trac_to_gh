Not sure, which of the two links would be more helpful (or perhaps, we should add both of them). 

Arguments for [this one](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/tutorial.html#magic-functions), number this (1): 

1. Sort of an introduction to magic functions. 
2. Lists all magic functions and hence more helpful for a beginner. 

Arguments for [this one](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/reference.html#magic-command-system), number this (2): 

1. The automagic is illustrated with an example. 
2. Explains how to define your own magics. 

So, I'll change this to "needs info" for now. :)

Both, then.

Incidentally, this would need changing on ALL tutorial translations, presumably...

I wish one could go back to "new" from "needs info".  Grr.

Actually, from the doctests, I think, the part affected by this patch is not translated into any other language. Am I right about that? ;-)

That's unfortunate, but true.

Anyway, this is now fine.
