I noticed:

```
        Uses Heilbronn-Cremonma matrices of `p` is prime, else use
        Heilbronn-Merel matrices.
```
It should be "if `p` is prime" not "of `p` is prime".

We should probably also correct the other typo in that sentence ("Cremonma"). The patchbot seems unhappy, but I can't believe that the failure has anything to do with your patch!
