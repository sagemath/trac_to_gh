I noticed:

```
        Uses Heilbronn-Cremonma matrices of `p` is prime, else use
        Heilbronn-Merel matrices.
```
It should be "if `p` is prime" not "of `p` is prime".

We should probably also correct the other typo in that sentence ("Cremonma"). The patchbot seems unhappy, but I can't believe that the failure has anything to do with your patch!

I cannot reproduce this. With `mercurial` on Archlinux I get

```
$ hg qimport -P https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13837/trac_13837.patch
Füge trac_13837.patch zur Seriendatei hinzu
Wende trac_13837.patch an
jetzt bei: trac_13837.patch
```

Why hasn't this happened with other patches of mine, for example that one attached to #13815?
Any suggestions how to fix this?
