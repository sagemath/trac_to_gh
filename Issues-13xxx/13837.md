```
I noticed:

```
        Uses Heilbronn-Cremonma matrices of `p` is prime, else use
        Heilbronn-Merel matrices.
```
It should be "if `p` is prime" not "of `p` is prime".

Why hasn't this happened with other patches of mine, for example that one attached to #13815?
Any suggestions how to fix this?
