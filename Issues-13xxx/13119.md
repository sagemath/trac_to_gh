a potential defect in ._apply_module_morphism function calls list( self.basis().keys() ) when self.is_zero() is True.  This works fine if self.basis() is a finite set, but causes a problem if self.basis() is an infinite set with an iteration function.   In this case, the function hangs trying to list the infinite set.

Hey Mike,

Two minor things:
- Could you use the auto-linking <code>:func:\`on_basis\`</code> in the docstring?
- Since at some point, there is a shift to Python 3, I think we should start using that syntax:

```
raise ValueError('Codomain could not be determined')
```
Looks good to me otherwise.

Thanks,

Travis
