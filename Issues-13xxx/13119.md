Hey Mike,

Two minor things:
- Could you use the auto-linking <code>:func:\`on_basis\`</code> in the docstring?
- Since at some point, there is a shift to Python 3, I think we should start using that syntax:

```
raise ValueError('Codomain could not be determined')
```
Looks good to me otherwise.

Thanks,

Travis
