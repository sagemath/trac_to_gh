Ooch. This patch implements a method with a nasty name. With this one can create  6-regular grids on the torus, and have some acceptable drawing.

It also modifies the embedding of ToroidalGrid2dGraph, as some edges did not appear on the drawing.

Hi Nathann,

I looked at the patch and found the modified layout of `ToroidalGrid2dGraph` better.

For a hexagonal grid graph, can you give some reference with the definition you are using? Your graph is 6-regular while several other definitions are 3-regular. For example, see article 1203.0666v1, section 5,  from arXiv.org, or [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HexagonalGrid.html](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HexagonalGrid.html). I am confused ;-)

Hello,

I was about to write a small review patch to add:
- a space between i and \in (same for j) since otherwise i and in are glued when asking for the doc of the function. 
- to write <code>\`((i+1)%n_1, (j+1)%n_2\`</code> so add (). 
But then I found a problem in the method as well as for `ToroidalGrid2dGraph`, `Grid2dGraph`, and certainly others: I'm able to call `graphs.Toroidal6RegularGrid2dGraph(-1,2)` without warnings! O_o

For which values of n1 and n2 are these methods defined? So far, I'm able to produce a graph that is not 6-regular.

David.
