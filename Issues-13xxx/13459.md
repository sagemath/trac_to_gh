When running Sage through IPython (but not through plain Python when running a script for example), the current working directory is always added to `sys.path` (the empty string is added as zeroth entry, which means the current working directory).  So when doing

```
import sage    # or sage.foo.bar....
```
the *current working directory* will be checked first for the existence of a "sage" module.  If the current working directory happens to be `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage`, that contains a "sage" subdirectory which Python will happily import.  But this is the wrong directory, it should be imported from `site-packages` instead.  This creates problems for Cython modules, as these exist *only* in `site-packages`.

So we avoid this problem by first fixing `sys.path`, then importing Sage so any future imports of Sage submodules will work fine.
