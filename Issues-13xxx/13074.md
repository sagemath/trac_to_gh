Implements (standard) tableaux of shape a PartitionTuple. That is, tableau with shape a tuple of partitions, together with standard functions for these objects. These objects arise naturally in algebraic combinatorics, such as in the representation theory of the cyclotomic Hecke algebras of type G(r,1,n) and (hence) in the categorification of the irreducible highest weight representations (and their canonical bases) of the (quantum) affine special linear groups.

This patch implements TableauTuples and StandardTableauTuples and basic methods for them. The idea is that these classes should naturally extend the corresponding Tableaux classes, which are in bijection with 1-tuples of tableaux. As with PartitionTuples, the TableauTuple classes return honest Tableaux  whilst still recognising them as being TableauTuples. Both Tableaux and TableauTuples classes have a component() method which returns the list of components which allows loops such as

```
for s in t.components():
  do X
```
where t is a TableauTuple (or Tableau). With this modification is it possible to write code which will behave the same for both classes. Whenever they were meaningful, I have implemented existing functions for tableaux for the tableau tuples. For example, there are iterators for StandardTableauTuples, you can conjugate TableauTuples, take their shape and size, compute words, act on them, ...

The patch implements the following classes:

* TableauTuples
* TableauTuples_all
* TableauTuples_level
* TableauTuples_size
* TableauTuples_level_size
* StandardTableauTuples
* StandardTableauTuples_all
* StandardTableauTuples_level
* StandardTableauTuples_size
* StandardTableauTuples_level_size
* StandardTableauTuples_shape

Hi Andrews,

First of all, many thanks form implementing tuple of tableaux. This is
definitely a useful addition to Sage.

I didn't try to review your patch, but, when compiling the doc on
Sage-Combinat queue, I noticed a bunch of warning from your file. Looking
shortly at the patch, there is indeed many problems. You should to try to
compile the doc with

```
sage -docbuild reference html
```
and then look into you browser to the compiled files. A few years ago, I wrote
a page on the wiki to help writing the doc. It is at

```
http://wiki.sagemath.org/combinat/HelpOnTheDoc
```
Maybe it could help you. Also, be warned that it may be outdated.

Cheers,

Florent

Hi Florent,

I accept that there are warnings when you build the documentation but I don't see any errors in either the python source or in the html output. As you said that you can see many errors in the doc strings in the patch, could you please point out a few of them so that I know what to look for? Otherwise I will waste a lot of time on this.

There doesn't seem to be any documentation on trouble shooting the documentation and, unfortunately,  the warnings produced when compiling the documentation do not seem to be that helpful. For example, my patch produces the following warnings in partition.py

```
/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.3/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/partition.py:docstring of sage.combinat.partition:13: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.3/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/partition.py:docstring of sage.combinat.partition:18: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.3/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/partition.py:docstring of sage.combinat.partition:23: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.3/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/partition.py:docstring of sage.combinat.partition:28: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
```
However, when I look at lines 13, 18, 23 and 28 of partition.py I don't see anything wrong -- and indeed, my patch does not appear to touch these lines (but these warning do not appear before my patch is applied...). 

Presumably the line numbers above are not literal line numbers inside the file, and instead they are just relative line numbers in particular doc-strings, but I do not see how to find which doc strings the warnings refer to. Any hints that you can give would be much appreciated!

Andrew

Hey Andrew,

Yes, those line numbers are not literal, I think they are some sort of offset from the start of methods which cause the problem. In short, the warnings are generally useless.

There's a fair amount of documentation that I feel needs to be tweaked, so I'll write a review patch with my proposed changes.

Best,

Travis

which does pass but which takes a really long time. I have changed the 12 to an 8 which completes fast enough to make the automatic test happy.

I thought that the whole point of the **#long time** tag is to allow for longer tests? If you like I can take it out but as it is marked with **#long time** my first preference would be to leave it in place.

Please advise.
