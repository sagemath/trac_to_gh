It would be great to have a matrices namespace to put special matrix commands, sort of like the:

- graphs.* namespace 
- groups.* namespace
- polytopes.* namespace

Here are some starter definitions:

```
def hilbert(R,n): return matrix(R, n, lambda i,j: 1/(i+j+1))
def vandermonde(R, v): return matrix(R, len(v), lambda i,j: v[i]^j)
def toeplitz(R,c,r): return matrix(R, len(c), len(r), lambda i,j: c[i-j] if i>=j else r[j-i])
def hankel(R,c,r): entries=c+r[1:]; return matrix(R, len(c), len(r), lambda i,j: entries[i+j])
def circulant(R, E): return toeplitz(R, E[0:1]+E[-1:0:-1], E)
def skew_circulant(R,E): return hankel(R, E, E[-1:]+E[:-1])

#Hadamard matrices:
def legendre_symbol(x):
    """Extend the built in legendre_symbol function to handle prime power fields.  Assume x is an element of a finite field as well"""
    if x==0: 
        return 0
    elif x.is_square(): 
        return 1
    else: 
        return -1

def jacobsthal(p,n):
    """See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paley_construction for a way to use jacobsthal matrices to construct hadamard matrices"""
     if n == 1:
        elts = GF(p).list()
    else:
        elts = GF(p^n,'a').list()
    return matrix(len(elts), lambda i,j: legendre_symbol(elts[i]-elts[j]))
def paley_matrix(p,n):
    """See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paley_construction"""
    mod = p^n%4
    if mod == 3:
        # Paley Type 1 construction
        ones = vector([1]*p^n)
        QplusI = jacobsthal(p,n)
        # Q+=I efficiently
        for i in range(p^n):
            QplusI[i,i]=-1
        return block_matrix(2,[
        [1,ones.row()],
        [ones.column(), QplusI]])
    elif mod == 1:
        # Paley Type 2 construction
        ones = vector([1]*p^n)
        QplusI = jacobsthal(p,n)
        QminusI = copy(QplusI)
        for i in range(p^n):
            QplusI[i,i]=1
            QminusI[i,i]=-1
        SplusI = block_matrix(2,[[1,ones.row()],[ones.column(), QplusI]])
        SminusI = block_matrix(2,[[-1,ones.row()], [ones.column(), QminusI]])
        return block_matrix(2,[[SplusI,SminusI],[SminusI,-SplusI]])        
    else:
        raise ValueError("p^n must be congruent to 1 or 3 mod 4")

}}

The matrixform patch below first implements a decorator to take care of an optional first argument of the ring, as well as an optional keyword argument of 'sparse'.  Then it implements most of these using that decorator, so the boilerplate code is abstracted away.

Additionally, we could use scipy to create more matrices (or do it ourselves): http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/linalg.html#special-matrices

I'd vote for implementing the new matrices on this ticket, making sure they build on the namespace/tab-completion decorator in #13678.  Just change the description slightly to speak of just the special matrices.

Note:  These could be named, e.g., `hilbert_matrix()`, and the `_matrix` part gets stripped put when found with tab-completion.

- added documentation and tests to hankel, vandermonde, toeplitz and hilbert
- using the approach from the 1st patch (matrix method) decorator, because it is more in line with the current `special.py`
- added the file `special.py` to the html reference, because it was not there at all
- added a table with the available constructions, in the same lines as with the polytopes library

it is missing to document and add doctests for the Paley construction. perhaps a person with a number theory background can continue that part.

this is related to documentation here but less important issue: since we are using the matrix method decorator, it adds the strings `This function is available as xxx(...) and matrix.xxx(...).`, although this is not true in general. it applies not only for this ticket; see for instance the help for `random_rref_matrix`.

> regarding `is available as xxx(...) and matrix.xxx(...)`, I think there is a consensus that nothing should be added to the global namespace, which is already quite full, rather, it should be pruned...


the `@matrix_method` decorator adds the possibility for tab-completion, hence `matrix.xxx` works. this is good. but it also adds a string to the inline help saying that 

```
...
prefix = "    This function is available as %s(...) and matrix.%s(...)." 
% (func.__name__, name
...
```
but the `%s(...)` is not true; it is only true if the function is included in `all.py`. 

i was not proposing to add anything to `all.py`, just that someone revises and eventually confirms that this prefix to the docstring is false and should be fixed (or not).

propose to do the computation by accessing directly to the elements (as in the other cases). this way without type checking we are a little more robust in the sense that it accepts both lists and vectors. it is mathematically equivalent. 

there is a price to pay indeed if we use a lambda function instead of straightforward concatenation of lists,  but i judge "small" (~30ms for a 300x600 hankel matrix).  

in sage there are indeed a couple of docstrings which explicitly say "vector or list" (or "list or vector") as a search shows, eg. setting rows/cols in a matrix, or a polyhedral fan. in our case i'm just keeping the word "vector"..

ok. square by default is:

```
def hankel(c, r=None):

    m = len(c)
    if r is not None:
        n = len(r)
        entries = lambda i: c[i] if i < m else r[i-m+1]
    else:
        n = len(c)
        entries = lambda i: c[i] if i < m else c[i-m+1]
    return matrix(lambda i,j: entries(i+j), nrows=m, ncols=n)
```

i don't have any particular opinion about allowing rectangular matrices as optional, or removing it altogether. 

notice that the original code was like that, and there a similar Matlab command: `hankel(c, r)`.

OK, at least now I understand the rule implemented easily. But why is this chosen?

Would it be more natural to just 
ignore the "conflict" thing completely and assume that the
the 2nd argument is the last row without the 1st entry?
This way the users do not even need to know the last entry of the 1st column to
have full control over the matrix they create. E.g., in the present design
one can have a match by accident, resulting in an wrong matrix. 
In the design I propose the user does not need to worry about this.

sorry i didnt't follow the suggestion; do you mean at the docstring level?
(e.g. `conflict -> ignore`? that sounds good) if it's in the code could you reformulate please? maybe an example would help.

In the branch implementation of`hankel(a,b)`, the 1st entry of `b`, i.e. `b[0]` is always ignored. While this is what Matlab does (Mathematica too, and Mathematica [documentation](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/HankelMatrix.html) requires the last entry of `a` to be equal to the 1st entry of `b`), it is ugly and illogical.

I propose that `hankel(a,b)` should do the same what `hankel(a,[None]+b)` does in the implementation on the branch.

Same applies to `toeplitz()` - it suffers from the same inconsistency.

no worries, i'm here to learn.

if instead of the code in the branch one has:

```
sage: r = c if r is None else list(r)
sage: n = len(r)
sage: entries = lambda i: c[i] if i < m else r[i-m]
sage: return matrix(lambda i,j: entries(i+j), nrows=m, ncols=n+1, ring=ring)
```

then the behaviour when r is not given does change (of course the matrix is no longer square):

```
Failed example:
    matrix.hankel([1..3])
Expected:

    [1 2 3]
    [2 3 2]
    [3 2 3]
Got:
    [1 2 3 1]
    [2 3 1 2]
    [3 1 2 3]
```

i think this was the reason i kept the None. 

however and in relation to your newer comment, i understand correctly, you've suggested to have this:

```
sage: r = c[1:] if r is None else list(r)
sage: n = len(r)
sage: entries = lambda i: c[i] if i < m else r[i-m]
sage: return matrix(lambda i,j: entries(i+j), nrows=m, ncols=n+1, ring=ring)
``` 

in this situation, all current tests pass.

<a id='comment:53'></a>
*To summarize:* 

the current behaviour for `hankel(c)` is the same as in matlab and mathematica. for example,

```
sage: matrix.hankel([1, 2, 3, 4])

[1 2 3 4]
[2 3 4 0]
[3 4 0 0]
[4 0 0 0]

sage: matlab('hankel([1, 2, 3, 4])')

1     2     3     4
2     3     4     0
3     4     0     0
4     0     0     0
```

however, if row and column are passed all the data in the row is considered:

```
sage: matrix.hankel([1, 2, 3], [7, 8, 9, 10])

[ 1  2  3  7  8]
[ 2  3  7  8  9]
[ 3  7  8  9 10]
```

while:

```
sage: matlab('hankel([1, 2, 3], [7, 8, 9, 10])')

1     2     3     8
2     3     8     9
3     8     9    10
```
