The attached one-line patch (plus doctests) fixes a small bug in multiplication in the Steenrod algebra. It should be easy to review even if you don't know anything about the Steenrod algebra; the code should have defined "F" to be "GF(p)", but it didn't, so "F" is not defined, so it causes an error.

I haven't check whether your doc test is correct. Anyway all tests passed. So I give this a positive review.
