The following LiveCD/USB (also installers) are available. The website download section can be adjusted to reflect these and in what situation they are appropriate

1) Thierry Monteil's distro based on debian live

2) Jan Groenewald's distros based on Ubuntu (with sage compiled, or with sage source and dev tools, future updates of both source and binary versions for networked machines from a Launchpad PPA; allows English or French install without internet connection)

3) Emil Widmann's SAGE Live CD distro based on Puppy Linux (smallest image?)

and

4) the Fedora based image of Volker Braun to provide the base for the Sage virtual machine, this is maybe not geared toward a Live CD/or USB

I hope this will not be too confusing ;-)
Right now, there is just one "Live CD" section on the mirror: http://sagemath.org/mirror/
My suggestion would be to find a maybe better name for 1-3 and make them sub-points in this overview, because listing them in the same directory is likely too confusing. I'm also not sure if we should make !#4 too prominent, I think it's better to host it on boxen and add a link to it in the description of the actual vm-image.

Hi,

i started a wiki page with the informations given on the sage-devel mailing-list : http://wiki.sagemath.org/SageLiveUSB

A simple possibility for names could be :
- sage debian live
- sage puppy live
- sage ubuntu live
- sage fedora live (if exists)

The download pages include a "live usb" page:

- https://www.sagemath.org/download-liveusb.html

from where one can download Sage Debian Live.

Sage Puppy Live has fallen out of maintenance.

Sage Ubuntu Live, developed at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, may still be distributed within the AIMS network; not sure it has a page.

I agree this ticket can be considered resolved.
