I think the documentation of various parts of `QuadraticForm()` ought to be improved: one needs to explicitly define the order on monomials used in `coeffs()` (and `monomials()`).
Somehow, `coeffs()`'s docs still talk about binary forms --- is it a leftover from the previous version?

As well, what about an alias `coefficients()` for `coeffs()` ?
