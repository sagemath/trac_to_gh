apparently, PARI ungracefully runs out of memory on the following:

```
sage: e= elliptic_curves.rank(8)[0]
sage: e.analytic_rank(algorithm='rubinstein')
  ***   Warning: not enough memory, new stack 18446744073268923520.
...[lots of similar lines removed]
  ***   Warning: not enough memory, new stack 17179869183.
  ***   Warning:   ***   bug in PARI/GP (Segmentation Fault), please report
  ***   bug in PARI/GP (Segmentation Fault), please report
...[lots of similar lines removed]
```
certainly, this is a difficult elliptic curve to deal with, but still, segfault is a segfault. See the related
[sage-devel discussion](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.devel/62488).

As I said on sage-devel, this computation will require a very large number of L-series coefficients, so this does not surprise me.  I think that the only sensible way out is for the analytic rank function to quit gracefully for curve like this.
