```
A semimonomial group over a ring `R` of length `n` is equal to the semidirect product of the monomial group and the group of ring automorphisms. The multiplication of two elements `(\phi, \pi, \alpha)(\psi, \sigma, \beta)` with

* `\phi, \psi \in  {R<sup>*}</sup>n`
* `\pi, \sigma \in S_n`
* `\alpha, \beta \in Aut(R)`

is defined by:

  `(\phi, \pi, \alpha)(\psi, \sigma, \beta) := (\phi * \psi^{\pi, \alpha}, \pi * \sigma, \alpha * \beta)`

with

  `\psi^{\pi, \alpha} := (\alpha(\psi_{\pi(0} ) ), \ldots, \alpha(\psi_{\pi(n-1} ) ) )`

and an elementwisely defined multiplication of vectors.

This group plays an important role in coding theory since it is the group of all semilinear isometries (relative to the Hamming/Lee/homogenous metric) of the ambient space.

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:9\" align=\"right\">comment:9</div>\n\n* Your `_element_class` method doesn't do anything non-trivial, its simpler to use \n\n  ```\n  class SemimonomialGroup(...):\n      Element = SemimonomialGroupElement\n  ```\n  instead.\n\n* Your parent overrides `__call__`, thats a big no-no in our parent/element framework. By default, calling the parent will end up using `SeminmonomialGroupElement.__init__`. If you need to normalize arguments, you should implement a `SemimonomialGroup._element_constructor_` method. See e.g. Simon King's talk at http://wiki.sagemath.org/days53/schedule for details. (This should be better documented in the developer manual, I know).\n\n* Also run the testsuite for elements, e.g. `TestSuite(S.an_element()).run()`\n\n* It would be nice to have exceptions in py3-compatible syntax (this should also go into the developer manual) and lower-case:\n\n  ```\n    raise Exception, 'This is a boo-boo'   # bad\n    raise Exception('this is a boo-boo')   # good\n  ```\n\n* Is `SemimonomialGroup` really used in the literature? A quick googling doesn't find any other references. Its a bit confusing since you are not talking about a generalization of monomial groups. The latter is already quite general, e.g. every supersolvable group. Perhaps `AutomorphismGroupOfLinearCode` would be a more fitting description? Or is there another characterization? I realize that thats a handful, but it could be made available as `LinearCode.AutomorphismGroup`, say.\n\n* Storing the translation in a list is tricky as the user might inadvertently change it \n\n  ```\n    sage: g = my_group.gen(0)\n    sage: v = g.get_v()\n    ... \n    sage: v[0] = 1   # changes g!\n  ```\n  To hold immutable data, its better to use tuples. Alternatively, use Sage vectors and set them immutable:\n\n  ```\n    sage: v = vector(GF(3), [0, 1, 2])\n    sage: v.set_immutable()\n    sage: v[0] = 1\n    ...\n    ValueError: vector is immutable; please change a copy instead (use copy())\n  ```",

* Your `_element_class` method doesn't do anything non-trivial, its simpler to use 

  ```
  class SemimonomialGroup(...):
      Element = SemimonomialGroupElement
  ```
  instead.

* Your parent overrides `__call__`, thats a big no-no in our parent/element framework. By default, calling the parent will end up using `SeminmonomialGroupElement.__init__`. If you need to normalize arguments, you should implement a `SemimonomialGroup._element_constructor_` method. See e.g. Simon King's talk at http://wiki.sagemath.org/days53/schedule for details. (This should be better documented in the developer manual, I know).

* Also run the testsuite for elements, e.g. `TestSuite(S.an_element()).run()`

* It would be nice to have exceptions in py3-compatible syntax (this should also go into the developer manual) and lower-case:

  ```
    raise Exception, 'This is a boo-boo'   # bad
    raise Exception('this is a boo-boo')   # good
  ```

* Is `SemimonomialGroup` really used in the literature? A quick googling doesn't find any other references. Its a bit confusing since you are not talking about a generalization of monomial groups. The latter is already quite general, e.g. every supersolvable group. Perhaps `AutomorphismGroupOfLinearCode` would be a more fitting description? Or is there another characterization? I realize that thats a handful, but it could be made available as `LinearCode.AutomorphismGroup`, say.

* Storing the translation in a list is tricky as the user might inadvertently change it 

  ```
    sage: g = my_group.gen(0)
    sage: v = g.get_v()
    ... 
    sage: v[0] = 1   # changes g!
  ```
  To hold immutable data, its better to use tuples. Alternatively, use Sage vectors and set them immutable:

  ```
    sage: v = vector(GF(3), [0, 1, 2])
    sage: v.set_immutable()
    sage: v[0] = 1
    ...
    ValueError: vector is immutable; please change a copy instead (use copy())
  ```

I think `AutomorphismGroupOfLinearCode` would be confusing, since the elements of this group need not to define an automorphism of a linear code. The automorphism group of a linear code is a subgroup of the semimonomial group.

Another characterization would be the group of semilinear Hamming isometries.

I did not find any answer to your question. But the wreath product G \wr S_n is known as the
*complete monomial group*. So, do you think I should call my group  
`CompleteSemimonomialGroup` or `SemimonomialTransformationGroup` to emphasize the difference?

The symmetric group S_n is the group of monomial automorphisms of the n-dimensional binary vector space.

Small nitpicks:
* In general it is better to use lazy import to improve the Sage startup time: 

    ```
    lazy_import('sage.groups.semimonomial_group.semimonomial_group',
                'SemimonomialGroup')

  in `sage/groups/all.py`. Then the actual import is deferred until you use it.
