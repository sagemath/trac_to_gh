From [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1985/unexpected-result-for-the-sum-of-a-series):

```
sage: n = var('n')
sage: sum(1/((2*n-1)^2*(2*n+1)^2*(2*n+3)^2), n, 0, oo)
3/256*pi^2 - 1/32
```

The correct answer is `3/256*pi^2`.

We should report this to maxima:

```
(%i10) load(simplify_sum);
(%o10) /tmpbig/burcin/sage-5.4/local/share/maxima/5.26.0/share/contrib/solve_r\
ec/simplify_sum.mac
(%i11) simplify_sum(sum(1/((2*n-1)^2*(2*n+1)^2*(2*n+3)^2), n, 0, inf));

                                          2
                                       %pi
                                   2   ---- - 4
                                %pi     2
(%o11)                          ---- + --------
                                128      128

After #13973:

```
sage: n = var('n')
sage: sum(1/((2*n-1)^2*(2*n+1)^2*(2*n+3)^2), n, 0, oo)
3/256*pi^2

Apparently my remote is indeed `trac` but this command doesn't work, nor do I have any idea what the branch is since that ticket seems to have a branch called "a130eed".

Okay, the following sequence worked:

```
$ git fetch trac refs/heads/u/pbruin/13973-maxima_update:refs/remotes/trac/u/pbruin/13973-maxima_update
$ git merge trac/u/pbruin/13973-maxima_update
```
This is so frustrating compared to the old system.
