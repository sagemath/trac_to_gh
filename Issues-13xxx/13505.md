This patch is an attempt to implement new bases of NCSF and QSym which currently exist on the combinat server. This includes the Monomial basis and Fundamental basis of Tevlin, the dual of the quasisymmetric Schur function introduced by Haglund, Luoto, Mason and van-Willigenburg, the Immaculate basis, introduced by Berg, Bergeron, Saliola, Serrano and Zabrocki. In QSym, it will implement all of the dual bases of NCSF.

Currently the attached patch implements only the Quasisymmetric Schur functions of Haglund, Luoto, Mason, and van-Willigenburg, plus some combinatorics of Composition Tableaux

Chris,

Are you still working on this? I see the patches on the combinat server but don't see a patch here on trac for the quasisymmetric Schur functions. If you'd like to provide a patch of what you have I am happy to review it, add to it, finish it, or whatever.

I uploaded a patch which implements composition tableaux and quasi symmetric Schur functions. The majority of the code is from the combinat patch Chris mentions in the ticket description, except I changed the class of CompositionTableau to more closely follow sage/combinat/tableau.py. I have also included a backtracker to help speed up iter methods.

I am working on doc strings and doing more tests of the patch, but thought it worthwhile to post the current state considering FPSAC starts next week in Pairs.

Following a suggestion from Chris Berg, I also cleaned up the `all.py` files so as not to pollute the global namespace.

Hey Jeff,

I've uploaded a review patch which moves the composition tableaux into its own file and does some minor cleanup of the docstrings and removing whitespace. There is a trivial dependency on #14101 in the `combinat/all.py`. If you're happy with my changes, go ahead and set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis

Travis,

I folded your review patch into the main patch. Thanks for your helpful edits. I had been wondering whether to pull the CompositionTableaux classes out and into a new module, thanks for taking care of that. It does make a lot more sense to have them separate.
