In `view` function, the default value for engine argument is `'latex'`. With this value, the compilation is trying (tex -> dvi -> png, and if an exception raised then dvi -> ps -> pdf). For some input, it is broken (example below) because of overfull vbox and overfull hbox created in the first tex -> dvi compilation.

When engine is `'pdflatex'`, the compilation just work.

The purpose of this ticket is to change engine default value from 'latex' to 'pdflatex'.

EXAMPLE::

Create this graph:

```
sage: F = GF(3)
sage: gens = [matrix(F,2,[1,0, 1,1]), matrix(F,2, [1,1, 0,1])]
sage: group = MatrixGroup(gens)
sage: G = group.cayley_graph()
```

It is not too big:

```
sage: G
Digraph on 24 vertices
```

Note that since the vertices of G are matrices, the default `format='tkz_graph'` [does not work](http://www.liafa.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~labbe/blogue/2012/10/draw-a-graph-of-matrices-in-latex-using-sage/). One need to use `format='dot2tex'`.

With dot2tex-2.8.7-2 and graphviz installed, the following work:

```
sage: G.set_latex_options(format='dot2tex', prog='neato')
sage: view(G)
sage: G.set_latex_options(format='dot2tex', prog='twopi')
sage: view(G)
sage: G.set_latex_options(format='dot2tex', prog='fdp')
sage: view(G)
```

But not these ones:

```
sage: G.set_latex_options(format='dot2tex', prog='dot')
sage: view(G)
An error occurred.
...
LaTex error
sage: G.set_latex_options(format='dot2tex', prog='circo')
sage: view(G)
An error occurred.
...
LaTex error
```

It turns out that the following works:

```
sage: G.set_latex_options(format='dot2tex', prog='dot')
sage: view(G, engine='pdflatex')
sage: G.set_latex_options(format='dot2tex', prog='circo')
sage: view(G, engine='pdflatex')
```


The following does the trick:

```
sage: view(G, engine='pdflatex', tightpage=True)
```

```
sage: G.set_latex_options(format='dot2tex', prog='circo')
sage: view(G, engine='pdflatex')
```

both compile fine and give pdf files with clear overfull vbox and hbox. And, one can see the complete graphs by using `tightpage=True`:

```
sage: G.set_latex_options(format='dot2tex', prog='dot')
sage: view(G, engine='pdflatex', tightpage=True)
sage: G.set_latex_options(format='dot2tex', prog='circo')

So before closing this ticket, I ask the following question:

Why is the default compilation of the command view doing (try : tex -> dvi -> png, except: dvi -> ps -> pdf) ? In which case is it better to do (tex -> dvi -> png) or (tex -> dvi -> ps -> pdf) rather then simply (tex -> pdf) ?

It has been a long time since I have seen pstricks code around here... and I would like 

```
view(G)
```

to just work.
