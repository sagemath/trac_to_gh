The current Mercurial doesn't work fully on Solaris SPARC.  Upgrading fixes this.  

I added a small sanity check in `spkg-install` that `hg log` works on the mercurial spkg repository.

**spkg**: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/mercurial-2.2.2.p0.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/mercurial-2.2.2.p0.spkg)

### mercurial-2.2.2.p0 (Jeroen Demeyer, 28 June 2012)
* Trac #13175: upgrade to mercurial-2.2.2.
* Remove xcode.patch, which got upstreamed.
* Rename posix.py.patch to etc_mercurial.patch; keep the spirit of
  the old patch but patch a different source file.
* Don't delete python/python2.6 and python/python in $SAGE_LOCAL/lib,
  this is handled by the Python spkg.

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

And it's notably faster than the old Mercurial.

Applying *all* patches in the merger script, using sage-5.0.1 as a base (user CPU time):

```
sage-5.1.beta5:               2m4.510s
