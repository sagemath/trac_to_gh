** Merge together with #13675, circular dependency **

```
sage: R.<x1,x2> = QQ[]
sage: I = R.ideal(x2**2 + x1 - 2, x1**2 - 1)
sage: test = I.gen(0) + x2*I.gen(1)
sage: test.lift(I) # correct
[1, x2]
sage: (test+1).lift(I) # invalid input, should give error
[0, 0]
sage: test.lift(I) # incorrect
[0, 0]
```

p.lift(I) should raise an exception "ValueError: polynomial is not in the ideal" instead of returning [0,0,...,0] in the first place...
