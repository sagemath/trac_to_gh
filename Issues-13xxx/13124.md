PolyBoRi's next minor release will be out soon.
There were no changes of the interface between PolyBoRi 0.8.2 and 0.8.1, so we just have to update the sources from here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/polybori/files/polybori/0.8.2rc

PolyBoRi 0.8.2 is a bugfix release incorporating all previous patches from Sage.

That makes sense, you you should really make sure that the upstream polybori-0.8.2 is **identical** to the Sage polybori-0.8.2.

Believe me, I have seen this kind of problems in the past with other packages where the upstream version was close to, but not quite equal to the Sage version.
