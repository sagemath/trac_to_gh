PolyBoRi's next minor release will be out soon.
There were no changes of the interface between PolyBoRi 0.8.2 and 0.8.1, so we just have to update the sources from here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/polybori/files/polybori/0.8.2rc

PolyBoRi 0.8.2 is a bugfix release incorporating all previous patches from Sage.

### Current spkg
* **Install** http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/polybori-0.8.2.spkg



Upstream: **None of the above - read trac for reasoning.**

That makes sense, you you should really make sure that the upstream polybori-0.8.2 is **identical** to the Sage polybori-0.8.2.

Believe me, I have seen this kind of problems in the past with other packages where the upstream version was close to, but not quite equal to the Sage version.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A9):
> Please don't name the spkg version "0.8.2" if polybori-0.8.2 hasn't actually been released!  If the upstream version is called "0.8.2rc1", then so should the Sage version be (including in `SPKG.txt`).

Because packages like PolyBoRi (and e.g., M4RI) wait for Sage's tests to pass before releasing, this strategy would create unnecessary bureaucracy. We'd do a rcX, Sage includes the package, we another package which is the final.
