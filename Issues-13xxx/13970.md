With patch #13875, we have fixed some memory allocation issues. However, some problems are remaining when working on large graphs instances (e.g., 45000 nodes).
This patch solves some (if not all) issues.

However, the function fails for graphs with 65535 vertices. This is due to the `init_short_digraph` method, but I don't know how to patch this.

Can you check this new version.

Hello !

- `sizeof(unsigned anything)` *is* equal to `sizeof(anything)`
- `for i in range(n):` is totally equivalent to `for 0<= i<n` (http://www.steinertriples.fr/ncohen/a.png)
- was there a problem with the variable `s` that you remove, even when it is defined as an `uint64_t` ? In the worst situation, `s` could be equal to something around `n^3`, so as `n` is at most `2^16`, this should be sufficient.

Nathann,

> - `sizeof(unsigned anything)` *is* equal to `sizeof(anything)`

Sure, but it is better to be consistent: easier to read.

> - `for i in range(n):` is totally equivalent to `for 0<= i<n` (http://www.steinertriples.fr/ncohen/a.png)

OK, I can change that

> - was there a problem with the variable `s` that you remove, even when it is defined as an `uint64_t` ? In the worst situation, `s` could be equal to something around `n^3`, so as `n` is at most `2^16`, this should be sufficient.

This is sufficient. I have just been lazy. I will include the type.

> By the way, what do you mean by "the function fails". Does it raise an exception, or is the result that it returns wrong ?

With 65534 nodes, the `init_short_digraph` method takes a few seconds. With 65535 nodes, I had to kill the process (after > 1 hour). I don't know yet whats going on. I have to investigate further with some print statements...

> With 65534 nodes, the `init_short_digraph` method takes a few seconds. With 65535 nodes, I had to kill the process (after > 1 hour). I don't know yet whats going on. I have to investigate further with some print statements...

AHahaha. Yeah. I know why : infinite loop `:-P`
Because of something like that :

```
cdef unsigned short i
for 0<= i <2^16:
    pass
```

And of course the loop never ends, for adding 1 to 2^16-1 makes it equal to 0.

Should raise an exception, though `:-P`

Yep. It's because the first test is

```
    if G.order() > g.n:
	raise ValueError("This structure can handle at most "+str(<int> g.n)+" vertices !")
```

And later there is a

```
    for i in range(1,g.n+1):
	g.neighbors[i] = g.neighbors[i-1] + <int> (cg.out_degree(vertices[i-1]) if isdigraph else G.degree(vertices[i-1]))
```

Actually, using an integer instead of a unsigned short would be sufficient to handle graphs with exactly `2^16` vertices, but I personally believe that the first test should be changed to `if G.order() >= g.n:`. Unless we have a very very very specific reason for creating grap with `2^16` vertices `:-P`

Attachment: **[trac_13970.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13970/trac_13970.patch.gz)**

I solved the issue using int instead of ushort for indexes inside the `init_short_digraph` method. I can now do:

```
sage: G = graphs.RandomBarabasiAlbert(65535,2)
sage: G.distances_distribution()
{1: 131066/2147385345, 2: 680474/715795115, 3: 6950033/715795115, 4: 152193754/2147385345, 5: 5581714/20451289, 6: 908791864/2147385345, 7: 86464963/429477069, 8: 8886494/429477069, 9: 539641/2147385345, 10: 244/2147385345}
```

So now it is working as expected/documented !
