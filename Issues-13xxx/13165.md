The following was reported by Nadim Restom on sage-support [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-support/c-wjnYxAcn8):

```
f = ModularForms(Gamma1(5),2).0
f*f

I am getting an error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "_sage_input_5.py", line 10, in <module>
    exec compile(u'open("___code___.py","w").write("# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\\n" + _support_.preparse_worksheet_cell(base64.b64decode("Zipm"),globals())+"\\n"); execfile(os.path.abspath("___code___.py"))

    raise ValueError, "Form is not an eigenvector for <%s>" % g
ValueError: Form is not an eigenvector for <2>
```

Looks like line 1040 of sage/modular/modform/element.py is the culprit.

The patch only changes line 1040, which David pointed out, so that a form without character doesn't stop multiplication.  Other than that, I only changed one example which appeared to have covered this case in an earlier version of Sage.

Please let me know if I misunderstood anything --- I'm just exploring the relevant code.
