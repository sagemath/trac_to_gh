I think this is simply a problem with a missing \_\_init\_\_.py file in the periods/ directory

Also, I think that the formula for the exponential integral in the cited book  (Lemma 10.4) has the wrong sign (easy to check in the case alpha=i, n=1 and m=0). This is simple to fix by initializing sgn=-1 instead of 1.
