If we remove a vertex which is a tuple from a graph which does not contain this vertex, Sage fails because it raises a `TypeError` instead of the usual `RuntimeError: Vertex (1) not in the graph.`

```
sage: G = Graph()
sage: G.delete_vertex((1,'a'))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/jaje/e_one_star/<ipython console> in <module>()

/home/jaje/sage-5.0.1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/generic_graph.pyc in delete_vertex(self, vertex, in_order)
   7247             vertex = self.vertices()[vertex]
   7248         if vertex not in self:
-> 7249             raise RuntimeError("Vertex (%s) not in the graph."%vertex)
   7250 
   7251         attributes_to_update = ('_pos', '_assoc', '_embedding')

TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting
```

This is because the source code reads

```
raise RuntimeError("Vertex (%s) not in the graph."%vertex)
```
so it fails if `vertex` is a tuple (too many values to unpack for the `%s`), as illustrated here:

```
sage: "BLA%sBLA"%(1,'a')      
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/jaje/e_one_star/<ipython console> in <module>()

TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting
sage: "BLA%sBLA"%str((1,'a'))
"BLA(1, 'a')BLA"
```

I guess this bug can just be corrected by replacing all the occurrences of `%vertex` by `%str(vertex)`. It also occurs in `DiGraph.delete_vertex`.

**Attachment:** [trac_13132.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13132/trac_13132.patch.gz)

This patch solves the problem for Graph and DiGraph since the function is in `generic_graph.py`. The `delete_vertices` also add the same bug.
