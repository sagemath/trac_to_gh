The tests become much too slow with this patch:

with only #13424 applied:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage-combinat/sage/combinat/cluster_algebra_quiver/cluster_seed.py"
	 [3.3 s]
sage -t  "devel/sage-combinat/sage/combinat/cluster_algebra_quiver/quiver.py"
	 [2.2 s]
```
and with this patch applied as well:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage-combinat/sage/combinat/cluster_algebra_quiver/cluster_seed.py"
	 [33.5 s]
sage -t  "devel/sage-combinat/sage/combinat/cluster_algebra_quiver/quiver.py"
	 [32.8 s]
```

We should avoid that.

Just uploaded a review patch (although I'm still working through it and this is just partial work).

The bulk of the changes are from mutation_type.py:

I documented and added examples for all methods until the testing
commands near the end, and _connected_mutation_type which I still need
to read and understand.

I also changed auxiliary command names so that they begin with an underscore.

Christian, there were a few places where I had questions for you,
these are indicated by the word "CHECK" in caps.

More to come later as I look through the other .py files in this patch also.

Christian, I just posted a new review patch.  I think the ticket is not too far away from being ready.  I documented as much of the code as I could with comments, and added explanations and examples for almost all methods.

There are a few outstanding comments or questions marked with CHECK.

Hi Gregg, I uploaded a new patch.

The main changes are:

- the mutation type check is now done in the order:
  - check if it is mutation infinite
  - look in existing files
  - use the big algorithm to determine the type
  - generate the files and look in these newly generated files

  (I just realize that this results in two times looking in the data if it already exists. I should change that).

- I moved the is_mutation_finite into mutation_type and take a matrix as input. I did this because this is quicker than computing the quiver and then the matrix again.

- I rewrote the code to construct the classical and exceptional data. Please have a look and say what you think.

The old mutation type check was actually very buggy. We still have a problem to solve: if you want to test the mutation type of `ClusterQuiver([['A',3],['B',2],['T',(4,4,4)]])`, you will get an error since the third part is "unknown infinite" but the program is trying to build a reducible type from it.

I would also appreciate if you could try to add some more tests to the mutation type and the is_finite_type tests and check if I didn't introduce any new bugs...

Cheers, Christian

Hi Christian, 

Small one small typo in the cluster seed documentation that is fixed by this patch, but no warnings or other errors.

If the documentation builds correctly for you, I think it is ready to go.

Thanks for your comments!

In the current design of the code, there is no use of storing the "quiver data" into a file of your choice, but rather into a particular data file! Information in this file will then later be used in other methods which need the same data over and over again. I do not see any use of this function in a way the user can decide the file to store the data.

Fixed!

`@`Gregg: please have a close look at my change to recheck that I didn't introduce any bugs. We now

- store the data in `DOT_SAGE` (which is usually `~/.sage`) in the function `_save_data_dig6`,
- check for the data in `load_data` first in the user folder for user saves and then in the folder coming from the package (if installed).

Cheers, Christian

Hi Christian,

It seems to work for me except for two small issues.

1) It seems that if I run save_quiver_data( ... ), and then load_data( ... ), I don't see the data I just saved.  If I close and restart sage, this seems okay, or maybe there's just a time-lag but let me know if you see similar behavior.

2) Let's say that a user runs save_quiver_data(2, up_to=False,'types'=Classical).
This saves data to the ./sage folder.

If the user now runs the load_data(2) command, it looks in the ./sage folder and sees and prints data for ['A', (1,1),1], ['A', 2], ['B', 2], and ['BC', 1, 1].

If I then close sage and run ../../sage -i cluster_seed-1.0.spkg (technically with the -f option since I'm reinstalling after having deleted the folder for testing purposes), then, I should also have the exceptional data now too, but when I run load_data(2), it still only loads the classical data from the ./sage folder.  

Do you get similar behavior?  I think it would be slightly better if load_data( n ) loaded the union of the dig6 data from the two sources.  Otherwise, if one saved the classical data (for e.g. for rank 9 or 10) then unless one also saved classicalexceptional, one would no longer have the exceptional data.  

However, this is still better than the version before where save_quiver_data and the spkg were writing to the same filenames so the same problem would have been appearing there.

Best, Gregg

Hi Gregg,

> 1) It seems that if I run save_quiver_data( ... ), and then load_data( ... ), I don't see the data I just saved.  If I close and restart sage, this seems okay, or maybe there's just a time-lag but let me know if you see similar behavior.

I think this was a cached_function thing, so I now delete this cache when saving the data (see the last lines of the updated function).

Please recheck that this is the issue you were refering to, and you could maybe also provide a doctest for it.

> 2) Let's say that a user runs save_quiver_data(2, up_to=False,'types'=Classical).
> This saves data to the ./sage folder.

Fixed as well, we now update the data_dict from both sources. Also: please recheck and provide a doctest, if possible.

Cheers, Christian

Hi Christian,

 I think the behavior is relatively self-explanatory and I am worried that extra dooctests with save and load commands where the spkg may or may not be installed would be more difficult to write than they are worth.  So I am happy to go ahead and give a positive review at this point.

We also had this problem on our machines. It is caused by the (expected, weird, buggy ???) behaviour that some machines give

```
sage: cmp(2,(1,1))
1
```
and others do

```
sage: cmp(2,(1,1))
-1
```
What should we thus do to get the output in some generic order?

If you can afford a sort somewhere, a typical trick is to do:

    sage: sorted(..., key=str)

And then it will sort according to the string representation which is platform independent.

I usually only use that for sorting the results in the doctests. But in your situation that could be ok too.

The key=str fix in quiver_mutation_type.py seems to have already solved the issues in save_quiver_data(), etc.

I am about to upload a new patch where we use the key=str for _mutation_type_test() and _random_multi_tests() in mutation_type.py.  

Reordering the examples accordingly slightly, this now passes on my machine (the one that was having trouble before).  All tests passed!

Christian, assuming that it passes on your machine with the new order of examples, and if you don't see other issues, it should be ready to go. 

Is there any way to get the patchbot to run again??? 

Do you want to fold the patches all into one again?  If the patchbot and you are happy, I think it's ready for a positive review on my behalf.

This one is totally weird.  When running `make testlong` on Sage 5.9.beta2, this test initially timed out, so I afterwards doctested it twice with `sage -t --long ...`.  In both cases, it took about 25 minutes (+/-, I don't recall exactly).

I then built Sage 5.9.beta2 with FLINT 2.3, and there it took less than half a minute (same machine, same compiler flags), repeatedly, and so I reran the test in vanilla 5.9.beta2 again, and it now takes about the same time there as well.

Seems like the new doctesting framework is pretty flaky.

(Still, `mutation_type.py`'s long doctests take quite a while in both installations, i.e., nearly 900 seconds.)

Thanks for your report - do you think we should provide a patch (in another ticket) to shorten the long doctests?
