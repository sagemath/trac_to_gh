<a id='comment:8'></a>Just uploaded a review patch (although I'm still working through it and this is just partial work).

The bulk of the changes are from mutation_type.py:

I documented and added examples for all methods until the testing
commands near the end, and _connected_mutation_type which I still need
to read and understand.

I also changed auxiliary command names so that they begin with an underscore.

Christian, there were a few places where I had questions for you,
these are indicated by the word "CHECK" in caps.

More to come later as I look through the other .py files in this patch also.

<a id='comment:11'></a>Hi Gregg, I uploaded a new patch.

The main changes are:

- the mutation type check is now done in the order:
  - check if it is mutation infinite
  - look in existing files
  - use the big algorithm to determine the type
  - generate the files and look in these newly generated files

  (I just realize that this results in two times looking in the data if it already exists. I should change that).

- I moved the is_mutation_finite into mutation_type and take a matrix as input. I did this because this is quicker than computing the quiver and then the matrix again.

- I rewrote the code to construct the classical and exceptional data. Please have a look and say what you think.

The old mutation type check was actually very buggy. We still have a problem to solve: if you want to test the mutation type of `ClusterQuiver([['A',3],['B',2],['T',(4,4,4)]])`, you will get an error since the third part is "unknown infinite" but the program is trying to build a reducible type from it.

I would also appreciate if you could try to add some more tests to the mutation type and the is_finite_type tests and check if I didn't introduce any new bugs...

Cheers, Christian

<a id='comment:17'></a>There are various problem with the documentation:

```

Also, I wondering whether you are using `assert` correctly. `assert` should only be used to check for bugs, not for bad user input. In other words, if there is any way to produce an `AssertionError` by supplying bad input to a public function, that is by definition a bug. Use `ValueError` or `TypeError` (or other exceptions) for bad user input.

Hi Christian, 

Small one small typo in the cluster seed documentation that is fixed by this patch, but no warnings or other errors.

If the documentation builds correctly for you, I think it is ready to go.

Thanks for your comments!

In the current design of the code, there is no use of storing the "quiver data" into a file of your choice, but rather into a particular data file! Information in this file will then later be used in other methods which need the same data over and over again. I do not see any use of this function in a way the user can decide the file to store the data.

Do you anyway think, it would be better to have an optional argument to specify the filename?

Replying to [comment:24 jdemeyer]:

Fixed!

`@`Gregg: please have a close look at my change to recheck that I didn't introduce any bugs. We now

- store the data in `DOT_SAGE` (which is usually `~/.sage`) in the function `_save_data_dig6`,
- check for the data in `load_data` first in the user folder for user saves and then in the folder coming from the package (if installed).

Cheers, Christian

<a id='comment:26'></a>Hi Christian,

It seems to work for me except for two small issues.

1) It seems that if I run save_quiver_data( ... ), and then load_data( ... ), I don't see the data I just saved.  If I close and restart sage, this seems okay, or maybe there's just a time-lag but let me know if you see similar behavior.

2) Let's say that a user runs save_quiver_data(2, up_to=False,'types'=Classical).
This saves data to the ./sage folder.

If the user now runs the load_data(2) command, it looks in the ./sage folder and sees and prints data for ['A', (1,1),1], ['A', 2], ['B', 2], and ['BC', 1, 1].

If I then close sage and run ../../sage -i cluster_seed-1.0.spkg (technically with the -f option since I'm reinstalling after having deleted the folder for testing purposes), then, I should also have the exceptional data now too, but when I run load_data(2), it still only loads the classical data from the ./sage folder.  

Do you get similar behavior?  I think it would be slightly better if load_data( n ) loaded the union of the dig6 data from the two sources.  Otherwise, if one saved the classical data (for e.g. for rank 9 or 10) then unless one also saved classicalexceptional, one would no longer have the exceptional data.  

However, this is still better than the version before where save_quiver_data and the spkg were writing to the same filenames so the same problem would have been appearing there.

Best, Gregg

I think this was a cached_function thing, so I now delete this cache when saving the data (see the last lines of the updated function).

Please recheck that this is the issue you were refering to, and you could maybe also provide a doctest for it.

> 2) Let's say that a user runs save_quiver_data(2, up_to=False,'types'=Classical).

Fixed as well, we now update the data_dict from both sources. Also: please recheck and provide a doctest, if possible.

We also had this problem on our machines. It is caused by the (expected, weird, buggy ???) behaviour that some machines give

```
sage: cmp(2,(1,1))
1
```
and others do

```
sage: cmp(2,(1,1))
-1
```
What should we thus do to get the output in some generic order?

If you can afford a sort somewhere, a typical trick is to do:

    sage: sorted(..., key=str)

And then it will sort according to the string representation which is platform independent.

I usually only use that for sorting the results in the doctests. But in your situation that could be ok too.

Good idea, thanks -- the problem is not at all in a time critical method, so no problem to do your trick!

<a id='comment:39'></a>The key=str fix in quiver_mutation_type.py seems to have already solved the issues in save_quiver_data(), etc.

I am about to upload a new patch where we use the key=str for _mutation_type_test() and _random_multi_tests() in mutation_type.py.  

Reordering the examples accordingly slightly, this now passes on my machine (the one that was having trouble before).  All tests passed!

Christian, assuming that it passes on your machine with the new order of examples, and if you don't see other issues, it should be ready to go. 

Is there any way to get the patchbot to run again??? 

Do you want to fold the patches all into one again?  If the patchbot and you are happy, I think it's ready for a positive review on my behalf.

Seems like the new doctesting framework is pretty flaky.
