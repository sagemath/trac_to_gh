GL(32, GF(2)).random_element() takes more than 10s, which is ridiculous.

Proposed solution : use simple rejection sampling (i.e. generate a random matrix, check if it invertible, if not try again). The result is uniformly distributed amongst invertible matrices.

Before patch:

```
sage: %time GL(64, GF(2)).random_element() 
5 loops, best of 3: 15.5 s per loop
```

After patch :

```
sage: %timeit GL(64, GF(2)).random_element()
625 loops, best of 3: 2ms per loop
```

This is not true. The expected number of iterations is asymptotically `1 + 1/q + 2/q^2 + 3/q^3 + 5/q^4 + 7/q^5 + ....` 

For `GF(2)` you have 3.5 expected iterations, but for GF(127) you have 1.008 iterations..... So that asymptotically, the number of iterations is O(1), and the complexity of the procedure is `O(n^3)`, regardless of the size of the field.

Is that OK with you ?
