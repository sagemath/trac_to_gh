It is in fflas_ffpack-1.6.0//src/fflas-ffpack-config.in

I switched it back from positive review to needs info.

I received an email from another FreeBSD user, who said that bash is still needed.  I realized that I have not recently tried to build sage in FreeBSD when bash is not present.  Let me go ahead and do that, and see if more changes are needed.

Sorry for the delay.

That's completely true. However, this ticket is about correctly running `bash`, not about getting rid of the dependency on `bash`. I'm switching back to "needs review", I'll let you decide about the positive review.
