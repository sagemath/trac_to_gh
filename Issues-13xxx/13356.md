E.g.

```
sage: e = 2 * 2^(1/3)
sage: print latex(e)
2 \, 2^{\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)} 
```
the output looks like power of 22, there should be \cdot.

(And there should be no parenthesis around the power, but that does not change the meaning at least.)

#3202 was about the same problem and claims to be fixed, but I am not sure what is/was the problem with the example there. On the other hand, there is a test in the docstring of symbolic expressions claiming that `2 \, 2` is great.

Patch for pynac available [on my work-in-progress repo](https://bitbucket.org/burcin/pynac-wip/commits/838c6c3fff665d36ae262acadb2ed7a33d25500b?at=latex_overall_coeff_sep).

Now the output is:

```
sage: latex(2 * 2^x)
2 \cdot 2^{x}
```

We still keep `\,` if the next character is not a digit:

```
sage: latex(2* x^2)
2 \, x^{2}

In [this sage-support`@` thread](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/K7OwY5XIsAQ/discussion) the consensus seems to be to remove `\,` and only use `\cdot` when both sides are numerals.

I am planning to make this change if there are no objections. I'm afraid this will mean fixing doctests all over the tree yet again.
