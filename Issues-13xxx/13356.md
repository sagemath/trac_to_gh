```
E.g.

```
sage: e = 2 * 2^(1/3)
sage: print latex(e)
2 \, 2^{\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)} 
```
the output looks like power of 22, there should be \cdot.

(And there should be no parenthesis around the power, but that does not change the meaning at least.)

Depends on #15198

#3202 was about the same problem and claims to be fixed, but I am not sure what is/was the problem with the example there. On the other hand, there is a test in the docstring of symbolic expressions claiming that `2 \, 2` is great.

Patch for pynac available [on my work-in-progress repo](https://bitbucket.org/burcin/pynac-wip/commits/838c6c3fff665d36ae262acadb2ed7a33d25500b?at=latex_overall_coeff_sep). Doctest fixes in [attachment: trac_13356-latex_coeff_sep.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13356/trac_13356-latex_coeff_sep.patch.gz)

Now the output is:

```
sage: latex(2 * 2^x)
2 \cdot 2^{x}
```

We still keep `\,` if the next character is not a digit:

```
sage: latex(2* x^2)
2 \, x^{2}
```

In [this sage-support@ thread](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/K7OwY5XIsAQ/discussion) the consensus seems to be to remove `\,` and only use `\cdot` when both sides are numerals.

I am planning to make this change if there are no objections. I'm afraid this will mean fixing doctests all over the tree yet again.
