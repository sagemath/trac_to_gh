** Merge together with #13671, circular dependency **

TAB-completion advertises that the method exists, but it is NotImplemented.

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: f = x+y
sage: f.inverse_mod(ideal(x,y))
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: 
```

This should not be hard, as soon as a Groebner basis of the ideal can be computed.

** Merge together with #13671, circular dependency **

Hi Charles,

If I understand correctly, then after #13671 is fixed, the following code will give `"ValueError: polynomial is not in the ideal"` rather than `ArithmeticError: element is non-invertible`. (And until #13671 is fixed, trying to invert non-invertible elements may trigger the corruption from #13671.)

```
XY = P.one().lift((self,) + tuple(B)) 
if XY == [0]*len(XY): 
    raise ArithmeticError, "element is non-invertible"
```

How about changing it to the following?

```
if not P.one() in P.ideal([self] + B):
    raise ArithmeticError, "element is non-invertible"
XY = P.one().lift((self,) + tuple(B)) 
```

Some other comments:

* The first block of examples misses the `"::"` needed for nice formatting of the html documentation.
* The line `"returns an inverse of self modulo the ideal `I`"` could use a little bit more information: that "I" should be an ideal of the parent P of self, and that the output is an element of P, and I suppose a capital letter at the start.

Best,
Marco

The word OUTPUT is indented too much. You can also see what the documentation looks like with `./sage -docbuild reference html` and looking at `SAGEROOT/devel/sage-main/doc/output/html/en/reference/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.html`. Fix this, and this patch can get a positive review.

Note though that the check with "in" is very inefficient (so I'm sorry for suggesting it):

```
sage: R.<x1,x2> = QQ[]
sage: I = R.ideal(x2**2 + x1 - 2, x1**2 - 1) 
sage: f = x1 + 3*x2^2
sage: self = f
sage: P=R
sage: B = I.groebner_basis()
sage: timeit('(P.one() in P.ideal([self]+B))')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.23 ms per loop
sage: timeit('P.one().lift((self,)+tuple(B))')
625 loops, best of 3: 161 µs per loop
```
I haven't tried bigger examples, so I don't know what happens with them. Do you? Even if it were efficient, then it looks like, after computing the Groebner basis B, I assume some (Groebner basis?) precomputation involving [self]+B is done computed twice.

Well, checking that P.one() belongs to [self]+B should in principe trigger the computation of a Groebner basis thereof. But performing the "lift" also requires a GB, so I assume that the whole operation computes a GB of [self]+B. It would be stupid if this happened TWICE though.

However, computing a GB of the ideal B was useless, so I removed it (but when you work in the quotient R/B, you most likely WILL need a GB of B at some point, I guess).

> For both these reasons, it would seem faster to do skip the check with "in", and put the line with "lift" inside a "try". But that would require #13671 to be fixed first. Alternatively: in which package is "lift" implemented? Doesn't that package have an "inverse_mod" method ready to wrap?


Lift is implemented by singular. We could have a generic implementation based on multivariate polynomial division, but it would not make much sense, because all our operations on multivariate polynomial are handled by singular at this time.

I don't know if singular has the inverse_mod operation. I will check. However at this time, testing if 1 belongs to the ideal is necessary to work around the bug in lift exposed by #13671

> should inverse_mod(...) be implemented in multi_polynomial.py or in multi_polynomial_element.py ???
> 
> I don't exactly understand the logic here...


Here's the logic, as far as I understand:

* multi_polynomial.pyx contains the base class MPolynomial
* multi_polynomial_element.py contains polynomials over arbitrary rings, in the form of the class MPolynomial_polydict
* multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx contains fast polynomials via Singular, in the form of the class MPolynomial_libsingular

The lift function, which you use, currently only exists in MPolynomial_libsingular and MPolynomial_polydict.

The two classes MPolynomial_libsingular and MPolynomial_polydict inherit from the first (MPolynomial) and there is no more specific class from which they both inherit.

So if you put inverse_mod in multi_polynomial.pyx directly, without providing a "lift" method there as well, you run the risk of getting

```
AttributeError: '...' object has no attribute 'lift'
```

which isn't very helpful, as the word "lift" can mean dozens of things in mathematics.

So I think that leaves you with two options: either

* implement inverse_mod in both of MPolynomial_libsingular and MPolynomial_polydict (or only one of them if you don't care about the other and don't mind doing half a job)
* implement inverse_mod in MPolynomial, and give Mpolynomial a "lift" method with the same documentation as the "lift" method in the other two classes, but always raising `NotImplementedError`

The second option looks best to me, and you're already halfway with that.

Well, the logic behind this would be more obvious if multi_polynomial_element.py was in fact named multi_polynomial_polydict.py... But who am I to complain :) ?

Well, the latter actually uses the former...

You fixed the output of a test for `__invert__` in quotient_ring_element.py, but actually the whole test is incorrect.

The element x mod `(x<sup>2+y</sup>2)` has no inverse, and this is not because "extending the base field is implemented yet" as claimed in quotient_ring_element.py, neither is it because "extending the base field is *not* implemented yet". This element has no inverse, even if the base field is extended. This element is simply not invertible. Could you remove the words "`, and extending the base field is implemented yet`"?
