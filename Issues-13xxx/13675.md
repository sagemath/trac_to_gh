** Merge together with #13671, circular dependency **

TAB-completion advertises that the method exists, but it is NotImplemented.

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: f = x+y
sage: f.inverse_mod(ideal(x,y))
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: 
```

This should not be hard, as soon as a Groebner basis of the ideal can be computed.

** Merge together with #13671, circular dependency **


Depends on #13671

Hi Charles,

If I understand correctly, then after #13671 is fixed, the following code will give `"ValueError: polynomial is not in the ideal"` rather than `ArithmeticError: element is non-invertible`. (And until #13671 is fixed, trying to invert non-invertible elements may trigger the corruption from #13671.)

```
XY = P.one().lift((self,) + tuple(B)) 
if XY == [0]*len(XY): 
    raise ArithmeticError, "element is non-invertible"
```

How about changing it to the following?

```
if not P.one() in P.ideal([self] + B):
    raise ArithmeticError, "element is non-invertible"
XY = P.one().lift((self,) + tuple(B)) 
```

Some other comments:

* The first block of examples misses the `"::"` needed for nice formatting of the html documentation.
* The line <code>"returns an inverse of self modulo the ideal \`I\`"</code> could use a little bit more information: that "I" should be an ideal of the parent P of self, and that the output is an element of P, and I suppose a capital letter at the start.

Best,
Marco

Hi Marco,

Thanks for your advice. I (think that I) implemented your suggestions.

I have a question though: is it necessary and/or desirable to check wether the second argument is actually an ideal? It seems that most functions do not, but is this the standard behavior?

The word OUTPUT is indented too much. You can also see what the documentation looks like with `./sage -docbuild reference html` and looking at `SAGEROOT/devel/sage-main/doc/output/html/en/reference/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.html`. Fix this, and this patch can get a positive review.

Note though that the check with "in" is very inefficient (so I'm sorry for suggesting it):

```
sage: R.<x1,x2> = QQ[]
sage: I = R.ideal(x2**2 + x1 - 2, x1**2 - 1) 
sage: f = x1 + 3*x2^2
sage: self = f
sage: P=R
sage: B = I.groebner_basis()
sage: timeit('(P.one() in P.ideal([self]+B))')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.23 ms per loop
sage: timeit('P.one().lift((self,)+tuple(B))')
625 loops, best of 3: 161 µs per loop
```

Well, checking that P.one() belongs to [self]+B should in principe trigger the computation of a Groebner basis thereof. But performing the "lift" also requires a GB, so I assume that the whole operation computes a GB of [self]+B. It would be stupid if this happened TWICE though.

However, computing a GB of the ideal B was useless, so I removed it (but when you work in the quotient R/B, you most likely WILL need a GB of B at some point, I guess).

Lift is implemented by singular. We could have a generic implementation based on multivariate polynomial division, but it would not make much sense, because all our operations on multivariate polynomial are handled by singular at this time.

I don't know if singular has the inverse_mod operation. I will check. However at this time, testing if 1 belongs to the ideal is necessary to work around the bug in lift exposed by #13671

I checked out the Singular documentation : lift IS the right way to compute the inverse in `R/I`

Hi Marco,

Just a stupid question : should inverse_mod(...) be implemented in multi_polynomial.py or in multi_polynomial_element.py ???

I don't exactly understand the logic here...

Replying to [Bouillaguet](#comment%3A8):
> should inverse_mod(...) be implemented in multi_polynomial.py or in multi_polynomial_element.py ???
> 
> I don't exactly understand the logic here...

Here's the logic, as far as I understand:

* multi_polynomial.pyx contains the base class MPolynomial
* multi_polynomial_element.py contains polynomials over arbitrary rings, in the form of the class MPolynomial_polydict
* multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx contains fast polynomials via Singular, in the form of the class MPolynomial_libsingular

The lift function, which you use, currently only exists in MPolynomial_libsingular and MPolynomial_polydict.

The two classes MPolynomial_libsingular and MPolynomial_polydict inherit from the first (MPolynomial) and there is no more specific class from which they both inherit.

So if you put inverse_mod in multi_polynomial.pyx directly, without providing a "lift" method there as well, you run the risk of getting

```
AttributeError: '...' object has no attribute 'lift'
```

which isn't very helpful, as the word "lift" can mean dozens of things in mathematics.

So I think that leaves you with two options: either

* implement inverse_mod in both of MPolynomial_libsingular and MPolynomial_polydict (or only one of them if you don't care about the other and don't mind doing half a job)
* implement inverse_mod in MPolynomial, and give Mpolynomial a "lift" method with the same documentation as the "lift" method in the other two classes, but always raising `NotImplementedError`

The second option looks best to me, and you're already halfway with that.
