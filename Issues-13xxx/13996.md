```
1. There is code in `spkg/bin/sage` which doesn't serve any purpose anymore, or options which aren't supported anymore.  Clean this up.

2. Rename the shell function `sage()` to `interactive_sage()` to minimize confusion (we already have `$SAGE_ROOT/sage` and `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin/sage`)

3. Maximize the use of `exec`.

4. Change "`python foo.py`" to "`foo.py`"

5. After installing new packages, run `sage-location`.

Some parts have been left untouched to avoid merge conflicts with existing patches such as #12719 and #12415.

**Apply**:
