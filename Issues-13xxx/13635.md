Ticket #13123 touched many files, including graphs.isgci, and broke a method on the way. An untested method -- because it requires internet -- but that should be fixed quickly because of political reasons : Ernst from ISGCI wants to make an announcement about his new version of the database, would like to tak about Sage on the way, and it's not exactly a good advertisement if we say "here's how you can update the db" when the method is broken `:-P`
