Hmmm, haven't really checked the code, but there are a couple of typos (or grammatical errors) in the documentation (besides *"non**-**negative"*), and a few instances of missing mark-up (such as `self` without double-backquotes).

Wonder on which platform

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_list import lazy_list
sage: P = lazy_list(iter(Primes()))[10::4]
sage: P.info()
cache length 0
start        10
stop         2147483647
...
```
will fail (i.e., `INT_MAX` will differ)... ;-)

Hey Vincent,

I've written a review patch which is mostly docstring changes (I've explicitly put in the stop so it does not depend on `INT_MAX`), but I've changed the `_repr_()` by just calculating the number of elements instead of the try-catch blocks. Everything else looks good, so if you agree with the changes, set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis

I found a safer way to write `_repr_()` using an auxilliary `_fit()` method. I also so add additional doctests into `__getitem__()` at the very end.

I switch using INT_MAX as a limiting value to PY_SSIZE_T_MAX which is defined in pyport.h (imported in Python.h). It makes more sense (and on my computer its size is larger than INT_MAX).

Hey Vincent,

I like this implementation much better.

I've added a few tests and tweaked documentation, but I've changed the behavior of `list()` slightly by not checking if stop was large since I did not like the following behavior:

```
sage: L = lazy_list([0,1]); L
lazy list [0, 1]
sage: L.list()
Traceback
...
ValueError: stop is too large!!
```
There definitely is a problem with determining when iterators are infinite throughout sage (for example, `vector(RR, QQ)` in ticket #13556), however I'd rather have finite lazy lists always have a `list()` method not raise an exception.

I've also added a check if the input to lazy list is a list or tuple, then it sets `stop` to the length of the list if `stop` was not specified.

If you agree with the changes, feel free to set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis

Hi Travis,

The doctest for .info() fails on my machine and for patchbot (if the test pass on your machine, I guess that we do not have the same PY_SSIZE_T_MAX). So I changed it.

I also add a TODO in the method `._update_cache_up_to(n)` which may be enhanced (but I was not able to do it because of my poor knowledge of cython).

Best,
Vincent

Seems like it.

> I also add a TODO in the method `._update_cache_up_to(n)` which may be enhanced (but I was not able to do it because of my poor knowledge of cython).

I trying using the python syntax for catching exceptions, and while things seemed to work fine when running in the interpreter, it caused segfaults when running `sage -t`.
