```
The simplest example I have is,

```
sage: hello = var('hello')
sage: latex(hello)
\mbox{hello}
sage: label = '$' + latex(hello) + '$'                    
sage: label
$ \mbox{hello} $
sage: plot(x, x, 0, 1, legend_label=label)
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (409, 0))
...
ParseFatalException: Expected end of math '$'
$ \mbox{hello} $ (at char 0), (line:1, col:1)
```

It seems that matplotlib doesn't understand `\mbox`. If that's the bug to be fixed, we can simply replace `\mbox` with `\rm` when passing to matplotlib.

On the other hand, if I've declared `hello` to be a symbolic variable, shouldn't it be marked up as a symbolic variable (i.e. left in math mode)?

Ok, I finally got a chance to look at this. Matplotlib doesn't use a full TeX implementation by default. It has its own subset called *mathtext* that it uses unless you tell it to do otherwise via,

```
from matplotlib import rcParams
rcParams['text.usetex']=True
```

This requires you to have "TeX" available in your `$PATH`, whatever that means. I've done some experimenting and it's possible to set this globally via,

```
#text.usetex         : False # use latex for all text handling.
```

in `local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/matplotlibrc`.

However, I have a full, standalone LaTeX installed everywhere that I work, so I'm not sure if doing this would break a clean install.

I don't know, because I can't plot anything thanks to #12276 =)

I'm **guessing** that it will work if I use `typeset='latex'` or `typeset='type1'` everywhere, but there are two problems:

1. My example in the description will still crash.

2. None of this works on a bare sage install, the user has to go find the missing ghostscript, latex, and dvipng dependencies and install them himself.

Works for me. I have no problems with plotting with `typeset='latex'`. And my (external) dvipng is compiled with jpeg. My Sage's gd is not linked to jpeg, but the system gd is.

We can not expect to package latex with Sage. Latex packages are *huge*! We are better off asking the user to install them externally, especially since they are not an essential component of Sage.

Sorry, like I said, I was just guessing. Did you try running dvipng from within the sage shell? This is what I get:

```

There's a GSOC project that will hopefully go a long ways towards fixing the build system, but if you're going to decide to ship all of sage's dependencies, you've really got to ship all of them. Otherwise certain parts of the program will break, apparently at random.

```

The absence of \mbox probably makes a better unit test than the presence of \mathit.
