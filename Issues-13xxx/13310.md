Two issues:
1. The use of <code>:trac:`<number>`</code> is broken on the command line. The second link below shouldn't repeat the ticket number of the first one

```
sage: integral?
<removed earlier text>
       TESTS:

       A symbolic integral from http://trac.sagemath.org/11445 that was
       incorrect in earlier versions of Maxima:

          sage: f = abs(x - 1) + abs(x + 1) - 2*abs(x)
          sage: integrate(f, (x, -Infinity, Infinity))
          2

       Another symbolic integral, from http://trac.sagemath.org/11445,
       that used to return zero incorrectly:

          sage: f = exp(-x) * sinh(sqrt(x))
          sage: integrate(f, x, 0, Infinity)
          1/2*sqrt(pi)*e^(1/4)
```
2. [reported upstream](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/issues/90). The link in the notebook is actually correct (that is I get the correct ticket number in the second URL), but it should open the documentation in a *new tab*. Otherwise, there is a huge potential of someone losing all their work just because they forgot to shift-click or something.

#13116 fixed trac tickets in docstrings for command line, but I think it wasn't fixed properly. The problem exists at least as far back as sage-5.1.rc0.
