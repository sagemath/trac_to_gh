I get two complaints about unreachable code in `sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx` for `toGEN` (line 9197 after #12215) and `_coerce_c_impl` (line 9670 after #12215) and the compiler is correct if I read the code correctly. The edits causing this both are from the pre-trac ticket era (2007 and 2006 respectively)
