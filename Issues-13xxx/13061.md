Right now, users have access to Maxima's `rectform()` though the `maxima_methods()` method. However, those methods remain undocumented, untested, and (more importantly?) hidden from tab-completion.

We can cure this for `rectform()`, which can then be used in #11785.

I disagree. It makes some sense to use the maxima names for methods on symbolic objects if they are that closely related. Only pollute the global name space with these if it is particularly desired to have the functionality available via that route. Even then, the sage name should be good and mnemonic and doesn't necessarily have to follow maxima. I don't know what rectform does and the name doesn't help explaining that.

Things like "limit" and "integral" deserve to be in the global namespace thanks to mathematical convention. "simplify" and "solve", however poor their definition is, are there due to tradition in computer algebra packages. If you want "rectform" in there too, you should argue its notability.

I don't feel all that strongly about it, but it makes sense to me seeing how related it is to `real_part` and `imaginary_part`, which are in the global namespace. I agree with you in that I don't like the name `rectform`, though.

Since I don't really mind either way and the patch looks good, I'll just give this a positive review and hopefully it'll get merged soon.
