The following fails in sage (likewise with charpoly):

```
k=CyclotomicField(10)
U=matrix(k, 1,1,[1])
var('t')
U.minpoly(t)
```

The error is in a call that the function makes to PolynomialRing :

```
TypeError: invalid input (Cyclotomic Field of order 10 and degree 4, t, None) to PolynomialRing function; please see the docstring for that function
```

Strangely, if you use :

```
k=CyclotomicField(10)
U=matrix(k, 1,1,[1])
var('t')
U.minpoly('t')
```
everything is fine.

In any case, I would expect charpoly/minpoly to complain themselves if I don't call them correctly (which isn't clear at all!) -- it's definitely not normal (and upsetting for newbies) that another function reacts.

This is with sage-5.1.beta6.
