```python

   sage: f = C.module_morphism(codomain=C,on_basis=lambda i:C.monomial(i))

Well, a linear map from V to W should really know that f(V.zero()) ==
W.zero(), and it does! Whether that should extend by coercion to 0 is
quite questionable. I for myself would not want to depend on this
feature in my own code.

In any cases, the ``automatic coercion to self.domain()'' feature will
come for free once ModuleMorphism won't override anymore __call__. See
the comment in sage/categories/modules_with_basis.py, close to the
implementation of _call_. That's the right thing to work on, if any.
I personally deem the feature not worth the trouble temporarily
messing up with the implementation of _call_ in ModuleMorphism.

Cheers!
                               Nicolas

My background is this: I'm working on an optional package for Steenrod algebra cohomology, and I have just implemented kernels of maps between modules. Now I would like to have

```python
f(kernel(f).an_element()) == 0
```
But this fails, because `f` cannot be evaluated on elements of `kernel(f)` - even though I have registered a canonical coercion map from `kernel(f)` into `f.domain()` (all of the modules are `CombinatorialFreeModules`).

Well, I can live with this deficiency in my code because I'm just patching Sage in my startup file. But it would be simple to fix this in Sage by changing the 
   {{{
   assert(x.parent() is self.domain())
   }}} 
into a cast
   {{{
   x = self.domain()(x)
   }}}
Whether it's worth doing this now depends on the timeframe of the other patch that you mentioned.

Cheers,\\
Christian

Nice! We will need such tools as well. Is the domain of f graded or finite dimensional?

I see. It would be natural to go from f.kernel() to f.codomain() using
a lift method (see S.Subquotients? for S=Sets()). So the above could
be written without coercion using:

	f(kernel(f).an_element().lift()).is_zero()

Which is not so bad. Actually, the is_zero test is better since it
expresses more precisely the intention which opens the door for more
optimizations from the system (and indeed is_zero is faster than ==0).

Which, honestly, I have no idea about ... sorry.  I have a patch for
multi-morphisms but it's been lying around for a while.

The modules are all tri-graded: they have two internal degrees (because the Steenrod algebra is bigraded) and one homological degree (because I'm really trying to implement *differential* graded modules). 

The framework for multi-graded objects is of my own making and still quite experimental; I once had a look at some grading patches in the combinat queue [years ago] but decided that I probably needed something different. Of course, whether my own approach leads to something workable is not clear yet... I hope to arrive at something publishable at some point in the next year.

My kernels do follow the `SubQuotients` protocol, so this would indeed work. But I doubt that this syntax would be very appealing to users of the package.

Anyway, I can patch Sage in my package, so this is not an urgent problem for me.
