Adds a method generating a permutation group's holomorph as a permutation group.
The holomorph of a group is the semidirect product of itself with its automorphism group, where the automorphism group acts canonically. This method has been inserted into categories/groups.py with a `NotImplementedError`, and then has been overridden in the case of permutation groups.
