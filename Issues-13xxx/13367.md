Adds a method generating a permutation group's holomorph as a permutation group.
The holomorph of a group is the semidirect product of itself with its automorphism group, where the automorphism group acts canonically. This method has been inserted into categories/groups.py with a `NotImplementedError`, and then has been overridden in the case of permutation groups.

Typo: semidrirect instead of semidirect.

Another minor nitpick: Please don't add empty lines at the end of docstring or at the beginning of the function body. Python style is to use empty lines as sparingly as possible (see PEP8).
