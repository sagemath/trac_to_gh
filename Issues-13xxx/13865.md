Currently, `SAGE_DEBUG` is documented as 

```
If it is unset (the default) or set to “yes”, then debugging is turned on.
```
This is fine if you just add `gcc -g`, but the utility of having a real Python debug build shows that there should be more to debugging than just adding symbols. However, this has a real performance impact and should not be the default. So I propose that `SAGE_DEBUG` have three possible values:
* `SAGE_DEBUG=no` means no debugging symbols (no `gcc -g`), which mostly saves disk space.
* `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` builds debug versions if possible (in particular, Python and Singular). These will be notable slower.
* Anything else (including unset `SAGE_DEBUG`) is the same as the old default, compile with debugging symbols but no debugging options that influence performance.

Ah, 'anything else' sounds like a great 3rd case.

Is there any standard on whether "yes/no", "!Yes/No", "true/false", "on/off" etc. is preferred? I always end up having to google the environment variables and then hope and check later that the value I used had the desired effect.

Oh.  I thought it was at least in some `spkg-install`template.





> No idea how to strip besides doing it yourself, and that definitely shouldn't be covered in the install guide.

There used to be `sage [-]-strip`, but that got removed at some point because it did more than just stripping debug symbols (which also failed on some -- presumably MacOS X -- systems) IIRC.

(We now -- or still -- have the "micro-release" `make` target though, see also `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-micro_release`...)
