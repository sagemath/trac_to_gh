In Sage 5.7.beta4 the class `CartesianProduct_iter` is still a `CombinatorialClass`.

Previous ticket description:

---
Furthermore, the cartesian product can't handle infinite sets as factors. As a consequence the following is currently broken:

```python
sage: M=CombinatorialFreeModule(GF(3),Integers())
sage: N=tensor((M,))
sage: cartesian_product((N,N))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: len() of unsized object
```

The attached patch 
* derives `CartesianProduct_iter` from `EnumeratedSetFromIterator` instead
* adds doctests to verify that the TestSuites work
* makes sure that infinite factors are properly handled

=========

16 months later the test passes - must have been fixed by some other ticket
