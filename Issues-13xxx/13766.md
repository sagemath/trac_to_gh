Currently we have:

```
sage: L.<a>=CyclotomicField(7)
sage: a in L.unit_group()
False
```

This is because:

```
sage: a1=L.unit_group()(a)
sage: L(a1)

#13687

> And I couldn't find a doctest which tests this somewhere.


Coercion from the abstract unit group to the number field is tested by #13687.

```
sage: UK.gen(0) + K.one()   # coerce abstract generator into number field
```
Conversion the other way around already had a test.

```
sage: [UK(u) for u in (x^4-1).roots(K,multiplicities=False)]
```
The coercion framework will then make sure that "in" also works correctly. I don't think another test is necessary.

Enhancing the documentation by explaining that "in" works in this case is nice, but then make sure the English grammar is correct in the patch as well. And there are issues like the fact that `u0^6` may depend on the pari version, since any even exponent is correct, so this test will break later.

I propose to just close this ticket as duplicate instead :)
