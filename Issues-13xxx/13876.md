Use `SAGE_DEBUG` instead of the new and undocumented environment variable `SINGULAR_XALLOC`.

Also, building the Sage library with `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` is broken. This is because distutils then does not define `NDEBUG` which turns on broken Singular debugging stuff.

Sorry, I forgot to review it.

All tests pass, both with and without SAGE_DEBUG=yes, the spkg's repository is clean, the changes are documented in SPKG.txt. Hence, I can give it a positive review.
