Since (almost) every package depends on `patch` and `bzip2`, an update of either of these packages causes a rebuild of everything when upgrading.

An update of `prereq` even causes everything to be built twice(!) when upgrading (the new prereq script is only seen after the new root repo is installed, so the second `sage-upgrade` run for double-checking will install the new `prereq` and therefore rebuild everything).

We should simply remove dependencies of packages on `PREREQ`, `BZIP2` and `PATCH` and build those packages separately.
