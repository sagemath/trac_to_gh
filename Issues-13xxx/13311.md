The following code does not work as intended (I imagine), i.e. it does not interrupt the computation after 3 seconds.

```python

#!/usr/bin/python -tt

from sage.all import *
import time

def main():
  alarm(3)
  try:
    EllipticCurve([123456, 789011]).rank()
    #time.sleep(5) #code works as intended if the above command is replaced with this
  except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print 'Took too long'

# This is the standard boilerplate that calls the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

The problem is that the `c_lib` interrupt handling code doesn't treat the `SIGALRM` signal, this is fixed in the attached patch. It also changes some exception classes (instead of raising `RuntimeError` for every signal). Another cool new feature is that `alarm()` now works with a floating-point number of seconds.

A "cleaner" work-around is to use the `@fork` decorator, such that the computation (implemented in Cython or e.g. C/C++) runs in a subprocess, while `alarm()` is used in the main (Python) process; cf.

Minor things:

*"The latter signal also redirect stdin from /dev/null, to cause interactive sessions to exit **also**."*

-> *"The latter signal also redirect**s** stdin from /dev/null, to cause interactive sessions to exit."*

`s/`time out`/`time-out`/` (or timeout, which is also used later on) a couple of times, and in the doctest error message `s/`Time out`/`Timed out`/` (consistent with e.g. *Interrupt**ed***).




In `sig_raise_exception()`, shouldn't the message in `raise SystemError("unknown signal")` contain the signal number?

Maybe on a real-time OS ... ;-)

Ok, fixed now.  Or more nit-picking:

Maybe

```python
    raise SystemError("Received unknown signal number %s"%sig)
```
?

Generating a `SIGALRM` outside `sig_on()...sig_off()` calls `PyErr_SetInterrupt()`, which causes Python to raise a `KeyboardInterrupt`:

```
sage: alarm(1) 
sage: # wait 1 second
KeyboardInterrupt
```
The same thing already happens without this patch.  Wouldn't it make sense to also raise an `AlarmInterrupt` outside `sig_on()...sig_off()`, too?

No, it doesn't. It causes IPython to print the string `"KeyboardInterrupt"`. See the difference with

I was mislead by the Python documentation, which says that `PyErr_SetInterrupt()` causes a `KeyboardInterrupt` to be raised the next time `PyErr_CheckSignals()` is called.  In fact this only describes what Python's default `SIGINT` handler does, which we don't use.

OK, so IPython prints the string `"KeyboardInterrupt"` in an `except KeyboardInterrupt` block when it is reading input.

Given that an interrupt is not necessarily generated from the keyboard, it would be more logical from the user's perspective if IPython would print either (1) a generic message like `"Interrupt"`, (2) a different string for `KeyboardInterrupt` and `AlarmInterrupt`, or even (3) nothing (Bash just prints a newline when you press `^C` and nothing when you press `^\`.)

I would be in favour of (2); to implement this, IPython could print `E.__class__.__name__` inside `except KeyboardInterrupt as E` instead of the constant string `"KeyboardInterrupt"`.

In principle it would also make more sense if `KeyboardInterrupt` and `AlarmInterrupt` would derive from a common `Interrupt` exception, but this is impossible since `KeyboardInterrupt` is a built-in Python exception.
