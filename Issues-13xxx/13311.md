The following code does not work as intended (I imagine), i.e. it does not interrupt the computation after 3 seconds.

```python

#!/usr/bin/python -tt

from sage.all import *
import time

def main():
  alarm(3)
  try:
    EllipticCurve([123456, 789011]).rank()
    #time.sleep(5) #code works as intended if the above command is replaced with this
  except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print 'Took too long'

# This is the standard boilerplate that calls the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

The problem is that the `c_lib` interrupt handling code doesn't treat the `SIGALRM` signal, this is fixed in the attached patch. It also changes some exception classes (instead of raising `RuntimeError` for every signal). Another cool new feature is that `alarm()` now works with a floating-point number of seconds.

A "cleaner" work-around is to use the ``@`fork` decorator, such that the computation (implemented in Cython or e.g. C/C++) runs in a subprocess, while `alarm()` is used in the main (Python) process; cf.

Minor things:

*"The latter signal also redirect stdin from /dev/null, to cause interactive sessions to exit **also**."*

-> *"The latter signal also redirect**s** stdin from /dev/null, to cause interactive sessions to exit."*

`s/`time out`/`time-out`/` (or timeout, which is also used later on) a couple of times, and in the doctest error message `s/`Time out`/`Timed out`/` (consistent with e.g. *Interrupt**ed***).




In `sig_raise_exception()`, shouldn't the message in `raise SystemError("unknown signal")` contain the signal number?

Generating a `SIGALRM` outside `sig_on()...sig_off()` calls `PyErr_SetInterrupt()`, which causes Python to raise a `KeyboardInterrupt`:

```
sage: alarm(1) 
sage: # wait 1 second
KeyboardInterrupt
```
The same thing already happens without this patch.  Wouldn't it make sense to also raise an `AlarmInterrupt` outside `sig_on()...sig_off()`, too?

No, it doesn't. It causes IPython to print the string `"KeyboardInterrupt"`. See the difference with

I was mislead by the Python documentation, which says that `PyErr_SetInterrupt()` causes a `KeyboardInterrupt` to be raised the next time `PyErr_CheckSignals()` is called.  In fact this only describes what Python's default `SIGINT` handler does, which we don't use.

OK, so IPython prints the string `"KeyboardInterrupt"` in an `except KeyboardInterrupt` block when it is reading input.  Do I understand correctly that the `KeyboardInterrupt` is in this case actually an `AlarmInterrupt` and triggers this `except` block because it inherits from `KeyboardInterrupt`?

Indeed. The Python `SIGINT` handler is changed in `_init_csage()` from `devel/sage/sage/ext/c_lib.pyx`.

Exactly.

Given that an interrupt is not necessarily generated from the keyboard, it would be more logical from the user's perspective if IPython would print either (1) a generic message like `"Interrupt"`, (2) a different string for `KeyboardInterrupt` and `AlarmInterrupt`, or even (3) nothing (Bash just prints a newline when you press `^C` and nothing when you press `^\`.)

I would be in favour of (2); to implement this, IPython could print `E.__class__.__name__` inside `except KeyboardInterrupt as E` instead of the constant string `"KeyboardInterrupt"`.

In principle it would also make more sense if `KeyboardInterrupt` and `AlarmInterrupt` would derive from a common `Interrupt` exception, but this is impossible since `KeyboardInterrupt` is a built-in Python exception.

Maybe, maybe not; in any case we can always do it later.

That issue aside, the patch looks good, behaves as expected and passes doctests.
