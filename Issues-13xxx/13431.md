As I reported on sage-devel:

```
sage: pi = permutations(4)[4]
sage: pi.signature()
1
sage: pi.sign()     
...
AttributeError: 'Permutation_class' object has no attribute 'sign'
```
and as was also mentioned:

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(2)
sage: a = G("(1,2)")
sage: a.sign()
-1
```

The proposal is to add sign as an alias to signature for the class 'sage.combinat.permutation.Permutation_class' by adding a single line to sage/combinat/permutation.py saying "sign = signature"

Dear Kevin,

That should work.

A simpler option is to just add the line

```
sign = signature
```

immediately below the `signature` method (with a blank line and maybe a comment about the line being an alias), indented at the same level as the `def` of the method.  (Then you have two names for the same function, hence an alias.)

But then you should make it clear in the docstring for the `signature()` method that `sign()` is indeed an alias.  This can be done nicely with a `..note` block, and an example or two.

In current patch, `p` should ideally be `self` and you have `EXAMPLES::` twice.

I think doing the one new line of code would be preferable to a whole new method.

Rob

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A7):
> This patch needs a proper commit message.

To clarify to khalasz (in case needed) this means that the line

```
[mq]: sign
```
should be something more informative such as 

```
Add sign as an alias for signature, for permutations.
```

The way to get this in there is to use the -e tag when you do qrefresh.  You can also cheat, by manually editing the patch file afterwards.
