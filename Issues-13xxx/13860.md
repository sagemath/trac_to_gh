ECL has moved to use a new ASDF, which means that as of ECL 12, the maxima 5.26.0 spkg stops working with it, due to a small change in the naming scheme of intermediary files.
The update  takes care of this, and the patched spkg works with both the current ASDF and the new ASDF.

The updated spkg: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/maxima-5.26.0.p1.spkg

---

The main purpose of this ticket is to allow the new ECL from #13324 (with a couple of valuable fixes) to get merged before the new Maxima spkg (5.29.1, #13364) is ready (which unfortunately is unlikely to happen very soon).

I've only read the attached patch (why "41", and what's the first file?), but that still contains the bug w.r.t. `check_error()` (see #13364).

It would also be better to use `cp -p[f] ...` (and delete some PDF files if we don't install them anyway; cf. #12759).

The spkg as well (and builds with both ECL 11.1 and 12.12; tests pass).

Merry Chrismas.

Deletion of some PDF files (we do not install) from the upstream tree belongs to `spkg-dist` (and/or should be mentioned in *"Special !Update/Build Instructions"*), but that's for another ticket, IMHO.

I would have prefered to have the ticket number at the beginning of the changelog (and removed the reference at the end of the pwd part) and put a capital letter at the beginning of the third point, but that's not the most crucial point here.

It is just that I feel our spkgs lack some consistency (and the dev manual some clear guide on how to craft them).
And I'm not even thinking of the ATLAS spkg which uses Python :)
