By #715 and related tickets, one observes a dramatic regression in the following example.

```
sage: p = polar_plot(lambda t: (100/(100+(t-pi/2)^8))*(2-sin(7*t)-cos(30*t)/2), -pi/4, 3*pi/2, color="red",plot_points=1000) 
```

First of all, it is very strange that the following homset is created several thousands of times:

```
Set of Homomorphisms from Integer Ring to Real Interval Field with 64 bits of precision
```
This also occurs *without* #715. Hence, enabling garbage collection seems not to be to blame.

However, the *creation time* for the homsets increases clearly, which is shown by prun.

**CC:**  jpflori @zimmermann6 @vbraun @robertwb @nbruin @malb @orlitzky

**Reviewer:** Volker Braun

**Author:** Simon King

**Merged:** sage-5.7.beta3

**Dependencies:** #715

**Resolution:** fixed

PS: There is almost no regression in this example, if #13014 is reverted, as Jeroen reported on sage-devel. Still, both problems should be addressed:

1. The previously existing repeated creation of a homset.
2. The new slowdown in the creation of homsets.

Really the example is very poor, a python function returning a symbolic expression. If you just had a symbolic function then the `fast_callable` trickery could do its job. Just leave out the `lambda t:` and it is >100 times faster!

So, why are the homsets not taken from cache when calling `polar_plot`? The same happens with `plot`, by the way.

The plot is adaptive, so even if you specify 3 points it uses many more.

About the caching, is the problem that the cache gets deleted too quickly? Between two evaluations of the lambda there is nothing that holds a reference to the symbolic expression. So all coercion caches should be free to be garbage collected.

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A8):

Have we been using weak references to cache homsets prior to #715?

> Between two evaluations of the lambda there is nothing that holds a reference to the symbolic expression. So all coercion caches should be free to be garbage collected.


Here is the problem:

```
QQ.gcd(3.14159,2*3.14159)
```
creates two times `Set of Homomorphisms from Integer Ring to Real Interval Field with 64 bits of precision in Category of euclidean domains`. So, no symbolics involved at this point.

My apologies to whoever created `QQ.gcd`. It now seems that the coercion into `QQ` is to blame:

```
sage: a = QQ(3.14159)
```
internally creates a new copy of `RealIntervalField(prec=64)`, and hence a new homset.

The attached patch is preliminary, as it is not tested, and I don't know if I was over-eager to cdefine stuff.

Anyway. Without the patch, it is

```
sage: %timeit a = QQ.gcd(3.14159,2*3.14159)
125 loops, best of 3: 4.58 ms per loop
sage: var('t')

CPU times: user 87.06 s, sys: 0.69 s, total: 87.75 s
Wall time: 88.15 s
```

With the patch, it is

```

sage: %time p = plot(lambda t: (100/(100+(t-pi/2)^8))*(2-sin(7*t)-cos(30*t)/2), -pi/4, 3*pi/2, color="red",plot_points=1000) 
CPU times: user 55.41 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 55.41 s

```

Would that be enough to fix the regression completely?

Yes.

I expect that it would be relatively harmless to use `UniqueRepresentation` in this case. Shall I try?

Question to Robert: Is it possible to use a metaclass in Cython?

I tried:

```
cdef class Test:
    __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass
    @staticmethod
    def __classcall__(cls,data):
        print "classcall"
        O = super(cls,cls).__new__(cls,data)
        cls.__init__(O,data)
        return O
    def __init__(self, data):
        print "init"

class Test2:
    __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass
    @staticmethod
    def __classcall__(cls,data):
        print "classcall"
        O = super(cls,cls).__new__(cls,data)
        cls.__init__(O,data)
        return O
    def __init__(self, data):
        print "init"
```

While I obtain

```
sage: Test2('bla')
classcall
init
<...Test2 object at 0x6128680>
```
I only get

```
sage: Test('bla')
init
<...Test object at 0x72eddc0>
```
with the Cython function. Hence, it compiles with the metaclass, but apparently it has no effect.

There's also sage.structure.factory.UniqueFactory.  It may also be worth holding a strong reference to the last N (for some small N) parents created to avoid creating the same one over and over.

In any case, this isn't a regression, so I'd be happy to get this fix in and post a follow-up ticket to ensure uniqueness.
