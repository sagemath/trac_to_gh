Previous description of ticket:

---
Plotting currently fails when plotting a symbolic function that evaluates to complex values:

```
sage: def evalf_func(self,x,parent=None):
....:     return parent(I*x) if parent!=None else I*x
....: 
sage: f = function('f', evalf_func=evalf_func)
sage: plot(abs(f(x)),0,5)
verbose 0 (2392: plot.py, generate_plot_points) WARNING: When plotting, failed to evaluate function at 199 points.
verbose 0 (2392: plot.py, generate_plot_points) Last error message: 'unable to simplify to float approximation'
```
This is because `plot` uses `fast_float`, and `fast_float` cannot deal with the intermediate complex value.

The attached patch first changes these things:

* it adds a method to `class Function` that allows one to see what output range is to be expected for a given input range. By default, it will return a complex field.
* it overrides this method for builtin functions, which return floats for float input
* this is then used by `fast_float` to throw an exception if complex values are to be expected

This exception will cause `plot` to fall back to `fast_callable` instead of `fast_float`. However, `fast_callable` needs patching too:

* it now uses the `_evalf_` method when available instead of just `__call__`. Otherwise, `plot` will try to coerce the result to `float`, which also cannot deal with complex intermediate values.

An alternative to this step would be to fix `float` coercion, which I haven't looked into.

Hello,

I don't understand your example. You define `f` to take complex values, how do you want to plot it as a real function? Could you be more explicit about the problem you intend to solve ? What kind of picture you would like to obtain with such input?

Note that for that purpose, there is yet `complex_plot`

```
{{{
sage: def evalf_func(self,x,parent=None):
....:     return parent(I*x) if parent!=None else I*x
....: 
sage: f = function('f', evalf_func=evalf_func)
sage: complex_plot(f, (-1,1), (-1,1)).show()
}}}

Thanks for looking at this!

Replying to [vdelecroix](#comment%3A9):
> I don't understand your example. You define `f` to take complex values, how do you want to plot it as a real function?


My example was

```
sage: plot(abs(f(x)),0,5)
```
Note the `abs`.

Now the point is that

```
sage: abs(f(3))
abs(f(3))
sage: float(abs(f(3)))
3.0
```
both work, but plotting doesn't:

```
plot(abs(f(x)),x,0,10)
verbose 0 (2430: plot.py, generate_plot_points) WARNING: When plotting, failed to evaluate function at 199 points.
verbose 0 (2430: plot.py, generate_plot_points) Last error message: 'unable to simplify to float approximation'
```
The reason is that there is an optimization to use `fast_callable` for calculating plot points. The current implementation assumes that all intermediate values are floats, whereas we can still make a real plot when the argument to abs is complex. This patch should fix that.

Is this any clearer? It would be great if you could test/review the patch!

#15030 fixes the same issue in a different (and I think simpler) way. I tried your example and it works with the #15030 patch as well.

I also think this is a significant issue; you can't even plot functions like `abs(log(x))` properly. tkluck, it would be great if you could look at my patch and if you think it's a better solution review it.

Hmm, these doctests look strange to me anyway.

```

should be 

```
parent is not None
```
I think.  The failures are actually probably features, not bugs, since `f` and `g` are symbolic functions, which are now not automatically evaluated, if that makes sense...
