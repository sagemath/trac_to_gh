For #12892 it would be useful to compute indices of cones as they define the number of components of each fiber. The index is defined in

  Yi Hu, Chien-Hao Liu, and Shing-Tung Yau. Toric morphisms and fibrations of toric Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces. Adv. Theor. Math. Phys., 6(3):457-506, 2002. arXiv:math/0010082v2  [math.AG].

for the case of surjection of complete fans. The attached patch extends the definition to any morphism:

* if the corresponded quotient of lattices is finite, return its order;
* if it has free generators, return infinity;
* if the codomain cone does not have covering domain cones at all, return None.

**Apply:**

Hi Volker, does the description definition sound OK?

The patch also improves handling of (non-saturated) sublattices and quotient lattices. In the process I had to cut `_split_ambient_lattice` - it will not split the dual one anymore. Note that this dual splitting was not documented and was used only to construct the dual quotient lattice - I have reimplemented the latter one in a more mathematically straightforward way, everything works as before, but choice of generators in doctest examples is now different (I checked that it is equivalent).

How about `fiber_index()` to distinguish it from the already existing index method?

The point of `_split_ambient_lattice` was that you only had to compute the Smith normal form once for the cone. Why not make use of cached data? 

The index is always finite according to p.464. 

If there is no preimage cone, I would also be fine with returning 0 instead of `None` in accord with counting fiber connected components.

Well, we don't really have fibers yet here and since it is defined as "index over cone" I thought index(cone) is the way to go.

The initial reason for dropping M splitting was that I couldn't figure out how to make it work nicely with sublattices when I need to split an already quotient lattice. Since my replacement is a straightforward implementation in terms of the dual lattice of a sublattice, in retrospect I also think that it would be better. Speedwise I didn't do precise measurements, but I was keeping an eye on timings of doctests and so far they don't seem to be affected.

The index is always finite in the case when the lattice morphism is surjective (assumption on p. 463) and fans are complete (implicit assumption of the paper). Take P2 and embed A1 over one of its rays. Then 3 fixed points and 2 lines are not covered at all, one line has only its distinguished point covered, and the torus itself has a lower dimensional torus in it. So my proposal is to return None for non-covered cones and infinity for two others. I'll also include a details explanation of this example into documentation.

where the second element is always the index of a cone in the sense of this ticket.
Those who want more details in the 0-case can use `restrict_to_image` method, which makes only two other cases possible.

 For #12892 it would be useful to compute indices of cones as they define the number of components of each fiber. The index is defined in

 for the case of surjection of complete fans. The attached patch extends the definition to any morphism:

 * if the corresponded quotient of lattices is finite, return its order;
 * if it has free generators, return infinity;
 * if the codomain cone does not have covering domain cones at all, return None.
