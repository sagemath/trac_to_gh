How about `fiber_index()` to distinguish it from the already existing index method?

The point of `_split_ambient_lattice` was that you only had to compute the Smith normal form once for the cone. Why not make use of cached data? 

The index is always finite according to p.464. 

If there is no preimage cone, I would also be fine with returning 0 instead of `None` in accord with counting fiber connected components.

Well, we don't really have fibers yet here and since it is defined as "index over cone" I thought index(cone) is the way to go.

The initial reason for dropping M splitting was that I couldn't figure out how to make it work nicely with sublattices when I need to split an already quotient lattice. Since my replacement is a straightforward implementation in terms of the dual lattice of a sublattice, in retrospect I also think that it would be better. Speedwise I didn't do precise measurements, but I was keeping an eye on timings of doctests and so far they don't seem to be affected.

The index is always finite in the case when the lattice morphism is surjective (assumption on p. 463) and fans are complete (implicit assumption of the paper). Take P2 and embed A1 over one of its rays. Then 3 fixed points and 2 lines are not covered at all, one line has only its distinguished point covered, and the torus itself has a lower dimensional torus in it. So my proposal is to return None for non-covered cones and infinity for two others. I'll also include a details explanation of this example into documentation.

On the level of toric morphisms, I think (component, count) would be the best output, with (None, None) for the case of non-covered orbits. For "partially covered" ones I am not sure yet.

Fibers are defined for any morphism, no matter whether it is a fibration or not, so I'd like fiber methods to do something useful still.

Reason: I compute the index as the product of invariants, then if it is 0 (indicating ZZ-factors) replace it with infinity. Dropping this extra replacement simplifies life here and then we can also just return this index for "incomplete covering", i.e. if there is some fiber over the distinguished point, we return it with zero to indicate that generically there are no such components at all. So possible cases will be:

* (component, 0) - non-surjective, but the distinguished point is covered;
* (None, None) - even the distinguished point is not covered;
where the second element is always the index of a cone in the sense of this ticket.
Those who want more details in the 0-case can use `restrict_to_image` method, which makes only two other cases possible.
