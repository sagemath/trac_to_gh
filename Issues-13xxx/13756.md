In doc/en/developer/conventions.rst , "Convert this integer in the multi-precision floating real field R" should be something like "Convert this integer into an element of the multi-precision floating real field R".

Actually since that sort of sounds like state is being mutated, and the original doesn't. Why not keep the original wording and turn "Returns" into "Return a"?

Thank you! "This function returns" always bugged me but I didn't do anything. While we are at it - what about articles? Why "a string", but just "integer"? (In the case here I would actually prefer "a positive integer".)

Aren't you Russian? You are not supposed to use articles at all ;-)

Seriously, I think both is fine. Personally I'd prefer no indefinite article since it doesn't convey any extra information: "string" is shorter than "a string". But its such a minor detail that I don't think we should elaborate on it in the manual.

Similarly, I don't think that "`a positive integer`" vs. "`integer $>0$`" merits having an official policy. Both are easily comprehensible.

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A5):
> Aren't you Russian? You are not supposed to use articles at all ;-)

And so I did not, but you did, and I was irritated by inconsistency in toric docstrings, such irritations transcend national tastes ;-) So I don't care much about the choice, but one would be nice.
