The Cholesky decomposition are implemented in the file [sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx](../tree/master/sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx) for some subfield of the algebraic numbers.

In this implementation the base ring must be exact or, for numerical work, a
matrix with a base ring of ``RDF`` or ``CDF`` must be used.

For the numerical work it's used the Cholesky decomposition implemented in [sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx](../tree/master/sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx) and because of this a error raised when try to compute the numerical Cholesky decomposition of a sparse matrix.

    "body": "<a id='comment:10'></a>\nOhhkay. So, the title of this ticket is a bit misleading. It's not a cholesky for sparse matrices that's missing, but rather a cholesky decomposition for matrices over inexact rings. For example,\n\n```\nsage: A = matrix(RR, [[1, 1], [1, 2]])                                          \nsage: A.cholesky()\n...\nTypeError: base ring of the matrix must be exact, not Real Field with 53 bits of precision\n```\n\nThe use of `RealField(100)` or any similar ring produces the same result. The problem only appears related to sparse matrices because there is a special case implemented for dense matrices over `RDF`, but not sparse matrices over `RDF`. Thus, over `RDF`, the sparse implementation is indeed just \"missing\" (it could use the dense implementation without hurting anything).\n\nBut regardless, the real problem to be solved here is that we need a numerically-stable cholesky factorization that works for most inexact rings. That implementation can then be used (in the meantime) for both the dense and sparse methods, until someone decides to come along and speed it up in the sparse case. I've essentially already done this on #10332, which adds a numerically-stable `block_ldlt()` method for all Hermitian matrices. When your matrix is positive-definite, the block-LDLT factorization can be turned into a cholesky factorization after taking the square root of `D`.\n\nSo my suggestion for this ticket is to use `block_ldlt()` from the other ticket instead of adding a special case that relies on `cvxopt`. By using `block_ldlt()`, you allow the `cholesky()` method to work on fields like `RR` that `cvxopt` doesn't know about. It should also simplify the code a little bit, at the price of some administrative overhead: you'll have to,\n\n1. Rebase your git branch onto u/mjo/ticket/10332\n2. Make this ticket depend on #10332\n3. Update the patch to use `block_ldlt()` instead of calling cvxopt.\n\nI think (3) is pretty self-explanatory after reading the docs for `block_ldlt()`, but if not, I'm happy to help.

Ohhkay. So, the title of this ticket is a bit misleading. It's not a cholesky for sparse matrices that's missing, but rather a cholesky decomposition for matrices over inexact rings. For example,

```
sage: A = matrix(RR, [[1, 1], [1, 2]])                                          
sage: A.cholesky()
...
TypeError: base ring of the matrix must be exact, not Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```

The use of `RealField(100)` or any similar ring produces the same result. The problem only appears related to sparse matrices because there is a special case implemented for dense matrices over `RDF`, but not sparse matrices over `RDF`. Thus, over `RDF`, the sparse implementation is indeed just "missing" (it could use the dense implementation without hurting anything).

But regardless, the real problem to be solved here is that we need a numerically-stable cholesky factorization that works for most inexact rings. That implementation can then be used (in the meantime) for both the dense and sparse methods, until someone decides to come along and speed it up in the sparse case. I've essentially already done this on #10332, which adds a numerically-stable `block_ldlt()` method for all Hermitian matrices. When your matrix is positive-definite, the block-LDLT factorization can be turned into a cholesky factorization after taking the square root of `D`.

So my suggestion for this ticket is to use `block_ldlt()` from the other ticket instead of adding a special case that relies on `cvxopt`. By using `block_ldlt()`, you allow the `cholesky()` method to work on fields like `RR` that `cvxopt` doesn't know about. It should also simplify the code a little bit, at the price of some administrative overhead: you'll have to,

1. Rebase your git branch onto u/mjo/ticket/10332
2. Make this ticket depend on #10332
3. Update the patch to use `block_ldlt()` instead of calling cvxopt.

I think (3) is pretty self-explanatory after reading the docs for `block_ldlt()`, but if not, I'm happy to help. E.g.

```
sage: A = matrix(QQ, [[9, 0, 3], [0, 1, 0], [3, 0, 25/4]])                      
sage: A.is_positive_definite()                                                  
True
sage: P,L,D = A.block_ldlt()                                                    
sage: L*D.apply_map(sqrt)                                                       
[           3            0            0]
[           0            1            0]
[           1            0 1/2*sqrt(21)]
sage: A.cholesky()                                                              
[                 3                  0                  0]
[                 0                  1                  0]
[                 1                  0 2.291287847477920?]
```

You might be able to save a few microseconds by using the internal `_block_ldlt()` method instead of the nice public one as well.

Indeed, for sparse matrices over RDF the cholmod interface of cvxopt is probably as fast as it can get (precision is of course another question).

In general, I'd be looking at wrapping up arb's [cholesky](https://arblib.org/arb_mat.html#cholesky-decomposition-and-solving) and LDLs,
as something more robust than a naive attempt to implement this stuff.
