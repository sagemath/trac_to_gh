The Cholesky decomposition are implemented in the file [sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx](../tree/master/sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx) for some subfield of the algebraic numbers.

In this implementation the base ring must be exact or, for numerical work, a
matrix with a base ring of ``RDF`` or ``CDF`` must be used.

For the numerical work it's used the Cholesky decomposition implemented in [sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx](../tree/master/sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx) and because of this a error raised when try to compute the numerical Cholesky decomposition of a sparse matrix.

```
sage: A = matrix(QQ, [[1, 1], [1, 2]]) 
sage: A.cholesky()                    
[1 0]
[1 1]
sage: A = matrix(QQ, [[1, 1], [1, 2]], sparse=True)
sage: A.cholesky()                                 
[1 0]
[1 1]
sage: A = matrix(RDF, [[1, 1], [1, 2]], sparse=True)  
sage: A = matrix(RDF, [[1, 1], [1, 2]])             
sage: A.cholesky()                                  
[1.0 0.0]
[1.0 1.0]
sage: A = matrix(RDF, [[1, 1], [1, 2]], sparse=True)
sage: A.cholesky()

```

For this solve this ticket the numerical sparce Cholesky decompostion need to be implemented.

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:8\" align=\"right\">comment:8</div>\n\nThings I don't understand very well:\n- What's the correct solution for dense matrices? while the above code works, there should be a fast way to supply an entire dense matrix to `cvxopt`? The best idea I had was to use `cvxopt.matrix(sagemat.to_numpy())`; perhaps there are faster methods I am unaware of?\n- Similarly, when building the sparse matrix, I coerce the matrix entries into a `float`.

Things I don't understand very well:
- What's the correct solution for dense matrices? while the above code works, there should be a fast way to supply an entire dense matrix to `cvxopt`? The best idea I had was to use `cvxopt.matrix(sagemat.to_numpy())`; perhaps there are faster methods I am unaware of?
- Similarly, when building the sparse matrix, I coerce the matrix entries into a `float`. What is the correct way to hand the matrix entries off to `cvxopt`?
- On the google groups thread(https://groups.google.com/g/cvxopt/c/xQ-lR9ESijg/discussion), there was some discussion about also getting a good permutation for cholesky. I'd like to submit this patch next once I figure the API out. Any pointers to this would be appreciated!

Ohhkay. So, the title of this ticket is a bit misleading. It's not a cholesky for sparse matrices that's missing, but rather a cholesky decomposition for matrices over inexact rings. For example,

```
sage: A = matrix(RR, [[1, 1], [1, 2]])                                          
sage: A.cholesky()
...
TypeError: base ring of the matrix must be exact, not Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```

The use of `RealField(100)` or any similar ring produces the same result. The problem only appears related to sparse matrices because there is a special case implemented for dense matrices over `RDF`, but not sparse matrices over `RDF`. Thus, over `RDF`, the sparse implementation is indeed just "missing" (it could use the dense implementation without hurting anything).

But regardless, the real problem to be solved here is that we need a numerically-stable cholesky factorization that works for most inexact rings. That implementation can then be used (in the meantime) for both the dense and sparse methods, until someone decides to come along and speed it up in the sparse case.

Indeed, for sparse matrices over RDF the cholmod interface of cvxopt is probably as fast as it can get (precision is of course another question).

In general, I'd be looking at wrapping up arb's [cholesky](https://arblib.org/arb_mat.html#cholesky-decomposition-and-solving) and LDLs,
as something more robust than a naive attempt to implement this stuff.

Thanks, the commit field thing is no big deal, that always happens. I'll see if I can reproduce the problem. The matrix is Hermitian by construction (unless I've made some typo I can't see) so it should be interesting.
