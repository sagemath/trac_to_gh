The Cholesky decomposition are implemented in the file [sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx](../tree/master/sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx) for some subfield of the algebraic numbers.

In this implementation the base ring must be exact or, for numerical work, a
matrix with a base ring of ``RDF`` or ``CDF`` must be used.

For the numerical work it's used the Cholesky decomposition implemented in [sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx](../tree/master/sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx) and because of this a error raised when try to compute the numerical Cholesky decomposition of a sparse matrix.

```
sage: A = matrix(QQ, [[1, 1], [1, 2]]) 
sage: A.cholesky()                    
[1 0]
[1 1]
sage: A = matrix(QQ, [[1, 1], [1, 2]], sparse=True)
sage: A.cholesky()                                 
[1 0]
[1 1]
sage: A = matrix(RDF, [[1, 1], [1, 2]], sparse=True)  
sage: A = matrix(RDF, [[1, 1], [1, 2]])             
sage: A.cholesky()                                  
[1.0 0.0]
[1.0 1.0]
sage: A = matrix(RDF, [[1, 1], [1, 2]], sparse=True)
sage: A.cholesky()

```

For this solve this ticket the numerical sparce Cholesky decompostion need to be implemented.

Ohhkay. So, the title of this ticket is a bit misleading. It's not a cholesky for sparse matrices that's missing, but rather a cholesky decomposition for matrices over inexact rings. For example,

```
sage: A = matrix(RR, [[1, 1], [1, 2]])                                          
sage: A.cholesky()
...
TypeError: base ring of the matrix must be exact, not Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```

The use of `RealField(100)` or any similar ring produces the same result. The problem only appears related to sparse matrices because there is a special case implemented for dense matrices over `RDF`, but not sparse matrices over `RDF`. Thus, over `RDF`, the sparse implementation is indeed just "missing" (it could use the dense implementation without hurting anything).

But regardless, the real problem to be solved here is that we need a numerically-stable cholesky factorization that works for most inexact rings. That implementation can then be used (in the meantime) for both the dense and sparse methods, until someone decides to come along and speed it up in the sparse case.

By using `block_ldlt()`, you allow the `cholesky()` method to work on fields like `RR` that `cvxopt` doesn't know about.

1. Rebase your git branch onto u/mjo/ticket/10332

In general, I'd be looking at wrapping up arb's [cholesky](https://arblib.org/arb_mat.html#cholesky-decomposition-and-solving) and LDLs,

1. Add a new subclass for sparse real double matrices in `sage/matrix/matrix_real_double_sparse.pyx`, and override only the `cholesky()` method there, with an implementation that uses `cholmod`.
2. Add a case to `src/sage/matrix/matrix_space.py` that tells the matrix constructor to use your new subclass when the ring is `RDF` and `sparse=True`. Something like,

```
if R is sage.rings.real_double.RDF:

3. I'll handle the other inexact rings whenever #10332 gets merged with a generic slow implementation based on `block_ldlt()`.

The subclass approach will avoid using `cholmod` where it's inappropriate. If you're not familiar with cython, the syntax isn't that much different than plain python. Here's an example pyx and pxd file that creates a subclass.

Thanks, the commit field thing is no big deal, that always happens. I'll see if I can reproduce the problem. The matrix is Hermitian by construction (unless I've made some typo I can't see) so it should be interesting.
