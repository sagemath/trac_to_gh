As it turned out from the discussion in the TRAC ticket 13721, the is_vertex_transitive method can be optimized and simplified substantially. 

This TRAC ticket aims at achieving that.

`partition` an `new_partition` are both partitions of the vertex set, and new_partition is necessarily more refined (i.e. each set of `new_partition` is a subset of some set of `partition`). Hence, they are equal if and only if they have same length !

Indeed, this makes sense! Also could you add a quick regularity check inside? 

The degrees of every  element of the same partition should coincide!

Looks good! 

My only two questions are

1. Can we expect a partition cell to be empty
2. What happens if we call this thing on the empty graph?
