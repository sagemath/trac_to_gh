When Sage encounters a SIGSEGV, it uses the glibc backtrace. This is sometimes seen in doctests that are not reproducible, making it hard to debug. The aim of this ticket is to return better automatic stack traces by automatically attaching gdb and running scripts in gdb's Python interpreter. This will will pinpoint the cause much easier, especially in a debug build.

The log is printed to stdout and automatically saved to a log file in `$DOT_SAGE/crash_logs` with logs older than a week automatically deleted.

I don't think I know enough about gdb to review this completely, but some remarks anyway:

1. There is a double "and" in

```
"Sage will now try to attach the debugger to get more information and\n"
"and then terminate.\n"
```

2. Why should the CSI script kill the Sage process? Couldn't you use a different IPC mechanism, such as a simple `wait()` (or a different signal or a pipe if you want)? The sentence "The target process is frozen while this script runs and resumes when it is finished." in `sage-CSI` is currently wrong.

3. I preferred how the backtrace currently appears **before** the "Unhandled SIGSEGV: ..." message. When something goes wrong, that message stands out at the end of the console output. I think all those backtraces might confuse less experienced Sage users.

4. In `run_gdb()`, `stderr` will always be `None` since you didn't redirect it. That's fine, so remove

```
if stderr != None: 
    result.append('An error ocurred:') 
    result.append(stderr)
```

5. The `Popen` command should probably be wrapped in a

```
try:
    cmd = Popen(...)
except OSError:
    return ""
```
block to handle the case that `gdb` isn't installed (and I guess empty backtraces should not be saved to a file).

At least you certainly know more than I do. So, sorry for my unqualified comments...

> 3. I preferred how the backtrace currently appears **before** the "Unhandled SIGSEGV: ..." message. When something goes wrong, that message stands out at the end of the console output.


Yes, when an error in Python is raised, one first sees the backtrace and then the error message. If Sage crashes, it makes sense to show first the backtrace and then the error message as well.

> I think all those backtraces might confuse less experienced Sage users.


Well, a less experienced Sage user will hopefully never see such backtraces.

What I mean is: Sage is supposed to run without crashes when doing low-level stuff. Hence, crashes are supposed to *only* occur if the user creates new buggy Cython programs in Sage, or tries to tweak Sage until it exposes its existing bugs. And I think a user who does such "real" programming and developing is experienced enough to not be confused by a backtrace.

Unfornately, "hopefully" and "should" aren't always applicable. There are plenty of cases where seemingly innocent calculations produce the dreaded "Unhandled SIGSEGV" message.

What happens if you import site into the python interpreter in gdb?

```
(gdb) python import site
(gdb) python import sys               
(gdb) python print sys.modules['site']
<module 'site' from '/home/vbraun/opt/sage-5.5.rc1/local/lib/python/site.pyc'>
```
Did you build gdb with python enabled? This should be the default but obviously requires Python to be installed in Gentoo.

No, definitely not. Library versioning is there for a reason. In the case of GDB you might get away with it since GDB just runs an embedded Python, but anything that really touches Python internals might get very upset.

Yes, it does, at least for Python-2.6.

When system Python is 2.4, it doesn't work.  I don't have a system with Python 2.5 and a sufficiently recent GDB.

Could you add

```
libpython = os.path.join(env['SAGE_LOCAL'], 'lib', libpython)
```
since libpython is returned as relative path and causes `gdb` to fail to start on OS X.

But even with this change, the hack doesn't work on OS X.

System `gdb`:

```
(sage subshell) bsd:sage-4.8 jdemeyer$ DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libpython2.7.dylib" /usr/bin/gdb
dyld: Symbol not found: _environ
  Referenced from: /Users/jdemeyer/sage-4.8/local/lib/libpython2.7.dylib
  Expected in: flat namespace
 in /Users/jdemeyer/sage-4.8/local/lib/libpython2.7.dylib
Trace/BPT trap
```

`gdb` spkg but compiled (on purpose) with the wrong Python version:

```
(sage subshell) bsd:sage-4.8 jdemeyer$ DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libpython2.7.dylib" gdb
'import site' failed; use -v for traceback

This is an annoying problem on OS X:

Copyright 2004 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
GDB is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and you are
welcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under certain conditions.
Type "show copying" to see the conditions.
There is absolutely no warranty for GDB.  Type "show warranty" for details.
This GDB was configured as "x86_64-apple-darwin".
(gdb) attach 71798
We need authorization from an admin user to run the debugger.
This will only happen once per login session.
Admin username (dehayebuildbot):

At this point, `gdb` just "hangs" causing doctest timeouts.  The best solution might simply be to not run `gdb` at all on OS X, since it's never going to work anyway.
