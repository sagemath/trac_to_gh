There is currently no support for constructing the classic LP dual of a linear program (LP).
It would be very useful for various reasons, last but not the least constructing certificates of
optimality and of infeasibility of an LP.

I've actually have a module that does construct duals, but it is a "from scratch" implementation of linear programs and simplex method steps for educational reasons. It is not yet ready for inclusion in Sage, but I am likely to teach linear optimization this fall and plan to post it for review by the end of the term or earlier.

I hope it will be a solver backend rather than feature a yet another way to enter linear equations and inequalities into Sage. 

IMHO we need to initiate a major cleanup of these, as PPL backend, MILP backends, CVXOPT, and perhaps other places I am not aware of or don't recall each have its own way of accomplishing this task. And this certainly sucks from the userland point of view.

#7290, #18733, #18804 give access to dual information in various form.
Explicitly dualizing is already available for the textbook implementation of the simplex method, `InteractiveLPProblem`. 

That's why I'm marking this as "duplicate"

when I opened this I needed to construct Farkas certs of infeasibility, and that was (still is?) something that Sage could not do.
