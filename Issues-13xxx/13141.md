There is currently no support for constructing the classic LP dual of a linear program (LP).
It would be very useful for various reasons, last but not the least constructing certificates of
optimality and of infeasibility of an LP.

I've actually have a module that does construct duals, but it is a "from scratch" implementation of linear programs and simplex method steps for educational reasons. It is not yet ready for inclusion in Sage, but I am likely to teach linear optimization this fall and plan to post it for review by the end of the term or earlier.

I hope it will be a solver backend rather than feature a yet another way to enter linear equations and inequalities into Sage. 

IMHO we need to initiate a major cleanup of these, as PPL backend, MILP backends, CVXOPT, and perhaps other places I am not aware of or don't recall each have its own way of accomplishing this task. And this certainly sucks from the userland point of view.

Explicitly dualizing is already available for the textbook implementation of the simplex method, `InteractiveLPProblem`. 

That's why I'm marking this as "duplicate"

when I opened this I needed to construct Farkas certs of infeasibility, and that was (still is?) something that Sage could not do. 

(I have had a collection of small LP's that only PPL could solve properly, without scaling problems).
