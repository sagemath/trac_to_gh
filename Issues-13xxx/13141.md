There is currently no support for constructing the classic LP dual of a linear program (LP).
It would be very useful for various reasons, last but not the least constructing certificates of
optimality and of infeasibility of an LP.

I hope it will be a solver backend rather than feature a yet another way to enter linear equations and inequalities into Sage. 

IMHO we need to initiate a major cleanup of these, as PPL backend, MILP backends, CVXOPT, and perhaps other places I am not aware of or don't recall each have its own way of accomplishing this task. And this certainly sucks from the userland point of view.

I think this is a dup of #7290. And I think explicitly constructing dual LPs from a given LP is something that one wouldn't do with a solver. Rather set solver parameters that explicit request the primal or dual simplex method, when available. 
#7290, #18733, #18804 give access to dual information in various form.
Explicitly dualizing is already available for the textbook implementation of the simplex method, `InteractiveLPProblem`.
