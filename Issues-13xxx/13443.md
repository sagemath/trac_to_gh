Clean up the R spkg, also proof-of-concept for #13348.

**spkg**: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/r-2.14.0.p6.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/r-2.14.0.p6.spkg)

### r-2.14.0.p6 (Jeroen Demeyer, 10 September 2012)
* #13443: some clean up of spkg-install.
* Compile R with optimization (at -O2 level).
* No longer pass -I and -L options to gcc (see #13348).
* No longer use sage_fortran (see #13349).
* Re-enable parallel make install, which works now (see #13428).

Okay, the diff looks okay to this somewhat untrained eye.  A few questions that are doubtless not that important.
* I still get a lot of "make -jN disabled setting jobserver mode" and the like - but it seems like it's obeying the j.  ?
* I don't see the extra C flags that #13348 supposedly adds.  `gcc -std=gnu99 -I. -I. -I../../../src/include -I../../../src/include  -DHAVE_CONFIG_H   -fopenmp -fpic  -g -O2  -fvisibility=hidden -c pcre_xclass.c -o pcre_xclass.o` but probably I don't understand this.  

I had trouble on sage.math.  It installs, but:

I guess you mean

```
warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.
```

Anyway, that's really a bug in the Sage documentation:

```
MAKE="make -j8" make
```
is **not** the correct way to do things, one should use `MAKEFLAGS` instead (similar to the difference between `CC` and `CFLAGS`).  There is a work-around for this "mistake" when compiling using `spkg/install` (e.g. when issuing `make` from `SAGE_ROOT`), but not when installing using `./sage -i`.

In any case, it has nothing to do with this specific package.

See #14709 for the general problem, and #14706 where R is supposed to get upgraded (which alone doesn't fix the issue; we'd have to revert the changes to R's `spkg-install`, or patch R's `configure` accordingly).
