Clean up the R spkg, also proof-of-concept for #13348.

**spkg**: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/r-2.14.0.p6.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/r-2.14.0.p6.spkg)

### r-2.14.0.p6 (Jeroen Demeyer, 10 September 2012)
* #13443: some clean up of spkg-install.
* Compile R with optimization (at -O2 level).
* No longer pass -I and -L options to gcc (see #13348).
* No longer use sage_fortran (see #13349).
* Re-enable parallel make install, which works now (see #13428).

I guess you mean

```
warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.
```

Anyway, that's really a bug in the Sage documentation:

```
MAKE="make -j8" make
```
is **not** the correct way to do things, one should use `MAKEFLAGS` instead (similar to the difference between `CC` and `CFLAGS`).  There is a work-around for this "mistake" when compiling using `spkg/install` (e.g. when issuing `make` from `SAGE_ROOT`), but not when installing using `./sage -i`.

In any case, it has nothing to do with this specific package.

The compiler always looks for include files in `/usr/include`, so you never need to add `-I/usr/include`.  With #13348, `$SAGE_ROOT/local/include` becomes an automatic directory for includes, just like `/usr/include` already is.

<a id='comment:8'></a>Thanks for clarifying these things.  It all seems to work on Linux and (new) Mac, relevant tests and `SAGE_CHECK` pass.  I also tried some R stuff and it seems to be working.

I'm still a little uncomfortable giving final positive review just because of the big changes in the spkg-install, but it certainly all looks ok.  Maybe someone else can just make sure they like the syntax; R itself seems to be fine, and it looks like all relevant flags are still passed in the right ways.

See #14709 for the general problem, and #14706 where R is supposed to get upgraded (which alone doesn't fix the issue; we'd have to revert the changes to R's `spkg-install`, or patch R's `configure` accordingly).
