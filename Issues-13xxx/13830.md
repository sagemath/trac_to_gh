Just as the title says - this is a big duplication of code. The class ScatterPlot needs to go and we need to make `scatter_plot = point2d`.

Somewhere, about a year or two ago, I made the case somewhere to someone (I forget who) that we should just have line() and points().  Scatter plot *and* list plot should disappear (list plot should degenerate to either line() or points()).

So I'm glad we agree :).
