Just as the title says - this is a big duplication of code. The class ScatterPlot needs to go and we need to make `scatter_plot = point2d`.

I think the best plan is to make it an alias for `point2d` but keep the command for those coming from more data-oriented environments, who will be looking first for a command that talks about scatter plots and not think that `point` would be the \"right\" thing.  That also avoids the whole annoying deprecation process.\n\nI'm cc:ing Jason to see what he thinks (do \"owners\" get update emails?).",

I'm cc:ing Jason to see what he thinks (do "owners" get update emails?).
