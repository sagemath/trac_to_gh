Attachment [13031-cythonize-5.1.beta2.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket13031/13031-cythonize-5.1.beta2.patch) by @ohanar created at 2012-06-07 11:18:07

I attached an updated patch that
* is rebased on the final 5.1.beta2
* fixes a `ZeroDivisionError` that was preventing documentation from building
* more throughly cleans up `module_list.py` with the use of *s
* does other clean up with `module_list.py` since this patch will constantly need to be rebased with each development release (may as well clean up everything while we are at it)

That said, there is still some issue with Cython's cythonize, even using the old `module_list.py` you encounter the issue:

```
sage: cython('a = 5')
sage: a
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NameError: name 'a' is not defined
```

You'll find that tons of doctests fail, and frequently they are having `NameError`s like this (although they aren't necessarily calling Sage's cython function).

Ok, looks good to me and works well with 5.1.beta2, so I'm going to mark this back as needing review.

As expected, it needs to be rebased again on more recent betas, but since the changes to `module_list.py` is so massive, I'm not going to bother with rebasing until Jeroen decides which beta he would like to merge it in.

For whoever reviews this, please use 5.1.beta2 as a basis.

I just rebased on 5.2.beta1 since the dependency was merged into that release. However, in the process I discovered that cycache is not ready for primetime yet:

```
$ grep 'cdef class MonoDict:' sage -R
sage/sets/disjoint_set.c: * cdef class MonoDict:             # <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
sage/matrix/matrix_modn_dense_float.cpp: * cdef class MonoDict:             # <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
```
Neither of these modules changed between 5.1.beta2 and 5.2.beta1, but their dependencies changed, so there is some issue with the hashing that needs to be resolved.

For now I've disabled cycache, since it will be trivial to re-add once this ticket gets merged.

Yes, I think it's perfectly fine to disable cycache for now to get this in (as it will then be much easier to work on). Could you expound on what the issue was though? I'm not quite following your grep is trying to show...

Ok, rebased on 5.4.beta1.

The issue with sphinx seems to be because of the python functions defined in `sage/ext/gmp.pxi`. We probably shouldn't have any python function defined in pxi files anyway (since we currently aren't checking them for coverage or anything). There are python functions in other pxi files, but they aren't causing any issues for some reason (Robert, maybe you could explain why?).

Anyway, for right now I removed one of them (that wasn't being used anywhere), and I moved the other two to `sage/rings/integer.pyx` since that is where the sage library looks for them.

There is trouble with upgrading:

On rosemary (Linux RHEL 5.6 x86_64), after upgrading from sage-4.5.2, I get a failure during the installation of the Conway spkg:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./spkg-install", line 4, in <module>

The `.so` is recompiled from an old Cython C file which was

```
/* Generated by Cython 0.12.1 on Thu Aug 23 11:33:21 2012 */
```
while the old code would always run `cython` to re-generate the `.c` file.

Sounds like #4797...

I just found some important bug: it seems the dependencies on the files in `c_lib/` are no longer correctly handled.

```
$ touch devel/sage/c_lib/include/interrupt.h && ./sage -b
```
should rebuild all files depending on `interrupt.h` but this doesn't work anymore.

In sage-5.9.beta3, one gets instead lots of lines like

There are also reports on sage-devel that `sage -clone` was broken in 5.9 (and later), now rebuilding the whole Sage library.  Not sure what exactly introduced that though.

Looks like just the fact that `sage-clone` doesn't copy `$SAGE_SRC/.cython_version` causes this...

(where `$SAGE_SRC` is [meanwhile] `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage`)




Also (but this doesn't seem to be the cause), `sage-clone` does not (or no longer, presumably at least since a while) copy Cython-generated *header files* (`*.h`), as these do **not** contain a comment on the first line stating that they were generated by Cython, so the following doesn't work for them:

```python
print "Copying over all Cython auto-generated .c, .cpp and .h files..."
def cpdir(src, dest):
    if not os.path.isdir(dest):
        return
    for F in os.listdir(src):
        if os.path.isdir(src + '/' + F):
            cpdir(src + '/' + F, dest + '/' + F)
        else:
            ext = os.path.splitext(F)[-1]
            if ext in ['.h', '.c', '.cpp']:
                if 'Cython' in open(src + '/' + F).readline():
                    os.link(src + '/' + F, dest + '/' +F)
                    os.utime(dest + '/' +F, None)

cpdir(os.path.abspath('sage/sage'), os.path.abspath(branch + '/sage'))
```

Furthermore, the above code doesn't copy the Cython-generated files from `devel/sage/ext/interpreters/`, so these also get rebuilt, but that goes back to at least Sage 5.8 (unless I'm missing something).




If I add copying `.cython_version` to `sage-clone`, besides the above-mentioned re-"cythonizing"[sic!], many (if not all?) Python modules get re-byte-compiled, too, for whatever reason... (This doesn't seem to be related to Cython, but maybe I'm just missing something here as well.)
