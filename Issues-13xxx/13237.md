Upgrade Singular to [version 3-1-5](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/index.php/news/release-of-singular-3-1-5.html) (released 12 July 2012).

Upstream bugs discovered:
- [#437: negate() should be NTL::negate()](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/437) (upstream needs testers)
- [#438: Singular configured --without-debug doesn't build](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/438) ("fixed" by removing the option)
- [#439: factorize() returns wrong constant](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/439) (fixed upstream, but not in a stable release)
- [#440: Factoring over a finite field returns reducible factor](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/440) (fixed upstream, but not in a stable release)
- [#441: Factoring over a finite field sometimes returns wrong result](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/441) (fixed upstream, but not in a stable release)
- [#443: configure should check for nanosleep in -lrt](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/443) (fixed upstream, but not in a stable release)

This new version fixes #13129, #12918, #12928, #12846, #12089, #13344.

**Apply** [attachment: 13237_singular_3_1_5.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13237/13237_singular_3_1_5.patch.gz) and [attachment: 13237_tests.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13237/13237_tests.patch.gz) to the Sage library.

New **spkg**: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/singular-3-1-5.p1.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/singular-3-1-5.p1.spkg)

### singular-3-1-5.p1 (Simon King, 29 August 2012)
* Trac #13237: add patch install_table.patch

### singular-3-1-5.p0 (Jeroen Demeyer, Alexander Dreyer, 10 August 2012)
* Trac #13237: Upgrade to version 3-1-5.
* Removed patches which are now upstreamed:
   - patches/Singular.Makefile.in.shared.patch
   - patches/Singular.configure.patch
   - patches/factory.GNUmakefile.in.patch
   - patches/factory_configure
   - patches/make_parallel.patch
   - patches/os_x_ppc.patch
* In spkg-install, simplify apply_patches(), automatically apply all
  patches in patches/*.patch, move conditional patches to
  patches/conditional
* Rename some patches such that they all have the extension '.patch'
* Put the two patches for SAGE_DEBUG (Singular.Makefile.in.debug.patch
  and kernel.Makefile.in.debug.patch) into one file
  conditional/sage_debug.patch.
* Add several patches (see above):
   - NTL_negate.patch
   - singular_trac_439.patch
   - singular_trac_440.patch
   - singular_trac_441.patch
   - singular_trac_443.patch
   - sage_trac_12089.patch
   - slibdir.patch
* When building Singular, don't first make install and then
  make install-nolns. Instead, only do the latter.
* Don't create the LIB->lib symlink, which is no longer needed.
* In spkg-install, remove distclean() step; merge clean_headers() and
  part of the old distclean() into remove_old_version().
* Only unset LD on Darwin.
* Remove the unsetting of TMPDIR (bug fixed upstream).
* Do not override user-set CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS.
* Echo all error messages to stderr instead of stdout.
* Fix various ./configure options and remove some unsupported options.
* Always configure --with-debug, as --without-debug doesn't work, see
  http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/438
* Don't create sage_singular symlink, which wasn't used anyway.
* Replace the $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/Singular script by a symlink.
* Remove workaround for GCC-4.0.x on Darwin (obsolete by the GCC spkg).
* Fix formatting of spkg-install (consistent indentation, no TABs).

The unrecognized options should be addressed I think.

No idea how to interpret *"`factory.h` not found! Install factory before building libfac!"*, as the build succeeded.

*"Building without python support"* can safely be ignored I guess, as we use our own Cython wrappers.

I assume that this is work in progress (i.e., you haven't tried to fix doctest errors yet).

Anyway, here's what I got on Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS x86_64, with Sage 5.2.rc0 and GCC 4.7.0:

```
The following tests failed:

	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/doc/en/constructions/polynomials.rst # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/function_field/function_field.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx # 3 doctests failed
	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/calculus/wester.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/libs/singular/function.pyx # 2 doctests failed
	sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/combinat/words/words.py # 0 doctests failed
```
(The last failure was a segfault with a large traceback IIRC.  Somewhat surprisingly successfully compiled with `-O3`, although many if not most compile commands override this by `-O2`; looks as if they use `CPPFLAGS` *instead of* `CXXFLAGS` in some parts.) 

Let me know in case you're interested in further output; I guess you can reproduce most of the errors.

So far I only tested the files that previously failed for me (with the new spkg and the Sage library patch applied).

I get the same `list()` errors (although prepended by some debug output it seems, before the doctest error is printed), and sporadically the `f.factor()` error -- with **varying** results:

(For me it's line 3910; presumably due to some other patch.  The first variant seems to occur more often.  All tests run sequentially, FWIW.)


P.S.: Run 100 times from the shell, the test failed 51 times.

Just for the record:  Did pass `ptestlong` (with a bit of luck, cf. the "random" factoring) with Sage 5.2[.rc0] (Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS x86_64, FSF GCC 4.7.0, with `-O3`, see above).

Patch applies to Sage 5.3.beta0 as well (a few lines offset, never mind).

Only just noticed that old installations get removed before we even attempt to build the new one; this should in general only be done if the build succeeded.

(Haven't yet closely looked at [the changes to] `spkg-install`.)

yes, I can confirm that installing this spkg on MacOSX one gets Singular LIB files into `SAGELOCAL/lib/`, as well as in the right place, i.e. `SAGELOCAL/share/singular/`, which is certainly not what one would want.

It think the best solution would be to replace `$MAKE` by "$MAKE slibdir=$SAGE_LOCAL/share/singular" in the spkg.

Just in case (won't have time tomorrow), I was so free to propose a changed spkg here: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/singular-3-1-5.p0.spkg 

As before, the changes are not committed yet. Also I haven't changes the URL in the description, as Jeroen might continue with other fixes.

The changes are as follows (for review):

Good suggestion, however #12089, #13344 are about *compiling* Singular so I don't think we should add a regression test for that (the real test is just checking that any upgrades don't break the build).  Then #12846 is also tricky because it is about a computation which randomly runs slow or gets stuck.

We could test existence of *.lib files in the LIB directory for #13344, or of $SAGE_LOCAL/LIB directory.
The problem is critical on Cygwin where LIB resolves to lib and messes PyOpenSSL compilation (although that package won't be built anymore soon), but was also present on every platform.

I agree that #12089 cannot really be tested, except for the fact that Singular succeeded to build.
