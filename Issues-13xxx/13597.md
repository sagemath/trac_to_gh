The [section in the tutorial on standalone scripts](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/programming.html#standalone-python-sage-scripts) needs some fixing. It suggests writing a script starting with

```/usr/bin/env sage -python

import sys
from sage.all import *
...
```
But on sage.math.washington.edu, and probably on other linux systems, `/usr/bin/env` doesn't handle multiple arguments very well. I think that replacing the first line with `#!/usr/bin/env sage` should work.

This doesn't fix what is in the description, which is fixed already, I guess.  What I don't understand is why you remove the `-python`, since otherwise there is no need for

```
from sage.all import *
```
is there?  Maybe I'm missing something.
