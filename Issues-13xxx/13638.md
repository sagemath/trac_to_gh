The adjacency of rays in polyhedra isn't right. This impacts some corner cases in plotting 2-d non-compact polytopes:

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1)], rays=[(0,1)]).plot()

This is bizzarre. Are you saying that if you, say, have a 3-D cube "with the lid removed", i.e. extended infinitely into direction z, say, then all the 4 rays present will be adjacent?  This seems to contradict what the lines 995-999 of the same file say, too.

I'd assume that you have the usual decomposition of a polyhedron into the sum of a subspace,  a pointed cone,  and a polytope, right? But all the rays then come from a pointed cone, and there is no way to get TWO parallel rays then...

How about:

If the V-representation of the polygon contains only vertices and a single ray, then every V-representation object has exact two adjacent ones. The cyclic order is unique up to reversal of direction and choice of starting point. 

If the V-representation of the polygon contains vertices and two rays, then the two rays are not adjacent to each other. The cyclic order then starts with one of the rays and ends with the other ray.

This implies that the two extreme rays of a pointed cone in `R^2` non-adjacent.

Did you mean to say *more than 1 vertex*, rather than *vertices*?

 
Why does it only talk about polygons? What about bigger dimensions?

In my book, rays and edges are of the same dimension. One cannot normally even talk about adjacency between rays and vertices, yet you do (lines 974-9 of `geometry/polyhedron/base.py`).
Although you can certainly talk about incidence between them, by inclusion, as usual.

the classical definition of a face of a convex set B is that it is the intersection of a supporting hyperplane with B.
And the dimension of the face is the topological dimension of the intersection. This way it certainly does not make sense to talk about adjacency beween vertices and rays, as they are objects of different *type* (i.e., dimension).

No, you certainly do not want to squash your affine space. You want to add the hyperplane at infinity. Then the rays  have two vertices, one of which at infinity. (And parallel rays intersect at infinity, which might make sense for your purposes, or not...)

Regarding lines, there are two schools, one of which just forbids full lines in convex sets in `RP^n` all together.

When you say "we have", do you mean "I have" ?

Well, please do as you want. But I will not be happy with any ticket if the bot is not fully green.

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A17):

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1)], rays=[(0,1)])
sage: P.adjacency_matrix?
...
Definition:	P.adjacency_matrix(self)
Docstring:
       This is an alias for "vertex_adjacency_matrix()"
...
```

this seems to indicate that only vertices can be adjacent, no?
Another very confusing thing is

```
Two V-representation objects are adjacent if they generate a 
 	975	        (1-dimensional) face of the polyhedron. Examples are two 
 	976	        vertices of a polytope that bound an edge, or a vertex and a 
 	977	        ray of a polyhedron that generate a bounding half-line of the 
 	978	        polyhedron. 
```
in `geometry/polyhedron/base.py`. 


IMHO the whole documentation for the adjacency is a mess. I am unable to make sense out of it, and the link to PPL docs (which aren't clear to me at all) is not helping much, either.  Please, please, define what is meant by "ray" somewhere. I just don't get it...

I've expanded the documentation for V-representation objects and for the adjacency rules. Please let me know if anything is still unclear.

In order to have clearer examples I added #11763 to the dependencies, this ticket improves output and introduces the `polyhedron.faces(dim)` method which is useful if you have to talk about one-dimensional faces.

The patchbot has the wrong order of patches for #11763 for some reason, which is why it fails. I think it fails to parse the formatting in the description.
