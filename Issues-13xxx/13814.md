`LazyFamily.__eq__` occasionally returns false positives, because it only compares function names, not values. This can lead to subtle bugs later, like this one:

```python
fun = lambda i:i
fam1 = LazyFamily((0,1),fun)
fun = lambda i:i+6
fam2 = LazyFamily((0,1),fun)
fam3 = LazyFamily((2,3),fun)
d1 = DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets((fam1,fam3))
d2 = DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets((fam2,fam3))
for u in (fam1,fam2,fam3,d1,d2):
    print list(u)
```

This gives

```python
[0, 1]
[6, 7]
[8, 9]
[0, 1, 8, 9]
[0, 1, 8, 9]
```

because Sage thinks `fam1 == fam2`. The behaviour can be fixed by setting

```python
def noteq(self,other):
    return False
LazyFamily.__eq__ = noteq
```

I think `__eq__` should _never_ give false positives for classes that might be hashed. In this case `LazyFamily.__eq__` should 

* test function equality if the index sets are finite of the same size
* return `False` if one of the indexing sets is infinite

<a id='comment:2'></a>I've attached a patch that fixes the equality test for lazy families. 

It leads to testsuite failures in `disjoint_union_enumerated_sets.py`: these failures are due to pickling problems that were hidden by the deficiency of the old `__eq__` implementation.

The TestSuite failures would probably be fixed if `_test_pickling` would check for
   {{{
   not (f != loads(dumps(f)))
   }}}
rather than
   {{{
   f == loads(dumps(f))
   }}}
I'll suggest this in a different ticket.

Hi!

Replying to [ticket:13814 cnassau]:
> `LazyFamily.__eq__` occasionally returns false positives, because it only compares function names, not values. 


Yikes. This is indeed definitely a bug!

Thanks for catching it, and sorry for commenting on it after you have
implemented a first proposal of solution.

> I think `__eq__` should _never_ give false positives for classes that might be hashed.


+1!

> In this case `LazyFamily.__eq__` should

>
>    * test function equality if the index sets are finite of the same size
>    * return `False` if one of the indexing sets is infinite


I would much prefer to stick as much as possible to the default
equality rule for composite objects: namely to compare their
components for equality. A Family is composed of an indexing set `I`
and a mapping `f`. Thus, ideally, two families should be equal if
their indexing sets are equal and their mappings are equal.  How two
sets (infinite or not) compare for equality is not Family's decision
to take.

Now, we have the problem that comparing mappings is delicate; first
because two functions with the same code are not considered as equal,
and anyway because two functions with different code might implement
the same mapping, but that's undecidable.

So at this point it seems to me that the best approximation would be
as follow:

- For comparing two FiniteFamily's, compare the underlying indexing
  set and dictionary for equality (the mapping has already been
  computed on all the indexing set, so we might as well use it, even
  though this comparison will have a cost).

- For comparing other families: test whether the two indexing sets and
  the two mappings compare to equal.

Potential issue: that upon pickling unpickling we get back an equal
object.

Thanks again for investigating this,

Best,
                              Nicolas

``__eq__`` and ``__ne__`` are supposed to be implemented consistently; so
_test_pickling is allowed to rely on this assumption. If the
assumption fails, that's an equality bug which should be fixed in
``__eq__/__ne__`` and be tested in ``_test_equal`` (whenever possible).

I think this is also how my patch implements this (which does not quite follow the description in my original submission). 

In my patch function equality is tested like this:
 
* finite family: brute force check of all values
* infinite family: check if function objects are identical

It occured to me that we should also try this:

* comparison of the pickle-string of the function objects
* testing an initial finite slice of the values 

I believe functions with the same pickle-representation are guaranteed to be equal, even if their pickled-function might not be usable (see failure of U3 doctests in my patch).

Well, I think it __is__ consistent to have

   {{{
      sage: LazyFamily(Integers(),lambda i:i) == LazyFamily(Integers(),lambda i:1*i)
      False
      sage: LazyFamily(Integers(),lambda i:i) != LazyFamily(Integers(),lambda i:1*i)
      False
   }}}

In my reading this conforms to the standard python requirements: 

   hashing only requires `__hash__` and `__eq__` in 
   `http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__`

The document also says

   There are no implied relationships among the comparison operators. The truth of x==y does not imply that x!=y is false.

Cheers,
Christian

There is a slight difference: I prefer the distinction to be based on
the class, namely whether we are manipulating two FiniteFamily's or
not.

By the way, please use:

```
    for i in self.set:
```

rather than:

```
    lst = list(self.set)
    for i in lst
```


> It occured to me that we should also try this:

This sounds reasonable, but needs to be heavily tested for all sorts
of function objects.

>    * testing an initial finite slice of the values


I can see the point! Still, I'd rather stick to a behavior that
depends only on the class, rather than on some magic constant.
Otherwise, this is likely to cause bugs that won't be caught by
testing since they will only show up for large objects.

Cheers,
               Nicolas

This has some really bad consequences if (as I believe) we're __not__ able to reliably test functions for equality. We would then have to live with

   {{{
   sage: LazyFamily([1,2,3], lambda i:i) == LazyFamily([1,2,3], lambda i:i)
   False
   }}}

I would find it better to use a brute force check for those finite index sets that implement a `list()` method:

   {{{
   try:
       for i in self.set.list():
           if self.function(i) != other.function(i):
               return False
       return True
   except NotImplementedError:
       pass
   }}}

As noted in `src/categories/enumerated_sets.py` a set can choose to not implement `list` if it is probably too large to be useful.

The idea was to use `self.set.list()` as explained above, because then the exhaustive check would be skipped for sets that are too big and know about it.

I've changed my mind: this is not at all a good idea: in my tests an `unpickle_function(lambda i:i)` includes a reference to the doctest where it was defined. That's not good at all if we want to test for function equality... for similar reasons it seems bad to use the bytecode disassembly from the dis module...

Could you live with the `self.set.list()` suggestion?

That is perfectly fine for me: if the caller asked explicitly for a
lazy family, then (s)he should expect the comparison to be lazy, and
thus cheap but incomplete. If she is willing to pay the price of
computing the function on all indices, then a FiniteFamily is what she
wants.

> As noted in `src/categories/enumerated_sets.py` a set can choose to not implement `list` if it is probably too large to be useful.


Yup. But there are a lot of sets, like Permutations(n) that can be
very small or very large, and such sets cannot make a good decision.
At the end of the day, it's better to take the decision upon building
the family (by asking explicitly for a lazy family or not).

That's right for Python. However Sage is more stringent about this and
requires == and != to be consistent. Hmm, I am not sure this is
documented anywhere though. Basically the idea is that we already have
trouble maintaining a consistent specification and implementation for
==, so we can't really afford to also maintain a possibly different
specification for != ...

Do you mind post here a quick selection of typical
doctests / pickling failures? That will be a good source for me and
others to think about what the right approach shall be.

That's definitely good news.

Should I remove the previous patch? Then we won't have to specify
which patch to apply.

A couple questions:

Would there be a problem to just compare the functions with:

```
   self.function == other.function
```
Rather than doing the check for is and then for eq?

I am surprised about your comment about Permutations not being
picklable. This works for me:

```
  sage: P = Permutations(3) 
  sage: P == Permutations(3)
  True
  sage: P == loads(dumps(P))
  True
```

Could the hash be calculated using both the hash of the indexing set
and the function?

Please take the occasion to rewrite `WARNING` into
`.. WARNING::` (see the developers manual for the exact syntax).

Where is ``!=`` implemented?

This is really an issue with `sage.misc.fpickle`: the function "``n -> Permutations(n)``" can be pickled, but the unpickled version has forgotten the default value of the second argument of `Permutations(n,k)`:

```python
   sage: f = Permutations 
   sage: from sage.misc.fpickle import pickle_function, unpickle_function 
   sage: g = unpickle_function(pickle_function(f)) 
   sage: print f(5) 
   Standard permutations of 5
   sage: print g(5) 
   Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
   TypeError: Permutations() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)
```

> Could the hash be calculated using both the hash of the indexing set
> and the function?


I'm now using the sum of both hashes.

> Please take the occasion to rewrite `WARNING` into

Fixed.

> Where is ``!=`` implemented?


That's a good question: ``grep`` could find a handful of `__ne__` in the Sage code base, but none that would be a candidate for `LazyFamily.__ne__`. The python manual clearly says that one should define `__ne__` if `__eq__` is defined; that appears not to be the case in class `SageObject`, so my guess is that Python is using a default implementation.

By the way, both `Parent` and `SageObject` seem to test the consistency of `__eq__` and `__ne__` in the test suite.

Cheers,\\
Christian

Thanks for your changes!

Done.

I see!

Yes, this is definitely a misfeature with sage.misc.fpickle. It should
be fixed to use standard pickling when it can (e.g. for a function
defined in a library). And it should return something that can be
unpickled with a plain loads. And, as mentioned in the code of family
it should be registered to copy_reg so that it would be called
automatically by dumps without needing to pollute one's code (like
family) with it. Would you be so kind as to open a ticket about this
if there is not already one?

In order to separate the two issues, what about changing the failing
examples to use Partitions (which pickles smoothly), rather than
making it more complicated with some workaround that won't be needed
hopefully sometime soon, and is not vital for most users?

Ok. Then you may want to explicitly implement __ne__ as not __eq__,
just to be sure.

That's good :-)

Actually, `Partitions` doesn't really pickle very well either:
   {{{#!python
   sage: # first attempt
   sage: f=Family(NonNegativeIntegers(),Partitions) ; f
   Lazy family (Partitions(i))_{i in Non negative integers}
   sage: loads(dumps(f))
   Traceback (most recent call last)
   ...
   ValueError: Cannot pickle code objects from closures

   sage: # second attempt
   sage: f=Family(NonNegativeIntegers(),lambda n:Partitions(n))
   sage: g=loads(dumps(f))
   sage: f[5]
   Partitions of the integer 5
   sage: g[5]
   Traceback (most recent call last)
   ...
   NameError: global name 'Partitions' is not defined
   }}} 

I can use `Simplex` for a smooth example:

   {{{#!python
   sage: f=Family(NonNegativeIntegers(),Simplex)
   sage: g=loads(dumps(f))
   sage: f[5]
   (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
   sage: g[5]
   (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
   }}}

I'll try to prepare a new patch tomorrow.

Cheers, \\
Christian

Oops, sorry; I had forgotten that Partitions was fixed, but only in
