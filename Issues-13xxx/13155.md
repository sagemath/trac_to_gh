The dimension of an ideal cannot be negative (it would be mathematically incoherent). Yet, in SAGE, it is possible to create Boolean Ideals of dimension -1..... 

```
sage: n=11
sage: R = BooleanPolynomialRing(n, 'x')
sage: R2 = PolynomialRing(GF(2), n, 'x')
sage: I = ideal([ R(f) for f in sage.rings.ideal.Cyclic(R2, n).gens() ])
sage: I.dimension()
-1
```

In fact, all the BooleanPolynomialIdeal's should have dimension zero. Thus I suggest to overload the dimension() method to just return zero....

Looks good except for one minor detail

```
TESTS:: 
    # check that Ticket #13155 is solved 
```

should be rewritten as:

```
TESTS:

Check that :trac:`13155` is solved::

    sage: ...
```

So there's an empty line between `::` and the Sage tests (which I believe is required) and it uses the <code>:trac:\`foo\`</code> directive.
