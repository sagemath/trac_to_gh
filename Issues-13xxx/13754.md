In the plot

```
plot(sin(3*pi*x)/sin(pi*x), (x,-5,5))
```
there are some artifacts at `-5` and `5`, namely a straight vertical line going to the top of the plot. They shouldn't be there. This also happens plotting the same function in the intervals `(-9,9), (-10,10), (-15,15), (-17,17), (-18,18)`. In the plot 

```
plot(sin(3*pi*x)/sin(pi*x), (x,-7,7))
```
something similar occurs, but the line goes down. This also happens for the interval `(-14,14)`. For other interval boundaries than the mentioned (integers from -19 to 19) this does not happen. You can even mix, e.g. taking an interval `(-7,5)`.

It also happens using functions `sin(m*pi*x)/sin(pi*x)` with `m` different from `3` (tested with `5`).
