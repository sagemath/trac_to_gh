I think this should work:

```
sage: l = var('lambda')
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
...
ValueError: The name "lambda" is not a valid Python identifier.
```

This is what I usually do, and it *does* work:

```
sage: l = SR('lambda')
sage: show(l)
```

The reason to use the 'lambda' name is for the magic latex conversion.

Close as "won't fix"? I don't see another option.

Agreed.

Another way to get a variable that is typeset as `\lambda` in latex mode is

```
sage: var('l', latex_name='\lambda')
l
sage: latex(l)
\lambda
```

Whoops, I always thought that this avoided creating a global:

```
sage: x = var('y')
sage: y
y
```

Good to know! Sorry for the noise.

Do we have that in the documentation?  I feel like we have something about `lambda` in there, but having a couple ways to do it would be interesting.
