I propose a patch on combinat to coerce elements like:
Let F[2,1,3] be an element of the fundamental basis of the FreeQuasiSymmetric Hopf algebra (FQSym) and G an other basis.
sage: G(F[2,1,3].coproduct()) 
G[] # G[2, 1, 3] + G[1] # G[1, 2] + G[2, 1] # G[1] + G[2, 1, 3] # G[]

Some one may be must move my code (in Categories i think or anywhere)...
