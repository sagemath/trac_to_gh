Now I see why I didn't understand this!   Here's what I get from `T.plot_histogram?`:

```
Definition:     T.plot_histogram(self, bins, normalize=50, **kwds=True)
Docstring:
       Return histogram plot of this time series with given number of
       bins.
    
```
I couldn't parse that for some reason (though in retrospect it's obvious) and so I assumed `normalize` had a default of `False`.  But of course with `True` this will happen.  So in fact we probably didn't need the import of `Graphics` anyway, which presumably saves a few microseconds somewhere.

Okay, needs review.  I added a doctest to check that `aspect_ratio` is passed correctly, which is good to do anyway since with `normalize=False` that might be useful sometimes.
