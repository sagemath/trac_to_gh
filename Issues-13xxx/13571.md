In the documentation, http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/matrix/constructor.html,

it states that matrices can pass in callable objects, though there is no example or test of this here.  Is there documentation at least showing a test of this functionality?  If not, it probably should be added, if not for the end user, at least to ensure it doesn't break.

In the meanwhile, any tip on getting a matrix like:
`
['apple', 'frog']

[[3,2]   , 3      ]`

Component: **PLEASE CHANGE**

<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

It gives examples of passing in a callable object:

```

sage: m = matrix(QQ, 3, 3, lambda i, j: i+j); m
[0 1 2]
[1 2 3]
[2 3 4]
sage: m = matrix(3, lambda i,j: i-j); m
[ 0 -1 -2]
[ 1  0 -1]
[ 2  1  0]
sage: matrix(QQ,2,3,lambda x, y: x+y)
[0 1 2]
[1 2 3]
sage: matrix(QQ,3,2,lambda x, y: x+y)
[0 1]
[1 2]
[2 3]
```

It is impossible to get a **matrix** like 

```
['apple', 'frog']
[[3,2]  , 3     ]
```
since a matrix requires that the entries be elements of a ring (so things like multiplication and addition are defined).  You could either use a list of lists or a numpy array like

```
sage: import numpy as np
sage: a = np.array([['apple', 'frog'],[[3,2], 3]], dtype=object); a
array([[apple, frog],
       [[3, 2], 3]], dtype=object)
sage: a[1,0]
[3, 2]
sage: a.transpose()
array([[apple, [3, 2]],
       [frog, 3]], dtype=object)
```
