```
Currently, elements of padic extensions do not provide a `residue()` method:

```
sage: sage: K=Qp(3)
sage: K(3).residue()
0
sage: sage: R.<a> = K[]
sage: sage: L.<a> = K.extension(a^2+1)
sage: a.residue()
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.padics.padic_ZZ_pX_CR_element.pAdicZZpXCRElement' object has no attribute 'residue'
```

The attached branch fixes this (at least for the easy case where the optional parameter `absprec=1`).
