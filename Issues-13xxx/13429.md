Keywords: giac, interface

eval_line in the giac interface might miss the argument restart_if_needed.

The error can be seen when converting with big matrices to giac. 

So I add also a doc test to see it.

NB: The other interfaces like gp,gap,axiom,maple,mathematica got the corresponding change between 4.8 and 5.0
