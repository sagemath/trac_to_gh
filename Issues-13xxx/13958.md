With

```
K = QQ[sqrt(2)]
I = K.ideal(2).factor()[0][0]
I = I*I; I.ngens()
4
I = I*I; I.ngens()
16
I = I*I; I.ngens()
256
I = I*I; I.ngens()
65536
```
the first three squarings are fast, the fourth starts to be a bit slower, and if you try a fifth, it will take up all your memory.
The reason is that that the number of generators is multiplied with every multiplication and never reduced back to 1 or 2 with gens_reduced or gens_two, as you can see from the output.

Addition suffers from the same problem, but the result is less dramatic

```
sage: I = K.ideal(2).factor()[0][0]
sage: I = I+I; I.ngens()
4
sage: I = I+I; I.ngens()
8
sage: I = I+I; I.ngens()
16
sage: I = I+I; I.ngens()
32
sage: I = I+I; I.ngens()
64
sage: I = I+I; I.ngens()
128
sage: I = I+I; I.ngens()
256
```

Solution: implement `__mul__` for `NumberFieldFractionalIdeal` (instead of inheriting the function from Ideal) and use gens_two or gens_reduced before giving the output. Or wrap functions from pari.

I did some profiling and from this it seems that gens_two is faster then pari_hnf. 

See: http://pastebin.com/aejaKMds for timings with principal ideals and http://pastebin.com/HU2DExLH for timings with ideals generated by multiple random elements (where the amount or random elements changes).

The documentation says that gens_two runs in randomized polynomial time (but does not say anything about the degree of the polynomial).
