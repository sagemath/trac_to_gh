This looks good. Several comments:

* Minor grammar error: "This routine will return ``True`` if the matrix is square, symmetric or Hermitian, and meeting the condition..." should be "and *meets* the condition...".

* for the matrices that aren't positive definite, maybe you can include a doctest that has a vector for which `v^T * M * v` is negative.

* for the matrices that *are* pos. def., maybe create a random vector in the base ring and see if you get something positive. I'm thinking:

```
sage: v = vector([C.random_element(), C.random_element(), C.random_element(), C.random_element()])
sage: v.conjugate() * A * v > 0
True
```

Thanks, Dan.  Standalone "v2" patch fixes the grammar.  For matrices that are positive definite the doctest now includes the (positive) determinants of the leading principal submatrices.  For those that are not positive definite there is an example vector violating the defining condition (which was a **great** suggestion).
