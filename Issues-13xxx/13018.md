This looks good. Several comments:

* Minor grammar error: "This routine will return ``True`` if the matrix is square, symmetric or Hermitian, and meeting the condition..." should be "and *meets* the condition...".

* for the matrices that aren't positive definite, maybe you can include a doctest that has a vector for which `v^T * M * v` is negative.

* for the matrices that *are* pos. def., maybe create a random vector in the base ring and see if you get something positive. I'm thinking:

```
sage: v = vector([C.random_element(), C.random_element(), C.random_element(), C.random_element()])
sage: v.conjugate() * A * v > 0
True
```

For those that are not positive definite there is an example vector violating the defining condition (which was a **great** suggestion).
