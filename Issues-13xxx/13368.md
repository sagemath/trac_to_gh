```
The following two plots

```
plot(x, xmin=1, xmax=-1)
plot(x).show(xmin=1, xmax=-1)
```
give different outputs. In particular, the plot comes up empty in the
former one. This seems to be a conscious decision taken in #5651. The main
line seems to be this line in `sage/plot/plot.py` and similar lines in
several other files.

```
    G_kwds = Graphics._extract_kwds_for_show(kwds, ignore=['xmin', 'xmax'])
```
Is there a reason for this? Should this be "fixed?"

One data point is an email I got today (unrelated to Sage development, just use) asking why

```
plot(1/x,xmin=-5,xmax=5)
```
didn't result as expected.  So maybe we should do more than ignore them, but raise an error or something...

NO!  My belief is that this is a typo.  Notice that in #5651, the places where this is ignored are ALL some kind of contour or "rectangular" plot, except for plot.py, but then plot_field.py does *not* have this, even though it's this kind of plot.  In fact, we probably should support things like

```
sage: plot(x,(x,1,5),xmin=2)
```
since we might want to keep the data but not show it.

As of 7.3.beta8 evaluating `plot(x, xmin=-1, xmax=1)` and `plot(1/x,xmin=-5,xmax=5,ymin=-5,ymax=5)` both produce the expected graphs.

Evaluating `plot(x, xmin=1, xmax=-1)` with a reversed domain does not produce a plot. Evaluating`plot(1/x,xmin=-5,xmax=5,ymin=5,ymax=-5)` with an inverted range flips the plot upside down.

Shouldn't this ticket be first about a sanity check on domain and range? Is there a good reason to allow reversal and inversion?

> Shouldn't this ticket be first about a sanity check on domain and range? Is there a good reason to allow reversal and inversion?

A good reason to allow flipped axis is to have axes that are decreasing instead of increasing. It is already possible by using `plot(...).show(xmax=-1,xmin=1)`. This ticket was about making the behavior of plot *consistent* with what `plot(...).show()` does.

He's a solution to this problem. Part of the reason the plots were empty is that the function `setup_for_eval_on_grid()` in `plot/misc.py` outputs plotting steps as an absolute value, not a signed value. I've removed that and modified the doctests accordingly, but six other plotting files use that function in addition to `plot.py`.

All plotting doctests pass and documentation all builds. I scanned all seven plotting documentation HTML files that use `setup_for_eval_on_grid()` and didn't see anything strange, but other eyes need to look at them closely.

Adding Javier to cc list since he's been working on plotting examples and might spot something wrong.
