`sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial` provides an implementation for `_xgcd`. This implementation is not correct for polynomials over arbitrary rings. Therefore it should be moved to `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element_generic.Polynomial_generic_field`.

The way it currently is, doesn't cause any bugs (except for one which already has a stopgap warning) because only elements of a PID call the `_xgcd` method.

 `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial` provides an implementation for `_xgcd`. This implementation is not correct for polynomials over arbitrary rings. Therefore it should be moved to `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element_generic.Polynomial_generic_field`.
 
 The way it currently is, doesn't cause any bugs (except for one which already has a stopgap warning) because only elements of a PID call the `_xgcd` method.
