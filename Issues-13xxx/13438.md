sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial}}} provides an implementation for {{{_xgcd}}}. This implementation is not correct for polynomials over arbitrary rings. Therefore it should be moved to {{{sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element_generic.Polynomial_generic_field}}}.

The way it currently is, doesn't cause any bugs (except for one which already has a stopgap warning) because only elements of a PID call the {{{_xgcd}}} method.

Two minor things I'd like to see changed:
- The `INPUT:` bullet is indented one to many times
- Change the `OUTPUT:` to

```
Polynomials ``g``, ``u``, and ``v`` such that ``g = u * self + v * other``. 
```
Thanks.
