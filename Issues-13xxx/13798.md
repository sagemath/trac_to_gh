Leonard Carlitz has introduced q-analogues of Bernoulli numbers in 

* Carlitz, L: q-Bernoulli numbers and polynomials. Duke Math J. 15, 987–1000 (1948)

* Carlitz, L: q-Bernoulli and Eulerian numbers. Trans Am Soc. 76, 332–350 (1954)

These q-Bernoulli numbers are fractions in q, that give the usual Bernoulli numbers when q=1.

A patch to compute them is proposed below. Maybe someone could make it more efficient ?

I believe the code implements Carlitz's definition accurately.  It's difficult to see how it could easily be speeded up.  

Just a few improvements are needed, I think.

* As in the code for classical Bernoulli numbers, the definition ought to start with the lines

  ```
        from sage.rings.all import Integer
        m = Integer(m)
  ```
  This allows the argument to be an `int`, which is compatible with `gaussian_binomial`, letting users write things like

  ```
  [q_bernoulli(i) for i in range(13)]
  ```
  and gives a less confusing error message for

  ```
  q_bernoulli(1/2)
```

* To make `q_bernoulli` even more compatible with `gaussian_binomial` it would be worth having a second argument, defaulting to a the polynomial generator `q`.  [Actually `q_binomial(4, 2, 1)` raises a `ZeroDivisionError` at present.  I'll raise a ticket for this.]

* It would be worth citing Carlitz's 1948 paper in the docstring.

* I would write "q-analogue of the Bernoulli numbers" (one analogue, many numbers).

I have made some corrections and enhancements.

I would prefer not to add the optional choice of the value of q. Indeed, in the computation, one has to divide by `q^n -1` for many n. One would therefore had to ensure that q is not a root of unity. I prefer to have a procedure that clearly work with an indeterminate q.

Note that my principal aim is speed.

Just a few trivia:

```
Bernoulli number `B_n`
```
needs to be 

```
Bernoulli number `B_m`
```

I think "rational function of" would be better than "fraction in", and then "function is" rather than "fraction is".

For compatibility with `gaussian_binomial` it would be preferable if the optional argument was called `q` rather than `p`.
