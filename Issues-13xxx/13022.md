If you want to use the new IPython QT console you need PyQt (and its dependency sip). This ticket adds the relevant spkgs. Together with zeromq/pyzmq (#12843), I can now run the IPython qtconsole. You need to have qt development libraries already installed in your base system, this only makes Qt available from Sage.
