When You type in numbers into Sage, the pre-processor converts them to a base ring, which is unknown to NumPy, SciPy and cvxopt. The best solution to this is to redefine the types:

```
RealNumber=float
Integer=int
```


But this solution only works in interpreter - since in a script - all numbers got converted to _sage_consts despite the claim of:

```
RealNumber=float
Integer=int
```

So the following sage script:


```
#!/usr/bin/sage

RealNumber=float
Integer=int

from cvxopt.base import matrix as m
from cvxopt import solvers

c = m([-4., -5.])
G = m([[2., 1., -1., 0.], [1., 2., 0., -1.]])
h = m([3., 3., 0., 0.])

sol = solvers.lp(c,G,h)
print sol['x']

```


is converted to the following python script


```
# This file was *autogenerated* from the file ./1.sage.
from sage.all_cmdline import *   # import sage library
_sage_const_4p = RealNumber('4.'); _sage_const_1p = RealNumber('1.'); _sage_const_0p = RealNumber('0.'); _sage_const_3p = RealNumber('3.'); _sage_const_2p = RealNumber('2.'); _sage_const_5p = RealNumber('5.')#!/usr/bin/sage

RealNumber=float
Integer=int

from cvxopt.base import matrix as m
from cvxopt import solvers

c = m([-_sage_const_4p , -_sage_const_5p ])
G = m([[_sage_const_2p , _sage_const_1p , -_sage_const_1p , _sage_const_0p ], [_sage_const_1p , _sage_const_2p , _sage_const_0p , -_sage_const_1p ]])
h = m([_sage_const_3p , _sage_const_3p , _sage_const_0p , _sage_const_0p ])

sol = solvers.lp(c,G,h)
print sol['x']


```


which gives error:


```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./1.py", line 11, in <module>
    c = m([-_sage_const_4p , -_sage_const_5p ])
TypeError: invalid type in list

```

So the solution:

But it does in a script executed by `sage -python`. But in a script executed by `sage -python` â€“ none of sage is working: for example `^` does not stand for exponentiation any more. So this solution is no good for scripts.
