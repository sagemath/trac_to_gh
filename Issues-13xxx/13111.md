When using the tachyon ray tracer, at the moment the parameters for the camera, as well as for the light and for the background-plane are hard-coded in `sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx`:

```
    def tachyon(self):
    ...
         camera
            zoom 1.0
            aspectratio 1.0
            antialiasing %s
            raydepth 8
            center  2.3 2.4 2.0
            viewdir  -2.3 -2.4 -2.0
            updir  0.0 0.0 1.0
         end_camera

      light center  4.0 3.0 2.0
            rad 0.2
            color  1.0 1.0 1.0

      plane
        center -2000 -1000 -500
        normal 2.3 2.4 2.0
        TEXTURE
            AMBIENT 1.0 DIFFUSE 1.0 SPECULAR 1.0 OPACITY 1.0
            COLOR 1.0 1.0 1.0
            TEXFUNC 0
```
Those things should be variable, i.e. it should be possible to pass those parameters by optional parameters (e.g. when calling `show`).

<a id='comment:12'></a>This is the long-awaited possibility to control many aspects of the tachyon viewer by
options of the `show()` method.
All available options are now properly documented.

(The tachyon viewer has now more available controls than the default threejs viewer, but
reorganizing the threejs options would be another project with a separate ticket.)

I also added an overview comparing the different viewer choices, and some warnings about some unexpected behaviour of certain viewers.
(There is also some code for a so-called `"wavefront"` viewer. Is that obsolete?)

The old name `camera_center` was the name I chose initially, following the convention of the Tachyon object.
https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plot3d/sage/plot/plot3d/tachyon.html

I chose to rename it because "camera position" is what is commonly used in computer graphics, but it has never been a parameter of show() or the tachyon() function before I introduced it; so there is no need to deprecate it.

(But I have to fix the few places where I forgot to change it.)

Fixed. (Anyway, what is the purpose of that test? Somebody adds a line to the beginning
of the tachyon output, then that test must be updated.)

> * In `threejs_template.html`: "Get camera" -> "Get Camera" to make the UI consistent. (Just a suggestion)


I have changed "Get Viewpoint" to "Get viewpoint" for consistency.

No, I indeed want only a short warning. On my system, the following text comes out separate from the warning in the html doc. I have now increased the indentation of the warning to 4 (extra) spaces. The result looks the same as before.

> * In the function `_flip_orientation`, did you mean Javascript (threejs) instead of Java, or you meant jmol? Also the first word in the docstring of this function should be capitalized.

I factored this function out from some other part
of the program (copying the comment), but I don't understand why it is there.

I agree.

Yes, the result looks the same. It is just a general convention to use 4 spaces.

The tickets looks go to me, and thus I will put it on positive review once the patchbot finishes.
