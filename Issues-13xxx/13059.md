The following seems bad.  It was revealed by the change in doctest framework at #12415.  That ticket introduces a workaround (just resetting `opt['red_tail']` to True).

```
sage: from sage.libs.singular.option import opt
sage: opt['red_tail']
True
sage: Rlocal.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ, order='ds')
sage: opt['red_tail']
False
```
