This function (in `sage.matrix.matrix_modn_sparse` and perhaps elsewhere) gives pngs that show up in the current working directory, which is not standard Sage behavior for graphics.   In particular, in the notebook and `EMBEDDED_MODE` they don't show up at all, anywhere (unless you have admin access, I suppose).  

At #13807 (where this was originally not working anyway due to a previous bugfix), it is pointed out that `visualize_matrix` does one thing that `matrix_plot` does not: it lets you put a bound on the size of the figure, and then scales the picture accordingly. So if you have a 20x20 matrix and plot it in a 10x10 picture, each pixel corresponds to the entries in a 2x2 block. 

There we thought it might make sense to merge this functionality into `matrix_plot` and then deprecate `visualize_matrix`, which after all dates from 2007.  But maybe there is a reason not to do this?  Anyway, any more consistent behavior would be nice here.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

I wrote `visualize_structure()` back in the day for visualising the structure of dense (!) matrices over GF(2). Currently, `matrix_plot()` doesn't behave as nicely as `visualize_structure()` for these matrices:

* by default zero is plotted black and one is plotted white
* structure visualisation (non-zero vs. zero) is only available for sparse matrices, but it should be also available for dense matrices (those can be structured too).

Currently, both `visualize_structure()` and `matrix_plot()` seem to behave the same performance wise. We  should allow a matrix to plot itself though, i.e., allow specialised code which is called by `matrix_plot()`. For example, the M4RI library can plot matrices and it is a lot faster than what we have in Sage.
