Currently, the default norm for matrices is the induced 2-norm, unless the matrix is an RDF or CDF matrix, in which case the default norm is the Frobenius norm.  Needless to say, this is very confusing:

```
sage: version()
'Sage Version 5.4.rc1, Release Date: 2012-10-05'
sage: a=matrix(QQ, 3, range(9))
sage: a.norm()
14.2267073908
sage: a.norm(2)
14.2267073908
sage: b=a.change_ring(RDF)
sage: b.norm()
14.2828568571
sage: b.norm('frob')
14.2828568571
```

I propose we change the default norm for RDF/CDF matrices to the induced 2-norm.

More info for a decision:

Defaults to Frobenius norm: 

* Numpy (http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.norm.html, which is likely where our original decision came from).  

Defaults to induced 2-norm: 

* Matlab (http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/norm.html).   
* Octave (http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/octave3/octave_198.html).  
* Mathematica (http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Norm.html)

I don't feel like this is a bad idea at all, given that we are focused more on the Ms than imitating NumPy, and with the deprecation warning we will hopefully catch any power users. I don't usually do a norm of a matrix myself...
