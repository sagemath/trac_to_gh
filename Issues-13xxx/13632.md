```
In sage 5.3, if the arguments of a symbolic function have no `_latex_` attribute, an exception is raised if one tries to latex it:

```
sage: P=function('P',x)
sage: latex(P(x=int(0)))
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute '_latex_'
```

This is fixed in the attached patch.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

Wow, that's a pretty simple fix, but it looks right.  I am a little concerned about the following:

```
sage: type(latex(x))
<class 'sage.misc.latex.LatexExpr'>
sage: type(x._latex_())
<type 'str'>
```
Will that cause any problem/slow things down, or is this actually an improvement?

```
sage: L = [4,x,3.4]
sage: timeit("' '.join([z._latex_() for z in L])")
625 loops, best of 3: 10.1 µs per loop
sage: timeit("' '.join([latex(z) for z in L])")
625 loops, best of 3: 17 µs per loop
```
Naturally fixing the bug is good, just wondering if there is any slick way to avoid turning things into LatexExpr and back to strings - or maybe a try/except thing catching the attribute error?

Otherwise this looks like a good idea and nice fix.

I agree that the overhead of typesetting an equation is not really important for the usual user. If you're doing this a lot when typesetting a book it might be an issue, but I'm willing to risk it. I'm switching to positive review.

Thanks a lot for the quick patch!
