Hello! This is my first contribution to sage. Its quite trivial since it is only meant to test how things work here. Hopefully I'll add something more substantial in the near future.

Let me know if the patch is appropriate.

Hello slani! 

The patch looks good to me - i am quite surprised sage didn't have this graph!

Hopefully ncohen can jump in and verify the patch as well since I am also quite new to sage.

Helloooooooo Uros !

About the last two points :
* Oh. By embedding, I was talking about the different between those two commands :

```
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().show(layout="spring")
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().show()  
```
  Most graph generators include the definition of an embedding (err. layout) in the graph they return, just in case that there would be a "nice" way to display the graph. Actually, it looks like there is no default layout for Kneser Graph (and I would have a hard time finding a general one). So except if you know a good way to display Johnson graphs, I guess you can skip it.

* If you write the algorithm this way "for any pair of vertices, test whether the intersection has size exactly k" the amount of operations you do is `(\binom n k)^2`. And that's usually a LOT `:-P`. If, instead, you write "for any sets S of size k-1, and for any two distincts elements i,j not included in S, add the edge (S+i,S+j)", then the amount of operations you do is exactly the number of edges you need to add. And I guess it may be faster, even for small cases `:-)`

  You can evaluate the time it takes to run a command this way :

  ```
  sage: %timeit graphs.JohnsonGraph(6,4)
  25 loops, best of 3: 10.7 ms per loop
  sage: %timeit graphs.JohnsonGraph(7,4)
  5 loops, best of 3: 55.2 ms per loop
  sage: %timeit graphs.JohnsonGraph(8,4)
  5 loops, best of 3: 217 ms per loop
  ```

Hellooooooooo !!

Actually, I was thinking of this :

```
def J(n,k):
    from sage.combinat.subset import Subsets
    from sage.graphs.graph import Graph
    g = Graph(name="Johnson graph with parameters "+str(n)+","+str(k))
    X = Set(range(n))

    g.add_vertices(Subsets(X,k))

    # All sets A and B such that A inter B = X and |X| = k-1 are adjacent                                                                                                 

    # We first iterate over all sets X of cardinality k-1, then build the sets A and B                                                                                    
    for I in Subsets(X,k-1):

	elements_left = X-I
	# A = I u {x}                                                                                                                                                     
	# B = I u {y}                                                                                                                                                     
        for x in elements_left:
            for y in elements_left:
                # We assume that y>x                                                                                                                                      
            	if y <= x:
                    continue
		g.add_edge(I+Set([x]),I+Set([y]))

    return g
```

By the way, a BIG patch #13862 was recently added to Sage which totally changes the file you touch. `graph_generators.py` is now split into many files (smallgraphs.py, families.py, platonic_solids.py, ...), and your patch does not apply to the latest version of Sage, which is 5.6.beta3. Hence, two solutions :

* Can you install sage 5.6.beta3 and create a patch from this version of it, so that the release manager can easily add it to Sage ? (in this case your function should go inside of `families.py`
* Can you produce, on your current version of Sage, a patch containing all that you did in only one file ? I will then adapt it to 5.6.beta3 myself.

Helloooooooo again !

Well, your patch looks good indeed, short of a few unimportant things :
* Your paragraphs were a bit too short, the limit in Sage is something like 80 characters
* It was a good occasion to advertise a Wikipedia page
* There were some trailing whitespaces, and it may hurt some people's feeling to find these in Sage's code.

This is fixed in a small reviewer's patch that I attach. If you agree with those changes (and as I agree with yours), then you can set this ticket to `positive_review`. And thank you for this patch of course `:-)`
