This is part of the new layout for git. Since it is not too difficult to separate off this change, I decided making this a distinct ticket was a good idea. `SAGE_EXTCODE` will be moved to `SAGE_ROOT/devel/ext`, and currently `SAGE_LOCAL/share/sage/ext` links to this.

New SPKGS:
* [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/elliptic_curves-0.7.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/elliptic_curves-0.7.spkg)
* [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/polytopes_db-20100210.p2.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/polytopes_db-20100210.p2.spkg)
* [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/graphs-20120404.p4.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/graphs-20120404.p4.spkg)
* [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/conway_polynomials-0.3.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/conway_polynomials-0.3.spkg)

Installation Steps:
* Add new spkgs
* Apply [attachment:trac13123_library.patch] to the library repo
* Apply [attachment:trac13123_root.patch] and [attachment:13123_root_review.patch] to the root repo
* Apply #13457 and [attachment:trac13123_scripts.patch] and [attachment:13123_bdist.patch] to the scripts repo
* Apply [attachment:trac13123_extcode.patch] and [attachment:13123_extcode_review.patch] to the extcode repo

Not really, since it removes yet another instance of sage trying to write to someplace it shouldn't be at runtime.

The purpose of `GAP_STAMP` seems to be a check on whether it needs to refresh the workspaces. Really, this will all become a moot point if/when libgap is finished.

I don't write to `SAGE_EXTCODE`, I just use its creation for the timestamp that gap wants. It used to be that when you first started sage, it would touch `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gap_stamp` and then use the timestamp of that.

I agree, nothing should try to write to `SAGE_LOCAL` or its subdirectories in the long run.

`@`fbissey

Because the commented out code references `SAGE_DATA/extcode` and hasn't been used in a long long time (see #6233).

Ok, updated. Changes:

* Removed refactoring of `sage.databases.cremona`
* Reverted change of `SAGE_ROOT -> SAGE_LOCAL` in `sage.interfaces.gap` (better done in #13432)
* fixed `sage.databases.symbolic_data`

<a id='comment:69'></a>Why was `GAP_STAMP` changed from

```
GAP_STAMP = '%s/local/bin/gap_stamp'%SAGE_ROOT
```
to

```
GAP_STAMP = SAGE_EXTCODE
```

This seems a mistake and might be the cause of #13963.
