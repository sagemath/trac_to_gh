This is part of the new layout for git. Since it is not too difficult to separate off this change, I decided making this a distinct ticket was a good idea. `SAGE_EXTCODE` will be moved to `SAGE_ROOT/devel/ext`, and currently `SAGE_LOCAL/share/sage/ext` links to this.

You should use `cp -R` instead of `cp -r` (like it was before).

You should deal with upgrading (probably in the new extcode installer): if `SAGE_ROOT/data` exists, then move `SAGE_ROOT/data/extcode` to `SAGE_ROOT/devel/ext-main` and delete the whole directory `SAGE_ROOT/data`.

Not really, since it removes yet another instance of sage trying to write to someplace it shouldn't be at runtime.

The purpose of `GAP_STAMP` seems to be a check on whether it needs to refresh the workspaces. Really, this will all become a moot point if/when libgap is finished.

As far as I am concerned SAGE_EXTCODE is a place sage shouldn't write at runtime. On a system wide installation that would be a folder that a user is not supposed to own. If a sys-admin install sage under /usr/local/sage-xxx for example, it would resolve to /usr/local/sage-xxx/local/share/sage/ext and as a sys-admin I object that my users have to write something there. Their home folder, tmp and any scratch space set for them is where it should go.

That's my perspective.

I don't write to `SAGE_EXTCODE`, I just use its creation for the timestamp that gap wants. It used to be that when you first started sage, it would touch `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gap_stamp` and then use the timestamp of that.

I agree, nothing should try to write to `SAGE_LOCAL` or its subdirectories in the long run.

Installing databases in `local/share/sage/data` is like installing all binaries in `local/bin/sage/binaries` and we don't do that either.

For extcode, `local/share/sage` makes sense.

3. database_stein_watkins_mini.p0
4. sage-mode-0.7

6. database_sloane_oeis-2005-12
7. database_jones_numfield-v4
8. soya-0.11.2.p0

Some optional packages use `$SAGE_ROOT/data':
1. database_odlyzko_zeta
2. database_symbolic_data-20070206
3. database_kohel-20060803

For these reasons, I would keep `SAGE_DATA` as synonym of `SAGE_SHARE` and also make a symlink

I changed the logic in `sage.databases.cremona` since I wrote it, and it when replacing everything, it annoyed me that it wasn't factored appropriately.

I'll see about fixing the extcode `spkg-install` (most of the code there comes from a recent version of the sagenb `spkg-install`) and`spkg/install`, as well as adding a symlink for `SAGE_DATA`.

@kiwifb

Because the commented out code references `SAGE_DATA/extcode` and hasn't been used in a long long time (see #6233).

Ok, updated. Changes:

* Removed refactoring of `sage.databases.cremona`
* Reverted change of `SAGE_ROOT -> SAGE_LOCAL` in `sage.interfaces.gap` (better done in #13432)
* fixed `sage.databases.symbolic_data`

Why was `GAP_STAMP` changed from

```
GAP_STAMP = '%s/local/bin/gap_stamp'%SAGE_ROOT
```
to

```
GAP_STAMP = SAGE_EXTCODE
```

This seems a mistake and might be the cause of #13963.
