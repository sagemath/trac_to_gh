This is part of the new layout for git. Since it is not too difficult to separate off this change, I decided making this a distinct ticket was a good idea. `SAGE_EXTCODE` will be moved to `SAGE_ROOT/devel/ext`, and currently `SAGE_LOCAL/share/sage/ext` links to this.

New SPKGS:
* [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/elliptic_curves-0.7.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/elliptic_curves-0.7.spkg)

* [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/conway_polynomials-0.3.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/conway_polynomials-0.3.spkg)

Installation Steps:
* Add new spkgs
* Apply [attachment: trac13123_library.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13123/trac13123_library.patch.gz) to the library repo
* Apply [attachment: trac13123_root.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13123/trac13123_root.patch.gz) and [attachment: 13123_root_review.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13123/13123_root_review.patch.gz) to the root repo

I cannot comment on trac13123_extcode.patch and trac13123_scripts.patch as I don't know the code in there all that well. But for the rest:\n* I will need to check the spkg individually for correctness but I assume it will be OK it is the easy part.\n* trac13123_library.patch : I am spotting something that I should have reported as a bug a long time ago.

You should use `cp -R` instead of `cp -r` (like it was before).

You should deal with upgrading (probably in the new extcode installer): if `SAGE_ROOT/data` exists, then move `SAGE_ROOT/data/extcode` to `SAGE_ROOT/devel/ext-main` and delete the whole directory `SAGE_ROOT/data`.

Replying to [@ohanar](#comment:23):
> FYI, looking at the code there might be an issue with using a `GAP_STAMP` shared by multiple copies of Sage (I'm not positive, I don't really know the code). For right now I'm using the `SAGE_EXTCODE` directory as the `GAP_STAMP`.

Putting it in SAGE_EXTCODE is about as bad as putting it in SAGE_LOCAL/bin as it was initially. If you are concerned about multiple sage session running in parallel that's would still be a problem wherever you put it. I am not sure how the file is used but we don't remove it or anything. The real question is: is it actively used by gap? If gap just check for it's presence then it is OK. If it is used then it may have to be unique for each sage session and be cleaned on exit.

Not really, since it removes yet another instance of sage trying to write to someplace it shouldn't be at runtime.

The purpose of `GAP_STAMP` seems to be a check on whether it needs to refresh the workspaces. Really, this will all become a moot point if/when libgap is finished.

I don't write to `SAGE_EXTCODE`, I just use its creation for the timestamp that gap wants. It used to be that when you first started sage, it would touch `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gap_stamp` and then use the timestamp of that.

@kiwifb

Because the commented out code references `SAGE_DATA/extcode` and hasn't been used in a long long time (see #6233).

Ok, updated. Changes:

* Removed refactoring of `sage.databases.cremona`
* Reverted change of `SAGE_ROOT -> SAGE_LOCAL` in `sage.interfaces.gap` (better done in #13432)
* fixed `sage.databases.symbolic_data`

Tested building from scratch, sdist, bdist, works fine.  Positive review to everything not authored by me.

I agree with the deleting of the commented-out code in `sage/misc/explain_pickle.py`.  If people really want to do something with that code, it's still in the Mercurial history.

My reviewer patches still need review.

Looks all clear to me. I didn't really notice that the explain_pickle code was commented out last week, probably because of other stuff going on locally. But still happy that this is related to the rest of the ticket and not a freebie done at the same time.

As far as I can see it is ready to go.

Why was `GAP_STAMP` changed from

```
GAP_STAMP = '%s/local/bin/gap_stamp'%SAGE_ROOT
```
to

```
GAP_STAMP = SAGE_EXTCODE
```

This seems a mistake and might be the cause of #13963.
