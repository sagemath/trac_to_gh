This is part of the new layout for git. Since it is not too difficult to separate off this change, I decided making this a distinct ticket was a good idea. `SAGE_EXTCODE` will be moved to `SAGE_ROOT/devel/ext`, and currently `SAGE_LOCAL/share/sage/ext` links to this.

New SPKGS:
* [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/elliptic_curves-0.7.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/elliptic_curves-0.7.spkg)
* [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/polytopes_db-20100210.p2.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/polytopes_db-20100210.p2.spkg)
* [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/graphs-20120404.p4.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/graphs-20120404.p4.spkg)
* [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/conway_polynomials-0.3.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/conway_polynomials-0.3.spkg)

Installation Steps:
* Add new spkgs
* Apply [attachment:trac13123_library.patch] to the library repo
* Apply [attachment:trac13123_root.patch] and [attachment:13123_root_review.patch] to the root repo
* Apply #13457 and [attachment:trac13123_scripts.patch] and [attachment:13123_bdist.patch] to the scripts repo
* Apply [attachment:trac13123_extcode.patch] and [attachment:13123_extcode_review.patch] to the extcode repo

You should use `cp -R` instead of `cp -r` (like it was before).

You should deal with upgrading (probably in the new extcode installer): if `SAGE_ROOT/data` exists, then move `SAGE_ROOT/data/extcode` to `SAGE_ROOT/devel/ext-main` and delete the whole directory `SAGE_ROOT/data`.

Why don't you

```
mkdir -p "$SAGE_DATA"

Not really, since it removes yet another instance of sage trying to write to someplace it shouldn't be at runtime.

The purpose of `GAP_STAMP` seems to be a check on whether it needs to refresh the workspaces. Really, this will all become a moot point if/when libgap is finished.

I don't write to `SAGE_EXTCODE`, I just use its creation for the timestamp that gap wants. It used to be that when you first started sage, it would touch `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gap_stamp` and then use the timestamp of that.

I would argue for `local/share` because the stuff in `SAGE_DATA` (apart from extcode) isn't part of Sage.  It's part of external packages/databases.  So I think it's wrong to use a `sage` subdirectory.

Installing databases in `local/share/sage/data` is like installing all binaries in `local/bin/sage/binaries` and we don't do that either.

For extcode, `local/share/sage` makes sense.

Some optional/experimental packages use `SAGE_DATA`:
1. cunningham_tables-1.0
2. p_group_cohomology-2.1.2
3. database_stein_watkins_mini.p0
4. sage-mode-0.7

6. database_sloane_oeis-2005-12
7. database_jones_numfield-v4
8. soya-0.11.2.p0

Some optional packages use `$SAGE_ROOT/data':
1. database_odlyzko_zeta
2. database_symbolic_data-20070206
3. database_kohel-20060803

For these reasons, I would keep `SAGE_DATA` as synonym of `SAGE_SHARE` and also make a symlink

@kiwifb

Because the commented out code references `SAGE_DATA/extcode` and hasn't been used in a long long time (see #6233).

Ok, updated. Changes:

* Removed refactoring of `sage.databases.cremona`
* Reverted change of `SAGE_ROOT -> SAGE_LOCAL` in `sage.interfaces.gap` (better done in #13432)
* fixed `sage.databases.symbolic_data`

Tested building from scratch, sdist, bdist, works fine.  Positive review to everything not authored by me.

I agree with the deleting of the commented-out code in `sage/misc/explain_pickle.py`.  If people really want to do something with that code, it's still in the Mercurial history.

My reviewer patches still need review.

Looks all clear to me. I didn't really notice that the explain_pickle code was commented out last week, probably because of other stuff going on locally. But still happy that this is related to the rest of the ticket and not a freebie done at the same time.

As far as I can see it is ready to go.

Why was `GAP_STAMP` changed from

```
GAP_STAMP = '%s/local/bin/gap_stamp'%SAGE_ROOT
```
to

```
GAP_STAMP = SAGE_EXTCODE
```

This seems a mistake and might be the cause of #13963.
