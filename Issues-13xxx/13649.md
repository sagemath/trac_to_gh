```
Currently one needs to go through the parent of a permutation to get
its domain and codomain:

```
    sage: G = SymmetricGroup(8)
    sage: g = G.an_element()
    sage: g.parent().domain()
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
```

One would want to have shorthands:

```
    sage: g.domain()
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
    sage: g.codomain()
```

like there are for most other maps in Sage:

```
    sage: F = FiniteSetMaps(8)
    sage: f = F.an_element()
    sage: f.domain()
    {0, .., 7}
    sage: f.codomain()
    {0, .., 7}
```

Bonus points for:

```
    sage: g.image()
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
```

Well, in the case of elements of a symmetric group, yes, because they're bijections, but surely this isn't true in general. In general, the range is only a subset of the codomain, and is not necessarily equal to it. Or am I missing something?

I am setting this to needs work for the following reasons: 

MAJOR:

1. There is a typo in the example indicated for the function codomain (second of the patches, in the file permgroup.py). You really want to show the function codomain(). 

2. It might be nice to demonstrate that the domain and codomain are the same by adding an example to this effect (using `==`)!

MINOR:

1. Fullstops please! 
2. It is advisable to write the docstrings imperatively: you might find [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [PEP257](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) a good read. (I realise that the other docstrings are also like yours: "returns"ing instead of "return"ing. So, you may not change this in this patch.) 

Modulo these, your patch is good to go. ~KnS

That's because of two reasons: first, the output in doctests is not properly formated. And second, if you use a random element in a doctest, the result may vary each time the test is run.

Now that i think about it, your method to compute the image is clearly suboptimal. In the case of small groups you don't notice a difference. But if the group is very big, going through the image of all the elements might take a lot of time, which is unnecesary.

It would be much faster to just take it from the cycle structure.

Notice the difference in timings (with your patch applied):

```

sage: G=SymmetricGroup(10000)                                                                                                                              
sage: g=G('(1,2,3)(6,8,10)')                                                                                                                               
sage: % time g.cycle_tuples()                                                                                                                              
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00 s
[(1, 2, 3), (6, 8, 10)]
sage: %time FiniteEnumeratedSet(flatten(g.cycle_tuples()))
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00 s
{1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10}
sage: %time g.image()                                                                                                                                      
CPU times: user 7.81 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 7.83 s
Wall time: 7.82 s
{1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10}
```

As the size of the group grows, this gets much worse.

Besides that, i think it is ok.

If you put `codomain = domain`, then unfortunately when people type `g.codomain?`, they're going to get the documentation for the domain method and it can be pretty confusing. (This issue comes up frequently.) In that regard, adding a short codomain method that just returns `self.domain()` is preferable.

The same disclaimer applies, but it looks like you're right about `support()` doing the wrong thing:

* https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PermutationSupport.html
* https://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/Maple/view.aspx?path=GroupTheory/tutorials/WorkingWithPermutations

That terminology is unfortunate, since permutations are also usually thought of as real-valued functions, whose support is the set of things that don't get mapped to zero. Since that issue will likely be more controversial and can break existing code, it is best handled on another ticket.

<div id="comment:33" align="right">comment:33</div>

Brief opinions, mostly as confirmation of what was said before.

For permutations, domain, codomain, and image should all return the same value. And we would want them to return the same thing as their parent too, which is not the case with the current implementation of domain:

    sage: G.domain()
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    sage: G.random_element().domain()
    [5, 2, 3, 4, 1]
    sage: G.random_element().domain()
    [5, 3, 4, 2, 1]

Of course, it feels a bit silly to have so many methods to apparently achieve the same thing, but this makes permutations fit within the larger setting of morphisms.

Fixing the support method (which should return the set of non-fixed points) would be best another ticket.

Thanks for the work on that ticket!
