Assignee: @burcin

CC:  @nbruin @benjaminfjones dsm

Keywords: Ei limit sign

We have

```
sage: (Ei(-Z)).limit(Z=oo)
Infinity
```
which is wrong, since it should be 0. It seems that there goes something wrong with the `-` sign. This can be also seen here:

```
sage: (Ei(-Z)).limit(Z=1000)   
-Ei(1000)
sage: (Ei(-Z)).limit(Z=1000).n()
-1.97204513714124e431
```
But

```
sage: Ei(-1000).n()
-5.07089306023517e-438
sage: -Ei(1000).n()
-1.97204513714124e431
```
which are the correct results.

Just as a data point, we still get this after #11143, unsurprisingly given that that doesn't touch Maxima.

This is a little weird, since in both Maxima in current Sage and in Maxima 5.27

```
(%i5) limit(expintegral_ei(-z),z,inf);
(%o5)                                  0
```
Further,

```
sage: A = Ei(-Z)._maxima_()
sage: A.limit(Z,'inf')
0
```
Using the Maxima lib version is ok too.

I have a feeling that the following is the problem,

```
sage: sage.interfaces.maxima_lib.sr_to_max(SR(Ei(-Z)))
<ECL: ((%GAMMA_INCOMPLETE) 0 ((MTIMES) |$z| -1))>
```
combined with

```
(%i1) limit(gamma_incomplete(0,-Z),Z,inf);
(%o1)                              infinity
```
So somehow this is completely bypassing the symbol table.  I am out of my depth in our ECL conversions...

In fact, this makes no sense whatsoever.  We should change the two lone references to `max_gamma_incomplete` to use the appropriate thing for `Ei` instead.  This dates from the very start of the ECL conversions at #7377.  Unless the Maxima `expintegral_ei` is somehow less powerful than the incomplete gamma?

I'm going to try just eliminating all that.

In theory, fixing this doesn't need #11143, but might as well do it on that since it's about the same thing.

Oops, still need to add doctests...
