<div id="comment:0"></div>

We have

```
sage: (Ei(-Z)).limit(Z=oo)
Infinity
```
which is wrong, since it should be 0. It seems that there goes something wrong with the `-` sign. This can be also seen here:

```
sage: (Ei(-Z)).limit(Z=1000)   
-Ei(1000)
sage: (Ei(-Z)).limit(Z=1000).n()
-1.97204513714124e431
```
But

```
sage: Ei(-1000).n()
-5.07089306023517e-438
sage: -Ei(1000).n()
-1.97204513714124e431
```
which are the correct results.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

Just as a data point, we still get this after #11143, unsurprisingly given that that doesn't touch Maxima.

This is a little weird, since in both Maxima in current Sage and in Maxima 5.27

```
(%i5) limit(expintegral_ei(-z),z,inf);
(%o5)                                  0
```
Further,

```
sage: A = Ei(-Z)._maxima_()
sage: A.limit(Z,'inf')
0
```
Using the Maxima lib version is ok too.

I have a feeling that the following is the problem,

```
sage: sage.interfaces.maxima_lib.sr_to_max(SR(Ei(-Z)))
<ECL: ((%GAMMA_INCOMPLETE) 0 ((MTIMES) |$z| -1))>
```
combined with

```
(%i1) limit(gamma_incomplete(0,-Z),Z,inf);
(%o1)                              infinity
```
So somehow this is completely bypassing the symbol table.  I am out of my depth in our ECL conversions...
