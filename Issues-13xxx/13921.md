```
On bsd.math (hence, Darwin), there is a problem with the GP executable when building Sage (or: only the pari/gp spkg) with SAGE_DEBUG=yes.

As Jeroen found, a crash occurs as follows:

```
$ ./sage --gp
? factor(10356613*10694706299664611221)
```
With gdb, one then gets

```
Program received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.
Reason: 13 at address: 0x0000000000000000
0x00007fff8a66cfc1 in dyld_stub_binder ()
(gdb) bt
#0  0x00007fff8a66cfc1 in dyld_stub_binder ()
#1  0x000000010040e398 in  stub helpers ()
```

The problem vanishes with Apple's gcc. The problem also vanishes with static linking.
