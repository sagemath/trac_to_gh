No, the `.DS_Store` files are upstream in `http://sympy.googlecode.com/files/sympy-0.7.1.tar.gz`

This should be either reported upstream or closed as "wontfix" (I won't do neither of these).

```

$ ls -aR . | grep -C 4 DS_Store

./data:

so different garbage, but still there.  

Reported upstream at [Sympy issue 3787](http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=3787).

I now agree that we either need a script in spkg-install to avoid this or to wait on upstream.  Is there any problem if we also upgrade at this ticket, should that work?
