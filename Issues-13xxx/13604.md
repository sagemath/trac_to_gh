Well, I looked at a clean source and these files aren't there, so they must have gotten added when a Sage developer on Mac wasn't careful about this.  Maybe the sage-pkg script needs to do a `ls -aR | grep DS_Store` or something.

Anyway, I'm putting this back to 'needs review' because of this.

Replying to [kcrisman](#comment%3A6):
> Well, I looked at a clean source and these files aren't there, so they must have gotten added when a Sage developer on Mac wasn't careful about this.

No, the `.DS_Store` files are upstream in `http://sympy.googlecode.com/files/sympy-0.7.1.tar.gz`

This should be either reported upstream or closed as "wontfix" (I won't do neither of these).

Thanks, Jeroen - I used the wrong command before.  In Sympy 0.7.2, we have

```

$ ls -aR . | grep -C 4 DS_Store

./data:
.
..
.DS_Store
IPython
Macports
TeXmacs

--

./doc:
.
..
.DS_Store
Makefile
README.rst
api
apidoc.conf
--

./doc/src:
.
..
.DS_Store
_static
aboutus.rst
conf.py
figures
```
so different garbage, but still there.  

Reported upstream at [Sympy issue 3787](http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=3787).

I now agree that we either need a script in spkg-install to avoid this or to wait on upstream.  Is there any problem if we also upgrade at this ticket, should that work?

now stands again, I am putting this back to "needs work".  And it is clearly not particularly major.

Except we do still take upstream, and if it has garbage, it should be removed.  I don't think it's there any more, but it's worth checking.  Does [https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/2256](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/2256) indeed take care of it?

Anyway, as long as it's been handled there I have no interest in it, just trying to make sure that is confirmed (as we do for other upstream tickets).",

True, but is this even a bug? A few extra files which do nothing wrong, take almost no space and don't do anything wrong.

Its still wrong to have unrelated crap in your tarball. But its gone in sympy-0.7.4 which we currently use.
