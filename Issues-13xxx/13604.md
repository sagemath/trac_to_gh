Well, I looked at a clean source and these files aren't there, so they must have gotten added when a Sage developer on Mac wasn't careful about this.  Maybe the sage-pkg script needs to do a `ls -aR | grep DS_Store` or something.

Anyway, I'm putting this back to 'needs review' because of this.

No, the `.DS_Store` files are upstream in `http://sympy.googlecode.com/files/sympy-0.7.1.tar.gz`

This should be either reported upstream or closed as "wontfix" (I won't do neither of these).

Thanks, Jeroen - I used the wrong command before.  In Sympy 0.7.2, we have

```

$ ls -aR . | grep -C 4 DS_Store

./data:
.
..
.DS_Store
IPython
Macports
TeXmacs

--

./doc:
.
..
.DS_Store
Makefile
README.rst
api
apidoc.conf
--

./doc/src:
.
..
.DS_Store
_static
aboutus.rst
conf.py
figures
```
so different garbage, but still there.  

Reported upstream at [Sympy issue 3787](http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=3787).

I now agree that we either need a script in spkg-install to avoid this or to wait on upstream.  Is there any problem if we also upgrade at this ticket, should that work?

They say that [Sympy issue 3445](http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=3445), where they automate the release process, would take care of this.  We'll see.

Since my original comment

now stands again, I am putting this back to "needs work".  And it is clearly not particularly major.
