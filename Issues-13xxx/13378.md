Sorry for the long ticket title.

About the first part of the title:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: P.is_coercion_cached(x)
False
sage: P.coerce_map_from(x)
sage: P.is_coercion_cached(x)
True
```
Hence, there is a reference to x in the coercion cache for P. OK, by #715 and friends, the reference is weak --- unless x does not allow weak references, in which case the reference will be strong, and x would not be collectable. Hence, a potential memory leak.

About the second part:

```
sage: ZZ.convert_map_from(1)
Conversion map:
  From: Set of Python objects of 
  To:   Integer Ring
```
or

```
sage: P.convert_map_from(x)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Cannot convert sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular to sage.structure.parent.Parent
```

I think it is not good that the error occurs. The answer of `ZZ.convert_map_from(1)` seems strange, but apparently those things actually occur, namely conversions from the category of sequences.

Are you sure

```
ZZ.convert_map_from(10)
```
should not raise an error? Shouldn't the argument be a parent? Something like:

```
    if not(isinstance(S,type) or isinstance(type(S),sage.structure.parent.Parent):
        raise TypeError('convert maps only exist from parents')
```
This has the potential for getting hairy if you want this to work:

```
sage: A=AdditiveGroups()
sage: A(ZZ)
Free commutative group on generators [1]
```
because then `parent(ZZ)` should be a Parent and it's not. However, this doesn't seem to be the way categories work anyway and it's probably wise to keep a strict separation between sets (parents) and categories. It actually makes me wonder if parent(ZZ) should even work.

I know this all flies in the face of duck typing, but so does the whole category framework. I'm afraid that a fully duck typed computer algebra system would about as bad as an untyped one.

No, I am not sure.

Or a type, because we want a coercion (not just a conversion) between Python ints and Sage integers.

That's totally separate. `AdditiveGroups()`, which doesn't exist yet, is a category and not a parent. It would be desirable, though, to have

```
sage: ZZ.category() # current behaviour
Category of euclidean domains
sage: AdditiveGroups()(ZZ).category()  # not implemented
Category of additive groups
```

> because then `parent(ZZ)`

ZZ has no parent, it *is* a parent. Elements have a parent, but parents have a category.

> It actually makes me wonder if parent(ZZ) should even work.

parent(X) currently returns the type of X, if X has no method `X.parent()`. This is in order to make `int(1)+1` work. I don't think one should slow it down by distinguishing cases like "if X is a parent then parent(X) should raise an error, but if X is anything else then either return X.parent() or type(X)".

Anyway. I tried to introduce a shortcut for `Parent.coerce_map_from`, such that `None` is returned (without caching) if the argument is neither a `CategoryObject` nor a type. Similarly, I introduced a shortcut for `Parent.convert_map_from`, but had to be more relaxed, because apparently convert maps also need to exist from sequences (which are `SageObject`, but not `CategoryObject`).

Result: It nearly worked. There was one segfault in sage.rings.polynomial.infinite_polynomial_element (which I wrote) and one doctest error.

One could say that the category framework is the opposite of duck typing: In duck typing, you'd test whether certain methods are available for X, and conclude that X belongs to the category of ducks. In the category framework, you would at some point initialise X as an object of the category of ducks, and the category then provides X with methods like "quack()", "swim()", "fly()" --- or, if the category framework can not provide generic methods, it does require that these methods are implemented.

But I actually think that's a strength of the category framework. And note that after category initialisation of X, it would to some extent be possible to determine `X.category()` from the methods X provides.

> ZZ has no parent, it *is* a parent. Elements have a parent, but parents have a category.

Ah yes, keeping that distinction strict is probably a good idea, even if it's
not always desirable from a strictly mathematical point of view:

```
sage: I=ZZ.ideal(3)
sage: I(6)
TypeError: 'Ideal_pid' object is not callable
sage: parent(I)
Monoid of ideals of Integer Ring
sage: category(I)
Category of ring ideals in Integer Ring
```
so an ideal is an element and not a parent (although mathematically it's also a
a non-unitary ring and at the very least a ZZ-module). What's that category
doing on `I` though? Do elements have a parent *as well as* a category?

```
sage: V=FreeModule(ZZ,1)
sage: W=V.span([3*V.0])
sage: parent(W)
<class 'sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule_submodule_pid_with_category'>
sage: category(W)
Category of modules with basis over Integer Ring
```
And here we're not getting a parent "... of submodules of V", whatever the ...
should be.

Along these lines, by the way:

```
sage: NumberField(x^2+1,name='i').ideal(3)
Fractional ideal (3)
sage: QQ.ideal(3)
Principal ideal (1) of Rational Field
```
illustrating the usual schism between algebraists and number theorists.

I don't think I'm really trying to make any point here. I'm just checking to
what degree Sage agrees with my mathematical intuition.

> Could you clarify under what circumstances not having this code pollutes the cache?

Unfortunately, I did not write in the ticket description what use case made me create this ticket. But probably it was some experimental code on the computation of Ext algebras of basic algebras (i.e., finite-dimensional path algebra quotients).

Anyway. The problem is that in the coercion code one quite typically has

```
    if self.has_coerce_map_from(P):
        ...
```
without checking whether P really is a category object or type. And that means trouble, if P happens to be, say, an element (Yes, that did occur! But I don't know where I had originally found it). See the ticket description for an example.

Of course, if P is neither a category object nor a type, then there is no coercion map from P to self. And as you know, the coercion framework would not only cache a coercion map from P to self, but it would also cache the non-existence of a coercion map from P to self.

So, the trouble starts if P runs over many elements that are not weakreffable. For each element P, the coercion framework would store the value ``None`` in self's coercion dictionary. And since the element is not weakreffable, the entry will stay in cache forever, and I think this may even prevent self from being garbage collected.

Too bad/good, I just tested it with sage-5.6.beta1:

```
sage: %timeit a = ZZ.ideal(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 147 µs per loop
sage: %timeit a = ZZ.ideal(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 144 µs per loop
sage: %timeit a = ZZ.ideal(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 147 µs per loop
sage: %timeit a = ZZ.ideal(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 148 µs per loop
sage: %timeit a = ZZ.ideal(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 146 µs per loop
sage: %timeit a = ZZ.ideal(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 147 µs per loop
sage: %timeit a = ZZ.ideal(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 148 µs per loop
sage: %timeit a = ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 82.1 µs per loop
sage: %timeit a = ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 81.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit a = ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(5)
625 loops, best of 3: 81.3 µs per loop
```
So, the problem mentioned at #13400 does currently not exist.

We should investigate why it is not a problem.

I find it easier to have the full set of dependencies written down.  Consider tickets A, B and C where A and B have positive review, C needs review, A depends on B and B depends on C.  If the implicit dependency of A on C is not written down, then it's not obvious to the release manager that A cannot currently be merged.
