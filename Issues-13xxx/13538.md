Currently, `AlgebraicExtensionFunctor` assumes that the `.extension()` function of a field takes the generators' names as the second argument. This is not always the case:

```
sage: K = Qp(3,3)
sage: R.<a> = K[]
sage: AEF = sage.categories.pushout.AlgebraicExtensionFunctor([a^2-3], ['a'], [None])
sage: AEF(K)
ValueError: must specify name of generator of extension
```

The attached patch resolves this problem.
