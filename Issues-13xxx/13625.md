See [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1888/put-title-on-matrix_plot), where elcojon gives this example.

```
piclabels = ('width [px]','height [px]')
import scipy 
data = scipy.lena()
matrix_plot(data,axes_labels=piclabels, title='Lena image')
```
![](Lena-wrongtitle.png)

(Note that this doesn't work literally in Sage 5.4.1 - the new Scipy in #13541 seems to have moved this to `scipy.misc.lena()`.)

This is fallout from the great *new* functionality in #10512. The `axes_labels` are irrelevant to whether this happens.

It's a bug in mpl. It shouldn't be our job to move title positions around. The bug is because of `tick_top()` that is used.

```
sage: from matplotlib.figure import Figure
sage: figure = Figure()
sage: subplot = figure.add_subplot(111)
sage: import numpy as np
sage: M = np.identity(50)
sage: subplot.imshow(M)
<matplotlib.image.AxesImage object at 0x8bc0650>
sage: subplot.xaxis.tick_top()   # <--------- this introduces the bug
sage: subplot.set_title('a title')

sage: from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg
sage: figure.set_canvas(FigureCanvasAgg(figure))

OK. This is now reported upstream at [1415](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/1415).

Okay, looks good overall, I can do all kinds of goofy things!  I like these patches, sorry for the delay.

I do think we need a little better error catching.

```
sage: plot(sin, -4, 4, title='Plot sin(x)', title_pos=.05)
<snip>
   2482         if title is not None:
   2483             if title_pos is not None:
-> 2484                 if len(title_pos) != 2:
   2485                     raise ValueError("`title_pos` must be a list or tuple "
   2486                                      "of two real numbers.")

TypeError: object of type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral' has no len()
```
A subtle difference, but this should also tell the user that `title_pos` must be the right format.
