The following happens with sage-5.6.b2, at least in the debug version from #13864 (I could imagine that the new Cython version from #13896 could be related as well):

```
sage: cython('''cpdef test_funct(x,y): return''')
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getfile
sage: os.path.exists(sage_getfile(test_funct))
False
```

IIRC, it used to work. hence, I suppose some paths have changed.

Could it be that simply Cython is writing the wrong information into the doc?

```
sage: _sage_getdoc_unformatted(test_funct)
'File: _home_simon__sage_temp_linux_sqwp_site_6004_tmp_rJ1Nyc_spyx_0.pyx (starting at line 6)'
```
But the file is at

```
~/.sage/temp/linux_sqwp.site/6004/tmp_rJ1Nyc.spyx
```
or

```
~/.sage/temp/linux_sqwp.site/6004/spyx/_home_simon__sage_temp_linux_sqwp_site_6004_tmp_rJ1Nyc_spyx/tmp_rJ1Nyc.spyx
```
(they coincide bit-wise). Note that even the ".pyx" information is wrong.

With the attached patch, the following doctest works.

```
        sage: cython('''cpdef test_funct(x,y): return''')
        sage: print open(_extract_embedded_position(inspect.getdoc(test_funct))[1]).read()

        cpdef test_funct(x,y): return
```
The tests of sage/misc/sageinspect.py pass. Needs review!

First, about your patch:
1. it makes sage_getfile work on the box where I have doctest issues, which is positive ;
2. but shouldn't os.path.join(SAGE_ROOT,'devel/sage', raw_filename) be os.path.join(SAGE_ROOT, 'devel', 'sage', raw_filename)? You're basically assuming that '/' is the path separator, which is perhaps a portability problem.

On the box where I patched paths, the source file looks like this:

```

include "sage/ext/stdsage.pxi"  # ctrl-c interrupt block support

include "cdefs.pxi"
cpdef test_funct(x,y): return
```

while on another, unpatched, box (again, initial empty line is eaten by trac) it is:

```
include "interrupt.pxi"  # ctrl-c interrupt block support
include "stdsage.pxi"  # ctrl-c interrupt block support

include "cdefs.pxi"
cpdef test_funct(x,y): return
```
