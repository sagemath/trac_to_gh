Since this is the ultimate "can generate segfaults anywhere", it's a prime candidate for blocker status. However, we're fully at the mercy of cython developers as to when this gets fixed. Also, if we release with this bug unfixed, we might as well leave #715 in too, since this one has a much wider possible impact :-).

Ok, Ive put it as blocker.

For those who want to play while waiting for upstream, I've posted a p0 Cython spkg which does "something" with PyObject_GC_[Un]Track.
Not sure it makes any sense, but it seems to make our bug disappear.

Apologies. I saw I linked to the wrong file. [Include/object.h](http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Include/object.h) also has some interesting information, but it looks like it is a bit out-of-date on some bits. In particular, if you look at the actual use of the TRASHCAN macros:

```
    PyObject_GC_UnTrack(self);
    ++_PyTrash_delete_nesting;
    Py_TRASHCAN_SAFE_BEGIN(self);
    --_PyTrash_delete_nesting;
...
  endlabel:
    ++_PyTrash_delete_nesting;
    Py_TRASHCAN_SAFE_END(self);
    --_PyTrash_delete_nesting;
```
with the explanation a little lower:

```
       Q. Why the bizarre (net-zero) manipulation of
          _PyTrash_delete_nesting around the trashcan macros?

       A. Some base classes (e.g. list) also use the trashcan mechanism.
          The following scenario used to be possible:

          - suppose the trashcan level is one below the trashcan limit

          - subtype_dealloc() is called

          - the trashcan limit is not yet reached, so the trashcan level
        is incremented and the code between trashcan begin and end is
        executed

          - this destroys much of the object's contents, including its
        slots and __dict__

          - basedealloc() is called; this is really list_dealloc(), or
        some other type which also uses the trashcan macros

          - the trashcan limit is now reached, so the object is put on the
        trashcan's to-be-deleted-later list

          - basedealloc() returns

          - subtype_dealloc() decrefs the object's type

          - subtype_dealloc() returns

          - later, the trashcan code starts deleting the objects from its
        to-be-deleted-later list

          - subtype_dealloc() is called *AGAIN* for the same object

          - at the very least (if the destroyed slots and __dict__ don't
        cause problems) the object's type gets decref'ed a second
        time, which is *BAD*!!!

          The remedy is to make sure that if the code between trashcan
          begin and end in subtype_dealloc() is called, the code between
          trashcan begin and end in basedealloc() will also be called.
          This is done by decrementing the level after passing into the
          trashcan block, and incrementing it just before leaving the
          block.

          But now it's possible that a chain of objects consisting solely
          of objects whose deallocator is subtype_dealloc() will defeat
          the trashcan mechanism completely: the decremented level means
          that the effective level never reaches the limit.      Therefore, we
          *increment* the level *before* entering the trashcan block, and
          matchingly decrement it after leaving.  This means the trashcan
          code will trigger a little early, but that's no big deal.
```
It's probably better to leave out the trashcan for now. It seems like rather tricky code and I'm not sure it's part of the official Python C-API (it might be something internal, just like they use some macros themselves they find unsafe for use in extension modules)

I saw and read about this additional steps in addition to the macro, but I was not sure it was also needed here.

Anyway I agree it is a better take to leave that out for now, and anyway, upstream will decide what is the best.

So I've updated the spkg to not include the trashcan parts.

Just one potentially naive question:
shouldn't the object get retracked iff you're going to call another dealloc method?
or conversely, if the type does not extend a previous type, shouldn't the object stay untracked when you call tp_free?
I'm not sure it would really matter if the object is still tracked in this latter case, but I got this feeling when staring at CPython's code today.

Anyway, it just made me think of what will happen if your extension class is GC tracked, but the base class is not? In this case you're lost because if you track your object before calling the base dealloc, then you will not untrack it there. Is that even possible? And anyway if a class is not gc tracked, or is not a container I guess it cannot be weakrefed...

Sorry to insist a little bit, but while looking at the trashcan stuff, I thought again about it and in fact what I was worried about was rather the converse.

If the base type does not have the GC_FLAG, and youve retracked it in the subclass, then final tp_free will indeed not touch anything related to gc, but won't that leave an invalid object in the gc tracked object list?
In particular won't a call to gc_list_remove(o) be missing?

The base tp_free looks at the actual type's flags (which will have GC_FLAG set) to determine what gc (un)tracking to do. Any intermediate superclasses will either leave this alone or do the untrack/track dance.

I think it helps to look at the generated code. Suppose one has

```
cdef class A: ...
cdef class B(A): ...
cdef class C(B): ...
...
```

In this case one has, roughly, 

```
tp_dealloc_A(self) {
   [optional untrack]
   bodyA
   [optional track]
   PY_TYPE(self)->tp_free(self)
}

tp_dealloc_B(self) {
   [optional untrack]
   bodyB
   [optional track]
   tp_dealloc_A(self)
}

tp_dealloc_C(self) {
   [optional untrack]
   bodyC
   [optional track]
   tp_dealloc_B(self)
}

...

```

bodyX consists of decrefing Python members, traversing weakrefs, and (if present)

```
PyRef(self)++;
X.__dealloc__(self);
PyRef(self)--;
```

The track/untrack markers are added exactly when Python/weakref members are present, which is where a garbage collection might happen.  (When executing `__dealloc__` the refcount is incremented, also preventing garbage collection.)

What could be an issue is a non-gc-tracked container class that is subclassed by a gc-tracked class, but we don't have those in Cython.

That is exactly what I was thinking about, and IIRC what is looked for in the CPython subtype_dealloc when looking for the base type.
