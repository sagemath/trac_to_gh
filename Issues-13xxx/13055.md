<div id="comment:0"></div>

Drop the `_numerical_approx` method, instead use `numerical_approx`. Move the generic implementation to a new Cython file. Also put the conversion of decimal digits to bits in one place.

Finally, the documentation of `numerical_approx` should be made more clear and consistent.

Exactly, which is why I didn't use that example.

Okay, I don't have that much invested in this.   But then 

```
sage: x = 1.2340000000000000000000001
sage: x.n?
Docstring:
   Return a numerical approximation of x with at least prec bits of
   precision.

   EXAMPLES:

      sage: (2/3).n()
      0.666666666666667
      sage: pi.n(digits=10)
      3.141592654
      sage: pi.n(prec=20)   # 20 bits
      3.1416

   TESTS:

   Check that http://trac.sagemath.org/14778 is fixed:

      sage: (0).n(algorithm='foo')
      0.000000000000000
```
should really be improved, and possibly the documentation for other versions of `.numerical_approx` as well.  Those are practically stubs!

This is actually a general problem we have with Sage documentation: often one has similar functions/methods which all do the same thing (on different kinds of objects). In this case, the `numerical_approx` function in `src/sage/misc/functional.py` is much better documented.

<div id="comment:24" align="right">comment:24</div>

Most of the changes look good to me, but I don't like the new description of `RealLiteral.numerical_approx()`: as far as I understand “real literals” are exact decimal numbers, so converting one to a `RealField` element with d·log₁₀ 2 bits of precision doesn't really “change its precision” to d decimal digits.

And—just wondering, I have nothing against that choice—is there a reason why you didn't put the generic implementation directly in `Element` (and put code to convert non-Elements to Elements before calling it when necessary)?

Because of the "put code to convert non-Elements to Elements before calling it" part. I don't know how to do that in general.
