<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

It was necessary to do some cleanup in `sage.doctest.sources.DocTestSource`: now it just stores an options object rather than separate options that it cares about.

There will be some double counting if optional tests are marked with multiple tags.

For ReST files with inner sources we'll also miss the optional tests in the inner sources.

Both issues seem minor enough that they're not worth the extra code complexity.

Could you add a test to `sage/doctest/test.py` to test a complete `sage -t --show-skipped` run (also checking that optional tests which are run are not reported).

And I would enable `--show-skipped` automatically when `--verbose` is given.

Line 405, you could replace

```
untested = optionals["not tested"] + optionals["not implemented"]
```
by

```
untested = optionals.pop("not tested") + optionals.pop("not implemented")
```
Then you don't need to check for "not tested" or "not implemented" further.

And I think the translation "known bug" -> "bug" should better be moved inside the `parse_optional_tags()` function itself.
