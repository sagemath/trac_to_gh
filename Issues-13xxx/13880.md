Why `available_swap() in ZZ`?




I'm not sure whether the fallback value of `virtual_memory_limit()` (`self.available_swap() + self.available_ram()`) is appropriate.

It doesn't take into account the memory already used by the process, and the available (or total) swap can be much larger than what's available to *a single process* (e.g. 16 GB swap space on a 32-bit processor or OS); similar for the RAM "available".

To test that it returns an integer as promised in the docstring.

Not that obvious, to me at least... ;-)

Still wonder whether we shouldn't also test that the result is actually non-negative.




> I've added a manual 2GB limit for the rare case of 32-bit machines with >> 2GB ram.

Ok.  (The more common case -- which I meant -- is having >> 2 GB *swap space*, which is handled now as well.)




Slightly related (`memory_info.py` probably deserved its own ticket):

`available_ram()` should probably have an optional boolean parameter to not just return the amount of *free* memory ("`MemFree`"), as this can often be pretty close to zero, due to buffering and especially caching.  (I.e., the amount of "available" RAM, allocatable by a process without running out of [physical] memory, might in fact be much larger, regardless of whether swap space is available or not.)  

As is, although its docstring contains "free" in parentheses, the term "available RAM" is IMHO potentially misleading.

W.r.t. GAP, I think it may currently "run out of memory" simply because [there's no or not enough swap space *and*] most (or at least much) of the physical memory is eaten up by just caches.

I'm sure you can improve on `available_ram()` but its good enough for starting GAP, I think. The perfect is the enemy of the good.

For libGAP the pool is actually in the Sage process, so what Jeroen suggests would be a bad idea.

Also, I don't think the user's intention when setting `ulimit -v` was for Sage to spawn a couple of processes that each try to get as close as possible to the limit.

No, because this ticket doesn't refer to libGAP.

I don't think the user intends GAP to take 1/10th of the memory either. If I would set the memory limit to 2GB and GAP doesn't want to allocate 300MB, I would be quite surprised.

I do agree this is all bikeshedding, that's why I intentionally don't set this to needs_work.

The libGAP discussion IMHO belongs to another ticket (and is IMHO pretty irrelevant at this point).

Would it make sense to use a different pool size for doctesting (i.e., a close[r]-to-minimal one)?




I still believe the current implementation will prevent GAP from working if the RAM is filled up with buffers and caches (and there's no or "not enough" swap space), which to me doesn't seem to be too untypical.  Haven't tried yet though.

> The libGAP discussion is relevant because they share the function to determine the pool size.

Perhaps the `suggested_size` routine needs a flag `for_libgap=true/false` then, to compute appropriate defaults for either situation. Obviously, the two cases ask for separate considerations in the face of per-process limits.

Isn't this ticket dealing with a sage in which libgap is non-existent? patching this upon introduction of libgap is rather straightforward.

That's what I meant with (currently) "irrelevant".  (Besides that libGAP may come with a new / alternate memory manager when Sage is "ready" for it.)

I am testing this on a system where mem.available_swap() comes up negative:

```
sage: t = mem._parse_proc_meminfo(); t
{'available_ram': 1435963392, 'total_swap': 10909376512, 'available_swap': 8558673920, 'Committed_AS': 16000847872, 'total_ram': 7929249792}
sage: mem.available_swap()
-5091471360
```
which is not surprising, as mem.available_swap() computes ` t['total_swap']-t['Committed_AS']`, rather than returning `t['available_swap']`. 

What is going on? A bug or a feature?

That's how far I get digging up the cause of

I actually have no clear idea why 'Committed_AS' gets into the picture here. E.g. I read

[Committed_AS: An estimate of how much RAM you would need to make a 99.99% guarantee that there never is OOM (out of memory) for this workload. Normally the kernel will overcommit memory. That means, say you do a 1GB malloc, nothing happens, really. Only when you start USING that malloc memory you will get real memory on demand, and just as much as you use.

While it normally is shared between processes. The Committed_AS is a guesstimate of how much RAM/swap you would need worst-case.](http://www.redhat.com/advice/tips/meminfo.html)

So this is a worst-case estimate, and `info['total_swap'] < info['Committed_AS']` means, from the OS point of view, that you're living on the edge. Well, maybe. And the measurement is taken while `make -j4 ptestlong` on this 4-processor machine.

how about `self._parse_proc_meminfo()['available_swap']` ?

As it is now, this value can be different from `MemoryInfo().available_swap()`, and this is rather confusing.

but we also know that this might be a huge overestimate.

> So `Total-Committed_AS` is a good approximation. 

at least it should be named differently, not `MemoryInfo().available_swap()`, to avoid the clash with `self._parse_proc_meminfo()['available_swap']`

Yes it can go negative if the kernel is overcommitting, but one could argue that it is then to be expected that a negative number is returned. In any case, it works as I intended it. If you have a better metric for available swap that doesn't involve going through the VM allocations of every process then I'd be happy to implement that. But in its present state it is good enough for starting GAP; if `Committed_AS > Total` then you probably want the minimial sized pool for GAP.

This is not enough.
I still get 

```
File "/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.6.beta2/devel/sage-main/sage/misc/memory_info.py", line 122:
    sage: mem.virtual_memory_limit() > 0
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```

virtual_memory_limit() as implemented is too conservative, I think. Indeed:

```
sage: from sage.misc.memory_info import MemoryInfo
sage: mem = MemoryInfo()
sage: mem.av
mem.available_ram   mem.available_swap  
sage: mem.available_swap()
-5123952640
sage: mem.available_ram() 
1262751744
sage: mem.virtual_memory_limit()
-3861200896
```

unless you will allow virtual_memory_limit() be negative, too, but this is IMHO even weirder...
Shouldn't an implementation respect the overcommitting settings somehow?

Why don't you use 'free_swap' instead of 'available_swap' ?
This reflects the reality and the system settings (for overcommitting) far better.

The docstring for virtual memory limit  says:

```
    This is the value set by ``ulimit -v`` at the command line or
    a practical limit if no limit is set.
```
This does not describe the current implementation. (And it wasn't really true before, either).

because you neither return **the** value X set by ``ulimit -v`` (you return X+Y, for some nonzero Y), nor anything practical (no single process can reach this limit, ever) to speak about.

Are you sure? I do return RLIMIT_AS if set:

```
[vbraun@volker-desktop ~]$ ulimit -v 12341234
[vbraun@volker-desktop ~]$ sage 
...
sage: from sage.misc.memory_info import MemoryInfo  
sage: MemoryInfo().virtual_memory_limit()
12637423616
sage: _/1024
12341234
```
And you probably can request total ram+swap thanks to overcommit if not much else is going on or the overcommit ratio is stupidly high.
