```
sage: R, x = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ, 'x', default_prec = 80).objgen()
sage: f = x + x^2
sage: f.parent()
Power Series Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: f.parent().default_prec()
80
sage: g = 1/f
sage: g.parent()
Laurent Series Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: g.parent().default_prec()
20     (??????)
```

In the mean time I added doctests to laurent_series_ring.py

The example in change_ring could be more illustrative, though the test you have there is useful as well. 

Line 144-146, one space extra indentation.

Bug in is_field, namely

```
sage: LaurentSeriesRing(ZZ, 't').is_field()
True
```


In `_repr_`, test a sparse ring as well.

It'd be nice to show at least one example (and non-example?) of each of the bullet points in _coerce_impl. 

All of these points are fairly minor, but we might as well attack them while we're here.  Other than that, looks good.
