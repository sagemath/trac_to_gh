When I run two notebooks (different directories) at the same time, then I am logged out of one, when doing something in the other. More precisely:

- run notebook 1, open worksheet A
- run notebook 2, open worksheet B
- now click 'Home' in worksheet A, and you will be asked to log in again

This happens since 5.2.
