ComplexIntervalField elements do not have multiplicative order implemented whereas their counterpart ComplexField elements (ComplexNumber) does.

Also uncomment the `_set_multiplicative_order()` in `ComplexIntervalField.zeta()` once done (I commented this out in #13618 to make the function work which is the dependency).

**Assignee:** @tscrim

**Keywords:** multiplicative order, complex interval field
