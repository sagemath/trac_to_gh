I've uploaded an updated spkg using the tarball Burcin provided at
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/pynac-0.2.6.spkg

I've not run the whole testsuite yet, only the symbolic directory, but there seems to be problems left with parenthesis around exponents (#13262), let's hope I messed something.
