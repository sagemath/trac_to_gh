As it was noticed in ticket #13215, inversion in Polynomial Quotient Rings does not work quite well:

```
sage: Z16x.<x> = Integers(16)[]
sage: GR.<y> =  Z16x.quotient(x^2 + x + 1)
sage: (2*y)^(-1)
15*y + 15
sage: (2*y)*(2*y)^(-1)
2
```

I attach a small patch "fixing" this problem: with the patch, a NotImplemetedError is raised when the base ring is not a field.
