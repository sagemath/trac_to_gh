This plots fine.

```
Z = Polyhedron([[2,3,3],[3,0,3],[2,6,1],[1,0,1],[6,7,2]])
z = Z.plot()
z
```
Now try adding a point.

```
z+point3d((0,0,0),size=30,color='red')
```
This looks fine too.

```
z
```
And now we've added a point to the polyhedron!

This was originally noticed at [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1628/3d-graphics-bug) inside an interact, where, as one might imagine, it would be particularly annoying.
