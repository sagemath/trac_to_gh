This just replaces the dead scipy mirror with some reliable ones. Also, the directory must be spkg, not packages (just a matter of symlinking, but it's the other way round right now).

Note: this applies inside $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/

When googling for "Sage optional packages", I get this link:

```
http://www.sagemath.org/packages/optional/
```

Note that it uses "packages", not "spkg".  So I don't think it should be changed in the script.  Or you should at least say why it should be changed.

jdemeyer: i haven't thoroughly  checked this, but what I observed is, that on the mirrors it's spkg. This is probably due to some symlinks&rsync server stuff and so on.

E.g.

```
http://ftp.sh.cvut.cz/MIRRORS/sagemath/packages/
vs.
http://ftp.sh.cvut.cz/MIRRORS/sagemath/spkg/
```

Obviously, therefore downloading from another mirror fails. Plan B would be to figure out how to fix this for all mirrors.
