Currently, there is no gcd for padic numbers:

```
sage: R = Zp(3)
sage: R.one().gcd(R.zero())
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.padics.padic_capped_relative_element.pAdicCappedRelativeElement' object has no attribute 'gcd'
```

The attached patch implements it.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Julian,

I get the following

```
sage: R=Zp(3)
sage: a=R(O(3^3))
sage: a.gcd(3^4)
3^3 + O(3^23)
```

In this case, I would expect that the gcd is O(3^3), because a is an element of valuation at least 3. What do you think?

Also, if I compare your branch with develop there are two unused import statements:

```
from sage.libs.pari.gen import PariError
import sage.rings.rational_field
```
