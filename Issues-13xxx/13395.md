The GCC spkg broke upgrading from old Sage versions because of the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` not containing `lib32` or `lib64`.  We can fix this using Leif's idea of `sage-env` versioning (see #10469).

We should also rebuild GCC if `gcc` was already installed before.

I've tried upgrading using this patch, and several times I've gotten an error with R:

```

True.

> I don't think this is an issue, but it was one of the points of #10469. Should I be concerned about this?

Personally, I am not concerned about this.  I don't see a problem (apart from efficiency perhaps) with having duplicate `PATH` or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` entries.  Also note that #10469 did not point out a particular problem that this causes.

Also remember that this can happen only *during* upgrading.
