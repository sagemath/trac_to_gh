The GCC spkg broke upgrading from old Sage versions because of the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` not containing `lib32` or `lib64`.  We can fix this using Leif's idea of `sage-env` versioning (see #10469).

We should also rebuild GCC if `gcc` was already installed before.

Why doesn't touching `spkg/installed/gcc-*` before going an upgrade cause all packages that depend on gcc to be rebuilt? Oh, I see, nothing actually depends on gcc.

I've tried upgrading using this patch, and several times I've gotten an error with R:

```
mkdir /Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/sage-5.X-upgrade/local/lib/R/include
mkdir: /Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/sage-5.X-upgrade/local/lib/R/include: File exists
```
And sure enough, there is a *file* (not a directory) `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/R/include`. It's not from the previous installation, since the spkg-install file deletes `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/R/`. I'm guessing that it's not related to this ticket. Have you ever seen this before?

Personally, I am not concerned about this.  I don't see a problem (apart from efficiency perhaps) with having duplicate `PATH` or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` entries.  Also note that #10469 did not point out a particular problem that this causes.

Also remember that this can happen only *during* upgrading.
