Starting with sage-5.2, the `require_login=False` option doesn't work any more: It requires you to set an admin password, on the console, before starting the notebook. This is very inconvenient for any kind of "one-click start notebook" packaging. It should not ask for any password, thats the whole point of not requiring login.

```

[vbraun@laptop ~]$ sage -notebook require_login=False
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 5.2, Release Date: 2012-07-25                         |
| Type "notebook()" for the browser-based notebook interface.        |
| Type "help()" for help.                                            |
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Please wait while the Sage Notebook server starts...
...
notebook(require_login=False)
The notebook files are stored in: sage_notebook.sagenb



Please choose a new password for the Sage Notebook 'admin' user.
Do _not_ choose a stupid password, since anybody who could guess your password
and connect to your machine could access or delete your files.
NOTE: Only the hash of the password you type is stored by Sage.
You can change your password by typing notebook(reset=True).
```
Obviously you need to erase `$DOT_SAGE/sage_notebook.sagenb/users.pickle` to reproduce this.

I had the following code in the sage virtual appliance build script:

```
    from sage.misc.misc import DOT_SAGE
    directory = DOT_SAGE+'sage_notebook'
    nb = sagenb.notebook.notebook.load_notebook(directory)
    nb.add_user('admin', 'sage', '', force=True)
    nb.save()
    quit
```
This doesn't work any more since `add_user` was removed in sage-5.2.
