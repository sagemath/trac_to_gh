`cholesky_decomposition()` is needlessly verbose, and the existing spaghetti code with `_cholesky_decomposition()` is too convoluted to unwind.  Dependencies install the **new** `cholesky()` alongside.

The old `cholesky_decomposition()` is so broken that nobody should be using it anyway, thus it should be no problem to obsolete it.

More seriously, the caching means that this broken, crappy function can infect the new, correct function:

```
sage: r = matrix(CDF, 2, 2, [ 1, -2*I, 2*I, 0 ]); r
[   1.0 -2.0*I]
[ 2.0*I    0.0]
sage: r[0,0] = 0
sage: r.cholesky_decomposition()
[        0.0         0.0]
[NaN + NaN*I NaN + NaN*I]
sage: r.cholesky()
[        0.0         0.0]
[NaN + NaN*I NaN + NaN*I]
```
The documentation makes it clear that `cholesky_decomposition` can return bad answers, but the new function shouldn't be infected by that.

Update patch addresses reviewer comments: cholesky is linked in warning, cache strings are separated, and a doctest for that is added.

Apply new patch on top of old.

Separating the caches does show us that the new routine is much faster:

```

sage: %time M.cholesky()
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.03 s
200 x 200 dense matrix over Complex Double Field
sage: %time M.cholesky_decomposition()
