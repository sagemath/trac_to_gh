`cholesky_decomposition()` is needlessly verbose, and the existing spaghetti code with `_cholesky_decomposition()` is too convoluted to unwind.  Dependencies install the **new** `cholesky()` alongside.

The old `cholesky_decomposition()` is so broken that nobody should be using it anyway, thus it should be no problem to obsolete it.

More seriously, the caching means that this broken, crappy function can infect the new, correct function:

```
sage: r = matrix(CDF, 2, 2, [ 1, -2*I, 2*I, 0 ]); r
[   1.0 -2.0*I]
[ 2.0*I    0.0]
sage: r[0,0] = 0
sage: r.cholesky_decomposition()
[        0.0         0.0]
[NaN + NaN*I NaN + NaN*I]
sage: r.cholesky()
[        0.0         0.0]
[NaN + NaN*I NaN + NaN*I]
```
The documentation makes it clear that `cholesky_decomposition` can return bad answers, but the new function shouldn't be infected by that.
