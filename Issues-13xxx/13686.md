Stumbled upon that while analizing sage-on-gentoo test failures. In r.py there are two functions r.version and r_version. But they have the same doctest...

def r_version():
    """
    Return the R version.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: r.version()
        ((2, 14, 0), 'R version 2.14.0 (2011-10-31)')
    """
    return r.version()

Sure r_version returns r.version but r_version should be tested not r.version again surely.

I don't know if it makes any sense to have those two functions available, nor to have `r_version` exported into the global namespace, but this patch still makes sense `:-P`
