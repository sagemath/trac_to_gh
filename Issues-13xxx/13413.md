There are two examples of bugs that this patch corrects.

The first is in the conversion of integers between Symmetrica and Sage:

```
sage: from sage.libs.symmetrica.symmetrica import test_integer
sage: test_integer(2^76)==2^76
False
sage: test_integer(2^75)==2^75
True
```

The second is that coefficients in symmetric function package are not always correct.

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()
sage: c = s(p([1]*36)).coefficient([7,6,5,4,3,3,2,2,1,1,1,1])
sage: c==StandardTableaux([7,6,5,4,3,3,2,2,1,1,1,1]).cardinality()
False
```

This bug is corrected by modifying the Symmetrica spkg to ensure that computations are done assuming that INT's are 4 bytes.

Attachment: **[symmetrica-test.py.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13413/symmetrica-test.py.gz)**

Running the attached file `symmetrica-test.py` exhibits the problem on some machines (e.g., a Mac of some sort, I don't have the specs with me) but on my own laptop (ancient Dell laptop running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS) the test runs out of memory before finding a problem. Curiously enough, for the Mac I tried the problem appears at size 47, same as in the problem description.

I think this shows that the problem is in (or extremely close to) Symmetrica, not Sage itself.

Also, given that the coefficients change even without any intervening computations, I strongly suspect that we're seeing a memory leak in Symmetrica, not an integer overflow error. Most likely,
1. Symmetrica computes some result,
2. caches a pointer to the result,
3. frees the memory containing the result,
4. this memory eventually gets reused,
5. so the cached result now points to garbage.

It's interesting to note that the error only seems to happen when dealing with coefficients in `QQ`, not in `ZZ`, as Anne's testing shows. However, given the state of the Symmetrica source code, I'm not optimistic about actually finding (and fixing) the bug.

Do we know if there are other changes of basis which exhibit similar problems?

For convenience, note that the content of `symmetrica-test.py` is simply:

```
from sage.all import QQ, ZZ, Partition
from sage.libs.symmetrica.all import t_POWSYM_SCHUR as convert
from time import time

one = QQ(1)
bad_input = {Partition([ZZ(2)] * 2): one}

good_output = convert(bad_input)

start_time = time()
k = 1
while True:
    dummy = convert({Partition([ZZ(1)] * k): one})
    if convert(bad_input) != good_output: break
    print 'Size %d seems fine after %d seconds.' % (k, time() - start_time)
    k += 1

print 'Found a problem at size %d:' % k
for k in range(10):
    print convert(bad_input)
```

This problem is much worse than originally stated.  Mercedes Rosas contacted me and said that they are getting strange answers for calculations in the symmetric function package.  I started to do some experiments.

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()
sage: %time s(p([1]*36))==sum(StandardTableaux(la).cardinality()*s(la) for la in Partitions(36))
CPU times: user 91.50 s, sys: 0.26 s, total: 91.75 s
Wall time: 91.65 s
False
sage: s(p([1]*35))==sum(StandardTableaux(la).cardinality()*s(la) for la in Partitions(35))
True
sage: s(p[2,2])
s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 2*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
```
The first statement should return `True` and the second and third are not returning the clearly false coefficients that we are seeing when the calculation goes as high as degree 47.

WARNING: calculations using the symmetric function package should not be believed beyond a certain degree.  I will continue to see what we can do to track down this bug.

Hmmm.  I wonder if this has something to do with Mac's being a 64 bit architecture?  I checked the size of the coefficients for `[1]*35` v. `[1]*36` and found:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()
sage: g = s(p([1]*35))
sage: max(float(log(c)/log(2)) for c in g.coefficients())
62.76221725889632
sage: g = s(p([1]*36))
sage: max(float(log(c)/log(2)) for c in g.coefficients())
64.9241936394965
```

I suspect the function `_py_longint` in symmetrica.pxi is at fault but I haven't been able to track down some of the definitions in that file.

There is a function `test_integer` in the symmetrica package.  It passes on some integers, but not all!

```
sage: from sage.libs.symmetrica.symmetrica import test_integer
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()
sage: g = s(p([1]*35))
sage: all( test_integer(c)==c for c in g.coefficients())
True
sage: g = s(p([1]*36))
sage: all( test_integer(c)==c for c in g.coefficients())
False
sage: c=StandardTableaux([10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]).cardinality()
sage: test_integer(c)==c
False
```

Mike H. posted a test.c program to try out in Symmetrica.

#include "def.h"

ANFANG
scan(POW_SYM,a);

Run this program with input "36" followed by thirty-six "1"'s, followed by "1" (to indicate an integer coefficient), followed by "1" (to indicate that the coefficient is 1) "n" and the output says again `5.061293.630159.021056  111122334567`.  This means that the error is within Symmetrica.

I've spent some time looking through the Symmetrica code.  It is not hard to figure out the basic ideas behind the library, but it uses some very terse C, non-obvious abbreviations, and a mix of German and English.  It also has very little documentation.

Symmetrica "longints" are a structure of three INTs w2,w1,w0 with 0<=w_i<=`2^15-1` plus a pointer to the next batch of 3 or NULL.

I've played with some programs that do some addition and multiplication with these longints and I haven't been able to make them fail, but it must be that in the calculation of `p([1]*36)` that some arithmetic fails when some overflow occurs.  It will almost definitely easier to identify the bug in the library than to adapt it to another data structure.

Lets do the same thing by hand in sage:

```
sage: 1003805253100650000+1357888495095475200
2361693748196125200

sage: _+2252538987957858600
9617543213888332800
```
Notice that as soon as I add two 'integer' objects together so that they become a 'longint' object (marked by where the program starts printing out periods in the number) the answer is wrong.  So now I just have to find the routine which adds two ints and gives an overflow into longints.

Error installing package symmetrica-2.0.p8
************************************************************************
Please email sage-devel (http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel)
explaining the problem and including the relevant part of the log file
  /Applications/sage/logs/pkgs/symmetrica-2.0.p8.log
Describe your computer, operating system, etc.
If you want to try to fix the problem yourself, *don't* just cd to
/Applications/sage/spkg/build/symmetrica-2.0.p8 and type 'make' or whatever is appropriate.
Instead, the following commands setup all environment variables
correctly and load a subshell for you to debug the error:
  (cd '/Applications/sage/spkg/build/symmetrica-2.0.p8' && '/Applications/sage/sage' --sh)
When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the subshell.
************************************************************************

Any ideas?

The original description points to "some wrapper functions around symmetrica."  This is probably still the case.

Ubuntu in a virtualbox, 64bit, sage 5.13.beta0 with patches installed (hopefully correctly: I -i'd symmetrica 2.0p8, but I never explicitly uninstalled 2.0p7).

Exhibit A:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: 
sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()
sage: g = s(p([1]*47))
sage: g.coefficient([9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,2,1])
14333651730948448927581696000
sage: g = s(p([1]*47))
sage: g.coefficient([9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,2,1])
14333651730948448927581696000
```

Exhibit B:

```
sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).powersum()
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).schur()
sage: 
sage: s(p[2,2])
s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 2*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
sage: time g = s(p([1]*47))
/home/darij/sage-5.13.beta0/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/misc/sage_extension.py:371: DeprecationWarning: Use %time instead of time.
See http://trac.sagemath.org/12719 for details.
  line = f(line, line_number)
CPU times: user 19.23 s, sys: 0.06 s, total: 19.29 s
Wall time: 19.81 s
sage: s(p[2,2])
s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 2*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
```

This speaks for it being a Mac problem. (No, I don't have one to test.)

Seeing that there really seem to be two separate issues here, can we get the current patch into beta1 without waiting for the Mac issue to be resolved? I am scared of working with Sym now...

EDIT: And to verify that the other issue has been resolved, Exhibit C:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()
sage: %time s(p([1]*36))==sum(StandardTableaux(la).cardinality()*s(la) for la in Partitions(36))
CPU times: user 122.02 s, sys: 0.52 s, total: 122.53 s
Wall time: 129.03 s

Many thanks for this, Mike and Jeroen!!

@@ -1,57 +1,26 @@
-To begin with, let's do a change of basis in a small degree:
+There are two examples of bugs that this patch corrects.
+
+The first is in the conversion of integers between Symmetrica and Sage:
 
 ```
-    sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).powersum()
-    sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).schur()
-    sage: s(p[2,2])
-    s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 2*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
+sage: from sage.libs.symmetrica.symmetrica import test_integer
+sage: test_integer(2^76)==2^76
+False
+sage: test_integer(2^75)==2^75
+True
 ```
-Now let's do one in a larger degree:
+
+The second is that coefficients in symmetric function package are not always correct.
 
 ```
-    sage: time g = s(p([1]*47))
-    Time: CPU 19.16 s, Wall: 20.91 s
-```
-Now let's do that first one again:
-
-```
-    sage: s(p[2,2])
-    s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 4571483302*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
-```
-That's not the correct answer ! And the next time you ask Sage, it
-gives different, still incorrect, answers:
-
-```
-    sage: s(p[2,2])
-    s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 4614252243*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
-    sage: s(p[2,2])
-    s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 4634718110*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
-    sage: s(p[2,2])
-    s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 4631047636*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
+sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
+sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()
+sage: c = s(p([1]*36)).coefficient([7,6,5,4,3,3,2,2,1,1,1,1])
+sage: c==StandardTableaux([7,6,5,4,3,3,2,2,1,1,1,1]).cardinality()
+False
 ```
 
-In [this discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-combinat-devel/fWMuS4R5M9Q/discussion) on sage-combinat-devel, Anne noticed that the problem is "not symmetrica per se, but some wrapper functions around symmetrica, as the following example shows":
-
-```
-sage: f = eval('symmetrica.t_POWSYM_SCHUR')
-sage: f({Partition([2,2]):Integer(1)})
-s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 2*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
-sage: time g = f({Partition([1]*47):Integer(1)})
-Time: CPU 13.03 s, Wall: 13.04 s
-sage: f({Partition([2,2]):Integer(1)})
-s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 2*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
