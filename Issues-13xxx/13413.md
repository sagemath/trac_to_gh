There are two examples of bugs that this patch corrects.

The first is in the conversion of integers between Symmetrica and Sage:

```
sage: from sage.libs.symmetrica.symmetrica import test_integer
sage: test_integer(2^76)==2^76
False
sage: test_integer(2^75)==2^75
True
```

The second is that coefficients in symmetric function package are not always correct.

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()
sage: c = s(p([1]*36)).coefficient([7,6,5,4,3,3,2,2,1,1,1,1])
sage: c==StandardTableaux([7,6,5,4,3,3,2,2,1,1,1,1]).cardinality()
False
```

This bug is corrected by modifying the Symmetrica spkg to ensure that computations are done assuming that INT's are 4 bytes.

Attachment [symmetrica-test.py](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket13413/symmetrica-test.py) by @mguaypaq created at 2012-10-18 21:21:33

Running the attached file `symmetrica-test.py` exhibits the problem on some machines (e.g., a Mac of some sort, I don't have the specs with me) but on my own laptop (ancient Dell laptop running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS) the test runs out of memory before finding a problem. Curiously enough, for the Mac I tried the problem appears at size 47, same as in the problem description.

I think this shows that the problem is in (or extremely close to) Symmetrica, not Sage itself.

Also, given that the coefficients change even without any intervening computations, I strongly suspect that we're seeing a memory leak in Symmetrica, not an integer overflow error. Most likely,
1. Symmetrica computes some result,
2. caches a pointer to the result,
3. frees the memory containing the result,
4. this memory eventually gets reused,
5. so the cached result now points to garbage.

It's interesting to note that the error only seems to happen when dealing with coefficients in `QQ`, not in `ZZ`, as Anne's testing shows. However, given the state of the Symmetrica source code, I'm not optimistic about actually finding (and fixing) the bug.

Do we know if there are other changes of basis which exhibit similar problems?

For convenience, note that the content of `symmetrica-test.py` is simply:

```
from sage.all import QQ, ZZ, Partition
from sage.libs.symmetrica.all import t_POWSYM_SCHUR as convert
from time import time

one = QQ(1)
bad_input = {Partition([ZZ(2)] * 2): one}

good_output = convert(bad_input)

start_time = time()
k = 1
while True:
    dummy = convert({Partition([ZZ(1)] * k): one})
    if convert(bad_input) != good_output: break
    print 'Size %d seems fine after %d seconds.' % (k, time() - start_time)
    k += 1

print 'Found a problem at size %d:' % k
for k in range(10):
    print convert(bad_input)
```

This problem is much worse than originally stated.  Mercedes Rosas contacted me and said that they are getting strange answers for calculations in the symmetric function package.  I started to do some experiments.

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()
sage: %time s(p([1]*36))==sum(StandardTableaux(la).cardinality()*s(la) for la in Partitions(36))
CPU times: user 91.50 s, sys: 0.26 s, total: 91.75 s
Wall time: 91.65 s
False
sage: s(p([1]*35))==sum(StandardTableaux(la).cardinality()*s(la) for la in Partitions(35))
True
sage: s(p[2,2])
s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 2*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
```
The first statement should return `True` and the second and third are not returning the clearly false coefficients that we are seeing when the calculation goes as high as degree 47.

WARNING: calculations using the symmetric function package should not be believed beyond a certain degree.  I will continue to see what we can do to track down this bug.

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()

sage: g = s(p([1]*35))
sage: max(float(log(c)/log(2)) for c in g.coefficients())

sage: g = s(p([1]*36))
sage: max(float(log(c)/log(2)) for c in g.coefficients())

I suspect the function `_py_longint` in symmetrica.pxi is at fault but I haven't been able to track down some of the definitions in that file.

Ouch.

I can't help with understanding C code, but if anyone needs some of the German in Symmetrica translated, I can help.

Has the error so far only occurred in high degrees or with big coefficients only, or should all of Sym be considered a minefield until further notice?

Mike H. posted a test.c program to try out in Symmetrica.

```
#include "def.h"
#include "macro.h"

ANFANG
scan(POW_SYM,a); 
t_POWSYM_SCHUR(a, b); 
println(b); 
ENDE
```
Run this program with input "36" followed by thirty-six "1"'s, followed by "1" (to indicate an integer coefficient), followed by "1" (to indicate that the coefficient is 1) "n" and the output says again `5.061293.630159.021056  111122334567`.  This means that the error is within Symmetrica.

I shouldn't be too rusty with my C, but this might take a combined effort at Sage Days to fully complete it. I'll take a look at the code as well.

Here's my two guesses about the problem from the discussion:

- It is an overflow error and the big fix will be to convert Symmetrica to use mpz instead of the usual machine integers.
- Symmetrica is using its own high precision integers (perhaps with a fixed maximum size) and it's overflowing that block of memory.

I've spent some time looking through the Symmetrica code.  It is not hard to figure out the basic ideas behind the library, but it uses some very terse C, non-obvious abbreviations, and a mix of German and English.  It also has very little documentation.

Symmetrica "longints" are a structure of three INTs w2,w1,w0 with 0<=w_i<=`2^15-1` plus a pointer to the next batch of 3 or NULL.

I've played with some programs that do some addition and multiplication with these longints and I haven't been able to make them fail, but it must be that in the calculation of `p([1]*36)` that some arithmetic fails when some overflow occurs.  It will almost definitely easier to identify the bug in the library than to adapt it to another data structure.

It seems as though ints can be as large as 45 bits and the function `t_int_longint` will still work properly.

Okay, the fix is to make def.h look like the following:

```
#include <stdint.h>

#ifdef __alpha
typedef  int32_t INT;
typedef  uint32_t  UINT;
#else /* __alpha */

Thanks Mike.

The first two lines of def.h read:

I haven't even been able to check that it corrects the problems with the symmetric function calculations in sage.  Essentially there are two problems that need to be checked (or three if you count the first issue that I provide a fix for above).

The first one is that at degree 36 the calculation is not correct.
The second one is that after a calculation at degree 47 the coefficients start to become random.

So I ran on an old copy of sage (no correction installed) on the same linux machine:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()
sage: g = s(p([1]*47))
sage: s(p([1]*5))
s[1, 1, 1, 1, 1] + 4*s[2, 1, 1, 1] + 5*s[2, 2, 1] + 6*s[3, 1, 1] + 5*s[3, 2] + 4*s[4, 1] + s[5]
```

On an old copy of sage on mac (correction installed or not):

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()
sage: g = s(p([1]*47))
sage: s(p([1]*5))
s[1, 1, 1, 1, 1] - 1004621421*s[2, 1, 1, 1] - 2015815354*s[2, 2, 1] - 2018818386*s[3, 1, 1] - 2013245610*s[3, 2] - 1015866049*s[4, 1] + s[5]
```

This means that there are two (at least partially) independent problems going on here.  One of them does not seem to appear on linux machines.  When I run the examples in the patch description, I do not see the random coefficients in the expansion of `s(p([2,2]))`.  Do you see it on boxen?

The original description points to "some wrapper functions around symmetrica."  This is probably still the case.

Ubuntu in a virtualbox, 64bit, sage 5.13.beta0 with patches installed (hopefully correctly: I -i'd symmetrica 2.0p8, but I never explicitly uninstalled 2.0p7).

Exhibit A:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: 
sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()
sage: g = s(p([1]*47))
sage: g.coefficient([9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,2,1])
14333651730948448927581696000
sage: g = s(p([1]*47))
sage: g.coefficient([9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,2,1])
14333651730948448927581696000
```

Exhibit B:

```
sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).powersum()
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).schur()
sage: 
sage: s(p[2,2])
s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 2*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
sage: time g = s(p([1]*47))
/home/darij/sage-5.13.beta0/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/misc/sage_extension.py:371: DeprecationWarning: Use %time instead of time.
See http://trac.sagemath.org/12719 for details.
  line = f(line, line_number)
CPU times: user 19.23 s, sys: 0.06 s, total: 19.29 s
Wall time: 19.81 s
sage: s(p[2,2])
s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 2*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
```

This speaks for it being a Mac problem. (No, I don't have one to test.)

Seeing that there really seem to be two separate issues here, can we get the current patch into beta1 without waiting for the Mac issue to be resolved? I am scared of working with Sym now...

EDIT: And to verify that the other issue has been resolved, Exhibit C:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()
sage: %time s(p([1]*36))==sum(StandardTableaux(la).cardinality()*s(la) for la in Partitions(36))
CPU times: user 122.02 s, sys: 0.52 s, total: 122.53 s
Wall time: 129.03 s

```

Many thanks for this, Mike and Jeroen!!

-To begin with, let's do a change of basis in a small degree:
+There are two examples of bugs that this patch corrects.
+
+The first is in the conversion of integers between Symmetrica and Sage:
 
 ```
-    sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).powersum()
-    sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).schur()
-    sage: s(p[2,2])
-    s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 2*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
+sage: from sage.libs.symmetrica.symmetrica import test_integer
+sage: test_integer(2^76)==2^76
+False
+sage: test_integer(2^75)==2^75
+True
 ```
-Now let's do one in a larger degree:
+
+The second is that coefficients in symmetric function package are not always correct.
 
 ```
-    sage: time g = s(p([1]*47))
-    Time: CPU 19.16 s, Wall: 20.91 s
-```
-Now let's do that first one again:
-
-```
-    sage: s(p[2,2])
-    s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 4571483302*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
-```
-That's not the correct answer ! And the next time you ask Sage, it
-gives different, still incorrect, answers:
-
-```
-    sage: s(p[2,2])
-    s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[2, 1, 1] + 4614252243*s[2, 2] - s[3, 1] + s[4]
