The spkg is at

See also #8515 - Ben, do you have access to one of those Solaris machines?

I just had it pass with `SAGE_CHECK` on Mac OS.  However, the tests in sage/interfaces/frobby.py don't pass.

Otherwise we could really make it an optional package again after all this testing if it worked on Solaris.

I don't have access to drkirkby's machines. Maybe we can get him to test the package out. In any case I don't know anything about Solaris or SPARC platforms.
