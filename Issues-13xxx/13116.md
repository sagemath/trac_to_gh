#12490 introduced a :trac:`12490` role to sphinx, which is typeset into "trac ticket #<hyperlink>". But it does not work on the command line:

```
sage: sage.rings.qqbar?
[...]
    TESTS:
    
    Verify that >>:trac:`10981`<< is fixed: 
```
It should also typeset into a trac link on the command line.

To shorten the urls as much as possible, it would be nice to be able to just say ``http://trac.sagemath.org/12490``. It would be easy to do with ``mod_rewrite``.

Indeed, I should have said that it works in the typeset manual only.

On a related note, it sucks that `sage.misc.sagedoc` calls into sagenb stuff to do the sphinxification. IHMO this should be pulled into the Sage library, the notebook can publish a hook for the documentation formatter of choice.

Here's a version using the shortened urls discussed [in sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/axfWG5mBIKs/discussion).

Typing `sage.misc.sagedoc?` before the patch:

```
...

    TESTS:
    
    Check that argspecs of extension function/methods appear correctly,
    see >>:trac:`12849`<<:
```

After the patch:

```
...

    TESTS:
    
    Check that argspecs of extension function/methods appear correctly,
    see trac ticket #12849 <http://trac.sagemath.org/12849>:
```
So the docstring is longer, so some lines will end up being too long. I personally think that's okay, because of the added information.

How about just `see http://trac.sagemath.org/12849:`. if you know trac you understand that thats the ticket number, and if you don't know trac then the ticket number doesn't help you any more than the url.

Also, I don't really understand why we are reimplementing sphinx here. Shouldn't we make `sphinxify()` spit out the correct urls instead of this bandaid? The `:wikipedia:` sphinx role would then also work, for example.

Sure, that sounds fine.
