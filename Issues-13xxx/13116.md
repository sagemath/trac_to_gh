#12490 introduced a :trac:`12490` role to sphinx, which is typeset into "trac ticket #<hyperlink>". But it does not work on the command line:

```
sage: sage.rings.qqbar?
[...]
    TESTS:
    
    Verify that >>:trac:`10981`<< is fixed: 
```
It should also typeset into a trac link on the command line.

To shorten the urls as much as possible, it would be nice to be able to just say ``http://trac.sagemath.org/12490``. It would be easy to do with ``mod_rewrite``.

Indeed, I should have said that it works in the typeset manual only.

On a related note, it sucks that `sage.misc.sagedoc` calls into sagenb stuff to do the sphinxification. IHMO this should be pulled into the Sage library, the notebook can publish a hook for the documentation formatter of choice.

Here's a version using the shortened urls discussed [in sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/axfWG5mBIKs/discussion).

Typing `sage.misc.sagedoc?` before the patch:

```
...

    TESTS:
    
    Check that argspecs of extension function/methods appear correctly,
    see >>:trac:`12849`<<:
```

After the patch:

```
...

    TESTS:
    
    Check that argspecs of extension function/methods appear correctly,
    see trac ticket #12849 <http://trac.sagemath.org/12849>:
```
So the docstring is longer, so some lines will end up being too long. I personally think that's okay, because of the added information.

How about just `see http://trac.sagemath.org/12849:`. if you know trac you understand that thats the ticket number, and if you don't know trac then the ticket number doesn't help you any more than the url.

Also, I don't really understand why we are reimplementing sphinx here. Shouldn't we make `sphinxify()` spit out the correct urls instead of this bandaid? The `:wikipedia:` sphinx role would then also work, for example.

Sure, that sounds fine.

Looks good. Two tiny nit picks, can we ellipsize the precise Python version (2.7.2) since that is conflicting with #13013 already. Also, the docstring would be perfect with 

```
- ``s`` -- string

(two minus signs before "string").
