Most Sage objects are immutable. Nevertheless, `copy` and `deepcopy` make copies (through pickling/unpickling) for them because we have not provided the classes with `__copy__` methods (which should just return the object) and `__deepcopy__` methods (which in many cases should just return the object).

```
sage: a = 0
sage: copy(a) is a
False
```


Another symptom (from the original ticket description): Copying of (immutable!) `LazyFamily` objects only works for families that can be pickled:

  ```
     sage: def unpicklableFamily():
     ...       x = 10
     ...       return LazyFamily([1,2,3], lambda n: x*n)
     sage: f = unpicklableFamily() 
     sage: copy(f)
     Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
     ValueError: Cannot pickle code objects from closures
  ```

The case of `__deepcopy__` of immutable container-like objects (like `Family` or `Sequence`) is a bit trickier: Is immutability intended to imply that the elements are immutable too? In this ticket, we make no such assumption.

Hi Christian!

Families are (semantically) immutable objects. Why would we want to copy them?

Cheers,

Good point... I stumbled across this issue while I was struggling to create a disjoint union of a dynamically generated family of `LazyFamily` objects, while the *real* problem was that I was using closures with reference to a loop variable. I eventually resolved this issue, and my solution does not requiry any copies now. So I agree that there's no need to create shallow copies.

I **do** think that user code can expect that `copy(any_sage_object)` does not throw an error. Maybe `LazyFamily.__copy__(self)` should just return `self`? This would be in accordance with

   ```
   sage: copy(Integers()) is Integers()
   True
   ```
      
Cheers,
Christian

Hi,

As Nicolas suggested in [his comnent 6](#comment%3A6), `__copy__` should be implemented as

```
def __copy__(self):
    return self
```
It is standard Python for immutable objects

```
sage: t = (1,2,3)
sage: copy(t) is t
True
sage: i = 1231491283r
sage: copy(i) is i
True 
```

Vincent

Right, that is what I was saying that there is an assumption on good input (which is something we can check when necessary).

> From that perspective, I think it can be fairly expensive in general to determine if an object is hashable/really immutable in a generic way (concrete implementations can answer these questions much better), so it might not be such a good idea to let copy/deepcopy really depend on it. I don't see why it's important to optimize the operations anyway: if you're interested in optimizing your code, then you should probably be avoiding unnecessary copying yourself.

Sometimes you are using an algorithm that is designed to handle something that is designed to work with something that does mutate (say, uses `+=`) as it makes a copy to be sure to be safe. Granted, I don't think this occurs so frequently, but it is good to support this case as I don't think it adds that much more to the complexity.

In any case, adding the `__deepcopy__` methods gives some speedup also for mutable vectors:

Before:

```
sage: %timeit deepcopy(vector(ZZ, 100000))                                                                                                                     
396 ms ± 1.67 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```
After:

```
sage: %timeit deepcopy(vector(ZZ, 100000))
1.39 ms ± 15 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
```

For the pattern in [comment:45](#comment%3A45), with #29101 ("Refined protocol for `_element_constructor_  `") we would generally be able to replace `copy(ray)` by `ray.parent()(ray, mutable=True, copy=True)`; but perhaps we should define a shorthand for that.
- #32353 proposes new methods `mutable`, `immutable` for this
- `src/sage/combinat/constellation.py` defines `.mutable_copy`
- `src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py` defines `GenericGraph.copy`, which has a parameter `immutable=None`:
- some classes have `copy` methods with optional arguments that could be extended (see also #32453) to allow `ray.copy(mutable=True)` (proposed in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/DNrbtItMVmQ/m/BbMwM-qeAQAJ)

This pattern -- expecting that `ray.__copy__` (and thus `copy(ray)`) make a mutable copy of an immutable object -- appears to come from a decision made many many years ago in Sage (#111, #6522, #15132, ...). This was probably a good idea at the time, but I think it is not compatible with current Python practices.

Some more data points on other libraries:
- numpy's `ndarray`s (and subclasses) have a `copy` method with an optional parameter that controls the memory layout of the copy; the `__copy__` method is equivalent to one of these choices.
- sympy defines `copy` methods but no `deepcopy`, `__copy__`, or `__deepcopy__` methods
