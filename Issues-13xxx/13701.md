Answering here rather than on list. It is clearly unused unless, may be, by some unidentified optional/experimental spkg. The line you quote is followed by:

William confirmed this - see #13910.

Andr√©, can you do this ticket but without that file included, so that removing it at #13910 won't conflict with the patch here?

I updated the patch to consider changes in the new *conway.py*. That's why this patch now depends on #12205.

Probably not - I just haven't had time to look it all over again.  I tend to need a while, just to make sure I really check everything, and so it can take time... especially with my current non-Sage duties ;-) but I'm not the only potential reviewer out there!

No. The only changes that will be made in #14075 will be to the concerned spkg. Nothing will happen to the sage library. Since spkg-install is python you can comment on it but it is completely orthogonal to this patch.

And I will put this to positive review already. I think you two have done a great job with that and it look good to me.
