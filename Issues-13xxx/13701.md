Answering here rather than on list. It is clearly unused unless, may be, by some unidentified optional/experimental spkg. The line you quote is followed by:

```
sage_makedirs(PATH)
```
which would be making a big splash on any sage-on-gentoo install (or the fedora port by pcpa and before that his Mandriva one). The fact that we haven't noticed seem to indicate that it is never called from anywhere by default.

William confirmed this - see #13910.

Andr√©, can you do this ticket but without that file included, so that removing it at #13910 won't conflict with the patch here?

Probably not - I just haven't had time to look it all over again.  I tend to need a while, just to make sure I really check everything, and so it can take time... especially with my current non-Sage duties ;-) but I'm not the only potential reviewer out there!

No. The only changes that will be made in #14075 will be to the concerned spkg. Nothing will happen to the sage library. Since spkg-install is python you can comment on it but it is completely orthogonal to this patch.

And I will put this to positive review already. I think you two have done a great job with that and it look good to me.
