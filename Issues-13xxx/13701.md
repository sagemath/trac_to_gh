William confirmed this - see #13910.

André, can you do this ticket but without that file included, so that removing it at #13910 won't conflict with the patch here?

No. The only changes that will be made in #14075 will be to the concerned spkg. Nothing will happen to the sage library. Since spkg-install is python you can comment on it but it is completely orthogonal to this patch.

And I will put this to positive review already. I think you two have done a great job with that and it look good to me.
