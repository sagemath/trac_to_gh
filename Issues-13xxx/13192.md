The function compare_edges() of module 'sage.graphs.graph.py' is a simple comparison function used only in function sparse6_string(), and it works only on graphs whose vertices can be compared with the < operator, e.g. integers. Furthermore, the documentation is incomplete.

Suggesting to replace it by a built-in function at the place where it was used.

Apply [attachment: trac_13192-cleanup-v3.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13192/trac_13192-cleanup-v3.patch.gz) and [attachment: trac_13192_whitespace.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13192/trac_13192_whitespace.patch.gz).

Depends on #13109

Okay, okay, - you are making me learn python... ;-)  I took some information from http://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sorting/


How about my following one liner? (included in recent patch)

```
edges.sort(key=lambda e: (e[1],e[0]))
```

This needs Python version >= 2.4 . Is this dependency okay for sage?


Otherwise, we could write

```
edges.sort(cmp=lambda e,f: cmp(e[1],f[1]) or cmp(e[0],f[0]))
```

which seems Python 3.x **incompatible** though not an issue yet.

For testing, I run

```
sage -c "for g in graphs(8): print g.sparse6_string()" > gr8-old.out
```
for all three version (old, key-version, cmp-verison) and the output was the same.


Now, how about giving up the 30 lines of compare_edges() with a good feeling?

Birk

Your update apparently added a lot of whitespace changes again.  Also, what was the doctest error?   Did you change the code at all?

I think generally in doctests we go with 

```
doctest:...: DeprecationWarning: compare
```
instead of 

```
doctest:1: DeprecationWarning: compare
```
in case things were to go in a different order.  At any rate, that's what I've seen.

Also, even if you aren't removing the function, presumably it was still testing something useful.

I agree that it's good (or at least I said I did above!), just that we want to have documentation.

Basically, what you could do is move the tests in the old function to the tests for the actual meaningful function, and then leave only a very minimal doctest in the old function that states that this is deprecated in the docstring, and has *one* test exactly to test the deprecation warning.

Sorry that this is more work, but I think it's good as a model for others as well.

> Your update apparently added a lot of whitespace changes again.

My last update did *not* touch the whitespaces. In a previous update I reduced the number of changed lines from 10 to 6 lines. These trailing whitespace changes are only within the documentation of the method `sparse6_string`, which does not seem to be modified for years(?, ...according to my search on sage-trac). It reads like removing trailing whitespace is forbidden. Hence, I have moved all these changes into a separate file and you are at liberty to exclude or include them - no question asked! ;-)

Am I lying? - joke - Okay, the change was small! It added exactly the line on that you were commenting. When (restoring and) deprecating the old function I did not think about that the deprecation will affect all doctests where this functions is called. (In my case luckily only one place - the doctest of the deprecated function.)

Unfortunately, my first discovery was "doctest:1:" (and there are a few such places in the source code) and I copied that. - Now it is changed.

> Also, even if you aren't removing the function, presumably it was still testing something useful.  Would it be possible to add a graph like the kind Nathann suggests (with non-integer vertices) that shows that this new code is properly comparing, as well as showing it properly compares the edges tested before?  I agree that it's good (or at least I said I did above!), just that we want to have documentation.

The change was about sorting graph edges. Thus, I added some doctests that sort the edges once by the old method and once by the new method and compare the results. As suggested I put these doctests in the deprecated function.

I reduced the old doctests to just one. It will save a few millionths of a second for doctesting ;-) Well, in this case there was not much doctesting to remove...

Sorry, I wasn't meaning to be too picky.  I was just trying to avoid craziness.  I thought maybe your error in doctests was due to the `doctest:1:`, so that is why I harped on it, same with the whitespace, since it seemed to be in an unrelated place.

Anyway, my main point with the testing wasn't to show that it was the same as before (though at least one non-trivial example would be nice), but rather to test the thing *you yourself* (I though it was Nathann) first noted in the description :-) 

```
it works only on graphs whose vertices can be compared with the < operator, e.g. integers
```
So I figured that at least one graph that was not properly representable/represented/could have been bad in the `sparse_6string` format before should be shown to operate properly now.  And that should be in the `sparse_6string` documentation.

I don't think you need to include a million examples in the other doctest, though.  My concern was that whatever the sorting was *for* in normal graphs needed to be tested, and perhaps that is already done elsewhere.

Oh, so you are saying that even with graphs with non-integer (say matrix) edges, there never was a problem?  Only with the silly method itself... I see.  Nathann's comment about "other codes" misled me.

Okay, then this is all a little overkill and I apologize. Now that you've written the deprecation, might as well keep it, but the last thing graph.py needs is lots of long tests, so just remove those tests; I think we've already more than verified here that the results are the same.

I'm attaching a different version.  If you like it, I think this should be ok to go.
