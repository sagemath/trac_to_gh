A Python implementation of the Kolakoski word was implemented some time ago in #8739. But, there exist much faster implementation especially some lines of C code of Dominique Bernardi shared by himself during Sage Days 28 in Orsay, France, in January 2011.

This patch adds a cython version of the code of Bernardi. It is much faster than the actual python implementation in Sage.

BEFORE:

```
sage: K = words.KolakoskiWord() 
sage: K                                          
word: 1221121221221121122121121221121121221221...
sage: time K[100000]           
1                              
Time: CPU 0.96 s, Wall: 1.36 s 
sage: time K[1000000]          # takes forever                            
```

AFTER:

```
sage: K = words.KolakoskiWord()
sage: K                                          
word: 1221121221221121122121121221121121221221...
sage: time K[1000000]                              
2                                                  
Time: CPU 0.01 s, Wall: 0.02 s                     
sage: time K[100000000]                            
1                                                  
Time: CPU 1.38 s, Wall: 1.92 s                     
```

Depends on #12224

Salut Alex,

En fait, un patch de V. Delecroix et Stepan Starosta est en attente et mon ticket ne s'applique plus sur le leur... Je devrais écrire une nouvelle version au courant de la semaine prochaine si tout va bien... Donc, le review de ce ticket est en stand by pour l'instant.

Oups, I wrote in French sorry.

Sébastien
