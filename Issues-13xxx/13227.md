```
sage: R.<x> = CC[[]]
sage: x.subs(x = x**2)
0.0... + 1.0... x
```
is an example.

The reason is that the generic method subs iterates the generators of R (in
this case x) and checks whether any keyword matches the string
representation of that generator. But

```
sage: x._repr_()
0.0... + 1.0... x
```
