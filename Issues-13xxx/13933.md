This was discovered when looking at #12615. Basically, foo(x) eventually calls x.foo() if it exists, but only after doing a lot of symbolic work (resulting in an order of magnitude slowdown for that example).

Looks like our patches crossed mid-air... I just posted a patch that moves the `__call__` up.

Note that using the 3-arg getattr is better than catching an AttributeError both for performance and so we don't mask an error during the call.

Yep, you posted your patch while I was writing this comment.

I rebased your patch on my `move_call.patch` from #1173, but we can just apply yours.

Here are the timings for `sgn()`:

```
sage: load /home/burcin/sage/sign_fn.py
sage: sf = SignFunc()
sage: %timeit sf(5) 
625 loops, best of 3: 378 ns per loop
sage: %timeit sgn(5)                   
625 loops, best of 3: 3.49 µs per loop
```

Contents of the file `sign_fn.py`:

```
from sage.symbolic.function import BuiltinFunction

class SignFunc(BuiltinFunction):
    def __init__(self):
        BuiltinFunction.__init__(self, "sign")
```

The `_alt_name` code path is still taking up valuable time. It would be better to settle what name we use in the constructor and only try one option. If `alt_name` is set, we use that, otherwise, we use `name`.

There are a couple of doctest failures in `sage/functions` due to precision changes.

It's backwards incompatible because if some objects (defined within or outside of Sage) define sgn() and others define sign(), removing this aliasing would cause one or the other break. 

If we decide to go this route, I think it should be a separate ticket than this performance enhancement.
