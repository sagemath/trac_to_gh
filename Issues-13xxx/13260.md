We've long needed a substantial, graded set of tutorials starting from absolute scratch geared toward new mathematical users of Sage who do not have any particular programming background.  In the PREP workshops the last three years, such a series of tutorials, including eight disciplinary "quickstarts" and an intro to interacts, have taken good shape, and are ready for inclusion.

Apply [attachment:trac_13260-tutorials.patch] and [attachment:trac_13260-images.patch].

The first patch has just the main tutorials, and the second should only have the image files except as noted below.  The quickstarts have been moved to #13381.


Recommended reviewing method is to apply patches, build the documentation, and then look at it.  Then one can refer to the relevant patch in review.

<a id='comment:4'></a>There are quite a lot of empty lines (especially before `::`) are they all necessary?

Remove trailing white spaces and replace the tabs.

The maximum line length should be about 79 characters, at least for the text parts.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Yes, the empty lines are all necessary.  This is not the same as Sage code, it's the documentation.

Unless you mean that one could do 

```
Do this thing::

    sage: do_it()
```

instead of 

```
Do this thing.

::

    sage: do_it()
```

I'm not sure which looks nicer right now in the built doc.

There shouldn't be any trailing whitespace or tabs left.

Line length noted - this was from some other stuff, but you are right about this, of course.

I have had a look at some other `rst` files. There is only one empty line before and one empty line after `::` and not up to 3 empty lines.

Hmm, looks like a more expanded version of some of this stuff in the more detailed topics, and a shorter version of this in the intro versions.

I personally think that either of these sets are more appropriate than the current "tutorial", which dates from the days when the Sage user could be expected to have familiarity with the command line etc.   Feel free to cc: me on some of your things as they become ready for review.

Meanwhile, I'm working on slowly removing the whitespace and justifying... a little tedious since I'm not a power editor user :8

It would be also cool to actually have plots in tutorials on plotting, but I don't know how difficult it is to implement.

Actually, I HAD all of those plots and removed them!  That's what #10637 does - it keeps as many images as possible.  But I got rid of them because they aren't present in any other Sage documentation.

The problem is that there is the "live" documentation as well as the "static" documentation, and putting images in one means that in the other you would get two images when you evaluated it.  I didn't want to try to fight that, though maybe I should have at least *kept* the images!

MANIFEST.in is [documented here](http://docs.python.org/distutils/sourcedist.html#manifest-template). The second line of the file is

```
recursive-include doc *.rst *.py *.inc
```
so all .py and .rst files are included automatically. I'm not sure why we don't do this for png files; I guess that building the documentation without the jsMath option can generate lots of png files that we don't need to include. So anyway, you have to include any png files in there, with a syntax like

```
include doc/en/prep/Quickstarts/Rplot001.png
include doc/en/prep/Quickstarts/heawood-graph-latex.png
recursive-include doc/en/prep/media *
```
probably somewhere near the bottom with the rest of the lines related to the doc directory. (The order doesn't matter, but it's nice if the file is somewhat organized.) You can test it by running `sage --sdist ...` and making sure that the appropriate files are included in the Sage spkg.

The problem was that it should be `HaveSignin.png` - I have fixed this.

Done.  As far as I can tell with my modest grep skillz.  Any very minor remaining ones could be fixed in a reviewer patch, of course.

Patchbot, apply trac_13260-tutorials.patch, trac_13260-quickstarts.patch, and trac_13260-images.patch.

One remaining issues might be that the images showing the worksheets are quite large compared to many browser window sizes.  On the other hand,

Ok, fixed.

This is actually intentional, but I tried to make it clearer - the cell is talking to the reader, for what it's worth.

Great.
>  * Line 623: the command here goes off the edge of my screen. Maybe it should be wrapped manually?
 
Fixed in the way the contour plot docs do it, hopefully this will work.
>  * Line 737-738: bolding the first letter of each word like this doesn't seem to render properly in HTML.
>  * Line 272: "It would be best ..." sentence needs rewording
 
I ended up removing some parentheses as well, since even though it's parenthetical, it just didn't work well.
>  * Line 546: the warning here appears in the HTML docs, but the two blocks below don't, so that's confusing. I don't recall what the skip directive actually does, but in this case it seems to leave the blocks omitted. 
 
The skip directive is only supposed to skip it for testing.  I seem to remember that they did indeed show up in the right place, but otherwise the fix is to just move the examples to the "usual" spot.
>  * Line 338: I think you mean (all) here, not (any). Any can mean "forall" or "there exists" depending on context.
 
I guess this is okay.
>  * Line 460: there is an extra `A` at the end of the sentence.
 
This is supposed to be an A in backticks.  I changed the wording to avoid this.
>  * Line 173: This plot command also goes off the right side of my browser window
 
I tried the same thing as I did above.
>  * Line 373: ditto
 
Wow, that one really is long!
>  * Line 409: typsetting mistake
 
I assume there is no irony intended with the typo in this bullet.  I don't see what the problem is right now, but I'll try to fix it.
>  * Line 524: "multiples" -> "multiple"
 
Thanks, and this was also not properly justified so I fixed that.
>  * Line 592: "finetune" -> "fine-tune"
 
If you say so.
> Other than minor fixes, the into set of prep tutorials looks great. These will be a great addition to the official documentation. 

Wonderful!
> I may not have much more time to look at the quickstart tutorials, but perhaps another reviewer can.

I'll just separate these out for now, then, and create a new ticket for them.  That will be a big enough change in the images patch that it will need another brief review just to make sure I got everything I was supposed to, and might as well check that the other changes did indeed work.

As long as no one minds, although I removed the quickstart stuff from this ticket, I left the (two) images, because I wasn't sure how to hg rm a file from within the middle of a queue.  I seriously doubt this will cause any problems.
