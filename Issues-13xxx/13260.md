We've long needed a substantial, graded set of tutorials starting from absolute scratch geared toward new mathematical users of Sage who do not have any particular programming background.  In the PREP workshops the last three years, such a series of tutorials, including eight disciplinary "quickstarts" and an intro to interacts, have taken good shape, and are ready for inclusion.

Apply [attachment: trac_13260-tutorials.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13260/trac_13260-tutorials.patch.gz) and [attachment: trac_13260-images.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13260/trac_13260-images.patch.gz).

The first patch has just the main tutorials, and the second should only have the image files except as noted below.  The quickstarts have been moved to #13381.


Recommended reviewing method is to apply patches, build the documentation, and then look at it.  Then one can refer to the relevant patch in review.

There are quite a lot of empty lines (especially before `::`) are they all necessary?

Remove trailing white spaces and replace the tabs.

The maximum line length should be about 79 characters, at least for the text parts.


I haven't looked at the content yet. Maybe someone else could do this.

Yes, the empty lines are all necessary.  This is not the same as Sage code, it's the documentation.

Unless you mean that one could do 

```
Do this thing::

    sage: do_it()
```

instead of 

```
Do this thing.

::

    sage: do_it()
```

I'm not sure which looks nicer right now in the built doc.

There shouldn't be any trailing whitespace or tabs left.

Line length noted - this was from some other stuff, but you are right about this, of course.

```
$ grep -P "\t" trac_13260-quickstarts.patch

says that there are three tabs in `quickstart.patch` left

```
+    	Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test
+    ...   plot(x,y)	# make a plot 
+    ...   abline(lm(y ~ x))	# plot the regression line
```

There must be trailing white spaces otherwise patchbot wouldn't complain about them.

I have had a look at some other `rst` files. There is only one empty line before and one empty line after `::` and not up to 3 empty lines.

Oh, great, thanks for finding those!  They are from some stuff I copied from some worksheet of mine from R examples.

I see what you mean by the extra empty lines.  I can eventually fix that too, I thought you were referring to their being any empty lines at all.  The sws2rst script - full props to #10637, where this is done! - adds a lot of extra new lines, because that has no effect on the final output, and it ensures that new lines are placed where they are needed.

I am only slowly looking at patchbot stuff - yikes,

```
ValueError: Trailing whitespace inserted on 153 non-empty lines.
```
and it lists them.  Well, I don't use a real editor per se.  I'll try to fix these.  Thanks for the heads-up!

Hmm, looks like a more expanded version of some of this stuff in the more detailed topics, and a shorter version of this in the intro versions.

I personally think that either of these sets are more appropriate than the current "tutorial", which dates from the days when the Sage user could be expected to have familiarity with the command line etc.   Feel free to cc: me on some of your things as they become ready for review.

It would be also cool to actually have plots in tutorials on plotting, but I don't know how difficult it is to implement.

MANIFEST.in is [documented here](http://docs.python.org/distutils/sourcedist.html#manifest-template). The second line of the file is

```
recursive-include doc *.rst *.py *.inc

Okay, all that is done.  I ended up moving all the images to the media directory for `MANIFEST.in` ease of use.

I still don't know why the tutorials patch doesn't preview correctly.  The manifest changes is in the images patch.

Patchbot, apply trac_13260-tutorials.patch, trac_13260-quickstarts.patch, and trac_13260-images.patch.

One remaining issues might be that the images showing the worksheets are quite large compared to many browser window sizes.  On the other hand, 
* it's a real pain to generate those images, and
* if they are too small, it will be hard to see detail.

More comments welcome.  

Also, I was originally going to add log plots now that #4529 is in, but maybe that should go on another ticket.  It's not like these can't be enhanced in the future :)

This is actually intentional, but I tried to make it clearer - the cell is talking to the reader, for what it's worth.

Great.
> * Line 623: the command here goes off the edge of my screen. Maybe it should be wrapped manually?

Fixed in the way the contour plot docs do it, hopefully this will work.

I ended up removing some parentheses as well, since even though it's parenthetical, it just didn't work well.

The skip directive is only supposed to skip it for testing.  I seem to remember that they did indeed show up in the right place, but otherwise the fix is to just move the examples to the "usual" spot.
> * Line 338: I think you mean (all) here, not (any). Any can mean "forall" or "there exists" depending on context.

I guess this is okay.
> * Line 460: there is an extra `A` at the end of the sentence.

This is supposed to be an A in backticks.  I changed the wording to avoid this.
> * Line 173: This plot command also goes off the right side of my browser window

I tried the same thing as I did above.
> * Line 373: ditto

Wow, that one really is long!
> * Line 409: typsetting mistake

I assume there is no irony intended with the typo in this bullet.  I don't see what the problem is right now, but I'll try to fix it.
> * Line 524: "multiples" -> "multiple"

Thanks, and this was also not properly justified so I fixed that.
> * Line 592: "finetune" -> "fine-tune"

If you say so.
> Other than minor fixes, the into set of prep tutorials looks great. These will be a great addition to the official documentation. 

Wonderful!
> I may not have much more time to look at the quickstart tutorials, but perhaps another reviewer can.

I'll just separate these out for now, then, and create a new ticket for them.  That will be a big enough change in the images patch that it will need another brief review just to make sure I got everything I was supposed to, and might as well check that the other changes did indeed work.

As long as no one minds, although I removed the quickstart stuff from this ticket, I left the (two) images, because I wasn't sure how to hg rm a file from within the middle of a queue.  I seriously doubt this will cause any problems.

familiarity with the topics at the level of a student who has just
