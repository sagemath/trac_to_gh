When doing something like

```
./sage -i atlas &>my_log_file
```
the output to `my_log_file` will be badly ordered because we're not flushing stdout/stderr before calling `system()` in `spkg-install`.

New **spkg**: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/atlas-3.8.4.p2.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/atlas-3.8.4.p2.spkg) (for review, changes not yet committed)

### atlas-3.8.4.p2 (Jeroen Demeyer, 6 July 2012)
* Trac #13210: Flush stdout and stderr before calling system().
* Detect the Apple linker (which is still unsupported).
* Remove unneeded .orig files in patches/
* Remove mmsearch-with-temp-Solaris-fix.c patch (was needed for
  gcc-4.4.0 on Solaris).
* Remove copying of patches/*tgz since there are no such files.
* Use 'patch' for patching.

I don't think "I'm working on a new version of feature X" is ever a good excuse to not fix the old feature X.
