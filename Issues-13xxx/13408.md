Compilation of Sage-5.2 fails with an error inside the atlas-3.8.4 package.
However the latest atlas-3.10.0  version compiles fine. 
I therefore propose that the package be updated to the latest release for the next release of sage.

I have no idea.  The original poster is unresponsive, so it's hard to find out.  Since the problem is fixed by upstream atlas-3.10.0, let's assume #10508 also fixes it.
