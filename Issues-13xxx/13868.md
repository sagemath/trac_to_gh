I tried to uncomment both these lines in integer.pyx and real_double.pyx but this lead to segfaults when starting Sage.

If I prevent the use of the fast tp_*, Sage starts (although I get a TypeError in sage/libs/gen/late_import, I've not recompiled everything after rebuilding Python)

So this will need more work.

I am a bit puzzled. Why is this only done when the debug preprocessor macro is used? Do you claim that this is a bug *only* in debug mode? Why could it not create trouble without debug mode?
