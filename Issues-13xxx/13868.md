I tried to uncomment both these lines in integer.pyx and real_double.pyx but this lead to segfaults when starting Sage.

If I prevent the use of the fast tp_*, Sage starts (although I get a TypeError in sage/libs/gen/late_import, I've not recompiled everything after rebuilding Python)

So this will need more work.

I am a bit puzzled. Why is this only done when the debug preprocessor macro is used? Do you claim that this is a bug *only* in debug mode? Why could it not create trouble without debug mode?

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A15):
> It would be nice if we could review and merge this ticket as it is the cause for the segfault during Sage "make" with `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`


Is this still the case? With all the new spkgs mentioned in the ticket description of #13864 (in particular, with cython-0.17.4), sage builds and starts fine on bsd.math, with SAGE_DEBUG=yes. Or has that only been a problem on other systems?
