Currently, the Sage signal handling code does not handle stack overflows gracefully.  Fix this using `sigaltstack()`.

In fact, change the whole design of the signal handling to use GNU Portable Threads which is quite natural once you see it.  It immediately also gives a much better solution to #12873.
