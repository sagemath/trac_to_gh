```
sage: c = CartanType([["A",2]])
sage: c.is_irreducible()      
False
```

As a consequence, e.g. the cartan_matrix() method fails too.

**Updated:**

Patch submitted. Now:

```
sage: c = CartanType([["A",2]])
sage: c.is_irreducible()
True
sage: c = CartanType(["A2"])
sage: c.is_irreducible()
True
```

You should add doctests showing that the behavior is now correct, probably with a reference to this ticket:

```
Fixed in :trac:`13774`::

    sage: c = CartanType([["A",2]])
    sage: c.is_irreducible()
    True
    sage: c = CartanType(["A2"])
    sage: c.is_irreducible()
    True
```
I don't have any comments about the mathematical correctness of the fix here; I hope someone else will address that.
