```
The NTL wrapper for `SquareFreeDecomp` gets the sign wrong for some FLINT polynomials:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, implementation='FLINT')
sage: f=-x^2
sage: f.squarefree_decomposition()
(-x)^2
```

It works correctly for NTL:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, implementation='NTL')
sage: f=-x^2
sage: f.squarefree_decomposition()
(-1) * x^2
```

<a id='comment:2'></a>The problem is that the FLINT/NTL return a different content:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,implementation="FLINT")
sage: (-x).content()
1
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,implementation="NTL")
sage: (-x).content()
-1
```

If the content should just be a generator of the ideal generated by the coefficients, then both are correct. Personally, I think that NTL's behaviour is more intuitive though.

If not, is there some easy way to get the leading coefficient's sign in FLINT?

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Content.html

"(1) The content of an integer polynomial P in Z[x], denoted  cont(P), is the largest integer k>=1 such that  P/k also has integer coefficients. (2) Gauss's lemma for contents states that if P and Q are two polynomials with integer coefficients, then cont(PQ)=cont(P)cont(Q) (SÃ©roul 2000, p. 287)."

Note that while the Mathematica output violates (1) it still satisfies (2).
