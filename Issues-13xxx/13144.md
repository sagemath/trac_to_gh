For the current FreeBSD [port](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/math/sage/), the following patch is necessary.  See [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-devel/CJPzhaaNmGI) where it was first reported.

Presumably we would want to only apply this on FreeBSD for now.  Needs an spkg.

It is a duplicate of

I think this patch should be applied to all operating systems.  I think it is just a matter of luck that other operating systems were not hit by this bug.
