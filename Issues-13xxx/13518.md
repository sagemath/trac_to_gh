The GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK) provides functions to which SAGE currently does not provide access. These include:

* Sensitivity analysis

The following enhancements might be helpful:

* Access to glp_print_ranges to store results of a sensitivity analysis in a file
* Access to GLPK function for getting shadow prices and reduced costs

Helloooooooooo Christian !

Well, I asked a friend of mine about the message I sent yesterday -- as I customarily get angry over trivial things -- and it looks like it was one of these times again... Sage is one of the few things people still work on for pleasure and not for money or anything, and these things are really hard to find right now, so... `^^;`

About your patch : it is very large, and because it is one your first there are many things to fix (trivial things that Sage developpers agreed were necessary in a patch), and because your patch is so long... It shows. But we'll fix that ! `:-)`

There are actually two important things to keep in mind :
* All the examples that are given in Sage's source code (inside of each function) are used both by users when they wonder how the method should be used, but also to automatically test sage. Before it is release, we run "sage -t " on every file, and all tests have to pass. And no patch is accepted whose "doctests" fail to pass. And of course a command like p.write_ccdata("/home/chris/graph.dat") is only valid on your computer. There's no /home/chris/ directory on mine ! Hence 

```
sage -b && sage -t glpk_backend.pyx
```
    would not pass tests on my computer.  And all files should pass tests.
* The documentation that you write in each function is useful in this text version, but it is also (badly) compiled to a html doc. That's how : 

```
sage -b && sage -docbuild reference html
```
    And of course the documentation should also be nicely displayed in this html files. Sometimes one forgets to use `::` instead of `:`, and the documentation misses something 

Once more, do you consider your file needing a review or not yet ? It's not a big decision to take : I just wonder whether I should spend the time necessary to read, understand and make comments on your patch right now, or whether you still work on the file at the moment. Actually, it would be nice if you could try to fix those two things : documentation and doctests, upate your patch, and then we'll begin the review.

Have fuuuuuuuun ! And thank you for your patch `:-)`

Helloooooooo Christian ! 

Thank you for this updated patch !

Well, there is not much to say at this level...

* There's a double '-' before your name at the beginning of the file
* Thank you for the lp->mps fix.. Could you also change the filename, which currently ends with .lp ?
* It feels a bit weird to have a print_* method that does not print anything but writes the output to a file. Of course that's how the GLPK function is named, so it makes sense... What would you think of modifying it just a bit so that it can also "PRINT" the information that is being written to a file ? Something like, by default, write the information to a file and print it, unless the user explicitely wants the information to be written to a file, not displayed ? I can do that in another patch if you like the idea and don't want to spend time on it.
* What about just having ``get_row_dual`` and not ``get_constraint_shadow_price``, which is just an alias to it anyway ? Besides, get_row_dual is how the GLPK function is named, and this method's docstring can mention what a shadow price is at the same time ? And the same goes for cols.

Hello Nathann,

thanks for your comments.

> ...there is an occurrence of "algorthm" somewhere in the patch, 

I searched all over the place and could'nt find that typo :-(. I did find an "algorithn" in one place and replaced that. (I fear I am not a good proof reader ;-))

> and one line in the docstring of get_col_dual is very long too. 

Changed that.

> Shot of that, I thought that the behaviour of the ``print_ranges`` method would be to display the table if no file argument is given, and to write it to the file (without displaying it) otherwise.
> 

You're right, you suggestion is better due to the wide output of the analysis report and it gives more flexibility for applications. Implemented your approach.

Thanks a lot for your help.
