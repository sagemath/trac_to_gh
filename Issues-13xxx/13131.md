As the summary says.

See [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-devel/5Ex0erSNyKg) for more suggestions, including that we should have a `Table` class that `table` calls, which uses something like `html.table` in the notebook, but also has a `_latex_` method, makes ascii art in the command line, etc.

Just a few examples from the doctests in the patch:

```
        sage: table([['a', 'b', 'c'], [100,2,3], [4,5,60]])
          a     b   c
          100   2   3
          4     5   60
        sage: table([['a', 'b', 'c'], [100,2,3], [4,5,60]], frame=True)
        +-----+---+----+
        | a   | b | c  |
        +-----+---+----+
        | 100 | 2 | 3  |
        +-----+---+----+
        | 4   | 5 | 60 |
        +-----+---+----+

        sage: latex(table([['a', 'b', 'c'], [100,2,3], [4,5,60]], frame=True))
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
        a & b & c \\ \hline
        $100$ & $2$ & $3$ \\ \hline
        $4$ & $5$ & $60$ \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
```
You can also specify alignments of 'left', 'center', or 'right'.

Some random comments and questions:

- When defining a table, the user should be able to specify position/alignment (left, right, center). Should they be able to do this for each column, and do we like LaTeX notation for this? Should they be able to specify positioning for each individual entry? 

- Is it too much work to try to align numbers at their decimal places? [LaTeX](http://ryanmlayer.wordpress.com/2009/10/05/aligning-on-decimal-points-an-example-of-the-specifier/) and [LaTeX](http://www.volkerschatz.com/tex/halign.html) ways to do this. [html](http://krijnhoetmer.nl/stuff/javascript/table-align-char/) and [html](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1363239/aligning-decimal-points-in-html) ways to do this, but perhaps complicated or messy.

- Should we refactor the matrix printing code so that it uses this class?

- `html.table` expects a nested list as input, and so the entries in [1,2,3] get plotted as separate rows. is that the right thing, or should [1,2,3] get plotted as a single row?

- We should probably steal code from html.table, matrix._repr_, matrix.str, matrix._latex_

- Should we allow subtables (like subdivisions in matrices)?

To get `header_column` to have any effect in HTML, we also will need to patch the Sage notebook, to modify the file `devel/sagenb/sagenb/data/sage/css/main.css`:

I think that

```
table([head] + data, header_row=True)
```
is just about as clear as

```
table(data, header_row=head)
```
especially since `head` comes first in the first version, consistent with its position in the table. But here's a new patch which implements both, and the same for `header_column`.

Some dumb questions.

If you formatted your table as two rows, then I think html.table should (but probably doesn't) format different-sized rows.

Technically speaking, I think you're right. I don't like the old behavior at all; it doesn't make sense to me. It might actually make sense to just raise an error if you pass a single list, not a nested list. I'm not sure what the right thing to do is.

Yes, you're right.

>  * I don't see any error catching.  This is particularly important in making sure someone doesn't (contra the doc, but still) try to add in a header row later on via `header_row=[1,2,3]` 


So you're suggesting that

```
sage: T = table([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
sage: T.options(header_row=['x', 'y', 'z'])
```
should raise an error instead of just silently making `[1,2,3]` the header? Okay, I guess that makes sense.

> and in making sure that the table is, in fact, a rectangle.  I think that for sanity, especially with very large tables, this would be helpful to have this error instead of who-knows-what-crazy-error Sage would raise otherwise.

I'm not sure how these last two items relate to each other: the last one sounds like you want to be able to pass lists of different lengths and have the gaps filled in, and the previous one sounds like you want to raise an error if you pass lists of different lengths. But maybe I don't understand.

Would it be useful to have a `transpose` method to switch rows and columns? Here's a new patch which adds that, and also addresses all of the issues except the old behavior of `html.table()` and the last issue about a non-rectangular situation.

Thanks for clarifying the documentation of `html(_)` and for making `html` calling `_html_` if it exists.

I have two questions:

1. Doc of `html` now says:

    {{{
    In any case, *print* the resulting html string. This method 
    always *returns* an empty string. 
    }}}

What if I want to print the output in a file and not in the shell. What should I do? This is something I came across in the past.

2. I really like the `table` function. I am defining such a function in a patch I posted just yesterday at #13069. In my case, the function takes columns as input and not rows. So, if I want to use your code, would you propose an interface that takes columns as input:

    {{{
    #!python
    sage: columns = [('a', 100, 4), ('b', 2, 5), ('c', 3, 60)] 
    sage: table(columns=columns)
    }}}

or the user should transpose columns into rows himself?

    {{{
    #!python
    sage: columns = [('a', 100, 4), ('b', 2, 5), ('c', 3, 60)] 
    sage: rows = zip(*columns)
    sage: rows
    [('a', 'b', 'c'), (100, 2, 3), (4, 5, 60)]
    sage: table(rows)
    }}}

> 2. I really like the `table` function. I am defining such a function in a patch I posted just yesterday at #13069.


To make the reference easier, here is the function I coded at #13069 (the patch is 90 Kb).

```python
def table_from_columns(col1, col2, space=3):
    r"""
    Return a string of a table of two columns.

    This is used by the ``_repr_`` method of DoubleSquare class.

    INPUT:

    - ``col1`` - list
    - ``col2`` - list
    - ``space`` - integer (default ``3``), number of space characters
      between

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.combinat.double_square_tile import table_from_columns
        sage: col1 = ['ab','asdfasdf', 'adf']
        sage: col2 = ['11', '1313', '131313', '1313']
        sage: print table_from_columns(col1, col2)
        ab         11
        asdfasdf   1313
        adf        131313
                   1313
    """
    from itertools import izip_longest
    width_col1 = max(map(len, col1))
    it = izip_longest(col1,col2, fillvalue='')
    L = [a.ljust(width_col1 + space) + b for (a,b) in it]
    return '\n'.join(L)
```

This is just documentation; I haven't changed the code. If we want to change the behavior of `html` (maybe just adding a `str` method or something like that), let's do it on another ticket and keep this one focused on tables.

The easiest thing to do with the code as it stands is `table(columns).transpose()`.

I agree. I just can't close my mouth sometimes!

> I can add this, but what should happen if you do `table(array, column=columns)`? Raise an error? Or try to combine the two sets of data somehow? I think I prefer to raise an error.


or maybe the interface could be :

```
sage: table(data=rows)
...
sage: table(data=columns, orientation='columns')
...
```

where orientation would be an optional argument taking `'rows'` as default value? This way there can't be inconsistent inputs.

> The easiest thing to do with the code as it stands is `table(columns).transpose()`.
