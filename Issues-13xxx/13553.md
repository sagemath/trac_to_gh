The `Bessel` class defined its own plot method which is called e.g. when you run

```
sage: plot(Bessel(0,'J'), 0, 10)
```

but it doesn't pass along extra keyword parameters to the top-level plot function:

```
sage: plot(Bessel(0,'J'),0,10,color='red')
TypeError: plot() got an unexpected keyword argument 'rgbcolor'
```
