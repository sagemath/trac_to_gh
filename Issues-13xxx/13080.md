Attachment [trac_16873_gal_reps_number_field-revised.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket13080/trac_16873_gal_reps_number_field-revised.patch) by @elarson314 created at 2013-05-23 23:06:36

Fixed. The PDF and HTML documentation build now.

I've also fixed the typos in the comments pointed out by Tony in his review.
