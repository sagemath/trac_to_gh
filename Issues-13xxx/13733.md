See [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1995/mistake-in-a-indefinite-integral).

```
sage: integral(log(cot(x)-1),x,0,pi/4)

ValueError: Integral is divergent.
```
But according to the poster it is pi log(2) / 8.  And indeed in the most recent Maxima (5.28) we have

```
(%i5) display2d:false;

(%o5) false
(%i6) integrate(log(cot(x)-1),x,0,%pi/4);

Is %pi/8 an ?integer?

n;
Is %pi/4 an ?integer?

n;
Is 2*%pi an ?integer?

n;
(%o6) -(%i*(2*li[2](%i+1)-2*li[2](1-%i))+%pi*log(2))/4
 +%i*li[2]((%i+1)/2)/2-%i*li[2](-(%i-1)/2)/2
```
though with the interaction this is not an improvement we can immediately use.

According to [the upstream report](http://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2501/), that problem is also fixed [here](http://maxima.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=maxima/maxima;a=blobdiff;f=src/compar.lisp;h=15761dc5a29a6234f50181200821b84e28df40a4;hp=e9b2ec39d06886744a13901a65925d61dae18191;hb=1780660150446a1efe4ad149f0d23da6fdddd21f;hpb=8ad7e4288e11a9b1bbac31c811f91bf69f76b42f) and there is also a commit of the integral in question as a test.

```
expand(integrate(log(cot(x)-1),x,0,%pi/4));
-%i*li[2](%i+1)/2+%i*li[2](%i/2+1/2)/2-%i*li[2](1/2-%i/2)/2+%i*li[2](1-%i)/2-%pi*log(2)/4$
```
So I guess when the next Maxima after 5.29.1 is ready and we put it in, we can try to close this report with a doctest.

Maybe but Sage+Maxima-5.35 without `abs_integrate` gives `-1/4*pi*log(2) - 1/2*I*polylog(2, I + 1) + 1/2*I*polylog(2, -I + 1) + 1/2*I*polylog(2, 1/2*I + 1/2) - 1/2*I*polylog(2, -1/2*I + 1/2)` so this is not resolved either way.

-1/4*pi*log(2) - 1/2*I*dilog(I + 1) + 1/2*I*dilog(-I + 1) + 1/2*I*dilog(1/2*I + 1/2) - 1/2*I*dilog(-1/2*I + 1/2)
