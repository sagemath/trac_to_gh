The main change of this patch is to improve the `is_triangle_free' method. The introduced algorithm uses the fact that given that A is the adjacency matrix of a simple graph G, then the number of triangles in G is tr(A^3)/6. 

The change has been tested resulting in the following benchmarks:

1. Testing all graphs of order up to 10 for triangles: (old: 201m44.339s, new: **87m38.146s**)
2. Testing all triangle-free graphs of order 12 for triangles: (old: 15m56.679s, new **9m41.116s**)
3. Testing all graphs of order up to 10 that do contain triangles: (old:  0m10.305s, new : **0m5.798s**)

I can provide the test programs if needed.

Since there are many applications in which one needs to count the number of triangles in a graph the named routine was also added.

Finally a minor change has been made to the generic_graph function spanning_trees_count() which calls abs on a determinant that is always positive.

Therefore, a better solution could be an hybrid method using matrix multiplication if the graph is very small, and basic iterations otherwise.\n\n---\n\nFor counting triangles, the situation is rather different and the density of the graph matters. Furthermore, it is interesting to use networkx graphs:\n\n```\ndef my_triangles_count(G):\n    tr = 0\n    for u in G.vertex_iterator():\n        tr += sum(G.has_edge(v,w) for v,w in combinations_iterator(G.neighbors(u),2))\n    return tr/3\n\ndef my_triangles_countnx(G):\n    tr = 0\n    ggnx = G.networkx_graph()\n    for u in ggnx.nodes_iter():\n        tr += sum(ggnx.has_edge(v,w) for v,w in combinations_iterator(ggnx.neighbors(u),2))\n    return tr/3\n```\n\nWe get the following running time:\n\n```\nsage: G = graphs.GridGraph([5,2])\nsage: %timeit G.triangles_count()\n625 loops, best of 3: 608 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: %timeit my_triangles_count(G)\n625 loops, best of 3: 444 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: %timeit my_triangles_countnx(G)\n625 loops, best of 3: 353 \u00b5s per loop\nsage:\nsage: G = graphs.GridGraph([10,5])\nsage: %timeit G.triangles_count()\n25 loops, best of 3: 9.44 ms per loop\nsage: %timeit my_triangles_count(G)\n125 loops, best of 3: 2.98 ms per loop\nsage: %timeit my_triangles_countnx(G)\n125 loops, best of 3: 1.99 ms per loop\nsage:\nsage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(10,.1)\nsage: %timeit G.triangles_count()\n625 loops, best of 3: 493 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: %timeit my_triangles_count(G)\n625 loops, best of 3: 217 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: %timeit my_triangles_countnx(G)\n625 loops, best of 3: 218 \u00b5s per loop\nsage:\nsage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(50,.1)\nsage: %timeit G.triangles_count()\n25 loops, best of 3: 9.79 ms per loop\nsage: %timeit my_triangles_count(G)\n125 loops, best of 3: 5.49 ms per loop\nsage: %timeit my_triangles_countnx(G)\n125 loops, best of 3: 2.78 ms per loop\nsage:\nsage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(50,.5)\nsage: %timeit G.triangles_count()\n25 loops, best of 3: 15 ms per loop\nsage: %timeit my_triangles_count(G)\n5 loops, best of 3: 82.4 ms per loop\nsage: %timeit my_triangles_countnx(G)\n25 loops, best of 3: 23.4 ms per loop\nsage:\nsage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(100,.5)\nsage: %timeit G.triangles_count()\n5 loops, best of 3: 58.4 ms per loop\nsage: %timeit my_triangles_count(G)\n5 loops, best of 3: 716 ms per loop\nsage: %timeit my_triangles_countnx(G)\n5 loops, best of 3: 181 ms per loop\nsage:\nsage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(100,.1)\nsage: %timeit G.triangles_count()\n25 loops, best of 3: 35.4 ms per loop\nsage: %timeit my_triangles_count(G)\n25 loops, best of 3: 33.6 ms per loop\nsage: %timeit my_triangles_countnx(G)\n25 loops, best of 3: 12.8 ms per loop\nsage:\nsage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(100,.05)\nsage: %timeit G.triangles_count()\n25 loops, best of 3: 32.3 ms per loop\nsage: %timeit my_triangles_count(G)\n25 loops, best of 3: 10.8 ms per loop\nsage: %timeit my_triangles_countnx(G)\n125 loops, best of 3: 5.53 ms per loop\n```\n\nAs you can see, when the graph is dense, the matrix multiplication method is the fastest, but for spare graphs it is better to use iterations and to convert the graph into a networkx graph. However, I don't know how to choose the threshold and I don't have better proposals in mind yet.",

Hello,

I added Nathann in Cc because we had a discussion about counting triangles last week ;)

The proposed method for testing if the graph is triangle free is not a good one. Indeed, the time complexity for testing if the graph is triangle free is at most N^w, where 2 <= w < 3 is the best possible exponent for  computing the square of a matrix of side N. You compute the square of the adjacency matrix to get all paths of length 2, and then you test for every edge (u,v) if there is a path of length 2 from u to v. Furthermore, the basic algorithm of testing if some neighbors of a vertex are incident is fast.

Let us compare the following method with your proposition for testing if the graph is triangle free.

```
def my_is_triangle_free(G):
    for u in G.vertex_iterator():
        if any(G.has_edge(v,w) for v,w in combinations_iterator(G.neighbors(u),2)):
            return False
    #
    return True
```

We get the following running times:

```

For very small graphs it is apparently faster to do `(M^3).trace() > 0`, but for large graphs, basic iterations are way faster because we stop computations as soon as a triangle is found (if any). Therefore, a better solution could be an hybrid method using matrix multiplication if the graph is very small, and basic iterations otherwise.

---

For counting triangles, the situation is rather different and the density of the graph matters. Furthermore, it is interesting to use networkx graphs:

```
def my_triangles_count(G):
    tr = 0
    for u in G.vertex_iterator():
        tr += sum(G.has_edge(v,w) for v,w in combinations_iterator(G.neighbors(u),2))
    return tr/3

def my_triangles_countnx(G):
    tr = 0
    ggnx = G.networkx_graph()
    for u in ggnx.nodes_iter():
        tr += sum(ggnx.has_edge(v,w) for v,w in combinations_iterator(ggnx.neighbors(u),2))
    return tr/3
```

We get the following running time:

```

As you can see, when the graph is dense, the matrix multiplication method is the fastest, but for spare graphs it is better to use iterations and to convert the graph into a networkx graph. However, I don't know how to choose the threshold and I don't have better proposals in mind yet.

Hello,

I agree with what you said. 

As you mentioned it is hard to deduce a threshold that is going to be good for all platforms (and times) so I suppose we could simply add an optional argument for the user to specify which algorithm to use. We could then also add the even faster triangle detection algorithms based on probability.

`RR = RealField(53)` is arbitrary precision reals, so perhaps predictably slow, given the generality.

`RDF` (real double field) is floating point doubles.  Whatever the 53-bit precision IEEE format is.  Try adjacency matrices over that ring.  They might be an improvement.

If the graph is dense, the first visited vertex will have a triangle with high probability. So after a very small number of iterations and so operations, the algorithm returns False. But with matrix multiplications, you have to pay the full cost whatever the result.

Of course, if the graph is dense and triangle free (not so many such graphs), my algorithm will take long time, and possibly more than matrix multiplications, but in average it is faster. Do your own experiments to convince yourself.

So for testing if G is triangle free, it is good to have a parameter to choose the algorithm, and a default behavior like: if G has less than 15 nodes, then do matrix multiplications, else use other algo.

For counting triangles, the situation is different and we clearly have to take into account the density to choose the best algorithm.

I'd guess that managing (potentially) large integers has more overhead than managing doubles:

```

sage: M = G.am()
sage: timeit("M*M*M")

0.0
```

I can't recall seeing a Sage class for integers of a bounded size.

I'm certainly not used to matrix multiplications and rings in sage, and I'm surprised that computing with doubles is faster than with integer. For instance, if G has `10^6` vertices, then since M is a matrix of 0 and 1's, the largest value in `M^3` is in `10^18 < 2^63` and so all computations are doable using 64bits integers.

Following your example, and after some search, I found a much faster solution: use GF(2)

```
sage: G = graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(100,100); M = G.am(); M
200 x 200 dense matrix over Integer Ring (type 'print M.str()' to see all of the entries)
sage: %timeit not (M*M*M).trace()
5 loops, best of 3: 39.5 ms per loop
sage: MR = M.change_ring(RDF); MR
200 x 200 dense matrix over Real Double Field (type 'print MR.str()' to see all of the entries)
sage: %timeit (MR*MR*MR).trace() == 0.0
125 loops, best of 3: 1.47 ms per loop
sage: M2 = M.change_ring(GF(2)); M2
200 x 200 dense matrix over Finite Field of size 2 (type 'print M2.str()' to see all of the entries)
sage: %timeit not (M2*M2*M2).trace()
625 loops, best of 3: 201 µs per loop
```


However, this is not always the best solution and it is extremely slow for sparse matrix O_o

```
sage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(1000,.1); M = G.am(); M2 = M.change_ring(GF(2)); M2

I don't know how to force a matrix to be dense. for "small" graphs, it is apparently always dense. 

Clearly, the algorithm should use tradeoffs between size and density.

`mat.dense_matrix()` should do it.

That's a pity :(

Any interesting alternatives?

"dense" in Sage is an implementation detail.  Any matrix can be made dense or sparse, even if it is not a good idea for the algorithm at hand.

In the discussion here, the actual "density" of the adjacency matrix is relevant for which approach (matrix algebra, vertex neighborhoods) might be faster.

I like the looks of `my_is_triangle_free_bitset`.  

It is too bad more of these bit-by-bit type operations are not more easily available for graphs.  I know the folks working on the matroid classes are implementing a lot of duplicate functionality to be faster in tese sorts of situations (like matrix operations).

Hellooooooooo David !!

First, you do not know how glad I am to hear things like "the difficulty with graph algorithms is that the efficiency depends on the data structure" from the mouth of researchers. "Adjacency test ? O(1) !" is their usual answer. `:-D`

I have been thinking of reimplementing another version using FastGraph, but that would be more trouble than necessary for the moment. And I could actually use the same technique to reimplement SubgraphSearch a bit better anyway, so I guess I will go there directly.

About the patch :

* Where did you find that this "abs" was not needed ? I thought it was `O_o`
* I'm not a big fan of having triangle_count in generic_graph, as I don't really see it used with DiGraphs... And the code reflects that indeed, but if you think they can, then why not ? Could you at least say that not all algorithms are available for Digraphs, and that the method looks for "directed C3" in this case, or something similar ? And in particular not C3 in the underlying graph.
* "tests if the trace of the adjacency matrix is positive" would be counting the number of loops `:-D` Btw I guess it would be better to have "``return (A * * 3 ).trace() == 0``" instead of "``return (A*A*A).trace() == 0``", just in case they might implement some smart thing for powers of binary matrices eventually... The logarithmic power method changes nothing for `k=3` `:-)`

Thanks for that patch !!

It was in the original patch  from Jernej Azarija ([trac_17334_triangle_free_speedup.patch]). I don't know if its true or not, and since the gain is very limited, we could put it back to be on the safe side.

Jernej should answer that remark.

OK.

I have implemented some of the modifications.

> Thanks for that patch !!

I was also thinking of some nice and fast methods from Alon et al., or from Latapy (see the code in c and the survey at [http://www-rp.lip6.fr/~latapy/Triangles/](http://www-rp.lip6.fr/~latapy/Triangles/)). We could add them (in particular the compact-forward method) at the cost of adding an interface and a method for converting the graph into the tricky data structure used by Latapy.

abs is not needed. Perhaps we can still remove it from this patch and I add it later in a generic patch fixing various small details in graph.py. The reason it is not needed is that Kirchhoff matrix tree theorem states that the number of spanning trees equals 

det(L')*(-1)^(i+j}+) 

where L' is the matrix that is obtained from the Laplacian after removing row i and column j.

Haven't looked at the site yet, but is it hard to implement the algorithm directly into sage?

yes, it is better to remove the abs in a patch dedicated to small details ;-)

It's difficult in python. The method is fast because it uses optimized data structure. It can be done in cython, but then it is certainly better to only implement the interfaces with the original c code of Latapy. We can easily obtained agreement from him for integrating is code in sage.
This should be done in a dedicated patch to ease reviewing process.

<a id='comment:32'></a>
Oh, didn't know I can do that too. Here we go...

I have tested the code briefly and it looks good to me as far as correction goes. I have two additional remarks though.

1. Can we avoid using graphx? Why exactly are we using it? I know its because of performance but what exactly is making the algorithm tick that faster? It doesn’t seem the right thing (to me) to call a graphx object for this purpose but rather see where the problem in Sage is. Its weird that its that faster even when you take the wrapping overhead into account.

2. The code in is_triangle_free currently looks as follows

```
            BB = {} 
            for u in self.vertex_iterator():
                BB[u] = Bitset(capacity=N)
                for v in self.vertex_iterator():
                    if B[u]&B[v]:
                        BB[u].add(map[v])

            # search for triangles
            return not any(B[u]&BB[u] for u in self.vertex_iterator())
```

Am I missing something or this should be equivalent (to the slightly more optimal):

```
            BB = {} 
            for u in self.vertex_iterator():
                BB[u] = Bitset(capacity=N)
                for v in self.vertex_iterator():
                    if B[u]&B[v]:
                        BB[u].add(map[v])
                if B[u] & BB[u] == 1:
                   return False

            return True
```
