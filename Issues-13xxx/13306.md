This patch implements generators for multi-dimensional chessboard graphs: Queen, King, Knight, Bishop, and Rook graphs. Variations of these graphs can be constructed changing the radius of the ball in which a chess piece can move.

These graphs are useful for testing graph coloring algorithms, hamiltonian cycles, etc.

In addition, this patch creates directory `sage/graphs/generators/` to store new generators. The new functions of this patch are located in file `sage/graphs/generators/chessboard.py`. The functions are then included inside the `GraphGenerators` class and so accessible like `graphs.QueenGraph(...)`.

Two comments:

1) What about supporting d-dimensional chess boards?
i.e. G = graphs.QueenGraph(2, 2, 2) 
or G = graphs.QueenGraph(5,6,7,8,9) 

2) Your input checks require n to be of type Integer. This excludes python ints and other things considered an integer. What about: "if n not in ZZ:"?

Why not, but what would be the definition of valid movements?
- It is obvious for rook's (clique on each dimension). 
- For a knight, it will still be +1 in one dimension and +2 in another dimension. So it should be ok
- For a king it is already more difficult to define legal and illegal movements.
- Same for the queen: what is legal and illegal?

Yes, that's much better.

Thanks,

I'd think in directions. There are two types. The first type is defined by the nearest neighbours in the d-dimensional lattice, i.e. those points that change one coordinate by one.
The second type is defined by the second nearest heighbours, i.e. those points that change the coordinate in two different dimensions by one each.

The allowed directions then are:

King: 1 + 2 \\
Rook: 1 \\
Bishop: 2 \\
Queen: 1 + 2 \\

Your definition for the knight makes sense.

Excellent idea to organize it that way!

Some coding comments though.

```
try: 
 	8297	            if isinstance(dim_list,dict): 
 	8298	                dim = [dim_list[a] for a in dim_list] 
 	8299	            else: 
 	8300	                dim = [a for a in dim_list] 
 	8301	            nb_dim = len(dim) 
 	8302	        except: 
 	8303	            raise ValueError('The first parameter must be an iterable object.') 
```

1) if dim is a dict the keys aren't ordered. This means dim = {1: 2, 2: 3} might end up as dim = [3, 2] instead of [2,3]. Suggestion: dim = [dim_list[a] for a in sorted(dim_list)] 

2) "dim = [a for a in dim_list]" can be replaced with "dim = list(dim_list)"

3) Never use except statements without an exception type to be catched. The reason is that this also catches things like SystemExit, which is raised by CTRL+C. Suggestion: "except TypeError:"

```
dimstr = '' 
 	8307	        for a in dim: 
 	8308	            if not a in ZZ or a < 1: 
 	8309	                raise ValueError('The dimensions must be positive integers larger than 1.') 
 	8310	            if dimstr == '': 
 	8311	                dimstr = '('+str(a) 
 	8312	            else: 
 	8313	                dimstr += ','+str(a) 
 	8314	        dimstr += ')' 
```
4) This could be split into:

```
if any(a not in ZZ or a < 1 for a in dim):
    raise ValueError('The dimensions must be positive integers larger than 1.')
dimstr = '(%s)' % "".join(dim)
```

5) In the code flowing code, there are checks like "rook_radius < 1 or not rook_radius in ZZ:". These could be reversed, i.e. "not rook_radius in ZZ or rook_radius < 1". The reason is that the comparison might raise an exception if it doesn't make sense.\\
6)

```
        8331	        v = [0 for a in dim]
 	8332	        V = [v] 
```

```
 	8332	        V = [ [0]*nb_dim ] 
```
7) In the code below, there are some instances of "u = [x for x in v]". These should be replaced by "u = v[:]". \\
8)

```
8343	        combin = combinations([i for i in xrange(nb_dim)],2) 
```

```
8343	        combin = combinations(range(nb_dim),2) 
```
I hope I don't discourage you with my nitpicking. Most the comments concern only style and efficiency, the only show stopper is 3).

```
sage: dim = [2,3,4,5]
sage: dimstr = '(%s)' % "".join(dim)

Instead, I use the following code which is in fact easier:

I disagree. The correct result is 18.
- 26 is not multiple of 3. so you could have expected 24
- Although we have 8 neighbors per pairs of dimensions, the sum is not 24 but 18 since you must remove redundancy. 
  - in x,y you have 8 neighbors
  - in x,z you also have 8 neighbors, but 2 of them were found with x,y => 6 more
  - in y,z you have 8 neighbors, but 2 were already in x,y and 2 in x,z => 4 more
  - 8+6+4 = 18

`26 = 3**3-1` \\
In general I would expect `3**d -1` directions. They are defined by the `3^d` points in ` {-1,0,1}^d `. Only the central point doesn't define a direction.

You're right that's what I said, but not what I meant. Sorry.

> 
> > In general I would expect `3**d -1` directions. They are defined by the `3^d` points in `{-1,0,1}^d`. Only the central point doesn't define a direction. 

> I don't understand.

A point in the d-dimensional lattice has d integer coordinates, say x_i (i=1..d). 
All points with x_i restricted to the set {-1,0,1} (for all i), lie in a hypercube. \\
This hypercube:\\
* is centered at the origin \\
* has all edges parralel to the coordinate axes \\
* has only edges of lenght 2 \\
* contains exactly `3^d` lattice points \\

Now define a valid direction as the vector from the origin (0,0,...,0) to any other of the `3^d-1` points. \\

And here is the fun question: Which definition makes more sense?\\
I'd propse the following: If you don't feel like putting more work into this, we'll leave it as is. If you're willing to work on it: What about adding a parameter, say 'higher_diagonals' that switches between the two definitions?

After that add an import like "import sage.graphs.generators.chessboard" to graph_generators.py.

I don't know.

Following Jeroen's suggestion, I have created a new directory to store graph generators instead of continuously increasing the size of sage.graphs.graph_generators.py. Later, we could split the graph_generators file and create smaller files, easier to read, faster to test, etc. in the generators directory.

Now, the question is how to make these functions accessible from graphs (e.g., graphs.QueenGraph()) without importing the file at startup. Is there a way to import them the first time they are used? or any other interesting trick I'm not aware of?

Helloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo !!

Well, that patch was muuuuuuch cleaner than I feared, given its size `:-)`

Here is a list of comments, and a small innocent reviewer's patch.

* Default values : rook = True, bishop = True, knight = False : that's weird. Why not set them all to True or all to False ?
* dim_list : it takes any iterable as an input, and you say that it takes sets or even dicts ! That's asking for trouble because the order in which the elements are listed in sets and dicts is platform-dependent, but then you specifically SORT the elements by key value when the inout is a dict, and take the VALUES into account. That's not what it is expected. A dict is an iterable, but list(my_dict) lists its keys, not values ! It would make more sense to remove the part of the code that deals with dict (why especially dicts, by the way ? One can make custom iterables !), and just use your ``dim = list(dim_list)`` which is perfect as it is.
* I replaced "at least" or "least" by ">=". This way you know whether ">=" or ">" is intended, which is never clear with "at least" :-P
* Replaced a block of code by itertools.product
* Added many "`" for tuples that could appear in LaTeX instead.

I thought I did. And none of the patch I had applied before changed chessboard.py. Well, I saw the errors when applying the patches and rebased it. Weird, but done.

Just set them all to ``True``
