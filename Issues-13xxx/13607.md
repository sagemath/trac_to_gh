The problem can be illustrated more simply:

```
sage: q = 25
sage: K.<d> = GF(q)
sage: F.<a> = GF(q^6)
sage: K(a)
d
```
This is, of course, nonsense.
      
The offending code is at lines 482--494 of `sage-5.3/devel/sage-main/sage/rings/finite_rings/element_givaro.pyx`.

As it says at lines 291--292 of `sage-5.3/devel/sage-main/sage/rings/finite_rings/finite_field_givaro.py`:

```
  PARI elements are interpreted as finite field elements; this PARI flexibility 
  is (absurdly!) liberal
```

There is a more mathematical difficulty with what you wish to do, and how one could expect Sage to do it.  There are, of course, two embeddings of GF(25) into GF(5<sup>12</sup>), with the same image.  Thus  there is no canonical way of identifying an element of GF(5<sup>12</sup>) belonging to the subfield of order 25 with an element of another field of order 25.

But it is possible, in a very simple-minded way, to find the two candidates:

```
sage: z = a^10172526
sage: z.multiplicative_order()
24
sage: [[y for y in K if f(y) == z][0] for f in Hom(K, F)]
[d, 4*d + 1]
```
Or, much more efficiently,

```
sage: z.minimal_polynomial().roots(ring=K, multiplicities=False)
[4*d + 1, d]
```

---

Another point: there's no need to define `element_primitif`; it's built in:

```
sage: K.primitive_element()
d
```

I think this should be closed as invalid, or duplicate of #11938 and #8751 let's say although that particular ticket only targets finite fields implemented through givaro.

Or it should be changed to "Going down in compatibly embedded lattices of finite fields" and made a follow-up ticket to #8335 for psuedo-Conway lattices or #8751 for general lattices.
