The following code fails:

```
sage: R.<T>=Qp(3,prec=2)[]
sage: S.<Tbar>=R.quo(T^2+1)
sage: S(T^2).matrix()
TypeError: cannot construct an element of Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over 3-adic Field with capped relative precision 2 from [2 + 2*3 + O(3^2), 0, O(3^2), 0, 2 + 2*3 + O(3^2), 0, O(3^2)]!
sage: S(T^2)
(O(3^2))*Tbar^2 + (2 + 2*3 + O(3^2))
```

The term `(O(3<sup>2))*Tbar</sup>2` should not be present since we modded out by `T^2+1`.
