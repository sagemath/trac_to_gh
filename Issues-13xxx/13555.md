Currently a lot of random functions are skipped during doc-testing, as their results can't be predicted.

However, in ticket [#13554](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/13554), it is clear that errors are slipping through, and __**properties**__ of random objects should be checked when possible.

For example, in ticket [#13554](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/13554), the generated matrices should at least be tested for the following (if they aren't already):

* Presence of zero entries when method/documentation states that no zero entries should be created, unless density= keyword is used.
* method=echelon_form produces matrices in echelon form.
* method=echelonizable can be echelonized.
* method=unimodular has a determinant of 1.
* method=diagonizable can be diagonalized and eigenvalues are integers.
* x= , y= has all entries between x (inclusive) and y (non-inclusive), unless density= keyword is used and 0 isn't between x and y. (In that case entries should be either between x and y, or zero.)

If something goes into the documentation, then it should probably be tested there as well, or removed from the documentation. If a change somewhere else then breaks the doctest, then that at least acts as a flag that the documentation needs to be changed.

This is some code I put together to check matrix values element by element:

```
A = random_matrix(ZZ,5); A
def checkfunc(matrix, func):
    for val in matrix.list():
        if func(val) == True:
            return True
    return False
checkfunc(A, lambda x: x == 0)

A = random_matrix(ZZ,5,x=4,y=10)
checkfunc(A, lambda x: (x >= 4 & x < 10))

```
It's been a while since I was an efficient python programmer, so I'm sure someone will show me a generator/list method which is a lot more efficient.

I did checkfunc as a function because I was thinking about large matricies and saving memory space (as well as returning on the first match to the conditions). I'm not satisfied with the fact that checkfunc iterates over a list rather than a generator.

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
I also got the second lambda function incorrect. We're testing if any values are outside the range 4 (inclusive) to 10 exclusive in my example matrix.

so it should be something like:

```
lambda x: (x < 4 | x >= 10)
```
or even better

```
lambda x: x not in range(4,10)
```
I did get an iterator-only method for getting elements of a matrix using this:

```
(A[valrow][valcolm] for valrow in xrange(A.dimensions()[0]) for valcolm in xrange(A.dimensions()[1]))

```
But then I realized that since we're only using this function  (theoretically) in doc-checking, we probably don't have to worry about  memory concerns and iterators versus lists. jhpalmieri's approach seems  nice and simple.

Found a way to iterate over elements in a matrix using a generator.

if M is a matrix, then this:

```
(M[vals[0],vals[1]] for vals in xmrange(M.dimensions()))
```
will return a generator object that does the job.
