Stanislav Bulygin pointed me to another issue with the `PolyBoRi` interface in Sage:

```
P.<x,y,z>=BooleanPolynomialRing(3)
gb=Ideal([x*z + y*z + z, x*y + x*z + x + y*z + y + z])
gb.groebner_basis()
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (14, 0))
[...]
add_vars=set(used_vars_set(to_reduce).variables()).difference(ll_ranks.keys())
    145   for v in add_vars:
    146       ll_ranks[v]=-1

AttributeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.pbori.BooleConstant' object has
no attribute 'variables'
```

The reason is that Sage's reimplementation of `PolyBoRi`'s `BooleConstant` misses some routines.
