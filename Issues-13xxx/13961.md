I've been willing to write this for aaaaaaaaaaaaaages !!!

Three patches : 
* one creates a new module with a lot of doc, and a `root_graph` function.
* another one moves `is_line_graph` and `line_graph` to this new module, and imports them into `generic_graph` and `graph`
* another one modifies `is_line_graph` so that it can also return root graphs.

YeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHHH !!

Well, this patch does not contain a line of Cython so it is quite unlikely that it could produce a segfault by itself. The problem most probably comes from subgraph_search, which occasionnally segfaults (it happens to me sometimes when I interrupt it during a computation).

This being said I was not able to reproduce it on my computer.

The segfault happens in the isomorphism test at the end. I tried to track it back.

Inside the isomorphic function (file sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/refinement_graphs.pyx), it happens during the call to

```
cdef bint isomorphic = double_coset(<void *>GS1, <void *>GS2, part, ordering, n, &all_children_are_equivalent, &refine_by_degree, &compare_graphs, NULL, NULL, output)
```
Inside sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/double_coset.pyx:

```
work_space = allocate_dc_work_space(n)
```
and inside the `SC_new` function in sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/data_structures_pyx.pxi, we have:
* an assignment before a NULL test: `SC.gen_used.bits[limbs-1] = 0` and `SC.gen_is_id.bits[limbs-1] = 0`
* a call to the `SC_dealloc` in which we test if `SC.generators` is not NULL to dealloc both `SC.generators` AND `SC.gen_inverses`. Quite unsafe, no?

At this point I'm no longer able to understand what's going on, but there is a pointer allocation problem somewhere. 
The call to `sage_free(SC.generators[i])` with i=0 fails but that pointer is apparently not NULL. O_o

In your code, you should change this:
* "The this is that this implementation" -> "the problem is that this implementation"
