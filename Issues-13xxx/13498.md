From the [GCC 4.7 release notes](http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.7/changes.html) (C++ section):

G++ now correctly implements the two-phase lookup rules such that an unqualified name used in a template must have an appropriate declaration found either in scope at the point of definition of the template or by argument-dependent lookup at the point of instantiation. As a result, code that relies on a second unqualified lookup at the point of instantiation to find functions declared after the template or in dependent bases will be rejected. The compiler will suggest ways to fix affected code, and using the `-fpermissive` compiler flag will allow the code to compile with a warning.

```c

template <class T>
void f() { g(T()); } // error, g(int) not found by argument-dependent lookup
void g(int) { } // fix by moving this declaration before the declaration of f

template <class T>
struct A: T {
  // error, B::g(B) not found by argument-dependent lookup
  void f() { g(T()); } // fix by using this->g or A::g
};

struct B { void g(B); };

int main()
{
  f<int>();
  A<B>().f();
}
```

From sage-devel (April 2013):

```
4ti2 version 1.5 quietly lives in http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/software/latte-integrale-1.5.3.tar.gz
on http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/software.php 

That version 1.5 still does not work on OSX, but at least it works on Linux, as far as I recall.

Dima
```

The [LattE integrale tarball](http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/software/latte-integrale-1.5.3.tar.gz) in turn contains a (compressed) 4ti2-1.5 tarball.  From its `NEWS`:

```
News in 4ti2 version 1.5, compared to 1.4:

 * Latest version of new qsolve.


News in 4ti2 version 1.4, compared to 1.3.2:

 * Portability fixes

 * New abstract C and C++ API (callable library), header files in 4ti2/

 * New implementation of zsolve in C++

...
```

Using `RayImplementation<IndexSet>::sort` there solves these for me (GCC 4.8.0).

Ok, this is due to

```
g++-4.8.0: error: unrecognized command line option '-R'
```
in the `configure` tests.

Do you mean it doesn't build with Apple's GCC 4.2.1?

Works for me if I "fix" (or bypass) the pretty useless `configure` test for `cstdint`, or e.g. use Sage's GCC 4.6.3 instead, on MacOS X 10.6.8 at least.

William's post doesn't mention MacOS X at all...

(And I've already noted that `4ti2gmp` currently doesn't get built because 4ti2 doesn't detect GMP/MPIR properly, IIRC just some `configure` flaw as well.  I think LattE ships with some dead old version of GMP, which in turn won't build with contemporary versions of GCC either.)

I could give it a try (again); that's why I was asking what the alleged problems with MacOS X were ... ;-)

I think I tried last time in Sept 2012, within Sage shell, i.e. running (probably?) a better gcc than shipped by Apple.

Anyhow, I am willing to test on OSX, but I don't have time to do packaging.

That's presumably just due to using too "new" autotools...
