Because of DL_IMPORT stuff in headers generated by Cython and corresponding _ _ imp _ _ prefixes added in object files, farey.o cannot be linked to farey_symbol.o (it could with farey_symbol.dll if we generated it...).

The patch here does not include farey_symbol.h but directly declare the prototype of the needed functions in farey.cpp, with the extern "C" stuff but without the dllspec(import) stuff.

So it looks like that the linker cannot find objects which are part of the Farey module (i.e. from sl2z.o, etc)?! 

Looks like some g++/dll linking weirdness to me.

Yes...
In fact we'll get the same problem later with the wrapper_* things in ext/interpreter.

What's strange is that I don't remember getting it here the last time.
But I kind of so much tweaked the files back then that it must have been that as well.

I think the problem is as follows:
As convert_* are declared extern in farey_symbol.h (from the public modifier in farey_symbol.pyx) g++ adds _ _ imp _ _ prefixes in farey.o.
Then if you actually build a dll of farey_symbol.cpp alone and link a dll of farey.o alone to it ld is fine.
But when you want to directly link farey_symbol.o and farey.o together, ld whines...

This seems to be the problem.
If you remove the DL_IMPORT lines in farey_symbol.h (generated by Cython), you'll link correctly.

I've got some ideas from here:
