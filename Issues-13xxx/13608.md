As reported in https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-support/_SGY3ohrmk8 :

```
sage: import mpmath
sage: exp(mpmath.mpf('-0.0712959029907420240935')) 
```
fails with "`TypeError: 'int' object is not callable`". As Karl-Dieter Crisman discovered, this is because `exp(a)` by default calls `a.exp()`, and for mpmath floats, `a.exp` (no parentheses) returns a Python int representing its binary exponent -- which isn't callable.

Our top-level `exp()` function should properly evaluate mpf numbers!

I agree, we need better mpmath integration. The "workaround" patch does fix the problem, although it seems like not a very good solution.

I would say anyone who *does* want the mpmath exp attribute can call it directly. 

As for other things that don't work:

* `log` and trig functions (`sin`, `arccos`, as well as hyperbolics) all fail because they can't convert the `mpf` to the symbolic ring. That's a different problem than we have for `exp`.

* `gamma` works but throws a strange deprecation error.

* `sqrt` works.

So the problem here is unique and due to the "exp" collision.

```
sage: import mpmath
sage: a = mpmath.mpf('-0.0712959029907420240935')
sage: mpmath.gamma(a)
mpf('-14.678778643873606')
sage: mpmath.acos(a)
mpf('1.6421527691351614')

I'd hate to have a check in every single function for mpmath objects, very inelegant.  But this seems like the "right" way to handle it (i.e., use mpmath versions of functions for mpf objects).

kcrisman pointed out this issue here in response to [my question on Ask Sage](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1937/write-function-for-use-by-both-mpmath-and-sage). I'd like to see this fixed eventually. I agree with ddrake that the `exp` issue is special, and might therefore need special attention. If this ticket here should focus on `exp` alone, please point out or create a new ticket for other functions.

The problem with `exp` being an attribute but not callable are due to [sage/symbolic/function.pyx@16735#L721.](../tree/master/sage/symbolic/function.pyx@16735#L721.)

kcrisman suggested using functions from the `mpmath` module where appropriate.

Should I write a patch for any of this?

OK, this `bug13608a.patch` does the `callable` check described in [comment:6](#comment:6), and also the special-casing to use `mpmath` functions where available, and fall back to using implicit conversions otherwise. There still is no automatic coercion of `mpf` to `SR`. If that is still desired, I believe it should be in another commit.

As a drive-by fix, this patch does limit the scope of a number of `try`…`except` in such a way that an exception encountered while *searching* for a function does not get confused with an exception caused by *executing* that function. This could lead to more useful error messages in some cases, and perhaps even affect correctness of behaviour in some other cases. I don't have concrete examples, though, as I don't know a sure way to trigger one of these exceptions in a builtin function.

That seems very reasonable.  Also, perhaps we should first coerce mpmath numbers to `RR(prec=foo)` as you suggest above (in that later ticket).

Might want to add a test that the `exp` of mpmath works.

```
sage: mpmath.mpf('0.5').exp
-1
```
or something.  I think more tests in general would be good - maybe for a complex `mpc` and some interesting function, for some interesting input.  Similarly, an example where the `except AttributeError: ` branch is reached would be nice, since in Sage 5.2 I get

```
sage: import mpmath
sage: getattr(mpmath,'exp')
<built-in method _sage_exp of MPContext object at 0x117f21600>
sage: modulefn = getattr(mpmath,'exp')
sage: modulefn(mpmath.mpf('0.5'))
mpf('1.6487212707001282')
```
so it seems the first branch is the one that fixes the problem in question.

There seems to be something missing, by the way, immediately above `if len(args) == 1: ` - maybe hg blame can help here.  I think it's just

```
                #     exp(M)

and I think I may have even been involved on that ticket, but I'm not sure how that didn't get in properly.

Agreed: coercion to `SR` should go via the `RealField` of appropriate precision.

Good idea, will add that later.

Currently, my `arcsin` example should cater for that, as there is only `mpmath.asin`, not `mpmath.arcsin`. But in the long run, there should be some aliasing mechanism that invokes `arin` in this case. 

One problem here is telling the difference: in an ideal world, both versions of a function would yield identical results, so it's hard to tell which function actually got called. And if there is a case where results differ, then that difference is likely a bug, and nothing we'd want to rely on in tests. So how can we see which implementation got called, short of monkey-patching the module to use a different function?

Can't follow you: why do you believe something is missing? My patch was the result of a `hg diff` based on `17335:d06cf4b2215d`.

I don't have time to investigate right now, so just a quick comment.

The code path for evaluating symbolic functions is very time sensitive. We should check for speed regressions before accepting anything that modifies it. I'm afraid adding a callable check, or a new Python function call for mpmath function might be too expensive.

I did the following check:

```
a = [RDF(i*0.01) for i in range(100)]
timeit('[sin(i) for i in a]', repeat=100, number=10000)
```

and studied the effect of the following code change:

```
-        if len(args) == 1 and not hold and not dont_call_method_on_arg and \
-                hasattr(args[0], self._name):
-            return getattr(args[0], self._name)()
+        if len(args) == 1 and not hold and not dont_call_method_on_arg:
+            memberfn = getattr(args[0], self._name, None)
+            if callable(memberfn): 
+                return memberfn()
```

The time per loop went *down* from 47 µs to 42 µs. So the cost of that `callable` seems to be far less than the overhead due to the `hasattr` in the original code. And in any case the change is very small. Avoiding `hasattr` but doing a `memberfn is not None` instead of the `callable(memberfn)` I got those 42 µs again, so the cost of `callable` gets lost in the noise. For reference: the direct method invocation `i.sin()` amounts to 29 µs per loop.

> or a new Python function call for mpmath function

To judge the cost of the mpmath check, I used the two-argument function `atan2` like this:

```
a = [(RDF(i), RDF(i + 2)) for i in range(100)]
timeit('[atan2(y, x) for y, x in a]', repeat=10, number=1000)
```

Subject to the whole patch (basically as submitted before, although I'll attach an updated version shortly) the running time increased from 5.7 ms to 5.8 ms per loop. Not much, perhaps not even significant. And this won't affect GiNaC functions that translate to member invocations, which should cover quite a large number of use cases. Even more after `@`a526457085e3f07440dc39cb77f93ef3e32ae2af which isn't included in my 5.10 code base yet.

Talking of turning function calls to member invocations: in [src/sage/symbolic/function.pyx@8118b2b39e3a129a5a6186fdc9917940f92b87a6#L387](../tree/master/src/sage/symbolic/function.pyx@8118b2b39e3a129a5a6186fdc9917940f92b87a6#L387) the `Function.__call__` implementation claims to contain work which enables `exp(M)` for matrices `M`.
