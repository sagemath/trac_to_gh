We have access to several exact and heuristics for bandwidth minimization in graphs:
* Using `from sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.bandwidth import bandwidth`, we get an exact algorithm that can be used on small graphs
* Using `from sage.graphs.base.boost_graph import bandwidth_heuristics`, we get boost implementations of the heuristics proposed by `Cuthill-McKee` and by `King` (in C++)
* Using `networkx`, we have `networkx.utils.rcm.cuthill_mckee_ordering` and `networkx.utils.rcm.reverse_cuthill_mckee_ordering` (in Python)

If needed, we can make a small frontend method to all these methods... and otherwise we should close this ticket.
