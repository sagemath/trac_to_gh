PolyBoRi does not support the degrevlex term ordering, so !Sage emulates it by fiddling with the variable indices. This has produced subtle bugs over and over again. In light of this, "degrevlex" should be removed and replaced by a piece of documentation explaining how to emulate it by hand ("reverse your variables").

Depends on #13848

Of course I am biased, but I completely second the suggestion.
I would like to give a little bit background.
With ZDDs it's not possible to implement arbitrary monomial orderings
efficiently.
This is the reason why we have implemented only some orders which suffice for 
all most computations: lex., block, deglex, and degree reverse lexicographical ordering ascending.
The ascending is there for a reason: It is exactly like degrevlex only that x_1<x_2.
So, you have just to reverse variables (as malb explained) to get the same behaviour.
Another aspect is that we deal in PolyBoRi functions with ZDDs and suppose a certain behaviour.
This might result in wrong results, slow behaviour or other errors.

It's unfortunate that it does not seem feasible to have a compatibility layer, but it's really difficult to have an interface that does both expose all power and flexibility of PolyBoRi and at the same time pretends that there is no library with very specific structures under the interface.

Hi!

I agree with the analysis of Alexander.
That were my own thoughts except that I do not think that the best
way really ends up best for the user (even if we had all time of the world).

I would like to add two more thoughts.
I think we should really encourage users
to have a look at all the tricks in PolyBoRi and call
PolyBoRi functions directly when needed.
In particular while the Sage docs feature a first class
reference manual, our docs supplement it by profound
advice on performance optimization.

Luckily Alexander repaired the typesetting of our docs.
I really would have preferred him to enjoy his vacations,
but since he repaired it, I would like to post the following link:

Given the following behaviour
http://polybori.sourceforge.net/doc/tutorial/tutorialse2.html#x3-140002.1
any confusion about index order is really evil.

Michael

<a id='comment:12'>Comment 12:</a>
Martin, what you say is correct (unless you define degnexlex otherwise in some context I do not know).
Degrevlex as in Singular corresponds to

```
1 1 1
0 0 -1
0 -1 0
```
or equivalenty, but redundant.

```
1 1 1
0 0 -1
0 -1 0
-1 0 0
```

So you see, it has to aspects (one negative and one from behind),
the name might be considered as broken and irritating.

Negative lexicographical as in Singular (not a well ordering).

```
-1 0 0
0 -1 0
0 0  -1
```

As you can see degrevlex as in Singular is composed of the
degree vector and
negative lexicographical ordering (ls), but in reversed variable ordering.

deglex as in PolyBoRi and in Singular (Dp with a big D)

```
1 1 1
1 0 0
0 1 0
```

dp_asc as in PolyBoRi (degree reverse lexicographical ordering ascending)

```
1 1 1
-1 0 0
0 -1 0
```

So, the notion, degneglex can have it's benefits from systematic perspective
as it's composed of the degree vector and the (non well ordering) negative lexicographical and indeed itself again a well ordering.
From an unsystematical perspective, I just always added the ascending to the "degree reverse lexicographical" as it made sure it's the same order but twised

It's a simple ordering, but it is not equivalenty to degrevlex as in Singular
and does not feature the nice theoretical properties for a certain class of systems (I've never come to the observation that that they apply in Boolean context).

While most people agree on these notions, here is no proper standardization on notions in computational algebra.
I have indeed already seen some people define degree reverse lexicographical ordering to be the ordering PolyBoRi calls dp_asc.
