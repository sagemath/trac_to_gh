```
Cygchecking the package shows that it looks for an inexistent libLfunction.so.
Indeed, this file is moved to libLfunction.dll on Cygwin to let Sage build.
But at runtime, it is the original .so file which is looked for (surely some DT_SONAME equivalent).
Letting libLfunction.so in place and symlinking it from libLfunction.dll seems more functional.

A better solution would to tell lcalc to build directly a .dll file on Cygwin (and .dylib on Mac OS X, etc.).

I'm away at a conference, and don't have access to a WIndows machine, until Sunday. And then I'll have jetlag :-)

That's expected, this file is not touched and does not depend on the spkg.
