```
Cygchecking the package shows that it looks for an inexistent libLfunction.so.
Indeed, this file is moved to libLfunction.dll on Cygwin to let Sage build.
But at runtime, it is the original .so file which is looked for (surely some DT_SONAME equivalent).
Letting libLfunction.so in place and symlinking it from libLfunction.dll seems more functional.

A better solution would to tell lcalc to build directly a .dll file on Cygwin (and .dylib on Mac OS X, etc.).

Update lcalc spkg, modifying lot of the Makefile (that we already modify and which is not that nice) available at
http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/sage/lcalc-1.23.p11.spkg

This will also need a Sage library patch.

I'm away at a conference, and don't have access to a WIndows machine, until Sunday. And then I'll have jetlag :-)
So it has to wait for few days, sorry.
