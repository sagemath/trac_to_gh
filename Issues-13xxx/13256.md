Implementation of absolute value (abs), floor (floor) and ceiling (ceil) function for elements in quadratic number field.

The implementation uses only manipulation of (mpz) integers.

The function abs depends on the function sign implemented in ticket #13213.

This syntax is still available. The patch only aims to implement methods abs, floor and ceil for quadratic elements. As an example

```
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: sqrt2.floor()
1
```
It is yet possible (without the patch) to do

```
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: floor(sqrt2)
1
```
But there is a simpler and faster way to do it compared to what floor does (using the real interval field with finer and finer approximations). Note that if the method .floor is present, the the function floor will use it!


> Would number fields from quadratics not automatically be quadratic fields (when mathematically appropriate, I'm excluding `x^2-1` and the like) and inherit these methods, or would that simply not work now?


Yes, it is the way it is

```
sage: type(NumberField(x^2 + 1, 'a'))
<class 'sage.rings.number_field.number_field.NumberField_quadratic_with_category'>
```
