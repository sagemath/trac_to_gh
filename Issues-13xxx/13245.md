```
With the attached patches, `sage --clone`

* does no longer rebuild the reference manual,

* does no longer unnecessarily rebuild the whole Sage library (just because of a missing Cython version file).

In e.g. the `sage-combinat` script, there are usually so many patches applied in the queue, it makes more sense to (re)build the manual **after** applying the patches, not before.

The unintended rebuild of all extension modules upon cloning is a bug introduced by #13031.

Here is a different patch; this one just turns off docbuilding in `sage-clone` altogether.

Oh, forgot:  Cython-generated header files (`*.h`) don't contain a special comment on that on the first line (which is probably an upstream Cython bug), so the following currently doesn't work as expected either:

```python
            if ext in ['.h', '.c', '.cpp']:
                if 'Cython' in open(src + '/' + F).readline():
                    os.link(src + '/' + F, dest + '/' +F)
                    os.utime(dest + '/' +F, None)
```

(For the moment, we could look for `^#ifndef __PYX_HAVE__sage__` in those, probably even without the `sage__`.)

> Rebuilding the fast_callable interpreters doesn't take too much time, so I'm not dealing with it right now.


Yes, but it also triggers the rebuild of (currently) at least one *other* Cython module (besides the newly generated five `sage.ext.interpreters.wrapper_*.pyx`):

```
...
Building interpreters for fast_callable
Updating Cython code....
Compiling sage/plot/plot3d/parametric_surface.pyx because it depends on ./sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_rdf.pxd.
...
building 'sage.plot.plot3d.parametric_surface' extension
...
```

(I think we could just copy over *all* files in `sage/ext/interpreters/`, which is in `.hgignore`.)

Note sure what or whether doc-rebuilding is triggered (upon next `sage --docbuild ...`) by rebuilding the interpreters though.




Could you explain why we "touch" almost all manually copied (more precisely, linked) files?




> Leif, would you like to be listed as an author?


Does the patch introduce new environment variables? :P

Replying to [jhpalmieri](#comment%3A11):
> Given the upcoming transition to git, I don't think it's worth trying to wrestle with Mercurial very much. I don't want to spend much more time on it, anyway.


Yes, hopefully.

Anyway, the title (and parts of the description) still advertise *an option* to disable docbuilding, but the currently listed patch just disables it unconditionally.  Which way do we want to go?

I think that rebuilding the files in `sage/ext/interpreters/` is because of code in `devel/sage/setup.py`, and any changes to this should be on another ticket.

Meanwhile, the patch [attachment:trac_13245-clone-cython.patch] seems to fix the main cloning problem. I'm happy with that one.

I'm having another header file in the original but not the clone:

`sage/rings/complex_double_api.h`, which starts with

```c
#ifndef __PYX_HAVE_API__sage__rings__complex_double
#define __PYX_HAVE_API__sage__rings__complex_double
#include "Python.h"
#include "complex_double.h"

static struct __pyx_obj_4sage_5rings_14complex_double_ComplexDoubleElement *(*__pyx_f_4sage_5rings_14complex_double_new_ComplexDoubleElement)(void) = 0;
#define new_ComplexDoubleElement __pyx_f_4sage_5rings_14complex_double_new_ComplexDoubleElement

#ifndef __PYX_HAVE_RT_ImportModule
#define __PYX_HAVE_RT_ImportModule
```

(and is explicitly listed in `.hgignore`).

I couldn't find any places where this is actually used though, nor do I know where it originates from.

Although it looks Cython-generated, it doesn't get recreated when I touch `complex_double*` sources.

It *seems*<sup>TM</sup> to be some left-over file we still ship, despite it being in `.hgignore`; the file date is July 9th 2012...

So it apparently doesn't matter whether we copy / link it or not, but I feel a bit uncomfortable.

Hmmm, did some testing, and it seems copying over any already built documentation doesn't make sense (or doesn't work as expected at least).

I've made sure that the documentation (and the Sage library) is up-to-date, but if I run `sage --docbuild reference html` afterwards in a fresh clone, apparently *everything* (of the reference manual) gets rebuilt.

It says

```
[foo] building [html]: targets for N source files that are out of date
[foo] updating environment: 0 added, N changed, 0 removed
...
```
for all components AFAICS.

(This is with 5.10.rc0.)

I meant that we should either drop copying over any "pre-built" documentation (since it doesn't work -- there's apparently no difference to building all from scratch), or fix rebuilding [all of it].

Since we both seem to be unable to do (or don't want to spend time on) the latter, I think we should go with the former.

? I don't understand what you mean by that; `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main/doc/output/...` at least is always there.

I don't see why cloning should vanish with the switch to git.

What's most annoying to me is that the whole documentation gets rebuilt (upon `sage --docbuild reference html`) when I switch back to the original branch (which is supposed to be left untouched).

(I can't believe that's always been the case, at least I don't recall having ever experienced that, but perhaps I simply never tried.)

It seems `python setup.py install` somehow doesn't play well with Sphinx...

a) If you had committed changes to the main repo, you should of course run `sage -b` before cloning.  (It would be better to test with a vanilla Sage library.)

b) Are you sure *everything* (= *all* extension modules) got rebuilt, as opposed to just changed modules and those that depend on the changed ones (the latter potentially being many, even if not many got changed)?

c) Is that a regression?

(The current brokenness of `sage -sync-build` *might* be related, although I don't see that `sage -combinat` calls it.)

The messages don't seem to be in chronological order (probably `stdout` and `stderr` out of sync); I somehow doubt all extension modules got rebuilt if "re-cythonizing" took just 33 seconds...

There are no changes to `sage -sync-build` yet.

a) I only applied the two patches to the scripts repo, nothing to the main repo (I had just built sage, didn't even start it yet).

b) Not 100% but almost since there are far fewer extensions that get rebuilt after pushing/popping the entire combinat queue, and it seemed like the same number of modules after running `-sync-build` (which currently erases all cython files). I can't tell you the interesting lines because I didn't think I would need it (and I really don't want to go through rebuilding it all again) At least afterwards, switching between branches is fast. Nevertheless I would think changes in one branch's built extensions would not affect another's...

Did you run

```
sage --clone foo
sage -b foo
```
and then

```
sage -b main
```
?

Not explicitly, since `sage-clone` already runs `sage -b` in the new clone.

```
./sage -b   # to make sure everything was up to date
./sage --combinat install

I *think<sup>TM</sup>* I know what the problem might be, namely the *order* in which subdirectories of `devel/sage/build/` are copied.

Since the odd addition of `build_dir` in `setup.py`, which already breaks `sage-sync-build`, the Cython-generated `.c` and `.cpp` files also end up below `build/`.

Now if these get copied (and touched!) **after** their corresponding `.o` and `.so` files, the latter will get rebuilt.




Travis, could you switch back to the main branch, remove the line setting `build_dir` from `setup.py` (or change `build_dir='build/cythonized'` to `build_dir=None`), do `sage -b` to get a clean new main repo, and retry your test? B)

Doing so right now, although the change seems to have triggered a recompile/recythonizing of the cython files (it might have been a side effect of one of my other tests). However I need to sleep, so I'll finish the test in the morning. Thanks.

With

```python
def copy_dtree(src_dir, dest_dir):
    src_root = os.path.abspath(src_dir)
    dest_root = os.path.abspath(dest_dir)

    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(src_root):
        nroot = dest_root + root[len(src_root):]
        for d in dirs:
            os.makedirs(nroot+'/'+d)
        for f in files:
            if os.path.splitext(f)[1] in [".c",".cpp",".o",".so"]: # ADDED
                print("  %s" % f) # ADDED
            os.link(root+'/'+f,nroot+'/'+f)
            os.utime(nroot+'/'+f, None)

sys.stdout.flush(); sys.stderr.flush() # ADDED
print "Copying over build directory..."
copy_dtree('sage/build', branch + '/build')
sys.stdout.flush(); sys.stderr.flush() # ADDED
```
I can at least confirm that *for me* all `.o` and `.so` files get copied *after* all `.c` and `.cpp` files have been copied -- rather incidentally I think.

At least the `.cython_version` part here.

And we should really disable (postpone) Cython-generated files "out-of-tree", since this breaks both `sage-clone` and `sage-sync-build`, i.e., set `build_dir` to `None` in `setup.py`.

([Even] with that, upgrading from beta4+ will still trigger the rebuild of the whole Sage library, but only once.)
