It seems, that the lines cannot be longer than 100 characters and that that is somewhere hard-coded. It would be good if that can be changed somewhere.

This seems to be fixed with the version of lrs installed in current Sage.

```
sage: prec = 24
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[[10^prec,0], [0,10^prec], [-10^prec,0], [0,-10^prec]])
sage: P.volume(engine='lrs')
