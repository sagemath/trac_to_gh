[This sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-support/pQ3RHcyLRPM) raised the interesting question of having not just custom ticks, but then custom formatting of said ticks one-by-one (say, setting the ticks but wanting them labeled `x_0`, `x_1`, etc.).

User "ObsessiveMathsFreak" contributed the following code there.

```
==========================

def plot_labels(x_ticks,x_labels,y_ticks,y_labels,fontsize=12):
    import matplotlib.ticker
    def latex_ticklabels(lbls_x,lbls_y):
        return [matplotlib.ticker.FixedFormatter(lbls_x),matplotlib.ticker.FixedFormatter(lbls_y)]
    
    ft=fontsize
    return plot([],ticks=[x_ticks,y_ticks],tick_formatter=latex_ticklabels(x_labels,y_labels),fontsize=ft)



PL=plot_labels([1,3],["$x_1$","$x_2$"],[1,2,3.5],["$y_1$","$y_2$","$y_3$"],fontsize=15)

P0=plot(x,(x,0,2))
P1=plot(x^2,(x,0,4))

show(P0+PL)
show(P1+PL)

==========================

I hope this is useful
```

Maybe there is a way we can work that into our tick and formatting framework.

You also said:

This can be tested with a plot like this:

```
plot(x, (x,0,2), ticks=[[1,2],[1,2,3.5]], tick_formatter=[["$x_1$","$x_2$"],["$y_1$","$y_2$","$y_3$"]])
```
There should probably be more checks like

```
len(ticks[0]) == len(tick_formatter[0])
```
and so on, but that can be addressed in a proper patch.
