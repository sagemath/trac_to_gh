[This sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-support/pQ3RHcyLRPM) raised the interesting question of having not just custom ticks, but then custom formatting of said ticks one-by-one (say, setting the ticks but wanting them labeled `x_0`, `x_1`, etc.).

User "ObsessiveMathsFreak" contributed the following code there.

```
==========================

def plot_labels(x_ticks,x_labels,y_ticks,y_labels,fontsize=12):
    import matplotlib.ticker
    def latex_ticklabels(lbls_x,lbls_y):
        return [matplotlib.ticker.FixedFormatter(lbls_x),matplotlib.ticker.FixedFormatter(lbls_y)]
    
    ft=fontsize
    return plot([],ticks=[x_ticks,y_ticks],tick_formatter=latex_ticklabels(x_labels,y_labels),fontsize=ft)



PL=plot_labels([1,3],["$x_1$","$x_2$"],[1,2,3.5],["$y_1$","$y_2$","$y_3$"],fontsize=15)

P0=plot(x,(x,0,2))
P1=plot(x^2,(x,0,4))

show(P0+PL)
show(P1+PL)

==========================

I hope this is useful
```

Maybe there is a way we can work that into our tick and formatting framework.

You also said:

This can be tested with a plot like this:

```
plot(x, (x,0,2), ticks=[[1,2],[1,2,3.5]], tick_formatter=[["$x_1$","$x_2$"],["$y_1$","$y_2$","$y_3$"]])
```
There should probably be more checks like

```
len(ticks[0]) == len(tick_formatter[0])
```
and so on, but that can be addressed in a proper patch.

Yeah, that was probably a little sloppy, and in any case, this is new functionality.  If it doesn't break the old one... since these things have to be strings, maybe one could check if the first item was a string, and then let it go through...  Just seems like

```
plot(sin(x),(x,-2*pi,2*pi),ticks=[1,2,3],tick_formatter=['a','b','c'])

should work, by analogy with the other things that already work.

My point is that there isn't an easy way to determine how many there will be, but that once one *does* know (for instance, by plotting the picture with `ticks=pi`), then they might as well be able to do the formatting I suggest.
