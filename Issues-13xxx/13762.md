This will implement the k-bounded quotient space, whose basis is indexed by monomial symmetric functions indexed by k-bounded partitions. It is the dual Hopf algebra to the k-bounded subspace where the k-Schur functions live. In doing so, I have also fixed the bug from Ticket #13743.

Hi Chris,

Thanks for the new patch. I assume this fixes the coercion bug? Did you also fold 

* trac_13762_addthis.patch
* trac_13762_possiblefix.patch

that were passed around by e-mail, or should they go after this patch still?

This patch implements the K-k-Schur functions and their duals. I tested this code my old private code and it gives the correct answers in the cases I checked.

Chris and Mike, here are a couple more comments I have:

* When building the documentation I get an error

```
sage/combinat/sf/new_kschur                                                                  
Sphinx error:
'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 34698: ordinal not in range(128)
```

* Line 549 of the patch "Returns the symmetric functions. Needed to make TestSuite work" probably needs to be changed.

* You need an extra line after 650.

* In line 883 of new_kschur (in the patch) the dash is strange

```
.. [LamSchillingShimozono2010] T. Lam, A. Schilling, M.Shimozono, K-theory Schubert calculus of the affine Grassmannian, 
 	883	        Compositio Math. 146 (2010), 811â��852. 
```
Also, this reference should probably appear in def K_kschur(self) as well.

* Line 887 """r  should read r""" (or remove the r)

So much for now!

Anne

Anne,

Aren't the documentation error and the dash error related? I replaced the dash and the documentation builds fine on my machine.

Because the patch had changed so much, I didn't know where to put a line after 650, because line 650 had probably changed.

Everything else is fixed. Yes, all the other patches are folded into this.

Apply: trac_13762_k_quotient.patch

There has been a discussion about the usage of "assert" and you should not use "assert" for bad user input, only to check for actual bugs. Bad input should probably give a `ValueError` instead.

If there is any way at all to reproduce an `AssertionError` using documented public functions, that is by definition a bug.

Hi Jeroen,
There are a few '`assert`' lines that we can clearly remove and change to `ValueError`, but there is one I am unsure about.  Around line 599 in k_dual.py we have

```
if isinstance(c, Partition_class): 
      assert len(rest) == 0 
```
I don't see how to trigger this.  Is it ok to leave it as is?

Some of our assertion errors that appear are triggered in code in free_module.py.  Should I change that code here or open a new ticket?

Absolutely. This is how `assert` should be used: to say "this condition is always true, without any further assumptions".

I don't think you have to change it here, but at least make sure you don't introduce any new wrongly-used asserts.

Please read some comments from #12313, which apply to this code:
