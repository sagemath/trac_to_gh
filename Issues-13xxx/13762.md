This will implement the k-bounded quotient space, whose basis is indexed by monomial symmetric functions indexed by k-bounded partitions. It is the dual Hopf algebra to the k-bounded subspace where the k-Schur functions live. In doing so, I have also fixed the bug from Ticket #13743.

Hi Chris,

Thanks for the new patch. I assume this fixes the coercion bug? Did you also fold 

* trac_13762_addthis.patch
* trac_13762_possiblefix.patch

that were passed around by e-mail, or should they go after this patch still?

This patch implements the K-k-Schur functions and their duals. I tested this code my old private code and it gives the correct answers in the cases I checked.

Chris and Mike, here are a couple more comments I have:

* When building the documentation I get an error

```
sage/combinat/sf/new_kschur                                                                  
Sphinx error:
'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 34698: ordinal not in range(128)
```

* Line 549 of the patch "Returns the symmetric functions. Needed to make TestSuite work" probably needs to be changed.

* You need an extra line after 650.

* In line 883 of new_kschur (in the patch) the dash is strange

```
.. [LamSchillingShimozono2010] T. Lam, A. Schilling, M.Shimozono, K-theory Schubert calculus of the affine Grassmannian, 
 	883	        Compositio Math. 146 (2010), 811â��852. 
```
Also, this reference should probably appear in def K_kschur(self) as well.

* Line 887 """r  should read r""" (or remove the r)

So much for now!

Anne

Anne,

Aren't the documentation error and the dash error related? I replaced the dash and the documentation builds fine on my machine.

Because the patch had changed so much, I didn't know where to put a line after 650, because line 650 had probably changed.

Everything else is fixed. Yes, all the other patches are folded into this.

Hi Chris,

Thanks for the changes. The line that should be added is after line 807 in the current version.
Other than that it looks good to me. If Mike is also happy, I'll let him set a positive review!

There has been a discussion about the usage of "assert" and you should not use "assert" for bad user input, only to check for actual bugs. Bad input should probably give a `ValueError` instead.

If there is any way at all to reproduce an `AssertionError` using documented public functions, that is by definition a bug.

Hi Jeroen,
There are a few '`assert`' lines that we can clearly remove and change to `ValueError`, but there is one I am unsure about.  Around line 599 in k_dual.py we have

```
if isinstance(c, Partition_class): 
      assert len(rest) == 0 
```
I don't see how to trigger this.  Is it ok to leave it as is?

Some of our assertion errors that appear are triggered in code in free_module.py.  Should I change that code here or open a new ticket?

Absolutely. This is how `assert` should be used: to say "this condition is always true, without any further assumptions".

I don't think you have to change it here, but at least make sure you don't introduce any new wrongly-used asserts.
