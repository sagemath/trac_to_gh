Hellooooooooo David !!

Here is a ... reviewer's patch `:-D`

You created a file containing a method "RingedTree", but you called it "families.py"... If we move all the stuff from graph_generators to families.py and other files, would you see a problem with putting Robert Miller's copyright from graph_generators.py at the head of families.py (and we will do the same at the head of the new files we will create) ? Otherwise it would be a bit like stealing the copyright just by moving the code around `^^;`

If you agree with the patch you can set the ticket to "positive review". And we will handle all that stuff when we will move the code around !

You have fully rewritten the function in a much smarter way. Thanks!
I was not aware of the circle embedding function. Nice.

You are perfectly right. We could may be already put his name and remove mine.

I agree with the patch. Many thanks.

Yeah !

It's perfect as it is `:-)`

By the way, I'm living in a shared flat right now, for something like a month or so. This way I can see what life is like in Paris, including the loooooong commuting toward Orsay.
