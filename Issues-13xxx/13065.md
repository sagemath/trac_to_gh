As well as the problem with the gp script, there are errors in the sage code which meant that the gp error didn't get reported as was intended:

At line 283 of `schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_number_field.py` (Sage-5.0):

```
    prob_rank = Integer(t[0]) 
```
`t` has the value `'fail'`, from the previous line.  But the error should have been detected earlier.  If lines 104--105 of `schemes/elliptic_curves/gp_simon.py`:

```
    if s.find("###") != -1:
        raise RuntimeError, "%s\nAn error occurred while running Simon's 2-descent program"%s
```
are changed to:

```
    if s.find("***") != -1:
        raise RuntimeError, "\n%s\nAn error occurred while running Simon's 2-descent program"%s
```
then:

```
sage: K = CyclotomicField(43).subfields(3)[0][0]
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K, '37')
sage: E.simon_two_descent()
Traceback (most recent call last):

There's another error at line 276 of `schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_number_field.py`, where a `KeyError` has to be allowed for as well as an `AttributeError`.  Thus trying `E.simon_two_descent()` again leads to

This just leaves adding a comment about the version of the scripts which cuase that error.

What then with this ticket?  I cannot exactly be closed since the error has not been fixed, just flagged better.  Perhaps the thing to do is to close this ticket but to open a similar one which refers back to this one.

Replying to [cremona](#comment%3A10):
> PS The full test worked without a hitch so perhaps I was unnecessarily cautious (about deleting the line which defines x).


It looks as though that line has been there from the beginning (sage-2.6).  

> This just leaves adding a comment about the version of the scripts which cause that error.


I've replaced the patch with one that refers to the version.

> What then with this ticket?  I cannot exactly be closed since the error has not been fixed, just flagged better.  Perhaps the thing to do is to close this ticket but to open a similar one which refers back to this one.


Seems like a good idea.  From the point of view of Sage, the error was in the implementation of reporting errors in the script(s) (plus one or two other things).  A new ticket could (re-)document the upstream report.
