Execute the following in a Sage 5.5 notebook cell:

```python
class Test(SageObject):
    """
    TESTS::
        
        sage: #define a test class
        sage: class SubTest(SageObject):
        ...       def somefunc(self):
        ...          print self.blubb 
    """
    pass
```

In the next cell execute "`Test?`". You'll find that "`print self.blubb`" has been changed to "`print Test.blubb`".

Somehow I cannot reproduce this from the command line, neither directly nor using a temporary file via "ed". But the line that you pointed out definitely seems to be the culprit.

I managed to find an example of this problem "in the wild": if you ask for `CombinatorialFreeModule.__init__?` in a notebook cell you get (somewhere in the middle)

```python
sage: class MyAlgebra(CombinatorialFreeModule):
...       def _repr_(self):
...           return "MyAlgebra on %s"%(CombinatorialFreeModule.basis().keys())
...       def product_on_basis(self,i,j):
...           pass
```

Here "`CombinatorialFreeModule.basis().keys()`" should really be "`self.basis().keys()`".

Here are two cases where the substitution of "self" to "objname" is probably desired; note that both contain instances of "`self`", but only "`self.`" is substituted. So the current substitution mechanism is already a little bit broken:

```python
Z = random_matrix(GF(2),10,10)
Z.rows?
```

```python
U=RIF(1, 2)
U.diameter?
```
There are plenty of cases where the substitution is probably **not** desired. Such cases can be found with 

```
grep -irn "\.\.\..*self\." devel/sage/sage/*/*py*
```
For example

```python
sage: sage.structure.parent?
```
shows 

```python
sage: class A_class(Parent):
...     def __init__(self, name):
...         Parent.__init__(self, name=name)
...         sage._populate_coercion_lists_()
...         sage.rename(name)
```
(note the substitution "`self.`" -> "`sage.`").

I would suggest to

* remove the automatic substitution "`self.`" -> "`obj_name.`"
* introduce a new substitution "`OBJNAME`" -> "`obj_name`" and use "`self`" as default object name if none is provided.

This way we would still support dynamic object name replacement, but the replacement would be restricted to those cases where the docstring author explicitly asked for it.

Keep in mind that the substitution code is not run on the command line, so

```
sage: Z = random_matrix(GF(2),10,10)
sage: Z.rows?
```
does not produce docs with the substitution performed. That documentation would suffer from the use of `OBJNAME` rather than `self` (since `self` does have a meaning in that context). I think removing the automatic substitution is a good idea (because it's so hard to decide when it is desirable and when not), but I'm not so sure introducing a more technical alternative is worth it.
