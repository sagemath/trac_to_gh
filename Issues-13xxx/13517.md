a feature request:  Voronoi diagrams, see [https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/JgqyInSu8S8/discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/JgqyInSu8S8/discussion)

A list of things that could be included in an implementation of Voronoi diagrams could be:

* the graph structure of the Voronoi diagram and it's dual, the Delaunay triangulation
* generalizations
  * Voronoi diagrams with weights (possibly empty regions!)
  * Voronoi diagrams with respect to other metrics (regions not necessary convex Polyhedra anymore)
  * farthest points Voronoi diagrams
* a closest pair method for the list of points/ nearest neighbor
* a plotting routine in 2d and 3d

Perhaps in the file sage/geometry/triangulation/point_configuration.py

The patch is correct ;-)

You should format the examples in the docstring as in http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#docstring-markup-with-rest-and-sphinx, then they become tests that you can run with `sage -t sage/geometry/voroni_diagram.py`.

If you want to lay the path for more functionality you should create a class that holds the initial data (the points) and caches the polyhedral cells. Then other methods, for example a `plot()` method, can be easily added without having to pass lists of polyhedra around.

Also you don't have to hard-code floating-point doubles as the ring, you could allow exact rationals at the same time. This requires you to figure out what a good ring for the input points is, of course. You could just put them into a `PointConfiguration` and use

```
sage: pc = PointConfiguration([(1,2), (1,2/3)])
sage: pc.base_ring()
Rational Field
sage: pc = PointConfiguration([(1,2), (1,0.3)])
sage: pc.base_ring()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```

Thanks for the work, i think it is a nice addition.

A couple of comments though.

-I don't understand why your patch adds the file voronoi_diagram.py.out. Is that made on purpose or is it a mistake?

thanks for looking at the file.

* the file voronoi_diagram.py.out was indeed a mistake, the new patch does not include that file.

* I introduced a self._base_ring variable to handle QQ and RDF depending on input, as you suggested. (Now if the base_ring of the PointConfiguration is a subring of the rationals, it uses QQ, otherwise RDF)

I don't see how one could easily adapt the algorithm for algebraic extensions of QQ for the following reason: 
 The Polyhedron-method only works with QQ and RDF. 

If you really want support for extensions of QQ, either the algorithm of finding the Voronoi-diagram has to be changed, or one has adapt the Polyhedron method. Both are nontrivial tasks, which might make a good upgrade later on.

Hellooooooooooooo !!

Just thought I would add a link toward d3.js here. It's a javascript library that can be used to plot a lot of things, and there's an example of a Voronoi Diagram on its website :

http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060366

I wrote a patch (#14953) that uses this library to draw graphs `:-)`

I adressed the comments made by mmarco: The class now handles all the input (QQ, RDF and AA) that polyhedron can take as input.

As for the comments by kcrisman and ncohen: There are certainly much faster methods to calculate the voronoi diagram and the delaunay triangulation; I just wanted to put forward a first working version, that is conceptually clear and can be improved later. 

Two things that could easily be added are plotting in the 3d case and adding a function to the point-configuration class giving back the voronoi-diagram.

All tests pass on 7.6.b4.

Running:

sage -t --warn-long src/sage/geometry/voronoi_diagram.py

The test on line 49:

DV = voronoi_diagram([[AA(c) for c in v] for v in polytopes.dodecahedron().vertices_list()]); DV

was flagged as long on my machine; it took around 4-5 sec. in average, but if you tell me that it is not flagged on a newer machine, then I guess it is okay.

I would put the "TODOs" in the description of the ticket inside the file in the doc, so that it is not only to be found here. (Similar as EXAMPLES and TESTS).

In the examples for plot, the backslash produces a series of spaces to align the newlines when typing .plot? . I would remove that unless it is desired...

Otherwise, it looks good to me.

Could you change the description of the ticket also to include the TODO?

There is a second ":" missing after the examples of the class. Otherwise, it looks okay.

All tests pass on 7.6.beta6.

The doc does not build: There is a double colon on line 16.

Otherwise, it looks good to me. Once you fixed it, you can put a positive review on my behalf.

Dear Moritz,

The doc folder geometry is renamed in #22496. I guess it would make sense to make a dependancy on this ticket to avoid to have to add it and then have to move it.

What do you think?

So more comments:

- The reference should be put in the file `SAGE_ROOT/src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst`
- In .plot() there are 2 lines after the `INPUT`
- When there is an optional parameter, the syntax should be something like

  ` - p -- (default: 2) a positive prime integer`

In order to scan through the python conventions, you can use a pep8 plugin to scan your file for such things

Salut Moritz,

Some last comments (hopefully):

- Spacing after commas in the examples will make reading easier
- Input of plot: there is an "8" at the end of a line

Then let's see if the doc builds and it could be merged after #22496.

Hi Moritz,

Well, all right, then the ticket #22496 will depend on this one. That's why I was asking if it was okay to put the dependency on this one.

Anyhow, that's not important.

Hi Moritz,

There is a doctest failure:

```

File "voronoi_diagram.py", line 197, in sage.geometry.voronoi_diagram.VoronoiDiagram.regions
Failed example:
    V = VoronoiDiagram([[1, 3, .3], [2, -2, 1], [-1, 2, -.1]]); V.regions()
Expected:

    P(2.00000000000000, -2.00000000000000, 1.00000000000000): A 3-dimensional polyhedron in RDF^3 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex, 2 rays, 1 line,
    P(-1.00000000000000, 2.00000000000000, -0.100000000000000): A 3-dimensional polyhedron in RDF^3 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex, 2 rays, 1 line}
Got:
    {P(1.00000000000000, 3.00000000000000, 0.300000000000000): A 3-dimensional polyhedron in RDF^3 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex, 2 rays, 1 line,
     P(-1.00000000000000, 2.00000000000000, -0.100000000000000): A 3-dimensional polyhedron in RDF^3 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex, 2 rays, 1 line,
     P(2.00000000000000, -2.00000000000000, 1.00000000000000): A 3-dimensional polyhedron in RDF^3 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex, 2 rays, 1 line}
**********************************************************************

```

I guess the output should fix the order. Or change the doctest.
