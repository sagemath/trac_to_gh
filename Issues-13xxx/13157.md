```
%fortran

Umm, there is something really odd here.  The flags passed seem to indicate something went quite wrong.  For instance, one bit is

```
/var/folders/f4/881mfg491yxdf3zx37ynf5580000gn/T/tmpSLdvBd/Users/bael/.sage/temp/Baels_MacBook_Air.local/2689/tmp_0.o -LUsing built-in specs.

```
What the heck?

```
-LUsing built-in specs. COLLECT_GCC=gfortran 
```
No wonder the errors look like

```
gfortran: error: built-in: No such file or directory
gfortran: error: specs.: No such file or directory
gfortran: error: COLLECT_GCC=gfortran: No such file or directory
```
I don't know how that verbiage got passed there, though.

Anyway, since

```
/Users/bael/sage/sage-5.0.1/local/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0/4.6.3" -lgfortran -o ./fortran_module_0.so" failed with exit status 1
```
that means it's no surprise that at the end

```
    os.unlink(name + '.so')
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'fortran_module_0.so'
```
though that is just a symptom.

Does ticket:8010:attachment:trac-8010_numpy.patch (sorry, can't get the link right) look like it might solve it for you, just on the off chance?  One would have to make a new spkg, of course.  But the patch was never applied, to my knowledge.

Wait, there is no `sage_fortran` any more, so that doesn't make sense to apply anyway.  And the [current numpy code](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/numpy/distutils/fcompiler/gnu.py#L73) has

```
'linker_so'    : [None, "-g", "-Wall"],
```
so the `shared` business can't be the issue, or at least not in exactly the same way.

I can also confirm that this is not just a Lion issue; the same happens on 10.6.

This works fine on OS X now.  The code changes are minimal and make sense - nice error test.  I only tested this on OS X 10.7, not previous systems; I guess someone should test this doesn't break anything on Linux, and take jdemeyer's word for it on OpenSolaris.

Any reason for the change of standard error to standard output instead of the previous vice versa?  It does seem more natural given the names of the terms, but I'm not a bash expert...

The redirection

```
1>&2 >foo
```
is equivalent to

```
>foo
```
It's like saying: redirect stdout to stderr.  Oh, never mind, redirect it to `foo` instead.  This doesn't really make sense, so I assume it's a mistake.

While

```
>foo 2>&1
```
means: redirect stdout to `foo`.  Now redirect stderr to the **new** stdout, which is `foo`.  This therefore redirects both stdout and stderr to `foo`.

*Off topic and just for educational value*: the redirection

```
2>&1 >foo
```
would mean: redirect stderr to the **current** stdout.  Now redirect stdout (but not stderr) to `foo`.
