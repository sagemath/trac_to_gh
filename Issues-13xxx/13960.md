On my Windows 7 x64 install of 5.6.rc0 I get segfaults in nef.x.

After rebuilding with CFLAGS="-g -O0" I get the following backtrace

```
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

To fix this, we need to specify the stack size explicitly on Cygwin. This is done in the updated spkg.

It seems the stack is too small.
Recompiling with CFLAGS including -Wl,--stack,10000000 (so 10MB) makes the crash disappear.
I guess the best solution would to malloc the problematic stuff on the heap.

Is that on purpose?
