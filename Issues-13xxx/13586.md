```
From [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1843/weird-behavior-builtinfunction):

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.function import BuiltinFunction
sage: class AFunction(BuiltinFunction):                            
....:         def __init__(self, name, exp=1):
....:             self.exponent=exp
....:         BuiltinFunction.__init__(self, name, nargs=1)
....:     def _eval_(self, arg):
....:             return arg**self.exponent
....: 
sage: p2 = AFunction('p2', 2)
sage: p2(x)                  
x^2
sage: p3 = AFunction('p3', 3)
sage: p3(x)                  
x^2
```

ATM, we only allow a `BuiltinFunction` to be instantiated once.

Nice work, Burcin.  I guess this doesn't stop someone from doing

```
sage: p4 = AFunction('p2',3)
```
but I suppose that is the user's problem, since they are redefining the name `p2`.  Similarly, is this (new behavior, I think) ok?  I think so, but just want to make sure.

```
sage: class MyFunction(BuiltinFunction):
....:     def __init__(self,name):
....:         self.exponent=1
....:         BuiltinFunction.__init__(self,name,nargs=1)
....:     def _eval_(self,arg):
....:         return arg**self.exponent
....:     
sage: MyFunction('p')
p
sage: p = MyFunction('p')
sage: p
p
sage: p(2)
2
sage: p(3)
3
sage: q = MyFunction('q')
sage: q(3)
3
sage: p
p
sage: q
q

No, it's just that you said "ATM, we only allow a BuiltinFunction to be instantiated once."  Whereas now it can be instantiated more than once with or without different arguments etc.  Probably this is ok, I just wanted to be sure.  No problem.
