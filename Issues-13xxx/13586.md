From [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1843/weird-behavior-builtinfunction):

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.function import BuiltinFunction
sage: class AFunction(BuiltinFunction):                            
....:         def __init__(self, name, exp=1):
....:             self.exponent=exp
....:         BuiltinFunction.__init__(self, name, nargs=1)
....:     def _eval_(self, arg):
....:             return arg**self.exponent
....: 
sage: p2 = AFunction('p2', 2)
sage: p2(x)                  
x^2
sage: p3 = AFunction('p3', 3)
sage: p3(x)                  
x^2
```

ATM, we only allow a `BuiltinFunction` to be instantiated once.
