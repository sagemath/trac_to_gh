This tickets addresses the fact that Jeroen is not happy with the length of `graph_generators.py` `:-P`

It splits the file into new ones, added in the graph/generators/ folder, according to the classifiation of the methods that appears in the module's documentation.

This patch creates the following files and moves into them the methods from `GraphGenerator` that are associated to it in the list at the top of the graph_generators module documentation.

* basic.py
* degree_sequence.py
* families.py
* platonic_solids.py
* random.py
* smallgraphs.py
* world_map.py

This patch passes all tests, but is not clean yet and lacks documentations. Others will follow.

Some work on the doc is still needed.

What this patch does ([attachment:trac_13862-code_reformatting.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13862/trac_13862-code_reformatting.patch)):

* Removes all occurrences to `self`, as the former methods are now functions and belong to no class.
* Adds a line of doc to all new files, saying that their documentation actually appears in graph_generators

Lots of code formatting `:-P`

(only one patch left)

Hello,

the long tests fail on families.py

```
**********************************************************************
File "/path-to-sage/sage-5.6.beta0/devel/sage-myclone/sage/graphs/generators/families.py", line 1815:
    sage: G = graphs.RingedTree(5)
Exception raised:

        from sage.graphs.graph_plot import GraphGenerators

```

I have run tests only on the graph directory. I don't know if this patch could impact other modules.

Also, you should add possible dependencies with other patches e.g., #13809.

For me the patch is good to go!

I have added the dependency to the patch description.

This is definitely a huge patch, but it has to be done. Good job.
