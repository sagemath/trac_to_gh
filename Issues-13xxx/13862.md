This patch creates the following files and moves into them the methods from `GraphGenerator` that are associated to it in the list at the top of the graph_generators module documentation.

* basic.py
* degree_sequence.py
* families.py
* platonic_solids.py
* random.py
* smallgraphs.py
* world_map.py

This patch passes all tests, but is not clean yet and lacks documentations. Others will follow.

* Moves `_circle_embedding` and `_line_embedding` to `graph_plot.py`. These methods are now imported at the beginning of generators/* modules that need need.

* Moves `IntervalGraph` to families. This one was not liste among the "families", which is why it was still in `graph_generators.py` after the first patch.
* Adds the Nauru Graph to the list of small graphs.

Some work on the doc is still needed.

```

I have run tests only on the graph directory. I don't know if this patch could impact other modules.

Also, you should add possible dependencies with other patches e.g., #13809.

Install OK, doctest OK including long tests, and docbuild OK. 
For me the patch is good to go!

I have added the dependency to the patch description.

This is definitely a huge patch, but it has to be done. Good job.
