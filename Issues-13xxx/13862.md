This tickets addresses the fact that Jeroen is not happy with the length of `graph_generators.py` `:-P`

It splits the file into new ones, added in the graph/generators/ folder, according to the classifiation of the methods that appears in the module's documentation.

This patch creates the following files and moves into them the methods from `GraphGenerator` that are associated to it in the list at the top of the graph_generators module documentation.

* basic.py
* degree_sequence.py
* families.py
* platonic_solids.py
* random.py
* smallgraphs.py
* world_map.py

This patch passes all tests, but is not clean yet and lacks documentations. Others will follow.

What this additional ([attachment:trac_13862-cleaning_and_moving.patch]) patch does :
* Moves `_circle_embedding` and `_line_embedding` to `graph_plot.py`. These methods are now imported at the beginning of generators/* modules that need need.
* Removes LCFGraph from the list of basc graphs (this methods creates a family of graphs). It was already in the list of "families" graphs.
* Moves the Harary Graph to the "families" file. Same thing here : there are many Harary graphs.
* Moves `DorogovtsevGoltsevMendesGraph` to `families.py`. Not worth creating an independent "pseudofractal" module at the moment.
* Moves `IntervalGraph` to families. This one was not liste among the "families", which is why it was still in `graph_generators.py` after the first patch.
* Adds the Nauru Graph to the list of small graphs.

Some work on the doc is still needed.

What this new patch ([attachment:trac_13862-doc.patch]) does :
* Moves the "Usage" part of the graph_generators module's doc to graph_plot, as it explains how graphs are displayed.
* *HEAVY* rewrite of the fuctions lists at the top of graph_generators. Now the methods are listed in 3xN tables, so that they are easier to browse. This required to define an (ugly) helper function in `graph_generators.py`. But the lists at the top of that file are now easier to read (both in html and in `sage.graphs.graph_generators?`) and easier to update (just add a string in a list).
* `NauruGraph` isadded to the list of small graphs

This patch's almost ready.

I have run tests only on the graph directory. I don't know if this patch could impact other modules.

Also, you should add possible dependencies with other patches e.g., #13809.

Install OK, doctest OK including long tests, and docbuild OK. 
For me the patch is good to go!

I have added the dependency to the patch description.

This is definitely a huge patch, but it has to be done. Good job.
