What this additional ([attachment:trac_13862-cleaning_and_moving.patch]) patch does :
* Moves `_circle_embedding` and `_line_embedding` to `graph_plot.py`. These methods are now imported at the beginning of generators/* modules that need need.
* Removes LCFGraph from the list of basc graphs (this methods creates a family of graphs). It was already in the list of "families" graphs.
* Moves the Harary Graph to the "families" file. Same thing here : there are many Harary graphs.
* Moves `DorogovtsevGoltsevMendesGraph` to `families.py`. Not worth creating an independent "pseudofractal" module at the moment.
* Moves `IntervalGraph` to families. This one was not liste among the "families", which is why it was still in `graph_generators.py` after the first patch.
* Adds the Nauru Graph to the list of small graphs.

Some work on the doc is still needed.
