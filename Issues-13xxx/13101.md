sage: enumerate_totallyreal_fields_all(8, 10^8)

The fix is easy: we just need to add the lines

```
    if len(z4minmax) < 1: 
        z4minmax = [0.0, -1.0]
    return z4minmax
```

before line 295 of sage/rings/number_field/totallyreal_data.pyx.  (Yes, I'm still intimidated by creating a patch.)  

The issue was that when the lagrange multipliers gives contradictory bounds (a good thing, since it says the enumeration can stop in that branch), it was not sending a pair of bounds, just a single element, causing a type error.

Did someone add

```

to the doctest?  This was just an example that caused the stupid bug and I don't think it was ever intended for a doctest.  But then we also probably want to keep it for future testing purposes, right?  

There is an easy doctest in there already

```
enumerate_totallyreal_fields_rel(F, 2, 2000)
