The fix is easy: we just need to add the lines

```
    if len(z4minmax) < 1: 
        z4minmax = [0.0, -1.0]
    return z4minmax
```

before line 295 of sage/rings/number_field/totallyreal_data.pyx.  (Yes, I'm still intimidated by creating a patch.)  

The issue was that when the lagrange multipliers gives contradictory bounds (a good thing, since it says the enumeration can stop in that branch), it was not sending a pair of bounds, just a single element, causing a type error.
