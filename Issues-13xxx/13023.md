Currently all files related to toric varieties are in `schemes/generic`, yet there are many of them and it would be more convenient to have a separate folder rather than `toric_` prefix on all of them.

The patchbot fails due to:

Trailing whitespace inserted on 5 non-empty lines.
Traceback (most recent call last):

but when I manually did "sage -br", everything did work fine, hence the positive review.
