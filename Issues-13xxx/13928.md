My computer has no processor, and that's because `sage -tp 4` refuses to test any file whose path contains the string `"/."`. That's a problem, for on my machine `SAGE_ROOT=/home/ncohen/.Sage` and all files get filtered. This patch removes this test, hoping that it was totally useless in the first place, which sounds.... unlikely `O_o`

```
~/sage/sage/graphs$ sage -tp 4 .

Here is a patch using John's code.... Leif do you really find adequate that `make ptestlong` does not work when I install Sage ? `O_o`
As John I really do not get why all filenames containing `/.` should be filtered. But it's clearly a problem for me if I have to install Sage in my home directory, in a .Sage subfolder, and find out that I am unable to test Sage's code in parallel !

Well, rename the folder to something not starting with a dot, then run `sage -tp ...` or `make ptest[long]` or whatever... ;-)

The exception raised if no files to test remain should get fixed though, giving a reasonable message instead.  [We could also issue a warning (once!) if `SAGE_ROOT` or some specified directory's path contains a hidden directory.]

Create some [visible] subdirectory that contains all the stuff that you don't want to see?

(On [other people's] Windows for example, the first thing I usually do is to create a `Deskbottom` folder, to move the useless things to... :-) )

I'm not sure what you mean by that.  Of course RCSs' directories can be located anywhere, not just below `SAGE_ROOT`, and even for the latter aren't necessarily [just] Mercurial's `.hg` directories.

Sounds good to me.

> Anyway, your current patch is fragile and not an improvement (other than that it apparently fixes your particular problem). Any time you require a `realpath` you're probably doing something wrong.

I agree about using the path as presented by the user. Note though that `realpath` is used several other places in the file, for example line 308:

```
if os.path.realpath(appendstr).startswith(BUILD_DIR):
```
where `BUILD_DIR` was also defined using `realpath`. So if it's problematic, other parts of the file need to be fixed (as does the [Python documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/library/os.path.html?highlight=realpath#os.path.realpath), unless they're using the word "canonical" in a, ahem, noncanonical way). Or they don't need to be fixed, and they might produce false positives: some files will get tested which perhaps shouldn't.

I think he means, what's wrong with just filtering subdirectories of `SAGE_ROOT` (and its subdirectories) which start with `.`? This would be consistent with Nils' suggestion.

`O_o`

It's my home folder. Not Sage's. It's there because I invited it, but it's not about to make rules there `:-P`

Well, I'd say it's even *more likely* that the tree(s) contain(s) (e.g.) `.svn` or `.git` directories if someone tests files *outside* `SAGE_ROOT`.  Feeding `sage -t ...` with complex <code>\`find ... -prune ...\`</code> expressions is certainly pretty inconvenient.

We could of course introduce yet another Sage environment variable containing the directory names to skip... ;-)
[and only skip them if they're really *below* the directories specified, as Nils suggested.]

Hi Nathann,

It looks like this will be superseded by the work at #12415: at least, the patches there completely remove the file sage-ptest. So I think we should close this and you should take the discussion there. Note that there has been a lot of activity on that ticket lately – it has not stagnated – and putting in a patch here would just cause them to rebase. Also, they may still be ignoring paths containing "/.", so you should intervene if you want that changed.
