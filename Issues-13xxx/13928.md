My computer has no processor, and that's because `sage -tp 4` refuses to test any file whose path contains the string `"/."`. That's a problem, for on my machine `SAGE_ROOT=/home/ncohen/.Sage` and all files get filtered. This patch removes this test, hoping that it was totally useless in the first place, which sounds.... unlikely `O_o`

```
~/sage/sage/graphs$ sage -tp 4 .

That's not a bug (skipping files in directories starting with `.`), but a feature.

The real bug is the exception raised (if no files to test remain).  But we should probably report *why* (or *that*) such files get skipped, or (because there can potentially be many) at least document this somewhere (if it isn't already; a comment in `sage-ptest` would probably have sufficed in your case... ;-) )

Here is a patch using John's code.... Leif do you really find adequate that `make ptestlong` does not work when I install Sage ? `O_o`
As John I really do not get why all filenames containing `/.` should be filtered. But it's clearly a problem for me if I have to install Sage in my home directory, in a .Sage subfolder, and find out that I am unable to test Sage's code in parallel !

At least the one who implemented it knows, and others would perhaps be surprised if we didn't.

I thought it was obvious, but we don't want to hardcode the various names of the hidden directories of revision control systems.

I use a computer on which I am not root, I can only write stuff to my home directory, and I have many things to install. So I don't want to see then when I do "ls" in my home directory. Happened to me thousands of times.

Then what's the problem with filtering the `/.` that appear in SAGE_ROOT ?

Perhaps there's a middle way that satisfies both leif and nathan: I can see why filenames starting with a "." should be skipped during discovery and recursion, but if a dotted filename gets explicitly included in the pathname, the user is clearly asking for testing that file, so why not?

Compare the behaviour of `ls -R <path name>`, for instance. It won't list/recurse into any dotted files *within* `<path name>`, but it will happily work if any of the components of `<path name>` have a dot in them.

I don't know where/how `make ptest` gets a list of to-be-tested files, but I'd think that you want to filter out dotted files there (i.e., when you're discovering new leafs/nodes), rather than when you've assembled a full path name already. That basically means: let `populatefilelist` do the hard work, not `skip` (in fact, shouldn't everything of skip be absorbed in there?)

(But really ... why *would* you want to install software in a dotted directory? Do you want to hide it from your sysadmin?)

Anyway, your current patch is fragile and not an improvement (other than that it apparently fixes your particular problem). Any time you require a `realpath` you're probably doing something wrong. It's a very expensive operation and it's fragile. You should really work with file paths as presented to you. The user probably had a reason for presenting the path to you in the way he/she did.

Create some [visible] subdirectory that contains all the stuff that you don't want to see?

(On [other people's] Windows for example, the first thing I usually do is to create a `Deskbottom` folder, to move the useless things to... :-) )

I'm not sure what you mean by that.  Of course RCSs' directories can be located anywhere, not just below `SAGE_ROOT`, and even for the latter aren't necessarily [just] Mercurial's `.hg` directories.

Sounds good to me.

> Anyway, your current patch is fragile and not an improvement (other than that it apparently fixes your particular problem). Any time you require a `realpath` you're probably doing something wrong. It's a very expensive operation and it's fragile. You should really work with file paths as presented to you. The user probably had a reason for presenting the path to you in the way he/she did.

I agree about using the path as presented by the user. Note though that `realpath` is used several other places in the file, for example line 308:

```
if os.path.realpath(appendstr).startswith(BUILD_DIR):
```
where `BUILD_DIR` was also defined using `realpath`. So if it's problematic, other parts of the file need to be fixed (as does the [Python documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/library/os.path.html?highlight=realpath#os.path.realpath), unless they're using the word "canonical" in a, ahem, noncanonical way). Or they don't need to be fixed, and they might produce false positives: some files will get tested which perhaps shouldn't.

I think he means, what's wrong with just filtering subdirectories of `SAGE_ROOT` (and its subdirectories) which start with `.`? This would be consistent with Nils' suggestion.

`O_o`

It's my home folder. Not Sage's. It's there because I invited it, but it's not about to make rules there `:-P`

> I'm not sure what you mean by that.  Of course RCSs' directories can be located anywhere, not just below `SAGE_ROOT`, and even for the latter aren't necessarily [just] Mercurial's `.hg` directories.

P.S.:  From a mathematical perspective, one should still print "All tests passed!" of course.

That is absolutely untrue. You're probably refering to #5852, but that was about *fixing* the way *how* `sage` resolves symbolic links. I never made the decision to resolve all symbolic links in `SAGE_ROOT`.

Well, we used `realpath()` and the like in a few places (mostly to check whether two filenames actually refer to the same file), but never fully "expanded" `SAGE_ROOT` "from the beginning", i.e., in the main `sage` script.  I recall you implemented the latter, so it's IMHO fair to say (or assume) you were in favour of doing so...

```
SAGE_ROOT=`realpath    "$0" 2> /dev/null` || \

Hi Nathann,

It looks like this will be superseded by the work at #12415: at least, the patches there completely remove the file sage-ptest. So I think we should close this and you should take the discussion there. Note that there has been a lot of activity on that ticket lately – it has not stagnated – and putting in a patch here would just cause them to rebase. Also, they may still be ignoring paths containing "/.", so you should intervene if you want that changed.

Okay, I was wrong. It looks like #12415 will ignore files in directories starting with "." within the Sage library, but they will have no problem testing files if the entire Sage directory is contained in "/home/user/.Sage/...". So I propose we don't work further on this ticket and just wait for #12415 (or help with it, if that's possible).
