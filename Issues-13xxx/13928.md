My computer has no processor, and that's because `sage -tp 4` refuses to test any file whose path contains the string `"/."`. That's a problem, for on my machine `SAGE_ROOT=/home/ncohen/.Sage` and all files get filtered. This patch removes this test, hoping that it was totally useless in the first place, which sounds.... unlikely `O_o`

```
~/sage/sage/graphs$ sage -tp 4 .

Here is a patch using John's code.... Leif do you really find adequate that `make ptestlong` does not work when I install Sage ? `O_o`
As John I really do not get why all filenames containing `/.` should be filtered. But it's clearly a problem for me if I have to install Sage in my home directory, in a .Sage subfolder, and find out that I am unable to test Sage's code in parallel !

Well, rename the folder to something not starting with a dot, then run `sage -tp ...` or `make ptest[long]` or whatever... ;-)

The exception raised if no files to test remain should get fixed though, giving a reasonable message instead.  [We could also issue a warning (once!) if `SAGE_ROOT` or some specified directory's path contains a hidden directory.]

Create some [visible] subdirectory that contains all the stuff that you don't want to see?

(On [other people's] Windows for example, the first thing I usually do is to create a `Deskbottom` folder, to move the useless things to... :-) )

I'm not sure what you mean by that.  Of course RCSs' directories can be located anywhere, not just below `SAGE_ROOT`, and even for the latter aren't necessarily [just] Mercurial's `.hg` directories.

Sounds good to me.

> Anyway, your current patch is fragile and not an improvement (other than that it apparently fixes your particular problem). Any time you require a `realpath` you're probably doing something wrong.

I agree about using the path as presented by the user. Note though that `realpath` is used several other places in the file, for example line 308:

```
if os.path.realpath(appendstr).startswith(BUILD_DIR):
```
where `BUILD_DIR` was also defined using `realpath`.

I think he means, what's wrong with just filtering subdirectories of `SAGE_ROOT` (and its subdirectories) which start with `.`? This would be consistent with Nils' suggestion.

`O_o`

Well, I'd say it's even *more likely* that the tree(s) contain(s) (e.g.) `.svn` or `.git` directories if someone tests files *outside* `SAGE_ROOT`.  Feeding `sage -t ...` with complex <code>\`find ... -prune ...\`</code> expressions is certainly pretty inconvenient.

We could of course introduce yet another Sage environment variable containing the directory names to skip... ;-)
[and only skip them if they're really *below* the directories specified, as Nils suggested.]

Attached rationalized pruning patch. This walks the dirtree more efficiently, because it won't even descend into dotted names. It's also agnostic of the pathname on which it starts, so if dots are present there, things should still work.

Hi Nathann,

It looks like this will be superseded by the work at #12415: at least, the patches there completely remove the file sage-ptest. So I think we should close this and you should take the discussion there. Note that there has been a lot of activity on that ticket lately – it has not stagnated – and putting in a patch here would just cause them to rebase. Also, they may still be ignoring paths containing "/.", so you should intervene if you want that changed.

Okay, I was wrong.

So I propose we don't work further on this ticket and just wait for #12415 (or help with it, if that's possible).
