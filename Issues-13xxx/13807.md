In #13579, for security reasons and modularity, we moved temporary filename constructors from `sage.misc.misc` to their own module.  Most things were moved with it, but [a](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/33242a07d2ab/sage/plot/animate.py#l557) [couple](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/33242a07d2ab/sage/plot/animate.py#l381) places in animate.py were missed.  Let's make sure that **all** such things, including these, are fixed in this ticket.

See [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2065/module-object-has-no-attribute-graphics_filename) for a real-life bug this caused.

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

The file sage/misc/misc.py has a line

```
from sage.misc.temporary_file import tmp_dir, tmp_filename, delete_tmpfiles
```
so I think that `sage.misc.misc.tmp_filename` should work, and the same for `tmp_dir`. For example, `coding/linear_code.py` has a function `code2leon` with the lines

```
    from sage.misc.misc import tmp_filename
    ...
    file_loc = tmp_filename()
```
and it seems to work fine. So I think we only need to fix the `graphics_filename` issue. One way to do it:

```diff

Incidentally, ran into the `sage -n` not starting while testing this... so I'm glad that will be fixed before the final 5.5, right?

I've added a doctest (not a perfect one, but the best I can think of) in matrix_modn_sparse.pyx. I don't think it's possible to add a doctest to animate.py, since those require ImageMagick or similar to run.

For the `sage -n` problem, see #13794. I think the scripts patch at #11409 will fix it.

This makes sense, but unfortunately it doesn't actually show up in the notebook.

Actually, this must be a really old function, since `matrix_plot` does what we want here.  `hg blame` tells me it's an addition by malb from **2007**!
> I don't think it's possible to add a doctest to animate.py, since those require ImageMagick or similar to run.

Sounds reasonable, as I suspected but hoped against.

Sorry about asking the matrix notebook question.  I hate it when we discover bugs or unneeded functionality when trying to do very routine fixes.  I'd be tempted to just can the function entirely, except there's the deprecation period and we should probably ask Martin if  it's needed...
