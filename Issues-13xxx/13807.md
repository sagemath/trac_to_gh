In #13579, for security reasons and modularity, we moved temporary filename constructors from `sage.misc.misc` to their own module.  Most things were moved with it, but [a](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/33242a07d2ab/sage/plot/animate.py#l557) [couple](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/33242a07d2ab/sage/plot/animate.py#l381) places in animate.py were missed.  Let's make sure that **all** such things, including these, are fixed in this ticket.

The file sage/misc/misc.py has a line

```

so I think that `sage.misc.misc.tmp_filename` should work, and the same for `tmp_dir`. For example, `coding/linear_code.py` has a function `code2leon` with the lines

and it seems to work fine. So I think we only need to fix the `graphics_filename` issue. One way to do it:

Agreed.  This patch is fine, modulo the next comment.

This could have been caught if we had a way to enable [this currently untested doctest](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/33242a07d2ab/sage/plot/animate.py#l336).  The same problem in the matrix file - it's precisely when we *don't* pass in the filename that this branch of the code happens... sigh.  Of course, that function is completely untested.  

Can you think of any way to get around that and add a doctest to this patch, or is it hopeless without doing some pointless refactoring of code?  William is *very* clear about not wanting to leave random files around... maybe we could at least doctest the matrix one and then remove that file?  We've tried to get away from ad hoc file creation and removal, but in this case I think that's the only way to do it right.

Incidentally, ran into the `sage -n` not starting while testing this... so I'm glad that will be fixed before the final 5.5, right?

I've added a doctest (not a perfect one, but the best I can think of) in matrix_modn_sparse.pyx. I don't think it's possible to add a doctest to animate.py, since those require ImageMagick or similar to run.

For the `sage -n` problem, see #13794. I think the scripts patch at #11409 will fix it.

This makes sense, but unfortunately it doesn't actually show up in the notebook.  In fact, even at the command line it shows up in the current working directory, which is *not* standard Sage behavior for graphics, though it is the documented behavior.  My personal preference would be to have it changed, but that wouldn't be this ticket.  What do you think the "right" behavior should be for the notebook and `EMBEDDED_MODE`?  Not that I'm angling for a line for that situation, but it would be nice to have.

Actually, this must be a really old function, since `matrix_plot` does what we want here.  `hg blame` tells me it's an addition by malb from **2007**!
> I don't think it's possible to add a doctest to animate.py, since those require ImageMagick or similar to run.

Sounds reasonable, as I suspected but hoped against.

Sorry about asking the matrix notebook question.  I hate it when we discover bugs or unneeded functionality when trying to do very routine fixes.  I'd be tempted to just can the function entirely, except there's the deprecation period and we should probably ask Martin if  it's needed...

Random annoyance this has nothing to do with.

Yes, I just couldn't remember the ticket numbers, I wasn't actually complaining.
