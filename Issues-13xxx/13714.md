On sage 5.5:

```
sage: R.<x1,x2> = QQ[]
sage: I = R.ideal(x2**2 + x1 - 2, x1**2 - 1)
sage: R.one().lift(I)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: polynomial is not in the ideal
```
And then the bug:

```
sage: I.complete_primary_decomposition()
// ** char_series returns 0 x 0 matrix from 3 input polys (0)
I[1,1]=x2^2+x1-2
I[1,2]=x1^2-1
```
and hangs forever (on sage 5.3 it just SEGFAULTed).

The key in this case is the **failing** call to `lift`, *i.e.*, evaluating `f.lift(I)` while `f` is not in `I`. What happens in this case has been changed by #13671 (but the problem in this ticket is independent). It was found while fixing #13671 that when computing `f.lift(I)`, then if `f` is not in `I` an error is raised by singular, by setting a global variable. Before #13671, this variable was not reset, and subsequent calls to `lift` would return junk. After #13671, the global variable is reset and `lift` works correctly. However, it was apparently not the end of the story.
