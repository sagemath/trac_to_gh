I observe this on two Linux Mint machines: one runs 11th version, another Debian Edition.

1. Compile sage-5.2.rc0.
2. Start it.
3. Start notebook either without parameters or to start remotely accessible secure server.
4. User registration is enabled (it was NOT before).
5. Turn it off in the settings and save.
6. It is indeed off.
7. Stop the server and start it again.
8. Use registration is enabled.

So what's the plan then?  Postpone the release of sage-5.2 and include #13121 or release sage-5.2 anyway and fix it in sage-5.3?

Considering this is a blocker, probably you should create a thread on sage-notebook asking for opinions.

I think it is some semi-trivial logic bug related to using None and False.
If in `sagenb/notebook/run_notebook.py` I change the line 224 from

```
             accounts      = None,
```
to 

```
             accounts      = False,
```
then  the setting for `Enable user registration` stays off, instead of staying on.
That is, when I start the notebook server, it is always `off` rather than `on`, and saving this option has
no effect. As opposed to the scenario described on the ticket, when it always stays on.

Well, anything other than `0.9.0` is fine as long as it shows that it is different from `0.9.0` since the upstream has a tag of 0.9.0 that points to a particular state of the sagenb.

What is the rationale behind the `.p?` suffix? Is it used only for bugfixes?

I have corrected the name to make it `sagenb-0.9.0.p0.spkg`.

Strictly speaking, one should have put the patch into the root subdirectory of spkg and fix spkg-install to apply it to the
pristine 0.9.0. Instead I just patched `src/sagenb` subdirectory of spkg.
As this is a one-time event, and in the future the releases of sagenb will be git-based, I hope it's OK.

Hi everyone, sorry for the delay in responding.

I cherry picked the commit Jason identified onto 0.9.0 and released a sagenb 0.9.1. SPKG is here: http://wstein.org/home/keshav/files/sagenb-0.9.1.spkg .
