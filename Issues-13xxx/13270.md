CC:  @kini @jasongrout

I observe this on two Linux Mint machines: one runs 11th version, another Debian Edition.

1. Compile sage-5.2.rc0.
2. Start it.
3. Start notebook either without parameters or to start remotely accessible secure server.
4. User registration is enabled (it was NOT before).
5. Turn it off in the settings and save.
6. It is indeed off.
7. Stop the server and start it again.
8. Use registration is enabled.

I wouldn't be so sure.  But maybe no one has an obvious fix.  You might want to email someone directly to ask where this might have changed in Github.  It does seems like a reasonable blocker, for the security issue.

So what's the plan then?  Postpone the release of sage-5.2 and include #13121 or release sage-5.2 anyway and fix it in sage-5.3?

Considering this is a blocker, probably you should create a thread on sage-notebook asking for opinions.

I think it is some semi-trivial logic bug related to using None and False.
If in `sagenb/notebook/run_notebook.py` I change the line 224 from

```
             accounts      = None,
```
to 

```
             accounts      = False,
```
then  the setting for `Enable user registration` stays off, instead of staying on.
That is, when I start the notebook server, it is always `off` rather than `on`, and saving this option has
no effect. As opposed to the scenario described on the ticket, when it always stays on.

how about just calling it `0.9.0.p0` ?

That seems very logical.

Well, anything other than `0.9.0` is fine as long as it shows that it is different from `0.9.0` since the upstream has a tag of 0.9.0 that points to a particular state of the sagenb.

What is the rationale behind the `.p?` suffix? Is it used only for bugfixes?

.p* stands for "patch level" or "patch".  It's a way of noting patches to upstream releases, and seems entirely appropriate here.

That way we don't have to backport the patch to 0.9.0 in the git tree.  Just apply the patch here "downstream".  It is already merged in the next release upstream.

I have corrected the name to make it `sagenb-0.9.0.p0.spkg`.

Strictly speaking, one should have put the patch into the root subdirectory of spkg and fix spkg-install to apply it to the
pristine 0.9.0. Instead I just patched `src/sagenb` subdirectory of spkg.
As this is a one-time event, and in the future the releases of sagenb will be git-based, I hope it's OK.

Sure hope so.  Having the infrastructure for the patch in here would be redundant, and also sagenb is not *really* as upstream as one might think...  maybe it's more like halfway up one of those trout ladders one sees in the Pacific Northwest.
