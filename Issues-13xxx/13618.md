Oops! Sorry for the delay!! I had to look through, because reviewing doctests is new to me. But, I have just finished it! 

Here are some trivial comments, rectifying these as necessary should give this positive review: 

1. In `real_double`, `real_mpfr`: It might be nice if we codify the PARI commands too. For instance, the algorithm for `algebraic_dependence()` and `algdep()`, we refer to the PARI command `algdep`. 
2. In `real_mpfi`: In the documentation for the method `str()`, could you please use `\cdot` instead of `*`?
