Hellooooooooooooo Martin !!!

Well, I think that this is a nice thing indeed to add to Sage ! It will certainly help make the use of sage.sat clearer `:-)`

Some comments :
* looking at the sat.rst file, I think that it would be better to put the "table of contents" above the introduction. It is easy to see on one screen that the files includes the introduction, but it is hard to guess that there is a table of contents afterwards. To me it seems better the other way around, but that's up to you.
* I am also use to see some title before the automatically generated list of classes and methods. It helps differentiate visually what is the "introduction" and what is the list of functions. Again, that's up to you.
* It may be totally obvious when you deal with SAT solvers, but I wondered what the input format of `add_clause` was. Looks like -2 represents the negation of variable 2, it's the kind of thing that could be written somewhere, just to make sure in case of doubt.
* You say in `add_clause` that new variables are created if necessary when a new number appears. Does it mean that 1000000 variables will be created if I add a clause containing variable 1000000, or just one new variable corresponding to 1000000 ? It would be nice to add this information somewhere, too.
* What happens when `.write` is called and the filename it set to `None`, its default value ? I guess an exception should be raised in that case, but it depends on the answer `:-)` 

I read the doc of "Anf to CNF" and the doc of "Sat functions for polynomials", and even though it took me some time to understand what it was about, it felt like "beginner's questions", and unclear only because it is not my field. If you feel that this doc is sufficient then let it go into Sage, having this exposed is nice enough for a start and I cannot tell what could miss either `:-)`

About tests:

* sat.rst does not pass optional doctests

```
