Currently, one can iterate over a padic element. So the following code runs forever:

```
sage: for c in Qp(3).zero():
...       pass
```

This causes some trouble, see #13302 and I think that padics should not return iterators at all.

What should the iterator for Qp(3).zero() be — should it be infinite or empty? Should the iterator for Zp(3)(3) and Qp(3)(3) iterate over `[0,1]` or over `[1]`?

I believe that if one wants to iterate over the terms, then one should have to call .list() or similar explicitly.
