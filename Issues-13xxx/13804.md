On my installation of Cywgin (on 64 bits Windows 7), building libfplll fails because make complains there is no rule to build fplll if I use MAKE=make -j4".
Indeed there is one for fplll$(EXEEXT), but no for fplll and $(EXEEXT) is non empty on Cygwin.
Nonetheless, if the file fplll.exe exists, then "make fplll" will happily tell you that its up to date and go on with its job.

This does not happen with a sequential build.

Use the spkg at
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/libfplll-3.0.12.p3.spkg

And by the way the libfplll we ship is old and the problem is not present in the most recent version.
See #12835.
So I won't report this upstream.

**Assignee:** tbd

**CC:**  @kcrisman @dimpase

**Keywords:** libfplll spkg cygwin

**Upstream:** None of the above - read trac for reasoning.

**Reviewer:** Karl-Dieter Crisman

**Resolution:** fixed
