Normaliz http://www.mathematik.uni-osnabrueck.de/normaliz/ is one of the dependencies of Macaulay2 (which is also an optional package), but can be of interest on its own as well.

Install the spkg from [here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/normaliz-2.8.p0.spkg)

`-static` is not supported on MacOSX. There one gets:

```
...

```

It's probably better to build a dynamic library.

The file
`source/Makefile.configuration` contains lines

```
##for mac link libgcc not static
NORMFLAGS = -static
#NORMFLAGS = -static-libgcc
```
If I set switch  `NORMFLAGS = -static-libgcc` then on MacOSX 10.6.8 the spkg builds OK. It's a trivial matter to add an OS recognition to spkg-install and patch the said file if one happens to be on OSX.

As well, I don't know how to properly handle the Singular interface. Note that Normaliz provides an interface to Singular, in `src/Singular/normaliz.lib`.

On the other hand, Singular spkg provides `normaliz.lib` for version 2.7 of Normaliz.
(Which is probably useless without Normaliz installed, and ought to be removed, but this is not for this ticket).
I think one should make this spkg install `normaliz.lib` to its proper place in `$SAGE_LOCAL`.

Regarding M2 support, it can wait, but this one definitely needs work. I'd be happy to have another look after this is implemented.

not according to the following lines 

```
@*Singular and Normaliz exchange data via files. These files are automatically
created and erased behind the scenes. 
```
in Singular/singular.lib

So it is not something independent.

after installing the spkg, one can call `normaliz` from Sage's `singular_console()`, (or just as `sage -singular` --- the results are the same) but results don't always make sense. E.g.

```

I also noticed that some normaliz.lib functions are not working as advertised, e.g.

```
> startNmz();
   ? open: Error for link _ of type: ASCII, mode: r, name: nmz_sing_exec.path
   ? cannot read from `nmz_sing_exec.path`
   ? error occurred in or before normaliz.lib::startNmz line 292: `    string s=read(inf); `
   ? expected string-expression. type 'help string;'
   ? leaving normaliz.lib::startNmz
   skipping text from `;` error at token `)`
```
instead of [this](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/latest/sing_1154.htm#SEC1230). This is probably minor, as `normaliz` executable is found in the `PATH`.
To make it work I can do 

```
> setNmzDataPath("/tmp/");
> setNmzFilename("blah");
> writeNmzPaths();
> startNmz();
nmz_exec_path not set
nmz_data_path is /tmp/
```
If I then try the Singular input as above to compute 
`intclMonIdeal(I)` I can see that the files `/tmp/blah.*` created do not make sense. E.g. `/tmp/blah.in` is as follows:

```
1
1
2 
3
```
which makes little sense.

I would not be surprised if this is an upstream (i.e. `normaliz`) bug.

If I rather set  `ring R=0,(x,y,z),dp;` then the result is consistent with Singular's manual. So this looks like a documentation bug rather than anything more serious.
