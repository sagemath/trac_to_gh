Consider the following:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: R.<x> = IntegerModRing(20000009)[]
sage: eq = x^6+x-17                      
sage: time eq.roots(multiplicities=False)
[3109038, 17207405]
Time: CPU 202.93 s, Wall: 203.65 s
```
A faster method would be (when the modulus is not too large) to factor it,
solve modulo the prime factors, and reconstruct using CRT:
| Sage Version 5.1, Release Date: 2012-07-09                         |
| Type "notebook()" for the browser-based notebook interface.        |
| Type "help()" for help.                                            |
```
sage: R.<x> = IntegerModRing(61)[]       
sage: eq = x^6+x-17                      
sage: time eq.roots(multiplicities=False)
[51, 37]
Time: CPU 0.00 s, Wall: 0.00 s
sage: R.<x> = IntegerModRing(327869)[]   
sage: eq = x^6+x-17                      
sage: time eq.roots(multiplicities=False)
[158217]
Time: CPU 0.00 s, Wall: 0.00 s
sage: crt([51,158217],[61,327869])
3109038
sage: crt([37,158217],[61,327869])
17207405
```

<a id='comment:7'></a>looks good to me. Just a tiny remark: if the modulus is not square free, we can also call
roots on each p<sup>k</sup> and use CRT. Even if roots mod p<sup>k</sup> is slow, this will be better. Otherwise I'm happy to give a positive review.
