I do think we need a better error message in the case that Sage has the dtype, but it's not valid.

```
sage: v = vector([i,3/4,55.6])

Finally, though it's not directly relevant to this ticket, why can't I bring a numpy thing directly back to Sage?  I can do `vector(v.numpy())` but apparently not just `v.nump()._sage_()`.  Strange.

They all are, e.g. 

```
sage: import numpy
sage: v = vector(range(10)); v
 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
sage: v.numpy(dtype=numpy.uint8)
 array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], dtype=uint8)
```

int, bool, complex, object are the standard builtin Python types, which numpy already understands. 

> Also, where the heck does `object` get predefined?  In `stdsage.something`?


It's the root of all Python objects. 

```
% python
>>> object
<type 'object'>
```

This is numpy's error, and I agree it's pretty horrid, see additional patch. 

> Finally, though it's not directly relevant to this ticket, why can't I bring a numpy thing directly back to Sage?  I can do `vector(v.numpy())` but apparently not just `v.nump()._sage_()`.  Strange.


Because the NumPy project does not define a _sage_ method on their arrays.
