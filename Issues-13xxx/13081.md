This looks pretty good overall.  It would be nice for the newbie to have a little more documentation, maybe, of other `dype`s built in to Sage, especially since not all the ones listed [here](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.types.html) are available.  Which ones are?  I found `int`, `bool`, `complex`, `float`, but not all of the specific bit or `uint` ones.  Also, where the heck does `object` get predefined?  In `stdsage.something`?

```
sage: v = vector([i,3/4,55.6])
sage: v.numpy(dtype=complex)
array([  0.00+1.j,   0.75+0.j,  55.60+0.j])
sage: w = vector([-2,3, 4.0])
sage: w.numpy(dtype=bool) 
array([ True,  True,  True], dtype=bool)
```

I do think we need a better error message in the case that Sage has the dtype, but it's not valid.

```
sage: v = vector([i,3/4,55.6])
sage: v.numpy(dtype=int)      
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<snip>
ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence.
```

Finally, though it's not directly relevant to this ticket, why can't I bring a numpy thing directly back to Sage?  I can do `vector(v.numpy())` but apparently not just `v.nump()._sage_()`.  Strange.

> This looks pretty good overall.  It would be nice for the newbie to have a little more documentation, maybe, of other `dype`s built in to Sage, especially since not all the ones listed [here](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.types.html) are available.  Which ones are?  I found `int`, `bool`, `complex`, `float`, but not all of the specific bit or `uint` ones.  

They all are, e.g. 

```
sage: import numpy
sage: v = vector(range(10)); v
 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
sage: v.numpy(dtype=numpy.uint8)
 array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], dtype=uint8)
```

int, bool, complex, object are the standard builtin Python types, which numpy already understands. 

> Also, where the heck does `object` get predefined?  In `stdsage.something`?

It's the root of all Python objects. 

```
% python
>>> object
<type 'object'>
```

This is numpy's error, and I agree it's pretty horrid, see additional patch. 

> Finally, though it's not directly relevant to this ticket, why can't I bring a numpy thing directly back to Sage?  I can do `vector(v.numpy())` but apparently not just `v.nump()._sage_()`.  Strange.

Because the NumPy project does not define a `_sage_` method on their arrays.
