This looks pretty good overall.  It would be nice for the newbie to have a little more documentation, maybe, of other `dype`s built in to Sage, especially since not all the ones listed [here](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.types.html) are available.  Which ones are?  I found `int`, `bool`, `complex`, `float`, but not all of the specific bit or `uint` ones.  Also, where the heck does `object` get predefined?  In `stdsage.something`?

```
sage: v = vector([i,3/4,55.6])
sage: v.numpy(dtype=complex)
array([  0.00+1.j,   0.75+0.j,  55.60+0.j])
sage: w = vector([-2,3, 4.0])
sage: w.numpy(dtype=bool) 
array([ True,  True,  True], dtype=bool)
```

I do think we need a better error message in the case that Sage has the dtype, but it's not valid.

```
sage: v = vector([i,3/4,55.6])
sage: v.numpy(dtype=int)      
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<snip>
ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence.
```

Finally, though it's not directly relevant to this ticket, why can't I bring a numpy thing directly back to Sage?  I can do `vector(v.numpy())` but apparently not just `v.nump()._sage_()`.  Strange.

It would be nice for the newbie to have a little more documentation, maybe, of other `dype`s built in to Sage, especially since not all the ones listed [here](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.types.html) are available.  Which ones are?  I found `int`, `bool`, `complex`, `float`, but not all of the specific bit or `uint` ones.  

They all are, e.g. 

```
sage: import numpy
sage: v = vector(range(10)); v
 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
sage: v.numpy(dtype=numpy.uint8)
 array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], dtype=uint8)
```

int, bool, complex, object are the standard builtin Python types, which numpy already understands. 

> Also, where the heck does `object` get predefined?  In `stdsage.something`?

It's the root of all Python objects. 

```
% python
>>> object
<type 'object'>
```

> ```

This is numpy's error, and I agree it's pretty horrid, see additional patch. 

> Finally, though it's not directly relevant to this ticket, why can't I bring a numpy thing directly back to Sage?  I can do `vector(v.numpy())` but apparently not just `v.nump()._sage_()`.  Strange.

Because the NumPy project does not define a `_sage_` method on their arrays.

I wouldn't ask, but I have two other nitpicks.

> They all are, e.g.

Could you maybe add the 

```
sage: v.numpy(dtype=numpy.uint8)
 array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], dtype=uint8)
```
example just so people have that?

> Shouldn't that patch have `except ValueError as e:`, given that we're now shipping Python 2.7?

And shouldn't there be a doctest for that branch?  Sorry for the nitpicking, thank you very much for the answers, otherwise I'm sure this is more than ready!

Could you add an "INPUT" section to document this dtype parameter (which would redirect toward numpy's documentation I guess) ?

Once this is done, the patch is good to go.
