Hi everyone,

I'm very exited to create my first ticket and add my first patch. It would be nice if the assumption function could return the assumptions of a variable explicitly. For example:

```
sage: x, y, z = var('x y z')
sage: assume(x, 'integer')
sage: assume(y > 0)
sage: assume(y**2 + z**2 == 1)
sage: assume(x < 0)
sage: assumptions()
[x is integer, y > 0, y^2 + z^2 == 1, x < 0]
sage: assumptions(x)
['integer', x < 0]
sage: assumptions(x, y)
[x is integer, x < 0, y > 0, y^2 + z^2 == 1]
sage: assumptions(z)   
[y^2 + z^2 == 1]
```

I'll upload a solution for this suggestion shortly.

Thanks for the patch. Your changes look good to me. I attached a referee patch to fix some minor issues:

* do not use strings to check if an assumption contains a variable
* minor documentation fix (code blocks should be preceeded by `::`)

If you're OK with my changes, feel free to switch this ticket to positive_review.

Thank you, this seems very nice. I like it. 

However I would still like to do something like this:

```
sage: x = var('x')
sage: assume(x, 'integer')
sage: 'integer' in assumptions(x) # or something in this fashion
True
```
That's why I added a 'integer' string in the assumption code, but I see that you removed this in the newer patch. I still do not know a nice solution for this (small) problem.

I removed that code because treating only the integer case specially is not a good long term solution.

The right way to handle this is via the `is_integer()` method of symbolic expressions:

```
sage: var('y', domain=ZZ)
y
sage: y.is_integer()
False
sage: var('a')
a
sage: a.is_integer()
False
```

Unfortunately, our wrappers around Maxima assumptions don't know anything about these and these don't know about Maxima assumptions. I can't even find a bug to make the two work together. Would you be interested in helping out? 

In order to make assumptions set domains in Pynac, all we need to do is add a call to `SR.symbol(variable_name, domain=new_domain)` in the code for `assume()` and reset the domain to `CC` in `forget()`.

This should all be done on a separate ticket of course.
