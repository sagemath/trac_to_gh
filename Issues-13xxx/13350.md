cygchecking the corresponding dll shows that libR.dll cannot be found.
Indeed, it resides in SAGE_LOCAL/lib/R/lib/ which is not part of PATH.
Adding it to path seems to fix the issue.

Apply [attachment: trac_13350.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13350/trac_13350.patch.gz) to SAGE_ROOT.
