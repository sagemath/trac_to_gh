I did a clean install of sage as root, then installed the cremona database optional package, but other users can't use it, because it is readable only by the owner (root):

Hmm, I do this all the time with no problem, but what I do is build
and install extra spkgs as me (not root), then copy all to
/usr/local/sage, then run sage as root, then change all ownerships and
permissions.

However it would be easy to change the line in the spkg-install which
copies that .db file into SAGE_DATA so that it is world-readable.  It
probably all reults in the line "umask 077" in my own .bashrc file.

Well I had absolutely no idea when I built/installed Sage that I would be installing the cremona database :-).

That would make a lot of sense to me.

Deal:  try the new spkg at #13547, where there is a new spkg which has been there since October waiting for a review.  I just changed 1 bit (approx) in it so that the file cremona.db now has permissions 644 (was 600), and that should work.

A positive review for #13547 would also be welcome.
