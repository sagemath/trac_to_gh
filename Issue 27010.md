Thanks for the compliment!  The `style='tree'` is also useful, because you can, for example, easily collect graphs by equivalent modular decomposition:


```
def doit(n):
    from collections import defaultdict
    d = defaultdict(list)
    for g in graphs(n):
        m = g.modular_decomposition(algorithm='habib', style='tree')
        m = m.map_labels(lambda x: None if x in ZZ else x)
        d[m].append(g.canonical_label())
    return dict(d)
```

and then

```
sage: view(doit(5).items())
```

Instead of this, I think this would be better

```diff
-          - ``'tree'`` -- as `LabelledRootedTree`.
+          - ``'tree'`` -- as :class:`~sage.combinat.rooted_tree.LabelledRootedTree`.
```
