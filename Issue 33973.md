CC:  fredrik.johansson

a student here, Lauriane Turelier, has hit the following issue. WIth Sage 9.2 on a AMD EPYC 7282:

```
$ /usr/bin/sage res.sage
1.8131059999999994
```

With Sage 9.5 on a Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4570:

```
$ /usr/bin/sage res.sage
0.007745000000000002
```

This is the time for the computation of the resultant of two degree-9 polynomials in two variables with coefficients of up to 248 digits.
Maybe this was fixed since 9.2, but just for the record, I prefer to report it.

FWIW: On [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/), it is easy to run this calculation on all sagemath versions from 9.1 to 9.6 (and I also tried 9.7.beta5). In all cases, it took about 0.5-0.6 seconds, so it doesn't seem that the sagemath version makes much difference.  I have no idea why the i5-4570 is so much faster.

now I cannot reproduce any more on the i5-4570, and I get timings of about 0.5 second on all machines (including 9.5 on the AMD EPYC 7282). This is very strange.

we have investigated with Xavier Bonnetain and it might be due to an update of the Flint package in Debian, which is now Flint 2.9.0 according to `singular.version()`. Maybe the new version of Flint is slower? Can someone try with Sage 9.5, but a version of Flint before 2.9.0?

in fact the problem is worse: the "fast" computation is completely wrong (thanks to Xavier Bonnetain for figuring it out). The "resultant" computed has degree 0 in tau, whereas the correct resultant should have degree 81 (this can be checked by computing the resultant modulo 2<sup>29</sup>-3 for example).

This bug arises on Debian with Sage 9.5, using the Debian package for Flint 2.8.5.

Changed the priority to "critical".
