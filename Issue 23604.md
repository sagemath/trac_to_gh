The current MPIR used by Sage (3.0.0) does not build on a i7-6700.

```
/bin/yasm -I .. -f elf64  -o sub_err1_n.lo `test -f 'sub_err1_n.as' || echo './'`sub_err1_n.as
[mpir-3.0.0.p0] add_err1_n.as:77: error: undefined symbol `mpn_add_err1_n.testrest' (first use)
```

The reason is detailed in https://github.com/wbhart/mpir/issues/196
and fixed in MPIR trunk. A workaround is to add ` --with-system-yasm` to the MPIR configure command.

So, the solution is to either upgrade MPIR or to change our spkg-install.

Hmmm, the command above is `/bin/yasm` and adding the configure option results in the same error, only that the command is now `/usr/bin/yasm`. That is yasm-1.2.0 on OpenSuSE.

I deinstalled system yasm-1.2.0 so Sage builds yasm-1.3.0 and now MPIR builds fine. So Sage should install yasm-1.3.0 if the system version is less.

I verified that, on a yasm-1.2.0 installation and after `make distclean`, while develop fails to build, this branch installs yasm-1.3.0 before succesfully building MPIR. So, I think we're good to go.
