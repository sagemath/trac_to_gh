# Issue 26954: Use SAGE_LIB instead of of a path derived from SAGE_LOCAL in sage/doctest/sources.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27191

Original creator: fbissey

Original creation time: 2019-01-31 21:44:38

In `src/sage/doctest/sources.py` the following code

```
sp = os.path.join(SAGE_LOCAL, 'lib', 'python', 'site-packages')
```

can easily be replaced by `SAGE_LIB` which is the intended location in any case.
