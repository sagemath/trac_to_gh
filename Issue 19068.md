Code seems to be fine; doctests pass, documentation builds.
I have added two trivial commits.

Thanks; cross-reviewed them, they look fine.

I think you may need to resolve the merge conflict, else the positive status will last a long time...

EDIT: #19073 and #19083 as well.

There is _no_ merge conflict.

Trac's automerge sometimes yields false positives and colors a branch in red, but this is due to the fact that it does not use the "real" git for merging ...
