# Issue 30951: knot genus outputs wrong value for 5_2

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31188

```
Knots().from_table(5,2).genus()
```

outputs "2" while the expected output is "1", as the 3-genus line on [http://katlas.org/wiki/5_2](http://katlas.org/wiki/5_2) shows.

If we look at another presentation of the 5<sub>2</sub> knot:

```
sage: K2 = Knot([[1,4,2,5],[3,8,4,9],[5,10,6,1],[9,6,10,7],[7,2,8,3]])                                                    
sage: K2.genus()                                                                                                          
3
sage: K2.signature()                                                                                                      
-2
```

So I think `genus` might get the genus of the corresponding Seifert surface rather than the minimal one, which is the invariant. So I am not entirely sure this is a bug but a lack of documentation.

However, there is a definite bug in the signature:

```
sage: K = Knots().from_table(5,2)
sage: K.signature()  # -2 in the table; see above too
2
```

In the code of `genus` it is calculated for a connected component `i` as


```
g = [((2 - t[i]) + len(x[i]) - q[i]) / 2 for i in range(len(x))]
```


(according to Lemm 2.6 of [Col2013]_, respective [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seifert_surface)) where `q[i]` is the number of Seifert circles of the specific Seifert surface obtained from the `braid` representative, `len(x[i])` that of crossings and `t[i]` the number of components.

Thus indeed, it depends on the chosen Seifert surface. I think, this should be made more clear in the documentation and in the code (comment or better naming of variables), as well.

The signature seems to depend on the Seifert matrix, as well. The corresponding Alexander polynomials differ by a factor `t` causing the determinant to have opposite sign, as well. The determinant obtained from the Seifert matrix of `K` is negative whereby that of `K2` is positive:



```
sage: R.<t> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: V = K.seifert_matrix()
sage: A = det(V -t*V.transpose()); A
2*t - 3*t^2 + 2*t^3
sage: A(-1)
-7
sage: V2 = K2.seifert_matrix()
sage: A2 = det(V2 -t*V2.transpose()); A2
2*t^2 - 3*t^3 + 2*t^4
sage: A2(-1)
7
```



This is covered in the `determinant` and `alexander polynomial` methods of the `Link` class by normalization:


```
sage: K.determinant()
7
sage: K2.determinant()
7
sage: K.alexander_polynomial()
2*t^-1 - 3 + 2*t
sage: K2.alexander_polynomial()
2*t^-1 - 3 + 2*t
```


For example concerning the `determinant`:


```
a = self.alexander_polynomial()
return Integer(abs(a(-1)))
```


Is there a corresponding normalization missing for the signature?

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.
