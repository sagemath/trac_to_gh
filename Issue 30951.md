Knots().from_table(5,2).genus()
```

outputs "2" while the expected output is "1", as the 3-genus line on [http://katlas.org/wiki/5_2](http://katlas.org/wiki/5_2) shows.

If we look at another presentation of the 5<sub>2</sub> knot:

```
sage: K2 = Knot([[1,4,2,5],[3,8,4,9],[5,10,6,1],[9,6,10,7],[7,2,8,3]])                                                    
sage: K2.genus()                                                                                                          
3
sage: K2.signature()                                                                                                      
-2
```

So I think `genus` might get the genus of the corresponding Seifert surface rather than the minimal one, which is the invariant. So I am not entirely sure this is a bug but a lack of documentation.

However, there is a definite bug in the signature:

```
sage: K = Knots().from_table(5,2)
sage: K.signature()  # -2 in the table; see above too
2
```

In the code of `genus` it is calculated for a connected component `i` as


```
g = [((2 - t[i]) + len(x[i]) - q[i]) / 2 for i in range(len(x))]
```


(according to Lemm 2.6 of [Col2013]_, respective [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seifert_surface)) where `q[i]` is the number of Seifert circles of the specific Seifert surface obtained from the `braid` representative, `len(x[i])` that of crossings and `t[i]` the number of components.

Thus indeed, it depends on the chosen Seifert surface. I think, this should be made more clear in the documentation and in the code (comment or better naming of variables), as well.


> However, there is a definite bug in the signature:

The signature seems to depend on the Seifert matrix, as well. The corresponding Alexander polynomials differ by a factor `t` causing the determinant to have opposite sign, as well. The determinant obtained from the Seifert matrix of `K` is negative whereby that of `K2` is positive:



```
sage: R.<t> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: V = K.seifert_matrix()
sage: A = det(V -t*V.transpose()); A
2*t - 3*t^2 + 2*t^3
sage: A(-1)
-7
sage: V2 = K2.seifert_matrix()
sage: A2 = det(V2 -t*V2.transpose()); A2
2*t^2 - 3*t^3 + 2*t^4
sage: A2(-1)
7
```



This is covered in the `determinant` and `alexander polynomial` methods of the `Link` class by normalization:


```
sage: K.determinant()
7
sage: K2.determinant()
7
sage: K.alexander_polynomial()
2*t^-1 - 3 + 2*t
sage: K2.alexander_polynomial()
2*t^-1 - 3 + 2*t
```


For example concerning the `determinant`:


```
a = self.alexander_polynomial()
return Integer(abs(a(-1)))
```


Is there a corresponding normalization missing for the signature?
