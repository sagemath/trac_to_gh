# Issue 26317: improve boost_graph.pyx

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dcoudert

CC:  tscrim chapoton jhpalmieri

Keywords: py3, graph

Improve the boost graph interface to avoid using `.vertices()`.

After that, 1 `sorted` operation involving vertex labels comparisons remains, in method `min_spanning_tree`.

This one took me some time as error messages of Cython are sometimes hard to understand...

The patchbot reports two failures that are likely caused from this patch (I cannot check right now):

```
sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/matroids/utilities.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

I have corrected the doctests, but it would be good if someone could check that the results are effectively correct. I have no doubt in `src/sage/matroids/utilities.py` as the output of a test taking as input the changed matrix is unchanged. I have more difficulty with `simplicial_complex`...

The changes to `simplicial_complex.py` are trivially equivalent (same presentation of groups except for the generator names). I am very mildly worried that the output may not always be consistent, but since we are in such early beta stages, I think getting this in and testing it will be the best way.

John, I am cc-ing you to also note this ticket in case we do start seeing random failures in `simplicial_complex.py`.
