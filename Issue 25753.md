Looks good once patchbot is happy.

Hum, still not completely fine:


```
sage: R.<a> = Zp(2).extension(x^3 - 2)
sage: K = R.fraction_field()
sage: u = R(1 + a^4 + a^5 + a^7 + a^8, 10); u
sage: K(u)
1 + a^4 + a^5 + a^7 + a^8 + O(a^10)
sage: R(K(u))
1 + a^4 + a^5 + a^7 + a^8 + O(a^9)
```

Should be fixed... Needs review (bis)

Seems like a reasonable fix.  Once again, I'm happy if the patchbot is.

A failure is reported but it has nothing to do with this ticket, I guess.

Set positive review if you agree.
