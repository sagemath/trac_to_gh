```
sage: P1 = polytopes.regular_polygon(5, exact=False)
sage: P2 = Polyhedron()
sage: P1*P2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)

TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'NoneType'
```


We use the method `_init_empty_polyhedron` if applicable to fix this.
