Assignee: joyner

Keywords: matrix group

the list method for `MatrixGroup` worked only for ZZ and GF(p), but not for QQ. This one line patch should do the job.

We had:

```

sage: gens = [matrix(ZZ,2,[1,0,0,1])]
sage: MatrixGroup(gens).list()
[[1 0]
[0 1]]

sage: gens = [matrix(GF(5),2,[1,0,0,1])]
sage: MatrixGroup(gens).list()
[[1 0]
[0 1]]

sage: gens = [matrix(QQ,2,[1,0,0,1])]
sage: MatrixGroup(gens).list()
...
AttributeError: 'RationalField_with_category' object has no attribute 'multiplicative_generator'
```


Now, the third works as well:


```
sage: gens = [matrix(QQ,2,[1,0,0,1])]
sage: MatrixGroup(gens).list()
[[1 0]
[0 1]]
```
