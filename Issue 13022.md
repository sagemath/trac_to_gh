Keywords: polytope, facets, fan

There is some inconsistency in the name of the method that provides the number of facets of a polytope. The polytope class provides the .n_facets() method. On the other hand, the NormalFan function calls the .nfacets() method, that doesn't exist:


```
sage: R.<x,y,z>=ZZ[]
sage: f=x*R.random_element()+y*R.random_element()+z*R.random_element()
sage: Q=f.newton_polytope()
sage: NormalFan(Q)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/mmarco/sage-5.0/<ipython console> in <module>()

/home/mmarco/sage-5.0/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/geometry/fan.pyc in NormalFan(polytope, lattice)
    626         (N(0, 1), N(-1, 0))
    627     """
--> 628     rays = (polytope.facet_normal(i) for i in range(polytope.nfacets()))
    629     cones = (vertex.facets() for vertex in polytope.faces(dim=0))
    630     fan = Fan(cones, rays, lattice=lattice, check=False)

AttributeError: 'Polyhedron_QQ_ppl' object has no attribute 'nfacets'

```


I don't know if it is meant to be n_facets or nfacets, but it should be consistent.

`NormalFan` takes a lattice polytope as argument, not any QQ-polytope:

```
sage: NormalFan(Q.lattice_polytope())
Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice N
```

Having said that, it would be nice if any polytope would work.

I think the normal fan is defined for non-compact polytopes as well - rays are normals to facets (hence we need full-dimensionality) and higher dimensional cones are given by smaller dimensional faces. I don't insist on implementing it, but perhaps `NotImplementedError` is more suitable than `ValueError`?
