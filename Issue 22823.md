humm, it should really be **unequality** (meaning `!=`) and not **inequality** (meaning `<=` !

EDIT: but I am not a native of Shakespeare's country..

I don't think "unequality" is a word, but here is a modified version.

Thanks. I think I have used "unequality" a few times now, and that will need clean-up elsewhere.

Setting to positive.
