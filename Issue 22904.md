Why should it be an error to have an inseparable extension?

This was the initial solution when it was suggested as a problem. On further reflection it is not appropriate to handle this as an exception for the reason you pointed out. To address the problem that many algorithms do not work without a separable extension; I think it would be better to add an is_separable method to the function field class.

That's sounds like a good idea.

Actually, we should not mix issues in the same ticket as it just makes it really hard for reviewers to understand the history. So let's close this one and create a new one to add `is_separable` there.

Closing tickets in the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix module with positive_review (i.e. someone has confirmed they should be closed).
