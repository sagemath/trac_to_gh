Apart from cosmetic changes, this modifies the computation of the adjusted precision by using floor(...) instead of int(...). Is this mathematically correct ?

I know this is a bit beyond the scope of this ticket, but can we move the

```
floor(Integer(2 * prec - 3).log(p)) - 1
```

outside of the while loop (and before the `if prec <= 2`?

If you don't want to do this, you can set to a positive review. Likewise, once done, you can set a positive review.
