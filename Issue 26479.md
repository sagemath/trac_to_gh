1. This change looks suspicious, can you justify it:

```diff
`@``@` -1927,6 +1928,7 `@``@` def block_matrix(*args, **kwds):
     sub_matrices = args[0]
 
     if is_Matrix(sub_matrices):
+        M = sub_matrices
         # a single matrix (check nrows/ncols/ring)
         if (nrows is not None and nrows != 1) or \
            (ncols is not None and ncols != 1):
```

If it's a bug fix, then a doctest should be added.

2. Replace `if ring == QQ or ring == ZZ:` by `if ring is QQ or ring is ZZ:`

3. PEP 8 recommends to write

```python
entries = lambda i, j: 1 / (i + j + 1)
```

as

```python
def entries(i, j):
    return 1 / (i + j + 1)
```

About 1. Pyflakes said that M was not defined anywhere. And indeed, this part of the code was not doctested.

2. and 3. Done

Looks good to me. 

Side Note : This ticket is actually a bug fix with the `M = sub_matrices` modification.
