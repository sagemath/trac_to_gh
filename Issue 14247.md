# Issue 14247: # tol disables the meaning of ellipsis in doctesting

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: cschwan

Original creation time: 2013-04-15 08:49:09

Assignee: roed

To reproduce the behavior take e.g. the doctest starting at sage/numerical/mip.pyx:2031 (`p.solve() # tol 0.00001`) and replace in the expected output the version string (`v4.44`) with the ellipsis (`...`). The test fails as long as it is marked with the `# tol` attribute. See also dicussion at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/E2kwJLVaJx4.

I agree this is a bug, however it looks quite tricky to fix. As long as the `...` doesn't match any floats, it should work fine. The problem is that the code which handles floats and the code which handles `...` is completely separate. I think this is too hard to get right, so I propose "wontfix".
