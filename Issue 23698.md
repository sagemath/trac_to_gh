# Issue 23698: Kac module crystals repr does not work for first tableau being empty

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23935

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2017-09-26 22:04:51

CC:  sage-combinat aschilling brubaker bsalisbury01 bump saliola

Keywords: crystals


```
sage: Ktriv = crystals.KacModule(['A',[1,1]], [], [])
sage: Ktriv.module_generator()
```

results in an `UnboundLocalError` because `Tableau` was imported later in the function `to_dual_tableau`.
