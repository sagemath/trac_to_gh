# Issue 27014: fpylll: add patch for Cython 3.0

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27251

Add [this patch](https://github.com/fplll/fpylll/commit/28e5fcaeabe26d46167e75815e0d9a4fdfa1a973) to fpylll to make it compatible with Cython master. The default value for `language_level` has changed, so the `language_level` is best specified explicitly.

This makes absolutely no difference with Cython 0.29.x, so it doesn't affect distributions.

The patch just makes it possible to compile Sage with Cython master (something that I regularly do when contributing to Cython).
