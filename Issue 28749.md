# Issue 28749: sage_spkg_configure.m4: Improve messages

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28986

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2020-01-11 04:20:18

CC:  dimpase

When rebuilding, `configure` prints many messages of the following form:

```
configure: === checking whether to install the zlib SPKG ===
configure: === checking whether to install the libpng SPKG ===
configure: === checking whether to install the freetype SPKG ===
```

with no indication of actual tests or the result of the check.
This ticket adds some helpful output.

how about `is already` rather than `was previously` in the message?

Is there any connection with #28788? If not, should there be?
