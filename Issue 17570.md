# Issue 17570: Add something to FAQ about octal issues

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2015-02-18 20:48:05

Keywords: beginner

Minimal-ish example to add to faq, as this is a pretty tricky one to decipher otherwise:

```

sage: 100+017
115
sage: 100+018
  File "<ipython-input-4-e22a2df853ad>", line 1
    Integer(100)+Integer(018)
                           ^
SyntaxError: invalid token

```
