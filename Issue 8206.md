The command  hg qnew -f would be good to include in the discussion on Mercurial queues (and replace some uncertainty).

As well as a mention of the record extensions.

I don't know mercurial queues well (although I know them a little better after looking at this!) but this seems like a simple patch.  Docs build OK, changes make sense, so positive review.

See also #1610 for more stuff on "hg record" and cherry picking.
