Keywords: preparser

The following works during doctests:

```
sage: preparse("1rj")
'1J'
sage: 1r + 1rj
(1+1j)
```


However, in the REPL it fails:

```
sage: preparse("1rj")
'Integer(1)*rj'
sage: 1r + 1rj
...
NameError: name 'rj' is not defined
```

To signal a complex literal as raw, place the `r` at the very end:

```
sage: 1jr
1j
sage: 1r + 1jr
(1+1j)
```


I suggest to close as invalid or wontfix.

But I will listen to arguments for doing otherwise.

Oh, it turns out this is a conflict with implicit multiplication, which I had enabled in my init.sage file. Both `1rj` and `1jr` work when implicit multiplication is disabled. I have updated the description.

Here is a minimal fix. I have also changed the regular expressions to be case-insensitive, which solves the following problem with scientific notation and implicit multiplication:

```
sage: implicit_multiplication(True)
sage: 1e3
1000.00000000000
sage: 1E3
...
NameError: name 'E3' is not defined
