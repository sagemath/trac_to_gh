# Issue 15292: Maxima takes version information from git repo

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Maxima's configure.in checks if it is being run from a git repo, and if so then it uses `git describe --dirty` as maxima version.

Maybe add `export GIT_DIR="$(pwd)/.git"` right before configuring maxima?

Probably want to increment patch version, otherwise looks good.
