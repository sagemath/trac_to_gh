Some comments:

`FunctionFieldHigherDerivation.__init__` is missing a doctest (add a `TestSuite(foo).run()` here `;)`, if something is failing, add a `skip="_test_failed"` or `skip=["_test_failed", "_test_failure"]`).

Same for `FunctionFieldHigherDerivation_rational`.

I think you should include a definition of the Cartier operation (unless this is something anyone who has ever learned about function fields will know about it; pardon my ignorance here)?

In `_pth_root`, I would avoid the import `from .element import FunctionFieldElement_rational` as this can really slow things down more than you expect (in my experience). If you need to put it in the method because of circular imports, then I would instead make it a `lazy_import`.

This seems like the better (i.e., faster) way to do it instead of dividing by `x.derivative() in the lambda function:

```
xderinv = ~(x.derivative())
derivative = lambda f: xderinv * f.derivative()
```


I am not sure this comparison `if prec < infinity:` for `prec=None` will always work on Python3. So I think you are better changing the order of the tests to be

```python
if prec is None or prec == infinity:
    raise NotImplementedErorr
# continue with init
```


----

Some nitpicks:

`R(0)` -> `R.zero()` (unless you expect `R` to be a Python type like `int`, but I don't see that happening here).

Micro-optimization for when the basis is empty:

```diff
+        if not basis:
+            return [],[]
         d = len(basis)
-
-        if d == 0:
-            return [],[]
```


The one-line sentence for `completion()` is missing a period/full-stop.


```diff
-Return i-th derivative of f with respect to the separating element.
+Return ``i``-th derivative of ``f`` with respect to the separating element.
```


I think doing `pth_root = self._pth_root` obfuscates the code at little bit. I doubt that one additional indirection matters that much for speed (but maybe I am wrong).

A little more clarity on the message:

```diff
-raise NotImplementedError('not yet supported')
+raise NotImplementedError('exact results not yet supported')
```


Instead of checking `while len(gaps) < g:`, you could instead decrement `g` when adding to `gaps` and test `while g:`. This should be faster.

    "user": "https://github.com/tscrim"
}
```

So why the pickling isn't working is this:

```
sage: F.<x> = FunctionField(GF(2))
sage: d = F.higher_derivation()
sage: d.__reduce__()
(<built-in function unpickle_map>,
 (<class 'sage.rings.function_field.maps.FunctionFieldHigherDerivation_rational'>,
  Set of Homomorphisms from Rational function field in x over Finite Field of size 2 to Rational function field in x over Finite Field of size 2,
  {'_field': Rational function field in x over Finite Field of size 2,
   '_p': 2,
   '_pth_root_in_finite_field': <function <lambda> at 0x7f01f807f230>,
   '_separating_element': x},
  {'_codomain': Rational function field in x over Finite Field of size 2,
   '_domain': Rational function field in x over Finite Field of size 2,
   '_is_coercion': False,
   '_repr_type_str': None}))
```

The lambda function cannot be pickled. This was indicated by trying to do

```
sage: dumps(d)
...
PicklingError: Can't pickle <type 'function'>: attribute lookup __builtin__.function failed
```

So the simple solution would be to remove `_pth_root_in_finite_field` and just inline the checks. I did that, but then the pickling still failed because equality was not implemented.

Thus, hat I would suggest doing is making these `Map` classes also inherit from `UniqueRepresentation`. I don't think this will introduce any reference cycles (i.e., a memory leak) considering your input parameter is just the `field`.

I also have tried this :-) But adding `UniqueRepresentation` also raises an exception complaining of multiple metaclasses...

What you need to do is use is the metaclass that is a combination of the two being passed:

```
from six import with_metaclass
from sage.structure.unique_representation import UniqueRepresentation
from sage.misc.inherit_comparison import InheritComparisonClasscallMetaclass
class FunctionFieldDerivation(with_metaclass(InheritComparisonClasscallMetaclass, UniqueRepresentation, Map)):
```

With the appropriate change, I get the pickling test to pass.

Thank you for the fixes. I have made a few more (see below).

Thank you. I also got rid of some code duplication. Personally, I think what we should do is add a `pth_root` method to a prime field to get rid of this hack. Anyways, this will work for now as that should be on a separate ticket.

I fixed one more of these.

Ah, right. However, this is something that should be addressed because there is no guarantee that this will remain this way (or not raise an error). So I have changed it to be what should be equivalent code (as `None == infinity` should always return `False`).

I also made a few other trivial tweaks for PEP8. If my changes are good, then you can set a positive review.
