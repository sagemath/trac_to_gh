Installation worked great. Inside `sage -sh`, I managed to


```
pandoc -s -o file.md file.rst
notedown file.md -o file.ipynb
```


and opens in Jupyter correctly.

(There are some issues with the title, references, but I think these issues will be look at more closely in a follow up ticket like #21513 or #21514)

Does this make pandoc a dependency of Sage? (Is it already?  I assume not.)

No, `pandoc` is not a dependency of the current package, though it depends on `pandoc_attributes` which is a Python program. Actually `pandoc` is a dependency of `rst-to-ipynb` (see #21513), but since `pandoc` is a Haskell program, it would have made a lot of dependencies, so it is assumed that `pandoc` is systemwide installed (there will be a warning in the `sage -rst2ipynb` command).
