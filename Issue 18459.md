The lineality of a cone is defined as the dimension of the largest linear subspace contained in the cone. It's related to strict-convexity and the dimension of (the span of (the dual of the cone)). It's easy to compute using the existing cone methods.

As it is a small addition, tiny nitpicks:
- let's change "Compute" to "Return" - to me "compute ..." means that computation is performed and perhaps stored in a cache without returning anything, such methods are certainly useful especially as helpers
- you can use combined inequalities in Python:
  {{{
sage: 0 <= l <= K.lattice_dim()
}}}
   rather than
   {{{
sage: (0 <= l) and (l <= K.lattice_dim())
}}}
- PEP8 suggests only one blank line between methods and two between classes https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#blank-lines
- not sure I ever read a style guide for it, but it seems strange to me to have an empty line in the very end of a docstring ;-)
