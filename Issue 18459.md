# Issue 18459: Add lineality() method for convex cones

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: mjo

Original creation time: 2015-06-13 14:40:05

The lineality of a cone is defined as the dimension of the largest linear subspace contained in the cone. It's related to strict-convexity and the dimension of (the span of (the dual of the cone)). It's easy to compute using the existing cone methods.

As it is a small addition, tiny nitpicks:
 - let's change "Compute" to "Return" - to me "compute ..." means that computation is performed and perhaps stored in a cache without returning anything, such methods are certainly useful especially as helpers
 - you can use combined inequalities in Python:
   {{{
sage: 0 <= l <= K.lattice_dim()
}}}
   rather than
   {{{
sage: (0 <= l) and (l <= K.lattice_dim())
}}}
 - PEP8 suggests only one blank line between methods and two between classes https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#blank-lines
 - not sure I ever read a style guide for it, but it seems strange to me to have an empty line in the very end of a docstring ;-)
