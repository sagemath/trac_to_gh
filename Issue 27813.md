Within the `ImplicitExpansion` method of the asymptotic expansion generators, very large (symbolic) equations are solved.

Simplifying these equations before attempting to solve them drastically improves performance.

Code LGTM, waiting for a patchbot to pick this up. Feel free to set to positive review once patchbot is happy.

I guess that the patchbots ignored the ticket because there was no author listed.

One patchbot is happy, another one had a spurious error which cannot be related to this ticket.
