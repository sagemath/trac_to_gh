Keywords: cygwin timeout

Two hardcoded timeouts default valued make some tests fail on Cygwin (presumably because Cygwin is slow, and forking is horribly slow):
* sage/tests/cmdline.py, the timeout value (current default 50.0 secs) of test_executable;
* sagenb/misc/misc.py, the alarm value (current default 1 sec) when launcing the notebook (which makes lauching the notebook tricky.
See http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/6743#comment:144 and http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/6743#comment:146

Just slightly (from a human point of view) increasing these values let the tests pass on recent and even not so recent and powerful harware running Cygwin, so let's increase these default values unconditionnally rather than adding Cygwin specific code, or warnings about expected to fail tests or whatever; let's say:
* 100.0 secs in test_executable,
* 5 secs when launching the notebook.

In fact I'm not sure what needed to be rebased.
The patch I just uploaded was produced on top of 5.9.beta2 but looks exactly like the previous one.
So I'll think a little more.
