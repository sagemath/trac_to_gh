Keywords: PolynomialRing, multivariate, singular, recursion depth

This gives a "RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded".


```
R1 = ZZ['x0','x1']
x = R1(1)
R2 = ZZ[tuple('x'+str(i) for i in range(967))]
y = R2('x0')
x*y
```


Decreasing the number 967 results in the correct answer (it's slow though).

I'm going to guess that "coercion" is the right component.

Yep, something is going wrong with either the coercion or in `_element_constructor_` as these are almost instantaneous:

```
sage: phi = R2.coerce_map_from(R1)
sage: R2._element_constructor_??
sage: phi(x)
1
sage: phi(x) * y
x0
sage: R2(x) * y
x0
```

My guess is probably in the `_element_constructor_`.
