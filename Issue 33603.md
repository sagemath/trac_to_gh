If I remember correctly, other `_unsafe` methods (or the ones I know about) are internal to the matrix implementation; they do not call methods from the base ring or its elements.

Numpy arrays are very different than a matrix, which has a (very different) mathematical meaning.

I think `__bool__` should be treated like `__eq__`, which should generally never raise an error. (I would like to see an `Unknown` type being able to return however.) My justification is `bool(x)` should be equivalent to `x == 0` for any object where `0` makes sense.

> My own use case was a bit similar tooâ€”a custom number class that worked with numerical approximations and could raise an exception to ask the caller to redo the whole computation with a higher working precision.


IMO, the correct thing do for this is to implement a subclass that handles such things as necessary. I don't think raising an exception is the correct way to deal with working around the lack of an `Unknown` return type. IMO, you should check something like `if not (x == 0) and not (x != 0):`.

I would say this is internal as well, but I know you are using a different definition (see below).

> they do not call methods from the base ring or its elements.


That is not true. They can build elements from or convert data to internal data structures. For example, see `matrix_gf2e_dense.pyx`.

Of course. My point was just that, in general, Python objects do have `__bool__()` methods that raise exceptions.

`get_is_zero_unsafe()` is used by *generic* matrices, meaning it may call the `__bool__()` method of elements of arbitrary rings, including custom rings provided by the user. Why shouldn't it propagate the exceptions raised in these methods?

I can also make a Python object that can delete your entire system upon calling `__bool__()`. Saying it could happen is different than saying it should be allowed to happen.

There is an implicit assumption that those rings are reasonable well-behaved. In particular, if you are wanting to see if something is zero, then it should be well-behaved in this regard and not raise an error on comparisons to `0`. So many things do not protect against this for good reason.

Raising an error on equality can cause lots of subtle problems. For example, when working with dictionaries in which you get a hash collision:

```sage
sage: M = matrix(2,2,range(4))
sage: M.set_immutable()
sage: t = SR(M)
sage: mat = matrix([[t]])
sage: mat.set_immutable()
sage: mat == 0. # boom
sage: hash(mat)
1677951251422179082
sage: d = {mat: 0}
sage: d[mat]  # fine since no hash collision
0
sage: d[hash(mat)] = 2 # boom from a hash collision that invokes an equality check
```
