# Issue 13317: Make vertex labels more flexible

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13521

Original creator: jason

Original creation time: 2012-09-23 03:43:31

Assignee: jason, ncohen, rlm

Over lunch today, Jamie Radcliffe at University of Nebraska, Lincoln, suggested making the vertex label plotting more flexible to take a dictionary or function that gives the vertex labels.  This patch makes that possible.

Still to do: add some examples, and do the same thing for the edge_labels parameter.  Feel free to post a patch to do these!

This is a git version of the patch. I added a few examples.

For `edge_labels`, it seems way more difficult to do as we have to take into account loops, multiple edges, orientation, etc. So I propose to let it for a future ticket.

LGTM.

It is better to have smaller tickets like this anyways IMO.
