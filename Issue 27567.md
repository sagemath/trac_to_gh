The script should check whether lrslib has been configured with LRS_QUIET (see #27805).

do you know how to do this? (A short C/C++ program to plug in would do).

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

Matthias might know how to check whether lrslib was configured with `LRS_QUIET`.

no version check? Should not be hard:

```
$ lrs -v


*bad input file name

*lrs_setup failed
*lrs:lrslib v.7.1 2020.10.17(64bit,lrslong.h,hybrid arithmetic)
```

Didn't find a distribution to test on, really... Anything that ships old lrs also has a too old FLINT
