The `sage --patchbot` command no longer works, now that the patchbot requires Python 3.

I know you don't like it, but I find it very convenient.

I was using it until the patchbot changes broke my patchbot. (It is convenient because I didn't need my own separate Python installation with `pyflakes`, etc. — I could use Sage's.)
