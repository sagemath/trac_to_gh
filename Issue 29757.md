Thanks for working on this.

There's a duplicated doctest for `parametric_representation`.

```
+            sage: p.closed_point()
+            Point (x, y - 1)
+            sage: p.closed_point()
+            Point (x, y - 1)
```


In `Curve`, adding a comment on the special handling in the added case would be valuable.

```
             if k in Fields():
+                if k == QQ and A.coordinate_ring().ideal(F).is_prime():
+                    return IntegralAffineCurve(A, F)
                 return AffineCurve_field(A, F)
             return AffineCurve(A, F)
```

Also, this is repeated 4 times (for affine/projective, plane/general), so perhaps this can be refactored?

There are also some warnings from patchbot plugins.

I did some refactoring in the constructor, but perhaps not for the case you commented on. 

For the special handling(?), I think the code explains itself. I don't see any helpful comment to add...

Fixed for patchbot warnings.
