# Issue 29456: Request: restore exports to refinement_graphs.pxd

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29693

Original creator: @ed359

In 2017 some .pxd files in the sagelib were cleaned up and various exports removed. 

In my case having access to some of these removed functions allows my customized canonical isomorph-free generation of graphs to run at 'cython speed'. I suggest that some of these exports are re-added. 

In particular I want `all_children_are_equivalent, compare_graphs, refine_by_degree, search_tree` to be re-added to `sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/refinement_graphs.pxd`. This allows me to implement my own `search_tree`-like functions.

I'm currently stuck on windows and setting up a development environment in order to write a patch is a daunting task, sorry. I tracked down the relevant commit on the github:
