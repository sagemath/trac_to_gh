Keywords: python3

The write() function does return nothing in Py2

```
>>> sys.version
'2.7.5+ (default, Feb 27 2014, 19:37:08) \n[GCC 4.8.1]'
>>> with open("tracked", "w") as f: f.write("boo")
... 
>>> 
```
while in Py3 it returns the number of bytes written

```
>>> sys.version
'3.3.2+ (default, Feb 28 2014, 00:52:16) \n[GCC 4.8.1]'
>>> with open("tracked", "w") as f: f.write("boo")
... 
3
>>> 
```
This can be unified by adding something like `ignore =`

```
>>> sys.version
'3.3.2+ (default, Feb 28 2014, 00:52:16) \n[GCC 4.8.1]'
>>> with open("tracked", "w") as f: ignore = f.write("boo")
... 
>>> 
```
About 79 py module are effected.

I used `_ = file.open('...')`, since `_` is commonly used as an ignored variable in Python. Also, `_` has a special meaning at the command line: the result of the previous command. But `_` is treated differently in doctesting: in `libs/pari/tests.py`, if I use

```
    sage: _ = gpfile.file.write("polcyclo(5)\n")
```
on line 187, then on line 377,

```
    sage: _.Strchr()
```
the doctesting framework thinks that `_` still refers to the result of the call to `write`. I would say this is a bug in the doctesting framework. To get around it, I used a double underscore on line 187 (and the previous few lines) in `lib/pari/tests.py`.
