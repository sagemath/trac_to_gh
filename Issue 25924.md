# Issue 25924: Refine polynomial quotient rings to the finite subcategory on initialization

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26161

Original creator: saraedum

Original creation time: 2018-08-30 00:33:45

Currently, the following test would not pass:

```
sage: R.<x> = GF(2)[]
sage: S = R.quo(x)
sage: S in FiniteFields()
True
sage: type(S).mro()
...
 <class 'sage.categories.finite_fields.FiniteFields.parent_class'>,
...
```


In other words, a finite polynomial quotient ring that is a field does not inherit `ParentElements` of the category of finite fields.

This is now failing (see also patchbot reports)

```
sage: R1.<x> = GF(5)[]
sage: F1 = R1.quotient_ring(x^2+x+1)
sage: R2.<x> = F1[]
sage: F2 = R2.quotient_ring(x^2+x+1)
```

I fixed the failing doctests and tried to cleanup some of the error messages that I stumbled upon. Doctests in rings/ pass for me now, let's see what the patchbot thinks.

Looks fine to me.
