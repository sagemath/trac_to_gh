Even if you hack in the missing(?) `__debug` header, the gcc bootstrap in Sage will fail.

I didn't run into this. Was it because I wasn't doing a debug build?

This is without doing anything special. It might only be triggered if you only have command line tools without the gui xcode part. Though with the gui xcode stuff you just hit other bugs.

Xcode 6.3.1 was released, but gcc still won't build for me. (This is with both the gui part and the command line tools installed.) In particular, the bootstrap fails.

should we check for the version of Xcode, too?
(this patch is not needed on Xcode <= 6.2)

```
xcodebuild -version | grep XCode
```

will output something like

```
XCode a.b.c
```

So this is just a bit of shell scripting. If you like I can do this.

Like buck I am all to keep it simple. We already have a few blanket statements for 10.10, we should just add it there. I am expecting the percentage of people staying behind to be low. You need a specific reason not to upgrade rather than the reverse (although I have to agree that apple continuously breaking things is a good motivation).

I actually meant for all OSX, as jhp was asking.

Putting as much configuration outside of if-statements as possible means less edges to the state space; it makes it more likely that everyone can reproduce the same set of bugs.

indeed, particularly given Apple's non-support of anything older than OSX 10.10, I see the point; it could also happen that they eventually push the same broken llvm version into XCode for older OSX versions...
