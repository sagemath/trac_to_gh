Everything looks fine, SPKG.txt has been updated, all local changes are committed, all tests pass on the two computers I have access to.

Well, ... `:-)`

Hmmmmmmmmmmmm `O_o`

Sorry, but I actually get a doctest error "from time to time". Often, actually, but not always. Here it is :


```
sage -t -long -optional "devel/sage-main/sage/sat/solvers/cryptominisat/solverconf.pyx"

Looks like a bug in CryptoMiniSat's copy constructor or how we use it. I worked around it.

spkg is on the server and soon on the  mirrors - and double checked that the directory is correct :-)
