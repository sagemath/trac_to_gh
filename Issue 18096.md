This is a task ticket for speed up cleaning in `sage.rings.qqbar`

- #18332: implement `is_integer` and `is_rational` on number field elements
- #18303: better comparisons
- implement `unique_sign` and `unique_trunc` on interval field elements and use it for faster `sign`/`floor`/`ceil`/`trunc`/`round` on algebraic elements

There's an issue on QQBar element powering reported in [#18836 comment 9](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18836#comment:9) that may have interaction with what you're doing here (perhaps you're solving the issue?). Perhaps it's worthwhile including that problem in this QQbar cleanup operation somewhere.
