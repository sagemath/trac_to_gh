There's an issue on QQBar element powering reported in [#18836 comment 9](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18836#comment:9) that may have interaction with what you're doing here (perhaps you're solving the issue?). Perhaps it's worthwhile including that problem in this QQbar cleanup operation somewhere.
