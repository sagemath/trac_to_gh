# Issue 14157: Make the palp spkg cleaner

Issue created by migration from Trac.

The current 2.1.p1 spkg builds the sources several times with different
settings by patching the sources each time.

The proposed 2.1.p2 spkg patches once, then changes the settings by modifying
the C flags.

The one patch has been forwarded upstream, as it makes sense.

The "new spkg style" is to store all of Sage's code in SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs.
