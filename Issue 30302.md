These packages have yet to be merged in void linux, I will update the ticked once they're merged.

This is not coming from the changes on this ticket, but I am getting:

```
$ tox -e docker-voidlinux-standard
...
Unable to locate 'r' in repository pool.
```

Comment by @dkwo created at 2020-09-17 15:36:01

The correct name is R, not r.
Probably my mistake.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-09-18 04:19:25

Fixed that, but it does not use it because it cannot find `gfortran`. Package missing?

On my machine I have 'libgfortran-devel', can you add that as well?

There are still LOTS of packages missing...

Can you add the attached file to the branch?
Currently, on my machine, when building beta13 I'm missing only:

arb brial cddlib cliquer coxeter3 eclib fflas_ffpack flint flintqs fplll gfan givaro gp2c iml lcalc libbraiding libgd libnauty libsemigroups lrcalc m4ri m4rie
mpfi nauty ntl palp perl_cpan_polymake_prereq planarity rw suitesparse symmetrica sympow tachyon zn_poly

Can you test again on docker?

I'm puzzled by python, giac, etc: all these should not be built.
I forgot to add freetype-devel:

config.log would be helpful. I guess some Python3 tests fail, e.g. wrong minor version, or no distutils.core, or...

Sure, I attached void.more​. I have to think why it is not behaving as on my machine.
Are you generating a new docker image every time, and then use 

```
xbps-install -S <name of pack>
```

 ?

I attached config.log from my machine. Only difference should be with isl and gf2x, which are not in repository and I built myself.

indeed, it's fine on your machine:

```
configure:37915: result: python3-3.8.5:                               using system package; SPKG will not be installed

Yes, a build from scratch every time. This is all automated via `tox -e docker-voidlinux-standard`

Is it possible to issue ` xbps-install -Su ` at the beginning, and install packages with ` xbps-install -S <pkg> ` (the `-S` being syncronise)?
If we still get different results, we could try manually installing all the packages I have on my machine?
