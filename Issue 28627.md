any idea of what the problem could be ? some problem for empty shape, maybe ?


---

Comment by mantepse created at 2019-12-13 08:15:18

Essentially the problem is (very very likely) that there is a new collection on findstat.org (skew partitions), which is not reflected in the sage interface (yet).

Very unfortunately, findstat.org itself has (technical) problems which I was unable to resolve so far.

On top of that, investing time into the old code is going to delay the deployment of the new and shiny and proper api for the website even further, although it is almost done (since an embarassingly long time).

One way to speed up the process would be to decide to drop support for the old way to access findstat completely.  This would mean that, that I would switch findstat.org and the sage interface to the new api simultaneously, and that old versions of sage could not use findstat anymore.  I doubt that this is a very good idea, but it is a possibility.


---

Comment by mantepse created at 2020-01-02 06:56:41

a brief update:

* I am now finished with implementing a proper api on the server side of FindStat, it is currently in testing - findstat.org itself is using this api since 31.12.2019.

* My next task is to rewrite the sage-findstat interface, I will use this as a testcase to check whether the api is well designed.  I intend to publish the api and the new interface at the same time.

In the meantime, the sage interface should be fully functional.

Here are some first comments:

  Would it be possible to automatize this? Otherwise, every user will see this on startup and likely get confused.

* I would prefer a single entry point (maybe `FindStat` with `FindStat.find_statistic` and `FindStat.find_map`?). If I know `findstat` but not `findmap`, I might completely miss the latter? Also, using `FindStat?` would immediately give instructions how to proceed.

* (This is not for this ticket but for the backend:) Queries from the interface are not yet logged in the findstat log.

* `41: St001489oMp00081oMp00059 (quality [100, 100])` The term `quality` is not obviously explained. In the doc, it might be referred to as "a number which says how many values...". a proper definition of this quality might be helpful.

* The term `distribution` is not explained how to be used in the input section of `findstat`: it is twice referred to as "distribution must be None".

* It remains unclear (I think, to a new user) what "a new statistic" means. I would suggest to not show this as one of the "results" of a `DababaseQuery`. Instead, I would suggest to have this available as a method `submit_as_new_statistic`. 
  * This method fails if the input datum is not a statistic (but a distribution).
  * If there is no result, the user gets prompted a message that this method is available in case she wants to submit the data.

* The term `offset` is not exlained, is it?

* What about two methods `matching values` and `unmatched_values` ?
  * Each of these could consist of lists of pairs of the form `( ( elt1, elt2, elt3 ), val )`.

* Finally: Since the output might be long and confusing, I think it would be great if `FindStatMatchingStatistic` had a method `info` or `detailed_info` or alike which would in detail present this match:

  {{{
  sage: A = findstat("Permutations", distribution = lambda pi: pi.number_of_descents())
  sage: a = A[37]; a

Unfortunately, support of new collections cannot be made automatic.  However, a new collection appears possibly once a year, so it shouldn't be a big problem.  I cleaned the message a bit.

 > * I would prefer a single entry point (maybe `FindStat` with `FindStat.find_statistic` and `FindStat.find_map`?). If I know `findstat` but not `findmap`, I might completely miss the latter? Also, using `FindStat?` would immediately give instructions how to proceed.

No, I don't want to do this.  If you discover `findstat`, I am sure you will discover `findstat`, too.  Introducing a new layer introduces more typing with very little benefit - it is extremely unlikely that there will be a third item analogous to `findstat` and `findmap`.  To get the tutorial, `sage.databases.findstat?` suffices, as with all of sage.
 
> * `41: St001489oMp00081oMp00059 (quality [100, 100])` The term `quality` is not obviously explained. In the doc, it might be referred to as "a number which says how many values...". a proper definition of this quality might be helpful.

The quality is explained in the tutorial, but I agree it should also be explained in `findstat?` and `findmap?`.  Patches welcome.

> * The term `distribution` is not explained how to be used in the input section of `findstat`: it is twice referred to as "distribution must be None".

Indeed, the documentation of `findstat` and `findmap` still needs to be improved.

> * It remains unclear (I think, to a new user) what "a new statistic" means. I would suggest to not show this as one of the "results" of a `DababaseQuery`. Instead, I would suggest to have this available as a method `submit_as_new_statistic`.

Done, with the exception of failing for "distributions", because it is not clear when to fail exactly.  I think it is better (and easier) to allow submission in case of doubt.

> * The term `offset` is not exlained, is it?

It is now in the tutorial, but should also be explained by `findstat?`

> * What about two methods `matching values` and `unmatched_values` ?
>   * Each of these could consist of lists of pairs of the form `( ( elt1, elt2, elt3 ), val )`.

That's non-trivial, and I'd therefore like not to do it now. 

> * Finally: Since the output might be long and confusing, I think it would be great if `FindStatMatchingStatistic` had a method `info` or `detailed_info` or alike which would in detail present this match:

done.

I just tried this for the first time and get

```
sage: findstat(3)
<repr(<sage.databases.findstat.FindStatStatistics_with_category.element_class at 0x1be3bcfc0>) failed: requests.exceptions.SSLError: Can't connect to HTTPS URL because the SSL module is not available.>
```

What do I do?

It appears that `openssl` is not installed on macOS Catalina:

```
sage: import ssl
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Kathrin!  I'm afraid I can't help you here (I am unfamiliar with macOS), maybe you can ask on sage-devel or sage-support.  Did you try whether `oeis([1,2,5,14,42])` works?

Here is a (very stupid) workaround - but you absolutely have to fix openssl support:

```
sage: from sage.databases.findstat import FINDSTAT_URL
sage: sage.databases.findstat.FINDSTAT_URL = 'http://www.findstat.org/'
```



---

Comment by @kathrin2006 created at 2020-01-28 08:53:56

Hi,
unfortunately neither `oeis([1,2,5,14,42])` nor your workaround worked.

I even tried

```
sage -i pip openssl
```

now but without any new result.

Installing openssl should be followed by `sage -f python` that will rebuild all of sage.

Is the following a bug?

```
sage: sts = findstat("DyckPaths", [ ( list(DyckWords(n)), [inner_trians(T,n+2) for T in trians(n+2)] ) for n in [2 .. 5] ])
sage: sts.submit()

   2319         else:
   2320             url = FINDSTAT_NEWSTATISTIC_FORM_HEADER % (FINDSTAT_URL_EDIT_STATISTIC + self.id_str())
-> 2321         _submit(args, url)
   2322 
   2323     # editing and submitting is really the same thing

/home/stumpcl2/Programs/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/databases/findstat.py in _submit(args, url)
    443     verbose("Created temporary file %s" % f.name, caller_name='FindStat')
    444     f.write(FINDSTAT_POST_HEADER)
--> 445     if not int(id_str[2:]):
    446         f.write(url_header % url_new)
    447     else:

NameError: name 'id_str' is not defined
```


Also, `submit_as_new_statistic` is more explicit than `submit`. The docstring says "Open the FindStat web page for editing the statistic in a browser." even though this data is not an existing statistic that can be edited.

The docstring of the method `quality` does not explain the tuple of two integers. Should it?

python3 says:

```
inside file:  b/src/sage/databases/findstat.py
@@ -171,13 +205,12 @@ Classes and methods
+from six import string_types
Python3 incompatible code inserted on 1 non-empty lines
```

Is there a more python3 way to import it? Maybe among:

```
sage: import_statements('string_types')                                         
# **Warning**: distinct objects with name 'string_types' in:
#   - ipython_genutils.py3compat
#   - pexpect.utils
#   - pickleshare
#   - pygments.filters
#   - pygments.formatter
#   - pygments.formatters.html
#   - pygments.util
#   - six
#   - traitlets.utils.importstring
# ** Warning **: several modules for the object (<class 'str'>,): pygments.filters, pygments.formatter, pygments.formatters.html, pygments.util
from pygments.util import string_types
```


Also pyflakes still says:

```
src/sage/combinat/decorated_permutation.py:23:1 'sage.misc.classcall_metaclass.ClasscallMetaclass' imported but unused

found 1 pyflakes errors in the modified files
```

Is it really unused?

Hi Sébastien!

Thank you for looking into this!

Do you happen to know the replacement for `string_types`?  (The interface was incredibly sensitive to str-unicode issues in the past, which is why I'm a bit hesitant.)

now that sage is python3 only, we should not use six at all. Use `str`

And use the python3 syntax for metaclass. `git grep` will help you to find existing examples.

Concerning metaclass: isn't

```
class FindStatMap(Element,
                  FindStatFunction,
                  FindStatCombinatorialMap,
                  metaclass=InheritComparisonClasscallMetaclass):
```

correct?

I replaced `string_types` with `str`

python3 + pyflakes now ok. Doc builds ok (according to patchbot). All normal test passed on patchbot (except a unrelated singular error). All tests including internet pass on my machine for the file findstat. Positive review.
