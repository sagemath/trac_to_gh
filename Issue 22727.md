I understand that this is still work in progress and not ready for reviewing. However, to privide input early, here are some comments from my pre-review:

1. `tmp`: this (empty) directory seems to be added to the repository

k_regular_sequence.py:
2. L921 is_bounded: needs a docstring. As this is the main calling function,
   it should contain for sure some illustrative examples.
   A reference to the boundedness-file should also be given.
1. L1457: three newlines were added for no reason; delete them

k_regular_sequence_bounded.py:
4. everywhere: be consistent in the OUTPUT-block with full-stop at the end.
1. L4: I would here say something like

```
   "This module contains a collection
   of algorithms to check for boundedness".
```

  and then continue maybe with

```
   "This is done
    - based on eigenvalues and
    - by the criterion presented in [MS1977]."
```

1. L19: I think since some time now, we have a separate file for the actual
   references.
2. L35: Consider not using your student mail address as it will not be
   there forever...
3. L44: Rename to something with a more descriptive name (as it is not
   a private function), e.g.
   `multiply_and_reduce` or `multiply_reduce`
4. L44: maybe mention that this function is used in the `mandel_simon_algorithm`
5. L87: I think "Return the set `\phi(S)` as defined in [MS1977]." suffices.
6. L144: use `red_matrices` instead of `redMatrices`; the same for `redLength`.
   Camel-case is used only for class names.
7. L143+144: `length` is only used once and there it could be more Pythonic:
   `redMatrics = list(M.apply(...) for M in matrices)` 
8. construct_phi: I think it is more efficients if at the beginning each matrix
   in redMatrices is `set_immutable` and then a `set` is used instead of the list.
   This also would simplify the code:
   `redMatrice.update(red_mult(B, A) for A in redMatrices for B in matrices)`
9. L147: You can use `for counter in range(1000000): ... else: raise RuntimeError(...)`, which simplifies the code.
10. L159: a more descriptive (not code-technical descriptive) error message
   would be nice.
11. L162+168: `is_integer_valued` and `is_non_negative` need docstrings
12. L172: Maybe the name of this function should be altered to reflect what
   it does better: E.g. `is_bounded_via_mandel_simon_algorithm` or
   a shortened version of this or something similar.

18. L202: Maybe rename to `has_bounded_matrix_powers`. If so, an ALGORITHM-block could be included which says that the eigenvalues are used for this check.
19. L216: You can write normal text in between doctests, so no need to use comments by `#`.
20. L247: IMO the following is a bit cleaner:

```
    return all(abs(eVn[0]) < 1 or
               (abs(eVn[0]) == 1 and len(eVn[1]) == eVn[2])
               for mat in matrices
               for eVn in mat.eigenvectors_right())
```

1. L257: docstring is missing
2. L257: The following avoids using the index:

```
def do(mat):
        if is_non_negative(mat):
            return mat
        elif is_non_negative(-mat):
            return -mat
        else:
            raise ValueError('there is a matrix which is neither non-negative nor non-positive.')

return list(do(mat) for mat in matrices)
```

1. L274: full-stop missing
2. L275: I would delete this line, but add a note/comment after the OUTPUT-block
   that an exception may be raised (have a look in the developer guide on
   how the docstring should look like; there were some recent changes)

Thank you very much for your precise comments!!!
Just some minor questions:

Replying to [comment:9 dkrenn]:
> 2. L921 is_bounded: needs a docstring. As this is the main calling function, it should contain for sure some illustrative examples. A reference to the boundedness-file should also be given.
Absolutely true. Are the same examples as in k_regular_sequence_is_bounded okay? 
> 6. L19: I think since some time now, we have a separate file for the actual
>   references.
What do you mean here?

> 11. L144: use `red_matrices` instead of `redMatrices`; the same for `redLength`.
>   Camel-case is used only for class names.
Sorry, but can't find the names in my code...
> 13. construct_phi: I think it is more efficients if at the beginning each matrix in redMatrices is `set_immutable` and then a `set` is used instead of the list. This also would simplify the code: `redMatrice.update(red_mult(B, A) for A in redMatrices for B in matrices)`
Absolutely true, but is there a possibility to multiply immutable matrices? 
> 16. L162+168: `is_integer_valued` and `is_non_negative` need docstrings
Also here: It seems that you do not have my lastest commits.
> 18. L174: replace `special semigroup` by something that says a bit more, 
>   e.g. {{{whether the semigroup of all possible products of ``matrices``
>   is finite/bounded.}}}. In particular do not write

Also done in my latest commits.
> 21. L195: I would raise a `ValueError('Not all matrix entries are nonnegative.')`
Not sure where exactly do you mean (lines in lasts commits are different).
> 31. L308: Code needs some cleanup.
Also here not sure where exactly.

The rest is already or will be done and committed soon!
(No need for a new review by now, will soon be reviewed by me again.)

> Absolutely true, but is there a possibility to multiply immutable matrices? 
After getting rid of the mutable/immutable troubles after multiplication (see ticket #23436) by hand, the following problem accured:

```
RuntimeError: Set changed size during iteration.
```

The set is updated by taking matrix A out of the set...

  - I would delete `(if decidable with this implementation)`
  - delete INPUT-block
  - some SageMath-people would say that even an OUTPUT-block is not needed
    as it is clear from the one-line description that a boolean is returned.
  - Some lines are ended with a white space; delete this.
  - In the examples, when continuing a line, try to properly indent (e.g. look
    at the parentheses).
  - I would move the SEEALSO-block before the TESTS-block.

file `k_regular_sequence_bounded.py`

- everywhere: do not end lines with a white space
- L49: Add a empty line after the one-line description.
- L49: `Used in...` is not a proper sentence. Use e.g. `This function is used...`
- L95: indent
- I think `<BLANKLINE>` can be replaced by an actual blank line and the tests
  still pass.
- L251: Maybe put `using a criterion in [MS1977]` in an ALGORITHM-block
- L256: indent
- L288: `input` (small first letter)
- L313: ALGORTHIHM block should be after OUTPUT-block
- L321: EXAMPLES instead of TEST
- L323 and others: `max(abs(eigenvalues)) = 1, multiplicities okay:` If you
  write a text, then do it correctly. Do not indent it, and of you have pieces
  of code, then use ````.
- L362: full stop
- L427: Thue--Morse (use `--`); change this also in `k_regular_sequence.py`.

I see. I think

```
redMatrice.update([red_mult(B, A) for A in redMatrices for B in matrices])
```

should work (making it a list (or tuple) before updating).
