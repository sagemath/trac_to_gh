Looks good to me, and passes tests on the new beta. (I've just spent a whole day of my life doctesting this module -- see #12662 -- so I feel confident to pass judgement on patches to it.)

This is far from being critical but

```
Verify that Trac #12727 is fixed:: 
```

could be better written as

```
Verify that :trac:`12727` is fixed:: 
```

which setup the link !

William's patch but with whitespace removed

Attachment

Apply trac_12727-whitespace-removed.patch

William's patch had trailing whitespace on one line, which the patchbot didn't like. Other than that it's fine -- I extend my positive review to this new patch.
