1) **Design** 

- the min-plus convention is standard ? I thought it was max-plus. I think that it might be an option of the ring to chose between min and max.

- Why did you choose to base it on real fields ? It seems more like a wrapper that call `+` and `max` (or `min`) appropriately. What if I want tropical integers ? Tropical real intervals ? (note: I do want those).

- It would be better to call `x.min(y)` (optimized mpfr stuff) instead of `min(x,y)` (Python generic stuff)

- For sake of optimization you should implement a `cdef _new` method that duplicate the object instead of calling `self.__class__(my_parent, my_new_value)`. It is the way it is for most cythonized elements.

2) **Documentation** the file is not included in the documentation. Moreover it might be nice to have more examples in the headers of the file (with a link to :wikipedia:Tropical_geometry... actually it might be a good idea to rewrite the wikipedia article ;-)

3) **Question** Do you know how I can build a tropical matrix ?

Hey Vincent,

Thanks for the review. According to the wiki, its min-plus, but of course, this is/should not be the standard. However, half the tropical talks I go to are min, half are max. I'll change things around to allow the users to have a choice. I based it on the reals since I've only every seen it as such and to avoid having to check if the base ring has a total order (which is the only thing we really need and I don't know how to check that). I will just let it use any base ring and put warnings in the doc. I'll also include your other changes.

For tropical matrices, this should be the same as tropical polynomials, they aren't there (yet). We will see if making the base ring input arbitrary will make it work. I'll let you know when an updated patch is posted. [Edit: I should actually say I haven't tried, but I'm assuming tropical matrix multiplication becomes matrix addition, so it should break.

If you have a semi-ring `R`, you can always consider `R^n` and linear applications on it (here `ax+by` means `max(a+x,b+y)` or `min(a+x,b+y)`). But, be careful, matrix multiplication does not become matrix addition: it is composition of the corresponding linear applications. Right now, Sage is not happy with matrices with entries in a semi-ring

```
sage: matrix(ZZ,[[0,1],[2,3]])   # no problem
[0 1]
[2 3]
sage: matrix(NN,[[0,1],[2,3]])   # BOOM!
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Invalid matrix constructor.  Type matrix? for help
```

If you know how to fix it easily it would be **wonderful**. Otherwise, I will have to work to play with my max-plus matrices.

```

So just to make sure, you want tropical operations being performed with regular matrix multiplication, i.e.

```
[a b] * [c] = min(a+c, b+d)
        [d]
```

Which makes more sense, I was thinking of the set of all `n x m` matrices over a [totally ordered] ring R where the `min` would be the minimum of all the entries.

In general, creating a matrix space requires something in the category of `Rings`:

```
sage: MatrixSpace(NN, 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: base_ring (=Non negative integer semiring) must be a ring
```

(which is the same reason why the `matrix()` constructor fails). We could probably loosen the restriction to the `Semirings` category since we still have a `+` and `*`.

Best,

Travis

This is it. I found another wikpedia page that describes it :wikipedia:Max-plus_algebra (as the name suggests it is max and not min).

Hi Travis,

I'm going to review this (at least mathematically) in the next time, but one question first: does TropicalSemiring(R) really work only for rings R as the doc says, or also for ordered additive groups R (as it should imho)? I'm just not seeing where in the code it uses multiplication (and I hope it does not).

(Also I see a typo "parituclar".)

Thanks a lot for the code; it's coming very handy for what I'm doing these days!

Best regards,
Darij
