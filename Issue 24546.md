# Issue 24546: py3: minor fixes in sage.interfaces

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24783

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-02-19 17:16:32

Minor Python 3 fixes to different modules in `sage.interfaces`.  These were all small and discrete enough to be combined--most are moving `open()` calls to `with` statements to prevent `ResourceWarning`s in tests.

Wouldn't it be useful to check that files are properly closed? At least the module `psutil` can be used to list the opened ones.

How come clicking on the branch field in this ticket and looking at the diff tells me that `gap.py` and `qepcad.py` were deleted?

I don't know. Weird. I'll try rebasing.

Should be better now.  Might be the old merge preview was corrupted somehow.

*sigh* I literally rebased this not 24 hours ago...

Sorry for this double rebasing! I really hope that we will switch to a smoother integration process for tickets!

Not your (or anyone else's) fault.  Actually this is the sort of case that would not as easily be fixed by a smoother integration process--it was just an example of one ticket being merged first that this one conflicted with, and that's perfectly normal and sometimes unavoidable (though cases like that will be caught more quickly with more regular merging...)  I was just needlessly exasperated!
