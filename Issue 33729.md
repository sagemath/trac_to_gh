# Issue 33729: KnotInfo interface returns wrong braid_notation for the unknot

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33966

Original creator: soehms

Original creation time: 2022-06-09 16:40:50

The original database does not provide a value for the `braid_notation` of the unknot. Thus this value has been set individually in the interface, but unfortunately this value corresponds to a disjoint union of two unknots. This bug remained unnoticed because the construction of a link from a braid in Sage erases all additional unknots.
