The patchbot calls 

```
  handle = urllib2.urlopen(url, timeout=5)
```

in `trac.py` instead of using the configurable timeout. If you have many dependencies then the probability that one takes 5 seconds to retrieve can get close to 100%...

what list of packages? ah, well. i have no idea what this script really does or is supposed to do. i ran it again and it works.

maybe it does create two entries, if there are two versions (and it archives the older one). in the second pass, the old one was no longer there.
