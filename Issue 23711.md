Keywords: sd91

This ticket adds a method `has_cyclotomic_factor` for polynomials, which returns True if and only if the polynomial has a nontrivial factor which is a cyclotomic polynomial (i.e., if and only if at least one root of the polynomial is a root of unity).

This is an offshoot of #23946.
