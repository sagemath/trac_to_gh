# Issue 23711: has_cyclotomic_factor for polynomials

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23948

Original creator: kedlaya

Original creation time: 2017-10-01 03:33:47

Keywords: sd91

This ticket adds a method `has_cyclotomic_factor` for polynomials, which returns True if and only if the polynomial has a nontrivial factor which is a cyclotomic polynomial (i.e., if and only if at least one root of the polynomial is a root of unity).

This is an offshoot of #23946.

For the record, all tests passed on k8s. (There was a failure in `src/sage/repl/configuration.py` which was unreproducible, so I'm treating it as spurious.)

Weird, I didn't get a merge conflict just now. Anyway, see if this helps.

Sorry, I haven't been able to reproduce the merge conflict. Would it be possible to provide more details?

Presumably it's with the next beta, so we'll need to wait until that comes out.
