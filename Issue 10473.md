# Issue 10473: plot option gridlines='minor' broken

Keywords: plot, grid, gridlines, matplotlib


```
plot(x,(x,0,10),gridlines='minor')
```

This does not implicitly add major gridlines.

gridlines='minor' was not checked properly.  Now plots both minor and major gridlines (because it passes 'both' to matplotlib instead of 'minor')

The following is a cleaner solution, in my opinion:


```
             if hgridlines=="minor":
                hgridstyle['which']="both"
             if vgridlines=="minor":
                vgridstyle['which']="both
```

I don't think we want to do that.  It won't let us set the gridlines independently.  Say we want minor horizontal ticks and major vertical ticks.  We only want to set both when _both_ are 'minor'
