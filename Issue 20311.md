The aim is to have the doctests pass when adding a global `future print` import in sage/all.py.

For that, all the backends where something was needed were modified.

You can check this by adding `from __future__ import print_function` in `src/sage/all.py` on top of this branch and running all the tests in the numerical folder.

If you want to take the opportunity to convert everything else to python3 print style in the numerical folder, please do.
