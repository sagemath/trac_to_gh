In addition it would seem that `attach()` and `load_attach_path()` from `src/sage/repl/attach.py` are not working as intended. The following segments of code produce the same result when a `test.py` is present in the folder from where tests are run.

With an empty `test.py` present in SAGE_ROOT


```
sage: load_attach_path()
['.']
sage: t_dir = tmp_dir()
sage: fname = 'test.py'
sage: fullpath = os.path.join(t_dir, fname)
sage: with open(fullpath, 'w') as f:
....:     _ = f.write("print(37 * 3)")
....:     
sage: load_attach_path(t_dir)
sage: attach(fname)
sage:
```


and without the `load_attach_path(t_dir)`

```
sage: load_attach_path()
['.']
sage: t_dir = tmp_dir()
sage: fname = 'test.py'
sage: fullpath = os.path.join(t_dir, fname)
sage: with open(fullpath, 'w') as f:
....:     _ = f.write("print(37 * 3)")
....:     
sage: attach(fname)
sage:
```

At least in the first instance we should get

```
sage: attach(fname)
111
```

which can be confirmed by running the code with `test.py` removed.

Replying to [comment:2 embray]:
> The test should probably change directories into the temp directory.
I just noticed that `load_attach_path()` has two arguments. Perhaps part of the problem is that we should have

```
load_attach_path(t_dir, replace='True')
```

The default is `replace='False'` and the paths are appended.
