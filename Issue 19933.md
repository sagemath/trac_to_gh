# Issue 19933: Implement reflections for affine Weyl groups

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20170

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2016-03-05 23:18:08

Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  sage-combinat nthiery chapoton stumpc5 jipilab

Keywords: reflections, Weyl groups

The code just needs to be slightly modified in order to support affine Weyl groups since we have a method to generate all positive real roots.
