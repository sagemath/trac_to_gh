networkx uses scipy data types which go away in scipy 2.0, so they started to do  deprecation warnings. (fixed in networkx trunk, but not in 2.4 release)

for scipy 1.4 (cf #29425 - which is a dependency of this ticket!) I chose to
suppress these warnings in a Pythonic way, rather than doing patching already done by upstream (just not yet released)

Minor (perhaps trivial) point, but pulling it from that link gave a zip file named `networkx-networkx-2.4.zip`, which caused it to fail without manually downloading and naming the tarball correctly.


With this ticket, I get two deprecation warnings in `generic_graph.py` on these two tests:

```
File "src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py", line 9786, in sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.?
Failed example:
    G.pagerank(algorithm="Scipy") # abs tol 1e-9

File "src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py", line 9793, in sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.?
Failed example:
    G.pagerank(algorithm="Scipy", by_weight=True) # abs tol 1e-9
```

I don't quite understand what "pulling it from that link" means. The idea of 
`upstream_url` in `checksum.ini` is to allow automatic download of the package archive from that URL. (which can either be enabled with `-o`, as follows, `./sage -i -o networkx` of if one runs `./configure` with `--enable-download-from-upstream-url` option).

Okay, I tried with just `make` instead of directly with `sage -i` (which worked by itself when I did this on another spkg previously), so maybe that is why it didn't work. I was just thinking it came from the zip file having an unexpected name.

`module='.*(scipy|networkx)'` suppresses deprecation warnings emitted by code in `scipy` or in `networkx`. It does not do anything to these warnings from Sage code itself.
Indeed, the tests in `src/sage/tests/deprecation_test.py` still pass.
