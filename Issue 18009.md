> Why does `UniqueRepresentation` have to come before `Parent`?

Because `UniqueRepresentation` provides a hash that is fast and appropriate and `Parent` doesn't:

```
sage: Parent.__hash__
<slot wrapper '__hash__' of 'sage.structure.category_object.CategoryObject' objects>
sage: UniqueRepresentation.__hash__
<slot wrapper '__hash__' of 'sage.misc.fast_methods.WithEqualityById' objects>
```

In order to get the MRO right, `UniqueRepresentation` needs to appear before Parent:

```
sage: class A(UniqueRepresentation, Parent): pass
sage: A.__hash__
<slot wrapper '__hash__' of 'sage.misc.fast_methods.WithEqualityById' objects>
sage: class B(Parent, UniqueRepresentation): pass
sage: B.__hash__
<slot wrapper '__hash__' of 'sage.structure.category_object.CategoryObject' objects>
```


Once all default hashes have been deleted and no classes in the MRO of Parent offer a hash function, the order doesn't matter. Until then, `UniqueRepresentation` has to come first.

> Also can someone explain to me why are `RiggedConfigurations` now showing machine dependent iteration order?

The code is hard to follow, but in general, if enumeration somewhere involves a set or a dictionary, then results depend heavily on the hash used and the order in which the dictionary was constructed. I'd expect that a changed hash causes things to be enumerated in a different order (because a set or dict is storing its entries in a different order somewhere)
