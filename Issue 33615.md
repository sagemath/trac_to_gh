CC:  jhpalmieri @tobiasdiez mjo dimpase fbissey

We change the `bootstrap` scripts so that they invoke `build/bin/sage-package` directly instead of going through the `SAGE_ROOT/sage` script.

This is faster and also more robust because it separates build phases better by eliminating the (unnecessary) use of `configure`-generated files such as `src/bin/sage-src-env-config`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33852

Thank you for reminding me of some essentials :) I'd like to brush it off as it being too early in the morning to make a proper comment but I think that's just part of a pattern where I am too deep on the packager side, and thinking of workflow in which ultimately, makefile such as this one are "single use", and when something doesn't work you just restart from the top because you need the flow to be right.
