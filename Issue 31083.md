more data

```
sage: cm = coercion_model
sage: cm.explain(Frac(QQ['t']), LaurentPolynomialRing(CC,'t'))                  
Coercion on right operand via
    Conversion via converter map:
      From: Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in t over Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
      To:   Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
Arithmetic performed after coercions.
Result lives in Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.

Subtle, but a good catch. Green bot => positive review.

I had to change the correction, but now the bot is green.

The issue was about the existence of a morphism from Laurent[t]/QQ to Frac(ZZ[t]).

May I switch to positive ?

By the way, thanks a lot for your reviews, Travis. Domo arigato.

No problem. Thank you for all your work on improving Sage, especially the code and doc polishing.
