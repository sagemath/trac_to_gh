# Issue 18593: implement Lovasz theta-function for graphs

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Use a dedicated SDP solver from csdp for this problem to compute the well-known  [Lovasz theta-function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lov%C3%A1sz_number)  for graphs.

Helloooooo Dima,

There is a LovaZS at the head of your new module. Also, could you check that csdp is installed with a 'is_package_installed("csdp")' and raise a meaningful exception otherwise?

Could you also provide a couple of sentences to explain, in the documentation of `lovasz_theta`, what exactly this function is? This will become a method of `Graph` and well, we usually give those kind of explanations there. Depending on how verbose you feel, it can be just a link toward the relevant wikipedia page `:wikipedia:`LovÃ¡sz_number``.

Thaaaaaanks,

Nathann

Hellooooo Dima!

I added a small commit at #18830, that mostly does text reformatting. Some accents, a shorter name for the module, a different import, making the first sentence of a docstring a one-line one, things like that.

If you agree with this, you can set this ticket to `positive_review`. Meanwhile, I'll be walking toward the lab `:-D`
