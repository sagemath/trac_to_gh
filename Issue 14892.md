If we want to automatically update the "Commit" field then we have to be able to identify the ticket given the "Branch". Here is a quick trac plugin to search for "Branch", returning only exact matches. Both via webui and trac xmlrpc.

Also, it would be nice if the "Commit" field would ellipsize itself since it tends to be a long non-breakable string. We should add something like

```
	text-overflow: ellipsis;
	overflow: hidden;
```

to the `h_commit` CSS. See this ticket for an example.
