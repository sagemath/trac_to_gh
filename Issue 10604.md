# Issue 10604: options for items in a GraphicsArray() should be set independently

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10657

Original creator: niles

Original creation time: 2011-01-18 18:13:32

Assignee: jason, was

CC:  kcrisman paulmasson chapoton

Keywords: GraphicsArray, matplotlib

In particular, one ought to be able to specify `axes=True/False` on a per-graphic basis, if desired.

Currently, the following results in 8 plots with axes, and a text frame which also has axes, even though `axes=False` is explicitly given.


```
A = [plot(sin(t+k*pi/4),(-pi,pi)) for k in range(8)] + [text('hello world',(0,0), axes=False)]
graphics_array(A,3,3)
```


See the post at asksage about [this issue](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/308/can-i-convert-a-graphicsarray-object-to-a-graphics) for more details.

Changing type from PLEASE CHANGE to defect.

This is also a problem with other options, such as tick_formatter, ticks, and axes_labels. They are only applied to the last graphic; see attached image produced by the following code:



```
graphics_array([plot(sin(B*x), xmin=-2*pi, xmax=2*pi, tick_formatter=pi, ticks=pi/2, axes_labels=('', '%s'%B)) for B in [-2,-1,-1/2,1/2,1,2]], 3, 2)
```

#12591 is this.  I'm going to suggest we keep this ticket for the original issue, though clearly they are related.

Workaround from [sage-support](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/a82JS6j6R-k/discussion):

```
p = plot(x, axes_labels=['x', 'x'])
q = plot(x^2, axes_labels=['x', 'x^2'])
r = plot(exp, axes_labels=['x', 'exp'])
# We want the order p,q,r; so we start with cyclic shifts 
graphics_array([q, r, p]).show() # cyclic permutation
graphics_array([r, p, q]).show() # cyclic permutation of above
graphics_array([p, q, r]).show() # another shift to get our order.
```

Somewhere in this set of related tickets we should also unify the usage of `figsize` between graphics objects and graphics arrays.  Maybe graphics arrays need to be a separate file eventually..

[Here is another report](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/24597/axis-labels-title-on-graphs-in-graphics_array/), by a seasoned Sage user.

This should include setting axes for each plot; currently you can just set them all at once...

Okay, the problem seems to be that we use the matplotlib save command for each (sub)figure, which doesn't seem to set them, but then the _Sage_ save command for the very last one - which gives it the options as well as puts the image in the right file to appear.  At #12591 there is some work at fixing a related issue that is basically the same bug, but fixing them _together_ will be a little tricky, though a good thing in the long run.

[This post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/WuFylKEr1PM) is probably also the same thing.

[Here is](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/MQcezJRgz9s) yet another example.

[This example](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/38271/graphics-array-without-ticks/) is probably the same thing.

See also #10466, which I think is probably the same thing too.

And [another one](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/39334/programmatically-setting-ticks/).

The issues described here are fixed in #27865.


---

Comment by egourgoulhon created at 2019-07-08 20:30:38

Since #27865 has been merged in Sage 8.9.beta0, we could close this ticket as duplicate.

Comment by egourgoulhon created at 2019-07-08 20:30:38

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Resolution: fixed
