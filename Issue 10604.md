Assignee: jason, was

CC:  @kcrisman @paulmasson @fchapoton

Keywords: GraphicsArray, matplotlib

In particular, one ought to be able to specify `axes=True/False` on a per-graphic basis, if desired.

Currently, the following results in 8 plots with axes, and a text frame which also has axes, even though `axes=False` is explicitly given.


```
A = [plot(sin(t+k*pi/4),(-pi,pi)) for k in range(8)] + [text('hello world',(0,0), axes=False)]
graphics_array(A,3,3)
```


See the post at asksage about [this issue](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/308/can-i-convert-a-graphicsarray-object-to-a-graphics) for more details.
