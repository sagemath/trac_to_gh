OK, github pull request was properly found here, but why didn't the branch automatically get created too?

Hmm, I never heard of such a workflow. Is it documented anywhere?

if in your local Sage repo you put github.com/nbruin/sage/ into your remotes, you should be able to pull from it, and then push this into trac git repo.

Perhaps this can be automated by git-trac-command?

Its Robert's git integration bot. I'm assuming (hoping) that he will eventually implement the pushing of the branch and setting of the ticket metadata on trac...  Right now the github tickets cannot be merged.

just for the record. In your local Sage repo do

```
 git remote add nbruin https://github.com/nbruin/sage.git
 git fetch nbruin
 git fetch nbruin 1bb3967bcc14adba5e9323ce97994a9d0b929741
 git checkout -b public/17031 FETCH_HEAD
 git push --set-upstream trac HEAD:public/17031
```

and then modify the branch field on trac to `public/17031`.

That was implemented, but something on trac changed in the meantime that broke it (xml-rpc returns "pop() takes at most 1 argument (2 given)' while executing 'ticket.update()" if you try to set the commit hash manually). Should work again now (so much for my hundred day uptime...).
