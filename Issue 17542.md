Couldn't you use `git rm` and `git mv` in your commits? It would be of very much help for the reviewer...

1. That's what I did.
2. I think it doesn't make a difference to `git` (unlike `hg` where it _does_ matter).

I guess your real question is: "why does `git show` not show the rename?"

I don't know the answer either. Perhaps it doesn't detect the rename because there is an old and new file with the name `src/sage/algebras/group_algebra.py`

After reading `man git-show`, I discovered the trick:

```
git show -B -M
```

_does_ show the rename properly.

It also seems that if in the same commit you use `git rm/mv` *and* modify the file then it is not clean anymore.

The document is still mentioned in the documentation

```
/opt/sage_flatsurf/src/doc/en/reference/algebras/index.rst
```


PS: the `-B` is very cool!

Which document do you mean?

Does `make doc-clean; make` fix it? If yes, then that's a bug in the docbuilder, not in my patch.

Everything is fine with the docbuilder: both `group_algebra.py` and `group_algebra_new.py` exist. But `group_algebra_new` still appears in `algebras/index.rst` and should definitely be replaced with `group_algebra`.

I don't see the problem. Are you sure you applied the patch and rebuilt the documentation properly? In case you're viewing the generated HTML in your browser, don't forget to refresh.

You were right! I did not refresh properly the doc and then get confused by looking at the wrong commit. Sorry.
