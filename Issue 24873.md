# Issue 24873: minkowski_reduction() returns wrong output

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25110

Original creator: annahaensch

Original creation time: 2018-04-06 15:52:03

Currently, the function in //quadratic_form_reduction_theory.py// to Minkowski reduce a basis returns an incorrect output.  For example:


```
sage: Q=QuadraticForm(ZZ,3,[1,-2,0,2,0,2])
sage: Q.Gram_matrix()

[ 1 -1  0]
[-1  2  0]
[ 0  0  2]
sage: Q.minkowski_reduction()

(
Quadratic form in 3 variables over Integer Ring with coefficients: 
[ 1 -2 0 ]                                                         
[ * 2 0 ]                                                          
[ * * 2 ]                                                          ,

[1 0 0]
[0 1 0]
[0 0 1]
)
```


But this is by definition (see for example Cassels "Rational Quadratic Forms" p. 255) not Minkowski reduced, since   


```
Q(1,1,0) < Q(0,1,0).
```


A correct Minkowski reduced matrix equivalent to the one given, would be 


```
Quadratic form in 3 variables over Integer Ring with coefficients: 
[ 1 0 0 ]
[ * 1 0 ]
[ * * 2 ]
```


There is also a problem that this function runs on an infinite loop (rather than raising an error flag) when an indefinite quadratic form is entered.

Sorry I can't do a full review, but for the sake of PEP8 please change

```
Q=QuadraticForm(ZZ,4,[1,-2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,2])
```

to

```
Q = QuadraticForm(ZZ, 4, [1, -2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2])
```

and  consider simplifying

```
for a_first in mrange([3  for i in range(j)]):
    y = [x-1 for x in a_first] + [1] + [0 for k in range(n-1-j)]
    e_j = [0  for k in range(n)]
```

to

```
for a_first in mrange([3] * j]):
    y = [x-1 for x in a_first] + [1] + [0] * (n-1-j)
    e_j = [0] * n
```

for better readability.

Thanks, I updated the documentation as you recommend.  I left the code in its original form.  The edits you suggest introduced a build error, and rather than troubleshoot that, I think it's easier just to leave it as it's been.

The code works as expected.
The code agrees with the algorithm given in the reference by Schulze-Pillot.
All documentation and all test are completed without errors.

Actually (I'm sorry), I take it back.
I think there is a typo in Schulze-Pillot's paper. Where it says m>=4 in the algorithm it should really say m<= 4.
I'm not convinced that the algorithm implemented here works for more that 4 variables.
It seems to me that the coefficients _s_i_ are taken in {0,-1,1} but this should only work for at most 4 variables.
I haven't thought about this a lot and so I'm changing the status to 'needs info' first. 
But I suspect that this actually needs work...

I think you're correct.  I looked more closely at the 1979 Donaldson paper (see bottom of page 203) and it looks like the problem of finding the s_i grows difficult very quickly as the dimension increases.  For the moment, I think we should just call this an algorithm for forms with dimension less than or equal to 4 and raise a NotImplimentedError otherwise.  I just pushed a commit to that effect.  Let me know what you think. Thanks!

you should add a doctest in dimension 5, raising the `NotImplementedError`

Thanks, I just added that.

Everything works as expected. The documentation is fine.
Merging with the latest development branch (8.3beta7) works fine, compiles fine and all tests pass.
