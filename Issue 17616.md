# Issue 17616: Implement mpz_pylong in Cython

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-02-25 14:38:00

Convert the `c_lib` file `mpz_pylong.c` to Cython.

Also simplify the implementation a lot using `mpz_import`/`mpz_export` such that `mpn_pylong.c` can be completely removed.
