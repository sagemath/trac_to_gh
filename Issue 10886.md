For instance, 

```
Note this should normally be used indirectly via circle:

sage: from sage.plot.polygon import Polygon
```

circle?

Might as well also get more interpage hyperlinks while we're at it.

We try to keep lines short (more or less 80 characters) in documentation so they can be read nicely in terminals.  So you should put 

```
or :func:`~sage.plot.plot3d.shapes2.polygon3d` 
```
 
on a new line.

Also, you'll need a period at the end of the sentence at the beginning.

Otherwise seems like it should work fine!
