# Issue 10886: Fix trivial problems in plot/polygon

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2011-03-18 20:39:38

Assignee: jason, was

For instance, 

```
Note this should normally be used indirectly via circle:

sage: from sage.plot.polygon import Polygon
```

circle?

Might as well also get more interpage hyperlinks while we're at it.

Needs work, because of the blank lines in `__getitem__`.

We try to keep lines short (more or less 80 characters) in documentation so they can be read nicely in terminals.  So you should put 

```
or :func:`~sage.plot.plot3d.shapes2.polygon3d` 
}}} 
on a new line.

Also, you'll need a period at the end of the sentence at the beginning.

Otherwise seems like it should work fine!

[PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) suggests 72 characters for documentation, 79 for code (and presumably doctests).
