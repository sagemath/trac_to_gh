# Issue 15856: Finding name for deprecation sometimes fails

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Deprecated functions from modules imported with `import foo` don't work, while modules imported with `from bar import foo` do work. This is because sometimes there is no `__module__` attribute.

Thank you!

Now - what is the correct procedure for me - fetch this branch and merge it into mine?

PS: since it is in beta7 you can just merge that into your branch.
