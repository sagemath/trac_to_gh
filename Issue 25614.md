I have compiled dozens of programs but sagemaths compilation is not user friendly. It needs extra features to make compilation easier.
Two suggestions i want to make are:

1. Add -C option to make
for example:

`cd ~/sage/build`
 

`make -C ~/sage/src`

This allows a user to build out of tree from a dedicated build directory which they can create themselves. This way one does not have to worry about how the developers have configured `make clean` and `make distclean` which varies between `Makefile`'s. A quick `rm -rf build` and one can start re-compiling if something goes wrong. 

2. Add DESTDIR
I like to convert my source code installs into `RPM` packages before installing it. This requires me to use the `DESTDIR` option to set up a staging directory for the installation. I tried this with sagemath and it seemed to split the installtion between this staging area and the `--prefix`

3. Add `make install`
I understand the decision to have `make` do both building and installing as it allows users to do both in one command (and its easier for developers). However this makes compiling rigid and causes problems when a user needs to customize their installation. For example, if one wishes to convert the source code directory to an `RPM` or `DEB` package. 

These three suggestions can enhance the user experience.
