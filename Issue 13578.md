There's some unused (commented) code laying around that can be eliminated, and plenty of trailing whitespace. This is just to make future patches cleaner.

I don't understand why patchbot complains about a decreased doctest coverage because no functions have been added. Anyway, patch looks good.

One of the commented functions that I removed had an EXAMPLES block -- patchbot probably thought that block belonged to some other function.

Not a real problem, thanks for the review.
