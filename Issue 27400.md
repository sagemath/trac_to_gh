Few comments:

- Is there a reason for the H to be capitalized?
- The references should be placed in the references in the doc (see other files in polyhedron folder)
- "The group Z/2Z acts ..." could be math formatted
- Look at the conventions for docstring (example is the function vertex_facet_graph in base.py of the polyhedron folder). Further info here: https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html

Then, one has to figure out how to integrate the code to the polyhedron class appropriately. I will address this in another comment.

I am not sure it is worth introducing "is_element_of_base_ring" to use it only once.

In "_Hstar_is_effective_normaliz", you could avoid using flag and just return False as soon as you meet the condition. Then "return True" at the end.

Otherwise, patchbot is green, so this now needs a more mathematical review. I am afraid I cannot do that. Maybe Jean-Philippe can take the task ?

Here are a few comments:

- Since the GAP import is only used once, I would put it inside the function that uses only to limit global imports.

- I'm not sure about the function ".is_full_dimensional". This is a bit a colloquial term and it isn't harder than checking if the ambient dim is the same as the dimension of the polytope (think: which is more transparent in the code "full_dimensional" or "ambient dim=dim"). I believe that the former is more transparent. I would delete the new method.

- You don't need the import of "var". Check how this is done in ehrhart_series in backend_normaliz. "new_result" is going to complain, but you can easily get a list by using the .gens of the ring you create...

- Could you use "set" instead of "Set"?

- The docstring of "fixed_subpolytopes" should be revisited. What does it return? I expect polytopes from the fct name, but then the first sentence is super intricated. Then the output should say that "the elements of ..." are the keys. 

- Within the function Hstar_function_normaliz, you should try to put all the imports at the beginning of the function.

- I suggest '_express_Hstar_as_rational_fn_in_t' -> "_Hstar_as_rat_fct"
