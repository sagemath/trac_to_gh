# Issue 20437: hyperelliptic_g2_rational_field should wrap pari.genus2red

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20674

Original creator: kedlaya

Original creation time: 2016-05-24 18:43:35

Keywords: hyperelliptic curve, genus 2, reduction

There is currently a class whose entire definition is the following:

```
import hyperelliptic_g2_generic, hyperelliptic_rational_field

class HyperellipticCurve_g2_rational_field(
    hyperelliptic_g2_generic.HyperellipticCurve_g2_generic,
    hyperelliptic_rational_field.HyperellipticCurve_rational_field):
    pass
```

This appears to be a placeholder awaiting a method calling `pari.genus2red` (formerly the separate package `genus2reduction`). Let's make that happen!

Seems that was done in #15808.

File `src/sage/interfaces/genus2reduction.py`, lines 13--14 and line 439:


```
- Jeroen Demeyer (2014-09-17): replace genus2reduction program by PARI
  library call (:trac:`15808`)
```


```
        res = pari.genus2red([P, Q])
```


Setting as invalid/duplicate/wontfix. To confirm,

This ticket actually postdates #15808. However, I can no longer find the class in question; it may have been removed by some other ticket. So for that reason, I agree to declare this a duplicate/wontfix.

This was probably fixed by #27633.
