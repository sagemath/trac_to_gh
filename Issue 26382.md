should be better now

```
if RR(n*y).ceil() is n*y: # WHAT !?
```

+1

Although I am not convinced that

```diff
-        sage: enum_projective_number_field(X(K), bound=5^(1/3), prec=2^10)
+        sage: enum_projective_number_field(X(K), bound=RR(5^(1/3)), prec=2^10)
```

should be changed. It seems like you are loosing precision on `bound` by doing that (since 53 < 2<sup>10</sup>). You are doing that to avoid a doctest failure, right?

I am doing that because of the "round" problem.. only hiding under the carpet the issue that "float" has no method "round"..

Bot is Green. So is this acceptable or not ?

This is acceptable, but I want to see if we can quickly fix the underlying issue. Can you post the full traceback of the failure without your change? From looking at the code, I do not see where a `round` is called, but maybe I am missing something.

I am also seeing another possible py3 fix needed:

```
/home/travis/sage-build/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/number_field/bdd_height.pyc in bdd_height(K, height_bound, tolerance, precision)
    535     possible_norm_set = set([])
    536     for n in range(class_number):
--> 537         for m in range(1, B+1):
    538             possible_norm_set.add(m*class_group_rep_norms[n])
    539     bdd_ideals = bdd_norm_pr_ideal_gens(K, possible_norm_set)
```

where `B+1` needs to be cast to an `int` here.

The best fix would be to add `__round___` to our own real numbers.. See 
#25827 for the reasons why this seems to be difficult and nobody did it.

Here is a python3 traceback involving one of these `range(1, B+1)`:

```

Thank you.

Do we just want to cast `int(B+1)`? If you just want to keep things as they are, then you can set a positive review.

sorry, but I do not understand your last remark. I would be happy enough with the current state.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2018-12-02 21:45:17

I meant changing

```diff
-for m in range(1, B+1):
+for m in range(1, int(B+1)):
```

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

Comment by chapoton created at 2018-12-04 21:07:21

oh, well. We will see later. Let us move on here. I am setting to positive..
