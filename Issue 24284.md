Some comments:

- A number of your 1-line descriptions are missing periods/full-stops at the end.
- `AbelianGroupElement_gap.__reduce__` is missing `EXAMPLES::` or `TESTS::`. (Is this method necessary?)
- Your `INPUT:` and `OUTPUT:` blocks are over-indented.
- `AbelianGroup_gap.__init__` is missing documentation. I would recommend having the `TestSuite` test there and in the class-level doc having an actual example(s) of how to construct and use the class.
- the `- ``A`` -- an `AbelianGroup`` means that "AbelianGroup" is latex formatting (needs 2 backticks on both sides), but I don't understand why you do not link to the specific class (or construction function) in Sage.
- There should not be a `__hash__` function because that should be handled by `UniqueRepresentation`.
- `_coerce_map_from_` is missing documentation.
- I do not understand the `sage` method.
- The `OUTPUT:` of `subgroup` is strange. I understand why you are saying that (most subgroups do not keep track of their ambient group(s)), but it reads very awkwardly.
- `elementary_divisors` does not have any doctests.

I finally found some time to make it through this ticket. Here is a synopsis of my changes:

- I simplified the overall logic by renaming `AbelianGroupAmbient_gap` to `AbelianGroupGap` and made this is the main entry point as `UniqueRepresentation` can handle processing input.
- I got rid of the `_with_pc` flag that was basically unused except for defining the behavior of `exponents`, but that is much better handled by a subclass IMO.
- I only use `Polycyclic` when it is necessary and error out when unable to import. Previously, there was a subtle change of a behavior only really noticeable because `Polycyclic` generators are `g1` whereas the usual libgap's are `f1` once `gap_packages` was installed.
- I fixed a bug where finite subgroups were placed in the category of infinite groups.
- Other misc doc and formatting changes.

Thank you for the careful review. I did not know about `__classcall_private__`.
Your changes look good.

Positive review from my side if you are happy with my changes in `exponents`.

A question: what is the purpose of 
`return super(AbelianGroup_gap, self)._coerce_map_from_(S)`
in `_coerce_map_from_` ? I do not quite understand it.
