You have indented input sections as


```
- parameter -- a longer explanation
               of the parameter.
```


whereas most parts seems to use


```
- parameter -- a longer explanation
  of the parameter.
```


I am not sure how Sphinx will react to this. Maybe Travis can comment this.

(And yes, I am quite paranoid about Sphinx doing something odd...)
