There are several more local references in cluster_seed.py. We should move them to index.rst as well?

I think we should just move them all at once.

Agreed, I did not notice them. I'll work on it in one hour or so.

There is a typo but I am recompiling on a different branch and I can't fix it right now. I should be able to mend the problem as soon as the documentation is done building.

LGTM.

There are other references to actual websites (or arxiv numbers) in cluster_seed.py and other parts of the cluster_algebra_quiver folder. This will not cause issue for Sage, but, since this ticket was already opened, should we move those local references as well? If you don't think we should do that, you can set this back to positive_review.

I now changed also all the references in every file under the folder cluster_algebra_quiver. They were in a messy variety of different styles.

We should be good and make sure those references have full bib information. For example, I suspect the Speyer reference has been published in a journal.


---

Comment by etn40ff created at 2017-01-10 15:50:31

I already did that. I could not find better references for [Spe2013]_ nor for [Ke2008]_. I did fix many of the others.

Okay, thanks. I will let Emily set it back to a positive review of there is nothing else.

Salvatore, you can set this to positive_review if you're OK with the change I just did (fixing a broken reference to GenericGraph.canonical_label).

I rebased the branch to the current develop. This and some other ticket introduced two new references in the same place generating the conflict. It should be good now.
