# Issue 12946: Support GCC version "4.7"

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2012-06-15 06:50:27

Assignee: tbd

It seems Debian ships a version of gcc where

```
gcc -dumpversion
```

outputs "4.7" instead of the expected "4.7.0".

This causes some failures in packages checking this version number.

I am experiencing an issue with linbox during an installation.  I have inquired on ask.sagemath.org about this.  Here are the details.  Is this related, should I open a separate ticket?  http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1914/error-installing-sage-because-of-package-linbox

Please try sage-5.4.rc2: [http://www.sagemath.org/download-latest.html](http://www.sagemath.org/download-latest.html)

I downloaded sage-5.4.rc2 as instructed onto my rackspace.com 64-bit vm and got the same error because GCC failed.  Then I typed export INSTALL_SAGE_GCC=yes then make and received another error, one I've seen before, where it stalled on linbox-sage.o.  I've attached the log to this ticket.

Could you please bring this discussion to the sage-devel mailing list instead of this ticket (which has nothing to do with it).  Also, is there any chance of getting access to that machine for easier debugging?

And to be very clear, please post:
 1. the failed `install.log` from building sage-5.4.rc2 _from scratch_ without any special environment variables set (no `MAKE`, no `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC`).
 2. the failed `install.log` from building sage-5.4.rc2 _from scratch_ with `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=yes` (i.e. not a build started without and continued with `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=yes`)

And how is the resource usage on that machine, are you constrained in memory/CPU usage?  Sage requires 2.5GB of memory to build (some of this may be swap space).
