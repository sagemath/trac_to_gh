It seems Debian ships a version of gcc where

```
gcc -dumpversion
```

outputs "4.7" instead of the expected "4.7.0".

This causes some failures in packages checking this version number.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13118

And how is the resource usage on that machine, are you constrained in memory/CPU usage?  Sage requires 2.5GB of memory to build (some of this may be swap space).
