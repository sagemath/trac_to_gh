While reviewing a ticket (see ticket:31414#comment:3), I found a failing doctest:


```

It was also mentionned in ticket:31443#comment:119. This failing test was produced while running [SageMath](SageMath) version 9.4.beta4 on Ubuntu 20.04.1.

I could not find any specific ticket for this issue, but if there is one already, please tell me and close this ticket.

I'll fix the test to not rely on the order of the elements of the list, as I suggested on #31443.

On second thoughts, I see that this test was introduced recently (in #30801) just to test that the numbers returned are all integral, so I am going to change the test to

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + x + 1)                                                                                                                
sage: all(x.is_integral() for x in K.ideal(8).invertible_residues())                                                                                  
True
