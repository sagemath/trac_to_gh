Also can you update the comment before `--enable-flint` to also say you enable flint as it is part of the standard packages of Sage?

I am not sure what the matrix ieqs represents. My interpretation: inhomogeneous inequalities, and we want to compute the lattice points in the polytope they define. Under this assumption I have made a Normaliz input file rash.in


```
amb_space auto
inhom_inequalities
[[0, 2, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
...
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]
HilbertBasis
```


Then a run of 


```
normaliz -c crash.in
```


finishes without any problems in 3.5.1 and the intended 3.5.2. It turns out that the polytope is empty:


```
0 module generators
1252 Hilbert basis elements of recession monoid
0 vertices of polyhedron
39 extreme rays of recession cone
11 support hyperplanes of polyhedron (homogenized)

embedding dimension = 9
affine dimension of the polyhedron = -1
rank of recession monoid = 8
...
```


Is my interpretation of the input correct?

Of course, if the matrix represents inhomogeneous inequalities, what is the RHS? My input above assumes it is the last coordinate. I will now try with the first.

I've pushed a branch with a fix for this problem. However, I have now come across another crash:

```
sage: RC = RiggedConfigurations(['E',8,1], [[4,2]])
sage: len(RC.module_generators)
python2: ./libnormaliz/project_and_lift.cpp:75: std::vector<long unsigned int> libnormaliz::ProjectAndLift<IntegerPL, IntegerRet>::order_supps(const libnormaliz::Matrix<Integer>&) [with IntegerPL = long long int; IntegerRet = long long int]: Assertion `Supps.nr_of_rows()>0' failed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

I have verified that this did at least not crash before (well, up to my patience level of 2 minutes).

However, **much** more worrying is this:

```
sage: RC = RiggedConfigurations(['E',8,1], [[5,2]])
sage: %time len(RC.module_generators)
CPU times: user 25 s, sys: 52 ms, total: 25 s
Wall time: 6.95 s
6009
```

versus before

```
sage: RC = RiggedConfigurations(['E',8,1], [[5,2]])
sage: %time len(RC.module_generators)
CPU times: user 1min 11s, sys: 320 ms, total: 1min 11s
Wall time: 14.6 s
7066
```

Although the `[5,1]` example both returns 75.

I will extract the polytopes and find out which one gives a different number of lattice points. Give me a few minutes.

The wrong number of lattice points is a more severe problem. I don't have an explanation for it.

The (first and solved) problem in sublattice_representation.h has nothing to do with it. After the change in sublattice_representation.h:323 a second problem has become visible there in Normaliz' own tests. One must change line 325 to


```
        if(SuppHelp.rank()<EmbDim-1)
```


But againthis has nothing to do with the wrong number of lattice points.

I am afraid all I can do is give you examples from my use-case as I do not understand too much about how Normaliz works. Thank you for your continued efforts and quick responses.

I added that to the patch, but (as you might be aware) I am now getting yet another crash with the same example as in comment:25:

The problem with the wrong number of lattice points (or a failing assertion) was not caused by a severe problem, but by a silly bug. As a temporary fix I suggest to include as lines cone.cpp:3804 and 3805


```
    if(!is_parallelotope)
        Pair.clear();
```


So with some surrounding the code there should be


```
            is_Computed.set(ConeProperty::IsPointed);
        }
    }
    
    if(!is_parallelotope)
        Pair.clear();
    
    if(!inhomogeneous && !isComputed(ConeProperty::Grading))
        return;
```


I plan to release 3.5.2 at the end of this week. It will contain a more conceptual solution.

Please test.
