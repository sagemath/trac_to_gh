Hi, nice to see you starting work already!

I would advise you, though, to start your work locally, rather than do a lot of commits to a branch on Trac, until you have a reasonably well-formed setup.  I say this because I know you will be working on it for a while this summer, so it isn't in danger of rotting away!  In particular, having good docstrings etc.  

I do like that you want to get stuff out early and often.  But maybe it would be good to have something you share with Vince (or others interested) for now, so that you can hash out what all needs to be in here, how strings should look, class and module strings, etc.  I guess what I'm saying is that it could be very confusing for a reviewer to try to review many different starts and stops and reworkings etc.  Of course if this is in close to final form then my apologies.

On an unrelated note, I'm wondering whether there happens to be any faster algorithms for calculating things - there is probably a literature of computational complexity and game theory, like there is in voting.  Some of these combinatorial things (e.g. for coalitions) get really nasty really quickly.

That's very helpful, we were wondering what was the best practice and from the documentation thought that using trac was the way to go. We'll move away from trac for now :) This ticket should be ready to review pretty soon.

Absolutely no apologies needed :) We weren't sure what was best practice :) We'll push to trac when it's ready to review.

To the best of my knowledge there isn't. There are various approximation algorithms that exist that could be coded in to here in the future perhaps?

Thanks again for your comments: they're really helpful.

Okay, here are my initial thoughts.  They're not in priority order, just the order I thought about them in.
* First, there are lots of little formatting things in docstrings.   I won't bother about them now, might even just try to comment on github eventually.  But they are there.  Please study other modules' docstrings carefully - especially with regard to length of lines and where to put double colons and blank lines.

You should at least allow any iterable as a key - but unfortunately the keys need to be [hashable](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4418741/im-able-to-use-a-mutable-object-as-a-dictionary-key-in-python-is-this-not-disa).  So as a corollary, dictionaries are not awesome for the games.
  
  Of course, then the question is "okay, mister smarty-pants, do you have a better idea?"  And the truth is I don't, yet.  This implementation is more flexible than [Shap.py](https://github.com/drvinceknight/Gamepy/blob/master/Shappy/Shap.py), it's true.

  * Might as well allow easy implementation of a subclass of Simple Games.   (In this case, one could imagine an initializer that uses either a list of winning coalitions, or this initialization.)
  * Banzhaf, other values?
  * What if one assumed the game to *be* additive?  Maybe then it could be inputted in a more straightforward way?
  * There should be mathematical descriptions of each concept in its documentation.  For instance, the Bessel function documentation is practically an intro to Bessel functions.
  * Should Shapley be *the* payoff vector?  Indeed, isn't the point that there could be many possible payoff vectors?  (The core, etc.)
  * Should one use Python permutations or Sage ones?
  * `get_predecessors` seems pointless as a separate function.
  * You could use list comprehensions some places (e.g. `marginal_contributions`).
  * That same function is really, really hard to figure out.  There is no context whatsoever.  I finally figured out what you meant, but it's pretty hermetic.

So as a corollary, dictionaries are not awesome for the games.
>   
>   Of course, then the question is "okay, mister smarty-pants, do you have a better idea?"  And the truth is I don't, yet.  This implementation is more flexible than [Shap.py](https://github.com/drvinceknight/Gamepy/blob/master/Shappy/Shap.py), it's true.  As a starting point, it might be useful to demonstrate using a short program to *generate* the dictionaries needed from an input of, say, five players and some rule on payoffs.

I had thought about this for a while and agree that `(A,)` isn't the best. Just on this minor point, we thought about having a clean up in the init method that would handle `A`, `(A,)` as well as `(A)` but require `(A,B)` for two tuples etc... Is this a done thing?

Ultimately, re dictionaries as you say: I don't see a better way of doing it. We need to map all the coalitions to values... Would be great if we could think of a nicer way of doing this...

We wondered about this. We will include it!

I don't see why not, but you would have to be careful, because the dictionary requires hashable keys.  So in that case 

```
sage: {'A':1}
{'A': 1}
sage: a = 5
sage: {a:1}
{5: 1}
sage: {2:1}
{2: 1}
sage: {(1,2):1}
{(1, 2): 1}
sage: {[1,2]:1}

----> 1 {[Integer(1),Integer(2)]:Integer(1)}

TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```

so I guess that you could accept a lot of different dictionaries.  But then one would want to check whether the singletons really were connected to the larger tuples.

So what *I'm* thinking is that we find a way to make it clear this is a "toy implementation" that would be general enough for someone actually in the field to expand upon.

[Here is](http://webpages.math.luc.edu/~enb/) yet another implementation - see the bottom, and then [this link](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/35933-mattugames) which is - yes! - BSD licensed!!!

Okay, but least I get too ambitious for coding I'm not doing, let me reiterate that a basic implementation, with as much potential for further development as possible, is what we want here.  So for now, exposing as little API as possible is good, so we wouldn't have to deprecate functionality later on.

This is basically ready for review now, although there are a couple of areas in the docs where LaTex isn't rendering as we expected. If someone could take a quick look over this that would be great.

We believe we've incorporated all of the suggestions made,  check [Github](https://github.com/theref/sage-game-theory/issues?state=open) to see any discussions we had.

Vince is going to be emailing the people that kcrisman recommended we talk to about reviewing and hopefully this should be ready very soon.

I have updated my knowledge and we've just implemented a much better calculation that is more or less (to the best of my knowledge) as fast as one can go without taking advantage of particular structures of a particular case.: http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tom/Game_Theory/coal.pdf

James is reviewing my changes and will push to trac.

Here are a few brief comments to get going.
* One thing I found odd - if you look at https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/doc/en/reference then you'll see that most modules only have a one-liner for the src/doc/en/reference/game_theory/conf.py type file.  My guess is that is a good idea, though you'll want to try to make sure.
* Probably brief versions of the (great) descriptions of the methods in the main doctoring could be added to the individual method docs, e.g. 

```
sage: integer_game.nullplayer?
  Returns True if the current payoff_vector possesses the null player
   property.
...
```

   is pretty minimalist.
* Documentation won't build, perhaps there is something needed in a manifest somewhere.

```
$ ./sage -docbuild reference html
[dynamics ] WARNING: intersphinx inventory '/Users/.../sage/src/doc/output/html/en/reference/game_theory/objects.inv' not fetchable due to <type 'exceptions.IOError'>: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: Error building the documentation.
```

  This could just be my problem, of course.
* Are your LaTeX issues due to using dollar signs instead of single backticks?  (Since I can't actually build the documentation.)
* Or, you may be interested in using the `:math:` - see [here](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#latex-typesetting), though I don't see anything obviously wrong.
* If you are using a different source for Shapley, maybe you should mention your source.  Also (though this is more minor, since this is a first try!), did you compare timings for the two different things in Python?  Creating lots of power sets and factorials looks as scary as what you did before, but maybe it isn't.

The docs look great, everything is indeed correct and I've added the reference as suggested.

More to say:

* Earlier, you said:
> I had thought about this for a while and agree that (A,) isn't the best. Just on this minor point, we thought about having a clean up in the init method that would handle A, (A,) as well as (A) but require (A,B) for two tuples etc... Is this a done thing?
So... what happened to that?  I still find this syntax VERY onerous.   Economists aren't necessarily interested in typing that many commas; the quotes are bad enough (though necessary, I think).  There is a mention of this in a test but you don't exactly take advantage of it.
* You have

```
A characteristic
+    function game `G = (N, v)` is superadditive if it satisfies `v(C_2)
+    \geq v(C_1)` for all `C_1 \subseteq C_2` such that `C_1 \cap C_2 = \emptyset`.
```

  What the heck?  (This is wrong in both places.)
* In what sense is the Shapley vector fair?  (Efficient, etc.)  Presumably one should mention at least briefly what criteria this is referring to.  (You do this later but not immediately.)
* Should this be set of predecessors?

```
where `S_{\pi}(i)` is the number of predecessors of `i` in `\pi`,
```

* Quite a few papers reference the computational complexity of computing the Shapley value.  I don't know whether this is worth mentioning, since we don't implement any approximations (yet).
* ?

```
The Shapley value (described above) is none to be the unique
```

* Minor, perhaps, but should we have `symmetric` instead of `symmetry`?

I trust Travis that this is all implemented correctly, however (but superadditive?) and in general I think you have something really worth adding to Sage here!

We had a long think about this and have included some text in the documentation to justify what is happening now. In particular we think that `A` alone should not necessarily be allowed as we don't really want to map `A` to a value but the set containing `A`...

Otherwise, pretty sure that we've addressed everything else you raised.
