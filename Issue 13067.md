Contracts edges in a graph so that we can compute the Tutte polynomial (#1314)

This version of contracting edges is different from #7304 (this code will keep resulting multiedges and remove contracted edge).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13239

Hello,

I don't understand this new patch. If the behavior of the contract_edge function proposed in patch #7304 is not adapted to your purpose, you could add extra parameters (inplace = False, keep_multiedges, etc.)

Furthermore, it works only for undirected graphs. So it should at least be in graph.py and not in generic_graph.py. 

In the following example, arc (3,0) becomes arc (0,3)

```
sage: D = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(5,.5)
sage: h = D.contraction((0,1))
sage: D.edges(labels=None)
[(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 2)]
sage: h.edges(labels=None)
[(0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 3), (0, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)]
```
 

D.

Okay, I will definitely move to graph.py unless I can figure out how to make it work for digraphs.

If the #7304 function is not adapted to your purpose, it could be better to include the code in your function instead of creating a new one.

May be some people from Sage Days could give good advise.

A couple of graph theorists at Sage Days said they would prefer to have a function by the name of contraction that does what I described in the documentation for this one.  It is very easy to adapt their code and call it contraction.  I'm going to try both things and time them to see which is faster.  Thanks!
