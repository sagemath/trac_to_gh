You are right, and this fix is okay.   The patch is not a standard one, though, so I'm uploading that.  Please make sure it applies and does what you want, then switch to positive review.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

You can also manually edit the author to be you and upload that patch :-)

Let's do this thing.  Jan, I made you be the author of the patch, since you are.

Thanks Karl,
Somehow I missed these comments in the last few weeks and only saw it now.
The patch looks good. How can I produce the standard patches?
Regards,
Jan

Patchbot, apply trac_13702.patch to the root repository.  (Hopefully that will work.)

Jan, you can go into `SAGE_ROOT` and make your changes, then do 

```
./sage -hg ci
<it should show your changes, then dump you into an editor to produce a commit message>
./sage -hg export tip > /path/to/filename.patch
```

or you can use `hg_root` to do things in this repository.

Thanks, I think the only difference was that I used hg instead of sage -hg. I will check the next time I export a patch.
