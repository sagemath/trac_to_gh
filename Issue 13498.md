Patchbot, apply trac_13702.patch to the root repository.  (Hopefully that will work.)

Jan, you can go into `SAGE_ROOT` and make your changes, then do 

```
./sage -hg ci
<it should show your changes, then dump you into an editor to produce a commit message>
./sage -hg export tip > /path/to/filename.patch
```

or you can use `hg_root` to do things in this repository.
