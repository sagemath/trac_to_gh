#11219 added nice documentation of magic functions in IPython.  (See #13823 for a nearly trivial update to that.)  But these never made it into the fr, de, or ru translations, much less (or not?) upcoming ones like #9577, #10165, #12822.

#15063 (more precisely, fc9b515b88c7c37e184801762c987076d7386403) takes care of the French one.

Changing component from documentation to translations.
