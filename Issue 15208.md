Maybe, also remove the other codes from the global namespace? You can try to post it on sage-devel and gather some opinions on whether it is a good idea to remove all the codes from the global namespace. It will probably also improve the startup time of sage by a bit.

They will tell me to put deprecation warnings everywhere for one year `T_T`

Replying to [comment:4 ncohen]:
> They will tell me to put deprecation warnings everywhere for one year `T_T`
Ah yes! That solves it! Put deprecation everywhere. `:D` On a more serious note, it might be confusing if the codes are available both as, say, `HammingCode` and `codes.HammingCode`. So, it is better that something is done about it and a clean interface is provided.

I am actually quite happy to see a `codes.<tab>`. That keeps it clean and it is easy to remember. Instead of trying to remember all the individual codes, I only need to remember `codes` and then a tab will show me all the codes that are available in Sage.

This looks good to me. Can you add a doctest or two, against say, `HammingCode` and `ReedSolomonCode` just to illustrate that the interface has changed and that the deprecation warning is showed now?

By the way, the patchbot has caught some more cases where the old interface is used - all of them are in the documentation.

Argggg... I just rebased it on 6.1.beta0 and added the patch that you see on top. All others are those that Volker merged into beta0 `:-/`

Arrgghh! How do I use the dev scripts to check out your new updates? I had used

```
sage --dev checkout --ticket 15445
```

to check out this ticket. Now, how do I get the new updates?

```
$ sage -dev pull -h
usage: sage-dev pull [-h] [--ticket TICKET_OR_REMOTE_BRANCH]

Pull "ticket_or_remote_branch" to "branch".

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --ticket TICKET_OR_REMOTE_BRANCH, --remote-branch TICKET_OR_REMOTE_BRANCH
                        a string or an integer or "None" (default: "None"), a ticket or a remote branch name; setting this
                        to "None" has the same effect as setting it to the :meth:`current_ticket`.
```

or just `git remote update && git pull trac u/ncohen/15445`.

Excellent! Thanks!

I think this is good to go. I don't see any more problems right now.

I will just check back for the patchbot to catch up with these commits, but I see no failures in doctests in `doc/en/thematic_tutorials` or `doc/en/reference/coding` or `sage/coding`, or `sage/matroids`.
