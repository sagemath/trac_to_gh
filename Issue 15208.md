Maybe, also remove the other codes from the global namespace? You can try to post it on sage-devel and gather some opinions on whether it is a good idea to remove all the codes from the global namespace. It will probably also improve the startup time of sage by a bit.

Ah yes! That solves it! Put deprecation everywhere. `:D` On a more serious note, it might be confusing if the codes are available both as, say, `HammingCode` and `codes.HammingCode`. So, it is better that something is done about it and a clean interface is provided.

I am actually quite happy to see a `codes.<tab>`. That keeps it clean and it is easy to remember. Instead of trying to remember all the individual codes, I only need to remember `codes` and then a tab will show me all the codes that are available in Sage.
