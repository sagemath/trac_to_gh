I agree that the sage theme looks old. But perhaps it has merits in that it is almost the basic theme officially provided by Sphinx.

Replacing the same theme with a theme not based on the basic theme would be a work on another level. Currently Sage doc build is entangled with the structure of the basic theme. So definitely it is not to be done here.

Eventually it would be good that we could choose at build time among alternative themes.

Probably on another ticket, we should also fix `src/doc/common/update-python-inv.sh` to not use Python 2 anymore.

> documentation access from jupyter notebook (this undoes #33206) 

I'm confused by this: can you add more detail? (Did you solve the problem at #33206 in a different way, because the PDF links seem to work from the Jupyter notebook with this branch?)

which solves problems related with symlinks. 

I am a little unsure if there could be security problems in exposing this much of path.

If I am not mistaken you are just moving the root of the webserver to the directory `SAGE_DOC`. In a distro that would be a sage specific folder, so it doesn't expose anything other than sage objects. It doesn't bleed to other stuff. I am not sure what other security issue you would have.

Would it be convenient to have a small index page at the root? The index page may contain the page listing all sage documentation, like

https://doc.sagemath.org/index.html

Really, we may use the source file of that page. Where is it?

I don't understand. Did you build the doc using the latest commit? Or copy pasted from the above diff?

For me, for example, The "English" link lists files in `html/en` as it is supposed to do.

This make no difference here from the notebook. For the `French` language I get

```
doc/html/fr/ is not a file
```

I'm not an expert on this but I think for this to work from the notebook there needs to be an `index.html` file under each  language that contains links to docs for that language. Things work locally but not from the notebook.

This ticket might be the first one to encounter with the new policy introduced recently. Namely, the ticket authors now have responsibility of resolving conflicts with the branch of the release manager. This seems so from the generated comment reporting the merge conflict above. I think this is good because this reduces the release manager's burden. 

Then it would be convenient to authors and perhaps necessary that the release manager's current branch is available somewhere.

There's no new policy; whenever the release manager encountered a merge conflict, the ticket was set back to "needs_work".

I was aware of the update in the release manager scripts. 

I thought that previously, the merge conflict notices that I received from the release manager were always against the latest new beta, not against with the release manager's current branch that I don't have access to. But apparently I thought wrong.

If the author chooses to address it right away, is there an easy way to find out which ticket in the long list of the tickets has merge conflict with the present ticket? For me, it was tedious work to find this out, without access to the release manager's branch.
