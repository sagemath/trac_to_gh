The proposed patch implements a basic version of point counting for elliptic curve using canonical lift (à la Satoh).

This implements the algorithms described in Fouquet, Gaudry and Harley, "An extension of Satoh's algorithm and its implementation", http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00512791/en, based on the Pari/GP implementation by Yeoh,  http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yeoh/nt/satoh-fgh.gp.

It uses Pari for computation in Z_q.

This is currently only implemented for characteristic two.

Other characteristic are nearly done, but I have some bugs left.

It adds a cardinality_fgh() method to the EllipticCurve_finite_field class and the real implementation is made in a new fgh_algo.py file.

I just realized there is a bug when working over F_8.

I'll try to fix it quickly.

PARI now has very efficient point counting in small characteristic (faster than MAGMA), we should wrap these functionnalities.
I have as well code based on FLINT yielding similar performance as PARI.

I've put some timings of the PARI code (originally posted on pari-dev list) at #11548.
