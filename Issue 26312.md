Keywords: formal power series

The goal of this project is to build software in Sage for doing lazy computation with multivariable formal power series over large commutative ring (such as the Lazard ring, which is a polynomial ring over the integers in an countable number of variables). 

We will define power series by describing a function from a cartesian power of the natural numbers to the coefficient ring. We plan to manipulate such power series in a completely formal manner. For example, when two formal power series are added, the resulting formal power series is just a tree containing the node "+" with the two functions defining the formal power series as children. The only time computation of the coefficients occurs is when the user asks to "view" a power series out to some range. Then our goal is to perform the minimal amount of computation in order to show the resulting power series to the user to the specified precision.

We also introduce a class of commutative rings called "IndRings". They are simply sequential diagrams of finitely generated k-algebras, where k is a base ring that Sage knows about. An IndRing is defined by specifying a function from the natural numbers to finitely generated k-algebras and, for each natural number i, a map of k-algebras from the k-algebra associated to i to the k-algebra associated to i+1. 

A map of IndRings is a map of Ind-objects in finitely generated k-algebras. That is, it is given by specifying countable subsets S and T of the natural numbers and a surjective lax order preserving map f from S to T and a map of k-algebras from the k-algebra associated to an element s in S to the k-algebra associated to f(s). These maps are supposed to commute with all of the structure, but we will not check this in the software.

We also provide a way to promote a finitely generated k-algebra to an IndRing.
