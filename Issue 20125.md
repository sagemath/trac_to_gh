Status quo:
 * add_variable uses 3 logical switches `binary=False, continuous=False, integer=False` (see #20324 regarding their defaulting behavior)
 * this matches the methods `is_variable_continuous` etc.
 * `set_variable_type` expresses the same thing using values 1, 0, -1. 

Proposal (from #20354 discussion):
 * `add_variable` there should take a `variable_type` parameter, defaulting to `'continuous'`, with other possible values `'binary'`, `'integer'`.
 * possibly deprecate the 3 switches
 * `set_variable_type` should take the same `variable_type` values `'continuous'`, `'binary'`, `'integer'`.
 * definitely deprecate values `1`, `0`, `-1`.

There are similar idiosyncrasies elsewhere in the backend interface (should be made separate tickets)
 * Minimization is expressed as `maximization=False` in the constructor; as `set_sense(-1)`; is queried by `is_maximization`
 * ...
