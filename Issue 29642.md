# Issue 29642: Linking Kenzo simplicial sets to SageMath ones

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29879

Original creator: @jcuevas-rozo

CC:  mmarco jhpalmieri

Keywords: gsoc2020 simplicial sets kenzo

This ticket aims to improve the interface connecting the Kenzo Program (https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~sergerar/Kenzo/) and [SageMath](SageMath) (see ticket #27880 for an updated version of the interface).

In order to use Kenzo functionalities directly as methods of Sage objects, the module `Simplicial sets` can be modified to, once a simplicial set in Sage is constructed, create its analogous Kenzo simplicial set (whenever it is possible).

Maybe the default for kenzo_repr should be None instead of False?

Also here:



```
+    # in Kenzo, a maximal dimension for representing a sphere is provided
+    max_dim_kenzo = ecl_eval("+maximal-dimension+").python()
+    if kenzo_is_present and kenzo_repr:
+        if n < max_dim_kenzo:
+            setattr(result, '_kenzo_repr', kenzo.Sphere(n))
+        else:
+            raise AssertionError('Dimension of the Sphere must be < {} when\
+                                  kenzo_repr = True'.format(max_dim_kenzo))
+    return result
+    
```


If we are over the maximal kenzo dimension, we should just not use the kenzo representation, instead of raising an error. It doesn't make sense that adding kenzo might mean to lose a functionality.

I think that it would be a better idea to not rely on an explicit flag by the user to create the kenzo representation for the primitive constructors (Sphere, classifying space and so on). If it is possible to create the corresponding kenzo object, do it. Otherwise, don't.

Same for the derivative constructors (product, wedge and so on).

Until now, we have added the *`_kenzo_repr`* attribute to the different classes concerning simplicial sets and some related constructors. This attribute allows the automatic construction of the equivalent `KenzoObject` to a simplicial set, once it is created in [SageMath](SageMath).

In addition, we have created classes for abstract simplexes and combinations (Kenzo objects) in order to improve the communication between the Kenzo system and [SageMath](SageMath).

Our next step is adding the *`_kenzo_repr`* attribute for simplicial set morphisms, which makes it possible to construct pushouts and therefore other constructors of simplicial sets.

The doctests that deppend on Kenzo, should be marked as optional. Otherwise, we would get errors when running the testsuite without kenzo installed.

Also, it would make sense to add the methods that kenzo can provide (such as homotopy_group, or the spectral seqences that kenzo can compute) to the classes that could take advantage of them (mainly, simplicial sets).
