Keywords: matrix LU

The returned permutation matrix P is in the case of Matrix_double_dense such that:
P A = L U

while in the case of Matrix:
A = P L U


```
sage: A = random_matrix(QQ, 4, 4)
sage: A.LU()[0]
[0 1 0 0]
[0 0 0 1]
[0 0 1 0]
[1 0 0 0]
sage: matrix(RDF, A).LU()[0]
[0 0 0 1]
[1 0 0 0]
[0 0 1 0]
[0 1 0 0]
```
