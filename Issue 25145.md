I think that is even more of a reason to work towards making sagenb optional.

Are we sure there even are users that keep up with the latest version of sage (e.g. aren't using 6.0 forever or something) *and* still use sagenb? And even making sagenb optional wouldn't immediately make that impossible, it would just make it a tiny bit more inconvenient. That might be a good thing because then they might either complain here (showing us that there are such users) or realize that it might be time to look into the jupyter notebook.

I agree.

By the way, with the branch here, `make doc` and `make doc-pdf` still try to build the `notebook` directory in `src/doc/en/reference`.
