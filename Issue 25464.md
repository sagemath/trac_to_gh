Sieve algorithm can be used for enumeration of rational points, when product projective space is over a `RationalField`. This would be much faster than basic enumeration.

Doing LLL reduction per component did work fine. But it performs very poor on small examples. Consider this:


```
sage: from sage.schemes.product_projective.rational_point import \
                enum_product_projective_number_field
sage: from sage.schemes.product_projective.rational_point import sieve
sage: PP.<x1,x2,x3,y1,y2,y3,z1,z2,z3> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([2,2,2], QQ)
sage: X = PP.subscheme([x1+x2+x3,y1+y2+y3,z1+z2+z3])
sage: sieve(X,1)
sage: enum_product_projective_rational_field(X,1)
```


Basic enumeration turns out to be extremely efficient. However for larger bound, sieve works good.

I have pushed a branch for the same
[u/raghukul01/product_sieve_23701](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/log/?h=u/raghukul01/product_sieve_23701)

Value of B is calculated from the component projective space, whose dimension is maximum

```python
dim_max = max(P[i].dimension() for i in range(num_comp))
B = RR(2**(dim_max/4+1)*bound**2*(dim_max+1).sqrt())
```

Since that would be the upper bound for all other components as well.

Doc test failures in schemes/product_projective


```
sage -t --long --warn-long 82.3 homset.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 82.3 rational_point.py  # 16 doctests failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 82.3 space.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

Sir,

I didn't get any of those doctest failure (tested on 8.4.beta0), can you provide some specific test which failed.

It works fine on 8.4.beta0, perhaps my local version was just messed up when I ran those tests.

In testing functionality I'm not getting any issues, but I do see the very slow times. It seems to me like you need to re-think your 'good_primes' strategy. I'm getting much better results using the list from 'sufficient_primes', so it seems you are underestimating the time to enumerate.

It may be that you should just use the 'sufficient_primes' list trimmed down to be minimal.

Yes that seemed to work fine, but why is it so? Is there something missing in the complexity part, which is causing this error?


---

Comment by bhutz created at 2018-08-09 13:26:34

It's probably just that Pmax^N as a rough estimate of the number of points is too simplistic of a complexity estimate.

Yes Sir, I agree with that, it should be Pmax<sup>dim_ambient_space</sup> by looking at the rational point function for the finite field. I have added some other corrections in complexity as well

```C++
T(n) = (dim**2)*Pmax**(dim) + (dim_max**5 * (alpha/Pmax)**dim_scheme)
# it is (alpha/Pmax)^dim_scheme, since only that many points will
# be checked parallelly.
# instead of N^5, it would be dim_max^5, since we do LLL() over 
# each component, hence only the dim_max would be leading term
```


I have tested this branch, it has shown good improvement, however for smaller bounds (< 4), the enumeration is better. How about changing rational point logic according to this?

I haven't reviewed the changes, but to answer your general question. X.rational_points() should do whatever is typically fastest. If that means enumeration for very small bounds and sieving after a certain cutoff, then by all means do it that way.

This example (with low codimension) is very slow:


```
PP.<x,y,z,u,v,a,b,c> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([2,1,2], QQ)
X = PP.subscheme([x*u^2*a, b*z*u*v,z*v^2*c ])
X.rational_points(bound=2)
```
