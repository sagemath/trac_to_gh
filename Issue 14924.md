CC:  @jhpalmieri @tscrim

Nothing in `sage.homology` makes use of the Parent/Element framework. But it would be nice to be able to work with chains and use normal syntax for addition and multiplication by scalars. The aim of this ticket is to adapt chain complexes. The analogous project for cell complexes will be left for a future ticket.

I don't understand the example `C.an_element()` in the ticket description: all of the differentials are zero, so the various listed elements can't be mapping to each other. I would expect that an element would be an element of a single `C^i`, or possibly an element of the direct sum of all of the `C^i`'s, and I would prefer the first choice.

Here, element = chain, i.e. an element of the direct sum of the `C_i`. That is the most general notion of element, so it is the one that ought to be implemented. The arrows in the ascii art are there to visualize the relative position in the complex. And they are `\to` and not `\mapsto` arrows... Do you have a better ascii art representation in mind?

Since it is useful to see the coordinate expression of a chain that is supported only in a single degree (e.g. homology generators) they are printed differently: 

```
sage: D = ChainComplex({0: matrix(ZZ, 2, 2, [1,0,0,2])})
sage: D()
Trivial chain
sage: D({0:[2, 3]})
Chain(0:(2, 3))
sage: D({0:[2, 3], 1:[4, 5]})
Chain with 2 nonzero terms over Integer Ring
sage: z = D({1:[0,1]})
sage: z.is_boundary()
False
sage: (2*z).is_boundary()

I've been busy with various departmental duties for the past month, but I'd like to start reviewing this soon. I don't know how to review git tickets, though, and the directions I've found seem to be contradictory (if I download Sage from git and type `make`, it fails because the top-level Makefile refers to spkg/pipestatus, while everything has been moved from `spkg` to `build`. If I switch branches to `build_system`, then it builds but `./sage --dev ...` doesn't work).

Furthermore, I don't know how to look at the relevant changes easily. Do I really need to look at half a dozen different changesets, or is there a unified view somewhere? On this ticket, the "branch" field doesn't seem to be active, but on a ticket like #15202, if I click on "Commits" I get a pretty diagram, and then from there if I click on "View changes", I get "504 Gateway Time-out.  The server didn't respond in time." I guess I'm supposed to click on the branch name instead?

Hey Volker and John,

I've worked in all of John's documentation changes and made a few of my own (plus rebased to the latest version of Sage). I don't think we should deprecate `torsion_list()` as it's not doing any harm and someone might find (or be finding) it useful. If you're happy with my changes, then I think we can set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis
