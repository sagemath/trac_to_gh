# Issue 15414: Let MPIR build correctly on Cygwin64

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15651

Original creator: jpflori

Original creation time: 2014-01-09 08:53:51

CC:  kcrisman dimpase tscrim

Keywords: cygwin spkg mpir

We have to modify the ABI tricks in our spkg-instal script, but also patch MPIR so that it uses correct assembly (see upstream commits at https://github.com/wbhart/mpir/commits/master/configure.ac).

I forgot to mention this here, but I was able to install MPIR on Cygwin64. Yet with #14648 failing on my other machines, the positive review will have to wait until that's done.

And MPIR 2.7 is on the way (which hopefully includes all fixes necessary, except those to `spkg-install` of course).

#15015 should supercede this ticket.

So, this ticket should be closed now?

I'd say we shoudl wait for MPIR 2.7.0 to be released and #15015 to be merged.
