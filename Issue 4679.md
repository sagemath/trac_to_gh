Tim,

please make sure to assign a milestone when opening a ticket. This is usually the current merge milestone, i.e. 3.2.2 at the moment.

Cheers,

Michael

No problem. The new trac release 0.11.2 we will be upgrading to in about a week let's the admin assign default milestones from a panel, so in the future this will become a non-issue.

Cheers,

Michael
