Keywords: latte

As I promised in the discussion of #18211,
we have made a new release of LattE, which gives an nonzero exit code on errors (this was a regression).
The spkg has been upgraded in #18458.
I suppose the code of sage.geometry.polyhedron.Polyhedron_ZZ::ehrhart_polynomial which worked around this could now be cleaned up.


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18475

You guys wanted to use LattE's exit codes somehow for more robust error handling.
