    0: D. E. Knuth writes: "Before Fibonacci wrote his work, the sequence F_{n} had already been discussed by Indian scholars, who had long been interested in rhythmic patterns that are formed from one-beat and two-beat notes. The number of such rhythms having n beats altogether is F_{n+1}; therefore both Gopāla (before 1135) and Hemachandra (c. 1150) mentioned the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ... explicitly."

Kak), the generalized Fibonacci sequence a, b, a + b, a + 2b, 2a + 3b, 3a + 5b, ... can also be described as the Gopala-Hemachandra numbers H(n) = H(n-1) + H(n-2), with F(n) = H(n) for a = b = 1, and Lucas sequence L(n) = H(n) for a = 2, b = 1. - Lekraj Beedassy, Jan 11 2015
    2: Susantha Goonatilake writes: "[T]his sequence was well known in South Asia and used in the metrical sciences. Its development is attributed in part to Pingala (200 BC), later being associated with Virahanka (circa 700 AD), Gopala (circa 1135), and Hemachandra (circa 1150)—all of whom lived and worked prior to Fibonacci."

Changing status from new to needs_review.

this fixes the doctests, but is not robust to future changes in the database.

works for me, patchbot is green with respect to everything except for 1 unrelated doctest failure.
