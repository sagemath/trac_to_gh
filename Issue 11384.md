Patch is mostly up for safe-keeping.

(a) Passes most tests in `sage/modules`, failures are just output formatting.

(b) Functional, see module-level docs for `vector_space_homspace.py`.

(c) `vector_space_morphisms.py` remains to be overhauled - significant module-level documentation, a friendly constructor, and general touch-up.

(d) Need to add two new files to the overall reference documentation.

Hi Robert,

There are very few changes that I propose for this patch. Sorry, for not making them myself, but I somehow happened to lack time again.

1. Add newline at the end of free_module_morphism.py.
2. In vector_space_morphism.py l.475f it is not clear what side refers to. Delete the sentence?
3. l. 639 of the same file contains a typo.
4. l. 689ff do the imports globally. If for conflicts you cannot move the import statements to the file's head, move at least as many as you can.
5. l. 756ff is indeed no sufficient to check for linearity. Is there a specific reason why you don't use is_polynomial()? Then check the degree and you are fine.
6. l. 775 do you want to keep that line or rather merge with l. 732?
7. l. 856 move this import if possible

With these very minor changes made, this ticket deserves a positive review.

Actual output from `_repr_()` once made it clearer, but I trimmed the amount of output later.  I will expand the sentence.

> 5. l. 756ff is indeed no sufficient to check for linearity. Is there a

I did not think I could fully protect against all possible symbolic expressions sneaking through.  But I had not thought about  is_polynomial()  which sounds like a good idea.

> 6. l. 775 do you want to keep that line or rather merge with l. 732?

Mistaken leftover from various attempts to get unique parents.  ;-)

> 7. l. 856 move this import if possible

Generally:  I did some reading a few months ago about imports, and got the impression that there was very little cost to placing within a method a statement like


```
import foo.bar
```


and then subsequently calling as


```
answer = foo.bar.stuff()
```


This is not exactly what is happening at l. 856, but on other tickets, you have suggested moving imports.  What is the best strategy?  I thought in module headers it would count against startuptime?  Guess I'm just confused on what is best.

Thanks for all the help on all these tickets.  It is really good to see them all getting wrapped up.

Concerning the imports and the performance, the following link might help:

It exposes my suggestion as premature, and if you like to keep the imports as they are, do so.

Hi Martin,

Caught me just in time on the imports.  Thanks for the link, that was helpful and confirmed my understanding from before.  I can do a bit of cleanup on the imports, and will move one that is used twice to the top of the file.  Otherwise, I will largely leave all those imports in the constructor since I think it makes the rest of the module easier to read with all those segregated.

I'm not sure `is_polynomial()` is going to work.  Consider:


```
sage: var('x y')
(x, y)
sage: g(x, y) = x*y
sage: g.is_polynomial(x)
True
sage: g.is_polynomial(y)
True
sage: g.degree(x)
1
sage: g.degree(y)
1
```


I think I can do worse, with negative and/or fractional exponents.  I'm open to ideas, but I guess I'm back to feeling there is no good way to confirm an arbitrary (callable) symbolic expression as being multivariate linear (including no constant term).  Will post a patch of changes in a few minutes, or later today.

Rob

Thanks, Leif.  I'm taking a short break from Sage work, but will attend to the easy ones (like this rebase) very soon.  I've got a couple outstanding items on tickets you've touched, but feel free to ping me on anything critical.  (I need to start by building the latest alpha!)

A variety of doctests were fixed on #10793 and I fixed them too here, since code here was more strict than before and picked up the same error.  So hunk failures were "correct" since they were not needed with #10793 merged.  v5 version of main patch mostly just re-exports the v4 version without the failures.  I had to fix one hunk by hand where my changes were a mix of #10793 changes and truly-new changes.  Passes tests on affected files and sage/modules.

I think that is right.  v5 patch is a rebase on Martin's positive review at comment 12.  There was some duplication of effort prior to the rebase, I was fixing some incorrect doctests, while another patch was doing the same thing.  So IIRC those are the only real changes in the rebase (ie it was not a trivial matter, but if this applies and passes tests now then it should be ready to go).

Beat you to it.  Combined the three patches into one.  I hope reviewers (Grout, Raum) don't mind that now it only has my name on it, but I wanted to finish this one off.

Passes all long tests on 4.8.alpha3, so the reject should have been handled correctly, since it involved changes to a doctest.
