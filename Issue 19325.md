Currently

```
sage: F1 = FiniteEnumeratedSet((1,2,3))
sage: F2 = FiniteEnumeratedSet((1., 2., 3.))
sage: F2.an_element().parent()
Integer Ring
```
We fix this problem by computing a universe associated to each `FiniteEnumeratedSet`.

I think raising an `ArgumentError` would be more appropriate here than a simple assert. After all, one of the arguments is invalid.
