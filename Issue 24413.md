This is well-known trouble, simple (conditional on `_sun` or so) changing `dd_fd` to `d_fd` should fix it.

On Solaris 11, one has `dirfd()`, and 

```
CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -DHAVE_DIRFD" ./sage -i subprocess32
```
works. The problem with the source is that it provides a (hacky) workaround for older Solaris systems, that lack `dirfd()`, but do not check for the version.

I don't know why  `HAVE_DIRFD` is not defined by Solaris, it might be a GNUism, in fact.

`subprocess32` is a backport from Python3. They backported the C sources but not the `configure` script which defines macros like `HAVE_DIRFD`. So this can never work...

I am willing to give this a positive review, provided there is a message printed
by spkg-install regarding running fix_config.py --- otherwise it looks totally mysterious why it actually works (it did work for me).
