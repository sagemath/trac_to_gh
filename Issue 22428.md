# Issue 22428: Plotting a list of plots is broken

Issue created by migration from Trac.

There is some evidence that this used to work:

```
D = disk((0.0,0.0), 1, (pi, 3*pi/2))
plot([D,D])
```

This is plotting a list of plots.

In #9623 code like this was added. Currently, this ticket is what breaks `interacts.algebra.polar_prime_spiral`

I think that maybe what would be better is to fix the interact to use the graphics array and then post-hoc make this command use graphics array if possible.  Presumably this was on analogy with

```
f(x) = x^2
g(x) = x^3
plot([f,g](x,0,1))
```

but unless this is documented _somewhere_ I'm not sure we need to support it as fixing a defect.

What does "this command" in the sentence above refer to?

Fine for me, that's even easier.

Oh, I was just about to try your branch!   See my emended description - for the interact there is surely a workaround, but this is worth having a ticket for.

It would not make really make sense to return a graphics array: it would be inconsistent with `plot([sin(x), cos(x)])` (which creates 1 graphics object) and redundant with `graphics_array`.

If we do support plotting a list of plots, we should also allow heterogenous lists like `plot([sin(x), point((0,0))])` (a function and a graphics object).

So I think the only reasonable options are an error or putting everything on the same plot. Obviously, the latter is more user-friendly.

Fair enough.
> we should also allow heterogenous lists
That would actually be a big point in favor of this, as currently that is more tedious since one needs to add plots.

What about weird recursion - what is `plot([D,plot(D)])` supposed to return?  Also, your initial example of `plot([D,D])` probably "looks like" only one disk, correct?  There are also subtle zorder issues to consider, but I guess those are already inherent in the additive notation as well.

Anyway, all that to say don't remove this branch yet, perhaps it will be good to go.  Unfortunately you based it on rc1 and I only had rc0 so here we go waiting for compilation again (giac takes a while), meantime students will be coming within mere minutes ... sigh.

However, one might find confusion with other keywords around linestyle or other things that don't apply to all plot types, since `plot([sin(x), point((0,0))])` is quite unlikely but `plot([sin(x), point((0,0))],(x,0,pi))` might be likely - what should that return?  What should `plot([sin(x), disk((0,0),5,(0,2*pi))],(x,0,1))` return?  Or is this an error?

So far in my testing everything works fine (no surprise) but I'm really not sure what the "right" outcome is for this:

```
plot([sin(x), circle((0,0),5)],(x,0,1),linestyle=":",thickness=20,color='green', fill=True)
```

vis-a-vis

```
plot(sin(x),linestyle=":",thickness=20,color='green',fill=True)+circle((0,0),5,linestyle=":",thickness=20,color='green')
```

which is rather different.

Ideas?   I hate to get in the business of propagating these options, so in principle one should just say that if you didn't feed it to `circle()` it doesn't happen; on the other hand, it _is_ ambiguous.
