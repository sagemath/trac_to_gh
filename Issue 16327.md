This builds for me along with its documentation, and looks pretty great. Here are some remarks.

(1) In the method `_test_derivation` you may also want to test that `d(f)` is zero, or more precisely that if we calculate `d(f)` term by term we also get 0. Or yet differently, the lift to a derivation in both x and y should send f to zero.

(2) Similarly, you may want to check that the deriviation is non-trivial.

(3) In the docstring, it seems better to use `k` for the field of constants instead of `K`, simply for consistency, and leave `K` to be the function field in question. You may also want to point out that you do not assume `K` to be the function field of an absolutely irreducible curve. (This is why you need `k` to be perfect.)

In the first part of the description of the algorithm, you may want to write "a rational function field `F` over `k`" instead of "another function field `F`", and in the complementary case you can mention that this is where you use the hypothesis on `k` being perfect.

Points (1) and (2) are not very important; indeed, I performed done thousands of ad hoc tests of them without a single error, and the algorithms are mathematically correct as far as I can judge. Only the points in (3) apply. They are very small and apart from them this addition seems completely neat.
