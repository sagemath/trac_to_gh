# Issue 13178: Cannot import rpy2.rinterface.rinterface on Cygwin

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13350

Original creator: jpflori

Original creation time: 2012-08-08 19:09:32

Assignee: tbd

Keywords: cygwin r rpy2

cygchecking the corresponding dll shows that libR.dll cannot be found.
Indeed, it resides in SAGE_LOCAL/lib/R/lib/ which is not part of PATH.
Adding it to path seems to fix the issue.
