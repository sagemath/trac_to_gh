```
sage: gap.load_package("tomlib")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-cc487c826f42> in <module>()
----> 1 gap.load_package("tomlib")

/home/dima/software/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/interfaces/gap.pyc in load_package(self, pkg, verbose)
    504         if x == 'fail':
    505             raise RuntimeError("Error loading Gap package "+str(pkg)+". "+
--> 506                                "You may want to install the gap_packages SPKG.")
    507
    508     def eval(self, x, newlines=False, strip=True, split_lines=True, **kwds):

RuntimeError: Error loading Gap package tomlib. You may want to install the gap_packages SPKG.
```

is misleading, as this (and some other) GAP packages are in `database_gap`.
