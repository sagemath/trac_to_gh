In OS X, viewing a directory like devel/sage/doc/en/ in the Finder can create a file `.DS_Store`, and then the docbuilder thinks that it is a piece of documentation to be built. We should ignore it.

The attached patch adds ".DS_Store" to the list of documents to ignore. We could instead (or in addition) only add documents if they are directories.

This solution is nicer and would fix more than just .DS_Store issues (assuming that such things arise).
