More testing, esp. on OSX and Cygwin, needed.

The tuning is much faster in this version so I think we should alter some of the settings in `spkg-install` before we finalise the ticket.

On FreeBSD with CC=clang-3.8 this is problematic if I set `SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes`, that is, will have

More precisely: I have no objection if you try to run some tuning before creating the binary package, but you don't have to.

There's probably less craftsmanship in the tuning thresholds of gf2x than with, e.g., gmp. But the default should nevertheless be fine.

In fact, doing limited tuning with `TOOM_TUNING_LIMIT=100` probably does more harm than good, since the default tables are computed with a larger limit.

Well, as a matter of fact, tuning is much faster in 1.2, time considerations probably lead to `TOOM_TUNING_LIMIT=100` (I don't speak from authority, that's my guess), and I think we should at least drop it in 1.2. The FFT tuning on the other hand runs and runs.... forever.

Have a good night.

hopefully the last commit summarises the discussion right.
I have also removed the time limit `TOOM_TUNING_LIMIT=100`, it still builds in 2 minutes on my Linux desktop, with default settings.

I also checked that with `SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes` it builds (very fast), and with 
`SAGE_TUNE_GF2X="full"` (triggering FFT tuning) it takes about 45 minutes to complete.
