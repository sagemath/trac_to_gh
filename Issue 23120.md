removed the patches and bumped up the version; this works on Linux with gcc, seemingly without problems. 

More testing, esp. on OSX and Cygwin, needed.

The tuning is much faster in this version so I think we should alter some of the settings in `spkg-install` before we finalise the ticket.

More precisely: I have no objection if you try to run some tuning before creating the binary package, but you don't have to.

There's probably less craftsmanship in the tuning thresholds of gf2x than with, e.g., gmp. But the default should nevertheless be fine.

In fact, doing limited tuning with `TOOM_TUNING_LIMIT=100` probably does more harm than good, since the default tables are computed with a larger limit.

Well I think it is stupid to make a generic package and then somehow tuning it again to the building cpu. Even without using special instructions, that feels a bit daft.

Well, as a matter of fact, tuning is much faster in 1.2, time considerations probably lead to `TOOM_TUNING_LIMIT=100` (I don't speak from authority, that's my guess), and I think we should at least drop it in 1.2. The FFT tuning on the other hand runs and runs.... forever.

Have a good night.

hopefully the last commit summarises the discussion right.
I have also removed the time limit `TOOM_TUNING_LIMIT=100`, it still builds in 2 minutes on my Linux desktop, with default settings.

I also checked that with `SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes` it builds (very fast), and with 
`SAGE_TUNE_GF2X="full"` (triggering FFT tuning) it takes about 45 minutes to complete.

Yes, I looked at the patchbot source code and it looks like it should be able (albeit a bit hackishly--maybe there should be a ticket field specifically for upstream tarballs).  I guess I just figured by now there'd be at least one.
