CC:  mmarco

See http://ask.sagemath.org/question/25327/casting-symbolic-fractions-to-fraction-field-of-polynomial-ring/

Something like

```
sage: ex=(x+1)/(x-1); ex
(x + 1)/(x - 1)
sage: ex.numerator().polynomial(ZZ)/ex.denominator().polynomial(ZZ)
(x + 1)/(x - 1)
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.fraction_field_element.FractionFieldElement'>
```

made into an `Expression` method, perhaps named `fraction(...)` with the ring as argument.

It looks good, although maybe some more doctest would be better. One with nontrivial numerator,  one with several variables, using other rings, etc.

Done. Though I'm of the opinion that every computation path in the associated code needs only be tested once (so it's actually up to doctests in `polynomial_element.__div__` to be exhaustive). But I understand it maybe a demonstration of function behaviour.
