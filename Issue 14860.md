# Issue 14860: improve documentation of is_prime

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15097

Original creator: zimmerma

Original creation time: 2013-08-25 11:00:58

Keywords: beginner

The documentation of `is_prime` says:

```
sage: n=17                 
sage: n.is_prime?
...
   * "proof" -- If False, use a strong pseudo-primality test. If True,
     use a provable primality test.  If unset, use the default
     arithmetic proof flag.
```

however no example or pointer is given to explain how to access or change the "default arithmetic proof flag".

I abused your ticket to test the git dev scripts. I turned your patch into a branch. I hope you don't mind.
