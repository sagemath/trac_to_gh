Keywords: beginner

The documentation of `is_prime` says:

```
sage: n=17                 
sage: n.is_prime?
...
   * "proof" -- If False, use a strong pseudo-primality test. If True,
     use a provable primality test.  If unset, use the default
     arithmetic proof flag.
```

however no example or pointer is given to explain how to access or change the "default arithmetic proof flag".
