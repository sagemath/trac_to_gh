Here's a minimal solution for this blocker issue.

More comprehensive solutions for the complicated "configure" situation as previously discussed in #29491 can be done in the 9.5 series; or hopefully upstream PARI could be convinced to provide a way to obtain the pari.cfg location.

Fedora configures PARI without threads on 32 bit, so configure rejects it.

```
