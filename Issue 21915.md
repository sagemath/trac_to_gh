Before:

```
sage: sage: QQi.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
....: sage: Pol.<x> = QQi[]
....: sage: pol = x + i + 1
sage: %timeit pol*pol
The slowest run took 26.56 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 12.7 µs per loop
sage: %timeit pol**5
10000 loops, best of 3: 55.1 µs per loop
sage: %timeit pol._mul_trunc_(pol, 3)
The slowest run took 7.09 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 14.7 µs per loop
```

After:

```
sage: sage: QQi.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
....: sage: Pol.<x> = QQi[]
....: sage: pol = x + i + 1
sage: %timeit pol*pol
The slowest run took 8.00 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 8.14 µs per loop
sage: %timeit pol**5
10000 loops, best of 3: 34.3 µs per loop
sage: %timeit pol._mul_trunc_(pol, 3)
The slowest run took 8.56 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.88 µs per loop

Looks good overall. From a quick look through the code, it seems like the inputs to the `do_*` methods always take lists as inputs. Likewise, should we make `list` a `cpdef` method that guarantees a list being returned? This might get us some extra speed as well.

You might be loosing some speed by variables not being cdef'ed as a list. Did you happen to save your current branch? I can play around with it later tonight to see if I can get some extra speed out of it.

This didn't give as much of a speed bump as I was expecting. I also made some other improvements by using `get_unsafe` and other things. Here are my timings:

Thanks for the improvements! I cleaned up the branch a little (rebased, squashed my "wip" commit into the following one) without changing the code.

Regarding `_new_constant_poly()` for sparse polynomials: I really don't think I'll have time to make further changes until Feb. 8 at best, though I'll do my best to review yours if you make some. In any case I'm happy with the current branch; you can set the ticket to positive review if you agree, assuming the patchbot doesn't find anything to complain about.

Since the failure has to do with p-adics, I suspect the reason may be that:

```
sage: Pol.<x> = Qp(5)[]
sage: pol = 1 + O(5)*x
sage: pol.degree()
0
sage: list(pol)
[1 + O(5^20), O(5)]
```

I don't know if this is intentional, nor why the implementation of p-adics take this convention. (I'd have expected `degree()` to check that the coefficients are nonzero using `__nonzero__()`, and `__nonzero__()` to return true except when its argument is *exactly* zero, like it does for some other inexact parents.)

I don't think we made any other functional changes as `get_unsafe` has to be consistent with `__getitem__` (for non-slices). Everything else is extending current behavior or passing type info to Cython.

I'm not sure if that is intentional either. We might need to ask someone more familiar with the p-adics. Although that could be something we push to another ticket too.
