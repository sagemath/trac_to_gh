Why is it `*.s??` rather than `.*.s??` in the first place? Are there platforms (where git and sage otherwise work) where swapfile names do not start with dots?

See "man vim".

Replying to [comment:4 vbraun]:
> See "man vim".

Indeed, on my system, `man vim` states that

  The swap file is a file with the same file‚Äê name as the text  file  with  ".swp"  appended.

But the vim manual adds

   On Unix, a '.' is prepended to swap file names in the same directory as the edited file. 

and this is what I observe. Does sage work (with git and all) on any non-Unix-like sytem (typically Amiga, MSDOS, on native Win32)?

I don't know anything about vim that cannot be found in the man page.

PS: Sage right now needs a unix-like environment but portable is still better than not portable.

Fine, I guess changing to a more restrictive pattern is an improvement in any case.
