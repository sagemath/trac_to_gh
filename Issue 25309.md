The Sage Jupyter kernel is unconditionally installed in `sys.prefix`. However, this should instead be the `install_data` directory. This defaults to the installation prefix, which in turn defaults to `sys.prefix`. So the default won't change, but it allows customization.

The reason for choosing `install_data` is to be compatible with other Jupyter packages, which use the `data_files` option to `setup()` for installing Jupyter files.

That looks like it may greatly simplify my life. I have still one issue about the current setup but it is comparatively minor - I think the code installing the kernel should live under `sage_setup` since you are not supposed to use it at runtime. But that can wait.

I don't know whether it's documented, but it's the directory where `data_files` are installed. As I explained in the ticket description, it's certainly the right directory to use.

I think that page takes about about `install_data` *command*, not the `install_data` *directory*.

I can't even find the default value of that variable by grepping through the distutils source. However as long as it is relative to `--prefix`, thats fine by me and should solve #25328.
