Implement the algorithm proposed in [1] for finding k edge-disjoint spanning trees in a simple graph. If edges are weighted, the sum of the weights of the return trees is minimized.

This will be useful for #32169.

Just one trivial doc change:

```diff
-      that the weight_function outputs a number for each edge
+      that the ``weight_function`` outputs a number for each edge
```

Once done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
