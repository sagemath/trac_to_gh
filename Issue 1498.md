sorry, let me refrase:
i think there is a bug in the online notebook such that:


there are about 200 or so notebooks edited exactly '171 days ago'
and then relatively few in the last two weeks.

i.e. probably when the notebook gets restarted it doesn't
keep the date that other existing notebooks were created.

sorry that it has nothing to do with the above,
just thought i would mention that.

I don't think this is valid.  It doesn't make any sense.  It's probably just because of
how we migrated an older server or something.
