Assignee: jason, was

I just came up with the following bug. `point2d` takes list as input (possibly empty). It also takes an iterator as input, but it must be non empty which is not fun :


```
sage: point2d([])     # works, return empty graphic
sage: point2d(iter([]))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: points must have 2 coordinates in a 2d line
```
