# Issue 21174: New numerical noise in symbolic/function.pyx

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: leif

Original creation time: 2016-09-03 18:06:51

Keywords: doctest error, erf, fast_eval, tolerance, precision

Popped up in Sage 7.4.beta2 (or probably some earlier beta):

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/libs/gap/assigned_names.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/symbolic/function.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The first is the usual failure, the second is new, and I don't know
where it originates from (as the doctest itself hasn't changed):

**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/symbolic/function.pyx", line 667, in
sage.symbolic.function.Function._fast_float_
Failed example:
    ff(1.5)
Expected:
    0.9661051464753108
Got:
    0.9661051464753109
**********************************************************************
```

(Native build on Haswell.)
