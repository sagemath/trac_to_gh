Keywords: doctest error, erf, fast_eval, tolerance, precision

Popped up in Sage 7.4.beta2 (or probably some earlier beta):

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/libs/gap/assigned_names.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/symbolic/function.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The first is the usual failure, the second is new, and I don't know
where it originates from (as the doctest itself hasn't changed):
