I've encountered a race condition a couple times when doing a build on Cygwin where, for one reason or other, the python2 package gets upgraded (or python3 if `--with-python=3`).  The error occurs in another package that is being built at the same time, I think when it tries to run the `sage-flock` command (which invokes `/usr/bin/env python`).  That's also why I've only seen this on Cygwin--it's only on Cygwin that `sage-flock` is being invoked at the end of each package install.

The error ends up looking something like this:

It says "Successfully installed" but then make exits with an error shortly thereafter.

The problem is that although ppl itself does not have a dependency on Python, `sage-spkg` itself does.  But the python2 files are still in the process of being copied over.  The `bin/python` has been copied, but not all of the stdlib, so that `bin/python` is broken.

I believe there are a few things that should be done about this.  First of all, putting a lock around all modifications to `$SAGE_LOCAL`, as discussed in #26018#comment:10 might help.

But I've mentioned in the context of other tickets that the build system itself should always stick to using the system python explicitly, and that Sage's Python should only be invoked explicitly in specific `spkg-installs` that need to build against the Sage Python.

I'll have to check out Volker's branch there.  Something like `sage-system-python` is one possible solution I considered (on that I'm still not entirely happy with but it's better than nothing).

I'm seeing this rather frequently now. The race was there for a long time but its getting more likely to hit.

IF we're going to close this ticket (which is fine) the milestone / priority on the existing ticket should also be updated, and maybe link to this ticket which I believe adds more context.
