Unbundling is considered a good thing in general. About `qhull`, being able to use an external version of it in matplotlib has flip-floped. It wasn't possible in some previous releases.

Hi!  Is it possible that this change is responsible for the difference between the following two images?

* [This one](https://opentext.uleth.ca/apex-standard/images/img_sketch1c.svg)
* [This one](https://16913697885453631822.googlegroups.com/attach/9538235d19b10/img_sketch1c.svg?part=0.1&view=1&vt=ANaJVrGjnIDaV7eWDiVRwnImxBhO2LClXYxNTLe-9OBHaeiSulY6a_0WItVZbBtUH76EEqwIZs-vqF9NnF32b0k-n7sqwgiDzZCMRpJakCI4j8a_n1BfLJU)

Notice that not only is the image slightly narrower, but the labels now all have default of one place beyond the decimal point, which in the past was not desired for the evident reasons we see here.  That might be good for scientific plotting, but not for mathematical plotting.
