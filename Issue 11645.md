Keywords: sage_getdoc format embedding

The purpose of this ticket is to fix two bugs.

**__First problem__**

Theere is a bug in `sage.misc.sagedoc.format`, that ironically makes that `format?` does not show the documentation of `format`.

```
sage: from sage.misc.sagedoc import format
sage: format.__doc__
'\n    Format Sage documentation ``s`` for viewing with IPython.\n\n    This calls ``detex`` on ``s`` to convert LaTeX commands to plain\n    text, and if ``s`` contains a string of the form "<<<obj>>>",\n    then it replaces it with the docstring for "obj".\n\n    INPUT:\n\n    - ``s`` - string\n    - ``embedded`` - boolean (optional, default False)\n\n    OUTPUT: string\n\n    Set ``embedded`` equal to True if formatting for use in the\n    notebook; this just gets passed as an argument to ``detex``.\n\n    EXAMPLES::\n\n        sage: from sage.misc.sagedoc import format\n        sage: identity_matrix(2).rook_vector.__doc__[115:184]\n        \'Let `A` be a general `m` by `n`\\n        (0,1)-matrix with `m \\\\le n`. \'\n        sage: format(identity_matrix(2).rook_vector.__doc__[115:184])\n        \'Let A be a general m by n\\n   (0,1)-matrix with m <= n.\\n\'\n\n    If the first line of the string is \'nodetex\', remove \'nodetex\' but\n    don\'t modify any TeX commands::\n    \n        sage: format("nodetex\\n`x \\\\geq y`")\n        \'\\n`x \\\\geq y`\'\n\n    Testing a string enclosed in triple angle brackets::\n\n        sage: format(\'<<<identity_matrix\')\n        \'<<<identity_matrix\\n\'\n        sage: format(\'identity_matrix>>>\')\n        \'identity_matrix>>>\\n\'\n        sage: format(\'<<<identity_matrix>>>\')[:28]\n        \'Definition: identity_matrix(\'\n    '
sage: format?
Type:		function
Base Class:	<type 'function'>
String Form:	<function format at 0xcc8a28>
Namespace:	Interactive
File:		/mnt/local/king/SAGE/broken/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/misc/sagedoc.py
Definition:	format(s, embedded=False)
Docstring:
    <no docstring>
```


The problem is that the doc string contains `<<<obj>>>`, which means that it is attempted to find and insert documentation for `obj` (which does not exist).

**__Suggestion__**

Introduce a new directive `noreplace`, that avoids replacement of `<<<obj>>>`. Or perhaps a better suggestion: Catch the error, and do not replace if there is an error.

**__Second problem__**

If sage.misc.sagedoc.my_doc is applied to an object with a `_sage_doc_` method then it uses it, without formatting. That means: No tex code is turned into ascii art, and embedding information is not stripped.

**__Suggestion__**

Consequently use `sage.misc.sageinspect.sage_getdoc`.

Actually I think it would be good to both have a "noreplace" directive and catching an error, when dealing with `<<<obj>>>`.

}
```

With the attached patch, one can do:

```
sage: from sage.misc.sagedoc import format
sage: format?
Type:           function
Base Class:     <type 'function'>
String Form:    <function format at 0xc290c8>
Namespace:      Interactive
File:           /mnt/local/king/SAGE/debug/sage-4.7.2.alpha3-prerelease/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/misc/sagedoc.py
Definition:     format(s, embedded=False)
Docstring:
       Format Sage documentation ``s`` for viewing with IPython.
    
       This calls ``detex`` on ``s`` to convert LaTeX commands to plain
       text, unless the directive ``nodetex`` is given in the first line
       of the string.
...
```


Note that I introduced a `noreplace` directive, and used it on `format`'s docstring.

Also, interactive doc read does not blindly use a custom `_sage_doc_`: It will always use `sage_getdoc`, which does preprocessing:

```
sage: r = 'some doc for a cython method\n`x \\geq y`'
sage: class Foo:
....:     def _sage_doc_(self):
....:         return r
....: 
sage: f = Foo()
sage: f?
Type:           instance
Base Class:     __main__.Foo
String Form:    <__main__.Foo instance at 0xb0ce18>
Namespace:      Interactive
File:           /mnt/local/king/SAGE/debug/sage-4.7.2.alpha3-prerelease/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/FakeModule
.py   
Docstring:
    some doc for a cython method x >= y

```

Without the patch, the latex code would be shown.

If the `noreplace` directive is not used, but the to-be-replaced-with object can not be found, the replacement is simply skipped. Some new doctest related with directives and replacement:

```
sage: print format('File: bla.py (starting at line 1)\nnodetex, noreplace\n<<<identity_matrix>>>`\\not= 0`')
File: bla.py (starting at line 1)
<<<identity_matrix>>>`\not= 0`
```


```
sage: print format('<<<bla\n<<<bla>>>\n<<<identity_matrix>>>')
<<<bla <<<bla>>>
<BLANKLINE>
Definition: identity_matrix(ring, n=0, sparse=False)
<BLANKLINE>
   Return the n x n identity matrix over the given ring.
...
```


I didn't run all tests (only those of sage.misc.sagedoc)
