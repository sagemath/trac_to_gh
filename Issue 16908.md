I have no idea what just happened but I'm not reviewing this...

I just merged #16996 into this ticket since they make conflicting edits to `deps`

...making this ticket essentially impossible to review.

You reviewed already b5faaca, there is nothing else do do here.

Well, I was in the process of doing just a review (before getting interrupted by my day job it is 11am here) and I object to this line in sage-notebook

```
+from sage.env import SAGE_ROOT
```

SAGE_ROOT is not used here and shouldn't have been used in the previous instance. I'll have some fun reviewing a number of sage-on-gentoo patches just as consequence of this ticket.

Then you should have posted that on #16996 before it was reviewed ;-) I'll remove the unused import in the next ticket if you don't beat me to it...

Cannot even make complete and correct sentences, that's how busy I have been all day.
