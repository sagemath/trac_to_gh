In #17693, an alternative implementation of `MutablePoset.remove` was discussed. At the moment, it is not clear which of the two implementations is more efficient.

The code here uses more comparison but fewer link following operations.

In this ticket, I attach the alternative code such that it is not lost. At a later point, when the asymptotic ring is more advanced, some benchmarking should be done to compare the two variants and to come to a decision.
