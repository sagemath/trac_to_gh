The OSX binary sage-5.0-OSX-64bit-10.6-x86_64-Darwin.dmg dies in MPFR on Core 2 Duo processors. Newer CPUs are fine, most likely too aggressive CFLAGS (are we correctly dialing them down if SAGE_FAT_BINARY is set?)

Can you disassemble to see which instruction failed?

This MPFR binary was built with

```
-Wall -Wmissing-prototypes -Wpointer-arith -O2 -m64 -march=corei7 -mtune=corei7 
```


MPIR was built with

```
-O2 -m64 -march=corei7 -mtune=corei7
```


So, SAGE_FAT_BINARY indeed doesn't work as it should.

`SAGE_FAT_BINARY` should be synonymous with `SAGE_GENERIC_BINARY`, though for historical reasons it isn't named well. From http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html:

SAGE_FAT_BINARY - to prepare a binary distribution that will run on the widest range of target machines, set this variable to "yes"

I think right now you don't remove advanced `CFLAGS` on linux platfroms if `SAGE_FAT_BINARY` is set.

MPIR actually does support "fat binaries" in the true sense on x86 systems: building a library with code for different processors, determining at run-time which one to use.

I would think that any spkg installed (i.e., built from source on the machine it's running on) would work.  Isn't the issue when it's built on another machine (with newer processor) and then the resulting binary used on an older machine?

Why do we have to set CFLAGS at all, then?

Also, is this really true? With all CFLAGS turned on won't the compiler potentially emit advanced instructions in the surrounding library code, outside of the time-critical algorithms?

and I believe the equivalent command on OSX would be `otool -tV`. Shouldn't we add some script to `sage -bdist` that checks for the absence of, say, SSE >= 4 instructions?

yes, that's right (except it's not .so, but .dylb)

The problem seems to be in the inability of non-Apple gcc to build fat, a.k.a. universal, dynamic libs and executables. So I think we should either resort to making binary releases for OSX targeted to a particular architecture, or provide some post-install script that basically would do ./sage -f mpir (and anything else that needs similar fix) followed by ./sage -b.

That description is certainly insufficient (or, to be more precise, one shouldn't read it from right to left).  One should in general not prepare "fat" binaries on relatively new (e.g. Core i7) CPUs -- unless one knows what one's doing... ;-)

IMHO the main purpose of `SAGE_FAT_BINARY` is to avoid the use of processor-specific ("hand-written") *assembly code* (and prevent Sage from using things like `-march=native`); it's still up to the *distributor* to make sure the compiler is targeted to the *desired* CPU family (whichever that is).




Doing some "sanity check" upon `sage -bdist` isn't all bad, but of course heavily depends on what (limited) architecture a specific binary distribution is supposed to be run on.
