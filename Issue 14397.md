Using sage-5.8 with #13131 merged in sage-5.10.beta0, I get


```
sage: table([('a','b','c'), (True, False,None)]) 
  a      b       c                               
  1      0       None                            
```


I was expecting :


```
sage: table([('a','b','c'), (True, False,None)]) 
  a      b       c                               
  True   False   None                            
```

I did not know about this `!s` I have never used this format syntax for strings...

Related to this same line, I got the following deprecation warning when I called table the first time in my session :


```python
/Users/slabbe/Applications/sage-5.8/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/misc/table.py:503:
PendingDeprecationWarning: object.__format__ with a non-empty format string is deprecated
  s += ("{:" + align_char + str(width) + "}").format(entry)
```


Do you get such warning also?

UPDATE : I am not able to reproduce the warning...

After reading http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html

and doing some tests, I now understand your suggestion :


```
sage: ("{:^10}").format(False)  
'    0     '        
sage: ("{!s:^10}").format(False)
'  False   '                    
sage: ("{!r:^10}").format(False)
'  False   '   
```



```
sage: ("{:^10}").format(None)   
'   None   '                    
sage: ("{!s:^10}").format(None) 
'   None   '                    
sage: ("{!r:^10}").format(None) 
'   None   '                                     
```


I think `!s` is preferable to `!r`, so I agree with your diff.

Here's a patch. By the way, I used this format syntax as an experiment, because it's going to be the standard way of doing things in Python 3.
