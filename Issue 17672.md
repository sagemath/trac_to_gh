Keywords: modular forms hecke triangle groups rankin cohen bracket

This ticket (will) add support for Rankin Cohen brackets for (quasi) modular forms.
The formulas shouldn't changefor Hecke triangle groups.

See:

- http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0509653
- http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3634v2

Todo:
- Check more general analytic types (quasi weak/meromorphic forms)
- Add validation of parameters (s,t)
- Explore the algebraic nature of the bracket:
  If s or t is None the bracket is no longer bilinear but it satisfy a Leibnitz rule
- More documentation and tests
- Explore alternative brackets

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17909

```
+        if not laurent_series.exponents():
```

* I do not like the change from "Basis matrix:" to "User basis matrix:"

* Here you should insert a blank line between the 2 lines

```
+        Return [self,g]_m, the ``m``th Rankin Cohen bracket of ``self`` with ``g``.
+        See ``self.parent().rankin_cohen_bracket`` for more information.
```
same here:

```
+        Return the summands of ``self`` divided by their depths.
+        This assumes that ``self`` has a depth (see :meth:`has_depth`).
```
* Avoid using `m=ZZ(1)` inside the function arguments. Use m=None there, and set m to 1 inside the function, if m is None.

hi chapoton

Thanks for the review. I tried to fix as much as possible.

Regarding the "User basis matrix":
That's due to the change "ambient_space._module.submodule" -> "ambient_space._module.submodule_with_basis". This is from like 4 years ago but I remember having had a very good reason for the change (it's a bugfix which I included in this change). If I recall correctly it just makes more sense to have coordinates with respect to the given basis. Why don't you like the change?

I executed pyflakes modform_hecketriangle/*.py and tried to fix most, what should I put in all.py and __init__.py?

Regards
Jonas

Hello,

I set the ticket to "needs works" because the branch turned red, which indicates a merge conflict with the latest beta release.

I can hear and understand your frustration. Because we are so few active people, it is very difficult for authors of tickets to get their code reviewed. And even more because of the mathematical nature of the tickets, that requires some mathematical understanding from the reviewer. It seems that most of the people that were very active on modular forms at the beginning of sage have left the boat, and turned to other interests.

Maybe you could contact people active with lmfdb.org and ask them if they could find somebody (some expert) to review your ticket ? I have added John Cremona in cc here ; maybe he can help somehow.
