In a first scan these doctests would have to be changed:

```
sage -t src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx  # 11 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/rings/polynomial/laurent_polynomial.pyx  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_zz_pex.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
```
