Currently one can only pick monomials which will be present in the defining polynomial of an anticanonical hypersurface of a CPR-Fano toric variety and choose names for coefficients of these monomials.

The patch allows using any rational functions as coefficients, in particular just concrete numbers. The base ring of the ambient space is automatically extended to include all coefficient names, but only if necessary.

I'd prefer it if "`Multivariate Polynomial Ring in no variables over Rational Field`" would just be "`Rational Field`" in this example:

```
sage: T2 = toric_varieties.P2().anticanonical_hypersurface(coefficients=[1,3,4,5,5])
sage: T2.coordinate_ring()
Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in no variables over Rational Field by the ideal (x^3 + 3*y^3 + 5*x*y*z + 4*z^3)
```

I think its within the scope of this ticket to get that right...
