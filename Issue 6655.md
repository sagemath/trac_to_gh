Hi Florent,

Thank you for this patch. Here are a couple of comments:

* Please use consistently "in English convention" instead of "in english notations",
see line 840, 963, 924.

* Would it be possible to lift the methods arm_length, leg_length, hook_length, arm_cells, etc also to SkewPartitions? I recently needed those and it would be convenient to have them directly in Sage.

Cheers,

Anne

Except for `cells` which I just added, they are all accessible through `l.outer().arm_length`... So I'm not sure we wan't to link all of those.
