On Intel, this still fails `tox -e local-macos-nohomebrew -- gfortran`, but it passes with the full bootstrapped build `tox -e local-macos-nohomebrew -- gcc`.

The failure when trying to build `gfortran` using Apple's gcc (clang) is introduced by the patch - passing the argument `-nodefaultrpaths` to the compiler.

I think many of our RDF doctests are frivolous. 

The RDF determinant goes through `scipy.linalg.det` as far I can see, and that is also what goes into the volume computation

One hypothesis in #31621 was the flag `-march=native` was causing problems somewhere: `openblas`, `gsl`, somewhere else?

For this ticket, it is certainly possible that these errors are not caused by building our own `gfortran` but by other packages which are built as a result of building our own `gfortran`.

Regarding `gsl`, `gfortran`, and `openblas`: with the branch here, on two different machines, I see

- If I do `./configure --with-system-gfortran=no`, everything builds, although I get numerical failures on one of the machines (Intel).
- If I instead do `./configure --with-system-openblas=no`, then `gsl` fails to build: the error says `ld: file not found: `@`rpath/libquadmath.0.dylib for architecture x86_64` (Intel) and similar on M2 (but with `arm64` at the end). On the Intel machine at least, I see the same with the previous version of `gsl`: the upgrade had no effect.
- If I instead do `./configure --with-system-gsl=no`, then everything builds and I do not see the same numerical failures.

So it's hard to tell whether the error is coming from `gfortran` or `openblas` or something else. I will try with the Intel machine doing `./configure --with-system-gfortran=no` without this branch and see if the same errors arise.
