I compiled 4.7.2 on the Live CD and got this error:

sage -t  -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/graphs/digraph.py" # Killed/
crashed

I ran the test with -verbose

```
Trying:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGABRT: An abort() occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a
bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.

The doctested process was killed by signal 6
         [5.7 s]
