# Issue 29455: Braid closure gives wrong link

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29692

The following code:


```
B=BraidGroup(5)
Link(B([3,4,3,-4])).plot()
```


shows an incorrect link. (Should be a disjoint union of unknots.)

There was a bug in the code that deletes the unused strands. I replaced the complicated part with a line that lets python do the work (and is therefore less likely to be buggy).

```
sage: # before the PR (incorrect)
sage: B = BraidGroup(5)
sage: L = Link(B([3,4,3,-4]))
sage: L
Link with 4 components represented by 4 crossings
sage: L.braid()
s0*s2*s0*s2^-1
```


```
sage: # after the PR (correct)
sage: B = BraidGroup(5)
sage: L = Link(B([3,4,3,-4]))
sage: L
Link with 1 component represented by 4 crossings
sage: L.braid()
s0*s1*s0*s1^-1
```

Changing keywords from "" to "knot, link, braid".

LGTM (assuming a green patchbot, but the relevant tests pass for me).

It also looks good to me (and much better than the older code). Good work.

Thanks, both of you, for reviewing the PR.
