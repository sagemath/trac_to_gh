(split out from #30315)

We propose to downgrade jmol to optional.  

It is still needed for
 - sagetex testsuite
 - PDF docbuild(?)
so we make installation of jmol conditional on these.

See discussion: â€‹https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/qKqTmLzHAbg/m/6YxQ_qWUBQAJ
... also for alternative technologies for creating 3D graphics for documentation and sagetex
