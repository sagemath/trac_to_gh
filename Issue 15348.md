This is fairly unlikely but occasionally comes up on the buildbot:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py

File "src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py", line 2236, in sage.homology.simplicial_complex.SimplicialComplex.is_cohen_macaulay
Failed example:
    S.is_cohen_macaulay(ncpus=3)
Expected:

Got:

    False
```

Apparently the code uses `@`parallel and there was already a race fixed in #14150.

Maybe, but that's not fixing the problem, just hiding it.

If you want to "fix" the problem but not hide it, just add `# known bug`.

at least it would be good to know what part of the code in question writes temp files with extension .out
(In my admittedly limited experience with parallel code I never saw slaves doing any file I/O; if they do they ought to clean up after themselves, otherwise there is not telling as to what will happen)

I almost always get this problem when running `MAKE='make -j8' make ptestlong` on a Ubuntu 16.04, with 8 cpus, with file system ext4.

I am now running `make testlong` in serially to see the difference.
