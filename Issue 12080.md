# Issue 12080: latex(number field) looks stupid (though is technically correct)

Issue created by migration from Trac.

For example,

```
sage: K = NumberField(x^2 +1, 'i'); K
Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
sage: latex(K)
\Bold{Q}[i]/(i^{2} + 1)
```


Any mathematician would smirk at this.

I think that this is a duplicate of #12196

The second one is fixed by #12196. The first one isn't changed, but I don't see what's wrong with the current output, to be honest.

David,  you are right.  This ticket should be closed as a dup.
