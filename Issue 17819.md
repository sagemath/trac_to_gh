`IntegerListsLex` is a highly used low level utility. It deserves to be Cythonized at some point, if not parallelized; but it's best to focus first on the algorithm (see #18055).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18056

Why does this ticket depend on #18055? I think it would be much better to reverse the dependency (i.e. #18055 should depend on this). Because improving the algorithm will be much easier once you can use Cython.
