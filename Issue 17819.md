`IntegerListsLex` is a highly used low level utility. It deserves to be Cythonized at some point, if not parallelized; but it's best to focus first on the algorithm (see #18055).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18056

Why does this ticket depend on #18055? I think it would be much better to reverse the dependency (i.e. #18055 should depend on this). Because improving the algorithm will be much easier once you can use Cython.

Maybe this will become true the day where running an interactive debugger will be trivial in Cython and recompilation will be instantaneous. In the mean time, I really don't see why Cythonizing can possibly make it easier. Besides, it remains to be decided whether we should go for Cython or for an external library in, say C++. This decision will be better taken once we know exactly what the algorithm looks like.
