# Issue 17819: Cythonize IntegerListsLex

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18056

`IntegerListsLex` is a highly used low level utility. It deserves to be Cythonized at some point, if not parallelized; but it's best to focus first on the algorithm (see #18055).

Why does this ticket depend on #18055? I think it would be much better to reverse the dependency (i.e. #18055 should depend on this). Because improving the algorithm will be much easier once you can use Cython.

Maybe this will become true the day where running an interactive debugger will be trivial in Cython and recompilation will be instantaneous. In the mean time, I really don't see why Cythonizing can possibly make it easier. Besides, it remains to be decided whether we should go for Cython or for an external library in, say C++. This decision will be better taken once we know exactly what the algorithm looks like.

This is already cythonized... should we close this ticket?

There is `from sage.combinat.integer_list_old import IntegerListsLex` which isn't used anymore. Should this be deprecated?

I think one can remove that file. There is a note from 2009 saying "do not use" !
