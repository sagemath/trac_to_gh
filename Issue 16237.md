CC:  @vbraun

There are some timeouts when doctesting on OS X 10.9 (Mavericks). For example:

```
$ ./sage -tp src/doc/en/constructions

...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t src/doc/en/constructions/algebraic_geometry.rst  # Timed out
sage -t src/doc/en/constructions/polynomials.rst  # Timed out
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
These seem to be caused by the changes in the Singular/pexpect interface from #15631.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16474

even after reverting the corresponding commit from #15631 I still get lots of doctest timeouts.

then I don't get the timeouts any more. (I get other doctest failures because of this, but no timeouts.)

I've debugged the issue on OSX 10.9 and when the hang happens
* Singular does print its header and prompt (captured with dtrace)
* Python never sees any output from the subprocess, the first select() in `pexpect.read_nonblocking` hangs forever.

One way to reduce the likelihood of the hang is to insert a sleep before first reading from the subproces (in `expect._start`)

The branch attached is obviously a no-op, and just moves the setecho(0) further down after we read the first prompt. But it seems to improve things in my limited testing.
