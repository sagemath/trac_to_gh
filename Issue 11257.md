We want our own code to enumerate lattice points in polyhedra because:
* Going through the PALP pexpect interface is annoyingly slow. 
* no more compile-time bounds
* It seems like PALP uses a very unsophisticated algorithm:
  {{{
sage: v = [(1,0,7,-1), (-2,-2,4,-3), (-1,-1,-1,4), (2,9,0,-5), (-2,-1,5,1)]
sage: lp = LatticePolytope(matrix(v).transpose()); lp
A lattice polytope: 4-dimensional, 5 vertices.
sage: lp.npoints()
    }}}
    takes forever with PALP but only 500ms with my Python code.

Hi Volker,

Would it make any sense to somehow unite these functions/classes with your PPL wrapper, which already has stuff for inequalities and their systems? Do you know if they (PPL-people) have plans on algorithms for point counts and point listing?

There are also functions without documentation or without full description of input/output...

I don't know the PPL future plans, but I don't think that some Cython code would fit into their project. Its also not functionality that fits with their core misson objective, I think.

I haven't used the usual standards of documentation for cdef'd functions since they aren't reachable from Python, so you'll never see the help. Nor can you write Python doctests for them. Also, I think documenting input/output is implicit when you have typed arguments.

Line numbers are for the new module in the big patch:

5. 336: No description of input/output and what happens if the polyhedron is not specified.
6. In the code of this function: why is it necessary to use this permutation? It seems like an extra operation on all of the points, although I believe that there is some reason ;-) Perhaps it can be explained in the documentation or comments.
7. 421: Incomplete INPUT, missing OUTPUT, no real EXAMPLE.

9. 477: If I am correct, this condition is always true. In which case it can be removed, as well the next line, and 444 moved into the beginning of outer while. (Just for making code a little simpler.)
10. I didn't yet looked carefully at the rest, but just one more pick at 575: Is it really necessary to have `DEF INEQ_INT_MAX_DIM = 20`? I mean can't it be without hard-coded limits?

Will look over the second half of the new module in the next few days, I am fine with the rest of the code.

Speedwise PALP is still more efficient for small polytopes, but of course only if one can call PALP at once for a lot of them, which is not always possible:

```
sage: len(ReflexivePolytopes(3))
4319
sage: %time
sage: ps = [Polyhedron(vertices=p.vertices().columns()) for p in ReflexivePolytopes(3)]
CPU time: 83.87 s,  Wall time: 218.85 s
sage: %time
sage: for p, lp in zip(ps, ReflexivePolytopes(3)):                                    
...       if len(p.integral_points()) != lp.npoints():
...           print lp
CPU time: 10.10 s,  Wall time: 10.30 s
sage: %time
sage: lattice_polytope.all_points(ReflexivePolytopes(3))
CPU time: 2.90 s,  Wall time: 3.46 s
```

The last line is actually somewhat sad: PALP spends half a second to compute all the points and then Sage spends 3 seconds to read its output and convert into matrices. But hopefully objects of new generations will be more efficient ;-)

3. I added a `len(pts)` to the `len(set(pts))` to clarify - the doctests checks that all points are distinct.
   6. The coordinates are permuted such that the largest edge of the bounding  box becomes the inner loop. The inner loop is optimized to run very fast, so we save wall time by doing the maximal amount of work there.
   9. No `inc` will usually be `1`. Usually you'll only have to call `prepare_inner_loop` between two inner loops. Only if the "odometer ticks over" you need to call `prepare_next_to_inner_loop`.

There is some overhead to avoid integer overflows and the like, which is a good thing. Possible improvements are
- don't permute coordinates (overhead) for really really small polyhedra, and
- allow to just count points without enumeration (since we already find upper/lower bound in inner loop).
