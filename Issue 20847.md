Okay, but we have a lot of references to your old name ... is your plan to change _all_ references, or ... ?  It's not a big deal but we try to credit everyone as appropriately as possible.  Cc:ing jdemeyer.

Well, I hadn't really thought about it, you know ;-) I guess my "plan" would be to use my new name from now on and leave my old name on already closed tickets.
