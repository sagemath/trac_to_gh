by adding some #random, because the answer (a path) depends on the behaviour of an iterator. Also making the hash doctest more robust.

This fixes the last 5 failing doctests in this file.

I am not sure the outputs are really random because the algorithm goes through the vertices in width first and neighbouring vertices are labeled always in the same way. 

Mathematically the `# random` is justified thus LGTM

The random is required because python3 gives other (valid) mutation sequences.

ok, good enough for me. Please set to positive if you agree. The patchbot is green.
