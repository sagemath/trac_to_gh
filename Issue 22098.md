CC:  @jdemeyer

once the last calls to cmp() in pyx files will be removed, the next failure will be this one:

```
[sagelib-7.6.beta3] sage/geometry/triangulation/triangulations.cc: In function 'triangulations* init_triangulations(int, int, int, bool, PyObject*, PyObject*)':
[sagelib-7.6.beta3] sage/geometry/triangulation/triangulations.cc:121:41: error: 'PyInt_AS_LONG' was not declared in this scope
```
I include a branch to allow others to reproduce:

```
export SAGE_PYTHON3=yes
make build
```

One problem is that `PyInt_AS_LONG` is often used in performance-critical code.

So whatever you do **be aware of performance regressions** in this ticket. Although it could very well be that such regressions are inevitable.

Probably in python3, the result will stil be (2, 3, 4, 5).

Volker or Jeroen, any suggestion on how to have doctests working both in py2 and py3 ?

Casting these integers to Integer ? I would prefer not.

Or just use apply "str" to display the results without the trailing L ?
