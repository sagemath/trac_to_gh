# Issue 29230: segfault in conversion between QQbar and polynomial ring over CyclotomicField

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29467

Original creator: @mwageringel

Original creation time: 2020-04-05 14:53:32

Keywords: qqbar


```
sage: a = QQbar((1/2*I + 1/2)*sqrt(2))
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(CyclotomicField(8))
sage: b = R(a)  # segmentation fault
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(no backtrace available)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
```


However, calling `simplify()` changes the internal representation and makes this example work:


```
sage: a = QQbar((1/2*I + 1/2)*sqrt(2))
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(CyclotomicField(8))
sage: a._descr
<sage.rings.qqbar.ANBinaryExpr object at 0x1d4a5a668>
sage: a.simplify()
sage: a._descr
a where a^4 + 1 = 0 and a in 0.7071067811865475? + 0.7071067811865475?*I
sage: R(a)
(zeta8)
```

Moving tickets to milestone sage-9.2 based on a review of last modification date, branch status, and severity.

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.
