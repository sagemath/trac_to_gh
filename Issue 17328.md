# Issue 17328: ugly LaTeX of unevaluated sums

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2014-12-30 10:11:57


```
sage: sum(binomial(2*n,k),k,1,n)
sum(binomial(2*n, k), k, 1, n)
sage: latex(_)
{\rm sum}\left({2 \, n \choose k}, k, 1, n\right)
```

This is because in `symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string()` `function_factory()` is called without latex name.
