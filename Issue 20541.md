No dashes in input description. I suggest the following:

```
        - ``certificate`` -- (default: ``False``) if ``True`` returns ``(True, F)``,
          where ``F`` is a flat and ``self.minor(contractions=F)`` has a
          `U_{2,k}` restriction; or ``(False, None)``.
```

After that minor change, I'm happy with this ticket and will give a positive review.

Merge conflict in src/sage/matroids/matroid.pxd, possibly #21251

I'm not seeing this conflict; perhaps we need to wait until 7.4.beta2?

The apparent conflict was with #20689. There was no real conflict, but the modified lines were right next to each other. I think I've resolved it.

LGTM.

Do I need to be concerned that a patchbot says that the build failed?


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2017-06-05 20:35:44

If you look at the patchbot log, you will see that the error is unrelated:

```
Error installing package gf2x-1.1.p1
```
