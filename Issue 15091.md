```
sage: cartesian_product([[1,2], [3,4]])
The cartesian product of ({1, 2}, {3, 4})
sage: list(_)
[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)]

Its implemented in M2 http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/doc/Macaulay2-1.8.2/share/doc/Macaulay2/ToricVectorBundles/html/

This implementation is a good deal faster, in fact I wrote it because M2 was too slow.

I don't know of a better reference than Klyachko. Really its obvious, an equivariant bundle is determined by how the (finitely many, in the case of a toric variety) orbits fit together. The rest is just technical bookkeeping, and Klyachko writes down the details if you care for them.
