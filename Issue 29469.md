Quite possible on both of these. If you have time to test and make these fixes, that would be great!

I don't understand it either, I only it moved it there from its origin.  It's quite likely that it is outdated - this should be addressed on a separate ticket.

Replying to [comment:18 gh-kliem]:
> How come `numerical`, `rings` etc. weren't touched?
The present ticket only touches top-level packages that do not have `OptionalExtension`s. 
Part 2 will do `OptionalExtension`s. Part 3 all remaining (mixed) ones. I split it up to reduce the potential for merge conflicts.

As far as I can see `OptionalExtension` is used only in `graphs`, `interfaces`, `libs` and `matrix`.

`Numerical`, `rings`, `finite_rings`, `number_field`, `padics` and `polynomial` don't seem to have that.

Maybe I'm missing something. We can also split at this point, because we are already touching enough packages.

It's quite possible that I misremembered and it's just an arbitrary subset.

Works for me.
