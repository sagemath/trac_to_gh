The `IML` package should be better wrapped up, for instance in `sage/libs/IML`. The `cdef` are hidden in `sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx`.

The problem is that `IML` somehow conflicts with linbox (which also includes `IML`).

For instance, adding : 

```cdef extern from "linbox/solutions/solve.h" namespace "LinBox":
     pass```

on top of `sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx` prevents it from compiling.

What is the point of this:

```
cdef long iml_nullspaceMP(long n, long m, const mpz_t *A, mpz_t * *mp_N_pass):
    return nullspaceMP(n, m, A, mp_N_pass)

cdef iml_nonsingSolvLlhsMM(SOLU_POS solupos, long n, long m, mpz_t *mp_A, mpz_t *mp_B, mpz_t mp_N, mpz_t mp_D):
    nonsingSolvLlhsMM(solupos, n, m, mp_A, mp_B, mp_N, mp_D)
```

Why not just call the IML functions directly?

If it's related to the problem in the ticket description, I'd rather try to fix that problem or at least understand why it does not work.

In code like

```
cdef enum SOLU_POS:
        LeftSolu = 101
        RightSolu = 102
```

it's better to not put the values (101 and 102) since this confuses people to think that Cython actually uses those values (it just ignores them). Also: use 4 spaces of indentation.
