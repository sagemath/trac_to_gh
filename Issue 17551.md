In `matrix_integer_dense.pyx` there is a use of `PY_NEW` that should be replaced with `__new__`. Otherwise looks good.

No, due to the hacking with `tp_new`, for `Integer`, `PY_NEW(Integer)` is not the same as `Integer.__new__(Integer)`.

In any case, let's leave fixing `PY_NEW(Integer)` for a different ticket.
