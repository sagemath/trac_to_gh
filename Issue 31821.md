Can you say why `"Permutation"` needs quotes but not `Composition`?

Some changes I would consider (unless they slow things down):

```diff
-        return [i + 1 for i in range(len(self)) if i + 1 == self[i]]
+        return [i for i, v in enumerate(self, start=1) if i == v]
```

```diff
-        return {i + 1: self[i] for i in range(len(self))}
+        return dict(enumerate(self, start=1))
```
But feel free to ignore as this leaves the ticket's scope.

Your changes in passing from the previous loops
are a clear improvement.
