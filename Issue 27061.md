I am not sure that the test of `x.parent() == parent` belongs in the `__init__`. In particular, the coercion framework should make it so that such an element is never constructed (unless the code itself is doing something bad by calling `P.element_class(P, elt)` where `elt in P`). So I think we should remove that case entirely.
