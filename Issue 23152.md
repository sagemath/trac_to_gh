the hyperlink to `default_sdp_solver()` is not available in [semidefinite program](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/numerical/sage/numerical/sdp.html?highlight=default_sdp_solver) because the file `generic_sdp_backend.pyx` is not shown. notice that the generic backend for [MILP is included in the html reference](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/numerical/index.html). i suggest that we also include the one for SDP.

I think there should be an empty line after

```
+        .. MATH::
```

the html doc displays fine even without the empty line between the directive and the equation, but let's add it to be consistent with most other places.
