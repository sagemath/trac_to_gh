Since !SCons is too stupid to figure out by itself how to compile Fortran code (#13985), we should set environment variables in `sage-env`, similar to how we do for `CC` and `CXX`.

I don't know either whether it works, I could remove it if you prefer.

Does `CPP` meanwhile get a default value?

Just asking because you also removed

```
# letting at least CPP have a default value ('cpp') probably makes sense.
```

from `sage-env`.

Just to `cpp` in case it's not already set, for use in our "own" scripts (that don't have/use `configure`), just like `CC`, `CXX`, but also `AR` etc., i.e., for convenience (and consistency).

But `$CPP` is not so clear, as `configure` uses `$CC -E` by default.
