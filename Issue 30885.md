# Issue 30885: Sage cannot evaluate this improper integral

I am trying to get this result from Wolfram Alpha:

This is what I've tried using [SageMath](SageMath) version 9.3beta4:



```
x, y = var('x y')

f(x, y) = 2 * y * exp(-x^3)

# method 1
f(x, y).integrate(x, y, oo).integrate(y, 0, oo)

# method 2
f(x, y).integrate(x, y, oo, algorithm='giac').integrate(y, 0, oo, algorithm='giac')

# method 3
f(x, y).integrate(x, y, oo, algorithm='sympy').integrate(y, 0, oo, algorithm='sympy')
```


The first method throws a runtime exception and asks for assumptions about y. The second method and third method returns an unevaluated integral.

Is there some arguments I need to pass to `integrate()` to get the expected answer?

try in the other order, first y, then x

Moving this ticket to 9.4, as it seems unlikely that it will be merged in 9.3, which is in the release candidate stage
