Dear me. I opened https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/issues/437 because gentoo made a newer flask-babel stable. But then I have stuck sagenb with a dependency to an older version of flask.
After updating flask and getting click I still get the stuff I posted in the github issue however. Plus I now have a deprecation warning that in `sagenb/notebook/conf.py` at line 13 `flask.ext.babel` should be changed to `flask_babel`.
