Keywords: finite_state_machine

For a non-deterministic automaton, just merging states which are 
indistinguishable for any suffix does not give a minimal non-deterministic 
automaton in every case (see e.g. http://cs.stackexchange.com/a/12712 ). 
This would be done by Moore's algorithm and only gives a smaller automaton. 
To obtain an equivalent minimal deterministic automaton, we use Brzozowski's 
algorithm, which first computes a determinisation of the non-deterministic 
automaton.
