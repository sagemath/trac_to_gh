```
sage: from sage.rings.asymptotic.growth_group import MonomialGrowthGroup
sage: R = QQ.extension(x^2+1, 'i')
sage: P = MonomialGrowthGroup(R, 'w')
sage: L = MonomialGrowthGroup(ZZ, 'log(w)')
sage: cartesian_product([P, L])
```

results in

```
ValueError: The name "in" is not a valid Python identifier.
