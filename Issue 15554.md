Are you sure that `LC_ALL=POSIX` is as portable as `LC_ALL=C`? In theory, they are supposed to be equal, but the latter seems to be more commonly used (therefore, probably a larger chance to be supported on various systems).

I changed it to `LC_ALL=C` (and rebased to 6.2.beta0). If you agree, you can set the ticket to positive_review.
