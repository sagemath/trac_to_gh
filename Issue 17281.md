Keywords: polynomial coeffs coefficients

This ticket adds a `sparse` parameter to the `coefficients()` method of the `Polynomial` class, and deprecates the use of `coeffs()` in a manner inconsistent with `coefficients()`, keeping with the discussion at [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/IHirUHTWnuA](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/IHirUHTWnuA). See also trac #17438.

I'm still working on this; I wanted to push my commits for the time being. I'm pretty sure it only needs additional doctests, but if anyone wants to go ahead & look at the documentation & doctests of polynomial_element.pyx and polynomial_element_generic.py, it would be convenient for me to fix any problems with them tonight or tomorrow. :-)
