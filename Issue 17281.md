# Issue 17281: remove ambiguous incompatibility between coeffs() and coefficients()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17518

Original creator: john_perry

Original creation time: 2014-12-17 11:29:18

CC:  rws

Keywords: polynomial coeffs coefficients

This ticket adds a `sparse` parameter to the `coefficients()` method of the `Polynomial` class, and deprecates the use of `coeffs()` in a manner inconsistent with `coefficients()`, keeping with the discussion at [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/IHirUHTWnuA](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/IHirUHTWnuA). See also trac #17438.

I'm still working on this; I wanted to push my commits for the time being. I'm pretty sure it only needs additional doctests, but if anyone wants to go ahead & look at the documentation & doctests of polynomial_element.pyx and polynomial_element_generic.py, it would be convenient for me to fix any problems with them tonight or tomorrow. :-)

PS: Sorry about removing the CC: earlier. It's nothing personal; I'm just clumsy.

I've found all the doctests in need of modification that I can find, so, I think this is ready for review.

Looks fine, doesn't clash with #17438, and passes `make ptestlong`. Please adapt the Author: field.
