pytest is configured to only discover `*_test.py` files; but if one uses `sage -t` with file arguments, this will override it and lead to many errors:

It seems that there is no way to tell `pytest` to ignore non matching files from the argument list on throwing these error messages.

So, is there anything standing against just doing it like this?

Why does it find them for directory arguments?

How can we achieve one of these options?

The editable install is possible since #31377 and should just work. I'm not familiar enough with the "usual" sage build to be able to recommend a solution that works with it. In the end, you need to specify the sage install directory as part of the PYTHON_PATH so that pytest is able to find the compiled cython modules. Maybe `@`mkoeppe has an idea.

Passing an empty argument list, causes an error, as well:

Thinking about this again, I was wondering what is the desired behavior of the `-t <files>` argument?
The following seems reasonable to me:

- If `<files>` is a folder, then test all "testable" files in that folder. Here "testable" takes e.g. the file extension (py, rst) into account; and also the pre-defined filter for pytest (`_test.py` ending).
- If `<files>` is a path to a file (or a glob), then test exactly those files without taking the above "testable" criteria into account. One might argue that one should also intersect with "testable" but I guess its better to trust the user that he knows why he wants exactly these files to be tested.

This also seems to be the default behavior of `pytest` (i.e. run `pytest <files>` with either a folder or a fixed path). It also seems to be that sage-runtests is behaving exactly like this, so I don't know if the test discovery should really be changed.

According to this point of view, the reported error is not really a problem with the pytest test discovery but more so an issue with loading these files as modules. If the import would work, pytest would try to find pytest tests in these files, which don't exist, so it would simply not collect anything.

To you mean to replace relative import statements by absolute ones all over the source code? Would this solve the problem?

BTW: Did you note that the `pytest` call in `sage-runtests` is broken since 9.5.beta3 (see [this comment](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/yd4qumrBbm0/m/oHEyfKSJAQAJ) in the according release management thread):


```sage
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/sebastian/devel/sage/src/bin/sage-runtests", line 159, in <module>
    exit_code_pytest = pytest.main(pytest_options + args)
TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "Namespace") to list
```


Probably this is due to #32332.

What I think is going on: pytest is called by

```
exit_code_pytest = pytest.main(pytest_options + args.filenames)
```

where `args.filenames = ['my_script.sage']`. But pytest is skipping `my_script.sage` since it doesn't match patterns `*.py`, `*.txt` or `*.rst` (or something like that). That's the reason for the "ERROR: not found" in there, and the error code is 4 (pytest command line usage error).

I don't know what's a proper way to fix this. Maybe filter out the list of files in `args.filenames` so that only the files that pytest likes get through (not `*.sage`, anyway). Warning: when `args.filenames` is not empty but it becomes empty after filtering, the call to pytest must be skipped otherwise pytest just tests everything recursively, which is not what we want.

Sounds like we should make a script that replaces all relative import statements by an absolute one (all over the source tree). Are we sure that there are no such import statement being intentional (by whatever reason)?

No idea.

I only installed pytest because of this message at the end of testing: "Pytest is not installed, skip checking tests that rely on it." I've since learned that I shouldn't. Maybe it's better to remove this warning until this is fixed? AFAICT there are very few tests (if any) that require pytest.

Not sure how to approach fixing the error that pytesting `tests/cmdline.py` is not working.
What is happening here is the following:
- The `-t` argument overwrites pytests check that test files have to end on `_test.py` (this is expected behavior and is needed if you want to run pytests specified in a custom test file)
- Pytest is then searching for test methods in `cmdline.py` and finds `test_executable` as, by default, pytest will consider any function prefixed with test as a test.

Would it be okay to rename `test_executable` to say `run_executable` so that it is no longer discovered by pytest?

Yeah, there are quite a few but also not sooo super many (around 60 hits). One could also skip these methods, https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/skipping.html#skip.

I'm not a big fan of this. The longterm goal is to use pytest also for the doctests (replacing sages custom doctest runner) and for this doctests and pytests should be treated in the same way.

If skipping is done with the pytest decorators, we would somehow have to have a version of this decorator that becomes a no-op if pytest is not installed.

I think it's fine to rename them if they are only used by doctests in the same module.
Then we might argue that it was not really intended to be in the public interface and should have been named `_test...`.

If/when you work on it as part of #33546, the whole `sage-runtest` script will be replaced anyway.

My point is that running pytest on these files is not a problem in itself (as described in more detail above in comment:21). I agree however that it leads to problems, namely that some methods are discovered as tests although they are not proper pytests. But it's this latter issue that should be addressed.

In other words, running `pytest src/sage/tests/cmdline.py` with this ticket still leads to the same issue as described in the ticket description.

I've just realized that with the changes in this ticket it is now impossible to use `sage -t somefile` to test if `somefile` works correctly with pytest (if somefile is not ending on `_test.py`). Thus working and reviewing on tickets that go into the direction of #33546 (such as #33550) is made harder.

Thus, please make it at least possible to disable the added filename check.

In principle yes, but pytest needs to be invoked with all the sage env setup and the correct arguments (which will probably include the sage-env dependent `rootdir` argument to fix #33550).

As you see in the example shown in the ticket description, `./sage -t` continues to run pytest on the files named `*_test.py`, which contain pytest tests.

There are no pytest tests in any other files, so there is no need to run pytest on them. 
If/when you work on a ticket that changes that, as I said in comment:78, you adjust the test in that ticket.

Okay, since #33549 is now ready for review and we both seem to agree that this is the right approach, this ticket here is no longer needed.

Moreover, the approach taken in #33549 to fix pytest in conftest instead of sage-runtests has also the advantage that running `./sage -sh -c pytest` directly (as you advocate above) also works now.

I'm sorry. I don't really follow what's going on here, and I can't really follow your fast pace.

Is there an IRC channel or similar where these topics are discussed? I don't think this ticket format is good, besides it leaves a lot of useless circumstantial comments that later make it very difficult to understand what happened (let me mention that I also find unhelpful that commits are not squashed and rebased when the fixes change, I know this is a matter of taste and I know the perils of rebasing, but still...)

I guess the last proposal is ok, although I fail to see what's the problem with using the work already done by DC in scanning the files.

If I understood correctly, the goal is to replace the doctest runner by pytest. If so, wouldn't it make more sense to write a different version of `sage-runtests` which is guided by pytest instead of the DC, instead of having `sage-runtests` do two passes on the files, one guided by DC and one guided by pytest?

If, at some point, you want "pytest file.py" to run the pytest tests and also the sage doctests, then the current structure of `sage-runtests` seems not ok as the sage doctests would be run twice (once by the DC and then again by pytest).

It seems to me it makes much more sense to have two "drivers" for running tests. One driver is the current sage-runtests (using DC) and the other driver is a new one using pytest. With this split you can work on developing the pytest driver without breaking the current `sage -t`. When the new pytest driver is well tested and working, and it's a complete replacement for the current DC driver, then `sage -t` can be switched to the new driver. They can probably coexist for some time to ease the transition. Your current strategy seems to be at odds with this.

Some questions about pytest (since I'm not really familiar with it):
a. Is pytest expected to have a long life? I understand python has changed test frameworks in the past. Is there a reasonable certainty that this won't happen again (I'm not implying it will -- I'm just asking if you've made this risk analysis).
b. Is there a way that you can make "pytest ARGUMENTS" work, i.e. have some configuration for pytest so the correct sage environment, etc. is loaded? If you don't have a plan on how this is supposed to work, then replacing `sage -t` by `pytest` won't really work...
c. If not, could you implement a `sage -pytest` or something like that that will run pytest with the needed environment, arguments, etc.?

The present ticket is a bugfix ticket that removes an annoyance with the existing implementation. My goal is to get it in for the Sage 9.6 release.

Larger discussions of `sage -t` vs. `pytest` should best be taken to a ticket with a larger scope. 

Meta-ticket #28936 (Adopt mainstream Python testing/linting infrastructure: tox, pytest, ...) would be suitable.

You'll notice that my `sage/tests/cmdline.py` issue disappeared after applying this ticket [including the commits I missed earlier].

Intensive testing, installed and in source, in the last couple of days revealed many pitfalls and things to ponder. I need to do a write up.

> #33549 is a big change and will likely take a while to review.

Can we please return to a friendly and constructive discussion. Thanks! There is already enough war going on in the world, that I don't need another one in my freetime.

My points of criticism of this ticket are:
- It is not fixing the underlying issue with pytest, but it's hiding it.
- It removes the feature that you can have pytests in arbitrary python files and run `sage -t file.py` on it to run them. This is important as `sage -t` is supposed to be a thin wrapper around `pytest` (plus, of course, running the actual doctests) and `pytest file.py` behaves that way. We can of course discuss to change the role pytest should play in `sage -t` but that should be better done in a more relaxed environment without time pressure and should take into account the future plans to e.g. make pytest a standard package.
- It excludes all python files from the pytest discovery, although most of them don't have any issues.
- It currently excludes the problematic files only at the level of `sage -t` and not `pytest` (that is, all exclusions should be in conftest and not sage-runtests).
- With #33549 and #32975 there are proper fixes for the issues reported so far.
- I don't understand why there is time pressure to fix this now in an adhoc manner. The ticket has been open for almost a year and my comment:30 saying that most reported issues should be fixed with #32975 didn't get attention for almost two months. Moreover, it's a problem with an optional package so people can easily opt-out.

I like the idea.

pytest has been around for over 10 years and is widely used (e.g. in scipy).

>  b. Is there a way that you can make "pytest ARGUMENTS" work, i.e. have some configuration for pytest so the correct sage environment, etc. is loaded? If you don't have a plan on how this is supposed to work, then replacing `sage -t` by `pytest` won't really work...

Running `pytest` already works in principle. Currently the only problem is that some modules still need an initalized sage-env (e.g. environment variables) instead of using the one provided by sage-conf. But there is work in this direction, mainly driven by the needs for the modulaization effort.

>  c. If not, could you implement a `sage -pytest` or something like that that will run pytest with the needed environment, arguments, etc.?

Yes, one could implement something like this. Say, 

- `sage -t` uses the current doctest driver for sage doctests and pytest for actual pytests.
- `sage -pytest` (or maybe directly `pytest`) uses pytest for both.

I think that could be good design indeed. But as Mathias says, maybe its better to discuss this somewhere else.

I think the problem in this test is actually your nonstandard setup in which `conftest.py` is not found. 

This is #33521 (doctesting with pytest fails on system install of sage), see in particular #33521#comment:8

No, this was never the stated design goal. The motivation for having `sage -t` invoke `pytest`, implemented in #31103, is that the test coverage of running `sage -t` is not reduced by migrating tests to pytest.

A "thin wrapper around pytest" would have pytest's actual interface (passing command line options etc.) and could be `sage -pytest` as suggested in comment:94 or `sage -tox -e pytest`.

> - It excludes all python files from the pytest discovery, although most of them don't have any issues.

That's how #31103 should have originally implemented it.

> - It currently excludes the problematic files only at the level of `sage -t` and not `pytest` (that is, all exclusions should be in conftest and not sage-runtests).

Answered in comment:73

#33549 is now a dependency of the present ticket.

There's still more to be addressed in #33550, #33560, and #33561 in order to fix everything that is fixed by the present ticket.

I've seen that the discussion was about strategy. But obviously the strategy was not clarified completely and thus the discussion was not finished at that point. By your comment [comment 109](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31924#comment:109) and the new ticket #33572 the situation is improved, now.

The difficulty with this ticket is that it shades out a couple of issues Tobias is currently working on. I can understand that this was annoying. For example the bug treated in #33550 will not show any more in the way as it did before if this ticket is released.

Thus, we should work throughout all of these issues and find new test cases for them, now. Probably, the best way to do this is to use #33572.

May I suggest adding some switches to `sage-runtests`:
- `--skip-doctest`: if given, the `DocTestController` run would be skipped
- `--skip-pytest`: if given, the pytest run would be skipped

And maybe:
- `--pytest-all`: if given, the filename filter implemented in this ticket would not be applied, so pytest would be run for all the given arguments

I think it would be quite useful (a) if I happen to have pytest installed and for some reason (maybe something is broken, perhaps because a bug in my system pytest, whatever) I prefer to skip pytest (b) if I want to actually test pytest (maybe I'm working on the pytest code) I may want to run pytest on different arguments without having to wait for doctest (c) want to run pytest on some file not matching the pattern.

All of these are easy to acomplish by trivial patching of `sage-runtests` but it's much more convenient to be able to get these different behaviours with an unchanged script.
