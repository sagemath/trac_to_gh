# Issue 31911: change '__len__' method of propositional formula to 'length'

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32148

Original creator: @DaveWitteMorris

Original creation time: 2021-07-07 01:36:54

Keywords: boolean formula, len, length

#28053 added a `__len__` method to propositional formulas, so that `len(f)` would return the length of the formula. However, it was pointed out in #29738 that only containers should have a `len`. So the method should be renamed to `length`.

```
sage: f = propcalc.formula("a -> b")
sage: f.length()
3
```

`__len__` will temporarily remain available, but deprecated.

I am fine with everything except deprecating this as a `__len__`. I think we should take a more incremental approach here and just add the alias, but leave it to #29738 once more concrete decisions have been reached before deprecating this behavior.

Thanks for looking at this.  I'm sure this feature is rarely used, so postponing the deprecation is fine with me.
