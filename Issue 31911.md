#28053 added a `__len__` method to propositional formulas, so that `len(f)` would return the length of the formula. However, it was pointed out in #29738 that only containers should have a `len`. So the method should be renamed to `length`.

```
sage: f = propcalc.formula("a -> b")
sage: f.length()
3
```

`__len__` will temporarily remain available, but deprecated.

I am fine with everything except deprecating this as a `__len__`. I think we should take a more incremental approach here and just add the alias, but leave it to #29738 once more concrete decisions have been reached before deprecating this behavior.
