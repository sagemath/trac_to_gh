Part of #32191 (Meta-ticket: Audit/fix all uses of `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` in `sage.combinat`, `sage.graphs`).

We update the following methods in `graph.py`:
- `chromatic_number`
- `coloring`
- `chromatic_index`
- `two_factor_petersen`

and the following methods in `graph_coloring.pyx`
- `vertex_coloring`
- `edge_coloring`
