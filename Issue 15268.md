Keywords: braid groups

Braid Groups are constructed over a finitely presented group, but not all relations are present:


```
sage: B=BraidGroup('a,b,c')
sage: B
Braid group on 4 strands
sage: B.relations()
(a*b*a*b^-1*a^-1*b^-1,)

```

The if statement is always true since `range(a, b)` is `[a, a+1, ..., b-2, b-1]` (or you can think of it as the integer points in th internal `[a, b)`). So I think this should work:

```python

    rels.append(free_group([i, i+1, i, -i-1, -i, -i-1]))
    for j in range(i+2, n+1):
        rels.append(free_group([i, j, -i, -j]))
