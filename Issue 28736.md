# Issue 28736: Automorphism Fields: Notation of Inverse

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28973

Original creator: @DeRhamSource

Original creation time: 2020-01-09 12:18:29

CC:  egourgoulhon tscrim

Keywords: automorphisms

At this stage we have the following problem with the notation of inverses:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: aib = M.automorphism_field([[0, 2], [-1, 0]], name='a^(-1)*b')
sage: c = aib.inverse(); c
Field of tangent-space automorphisms a^(-1)*b^(-1) on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```


That is definitely misleading. In this ticket it gets fixed by adding brackets around the element before taking its inverse.

Thanks for taking care of this! However, for simple names like `a`, having `(a)^(-1)` for the inverse is not desirable. One should maintain `a^(-1)` in this case. To cover all cases, you should use something like `is_atomic()` (defined in `src/sage/tensor/modules/format_utilities.py`); see the handling of names in `FreeModuleAltForm.wedge()`. More precisely, you should define, in `format_utilities.py`, a new function similar to `is_atomic` and adapted to the inverse naming.

You're right. That's definitely preferrable.

This was the fastest solution I had in mind so far. I see what I can do.

Thanks for the useful enhancement of the function `is_atomic()`.

The patchbot complains about the change introduced in the commit of comment:10 

```

Could you revert this change?

There is also a doctest error reported by one of the patchbots:

As you can see from the latest patchbot report, `<>` still causes some trouble:

```
-Python3 incompatible code inserted on 0 non-empty lines
+inside file:  b/src/sage/tensor/modules/format_utilities.py
+@@ -52,16 +55,31 @@ def is_atomic(expression):
++        sage: is_atomic(r"a<>b", sep=[r'<>'])
++        sage: is_atomic(r"(a<>b)", sep=[r'<>'])
+Python3 incompatible code inserted on 2 non-empty lines
```

Apparently, the operator `<>` has been removed in Python 3: it does not appear in the list
https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html.
So please remove this doctest.

I see. Well, this is on the symbolic level, so no actual Python code is involved here. Even though another operator as example would be certainly more convenient.

Perhaps this is a good example because the separator consists of more than one letter.

Thanks for the change. 
The patchbot is now full green ==> good to go.
