- Extend the method `generating_function_of_integral_points` by an `algorithm` keyword.
- For polytopes implement a naive algorithm that just collects the monomials corresponding to `integral_points`.
- Access the corresponding algorithm of `LattE`.

Isn't it a duplicate of #22109?

Moving some tickets to 9.2. This is not a promise that I will be working on them.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
