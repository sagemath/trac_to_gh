Adding hooks for distributors is not a good direction for development.  It's better to sort out in sagelib itself which scripts should be considered part of sagelib, and which ones are provided by sage-the-distribution instead.

Here are some thoughts:

Perhaps could just be deleted:
- `sage-cython`: #29923
- `sage-native-execute`: look at the script and see #9386. 
- `sage-open`: I wonder if the comment in that script is still valid; perhaps it can be deleted, or done purely in Python in sage/misc/viewer.py, the only place it's used. Maybe I'll look into this.
- `sage-pypkg-location`: apparently unused
- `sage-unzip` is in the listed, but the script itself is gone, isn't it?


Doctesting-related scripts. Where do these go?
- sage-runtests
- coverage scripts
- sage-fix-doctests
- sage-startuptime

In the libexec group:
- sage-cleaner?

Only relevant for sage-the-distribution:
- `sage-download`
- `sage-clone-source`
- `sage-sdist`
- `sage-location`
