CC:  tscrim slabbe chapoton nthiery

We change the attribute `_list` to actually store a `tuple` of the elements and switch methods such as `_iterator_from_list` to use the new `tuple` method instead of going through `list` (which makes a copy every time).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34400
