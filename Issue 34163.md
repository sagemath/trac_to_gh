We change the attribute `_list` to actually store a `tuple` of the elements and switch methods such as `_iterator_from_list` to use the new `tuple` method instead of going through `list` (which makes a copy every time).

Existing classes that define specialized `list` methods can (but don't have to be) changed to define `tuple` methods instead to avoid a tiny bit of copying overhead

Other than adding at least one doctest to the added methods, LGTM. This is a good idea.

Actually, you missed `def tuple(self):` in `finite_enumerated_sets.py`.

Indeed. I think my eyeballs need some rest

Thank you.

Trivial detail that you don't have to do, but `EXAMPLE::` -> `EXAMPLES::` to follow our general practice within Sage.
