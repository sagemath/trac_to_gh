Currently, most of the games within the catalogue of games for normal form are fixed instances of a single game. This ticket addresses this issue by adding several classes of games with generators similar to the graph generators. This allows for the generation of multiple instances of the same class of game based on specified parameters.

The work currently done for this is at present just an implementation of random game yes? I have started working on that here: https://github.com/theref/sage-game-theory/blob/random-deg/src/sage/game_theory/normal_form_game.py#L2329 (I did not think that random games should be part of the catalog), note that I used a tuple to denote the size of the game as well as recursion to be able to force a degenerate or none degenerate game. I would suggest a modification of that to include a zero sum check).

The other random games and whether or not they should be in the catalog is probably worth discussing.

I also am not sure what you mean by 'multiple instances of the same class of game based on specified parameters'. This is something that the current setup can accomplish.

Currently we've got 3 different classes of games; random; covariant; and unit vector games. Yeah that method does work out quite well especially for games with multiple players.

OK.

I was mainly trying to address generating games without the payoff entries of the game being passed as a parameters to the generator instead other parameters such as the size of the game or covariance etc. are passed into the generator.
