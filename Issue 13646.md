# Issue 13646: PolynomialSequence.solve()

Polynomial sequences over GF(2) should have a solve method which supports solving via

 * Gr√∂bner bases (PolyBoRi)
 * SAT solving (CryptoMiniSat and friends)
 * exhaustive search (FES library)
 * (Mixed Integer Programming) (!Sage's MIP stuff and !SCIP)

All these interfaces exist, they only need to be properly exposed.

+1 !

I am submitting  a patch, but it is not ready for review. There is (at least) a problem with ``eliminate_linear_variables=True``, but it should work fine when this is false...

I welcome any comments ;)

Patch looks good, I haven't installed it yet though (gosh, those are a lot of dependencies!). We should have a solve() for generic polynomial sequences as well, not only for GF(2). I guess for GF(2!^e) we can offer at least two options: solve() via GB or solve via weil restriction and solving over GF(2).

I think that the piece of code that eliminates variables occurring linearly could part of the most general ``solve()`` (where only GB would be possible...). Then in the subclasses, there could be other possible algorithms, such as SAT, etc.

Very nice! But the optional arguments are not correct:


```
./sage -t --show-skipped multi_polynomial_sequence.py
```


i.e. the "needs" is incorrect.

Excellent:


```
./sage -t --show-skipped --optional=magma,sage,cryptominisat,fes ./src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py
...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```



```
./sage -t --show-skipped ./src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py
...
    1 cryptominisat test not run
    1 fes test not run
    1 magma test not run
    [181 tests, 4.56 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!

Hmmmm.... This ticket's message seems to say that LP solvers are made available through the `solve()` method, but it does not seem to appear in the doc, nor in the code `O_o`

Oh. That settles it `:-D`

I fixed the problem. Somehow importing BooleanPolynomialRing at the top level is no longer possible. I have no clue why

Its pretty clear that BooleanPolynomialRing imports multi_polynomial_sequence, so if multi_polynomial_sequence also imports BooleanPolynomialRing then you have a circular import.

Comment by Bouillaguet created at 2013-12-20 13:26:34

Alright, but this used to be working (otherwise I suspect that malb wouldn't have given the positive review). Thus, I understand that BooleanPolynomialRing imported multi_polynomial_sequence somewhere between 5.13 and 6.1
