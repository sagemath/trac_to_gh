Polynomial sequences over GF(2) should have a solve method which supports solving via

* Gr√∂bner bases (PolyBoRi)
* SAT solving (CryptoMiniSat and friends)
* exhaustive search (FES library)
* (Mixed Integer Programming) (!Sage's MIP stuff and !SCIP)

All these interfaces exist, they only need to be properly exposed.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13850

I am submitting  a patch, but it is not ready for review. There is (at least) a problem with ``eliminate_linear_variables=True``, but it should work fine when this is false...

I welcome any comments ;)

Very nice! But the optional arguments are not correct:


```
./sage -t --show-skipped multi_polynomial_sequence.py
```


i.e. the "needs" is incorrect.
