This attempts to consolidate the existing code for the Lazy Formal Power Series and disentangle it from the unrelated code in the combinatorial species module. The ticket is a continuation to #16107 and #15673, which were the initial implementations of the same. The Lazy Formal Power Series should also be code that also supports multivariate series and puiseux series. The main tasks are -

* To create the Lazy Formal Power Series in a separate module which only contains codes for that module. It can contain and share code from sage.rings.
* In the first iteration, the Puisuex series code added should support exponents that are non-negative integers.
* To redefine any formal series in the form sum_{k=0}{\infty} a_n x<sup>n</sup>, where for multivariate series, a_n is a homogenous polynomial of order n.
* To handle Cycle Indicator Series(formal power series whose coefficients are symmetric functions) and their specific functionalities.
* To be able to define a Formal Power Series via a set of Functional Equations(Important).
    * The ability to define this implicitly.
    * And the ability to pass initial conditions to the `define` function.
    * Fix #14685, which is an error in the calculation of the approximate order of the series.
* Close all the related issues in #16107 and #15673.
* Fix the documentation of the existing code.
