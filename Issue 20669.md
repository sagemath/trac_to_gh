comb. free modules do not have ranks as synonym method of dimension

let us add the alias

motivation: this fails

```
sage: V3=CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ,['a','b','c'])
sage: T=End(V3)
sage: from sage.modules.matrix_morphism import MatrixMorphism
sage: MatrixMorphism(T,matrix(QQ,[[1,2,3],[2,3,4],[3,4,5]]))
```

Thanks. Sadly, that does not solve all the problems in my code snippet. The matrix morphism is now defined, but useless. Cannot be powered, or made acting on a vector.

I think that has more to do with the fact that CFM's and Sage's free module code is still mostly separate. However, this is progress in fusing their API's.
