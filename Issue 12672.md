# Issue 12672: Update documentation in sage/plot/plot3d/shapes2.py and shapes.pyx

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: mjo

Assignee: mvngu

Continued from #12620, there are still issues with the documentation of shapes.pyx and shapes2.py. Some examples:

 * Many functions take a `color` argument with the description,

   {{{
   -  ``color`` - a word that describes a color`
   }}}

 which is inaccurate.

 * The `A square black box:` example in `Box` is not black.

 * Some doctests are misformatted, e.g.

   {{{
   EXAMPLES:
        sage: from sage.plot.plot3d.shapes import Box
   }}}

 * `Torus` is missing a docstring:

   {{{
   cdef class Torus(ParametricSurface):
   # e.g  show(sum([Torus(1,.03,20,20, color=[1, float(t/30), 0]).rotate((1,1,1),t) for t in range(30)], Sphere(.3)))
   }}}

Here is a branch.

There remains only to be more precise about the `color` parameter.

Had to fix compilation at some points. Also "i.e." (id est) demands comma after it.
