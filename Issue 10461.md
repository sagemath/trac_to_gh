Assignee: jason, was

CC:  kcrisman

This gives a legend:


```
plot(x,legend_label='test')+plot(x^2,legend_label='test')
```


but this doesn't:


```
plot([x,x^2], legend_label='test')
```


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10514

I'm adding a doctest for people to *see* this as well in the live documentation.  

Why the extra blank lines?

Also, note that even this didn't work before.

```
sage: q1 = plot([sin(x)], legend_label='trig'); q1
```

which I assume why you did the test you did.

Reviewer patch coming up.
