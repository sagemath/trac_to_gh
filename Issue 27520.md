For some of these tests, ordering is random with Python 3: repeated runs produce different results. As now noted in the file, two doctests in `additive_magmas.py` don't actually test the relevant methods, but I don't know enough about the code to find good tests. For the changes in `map.pyx`, after evaluating something like `[x**2 for x in range(10)]`, in Python 2 `x` will be defined as 9, while in Python 3 it won't be defined, or if it was defined before, it retains its previous definition. So we don't need `del x` in Python 3.
