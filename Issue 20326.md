# Issue 20326: Cannot compile software (e.g. SnapPy) for sage because sage's gcc is incompatible with system's as

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20563

Original creator: mgoerner

Sage comes with its own gcc but uses the system's assembler as. If the versions of gcc and the gnu assembler are two different, compilation fails with bizarre errors such as: 
       Error: no such instruction: `vfmadd312sd offset(%rip),%xmm0,%xmm3'

For example, installing SnapPy (following the instructions from its website) fails on Mac OS X 10.9 with the latest version of Xcode compatible with 10.9 for every version of Sage later than 6.7. I have encountered this problem many times for, literally, years and on both, Sage and Linux.

I think that if sage continues to ship with its own gcc, it should include its own gnu assembler as well.
We might even consider including our own linker ld to avoid Mac OS X users to install xcode.

Patch to binutils-2.24 to make it compile with gcc-4.9.3.p1

Comment by mgoerner created at 2016-05-05 20:29:12

The GNU assembler (gas) is part of the GNU binutils. gcc and gas (the GNU assembler) can be built together at the same time by adding softlinks to binutil's bfd, opcodes, and gas directory to gcc's src directory and compiling gcc, see https://gcc.gnu.org/install/download.html.

I gave this a try by adding a few lines to gcc/spkg-install. sage's gcc is fairly old, so I ran into some problems with binutils version 2.25 and later. But I got binutils-2.24 to work (with some mild patching necessary due to stricter compiler flags) on Linux.

I'm inclined to say that this is a snappy bug, since it most likely passes options to GCC which are not supported. Do you have a complete log of the failed snappy build?

No, snappy doesn't specify any additional gcc flags for the compilation step that fails, see the log I just uploaded. 

If I understand things correctly, the issue is that because gcc was built against 10.11's "as" command, it generates asm codes that are incompatible with the older version of "as" that ships with, for example, 10.9.

Does snappy have inline assembly? Since snappy is the only package with this problem that I know of, there must be at least something snappy-specific about this issue.

No, it doesn't.  Moreover, while very small binary Python modules will compile and function, anything too complicated gives in similar errors, for example see the logs of trying to build pandas and chomp that I will upload in a second.  

This is a problem only with the binary distribution of [SageMath](SageMath) --- if you compile Sage direct from source on 10.9 (or even 10.8), then the resulting Sage will compile snappy, chomp, and pandas without any issue.

My guess is that the trigger is that the code is such that gcc decides to optimize by issuing certain SSE instructions/operands.  Which SSE instructions/operands it generates depends on what version of "as" was present when gcc was compiled, not what version is present at run time.  The version of "as" on 10.11 knows more SSE stuff than the one on (say) 10.9, hence the issue.

Nathan and I actually verified it by looking at the results of "gcc SnapPy.c -S" when run under "sage -sh" which produces the intermittent assembly code.

My guess is that the configure script of gcc follows a certain pattern to search for "as" and, if it finds it, probes it for its capabilities. If gcc is then compiled, the assembly produced by that gcc depends on the "as" found during configure time.

This problem can be avoided if sage compiled its own "as" and its binary distribution ships with it.

There are two ways of doing this: 
1. Making an own sage package for binutils (which contain as) and make the gcc sage package depend on it.
2. Making the gcc sage package obtain the binutils source code and symlinking parts of it (see comment 1) into gcc's src directory.

I think 1. has the danger that we need to make sure gcc's configure really picks up the "as" we compiled and doesn't fallback on the system's as. This might require extra parameters.
And for 2., I don't know whether the sage package framework is flexible enough to download/cache the source code from two different tarballs.

'''Which approach should we take?

----

In detail:
The "offending instruction" is a movq instruction where an operand is an SSE register xmm0, ... 
When using the sage binary distribution, the result of the above gcc command contains the offending instruction.
When Nathan compiled sage (and thus its gcc) himself on Mac OS 10.9, the result of the same command does not contain the offending instruction (though it still contained other instructions with SSE registers).
"as" on 10.11 accepts the "offending instruction" but on 10.9 it does not (supporting of the "offending instruction" starting binutils version 2.17 https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=43215#c7).

Using binaries compiled for OS X 10.11 on OS X 10.9 is not supported anyway. So, for me, this is still a "wontfix"-issue.

I suggest that you write to sage-devel about this, explain the problem and the proposed solution.

As of Sage 6.10, the only OS X binaries I see posted at http://files.sagemath.org/osx/intel/old/index.html are compiled on OS X 10.11.  Are you saying that to use Sage 6.10 (or newer) on OS X version 10.9 or 10.10, the user is expected to compile from source?  Even now, OS X 10.11 is less than seven months old, and Sage 6.10 was released back in December.  I had assumed that since the 10.11 binaries worked on earlier versions of OS X (and they do, modulo the issue at hand), that they were intended for any reasonably recent version of OS X...

Not requiring xcode would be nice, though we might also depend on system headers (don't know).

Would it be sufficient to make binutils optional, and you just install it by hand if your system assembler is borked?

That's the problem: to actually compile C code, you need a lot more than just GCC. You need:
- header files like `stdio.h`
- standard libraries like `libc`
- an assembler
- a linker

all these are shipped with XCode but not with GCC. I don't know if it's even possible to use a complete GNU toolchain on OS X.

I think those come with the OS and don't require xcode.

> - an assembler

If you look at the binutils source code, it contains headers nominally indicating that it supports Mac's native Mach-O files, but the configure file explicitly disables building the GNU assembler for Mac OS X. I removed that and compiled a GNU assembler for Mac, but the compilation failed because gcc on Mac OS X is using some Mach-O feature that xcode's as supports but not GNU's as.
xcode's as is from cctools http://opensource.apple.com//source/cctools/ or llvm's own assembler (depending on your xcode version).

> - a linker

I think binutil's ld supports Mach-O even worse than binutil's as.

The llvm project is developing its own linker, so clang/llvm will hopefully be a complete cross-platform toolchain in a couple of years. There is also llvm-gcc, a gcc compiling to llvm's IR so that the rest of the llvm toolchain can be used.

I have my hopes that clang/llvm will hopefully one day replace the clunky GNU toolchain.

Which instructions GCC emits depends on how you configure it during the build `--build=...`, `--with-arch-32=...`, `--with-arch-64=...`) and of course which options you pass to it at runtime when compiling other things with it (`-march=...`, `-mFOO` or `-mno-FOO`).  In practice, usually only a subset of the instructions "allowed" by the latter is used unless you ask for higher optimization levels (`-O2`, `-O3`).

At runtime, GCC of course doesn't check whether _the assembler_ supports the instructions it emits.  (`-march=native` just checks what features _the CPU_ supports, partially influenced by the operating system or VM.)

The `vmovd` vs. `vmovq` is pretty different; we could easily patch Sage's GCC on MacOS X for older versions (i.e., ancient Apple assemblers), and/or configure GCC to use clang's assembler by default when available.

For instruction set extensions like SSE2 on 32-bit or AVX on 64-bit CPUs, it's up to a package to make sure they're supported (by the assembler and the CPU) before enabling them, and to disable them in case of misleadingly so-called "fat binary" builds (we use for binary distributions of Sage).  AFAIK, GMP and MPIR are the only packages which build real "fat" binaries (where different code is selected _at runtime_, based on the actual CPU).

TL;DR:  I think we don't have to ship binutils or `gas` as well.

Yep (from `gcc/configure.ac`):

```sh
    gcc_GAS_CHECK_FEATURE([interunit movq mnemonic],
      gcc_cv_as_ix86_interunit_movq,,,
      [.code64
       movq %mm0, %rax
       movq %rax, %xmm0])
    AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED(HAVE_AS_IX86_INTERUNIT_MOVQ,
      [`if test $gcc_cv_as_ix86_interunit_movq = yes; then echo 1; else echo 0; fi`],
      [Define if your assembler supports interunit movq mnemonic.])

```

Because the assembler (used when building GCC) on the buildbot is less broken, namely clang's / LLVM's instead of Apple's ancient GAS 1.38 fork.

Up to version 4.8 GCC still emitted the traditional, wrong instruction (`movd`; cf. the problem report above), while it was changed to the correct one (`movq`) in 4.9.

To stay compatible with "broken" (very old) assemblers, this has again been changed (also in 4.9) to depend on the assembler found/used _during the build of GCC_ (i.e., in its `configure` run, which in the case of Sage binary dists happens on the buildbot).

The relevant PR is [https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56656](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56656), [corresponding patch](https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2013-03/msg00789.html).

Note that in fact the brokenness of bdists on older MacOS X versions wasn't even triggered by upgrading Sage's GCC, but by upgrading the buildbot (to a more recent OS version and hence a newer version of XCode)... XD

----

So it's not really clear (from the current ticket _description_) whether this ticket is supposed to deal (only) with the specific `movd`/`movq` issue which may pop up _when compiling SnapPy_ (as the title says), or the more general problem with old Apple assemblers.

The latter will presumably be solved on #20779, thereby also fixing the more specific problem here (which could easily be solved in even more ways though).

This issue was first noticed with `SnapPy`, but, yes, it is really a general problem with old Apple assemblers: for example, it also occurs when compiling pandas or the chomp optional package.  The manifestation in #20779 is the more serious form, since you can't currently even build that version of NTL from source on 10.9.  This current ticket could also be dealt with by offering binary releases of Sage built on 10.8 or 10.9 machines.  (Such binaries are now posted for Sage 7.2 thanks to mgoerner, but I believe the only build-bot is running 10.11.)

And just for reference, I posted my last 10.7 binary for Sage 7.2 - that machine was taken back by my employer.  But I think there will still be limited, but nonzero, demand for binaries for 10.8 and 10.9.  See e.g. [the analogous situation when 10.10 was released](https://www.intego.com/mac-security-blog/os-x-market-share-statistics-1-in-5-macs-still-unsupported/).

I have one machine running 10.8, and some main-stream apps (Chrome, Spotify) have started warning me that they will no longer be updated on that platform.  But even that is a very recent phenomena --- 10.8 is only 4 years old, after all --- so I think there may be more demand for 10.8 and 10.9 that you might think, especially given the common feeling that OS X releases are going downhill...

Provided one updates XCode to the latest version _available for the specific MacOS_, with how many Xcode versions for MacOS X (10.6?) 10.{7,8,9}, 10.10, 10.11 do we have to deal?

While AFAIK Apple's old GAS assembler had not been changed/updated for years but simply been dropped at some point (XCode for 10.10+?), LLVM and clang are of course still under development, such that the versions Apple ships are a more or less moving target (presumably with a "final" version for each or a couple of older MacOS X releases).

For 10.8 - 10.12, I think you need Xcode 5 - 8, so there's almost as many versions of Xcode as versions of OS X.  However, since Sage builds it's own gcc on OS X, it's only dependent on a small portion of Xcode's toolchain.

Jeroen, is your binutils package still WIP?

I think it's worth in general to have an optional/experimental one.

(Why currently binutils 2.24?)

Is this still an issue after #12426 was closed as fixed on 2018-02-01,
and merged in Sage 8.2.beta5?

Are the Sage macOS binaries built with gcc or with clang nowadays?

Do they ship gcc or rely at runtime on the user's system clang?

No it is not.  In any event, even the original was only a problem on macOS < 10.11 which is quite old at this point.

clang

They only ship gfortran at this point.

That was unrelated, but regardless this ticket can safely closed.
