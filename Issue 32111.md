Keywords: Weil polynomials

Something seems to be off when I specify too many leading coefficients:

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.weil.weil_polynomials import WeilPolynomials as WP
sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
sage: list(WP(10,2,lead=[1,-3,5,-5,5]))
[x^10 - 3*x^9 + 5*x^8 - 5*x^7 + 5*x^6 - 5*x^5 + 10*x^4 - 20*x^3 + 40*x^2 - 48*x + 32,
 x^10 - 3*x^9 + 5*x^8 - 5*x^7 + 5*x^6 - 6*x^5 + 10*x^4 - 20*x^3 + 40*x^2 - 48*x + 32,
 x^10 - 3*x^9 + 5*x^8 - 5*x^7 + 5*x^6 - 7*x^5 + 10*x^4 - 20*x^3 + 40*x^2 - 48*x + 32]
sage: list(WP(10,2,lead=[1,-3,5,-5,5,-5]))

This turns out to be an easy fix, see attached. TL;DR: the integer that goes with a FLINT polynomial is the length (degree + 1), not the degree.
