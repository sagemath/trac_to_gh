Hello,

What was the rationale for this ticket? I have two objections to it

- In Sage we try to make any binary operation `op(x, y)` works independently of the values of `x` and `y` but only on their parents. This is the base of the whole coercion model. Having `pow(1, x)` works inconditionally is misleading (there are terrible counterexample to my assertion).

- More importantly, the test `my_qqbar_number == QQbar.one()` can be **very** costly. You are possibly forcing an exactification in `QQbar` just to allow a very useless corner case. On sage-7.5.1 we had

```
sage: s = sum(AA(i)**(1/i) for i in range(1,20))
sage: %timeit (s/s) ** 4
10000 loops, best of 3: 55 µs per loop
```
  but with your patch

```
sage: s = sum(AA(i)**(1/i) for i in range(1,20))
sage: (s/s) ** 4  # you can wait ...
```

Looking forward to your answer.

Vincent

Hello Vincent,

Replying to [comment:9 vdelecroix]:

`1^my_qqbar_number` is mathematically meaningful.

> - In Sage we try to make any binary operation `op(x, y)` works independently of the values of `x` and `y` but only on their parents. This is the base of the whole coercion model. Having `pow(1, x)` works inconditionally is misleading (there are terrible counterexample to my assertion).


I completely agree that the parent of the output should only be influenced by the parents of the inputs and not its particular values. And, after the patch of this ticket, pow of a QQbar element to a QQbar element is (still) always a QQbar element (unless it is not possible and an error is thrown).

FWIW, as it is implemented now, `pow` and coercions unfortunately do not play well together (only basic stuff, like if there is a direct coercion (i.e. no new parent has to be found), works)

Oh, indeed, this is a problem and need to be changed.

> just to allow a very useless corner case


I disagree with your "useless". As mentioned, `1` to some QQbar element is mathematically meaningful, and some people care about being able to calculate things.

What about checking if the element is "trivially" `1` (in the same spirit as the symbolic expression's `is_trivial_zero`)? Thus no exactification would be done, but `s=QQbar(1)` would still be recognized.

Would already be better...

```
from sage.rings.qqbar import ANRational

def is_trivially_one(x):
    descr = x._descr
    return isinstance(descr, ANRational) and descr._value.is_one()

Let me reformulate:

```
sage: s = sum(AA(i)**(1/i) for i in range(1,20))
sage: (s/s) ** 4
```
does not give a result within a couple of hours on a fresh 7.5. And I was wondering why?

And I was wondering why?\n\n\nI've tried to investigate this now: On all systems and Sage-versions (with and without this patch) I've tested it, this takes ages. I have no idea how it could be that fast on your system.

I've tried to investigate this now: On all systems and Sage-versions (with and without this patch) I've tested it, this takes ages. I have no idea how it could be that fast on your system. Can you maybe repeat the test or do you have any (other) guess what happens?

(The problem is, that the generic pow tests for idempotence `a**2 == a`, which is not possible for our example above.)

Why special case powers of 1 in `QQbar`? This makes no sense since we don't support `QQbar^QQbar` powering in general. I'd prefer to revert this in #5574 unless somebody gives me a good reason for why this ticket sense.

Actually, I created #24490 to revert this.
