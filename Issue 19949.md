In case nobody has done so, welcome to Sage.

There are a few things that will need to be done before this can be a part of Sage:

- You will need to create git branch of your changes and push it to the trac git server.
- All functions and methods (not just public) need doctests (and documentation if their functionality is not obvious). References would be welcomed.
- I think it would be good to have this was a method for graphs by using edges labeled by the probability.
- Your functions' documentation should have a short one sentence description (which is declarative, i.e., "Return", not "Returns"), then a blank line, then the more detailed description afterwards.

For general conventions and help, see: http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/index.html. Let me know if you have any questions.

You will also need to fill in your real name in the authors field.

Best,
Travis

I don't understand why this function does not take a weighted Sage graph as an input, but some matrix. E.g. it would be most natural apply it to the weighted adjacency matrix of a graph, e.g.

```
sage: h.add_edges([[0,1,1/2],[1,2,2/3]])
sage: h
Graph on 3 vertices
sage: h.weighted_adjacency_matrix()

[  0 1/2   0]
[1/2   0 2/3]
[  0 2/3   0]
```
