Dumb thing, but this change makes it overindented:

```
-            (max is None and self.get_aorder() >= min)):
-            return self
+             (max is None and self.get_aorder() >= min)):
+             return self
```

Once fixed and green bot (either before or after), you can set back to a positive review.
