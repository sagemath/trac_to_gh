# Issue 34550: streamline .set_order() methods for elliptic curves and points

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34787

Original creator: lorenz

Original creation time: 2022-11-25 06:43:02

Elliptic curves and points have `.set_order()` methods to supply the order to Sage's algorithms instead of computing it.

However, `.set_order()` for curves currently has a `num_checks=` keyword argument instead of the usual `check=` flag, and `.set_order()` for points does not have either argument and simply runs checks unconditionally.

In this patch we add `check=` arguments to both methods. Moreover, we make `.set_order()` work for points over general fields, where order-computation algorithms are not available at the moment.

What is the role of `*` in the following?

```
    def set_order(self, value, *, check=True, num_checks=8):   
```

```
            Q.set_order(n2, check=False)        # verifies n2*Q == 0   
```

By the change, the comment is wrong.

It marks all following arguments as keyword-only. I think enforcing that `check=` be passed as a keyword argument is a good idea: It makes a function call with a `check` argument much easier to understand than a boolean positional argument.

Replying to [comment:4 Kwankyu Lee]:
> {{{

> }}}

Good catch, fixed.

Thanks. I didn't know that idiom though there are 97 uses of that idiom in sage :)

LGTM.
