# Issue 4100: comparison with None extraordinarily slow

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: robertwb

Original creation time: 2008-09-11 06:04:35

Assignee: somebody

This is because the coercion model is invoked, and with types it actually tries to cast one direction or the other, raising errors.

Before


```
sage: timeit("1 == None")
625 loops, best of 3: 625 Âµs per loop
```


After


```
sage: timeit("1 == None")
625 loops, best of 3: 530 ns per loop
```


This is at least close to 


```
sage: timeit("1 is None")
625 loops, best of 3: 330 ns per loop
```


but people who don't know about the `is` operator shouldn't be hit that bad...

Review:  patch applies ok to 3.1.2 and all tests in sage/structure pass.  ok!

This patch causes a doctest failure in gen.pyx:

```

I think the doctest should change, I believe the purpose is to show that things don't go boom when you compare with None, not that an ordering is enforced.

I agree with Robert.  Let's change that doctest (or even remove it, since I don't think it serves any useful purpose!)

I fixed the doctest as indicated. If you want to change something or add a comment please post a patch. 

Cheers,
