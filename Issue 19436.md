Shouldn't the "branch inside sage-bdist" be changed to call this new `Makefile` instead?

sage-bdist will be deleted when the transition to the new binary packging is done, so no need to beautify it. It still would be nice to use the new mac app Makefile during the transition.

Still needs review...

Replying to [comment:5 vbraun]:

Let me know when this happens.

The new binary packaging is done, all OSX binaries use the Makefile that is introduced here.

I made a few small improvements and fixed two bugs.  I also took the liberty of rebasing onto the latest develop.  The two bugs fixed were that rebuilding the app portion would cause Sage.app to be copied inside the already existant Sage-VERSION.app.  The other was that rsync would rerun every time even though there was nothing to be copied.

Also, the rsync command copies the .git folder.  This doesn't seem desirable to me, but perhaps it was intended, so I put it as the last commit.  Thus if you want to push all but that commit you can.

I tried it out on Mac OS X 10.11.3 and it works like a charm.

The Makefile has (almost) not a single comment in it and at least I would find it helpful if it had comments about
- what it is basically for: it is producing a dmg containing the Sage App, to be called directly with make and after sage itself has already been build with make at the root
- the relocability of the resulting App (as far as I understand, the path where we compiled sage needs to be longer than the relocation target?)
- whether the binaries compiled previously by calling make at the root are suitable for distribution to older processors which might not have all the capabilities of the host machine
- maybe a line explaining the $(APP) target

I mostly agree with this. It's a `Makefile` which is basically hidden in `src/mac-app` with no clear interface. And the relation between `sage-bdist` and this `Makefile` should be made more clear.

I've added the documentation. Ivan's changes are good.

Resolution: fixed

I guess we should remove the following line from https://github.com/sagemath/binary-pkg/blob/master/sage.yaml now:

 cp ../../sage-osx-makefile {path}/src/mac-app/Makefile

For full reference ... that was done at [this commit](https://github.com/sagemath/binary-pkg/commit/4d827f34da028563e69b066bda5ffba91c937eaa).
