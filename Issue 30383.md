Since Three.js has recently gone completely modular, the `examples/js` folder is scheduled for deletion at the end of 2020. This creates problems for the files taken from there for use in SageMath, in particular `OrbitControls.js`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30620

Out of curiosity, do we know how we're going to handle this? As I understand, modules can't be loaded from the filesystem. So...

* just drop support for running it purely locally, i.e. online=False and outside Jupyter?
* spin up a simple server the first time a Three.js plot is shown per session for the sole purpose of serving the Three.js files? Would probably want to print a warning: "Hey! This plot won't work once you exit Sage!"
* maintain our own non-module fork of the example files? I don't really have any interest in trying to keep such a fork up-to-date, even for only one file; heaven forbid the core Three.js ever goes module-only.

After some thought, clearly the best way forward is just to build Three.js ourselves from the source code. I've already done that before when contributing a minor fix. That way we can include any features we need, either now or in the future. The only question is where to host the repository for transparency.

Please hold off on working on the upgrade to r120, since this way will save the extra work of modifying the current build process.

GitHub seems to be the direction Sage is headed. I think I saw a ticket about replacing patchbot with GitHub actions, for example, and there's already a bunch of repositories under [https://github.com/sagemath](https://github.com/sagemath). Maybe we can get a repository under there, too. If not, something under your profile?

The single file, plus the license, would indeed be the contents of the package.

You could also consider making it a Python source package (with setup.py) such that `setup.py build` builds that single file; and then publish both an sdist and a wheel to PyPI.

Joshua, I'm attaching a preliminary version of the minified build to this ticket so you can experiment with it. The build depends on features recently added to r121, so we'll wait for that release before updating things here. The build requires having Node/npm installed and goes like this:

* perform a shallow clone of the target branch with 

```
git clone --depth=1 --branch master --single-branch https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js.git
```

* add the following lines to `src/Three.js` after the other exports

```
export { OrbitControls } from '../examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js';
export { Line2 } from '../examples/jsm/lines/Line2.js';
export { LineGeometry } from '../examples/jsm/lines/LineGeometry.js';
export { LineMaterial } from '../examples/jsm/lines/LineMaterial.js';
export { LineSegments2 } from '../examples/jsm/lines/LineSegments2.js';
export { LineSegmentsGeometry } from '../examples/jsm/lines/LineSegmentsGeometry.js';
```

* `cd three.js`
* `npm install`
* `npm run build`

Matthias, since this requires non-Sage software and manual manipulation, I don't see how to automate it nicely. With the next upgrade we'll need to have a new `threejs-sage` repository in the SageMath organization, since we'll want the custom build to be available in online CDNs. How does one go about requesting this?

Attachment [three.min.js](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket30620/three.min.js) by @mkoeppe created at 2020-09-26 00:26:06

From the recipe - adding the 5 lines to `src/Three.js` - does this not just mean that you want to maintain a git branch with these lines added and merge in the new upstream releases when they become available?

The result of `npm run build` - is the idea to just publish it to npmjs.org (under a different name to indicate that it is a fork)?

This step doesn't publish anything: it builds the release files on the local machine.

Thanks Paul. I found that I had to run `npm run build-closure` in order to build `three.min.js` in addition to `three.js` and `three.module.js`. I also added a line to export `Line2`:


```
export { Line2 } from '../examples/jsm/lines/Line2.js';
```


I tested this with my fat-lines branch from #26410 and didn't run into any issues. I particularly like how I was able to simplify the `threejs_scripts` and `threejs_offline_scripts` methods due to everything being bundled into that one `three.min.js` file.

Yeah, I overlooked `Line2`, so I've edited the instructions above. The Closure compiler is already gone from `r121dev` so you're building against `r120`. Since you've got a build I'll remove my attachment. Bet your final build is twice what it should be, since that was only fixed in the current `dev` branch...

Yes, I think whenever source are modified, that should be tracked in a source repository.

I can create one for you in https://github.com/sagemath/ -- what should the repository be named?

If you are concerned about the size of the repository, we could create a shallow clone (omit the history of the upstream repository).

A shallow clone of the repository still ends up with a release of about 650 MB, since it includes all examples, documentation and auxiliary code. All the end user needs is a single 657 kB file. I'm not interested in shoveling excess data at users.

Here is an example of what I'm proposing, since I need it for my own use:

[https://github.com/paulmasson/threejs-with-controls](https://github.com/paulmasson/threejs-with-controls)

This release contains only what the user needs, along with the original license and instructions for performing the build. Anyone who doubts the integrity of the build can reproduce it and compare files.

I have some naive questions. 
- It seems that deployment is intended to be done via cdn.jsdelivr.net; do you intend to also provide local deployment for use in Sage?
- Since this is a js package, wouldn't people want to be able to install it with npm?

The CDN will only be used for graphics generated with `online=True` as is currently done. The zip file on the release page will become the upstream package that is equivalent to what is currently being distributed on Sage mirrors. This would of course still be included when building Sage and placed on the hard drive for local off-line access.

I for one only use Node when absolutely necessary, as it is in this build process, so I'm not terribly concerned with the npm ecosphere. The whole reason for building this vanilla JavaScript package is to relieve end users of having to deal with Node/npm. I don't see what would be gained by adding an option to install from npm when the zip file is already available on GitHub.

Joshua, the current build of `threejs-sage` contains the string `t.REVISION="122"` along with a string `revision:"122"`. Do these occur in your own custom builds on your machine? If so we can delete the `version` file on the next build.

Yes, both are present in the build I produced. I'm not sure if we should rely on that always being the case, though, since it's not been at least once so far. Not really an objection to removing `version`, but just thinking we may end up adding it back at some point :)
