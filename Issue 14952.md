# Issue 14952: LinearMatroid.is_field_isomorphic fails on some occasions

Issue created by migration from Trac.

ADD DESCRIPTION

The following code should return False:

```
sage: M = Matroid(ring=GF(5), reduced_matrix=[[1,0,3],[0,1,1],[1,1,0]])
sage: N = Matroid(ring=GF(5), reduced_matrix=[[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[1,1,0]])
sage: M.is_field_isomorphic(N)
True
```


Indeed:


```
sage: any(M.is_field_isomorphism(N, p) for p in Permutations(range(6)))
False
```


The cause is a recursive call gone wrong in set_system.pyx.

How do I review this? I can't seem to get the Branch thing working (when I click on it, I either need to browse through a file system too much to find the changes, or get a blank page).

By clicking on (Commits) in the Branch field, and selecting the appropriate diffs (topmost versus second from top) you can view my changes. 

Otherwise, I'm still learning this whole process. Apparently the Branch link being colored red is a bad thing (it was green when I first uploaded this)...

For the record, to create this patch I followed instructions here:

http://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/QuickStartSageGit

And then here:

Ok, I chickened out of the Git development process for now and uploaded a good, old-fashioned patch.

I was going to get round to the git stuff eventually... :)

All good now.

Really? It's just a one-line fix (plus doctest) in a quite isolated part of Sage...
