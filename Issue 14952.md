ADD DESCRIPTION

The following code should return False:

```
sage: M = Matroid(ring=GF(5), reduced_matrix=[[1,0,3],[0,1,1],[1,1,0]])
sage: N = Matroid(ring=GF(5), reduced_matrix=[[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[1,1,0]])
sage: M.is_field_isomorphic(N)
True
```


Indeed:


```
sage: any(M.is_field_isomorphism(N, p) for p in Permutations(range(6)))
False
```


The cause is a recursive call gone wrong in set_system.pyx.

By clicking on (Commits) in the Branch field, and selecting the appropriate diffs (topmost versus second from top) you can view my changes. 

Otherwise, I'm still learning this whole process. Apparently the Branch link being colored red is a bad thing (it was green when I first uploaded this)...

For the record, to create this patch I followed instructions here:
