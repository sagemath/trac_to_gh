# Issue 34309: Add the missing `autoconf` and `automake` requirements for archlinux

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34546

Original creator: MartinPepin

Original creation time: 2022-09-16 15:51:22

Keywords: archlinux,configure

In order to successfully build the `./configure` script on archlinux you need the `autoconf` (providing `aclocal`) and `automake` system packages.

It seems that the `build/pkgs/_prereq` sage package lists system requirements for a variety of distros so I'll add it there. Should it be documented / specified elsewhere as well?

It's not `_prereq`, it's `_bootstrap`.
