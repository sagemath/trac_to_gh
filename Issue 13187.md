`Expression::__nonzero__` calls `variables()` in case it needs assumptions:

```          
# If assumptions are involved, falsification is more complicated...
need_assumptions = False
vars = self.variables()
if len(vars) > 0:
   from sage.symbolic.assumptions import assumptions
   assumption_list = assumptions()
   if len(assumption_list) > 0:
      # do something
```

Now, `variables()` is a recursive call that walks down the expression tree, so you really only want to do this when necessary. The attached patch changes the order of the `if` statements. In my case that involves lots of expression manipulations, the running time came down from 2 minutes to 2 seconds.


Background: I'm doing calculations in a `LaurentSeriesRing` over `SR`.

Those are hacks I cannot submit to the tracker, but this is the next bottleneck.

It should also be possible to improve the performance for `variables` by calculating it at construction time from the variables of the subexpressions. I've done some work in that direction, but that's a different story.

As long as you're making a performance patch, you should change the statements like


```python
if len(assumptions_list) > 0:
```


to 


```python
if assumptions_list:
```


and similarly with the "if len(vars) > 0" line.

Good suggestion, here's a patch.

This is a minor point in the sense that it doesn't affect the algorithm's complexity, but you're right that it's probably cheaper.
