We define scalar multiplication of `IntegralLattice`.

```
sage: L
Lattice of degree 2 and rank 2 over Integer Ring
Basis matrix:
[1 0]
[0 1]
Inner product matrix:
[ 0 11]
[11  0]
sage: 2*L
Free module of degree 2 and rank 2 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[2 0]
[0 2]
```


Note that the result should be an integral lattice.
