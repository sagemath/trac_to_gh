Approximant bases, or sigma bases, or order bases, are in their original form relaxations of kernel bases of polynomial matrices which behave extremely nicely. They generalise Pad√© approximation and have many uses in their own right, and they also appear as an important step in many asymptotically fast algorithms that have been developed in recent years.

This ticket introduces an interface for very general notions of approximant bases, and gives a rudimentary algorithm for computing them using row reduction of polynomial matrices.
