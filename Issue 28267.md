ok, fixed. Back to needs review

By the way, conversion back from gap matrices seems not to work correctly.

```
sage: P = posets.TamariLattice(3)
sage: libgap(P)
<A poset on 5 points>
sage: A = libgap(QQ).PosetAlgebra(P)
sage: A.CoxeterMatrix().sage()
[[0, 0, 0, -1, -1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
 [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]]
sage: type(_)
<class 'list'>
```

But this would be for another ticket.

I agree, that should be another ticket. Although it just seems to be the transpose here. Or do you mean that gap matrices are just lists of lists, so it comes back as a list in Sage?

It also recognizes it for any square array:
