We do not need to create another copy of the augmented matrix to keep memory usage down (including putting it in a cache) and because it is faster.

This is a bit weird

```

+            del data[i,i]
+        data = {(r,c-nrows): data[r,c] for (r,c) in data}
```

You are modifying `data` and then override it. If you can not do the modification inplace, the following looks simpler

```
data = {(r,c-nrows): data[r,c] for (r,c) in data if c >= nrows}
```

Yes, it looks more simple, but it actually takes longer because it has to do the `if` check on every nonzero object. Whereas the version I have just removes objects from the `dict`. I suspect this is more of a micro improvement, but that could be a lot of extra checks for a really big sparse matrix (at least, I have a 62001 x 62001 sparse matrix with 1756951 non-zero entries).

Ideally I would like to modify the data in place and just update the indices, but hash tables are not good for doing that. One of these days, someone (me) should implement another data structure for sparse matrices...

Oh, I see.

Note that for matrices over ZZ or QQ, there is a custom C datatype which is an array of sparse vectors. This is not ideal but already faster than dictionaries in most contexts.
