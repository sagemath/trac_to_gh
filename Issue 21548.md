That would actually help me. I see extra potential to this for my jupyter kernel install woes as well (even if I know Jeroen doesn't see it that way).

There was a reference to this ticket in a "sage-packaging" discussion:

I would add, a lot of the stuff (not necessarily all) in `$SAGE_SRC/ext` might better belong directly in the `sage` Python package--in particular any files that are needed for the package itself to function properly.  For example you can see in #22626 that I put `sage.gaprc`, a file required for the libgap module to work, in `sage.libs.gap` as "package data".

There are several files in `$SAGE_SRC/ext` that there's no reason to ever allow to be out of sync with the Python package, and that could be given the same treatment.

For files in `$SAGE_SRC/ext` in general, that aren't explicitly required from the package (are there any such files) it might be better to move out of `src/` entirely?

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-01-13 16:37:58

setuptools experts: To move this ticket forward, should it go through #22655 (Support package_data-like of non-Python resource files in Python packages)?


---

Comment by embray created at 2020-01-14 11:08:46

Something like it, yes, though I think maybe it can be simplified.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-01-16 18:38:03

Erik, should discussion then take place on #22655 or here?

Description adapted from embray's comment 4.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-01-21 20:23:18

Branch is on top of #29062.

Installation of the package data does not work yet... what am I missing?

I haven't looked at this in detail yet, but I'm basically happy with what I see; this is what I've been wanting to see done all along.

Looks good but there are a few doctests errors on the patchbots and I think at least some of them are really related to this ticket

```

Looking at this file, there is no tests in it, which suggests it may not have been tested before and may be nothing in `ext_data` should.

This one is actually the exact same error but on another file

I have a felling the `.txt` in the `kenso` folder are not actually installed. At least they may not have been on the patchbot I have taken these logs from.

Yes, it looks like they are not getting installed. I'll investigate

I am trying to find if there was a reason it was named `nodotest.py` (specifically the `.py` part), this is an annoyance at install time, at least on sage-on-gentoo, for no good reason when examined closely.

Somewhat incidental, and doing it in another ticket would be fine. `src/sage/doctest/tests` is currently not installed because there is no `__init__.py` - at least on distros. But it contains a `nodoctest.py` which is tested for. So it should really be added to `package_data` as well.

Next, to make it work, the cleaner of stale files needs to be tamed:

OK I have somewhat asked on #14575 if there was any reason it was `nodoctest.py` - in particular the extension. I think we should have a separate ticket for this but the problem of `__pycache__` with `nodoctest` would be eliminated. Still leave us with `postprocess.py` but at least, that one is genuine.

New round of patchbot

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 286.7 src/sage/rings/function_field/function_field.py  # Timed out
sage -t --long --warn-long 286.7 src/sage/doctest/sources.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 286.7 src/sage_setup/clean.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

The time out is strange but was already there in the previous round so there may be something about it (but what?). The testing in `doctest/sources.py` is still present even so we don't test `postprocess.py` anymore so there is something more to do somewhere in there.
And lastly we have some stale files - not unexpectedly at this stage

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 286.7 src/sage_setup/clean.py

Real cool! Everything in the one ticket, the nodoctest stuff means that I can ditch packaging code I had to add because of QA complaints in Gentoo.

Which bit do you find strange? the stale file in `ext_data`? It looks like when you install stuff with distutils all python file are byte-compiled by default, including the ones in `package_data` (which I wasn't expecting but this is probably a blanket scan of what's installed).

I think this is ready for positive review.

Note that the byte-compiled file there is deleted by the cleaner 1 second later.
This could be fixed but it's not essential.

I'm guessing this ticket has issues with incremental builds, can you give this a try?

Ic ouldn't reproduce it either. I suspect this is an incremental build issue.

Comment by fbissey created at 2020-02-29 01:29:12

Could you check that `.nodoctest` files are properly installed in vanilla sage? Because vanilla sage runs doctests on original sage sources (while in sage-on-gentoo it is run on the install because the sources are not available at runtime) it may have been missed.

This ticket messes up anyone with data in the old `src/ext` directory. Would have been nice to have some advance notice on sage-devel, you know?

Let me know if you need help with resolving a merge conflict.
