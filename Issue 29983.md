Mobile posets are a new class of finite posets introduced by Garver et. al. in https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08822

In this ticket, mobile posets will be added to Sage as a subclass of finite posets. As well, a new subclass for linear extensions will be made for them.

This is part of the meta-ticket #29687 for GSoC '20.
