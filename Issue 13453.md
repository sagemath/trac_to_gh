# Issue 13453: Mention RDF, CDF in linear algebra tutorial

Issue created by migration from Trac.

The default rings `RR` and `CC` do not support eigenvalue and eigenvector computations for all the cases. It varies from matrix to matrix, and hence these fields shouldn't be encouraged for eigenvalue/eigenvector computations. I am adding a patch to the tutorial which mentions `RDF` and `CDF` as the go-to field for such computations.

Patch attached. Probably needs translation to other languages.

looks good. Are the translations really necessary at this point?

I don't know. Maybe translations to other languages could be done in separate tickets. Just wanted to give a heads-up to anyone who could do any translations.

"looks good". Does that mean positive Review? :) May be new ticket could be created and this one given positive review?

the question is whether this is good as it is, or translations are needed right away.

the .ru.patch adds a Russian translation. It's a utf-8 file, and  doesn't show well in the browser, but "dowload the original" works OK.

The English patch should say

```
For computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices over floating...
```

rather than

```
For computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors over matrices with floating...
```

for (eventual) translations, see [this sage-devel thread](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.devel/64089)

Ok. I updated the patch with the fixed grammar. I can't read or understand Russian, so that has to be reviewed by someone else. :)

The ru patch applies, builds, and looks just fine in my browser (Opera-12, Linux x64).

English, German, and Russian versions of the tutorial are the only ones going far enough to make this insertion meaningful.

What about the French one?

it ends some 20 lines before the patch place :-(

Wow the French version of the tutorial looks quite out of date. Time to ask ncohen to do some grunt work (in a different ticket). ;)

Are you sure this doesn't need `tolerance`?  Have you checked on a non-x86_64 machine?

I checked on a PPC G4.

Now fixed in #15063.

> Wow the French version of the tutorial looks quite out of date.

It was, but not as much as one could think. In fact it looks like for some reason ï¿½e98ddeecb6fd8ee3d594e72f99ff28e159611da6 did't make it into the French tutorial despite it being updated (a bit) more recently.
