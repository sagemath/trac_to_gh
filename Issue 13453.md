The default rings `RR` and `CC` do not support eigenvalue and eigenvector computations for all the cases. It varies from matrix to matrix, and hence these fields shouldn't be encouraged for eigenvalue/eigenvector computations. I am adding a patch to the tutorial which mentions `RDF` and `CDF` as the go-to field for such computations.

> Wow the French version of the tutorial looks quite out of date.

It was, but not as much as one could think. In fact it looks like for some reason �e98ddeecb6fd8ee3d594e72f99ff28e159611da6 did't make it into the French tutorial despite it being updated (a bit) more recently.
