There is a `_sum_of_monomials()` method for `ModulesWithBasis` (which probably should be overwritten in `CFM` to take advantage of its internal data structure to avoid transient objects). I feel like it would be best to use that method for the product. Modulo that, LGTM.

I don't want to revert #33102, but I guess I can do it on #33267.
