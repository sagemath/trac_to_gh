# Issue 28379: CombinatorialFace: replace Vrepr() and Hrepr() by more consistent names

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28616

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2019-10-16 08:22:15

CC:  jipilab @laisrast

In order to make `CombinatorialFace` be more consistent with `PolyhedronFace` we make the following changes:

- face.Hrepr(True) -> face.ambient_Hrepresentation(),
- face.Hrepr(False) -> face.ambient_H_indices(),
- face.Vrepr(True) -> face.ambient_Vrepresentation(),
- face.Vrepr(False) -> face.ambient_V_indices().

We keep the old methods with deprecation warnings.

As it is, the ticket is ready to be reviewed. Probably it is easier though to wait for #28613 to be merged.

The code looks fine. Some remarks on the documentation:
* Make the documentation in `ambient_Hrepresentation` and `ambient_Vrepresentation` consistent:
    In `ambient_Hrepresentation` you have

```
        It consists of the facets/inequalities that contain the face
        and the equalities defining the ambient polyhedron.
```


    In `ambient_Vrepresentation` you have

```
        It consists of the ``[vertices, rays, lines]``
        that face contains.
```


* Make the documentation of `n_ambient_Vrepresentation` consistent with the documentation of `n_ambient_Hrepresentation`:

```diff
---        Return the length of the face.
+++        Returns the length of the :meth:`CombinatorialFace.ambient_V_indices`.

```

There are a bunch of test failures that are also on the patchbot

I forgot that #28646 (closed now) uses `Vrepr` and `Hrepr`.

Applied the changes now. Tests pass on my end.
