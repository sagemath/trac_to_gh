The characteristic should be the characteristic of the `K` from this documentation:

```
r"""
Symbolic Coordinate Functions

In the context of a topological manifold `M` over a topological field `K`,
a *coordinate function*  is a function from a chart codomain
to `K`. In other words, a coordinate function is a `K`-valued function of
the coordinates associated to some chart.
```


Now please tell me: how does one retrieve the `K` from the coordinate ring?

On the other hand, the focus on symbolics might imply that the characteristic is always zero, but it would be good if somebody could confirm this.

Thinking more about it, this could be handled in the category of `Algebras`.

Replying to [comment:2 jdemeyer]:

Not really, since you cannot in general know the base ring of an element of `Algebras`.
