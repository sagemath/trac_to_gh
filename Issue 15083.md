Keywords: adaptive refinement, log scale

The adaptive refinement plotting code is not well adapted for a logarithmic scale on the x axis.

In the following example, where the x ranges from `10` to `10^15` no values are computed between `10` and `10^12` which is a big part of the plot when drawn on a logarithmic scale. The plot is linear from `x=10` to `x=10^12` which is quite weird; it should look like the inverse of x : `plot(1/x,1,15)`.


```
plot_semilogx(1/log(x),10,10^15)
```


By changing the left most point of the interval, we confirm the problem:


```
sage: p = plot(1/log(x),10,10^15,scale='semilogx',color='blue',thickness=3)
sage: q = plot(1/log(x),100,10^15,scale='semilogx',color='red', thickness=3)
sage: r = plot(1/log(x),1000,10^15,scale='semilogx',color='green',thickness=3)
sage: p+q+r
```


Also, the semilogx plots looks thinner than usual. I don't know why. This is why I increase the thickness.

That's an interesting question.  Currently the (semi)log plots are just regular plots with a different scale, which is done in the `show` method - see [here](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/src/f0ee3538887fe739601babb54e177ec5e1133b7a/sage/plot/graphics.py?at=default#cl-1957), for instance.

That doesn't mean we couldn't make this happen, but it would be nontrivial.  I feel like this is more of an enhancement request, maybe?  But I'm not wedded to it.
