Keywords: magma, remote

I have frequently encountered computer setups where one has access to a Sage installation locally, but Magma is only installed in a remote machine (say with address 'remote'). Typically one either:
1) Logs into 'remote' via ssh and does some computation in Magma.
2) uses the ssh command

```
    $> ssh -t remote 'magma'
```

to pretend having magma installed locally.

Actually Sage has functionality to use (2) in its interface with Magma, but it is currently broken and not advertised. It presumes that 'remote' also has sage installed (in fact it presumes that sage-native-execute is in the default PATH), for example.

This ticket fixes this, and makes a command like

```
    sage: magma = Magma(server = 'remote', command = 'magma-myversion')
```

work, and provide the user with an interface to a particular version of Magma installed in 'remote'.

I was able to use it! Note that on the server I have access to I need two commands to launch magma

```
$ module load magma/2.11.13    # Slurm
$ magma
```

And `Magma(server='plafrim', command='module load magma/2.11.13; magma')` worked perfectly. Do you think it is worth it to add in the doc?

**Sided note:** Would be nice for users to set up their configurations once for all for these external interfaces (via environment variables?). For example, I have access to maple and magma but they live on two different servers.

That's great! I added the 'command' parameter because it could be potentially useful although I didn't need it. I am happy to see that my guess was correct.

About setting defaults, have you tried to put

```
magma = Magma(server='plafrim', command='module load magma/2.11.13; magma')
maple = (whatever is pertinent, I don't have access to maple)
```

in $HOME/.sage/init.sage?

Finally, although I agree that the documentation should advertise more this feature, I don't know where to put it exactly.

Setting them in `init.sage` is indeed a solution to make `magma(something)` works out of the box.

My question about default configuration did not make much sense since I thought that `SageObject` would have methods `_magma_` and `_maple_`. If it was

```
    def _magma_(self, G=None):
        if G is None:

then it would not take into account any specific server configuration.

Relying on `globals` is not very safe

```
sage: magma = MyMagmaStructure()
sage: bernoulli(3, algorithm='magma') # boom
```


I think that the magma interface (and all interface in general) should just have some default configurable parameters. That would be used with something like

```
sage: sage.interfaces.config('magma', server=X', command='Y')

I would hang those properties on `sage.interfaces.magma.magma`, which is the "default" instantiation of the magma interface.

Note that `sage.interfaces.magma.magma` is instantiated upon load, so we're too late to set defaults for its instantiation. However, actually *starting up* only happens once the interface really gets used, so you could just adapt the relevant properties on the magma object before using the interface.

A workaround you can already do if you want to use a magma with non-standard setting is "monkey patch" the global instance, i.e.,

```
sage: sage.interfaces.magma.magma = Magma(...<options you want>...)
```

with the problem that if some other file (such as `sage.interfaces.all`) has done an `import from`, you're not reaching them. So perhaps it's a little more robust to adjust attributes on `sage.interfaces.magma.magma` rather than rebind it to a different instance (sigh ... and then they say you don't have to think about pointers when working in python)

I have addressed Nils' two concerns above. About the "magma = Magma()" and the configuration parameters, I don't have a quick solution yet. There's a bunch of places in the schemes/ folder that import magma depending on the algorithm chosen. One easy way to fix this is to provide a get_magma_session() and set_magma_session() functions so that something like this would work:

```
sage: set_magma_session(Magma(server = 'remote', command = 'magma_custom'))
sage: function_using_magma(algorithm = 'magma')
```


This would only involve changing the calls that look like:

```
from sage.interfaces.magma import magma
magma.eval('complicated stuff')
```

to

```
from sage.interfaces.magma import get_magma_session
magma = get_magma_session()
magma.eval('complicated stuff')
```


Do you think that this is a good enough solution? If so, I would quickly implement it...

I do not like it so much. It would involve a lot of changes in the schemes/ folder (that people have maybe already copy/paste in their personal code). And, more importantly, it would be different from any other interface in Sage. What about environment variable?

```
$ SAGE_MAGMA_COMMAND = "module load magma/2.11.13; magma"
$ SAGE_MAGMA_SERVER = "plafrim"
$ export SAGE_MAGMA_COMMAND SAGE_MAGMA_SERVER
$ sage
...
```


One just needs in the constructor of `Magma` something like

```
class Magma(Interface):
    def __init__(self, server=None, command=None, ...):
        import os
        if server is None:
            server = os.getenv('SAGE_MAGMA_SERVER')
        if command is None:
            command = os.getenv('SAGE_MAGMA_COMMAND')
```


A solution based on `init.sage` would not work since it is loaded after anything else.

2) I like to be able to write Sage scripts that work after you start sage. Using environment variables forces you to remember always to set them before you start your script, which can be annoying.
3) The environment variable approach doesn't allow the user to compare the result of executing a function with two different Magma installations. Something like this would be desiderable.

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a1')
sage: set_magma_session(Magma(command = 'magma_2-18'))

```

4) I don't understand your first comment. If people has taken Sage code that uses Magma and now Sage adds more functionality, then they can either use the old functionality or adapt the code to the new (and better way), right?

Here is what I propose: add the environment variables (which make sense the moment there is a magma = Magma() line in there...), but also change the functions using magma to use the get_magma_session() function. How reasonable is this?

I think the `set_magma_session` is a rather heavy interface. It seems to me the appropriate place would be a method on `sage.interfaces.expect.Expect` along the lines of

```
def set_server_and_command(self,server,command):
    if self._expect:
        raise RuntimeError("interface has already started")
    self._server = server
    self.__command = command
```

If there are other settings to change as well, it may be necessary to override this routine on Magma (and do the usual super() call thing)

The main thing is that an instantiated expect interface doesn't run a process on its own. Starting it is a separate operation (and in fact, during the lifetime of an expect object it may start and stop underlying processes repeatedly)

The cleaner solution would be to make new `Magma` instances for different server/command settings, but as we've seen a lot of code assumes that there is a single, global, magma instance for default use throughout the lifetime of a sage session.

I like better this approach. That way the server can even be configured in `init.sage`!

I would actually remove the `Magma` from the global namespace. That would not prevent anyone from testing different versions.

In the `Magma` constructor there is the default option `command = 'magma'` which prevents using the environment variable `SAGE_MAGMA_COMMAND`.

Setting the default to `None` is incompatible with

```
        if not user_config:
            command += ' -n'
```

which results in

```
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +=: 'NoneType' and 'str'

Technically, you deprecated the import in the global namespace but not the function in the module. In other words, this does not raise a warning as it should

```
sage: sage.interfaces.magma.magma_version()
```

(because in the long run, we should just get rid of `magma_version`). Would be better to simply deprecate `magma_version` and not modify `all.py` using

```
def magma_version():
    from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation
    deprecation(20388, 'whatever')
    return magma.version()
```


Other than that, everything looks good to me. Nils?
