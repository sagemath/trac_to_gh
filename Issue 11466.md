Hmm, I hadn't seen this before.  Should we do this instead of adding them in piece by piece in some other file with each ticket?  I do like it when we have record of things that have been fixed, but of course with lots maybe it is more convenient...

This was my first patch, so I just didn't know where to put things. The *best* thing to do would be get #12094 and #11483 reviewed so that more of these will work. Then we could stick them in the appropriate TESTS block.

Although, it is nice to have a collection of known bugs: you can always run them to see if a bug has been fixed by a package upgrade. If any have, it's trivial to copy/paste the doctest out and remove the optional flag.

Does that mean #12094 is ready for review?

Yes! Fixed. The subtleties of trac had not yet had time to sink in when I made that patch. There's no option to open a ticket as anything other than new, so it never occurred to me.
