Hmm, I hadn't seen this before.  Should we do this instead of adding them in piece by piece in some other file with each ticket?  I do like it when we have record of things that have been fixed, but of course with lots maybe it is more convenient...

This was my first patch, so I just didn't know where to put things. The _best_ thing to do would be get #12094 and #11483 reviewed so that more of these will work. Then we could stick them in the appropriate TESTS block.

Although, it is nice to have a collection of known bugs: you can always run them to see if a bug has been fixed by a package upgrade. If any have, it's trivial to copy/paste the doctest out and remove the optional flag.

Does that mean #12094 is ready for review?

Not a bad point.  We actually already have a similar file - look at calculus/wester.py.

Yes! Fixed. The subtleties of trac had not yet had time to sink in when I made that patch. There's no option to open a ticket as anything other than new, so it never occurred to me.

Bookkeeping: The doctest for #11594 went in as part of #11483.

And I just posted the doctest for #11591 to its ticket.

Random update: The test for #11594 is no longer needed, it went in another ticket.

#11591 test case still fails.

#11590 test case still fails.

#11238 no longer needed, it went in with the fix.

Just keeping track of known failures so that they can be checked from time to time.

Hi! This is a good idea in principle, but I have a feeling that keeping it updated would be pretty challenging.  By the way, #11591 seems to have worked for quite some time, but the doctest fails because you got the wrong parenthesization - `1/3*pi^2` versus `pi^(2/3)`.  So even though we have plenty of integral errors, this may not be a super-helpful way to do it, given our "manpower" resources.

What do you think?  I propose wontfix, but I'm open to other ideas.

Changing status from needs_work to positive_review.

Yeah that's fine. The idea was that we'd be notified if any of these were fixed upstream (since the tests would start failing). It makes just as much sense to open tickets for each failing integral and check them from time to time.

Resolution: wontfix
