The new package represents the old `OptionalExtension` `sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.tdlib` (building upon #29701, #28925). We use it as an example package for the modularization.

See build/pkgs/sage_tdlib/spkg-install for an overview of the current implementation. In short, we disable the incremental install mechanism of sagelib; instead, we build an sdist for `sagelib` and an sdist for `sage_tdlib` and then install both with `pip`. This should be refined later.

This is part of #29705: Meta-ticket: Modularize sagelib into separate distributions (distutils packages)
