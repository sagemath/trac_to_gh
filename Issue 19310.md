This ticket allows hide labels in plots built with ``ToricPlotter``


```
sage: fan = toric_varieties.dP6().fan()
sage: fan.plot(show_ray_labels = False, show_wall_labels=False)
```

The same is achieved now via

```
 sage: fan = toric_varieties.dP6().fan()
 sage: fan.plot(ray_label=None, wall_label=None)
```

so I would prefer clarifying documentation instead of adding new parameters and extra logic.

Agreed, I hadn't realized this was possible. I modified the ticket
accordingly.
Thanks

PS: do you know if there is already something implemented to get a stereographic
projection of 3d fans? If not this would be a nice addition to ToricPlotter

I would suggest a single commit with the doc addition skipping the old one and its reversal.

Also it would be better to have None in quotes as in

```
``None``
```

since it is a piece of code.

Regarding stereographic projection - there is none (without quotes ;-)), but if you add everywhere appropriate code to handle `mode="stereographic"`, that would be awesome!
