Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: windows cygwin ecm

For some reason, if ECM detects that GMP is built as a shared library (DLL) on Windows, it refuses to build unless the flags `--enable-shared --disable-static` are given explicitly.  I don't think (?) there's any need for a static build anyways so using the flags as suggested should suffice.
