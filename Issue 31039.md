We introduce the methods `tensor_product` and `tensor_power` as per #30373.

Furthermore, we introduce a method `tensor_product`for elements.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31276

Turns out that this is not as easy as expected.

1. `FiniteRankFreeModule` has no attribute (or method) `tensor_type` in contrast to `TensorFreeModule`. If it had, one could just add the tensor types and return the corresponding module. However, I see no point why `FiniteRankFreeModule` should have such a method/attribute apart from this single purpose.
2. Trying to wrap the patch over, it turns out that `TensorFreeModule` inherits from `FiniteRankFreeModule` and therefore inherits all methods and attributes. So far so good, but as I understand the code, instances of `TensorFreeModule` are not intended to use most of these methods. `FiniteRankFreeModule` is intended to be the "control center" that takes care of things. This leads to somewhat strange (and probably unwanted) behavior:
   {{{
   sage: M = FiniteRankFreeModule(QQ, 3)
   sage: T11 = M.tensor_module(1, 1)
   sage: T11 is M.tensor_module(1, 1)
   True
   sage: T11 is T11.tensor_module(1, 1)
   False
   }}}

   and
   {{{
   sage: M = FiniteRankFreeModule(ZZ, 2)
   sage: e = M.basis('e')
   sage: f = M.basis('f', from_family=(e[0]-e[1], -2*e[0]+3*e[1]))
   sage: M.change_of_basis(e, f)
   Automorphism of the Rank-2 free module over the Integer Ring
   sage: T11 = M.tensor_module(1, 1)
   sage: T11.change_of_basis(e, f)
   Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
   TypeError: Basis (e_0,e_1) on the Rank-2 free module over the Integer Ring is not a basis of the Free module of type-(1,1) tensors on the Rank-2 free module over the Integer Ring
   }}}
  
   The latter might be acceptable because `e` and `f` are, strictly speaking, no bases of `T11`. However, this methods has then no use in `TensorFreeModule`. Nevertheless, these are just two examples and there is a lot more. Furthermore, `TensorFreeModule` initializes a bunch of dictionaries, sets and further attributes that are not used anywhere else. I think this should be changed.

Indeed, so maybe a better inheritance structure should be devised.

Yes. This avoids information redundancy, in particular regarding the bases.

Why do you call this strange behavior? Both answers, `True` and `False`, are mathematically correct.

Yes, the `TypeError` sounds correct here.

You mean those attributes inherited from `FiniteRankFreeModule`?

Of course, right, it's the tensor module of the tensor module. But we also have:

```
sage: T22 = T11.tensor_module(1, 1)
sage: T22 is M.tensor_module(1, 1)
False
```

But one could argue here that these objects are different mathematical entities which are just isomorphic. On the other hand, they behave exactly the same as instances of `TensorFreeModule`.

I guess you mean 

```
sage: T22 = T11.tensor_module(1, 1)
sage: T22 is M.tensor_module(2, 2)
False

and the other way around.

Nevertheless, what do we do about my first point in comment:1? An `instanceof` check for each object coming in?
