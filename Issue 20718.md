Fails because of a newly-added module, please merge in next beta 

```
  File "/home/buildslave-sage/slave/sage_git/build/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/schemes/curves/constructor.py", line 43, in <module>
    from .projective_curve import (ProjectivePlaneCurve,
  File "/home/buildslave-sage/slave/sage_git/build/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/schemes/curves/projective_curve.py", line 48, in <module>
    import point
ImportError: No module named point
Sage failed to start up.
