# Issue 25766: Documentation of cvxopt

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26003

Original creator: SimonKing

Original creation time: 2018-08-05 14:54:10

I just tried to build the current beta and had `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes`. cvxopt failed because

```
cp: cannot stat 'html/*': No such file or directory
```


I am not sure if the component should be "documentation" or "packages: standard"

it used to work. Probably messed up during upgrades to use scripts in spkg-install...
I'm having a look now.

no, sorry, it wasn't completely working, due to MathJax issues.
See #14645.
