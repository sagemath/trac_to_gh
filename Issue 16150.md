# Issue 16150: FiniteStateMachine.determinisation: allow input words of length > 1

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16387

Previously, all input words had to be of length 1 when determinisation was called.
This was a rather superfluous constraint as it is simply required to call
split_transitions.

This is now fixed and complemented by some code and documentation cleanup.
