Here is an old patch which applies to Sage 4.7.1.rc1. It should be updated to apply to 5.0.rc1, and probably to use the helper function ncohen wrote for #12942 (hence the dependencies of this ticket).

The current layout of the graph in the patch is based on the drawing on page 9 of the [Graph-Drawing Contest Report](http://www.merl.com/papers/docs/TR98-16.pdf) from the Fifth Annual Graph Drawing Contest. The drawing was made by Petrus Abri Santoso and Andi Surjanto and won first prize in Category C of the contest :)

Is there a better layout we should use?
