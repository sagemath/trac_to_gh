Wow ! Nice embedding ! How did you find that ? `:-)`

Here is an old patch which applies to Sage 4.7.1.rc1. It should be updated to apply to 5.0.rc1, and probably to use the helper function ncohen wrote for #12942 (hence the dependencies of this ticket).

The current layout of the graph in the patch is based on the drawing on page 9 of the [Graph-Drawing Contest Report](http://www.merl.com/papers/docs/TR98-16.pdf) from the Fifth Annual Graph Drawing Contest. The drawing was made by Petrus Abri Santoso and Andi Surjanto and won first prize in Category C of the contest :)

Is there a better layout we should use?

I don't think so -- I've been spending the last 3 hours trying to build one `:-)`

The patch turned out to be trivial to rebase - here's the rebased version. I also moved the Balaban 10-cage from #12942 to the top of the list of Named graphs, since "Balaban10Cage" (and "Balaban11Cage") comes before "BidiakisCube" in alphabetic order... forgot to catch this on #12942 :(

Helloooooooooooo !!!

Ok, your patch was missing some documentation and doctests so I added some in this patch, with the best embedding I was able to build... Of course yours remains the default, I was not able to do better `:-)`

This patch applies on top of yours, so if you agree with those changes... `;-)`

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Awesome! I'll add another patch to fix up some minor stuff. After that I guess it would be best if a third person could review this since we are both basically authors - though I guess it's also possible that I review your part and you review my part, haha.

OK, so one more patch is up now. If you're OK with saying that we are reviewing each other, then we can set this to positive review. Otherwise we can try to find a neutral third party to review this. (Maybe there are some people on IRC...)

Well, I would say that as long as all tests pass (which is the case) and the documentation is nicely built (which is the case too)... If someone is available on IRC it may be better, but otherwise I think this ticket can go `:-)`

ppurka on IRC made a good point - we should probably test the ValueErrors as well...

Done in the new version of my patch. I also refreshed yours so that it still applied on top of it.

:( I just did this with my .2.patch ...

So what did you do with that patch? It won't apply on top of this now without breaking doctests. Can we just keep your old newembedding.patch and my new .2.patch?


---

Comment by kini created at 2012-05-14 09:37:41

Oh, never mind, you uploaded the refresh .2.patch too. Let's see...


---

Comment by kini created at 2012-05-14 09:38:29

Yes, you forgot to update the doctests you added, since I changed the ValueError messages in .2.patch :)

I'll just upload my patches, I've tested that everything is working.
