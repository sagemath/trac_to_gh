# Issue 15621: Change license from GPLv2 to GPLv2+

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15858

Some files in the Sage library are licensed under version 2 of the GPL but not under "version 2 or a later version". This is a problem since we distribute Sage under version 3 of the GPL.

For this to go into Sage we need the permission by the following people (mentioned in the Copyrights) to distribute their contributions under GPLv2+:

* Robert Bradshaw
* Franco Saliola
* Sébastien Labbé
* Arnaud Bergeron
* Amy Glen

I added them in CC. It would be great if you could just state that you accept the license change.

Wow, that takes me back.

But anyway, yeah you can change my contributions to GPLv2+ if you want.

Great. This means that Robert could set this to positive review if he wants to review the changes :)
