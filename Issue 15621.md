Some files in the Sage library are licensed under version 2 of the GPL but not under "version 2 or a later version". This is a problem since we distribute Sage under version 3 of the GPL.

For this to go into Sage we need the permission by the following people (mentioned in the Copyrights) to distribute their contributions under GPLv2+:

* Robert Bradshaw
* Franco Saliola
* Sébastien Labbé
* Arnaud Bergeron
* Amy Glen

I added them in CC. It would be great if you could just state that you accept the license change.
