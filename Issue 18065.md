CC:  ncohen

The `show()` function is an alias for `pretty_print()`. The latter is far less confusing, its just like `print()` except that it makes use of rich output (graphics etc). But just `show(x)` is hardly self-explanatory, and in fact it is often misused in our own tutorials, e.g. 

```
sage: P = parametric_plot(...)
sage: show(P)    # no need to write show() here
```

If you know just a little bit of Python then you would't type in

```
sage: x = 123
sage: print(x)
```

but many users are not aware of the show <-> print analogy.

Now that Jupyter does support interacts, my comment:4 applies again.  I really don't know why everyone thinks `show` is so bad, particularly because to non-programmers "show" is a word while "pretty_print" has an underscore and is confusing.  Printing a plot should tell me stuff about a plot, and printing it prettily should print that stuff prettily.

On the other hand, `display` seems reasonable, though perhaps superfluous to just replace show with display?

Of course this wouldn't show the plot: the statement `P` doesn't do anything. It's exactly the same as a regular non-interactive function:

```
def f():
    P = plot(x)
    P

f()
```

This wouldn't show the plot either.

If you change the last line to `return P` then it *does* show the plot in Jupyter.

Right: executing code in a function is different from executing the same code directly in a cell. This is standard Python stuff, I don't understand how that is related to the discussion of `show()`.

I think switching to `display` is also a great idea (btw GAP also uses `Display`). We would be consistent with ourselves AND jupyter...

That Mathematica uses `Show[]` is another point against as that language is known to get everything wrong ;-)

Though the name display is currently not available as line magics can also be called without percent (not sure why), so the following are equivalent

```
sage: display text plain
sage: display
Display preferences:
* graphics is not specified
* supplemental_plot = never
* text = plain
sage: %display unicode_art
sage: %display
Display preferences:
* graphics is not specified
* supplemental_plot = never
* text = unicode_art
```
