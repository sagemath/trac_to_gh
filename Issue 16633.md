new timings

```
sage: from sage.combinat.designs.latin_squares import MOLS_table
sage: %time MOLS_table(30)
...
CPU times: user 11.2 s, sys: 20 ms, total: 11.2 s
Wall time: 11.2 s
```


old timings

```
sage: from sage.combinat.designs.latin_squares import MOLS_table
sage: %time MOLS_table(30)
...
CPU times: user 12.1 s, sys: 28 ms, total: 12.1 s
Wall time: 12.1 s
```


Approximately one second to compare Sage infinity to an integer... WTF!

I've come across this before; it has something to do with the comparisons involving coercions IIRC. The nice thing is that it works exactly like an infinity:

```
sage: float('inf') == oo
True
```

...... and it has not been implemented in Sage, so there is some hope that it is somehow efficient `-_-`

This ticket has a dependency in needs review... so it has to wait.
