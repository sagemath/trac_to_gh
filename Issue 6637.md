Keywords: backtrack, enumerated set, transitive closure, days57

1. Implement a single entry point for recursively enumerated sets:

```
     RecursivelyEnumeratedSet(seeds, successors, structure=..., enumeration=...)
```

where `structure` takes values in the set `[None, 'forest', 'graded', 'symmetric']` and `enumeration` takes values in the set `[None, 'depth', 'breadth', 'naive']`.

2. Deprecate `TransitiveIdeal`, `TransitiveIdealGraded` and `SearchForest` as entry point.

3. `TransitiveIdeal(succ, seeds)` keeps the same behavior as before and is now the same as `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet(seeds, succ, structure=None, enumeration='naive')`.

4. `TransitiveIdealGraded(succ, seeds, max_depth)` keeps the same behavior as before and is now the same as `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet(seeds, succ, structure=None, enumeration='breadth', max_depth=max_depth)`.

Remarks:

A. For now the code of `SearchForest` is still in `sage/combinat/backtrack.py`. It should be moved in `sage/sets/recursively_enumerated_set.pyx`. See #16351.

B. `TransitiveIdeal` and `TransitiveIealGraded` are used in the code of `sage/combinat`, `sage/categories` and `sage/groups` at least. These should be updated to use `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` for speed improvements and also to avoid issues explained in C below. See #16352.

C. Note that there were some issues with `TransitiveIdeal` and `TransitiveIdealGraded`, namely:

   - Enumeration of `TransitiveIdeal` is claimed to be depth first search in the top level file `backtrack.py`, but in fact, it is neither breadth first neither depth first. It is what I call a naive search.
   - Enumeration of `TransitiveIdealGraded` is indeed breadth first as claimed but it does not make use of the graded hypothesis at all because it remembers every generated elements.

See [my status report at SageDays57](http://www.liafa.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~labbe/blogue/2014/04/my-status-report-at-sage-days-57-recursivelyenumeratedset/) for more info.

In a tentative to find good choices for name and so on, here is how I see this.

- Let X be a set.
- Let R be a binary relation on X, that is R is a subset of the cartesian product of X times X.
- Denote by xRy if x is R-related to y.

Now

- Let `seeds` be a subset of X.
- Let `succ` be a callable python object `X -> 2^X` such that xRy if and only if y is in `succ(x)`.

We are interested in the subset S of X that can be generated from the `seeds` using the `succ` recursively. More precisely in the set 

 S = {y : x = x1 R x2 R x3 R ... R xn = y and x in `seeds`}.

Moreover, we are interested in the enumeration of S itself and we consider depth-first and breadth-first as different and both usefull.

Such a relation G = (X,R) can be seen as a directed graph. I think this remark is useful as it may provide some vocabulary. Indeed the set S is the connected components of the generators in the digraph G.

I see some different cases :

**1. We do not know anything more about the relation.** We need to save in memory all the `known` objects to avoid duplicates. This is what is currently done in `TransitiveIdeal` (depth-first search) and (curiously) in `TransitiveIdealGraded` (breadth-first search) also.

**2. The directed graph S is a forest with given `seeds`.** Equivalently, one may say that S do not contain cycle (oriented or not). This is what is currently done in `SearchForest`.

**3. The relation is graded.** By graded here I mean what I thought `TransitiveIdealGraded` was doing until I look more carefully at the doc and the code. More seriously, by graded I mean the following : for all (x1 in seeds) and (y1 in seeds), 

  if (x1 R x2 R ... R xn) and (y1 R y2 R ... R ym) and (xn=ym), then (n=m).

The relation is graded if all path from the origin to an element have the same length. In this case, we only need to save in memory the current level.

**4. The relation is symmetric.** If the relation is symmetric, we only need to keep in memory the last two level of depth. This is what I needed and coded this week. And this is why I started to look more carefully at the code in `sage/combinat/backtrack.py`...

That is it for now!

I totally agree with the analysis!

I don't know yet what would be the best name for the argument provided by the user to describe the relation. Behind the scene we are definitely modelling relation. But what the user provide is not the relation but a function that computes the (out) neighbors for this relation. If at the end of the day we choose "TransitiveClosure" as name for the main entry point, then "neighbors" would be consistent.

I think `relation` would not be too bad for the name of the successor keyword and should be considered as well. In some sense, a binary relation is a function `f: X -> 2^X` and a function is a relation such that `|f(x)|=1` for all x.

Possibilities for successor keyword :

- `succ` : suitable for non symmetric relation, currently used in `TransitiveIdeal` and `TransitiveIdealGraded`
- `successors`
- `operators`
- `neighbors` : suitable vocabulary for symmetric relation
- `children` : suitable vocabulary for non symmetric relation, currently used in `SearchForest`.
- `relatives` : suitable vocabulary for symmetric relation

Possibilities for generators keyword :

- `generators`
- `gens`
- `roots`
- `seeds`

I like RecursiveSet. Maybe RecursiveEnumeratedSet is more related to what we do but is also longer.

```
sage: f = lambda a: [a-1,a+1]
sage: C = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([10, 15], f, structure='symmetric')
sage: it = iter(C)
sage: %time L = [next(it) for _ in xrange(10^6)]

With my commit:

```

sage: C = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([10, 15], f, structure='symmetric')
sage: it = iter(C)
sage: %time L = [next(it) for _ in xrange(10^6)]

Wall time: 8.15 s

I'm sure I haven't done the best cythonization job on this, but it works and all tests pass. If you're happy with my changes, then positive review.

Ok, now I see what you mean. When the class is `cdef`, then the `__classcall_private__` do not get called instead of the `__init__`:

```
sage: f = lambda a: [a-1,a+1]
sage: RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([0], f)
A recursively enumerated set (depth first search)
sage: RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([0], f, structure='symmetric')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'structure'
```

I also saw in the [doc](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/misc/sage/misc/classcall_metaclass.html) that: "*For a Cython class (not cdef since they doesnât allows metaclasses)*"

Yes exactly. I needed to play with it to understand what you meant.

Well, the renaming was just an easy way for me to check that `sage -t recursively_enumerated_set.pyx` was ok after I realised that `__classcall_private__` was ignored by `cdef` class. It was not a suggestion, but it would not be the first renamed function:

```
sage: import_statements(sum)
from sage.misc.functional import symbolic_sum
```

So, we go with commit âdd72bfc instead of â3191690 ?

The more I think about it, the less I like it. I think âdd72bfc can be confusing for someone looking at the file for the first time.
