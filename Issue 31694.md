We add `_sympy_` methods to various parent classes, returning sympy `Integers`, `Reals`, `Complexes`, `ProductSet`.

Part of #31926 Meta-ticket: Connect Sage sets to sympy sets

Nice - if patchbot says yes this this seems to be good.  

Question: Do these reimport into Sage as one might expect (does the diagram commute in either direction)?  If so, some tests for that might be appropriate.  Also, with the products, what happens if one of the parts doesn't have a Sympy version - presumably there is an error message, but is it a useful one?

No, the other direction of conversion is not implemented yet, this would be part of #31935. The closest we have is `sage.interfaces.sympy.sympy_set_to_list`, which converts from various sympy set types to lists of Sage SR relation expressions.

It fails with an unpleasant error message because SymPy tries too hard to make sense of it. Example:

```
sage: F = FiniteEnumeratedSets().example()
sage: cartesian_product([F, F])._sympy_()
SymPyDeprecationWarning: 

String fallback in sympify has been deprecated since SymPy 1.6. Use
sympify(str(obj)) or sympy.core.sympify.converter or obj._sympy_
instead. See https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/18066 for more
info.

  SymPyDeprecationWarning(.....)

SyntaxError: invalid syntax (<string>, line 1)

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

SympifyError: Sympify of expression 'could not parse 'An example of a finite enumerated set: {1,2,3}'' failed, because of exception being raised:
SyntaxError: invalid syntax (<string>, line 1)
```


#31938 will provide all Sage sets with a `_sympy_` method.

I agree this isn't as helpful to the end user.  What I'd formally recommend as a review, until #31938 is merged, is to document this type of error as a doctest so it is at least searchable if someone comes across it.
