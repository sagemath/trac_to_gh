In this ticket, we clean methods for adding/removing vertices/edges and enumerating neighbors. The main changes are:
- add parameter `sort` to method `.vertices`. This gives an alternative to `list(G)`.
- in method `delete_vertices`, we add as first instruction `vertices = list(vertices)`. This way we now allow to call this method with an iterator. Before, the method was not removing any vertex when called with an iterator. This will certainly help reducing further the number of calls to `.vertices()`.
- in method `vertex_iterator`, we remove doctests related to former networkx backend
- change in method `remove_multiple_edges` that should make it faster
- PEP8 cleaning

}
```

Just for clarity, I think it is better to add these parentheses: `if (not sort) and key:`

Since `u` and `v` are code inputs for the one-line descriptions, I think it would be better to do

```diff
-Delete all edges from `u` to `v`.
+Delete all edges from ``u`` to ``v``.
```


I think the `OUTPUT:` block for `has_vertex` is functionally useless and can be safely removed (it is essentially a copy of the one-line description).

Other than that LGTM.
