```
sage: Words(srange(3), finite=True)
Finite and infinite words over {0, 1, 2}
```

I would have expected to get only the finite words. The same for `infinite=True`.

Note that there are #21178 and #21181 (fixing docstrings) just in case you want to make changes to the code.  (In that case, this ticket should depend on the latter.)

While there's no `INPUTS:` section, the signature tells that both keyword arguments default to `True`:

```python
Words(alphabet=None, length=None, finite=True, infinite=True)
```

#21181 already depends on #21178.
