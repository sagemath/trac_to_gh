CC:  @dimpase @seblabbe @slel @kliem @orlitzky @vbraun

This will make it an error if no suitable system gcc / python3 is found.

It can be overridden by the user by `--without-system-gcc`, `--without-system-python3`

there are standalone distributions of gfortran for macOS by the gfortran maintainer of the Homebrew package.
To me this offers a way to entirety remove gcc and gfortran spkgs from Sage.

I've put a broken `gcc` ahead of everything in my PATH, and tried `./configure`

Is this how the error regarding missing gcc should look like?

```
checking for gcc... gcc
checking whether the C compiler works... no
configure: error: in `/mnt/opt/Sage/sage-dev':
configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
See `config.log' for more details
```


and there is nothing beyond that in `config.log`, no `more details`, really, except `configure: exit 77` as the last line.

No, see comment:35. This ticket is not about early exits caused by standard autoconf macros. It is about our spkg-configure which uses more specific tests regarding the compiler.

If you want to test this properly, use a working but out-of-version-range compiler such as gcc 4.4 or 12.dev.
