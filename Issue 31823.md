CC:  dimpase slabbe slelievre @kliem mjo vbraun

This will make it an error if no suitable system gcc / python3 is found.

It can be overridden by the user by `--without-system-gcc`, `--without-system-python3`

I don't think there are build problems with python3 on any of our platforms -- with the exception of builds on top of conda on Linux (which is currently broken in multiple ways)

I think the point was just that some (new) users are surprised that we build our own python. But in contrast to the gcc build, which rarely works at all, building python3 is very robust. So I don't think this warrants the change of defaults.

It's hard to avoid error exits from standard autoconf macros. Ticket #29531 sketches a solution, but it's tricky, and I consider it out of scope.

there are standalone distributions of gfortran for macOS by the gfortran maintainer of the Homebrew package.
To me this offers a way to entirety remove gcc and gfortran spkgs from Sage.

I've put a broken `gcc` ahead of everything in my PATH, and tried `./configure`

Is this how the error regarding missing gcc should look like?

```
checking for gcc... gcc
checking whether the C compiler works... no
configure: error: in `/mnt/opt/Sage/sage-dev':
configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
See `config.log' for more details
```


and there is nothing beyond that in `config.log`, no `more details`, really, except `configure: exit 77` as the last line.

No, see comment:35. This ticket is not about early exits caused by standard autoconf macros. It is about our spkg-configure which uses more specific tests regarding the compiler.

If you want to test this properly, use a working but out-of-version-range compiler such as gcc 4.4 or 12.dev.
