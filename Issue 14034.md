As the title says, this patch implements a `.polyhedron()` method which returns the `Polyhedron` object defined by the LP.

And some doc, while we are at it.

I can think of two not always equal things this returns

* the original polyhedron described by the input
* the way it is represented by the backend invoked.

Please clarify in the docs. Also, please add tests for unbounded and empty cases...

I don't see what you have in mind. The LP variables are internally numbered from 0 to n-1, that is also the case with the variables of a Polyhedron. With this, there is only ony way to define the constraints, isn't it ?

actually, you yourself pointed out to me, a while ago, a case where a backend (GUROBI?) does some nontrivial rewriting of a constraint, if I recall right, of the form a<=x_i<=b, resulting in adding a new variable, or something like this.

Arggggggggg... Right. I had totally forgotten about that. I will add a warning. I hate these hacks `:-/`
