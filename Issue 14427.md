I sent you a link to a text about them, didn't I? Here is another link:

Most of the graphs described there are of this type (expect the Grassmann graphs, E_6, and the rest of low-dimensional examples).

I have about 10 other things I must work on now (if not last month or year :)), and organization of this:

And I don't even have a fixed job, as you know, so you don't feel the pressure I do feel from this side...
