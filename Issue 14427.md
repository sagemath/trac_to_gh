How about "normal" polar space graphs? Any affine polar graph is (perhaps a quotients of) the subgraph induced on the non-neighbours of a  vertex in a polar space graph.

Ahahah. Dima, I have NOooooooooo idea what "normal polar space graphs" are. I barely understand what this patch does in the first place. Why don't you give it a try, by the way ?

I sent you a link to a text about them, didn't I? Here is another link:
http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/graphs/srghub.html
Most of the graphs described there are of this type (expect the Grassmann graphs, E_6, and the rest of low-dimensional examples).

I have about 10 other things I must work on now (if not last month or year :)), and organization of this:

And I don't even have a fixed job, as you know, so you don't feel the pressure I do feel from this side...

Made it a Git branch, as I need to use it.

With #16362 one can construct VO(n,q,<sign>) by merely taking the subgraph induced on non-neighbours of a vertex in 
`OrthogonalPolarGraph(n+2,q,<sign>)`. I don't insist on rewriting the code, but this should at least be mentioned in the docs somewhere.

That's what happens when a patch stays in "needs_review" for one year.

I will add a commit in a second `:-P`

well, [my comment](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14631#comment:6) on this fact is about a year old :â€“)

It must be then pure coincidence that I mention http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/graphs/srghub.html there (the link mentioned by you in  #16362) :P

`Affine Polar Graph page ` should be 
`Affine Polar Graphs page `

This code has the same potential bug as mentioned in [here](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16362#comment:4).
Please fix.

Comment by dimpase created at 2014-05-18 22:22:27

Also, for consistency with  #16362, the function `AffinePolarGraph` should be renamed `AffineOrthogonalPolarGraph`.

Well, given that it still passes tests... `:-)`
