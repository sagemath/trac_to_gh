Ahahah. Dima, I have NOooooooooo idea what "normal polar space graphs" are. I barely understand what this patch does in the first place. Why don't you give it a try, by the way ?

I sent you a link to a text about them, didn't I? Here is another link:

Most of the graphs described there are of this type (expect the Grassmann graphs, E_6, and the rest of low-dimensional examples).

I have about 10 other things I must work on now (if not last month or year :)), and organization of this:
http://web.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~dima/IMS2013/
And I don't even have a fixed job, as you know, so you don't feel the pressure I do feel from this side...
