Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16159

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2014-04-14 14:05:21

Assignee: vdelecroix

Keywords: flat surfaces, Abelian differentials, quadratic differentials

The ticket introduce improvements to the current code in `sage.dynamics.flat_surfaces.quadratic_strata` especially:
 - classification of connected components (from Kontsevich-Zorich)
 - explicit permutation representative for each connected components (from Zorich)
 - recognize the connected component of a given permutation

It also refactors the code for Abelian differentials.
