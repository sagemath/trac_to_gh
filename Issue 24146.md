There's a little text file `src/sage/combinat/words/notes/word_inheritance_howto.txt` dating back to around when this module was first added, and that I think is just kind of free-floating.  If there's anything of value in it, those bits should be moved into the actual module documentation.  Otherwise it can probably be removed (it references some of the interfaces removed here).
