I don't know what the Sage policy is on how long something can be marked "Deprecated" before it's removed, or even if it's ever removed at all.  But +1 in principle.

One year deprecation is the official policy.

There's a little text file `src/sage/combinat/words/notes/word_inheritance_howto.txt` dating back to around when this module was first added, and that I think is just kind of free-floating.  If there's anything of value in it, those bits should be moved into the actual module documentation.  Otherwise it can probably be removed (it references some of the interfaces removed here).

I have just changed this file a little bit (removing references to what was deprecated and is being removed) and turned it into rst. No idea if it still make any sense.

Okay, we can worry about what to do about that file, if anything, separately then.
