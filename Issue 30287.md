# Issue 30287: Remove `maybe_newfaces` in combinatorial polyhedron

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30524

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2020-09-07 20:01:16

Keywords: simplification, combinatorial polyhedron

This ticket removes `maybe_newfaces` from the face iterator.

There used to be a `uint64_t**` with the data called `maybe_newfaces` and a `uint64_t**` that points to the actual newfaces. We remove this double structure my swapping the new faces in place.

We also get rid of a superfluous function `get_next_dimension_loop` in `ListOfFaces`.

We do not expose the original pointers to the coatoms such that e.g. sorting of the coatoms would be possible in the face iterator (note that still the actual data is exposed, which one shouldn't alter anyway).
