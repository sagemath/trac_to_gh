Isn't `reversed(list(enumerate(...` equivalent to `reversed(enumerate(...`, but slower?

Hi, sorry, I'm an idiot:

> TypeError: 'enumerate' object is not reversible

You have to do `sorted(enumerate(x), reverse=True`), but I've done some testing and that's actually slower regardless of the size of your collection. So you can just drop that last commit. The rest looks good.
