```
[11:46] <wjp> malb: I slightly updated your fplll patch replacing ret < 0 by ret != 0 since fpLLL returns positive values on error
[11:46] <malb> I disagree
[11:46] <malb> are you sure it has to be an error if !=0 ?
[11:47] <malb> it just returns kappa, doesn't it?
[11:47] <wjp> only in error case, as far as I can tell
[11:47] <malb> the example will not work if you test for ret != 0
[11:47] <malb> i.e. the doctest I just added
[11:48] <wjp> that's strange; I'll look through the fplll sources again then
[11:48] <malb> also heuristic may return kappa != 0 because it is not guaranteed to be LLL reduced anyway
[11:48] <malb> I only superficially scanned the source though
[11:48] <wjp> hm, so it might not be usable as an error code
[11:49] <malb> yes, but I am not sure, we could ask Damien?
```

For a patch see fplll2.patch from #1188.

Cheers,

Michael

Changing keywords from "" to "wjp".

Checking for "< 0" seems to be fine as far as I can see (we do that). So I vote for `invalid`.

I think that we should check for != 0 in all fpLLL calls that are guaranteed to return an LLL-reduced basis, including 'wrapper'.

Rationale: Damien StehlÃ© writes:

```
Internally, LLL calls may fail (which is why we need the wrapper). If
a LLL call returns 0, then it went fine. Otherwise, it can return -1
or a positive value. -1 means that there were too many loop iterations
(very unfrequent), and >0 means that the size-reduction failed (much
more frequent if the precision is not high enough).
```

This means that a positive value indicates a non-reduced basis, which is an error condition for the proved fpLLL functions. (The actual returned value kappa seems to indicate the row in which the size-reduction failed.)

malb: on IRC, you mentioned a testcase that triggered a positive return value in the main wrapper. Which one? The doctest in `fplll.pyx`'s `wrapper()` seems to work for me. (I tried ~20 times since it has random input.)

I suggest to check for
 * wrapper: !=0
 * proved: !=0
 * heuristic: nothing
 * fast: nothing

as this seems to be correct and to worry about resulting errors afterwards.

That makes sense. The attached patch implements it.

The patch looks good and applies cleanly, but:


```
File "fplll.pyx", line 162:
    sage: F.wrapper()
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/malb/SAGE/local/lib/python2.5/doctest.py", line 1212, in __run
        compileflags, 1) in test.globs
      File "<doctest __main__.example_8[4]>", line 1, in <module>
        F.wrapper()###line 162:
    sage: F.wrapper()
      File "fplll.pyx", line 187, in sage.libs.fplll.fplll.FP_LLL.wrapper
        raise RuntimeError, "fpLLL returned %d != 0"%ret
    RuntimeError: fpLLL returned 3 != 0
```


This is on a 64-bit Linux. I assume this can be reproduced on `sage.math`.

PS: Trying something bold and reassigning this ticket to wjp, feel free to bounce it.

The patch is fine, it just exposes a bug on my machine. I say apply.
