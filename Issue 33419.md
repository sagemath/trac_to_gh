CC:  @yuan-zhou @mkoeppe

Keywords: solid angle

Implement the solid angle measure (the plane angle) of a two-dimensional cone, using the dot-product formula. Later we will add methods for three-dimensional and higher-dimensional cones.

Examples to be added.

It would be better to expose it to the user only via a method of `ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone`.
