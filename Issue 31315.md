On macOS, even when using `gcc -isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk` (which disables use of `/usr/local`), Singular's `configure` script sneaks in `/usr/local/include` and `/usr/local/lib`.

```
It was created by singular configure 4.2.0p1+2021-03-13+sage, which was
generated by GNU Autoconf 2.69.  Invocation command line was

If NTL from homebrew is installed, this can lead to an NTL threading mismatch:

```
    [singular-4.2.0p1+2021-03-13+sage]   ld: illegal thread local variable reference to regular symbol __ZN3NTL13ErrorCallbackE for architecture x86_64
    [singular-4.2.0p1+2021-03-13+sage]   clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```


We fix this by passing gmp configuration to the Singular configure script.

But the problem is real - Singular will not use gmp that can be found by compiler and linker if it finds `/usr/local/include/gmp.h`

I'd agree with that. I have been thinking of giving the detection of other libraries the treatment I gave to flint and I decided to give up because I don't need that kind of problem right now. I like the simplicity of your minimal fix.
