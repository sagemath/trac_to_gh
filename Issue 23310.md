# Issue 23310: Add isl and barvinok packages

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23547

Original creator: mkoeppe

Sven Verdoolaege's [`isl`](http://isl.gforge.inria.fr/) and [`barvinok`](http://barvinok.gforge.inria.fr/) are excellent packages for lattice points in polytopes etc. 

Python bindings to `isl` are available:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/islpy

It can be installed into sage using pip. It will bring its own copy of `isl`. [Documentation](https://documen.tician.de/islpy/index.html)

The `islpy` package also claims  to provide bindings for `barvinok` (haven't tested).  To enable:

```
./sage -pip install --verbose --install-option --conf:'USE_BARVINOK=True' --install-option --conf:'USE_SHIPPED_ISL=False' --install-option --conf:'USE_SHIPPED_IMATH=False' islpy
```

To do this, we would need `isl` and `barvinok` packages (or just `barvinok`, as "Since release 0.30, the barvinok distribution includes the isl library.") 

Related Python library: [islplot](https://github.com/tobig/islplot)

> It will bring its own copy of `isl`.

I don't think this is acceptable.

I succeeded installing the barvinok program in my Sage installation doing

```
$ git clone git://repo.or.cz/barvinok.git
$ cd barvinok
$ sage -sh
(sage-sh) $ ./get_submodules.sh
(sage-sh) $ sh autogen.sh
(sage-sh) $ ./configure NTL_GMP_LIP=on --prefix=$SAGE_LOCAL --with-gmp-prefix=$SAGE_LOCAL --with-ntl-prefix=$SAGE_LOCAL
(sage-sh) $ make
(sage-sh) $ make install
```

I think that for cleaner packaging all submodules (isl, pet, polylib) should actually be independent packages.

Changing component from packages: experimental to packages: optional.

With the current branch at `82f0f8afd6` I do obtain compilation errors. I might have done something wrong. Problem discussed on [isl-development mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/isl-development/2u9L21TDGuQ).

The three spkg-check does pass on my computer... more testing needed.

Ticket installed and compiled on OSX.

The output of barvinok tests is pretty strange with repetition of 'o' and '.' characters.


```
$ sage -f -c barvinok
...
[barvinok-0.41.1] ./tests/supporting1 --specialization=df --primal --index=10 ok
[barvinok-0.41.1] ./tests/supporting1 --specialization=todd --primal --index=10 ok
[barvinok-0.41.1] ./tests/supporting2 --specialization=random --index=10o.......ooooooooooooooooooooooooo ok................................
[barvinok-0.41.1] ./tests/supporting2 --specialization=bf --index=10oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[barvinok-0.41.1]  ok
[barvinok-0.41.1] ./tests/supporting2 --specialization=df --index=10./tests/ehrhart/g13.in
[barvinok-0.41.1]  ok
[barvinok-0.41.1] ./tests/supporting2 --specialization=todd --index=10..........ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[barvinok-0.41.1]  ok
...
```

Checks tests are successful for the three packages on OSX.

Installation tested on Ubuntu 16.04. `sage -f -c barvinok` works. Positive review.

Note that `isl>=0.20` breaks compiling of `gcc` (fix in #26735), so this presumably makes `make isl && make gcc` fail, even on computers with system `isl<0.20`. (I have system `isl=0.20` already, so I can't test that this is the case.)
