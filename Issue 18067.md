# Issue 18067: Integer and Rational comparisons

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18304

Comparing integers is very fast, comparing rationals is very fast but comparing integer with rational is about 5x slower:

```
sage: a = 1; b = 18
sage: timeit("a < b", number=500000, repeat=100)
500000 loops, best of 100: 64.3 ns per loop
sage: a = QQ(1); b = QQ(18)
sage: timeit("a < b", number=500000, repeat=100)
500000 loops, best of 100: 88.4 ns per loop
sage: a = 1; b = QQ(18)
sage: timeit("a < b", number=500000, repeat=100)
500000 loops, best of 100: 416 ns per loop
```

It's not really a big deal, but I'm not much of a fan of these global `mpz_tmp`/`mpq_tmp`: this is one more thing that will break if it ever becomes possible to have multi-threaded sage code... Did you check if there is a measurable performance benefit?

Also, couldn't `__richcmp__` just call itself instead of having duplicate code to handle the case where `right` is of the type defined by the class?

By the way, if you make further changes, perhaps you could take the occasion to make `_cmp_` use `rich_to_bool_sign` too.

Hello,

Me neither (and there is actually one in `sage.rings.integer` that is not from me). The ideal would be for gmp/mpir to provide a `mpq_cmp_mpz`. Do you think that it is reasonable to ask them?

> Did you check if there is a measurable performance benefit?

It is minor but timings are in the ticket description. In a more concrete situation

```
sage: l = [ZZ.random_element() for _ in range(100)]
sage: l.extend(QQ.random_element() for _ in range(100))
sage: shuffle(l)
sage: %time l.sort()
CPU times: user 0 ns, sys: 0 ns, total: 0 ns
Wall time: 1.21 ms
```

compared to

```
sage: %time l.sort()
CPU times: user 0 ns, sys: 0 ns, total: 0 ns
Wall time: 247 µs
```


> Also, couldn't `__richcmp__` just call itself instead of having duplicate code to handle the case where `right` is of the type defined by the class?

I do not know why it was done this way for integers. I just naively used the implementation of `Integer.__richcmp__` as a template.

> By the way, if you make further changes, perhaps you could take the occasion to make `_cmp_` use `rich_to_bool_sign` too.

Yes.

Actually, no. Because it is *not* a rich comparison but just comparison.

Yes, I saw that.

I have no idea.

No, I mean specifically for using a global temporary variable instead of creating a new one each time.

Right, sorry.

With 

```
sage: l = [ZZ.random_element() for _ in range(100)]
sage: l.extend(QQ.random_element() for _ in range(100))
```


declaring global `mpz_tmp` and `mpq_tmp` I got

```
timeit("shuffle(l); l.sort()", number=5000, repeat=10)
5000 loops, best of 10: 131 µs per loop
```

and with local ones

```
sage: timeit("shuffle(l); l.sort()", number=5000, repeat=10)
5000 loops, best of 10: 177 µs per loop
```


Note that this bad scenario only occurs for comparisons of:
 - Python long with Sage Integer
 - Sage Rationals with Sage Integer, Python int, Python long

There is a slightly another annoying thing with the global `mpz_tmp/mpq_tmp`: `mpir/gmp` do not free the memory of a `mpz/mpq` if it is not asked explicitely. So if you compare a very big rational with a very big integer you will occupy some memory for the rest of the Sage session (similarly for a big Python long with a big Sage Integer).

I will try harder to see if there is a way to tweak `mpir` to avoid the creation of anything when we want to compare `mpz` to `mpq`. I think that having slow comparison Python long / Sage integer is not an issue. In other words, we should get rid of these global variables.

Hi Vincent,

Do you still want to patch mpir after the answers you got on mpir-devel and gmp-devel? If you do: would the code from this ticket still work if sage is built with gmp?

Hi Marc,

Thanks for having a look.

Replying to [comment:15 mmezzarobba]:

Last news from GMP: they kind to agree that a `mpq_cmp_z` would be good (note that it is `mpq_cmp_mpz` in my branch). But I am not sure anything concrete already happened.

You are right, I need to also patch gmp in order to make Sage works. Another option is to wait for upstream upgrading from both GMP and mpir. What do you think? I mostly wanted to test it.

I'd wait.

Looks more reasonable to me as well (I do not like to patch upstream). So I will push harder upstream to have these functions in the next releases.

Overall, I think this is ready to go into Sage. However, close to the realm of bikeshedding, I would change:

```diff
-if not isinstance(left, Rational):
-   raise RuntimeError('this should not happen')
+assert isinstance(left, Rational)
```

---

Comment by tscrim created at 2017-06-12 23:00:26

Thanks. However, I just had a strong sense of dread come over me when I thought about why the old code was checking left/right. In code like `__eq__`, Python will sometimes swap the arguments, see:

https://eev.ee/blog/2012/03/24/python-faq-equality/

I do not know if this is done for `__richcmp__` with extension classes, but I probably won't be able to look into this until tomorrow.

does not build, due to a changed import (richcmp stuff is now in sage.structure.richcmp)

Hmm...I could've sworn Python sometimes flips inputs for something like `__eq__`, but maybe I am thinking of some other operation. Anyways, looks good and ready to be merged.
