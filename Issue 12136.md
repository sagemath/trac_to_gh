Cremona's database has been updated twice since #11587, the purpose of this ticket is to update the optional spkg to the current version. Since this is a rather basic update, and doesn't touch any of the standard hg repos, I'm hoping we can get close this ticket with the upcoming 4.8 release.

I've posted the a new spkg at [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/cremona-database/database_cremona_ellcurve-20120113.skpg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/cremona-database/database_cremona_ellcurve-20120113.skpg).

Understood -- but it's only an *optional* spkg.  Anyway, release manager gets to have the last word...

Before #11587 there were a few places within the sage library which had hard coded the version of the database.

```

I re-tested this (I was able to find the correct spkg the first time, BTW).  It applied fine to 4.8.rc0 and all relevant tests pass.


```
sage: CDB=CremonaDatabase()              
sage: CDB.number_of_curves()         
1406789
sage: CDB.number_of_isogeny_classes()
965348
sage: CDB.conductor_range()
(1, 220000)
```


Whenever 4.8 is released this spkg needs to be put where the other oprional spgs are.
I really really do not see why this has to wait until 5.0 since it has no effect at all on the Sage library....
