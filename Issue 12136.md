# Issue 12136: Update Cremona's table of elliptic curves for Sage

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12308

Original creator: ohanar

Cremona's database has been updated twice since #11587, the purpose of this ticket is to update the optional spkg to the current version. Since this is a rather basic update, and doesn't touch any of the standard hg repos, I'm hoping we can get close this ticket with the upcoming 4.8 release.

I've posted the a new spkg at [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/cremona-database/database_cremona_ellcurve-20120113.skpg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/cremona-database/database_cremona_ellcurve-20120113.skpg).

Positive review -- the new spkg installs fine on 4.8.alpha5 and then all tests in sage/schemes/elliptic_curve pass.  Thanks, Andrew!

Sorry, but I really don't want to add anything more to sage-4.8 (apart to fix serious bugs).

Understood -- but it's only an *optional* spkg.  Anyway, release manager gets to have the last word...

Optional spkgs aren't really versioned.  They don't follow Sage releases, they are just posted all together.  Which means that it doesn't matter when this ticket is closed.

Before #11587 there were a few places within the sage library which had hard coded the version of the database.

I re-tested this (I was able to find the correct spkg the first time, BTW).  It applied fine to 4.8.rc0 and all relevant tests pass.


```
sage: CDB=CremonaDatabase()              
sage: CDB.number_of_curves()         
1406789
sage: CDB.number_of_isogeny_classes()
965348
sage: CDB.conductor_range()
(1, 220000)
```


Whenever 4.8 is released this spkg needs to be put where the other oprional spgs are.
I really really do not see why this has to wait until 5.0 since it has no effect at all on the Sage library....
