# Issue 27231: Containment check for subgroups broken.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27468

Original creator: sbrandhorst

```
sage: G = GL(2,5)
sage: g = G( matrix([[1,0],[0,4]]))
sage: H = G.subgroup([g])
sage: g in H
False
```

Note that

```
sage: g.gap() in H.gap()
True
```

The underlying reason should be

```
sage: G.has_coerce_map_from(H)
False
```

I have never particularly cared for the `G.0` for `G.gen(0)` shorthand, but I am not going to hold up the ticket for it. LGTM.
