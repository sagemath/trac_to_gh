Keywords: q-analogue

one already has the q-Bernoulli numbers of Carlitz

let us also provide the related q-Bernoulli polynomials

Thanks for implementing this. A few things:

- Is there a reason why you changed it to use `polygen`? IMO, the version that is currently there is more explicit (and [slightly] faster because `polygen` does that plus some extra checks). By not using `polygen`, I think this also makes the creation of the polynomial ring in `x` over `ZZ['q']` easier to understand.
- Python's convention for error messages are "to be formatted as phrases" without periods.
- Can you expand your explanation about this comment?
  {{{
This function returns a slight modification of the original
Carlitz `q`-Bernoulli polynomials.
  }}}
- I think we should allow input to override `q` and `x` similar to what the `q_binomial` does.

I have taken care of your first 3 points.

Concerning the last one, I am very reluctant (and was already for `q_bernoulli`).
IMO anybody wanting to specialise x or q to something can just as well compute the polynomial and then specialise it.

To be coherent with `bernoulli_polynomial`, one would also have to put x in the first place among the arguments, and that forces x to be a mandatory argument, which I find very bad.

Okay, fair enough.

Although I was thinking of this for creating the parent and variables:

```
R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'q')
q = R.gen()
x = PolynomialRing(R, 'x').gen()
```

If you want to make this change, then you can set a positive review afterwards. If you don't, then you can set a positive review as well because I'm being nitpicky.
