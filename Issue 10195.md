As I have told few days ago to Jaap I just wanted to upload my spkg and share it with Sage's community in order to everyone who needs it could install it, so this is to open the ticket, I am not any familiar with the procedure, hope it goes in this way, I am attaching it, the md5sum is the next:
george`@`manp-desktop:~/Documentos$ md5sum -b ets-3.5.0-20101024.p0.spkg 
a742400ae39b84db79925d342ba74e33 *ets-3.5.0-20101024.p0.spkg

I tried to attach the file but it is larger than 2Mb it is around 50Mb.

Sorry, what can I do now?

Best regards,
Jorge
