Currently, the ambient space of a polyhedron is always a vector space constructed by `VectorSpace`.  

In this ticket, we define polyhedra in more general vector spaces (anything in the category `VectorSpaces(K).FiniteDimensional()` for some real field `K`). This includes:

- `sage.combinat.free_module.CombinatorialFreeModule` 

- `sage.tensor.modules.finite_rank_free_module.FiniteRankFreeModule`  (vector spaces without distinguished basis)

In particular, the latter has the notion of linear forms, which would be used in the H-description of the polyhedra.

The implementation reduces the problem to the existing polyhedral backends in the coordinates w.r.t. an arbitrary basis.
