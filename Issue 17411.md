Those functions do not depend on the parameters given to the `Partitions` constructor, i.e.:


```
sage: Partitions(5,length=2).from_frobenius_coordinates(([6,3,2],[4,1,0]))
# does not read the input of Partition at all
[7, 5, 5, 1, 1]
```


They should belong to `Partitions_all`

What are "those functions"? Can you be more specific in your ticket description? Also, it looks like you just moved code. Is that what you intended? No new tests etc??

Hello,

> What are "those functions"? Can you be more specific in your ticket description?

My excuses. I thought that this would be clear from the diff, but when you reverse A and B in a file, it is true that git can chose to "remove A and add it somewhere else" or "remove B and add it somewhere else". I just updated the description to say that the three functions I moved are the following:


```
from_frobenius_coordinates
from_beta_numbers
from_exp
from_zero_one
from_core_and_quotient
```


> Also, it looks like you just moved code. Is that what you intended? No new tests etc??

I did not think that there was any need to. The doctests were correct and called `Partitions().from_...`. That command remains valid. On the other hand, `Partition(5).from_...` is now invalid.
