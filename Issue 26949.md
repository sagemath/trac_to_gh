Also should be done for #27168

Note libpng comes in a number of different ABI versions, usually indicated in the library filename as a suffix like "12" (for 1.2.x) up through "16" (for 1.6.x), where 16 is the most current and currently supported by Sage.  Distros like Debian has separate packages for each libpng ABI version.

I think to keep it simple we should specifically check for and require libpng16.  I don't know if all of Sage's dependencies support older libpngs.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27186

That said, my Ubuntu build machine has a kinda old libpng12, and while I'm not saying we *should* support that, I'm curious to see if it will work...

I don't read it this way. I read it as "it won't conflict with the one built by Sage".
Well, maybe I am wrong - it's perhaps worth trying on OSX.

This still sounds as if using system's libPng would lead to various library conflicts (with other Sage-installed versions of stuff also available on the system), i.e. if we go far enough with our plan it would not matter...

Anyhow, I just checked that Homebrew also does not use system's libPng, but installs its own libpng16.dylib.

One way or another, I think we should not block the usage of Homebrew (or conda) libs, i.e. there should not be a rule saying "we're on OSX! install from source").

PS. Last time I checked (few months ago), it's possible to build and run Sage under Homebrew. Basically, it's an environment where lots of stuff lives in /usr/local...

I need to re-review this, but I'm okay with just throwing my hands up and saying to hell with OSX.  If there *is* still an issue we'll find out, and now that we have `--without-system-libpng` at least there's a workaround in place.

I think the zlib <-> libpng stuff here could still be improved. First, trivia; this should be quoted to avoid syntax errors if the variable has a space in it:

```
if test x$sage_spkg_install_zlib = xyes; then
```

Now, the only reason we're checking for `inflateValidate` in zlib is for the benefit of libpng, correct? Because the only place `inflateValidate` is used in our copy of libpng is the following, in `pngrutil.c`:

```
#if ZLIB_VERNUM >= 0x1290 && \
   defined(PNG_SET_OPTION_SUPPORTED) && defined(PNG_IGNORE_ADLER32)
      if (((png_ptr->options >> PNG_IGNORE_ADLER32) & 3) == PNG_OPTION_ON)
         /* Turn off validation of the ADLER32 checksum in IDAT chunks */
         ret = inflateValidate(&png_ptr->zstream, 0);
#endif
```

It's wrapped in a zlib version check, so... does anything bad happen if we simply ignore the matter? That is, drop the `inflateValidate` check from the zlib macro, and eliminate the libpng <-> zlib weirdness as a bonus?

`sage_spkg_install_zlib` is an internal, taking a controlled set of values.

We only check for `inflateValidate` in system's zlib if we cannot use the system's libpng. In this case we need it, as Sage's libpng requires it. This allows us to get away with using older versions of system's libpng/zlib, which are perfectly fine for our purposes.

PS. I think it's a good example of how vendoring of everything leads to a relentless upgrading spiral (cause a vendored version gets broken on one particular system, or due to conflicts with system libraries that happens for one or another reason...)

But are you sure? This code is taken *from sage's libpng*:

```
#if ZLIB_VERNUM >= 0x1290 && \
   defined(PNG_SET_OPTION_SUPPORTED) && defined(PNG_IGNORE_ADLER32)
      if (((png_ptr->options >> PNG_IGNORE_ADLER32) & 3) == PNG_OPTION_ON)
         /* Turn off validation of the ADLER32 checksum in IDAT chunks */
         ret = inflateValidate(&png_ptr->zstream, 0);
#endif
```

and that's the only occurrence of "inflateValidate" in the libpng source code. Since that whole block will be ignored for old zlib, I don't think we actually need `inflateValidate` for our libpng.

(inflateValidate was introduced in zlib commit 9852c209 on 2016-09-20, and ZLIB_VERNUM was set to 0x1290 in commit 2fa463bacf on 2016-12-31, so the check above in libpng should work)

Oh, I see what you're saying now, thanks.

Well, assuming there is one and only zlib, so that  ZLIB_VERNUM correctly identifies the presence of `inflateValidate`, and assuming that a future libpng will not drop this version test for some reason, this test can be dropped.

what is “not working”? it certainly is possible to use system libpng everywhere in sage.
tachyon had to be patched a bit more, iirc, to allow this.

All I did I  changed `-lpng16` to `-lpng` in `a6e554f8755`
to accommodate variations in versions. Note that indeed if libpng is not in the default linker path, i.e. a specific `-L` argument must be supplied, then one might need to patch more...

But otherwise it works, e.g. I have

```
$ ldd local/bin/tachyon 
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffc721f4000)
	libpng16.so.16 => /usr/lib64/libpng16.so.16 (0x00007f0c0a62e000)
	libz.so.1 => /lib64/libz.so.1 (0x00007f0c0a610000)
	libm.so.6 => /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007f0c0a4d3000)
	libmvec.so.1 => /lib64/libmvec.so.1 (0x00007f0c0a4a7000)
	libpthread.so.0 => /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f0c0a484000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f0c0a2b4000)

right. It's quite a mess indeed.
