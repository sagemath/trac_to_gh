Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/2157

In reviewing #2134, it seems that we could easily (and should) phase NetworkX out of the graph plotting code.

This will be resolved by ticket #3541, which I am currently working on.

Hi Emily,

it is policy to close dupes only once the code from the other tickets has been merged. That being said I am fine with this being a dupe.

Out of curiosity: Do you have an ETA for first code to review? I saw the snapshots you send rlm.

Cheers,

Michael
