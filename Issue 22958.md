Follow-up to #22806 and #22896: we should stop using the deprecated files `cysignals/memory.pxi` and `cysignals/signals.pxi`.

This deals with the auto-generated interpreters files. Besides changing the include to a cimport, we also clean up and optimize the memory allocation code a bit.

I don't really know enough about the differences between the old and new APIs to really have an opinion about this, but it seems obvious and straightforward enough.

> I don't really know enough about the differences between the old and new APIs

The main goal here is getting rid of the of Cython `include` statements, which are semi-deprecated(*) by Cython upstream.

The change from `sig_malloc` to `check_allocarray` is just a minor clean-up which removes the need for the `NULL` check.

(*) They would like to deprecate `include` statements. However, there are some corner cases where `include` statements make sense, so they don't formally deprecate them. Instead, they just keep them working in the current state, rejecting any new features.
