I am running the same code under omega now, but that might take an hour or two.

Hi Robert,

the above is from memcheck. I hadn't had time to try the same under omega, but since the above is "still reachable" memory omega wouldn't help in that case anyway since it only prints out messages about "definitely lost" memory. There were a variety of places in the code where about 10.000 buffers were lost, some of which are on the first comment. Only later I did discover that there was one buffer with the exact number of 10,000 losses, so it became my prime candidate. The complere log (6.8MB) is at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/sage-memcheck-1884.log

I should be in IRC if you want to discuss this issue or any input from my end. Note that the memcheck log was created with 2.9.3, so in 2.10 the number might be off.

Cheers,

Michael

This is due to non-uniqueness of real fields. 

```
sage: parent(2.0) == parent(2.0)
True
sage: parent(2.0) is parent(2.0)
False
```

It's making a new parent for the constant in the loop, and adding it to the coercion model. I will fix this now.
