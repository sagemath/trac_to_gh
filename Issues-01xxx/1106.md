The general implementation right now is:

```
cdef int _cmp_c_impl(self, Element right) except -2:
    return cmp(self._list(), right._list())
```
which has a huge memory overhead. This should be optimised. Also, Matrix_modn_dense should have a faster special cmp method.

Component: **linear algebra**
