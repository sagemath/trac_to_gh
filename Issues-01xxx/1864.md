This breaks previously supported functionality (that I won't miss).  It used to be, one could type

```
foo?
```

and press shift-enter to introspect.  I give this a positive review *if* that was an intended change.

The referee claims that say

```
log?[shift-enter]
```

However it *does* work fine with this patch.  The referee needs to try again.
