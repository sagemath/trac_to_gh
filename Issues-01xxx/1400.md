SAGE can compute the class group of a quadratic field, but it has issues with computing the order of elements within that class group:

```
QF.<x>=QuadraticField(-39)
CF=QF.class_group()
CF(QF.ideal(1+x)).order()
```
gives

```

This uses an O(n) algorithm to compute orders.  Don't we have generic BSGS O(sqrt(n)) that would be better here?
