This is a bug:

```
sage: 2^float(3.1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>             Traceback (most recent call last)

/Users/was/<ipython console> in <module>()

/Users/was/integer.pyx in sage.rings.integer.Integer.__pow__()

<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: exponent (=3.1) must be an integer.
Coerce your numbers to real or complex numbers first.

Note:
sage: int(2)^float(3.1)
8.574187700290345
sage: (2/1)^float(3.1)
8.574187700290345
```
