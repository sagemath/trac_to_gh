Boost has a nice concept of "filters" of a graph.  They provide views into subsets of the vertices and/or edges of the graph, based on predicate functions.  That would be nice to have.

See [http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/filtered_graph.html](http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/filtered_graph.html)
