I totally agree.  It would be great if somebody new of a simple
lightweight tool or way to assemble a bunch of png's together
into an animated gif -- I used convert (via imagemagick) since
it was the only thing I could find that works.  Regarding
the lack of a good error message that explains what convert
is, how to install it, etc., that is mainly because I wrote the animate
command pretty recently specifically for a high-school workshop I was
running, and didn't have to worry about convert not being
available.   animate hasn't got the additional polish it deserves.

That's a good point -- that should be changed.

Animate *is* outputting a dorky animated .gif 1995-vintage style.
The con is that it looks dorky.  The pro is that you can save that give
and trivially put it on any web page, etc.

Duh -- now I remember what I was going to do with animate
when I had more time.  Just use javascript!  Javascript
is great at animating a sequence of images, scratching through,
changing the speed, etc.  So, who can find a good free 
javascript script to do this somewhere online, which we can
touch up for inclusion in sage?

What does "do this in javascript" mean?  Do you mean have a sequence of frames displayed using javascript (or something else) instead of an animated gif?   I just want to make sure.  I don't know how to do this, but suspect something like this is possible.  It's the sort of thing I would google for, e.g, "javascript" "animation".   I think flash would also be something to try, though of course it is has openness issues, etc., but the result would be excellent, and it is pretty much the standard on the web for animations, I think.

Here's a stab at using javascript to do animations. This doesn't work, but I don't understand enough about the notebook and/or javascript to know why; maybe someone else can do something with it.  To try it:

```
a = animate([sin(x + float(k)) for k in srange(0,2*pi,0.3)], xmin=0, xmax=2*pi, figsize=[2,1])
a.js()
```
This ought to show the animation, but it doesn't.  As a compromise, it creates a link "animate.html" which shows the animation in a separate browser window.

(Since this doesn't work, it doesn't have much of a docstring, and there are no doctests.)

See #11170 for an approach using ffmpeg.  If #11170 works, should we close this ticket?

I'd say that the following would be needed to close this ticket.
* Add documentation showing actual use of ffmpeg to `animate?` (currently one needs

```
sage.plot.animate.Animation.ffmpeg?
```
  which seems hard to find unless one knows where to look.  Naturally, the doctests would have to be optional.
* Find out whether the annoying issue of Preview automatically opening these in a way that can't be used in Mac can be resolved.
