Dear Matthew,

Thanks for your bug report!

Dear David Joyner (cc: sage-devel):

This is in some latex that you wrote.  Any ideas?

I've made this trac #1602:

on this page

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/html/tut/node24.html

in the table there is what appears to be raw latex rather than
typeset material.
this appears "&vellip#vdots;"
