```
This works:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: f = x^3 + 3/5
sage: f.change_ring(GF(7))
x^3 + 2
```
This should work:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: f = x^3 + 3/5*y + 1
sage: f.change_ring(GF(7))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular' object has no attribute 'change_ring'
```

Component: **commutative algebra**
