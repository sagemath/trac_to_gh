On FreeBSD the default bash installtion location is `/usr/local`. Hence all our shell scripts with `/bin/bash` will break. The solution is to use `/usr/bin/env bash` instead. The same might apply to python and perl scripts.

All known instances of /bin/bash have been fixed. So I am closing this and any new instances can be fixed via new tickets.
