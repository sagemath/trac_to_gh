<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

Mabshoff and I made some changes to this package:
* got rid of the stupid "have to hit return thing" (by hacking setup.py)
* shrunk the package from 21MB to 3.7MB by deleting some pdfs and using compression.
* added an .hg repository as per the package spec. 

Anyway, this is now posted.
