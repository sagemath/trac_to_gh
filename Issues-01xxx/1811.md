The command to do this used to be called "detach".  It has mysteriously completely
vanished from Sage since when I wrote it!  It's in the notebook still, but it isn't available
from the command line anymore.  

Anyway, I've reported this as trac #

In the meantime you can work around this problem as illustrated below:

sage: sage: attach example.sage
This is a simple SAGE example script.
...
sage: import sage.misc.interpreter
sage: sage.misc.interpreter.attached
{'/home2/sage/build/sage-2.10.alpha4/example.sage': 1197908255.0}
sage: del sage.misc.interpreter.attached['/home2/sage/build/sage-2.10.alpha4/example.sage']
sage: attached_files()
