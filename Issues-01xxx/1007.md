I am sure we can do much better than just calling Pari, maybe even using Andrew Arnold's code.

As well as fixing broken ZZ[x], we have before

```
sage: time f = pari.polcyclo(5*7*13*100)
CPU time: 0.18 s,  Wall time: 0.19 s
sage: time f = pari.polcyclo(5*7*13*1000)
CPU time: 14.68 s,  Wall time: 14.75 s
```
after

```
sage: time f = ZZ['x'].cyclotomic_polynomial(5*7*13*100)
CPU time: 0.02 s,  Wall time: 0.02 s
sage: time f = ZZ['x'].cyclotomic_polynomial(5*7*13*1000)
CPU time: 1.01 s,  Wall time: 1.02 s
```
Note that 99% of the time is spent in polynomial construction overhead

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.cyclotomic import cyclotomic_coeffs
sage: time v = cyclotomic_coeffs(5*7*13*1000)
CPU time: 0.01 s,  Wall time: 0.01 s
