The result should be somewhat similar to what MAGMA has to offer

   http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/htmlhelp/text1128.htm

. SINGULAR has support for Hilbert Series computation

  http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/3-0-4/sing_212.htm

which probably can be wrapped to provide the desired functionality.

Singular's Hilbert series has overflow issues in certain situations. Let me digg out some email about a test case and report this to the Singular team.

Cheers,
