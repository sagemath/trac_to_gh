Sage currently works this way:

```
sage: a = matrix(ZZ, 2, [1..4])
sage: a[1]
(3, 4)
sage: a.row(1)
(3, 4)
sage: a[1][0] = 5
sage: a
[1 2]
[3 4]
```

Instead Sage should do this:

```
sage: a = matrix(ZZ, 2, [1..4])
sage: a[1]
boom!
sage: a.row(1)
(3, 4)
sage: a[1][0] = 5
boom!
```

Where boom explains that one should use a.row(...) to get a row, or a[i,j] to get/set the ij entry.

This confuses the heck out of TONS of people!!!  (Not me, but others.)

I just realized that a much better solution is to finish implementing immutable vectors and make the return of A[n] be an immutable row.  It accomplishes the same thing and is more usable.  So I did this.

That said, the above patch is fine -- using .row(...) all over in code is fine and faster.
