The names of "forall" and "exists" suggest that these are predicates that can be used where a conditional is needed. In fact, doing so does not result in an error but in unintended results:
`len([ i for i in [1..300] if forall(prime_divisors(i),lambda i: i<10)])`
returns
`300`
which does not reflect the apparent meaning of the expression. The proper result is returned by inserting an index:
`len([ i for i in [1..300] if forall(prime_divisors(i),lambda i: i<10)[0]])`
which returns
`82`

I would suggest an optional parameter to "forall" and "exists", say, witness=True to return a second return value giving the index. The default should be index=False in my opinion.

Component: **misc**

This patch can `_certainly_` be applied as is, since it just adds some useful info to docstrings.

The only remaining issues from the sage-devel discussion that I can see are some odd timing issues.  But that does not seem a reason to hold back on this.
