The names of "forall" and "exists" suggest that these are predicates that can be used where a conditional is needed. In fact, doing so does not result in an error but in unintended results:
`len([ i for i in [1..300] if forall(prime_divisors(i),lambda i: i<10)])`
returns
`300`
which does not reflect the apparent meaning of the expression. The proper result is returned by inserting an index:
`len([ i for i in [1..300] if forall(prime_divisors(i),lambda i: i<10)[0]])`
which returns
`82`

I would suggest an optional parameter to "forall" and "exists", say, witness=True to return a second return value giving the index. The default should be index=False in my opinion.

As Mike Hansen points out, use python natives "all" and "any" instead. Patch should probably not be merged.

The patch has sat in trac for about two weeks now. William suggested to merge, but maybe Nils has some more input?

This patch can `_certainly_` be applied as is, since it just adds some useful info to docstrings.

The only remaining issues from the sage-devel discussion that I can see are some odd timing issues.  But that does not seem a reason to hold back on this.
