is_pseudoprime?
The help entry for (is_pseudoprime) has a nonwrapping text bug

INPUT:
        flag -- int
                0 (default): checks whether x is a Baillie-Pomerance-Selfridge-Wagstaff pseudo prime (strong Rabin-Miller pseudo prime for base 2, followed by strong Lucas test for the sequence (P,-1), P smallest positive integer such that P^2 - 4 is not a square mod x).
                > 0: checks whether x is a strong Miller-Rabin pseudo prime for flag randomly chosen bases (with end-matching to catch
square roots of -1).
