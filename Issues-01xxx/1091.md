Givaro has a number of constructors with a parameter of type `RandIter&` with default argument of the type `(RandIter& g = *(new RandIter()) )`. This is used to initialize a RandIter member variable, copying the new'ed object and immediately leaking the original.

All three of the valgrind traces found by mabshoff above are leaks of this type.

The attached patch to `givaro-3.2.6.p4` should fix this be changing the constructor declarations to `(RandIter g = RandIter() )`.

It does change the signature of the constructors (`RandIter& -> RandIter`), but I don't see any places where this would be a problem after a scan over the givaro sources.

You may have to manually trigger a rebuild of `finite_field_givaro.pyx`. I think `sage -b` didn't pick up the changes to the givaro headers automatically.
