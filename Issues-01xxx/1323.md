<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
Here is a method for iterating over dimension `k` subspaces of a space of dimension `n`:

First, suppose that `F` is a finite field, and our ambient vector space is just `F^n`.

Any subspace of dimension `k` is uniquely described as the rowspace of a `k x n` matrix in reduced row echelon form. This is determined by which columns are pivots, and what the entries of the remaining positions are. Thus it suffices to iterate over `k`-subsets of `[0..n-1]`, declaring those to be the pivots. Certain entries must be zero, according to row-reduced form, and the rest can be arbitrary elements of `F`.

Thus, for each `k`-subset of `[0..n-1]`, call it `[j_1, ..., j_k]`, construct a matrix with pivots as described by the `j_i`. For the `m` entries that are nonzero, construct a vector space of dimension `m`, and iterate over it, using the resulting tuples to fill in the matrix.

Voila!

I don't know about projective space, though.

Applies cleanly and passes sage -testall. Looks good. 
GAP has this very useful function and now Sage does. 
Thanks Robert!
