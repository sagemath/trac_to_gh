The latest r.spkg from 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-2.10.1/rc0/r-2.6.1.p13.spkg

needs the attached patch to properly import libR.dylib. `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` is properly set, but from some reason import fails. By adding the R's `lib` directory to `DY_LDLIBRARY_PATH` in `sage-env` the issue is resolved. 

Cheers,

Michael
