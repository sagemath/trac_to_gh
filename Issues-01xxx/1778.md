`sage: plot3d(x^2 + y^2, (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2))`

is valid, however, to do a 2d plot, you use the syntax

`sage: plot(x^2, x, -2, 2).`

I spoke with William about this, he wants to deprecate the `plot(x^2, -2, 2)` syntax for 2d plotting and introduce a new preferred syntax:

`sage: plot(x^2, (x, -2, 2))`

<a id='comment:3'></a>That this doesn't work anymore is definitely a bug:

```
sage: plot(sin(2), (x,0,10*pi))
BOOM!
```

Likewise for 

```
sage: plot(sin(2), 0,10*pi)
BOOM
```

I'll try to fix this....
