This seems to work in 2.9.3:

```
sage: m=matrix(ZZ,1,[16]); m
[16]
sage: matrix_plot(m^100).show()
sage:

I do get this warning:

```

Warning: invalid value encountered in multiply
```

but the image shows up (a giant black square, just like it should).

<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

Thanks for reopening this.  The following code displays the wrong plot:

```
a=matrix(2,[16^1000,0,0,-16^1000]);
matrix_plot(a)
```

What should be displayed is the same as the plot:

```
a=matrix(2,[16,0,0,-16]);
matrix_plot(a)
```

So the matrix plot has gone from blowing up to just being wrong.  Whether this is worse or better is left as an exercise for the reader.
