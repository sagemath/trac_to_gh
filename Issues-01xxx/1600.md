Haven't even started trying to track this one down yet:

```
sage: S.<s> = LaurentSeriesRing(GF(5))
sage: T.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(pAdicRing(5))
sage: 
sage: S(t)
(1 + O(5^20))*s
sage: parent(S(t))
Laurent Series Ring in s over Finite Field of size 5
sage: parent(S(t)[1])
5-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20
```

Pretty nasty.
