Hi Mike,

hasn't something happened in that direction already or am I confused?

I just attached a first version of multivariate power series.  In order to pass all tests, one also needs the patches at #9457 and #9443.  Without these, everything still works though.

The implementation is based on an idea mentioned in this sage-devel [thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/40eb14f877b6218a/c30e824e24eee69d?lnk=gst&q=multivariate+power+series#c30e824e24eee69d):
use univariate power series over multivariate polynomial ring to do arithmetic and track total-degree precision, but display as multivariate power series.

Although there are some limitations of this approach, I think there's a useful amount of functionality here and I'm happy with how this first version works.  Having said that, here are some of the issues that are still unresolved.  I'd be happy to hear recommendations about how to prioritize them, or others :)

* sparse:  I tried to include sparse=True in the right places, but I haven't really tested to see whether it's actually better.

* inherited functions: some of them (e.g. 'variable') don't make sense; is there a way to block inheritance of certain attributes?  (del or delattr?) For now, they just return "`NotImplementedError`"s

* inherited functions 2: for multi_power_series_ring_element, there is a pile of functions that could be implemented but aren't (e.g. sqrt, derivative, generating functions, etc).  They're noted in the documentation and lumped together in the code.

* (rich) comparison: comparisons seem to work, but someone who understands the past and future of sage/python comparisons should take a look at it.  (The classes I'm inheriting from seem to use an older system.)

* _l_action_ for multivariate power series:  the function works, but doesn't get called when it should; I don't understand how to fix that. (This only affects cases where the scalar isn't already in the base ring, like when you want to multiply a power series over ZZ by a rational and have the result automatically move to a power series over QQ.)

* division of multivariate power series:  works fine when the denominator is a unit, but not in other cases (even when the result would not be a Laurent series).

* un/pickling: I don't understand this so I haven't done anything with it.

* cython where appropriate:  I don't know C or python, so I've ignored this.

* unifying multivariate and univariate power series, as has been done for polynomials:  seems like a project for another time.

Hi, I took a quick look, here are some examples:

* You don't need #random for random output, the seed of the pseudo random number generator is reset for each doctest plot
* It would be nice if you could add line breaks around 80 for the doc strings
* the arithmetic functions doctests do not test correctness of the output

I know very little about multivariate power series, thus I'm clueless about whether your implementation strategy is (a) standard and/or (b) clever. Is it something that is usually done?

Thanks!

fixed now.


>  * It would be nice if you could add line breaks around 80 for the doc strings


sorry, not sure what you mean by 80 here; I'm happy to add linebreaks though :)


>  * the arithmetic functions doctests do not test correctness of the output


I've added comparisons with polynomial arithmetic; do you think I need to also have the output printed?

I don't know much about this either, but it seems like a natural enough idea.  After a quick look around google, here's one example:

Sorry, I meant around 80 characters, which is the standard UNIX terminal width.

I'd prefer that to be honest.

Have you compared the speed with, say, Magma?

Here are five simple comparisons, three with 2 variables and two with 4 variables, all over QQ.  This sage patch performs substantially better in 3/4 cases, with magma performing substantially better in the other case.  Using polynomial multiplication easily beats magma's restriction on the number of coefficients it will compute for a lazy power series (test 3).

First of all: It would certainly be good to have multivariate power series in Sage. Also the performance seems to be pretty good. Thank you!

I have some criticism, though.

1. `__contains__` and coercion

I was reading part of the patch, and I see that your multivariate power series rings have a custom `__contains__` method. I think it should be possible to simply inherit it.

Moreover, the custom method seems to provide a non-standard behaviour: Usual in Sage is to have `a in R` if and only if `a==R(a)` is True (of course, if `R(a)` raises an error then a is not in R).

Another formulation of the rule is: If a.parent() is P and R has a coercion map from P then a is in R: Since there is a coercion map, R(a) is supposed to work, and `a==R(a)` is equivalent to `R(a)==R(a)`, because this is how comparison with the coercion model works.

But you have in your doctests

```
sage: a in R
False
sage: R(a) in R
True
```
in a situation were apparently a coercion from `a.parent()` to `R` exists.

2. Use of double-underscore methods

In your `__cmp__` method, you do 

```
self._bg_value.__cmp__(other._bg_value)}}}
Generally, one should avoid to call double-underscore methods directly. So, better do 
{{{cmp(self._bg_value, other._bg_value)}}}

The same applies to doctests. So, instead of
{{{
sage: R.<x,y> = MPowerSeriesRing(GF(17)) 
sage: R   
Multivariate Power Series Ring in x, y over Finite Field of size 17 
sage: R.__repr__() 
'Multivariate Power Series Ring in x, y over Finite Field of size 17'
}}}
you should do
{{{
sage: R     # indirect doctest
Multivariate Power Series Ring in x, y over Finite Field of size 17
}}}
and instead of 
{{{
sage: M = MPowerSeriesRing(ZZ,5,'t');
sage: N = M.remove_var(M.gens()[2])
sage: M.__contains__(N.random_element(10))
False
sage: M.__contains__(M.random_element(10))
True
}}}
you should have
{{{
sage: M.random_element(10) in M
True
}}}


I think it should even be
{{{
sage: N.random_element(10) in M
True   # not False!
}}}
because, if I understand correctly,  there is a coercion from N to M -- see point 1.

I am now running {{{make ptestlong}}}, and will then have a closer look at the code - so, no review yet. But I think you should address the points above.

I have fixed as many of these as I could find (probably all of them, but let me know if there are more issues).

Indeed; I have found that my installation of sage fails some long doctests even before the patches are applied, so I will have to do a fresh installation before I can test this myself properly.

Also, I had some time to kill so I've added support for the double bracket method, and this is included in the documentation.
{{{
sage: ZZ[['s,t,u']]
Multivariate Power Series Ring in s, t, u over Integer Ring
}}}

Finally, with a little more free time I added support for {{{exponents}}} and a basic version of the verschiebung, {{{V}}}.  These were among the pile of not-yet-implemented methods inherited from univariate power series.

It is originally stated on this ticket that "one also needs the patches at #9457 and #9443". Did you take this into account?

The purpose of #9443 is to make `is_integral_domain` accept optional arguments, and this should solve the problem. Therefore, I switch back to "needs review".

The code looks good modulo some tiny issues:

* I'll attach a referee patch in a sec which improves the Sphinx typesetting slightly
* I'm not happy about the docstring "This function works, but doesn't get called when it should." Either the function should get removed or the problem fixed.

Modulo those I give this patch a positive review.

Attachment [trac_1956_multi_power_series_new_2.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket1956/trac_1956_multi_power_series_new_2.patch) by @nilesjohnson created at 2010-09-16 17:29:42

Ok, the latest patch [attachment:trac_1956_multi_power_series_new_2.patch] passes all tests in the `sage/rings` directory, so I'm uploading it and starting `ptestlong`.

At this point, I'd like to start thinking that any other limitations of this patch should be filed under a new ticket, but we'll see what comes up.

I think there are still some problems with this.  For example:

1. Pickling does not work for these objects -- one needs to define a proper !__reduce!__ method. 

2. I don't think we should continue the use of !__ attributes as they just cause problems.  For example, the code in here has to set attributes like _PowerSeriesRing_generic!__power_series_class in subclasses.

3. There are formating issues in some of the docstrings like '_latex_'

4. We shouldn't have a 'MPowerSeriesRing' -- that functionality should just be in PowerSeriesRing.  MPolynomialRing was deprecated for the same reason a long time ago.

done now; patch forthcoming.

The use of `__` attributes here is modeled after their use (for better or worse) in `PowerSeriesRing_generic` (see 4. below); it is also in keeping with the python philosophy, that `__` attributes or methods may be removed or changed in future versions.  It is entirely possible that someone will eventually want to significantly rework multi/univariate power series.  Having said that, they can be removed without too much trouble if sage development policy is strongly against them (in this case, perhaps the developer guide should mention it clearly somewhere).

`_latex_` is fixed now, and I looked for other problems but didn't see any; my best known method for checking docstring formatting is using `sage -docbuild`, which only shows warnings/errors for non-underscore methods . . . can you recommend a better way?

>

I agree, but I think that issue is beyond the scope of this ticket.  Implementing multivariate power series arithmetic is already long and complex enough, without having to also worry about integrating them with the univariate power series code (which is heavily specialized for the single-variable case).  I have spent time thinking about how to do this, and I think it will be a subtle problem to solve; there is a sizable body of code that depends on `PowerSeriesRing` as it stands, and one will have to be careful about extending its functionality without breaking any of the current uses.  So I suggest that we merge this ticket and then open a new ticket for *Unify construction of uni- and multi-variate power series rings, as has been done for polynomial rings*.

It would probably be good if the other people involved in this ticket could comment on this last point.

For what it's worth, here is the specific issue I'm stuck on: `PowerSeries` allows the argument `default_prec` to be specified using either the first or second position:

```
sage: T = PowerSeriesRing(QQ,'t',3)
sage: T.default_prec()
3

sage: T = PowerSeriesRing(QQ,3,names='t')
sage: T.default_prec()
3
sage: T.variable_name()
't'
```

So what's the best way to preserve this functionality, but also allow creation of multivariate power series using the same (or similar) syntax as `PolynomialRing` uses? e.g.

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ,3,'r'); R
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in r0, r1, r2 over Rational Field
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ,'r',3); R
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in r0, r1, r2 over Rational Field
```

Note, on the other hand, that the following give errors:

```
sage: T = PowerSeriesRing(QQ,3,'t')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: first letter of variable name must be a letter

sage: T = PowerSeriesRing(QQ,3,name='t')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: PowerSeriesRing() got multiple values for keyword argument 'name'
```

To me, it seems that the current behavior (assuming integer arguments are meant to be `default_prec`) should be deprecated, and the allowed syntax of `PowerSeriesRing` should mirror that of `PolynomialRing`.


Oh, I just realized what I should try:  Make `PowerSeriesRing(QQ,3,'t')` and `PowerSeriesRing(QQ,'t,u,v')` create multivariate power series rings, and raise deprecation warnings in the other cases (as long as the rest of sage doesn't depend too heavily on this behavior); then `MPowerSeriesRing` never has to exist, `PowerSeriesRing` will sort of work as expected, and eventually it can be brought properly in line with `PolynomialRing`.  How does that sound to other people here?

Ok, I've attached a new patch which carries out the plan above.  After running doctests, it seems that there is a non-trivial body of code (elliptic curves, and maybe p-adics) that makes use of the syntax

```
T = PowerSeriesRing(QQ,'t',3)
```

or

```
T.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ,3)
```

to construct univariate power series rings.  I will mention this and a few other things in a new ticket for merging univariate and multivariate power series rings.

This new patch passes all doctests (with -long), and documentation builds cleanly, looks good.

You are right, I cannot reproduce my problem. As instructed above, I can indeed apply the patch cleanly.

Some more comments (I'm really not the best person to review this code):

Here are some performance figures:

```python
sage: R.<t,u,v> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ); R
Multivariate Power Series Ring in t, u, v over Rational Field
sage: f = R.random_element(prec=20,bound=20)
sage: fp = f.polynomial()
sage: %timeit f^2 # power series
125 loops, best of 3: 2.89 ms per loop

sage: %timeit fp^2 # polynomials
625 loops, best of 3: 82.4 µs per loop

sage: R.<t,u,v> = PowerSeriesRing(GF(127)); R
Multivariate Power Series Ring in t, u, v over Finite Field of size 127
sage: f = R.random_element(prec=20,bound=20)
sage: fp = f.polynomial()

sage: %timeit f^2 # power series
625 loops, best of 3: 1.06 ms per loop

sage: %timeit fp^2 # polynomials
625 loops, best of 3: 15.3 µs per loop
```

I also noticed that this is rather slow:

```python
sage: sage: R.<t,u,v> = PowerSeriesRing(GF(127)); R
Multivariate Power Series Ring in t, u, v over Finite Field of size 127
sage: f = R.random_element(prec=20,bound=20)
sage: p = f.polynomial()
sage: fp = f.polynomial()
sage: %timeit R(fp)
25 loops, best of 3: 11.1 ms per loop
```

Conversion to Magma didn't seem to work at all, or am I doing it wrong?

```python
sage: magma(f)
In file "/home/malb/.sage//temp/road/7093//interface//tmp7130", line 1, column 16:

sage: f = R.random_element(prec=20,bound=20)
sage: fp = f.polynomial()

125 loops, best of 3: 2.67 ms per loop

sage: %timeit fp^2 # polynomials
625 loops, best of 3: 52.3 µs per loop
```

The arithmetic is done in a univariate power series ring over a multivariate power series ring (called the "background ring" in the code):

```
sage: R._bg_ps_ring()
Power Series Ring in T over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in t, u, v over Rational Field
sage: fb = f._bg_value
sage: %timeit fb^2
125 loops, best of 3: 2.61 ms per loop
```

So the speed is a limitation of univariate power series rings over multivariate polynomial rings . . .

```
sage: R.<t,u,v> = PowerSeriesRing(GF(127)); R
Multivariate Power Series Ring in t, u, v over Finite Field of size 127
sage: f = R.random_element(prec=20,bound=20)
sage: fp = f.polynomial()

sage: %timeit f^2 # power series
625 loops, best of 3: 1.48 ms per loop

sage: %timeit fp^2 # polynomials
625 loops, best of 3: 20.8 µs per loop

sage: fb = f._bg_value # univariate power series over multivariate polynomials
sage: %timeit fb^2
625 loops, best of 3: 1.42 ms per loop
```

## Timings for ``f**(2**n)`` v.s. iterated square-and-truncate for ``fp**(2**n)``

Here is a simple special case:  for a power series `f` with non-zero constant coefficient, the total-degree precision of `f**k` is equal to the total-degree precision of `f` for all `k`.  Below is a function which uses polynomial arithmetic to compute coefficients of `fp**k` up to given total degree for `k = 2^n`, where `fp = f.polynomial()`.

```
sage: def tot_deg_truncate(g,d):
    return sum(g.monomial_coefficient(m)*m for m in [x for x in g.monomials() if x.degree() < d])
....: 

sage: def pow_recursive(g,k,d):
    if k == 2:
        return tot_deg_truncate(g**2,d)
    else:
        return pow_recursive(tot_deg_truncate(g**2,d),k/2,d)
....:     

sage: R = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ,4,'t')
sage: f = 1 + R.random_element(prec=10,bound=20)
sage: f.constant_coefficient()
1
sage: fp = f.polynomial()
```

Check that ``pow_recursive`` gets the right answer:

```
sage: f**16 - pow_recursive(fp,16,10)
0 + O(t0, t1, t2, t3)^10
sage: f**64 - pow_recursive(fp,64,10)
0 + O(t0, t1, t2, t3)^10
```

Compare timings; although the polynomial arithmetic is faster, they are on roughly the same order of magnitude.

```
sage: %timeit f**16
125 loops, best of 3: 4.8 ms per loop
sage: %timeit pow_recursive(fp,16,10)
625 loops, best of 3: 1.18 ms per loop

sage: %timeit f**64
125 loops, best of 3: 7.21 ms per loop
sage: %timeit pow_recursive(fp,64,10)
125 loops, best of 3: 1.76 ms per loop
```

Increasing the precision exaggerates the difference:

```
sage: f = 1 + R.random_element(prec=30,bound=20)
sage: f.constant_coefficient()
1
sage: fp = f.polynomial()
sage: f**16 - pow_recursive(fp,16,30)
0 + O(t0, t1, t2, t3)^30
sage: f**64 - pow_recursive(fp,64,30)
0 + O(t0, t1, t2, t3)^30

sage: %timeit f**16
25 loops, best of 3: 15.9 ms per loop
sage: %timeit pow_recursive(fp,16,30)
125 loops, best of 3: 1.81 ms per loop

sage: %timeit f**64
25 loops, best of 3: 23.9 ms per loop
sage: %timeit pow_recursive(fp,64,30)
125 loops, best of 3: 2.65 ms per loop
```

Looking with my eyes... I found one bug not mentioned or fixed elsewhere:

```
733	        except TypeError,AttributeError:
```
This should be

```
733	        except (TypeError,AttributeError):
```
otherwise, AttributeError gets *set* to the string that the TypeError raises.  Do check for other cases of this issue in the code. 

This scares me a little:

```
raise TypeError("action of "+c.parent()+" on "+f.parent()+" not defined.")
```
the reason is that any exception such that constructing a string as part of it could take time, can potentially *MASSIVELY* slow down Sage.   Just do:

```
raise TypeError
```
or

```
raise TypeError, "action not defined"
```
instead.  Since otherwise, constructing that string might dominate arithmetic... (the coercion model will try to do the arithmetic, get the error, then try something else).   Also, it is easy enough using "%debug" to see what all the relevant variables are when one gets an exception.

I see this also

```
 	1062	            except: 
```
I am against using naked excepts unless their is a very good reason to do so.

I also think that whenever possible all the inputs to a function should be documented.  For example look at this one:

```
109	109	    def completion(self, p, prec=20, extras=None): 
 	110	        """ 
 	111	        Return the completion of self with respect to the ideal generated 
 	112	        by the variable(s) ``p``. 
 	113	 
 	114	        INPUT: 
 	115	 
 	116	        - ``p`` -- variable or tuple of variables 
 	117	 
 	118	        EXAMPLES:: 
```

I think prec and extras should be documented.  Especially important is "extras", since that is not self-explanatory at all.  There is also a function `def solve_linear_de(self, prec = infinity, b=None, f0=None): ` with no docs on its input.  Since it just does `raise NotImplementedError` I think that's fine. 

I don't like all this "type(obj)==type" stuff.  I think isinstance(obj,type) is much better:

```
        140	        if p in self or type(p) == str and set(p).issubset(set([str(g) for g in self.gens()])): 
 	141	            p = tuple([p]) 
 	142	        elif type(p) == list or type(p) == tuple: 
```

This has been fixed, and I've checked every occurrence of "raise ..." for similar problems (there are quite a few, since I've never heard of %debug, or pdb, until now -- perhaps this would be a useful addition to the developer's guide)

There were two naked excepts; in both cases the code has been rewritten to avoid them.

I've double-checked all functions now; the example you gave was one of the toughest because I was modifying an existing function (from the multivariate polynomial code).  In any case, it's fixed now.

Hi,

  Using it multiplication in the multivariate power series implemented here
  should also be much faster,

Applying only trac_10480_fast_PowerSeries_poly_multiplication2.patch, not
trac_1956_faster_MPowerSeries_mul.patch, MPowerSeries._mul_ uses
univariate series multiplication, which uses the do_mul_trunc algorithm
instead of the do_mul_trunc_generic algorithm; the latter is slower
than the unpatched version in some test in un.sage in #10480,
while the former is always faster.
The latter algorithm is always faster than main in the tests above,
and most of the times a few times faster than the former algorithm, so
it seems a better choice for multivariate series.


With this patch _send_to_bg and _send_to_fg are faster; using
the attached benchmark file bg.sage,
n=number of variables, h=precision, N=100 random polynomials,
bg=_send_to_bg, fg=_send_to_fg

```

Multivariate series in one variable differ from univariate series;
is it the intended behaviour?

```
sage: R = PowerSeriesRing(GF(127),'t');R
Power Series Ring in t over Finite Field of size 127
sage: %timeit R.random_element(100)
625 loops, best of 3: 856 µs per loop
sage: K = PowerSeriesRing(GF(127),1,'a'); K
Multivariate Power Series Ring in a over Finite Field of size 127
sage: %timeit K.random_element(100)
5 loops, best of 3: 146 ms per loop
```

I noticed this since
the patch trac_1956_faster_MPowerSeries_mul.patch does not work in this
case, because _send_to_bg calls the degrees method

```
sage: %timeit K.random_element(100)
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_zmod_flint.Polynomial_zmod_flint' object has no attribute 'degrees'
```

If multivariate series in one variable are meant to differ from 
univariate series I will modify _send_to_bg to deal with this case.

I don't know whether it is intended, but I'd like to mention that there already is a difference between univariate polynomials and multivariate polynomials in one variable:

```
sage: R_uni = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x')
sage: R_uni
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: R_multi = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',1)
sage: R_multi
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: timeit('a = R_uni.random_element()')
625 loops, best of 3: 48.4 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit('a = R_multi.random_element()')
625 loops, best of 3: 192 Âµs per loop
sage: a = R_uni.random_element()
sage: b = R_multi(a)
sage: a.leading_coefficient()
-27
sage: hasattr(b,'leading_coefficient')
False
sage: b.lc()
-27
sage: hasattr(a,'lc')
False
```

While it is clear that there is a difference in the timings for `random_element`, I don't like that the names are different for methods that do essentially the same.

Things are different in the case of `degrees` (which exists only for multivariate polynomials). Since the word is plural (it denotes the tuple of maximal exponents of each variable, not necessarily occuring in a single monomial), it doesn't really make sense in the univariate case. However, I do think that in that case (and similar cases) there should be a method of univariate polynomials emulating the corresponding method for multivariate polynomials with one variable.

So, I don't mind about the different timings; but I think methods should be more or less equivalent.

I think that the top-level constructors `PolynomialRing` and `PowerSeriesRing` should return univariate rings instead of multivariate rings in one variable.  It is difficult to imagine a situation where someone would want access to the "multivariate in one variable" versions (e.g. they want to use some algorithm implemented for the multivariate case that is not available in the univariate case), and even more difficult to imagine that this is the preferred option of most users.  Someone who does need this functionality can still import the multivariate constructor directly.

With [attachment:trac_1956_one_variable_fix.patch] we have:

```
sage: PowerSeriesRing(QQ,1,'a')
Power Series Ring in a over Rational Field

sage: PowerSeriesRing(QQ,1,'a') is PowerSeriesRing(QQ,'a')
True
```

```
sage: from sage.rings.multi_power_series_ring import MPowerSeriesRing_generic
sage: MPowerSeriesRing_generic(QQ,1,'a')
Multivariate Power Series Ring in a over Rational Field
```

Unless someone here can think of a compelling reason to reverse this change, I think we should also open a new ticket for the polynomial case.  In a related vein, we also have polynomial rings in no variables, and these are different from the base ring:

```
sage: PolynomialRing(ZZ,'a',0)
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in no variables over Integer Ring
sage: PolynomialRing(ZZ,'a',0) is ZZ
False
```

For consistency, I've implemented the same behavior for power series rings:

```
sage: PowerSeriesRing(QQ,0,'a')
Multivariate Power Series Ring in no variables over Rational Field
```

Perhaps these should both simply return the base ring -- I'm not so sure, but in any case I hope it can be handled for both polynomials and power series in a separate ticket.

It already does:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: R
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: R2.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: R2
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```

Only when you explicitly request it, you'll get a multivariate ring with one variable:

```
sage: R3.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ,1)
sage: R3
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```

> It is difficult to imagine a situation where someone would want access to the "multivariate in one variable" versions


I find it very easy to imagine. I sometimes want it so, because multi- and univariate polynomials have different methods, and thus I want to make sure that my programs will always get a *multi*variate polynomial.

> (e.g. they want to use some algorithm implemented for the multivariate case that is not available in the univariate case), and even more difficult to imagine that this is the preferred option of most users.


Agreed, and this is why the polynomial ring constructor returns a univariate ring, unless requested otherwise (in contrast to your claim).

>  Someone who does need this functionality can still import the multivariate constructor directly.


No, one shouldn't, it is deprecated:

```
sage: MPolynomialRing(QQ,1,'a')
/mnt/local/king/SAGE/sage-4.6/local/bin/sage-ipython:1: DeprecationWarning: MPolynomialRing is deprecated, use PolynomialRing instead!
  #!/usr/bin/env python
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a over Rational Field
```

Instead, one should choose the arguments of the polynomial ring contructor appropriately (as I did above).

I am strongly -1 to that suggestion, because the user must have the possibility to choose the implementation by providing appropriate arguments (with the argument `1` versus without it).
 
> ```

Using a non-generic constructor should be deprecated, IMO.

I don't know if you find my argument compelling, but I am strongly against that suggestion.

That's fine.

> Perhaps these should both simply return the base ring -- 


No! The user has *explicitly* requested a polynomial ring. So, s/he *must not* get the base ring in return, since s/he may rely on particular methods that may only be implemented for polynomial rings, but not for general rings.

Thanks for this -- actually I find your arguments here quite compelling.  I was thinking before that arithmetic for univariate power series and polynomials are probably optimized for that case, and so would be preferable to the "multivariate in one variable" algorithms.  But I neglected, as you have pointed out, that one might want to write code which, for simplicity, treats univariate and multivariate rings the same and thus depends on the methods written for multivariate rings.  This would be especially likely if the code one were writing didn't depend on the optimal univariate algorithms.

Of course this is precisely not the case for pernici and others who are working on faster multiplication algorithms.  Pernici, does this seem reasonable to you?  How difficult will it be for you to treat the "multivariate in one variable" case?

Sure univariate rings are usually preferable! I do think that most users could care less about the different methods of univariate and singly multivariate polynomials - they want speed!

I did not suggest that *by default* the polynomial ring (or power series ring) constructor should return a multivariate ring in one variable. I do think that

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[[]]
```
should turn `R` into a univariate ring.

What I was trying to explain was: The user must be able to override the default implementation by passing appropriate arguments to the ring constructor. Hence: `PowerSeriesRing(QQ,'x')` should return the default (a univariate ring), but `PowerSeriesRing(QQ,1,'x')` should return a multivariate ring.

In other words: I suggest that you just mimmick the current behaviour of th polynomial ring constructor.

Cheers,
Simon

Good--that's the behavior without the "one variable fix" patch :)

This morning I had an idea for helping this code get reviewed (note that the ticket turns 4 at the end of this month):  Could we break the review process into several manageable pieces, and have different people take responsibility for different parts?  For example, I'd propose something like the following:

1. The underlying concept of the implementation (foreground ring & background ring, etc.)
2. Documentation and tests
3. `multi_power_series_ring.py`: the code accurately does what it claims to do
4. `multi_power_series_ring_element.py`: the code accurately does what it claims to do
5. Integration with the rest of sage: construction and use of `PowerSeriesRings` works correctly, and parallels behavior of polynomial rings
6. Completeness of the review:  do these pieces give an essentially complete breakdown of the review?

I think that random_element does not give good random multivariate series;
the lowest total degree is usually not zero

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[[]]
sage: def mval(p,N):
....:     print '%.2f' % (sum([sum(R.random_element(p,p).exponents()[0]) for _ in range(N)])/float(N))
....:
sage: mval(20,100)
3.94
sage: mval(100,100)
8.34
```

while in the univariate case it is usually zero

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[[]]
sage: def mval(p,N):                                                             
....:     print '%.2f' % (sum([R.random_element(p,p).exponents()[0] for _ in range(N)])/float(N))
....:
sage: mval(20,100)
0.02
sage: mval(100,100)
0.01
```

As a quick fix to get pseudo random series I changed the benchmark file mu.sage 
shifting by 1 the variables in the random polynomials

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[[]]        
sage: for prec in range(10,50,10):
....:     p = R.random_element(prec,prec)
....:     p1 = p.polynomial()(x+1,y+1) + R.O(prec)

This is a follow-up of my previous mail on random_element
in multivariate series.

`R.random_element` calls `R.__poly_ring.random_element`.
From the documentation of `MPolynomialRing_generic.random_element`:

`First monomials are chosen uniformly random from the set of all
possible monomials of degree up to `d` (inclusive). This means
that it is more likely that a monomial of degree `d` appears than
a monomial of degree `d-1` because the former class is bigger.`

This argument is relevant also for multivariate series

```
sage: R.<a,b,c,d> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ,4)
sage: p = (1 + a + 2*b + 3*c + 4*d + R(0).O(16))^-5

sage: [len(x.exponents()) for x in p._bg_value]
[1, 4, 10, 20, 35, 56, 84, 120, 165, 220, 286, 364, 455, 560, 680, 816]
```
There are many more terms with high degrees for the reason
given in the quote.

Take a random series of comparable length

```
sage: p1 = R.random_element(16,4000)
sage: [len(x.exponents()) for x in p1._bg_value]
[0, 4, 3, 13, 22, 44, 54, 75, 114, 150, 190, 236, 307, 371, 440, 554]
```
The distribution is fairly similar.

However taking `bound` small in R.random_element(prec,bound)
the lowest total degree is high

```
sage: p1 = R.random_element(16)
sage: [len(x.exponents()) for x in p1._bg_value]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
sage: p1 = R.random_element(16,16)
sage: [len(x.exponents()) for x in p1._bg_value]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 3, 0, 2]
```

With a high number of variables the situation gets worse;
to get series starting with small lowest total degree
`bound` should be extremely high

```
sage: R = PowerSeriesRing(QQ,100,'t')
sage: p = R.random_element(10,100); sum(p.exponents()[0])
9
sage: p = R.random_element(10,1000); sum(p.exponents()[0])
7
sage: p = R.random_element(10,10000); sum(p.exponents()[0])
7
```
In power series with finite precision `prec`
lower degrees are more important than higher degrees;
if this were not so it would not make sense to throw away terms
with degree higher than prec-1. So I think that lower degrees
should weight more than high degrees in the choice of random
elements.

Hi pernici,

Thanks for clarifying this, but I'm not sure how to proceed.  I think I understand what you mean about lower degree terms being "more important" (in the same way that earlier decimal digits are "more important" in a real number).  But I also think it makes a lot of sense for `random_element` to be very similar between multivariate polynomials and multivariate power series -- this is the principle behind a number of implementation choices for multivariate power series.  Nowhere is it promised that `random_element`s are chosen with uniform distribution and, as you point out, the docstring for multivariate polynomials says explicitly that it is using a non-uniform distribution.

So now I wonder what the motivation is for changing the power series `random_element` method:  am I right to guess that you want to use the random elements to test your multiplication code?  If so, let me suggest that it would be better to do this with a [test suite](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/misc/sage_unittest.html), where you can write different custom algorithms for different random distributions and not have to worry about which of these should used for the `random_element` method of polynomials or power series.  (Having said that, I admit that I've found it difficult to get started with sage's test suite classes.  I think there are some implementations for general rings and for integrals, so these might be good examples to follow if you want. )

Or maybe you have a different reason to think about `random_element`?

best,
Niles

Hi Niles,
I agree that it has some advantages to keep the same random_element as for polynomials;
at least it is well defined mathematically in terms of sets of monomials.

>am I right to guess that you want to use the random elements to test your multiplication code? 


Yes, my motivation for using random polynomials was for benchmarking multiplication;
when I found out that random_element generates typically series without low order terms
I replaced it with a generator which gave them.

>Or maybe you have a different reason to think about random_element? 

No.

In this ticket series with total degree truncation are considered. 

How does the case of partial degree truncation work, 
say with `p` a polynomial

```
f = p + O(x^prec_x,y^prec_y)
```
Can one define the partial degree truncation as the total degree truncation with
`prec = prec1+prec2-1`, and if `f._bg_value` has valuation `0` truncate 
`x^prec_x and y^prec_y` ?

With such a definition multiplication would work as in the total degree case, with a truncation of the result, if needed.

Please disregard my previous message :(

In this ticket series with total degree truncation are considered.

I would like to ask how the case of series with partial degree truncation works.

Consider for example the product of two series in variables `x,y`
with precisions `prec_x,prec_y`; if they start with a constant term one can
just truncate with `O(x^prec_x) , O(y^prec_y)`.

I do not see how it works if there are no constant terms; consider for example
two series with precision 3 in both variables; add a variable `b` to track
the monomials which should be eliminated

```
sage: R.<x,y,b> = QQ[]
sage: p1 = x + y + x^2 + x*y + y^2 + b*(x^3 + y^3)
sage: p2 = x^2 + x*y + y^2 + b*(x^3 + y^3)
sage: p3 = p1*p2
sage: p3.coefficient({b:0})
x^4 + 2*x^3*y + 3*x^2*y^2 + 2*x*y^3 + y^4 + x^3 + 2*x^2*y + 2*x*y^2 + y^3
sage: p3.coefficient({b:1})
2*x^5 + 2*x^4*y + 2*x^3*y^2 + 2*x^2*y^3 + 2*x*y^4 + 2*y^5 + x^4 + x^3*y + x*y^3 + y^4
```

`x^4, x^3*y, x*y^3, y^4` appear in `p3.coefficient({b:1})`
so they should be disregarded; the product of the series should be

```
3*x^2*y^2 + x^3 + 2*x^2*y + 2*x*y^2 + y^3
```
but I do not see how to get this simply with truncations;
neglecting `3*x<sup>2*y</sup>2` one would get the total degree truncation

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[[]]
sage: p1 = x + y + x^2 + x*y + y^2 + R.O(3)
sage: p2 = x^2 + x*y + y^2 + R.O(3)
sage: p1*p2
x^3 + 2*x^2*y + 2*x*y^2 + y^3 + O(x, y)^4
```

attached patch to be applied after
applying trac_1956_multi_power_series_new_4.patch,
trac_1956_uni_multi_ps_2.patch,
trac_1956_multi_ps_cleanup.patch

The univariate series has the property that its representation
can be used to define it

```
sage: S.<t> = QQ[[]]
sage: 1 + t + t^3 + O(t^5)
1 + t + t^3 + O(t^5)
```
In the case of multivariate series this property does not currently hold

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[[]]
sage: p = 1 + x + y^2 + R.O(5); p
1 + x + y^2 + O(x, y)^5
sage: 1 + x + y^2 + O(x, y)^5
TypeError
```
The attached patch is a hack to satisfy this property

```

I get some strange behaviour; I want to use the reduce method for a
polynomial extracted from a multivariate series

```
sage: S.<x,y> = QQ[[]]
sage: p = (1+x+y)^3
sage: pp = p.polynomial()
sage: R = S._poly_ring()
sage: xv = R.gens()
sage: pp.reduce([xv[0]^2,xv[1]^2])
1
```

while the expected behavior is as working directly with polynomials

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: p = (1+x+y)^3
sage: p.reduce([x^2,y^2])
6*x*y + 3*x + 3*y + 1
```

After some trials I got the expected result by creating a new ring 
and casting the polynomial with it.

```
sage: S.<x,y> = QQ[[]]
sage: p = (1+x+y)^3
sage: pp = p.polynomial()
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ,S.variable_names())
sage: xv = R.gens()
sage: pp = R(pp)
sage: pp.reduce([xv[0]^2,xv[1]^2])
6*x*y + 3*x + 3*y + 1
```

This is unsatisfactory because it should not be necessary to introduce
a new MPolynomial_libsingular ring, and cast the polynomial.

Am I doing something wrong or is there a bug?

Sorry, there is no problem; the default ordering for multivariate series in `negdeglex`,
while the default ordering of `PolynomialRing` is `degrevlex`, so that 
`reduce` acts differently in the two cases.

The method sqrt of MPowerSeries does not work because sqrt does not
currently work for series on polynomial rings.

In ticket #10720 nth_root is added;
applying trac_10720_power_series_nth_root_2.patch

the definition of nth_root for MPowerSeries is

```
sage: def nth_root(self, n):
....:     return self.parent(self._bg_value.nth_root(n))
....:
```

Examples:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[[]]
sage: p = 1 + 2*x + 3*y + R.O(20)
sage: nth_root(p^10,2) - p^5
0 + O(x, y)^20
sage: nth_root(p^10,5) - p^2
0 + O(x, y)^20
sage: nth_root(p^-10,2) - p^-5
0 + O(x, y)^20
sage: nth_root(p^-10,5) - p^-2
0 + O(x, y)^20

Niles,
going back to the benchmarks you posted in ticket #1956 (see also bench1.sage
posted here), here is a comparison with PARI

```
(2)  latest patch in this ticket
(3)  PARI/GP
times in ms
test no.  1     2     3     4     5     6     7      8
(2)       28.2  2.3   24.8  166   8.16  21    45.2   56.7
(3)       27.8  20    19.7  94.4  16    43.2  47.2   48
```
PARI ranges from 8.7x slower to 1.8x faster; it is slowest in the
second example; the timings for (3) fluctuate a lot, unlike those of (2);
above I gave the first timings I got.

I took a few times the timings for (3) in the second example

```
sage: %timeit gp('(1 + T^3*(a^3 + b^3) + T^4*(c^4 + d^4) + O(T^(15)))^-20')
25 loops, best of 3: 17.3 ms per loop
```
I got timings from 14 ms to 23 ms, while I get regularly 2.3 ms for (2)

```
sage: L.<a,b,c,d> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ,4)
sage: %timeit (1 + a^3 + b^3 + c^4 + d^4 + L.O(15))^-20
125 loops, best of 3: 2.3 ms per loop
```
even taking the best time for PARI in this example, it is still 6x slower.

I decided to make comparison with PARI/GP prompted by your post in ticket
#1956 about distributing the review of that ticket.

I thought that another item there could be:

comparison with other CAS

and so I tried the comparison with PARI.

IMHO this ticket could be closed: I consider settled that generic truncated
multiplication is faster than Karatsuba for multivariate series.
The comparison with PARI is fairly favorable; the latest patch is
from 6x faster to 2.5x slower than PARI/GP in the given benchmarks with
the QQ field, and it is generic code, working with any ring.

These benchmarks should help reviewers in settling the item:

Performance: the multivariate power series arithmetic is fast enough to be included in Sage

I think it is sound to use a background univariate series
to implement total degree precision.

Concerning the 6th item (integration with the rest of sage)
we should discuss what other approaches are available in Sage to deal with
multivariate series.

Another approach to multivariate series is using series of series;
this can be done with Sage's univariate power series or `gp`.

It is a bit cumbersome to convert a polynomial into a series of series with
Sage's univariate power series

```
sage: R.<x1> = QQ[[]]
sage: S.<x0> = R[[]]
sage: p = (1 + x0 + x1)^3
sage: a = p.list()
sage: q = sum((a[i] + O(x1^3))*x0^i for i in range(len(a))) + O(x0^3)
sage: q^-5
1 - 15*x1 + 120*x1^2 + O(x1^3) + (-15 + 240*x1 - 2040*x1^2 + O(x1^3))*x0 + (120 - 2040*x1 + 18360*x1^2 + O(x1^3))*x0^2 + O(x0^3)
sage: (q-1)^2
9*x1^2 + 18*x1^3 + O(x1^4) + (18*x1 + 54*x1^2 + O(x1^3))*x0 + (9 + 54*x1 + 90*x1^2 + O(x1^3))*x0^2 + O(x0^3)
```

Using `gp` the notation is simpler

```
sage: q = gp('(1+x0+x1)^3 + O(x0^3) + O(x1^3)')
```
giving the same output for `q^-5` and `(q-1)^2` .

For long computations `gp` is much faster, especially with more than two variables.

Should one integrate the multi-series multivariate series approach
with `PowerSeriesRing` ? It could be something like

```
sage: R = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, 2, 'x', "ms")
sage: q = (1 + x0 + x1)^3 + O(x0^3,x1^3)
sage: q
1 + 3*x1 + 3*x1^2 + O(x1^3) + (3 + 6*x1 + 3*x1^2 + O(x1^3))*x0 + (3 + 3*x1 + O(x1^3))*x0^2 + O(x0^3)
```

One could implement series of series with Sage's univariate power series,
or better using PARI.

Clearly implementing this does not belong to this ticket.
The only thing to be decided in this ticket is if it is OK to keep the
total degree precision as the default option in `PowerSeriesRing`.

With regard to "series of series", I believe there are some theoretical subtleties which make this tricky.  The [Pari User's Manual](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/manuals/2.3.3/users.pdf) contains the following warning (1.2.4, page 22):

>> In the present version 2.3.3 of PARI, there are bugs in the handling of power series of power series, i.e. power series in several variables. ... This bug is difficult to correct because the mathematical problem itself contains some amount of imprecision, and it is not easy to design an intuitive generic interface for such beasts.


So I think total-degree precision should be the the default, until someone writes code to carefully handle the other possibilities (or to call `gp` -- see the next point).

> For long computations gp is much faster, especially with more than two variables. 


Yes, a more complete interface with `gp` is probably the right way to go.  However I think `PowerSeriesRing`, and its elements, should be native Sage objects -- this is not the case with `gp` series, which makes them unsuitable for the default power series.  For example:

```
sage: q = gp('(1+x0+x1)^3 + O(x0^3) + O(x1^3)')
sage: type(q)
<class 'sage.interfaces.gp.GpElement'>
sage: q.parent()
PARI/GP interpreter
sage: q.base_ring()
PARI/GP interpreter
```

Maybe total-degree precision is a better default anyway, even if there were available an excellent multi-series (I mean series of series ... N times, I do not know the standard name for these _really_ multivariate series) implementation; I have the impression that few times multi-series are used, and that univariate series (which total-degree precision multivariate series really is) or at most bivariate series are used frequently in practice.

I do not have Magma; according to the timings in comment 8 it seems that in the first
benchmark Magma is 3 orders of magnitude slower.

I found this [http://wiki.sagemath.org/sagebeatsmagma](http://wiki.sagemath.org/sagebeatsmagma) ; such a benchmark could be added there.

First, thanks for all your work Niles, what you've done has already saved me hours of pain!

There seems to be a problem with how coercion/evaluation works between two multivariate power series rings when the number of variables in each differs.  For example:

```
sage: A.<a, b, c> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: B.<s, t> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: s(a, b)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    420             try:

    422             except AttributeError:

    356             elif xparent == parent._bg_ps_ring():

TypeError: Unable to coerce into background ring.
```
I would expect this to print `a`.  Similar permutations with `s^2`, `s + t`, etc. produce the same result.

Another problem, possibly related, is the following:

```
sage: B.<s, t> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: C.<z> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: s(z, z)  # expect z
1
sage: s(z, z^2)  # expect z
1
sage: s(0, z^2)  # expect 0
0
sage: s(z^2, 0)  # expect z^2
1
sage: (2*s^2)(z, z)  # expect 2*z^2
2
sage: (2*s^2 + 3*t)(z, z)  # expect 3*z + 2*z^2
5
sage: t(0, z)  # expect z
1
sage: t(z, z)  # expect z
1
sage: z(s + t) # expect s + t
s + t
sage: z(s)  # expect s
s
sage: z(t)  # expect t
t
```
Clearly `z` is being sent to 1 (one) somehow when going from `QQ[This is the Trac macro *s,t* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#s,t-macro)` to `QQ[This is the Trac macro *z* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#z-macro)`, but the maps in the other direction work fine.

Both of these problems (assuming they're distinct) disappear when one does the analogous calculations directly with multivariate *polynomial* rings.

Cheers, Hamish.

Actually it never occurred to me that people would want to substitute into a power series from one ring elements from a different ring, or that such behavior should be supported, but I can see now why it might be useful.  The problem is occurring in the `__call__` method of `MPowerSeries`, which assumes that the inputs should coerce to the parent of the power series they're being substituted into.  A separate part of the problem is that elements from one power series ring are incorrectly coercing to 1 in the other power series ring:

```
sage: B.<s, t> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: C.<z> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: B(z)
1
sage: C(s)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
TypeError: Unable to coerce s (<class 'sage.rings.multi_power_series_ring_element.MPowerSeries'>) to Rational
```

So I will have to figure out what is going wrong here.  In the meantime, if you need to actually use this, you can use `._value()` to recover the underlying multivariate polynomial, do the substitution there, and then `.add_bigoh()` to get a power series again.  The important idea is that the precision of the power series after substitution should be `n*v`, where `n` is the precision of the original power series, and `v` is the minimum of the valuations of the input power series.

Something smarter might be done by mimicking the `__call__` method of `MPolynomial_element`, but I haven't thought through that yet -- let me know if you do :)

> > There seems to be a problem with how coercion/evaluation works between two multivariate power series rings when the number of variables in each differs. 


I tracked down this bug -- it was unique to the case where one of the power series rings is univariate, and comes from the fact that (univariate) power series rings automatically convert any univariate power series from a given variable to another:

```
sage: R.<a> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)sage: S.<b> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: b in R
False
sage: R.has_coerce_map_from(S)
False
sage: R(b)
a
```

I was thinking this should be filed as a separate bug, but polynomials have the same behavior, so perhaps it is intentional.  In any case, I've fixed multivariate power series to take this into account, so an error is raised when the variables don't match:

```
sage: B.<s, t> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: C.<z> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: B(z)
...
TypeError: Cannot coerce input to polynomial ring.
```

> > Another problem, possibly related, is the following...


I also implemented a `._subs_formal` method, which is called automatically by `.__call__`.  This method substitutes *anything* into the power series, requiring only that multiplication and exponentiation be defined for the inputs.  This gives all of the "expected" results from above.  Some further examples (from the new doctests):

```
sage: B.<s, t> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: C.<z> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: s(z,z)
z

sage: f = -2/33*s*t^2 - 1/5*t^5 - s^5*t + s^2*t^4
sage: f(z,z)
-2/33*z^3 - 1/5*z^5
sage: f(z,1)
-1/5 - 2/33*z + z^2 - z^5
sage: RF = RealField(10)
sage: f(z,RF(1))
-0.20 - 0.061*z + 1.0*z^2 - 0.00*z^3 - 0.00*z^4 - 1.0*z^5

sage: m = matrix(QQ,[[1,0,1],[0,2,1],[-1,0,0]])
sage: m
[ 1  0  1]
[ 0  2  1]
[-1  0  0]
sage: f(m,m)
[     2/33         0       1/5]
[   131/55 -1136/165    -24/11]
[     -1/5         0   -23/165]
sage: f(m,m) == -2/33*m^3 - 1/5*m^5
True

sage: f = f.add_bigoh(10)
sage: f(z,z)
-2/33*z^3 - 1/5*z^5 + O(z^10)
sage: f(m,m) # cannot substitute arbitrary elements when f has finite precision
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'sage.matrix.matrix_rational_dense.Matrix_rational_dense' object has no attribute 'add_bigoh'
```

Please test it out and let me know how it goes!

I think the buildbot gets confused by the "Apply" instruction in the ticket's description. Hence, it didn't run the big patch yet.

> error or warning (needs review)


**needs work**

```
sage -coverage devel/sage/sage/rings/multi_power_series_ring.py 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
devel/sage/sage/rings/multi_power_series_ring.py
SCORE devel/sage/sage/rings/multi_power_series_ring.py: 96% (30 of 31)

Missing documentation:
         * unpickle_multi_power_series_ring_v0(base_ring, num_gens, names, order, default_prec, sparse):
```

These just need `#indirect doctest` added:

```
sage -coverage devel/sage/sage/rings/multi_power_series_ring_element.py 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
devel/sage/sage/rings/multi_power_series_ring_element.py
SCORE devel/sage/sage/rings/multi_power_series_ring_element.py: 100% (52 of 52)

Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):
         * _subs_formal(self,*x,**kwds):
         * _add_(left, right):
         * _sub_(left, right):

         * _div_(self, denom_r):

```

But the docs build without warnings etc.

Shouldn't `def _element_constructor_(self,f)` use the default precision of the ring?

**needs work**

The `default_prec` parameter does not seem to work as expected (or is my expectation wrong?)

```python
sage: P.<x,y> = PowerSeriesRing(GF(127),default_prec=20)
sage: x.prec()
+Infinity
```

If the performance is good (7), then I think we can just assume it's okay. We can always come back and fix stuff later which is too slow.

I have to say that I don't like the excessive use of double underscore attributes. It makes it harder to inherit from it or reach into the internals (just as you have to write `_PowerSeriesRing_generic__poly_ring`) I'd just use a single underscore. I'll leave it up to you (i.e., not make my review dependent on it) whether you insist on keeping them.

Fine by me.

No, I believe not.  Default precision is used only when absolutely necessary to convert an infinite precision element to a finite precision one (e.g. for inversion or reversion).  But, for example, coercion of a polynomial should result in an infinite precision element, not a finite precision one.  This is consistent with the behavior of univariate power series rings:

sage: P = QQ[x]; P
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field

sage: S = P.completion(P.gen()); S
Power Series Ring in x over Rational Field

sage: S(P.random_element()).prec()
+Infinity
```

```
sage: P = QQ['x,y,z']; P
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field

sage: S = P.completion(P.gens()); S
Multivariate Power Series Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field

sage: S(P.random_element()).prec()

I believe that your expectation is wrong, as described above.  Note the parallel behavior for univariate power series rings:

```
sage: P.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(GF(127),default_prec=20)
sage: x.prec()
+Infinity

Excessive or not, each of the double underscore methods is necessary to replace the corresponding method of `PowerSeries` or `PowerSeriesRing_generic`, from which the `MPowerSeries*` classes inherit.  Here's a complete list of the double underscore attributes:

```
MPowerSeries.__init__
MPowerSeries.__reduce__
MPowerSeries.__call__
MPowerSeries.__getitem__
MPowerSeries.__invert__
MPowerSeries.__cmp__
MPowerSeries.__mod__
MPowerSeries.__lshift__
MPowerSeries.__rshift__

MPowerSeriesRing_generic.__init__
MPowerSeriesRing_generic.__reduce__
MPowerSeriesRing_generic.__cmp__

Ah, I agree.  This came up once before (perhaps with you, or with Simon), and indeed I've eliminated the unnecessary double underscore attributes.  Those listed above are the only ones remaining.

Now that I've looked carefully at these, and read documents like [PEP 8 style guide](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) about double underscore attributes, I think I'm inclined to leave them as is.  There are three contributing reasons: consistency with multivariate polynomial rings, consistency with univariate power series rings, and not wanting the background power series ring to be treated casually.

Here is the list of the double underscore attributes of `MPowerSeriesRing_generic` :

* Those which parallel multivariate polynomials:

  ```
__term_order
__ngens
```

* Those which parallel univariate power series:

  ```
__poly_ring
__is_sparse
__params
```

* Others, which I'd rather leave double-underscore for consistency with the rest and because I don't think the background ring should be treated casually:

  ```
__bg_power_series_ring
__bg_indeterminate
__base_ring
```

Why is there a `__base_ring` at all? The base ring is usually taken care of by inheritance of `sage.structure.parent.Parent` or other base classes. So, it should certainly be possible to work without a new attribute -- it seems to be a duplicate.
