NOTES:  The remarks below are enough to get Sage to 100% build on OSX 10.5, and *all doctests pass*. 


The only anomaly is that doctesting the tutorial results in a bunch of error messages like this:

```
python(15525) malloc: *** error for object 0xa023c6d8: Non-aligned pointer being freed
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
```

These don't cause any doctests to fail, and I observed this only for tut.tex (nothing else). 


This is a meta ticket:

* #1056: Givaro 3.2.6 build fix
* #1059: lcacl installation fix
* #1060: flintqs build fix
* #1061: python build fix

Keywords: **Leopard**

Component: **porting**

Some hacks / workarounds:

```
Crazy hacks to get things to build.  Will figure out right fixes once everything
works, etc.

These come from rpw, me, Mabshoff .

1) FLINT (william stein):
Problem -- Multiple symbols... --
Solution:
   comment out this one line 423 of local/include/gmp.h
/* #define __GMP_EXTERN_INLINE      extern __inline__ */

2) PYTHON (rpw):
Python fails to build:
Solution:
I did
   export CFLAGS="-D__DARWIN_UNIX03"
then in src/ manually did this line again after it failed:
gcc -fno-strict-aliasing -Wno-long-double -no-cpp-precomp -mno-fused-madd -DNDEBUG -g -O3 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes  -I. -I./Include   -DPy_BUILD_CORE  -c ./Modules/posixmodule.c -o Modules/posixmodule.o

Note that putting the above CFLAGS lines in spkg-install at the top or in the ./configure
line did *not* work for some reason.

3) GIVARO (rpw and mabshoff):
Problem: Fails to build.
Solution: Add #include "sys/types.h" to the top of
src/src/kernel/zpz/givzpz32std.inl
src/src/kernel/zpz/givzpz32uns.inl

```

4) Building clisp fails with 

  UNIX error 45: Operation not supported

SOLUTION: 

   cd spkg/build/clisp-*
   cd src/src
   make
   make install

It works.  The problem is that building tee'ing breaks on 10.5. See

The former was needed when we supported windows (e.g., lcalc.exe), and
was sort of hack-ish.  The latter works around that there is some 
small problem with strip on os x, which isn't an issue.

I've posted a pre-built version of Sage that was built on Leopard here:

http://sagemath.org/SAGEbin/apple_osx/intel/leopard/

This might be the optimal version of Sage to use on OSX 10.5.  It 
probably won't 100% work without gfortran installed though.

I just tried making some matplotlib plots using athe sage I built on 10.5.  I get lots of *serious* problems.  Nothing works.  This may be very difficult to resolve; I don't know.   This happens both in the notebook and from the command line.

I think this was a result of something involving #1044; I've tested
again and I can't replicate this problem at all.  So never mind -- matplotlib is fine :-).

Hi,

I just did a test and using the new version of g95 here:
    http://ftp.g95.org/g95-x86-osx.tgz
works fine for building Sage on Leopard OS X 10.5 intel.  
So, we can just update that and stop worrying about require
gfortran on that platform.  Very nice.
