I agree with ncalexan:

1. The string functions should be abstracted to the GenericGraph class with the string changing depending on whether the graph is directed or not.  In general, we are trying to consolidate functionality to the GenericGraph class when possible these days.

2. The graphviz function documentation should clearly state that graphviz (and in particular, dot) needs to be installed in the system path.  It would be nice were the option to run the other graphviz programs, like neato, etc.

The attached patch addresses the referee's comments.

It also removes references to the actual graphviz/dot application.  I don't see how this can be made cross-platform and I'm worried about licensing issues, so I'm just ducking the issue.  Open a new ticket if you'd like this functionality.
