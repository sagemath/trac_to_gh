Here's an exhibition of the bug:

```
sage: R.<x,w,v,u> = QQ['x','w','v','u']
sage: f=(1-x)*(1-w)*(2-2*v)
sage: f
-2*x*w*v + 2*x*w + 2*x*v + 2*w*v - 2*x - 2*w - 2*v + 2
sage: f.factor()
(-2) * (x - 1) * (w - 1) * (v - 1)
sage: f
x*w*v - x*w - x*v - w*v + x + w + v - 1
```

The fix is attached.

Component: **basic arithmetic**
