This is from Anton Mellit, and basically explains how to do what we
want, maybe. 

```
By the way I put my sources on sourceforge (http://pari-
python.cvs.sourceforge.net/pari-python/pari-python/)
The error handlers are in errors.cpp and errors.h
I use slightly modified version of the pari exception handling which
is implemented using setjmp/longjmp and you use it like this:
CATCH(CATCH_ALL) {
   // if error occures
} TRY {
   // do something
} ENDCATCH
I made similar macros, but I catch exceptions not when they arise in
PARI, but after PARI prints error message and calls
default_exception_handler, which I set as follows:
default_exception_handler = exception_handler,
where exception_handler simply should return 0 if there is a handler
installed. And the actual handler must be installed in GP_DATA->env
using setjmp(GP_DATA->env) (don't forget to store the old handler
somewhere and put it back afterwards)

I've recently worked on it so that it catches SIGINT (Ctrl-C).

First I turned off PARI's own signal handling. Instead of pari_init I
use this:

pari_init_opts(64000000, 500000, INIT_DFTm);

Then I install my own signal handler which simply raises pari
exception. I install the handler at the first CATCH and uninstall it
and return the Python's one on the last ENDCATCH.

It is totally not clear to me what this is all about.  In Sage-4.5.2 the PARI error handling works (a bit ugly, but it works).

I would mark it "duplicate/invalid/wontfix".
