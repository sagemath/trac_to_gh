This is from Anton Mellit, and basically explains how to do what we
want, maybe. 

```
By the way I put my sources on sourceforge (http://pari-
python.cvs.sourceforge.net/pari-python/pari-python/)
The error handlers are in errors.cpp and errors.h
I use slightly modified version of the pari exception handling which
is implemented using setjmp/longjmp and you use it like this:
CATCH(CATCH_ALL) {
   // if error occures
} TRY {
   // do something
} ENDCATCH
I made similar macros, but I catch exceptions not when they arise in
PARI, but after PARI prints error message and calls
default_exception_handler, which I set as follows:
default_exception_handler = exception_handler,
where exception_handler simply should return 0 if there is a handler
installed. And the actual handler must be installed in GP_DATA->env
using setjmp(GP_DATA->env) (don't forget to store the old handler
somewhere and put it back afterwards)

I've recently worked on it so that it catches SIGINT (Ctrl-C).

First I turned off PARI's own signal handling. Instead of pari_init I
use this:

pari_init_opts(64000000, 500000, INIT_DFTm);

Then I install my own signal handler which simply raises pari
exception. I install the handler at the first CATCH and uninstall it
and return the Python's one on the last ENDCATCH.

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
It is totally not clear to me what this is all about.  In Sage-4.5.2 the PARI error handling works (a bit ugly, but it works).

I would mark it "duplicate/invalid/wontfix".
