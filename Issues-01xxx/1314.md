This software could be pretty useful.... But I know nothing about license matters :

The majority of files are currently under the following simple and quite
unrestrictive license:

 "(C) Copyright David James Pearce and Gary Haggard, 2007.

This license may not be removed from any of the files in question.

This software makes use of Brendan McKay's excellent "Nauty" program
for determining (amongst other things) whether two graphs are
isomorphic or not.  You can find more information about this program
here: http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/nauty

All files from the Nauty program are located in the nauty/
subdirectory.  The following license applies to all files in the
nauty/ directory (see nauty.h for more details):

  "Copyright (1984-2004) Brendan McKay.  All rights reserved.  Permission

So in the end it reads like the license is at least as GPL-uncompatible as Nauty's, and will then have to be included as an external software...

Not really. Sage includes software which could be used to replace this functionality. We just need to get the *rest* of the software relicensed, if this is possible.

Per discussion in Ticket http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/7052 Pearce and Haggard's code could be included but nauty's license is incompatible. nauty could however be included as a separate optional spkg and the isomorphism function that it is used for replaced with Sage library calls. Then nauty could be used if available or called.

Since Pearce and Haggard's code is extremely efficient at computing the chromatic polynomial as well (between two and three orders of magnitude faster than the current Sage function) it could offer benefit there too.

mhansen, thanks for sharing this code.  Unfortunately, it does not seem to give the right answer for K_4:

sage: G = graphs.[This is the Trac macro *CompleteGraph* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#CompleteGraph-macro)(4); G.allow_loops(true); G.allow_multiple_edges(true); tp = tutte_polynomial(G,x,y); tp

x<sup>2</sup>*y<sup>2</sup> + x*y<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup>*y + x*y<sup>2</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + x*y

The actual Tutte polynomial of K4 is x<sup>3</sup> + 3*x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>3</sup> + 4*x*y + 3*y<sup>2</sup> + 2*x + 2*y.  

I currently do not see a way to implement the Tutte polynomial without making lots of copies of graphs, but maybe someone else can.

I timed both Jeremy's code and mhansen's code and it seems that mhansen's is much faster.  

The two codes give two different looking (but potentially the same) answers on the Petersen graph.

Although they are both showing up funny looking here...

Is there an easy way to multiply out and gather like terms in sage?

Nice, perhaps I'll do that one time if you wish.

Btw, there is a minor bug in tutte.sage. In the corner case 

```
257     if G.num_edges() == 0:
258         return 1
```

we should actually still return a polynomial since otherwise:

```
tutte_polynomial(graphs.CompleteGraph(10).complement())(0,3)

would break.

By the way, could you define what an "ear" is somewhere ? You say that it is a "sequence of vertices" which is a tad vague, and your code seems to imply somewhere that a vertex of degree 2 adjacent to two vertices of degree 3 is not an ear, while I thought that it was.

Well, .. `:-)`

At the end of the block `if initial_call is True`, you can add the following :

```
ans = tutte_polynomial(G, initial_call=False, edge_selector=edge_selector)
tutte_polynomial.cache.clear()
return ans
```

Cool. I just changed the branch as I have a couple of commits to add 

* Rebase on 6.1.beta4

I agree with the non-mathematical part of what was above. Soooooo we just need somebody to review my two commits and we are done.

Okay, `@cached_function` doesn't work because we can't pass a key function to it... (aside: I think such a feature would be quite useful) Back to the custom `@_cache`.

With my changes (including some other optimizations):

```
sage: P = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: %timeit P.tutte_polynomial()
1 loops, best of 3: 256 ms per loop
```
Before:

```
sage: P = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: %timeit P.tutte_polynomial()
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.08 ms per loop
```

Now I'm currently perplexed...currently the best involves extra if statements, creation of parents, and unused arguments being passed. So we might just want to merge `6ef434e` instead. Still testing stuff...

Ahahahah. So you will not do without a "local cache" and a "global cache". You want to use the global cache to speedup the results, and you want to clear the local cache only. And merge the two if the user wants to keep it.

And what happens if the local cache generates values that exist in the global cache too ? `:-P` What do you cache then ? `:-P`

You want to use the global cache to speedup the results, and you want to clear the local cache only. And merge the two if the user wants to keep it.\n\n\nWhat we should probably do, if we do keep a global cache, is during the computation check if the key is in the global cache as well. However I'm thinking we should not have a global cache because we get a memory leak. Create a graph `G`, compute it's Tutte polynomial, then delete `G`. The polynomial is now stuck in the global cache (that we don't want to have to manually clear). I'm thinking the better way to do things is only have a local cache and make `tutte_polynomial()` a cached method of the graphs. That way when we delete the graph (along with the local cache), the resulting polynomial can be garbage collected. It's probably better to call the local cache the computation cache.\n\n> And what happens if the local cache generates values that exist in the global cache too ? `:-P` What do you cache then ? `:-P`\n\n\nIn effect what I'm proposing is we keep them completely separate, I think that would create the least amount of problems. One other thing we could do is keep a small fixed-size permanent cache.\n\nThat gives me an idea about something else to do: have an option for the max size of a truly local cache when doing the computations.

What we should probably do, if we do keep a global cache, is during the computation check if the key is in the global cache as well. However I'm thinking we should not have a global cache because we get a memory leak. Create a graph `G`, compute it's Tutte polynomial, then delete `G`. The polynomial is now stuck in the global cache (that we don't want to have to manually clear). I'm thinking the better way to do things is only have a local cache and make `tutte_polynomial()` a cached method of the graphs. That way when we delete the graph (along with the local cache), the resulting polynomial can be garbage collected. It's probably better to call the local cache the computation cache.

How big of a concern is it for recomputing Tutte polynomials for isomorphic-but-not-identical graphs?

Simon, I was trying to convert it to use the usual `@cached_function` instead of the custom cache.

Sounds reasonable.

Can you use immutable graphs? See #15278, #15603, #15619 and #15622. These can be used as dictionary key and are thus acceptable input for a cached function.
