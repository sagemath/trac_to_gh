This software could be pretty useful.... But I know nothing about license matters :

The majority of files are currently under the following simple and quite
unrestrictive license:

 "(C) Copyright David James Pearce and Gary Haggard, 2007.
  Permission to copy, use, modify, sell and distribute this software
  is granted provided this copyright notice appears in all copies.

  warranty, and with no claim as to its suitability for any purpose.

This license may not be removed from any of the files in question.

This software makes use of Brendan McKay's excellent "Nauty" program
for determining (amongst other things) whether two graphs are
isomorphic or not.  You can find more information about this program
here: http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/nauty

All files from the Nauty program are located in the nauty/
subdirectory.  The following license applies to all files in the
nauty/ directory (see nauty.h for more details):

  "Copyright (1984-2004) Brendan McKay.  All rights reserved.  Permission
   is hereby given for use and/or distribution with the exception of
   sale for profit or application with nontrivial military significance.
   You must not remove this copyright notice, and you must document any
   changes that you make to this program.
   This software is subject to this copyright only, irrespective of
   any copyright attached to any package of which this is a part.

   This program is only provided "as is".  No responsibility will be taken
   by the author, his employer or his pet rabbit for any misfortune which
   befalls you because of its use.  I don't think it will delete all your
   files, burn down your computer room or turn your children against you,
   but if it does: stiff cheddar.  On the other hand, I very much welcome
   bug reports, or at least I would if there were any bugs.

So in the end it reads like the license is at least as GPL-uncompatible as Nauty's, and will then have to be included as an external software...

Not really. Sage includes software which could be used to replace this functionality. We just need to get the *rest* of the software relicensed, if this is possible.

mhansen, thanks for sharing this code.  Unfortunately, it does not seem to give the right answer for K_4:

sage: G = graphs.[This is the Trac macro *CompleteGraph* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#CompleteGraph-macro)(4); G.allow_loops(true); G.allow_multiple_edges(true); tp = tutte_polynomial(G,x,y); tp

x<sup>2</sup>*y<sup>2</sup> + x*y<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup>*y + x*y<sup>2</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + x*y

The actual Tutte polynomial of K4 is x<sup>3</sup> + 3*x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>3</sup> + 4*x*y + 3*y<sup>2</sup> + 2*x + 2*y.  

I currently do not see a way to implement the Tutte polynomial without making lots of copies of graphs, but maybe someone else can.

And this is the output of Jeremy's:
x^9 + 6*x^8 + 21*x^7 + 56*x^6 + 12*x^5*y + 114*x^5 + y^6 + 70*x^4*y +
30*x<sup>3*y</sup>2 + 15*x<sup>2*y</sup>3 + 10*x*y^4 + 170*x^4 + 180*x^3 + 120*x^2 + 9*y^5
+ 170*x^3*y + 105*x<sup>2*y</sup>2 + 65*x*y^3 + 35*y^4 + 240*x^2*y + 171*x*y^2 +
75*y^3 + 168*x*y + 84*y^2 + 36*x + 36*y

Although they are both showing up funny looking here...

Is there an easy way to multiply out and gather like terms in sage?

```
257     if G.num_edges() == 0:

At the end of the block `if initial_call is True`, you can add the following :

```
ans = tutte_polynomial(G, initial_call=False, edge_selector=edge_selector)
tutte_polynomial.cache.clear()
return ans
```

In effect what I'm proposing is we keep them completely separate, I think that would create the least amount of problems. One other thing we could do is keep a small fixed-size permanent cache.

That gives me an idea about something else to do: have an option for the max size of a truly local cache when doing the computations. A priority queue up to some fixed size which keeps track of computed Tutte polynomials (with the priority being most often computed or some other heuristic) from that in the local cache. However the above, which turns it into a paging problem, might be an over-thought approach.

How big of a concern is it for recomputing Tutte polynomials for isomorphic-but-not-identical graphs?

Simon, I was trying to convert it to use the usual ``@`cached_function` instead of the custom cache.
