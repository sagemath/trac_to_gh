This software could be pretty useful.... But I know nothing about license matters :

The majority of files are currently under the following simple and quite
unrestrictive license:

 "(C) Copyright David James Pearce and Gary Haggard, 2007.

This license may not be removed from any of the files in question.

This software makes use of Brendan McKay's excellent "Nauty" program
for determining (amongst other things) whether two graphs are
isomorphic or not.  You can find more information about this program
here: http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/nauty

All files from the Nauty program are located in the nauty/
subdirectory.  The following license applies to all files in the
nauty/ directory (see nauty.h for more details):

So in the end it reads like the license is at least as GPL-uncompatible as Nauty's, and will then have to be included as an external software...

Not really. Sage includes software which could be used to replace this functionality. We just need to get the *rest* of the software relicensed, if this is possible.

mhansen, thanks for sharing this code.  Unfortunately, it does not seem to give the right answer for K_4:

sage: G = graphs.[This is the Trac macro *CompleteGraph* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#CompleteGraph-macro)(4); G.allow_loops(true); G.allow_multiple_edges(true); tp = tutte_polynomial(G,x,y); tp

x<sup>2</sup>*y<sup>2</sup> + x*y<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup>*y + x*y<sup>2</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + x*y

The actual Tutte polynomial of K4 is x<sup>3</sup> + 3*x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>3</sup> + 4*x*y + 3*y<sup>2</sup> + 2*x + 2*y.  

I currently do not see a way to implement the Tutte polynomial without making lots of copies of graphs, but maybe someone else can.

I timed both Jeremy's code and mhansen's code and it seems that mhansen's is much faster.  

The two codes give two different looking (but potentially the same) answers on the Petersen graph.

This is about a third of the tutte.sage output

Although they are both showing up funny looking here...

Is there an easy way to multiply out and gather like terms in sage?

Nice, perhaps I'll do that one time if you wish.

Btw, there is a minor bug in tutte.sage. In the corner case 

```
257     if G.num_edges() == 0:
258         return 1
```

we should actually still return a polynomial since otherwise:

```
tutte_polynomial(graphs.CompleteGraph(10).complement())(0,3)
```

would break.

Okay !

Attached is the nhansen's code factored into Sage. Before having any changes of being positively reviewed I we need to figure out how can we allow the users to use the edge selectors in the code and document that.

Let me know if you have any other comments and of course don't be shy to modify this yourself as well.

Hellooooooooo !!

If you just want comments on the integration into Sage, it would be nice if you could add it to the reference manual, perhaps rename the file to `tutte_polynomial.py`, and add documentation to the new functions until `sage -coverage yourfile.py` says that everything is filled. In particular it would be nice if you could be more verbose about what `VertexOrder` and `MinimizeDegree` actually do `:-)`

Oh, and people around do not like the `raise ValueError, "something"`. They say it's not pep8 or not Python3-ready, and prefer `ValueError("something")`.

This contextmanager decorator really is a funny thing `:-)`

At the end of the block `if initial_call is True`, you can add the following :

```
ans = tutte_polynomial(G, initial_call=False, edge_selector=edge_selector)
tutte_polynomial.cache.clear()
return ans
```

Cool. I just changed the branch as I have a couple of commits to add 

* Rebase on 6.1.beta4

I agree with the non-mathematical part of what was above. Soooooo we just need somebody to review my two commits and we are done.

Okay, `@cached_function` doesn't work because we can't pass a key function to it... (aside: I think such a feature would be quite useful) Back to the custom `@_cache`.

With my changes (including some other optimizations):

```
sage: P = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: %timeit P.tutte_polynomial()
1 loops, best of 3: 256 ms per loop
```
Before:

```
sage: P = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: %timeit P.tutte_polynomial()
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.08 ms per loop
```

Now I'm currently perplexed...currently the best involves extra if statements, creation of parents, and unused arguments being passed. So we might just want to merge `6ef434e` instead. Still testing stuff...

Ahahahah. So you will not do without a "local cache" and a "global cache". You want to use the global cache to speedup the results, and you want to clear the local cache only. And merge the two if the user wants to keep it.

And what happens if the local cache generates values that exist in the global cache too ? `:-P` What do you cache then ? `:-P`

I think you are overthinking very simple needs `:-)`

How big of a concern is it for recomputing Tutte polynomials for isomorphic-but-not-identical graphs?

Simon, I was trying to convert it to use the usual `@cached_function` instead of the custom cache.

Where are the two merged? I can't see it in the code.

What should happen? You have two caches caching the same value. You clear the first cache. The value is still in the second cache.

Sounds reasonable.

Can you use immutable graphs? See #15278, #15603, #15619 and #15622. These can be used as dictionary key and are thus acceptable input for a cached function.
