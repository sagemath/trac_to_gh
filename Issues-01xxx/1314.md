This software could be pretty useful.... But I know nothing about license matters :

The majority of files are currently under the following simple and quite
unrestrictive license:

 "(C) Copyright David James Pearce and Gary Haggard, 2007.
  Permission to copy, use, modify, sell and distribute this software
  is granted provided this copyright notice appears in all copies.
  This software is provided "as is" without express or implied
  warranty, and with no claim as to its suitability for any purpose.

  Email: david.pearce@mcs.vuw.ac.nz"

This license may not be removed from any of the files in question.

This software makes use of Brendan McKay's excellent "Nauty" program
for determining (amongst other things) whether two graphs are
isomorphic or not.  You can find more information about this program
here: http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/nauty

All files from the Nauty program are located in the nauty/
subdirectory.  The following license applies to all files in the
nauty/ directory (see nauty.h for more details):

  "Copyright (1984-2004) Brendan McKay.  All rights reserved.  Permission
   is hereby given for use and/or distribution with the exception of
   sale for profit or application with nontrivial military significance.
   You must not remove this copyright notice, and you must document any
   changes that you make to this program.

   any copyright attached to any package of which this is a part.

   but if it does: stiff cheddar.  On the other hand, I very much welcome
   bug reports, or at least I would if there were any bugs.

So in the end it reads like the license is at least as GPL-uncompatible as Nauty's, and will then have to be included as an external software...

Not really. Sage includes software which could be used to replace this functionality. We just need to get the *rest* of the software relicensed, if this is possible.

Per discussion in Ticket https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/7052 Pearce and Haggard's code could be included but nauty's license is incompatible. nauty could however be included as a separate optional spkg and the isomorphism function that it is used for replaced with Sage library calls. Then nauty could be used if available or called.

Since Pearce and Haggard's code is extremely efficient at computing the chromatic polynomial as well (between two and three orders of magnitude faster than the current Sage function) it could offer benefit there too.

mhansen, thanks for sharing this code.  Unfortunately, it does not seem to give the right answer for K_4:

sage: G = graphs.[This is the Trac macro *CompleteGraph* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#CompleteGraph-macro)(4); G.allow_loops(true); G.allow_multiple_edges(true); tp = tutte_polynomial(G,x,y); tp

x<sup>2</sup>*y<sup>2</sup> + x*y<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup>*y + x*y<sup>2</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + x*y

The actual Tutte polynomial of K4 is x<sup>3</sup> + 3*x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>3</sup> + 4*x*y + 3*y<sup>2</sup> + 2*x + 2*y.  

I currently do not see a way to implement the Tutte polynomial without making lots of copies of graphs, but maybe someone else can.

<a id='comment:15'>Comment 15:</a>
I timed both Jeremy's code and mhansen's code and it seems that mhansen's is much faster.  

The two codes give two different looking (but potentially the same) answers on the Petersen graph.

This is about a third of the tutte.sage output
14*x^4 + 22*(x + y)^2*x + 8*(x + y)*((x + y)*x + y^2 + x + y)*x + (x^4 +
x^3 + (x + y)*(x^2 + x + y) + x^2 + x + y)*x^2 + ((x + y)^2*x + (x +
y)^2 + y^3 + ((x + y)*x^2 + (x + y)*x + y^2 + x + y)*x + y^2 + x +
y)*x^2 + 22*(x + y)^2 + 13*(y^2 + x + y)^2 + 14*x^3 + 22*y^3 + 14*(x +
y)*(x^2 + x + y) + 4*(y^2 + x + y)*((x + y)^2 + y^3 + y^2 + x + y) +
5*((x + y)*x + (x^2 + x + y)*x + y^2 + x + y)*y + 9*((x + y)*x^2 + (x +
y)*x + y^2 + x + y)*x + 9*(x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + y)*x + ((x + y)^2*x +
(x + y)^2 + y^3 + ((x + y)*x^2 + (x + y)*x + y^2 + x + y)*x + y^2 + x +
y)*x + (x^4 + (x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + y)*x^2 + x^3 + (x + y)*(x^2 + x +
y) + (x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + y)*x + x^2 + x + y)*x + 4*(x^4 + (x + y)^2*x
+ (x + y)^2 + x^3 + y^3 + (x + y)*(x^2 + x + y) + ((x + y)*x^2 + (x +
y)*x + y^2 + x + y)*x + (x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + y)*x + x^2 + y^2 + 2*x +
2*y)*x + 2*(x^4 + (x + y)^2*x + (x + y)^2 + x^3 + y^3 + (x + y)*(x^2 + x

And this is the output of Jeremy's:
x^9 + 6*x^8 + 21*x^7 + 56*x^6 + 12*x^5*y + 114*x^5 + y^6 + 70*x^4*y +
30*x<sup>3*y</sup>2 + 15*x<sup>2*y</sup>3 + 10*x*y^4 + 170*x^4 + 180*x^3 + 120*x^2 + 9*y^5
+ 170*x^3*y + 105*x<sup>2*y</sup>2 + 65*x*y^3 + 35*y^4 + 240*x^2*y + 171*x*y^2 +
75*y^3 + 168*x*y + 84*y^2 + 36*x + 36*y

Although they are both showing up funny looking here...

Is there an easy way to multiply out and gather like terms in sage?

Btw, there is a minor bug in tutte.sage. In the corner case 

```
257     if G.num_edges() == 0:
258         return 1
```

we should actually still return a polynomial since otherwise:

```
tutte_polynomial(graphs.CompleteGraph(10).complement())(0,3)
```

would break.

Attachment: **[trac_1314_tuttePoly.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1314/trac_1314_tuttePoly.patch.gz)**

Okay !

Attached is the nhansen's code factored into Sage. Before having any changes of being positively reviewed I we need to figure out how can we allow the users to use the edge selectors in the code and document that.

Let me know if you have any other comments and of course don't be shy to modify this yourself as well.

At the end of the block `if initial_call is True`, you can add the following :

```
ans = tutte_polynomial(G, initial_call=False, edge_selector=edge_selector)
tutte_polynomial.cache.clear()
return ans
```

Okay, `@cached_function` doesn't work because we can't pass a key function to it... (aside: I think such a feature would be quite useful) Back to the custom `@_cache`.

With my changes (including some other optimizations):

```
sage: P = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: %timeit P.tutte_polynomial()
1 loops, best of 3: 256 ms per loop
```
Before:

```
sage: P = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: %timeit P.tutte_polynomial()
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.08 ms per loop
```

Now I'm currently perplexed...currently the best involves extra if statements, creation of parents, and unused arguments being passed. So we might just want to merge `6ef434e` instead. Still testing stuff...

Okay, I figured out what was changing. I wasn't caching the final result of the Tutte polynomial, and how it currently is done will overly clear the cache. For example, say you compute the Tutte polynomial on some large graph `G`, then you compute it on a very small graph `H` and ask it to clear the cache. Now the cached data for `G` is gone. I think we should always cache the final results, and with the current implementation, there is the possibility we've already computed the Tutte polynomial of a small graph. However I think this will be infrequent or you should not be clearing the utility cache.

Although there is a problem, we get memory leaks. Now one can argue with the previous behavior along with the default implementation, this is not a leak. If the user was deciding to keep the cache, this would be the user knowing what (s)he is doing. Yet I wouldn't want my small computation to destroy the data of my big one, nor store it myself. So which way should we go, and if we go with 2 caches, how usable would the weak caches be? Feedback is needed.

Simon, Nils -- I cc-ed you here because we might need a good weak cache solution here and I'd like your thoughts and expertise.

Ahahahah. So you will not do without a "local cache" and a "global cache". You want to use the global cache to speedup the results, and you want to clear the local cache only. And merge the two if the user wants to keep it.

And what happens if the local cache generates values that exist in the global cache too ? `:-P` What do you cache then ? `:-P`

In effect what I'm proposing is we keep them completely separate, I think that would create the least amount of problems. One other thing we could do is keep a small fixed-size permanent cache.

That gives me an idea about something else to do: have an option for the max size of a truly local cache when doing the computations. A priority queue up to some fixed size which keeps track of computed Tutte polynomials (with the priority being most often computed or some other heuristic) from that in the local cache. However the above, which turns it into a paging problem, might be an over-thought approach.

How big of a concern is it for recomputing Tutte polynomials for isomorphic-but-not-identical graphs?

Simon, I was trying to convert it to use the usual `@cached_function` instead of the custom cache.
