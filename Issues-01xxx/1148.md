It would be nice if `valuation(3/5, 5)` returned -1, but it does this:

I tried the combination of 1148.hg and 1148-more.patch patch against 2.8.14.  The source code looks reasonable, and doctesting arith.py and rational.pyx (the two files touched by the change) both succeed.  (I did not try testall.)

In other words, looks good to me.
