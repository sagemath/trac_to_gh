E.g., in linear_code.py line 780 (in extended_code()), this line dominates:

```
        Gxs = Gx._matrix_(F)           # this is the killer
```

That is dumb.  Optimize this a lot.

The exact code in question no longer exists in that module, though this issue might still be relevant, and would probably be resolved by #26902.

Indeed, this is (unsurprisingly) much faster using the libgap interface.

I wasn't sure exactly how to construct a matrix over a finite field in GAP, so I made it first in Sage, and the passed it to both GAP interfaces, and then back to Sage again:

```
sage: F = GF(2)
sage: M = matrix(F, [[1,0,0],[1,1,0]])
sage: M_gap = gap(M); M_gap
[ [ Z(2)^0, 0*Z(2), 0*Z(2) ], [ Z(2)^0, Z(2)^0, 0*Z(2) ] ]
sage: M_libgap = libgap(M); M_libgap
[ [ Z(2)^0, 0*Z(2), 0*Z(2) ], [ Z(2)^0, Z(2)^0, 0*Z(2) ] ]
sage: %timeit M_gap._matrix_(F)
10 loops, best of 3: 22.3 ms per loop
sage: %timeit M_libgap._matrix_(F)
1000 loops, best of 3: 902 Âµs per loop
```

I think that about speaks for itself.  Repeated experiments showed similar results.
