When this is fixed, inst/inst.tex should be updated; I just changed that file to say that OS X 10.5 is not yet supported.

A short update: I am tracking progress at http://wiki.sagemath.org/osx64

So far there are a couple problems:

* libSingular segfaults on import
* numpy fails to build
* twistedweb2 depends on some OSX specfic python extensions

Other than that it is mostly supplying the right flags in the build process. I am currently merging those OSX 10.5 64 bit build fixes for every spkg I touch.

Cheers,

Michael

Provided one uses the new experimental Fortran.spkg Sage 3.3.alpha5 and later build out of the box in 64 bit mode on OSX 10.5. There are some doctesting issues left, but those will be addressed via other tickets.

So I am closing this "meta" ticket - it took way too long to fix this.

Cheers,

Michael
