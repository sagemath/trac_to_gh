#1708 duplicated this

Also, here is a comment from Kate Minola, which is the same problem.  I've thus
promoted this to a blocker:

```
For sage-2.10.1, if I compile from source and run
'make check' - all is fine.  If I then build a binary
distribution (using -bdist), and then inside the binary
distribution run 'make check' I get the following errors.
