Hi,

This is the latest 3d bundle.

There will still be some doctest failures in 3d -- just put nodoctest in the files.

This can be included in Sage, but much work remains before it is released. 

**Assignee:** @williamstein

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/1670

Merged jmol-jan4.hg into 2.9.2.rc0, resolved some small merge conflict introduced #1671. Loads of doctests will fail, but William has assured me that those will be fixed tomorrow.

Cheers,
