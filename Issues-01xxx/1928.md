[11:28am] rlm: given two graphs, and a surjection from one to the other (not necessarily a graph hom.), we can construct a bundle
[11:29am] rlm: further, all bundles arise in this way
[11:29am] rlm: so instead of a partition, give both graphs and a map
[11:29am] rlm: that allows for any bundle to be constructed, right?
[11:34am] jason: rlm: the first graph is the petersen graph, for example, and the second is K_2, right?
[11:34am] jason: Yes, I think you're right that every bundle can be described that way.
[11:35am] rlm: so at least we have one way of constructing, so that nothing can't be constructed
