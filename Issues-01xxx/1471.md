Moving a Sage install breaks clisp. I moved `sage-2.9.alpha5` to `sage-2.9.alpha5-vg` and it broke clisp:

```
mabshoff@sage:/tmp/Work-mabshoff/release-cycles-2.9/sage-2.9.alpha5-vg$ clisp
clisp: /tmp/Work-mabshoff/release-cycles-2.9/sage-2.9.alpha5/local/lib/clisp/base/lisp.run: No such file or directory
```
I have no clue how Maxima still manages to work, but there must be a fix somehow.

Cheers,

Michael

Since sage-2.9.1.alpha3 this issue seems to be gone, maybe earlier? My standard procedure now is to relocate my installed sage before I do a make check.

clisp just worked
