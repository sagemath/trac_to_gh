The mwrank wrapper crashes for curves requiring a large precision:

```
sage: F=EllipticCurve([1, 0, 0, -276367728491702366785, 2435648906608461566891797433225])
sage: F.gens()
...
Mwrank crashed executing [1, 0, 0, -276367728491702366785, 2435648906608461566891797433225]
```
The workaround is to enlarge the precision, but this does not seem to work:

```
sage: mwrank_set_precision(40)
sage: F=EllipticCurve([1, 0, 0, -276367728491702366785, 2435648906608461566891797433225])
sage: F.gens()
...
Mwrank crashed executing [1, 0, 0, -276367728491702366785, 2435648906608461566891797433225]
```
In comparison, the mwrank console works:

```
pasta% sage -mwrank -p40
...
Enter curve: [1, 0, 0, -276367728491702366785, 2435648906608461566891797433225]
...
Rank = 2
...
Generator 1 is [-64279912864146869343830:9890032513326436827332346415:5023053676376]; height 19.3576595783878252695113978299426894052
Generator 2 is [15973785170:1448063200169915:1]; height 4.540177201347877276441819514533365581727
```
This proves that the defect is in the mwrank wrapper, not in mwrank itself.

Since William is rewriting the mwrank wrapper he might take care of this. The crash does happen with Sage 2.10.2.alpha0.

Cheers,

Hmmm, since William told be that the mwrank wrapper rewrite is practically done it would be nice to get this into Sage and hopefully resolve this issue, too.
