The reset command is supposed to reset all variables etc., back to their defaults.  This is currently slightly broken, since the symbolic x doesn't get reset:

```
sage: reset()
sage: x
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NameError: name 'x' is not defined
sage: factor(90823048)
2^3 * 11352881
```

I seem to recall implementing the symbolic being imported slightly differently, which is surely responsible for this bug.

In reset.pyx, 

```
    """
    G = globals()  # this is the reason the code must be in SageX.
    if not G.has_key('sage_mode'):
        import sage.all
        D = sage.all.__dict__
    else:
        mode = G['sage_mode']
        if mode == 'cmdline':
            import sage.all_cmdline
            D = sage.all_cmdline.__dict__            
        elif mode == 'notebook':
            import sage.all_notebook
            D = sage.all_notebook.__dict__            
        else:
            import sage.all
            D = sage.all.__dict__     
```
G never the key 'sage_mode' so none of the custom imports in all_cmdline and all_notebook will make it in after reset().  This is where 'x' is imported.  Here is what 'print G' gives:
