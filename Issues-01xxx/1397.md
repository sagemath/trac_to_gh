"sage -uprgrade" should print brief release notes when it is done upgrading (or before it starts upgrading, and give the chance to abort the upgrade).

This is inspired by the following, from IRC:

```
 did the notebook change location 2.8.14 --> 2.8.15?
```
...

```
ok, i just panicked for a second...
```

Mmh, should it print only the release notes from the last upgrade or each release since the version of Sage that  is upgraded?

Cheers,

Michael
