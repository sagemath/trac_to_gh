"sage -uprgrade" should print brief release notes when it is done upgrading (or before it starts upgrading, and give the chance to abort the upgrade).

This is inspired by the following, from IRC:

```
 did the notebook change location 2.8.14 --> 2.8.15?
```
...

```
ok, i just panicked for a second...
```


Component: **user interface**
