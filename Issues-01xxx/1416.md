MUST DO
* (done) upgrade to 2.6.1
* (done) fix build issues and install issues
* (done) worry about graphics / X11 issues
* (done) readline
* (done) gfortran support (modify setup.py in rpy package; anything else?)

TODO LATER
* finish pexpect interface.
* properly patch rpy so _rpy_ methods are called.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Add this to spkg/install

```
R=`$newest r`
export R
```

Add this to spkg/standard/deps (somewhere in the middle):

```
$(INST)/$(R): $(INST)/$(PYTHON)      
        $(SAGE_SPKG) $(R) 2>&1
        $(MAKEREL)
```
and also add this to the big list of things the $(INST)/$(SAGE) target depends on:

```
                $(INST)/$(R)  \
```

WARNING: The above is untested, so probably not perfect -- though I'm pretty confident.
