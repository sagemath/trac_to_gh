  Attached is a file with odd behavior.

       p = a prime
       n = a postive integer
       q = p^n
       K = GF(q)

      f = x^3 + y^3 + z^3

      points(f) -- returns list of poitns of f(x,y,z) == 0

      The above works with p = 5, n = 2.  But points
   crashes with p = 5, n = 3.  The error message is attached.
I also did this:

for i in range(0,1953125):
....:     bar.append(K.random_element)
....:
sage: len(bar)
1953125

Thus I don't think SAGE ran out of memory.

I am using SAGE 2.8.7 on a macbook pro, OS 10.5

Best regards,

Jim
