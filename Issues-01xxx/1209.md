This *does* work in Maple 11:

I wonder what proportion of the 1300 or so top-level functions in Maple (according
to a sage's maple.[tab]) actually have source code.    

Interestingly, I bet I can make it so 

  sage: maple.gcd??

will show the source code using one you suggest above.  Trac ticket:
