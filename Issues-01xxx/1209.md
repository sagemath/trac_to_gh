This *does* work in Maple 11:

I wonder what proportion of the 1300 or so top-level functions in Maple (according
to a sage's maple.[tab]) actually have source code.    

Interestingly, I bet I can make it so 

  sage: maple.gcd??

will show the source code using one you suggest above.  Trac ticket:

I get some reject against my 2.10.3.rc0:

```
sage$ patch -p1 --dry-run < trac_1209.patch
patching file sage/interfaces/maple.py
Hunk #1 succeeded at 485 with fuzz 2 (offset 35 lines).
Hunk #2 FAILED at 584.
1 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/interfaces/maple.py.rej

Am I missing a dependency or do I just need a rebase here?
