The current implementation of quadratic number fields calculates the discriminant on initialization, which can be expensive and is unnecessary. 

Elements are represented as a+b sqrt(D) / denom. I don't believe that we require D to be the discriminant, but this needs to be verified before a change is made. For efficiency reasons, it might be worth doing trial division to reduce squares of small prime powers from D, as smaller D yields faster arithmetic.
