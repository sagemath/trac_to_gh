On Solaris I get the following doctest failures due to numerical noise:

```
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/calculus/test_sympy.py        **********************************************************************
File "test_sympy.py", line 23:
    : float(pi + exp(1))
Expected:
    5.8598744820488378
Got:
    5.8598744820488387
```

The attached patch fixes that.

Cheers,

Michael
