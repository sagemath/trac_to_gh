> Send me your doctest timing code :-)  I'm looking forward to playing with it.

Here you go. It's a patch to local/bin/sage-doctest and a file timing.py
that I had put in sage/misc .

It adds a --time option to sage-doctest that makes it append the timings
it generates as a dict indexed by hash to the (cpickled) file
.doctest/timings.sobj .  There's no infrastructure yet to automatically
delete that file when appropriate, though.

I also attached two very basic scripts that show or compare the contents
of timings.sobj files.
