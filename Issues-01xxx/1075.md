The attached patch provides a custom `__hash__` function for fraction field elements so that fractions with a denominator of 1 hash the same as the hash of the numerator as an element in the ring.  A charming side effect is that `__hash__` is *much* faster now for fraction field elements of MPoly's over QQ.

This fixes some bugs (IMO) in the subs method of ParentWithGens when passing a dictionary.

I don't think there is any problems with hash's changing from one version to the next -- I guess there might be something I'm missing here.

I'm closing this because the patch I'm going to attached to #1181 is much better and much broader.
