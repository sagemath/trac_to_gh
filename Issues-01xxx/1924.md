Today in the sage seminar Clément Pernet demonstrated that in the naive matrix multiply algorithm (used as a basecase for all others)
we have a major inefficiency.

Specifically, for computing C = A*B,

```
for i in A.nrows:
    for j in B.ncols:
        for k in B.nrows:
            C[i,j] += A[i,k] * B[k,j]
```

is bad for the cache as one is iterating over the columns of B in the inner loop. Changing this to 

```
for i in A.nrows:
    for k in B.nrows:
        for j in B.ncols:
            C[i,j] += A[i,k] * B[k,j]
```

gives the same result, but much better cache performance. 


Component: **linear algebra**

There is something fishy about this patch. It touches the same file in the same area (hunk 1) and that causes rejects:

There is also an extra comma:`cdef mod_int A_row_k,`. So: negative review for now :(, but I am sure Robert will be quick to update. :)

Attachment: **[trac-1924-fixed_I_think.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1924/trac-1924-fixed_I_think.patch.gz)**

I just applied the patch without any funny business to 2.10:

```
sage: hg_sage.apply('https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1924/1924-matrix-mul-loop-order.patch.gz?format=raw')
Attempting to load remote file: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1924/1924-matrix-mul-loop-order.patch.gz?format=raw

applying /Users/was/.sage/temp/teragon.local/47537/tmp_1.patch
```

After applying the patch I do *not* have a line like this:

```
 def mod_int A_row_k,
```
This is because the first part of the diff adds that line, but the
second part removes it.  

By the way, on my laptop before and after applying this patch:

BEFORE:

```
sage: sage: a = random_matrix(GF(101),500); b = random_matrix(GF(101),500)
sage: sage: time c=a*b
CPU times: user 0.38 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.40 s
Wall time: 0.42
sage: sage: a = random_matrix(GF(101),1000); b = random_matrix(GF(101),1000)
sage: sage: time c=a*b
CPU times: user 2.63 s, sys: 0.13 s, total: 2.76 s
Wall time: 2.78
```

AFTER:

```
sage: a = random_matrix(GF(101),500); b = random_matrix(GF(101),500)
sage: time c=a*b
CPU times: user 0.23 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.25 s
Wall time: 0.25
sage: a = random_matrix(GF(101),1000); b = random_matrix(GF(101),1000)
sage: time c=a*b
CPU times: user 1.60 s, sys: 0.13 s, total: 1.73 s
Wall time: 1.73
```

Not bad for basically swapping the order of two for loops!

By the way, on my laptop (core 2 duo 2.6Ghz) magma kicks ass on the above benchmark:

```
sage: magma.eval('a := Random(MatrixAlgebra(GF(101),500)); b := Random(MatrixAlgebra(GF(101),500));')
''
sage: magma.eval('time c := a*b')
'Time: 0.040'
sage: magma.eval('a := Random(MatrixAlgebra(GF(101),1000)); b := Random(MatrixAlgebra(GF(101),1000));')
''
sage: magma.eval('time c := a*b')
'Time: 0.200'
```

It's not their timer lying, because one gets the same timing externally via wall time from Sage:

```
sage: aa = magma('Random(MatrixAlgebra(GF(101),1000))')
sage: bb = magma('Random(MatrixAlgebra(GF(101),1000))')
sage: time cc=aa*bb
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.20
sage: time cc=aa*bb
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.20
sage: time cc=aa*bb
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.20
sage: aa = magma('Random(MatrixAlgebra(GF(101),500))')
sage: bb = magma('Random(MatrixAlgebra(GF(101),500))')
sage: time cc=aa*bb
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.04
sage: time cc=aa*bb
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.03
```

Magma has special optimized matrices for such a small prime (101). 
For the slightly larger p=10007 we have

```
sage: magma.eval('a := Random(MatrixAlgebra(GF(10007),1000)); b := Random(MatrixAlgebra(GF(10007),1000));')
''
sage: magma.eval('time c := a*b')
'Time: 0.860'
```

and in Sage (now):

```
sage: a = random_matrix(GF(10007),1000); b = random_matrix(GF(10007), 1000)
sage: time c=a*b
