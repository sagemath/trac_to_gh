doesn't render. Also

```
[08:48am] williamstein: This should work but doesn't:
[08:48am] williamstein: S = ParametricSurface(lambda (x,y):(cos(x),
sin(x), y), domain=(range(10),range(10)))
```

Now the first example works. Also, the second example almost does

```
S = ParametricSurface(lambda x,y:(cos(x),sin(x), y), domain=(range(10),range(10)))
```

(Note the missing ()'s, it expects to arguments, not a tuple).
