It seems that publishing a notebook publishes the entire notebook directory - including its revision history (if that is what the "snapshots" are). This is almost certainly unexpected behaviour and could lead to serious trouble if someone wants to publish a notebook with an assignment in which he has previously worked out the solution. A tech savvy student might be able to dig that solution up from a "downloaded" SWS file.

Also, currently there does not seem to be any way to delete a published notebook.

I might be wrong on this, but I think it is a serious enough issue that someone should look into it an make sure that no such revision info leakage occurs.

[For "shared" worksheets, similar problems arise. Should there be a "clear revision information" function?]

That's just not true.  I created a worksheet with 20 stored revisions, published it,
and looked at the published worksheet directory.  It doesn't have those revisions stored
in its snapshot directory.

True.  This should be a separate enhancement ticket.  Now #3156

I looked and I think you are wrong.  I also looked at the source code which also says
you're wrong.

Revision history shouldn't be something you want to clear, since it's a cheap
and powerful safety feature.  A simple workaround is to just make a copy of
a worksheet using File --> Copy Worksheet.  This results in a new copy of the
original worksheet, but with all revision history gone.
