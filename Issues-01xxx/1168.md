```
sage: asinh(1)
<type 'exceptions.NameError'>: name 'asinh' is not defined
sage: asinh(x)
<type 'exceptions.NameError'>: name 'asinh' is not defined
```
but:

```
sage: integrate(1/sqrt(9+x^2), x)
asinh(x/3)
sage: (1.0).asinh()
0.881373587019543
```
The same holds for acosh and atanh.

Component: **calculus**
