I made a new ipython spkg, which is here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/tmp/ipython-0.8.1.r2871.spkg

However, it DOES NOT WORK.

```
I tried updating Sage to this version of Ipython, and
when I start sage it just immediately exits:

rank4:~ was$ sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| SAGE Version 2.8.13, Release Date: 2007-11-21                      |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
rank4:~ was$


I.e., I get immediately dumped to the prompt.   Do you
have any idea why?  (I haven't tried at all to figure out why.)

If anybody wants to try this, just do

   wget http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/tmp/ipython-0.8.1.r2871.spkg
   sage -f ipython-0.8.1.r2871.spkg

then run sage.

To restore the previous version of Ipython, just do

   sage -f ipython-0.8.1.p1.spkg

Please post very precise details about your computer, version of OS X,
output of "gcc -v" (from the command line), and the exact error message
when you start Sage.  Also, do you have fink installed?

This is really odd.  pickleshare.py is in the Extensions subfolder of
IPython, and thus iplib.py shouldn't be able to import it.  This is
exactly what William is seeing.....but, this code has been in ipython
for a while (my own running version has it), but it is not causing a
problem.  Ville knows most about this module, any thoughts?

I tried updating Sage to this version of Ipython, and
when I start sage it just immediately exits:

rank4:~ was$ sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| SAGE Version 2.8.13, Release Date: 2007-11-21                      |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
rank4:~ was$


I.e., I get immediately dumped to the prompt.   Do you
have any idea why?  (I haven't tried at all to figure out why.)

If anybody wants to try this, just do

   wget http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/tmp/ipython-0.8.1.r2871.spkg
   sage -f ipython-0.8.1.r2871.spkg

then run sage.

To restore the previous version of Ipython, just do

   sage -f ipython-0.8.1.p1.spkg

I should add that

 sage -ipython

which runs Ipython directly (without sage preparsing, etc.),
works fine, as does import sage.all:

rank4:standard was$ sage -ipython
Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Nov  2 2007, 12:50:27)
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

IPython 0.8.2.svn.r2848 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.
?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features.
%quickref -> Quick reference.
help      -> Python's own help system.
object?   -> Details about 'object'. ?object also works, ?? prints more.

In [1]: from sage.all import *

In [2]: 2/3
Out[2]: 0

In [3]: ZZ(2) / ZZ(3)
Out[3]: 2/3
