Josh Kantor:

```
scipy has an error function that takes complex arguments

sage:  import numpy, scipy
sage:  from scipy import special
sage:  j=numpy.complex(0,1)
sage: -j*float(sqrt(pi))*special.erf(2*j)/2
(16.45262776550727+0j)

Unfortunately numpy and sage's complex numbers are not compatible yet.

Okay, here's v0.prealpha0.0_1a of a patch which uses mpmath to get complex and arbitrary-precision behaviour for erf.  (If it works out we can do error_fcn the same way, as noted by kcrisman).

Unfortunately it does introduce a speed regression:

```
# 4.6.1, via pari
sage: timeit('float(erf(0))',number=1000) # must be float because 4.6.1 doesn't evaluate
1000 loops, best of 3: 109 µs per loop
sage: timeit('erf(0.1)',number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 98.4 µs per loop
sage: timeit('erf(0.99)',number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 98.5 µs per loop

# 4.6.2rc0 with patch
sage: timeit('erf(0)',number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 68.3 µs per loop
sage: timeit('erf(0.1)',number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 154 µs per loop
sage: timeit('erf(0.99)',number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 165 µs per loop
```

I attempted to fix this by using the old approach for the default precision, but it usually wound up being more expensive to do the tests.  Someone with better speed-fu is encouraged to look at it.  I haven't finished a long testall yet, so there's probably something somewhere which breaks, but here's the first attempt.

The patch looks really good. The only problem I spotted after a quick reading is that the code blocks in the documentation should be after `::`. If the `TESTS` title is followed by text, you don't need the `::` after that.

AFAIR, mpmath now supports extracting the precision from the input type in Sage. It is not necessary to do this in each calling function any more. I don't have an example handy though.

For examples of fast methods to check the type of the input you can look at `sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx`. If you replace the `PY_TYPE_CHECK()` calls with `isinstance()` you should get a reasonable speed from python.

@burcin:

Okay, so just to be clear: EXAMPLES and TESTS don't need trailing colons, whether double or single (although double does seem pretty common; is it okay to use it?), but I should definitely use a double colon after test descriptions, e.g.

```
TESTS[::?]

Test that addition works::

    sage: 2+3
    5

Test that subtraction works::

    sage: 3-2
    1

```

instead of

```
TESTS::

Test that addition works:

    sage: 2+3
    5

Test that subtraction works:

    sage: 3-2
    1
```

That's easy enough to fix.  The other two will take a bit more work, but I'll see what I can find.  Examples to pattern after are very welcome.  `:-)`

{

<a id='comment:15'>Comment 15:</a>
Here's another thing that should be added, reported by one of the PREP workshop participants before this patch was in:

```
erf(4500).n()
1.0000000
erf(45000).n()
<boom>
```
So Pari was not handling big number in erf before.  With this patch, though

```
sage: erf(4500).n()
1.00000000000000
sage: erf(45000).n()
1.00000000000000
sage: erf(4500000000).n()
1.00000000000000
```
Since none of the doctests in the current patch seem to test "big" real input to erf, we should add this too.

So, to review:
* Burcin and I want a small formatting change so the doc would build correctly.
* Burcin wants the speed to be fixed using the thing referenced at #11143, using the patch at #11513.
* I want a doctest that checks big numbers will work (as in [comment 15](#comment%3A15)).
* Paul and I want a doctest for #11626, to verify it is fixed.
* Burcin *recommends* calling mpmath without prec as at #11143.

This would make this depend on #11513.  I'm still a little skeptical on this; will we really not get any wrong answers with that?

the current patch already contains examples with prec=100, both for real and complex numbers,
and thus is fine to me.

Now I remember why I found this so frustrating.  I rewrote the patch following -- plagiarizing is more like it! -- the pattern used in #11143, but the speed issue hasn't gone away.  

```

# 4.7.1, OS X 10.6.8
sage: timeit('erf(0.1)',number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 82.9 µs per loop
sage: timeit('erf(10.0)',number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 72.8 µs per loop
sage: timeit('erf(100.0)',number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 73.5 µs per loop

# 4.7.2 before patch
sage: timeit('erf(0.1)',number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 69.4 µs per loop
sage: timeit('erf(10.0)',number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 62.6 µs per loop
sage: timeit('erf(100.0)',number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 62 µs per loop

# 4.7.2 after patch
sage: timeit('erf(0.1)',number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 137 µs per loop
sage: timeit('erf(10.0)',number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 116 µs per loop
sage: timeit('erf(100.0)',number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 116 µs per loop

sage: import mpmath
sage: timeit('mpmath.erf(0.1)')
625 loops, best of 3: 95 µs per loop
sage: timeit('mpmath.erf(10.0)')
625 loops, best of 3: 75.4 µs per loop
sage: timeit('mpmath.erf(100.0)')
625 loops, best of 3: 76.2 µs per loop

```

That is, there's about a factor of two penalty in speed for the standard case, but it's not because the underlying mpmath code is slow:

```
sage: timeit('mpmath.erf(0.1r)')
625 loops, best of 3: 27.7 µs per loop
sage: timeit('mpmath.erf(10.0r)')
625 loops, best of 3: 9.85 µs per loop
sage: timeit('mpmath.erf(100.0r)')
625 loops, best of 3: 9.95 µs per loop
```

In fact, mpmath isn't that much slower than MPFR:

```
sage: z = RR(2); timeit('z.erf()')
625 loops, best of 3: 20 µs per loop
sage: z = 2.0r; timeit('mpmath.erf(z)')
625 loops, best of 3: 57.9 µs per loop
sage: timeit('erf(2.0)') # new code
625 loops, best of 3: 181 µs per loop
```

So not much of the total time is spent actually doing any calculations: it's all overhead.  :-(  This affects #11143 as well:

```
sage: timeit('exp_integral_e1(2.0)')
625 loops, best of 3: 165 µs per loop
sage: z = exp_integral_e1(2); timeit('z.n()')
625 loops, best of 3: 143 µs per loop
sage: timeit('exponential_integral_1(2.0)')
625 loops, best of 3: 44.7 µs per loop
sage: timeit('mpmath.e1(2.0)')
625 loops, best of 3: 123 µs per loop
sage: timeit('mpmath.e1(2.0r)')
625 loops, best of 3: 51 µs per loop

```


To wrap up:

(1) Both this patch and #11143 suffer a significant slowdown relative to PARI, and have major overheads relative to calling mpmath.  Some of that's unavoidable given the symbolic path, but ISTM we should be able to do better.  Ideally there would be a reasonably efficient general special function implementation pattern, along the lines of what Benjamin used, that intermittent developers like me could be pointed to as a reference.

(2) In the case of erf and erfc, mpfr offers a very fast evaluation for real numbers, fast enough that it might be worth using as the default in those cases (although Python-level branching is slow in my experience, maybe slow enough to wash away the benefits).  Once we settle on an approach for erf I'll do the same for erfc.

(3) Should I move this out of other.py to special.py, where the complementary error_fcn function lives now?  It would seem a more natural location for it.  We also have some unfortunate naming (erf and error_fcn) it might be worth addressing.

I don't have numbers for #11948 -- too many dependencies -- but it's probably considerably faster than this approach.  I figure it's probably worth getting the #11143 -style mpmath wrapper to be faster, though, even if we went #11948 instead for erf/erfc.

[There are a few doctest failures: "devel/sage/doc/en/bordeaux_2008/l_series.rst", which I think is unrelated; a timeout in devel/sage/sage/modules/free_module.py, again probably unrelated.]

I agree that we should do better. Note that the pattern you request is being developed in #11143  and here. Even though pynac based symbolics was merged in Sage quite a while ago, it hasn't been used properly yet.

The code path to call symbolic functions is rather convoluted. This is inevitable since symbolic functions have to play well with many different subsystems, such as fast float, numpy, etc. But it should still be possible to reduce the overhead.

For `BuiltinFunction`s the code path for evaluation goes through `Function.__call__()` in `sage/symbolic/function.pyx`, then into pynac, then to the python method you define for `_eval_()`, if numeric evaluation is needed to `_evalf_()` later. Here, between the python and C++ code, conversion functions are called to wrap pynac objects in Expression instances or to remove these wrappers.

I believe most of the overhead comes from the `__call__()` method, then having to decide if the arguments are numeric in `_eval_()`, and checking if an argument is zero (#11513).

> (2) In the case of erf and erfc, mpfr offers a very fast evaluation for real numbers, fast enough that it might be worth using as the default in those cases (although Python-level branching is slow in my experience, maybe slow enough to wash away the benefits).  Once we settle on an approach for erf I'll do the same for erfc.

MPFR should be the default numeric evaluation method if it is available. In general, it's better to let the types choose the numeric evaluation method. Most special functions in Sage first see if an object implements a method with the same name first and calls that. For instance `erf()` should call `.erf()` for element of `RR`.

I see that for subclasses of `GinacFunction` the `__call__()` method does this automatically. This is not used for other `BuiltinFunction`s though. It might make sense to move this method to `BuiltinFunction`. This would speed up most of the timings for real numbers above.

Unfortunately, floats would still go through the long path. Since these are used quite often in plotting, perhaps we should add a special case in `__call__()` to go directly to `_evalf_()` as well.

I made this change in [attachment: trac_1173-move_call.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1173/trac_1173-move_call.patch.gz)Now I get:

```
sage: t = RR(2.0)
sage: %timeit z = t.erf()
625 loops, best of 3: 16.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit z = erf(t)
625 loops, best of 3: 18.2 µs per loop
```

Performance for `float` is still pretty bad.

```
sage: u = 2.0r
sage: %timeit z = erf(u)
625 loops, best of 3: 156 µs per loop
```

I didn't check if this patch breaks anything.

> (3) Should I move this out of other.py to special.py, where the complementary error_fcn function lives now?  It would seem a more natural location for it.  We also have some unfortunate naming (erf and error_fcn) it might be worth addressing.

I don't think there is a need to move this to `special.py`. That file is also overcrowded and needs serious cleanup. You could create a new file names `error_fn.py` if you think that's necessary.

What names do other systems use for these functions? AFAIK, `erf()` and `erfc()` are pretty much standard. I wonder where `error_fcn()` came from.

```

Now not only is there no regression, we've improved.  The speedups relative to alpha3 for reals are due to using the existing mpfr .erf()s instead of pari; float was special-cased through RDF.  As I mentioned, I don't have the new pari, and that's probably faster than mpmath.  But at least it's not killing me anymore.

There's a doctest failure in gamma_inc due to trac_1173-move_call.patch, I think-- formerly,

```
sage: parent(gamma_inc(RDF(1),3))
Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
```
but now 

```
sage: parent(gamma_inc(RDF(1),3))
Real Double Field
```

but gamma_inc doesn't preserve types the way I'd have expected.  Anyway, I think this is a step in the right direction.

I started to review the patch. Looks like:

* The only dependency is #11513 which should be applied before [trac_1173_complex_erf_v3.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1173/trac_1173_complex_erf_v3.patch.gz)
* All of the work issues are taken care of
* #11513 hasn't changed since Burcin uploaded the initial draft patch. I don't have the expertise to work on it or else I would in support of the various tickets we've got now that depend on it. 

The patch trac_1173_complex_erf_v3.patch applies to 4.8.alpha3 cleanly (as does the patch at #11513) and all doctests pass. 

It also looks like the "move call" patch should be applied to speed things up after some doctests are fixed. I'd say this should go into a new ticket because the issue is independent of evaluation of erf() at complex inputs.

Positive review.

It certainly isn't out yet (and maybe it will never even exist if rc0 solves all our problems).  The easiest way to find out the latest development release is [http://www.sagemath.org/download-latest.html](http://www.sagemath.org/download-latest.html), accessible as www.sagemath.org -> Download -> Development Release.
Alternatively, look at the sage-release announcements.
