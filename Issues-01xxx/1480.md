Try this:

sage: z = mathematica('NIntegrate[x^2,{x,1,0}]'); z
-0.3333333333333338
sage: z + 3.5
3.166666666666666
sage: sin(float(z))

They are here:

I've never done this before or seen anybody do it.  I just figured out how.
As an example, paste the following two lines into an input cell and press shift-enter:

mathematica('SetDirectory["%s"]'%os.path.abspath("."))
_ = mathematica('Export["a.png", Plot[Sin[x],{x,-2Pi,4Pi}], ImageSize->600]')

The first complicated line above -- i.e., to set the directory, will not be needed 
in sage >= 2.9 -- I just made it automatic for future versions of sage.

Timothy Clemans points out that to get graphics to work remotely do:

```
Xvfb 19
export DISPLAY=localhost:19
```
then start the sage notebook server. 

This is discussed at 

 http://witm.sourceforge.net/installation.php

This should definitely somehow be in sage before this ticket is closed!

E.g., on failure a message could be printed out telling the user to do the
above... and something like this could be in the docstring for the new show command.
