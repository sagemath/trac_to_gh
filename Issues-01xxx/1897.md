12:46 < ianxek> hi there
12:47 < ianxek> A Latex question in sage : if I define a variable say x=3 and later on use the
                %latex environment and use $\sage{x}$ then it says x is unknown
12:48 < ianxek> How do I tell sage to access the previously defined x ?
13:03 < sage> This is a bug in Sage!
13:03 < sage> However, here is a workaround until it gets fixed.
13:03 < sage> ianxek.
13:03 < sage> latex.eval('$2+\sage{a}$', locals=globals())
13:03 < sage> I.e., instead of typing %latex in the cell, do 
13:04 < sage> latex.eval("A latex string", locals=globals())
13:04 < sage> And you'll see the variables properly.
13:04 < sage> Thanks for asking this question.
```

I think the problem involves system.eval not getting passed the
globals() dictionary correctly...

This fixes the problem for me.  TimothyClemans, you need a bunch of things for this to work, like dvipng, etc.  Can you latex any slides at all?
