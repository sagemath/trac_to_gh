SAGE has a built-in copy of the complex numbers, so it knows what I is. However, one gets slightly odd behaviour from this:

`sage: (1+I)^2 - 2*I`

`(1+I)^2 - 2*I`

and one has to use the .expand() command to get the correct answer 2*I. This is not the behaviour of a user-defined quadratic field, which automatically evaluates such things. I think that the computation should resolve to 0 without having to be expanded.

This behavior of the symbolic I is imposed by Maxima.  I do not know if there is any way to change it to behave like you want.   You might want to use the I of the number field QQ(sqrt(-1))...  

```
sage: I = NumberField(x^2 + 1, 'I').gen()
sage: (1+I)^2 - 2*I
0
```

Some day (who knows when) probably the Sage "I" will be the number field I, but where the number field is equipped with a canonical embedding in the symbolic ring, and then your example above will work as you want.  I don't know when this will happen.  It might not be too hard to implement.

This is certainly on the TODO list... currently for a number field 

```
sage: I = NumberField(x^2 + 1, 'I').gen()
```

it doesn't know whether to send I to -I or I in `CC`, and a mechanism for this needs to be implemented.

Number fields now have embedddings, and these are used by the Pynac Symbolics. When that goes in, this ticket should be closed.
