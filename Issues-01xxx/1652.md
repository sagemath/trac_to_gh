G4 has a loop: 2->4 and 4->2


```
G4 = DiGraph({1:[2,2,3,5], 2:[3,4], 3:[4], 4:[2,5,7], 5:[6]}, multiedges=True)
G4_path.count()

RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
```


There are related issues calulating *incoming_paths* and possibly more in *sage.combinat.graph_path*!

ah, solution is very simple: just check if **G4.is_directed_acyclic()** is true ;)

Could you be more specific? I have no idea what G4_path is. Also, could you post a full traceback?
