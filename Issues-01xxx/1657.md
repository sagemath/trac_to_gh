I have jmol building/installing from source, but in the interest of
saving time I am not going to go through the last step of making an
actual spkg out of it because I have not done this before and it will
probably take me some time to get it right.

Here is a .zip file that contains the files needed to create a spkg:

Fortunately, we don't need signing because we're using the unsigned version of the applets. 

Also, there are several dependancies that are simply provided as jars. These need to be built from source as well prior to building jmol. See COPYRIGHT.txt

I looked at it an tried it out and it works great for me (after deleting the "-v2" from the filename). 

Someone on a system with a minimal java install (Java + ant) should try it out too.
