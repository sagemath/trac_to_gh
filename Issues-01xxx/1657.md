I have jmol building/installing from source, but in the interest of
saving time I am not going to go through the last step of making an
actual spkg out of it because I have not done this before and it will
probably take me some time to get it right.

Here is a .zip file that contains the files needed to create a spkg:

I looked at it an tried it out and it works great for me (after deleting the "-v2" from the filename). 

Someone on a system with a minimal java install (Java + ant) should try it out too.
