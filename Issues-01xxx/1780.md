While mpfr 2.3.1 should be out shortly I integrated a patch from http://websympa.loria.fr/wwsympa/arc/mpfr/2008-01/msg00044.html

What happens is that mpfr uses alloca() instead of the default gmp allocator. alloca() uses the stack and on most modern systems causes segfaults by smashing the stack. One example is the following Sage code (by Paul Zimmermann):

```
sage: R=RealField(16777216)
sage: t=[]
sage: for n in range(1500):
   t.append(R(n)) 
```

The spkg at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-2.10/alpha3/mpfr-2.3.0.p1.spkg

fixes this issue and also adds build support for 64 bit MacIntel builds.

Cheers,

Michael
