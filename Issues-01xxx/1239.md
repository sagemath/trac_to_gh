Scripts were recently updated http://www.math.unicaen.fr/~simon/

It now handles two-torsion more uniformly, works on more curves, and actually returns points on the curve given. 

Component: **number theory**

John Cremona and I worked on this during Sage Days 6. 

The attached patches have the new version of the code (to be applied to extcode) and a revised interface. 

This also includes an implementation of transformations between different Weierstrass models.

WARNING: This is full of bugs and issues.  

E.g.,             

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0, 0, 1/216, -7/1296, 1/7776])
sage: F = E.global_integral_model(); F
outputs a non-integral model!
```

DO NOT apply this until further patche(s) are posted.

I'm working on some now.

ALSO -- there are many new functions with no doctets.
