It is mostly a work around for neron since the Sun compiler on there is busted. In fact, Sun stopped shipping their compiler suit for free [as in beer] many years ago, but recently started to offer them again for free [as in beer]. I can send a patch upstream, but the fix is trivial, i.e. replacing a hard coded `cc` in the makefile of the dik solver with `$(CC)`.\n\nCheers,\n\nMichael",

That sounds pretty trivial. I just emailed the author, with a link to this page.
