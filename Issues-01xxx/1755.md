<div id="comment:6" align="right">comment:6</div>

This is already implemented as block_matrix()

```
sage: A = random_matrix(ZZ, 2)
sage: B = random_matrix(ZZ, 2)
sage: C = random_matrix(ZZ, 2)
sage: D = random_matrix(ZZ, 2)
sage: block_matrix( [[A, B], [C, D]] )
[  1  -3| -1  -1]
[  0   0|  1   1]
[-------+-------]
[  0   0| -5   1]
[ -1   0|-10  31]
```

I don't think matrix() should create block matrices. It's possible that one would want a matrix of matrices rather than to merge the matrices together.
