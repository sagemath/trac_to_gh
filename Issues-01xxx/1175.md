Ok, while we fixed the issue in the python.spkg itself the same problem pops up when we install the mercurial.spkg. The spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/mercurial-0.9.5.p0.spkg

fixes that issue and actually creates an hg repo inside the spkk as well as does some general cleanup. Another python based spkg might still recreate those links, so this might not be over yet.

Cheers,

Michael
