Initially reported by Jaap:

```
sage -t  tut.tex                                            
**********************************************************************
File "tut.py", line 3574:
    : factor(f)
Expected:
    9 * (-x^5 + y^2)^2 * (x^6 - 2*x^3*y^2 - x^2*y^3 + y^4)
Got:
    (9) * (-x^5 + y^2)^2 * (x^6 - 2*x^3*y^2 - x^2*y^3 + y^4)
**********************************************************************

I'm not sure this change is bad though -- it's probably good using parens for
the unit part.  Though it looks dumb in this case.

You are right, it does look dumb, but this seems to be fallout from #1391, i.e. "bug in unit part of factorizations of multivariate polynomials". At least malb did fix a doctest in that patch in the same fashion. Care to review this trivial patch?

Cheers,
