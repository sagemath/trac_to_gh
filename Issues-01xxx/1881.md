Initially reported by Jaap:

```
sage -t  tut.tex                                            
**********************************************************************
File "tut.py", line 3574:
    : factor(f)
Expected:
    9 * (-x^5 + y^2)^2 * (x^6 - 2*x^3*y^2 - x^2*y^3 + y^4)
Got:
    (9) * (-x^5 + y^2)^2 * (x^6 - 2*x^3*y^2 - x^2*y^3 + y^4)

This is likely the "fault" of Ncalexan's recent changes to factorize.py.  
I'm not sure this change is bad though -- it's probably good using parens for
the unit part.  Though it looks dumb in this case.
