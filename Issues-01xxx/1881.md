This is likely the "fault" of Ncalexan's recent changes to factorize.py.  
I'm not sure this change is bad though -- it's probably good using parens for
the unit part.  Though it looks dumb in this case.

You are right, it does look dumb, but this seems to be fallout from #1391, i.e. "bug in unit part of factorizations of multivariate polynomials". At least malb did fix a doctest in that patch in the same fashion. Care to review this trivial patch?

Cheers,
