On Solaris I get the following doctest failures due to numerical noise:

```
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/rings/complex_double.pyx      
**********************************************************************
File "complex_double.pyx", line 1496:
    sage: z^2 - z + 1
Expected:
    2.22044604925e-16 + 1.11022302463e-16*I
Got:
    2.22044604925e-16 + 2.22044604925e-16*I
```
The attached patch fixes that.

Cheers,

Michael

We need another approach for this... what if on another machine, the imaginary component is exactly zero?

But let's cross that bridge when we come to it.

Looks good to me.
