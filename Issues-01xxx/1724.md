There is a way of creating modular forms from their Fourier expansions; for instance

```
S12=CuspForms(1,12)
PSR.<q>=PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
S12(q- 24*q^2 + 252*q^3 - 1472*q^4)
```
gives

```
q - 24*q^2 + 252*q^3 - 1472*q^4 + 4830*q^5 + O(q^6)
```

However, one needs strictly more than the Sturm bound's worth of Fourier coefficients to make this work:

```
S12(q+O(q^2))
```
gives

```
Exception (click to the left for traceback):
...
TypeError: q-expansion needed to at least precision 4
```

... as here the Sturm bound is 1.
