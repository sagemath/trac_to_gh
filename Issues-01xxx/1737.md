The following paraterization of the Mobius strip
takes a very long time and won't quit when ctl-c is
used:

```
sage: u,v = var("u,v")
sage: parametric_plot3d([cos(u)*(1+v*cos(u/2)), sin(u)*(1+v*cos(u/2)), v*sin(u/2)], (-2, 2), (-2, 2)).show()
^D
^CControl-C pressed.  Interrupting Maxima. Please wait a few seconds...
```
This error message repeats ever time you proess ctl-c.

This works much faster:
sage: parametric_plot3d([0.5*cos(u)*(1+v*cos(u/2)), 0.5*sin(u)*(1+v*cos(u/2)), v*sin(u/2)], (u,-2, 2), (v,-2, 2)).show()

and is more efficient.
