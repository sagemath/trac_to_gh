I have some doubt that John Voight's observation above has  to do with
Malb's speed regression report.    I think it's just that a particular way
of constructing elements in an order (coercing from a list) hasn't been optimized
one speck since when we implement orders a month ago.   And code that
has had zero optimization tends to be slow.  The sort answer is that *right now*
it's vastly faster to construct the element of the order via doing arithmetic
instead of explicitly coercing in a list, since we've optimized arithmetic more.
See the timings and examples in the worksheet below. 
```

Attached bundle partially addresses this issue, by implementing a fast QQ => quadratic number field element coercion. Currently this only affects implicit coercions, but when Robert+David's new coercion framework is finished, it should help explicit coercions too. But it still doesn't totally address the issue for this ticket.

Example:

```
def stupid_function(n):
    Z_F = NumberField(x^2-x-1, 't')
    y = Z_F.gen()
    u = 2/3
    for i in range(n):
        z = y + u

time stupid_function(50000)
```


Before:

```
Time: CPU 13.68 s, Wall: 14.07 s
```

After:

```
Time: CPU 0.25 s, Wall: 0.52 s
```

I think it's worth applying this patch, even if it doesn't solve the whole problem.

In my tests, it applied cleanly, sage/rings/number_field/* doctests still passed, and the code looks reasonable.  I approve.

Attachment: **[trac_1134.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1134/trac_1134.patch.gz)**

I posted a patch which adds a fast case for tuples / lists of coefficients in the power basis.  For the timings with Z_F, most of the time is spent checking the embedding.  I've added a check option to disable that check if you know that the element is already in the order.

The bundle which was attached had been previously merged in.

With some careful merge I was able to make the patch applied and work on sage-6.3.beta3. But, the map `list_to_quadratic_field_element` is completely useless as there is no gain at all. Moreover, it is one more map added to the list of conversions. So I would suggest to not add it with that ticket.

One interesting optimization in the ticket is the `check` parameter added to the `_element_constructor_`. Do you agree if I provide a branch that contains only that?

Also, as it was said in [comment:9](#comment%3A9) most of the time in the construction is spent in checking. So it would be worth to optimize it. The longest part comes from decomposing a vector on a given basis as the timings below show.

The construction takes roughly 600 micro seconds

```
sage: K = NumberField(x^2-x-1, 't')
sage: Z_F = K.maximal_order()
sage: x = K([5,1])
sage: %timeit Z_F(x)
1000 loops, best of 3: 674 µs per loop
```
But most of the time is spent in checking that some vector belong to some submodule

```
sage: %timeit K.vector_space()      # <--- this is very quick
1000000 loops, best of 3: 431 ns per loop
sage: embedding = K.vector_space()[2]
sage: embedding
Isomorphism map:
  From: Number Field in t with defining polynomial x^2 - x - 1
  To:   Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
sage: %timeit embedding(x)          # <--- this is quick
10000 loops, best of 3: 49.8 µs per loop
sage: v = phi(x)
sage: %timeit v in Z_F._module_rep  # <--- this is damn slow
1000 loops, best of 3: 608 µs per loop
```
And in `__contains__` of `FreeModule`, the mess comes from calling `coordinates` that decompose the vector on the basis of the module:

```
sage: V = Z_F._module_rep
sage: %timeit V.coordinates(v)
1000 loops, best of 3: 612 µs per loop
```
