Hi,

While reading http://sagemath.org/doc/html/tut/node47.html I noticed a
small typo:

"NO SAGE preparsing is applied to spyx files, e.g., 23 means exclusive
or rather than power. If foo is a function in the SAGE library, to use
it from a spyx file import sage.all and use sage.all.foo."

The "23" should be "^".

Best,
Jason
