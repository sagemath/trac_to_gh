In the interactive tutorial for SAGE, page "3.1 Your SAGE session", the documentation should make it clear that the %hist command does not work in the SAGE notebook, and that one cannot type in %hist and assume that it will work. It should also be noted that __ and _oh do not work in the notebook (although _ does).

Also, in the line "The PATHhastheSAGEbindirectoryatthefront,soifyourungp,gap,singular,maxima,etc.,yougettheversionsincludedwithSAGE. 
", it looks like an end-maths-environment symbol has been omitted.
