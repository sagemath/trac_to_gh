I am attaching two patches.  The first changes the _repr_ of Galois groups from the current clunky

```
Galois group PARI group [8, 1, 3, "E(8)=2[x]2[x]2"] of degree 8 of the number field Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 over its base field
```

to

```
Galois group PARI group [8, 1, 3, "E(8)=2[x]2[x]2"] of degree 8 of the Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 over its base field
```

The second patch is a documentation patch and fixes the optional doctest failures in tut.tex (and removes the #optional tag from one of them, since now by default GaloisGroup uses PARI instead of optional GAP packages).

Looks good to me.  There's a tiny typo in the first patch ("isreducible" needs a space), otherwise fine.
