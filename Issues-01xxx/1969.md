> Something like %history, but which writes the output to a file.

I just put it in SVN, as the new '-f flag'. This is what it looks like:

In [1]: hist -f foo
File 'foo' exists. Overwrite? n
Aborting.

In [2]: hist
1: _ip.magic("hist -f foo")
2: _ip.magic("hist ")

In [3]: hist -r
1: hist -f foo
2: hist
3: hist -r

In [4]: hist -rn
hist -f foo
hist
hist -r
hist -rn

In [5]: hist -rn -f foo
File 'foo' exists. Overwrite? y

In [6]: !cat foo
hist -f foo
hist
hist -r
hist -rn
hist -rn -f foo

See above, -r gives you the raw history always, and -n omits line numbers.


Let me know how this works for you.
