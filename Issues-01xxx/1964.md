This illustrates attaching multiple files not working.  I don't know if this was ever implemented, but if so it's broken now.  If not, I think it will be fairly easy (the code is in misc/something).

REVIEW without trying the code:

1. I just noticed this comment (by me) in the diffs (since you reformated it maybe): " It does not convert indexes into 1-d arrays, since those have to be ints. "
I think we actually do now:

```
sage: preparse('v[7]')
'v[Integer(7)]'
```

2. Wow, the doctests in interpreter.py are a disaster.  Thanks for fixing them in your patch!!!

3. Your refactoring of the big function into little functions is superb.

If I could actually try the code and see it working, I would give it an enthusiastic positive review.   I did also just try applying the bundle to stock 2.10.1, and it also has lots of conflicts.

Related to the reject the only doctest failure in misc that I get is:

```
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/misc/interpreter.py
**********************************************************************
File "interpreter.py", line 499:
    sage: 2/3
Expected:
    0
Got:
    2/3
**********************************************************************
```
It does look like the doctest failure above is somehow related to the reject.

Cheers,

Michael

REFEREE REPORT:

* I found a bug when testing this patch.  To replicate, create files a.sage and b.sage and put in a.sage

```
attach b.sage
```
in it.  This fails, but {{{attach "b.sage"} works.  This was a problem before this patch, so it is NOT the fault of this patch.   It's now trac #2310, which I've fixed. 

* I found a second bug when testing this patch.  Make a file a.sage, b.sage, and c.sage and put in a.sage

```
attach b.sage c.sage
```

Then attach a.sage.  Boom!  Attaching multiple files from within a file doesn't work.  This is in fact the main point of this ticket -- the user who showed me the bug was showing me it in that particular situation.  This point needs to be addressed.
From the command line attaching multiple files does work fine. 

* This patch reformats this comment in interpreter.py: "It does not convert indexes into 1-d arrays, since those have to be ints."  That comment is completely wrong.  Indexes *do* get converted to Sage ints.  I think I made this comment already somewhere above a few days ago.

* This reformatted comment in interpreter.py is also wrong: "Whenever you enter a blank line in the SAGE interpreter, *all* attached files that have changed are automatically reloaded."  It is NO LONGER necessary to enter a blank line to update attached files.  It used to be necessary, say 3 years ago.

* I think these two lines in interpreter.py that are added by this patch should be removed:

```
 	165	            #raise ImportError, "Loading of '%s' not implemented (load .py, .pyx, and .sage files)"%name 
 	166	            #line = '' 
```

* Regarding 

```
 	186	    \Sage does NOT guarantee that files are reloaded in the order that they 
 	187	    are attached!
```
I think it's dumb that we don't.  It wouldn't be hard to do.  If you agree, please open a separate trac ticket for that. If you disagree, please explain why, since then I disagree with you.

* This statement in the docs is wrong since attached is a dict instead of a list:

```
 	191	    Internally, an attached file name is put in the list \code{attached}
```
This isn't your fault -- I'm the one that made attached a dict...  But your patch would be a good place to fix this.

Nick, please address each of the above points.  In some cases the appropriate response should just be to make another trac ticket.

The patch against 3.0 updates the previous patch and addresses the referee's comments.

It does *NOT* address the load/attach in files issue.  I am going to look at that now, but I don't know how to fix it.  This should be merged regardless with what happens with issue.

Apply `1964-ncalexan-multiple-files-1.patch` second.
