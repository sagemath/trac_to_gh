I agree.  Note that libfpll is a brand new package in Sage (it does very fast LLL reduction,
so is quite important), but it hasn't been as widely tested as other components of Sage.

Ok, got feedback from Kate: It works on her x86-64 box and also builds fine for me on sage.math.

I've uploaded a new spkg to

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/pkgs/libfplll-2.1.3-20071117.spkg

which contains a cleaner fix than the package linked above by mabshoff. We shouldn't touch `Makefile.am` of the upstream package with SAGE specific fixes and thus I added that flag to `spkg-install`.
