I have a Cygwin build patch for setup.py that should be applied before anybody else touches setup.py with some major reorg patch. The is needed because the order of libraries matters on Cygwin. That patch is one of the first patches that I plan to merge for 2.10 as I am reluctant to merge it now for 2.9.2.\n\nCheers,\n\nMichael",
