The source is included here:
`local/lib/gap-4.4.10/pkg/guava3.1/src/leon/src`


I did a separate spkg for this software, which is here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/rlmill/leon-0.2.spkg

It includes autoconf tweaking goodness, etc. So the work for this is done, minus moving the autoconf stuff over to the gap-4.4.10 spkg. I'm assuming this should be upstream, in Guava itself.

I think two things need to happen.

1. Either Guava should be updated to compile all of Leon, or Leon should be made its own spkg (in non-dynamic mode for now), since maybe some of Leon's functionality isn't specific to coding theory.

2. Either way, the `spkg-install` for gap-4.4.10 needs to be updated to copy the pieces of Leon that do get compiled to the corresponding place in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib`.

    "body": "<a id='comment:13'>**Comment 13:**</a>\nOK, here's the full deal:\n\n1. `Makefile.in` in `gap-4.4.10.p3/src/pkg/guava3.3` lists only the programs `desauto` and `wtdist`, while the `Makefile` in `gap-4.4.10.p3/src/pkg/guava3.3/src/leon/src` contains instructions and dependencies for all the programs, including `setstab` (set stabilizer), `cent` (centralizer and conjugacy), etc.\n\n2. There are a number of `.sh` files in `gap-4.4.10.p3/src/pkg/guava3.3/src/leon/src` which make calling the other programs for more questions easy.\n\n3. The issue of memory leaks prevented Leon being used as a dynamically linked library. Compiling them as they are here is perfectly fine, since the process quits as soon as the computation is done. The only problem is overhead.\n\n4. There are also certain no-no's which I figured out the better way to do when linking Leon in dynamically, but that never made it back to Guava proper. For example, in `Makefile.in`, mentioned above, there is the line `DEFINES = -DINT_SIZE=32`, when obviously the right way to do this is to get configure to tell you.\n\nWith David's permission, I'd like to fix all of these up for Guava 3.3.1, or 3.4 or something. In addition, I'd like to fix up the spkg-install to make all of Leon's programs a little more easily accessible from Sage.",

OK, here's the full deal:

1. `Makefile.in` in `gap-4.4.10.p3/src/pkg/guava3.3` lists only the programs `desauto` and `wtdist`, while the `Makefile` in `gap-4.4.10.p3/src/pkg/guava3.3/src/leon/src` contains instructions and dependencies for all the programs, including `setstab` (set stabilizer), `cent` (centralizer and conjugacy), etc.

2. There are a number of `.sh` files in `gap-4.4.10.p3/src/pkg/guava3.3/src/leon/src` which make calling the other programs for more questions easy.

3. The issue of memory leaks prevented Leon being used as a dynamically linked library. Compiling them as they are here is perfectly fine, since the process quits as soon as the computation is done. The only problem is overhead.

4. There are also certain no-no's which I figured out the better way to do when linking Leon in dynamically, but that never made it back to Guava proper. For example, in `Makefile.in`, mentioned above, there is the line `DEFINES = -DINT_SIZE=32`, when obviously the right way to do this is to get configure to tell you.

With David's permission, I'd like to fix all of these up for Guava 3.3.1, or 3.4 or something. In addition, I'd like to fix up the spkg-install to make all of Leon's programs a little more easily accessible from Sage.

Latest Guava tarball here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/rlmill/guava3.4.tar

Latest GAP package here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/rlmill/gap-4.4.10.p4.spkg

Within Guava, this ensures that all of Leon's programs are compiled, and makes sure that they are available in `bin/leon`, together with the shell scripts. I have also left the desauto and wtdist execs where they were for backwards compatibility.

The latest GAP package (I checked in David's p3 changes to the hg repo, as well as my own changes) makes sure that all the binaries from Guava are copied to `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/gap-4.4.10/pkg/guava-3.4/bin`. The guava tarball is not necessary for Sage - its contents are contained in the GAP spkg.

Somebody has been adding crap files to the spkg again:

```
.hg
._.hg
.hgignore
._.hgignore
patches
._patches
._spkg-install
spkg-install
._SPKG.txt
SPKG.txt
src
._src
```
I did skip the 1,200 others. But I will remove all those crap files.

Cheers,

Michael
