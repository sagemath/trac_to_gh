The docstring examples look like they return RLF(1/2*sqrt(5) + 1/2).  Since phi is known to be algebraic, would it be ok to just return that?

"return (field(5).sqrt() + 1) / 2"

Works except for one test:

File "/home/donmorrison/sage46fromsrc/sage/devel/sage/sage/rings/qqbar.py",
line 135:
   sage: AA(golden_ratio)^2 - AA(golden_ratio)
Expected:
   1
Got:
   1.000000000000000?

The doctest could be changed to 
sage: bool(1 == AA(golden_ratio)^2 - AA(golden_ratio))
True

but Robert says that's not good.  What's the next step?

Sorry, I didn't notice there was special trac markup obscuring my last update.

The former and proposed doctests should read:

File "/home/donmorrison/sage46fromsrc/sage/devel/sage/sage/rings/qqbar.py",
line 135:
   sage: AA(golden_ratio)!^2 - AA(golden_ratio)
Expected:
   1
Got:
   1.000000000000000?

vs.

sage: bool(1 == AA(golden_ratio)!^2 - AA(golden_ratio))

True
