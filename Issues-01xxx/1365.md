Robert Bradshaw points out that golden_ratio._algebraic_ might as well synthesize the value, instead of using a special-purpose function in qqbar.py (and there's a patch to do this as part of Robert's patch at #1275).  But I want to make qqbar.py a bit more efficient for that case, before making the change.

<a id='comment:5'></a>"return (field(5).sqrt() + 1) / 2"

Works except for one test:

File "/home/donmorrison/sage46fromsrc/sage/devel/sage/sage/rings/qqbar.py",
line 135:
   sage: AA(golden_ratio)^2 - AA(golden_ratio)
Expected:
   1
Got:
   1.000000000000000?

The doctest could be changed to 
sage: bool(1 == AA(golden_ratio)^2 - AA(golden_ratio))
True

but Robert says that's not good.  What's the next step?

<a id='comment:6'></a>Sorry, I didn't notice there was special trac markup obscuring my last update.

The former and proposed doctests should read:

File "/home/donmorrison/sage46fromsrc/sage/devel/sage/sage/rings/qqbar.py",
line 135:
   sage: AA(golden_ratio)!^2 - AA(golden_ratio)
Expected:
   1
Got:
   1.000000000000000?

vs.

sage: bool(1 == AA(golden_ratio)!^2 - AA(golden_ratio))

True
