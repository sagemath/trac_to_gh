# Issue 1109: gp interface raises stack overflow exception if gp stack exceeds available memory

The gp interface automatically runs allocatemem() to double the Pari stack size if it gets a response back from gp that includes "the PARI stack overflows", and then re-executes the failing command.  However, if gp cannot grow the stack further, allocatemem() will simply print a warning message and do nothing; then the interface gets stuck in a loop.  (This gives a stack overflow, rather than an infinite loop, because the re-execution is handled by a recursive call.)

I'm attaching a patch that shows one way to fix this; it notices when allocatemem() fails and simply returns the original stack-overflow error message.  (I'm not sure if this is the best approach; would it be better to raise an exception here?  Somebody familiar with the gp interface should comment.)

On William's advice, I've revised my patch to raise an exception.  The new patch is 1109b.patch, which should be applied instead of 1109.patch.
