```

However, it needs careful review especially in the `LaurentSeries` department because I am not very experienced there.

Also, the bundle contains some old patches as well, if that presents a problem, I'll provide clean patches instead.

I say apply both patches.

I think that the Laurent series patch touches coercion code that will be completely rewritten soon, so I'm not worried that it's not particularily general.

There is an unclear comment in the hilbert_polynomial docstring.  The comment could be removed.  From IRC:

```
ncalexan: malb: let's took 1793.
[3:12pm] ncalexan: The docstring to hilbert_polynomial says, ' This $d$ is called the index of regularity of
[3:12pm] ncalexan:  1116        $I$. '
[3:12pm] ncalexan: Which $d$?  The minimal one?
[3:13pm] malb: yes
[3:13pm] malb:  for all but finitely many positive  integers $d$
[3:14pm] malb: that encodes minimal for me?
[3:15pm] ncalexan: malb: that is unclear to me.  Is there a function to return the index of regularity?
[3:15pm] malb: no
[3:15pm] ncalexan: If not, I say drop the remark.  Or clarify it.  Why is it there?
[3:15pm] ncalexan: (The remark about $d$ being the index)
[3:15pm] malb: because there should be such a function
[3:15pm] malb: but I can drop it
[3:16pm] ncalexan: malb: is that easy to determine?  'cuz it would be useful :)
```
