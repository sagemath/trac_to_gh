The nullity() function for matrices is supposed to return the dimension of the kernel, but:

```
sage: M=Matrix(QQ,[[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,0],[1,1,1,0]])
sage: M.nullity()
1
sage: M.kernel().dimension()
0
```

The correct value is indeed 0.

Sorry, I should sleep more before filing bugs.  The nullity is indeed 1.  It is the kernel() function that seems to be broken.  For the matrix in question, it should be one-dimensional generated by [0,1,-1,0].

```
sage: M=Matrix(QQ,[[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,0],[1,1,1,0]])
sage: M

[1 0 0 1]
[0 1 1 0]
[1 1 1 0]
sage: M.kernel()

Vector space of degree 3 and dimension 0 over Rational Field
Basis matrix:
[]
```

OK, so it's again a left-versus-right thing, see #1607.  But the documentation for nullity() clearly states that it is the dimension of the kernel(), which definitely is not happening at the moment, so we need to do something about it.
