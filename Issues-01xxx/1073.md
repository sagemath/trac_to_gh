This would save people a lot of confusion.

```
$ sage -pkg foo-bar-2.3
...

Created package foo-bar-2.3.spkg, 

NAME: foo
VERSION: bar-2.3      (not version number looks suspicious)
SIZE: 2.3MB
HG REPO: Unchecked in changes (!)
SPKG.txt: File is missing.

Please test this package using
    sage -f foo-bar-2.3.spkg
immediately.   Also, note that you can use 
    sage -pkg_nc foo-bar-2.3
to make an uncompressed version of the package (useful if the
package is full of compressed data).
