I'm reading calculus.py (this is probably the best way to learn SAGE).
This statement seems wrong to me:

```
\sage predefines upper and lowercase letters as global
    indeterminates.
```
Indeed, I believe only 'x' is predefined.

Component: **documentation**

This used to be true, but it caused way too much confusion, so we changed it.  But forgot to change the docs.
