A small annoyance -- the ordering on the lists below is different:

```
sage: R.<fx,fy,gx,gy> = ZZ[]
sage: F = ((fx*gy - fy*gx)^3)
sage: F
-1*fy^3*gx^3 + 3*fx*fy^2*gx^2*gy - 3*fx^2*fy*gx*gy^2 + fx^3*gy^3
sage: F.monomials()
[fx^2*fy*gx*gy^2, fy^3*gx^3, fx*fy^2*gx^2*gy, fx^3*gy^3]
sage: F.coefficients()
[-3, -1, 3, 1]
```

`F.coefficients?` says
"The order the coefficients appear in depends on the ordering used on self's parent."
`F.monomials?` says
"Returns list of all monomials which occure in this multivariate polynomial."

I think the latter should be changed.

Looks like monomials and coefficients line up, but it's not in the same order as they print?

While we're here:

The elements of list() don't have the correct types -- the final line should be a libsingular poly as well:

```
sage: R.<x, y> = QQ[]
sage: (x + y).monomials()
[x, y]
sage: type((x + y).monomials()[0])
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular'>
sage: list(x + y)[0]
(1, x)
sage: type(list(x + y)[0][-1])
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_element.MPolynomial_polydict'>
```

I think that ZZ mpolys doc-string for monomials should read 

```
        Return the list of monomials in self. The returned list is
        ordered by the term ordering of self.parent().
```
just like for QQ mpolys.
