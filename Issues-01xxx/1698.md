Has anybody ever built or used PolyBoRi on Linux *ITANIUM*?  
Because I just tried and the simplest
use of it from Sage segfaults PolyBoRi.   Since Itanium is 
supposed to be supported Sage platform this is very
serious:

sage -t --gdb pbori.pyx

SIGSEGV
boost::intrusive_ptr<polybori::CCuddCore>::operator-> (this=0x0)
   at ...intrusive_ptr.hpp:120
120         return p_;

(this was typed in by me manually just now). 

Any ideas?!   If necessary I can loan you the password I  have to an itanium box, but
hopefully one of you has access to an Itanium Linux machine.

Since Kate reported building 2.10 on Linux/Itanium and it passing doctests except #1898 the issue reported above is probably something system specific.
