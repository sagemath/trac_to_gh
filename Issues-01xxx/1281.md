```
[10:24] <mabshoff> I think we should change the failure message if Sage fails to compile to first check 
[10:24] <mabshoff> if it is the latest version and try that before contacting the lists
[10:25] <williamstein> sure.  make it so.
[10:25] <mabshoff> It should also mention to gzip up the log somewhere and post a link instead of sending 
[10:25] <mabshoff> a couple MB to 230+ people.
[10:25] <williamstein> agreed.
[10:25] <mabshoff> Ok, will open tichet.
```

Cheers,

Michael
