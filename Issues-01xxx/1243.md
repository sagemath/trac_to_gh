In Section 11.1 of the SAGE Reference Manual, there are the following typos:

Return arithmatic sequence -> Return arithmetic sequence

Best illistrated by examples. -> Best illustrated by examples

emtpy -> empty

We check whether certain integers are a some -> We check whether certain integers are a sum

The following use to fail -> The following used to fail

In "newton_method_sizes()", there is a ceil in the LaTeX which should be a \ceil

In the Programming Guide, Section 2.3:

SuperingularModule code -> SupersingularModule code

please let William Stein! -> please let William Stein know!
