They definitely very useful sometimes.  E.g., there is something
called the elliptic curve factorization method that is a brilliant trick
to factor integers.  You want to factor an integer N so you pretend
that it is prime, do a bunch of arithmetic with N, and if something goes
wrong, the error message gives just the information you need to factor N.
But it's important that the error message be an exception that you can
catch and that can contain some interesting Python data in it.  Custom
exceptions work very nicely for that. 

(This used to be trivial to implement in Sage, but for some reason
Sage changed and now it is isn't... :-(

sage: E = EllipticCurve(Integers(15),[1,-1])
sage: P = E.point([1,0,1], check=False)
goes boom but didn't used to...

after creating E and before attempting to create points.

I rather expected this reaction -- but look, the *only* cases where this makes any difference is precisely the case of an "elliptic curve over Z/NZ".

There is absolutely no effect from this patch on any elliptic curve defined over a field;  and I think this is much less dangerous than William's fix of telling a non-field to pretend that it is a field, surely?

We could ask for a vote...
