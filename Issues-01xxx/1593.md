Also, there is a bug in algorithm = "classical", since it doesn't
check for mutability and doesn't clear the cache.

the attached patch adds 'classical' to the docstring of `echelonize`. The remark about `algorithm="classical"` is invalid because the called method `_echelon_in_place_classical` does check for mutability and clears the cache. See `matrix2.pyx` for details.
