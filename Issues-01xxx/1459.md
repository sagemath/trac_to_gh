You should make sure to run doctests (no pun intended):

```
**********************************************************************
File "sageinspect.py", line 404:
    sage: sage_getdoc(None)
Expected:
    ''
Got:
    'x.__init__(...) initializes x; see x.__class__.__doc__ for signature'
**********************************************************************
