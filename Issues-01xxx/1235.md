Maxima stupidly decides there is no solution.  This is clearly a bug.  This
is the sort of bug in Sage that is very difficult for us to fix since it's really
a bug in Maxima, and it's entirely possible that maxima developers would
not even call it a bug.  But clearly it is, since it's a mathematically incorrect result. 

Here's what happens when you try this in Maxima directly:

sage: !maxima
Maxima 5.13.0 http://maxima.sourceforge.net
Using Lisp CLISP 2.41 (2006-10-13)
Distributed under the GNU Public License. See the file COPYING.
Dedicated to the memory of William Schelter.
This is a development version of Maxima. The function bug_report()
provides bug reporting information.
(%i1) solve(0.004*(8*%e^-(300*t)-8*%e^-(1200*t))*(720000*%e^-(300*t)-11520000*%e^-(1200*t))+0.004*(9600*%e^-(1200*t)-2400*%e^-(300*t))^2=0, t)
;
`rat' replaced 0.004 by 1/250 = 0.004
`rat' replaced 0.004 by 1/250 = 0.004
(%o1)                                 []


I strongly encourage you to report this to the maxima list, if you agree that it is
a bug in Maxima. 

I think in the long-run Sage will have to completely implement its own solve
function, which is better than Maxima's.  Thoughts from Ondrej-sympy would be
appreciated here.

> sage: solve(v == 0,t)

Here maxima also gives the wrong answer:

sage: maxima(v == 0)
0.004*(9600*%e^-(1200*t)-2400*%e^-(300*t))=0
sage: maxima(v == 0).solve(t)
[]

Just to emphasize that in my opinion this is *definitely* a bug,
I've entered this into the tracker:

I don't like that meaning for solve, since it is misleading to me, and
is inconsistent. e.g., what about:

sage: solve(x^5 + x^3 + 1, x)
[0 == x^5 + x^3 + 1]

When there is no explicit solution, maxima usually returns something
to explicitly indicate this.

Also, as a data point, Maple returns an approximate solution if
it doesn't find an exact one:

sage: maple.eval('solve(38.40000000*exp(1)^(-1200*t)-9.600000000*exp(1)^(-300*t),
t)')
'.1540327068e-2'

Likewise with Mathematica:

sage: mathematica.eval('Solve[0.004*(9600/E^(1200*t) - 2400/E^(300*t))
## 0, t]')

Solve::ifun: Inverse functions are being used by Solve, so some solutions may
    not be found; use Reduce for complete solution information.

        {{t -> 0.00154033}}


sage: mathematica('x^5 + x^3 + 1 == 0').Solve(x)

{{x -> Root[1 + #1^3 + #1^5 & , 1, 0]},
 {x -> Root[1 + #1^3 + #1^5 & , 2, 0]},
 {x -> Root[1 + #1^3 + #1^5 & , 3, 0]},
 {x -> Root[1 + #1^3 + #1^5 & , 4, 0]}, {x -> Root[1 + #1^3 + #1^5 & , 5, 0]}}

Shouldn't we be able to write something that is way faster than Maxima?
What do people even benchmark in the context of calculus?

I don't know.  However, Ted, what do you think of the following, i.e.,
it is a way in Sage to solve your problem which is probably pretty
clean and flexible, and could certainly made a little more student
friendly?

sage: var('t')
sage: a = .004*(8*e^(-(300*t)) - 8*e^(-(1200*t)))*(720000*e^(-(300*t))
- 11520000*e^(-(1200*t))) +.004*(9600*e^(-(1200*t)) -
2400*e^(-(300*t)))^2
sage: from scipy.optimize import brentq
sage: # Given two points x, y such that a(x) and a(y) have different sign, this
sage: # brentq uses "inverse quadratic extrapolation" to find a root of a in the
sage: # interval [x,y].  It has lots of extra tolerance and other options.
sage: brentq(a, 0, 0.002)
0.00041105140493493411
sage: show(plot(a,0,.002),xmin=0, xmax=.002)

I.e., what we provide an numerical_root method so that
    a.numerical_root(x,y)
would fine a numerical root of a in the interval [x,y], if it exists?
It could be built on brentq.  The main thing we would have to add
is some sort of analysis to find x', y' in the interval so that a(x')
has different sign from a(y'), i.e., decide if there is a sign switch,
which could be doable for many analytically defined functions at least.
```

Seems good to me. Tested the patch (both parts).
It appears to work robustly in the cases I tried.
