According to INSTALL.txt: CPU-Throttling, you have to do

```
/usr/bin/cpufreq-selector -g performance
```
But with two cores you have to force the cpu1 to run at its peak frequency:

```
As root:
cp /sys/devices/system/cpu/cp0/cpufreq/scaling_governor \
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cp1/cpufreq/scaling_governor
```

We need to detect if power management is enabled and set some non-performance mode. Otherwise print a warning and ask for confirmation to continue.
