Justin Walker reports:

```
The only problem with the build is this, with readline:

Configured with: /var/tmp/gcc/gcc-5465~16/src/configure --disable-
checking -enable-werror --prefix=/usr --mandir=/share/man --enable-
languages=c,objc,c++,obj-c++ --program-transform-name=/^[cg][^.-]*$/s/
$/-4.0/ --with-gxx-include-dir=/include/c++/4.0.0 --with-slibdir=/usr/
lib --build=i686-apple-darwin9 --with-arch=apple --with-tune=generic  
--host=i686-apple-darwin9 --target=i686-apple-darwin9
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5465)
i686-apple-darwin9-gcc-4.0.1: -compatibility_version only allowed  
with -dynamiclib
i686-apple-darwin9-gcc-4.0.1: -compatibility_version only allowed  
with -dynamiclib
make[3]: *** [libreadline.5.2.dylib] Error 1
make[3]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
make[3]: *** [libhistory.5.2.dylib] Error 1
make[2]: [install-shared] Error 2 (ignored)

FWIW, this same error crops up in a standalone build of readline, but  
it kills the build.  Sage seems to be unconcerned.

The same issue applies to termcap. On 10.5 we end up with only static libraries.

Craig Citro says:

```
Since we're mentioning it, there's a known issue with the readline
build on certain platforms, which you can spot by looking at your
install.log at the section where readline gets installed. I don't know
why these would be related, and Michael Abshoff is suspicious -- which
probably means I'm wrong :) -- but if I were motivated to look, I'd
probably start there. This is trac ticket #1259. It's easy to get the
build problems to go away, but I'm not sure if it's the "right" way to
do so -- if you untar the readline package, go into src/support, and
look at shobj-conf. If you edit line 145 to say:

darwin[89]*)

and line 174 to start with

     darwin[789]*)

then it builds with no errors. However, if you look at what you're
doing, you're basically just telling the builder to use the same
options for 10.5 (which is what I assume Darwin9 is?) as it uses on
Darwin 8. I have absolutely no idea whether or not that's a wise idea.

Once one does this, you could try rebuilding all of Sage with the new
readline package, and seeing if you get the same troubles.
```

Cheers,

Michael
