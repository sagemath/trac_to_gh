Hi, I had a single, easy to fix merge conflict:

```
<<<<<<< /scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-2.10.3.rc0/devel/sage-main/sage/graphs/graph.py.orig.1734827483
from sage.graphs.graph_coloring import chromatic_number, chromatic_polynomial
||||||| /tmp/graph.py~base.vsk2R5
=======
from sage.rings.rational import Rational
```
The above was caused by the work on the chromatic number and chromatic polynomial by Tom.

Cheers,

Michael
