Another problem reported by Emmanuel Thome: the following symbolic links are absolute with respect to the
build directory of SAGE, thus won't work any more after "make install":

```
$ find sage-2.8.13/ | while read f ; do [ -h "$f" ] && [ ! \
-e "$f" ] && ls -l "$f" ; done
lrwxrwxrwx 1 zimmerma spaces 41 2007-11-22 11:03 sage-2.8.13/sage/local/bin/bzc\
