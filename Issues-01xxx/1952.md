[21:30] <wstein-1649> one thing about #1940...
[21:30] <wstein-1649> If you're comparing two ideals, it might make sense to use the term ordering for which
[21:30] <wstein-1649> computing groebner basis is *easy*.
[21:31] <wstein-1649> E.g., wrt one order it can be super super hard, and wrt to another, quite easy.
[21:31] <mabshoff> Yep. That sounds like a great idea.
[21:31] <mabshoff> i.e. degrevlex per default.
[21:31] <mabshoff> Ticket?
[21:31] <wstein-1649> But in malb's code for #1940 he just uses whatever term order.
[21:31] <mabshoff> Well, I think he caches the gbasis, so in some cases it might already exist.
[21:32] <wstein-1649> Also, he doesn't even seem to check that other is an ideal.
[21:32] <wstein-1649> Also, if the two ideals are in the same ring but with two different term orders,
[21:32] <wstein-1649> that __cmp__ function will get the wrong answer.
[21:32] <mabshoff> mmh.
[21:32] <mabshoff> I guess reopen, but leave the patch applied?
[21:32] <wstein-1649> I think his patch perfectly addresses the given #1940.
[21:32] <wstein-1649> But there should be another trac ticket about my points above.
[21:33] <wstein-1649> Yeah?
[21:33] <mabshoff> Yep.
[21:33] <wstein-1649> Can you open it and maybe paste this discussion in?
[21:33] <mabshoff> Already on the way :)
[21:33] <wstein-1649> cool.

cwitty: wstein-1649, what do you mean "in the same ring but with two different term orders"?  Doesn't Sage treat the term order as part of the ring?
[3:46pm] wstein-1649: yes.
[3:47pm] wstein-1649: cwitty -- what if I make two QQ[x,y]'s with two different term orders.  But then I define ideals I, J generated by (x,y) and (x,y).
[3:47pm] wstein-1649: Shouldn't I == J be true?
[3:47pm] wstein-1649: But with Malb's code, it would be false, sort of by accident.
[3:48pm] cwitty: I guess I don't really care whether I==J is true or not.
[3:48pm] wstein-1649: ?
```

Maybe I'm just confused.  In any case, some further thought here would be a good idea.   Mainly relevant is optimization.
