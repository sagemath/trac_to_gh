```
from sage.plot.plot3d.all import Sphere
Sphere(.1).translate(1,2,3).show()
```

does not adjust the viewpoint, etc. to include the sphere, so it confusingly looks like a blank plot until, for example, the interactive version is rotated around.  It would be nice to have at least some part of the plot, if not the whole thing, visible by default.

I've done a little bit of work on bounding boxes, this is what I think we should be using. (There are more sophisticated bounding methods, but I don't think we'll need them for out application.)
