Arrg, the bit of the patch in coerce.pyx causes segfaults. So the patch is backed out, but the spkg is still in.

Ondrej: Either open a new ticket and resubmit the patch or reopen this ticket.

Hehe, I assumed you ran testall, especially after touching coerce.pyx. I tagged this against 2.9 for now. It will automatically get moved forward every time we complete a milestone.

I also changed the summary to reflect the remaining issue.

Yeah, I am still learning how to properly contribute to SAGE. :)

**Attachment:** [sympy2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1189/sympy2.patch.gz)

The patch was fixed, now it passes all tests:

But probably needs some review before committing.

I was not able to apply sympy2.patch cleanly against Sage 2.8.14. 

That said, I think _verify_canonical_coercion_c is the wrong thing to call here--please see the attached change which should fix the segfault issue in a much cleaner way and allow stuff like
 

```
sage: Integer(1) + sympy.Symbol("x")
x + 1
