Arrg, the bit of the patch in coerce.pyx causes segfaults. So the patch is backed out, but the spkg is still in.

Ondrej: Either open a new ticket and resubmit the patch or reopen this ticket.

Hehe, I assumed you ran testall, especially after touching coerce.pyx. I tagged this against 2.9 for now. It will automatically get moved forward every time we complete a milestone.

I also changed the summary to reflect the remaining issue.

**Attachment:** [sympy2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1189/sympy2.patch)

The patch was fixed, now it passes all tests:

http://sagetrac.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/1189/sympy2.patch

But probably needs some review before committing.

That said, I think _verify_canonical_coercion_c is the wrong thing to call here--please see the attached change which should fix the segfault issue in a much cleaner way and allow stuff like

Unfortunately, I don't have time to do it (leaving to Spain tomorrow). But please use the original sympy.patch + sympy-coerce.patch from Robert, that should do the job.

Thanks a lot.

This is probably not the patches direct fault, but we need to fix the other segfault first before merging this. Sage not working on sage.math isn't really an option.

Sorry, Ondrej.
