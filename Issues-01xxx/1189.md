Arrg, the bit of the patch in coerce.pyx causes segfaults. So the patch is backed out, but the spkg is still in.

Ondrej: Either open a new ticket and resubmit the patch or reopen this ticket.

I was not able to apply sympy2.patch cleanly against Sage 2.8.14. 

That said, I think _verify_canonical_coercion_c is the wrong thing to call here--please see the attached change which should fix the segfault issue in a much cleaner way and allow stuff like
 

```
sage: Integer(1) + sympy.Symbol("x")
x + 1
```
