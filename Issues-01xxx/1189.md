<a id='comment:13'></a>I was not able to apply sympy2.patch cleanly against Sage 2.8.14. 

That said, I think _verify_canonical_coercion_c is the wrong thing to call here--please see the attached change which should fix the segfault issue in a much cleaner way and allow stuff like
 
```
sage: Integer(1) + sympy.Symbol("x")
x + 1
```
