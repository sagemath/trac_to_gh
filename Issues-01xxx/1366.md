If you do "sage -br" on a very very fast machine, it still takes nearly
10 seconds.  This is in a sense a bug, because it should take < 0.4 seconds.
It takes a long time, since the entire dependency graph for all .pyx files
is being computed every single time.  This information should somehow be cached,
which would vastly speed things up. 

I consider this a bug since the performance is so bad as to make "sage -br"
very painful.

I modified setup.py to cache dependency information. It would be nice to get some people who are modifying a lot of cython code right now to test it out and report any bugs; the modifications seem to work for me but they need to be tested a bunch.

This patch has two issues:

* adding new files breaks it (fixed by #1453)
* sage -ba is broken, probably because time stamps on files are not considered.

This is out for 2.9, but please resubmit after fixing in the next round.

Cheers,

Michael

Looks good.

I tried the following tests: touch a .pxi file, then rebuild; touch a .pxd file, then rebuild; touch a .pyx file, then rebuild; rebuild everything with "sage -ba"; create a new .pyx file, then rebuild.  All of these tests passed.

Apply only deps2.hg
