If you do "sage -br" on a very very fast machine, it still takes nearly
10 seconds.  This is in a sense a bug, because it should take < 0.4 seconds.
It takes a long time, since the entire dependency graph for all .pyx files
is being computed every single time.  This information should somehow be cached,
which would vastly speed things up. 

I consider this a bug since the performance is so bad as to make "sage -br"
very painful.

**Resolution:** fixed

I modified setup.py to cache dependency information. It would be nice to get some people who are modifying a lot of cython code right now to test it out and report any bugs; the modifications seem to work for me but they need to be tested a bunch.

This patch has two issues:

* adding new files breaks it (fixed by #1453)
* sage -ba is broken, probably because time stamps on files are not considered.

This is out for 2.9, but please resubmit after fixing in the next round.

Cheers,

Michael

The same testcase still fails (but in a different way now).  When I touch sage/rings/mpfi.pxi, and then run "sage -b", it now dumps me into a debugger.  Then, when I press Ctrl-D to exit the debugger, I get a backtrace.

```
cwitty@magnetar:~/sage-2.10.1$ ./sage -b

Looks good.

I tried the following tests: touch a .pxi file, then rebuild; touch a .pxd file, then rebuild; touch a .pyx file, then rebuild; rebuild everything with "sage -ba"; create a new .pyx file, then rebuild.  All of these tests passed.

Apply only deps2.hg
