If you do "sage -br" on a very very fast machine, it still takes nearly
10 seconds.  This is in a sense a bug, because it should take < 0.4 seconds.
It takes a long time, since the entire dependency graph for all .pyx files
is being computed every single time.  This information should somehow be cached,
which would vastly speed things up. 

I consider this a bug since the performance is so bad as to make "sage -br"
very painful.

<a id='comment:8'></a>This patch has two issues:

* adding new files breaks it (fixed by #1453)
* sage -ba is broken, probably because time stamps on files are not considered.

This is out for 2.9, but please resubmit after fixing in the next round.
