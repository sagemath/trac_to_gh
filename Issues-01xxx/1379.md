App is live at http://sagemath.timothyclemans.com/whatis/

The app is a pretty interactive box where users click the three definitions of Sage and see the definitions one at a time.

To implement on sagemath.org homepage download http://sagemath.timothyclemans.com/whatis/whatis.zip and place in root of sagemath.org 

Index.html is replaced, javascript, css file, images folder added.

I'm -1 on this
Problems:
* Hover images are only fetched when button is hovered over. Use a single image and use css to have it as a background-image to a div and change it's offset on hover. 
* Doesn't currently degrade gracefully.
* Is more confusing than the current site, which isn't aesthetically perfect but is pretty functional and does a good job of giving an overview of sage.

That said, the prose is pretty good and I can see the benefit of explaining sage in these terms.

-1, I don't see the benefit. This makes reading the website much harder (because it adds the need to click on stuff first) and doesn't add any benefit (at least for me).
