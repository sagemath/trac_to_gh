Update it to NOW:

```
Dear Colleagues,

I've released a new version of lcalc.

This release fixes some bugs (so please update), has improvements to some of the key
routines, especially for higher degree L-functions (i.e. deg >=3, and also for Maass forms),
and better handling of output precision.

The code can be downloaded from:
http://pmmac03.math.uwaterloo.ca/~mrubinst/L_function_public/CODE/

Please email me any bugs you notice.

Thanks,
```

The updated spkg at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.0/alpha5/lcalc-20080205.spkg

fixes a number of issues:

* update to to the latest release
* fix Solaris build
* add gcc 4.3 build support

This ticket also closes #449. For doctests to pass you need to apply trac_1626_lcalc_doctest_fix.patch.

The other three patches have been send upstream to Mike Rubinstein and will hopefully make it into the next upstream release.

Cheers,

Michael
