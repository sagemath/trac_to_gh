It is acsc, just like asin, etc.   This works fine:

sage: show(plot(acsc, 1,2))

RR(acsc(x)) makes no sense; you're pluggin a symbolic variable into
a lambda function, then trying to convert the result to a real field element.
You meant to do

sage: acsc = lambda x: float(abs(CDF(x,0).arccsc()))
sage: show(plot(acsc, 1,2))

Sorry sage is so hard to use!  What can we learn from the above?
The main problem is acsc versus arccsc, which caused confusion.
Should we change the names of the "arc" functions to arc* instead of a*?

Maple: uses arcsin:
sage: maple.eval('arcsin(1)')
'1/2*Pi'
sage: maple.eval('asin(1)')
'asin(1)'

Mathematica: uses ArcSin:
sage: mathematica.eval('ASin[1]')
       ASin[1]
sage: mathematica.eval('ArcSin[1]')

       Pi
       --
       2

Maxima: Uses asin (which is why we currently do):
sage: maxima.eval('arcsin(1)')
'arcsin(1)'
sage: maxima.eval('asin(1)')
'%pi/2'


If nobody strongly objects in a day or two, I'll open a trac ticket
to change a*'s to arc*'s.  Better now than later.   And if something
like this is confusing David Joyner, then it's to be taken seriously.

This will do it.  I hope it isn't too ugly:

sage: v = [(csc(x),x) for x in srange(-2*float(pi),2*float(pi),0.1) if x]
sage: show(line(v), xmin=-20, xmax=20)

The tricks above:
  (1) use float(pi) so the iteration through the range of inputs is very fast
  (2) don't evaluate csc at 0.
  (3) use a line and flip the order of the points in the graph.
  (4) use xmin, xmax, since otherwise one large value will through
off the whole graph.

There is more work left to be done so that the functions always display as arcsin within Sage as well as making sure to treat them as asin when working with Maxima.


I will be posting a new patch here in the near future.
