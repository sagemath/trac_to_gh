The function eisenstein_series_qexp() has a parameter K which is supposed to say what field the coefficients of the series should live in, but it always returns rational coefficients:

```
sage: eisenstein_series_qexp(10,6,GF(5))
-1/264 + q + 513*q^2 + 19684*q^3 + 262657*q^4 + 1953126*q^5 + O(q^6)
sage: eisenstein_series_qexp(10,6,QQ)
-1/264 + q + 513*q^2 + 19684*q^3 + 262657*q^4 + 1953126*q^5 + O(q^6)
```

Craig: you're completely right about the a0inv thing, of course.  It's just that in the error message that we're raising I wanted to print the value of a0inv, and I couldn't think of a better way of doing it.
