```

In the tr_TR locale, lowercase of `I` is `ı`, and uppercase of `i` is `İ`. This might cause unexpected results for auto generated files.

A simple workaround is to clear the locale environment variables:

```
unset LANG LC_ALL LC_CTYPE
```

This sounds fine as a temporary workaround, but we need to do the following things:

* figure out if it happens with an unmodified python and numpy/scipy
* if not figure out what we did wrong
* alternatively report this upstream to the scipy people

scipy standalone build works fine on Pardus, I suspect this is due to our Python changes,

we build with following configure options added: --enable-unicode=ucs4 --with-wctype-functions

and we apply http://svn.uludag.org.tr/pardus/devel/system/base/python/files/default-utf8.patch

The ticket to switch to ucs4 is #551. The 2.10 release should be a good point in time to do the conversion since we will update a boat load of spkgs.

The problem remains, after the switch to ucs4, using a python built with the changes mentioned in [comment:2](#comment%3A2). 

Looking at the error message again, I don't see how this can be related to python. I can't find any other changes in the Pardus repository which might effect the scipy build. Ismail, any ideas?

I suggest clearing the LANG, LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE variables in the scipy spkg-install for now, as a work around.

scipy was upgraded with #3391, but this problem still remains. Error message is the same.

To reproduce the error, 

```
export LC_CTYPE=tr_TR.UTF-8
```

and build Sage as usual.

The SciPy 0.7.1 package included in Sage was done by Jason Grout, not by me. The setup.py packages of his package were more up-to-date, so his was included (also, he made his much earlier).
