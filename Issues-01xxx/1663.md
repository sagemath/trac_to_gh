```

In the tr_TR locale, lowercase of `I` is `ı`, and uppercase of `i` is `İ`. This might cause unexpected results for auto generated files.

A simple workaround is to clear the locale environment variables:

```
unset LANG LC_ALL LC_CTYPE
```

This sounds fine as a temporary workaround, but we need to do the following things:

* figure out if it happens with an unmodified python and numpy/scipy
* if not figure out what we did wrong
* alternatively report this upstream to the scipy people

scipy standalone build works fine on Pardus, I suspect this is due to our Python changes,

we build with following configure options added: --enable-unicode=ucs4 --with-wctype-functions

and we apply http://svn.uludag.org.tr/pardus/devel/system/base/python/files/default-utf8.patch

scipy was upgraded with #3391, but this problem still remains. Error message is the same.

```
export LC_CTYPE=tr_TR.UTF-8
```

and build Sage as usual.
