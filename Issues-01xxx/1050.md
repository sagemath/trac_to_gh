From the r7069/r7070 commit log message:

```
Merged the MASSIF2 branch to the trunk.  Main changes:

- ms_main.c: completely overhauled.

- massif/tests/*:  lots of them now.

- massif/perf/:  added.

- massif/hp2ps:  removed.  No longer used.

- vg_regtest: renamed the previously unused "posttest" notion to "post".
  Using it for checking ms_print's output.

Although the code has changed dramatically, as has the form of the tool's
output, the information presented in the output is basically the same,
although it's now (hopefully) much more useful.  So the tool name is
unchanged.
```
I should also add a spkg-check script to run the test suite, we are after all running code from the development branch.

Cheers,

Michael
