```
The following was reported by David Galant:

```
In the notebook, starting a block with '%octave' does not produce a
result.
This has been consistent throughout all releases of sage 2.*
The behavior is consistent on MacOS and Ubuntu Linux.
A sample session showing this is:
 
sage: from math import *
sage: sin(1)
0.8414709848078965
sage: gp.sin(1)
0.8414709848078965066525023216
sage: octave.sin(1)
0.841471
sage: %gp
sage: sin(1)
0.8414709848078965066525023216
sage: %octave
sage: sin(1)
 
sage: 3+2
5
sage: quit
Exited sage process
```

This is still an issue with 2.10.1 and when I now switch the Sage notebook at sagenb into octave mode it seems like only every second cell is evaluated.

It turns out that this is caused by the chdir command (which is run before each cell is evaluated) screwing up the syncronization.

This can also be fixed by improving the Octave interface to have better error detection.
