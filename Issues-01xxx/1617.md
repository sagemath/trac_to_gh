There is a huge speed difference. Any special reasons? A novice user would possibly not understand why!



```
var('x,y')
time p1=factor(x^99+y^99)

Time: CPU 0.05 s, Wall: 58.43 s
```



```
R.<x,y> = QQ[]
time p2=factor(x^99+y^99)

Time: CPU 0.06 s, Wall: 0.06 s
```

Component: **commutative algebra**

This is likely caused by using Maxima's factoring vs. Singular's libfactor. In the first case x and y are symbolic.

I vote for `wontfix` because I see no way of fixing this, this is a Maxima speed issue. The only fix I could think of is to add something about this in some documentation.

At least one comment is wrong in the patch since the "-" no longer shows up:

```
2288	2288	        Notice that the -1 factor is separated out: 
2289	2289	            sage: f.factor_list() 
2290	 	            [(-1, 1), (y - x, 1), (y^2 + x*y + x^2, 1)]
