Negative exponents put fraction field elements in the denominator of a fraction field element.

```
sage: R.<x>=ZZ[]
sage: (1/x)^-3
1/(1/x^3)
```

With the patch:

```
sage: R.<x>=ZZ[]
sage: (1/x)^-3
x^3
```
 

Component: **algebraic geometry**

Attachment: **[fraction_field_pow.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1738/fraction_field_pow.patch.gz)**

It looks good to me except change the somewhat too verbose

```
  sage: x = PolynomialRing(RationalField(),'x').gen() 
```
to one of the following (take your pick):

```
  sage: x = polygen(QQ, 'x')
```
or 

```
  sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
```
or 

```
  sage: x = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x').gen()
```

I think it is important that the docstrings give illustrations of good usage of Sage.

This is a duplicate of #1786.  I didn't realize that this was indeed the issue when opening #1786.
