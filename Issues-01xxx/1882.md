Phcpack has had many releases since the last spkg.  This brings it up to date as of January 21, 2008, with release 2.3.38.  I have changed the install script to python instead of a shell script, because that's what I know how to do.  I have also tried to add AIX support but I don't have a machine to test it on.

I have edited the installer slightly, please re-download this for putting in 10.2.3.

I have also added to the phc interface (in sage/interfaces) and fixed a typo of mine that incorrectly described the type of an output.  The new file is:
[www.d.umn.edu/~mhampton/phc.py]

This adds a command phc.mixed_volume that quickly computes the mixed volume of a polynomial system.

The spkg installs and appears to work on my 32-bit x86 Debian testing system.  However, the spkg does include some junk OSX files (._spkg-install, .DS_Store, etc.)

The patch includes a syntax error, which I fixed like this:

```

         if not os.path.exists(output_filename):
             raise RuntimeError, "The output file does not exist; something went wrong running phc."
```

After applying the patch and installing the spkg, testing phc.py (with -optional) failed with:

It looks like you may need to sort the results.  Also, printing dictionaries often gives different results on 32-bit vs. 64-bit systems (due to the different hash functions used); you may need to have "# 32-bit" and "# 64-bit" versions of the output.

I've attached a patch to fix some minor doctest issues.

1) add a missing "# optional"

2) improve (IMHO) the solution_dicts() doctest to make it clearer (IMHO) what the method returns, while still letting the doctest be portable

3) copy some doctests from a class docstring to a method docstring, to make "sage -coverage" happier

With this patch and phc-2.3.39, doctests pass in interfaces/phc.py, both with and without -optional.  Positive review.

In addition I put up the new SPKG.txt at

The SPKG has been uploaded to the optional repo and mirrored out.
