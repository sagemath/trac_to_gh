The parts of the preparser I wrote are:

sage: v = '1 + \
....: 3'
sage: v
'1 + 3'

But Robert B. wrote the really cool [n..m] parser code,
and unfortunately he appears to have written it in a way that
does not work correctly with \'s.  He'll undoubtedly see
this and fix it.

The problem is not specific to the [..] notation, but that the preparser processes things one line at a time. For example 

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField('\
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<ipython console>", line 1
     K = NumberField('\; (a,) = K._first_ngens(1)
                                                ^
<type 'exceptions.SyntaxError'>: EOL while scanning single-quoted string
```

We abuse the \ notation to have the same matrix solving property as Matlab too, but within strings it should be fine. I've been meaning to refactors the preparsing to make it more efficient, and will fix bugs like this at the same time.

The error was fixed at some point (probably long ago).  I put the given lines into a .sage file, and the corresponding .py file has a valid translation:

```
maple.eval('plotsetup(ps, plotoutput=`logplot.eps`, \
  plotoptions=`portrait,noborder,color`)')
maple.eval('plot(log(2*x), x=1..2,filled=true,color=yellow, \
  view=[.75..2.25,0..1.5])')
```
Also, the example in [comment:1](#comment%3A1) now gives the same error as equivalent code without a line break.

```
