in v2.10, after the build process is complete, change directories to devel/doc and run make html. This gives an emergency stop on \@mathbf when processing ref.toc. In order to successfully generate the HTML documentation I  had to first run 

sed -i -e "s/@mathbf/mathbf/g" ../doc-main/ref/ref.toc

which simply removed the unnecessary '@' sign before mathbf.

Component: **documentation**

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

In my experience, it also suffices to simply remove ref.toc.  Probably we should not be shipping this file at all.
