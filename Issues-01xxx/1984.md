in v2.10, after the build process is complete, change directories to devel/doc and run make html. This gives an emergency stop on \@mathbf when processing ref.toc. In order to successfully generate the HTML documentation I  had to first run 

sed -i -e "s/@mathbf/mathbf/g" ../doc-main/ref/ref.toc

which simply removed the unnecessary '@' sign before mathbf.

**Resolution:** fixed

In my experience, it also suffices to simply remove ref.toc.  Probably we should not be shipping this file at all.

This will be irrelevant once the Sphinx docs are in so I'm not going to work it.
