I have a patch that fixes the eigenvector issue with real and complex double matrices. All doc tests (including the above) pass with this patch and the new numpy/scipy

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jkantor/spkgs/double_matrices.hg

The function eigen_left and eigen_right are replaced by left_eigenvectors and right_eigenvectors. Hopefully this makes it more clear that for example left_eigenvectors are eigenvectors so that v*m=\lambda*v 

(I have to admit I'm still not terribly satisfied with the name)

One line in graph.py as well as numerical.py needed to be changed to reflect this.
