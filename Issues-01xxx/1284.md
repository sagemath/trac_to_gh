Subgroups of abelian groups:

sage: G.<a, b> = AbelianGroup(2)
sage: A = G.subgroup([a])
sage: B = G.subgroup([b])
sage: A == B
True

Surely not!

On the other hand for vector spaces:

sage: W.<u, v> = QQ^2
sage: U = W.subspace([u])
sage: V = W.subspace([v])
sage: U == V
False

As expected.
```

I have verified this and I agree that this is stupid.
The problem is that the `__cmp__` method is just comparing
the groups abstract structure:

```
        if not is_AbelianGroup(right):
            return -1
        return cmp(self.invariants(), right.invariants())
```

It should also take into account the embedding.

Hi John, Robert,

I would even go so far and choose a working, but slow/sucky implementation over a future perfect one. Perfection is the enemy of the good. Since this issue has made it into trac three times I would like to have this ticket resolved in 3.0.2. So assuming this work let's merge it as is and open an enhancement ticket for a proper fast implementation. 

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael

Yes, the original problem is solved, but others remain. 
 
With the two patches installed:

```
sage: G.<a, b> = AbelianGroup(2)
sage: H.<c> = AbelianGroup(1)
sage: H < G
True
```
which is not what I would expect.  There is no reason to assume H is a subgroup of G.

But anyway `__cmp__` and `__contains__` are inconsistent.  For

```
sage: c in H
True
sage: c in G
False
```

Moreover

```
sage: A = G.subgroup([a])
sage: A == H

sage: H == A

I am beginning to think the problem is rather deeper.  There are many inconsistencies in the way that algebraic objects are implemented.  It should be possible for a user to learn the basic syntax for, say, rings, and then adopt most of the basics when working with vector spaces, or abelian groups, etc.

Some examples of inconsistent behaviour follow.

```
sage: R.<r> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: S.<s> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: R == S
False
sage: R.ideal(r^2 - 1) < S
True
```

```
sage: U.<u1, u2> = QQ^2
sage: V.<v1, v2> = QQ^2
sage: U == V
True
sage: W = VectorSpace(QQ, 2)
sage: U == W
True
sage: W.<w1, w2> = VectorSpace(QQ, 2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>             Traceback (most recent call last)

/Users/mafwc/<ipython console> in <module>()

<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: VectorSpace() got an unexpected keyword argument 'names'
```

In my experience of doing calculations (rather than looking at the code) number fields have the best implementation of the algebraic objects which I have encountered .  But even so there are things that could be improved.  For example:

```
sage: K.subfield((theta^4 + 26*theta)/84)

(Number Field in theta0 with defining polynomial x^3 - 2,
 Ring morphism:
  From: Number Field in theta0 with defining polynomial x^3 - 2
  To:   Number Field in theta with defining polynomial x^6 + 40*x^3 + 1372
  Defn: theta0 |--> 1/84*theta^4 + 13/42*theta)
```
Here a subfield is generated by a single element.  There is no definition for a subfield generated by a list of elements; `K.subfield([(theta^4 + 26*theta)/84])` leads to a long, unhelpful error message.  In contrast, subgroups of abelian groups and subspaces of vector spaces **must** be generated by a list.  

Surely `X.subobject([x,y,z])` should be standard, with `X.subobject(x)`equivalent to `X.subobject([x])`.  Ideals of rings work well in this respect:

```
sage: R.<r> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: R.ideal([r^2, r^3])
Principal ideal (r^2) of Univariate Polynomial Ring in r over Rational Field
sage: R.ideal(r^2 - 1)
Principal ideal (r^2 - 1) of Univariate Polynomial Ring in r over Rational Field
sage: R.ideal([r^2 - 1])
Principal ideal (r^2 - 1) of Univariate Polynomial Ring in r over Rational Field
sage: R.ideal([r^2 - 1, r - 1])
Principal ideal (r - 1) of Univariate Polynomial Ring in r over Rational Field
```
But

```
sage: R.ideal([r^2, r - 1])
Principal ideal (1) of Univariate Polynomial Ring in r over Rational Field
sage: R == R.ideal([r^2, r - 1])
False
```
and at the moment there doesn't seem to be any subring construction, while `is_subring` restricts itself to 'natural' inclusions.

One thing that appears to be missing from most (all?) the algebraic objects is intersection of subobjects.

Probably what is needed to to rethink, and eventually, rewrite all the standard algebraic categories in a consistent and standard way.

I agree strongly with Francis on this.  There are serious issues here which cannot be dealt with by treating the problem as a small bug that can be fixed with a small patch.

The immediate problem with abelian groups has been solved, and all the group-related problems posted with this patch are dealt with by this patch, which I think can go ahead.

The wider problems raised by Frances are not touched by this and should somehow be preserved in a new patch.  I also believe that the whole f.g. abelian groups implementation would benefit from a rewrite using ultra-efficient matrix operations (HNF and SNF) to do everything;  but that would be a serious undertaking, and talk is cheap...
