ToDo:
* delete $SAGE_LOCAL/include/mwrank
* strip the mwrank binaries? Also make them link dynamically?
  mwrank unstripped: 12 mb, stripped 2.2MB
* delete $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libmwrank.[so|dylib]

Cheers,

As far as I can tell the spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/cremona-20071124.p4.spkg

fixes all the above issues. But it certainly can stand some more testing.
