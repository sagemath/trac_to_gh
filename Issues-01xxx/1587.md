```
sage: M = matrix([[1,2,3],[1,2,4],[2,4,7]])
sage: M.kernel()

Free module of degree 3 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[ 1  1 -1]
sage: v = vector([1, 1, -1])
sage: M*v
(0, -1, -1)
sage: v*M
(0, 0, 0)
```

This is not what most people expect.  Either the behavior should be changed so that it gives the kernel when acting on columns from the left or some documentation should make the current behavior very clear.

There are 2 or 3 reasons why things are as they are with matrix
actions on vectors in Sage.

1. In Sage vectors are row vectors:
sage: v = vector([1,2,3])
sage: v
(1, 2, 3)              # <-- that's a row

Matrices act naturally from the right on row vectors.

Nonetheless, we now allow both actions in Sage for convenience:

sage: A = random_matrix(QQ,3)
sage: A*v
(5, -4, 3)
sage: v*A
(6, 3/2, -1)

2. David Kohel and I made the decision about which side matrices would act on
when I started Sage, i.e., back when Sage was called "Software for Arithmetic
Geometry Experimentation", and the main goal of Sage was to provide a viable
open source alternative to the subset of Magma that David Kohel and I used, and
to do so in a way that made it as easy as possible to port our code from Magma,
and to go back and forth between Sage and Magma.
In Magma matrices act from the right, probably because vectors are row vectors
and also because Magma is Australian.

3. At some point I was about to change everything to matrices acting from the
left, and David Kohel stopped me.

I don't know if that is a compelling enough reason.   A fourth reason is that
changing things now would be really really really hard, and would likely
introduce numerous bugs all over the place.

A Magma example:
-----

sage: A = random_matrix(QQ,3)
sage: v = vector([1,2,3])
sage: v*A
(9, 4, 3/2)
sage: A*v
(-5, 2, 15/2)
sage: aa = magma(A)
sage: vv = magma('VectorSpace(RationalField(),3)![1,2,3]')   # trac
1605 -- I'm on it.
sage: vv*aa
(  9   4 3/2)
sage: aa*vv
... (boom!)
<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: Error evaluation Magma code.
IN:_sage_[7] := _sage_[4] * _sage_[5];
OUT:
>> _sage_[7] := _sage_[4] * _sage_[5];
                         ^
Runtime error in '*': Arguments are not compatible
Argument types given: AlgMatElt[FldRat], ModTupFldElt[FldRat]

Good idea.  Please create a trac ticket, then put in some examples.
You'll modify the file
   sage/matrix/matrix_rational_dense.pyx
Please put in a bunch (i.e., maybe 4 or 5) of examples to illustrate all
kinds of things, including edge cases (0 by n or n by 0 matrices,
denominators, etc.).

If you're doing a linear algebra overhaul, please see ticket #5009 for another left/right issue, and see #5001 for another kernel issue.

Attachment: **[kernel_doc.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1587/kernel_doc.patch.gz)**

I added some words and some examples (including corner cases) to the function `kernel` in `sage/misc/functional.py` and to the `kernel` method in `sage/matrix/matrix_rational_dense.py`. 

Since the examples of the `kernel` method for dense integer matrices and for sparse matrices are clear enough, I believe that my patch suffices to clearify the documentation of `kernel`.
