This disturbs people:

```
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx             python(85565) malloc: *** mmap(size=4096000000) failed (error code=12)
*** error: can't allocate region
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
```

This would disturb people less:

```
[[The following doctest contains an intentional memory error.]]
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx             python(85565) malloc: *** mmap(size=4096000000) failed (error code=12)
*** error: can't allocate region
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
```

**Assignee:** failure

The issue has been added to the FAQ. It might be easiest to direct stderr to some file. That way people should never see the offending message.

Maybe making it "optional -- large" or "optional -- $SOME_OS_LIST" would be a way out of this. Anyway, there seems to be no reliable way to test the allocation of huge amounts of memory and expect the Sage session to survive.
