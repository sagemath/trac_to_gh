Do not apply this patch. 

Though the operations take place in the fraction field, the coefficients all live in the original ring (proof: use the determinant form of charpoly) and this is why this line was there. 

This should be fixed, but this is not the right fix.

Excellent point.  I've done some more digging, and here's what I think is at the bottom of all this:

```
P.<a,b> = QQ[]
Q.<x> = PolynomialRing(P)
F = P.fraction_field()
f=F(a)*x
Q(f)
```

returns

The culprit is `__call__` in multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx, where the function tries a bunch of things and then, before giving up, tries to coerce a into QQ (which of course will not work).  Somehow our polynomial f is slipping through the cracks.  Note that this is a multivariable issue; the same thing works perfectly well over QQ[a].
