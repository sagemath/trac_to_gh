Do not apply this patch. 

Though the operations take place in the fraction field, the coefficients all live in the original ring (proof: use the determinant form of charpoly) and this is why this line was there. 

This should be fixed, but this is not the right fix.

P.<a,b> = QQ[]

The culprit is `__call__` in multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx, where the function tries a bunch of things and then, before giving up, tries to coerce a into QQ (which of course will not work).  Somehow our polynomial f is slipping through the cracks.  Note that this is a multivariable issue; the same thing works perfectly well over QQ[a].
