NTL is currently build without debug symbols. This makes debugging or valgrinding harder and forces me to rebuild NTL manually. The spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-2.10/alpha1/ntl-5.4.1.p10.spkg

adds debug flags to the appropriate CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS.

Cheers,

Michael
