Some statistics on running memcheck on `padic_capped_relative_element.py`:
Before:

```
==6186== LEAK SUMMARY:
==6186==    definitely lost: 312 bytes in 30 blocks.
==6186==      possibly lost: 261,425 bytes in 712 blocks.
==6186==    still reachable: 39,070,789 bytes in 19,104 blocks.
==6186==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks.
```
After:

```
==6600== LEAK SUMMARY:
==6600==    definitely lost: 264 bytes in 24 blocks.
==6600==      possibly lost: 261,881 bytes in 713 blocks.
==6600==    still reachable: 39,070,317 bytes in 19,102 blocks.
==6600==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks.
```
6 blocks with 48 bytes, but those leaks should add up quickly.

Cheers,
