In any case, if you register you\nonly get sent to 8101 *after* you register -- your registration should still go\nthrough fine.  You can then login by manually going to sagenb.org (or going\nback with the browser back button).\n\n```\n\nAssignee: **boothby**\n\n_Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/1879_\n\n",

That's annoying.  I wonder why that happens.  In any case, if you register you
only get sent to 8101 *after* you register -- your registration should still go
through fine.  You can then login by manually going to sagenb.org (or going
back with the browser back button).
