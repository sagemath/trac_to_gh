There were some annoying doctest failures in sage0.py in 2.10.1.rc1, which are due to weird issues with ANSI codes ending up in the result of eval(). This parses them to get the correct answer.

I think there's possibly a deeper readline issue here, but that's mostly wild speculation.

Worked for me on Fedoa 7:


```
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/sage0.py           ^[[?1034h
         [7.1 s]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 7.1 seconds

```

How about the extra escape code on each test line?
