```
Try to run this code:

```
sage: sr = mq.SR(4,4,4,8, aes_mode=True, star=True, allow_zero_inversions=True)
sage: F,s = sr.polynomial_system()
```

and wait for it to terminate (~17s on my 2.33Ghz system) in a fresh SAGE session. The second run takes only 2s.


I profiled this with hotshot like this:

```
sage: import hotshot
sage: filename = "pythongrind.prof"
sage: prof = hotshot.Profile(filename, lineevents=1)
sage: prof.run("sr.polynomial_system()")
<hotshot.Profile instance at 0x414c11ec>
sage: prof.close()
```

and converted the result to cachegrind/calltree format

```
hotshot2calltree -o cachegrind.out.42 pythongrind.prof
```

to inspect the result with kcachegrind. Apparently, both `sr.round_polynomials` and `sr.key_schedule_polynomials` call `MatrixSpace.get_action_impl` which in turn calls `pushout` which calls `construction_tower`. `construction_tower` creates *7164* polynomial rings and this ring construction takes up 85% of the entire runtime. 

So apparently the most time is spent in coercion (which also explains the better runtime for the second run) and I believe this is due to a bug.

Some more hints:

First try:

```
sage: n = 296
sage: P = PolynomialRing(GF(2),n,'x')
sage: v = matrix(P,100,1)
sage: A = matrix(P,100,100)
sage: time _ = A*v
CPU times: user 0.69 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 0.72 s
Wall time: 0.75
```

then restart Sage and try:

```
sage: n = 296
sage: P = PolynomialRing(GF(2),n,'x')
sage: v = matrix(P,100,1)
sage: A = matrix(P,100,100)
sage: time _ = A._multiply_classical(v)
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s

One more data point to the above remark malb did. With the patch applied:

```
sage: n = 296
sage: P = PolynomialRing(GF(2),n,'x')
sage: v = vector(P,100)
sage: A = matrix(P,100,100)
sage: %time _ = A*v
CPU times: user 0.04 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.04 s
Wall time: 0.04 s
sage: %time _ = A*v
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00 s
```
So there is more than an order of magnitude improvement here :)

Cheers,

Michael
