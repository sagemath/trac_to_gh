The attached qqbar.hg bundle provides an implementation of QQbar (the algebraic closure of the rationals), with an embedding into CC.  (The embedding is built-in, so there's no version without the embedding.)

testall passes on both 32-bit and 64-bit x86 Linux.

The bundle requires the new MPFI spkg from #1268, and the patches from #1270 and #1273.

The bundle contains two patches.  The first has all the actual functionality; the second only handles the file rename from algebraic_real.py to qqbar.py.  I'm going to also attach a copy of this first patch, for review purposes; but it should not be applied separately--apply the bundle instead.

Robert, my golden ratio code has the "advantage" that computations like `AA(golden_ratio)^2 - AA(golden_ratio)` are exact:

```
sage: phi = AA( (1+AA(5).sqrt()) / 2) 
sage: phi^2 - phi
[0.99999999999999988 .. 1.0000000000000003]
sage: phi = AA(golden_ratio)
sage: phi^2 - phi
1
```

If you don't think that's useful, then I'm happy to switch the implementation.

I'm puzzled by your new chunk in .argument(); as far as I can tell, it should be redundant.  (Did you upgrade to the MPFI spkg in #1268 before applying #1270?  That version fixes some bugs that cause problems in .argument().  Note that if you apply #1270 and rebuild, then upgrade #1268, it has no effect; if you did things in that order, you would also need to touch mpfi.pxi, like it says in the description for #1268.)

Also, sqrt() needs a scary warning about branch cuts, along the lines of the warning in argument().  (Now that I look, I see that `__pow__()` is also missing such a warning.)

Thanks for the review!

I wasn't able to install the MPFI spkg, hence the new chunk in argument. If that makes it redundant, than we don't need it. In fact, I thought this is why you did golden_ration the way you did ('cause without the argument "fix" the imaginary part was not exactly 0). 

I agree both sqrt() and `__pow__()` should refer to the warning and docstring of argument(). 

Here is a question. In your way, in your original version, if you do 

```
sage: phi = AA(golden_ratio)
sage: (phi - 1/2)^2
```

is the answer exact? 

In any case, this should definitely get included and we can deal with this issue later.
