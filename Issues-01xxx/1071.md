calling IntegerVectors.list after applying the attached patch is much faster now.

old:

```
sage: time l1 = map(tuple, IntegerVectors(2, 60).list())
CPU time: 5.01 s,  Wall time: 5.11 s
```

new:

```
sage: time l1 = map(tuple, IntegerVectors(2, 60).list())
CPU time: 0.20 s,  Wall time: 0.20 s
```

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

Please note that the cleaner version by mhansen is by a factor of three than the original submission:

```
the untouched implementation
sage: time l1 = map(tuple, IntegerVectors(2, 60).list())
CPU times: user 5.06 s, sys: 0.11 s, total: 5.18 s
Wall time: 5.18
```

mhansen's implementation

```
sage: time l1 = map(tuple, IntegerVectors(2, 60, min_part=0).list())
CPU time: 0.56 s,  Wall time: 0.57 s
```

malb's original submission

```
sage: time l1 = map(tuple, IntegerVectors(2, 60).list())
CPU time: 0.20 s,  Wall time: 0.20 s
```

I don't mean to push my original patch (which's problems were fixed by mhansen) but propose to optimise mhansen's patch eventually.
