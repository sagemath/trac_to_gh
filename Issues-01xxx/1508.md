Notice, if you tab-complete plot( or list_plot( the docs do not
mention the option for axes_label.  However, the option is available.

Also, if you use them, the text for the x-axis is truncated off the
right edge of the plot.

Simple example:

p = plot(sin, 0, 10)
p.show(axes_label=['x-axis','y-axis'])
```
