If I download `java3d-1_5_1-linux-i586.zip` from the java3d web site, I can unzipit to get (among other things) `j3d-jre.zip`.  Then I can unzip `j3d-jre.zip` to get (among other things) `libj3dcore-ogl.so`.

If I put libj3dcore-ogl.so in some directory, and set my LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to point to that directory before starting Sage, then the command-line java3d code works.

Gluegen is supposed to take care of all of that (for applets it does) but maybe there's a way to rig it for apps too.
