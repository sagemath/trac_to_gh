Wraps Singular's invariant_algebra_reynolds and invariant_ring in finvar.lib, with help from Simon King and Martin Albrecht. Computes generators for the polynomial ring F[x1,...,xn]<sup>G</sup>, where G in GL(n,F) is a finite matrix group.

In the "good characteristic" case the polynomials returned form a minimal generating set for the algebra of G-invariant polynomials. In the "bad" case, the polynomials returned are primary and secondary invariants, forming a not necessarily minimal generating set for the algebra of G-invariant polynomials.
