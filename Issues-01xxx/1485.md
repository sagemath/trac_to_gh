Wraps Singular's invariant_algebra_reynolds and invariant_ring in finvar.lib, with help from Simon King and Martin Albrecht. Computes generators for the polynomial ring F[x1,...,xn]<sup>G</sup>, where G in GL(n,F) is a finite matrix group.

In the "good characteristic" case the polynomials returned form a minimal generating set for the algebra of G-invariant polynomials. In the "bad" case, the polynomials returned are primary and secondary invariants, forming a not necessarily minimal generating set for the algebra of G-invariant polynomials.

Patch is at
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/patches/matrix_group20071213.hg
and file is at
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/patches/matrix_group.py

**Assignee:** @wdjoyner

**Resolution:** fixed

The patch applies cleanly and the doctests pass. I cannot check the results due to lack of knowledge, though. Good to go in, if you ask me.

The patch causes hangs when doctesting `plot/plot3d/transform.pyx`. The really odd thing is that everything is fine when running that doctest with the `-verbose` flag.
