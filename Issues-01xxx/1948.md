For K a number field, K.factor_integer slices, dices, and also factors rationals, elements of the number field, etc.:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 1)
sage: K.factor_integer(1/3)
Fractional ideal (3)^-1
sage: K.factor_integer(1+a)
Fractional ideal (a + 1)
sage: K.factor_integer(1+a/5)
(Fractional ideal (-3*a - 2)) * (Fractional ideal (a + 1)) * (Fractional ideal (-a - 2))^-1 * (Fractional ideal (2*a + 1))^-1
sage: 
```

So it needs to be named something else.  Suggestions welcome.  

Component: **number theory**

The patch (based on 3.0.alpha0) follows Alex's suggestion.  It is a simple text replacement of all factor_integer -> factor in the source code.

I wondered about keeping factor_integer as an alias but decided against.

Hi Alex,

those factor_integer instances do no longer exist in alpha4 [I assume John has rewritten that code in some other patch]:

```
sage-3.0.alpha4/devel/sage$ grep -r factor_integer *
sage-3.0.alpha4/devel/sage$     
```
I did run `-t -long` on the tree after applying the inital two patches. So I am closing this again.

Cheers,

Michael
