This is the second patch from #1576 which turns on implicit multiplication per default. We will wait to merge this past 2.9.2.

I just want to commment that this afternoon somebody came up to me at the Sage booth and really really wanted implicit multiplication by default, and was quite happy when I demoed it for them. 

I'll ask Robert to referee this patch "turning it on".  He might want to do something
a little more sophisticated, though I would be very reluctant to support that (e.g., adjusting the level -- which is dangerous since library code could also use the preparser and may depend on the default level).

Sorry if I come late in this discussion, but I want to warn about possible implications of this
change. Firstly the fact that "a b" is parsed as "a*b" is the reason which forced Mathematica to
introduce a different kind of parenthesis for function calls, like Sin[x] instead of Sin(x),
because Sin (x) could be parsed as Sin * (x). You will say that if Sin is a functional operator,
then Sin (x) should be parsed as Sin(x). But what about f (g), where f and g are both
functional operators? Should it be parsed as the composition of f and g, or as f*g? 
What about t [1]? Should it be parsed as the element of index 1 of the list t, or as the 
multiplication of each element of [1] by t? Note that Mathematica had to introduce t{{1}} to
access indices of arrays or lists for the same reason.

In understand that parsing "a b" as "a*b" might be very attractive for interactive usage, but
it will lead to some ambiguities, some of which are explained above, and maybe some others I'm
not yet aware of. Those ambiguities might force to change back, or to make fundamental changes
in the language syntax. Therefore I strongly recommend to consider all possible implications 
before doing that fundamental change.

If you want to count people which are happy without implicit multiplication, I am! Why not
letting the user decide in his/her init.sage file to enable implicit multiplication?

The implicit multiplication code is very conservative. It doesn't mangle any valid python, so something like "sin(x)" won't be touched at all. The places implicit multiplication is inserted are (default level 5):

```
        code  -- the code with missing *'s
        level -- how agressive to be in placing *'s
                   0) Do nothing
                   1) numeric followed by alphanumeric
                   2) closing parentheses followed by alphanumeric
                   3) Spaces between alphanumeric
                  10) Adjacent parentheses (may mangle call statements)
                   
    EXAMPLES: 
        sage: from sage.misc.preparser import implicit_mul
        sage: implicit_mul('(2x^2-4x+3)a0')
        '(2*x^2-4*x+3)*a0'
        sage: implicit_mul('a b c in L')
        'a*b*c in L'
        sage: implicit_mul('1r + 1e3 + 5exp(2)')
        '1r + 1e3 + 5*exp(2)'
        sage: implicit_mul('f(a)(b)', level=10)
        'f(a)*(b)'
```

For me personally, I don't mind typing "a*b" instead of "a b", but being able to do stuff like "2x^3-3x+1" is really nice.

I tend to agree with Paul on this, that the implicit multiplication leads to ambiguities. While it might be convenient for some people and a much requested feature you should consider that once it is activated per default you cannot push toothpaste back in the tube once you have pushed it out.

So I would suggest just as Paul said that people can activate this in the sage.ini file or wherever.  Make it a prominent part of the tutorial so that people know about it. That might be a compromise for now and let's reevaluate this down the road. I don't think I will change my opinion, mostly because I have discussed the same issue in the CoCoA language where `f (g)` and `f(g)` can mean different things. And the backward compatibility hell that this causes for a CoCoA 5 parser is quite a pain, so my vote is negative on merging this patch now.

*If* this gets merged it shouldn't have some knob to turn, since this will very likely cause us to investigate the knob value for bug reports on sage-support.

Yes we can.   If it turns out to really be a problem
we can change or eliminate it.

I disagree with this.  Sage should make clear choices
instead of having tons of complicated configuration 
options.  

> That might be a compromise for now and let's

You do understand that the Sage implicit multiplication
does not apply at all in the above cases, since it doesn't
do anything with adjacent parenthesis.  In fact the
implicit multiplication code only has any effect at all
on expressions that would otherwise be syntax errors.

> turn, since this will very likely cause us to

I disagree.  We should enable it and if it turns out
that people do make syntax error that suddenly become
valid and this results in actual confusion, then we revisit
this question.

That's not true unless you mean a and b to be completely general expressions.

No.

The implicit multiplication that Robert implemented does *nothing* 
in that case.  It's much more minimal -- it never ever changes anything
unless it would have been a syntax error in Python. 

> Should it be parsed as the composition of f and g, or as f*g? 

A composition, since it is as valid python.

Again t [1] is valid Python so it is not touched.

It is very useful for interactive use so long as one is careful
about what is meant by a and b above.

I can't think of any ambiguities at all in what Robert proposes.

If there are any (I don't think there are), then changing back
would not be the end of the work.

You can simply ignore it.  You'll never know it is there. 
Why make customization complicated when it's not necessary
to do so.  Sage isn't emacs.

No, this isn't the problem for me. It's not implicit multiplication in particular. It's the whole preparser thing in general.

Do you know, when I first ran into sage (when there was a *lot* less crud in the preparser), the preparser was probably the single most difficult thing for me to get my head around.

I know I made these kind of mistakes in programing languages long  
before I used Sage, and this kind of syntactic sugar is what makes  
"Python" usable as a CAS language. Having to write Integer(3) *every time I want to use an integer* is unacceptable as well.

I don't know anyone who does this except perhaps when they're first  
starting out (when it is a very useful technique).

Personally, I find jumping Sage <--> Python (<--> Cython) to be not  
that difficult. The preparser is similar (in purpose) to the  
notebook, it gives and easier interface to the computational engine  
underneath. Of course, you're not a notebook guy either...

Compared to any other system, I think this is true. You can use pure  
Python if you want, but if you're lazy (like me) Sage can do some CAS- 
specific things for you too.

Yes, and I think this is a good thing. The center of balance is  
changing because things are getting added to the "lower" end of the  
scale, not because the "upper" end is getting smaller. If things are  
introduced that truly make it worse for the "experts" then that would  
be a harder thing to justify, but here I think it is beneficial  
across the board. In fact I wouldn't be surprised there are a lot of  
old-time mathematicians who would find having to insert the * in "2x"  
more counter-intuitive than the rising generation of computer- 
literate calc students.

Yes, this is the kind of thing for a FAQ.

I agree with you here! Not sure what the best solution is for this  
though.

I think the audience is getting bigger, but not excluding people like  
us.

It seems like with the preparser your sensibilities as a programmer  
are more offended than your sensibilities as a mathematician, right?  
(Of course, to use Sage more than causally one has to be both.)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

I have decided *not* to have implicit multiplication on by default.  It should be an easy-to-turn on option for those who really need it.  

The reasons:
1. "import this" outputs "Explicit is better than implicit."
  
2. We should use the preparser only when strictly necessary.

3. There have only ever been two requests for this functionality, but more than two people spoke up against it. 

4. If the target audience of Sage doesn't solidly include David Harvey, then it doesn't include me either, and we have completely lost our way.  We can't let that happen.
