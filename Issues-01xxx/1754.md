Any self signed certificate causes issues with FF 3B4. So I don't think this has anything to do with Sage or GNUTLS. The solution is to add an exception rule so that firefox will access the site.

I don't consider this a bug since it is a Firefox issue. The workaround needs to be documented and then this issue will be closed.

I'm also able to add an exception with FF3B5. The procedure for adding an exception to FF3 is non-obvious so perhaps it should be in the documentation (Wiki FAQs?). Changing to a documentation issue.

Q: When I try to access the notebook using Firefox 3 I receive an error message:
{{{localhost:8000 uses an invalid security certificate.

The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is unknown.
The certificate is not valid for any server names.

(Error code: sec_error_unknown_issuer)}}}

A: Add a certificate exception:
 \# Open the Firefox preferences
 \# Go to the _Advanced/Encryption_ tab.
 \# Click _View Certificates_
 \# In the `_Servers_` tab, click _Add Exception..._
 \# Paste the URL for your notebook , eg https://localhost:8000/
