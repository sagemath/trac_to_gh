```
sage: s = PSage()
sage: a = s('2+2')
sage: a   # wait 10 seconds and press return
<<currently executing code>>
sage: a
4
sage: s = PSage()
sage: a = s('2+2'); s = str(a); a
4
```

Notice above that the first output of a says current executing, but that is wrong.
In the second, we query a, and display it and it is already done very quickly.
