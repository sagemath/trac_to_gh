The current behavior is not a bug and is exactly the way we designed
it to work.  That said, I *do* want to change the implementation
so that any time a cell is changed and the cursor leaves the cell
or "save & close" is clicked, the changed version is sent back to the
server.  I think Tom Boothby has argued against this,
which is why it hasn't happened already.

This was implemented some time before the notebook went to Twisted.  I'll try to do it again...

REVIEW:

1. It works!

2. This line is lame:

```
       if ctx.args.has_key('save_only'): 
```
instead you should test that the save_only key is there *and* equal to '1'. 
Since it would be very reasonable to write query code someday with save_only=0,
and it would be mysteriously buggy. 

3. When 2 is fixed I recommend this for inclusion in Sage.
