The current behavior is not a bug and is exactly the way we designed
it to work.  That said, I *do* want to change the implementation
so that any time a cell is changed and the cursor leaves the cell
or "save & close" is clicked, the changed version is sent back to the
server.  I think Tom Boothby has argued against this,
which is why it hasn't happened already.

REVIEW:

1. It works!

2. This line is lame:

```
       if ctx.args.has_key('save_only'): 
```
instead you should test that the save_only key is there *and* equal to '1'. 
Since it would be very reasonable to write query code someday with save_only=0,
and it would be mysteriously buggy. 

3. When 2 is fixed I recommend this for inclusion in Sage.
