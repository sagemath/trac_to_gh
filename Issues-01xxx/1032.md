Towards the bottom of the thread linked by mabshoff, I believe we have William's approval for this patch.

I've personally tested that singular, gp, maxima, and gap all appear to support '_'s in identifiers in their own interpreted languages.  I wanted to do some more extensive tests, but it wasn't quite as easy as I first thought it might be and now that I've tested each of their interpreted languages, I think such further testing does not hold much value.

Hence, I think this patch is good to be included (of course, I expect you to be suspicious of that statement -- since I'm the author of the patch!)

This breaks a treasured old behavior:

17:48 < mabshoff> Stuff like
17:48 < mabshoff> File "polynomial_ring.py", line 383:
17:48 < mabshoff>     sage: latex(S)
17:48 < mabshoff> Expected:
17:48 < mabshoff>     \mathbf{Z}[\alpha_{12}]
17:48 < mabshoff> Got:
17:48 < mabshoff>     \mathbf{Z}[\text{alpha12}]
17:48 < mabshoff> Should I just fix those?
17:48 < wstein> Hey, \mathbf{Z}[\text{alpha12}] is pretty damned LAME imho.
17:48 < mabshoff> Nope, they actually look wrong.
17:48 < wstein> So joel got rid of the nice behavior that used to be there?
17:49 < wstein> That's stupid.
17:49 < wstein> Reject it.
17:49 < mabshoff> back it out?
17:49 < wstein> I'm ok with allowing alpha_12, but I don't agree with *forcing* the use 
                of underscores for subscripts.
17:49 < wstein> The latex form of alpha12 can't have any meaning except $\alpha_{12}$.
17:49 < wstein> Yes, I would back it out.
17:49 < wstein> That's annoying.
