<a id='comment:2'></a>The stack overflow message is caused by a bug in the gp interface (#1109).  However, fixing that does not make this doctest pass.

When I turn on logging (by changing "logfile=None" to "logfile='/tmp/dklog'" on line 194 of dokchitser.py), I can see that gp behaves quite differently on 32-bit linux and 64-bit linux.

On 64-bit linux, the logfile includes this chunk:

```
? initLdata("a(k)", 1.000)\q
\q

ata("a(k)", 1.000)

  *** vector: the PARI stack overflows !

  current stack size: 10000000 (9.537 Mbytes)

  [hint] you can increase GP stack with allocatemem()

```
(after this, the interface then keeps doubling the available memory, and gp keeps saying out of memory, until gp refuses to double the memory any more at 4.8 GB).

The corresponding section in the 32-bit linux logfile looks like this:

```
? initLdata("a(k)", 1.000)
initLdata("a(k)", 1.000)
\q
\q

vector: impossible assignment I-->S

? \q
\q

```
followed by a whole bunch of NUL characters.

Having NUL characters show up in the logfile seems like a bad sign; it makes me wonder if something is going wrong inside gp on 32-bit linux, and maybe the 64-bit linux result is actually the correct one.

I'm not planning to continue looking at this; it seems like a job for somebody familiar with gp and the dokchitser code.
