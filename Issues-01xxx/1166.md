It looks like a newline at the end of the multi line expression of f(10) would fix the issue:

[this is my first review, thus please take with care]

I get with this patch applied in 2.10:

```
sage: f=(exp(x)-1)/(exp(x/2)+1)
sage: g=exp(x/2)-1
sage: print f(10.0), g(10.0)

                               147.4131591025766 
                               147.4131591025766
sage: print 1, 2
1 2
sage: print f(10), g(10)

                                     10
                                    e   - 1
                                   --------
                                     5
                                    e  + 1 
                                      5
                                     e  - 1
```
The output is much better, but I would expect:

```
sage: print f(10.0), g(10.0)

                   147.4131591025766, 147.4131591025766
```
or

```
sage: print f(10.0), g(10.0)
147.4131591025766 147.4131591025766
```
However, since this is an improvement, I give a positive review.

The potential solution to the adding an extra newlines in situations like

```
sage: print f(10.0), g(10.0)
147.4131591025766 147.4131591025766
```
might be that we need to check if the string returned from `f(10.0` contains a newline in which case we need to add the extra newline to separate the the two multiline outputs. If that is doable please open another ticket.

Cheers,

Michael
