The issue is in the caching:

```
sage: R = Qp(7, print_mode='val-unit')
sage: S = Qp(7)
sage: R(7^2 + 1)
7^2 * 1 + O(7^22)
sage: S(7^2)
7^2 + O(7^22)
sage: R(7^2 + 1)
50 + O(7^20)
sage: S(7^2 + 1)
1 + 7^2 + O(7^20)
sage: R is S
False
sage: R['x'] is S['x']
True
```
The issue manifests itself in polynomial_ring_constructor, which fails because the cache is keyed by ==, not identity, and

```
sage: R == S
True
```

It would appear so. Consider:

```
sage: R = Qp(7, print_mode='val-unit')
sage: S = Qp(7)
sage: R(7^2 + 1)
7^2 * 1 + O(7^22)
sage: S(7^2)
7^2 + O(7^22)
sage: R(7^2 + 1)
50 + O(7^20)
sage: S(7^2 + 1)
1 + 7^2 + O(7^20)
sage: R is S
False
sage: R['x'] is S['x']
False # this is now fixed
sage: R['x'](7^2)
(7^2 * 1 + O(7^22))
sage: S['x'](7^2)
(7^2 + O(7^22))
sage: R['x'](7^2+1)
(50 + O(7^20))
sage: S['x'](7^2+1)
(1 + 7^2 + O(7^20))
```
However, this is still puzzling:

```
sage: R['x'] == S['x']
False
```

I get with `5.9.beta1`:

```
sage: sage: R = Qp(7, print_mode='val-unit')
sage: sage: S = Qp(7)
sage: R is S
False
sage: R == S
False
sage: R['x'] == S['x']
False
sage: R['x'] is S['x']
False
```
which is the expected behavior due to `UniqueRepresentation` parents.

It should be due to `UniqueFactory` (in `6.2.beta3`). But anyway, documentation of `Qp` says 

```
PRINTING:

    There are many different ways to print `p`-adic elements.
    ...
    Note that the printing options affect whether different
    `p`-adic fields are considered equal.
```
