I believe there is a bug in the code change of the doc_1088 patch above.  The third patch (1088-correct-bugs-improve-doctests.patch) reverses this change, reimplements the doctests, and makes the code faster by sorting using key instead of cmp.

The third doctest should be applied after the first two doctests.
