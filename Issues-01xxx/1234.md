```

From John Cremona: the "cremona" version just wraps a gp script, which
needs to have sufficient precision even for ellinit() to work ok here.
Unfortunately this call will run in its own gp session, and it is not
possible for the user to set the precision.  (I found the same while
running a lot of examples through Denis Simon's gp scripts).  The
solution is to change the wrapper to have a precision parameter, with
some reasonable default for backwards compatibility, which gets passes
through to gp.

Given the fundamental problem that computing the analytic rank increases rapidly with the conductor N (I think it is sqrt(N)), one solution would be to impose a (carefully-chosen but necessarily somewhat arbitrary) cutoff N_max, so that asking for the analytic rank of a curve of conductor>N_max would result in an error.

One way to implement this would be to have N_max a parameter to the analytic rank function, with a default value of (say) `10^6` or `10^7`.  (I would have to do some experiments to decide on a sensible value).  The docstring could explain that the user is allowed to increase this but warn that it may take (effectively) for ever.

I agree with capitalization in documentation;  for parameters it would probably be best to allow either.
