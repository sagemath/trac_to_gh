I probably didn't put the math script that I made somewhere in your PATH.
I can't remember where I put it now, but that would be the problem.
I really need to make Sage automatically do this (with no user intervention).
Can you type

 locate math

and send me the output, which will contain a script named "math"?
Then you just have to move that script to /usr/bin/ so it is in you PATH.

{{{Justin (cc: sage-devel),

There are now a lot of people using Sage on OSX who don't know
(much) about the command line, but who are maple/mathematica
users.  When they try:

   sage: mathematica('2+2')

they get a big error message about creating a "math" script, etc.,
and similarly for Maple.

It seems to me that instead of that big error, we could *automatically*
track down Maple/Mathematica on their system and
create the script and put it in SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/.

Thoughts?

It seems like OSX mojo is relevant to this problem.

I'm not sure we should be fixing this... or at least, sage-wishlist.
