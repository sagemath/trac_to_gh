I am using JSON objects (http://json.org) as a language neutral way to allow SAGE to communicate with clients.  I have installed SimpleJSON (http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/simplejson) on a SAGE server and have it sending 2D plot data to an applet in the notebook.  I would now like to request that SimpleJSON be added to SAGE.

In order to test SAGE->Applet communications using JSON, perform the following steps:

1) Install SimpleJSON in SAGE.  The user must be able to import SimpleJSON by entering "import simplejson" in a cell.

2) Paste the following code into CELL 0 of a new worksheet and execute it in order to launch the applet:

```
html('<applet id="mathrider" code="org.mathrider.MathRider.class" width="800" height="650" codebase="http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/tkosan/mathrider/" archive="mathrider.jar" MAYSCRIPT></applet>')
```

3) After the applet launches, select the "Cell" tab, paste the following code into the "Send Cell" text area, and execute it with <shift><tab>.

```
a = MathRider()
a.show(plot(2*x,0,1))
```

4) The code will be sent to SAGE for evaluation and a JSON object which contains the plot data will be returned to the applet.

5) The plot will then be displayed in the "2DPlot" tab.

If you would like to see the data that is returned by the above code, just execute it in a blank cell in the notebook.

Spkg can be found here:

Test with the following code:

```
sage: import simplejson
sage: simplejson.dumps([int(3),int(4)])
'[3, 4]'
sage: simplejson.dumps(['foo', {'bar': ('baz', None, float(1.0), int(2))}])
'["foo", {"bar": ["baz", null, 1.0, 2]}]'

According to the home page, it should handle them OK. From the webpage:
"""
JSON is built on two structures:

* A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.
* An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.

These are universal data structures. Virtually all modern programming languages support them in one form or another. It makes sense that a data format that is interchangable with programming languages also be based on these structures.

I've created an updated updated spkg: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/drake/simplejson-2.0.9.spkg

This spkg has the proper Mercurial repo, spkg-install, spkg-check, SPKG.txt, and so on.

I don't know about pickling and so on, except that as it stands, if you do something like `simplejson.dumps(1)`, it fails and says "TypeError: 1 is not JSON serializable". I don't know enough to fix the problem or decide whether or not it's an issue.
