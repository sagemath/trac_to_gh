rishi_: I use scipy very often. To use complex number I have to use the following statement:  sage: a=numpy.complex128(complex(2+3*I)). Is it not possible to avoid 2 conversions?
[12:29pm] mabshoff: hungry? *ducks*
[12:29pm] ondrej: mabshoff - like a small dog?
[12:29pm] mabshoff: yes. a young dog.
[12:29pm] wstein-1658: We could add a method (2+3*I).complex128().
[12:29pm] wstein-1658: Want that?
[12:29pm] wstein-1658: Is I symbolic, by the way?
[12:29pm] rishi_: yes
[12:30pm] wstein-1658: Do you want to avoid two conversions because of speed or code cleaness?
[12:30pm] wstein-1658: Probably clean-ness.
[12:30pm] rishi_: cleaness

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

A temporary workaround (and almost the fix):

```
sage: import sage.calculus.calculus
sage: def complex128(self): import numpy; return numpy.complex128(complex(self))
....: 
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.SymbolicExpression.complex128 = complex128
sage: 
sage: (3 + 2*I).complex128()
(3+2j)
```
