We do not have binaries on less common platforms. If SAGE_FORTRAN isn't set we just fail, but we should check for common Fortran compilers and set them then instead of failing. Preference should be:
* gfotran
* g95
* g77
* f77 - on BSD the g77 is commonly called f77

Cheers,

Michael

This has been fixed by William Stein a while ago.
