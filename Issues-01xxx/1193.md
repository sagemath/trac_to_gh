When I attempt to apply a patch under VMware, I get an error:

```
 _dispatch
    ret = _runcommand(ui, options, cmd, d)
  File "/usr/local/sage/local/lib/python2.5/mercurial/dispatch.py", line 401, in
 _runcommand
    return checkargs()
  File "/usr/local/sage/local/lib/python2.5/mercurial/dispatch.py", line 357, in
 checkargs
    return cmdfunc()
  File "/usr/local/sage/local/lib/python2.5/mercurial/dispatch.py", line 340, in
 <lambda>
    d = lambda: func(ui, repo, *args, **cmdoptions)
  File "/usr/local/sage/local/lib/python2.5/mercurial/commands.py", line 2691, i
n unbundle
    modheads = repo.addchangegroup(gen, 'unbundle', 'bundle:', + fname)
  File "/usr/local/sage/local/lib/python2.5/mercurial/localrepo.py", line 1849, 
in addchangegroup
    if cl.addgroup(chunkiter, csmap, trp, 1) is None:
  File "/usr/local/sage/local/lib/python2.5/mercurial/revlog.py", line 1201, in
addgroup
    ifh, dfh)
  File "/usr/local/sage/local/lib/python2.5/mercurial/revlog.py", line 1026, in
_addrevision
    ptext = self.revision(self.node(prev))
  File "/usr/local/sage/local/lib/python2.5/mercurial/revlog.py", line 948, in r
evision
    text = mdiff.patches(text, bins)
mpatch.mpatchError: invalid patch
```

This occurred most recently when I applied Yi's latest DSage patch, but it occurs even when I make a patch recording a trivial modification to a file.  

(Shouldn't there be a "mercurial" component in the drop-down below?)

I believe this is a permission issue, so not really a bug on our end.

Cheers,

The error message suggests corruption of the patch file itself.
