The problem is that when David Joyner implemented this, doing 

sage: A=AbelianGroup([7,8])

would immediately change the invariants to be the elementary divisors. 
I.e., it was *impossible* 
to make an abelian group with specified generator orders -- the would
also change to be elementary divisors.   This was so
hugely painful to use that I fixed AbelianGroup so that one could create
a group with arbitrary generator orders.   Unfortunately, I evidently
didn't correctly update the elementary_divisors function.

I just found this terrifying line in `abelian_group.py`:

```
Hgensf = [x for x in Hgens if len(set(Ggens0).intersection(set(list(str(x)))))==0]
```

OUCH!   This will completely break if one makes, e.g., abelian groups with
generators that have more than one letter.  For example, in current Sage

```
sage: G.<a,aa,aaa> = AbelianGroup(3,[5,0,0])
sage: G.subgroup([a])

Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to C5, which is the subgroup of
Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to C5 x Z x Z
generated by [a]
sage: G.subgroup([aa])
