<a id='comment:1'></a>The attached patch:

1. Fixed the problem where %foobar with no input in the cell didn't give an error -- now it does, about
foobar not being defined.

2. While I was at it I improved how %foo modes in the notebook work, so that they can have everything on one line, e.g., 

```
   %magma Factorization(9038049823)
```
on a single line works in the notebook.

3. NOTE that the actual patch replaces a bunch of crappy hard to understand code with like 3 simple
    lines that fix all of the above.
