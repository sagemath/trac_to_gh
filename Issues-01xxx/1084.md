Consider this example:

```
sage: QQX = QQ['x']
sage: K.<x> = QQX
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<ipython console>", line 1
     K = QQ,names=(u'x',)); (x,) = K._first_ngens(Integer(1))
                         ^
<type 'exceptions.SyntaxError'>: invalid syntax
```

I don't care if this actually works; but if it doesn't, it should fail with a friendlier error message.  And where did the 'X' from QQX go?
