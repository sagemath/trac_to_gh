```
sage: x,y = var('x,y')
sage: plot3d(x*y, (x,-1,1), (y,-1,1))
```
is fast, but 

```
sage: x,y = var('x,y')
sage: plot3d(x*y, (-1,1), (-1,1))
```
is shockingly slow (and similar remarks for parametric plots).   The attached patch fixes this problem. 

This also fixes trac #1737.

This patch also moves plot3d_adaptive into plot3d (i.e., as an option), and deprecates globally exposing plot3d_adaptive.   This is natural to do in the context of this patch.
