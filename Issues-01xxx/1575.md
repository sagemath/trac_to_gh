Yes, that's what it is.  This is very useful, e.g., when using
vectors of data, computing Fourier transforms of them, etc. 
And it works in arbitrary dimensions.

I think that would be bad, because it's potentially confusing and
unsystematic.  However, the following -- which you will like --
would be acceptable to me:

   Redefine v.plot() so for dimensions <= 3 it does what you describe above,
i.e., draws an arrow, but for dimensions >= 4 it gives an error message.
Then add an option to plot called "step", which if set to True restores
the current behavior.    

In fact, this was my intention all along, and somehow I screwed up. 
The current plot signature for vectors is:

    def plot(self, xmin=0, xmax=1, eps=None, res=None,
             connect=True, step=False, **kwds):

Notice that step=False is already there!

In vector-plot.patch, plot is redefined to behave thusly:

* the option "type" has values 'arrow', 'point', and 'step'
* if 1 <= dimension <= 3, default type='arrow'
* if dimension > 3, default type='step'

The old plot function was renamed plot_step.

I've renamed the "type" option to "plot_type" and fixed the Arrow issue (the graphics interface changed around 2.9.3) and the doctest "eps" issue.

The vector-plot-updated.patch should be applied instead of vector-plot.patch.
