Attached bundle fixes the point below: now cerr is only used for
prompts, hence not at all in the library functions.  Instead, the
fatal error conditions which send output now to cout are followed by a
call to abort().  Clearly this should never happen except if there's a
bug.

Ralf -- a lot of those error outputs were in the linalg code which you
are going to refactor.

Secondly, I fixed the unintended output of "transposing..." reported by William.
