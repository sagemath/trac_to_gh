It is certainly a special option, but we need to document this.

This is biting people in practice and causes build failures on Itanium for example unless you know what you are doing. So *fix* this. Since this is my ticket now I am yelling at myself :)

```
Note that you absolutely cannot build Sage on itanium by
just extracting the tarball and typing make, because Sage
includes binaries for Fortran but not on Itanium. Thus you
have to explicitly tell the build process about the fortran
compiler and library location.  Do this by typing

  export SAGE_FORTRAN=/exact/path/to/gfortran
  export SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB=/path/to/fortran/libs/

Note that SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB is not documented
anywhere (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/1689),
and we've got away with this so far since there is only
one Itanium user of Sage in the world, at present.
