Attachment: **[sage-maple_interface_fixes.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1926/sage-maple_interface_fixes.patch.gz)**

This patch is very good except I don't like:

```
 	581	        # everything is supposed to be comparable in Python, so we define 
 	582	        # the comparison thus when no comparable in interfaced system. 
 	583	        return -1   
```

It would be better to compare something deterministic instead of always return -1, since you want that if a < b then it isn't the case that b < a; however your code will return that a < b *and* b < a, when the two aren't comparable.  Better would be to compare a hash of the string reps of the objects (can maple do that?!) or `_something_` deterministic and easy.

I copied the body of the `__cmp__` function from `sage/interfaces/expect.py`, and this comment came with it.

You're right. This was also a problem with `expect.py`. [attachment: sage-maple_interface_fixes.2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1926/sage-maple_interface_fixes.2.patch.gz)  changes the offending lines with

``` 
if hash(str(self)) < hash(str(other):
    return -1
else:
    return 1
```

Hopefully making `__cmp__` behave more like an order relation.

I've certainly made the mistake of defining cmp to return -1 always, which 
is very stupid.  If `__cmp__` currently does that in expect.py, please open
a ticket about it!

> if hash(str(self)) < hash(str(other):

> Hopefully making `__cmp__` behave more like an order relation. 

I do not like the above cmp (even though I used to write code
like that).  Imagine that self or orther is a 1000x1000 matrix,
say, which is completely reasonable.  Then the above would
literally take a very long time, since it would have to pull that matrix
back to Sage, etc.   Much better would be to do a comparison
that involves a Maple hash function.
