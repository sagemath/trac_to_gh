I've attached a brand new rebased patch which also fixes a critical bug in factorization (!) which may expose a bug in totallyrealfield, by the way.

I also changed factorizations to be immutable, as suggested by the referee, and they now no longer derive from list, so that `__cmp__` works correctly.
