Before:

```
sage@modular:~/d/sage/sage/structure$ sage -coverage factorization.py 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
factorization.py
SCORE factorization.py: 28% (6 of 21)

Missing documentation:
	 * __init__(self, x, unit=None, cr=False, sort=True)
	 * _set_cr(self, cr)
	 * sort(self)
	 * _cmp(f,g)
	 * _cmp(f,g)
	 * _cmp(f,g)
	 * __reduce__(self)
	 * _cr(self)
	 * _repr_(self)
	 * _latex_(self)
	 * __pow__(self, n)
	 * __invert__(self)
	 * Factorization_deduce_unit(x, mul)


Missing doctests:
	 * unit_part(self)
	 * expand(self)

```

After:

```
teragon:structure was$ sage -coverage factorization.py
----------------------------------------------------------------------
factorization.py
SCORE factorization.py: 100% (22 of 22)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

and I fixed numerous conceptual bugs/mistakes in that file.

I've attached a brand new rebased patch which also fixes a critical bug in factorization (!) which may expose a bug in totallyrealfield, by the way.

I also changed factorizations to be immutable, as suggested by the referee, and they now no longer derive from list, so that __cmp__ works correctly.
