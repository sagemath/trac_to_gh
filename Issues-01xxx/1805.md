Before:

```

----------------------------------------------------------------------
factorization.py
SCORE factorization.py: 28% (6 of 21)

Missing documentation:

	 * sort(self)

After:

```
teragon:structure was$ sage -coverage factorization.py
----------------------------------------------------------------------

and I fixed numerous conceptual bugs/mistakes in that file.

I've attached a brand new rebased patch which also fixes a critical bug in factorization (!) which may expose a bug in totallyrealfield, by the way.

I also changed factorizations to be immutable, as suggested by the referee, and they now no longer derive from list, so that `__cmp__` works correctly.
