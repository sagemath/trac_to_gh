As reported by Brandon Barker at http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/52683f508ccefb39#:

```
sage: solve([3==3, 1.00000000000000*x^3 == 0], x)
[]
sage: solve([1.00000000000000*x^3 == 0], x)
[x == 0]
sage: solve([1==3, 1.00000000000000*x^3 == 0], x)
[]
```

The first result is wrong; it should be the same as the second.

Note that "3==3" will immediately evaluate to a Python boolean True; probably solve() should just strip list elements that are True.
