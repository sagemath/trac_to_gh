There is a bug in the NetworkX function is_bipartite, which sometimes gives False positives. Due to this, a few examples in graph_generators.py give possibly bad output. I have labeled them with # random, and the following URL:

https://networkx.lanl.gov/ticket/132

Once this bug is fixed, and NX updated in Sage, someone needs to go fix those docstrings.
