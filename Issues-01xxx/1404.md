From F Clark:

```
A problem with latex processing in a notebook (otherwise a brilliant
feature):


Evaluating the input cell:

%latex

$y=\sin x$

% end of input

tries to process the TeX file:

\documentclass{article}\usepackage{fullpage}\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{graphicx}\usepackage{pstricks}
\pagestyle{empty}
\begin{document}

$y=\sin x$

% end of input\end{document}

but pdfTeX fails, because the \end{document} gets commented out.  The
reason is that  '\\end{document}' is tagged on to the end of the input
text rather than '\n\\end{document}'.

The following would seem to solve the problem:

diff -r 7110a20969c8 sage/misc/latex.py

Hmm, since now both branches of the if case are identical except the additional newline couldn't we make collapse the if statement?

Cheers,
