This is the bug that was causing #1231; the fix there was easy, but as cwitty points out, the underlying bug is still there. It's something specifically to do with an entry becoming 0 in a matrix. I haven't looked into this at all; it's probably easy pickings for someone who knows the coercion code.

Here's a sample session:

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(GF(5),2,2)

sage: A = M([1,0,0,1])

sage: A - int(-1)
 
[2 0]
[0 2]

sage: B = M([4,0,0,1])

sage: B - int(-1)


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGBUS: A bus error occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------

The problem is very likely related to this:

```
sage: matrix(GF(5),2, [4,0,0,1]).parent()(int(6))
[6 0]
[0 6]
```

This is over GF(5), so we should not see 6!
