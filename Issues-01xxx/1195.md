Currently, the method to obtain the length of a list or sequence is:

```
my_list=Sequence([1,2,3,4])
len(my_list)
```

This is not consistent with either MAGMA or PARI, and there is no method attached to the sequence or list which gives the length.

I would like to suggest that a method be added so that

```
my_list.length()
```

would give the answer ``4''.

On the other hand, len() is the standard Python way of doing things.

This is not quite true -- there is a `.__len__()` function that `len()` calls.

Perhaps this should be at the level of `SageObject`: `.length()` calls `.__len__()?`  This is irritating but not idiomatic python, so I vote to keep it as is.

I think this would be annoying.  It also adds to the clutter when one does X.[tab]
on a sage object X.  And everybody learns about len(...) in Python pretty soon.
