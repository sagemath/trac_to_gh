Well, there isn't much we can do to fix this since:

```
* Permission to modify the software is granted, but not the right to
* distribute the complete modified source code.  Modifications are to
* be distributed as patches to the released version.  Permission to
* distribute binaries produced by compiling modified sources is granted,
* provided you
*   1. distribute the corresponding source modifications from the
*    released version in the form of a patch file along with the binaries,
*   2. add special version identification to distinguish your version
*    in addition to the base release version number,
*   3. provide your name and address as the primary contact for the
*    support of your modified version, and
*   4. retain our contact information in regard to use of the base
*    software.
* Permission to distribute the released version of the source code along
* with corresponding source modifications in the form of a patch file is
* granted with same provisions 2 through 4 for binary distributions.
*
* This software is provided "as is" without express or implied warranty
* to the extent permitted by applicable law.
```
We could try updating to gnuplot 4.2.2. It has been discussed around here before that the name gnuplot is very misleading since this isn't a GNU project at all.

Cheers,

Michael

We won't fix this because of the lame gnuplot license.  Also Sage doesn't link in 
gnuplot in any binary way, so whatever standard system-wide way one might use to install gnuplot will work fine with sage if it works at all.
