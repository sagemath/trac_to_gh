The optional gnuplotpy package doesn't work with numpy (requires Numeric). Luckily this is fixed by doing a global search an replace of Numeric with numpy. Having done that 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jkantor/spkgs/gnuplotpy-1.7.p3.spkg

now works.

For the sake of the reviewer, could you give an example of a command sequence that fails with the current gnuplotpy package and works with the new one?
