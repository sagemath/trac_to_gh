These need to be nicely test, sped up, etc., then
made into docstrings:

```
Here are a few cool space curves.
I'd like to make more from
http://www.math.umd.edu/research/bianchi/Gifspacecurves/spcu.html
and
http://virtualmathmuseum.org/SpaceCurves/
If anyone knows of some parametric equations for them, I'd appreciate it.

I not so sure about that. The surfaces are at

but if you go to the bottom of that page, you see 

```

    This function is used internally by the parametric_plot3d command.

Hi,

Type

```
sage: parametric_plot3d?
```

If you don't see the examples above (I don't), then this isn't in Sage yet.

There are already a ton of examples (almost annoyingly many) in the docstring for parametric_plot3d.  I don't think that adding the few listed here is helpful at this point.
