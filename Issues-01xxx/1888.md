These need to be nicely test, sped up, etc., then
made into docstrings:

```
Here are a few cool space curves.
I'd like to make more from
http://www.math.umd.edu/research/bianchi/Gifspacecurves/spcu.html
and
http://virtualmathmuseum.org/SpaceCurves/
If anyone knows of some parametric equations for them, I'd appreciate it.

I not so sure about that. The surfaces are at
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/html/ref/module-sage.plot.plot3d.parametric-plot3d.html
but if you go to the bottom of that page, you see 

```

parametric_plot3d_curve(  	f, urange, plot_points)

    This function is used internally by the parametric_plot3d command. 
```
with no examples.

Hi,

Type

```
sage: parametric_plot3d?
```

If you don't see the examples above (I don't), then this isn't in Sage yet.

Is this code still not in Sage? It should be trivial to add those curves to the plot3d.py docstring somewhere.

There are already a ton of examples (almost annoyingly many) in the docstring for parametric_plot3d.  I don't think that adding the few listed here is helpful at this point.
