It would be really useful to have

   sage: A.right_kernel()

to mean the set of vectors v such that A*v = 0, i.e., the vectors on the right.
That would have to be clearly documented -- the function itself would
be defined in matrix2.pyx and would just transpose A and call kernel
on the resulting transpose.  It would also cache the result.  

We have A.right_eigenvectors() in some cases (e.g., A an RDF matrix), and
the documentation makes the meaning very clear:

------------------------------

sage: A = random_matrix(RDF,3)
sage: A.right_eigenvectors()

Namespace:      Interactive
Docstring:
    
            Computes the eigenvalues and *right* eigenvectors of this
            matrix m acting *from the left*.  I.e., vectors v such that
            m * v = lambda*v, where v is viewed as a column vector. 
------------------------------



It actually might be possible to define

   sage: A.left_kernel()

and

   sage: A.right_kernel()

and have
  
  sage: A.kernel()

default to A.right_kernel() without breaking sage into a million pieces.
One would first define only A.left_kernel and A.right_kernel.  Then
one would go through all of Sage and make sure every instance of
A.kernel where A is a matrix is changed to A.left_kernel -- since that
is what is currently assumed, then doctest everything, and finally
define a function kernel() in matrix2.pyx, which just calls self.right_kernel().

This would of course break code not in Sage that relies on the current
behavior, which is not desirable, but not a deal breaker either at this
stage in Sage development. 


Since x*A and A*x are both defined for x = vector(...), I think this
would be reasonable. 


Another possibility would be to *only* define A.left_kernel() and
A.right_kernel() and deprecate A.kernel().   That seems a little
 too anal to me. 

If we decide to do
the above, what are the other similar functions to worry about?
Certainly eigenspaces.
