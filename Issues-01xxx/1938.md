Hi Robert, 

the patch looks very nice, but I am seeing a massive number of merge conflict against 2.10.1.rc0. Could you take 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-2.10.1/sage-2.10.1.rc0.tar

and rebase the patch? There have been a lot of tricky merges in the plotting code in 2.10.1.x, so it isn't really a surprise that there are problems :(

Cheers,

Michael

Nope, but it has been suggested a couple time to create a devel repo somewhere on sagemath.org to offer such a way to testbuild. I also saw that R failed to build for you on OSX 10.4 - I am building rc0 now on a 10.4 box to fix the issue.

Wow, this is amazing compared to before!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Wow!  This is an awesome patch full of beautiful code.   It will have a major impact on how the calculus code is used in the future, and make things like numerical integration, ode's, etc. way way way faster. 

refereeing:

* The the file morphism.pyx there are a bunch of print statements that shouldn't be there.  They must have been for debugging purposes:

```
    cdef Element _call_c_impl(self, Element x):
        print type(self), self
        print <long>self._call_c
        print <long>Morphism._call_c
        print <long>FormalCoercionMorphism._call_c
        raise NotImplementedError

```

* More doctests are needed, e.g., L3096 of calculus.py, has two functions without doctests:

```
    def fast_float_function(self, vars):
        return self._fast_float_(vars)

    def _fast_float_(self, *vars):
        try:
```

* Is ext/ really the right place for fast_eval.pyx?  Maybe.  I'm just not sure...

* I wish there were a few sentences at the top of fast_eval.pyx about what it does. 

* There's still a lot in fast_eval.pyx that needs doctests; it's coverage score is only 14%:

```
teragon:ext was$ sage -coverage fast_eval.pyx
----------------------------------------------------------------------
fast_eval.pyx
ERROR: Please define a s == loads(dumps(s)) doctest.
SCORE fast_eval.pyx: 14% (6 of 41)
```

* This code in fast_eval.pyx is clearly TOTALLY WRONG and would give an infinite loop if it were actually tested: 

```
+    def sec(self):
+        return ~self.sec()   
```

   

Otherwise it looks good to me.   Fix the above then this patch should get marked with "positive review"

Do not apply the above patch last patch--everything passes on my computer including the lines 

```
sage: list(h)
['push 1.5', 'load 0', 'add', 'call sin(1)']
```

instead of 


```
sage: list(h)
['push 1.5', 'load 0', 'add', 'call 1 0x942acc20']
```

It looks like you didn't do a sage -b after applying merging the changes.

**Attachment:** [trac-1938-fix_some_docstrings.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1938/trac-1938-fix_some_docstrings.patch)
