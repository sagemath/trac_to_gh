I'm attaching another patch in response to mabshoff's review.  There is, in fact, a pLength singular API.

Note that this does the _sig_xx stuff for the code in these methods:
__pow__,__floordiv__,factor,gcd,lcm,quo_rem,resultant
Obviously, it would be trivial to make data large enough so that any of these take an eternity to compute.

As to the corruption issues with a signal.  Huh?  It's the same story with virtually every other _sig_on/_sig_off in the sage code.  One should *expect* memory leaks and tolerate corruption with any of them.

This function also loops through the polynomial:

```
PINLINE0 int pLength(poly a)
{
  int l = 0;
  while (a!=NULL) {
    pIter(a);
    l++;
  }
  return l;
}
```

However, I'd say we should still apply this patch and see if something gets too slow. Also, all algorithms which involve `_sig_on`/`_sig_off` should be at least quadratic in the number of monomials so this linear operation shouldn't matter anyway, right?

I second that.

However, the patch fails to apply to 2.10.1.rc2
