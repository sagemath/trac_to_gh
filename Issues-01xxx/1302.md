The problem is:

sage: A.<t> = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: (-2*t^(-4) + O(t^8)).integral()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
IndexError: list index out of range

This is because of  this code in rings/laurent_series_ring_element.pyx not
being coded correctly around line 880:
        if n < 0:
            v = [a[i]/(n+i+1) for i in range(-1-n)] + [0]
        else:
            v = []
        v += [a[i]/(n+i+1) for i in range(max(-n,0), len(a))]
        try:

So you should fix that and submit a patch :-).

IndexError occurs when the highest power in the Laurent series is less than -2. The two lines in the patch add appropriate number of zero coefficients so that this does not happen. I consider this a bandaid solution, but at least it works.

We should add doctests to verify that the patch works. I am still willing to merge this patch for 2.9.2, but then I would open a new ticket to add doctests to test this.
