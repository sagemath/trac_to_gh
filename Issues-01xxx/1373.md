On my laptop (32-bit x86 Linux, Debian testing) I get the following doctest failure in 2.8.15.alpha2:

```
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/modules/quotient_module.py    **********************************************************************
File "quotient_module.py", line 161:
    sage: cmp(Q1, 5)
Expected:
    1                  
Got:
    -1
**********************************************************************
```

The code compares type(Q1) and type(5); since type objects have no useful pre-defined comparison operation, this just compares the memory addresses of the type objects.

I think the doctest should just be removed.

Component: **algebraic geometry**
