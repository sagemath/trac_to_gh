For the upgrade path we need to make sure to rebuild certain python dependent spkgs:

* http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-2.10/alpha4/r-2.6.1.p8.spkg
* http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-2.10/alpha4/matplotlib-0.91.1.p2.spkg
* http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-2.10/alpha4/zodb3-3.7.0.p0.spkg
