To get someone started, here are the rules I used above, with a bit of
extra grouping (the {} brace pairs) to make sure things work out all right.

\frac{a}{b} -> {{a} over {b}}

\sin -> sin

\cos -> cos

\cdot -> cdot

also, I saw that:

\left( -> left (
\right) -> right )

etc.

Whoever does it might click through the openoffice equation toolbar
which gives the openoffice code for the various symbols.
```

Doesn't use OOo MathML inside the ODF document? You can import MathML in OOo this way:

Writer -> Insert -> Object -> Formula - then there: Open -> MathML 1.01

So I would suggest to write a **formula to MathML converter**, since this could be also used inside e.g. HTML pages. (firefox renders them ...)
