To get someone started, here are the rules I used above, with a bit of
extra grouping (the {} brace pairs) to make sure things work out all right.

\frac{a}{b} -> {{a} over {b}}

\sin -> sin

\cos -> cos

\cdot -> cdot

also, I saw that:

\left( -> left (
\right) -> right )

etc.

Whoever does it might click through the openoffice equation toolbar
which gives the openoffice code for the various symbols.

Doesn't use OOo MathML inside the ODF document? You can import MathML in OOo this way:

Writer -> Insert -> Object -> Formula - then there: Open -> MathML 1.01

So I would suggest to write a **formula to MathML converter**, since this could be also used inside e.g. HTML pages. (firefox renders them ...)

The next major release of OpenOffice will have LaTeX capabilities so a LaTeX to open_office converter will not be needed.
