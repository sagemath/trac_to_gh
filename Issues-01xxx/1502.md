This is wrong:

```
sage: f = function('Gamma', var('z'), var('w')); f
Gamma(z, w)
sage: f(2)
Gamma(z, 2)
sage: f(2,5)
Gamma(5, 2)
```

It should be

```
sage: f = function('Gamma', var('z'), var('w')); f
Gamma(z, w)
sage: f(2)
Gamma(2, w)
sage: f(2,5)
Gamma(2, 5)
```

Note that this works:

```
sage: f(z,w) = function('Gamma'); f
(z, w) |--> Gamma(z, w)
sage: f(2)
Gamma(2, w)
sage: f(2,5)
Gamma(2, 5)
```

Component: **calculus**
