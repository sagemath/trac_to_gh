When trying to run install_scripts()  (i.e. installing from an RPM), the desired installation directory is /usr/bin so that when the files are installed, they are available in the $PATH. This causes problems with the kash and M2 scripts. Since in order for the install_scripts() to detect those executables they have to be in the path (usually /usr/bin also), install_scripts() will try to overwrite those files with the script version. This is a problem. A possible improvement is to install the kash and M2 scripts as sage.kash or sage.M2 if install_scripts() detects that it will be overwriting the respective executables.

Ok, this should be easy enough to fix. Axiom should probably also be installed as sage.axiom or something similar.
