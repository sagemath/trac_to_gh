Cool!

And, this is already in Sage.   Just put

[extensions]
record=

in your .hgrc file, and do

   hg record

and you'll get to cherry pick.

This should be documented in the programming guide.

Ticket #8206 adds some pointers about "hg record". Maybe we could expand on that with the information here.

Looks good to me. The idea here is to provide pointers to *record as an advanced tool for patch management.
