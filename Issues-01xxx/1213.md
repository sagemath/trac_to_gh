I think that mpl_wrapper.py is obsolete, dead code.  Nothing else in Sage refers to it, it talks about an optional matplotlib package (when matplotlib has been standard in Sage for quite a while), and it mentions downloading matplotlib from UCSD.

Also, in mpl_wrapper.py it mentions the "sage -mpl" option.  In sage-sage, it says

```
    echo "  -mpl          -- run with matplotlib support (requires optional matplotlib package)"
```
but "sage -mpl" does not act obviously different than just "sage".  I'm guessing that all the "-mpl" stuff should be removed from sage-sage, as well.
