For example:

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: (x^5 * (x^2 - 9999)^2 - 1).real_root_intervals()

  1)]
sage: len((x^5 * (x^2 - 9999)^2 - 1).real_root_intervals())
4
```

This example returns 4 roots, even though the polynomial in question actually has only 3.

This is because the root finder finds a list of intervals known to have either 0 or 1 root, but is not correctly weeding out some of the intervals that are known to have 0 roots.
