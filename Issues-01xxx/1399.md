```
There are some operations which are either unimplemented or give (what I would consider to be) wrong answers:

N=-7

N.is_prime()
>>false

I believe that this should give the answer "true".

Also, if one tries
`ZZ.ideal(N).is_prime()`

one gets a NotImplementedError.

Component: **basic arithmetic**

<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

NO!!!!!!

The change to ideal.py is fine, but making is_prime(-7) return True is *wrong*.

Justification:

```
sage: gp.eval('isprime(-7)')
'0'
sage: prime_range(-10,10)
[2, 3, 5, 7]
```
and in Wikipedia it says:
 
"In mathematics, a prime number (or a prime) is a natural number which has exactly two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and itself."

and more importantly it says the same thing in my elementary number theory book.

So NO.

However, the change to ideal.py is fine.

* the is_prime() method for ideals in a PID is almost as in mhansen's patch, but it tests if the generator is_irreducible() rather than is_prime().  So not only does it work properly for integer ideals, it also now works for ideals in polynomial rings (in one variable) over a field -- see doctests.
