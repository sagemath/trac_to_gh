While valgrinding the `fplll.pyx` doctest I came across the following:

```

==15667==    by 0x48328C: PyEval_EvalFrameEx (ceval.c:3660)
```
The problem is in fplll.pxi:

```
 void ZZ_mat_delete "delete "(ZZ_mat *mem)
```
It doesn't clear the mpzs allocated in fplll.pyx's `__new__`:

```
    def __new__(self, Matrix_integer_dense A):
        cdef int i,j
        self._lattice = ZZ_mat_new(A._nrows,A._ncols)

        cdef Z_NR *t

        for i from 0 <= i < A._nrows:
            for j from 0 <= j < A._ncols:
                t = Z_NR_new()
                t.set_mpz_t(A._matrix[i][j])
                self._lattice.Set(i,j,t[0])

    def __dealloc__(self):
        """
        Destroy internal data.
        """
        ZZ_mat_delete(self._lattice)
```
Should be easy enough to fix.

Cheers,

Michael
