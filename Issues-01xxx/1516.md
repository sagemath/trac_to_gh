See spkg at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/robertwb/3d/jmol-11.2.14.spkg

Note, this is 14MB, but it is just the full Jmol bundle which has about 4MB docs, 6MB source, and 3M redundant applet binaries, not all of which we may want to include. 

I realize the bundle has other patches from other tickets (e.g. #1533), but these are needed.
