The real problem can be boiled down a little:

```
sage: G = Graph('^????????????????????{??N??@w??FaGa?PCO@CP?AGa?_QO?Q@G?CcA??cc????Bo????{????F_')
sage: G.relabel([i+1 for i in xrange(31)])
sage: perm = {4:16, 16:4}
sage: A = G.canonical_label()
sage: B = G.relabel(perm, inplace=False).canonical_label()
sage: A == B
False
