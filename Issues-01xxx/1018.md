Computing a*b*c*d as (a*b)*(c*d) rather than ((a*b)*c)*d can take better advantage of asymptotically fast multiplication. On the other hand the latter can take better advantage of inplace operators and has less overhead.

This patch computes the product in a balanced way down to a certain level (default 5) and can be much faster. Only associativity (not commutativity) is assumed. 

```
sage: time a = prod([1..50000])
CPU times: user 0.08 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.08 s
Wall time: 0.08
sage: time L = [1..50000]
CPU times: user 0.02 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.03 s
Wall time: 0.03

```

vs a generator (which is multiplied in order)

```
sage: time a = prod(1..50000)
CPU times: user 1.11 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 1.12 s
Wall time: 1.12
sage: time L = list(1..50000)
CPU times: user 0.18 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.19 s
Wall time: 0.19
```

There is also a class sage.misc.misc_c.NonAssociative to see the exact product tree. 

```
sage: from sage.misc.misc_c import NonAssociative
sage: L = [NonAssociative(label) for label in 'abcdef']
sage: prod(L)
(((a*b)*c)*((d*e)*f))
```
