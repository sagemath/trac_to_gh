I get 

```
Traceback (most recent call last):    print range(MyInt(2**34), MyInt(2**34+10))

TypeError: range() integer start argument expected, got instance.
```

On a 64-bit machine, try 

```
print range(2**64, 2**64+10)
print range(MyInt(2**64), MyInt(2**64+10))
```

I believe this is a bug in Python, and have reported it here: http://bugs.python.org/issue1533
