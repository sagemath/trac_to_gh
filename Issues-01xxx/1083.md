The following is not correct:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(ZZ['x'].0^2 + 2, 'a')
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(ZZ['x'].0 - a, 'b')
sage: L
Number Field in b with defining polynomial x - a over its base field
sage: L(a)
0
```
This is the root of the following bugs:

```
sage: a.trace(K)
sage: a.norm(K)
sage: a.matrix(K)

Attachment: **[craigcitro-1083.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1083/craigcitro-1083.patch.gz)**

So I got a response from the pari team that the problem on their end is fixed in svn. However, given the fact that the Pari release cycle is slower than ours, I've added a workaround to Sage. Looking at the other tests Nick had above, I noticed that for any NumberFieldElement a, a.matrix(QQ) didn't work. I fixed this while I was there, and added a few doctests.
