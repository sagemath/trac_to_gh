The following is not correct:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(ZZ['x'].0^2 + 2, 'a')
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(ZZ['x'].0 - a, 'b')
sage: L
Number Field in b with defining polynomial x - a over its base field
sage: L(a)
0
```
This is the root of the following bugs:

```
sage: a.trace(K)
sage: a.norm(K)
sage: a.matrix(K)

I have a fix for this, but I've also reported the bug to the Pari folks -- given that this doesn't seem terribly pressing, if they're going to fix it upstream, it seems like just waiting would be the best approach. If I don't hear anything from them in a few days, I'll post a patch.
