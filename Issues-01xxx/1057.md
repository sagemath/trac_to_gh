```
sage: sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 - 5)
sage: sage: B = K.maximal_order().basis();
sage: B[1].parent().base_ring() # this is bad
Rational Field
sage: B[1].parent().base()
Integer Ring
```

Also, `_rmul_`, etc needs to be re-implemented.

Attachment: **[1057-fix-order-basering.hg.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1057/1057-fix-order-basering.hg.gz)**

Orders now have correct baserings. 

Whoever implemented the _base attribute might want to look at how it overrides the (cdef) ParentBase._base attribute, and the implications that might have. 

This patch makes patch #1044 obsolete.
