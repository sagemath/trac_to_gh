The following should work and be instant (this possibly requires the optional `databases_gap` package).

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(5)
sage: G.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()

RuntimeError:
Gap produced error output
Variable: 'Sym' must have a value


   executing $sage85:=Sym( [ 1 .. 5 ] );;
```


I really wanted this to find out which representative subgroups
are transitive, but can't do that either since `G.is_transitive()`
isn't wrapped -- since Gap has `IsTransitive`, this would be trivial to wrap.

**Assignee:** joyner

**Resolution:** fixed

Attachment [1187-permgroups.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket1187/1187-permgroups.patch) by @aghitza created at 2008-04-24 22:25:44

The attached patch fixes what I believe is a bug in conjugacy_classes_subgroups(), and adds the method is_transitive().  Note that the optional GAP database is *not* required.

Timings before the patch:

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(6)
sage: time cl = G.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 151.62 s, sys: 16.75 s, total: 168.37 s
Wall time: 175.53
```

and after:

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(6)
sage: time cl = G.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 0.54 s, sys: 0.09 s, total: 0.63 s
Wall time: 1.35
```

Is this based on 3.0? I am getting aborted when I try to hg_sage.apply it.

Looks like a great patch, adding functionality, fixing a bug and correcting some typos in the permgp.py docstrings. Passes sage -testall on an ubuntu 7.10amd64 machine and an intel macbook running OS10.4.
