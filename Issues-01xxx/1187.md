The following should work and be instant (this possibly requires the optional `databases_gap` package).

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(5)
sage: G.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()

RuntimeError:
Gap produced error output
Variable: 'Sym' must have a value


   executing $sage85:=Sym( [ 1 .. 5 ] );;
```


I really wanted this to find out which representative subgroups
are transitive, but can't do that either since `G.is_transitive()`
isn't wrapped -- since Gap has `IsTransitive`, this would be trivial to wrap.

The attached patch fixes what I believe is a bug in conjugacy_classes_subgroups(), and adds the method is_transitive().  Note that the optional GAP database is *not* required.

Timings before the patch:

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(6)
sage: time cl = G.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 151.62 s, sys: 16.75 s, total: 168.37 s
Wall time: 175.53
```

and after:

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(6)
sage: time cl = G.conjugacy_classes_subgroups()
CPU times: user 0.54 s, sys: 0.09 s, total: 0.63 s
Wall time: 1.35
```

Is this based on 3.0? I am getting aborted when I try to hg_sage.apply it.
