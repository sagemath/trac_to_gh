I think it is just printing out the list for you to see and the "print" function for a graphics object displays the object, so you see each object "printed" out.

It would be nice if the text display indicated this, instead of "[, ]".  Maybe something like "[<Graphic object>, <Graphic object>]", since the objects actually are there.  It misleadingly looks like you have an empty list.

I agree.  However, I have *absolutely no clue* how or even if this is possible to implement in Python.  I almost think it isn't.   More precisely, we could easily
make it so we have
 
 sage: plot(sin, 0,1)
 <Graphic object>
 [an actual image]

but that would be really ugly.

Actually, I vaguely recall there is a "displayhook" in Python that is called
when one types

```
 sage: <arbitrary object>
```
Maybe we could overload that so if <arbitrary object> is a list or tuple then
instead of calling `_repr_` on each graphics object, we call __str__.

It's weird.  Every time I think something is impossible I immediately seem to think of a solution...

Another idea: make it return <Graphic object> whenever it creates an object; but in IPython/the notebook, check to see if it's about to print "<Graphic object>", and if so print nothing instead.

I think either of these solutions works okay, but I prefer the first since it clearly tells the user that they just constructed a list of graphic objects.

```
sage: [graphic1, graphic2]
# Displays each graphic, as well as:
[<graphic object>, <graphic object>]
```

```
sage: [graphic1, graphic2]
# Displays each graphic, but doesn't print anything
```

Just for comparison, Mathematica 6 actually prints out the graphics, surrounded by the delimiters (so the graphics are really inside the list and appear that way) when using the notebook and prints out just a string representation {-Graphics-} when used from the command line.

This idea of Jason Grout is the sort of thing we can do to solve this sort of problem:

```
def pretty_print (object):
    if object is None:
        return
    if isinstance(object, (sage.plot.plot.Graphics, sage.plot.plot3d.base.Graphics3d)):
        print repr(object)
        return
    import __builtin__
    __builtin__._=object
    try:
        print html("$$"+latex(object)+"$$")
    except:
        import sys
        sys.__displayhook__(object)

def notebook_pretty(enable=True):
    import sys
    if enable:
        sys.displayhook = pretty_print
    else:
        sys.displayhook = sys.__displayhook__

# To enable the pretty-printing
notebook_pretty(True)
```
