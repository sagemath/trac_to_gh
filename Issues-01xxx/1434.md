since I'm moving the scipy sandbox stuff we are using into a separate spkg,
I want to remove the corresponding stuff from the scipy spkg. 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jkantor/spkgs/scipy-20071020-0.6.p2.spkg

this has the added benefit of shrinking the scipy package by about 2mb.

Component: **numerical**
