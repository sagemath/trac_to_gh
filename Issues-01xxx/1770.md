I already wrote the corresponding code for capped-rel elements, and it should be done for these other types. I'm assigning this to myself for now, but if anyone wants to do this, it's pretty easy -- you could mostly copy what I did in the capped-rel case, and do this with essentially no knowledge of how the pari stuff works.

Component: **padics**
