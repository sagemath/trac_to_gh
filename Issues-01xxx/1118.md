Thus we should figure out how to do this in a portable way. May the POSIX gurus speak up!

I forgot to include the actual code that was run.

```
def FindGroupOrder(p,s):
   K = GF(p)
   v = K(4*s)
   u = K(s^2-5)
   x = u^3
   b = 4*x*v
   a = (v-u)^3*(3*u+v)
   A = a/b-2
   x = x/v^3
   b = x^3 + A*x^2 + x
   E = EllipticCurve(K,[0,b*A,0,b^2,0])
   return factor(E.cardinality())
