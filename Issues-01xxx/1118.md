The wall time is not very useful (my machine has a load of 3-4). It would be more useful to have to cpu time used by the spawned processes, or simply the total cpu time used by SAGE and those processes.

Thus we should figure out how to do this in a portable way. May the POSIX gurus speak up!

I forgot to include the actual code that was run.

```
def FindGroupOrder(p,s):
   K = GF(p)
   v = K(4*s)
   u = K(s^2-5)
   x = u^3
   b = 4*x*v
   a = (v-u)^3*(3*u+v)
   A = a/b-2
   x = x/v^3
   b = x^3 + A*x^2 + x
   E = EllipticCurve(K,[0,b*A,0,b^2,0])
   return factor(E.cardinality())
