Unfortunately there is a bug somewhere or some sort of mathematical contradiction going on here, as the following calculation illustrates:

```
sage: M = ModularSymbols(1,12)
sage: d = M.cuspidal_submodule().rational_period_mapping()
sage: for i in range(11):
...      print i, d(M.modular_symbol((i, 0,oo)))
0 (1620/691, 0)
1 (0, 1)
2 (-1, 0)
3 (0, -25/48)
4 (9/14, 0)
5 (0, 5/12)
6 (-9/14, 0)
7 (0, -25/48)
8 (1, 0)
9 (0, 1)
10 (-1620/691, 0)
sage: L = eisenstein_series_Lseries(12)
sage: L(3)
2.89830333000000e-17
sage: L(5)
7.35601685000000e-17
```

The modular symbols calculation verifies that L(i) for odd integers i=3,5, etc. is nonzero.  This also agrees with the Riemann Hypothesis for L(Delta, s).  However, for some strange reason the Dokchitser L that you're computing is 0 at some odd integers.  This means there is something wrong. 

I haven't figured out what yet.  I'll let Jen see if she can.

This can't go in sage as is though.

*Doh* -- I was being stupid / confused between Eisenstein series and cusp form, since it was a long day.

Change this to a positive review!
