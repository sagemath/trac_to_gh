```
The user has three new options of finite extension fields:
1. "legendre" - as the name implies: using Legendre symbols

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(3^10)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(k,[k.random_element() for _ in range(5)])
sage: time E.cardinality('legendre')
CPU times: user 0.39 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 0.44 s
Wall time: 0.44
58997
```

1. "bsgs" - using the Baby-Step Giant-Step algorithm

```
sage: time E.cardinality('bsgs')
CPU times: user 0.02 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.02 s
Wall time: 0.02
58997
```

1. "heuristic" - use "legendre" if q<100 (as in mwrank) and "bsgs" else

```
sage: time E.cardinality()
CPU times: user 0.02 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.02 s
Wall time: 0.02
58997
```

Neither of these will win any speed records but it is *much* better than the naive algorithm used before.

This seems to rely on an earlier patch. (#1120?) Couldn't apply, but mostly looks good. 

One concern I have that the use of the hasse bound may not be enough for extremely small cardinality (maybe I haven't thought this through enough). It isn't used there by default of course. Very clean implementation of the algorithm though!

Yes, it should not go in, my bad, sorry. I quickly hacked to together
the algorithm in "Elliptic Curves" by Lawrence Washington and 
apparently screwed up badly on the way. He writes:

"""
7. If we are looking for the #E(F_q), then repeat steps (1)-(6)  
[finding the order of a point, malb] with randomly chosen points 
in E(F_q) until the greatest common multiple of the orders divides
only one integer N with q + 1 -2*sqrt(q) <= N <= q + 1 + 2*sqrt(q). 
Then N = #E(F_q).
"""

Apparently I overread the 'divides' part. Also, what is a 
'greatest common divisor'?

and David again:

```
I still don't believe this algorithm.

Look at this example:

sage: K.<a> = GF(3^4)
sage: K.polynomial()
a^4 + 2*a^3 + 2
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K, [2*a^2 + 2*a + 2, 2*a^3 + 2*a + 1])
sage: points = E.points()
sage: len(points)
100
sage: LCM([P.order() for P in points])
10

The hasse bound says the the number of points must be in [64, 100].  
But if the best we can do is show divisibility by 10, that's not  
enough information: it could be 70, 80, 90, or 100.

Does Washington place any other restrictions on the finite field or  
on the curve?

Since the code in question was only determining the group
order, not structure, as long as the table of exceptions is dealt with
properly the basic algorithm should work.

By the way, Larry Washington is currently preparing a second edition
of his book and he is planning to incorporate this correction,
attributing it to me and David Harvey.

Thanks to Nick for tidying up my patch.

Only one comment:  while I approve of separating out the point counting for j=0 and j=1728 as done here, I don't think that the name "supersingular j invariant" is right here.  Curves are supersingular iff the cardinality is coprime to the characteristic (with many many equivalent definitions), which is not the same thing.

Hence I would suggest changing the name of that function.

I have added a new patch 8312.patch which is to applied along with all the previous ones, and fixes a few rather minor things.

Merged 1130-jcremona-ncalexan-final.patch in Sage 2.10.2.alpha1 - credit in the official log did get screwed up, so my apologies to John & Nick.

Cheers,
