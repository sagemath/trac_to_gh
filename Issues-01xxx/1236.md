Hi, I needed some calculation period benchmark for pairings. I could
not find anything build in, but the following implementation solved my

Thanks!  I've made adding this to Sage proper ticket

   https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/1236

Can you make some sort of GPL-compatible license statement about your code,
if you haven't already?

I don't like that meaning for solve, since it is misleading to me, and
is inconsistent. e.g., what about:

sage: solve(x^5 + x^3 + 1, x)
[0 == x^5 + x^3 + 1]

When there is no explicit solution, maxima usually returns something
to explicitly indicate this.

Also, as a data point, Maple returns an approximate solution if
it doesn't find an exact one:

sage: maple.eval('solve(38.40000000*exp(1)^(-1200*t)-9.600000000*exp(1)^(-300*t),
t)')
'.1540327068e-2'

Likewise with Mathematica:

sage: mathematica.eval('Solve[0.004*(9600/E^(1200*t) - 2400/E^(300*t))
== 0, t]')

Solve::ifun: Inverse functions are being used by Solve, so some solutions may
    not be found; use Reduce for complete solution information.

        {{t -> 0.00154033}}


sage: mathematica('x^5 + x^3 + 1 == 0').Solve(x)

{{x -> Root[1 + #1^3 + #1^5 & , 1, 0]},
 {x -> Root[1 + #1^3 + #1^5 & , 2, 0]},
 {x -> Root[1 + #1^3 + #1^5 & , 3, 0]},
 {x -> Root[1 + #1^3 + #1^5 & , 4, 0]}, {x -> Root[1 + #1^3 + #1^5 & , 5, 0]}}

Shouldn't we be able to write something that is way faster than Maxima?
What do people even benchmark in the context of calculus?

Weil, Tate and ate pairings are know implemented in sage. I think this ticket may be closed.

The reference
  [http://maths.straylight.co.uk/archives/104](http://maths.straylight.co.uk/archives/104)
shows implementation using elliptic net. This is not in sage now but this is not needed for the Tate pairing.
