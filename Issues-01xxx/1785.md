It's sort of half-way there.  You can do:

sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + x - (3^3-3))
sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a')
sage: X = E(K)

but stupidly X is wrong:

sage: X
Abelian group of points on Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 - x over Rational Field

though:

sage: X.domain()
Spectrum of Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + x - 24

However, 

sage: P = X([3,a]);
boom with a TypeError

So this obviously needs work.  In fact, this counts as a bug.
