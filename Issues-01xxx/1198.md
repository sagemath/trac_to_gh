<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

Something was going on with files from older numpy versions persisting and screwing up the scipy build. The solution is to rm -rf the numpy directory in site-packages
before a newer version of numpy is built.

The numpy script is supposed to do this before it builds but it was doing

rm -rf $SAGE_LOCAL/local/lib/python2.5/site-package/numpy 

instead of

rm -rf $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python2.5/site-packages/numpy

so this wasn't happening.

If the old numpy is correctly deleted, the new one and scipy build fine (for me at least)

New numpy and scipy packages to fix that problem and include the version number in
the file name.
