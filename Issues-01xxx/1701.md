I just checked, it is not merged yet:

multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx in Sage 2.9.2:

```
    def __dealloc__(self):
        """
        """
        cdef ring *oldRing = NULL
        if currRing != self._ring:
            oldRing = currRing
            rChangeCurrRing(self._ring)
        rDelete(self._ring)
        if oldRing != NULL:
            rChangeCurrRing(oldRing)
```
