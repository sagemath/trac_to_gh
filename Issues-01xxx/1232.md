Outcome is similar for higher weights, e.g. for weight 100 I get "self has dimension 33, but sum of dimensions of factors is 65".

Added a fix for this. The issue was what I mentioned above, namely the fact that +1 == -1 in characteristic 2. Alex Ghitza offered the following explanation of why this is a mathematically valid fix:

Here's my line of thought:
-- in Sage, "simple" means "simple as a module over the anemic Hecke
algebra adjoined the star involution *"
-- in characteristic 2, the star involution is actually not an
involution, but rather the identity map, and so "simple" should just
mean "simple as a module over the anemic Hecke algebra", so synonymous
to "splittable_anemic" in Sage terminology
-- the factorization() aka simple_factors() function for modular
symbols uses the HeckeModule_free_module.decomposition() function,
which implements an algorithm that breaks up the module as much as
possible using the anemic Hecke algebra; therefore the resulting
factors are "splittable_anemic", and so "simple" (for char 2).

The attached patch fixes the problem, and adds a doctest or two.
