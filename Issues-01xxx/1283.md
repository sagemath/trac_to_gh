Currently, coercions (and conversions) are defined in many different places in the SAGE codebase. We are going through each parent and consolidating/cleaning up the codebase to conform to the new coercion API, as described in the new programming guide. 

This includes removing all Parent `__call__` methods to use a generic `__call__`.
