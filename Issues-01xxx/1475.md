Please do not randomly close tickets (even if they have been fixed) without either checking with William or the release manager in IRC. Instead mark the subject as "[probably fixed]" instead.

This is not merged.  This is not the checkbox at the top. The idea would
be that there would be a user configuration panel with an option so that

I've attached a patch which is all of the previous ones folded together.  This code doesn't actually work; it creates the option, but setting it to True doesn't actually cause the output in the notebook to be typeset by default.

Also, please don't say that this depends on #4135 as it does not.

Using Mercurial queues would allow you to make single patches as opposed to multiple little ones and would allow you to see what actually depends on what.

Jason Grout implemented the same thing in the meantime, I think.
