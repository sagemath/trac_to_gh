This works in python:

```
>>> print "abc \"def\""
abc "def"
```

but it's broken in sage:

```
sage: print "abc \"def\""
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<ipython console>", line 1
     print "abc \"def._backslash_()""
                                    ^
<type 'exceptions.SyntaxError'>: EOL while scanning single-quoted string
```

This works for me on 3.0.2-rc2. There is also the following doctest in sage/misc/preparser.py around line 40 to cover this:

```
A string with escaped quotes in it (the point here is that the
preparser doesn't get confused by the internal quotes):
    sage: "\"Yes,\" he said."
    '"Yes," he said.'
    sage: s = "\\"; s
    '\\'
```

I think this bug can safely be resolved as worksforme.
