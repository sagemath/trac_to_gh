This is *not* a bug.  The is by design.  Since f has no variables it is no longer
implicitly callable:

sage: f.variables()
()
sage: f(1)
.ValueError: the number of arguments must be less than or equal to 0

You will have to instead write:
sage: f(t) = t*sin(0)
sage: f(1)
0

or use 

sage: f=t*sin(0)
sage: f(t=0)
0

This change was introduced because people often do the following
by accident:

sage: a = (sqrt(2) + 17)(x+2)
sage: a
sqrt(2) + 17

Of course, that the above doesn't give an error even in 2.9 is a
bug!   At least in most cases it works:

sage: (SR(2) + 3)(x)
<type 'exceptions.ValueError'>: the number of arguments must be less than or equal to 0

Also, this is a bug:

sage: a = (I*17+3*5)(x+2)
AttributeError: 'I_class' object has no attribute 'number_of_arguments'


I want to emphasize that allowing

sage: a = (sqrt(2) + 17)(x+2)

and having it return sqrt(2) + 17 is *very* confusing to
a lot of people.  I witnessed this time after time after time
when teaching a high school workshop using Sage this
summer -- it was really striking how often this happened.

This was fixed as a (intended) side-effect of another patch.  The patch posted here adds doctests to cover the cases mentioned in this patch.
