Make it so that the following sort of thing works:

```
sage: sphere() + plot(sin(x), (x,0,10))
sage: plot(sin(x), (x,0,10)).graphic3d()
```

and

```
sage: plot(sin(x), (x,0,10)).show(viewer='jmol')
```

In each case the plot would be rendered using 3d primitives instead of 2d primitives, when possible -- primitives that aren't implemented in 3d would degrade or be removed.   Basically make a way of *coercing* 2d plots into the world of 3d plots. 

This would make it possible to view whole arrays, groups, whatever of 2d plots all organized in some spatial way in 3d, and also to zoom in very close, etc., on 2d plots.


Component: **graphics**

I've implemented turning most 2d primitives into 3d primitives, e.g. 

```
sage: sphere(aspect_ratio=[1,1,1]) + plot(sin(x), 0, 10)
sage: sum([plot(z*sin(x), 0, 10).plot3d(z) for z in range(10)])
```

AWESOME!!

Just playing around

```
sage: var('x y'); p1 = parametric_plot3d((x,y,0), (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2), color='red', opacity=0.5)
(x, y)
sage: p2 = plot(sin(x),(-2,2)).plot3d().translate(0,0,0.1)
sage: p1 + p2 + sphere((0,0,1),0.01) + polygon([(0,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,0)]).plot3d().translate((0,0,-0.1)) + sphere((0,0,-1),0.1)
