Just by doing a sage start + immediate quit under valgrind leads to:

I tracked this down to gen.pyx:5566:

```
        self.ONE = self(1)
```
but I have no clue how to fix this.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

this is likely fixed by the fix for #875, since the offending line in gen.pyx has been changed.
