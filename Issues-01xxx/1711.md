I'll look at this in more detail as part of an effort to make the iterators for the polybori wrapper look more uniform. 

For now, I cannot figure out why this specific iterator fails, and the others don't.

[attachment: 1711_BooleSet_iterator_workaround.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1711/1711_BooleSet_iterator_workaround.patch.gz) does not really fix the issue, but at least prevents the segfault.

I think the patch should be applied before 2.10.3, and this ticket still kept open so we remember the problem.
