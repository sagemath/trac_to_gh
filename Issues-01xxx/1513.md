The title pretty much says it all. make 3.79.1 doesn't support make -B, and I'm likely not the only person with a slightly outdated version of make, so we should see if this can be switched around at all.

The spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/flint-1.02.p0.spkg

should fix the problem. I don't think we will need "-B" since we always build the check from a tree than only had the library build in it once.

Cheers,

Michael
