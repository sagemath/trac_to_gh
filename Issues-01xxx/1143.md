```
Of course. It seems to me that **nintegral** calls Maxima and not GSL
(it is numerical_integral which calls GSL).

You might want to provide only one interface to numerical quadrature
(which might call GSL or Maxima or Pari with some options), and also
allow for arbitrary precision quadrature (it seems only Pari/GP allows this).
```
and he's right -- it's just calling maxima.  So the above patch would
actually break the docs!
