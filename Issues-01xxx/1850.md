This works fine

```
sage: parametric_plot3d((sin(x), cos(x), x), (x,0,10*pi))
```

This is missing half of the parametric plot!!

```
sage: parametric_plot3d((sin(x), cos(x), x), (x,0,10*pi), plot_points=500)
```

I suspect this may be a bug introduced by me or Bobby M. in refactoring some plotting code.

Very disturbingly, if you render using tachyon you don't see the problem:

```
sage: parametric_plot3d((sin(x), cos(x), x), (x,0,10*pi), plot_points=500, viewer='tachyon')
```

Also, rendering some more complicated things makes it so the problem vanishes.

```
sage: parametric_plot3d((sin(x), cos(x), x+sin(x^2)), (x,0,10*pi), plot_points=500)
```


So this is probably a pretty tricky bug to fix, possibly a bug in jmol.

This seems to hit a hard-coded point limit of 256 in jmol's `org/jmol/shapespecial/Draw.java`, line 69.

I guess we could either change jmol to support arbitrary numbers of points, or split up  curves in 'subcurves' of at most 256 points each.
