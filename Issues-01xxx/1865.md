Try this in the notebook:

1. Click restart worksheet in the action menu.

2. Evaluate the contents of a cell.

You'll find nothing happens.   More precisely, the first cell does get evaluated (as you can see by assigning a variable there), but the output of this evaluation is never displayed in the notebook.
