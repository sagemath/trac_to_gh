The following patch adds some improvements to list_plot3d

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jkantor/spkgs/list_plot3d.hg

The new code requires an updated scipy_sandbox

Code looks good; doctests pass in sage/plot.  I went through all the doctests by hand and they all work and look pretty.  One of the doctests was malformed (syntax error); the attached trac-1845-fix-doctest.patch fixes that.

I did not look at differences between the old and new scipy_sandbox, or check old functionality of that spkg.

To apply: apply list_plot3d.hg, then trac-1845-fix-doctest.patch; and install the new scipy_sandbox spkg.
