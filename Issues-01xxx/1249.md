Attachment [graph_plotting_partitions.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket1249/graph_plotting_partitions.patch) by cwitty created at 2007-11-28 02:28:38

Looks good to me: the example in the doctests fails before the patch and succeeds after the patch.  There is one caveat: I think the call to D.show() in the first doctest chunk was supposed to be D.plot().

But IMHO good enough to apply, anyway.
