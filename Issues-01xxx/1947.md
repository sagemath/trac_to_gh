It's surprising that this isn't already done -- it should be easy, since the morphisms don't have to do too much, and one already has the more complicated ring homomorphism code to use as a guide. I'll do this at SD7, if no one beats me to it.

Craig, since homomorphisms between vector spaces *are* implemented (as I explained to you in irc last week), could you change the title of this trac ticket and explain what you are actually proposing be implemented?  Thanks.

```
sage: V = QQ^3; W = QQ^2
sage: H = V.Hom(W)
sage: H([1..6])

Free module morphism defined by the matrix
[1 2]
[3 4]
[5 6]
Domain: Vector space of dimension 3 over Rational Field
Codomain: Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
```
