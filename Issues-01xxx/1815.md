Yeah. In addition:

   * the ticket is as non-descript as they come 
   * this ticket is over three months old, yet you open new half-finished projects
   * please open tickets when you have something done or ready for review, this is close to invalid since it doesn't look like you will finish this and there is no point in putting things like this in trac
