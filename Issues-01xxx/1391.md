Behold this behavior:

```
sage: R.<a,b,c,d> = QQ[]
sage: f =  (-1) * (a - d) * (-a + b) * (b - d) * (a - c) * (b - c) * (c - d)
sage: f.factor()
(-1) * (a - d) * (-a + b) * (b - d) * (a - c) * (b - c) * (c - d)
sage: F = f.factor()
sage: F[0][0]
-1
sage: F.unit_part ()
1
```

However it should be that F.unit_part() is -1 and F[0][0] is a-d.
