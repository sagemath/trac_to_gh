We have

```
sage: n = matrix(QQ, 3, range(9))
sage: n._mathematica_init_()
'{{0},{1},{2},{3},{4},{5},{6},{7},{8}}'
```

but we should have

```
sage: n = matrix(QQ, 3, range(9))
sage: n._mathematica_init_()
'{{0,1,2},{3,4,5},{6,7,8}}'
```

sage: var('x, y, z, b')

sage: f = sin(x^2) + y^z

sage: f._mathematica_init_()

```

I made a typo.  Simply apply 

* 1382_5.patch
* 1382_5-part2of2.patch. 

That's it.  2 patches.   They should not be flattened.
