```
We have

```
sage: n = matrix(QQ, 3, range(9))
sage: n._mathematica_init_()
'{{0},{1},{2},{3},{4},{5},{6},{7},{8}}'
```

but we should have

```
sage: n = matrix(QQ, 3, range(9))
sage: n._mathematica_init_()
'{{0,1,2},{3,4,5},{6,7,8}}'
```

This will not work, since it does not appear to be recursive.  For example:

```
sage: var('x, y, z, b')
(x, y, z, b)
sage: f = sin(x^2) + y^z
sage: f

sage: f._mathematica_init_()

sage: M = matrix(1, 2, [f, f^2]); M
[    y^z + sin(x^2) (y^z + sin(x^2))^2]
```

Also, please post a unified patch making it easy to see just the total changes.

Is `_mathematica_init_` guaranteed not to require Mathematica?  If not, some more doctests need to be declared optional.  Otherwise, looks good.

I made a typo.  Simply apply 

* 1382_5.patch
* 1382_5-part2of2.patch. 

That's it.  2 patches.   They should not be flattened.
