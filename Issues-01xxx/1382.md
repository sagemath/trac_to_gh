We have

```
sage: n = matrix(QQ, 3, range(9))
sage: n._mathematica_init_()
'{{0},{1},{2},{3},{4},{5},{6},{7},{8}}'
```

but we should have

```
sage: n = matrix(QQ, 3, range(9))
sage: n._mathematica_init_()
'{{0,1,2},{3,4,5},{6,7,8}}'
```

This will not work, since it does not appear to be recursive.  For example:

```
sage: var('x, y, z, b')
(x, y, z, b)
sage: f = sin(x^2) + y^z
sage: f
y^z + sin(x^2)
sage: f._mathematica_init_()
'(Sin[(x) ^ (2)]) + ((y) ^ (z))'
sage: M = matrix(1, 2, [f, f^2]); M
[    y^z + sin(x^2) (y^z + sin(x^2))^2]
```

Also, please post a unified patch making it easy to see just the total changes.

I made a typo.  Simply apply

That's it.  2 patches.   They should not be flattened.
