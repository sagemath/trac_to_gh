```
The code 


```
G = SL(2,ZZ)                 
M = matrix([[1,0],[0,1]])    
M in G            
```


runs possibly forever inside GAP. same for

```
M = matrix(ZZ,[[1,0],[0,1]])
```

It's not intentional, and should be fixed. Here's a quick solution:

InstallMethod(\in,[IsMatrix,IsSpecialLinearGroup],
 function(g,G)
   return Length(g)=Length(One(G)) and
             ForAll(g,row->Length(row)=Length(One(g)) and
             IsOne(DeterminantMat(g));
 end);

needless to say, there must be lots of other missing methods; e.g. for
general, symplectic etc. linear groups.
