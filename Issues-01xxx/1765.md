sage: var("s,i,b,m,g");
sage: sys = [ m*(1-s) - b*s*i, b*s*i-g*i ];
sage: equilibria = solve(sys,s,i);
[[s == 1, i == 0], [s == g/b, i == (b - g)*m/(b*g)]]

You mean like this:

sage: solve(sys, [s, i])              # this is not implemented
[[s == 1, i == 0], [s == g/b, i == (b - g)*m/(b*g)]]

That seems like a really good idea.
Note that right now at least you can do the following
(note the *) and it will work:

sage: solve(sys, *[s, i])
[[s == 1, i == 0], [s == g/b, i == (b - g)*m/(b*g)]]

```

This would be very easy to implement.

<a id='comment:3'></a>The patch doesn't actually do what the description asks for; more precisely, instead of the desired behavior

```
sage: solve(sys, [s, i])              # this is not implemented
[[s == 1, i == 0], [s == g/b, i == (b - g)*m/(b*g)]]

this still throws a ValueError.
