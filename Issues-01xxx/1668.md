Variable names like `_[A-Z]` cause trouble on Cygwin and Solaris. The polybori wrapper uses a couple of those. The renamed variables could be in some other for, but `_PP` also won't work. I have a patch, but since there are a bunch of other patches that touch the code and would need to be fixed wait for those to be merged before redoing this. burcin has volunteered to do this.
