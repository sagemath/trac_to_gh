This example explains the functionality for the new function 'plot':

```
sage: import urllib2
sage: S = AlphabeticStrings()
sage: ISARC = 'http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~kohel/tch/ISARC/'
sage: en = S.encoding(urllib2.urlopen(ISARC + 'blackcat.txt').read())
sage: F_en = en.frequency_distribution()
sage: F_en.plot()
sage: fr = S.encoding(urllib2.urlopen(ISARC + 'chapitre.1.txt').read())
sage: F_fr = fr.frequency_distribution()
sage: F_fr.plot()
```
Unfortunately, I did not include such an example in the function 
since it hard-codes an external web address, and would otherwise 
require a reasonably sized sample text for a proper demonstration.

<a id='comment:3'></a>This patch has been submitted (twice!) in the bundle accompanying #2153.

Whether it should be applied... I say yes, but I'm worried that it will fail on infinite domains.
