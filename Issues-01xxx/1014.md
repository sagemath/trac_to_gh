Both `log(x,10)` and `len(str(x))` are bad ways to calculate the number of digits of an integer, but there doesn't appear to be a better way to do it right now in sage.

Probably, it would be nice if there were a number_of_digits() (or maybe there is a better name) function in `sage.rings.integer.Integer` that wraps the relevant gmp function to return the number of digits of the integer.

I spent a few hours trying to come up with a smart way of doing this, and then I decided to see exactly how bad it is to do log(x,10).  The upshot is that I couldn't come up with an integer large enough that taking the log isn't practically instantaneous.  Hence the patch.

Here's an example:

```
sage: time n=100000000000000000**10000000+1
CPU times: user 53.12 s, sys: 0.52 s, total: 53.65 s
Wall time: 53.76
sage: time n.ndigits()
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00
170000001
```

Note that it takes significantly longer to actually compute n than to get the number of digits.

If this is supposed to give the exact number of digits... it doesn't.

The algorithm correctly says that the first number has 1001 digits; but the next two numbers actually have 1000 digits and the algorithm says 1001.

```
sage: RR(10^1000).abs().log(10).floor() + 1
1001
sage: RR(10^1000 - 1).abs().log(10).floor() + 1
1001
sage: RR(10^1000 - 10^900).abs().log(10).floor() + 1
1001
```

I've put up a new patch, hopefully correct this time.

Here's the (again, simple) idea:  Since my one-liner gave the same result as GMP's sizeinbase function, I ditched my earlier try and just called sizeinbase, which gives me a number guess, which is either the correct number of digits, or 1+ that.

So ndigits() now has roughly the same running time as creating n itself (which, I would guess, is linear in the size of n).  Here are some examples:

```

This is very similar to the `Integer.exact_log` function. Can we perhaps merge the functionality here?

Also, I know nobody has time for this, but an even better algorithm would be:
* as alex suggests, estimate the exponent using mpz_sizeinbase
* instead of computing the whole power, just estimate the top couple of digits using MPFR (much much much faster than computing the whole power)
* keep increasing precision until we can distinguish the input from the power.

Maybe this would be easiest to implement using interval arithmetic.

The point is, for uniform random input, the top couple of digits will almost always give you the right answer straightaway. It's very rare that you need to compute everything. I wish I had more time to think about this, it sounds like a fun problem.
