The root cause of this is that Period lattices actually derive from the abstract free module type, but they don't implement all the functionality that type requires.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

Just to confirm that none of this has changed yet despite a lot of (mainly precision-related) work on period lattices leading up to 3.1.2.

I'm not sure what benefits, if any, the class PeriodLattice_ell gains from being derived from FreeModule_generic_pid (via class PeriodLattice), but it means that len(dir(L)) is 210 so there's a lot of work to do implementing possibly trivial and possibly irrelevant things.

The issue is that a FreeModule_generic_pid seems to think that it's a submodule of some concrete module like `ZZ^n`, rather than being an abstract module;  functions like basis_matrix() make no sense in general.

If anyone can point out a method of FreeModule_generic_pid which PeriodLattice_ell should implement but does not, I would be happy to implement it.
