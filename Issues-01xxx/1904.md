The root cause of this is that Period lattices actually derive from the abstract free module type, but they don't implement all the functionality that type requires.

Just to confirm that none of this has changed yet despite a lot of (mainly precision-related) work on period lattices leading up to 3.1.2.

I'm not sure what benefits, if any, the class PeriodLattice_ell gains from being derived from FreeModule_generic_pid (via class PeriodLattice), but it means that len(dir(L)) is 210 so there's a lot of work to do implementing possibly trivial and possibly irrelevant things.

The issue is that a FreeModule_generic_pid seems to think that it's a submodule of some concrete module like `ZZ^n`, rather than being an abstract module;  functions like basis_matrix() make no sense in general.

If anyone can point out a method of FreeModule_generic_pid which PeriodLattice_ell should implement but does not, I would be happy to implement it.
