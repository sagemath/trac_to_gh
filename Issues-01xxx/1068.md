:-(, but I have to concede to your logic. The line to change is 148  
of coerce.pxi. Setting this value to 0 will turn them completely off.  
Other than numpy, (and the builtin libraries), do we use any other  
extension types? If there is a finite list of things for which it  
won't work, it would be possible to disable it just for those.
