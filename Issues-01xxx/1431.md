**Attachment:** [formatter.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1431/formatter.patch)

Still needs doctest examples.

Example:

```

def multiple_of_pi(n,pos):
    m = n*1.0/float(pi)
    c=[i for i in convergents(m) if i.denominator()<12]
    q=c[-1]
    if q.denominator()==1:
        if q.numerator()==1:
            return r'$\pi$'
        elif q.numerator()==-1:
            return r'$-\pi$'            
        else:
            return r'$%s\pi$'%q
    else:
        if q.numerator()==1:
            return r'$\frac{\pi}{%s}$'%q.denominator()
        elif q.numerator()==-1:
            return r'$\frac{-\pi}{%s}$'%q.denominator()
        else:
            return r'$\frac{%s\pi}{%s}$'%(q.numerator(),q.denominator())

from matplotlib.ticker import MultipleLocator, FuncFormatter
plot(sin(x), (x, -4, 4), tick_locator=MultipleLocator(float(pi/3)), tick_formatter=FuncFormatter(multiple_of_pi))

```

Two comments:

* tick_formatter should accept rational multiples of *any* symbolic constant.  I think the code ought to be generalized before going into Sage.  For example, I should have ticks that are rational multiples of e as well.

* I like the idea of having tick_locator be a number.  I think it should be expanded to being a list (if symbolic expressions, then latexing them can give the formatters), or a function.

These make lots of sense.  It should be easy to check if the string is in symbolic.constants or something (or even accept those as input), and then of course one would have to check if there was a symbolic expression in the list, and (possibly override) use tick_formatter appropriately.  After all, multiple_of_pi could be made generic to multiple_of_symbolic_constant, and then we could make a dummy function to input into FuncFormatter or something.

Okay, I've finally had time to return to this, and I'm almost done dealing with this.  It is actually really cool!

Formatting by multiples of constants (or numbers) will be implemented, as well as locating by arbitrary lists.  Note that 

```
    ``LogLocator``

could solve our log problems, though I think that would not belong on this ticket (and I think there is one for this).

> Regarding using "straight matplotlib", that would be a bit annoying, since all my plot commands are in Sage, so I have to get at the secret underlying matplotlib fig/canvas, right?  


Well, it's not so secret, though, as it is exposed in a public function:

p=plot(x^2,(x,-3,4))
figure=p.matplotlib()
from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg
figure.set_canvas(FigureCanvasAgg(figure))
figure.savefig('test.png')

(the last three lines are a bit esoteric, but they are fairly straightforward matplotlib...)

+1 to "ticks"

I'm not sure what to do about the latex issue.  I suppose the real problem here is that matplotlib does not use compatible fonts for $1$ and just straight 1.  That's a bummer.  Still, in the common case (i.e., people didn't specify formatters), I think we should make it all latex or all not latex.  plot(sin(x), (x,0,pi), tick_formatter=pi) is likely to be a very common case, and we shouldn't have "ugly" output for it.  It looks like it might be as easy as changing the line:

```
 1818            if y_formatter is None:  
1819                y_formatter = OldScalarFormatter()
```
to

```
if y_formatter is None:
    y_formatter = copy(x_formatter)  # maybe copy isn't needed
```
We could then also delete the if statement above dealing with setting both formatters to "latex" if tick_formatter="latex".

The one problem with this is that plot(..., ticks=pi) would change both the x and the y axis.  Maybe we could special-case that situation.

If you note, the documentation is already quite explicit that you should not do that example in 'real life' :-)  though I'll make it even more explicit.  Luckily that example is also in an underscore function.

I think a better solution is that if y_formatter is None and x_formatter was in SR, then we should do y_formatter='latex'.  I propose to do this via 

```
        from sage.symbolic.ring import SR
        if not isinstance(tick_formatter, (list, tuple)):
            if tick_formatter == "latex" or tick_formatter in SR:
                tick_formatter = (tick_formatter, "latex")
            else:
                tick_formatter = (tick_formatter, None)        
```
I also will check for the much rarer case of plotting arcsin, so to speak.  Patch coming up.
