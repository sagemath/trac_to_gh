I was told that SAGE did use less memory than Maple or Mathematica. I did check on sage.math.washington.edu:

```
zimmerma@sage:~$ du -s /usr/local/maple10
388908  /usr/local/maple10

zimmerma@sage:~$ du -s /usr/local/mathematica-5.2
641016  /usr/local/mathematica-5.2

sage:/tmp/zimmerma/sage-2.8.14> make install DESTDIR=/tmp/zimmerma/sage-2.8.14-\
install
sage:/tmp/zimmerma/sage-2.8.14> du -s /tmp/zimmerma/sage-2.8.14-install
1237280 /tmp/zimmerma/sage-2.8.14-install
```
I can understand that the SAGE developers need all the source and binaries installed, but I wish a minimal
version for the simple user that would use at most the same amount of memory than Maple or Mathematica,
not 2 times or 3 times more!

Component: **distribution**

Well, your numbers are slighly inflated because "make install" is still experimental and copies fata not needed:

```
mabshoff@sage:/tmp/Work-mabshoff/size$ du -sch sage-2.8.13-use_this_on_sage_dot_math-x86_64-Linux
802M    sage-2.8.13-use_this_on_sage_dot_math-x86_64-Linux
```
The current 2.8.13 binary expands to 802 MB which is still too large, but somewhat smaller than the 1.2GB you had.

But it would be a good thing to slim down the installed Sage if it is possible.

Cheers,

Michael

Here are the brand new figures for sage-2.9 on a 64-bit computer (Opteron under Fedora7):

```
achille% du -s /usr/local/sage-2.9

If the figures are comparable on sage.math (which I assume) this is 2.4 times larger than Mathematica and 3.9 times
larger than Maple.

Some new datapoints:
* 3.1.3.alpha1 is **1.7GB** after compilation (64-bit Linux),
* it is safe to delete all spkgs in `$SAGE_ROOT/spkgs/standard`,
* it is safe to strip executables,
* it is safe to strip shared libraries with `-g -R .comment -R .note`,
* one may delete all of `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/build` except for the `sage` subdirectory.

The result is **1.1GB** which is still massive. I'm building with `-Os` now to see how much of a difference that makes.

I think this should also be safe in `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/`

```
for f in `find -name "*.pyx"`; do echo $f | sed "s/\.pyx/\.c/" | xargs rm; done
```

```
for f in `find -name "*.pyx"`; do echo $f | sed "s/\.pyx/\.cpp/" | xargs rm; done
```

to delete all autogenerated `.c` and `.cpp` files.

This seems to free ~ 80MB
