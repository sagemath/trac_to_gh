`mq.MPolynomialSystem` is more general than its position in the tree suggests. I should be moved to `sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_sequence` and used as a special case of `Sequence` if the members are all multivariate polynomials.

**Depends on #10600**

But the GB is cached and used for "interesting" operations.

This was the compromise reached to (a) keep the notion that ideals are different objects than their generators and to (b) still allow to query some information about the basis. We should have separated stuff back then perhaps. In any case, it was this method's name which sparked the debate we're having between William and myself.

I'd say: it attempts to present a view on ideals which abstracts away chosen bases but with varying success.

But e.g. `intersection()` and `reduce()` actually use the GB and not the provided basis, they are methods on the ideal and not on the generating set. Some other methods are less clear such as `basis_is_groebner()` and `interreduced_basis()`. These could perhaps be moved to `PolynomialSequence`.

> I am aware that the ideals implicitly contain the term order, though I found that a somewhat mixed blessing in #10708.


I wouldn't say this is because of the containment of term orderings but because of lack of care dealing with them?

Sorry, my English failed me: William and I had a debate about whether ideal class == list of polynomials a few years back (October 2006). It was essentially about the same issue which we are discussion here now (I realised while double checking that it wasn't about `basis_is_groebner()` but about the return type of `groebner_basis()`) The decision was: ideals are objects in their own right in Sage and not lists of polynomials.

Should we move this discussion to [sage-devel]?

Now that I see some of the bigger picture I'm happy with distinguishing ideals and polynomial sequences in the way you are implementing. I don't quite get how the multiple parts of the polynomial sequence are supposed to fit into this. The documentation should either stress that this is optional (and that, by default, there is only a unique part) or separate this functionality into a derived class. 

Some other suggestions, though that could easily be postponed to followup tickets:
* Document the relationship between ideals and polynomial sequences in the ideals module.
* An alias `MPolynomialIdeal.basis` = `MPolynomialIdeal.gens`
* Move `MPolynomialIdeal.basis_is_groebner` to `PolynomialSequence.is_groebner`
* Move `MPolynomialIdeal.interreduced_basis` to `PolynomialSequence.interreduce` and make it return a `PolynomialSequence` instead of a list.
* there shouldn't be a `PolynomialSequence.groebner_basis`
* Perhaps move `MPolynomialIdeal.weil_restriction` since you say that it depends on the presentation.

Good idea.

> Some other suggestions, though that could easily be postponed to followup tickets:

Done.

>   * An alias `MPolynomialIdeal.basis` = `MPolynomialIdeal.gens`
>   * Move `MPolynomialIdeal.basis_is_groebner` to `PolynomialSequence.is_groebner`
>   * Move `MPolynomialIdeal.interreduced_basis` to `PolynomialSequence.interreduce` and make it return a `PolynomialSequence` instead of a list.
>   * there shouldn't be a `PolynomialSequence.groebner_basis`


This is now #10856.

>   * Perhaps move `MPolynomialIdeal.weil_restriction` since you say that it depends on the presentation.


Thinking about it: it's about the variety and thus can stay with the ideals.
