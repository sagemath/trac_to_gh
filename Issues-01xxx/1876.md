This seems to have gotten fixed. From http://www.sagemath.org/doc/html/ref/node44.html as of 2.10.3:

```
Note that the \ character is an escape character in Python, and also a character used by graph6 strings:
```
and then

```
In Python, the escaped character \ is represented by \\:
```

Cheers,

Michael
