The reference manual page at

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/html/ref/node44.html

**In Python, the escaped character is represented by**

Probably there should be a 'slash' and a 'slashslash' there somewhere.

This seems to have gotten fixed. From http://www.sagemath.org/doc/html/ref/node44.html as of 2.10.3:

```
and then

```
In Python, the escaped character \ is represented by \\:
