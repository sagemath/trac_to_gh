spkg for the `zn_poly` library:

http://math.harvard.edu/~dmharvey/zn_poly/releases/zn_poly-0.4.1.spkg

I've tested it on some platforms, but it needs to be tested on more.

So I can you start a thread on sage-devel that requests a vote for inclusion? You should do that by describing what the spkg does, how large it is and what the benefits are. I am sure it will be included, but that is the process we decided upon and I am sure you saw the SQLAlchemy vote a couple days ago.\n\nI will test this spkg and review its layout for conformance later today.\n\nCheers,\n\nMichael",
