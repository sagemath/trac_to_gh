Kiran had some build failure with PolyBori because SCons seems to pick the newest gcc in $PATH instead of the first one. In his particular case the newest gcc was a 32 bit target on a 64 bit platform and things didn't go to well from there. See the discussion toward the end of 

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/cdf2ae8087d5637e#

This affects PolyBori as well as sagelib as far as I can tell.

On my system, unless PATH is forced to be imported from the external environment, SCons somehow decides to try using the path:

```
/usr/local/bin:/opt/bin:/bin:/usr/bin
```
despite the fact that /opt/bin doesn't exist. (This has caused mischief in the past because I had an old version of gcc in /usr/local/bin and a current one in /usr/bin; in my PATH, /usr/bin comes first.) How is this generated?
