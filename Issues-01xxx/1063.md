```
After the patch, this works:

```
cwitty@magnetar:~/sage$ ./sage -sh
Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set:
cwitty@magnetar:~/sage$ echo $SAGE_LOCAL
/home/cwitty/sage/local
cwitty@magnetar:~/sage$ exit
exit
Exited Sage subshell.
```

I also patch sage-spkg, to change the error message it prints on failed package installs:

```
If you want to try to fix the problem, yourself *don't* just cd to
/home/cwitty/sage/spkg/build/genus2reduction-0.3 and type 'make'.
Instead type "/home/cwitty/sage/sage -sh"
in order to set all environment variables correctly, then cd to
/home/cwitty/sage/spkg/build/genus2reduction-0.3
(When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the
subshell.)
```
