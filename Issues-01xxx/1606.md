We should just add
    P.show(aspect_ratio="automatic")
etc., exactly as in Mathematica.  The goal with 2d graphics in Sage
is that they at least support all options that Mathematica has. 

Anyway, here is a function show11 that works exactly like show(...), but
it will always show with a 1:1 aspect ratio:

```
def show11(g, figsize=[5,4], **kwds):
    for k in ['xmin', 'xmax', 'ymin', 'ymax']:
        if kwds.has_key(k): g.__getattribute__(k)(kwds[k])
    scale = (g.xmax() - g.xmin())/(g.ymax() - g.ymin())
    g.show(figsize=[figsize[0], figsize[0]/scale], **kwds)
```

```
show11(plot(sin, 0, 5))
```

```
show11(circle((0,0), 2), xmin=-3, xmax=4)
```

By the way, I also removed explicit mention of mathematica and matlab in the file, in order to not get in trademark trouble with them. 

The main point about this patch is that the notion of aspect_ratio implemented in it is different than in mathematica.  It is very useful though in practice, and consistent with what we've implemented for 3d graphics.
