Currently there are four different functions to delete things from a graph: delete_edge, delete_edges, delete_vertex, and delete_vertices.  How about we consolidate these into one function, "delete", that looks like this:

delete(vertices=list_of_vertices, edges=list_of_edges) deletes the vertices specified, then the edges specified.

So:

* delete_vertex(v) == delete(vertices=[v])

* delete_vertices(list) == delete(vertices=list)

* delete_edge(e) == delete(edges=[e])

* delete_edges(list) == delete(edges=list)

* deleting vertices and edges is accomplished by passing both parameters in.

This idea may be completely irrational, but I thought I'd throw it out in an effort to consolidate functions and make the interface simpler to remember.  What do you think?

(I'm ignoring delete_multiedge here, though we could probably include that in as an option to delete).

I support removing all other delete methods -- tab completion on a graph produces a formidable list, and having a bunch of redundant functions adds to the clutter.  That said, there are some strange things about this patch that I could do without:

```
G.delete(1)       #deletes a node
G.delete(1,2)     #deletes an edge
G.delete(1,2,3)   #deletes three nodes
G.delete(1,2,3,4) #deletes four nodes
```

one of these is not like the other... maybe you could balance it out, so if they pass in an even number of arguments, it removes the edges between successive pairs; odd number of arguments deletes nodes?

I've run out of time today to work on this, but rlm and I agree that we should consolidate to two functions: delete_vertices and delete_edges, with a single non-list argument deleting a single vertex or edge.

That patch should be much simpler and should make much more sense in the long run.
