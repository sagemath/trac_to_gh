Notice that the parent of a changes below when you do a*a!!

```
sage: K.<z> = CyclotomicField(7)
sage: P = K.factor_integer(17)[0][0]
sage: ff = K.residue_field(P)
sage: a = ff(z)
sage: parent(a)
Residue field of Fractional ideal (17)
sage: parent(a*a)
Finite Field in z of size 17^6
```

This doesn't happen if 17 is replaced by something much smaller.
The problem is an optimization in finite field pari element, which
has two separate parent attributes. BAD.  


Component: **number theory**
