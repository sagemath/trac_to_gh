`BooleanPolynomialRing` supports coercion from rings where the number of variables is greater than self. This code should be in `__call__` and coercion should first check for the number of variables of the parent ring.

Attached patch fixes this problem, and adds similar coercion and `__call__` semantics to `BooleanMonomialMonoid`. It also fixes minor problems where using iterators of polynomials over a ring other than the current one messes `PolyBoRi` up.

Looks good to me. This is isolated to polybori, so I merged it.
