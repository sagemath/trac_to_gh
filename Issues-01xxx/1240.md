[This was reported to me by Emmanuel Thome.]

When installing SAGE 2.8.13 on a multi-user site (make dist), the Unix rights of some files are wrong:

```
helene% find . ! -perm +004 | xargs ls -lLd
-rwx--x--x 1 zimmerma spaces    414 2007-11-22 08:56 ./local/bin/sage-rebase_sage.sh
-rwx--x--x 1 zimmerma spaces    702 2007-11-22 10:13 ./local/bin/sage-server-web
-rw------- 1 zimmerma spaces   5292 2007-11-22 09:09 ./local/include/cremona/cperiods.h
...
-rw-r----- 1 zimmerma spaces   1360 2006-10-26 20:26 ./local/share/moin/underlay/pages/SystemPagesSetup/attachments/all_languages.zip
...
```

Shouldn't all files be at least readable (r) by everybody?

I reopen this ticket, since this issue is back with Sage 4.3.3:

```
tarte% sage
**************************************************************************
You must compile Sage first using 'make' in the Sage root directory.
(If you have already compiled Sage, you must set the SAGE_ROOT variable in 
the file '/usr/local/sage-core2/sage').
**************************************************************************
```
This is due to wrong permissions (Sage was installed by Emmanuel Thome with `make dist`):

```

I declare this as a blocker since this issue should be fixed *once for all*
(and automatically checked before doing a release).
