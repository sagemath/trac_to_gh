The problem has come up a couple times on sage-devel: The OSX binary Sage tar-ball contains a link case sensitive link lib->LIB that is caused by the singular.spkg. I believe it is to accomodate some issue with Singular's high level libraries. We should just skip creating that link on OSX and all should be fine.

Cheers,

Michael

The following spkg fixes the issue by avoiding creating a `lib->LIB` link:

* http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/singular-3-0-4-1-20071209.p0.spkg

I tested the resulting bdist and it no longer shows the issue on an OSX 10.4 box with default file system options.

Cheers,

Michael
