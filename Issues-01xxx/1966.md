Probably around the upgrade to 1.0.4 the inline_fortran command broke on osx.

The following spkg fixes it

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jkantor/spkgs/numpy-20080104-1.0.4.p2.spkg

also I changed the inline_fortran.py file so the inline_fortran doctests is no longer optional (it was optional when fortran wasn't required, but now it is, so there is no reason for it to be optional).
