Change the watkins license in SAGE_ROOT/COPYING to the following, since Mark Watkins told me to do this.

```
The SYMPOW COPYING file says:


Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:
 * Redistribution of source code must retain the above copyright notice,
 this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.
 * Redistribution in binary form must reproduce the above copyright
 notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the
 documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.
 * If redistribution is done as a part of a compilation that has a more
 restrictive license (such as the GPL), then the fact that SYMPOW has
 a less restrictive license must be made clear to the recipient.
 For example, a line like (include bracketed text if SYMPOW is modified):
 "This compilation includes [a modification of] SYMPOW whose [original]
  code has a less-restrictive license than the entire compilation."
 should appear in a suitable place in the COPYING and/or LICENSE file.

[followed by the BSD disclaimer]
```

The last clause sounds awfully much like the BSD advertising clause.  Are we sure this is GPL-compatible?  IANAL, but it's a natural question to ask.
