I made this ticket in the first place, so I'm going to make it meaningful by defining "number of users" to be "the number of unique *returning* visitors to sagemath.org per month".   It's a well-defined quantity, and it's not just some sort of pure vanity metric, because to count, a user has to visit the site more than once (so temporary spikes due to news don't count).  The data from google analytics shows that sage has stayed above 10,000 users -- by that metric -- every month for the last year.   However, just barely! There were only 11,530 unique returning visitors in July, 2013. 

For the record, the number of unique returning visitors per month for sagenb.org is between 3500 and 8000 over this same period.  

For https://cloud.sagemath.com, it's between 0 and 2856. 

(I hope having a description doesn't mess up the dev scripts!)
