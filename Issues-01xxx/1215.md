No. Maxima gives

(%i2) integrate (sqrt(1+4*x^2), x, 0, 2);
                             asinh(4) + 4 sqrt(17)
(%o2)                        ---------------------
                                       4

so possibly SAGE is not parsing that properly? That's the only thing I can think
of. The following just confirms your computation:

sage: sqrt(1 + (2*x)^2).nintegrate(x, 0, 2)
(4.6467837624329427, 1.5663635326179329e-09, 21, 0)
sage: integral(sqrt(1 + (2*x)^2), x, 0, 2)
(4 + 4*sqrt(17))/4
sage: RR(integral(sqrt(1 + (2*x)^2), x, 0, 2))
5.12310562561766
```
