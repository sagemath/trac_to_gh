Neither the tex/pdf nor the html doc appear to be in the .dmg's I
downloaded.  'sage-bdist' certainly *looks* like it should copy it,
but there is no 'html' in $SAGE_ROOT.

Here's what I see:

$ ls
COPYING.txt             examples
matplotlibrc            test.log
README.txt              install.log
sage                    tmp
data                    ipython                 sage-2.9.1.txt
devel                   local                   sage-README-osx.txt
example.sage            makefile                spkg

$ find . -name html
./local/LIB/r/doc/html
./local/LIB/r/src/gnuwin32/fixed/html
./local/share/maxima/5.13.0/doc/html
./local/share/maxima/5.13.0/xmaxima/html
