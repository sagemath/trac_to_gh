Some mathematical functions automatically evaluate to floating-point, even for a symbolic input
(integer or variable):

```
sage: Ei(10)
2492.22897624
sage: bessel_J(0,10)
-0.245935764451348
sage: bessel_J(0,x)

    493             K,a = _setup(prec)
--> 494         b = K(nu.besselj(z))
    495         pari.set_real_precision(a)
    496         return b

```

In my opinion, foo(10) should evaluate to foo(10), and similarly foo(x).

no, the status is still the same (here with 3.4 since I cannot compile 4.1 from source on my laptop, but I guess the behaviour
in 4.1 is still the same):

```
sage: sin(10)
sin(10)

```
To be coherent, Ei(10) should return Ei(10) as sin(10) returns sin(10), and Ei(x) should return Ei(x) as sin(x) does return sin(x).

Hi Paul,

I could work on this if you need/want things for your talk.  It really is just a matter of going through the functions one by one and switching them over / adding more features.

Hi Mike,

my talk is over, see http://www.loria.fr/~zimmerma/talks/sage-20100204.pdf (in french).
However it would be useful to fix that issue. If you can describe what is needed to

We now have

```
sage: Ei(10)

```
but the rest aren't there yet...

But the problem is that this ticket is WAY too broad, at least in the current framework of how we deal with tickets.  We now have an entire [metapage on the wiki](../wiki/symbolics/functions) devoted to this topic!   Bessel J is #4102, log gamma is #10075, etc.  

So I recommend that this ticket be closed as far too broad (in retrospect - somehow it seemed easier two years ago!) and adequately replaced by a slew of tickets already opened.
