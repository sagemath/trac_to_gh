Dear Mike and William,

I am writing this email to let you know about the changes in the new
Gfan version 0.3.
Unfortunately the improvements to Gfan introduce some compatibility
problems, but hopefully we will have less of these problems in the future.
You may simply ignore this mail if you are not interested in
compatibility issues now.

Some of the changes are good:
---------------------------------------
The user now has the option to be very specific about what polynomial
ring the computations should take place in. The first line of the input
can now be a polynomial ring. For example
Q[x,y,t1,t2]
or
Z/7Z[a]
This change breaks compatibility in the following two ways:
1) the output now typically contains the polynomial ring in its first
line!!!!!
2) the --modp option has been removed.

Changes that affect how commands are logically combined:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The major change is that when Gfan outputs polyhedral data it is done in
a Polymake compatible way. Thus the output is a Polymake file typically
describing a polyhedral fan. Notice that the there is no official
Polyhedral fan format in Polymake at the moment. The only other software
that uses this format is TrIm by Josephine Yu.
Working with polyhedral fans turns out to be much nicer when there is an
appropriate format.

Here are two examples:
1) To compute a  Groebner cone from a marked reduced Groebner basis in
the old Gfan one would use gfan_groebnercone | gfan_facets , where
gfan_groebner cone computes inequalities and gfan_facets removes
redundant ones. In the new version the output of gfan_groebnercone is
either a polyhedral cone or its face complex as a the polyhedral fan. In
the first case the facets can be read off directly from the output.
2) To compute a weight vector for a reduced Groebner basis in the old
Gfan one would use gfan_weightvector . Now this is simply done by
gfan_groebnercone .

I don't know to what extend the above changes will affect your interfaces.
I guess I could have kept Gfan backward compatible but that would have
meant that more ugly code would have to be maintained.
I am pretty satisfied with the input/output format now.
If you wish to adjust your interfaces to Gfan and need help please let
me know.

Best regards,
```

A preliminary spkg for gfan-0.3 can be found at:

http://www.d.umn.edu/~mhampton/gfan-0.3.p1.spkg

Its not ready for inclusion yet though.  I did not provide the debian package information, since I have no idea how to do that yet.  This compiles OK on OS X, 10.4.11, but should be tested on other platforms. 

I have not rewritten the interface to deal with Anders' changes in output, that is my next goal.

This is 32-bit x86 Debian testing.

**SPKG:**
* Michael volunteered to take a deeper look
* Carl reported the redundant `.DS_Store` files

**Patch**
* I haven't read the patch yet but I'm planing to so during Easter break.
* I'm happy if somebody beats me to a review but I'll definitely have something in a couple of days.
* Sorry for the delay.

> The attached patch addresses most of the comments.  Using Singular would be a big project, I will bring it up with Anders Jensen (author of gfan). 

Hi, sorry for not being precise about this. `MPolynomialIdeal.groebner_fan` has this signature:

```
def groebner_fan(self, is_groebner_basis=False, symmetry=None, verbose=False)
```

My proposal was to replace `is_groebner_basis` either by calling `I.basis_is_groebner` or by simply computing the Gröbner basis is Sage before passing the generators to GFan. Also `verbose` should be replace with a `get_verbose` call. 

In any case, this is directly related to this ticket (sorry for going OT) and I'll review the new patch soon-ish if noone beats me to it.

Attachment: **[coverage_after.txt](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1010/coverage_after.txt)**

Review of the `post_review` patch:
* The docstrings don't obey Sage's style conventions (indentation
  etc.), I've attached a patch for that (`gfan_docstyle.patch`).
* man newly introduced methods/functions still don't have any
  documentation and no doctests. Sage now has a
  nothing-new-without-doctests policy, so this needs to be addressed
  before this can go in.
* I've also attached `coverage_before.txt` and `coverage_after.txt`
  with coverage information before and after the patch was applied.
* I'm not sure if this is related to the rewrite:

```
sage: P = PolynomialRing(GF(127),10,'x')
sage: I = sage.rings.ideal.FieldIdeal(P)
sage: gf = I.groebner_fan()
sage: gb = gf.reduced_groebner_bases()
[[x9^127 - x9, x8^127 - x8, x7^127 - x7, x6^127 - x6, x5^127 - x5, x4^127 - x4, x3^127 - x3, x2^127 - x2, x1^127 - x1, x0^127 - x0]]

sage: P = PolynomialRing(GF(127),11,'x')
sage: I = sage.rings.ideal.FieldIdeal(P)
sage: gf = I.groebner_fan()
sage: gf.reduced_groebner_bases()
<type 'exceptions.RuntimeError'>          Traceback (most recent call last)
...
<type 'exceptions.RuntimeError'>: gfan: parser.cpp:405: PolynomialSet CharacterBasedParser::parsePolynomialSet(const PolynomialRing&): Assertion `isRightBracket(c)' failed.
```
* Also, some methods do have examples but no explanation what they do. IMHO this should be addressed too.

345	 	    def fvector(self): 
 	697	    def polyhedralfan(self): 
```
In case this is it I will merge the updated gfan.spkg and the associated patches in 2.11.alpha2. :)

Cheers,

Michael

ok, here we go. The updated spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/SPKG/gfan-0.3.p3.spkg

fixes various issues:
* put the missing .hgignore back in
* cleaned up the SPKG.txt
* checked in missing changes
* removed missed .DS_store in the dist directory

It builds fine on OSX and Linux.

One more thing: src is supposed to be a vanilla distribution of the original source tarball. So gfan-0.3.p4.spkg ought to fix that. But we can do that on a follow up ticket.

Cheers,

Michael

Attachment: **[trac_1010-tut.tex-doctest-fix.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1010/trac_1010-tut.tex-doctest-fix.patch.gz)**

Merged trac_1010_post_review_2.patch, gfan_docstrings.patch and trac_1010-tut.tex-doctest-fix.patch in Sage 2.11.alpha0. There are two potential issues left to fix:
 
* What happened to fvector? polyhedralfan certainly has nothing to do with fvector - it just happens to be in the former location of fvector.
* a clean Makefile in src in the gfan.spkg

Both the issues should be addressed in follow up tickets.

Cheers,

Michael
