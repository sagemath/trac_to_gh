Closing this ticket as fixed, as suggested by Nathann Cohen and Robert Miller:

```
Hello Minh !!!

This is a short conversation about ticket #1303 I had with Robert Miller, who concluded this ticket should be closed. As he says, what we need concerning Cayley graph is but the function Group.cayley_graph which already exists.

Nathann,

We should probably get rid of this ticket. The guy who requested it is
essentially happy with what we already have. Cayley graphs are more of
a way of constructing graphs than an object on their own, i.e. a
*constructor,* which is what we already have.
