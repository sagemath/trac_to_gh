Hi, 

I have deleted latin.sage and dfs_latin.spyx. As David did state earlier we now need to rename the files, add them to the build systems, add imports and finally turn this into a patch. Then hopefully somebody will review this quickly.

Anybody around who wants to help Carlo out?

Cheers,

Michael

To the Sage repo? Just add it and add the new file to the repo. Somebody should add this to the development manual in case it isn't in there yet, i.e. "How do I add my code to the tree in case it is all new".

This applies cleanly, but not not build without an addition to setup.py (in the top directory), since it adds a subdirectory "matrices" to combinat. With this change, it passes sage -testall, except for the plot.py failure (which has nothing to do with this patch).

I give this a positive review but leave some food for thought: In my opinion, at some point, possibly in a future version, some very minor changes to the docstring are worth considering:
1. "nauty?" should be replaced by "NICE?"
2. add REFERENCES section, with actual literature sources
3. allow base rings other than ZZ
4. discuss whether isotopism sould return a Permutation or a 
PermutationGroupElement with sage-devel

Hello,

I'll post a more in-depth review in awhile, but one thing that needs to be done is to make it so that doctests pass.

1) 'sage.combinat.matrices' has to be added in setup.py under 'sage.combinat.sf' (for example) so that Sage knows about the module.

2) All the doctests for functions which are not raised to the global namespace (via matrices.all) need to be explicitly imported in the doctest.  For example, "sage: from sage.combinat.matrices.latin import dlxcpp_find_completions".
