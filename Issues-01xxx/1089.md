Here is an update to the subgraph function to handle a list of edges.  If edges are not specified, then it reverts to the original functionality (returning an induced subgraph).

I also fix a doctest that should have been complaining in transitive_reduction and make the doctests in min_spanning_tree make more sense.

Jason,

Please include a fresh patch that comes from a clean install of sage 2.8.11. The base version does not match. Also, the function subgraph(vertices) returns the induced subgraph with the given vertices and *all* edges from the original graph whose endpoints are in vertices. Perhaps the current function should be renamed induced_subgraph, and you could make a separate subgraph_from_edges() function. It also occurs to me that we don't yet have an is_subgraph fucntion...

Jason,

I should have mentioned to apply the patches in #1088 to the clean version first, then patch on top of that.

Thanks, Robert M

Jason,

The reason I was asking you to rebase is that I already patched up the doctests from 1088 (the second patch there). As far as patches go, you can do one of the following:

1) Wait for sage-2.8.12 to be released, and do a patch on top of that.

2) Apply *both* patches in ticket 1088 to a fresh 2.8.11, and do a patch on top of that.

You've convinced me that these functionalities should be in the same function. I was just thinking that the name "subgraph" was a little misleading for a function name. Under your interpretation, all of these would be induced subgraphs, so to speak. I don't know if induced_subgraph is better, since the first thing anyone would look for would be subgraph anyway, and it's shorter to type...

Indeed, the subgraph isomorphism problem is NP-complete, but I was just talking about *is* subgraph, as a subset. Same vertices, same exact edges. I could see this being useful in some situations.
