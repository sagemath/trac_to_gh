I got the following merge conflict against 2.10.1.rc2:

```
<<<<<<< /scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-2.10.1.rc3/devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padics.py.orig.2461327829
    ALGORITHM:
        Proposition 9 of ``Efficient Computation of p-adic Heights'' (David Harvey,
        to appear in LMS JCM).

        Complexity is soft-$O(\log L \log m + \log^2 m)$.
||||||| /tmp/padics.py~base.ns4Mgb
    Complexity is soft $O(\log R \log^2 m)$.
=======
    Complexity is soft $O(\log R \log m)$.
>>>>>>> /tmp/padics.py~other.K30f_Q
```
But I also have a compilation failure:

```
/usr/include/features.h:150:1: warning: this is the location of the previous definition
src/ntl_wrap.cpp: In function ‘void ZZ_pX_InvMod_newton_unram(NTL::ZZ_pX&, const NTL::ZZ_pX&, const NTL::ZZ_pXModulus&, const NTL::ZZ_pContext&, const NTL::ZZ_pContext&)’:
src/ntl_wrap.cpp:1136: error: reference to ‘negate’ is ambiguous
```
I will poke around a little more and update this if I find anything useful.

Cheers,

Michael

#2233 fixes all 64 bit specific doctest failures. We currently have four NotYetImplemented and one fixme doctest failures left, that should happen on 32 as well as 64 bit.

Cheers,

Michael
