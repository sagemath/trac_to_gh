Attachment: **[giant_padics.hg.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1963/giant_padics.hg.gz)**

I got the following merge conflict against 2.10.1.rc2:

```
<<<<<<< /scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-2.10.1.rc3/devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padics.py.orig.2461327829
    ALGORITHM:
        Proposition 9 of ``Efficient Computation of p-adic Heights'' (David Harvey,
        to appear in LMS JCM).

        Complexity is soft-$O(\log L \log m + \log^2 m)$.
||||||| /tmp/padics.py~base.ns4Mgb
    Complexity is soft $O(\log R \log^2 m)$.
=======
    Complexity is soft $O(\log R \log m)$.
>>>>>>> /tmp/padics.py~other.K30f_Q
```
But I also have a compilation failure:

```
/usr/include/features.h:150:1: warning: this is the location of the previous definition
src/ntl_wrap.cpp: In function ‘void ZZ_pX_InvMod_newton_unram(NTL::ZZ_pX&, const NTL::ZZ_pX&, const NTL::ZZ_pXModulus&, const NTL::ZZ_pContext&, const NTL::ZZ_pContext&)’:

```
I will poke around a little more and update this if I find anything useful.

Cheers,
