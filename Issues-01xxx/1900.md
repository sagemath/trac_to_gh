There were several options available to graphs but not digraphs, so I factored the code out to generic graphs, and made sure all functionality was available there.

I further cleaned up the code a bit and hopefully made it a tad faster as well in graph_am-updated.patch, which should be applied instead of graph_am.patch.

Also, pending the outcome of the discussion on sage-devel, graph_am-over_integers.patch should be applied after graph_am-updated.patch in order to delete the over_integers parameter.

Reviews of my modifications would be appreciated.
