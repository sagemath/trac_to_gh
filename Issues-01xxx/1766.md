This is patch for the latex_embed inside the ${SAGE_BASE}/examples directory.

Now embedding plots works and makes it more usable!


Read included README.txt for more information and open the included PDF example.pdf to see the result.

It might be nice to change the filenames used for plotting to .pdf instead of .png.
This should automagically turn the included plots into vector graphics instead of bitmaps. It works for the example.tex in the .zip, but I'm not familiar enough with the plotting code to know if it has any drawbacks.

ahh okay, if this works for all types of plots (plot, matrix_plot, graphs, 3d graphs, ...) then it should be done that way. i'll try this. perhaps i'm able to make the extension customizable, then the user can select it and pdf is default. or if there are useful errors, it fallbacks from pdf to png.

I've updated the code to default to .pdf files now. Plots are fine and output-quality much better now!


It's also possible to pass more arguments to the show command. Therefore it is possible to switch back to .png if there are problems.


But plotting 3d-Graphs doesn't work (and has never) because the .show(..) command of the tachyon renderer has no filename= option. essentially, this .show() is entirely different (also docstring missing) - i'll open a ticket for this and possibly related problems.

Those aren't related to the sagetex stuff; they are something that emacs makes. I deleted them since they're not directly related to sagetex (and because I'm a vim person :).

At any rate, they are not important and you can ignore problems related to them. I can redo the patch if you'd like.

This patch applies cleanly to 2.10.2 for me.

Overall, I think this is great stuff!  I give this a positive review pending addressing a few concerns:

* when latexing a file, if a plot does not exist, the texing stops and gives an error.  Pressing enter through the errors, running sage, and then texing again works, but it is still disconcerting.  Is there any way to ignore the non-existence of a plot file, maybe with a warning that sage needs to be run?

* The patch says that E2.sobj changed.  Can we delete the file?

* In the readme, at first glance, it looks like I just need to follow the 1, 2, 3, 4 instructions, which of course give an error if I haven't latexed the dtx file yet.  Can you somehow highlight that in the readme instead of it being buried right before what looks like the important, step-by-step instructions?

* credit: somewhere, I think you ought to mention the people that did the original interface.  Maybe a note in the readme might be appropriate.  It also looks weird to have "and others" in the documentation...how about either explicitly putting their names there or just put your name there and a note mentioning that it is based on an original interface by whoever.  I'm not sure the best way to handle this (you're the one that knows how much code was there before and how much code you've done), but some note somewhere probably is in order.

That said, as soon as I saw this patch I immediately tested it, saw that it worked great, and sent the example pdf and tex file to a friend who was discussing the sage and tex combination just this last weekend.  I know he'll be excited!

Pressing enter through the errors, running sage, and then texing again works, but it is still disconcerting.  Is there any way to ignore the non-existence of a plot file, maybe with a warning that sage needs to be run?\n\n\n\nThis can be done, but then the only way to tell that you need to run Sage is the package warning issued at the end of running latex, which I tried to make reasonably obvious but can be missed. As it is, the missing file error looks like\n\n```\n! LaTeX Error: File `sage-plots-for-example.tex/plot-0' not found.\n```\n\nwhich, along with the package warning at the end of the run, is reasonably informative, and it behaves like `\\includegraphics` commands.\n\nIf you really want latex to run without stopping, you can always use `latex -interaction=nonstopmode`. \n\nThe current behavior seems more natural to me, but I can change it if that's the consensus.

Replying to [jason](#comment%3A15):

>* when latexing a file, if a plot does not exist, the texing stops and gives an error.  Pressing enter through the errors, running sage, and then texing again works, but it is still disconcerting.  Is there any way to ignore the non-existence of a plot file, maybe with a warning that sage needs to be run?



This can be done, but then the only way to tell that you need to run Sage is the package warning issued at the end of running latex, which I tried to make reasonably obvious but can be missed. As it is, the missing file error looks like

```
! LaTeX Error: File `sage-plots-for-example.tex/plot-0' not found.
```

which, along with the package warning at the end of the run, is reasonably informative, and it behaves like `\includegraphics` commands.

If you really want latex to run without stopping, you can always use `latex -interaction=nonstopmode`. 

The current behavior seems more natural to me, but I can change it if that's the consensus. I can also have the behavior be toggle-able via a package option.

Yes. It's just cruft that `example.tex` produces. It gets regenerated when you run Sage on the example.sage script.

Ah, so you couldn't be bothered to read the text, and took the easy way out? :)

I changed the readme to make that a bit more obvious. Perhaps I'm just too accustomed to `.dtx` and `.ins` files -- ideally we will eventually distribute this with some processing already done, so that the prospective user can read the documentation and see the example file without doing any processing.

I already had some credits at the end of the documentation, but I added a line in the readme pointing to them.

I've updated [the all-in-one zip file](http://homepage.univie.ac.at/harald.schilly/sage/latex_embed.zip). 

In my opinion the README should be more detailed and there is a small problem: when just running the latex/sage/latex commands, the graphics are not included (white boxes with black border). I don't know why that's just how it does it ;) ... using pdflatex at the last step does what's now in the .zip file!

The repository must be cleaned up, because there are files tracked which should not. See .zip file for all necessary files plus the prerendered .pdf docs - they could be included in the repository, because i think it's nice for a new user to instantaneously see what's possible.
