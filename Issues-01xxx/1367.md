I noticed this bug when thinking about implementing factorization of integers
in a general relative number field (via the absolute field corresponding
to it).  If this bug were fixed, then general factorization would be
trivial to implement, as suggested by the example below. 

```
sage: K.<a,b> = NumberField([x^2 + 1, x^2 + 2])
sage: A = K.absolute_field('z')
sage: I = A.factor_integer(3)[0][0]
sage: from_A, to_A = A.structure()
sage: G = [from_A(z) for z in I.gens()]; G
[3, (-2*b - 1)*a + b - 1]
sage: K.fractional_ideal(G)

The problem is triggered at line 89 of `number_field_ideal_rel.py` (in 3.0.5):

```
            gens = [ L(R(x.lift().lift())) for x in gens ]
```
In the case above , `L` is the field `K` and (when `x` is `gens[1]`) `R(x.lift().lift())` is the polynomial `(-b + 1)*x - b - 2` over the base field of `K`.   But the real difficulty is that `NumberFieldElement.__init__` doesn't work properly for relative fields; it ought to coerce a polynomial over the base field into the field, but doesn't.

Rather than trying to resolve the general problem with this coercion, it's easy to rewrite the above line 89, as in 
the attached patch.  Then the following works:

```
sage: K.<a, b> = NumberField([x^2 + 1, x^2 + 2])
sage: A = K.absolute_field('z')
sage: from_A, to_A = A.structure()
sage: abs_ideals = [f[0] for f in A.factor(3)]
sage: rel_ideals = [K.ideal([from_A(y) for y in I.gens()]) for I in abs_ideals]
sage: rel_ideals
[Fractional ideal (3, a - 1), Fractional ideal (3, (-1)*a - 1)]
sage: prod(rel_ideals)
Fractional ideal (3)
sage: [J.is_principal() for J in rel_ideals]
[True, True]
```

Hi Francis,

Hi,

Two things. First, the patch needs at least one doctest.

Second, something very fishy is going on. After applying this patch, I try out the example at the top of the definition of `NumberFieldFractionalIdeal_rel`, under the WARNING:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField([x^2 + 1, x^2 + 2]); K
Number Field in a0 with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 over its base field
sage: i = K.ideal([a+1])
sage: i
Fractional ideal (1)
```

If `a+1` generates the unit ideal, it had better be a unit. But a+1 is really 1+i (the Gaussian integer), which is not a unit. Alternatively

```
sage: (a+1).norm()
4
```
which is not +1 or -1.

Continuing the calculation, we have

```
sage: i.gens()
(a + 1,)
sage: i.gens_reduced()
(1,)
```
and `i.__repr__()` via `i._repr_short(self)` uses `i.gens_reduced()`

The problem is with lines 90–92 of `number_field_ideal_rel.py`

```
            ## Make sure that gens[1] is in L, not K
            Lcoeff = [ L(x) for x in list(gens[1].polynomial()) ]
            gens[1] = S.hom([L.gen()])(S(Lcoeff))
```
which seem totally wrong-headed.  In the case in question `gens` is `[2, (-b)*a]` (which is ok).  Then `(-b)*a` gets 
converted to `1/2*x^2 + 3/2`, which is the polynomial representing it in the *absolute* field, after which `x` is (in a most
convoluted way) replaced by `a`, giving (of course) `1` (which is not ok).

There must be a much simpler way to achieve the object of ensuring that the generator is an element of the relative field.

The more I look at `number_field_ideal_rel.py`, the more I notice needs doing.  For example, in

```
    def absolute_ideal(self):
        """
        If this is an ideal in the extension L/K, return the ideal with
        the same generators in the absolute field L/Q.
        """
        try:
            return self.__absolute_ideal
        except AttributeError:
            rnf = self.number_field().pari_rnf()
            L = self.number_field().absolute_field('a')
            R = L['x']
            nf = L.pari_nf()
            genlist = [L(R(x.polynomial())) for x in list(self.gens())]
            self.__absolute_ideal = L.ideal(genlist)
            return self.__absolute_ideal
```
(1) The generator of the absolute field is always called 'a'; it would be much better if the user could choose the name, and, even better, was also able to get the absolute ideal via something like `A = K.absolute_field('z'); A(J)`. (2) Neither `rnf` nor `nf` get used. (3) Since `x.polynomial()` is a rational polynomial, `L(R(x.polynomial()))` is the same as `L(x.polynomial())`. (4) In this context, `list(self.gens())`is no different from `self.gens()`.

I've come to the conclusion that a more serious rewrite (with some more testing doctests) is needed, for which I'm unlikely to have much time in the next few weeks.  My one-line patch was really only meant to point out where the defect lay.

Do not apply `sage-1367.patch`.

There may be doctests missing on some functions, but I can't fix this, document a ton of stuff, and doctest every untested function in one go.  This is very much a work in progress patch.

There are a few things I want to discuss (probably at lunch).

The first is that I'm not completely convinced that the following example is the behavior we want:

sage: K.<a> = NumberField(ZZ['x'].0^5 + 2, 'a') 
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(ZZ['x'].0^2 + 3*a, 'b') 
sage: u = QQ['u'].gen() 
sage: t = u.parent()['t'].gen()

sage: L(u*5)
5*b

I guess if we're going to convert at all this makes the most sense, but I want to think about it a bit more.  I'm even less convinced of the following:

sage: W.<w> = t.parent()[]
sage: L(w*5)
5*b
sage: L(W(t))
5*a
sage: L(W(u))
TypeError

The second issue is a naming one.  The function coerce_non_number_field_element_in should probably be a convert function rather than a coerce one.

Overall, though, it looks quite good.

The patch explains why the first behaviour is correct.  Do you want

```
sage: x = ZZ['x'].0
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(5)
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(x^2 - a)
sage: L(x + 2) in L
True
```
or

```
sage: L(x + 2) in K
True
```

I think the first is *much* more desirable.

Your second issue is a good point.  I should make sure you're either giving QQ['x'] (or something isomorphic) or QQ['base']['ext'] or base['ext'].  But that's hard at this time.

As for naming: make it a new ticket.  It's not worth shuffing a rename in with a reorganization in my opinion.
