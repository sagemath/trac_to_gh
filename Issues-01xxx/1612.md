There doesn't seem to be a way to find eigenforms within spaces of modular forms.

Also, the sturm_bound and hecke_bound methods seem not to work:

```
S37=CuspForms(37,2)
S37.sturm_bound()
```

```
Exception (click to the left for traceback):
...
AttributeError: 'CuspidalSubmodule_g0_Q' object has no attribute '_ModularFormsSpace__sturm_bound'
```
