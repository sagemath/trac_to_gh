This is a very very simple patch that makes it so 

  sage -b

takes 1 seconds (on my mac laptop) instead of 10 seconds, so long as 
no Cython code has changed.  Otherwise it works just as before.

This is orthogonal to Bobby Moretti's patch for caching Cython dependencies.
Both should be used.

This is much simpler -- all it does is -- in 1/100th of a second (or so) compute a hash got from all cython-related files in the repo, and if that hasn't changed from last time, skip all cython-ing of code.
