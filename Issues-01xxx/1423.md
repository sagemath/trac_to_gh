I declare it a bug no matter what, since I don't like it at all.
I only have a minute at the moment, but just want to remark
that when you do %python in the notebook or use python
mode, here is the Python code that actually evaluates the
input to the cell:

sage: python.eval??


File: /Users/was/s/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/misc/python.py
Source Code (starting at line 5):
    def eval(self, x, globals={}, locals={}):
        x = x.strip()
        y = x.split('\n')
        if len(y) == 0:
            return ''
        s = '\n'.join(y[:-1]) + '\n'
        t = y[-1]
        try:
            z = compile(t + '\n', '', 'single')
        except SyntaxError:
            s += '\n' + t
            z = None
        #else:
        #    s += '\n' + t
        eval(compile(s, '', 'exec'), globals, locals)
        if not z is None:
            eval(z, globals, locals)
        return ''

Looking at that code, does anybody see why the second global foo gets ignored inside
the function body of mumble?  I don't immediately see why.
