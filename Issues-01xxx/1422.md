This is a follow-up to the BibTeX idea from #1348:

```
6.3 how do i reference sage?
If you write a paper using SAGE, please reference computations done with
SAGE by including
[SAGE], SAGE Mathematical Software, Version 2.6, http://www.sagemath.org
^^^
How about a function bibtex() similar to latex() which gives a bibtex
entry? Coudl default to bibtex(sage) but could also provide
bibtex(pari), bibtex(gp), bibtex(Singular), etc.
```
