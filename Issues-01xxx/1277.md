The culprit is this line, which is now in patches/makefile:

CFLAGS = $(INCS) -funroll-loops -fexpensive-optimizations $(FLINT_TUNE) -O3^M

On ia64 FLINT_TUNE is properly set to not include funroll-loops, but for some dumb
reason -funroll-loops is put in the CFLAGS explicitly in the patches/makefile included
in Sage.  

Changing the above line to 

CFLAGS = $(INCS)  -fexpensive-optimizations $(FLINT_TUNE) -O3^M

completely fixes the problem. 

As an aside, I don't think the .svn subdirectories should be included with
with flint-*.spkg.  

A new flint spkg is at

The new FLINT.spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/flint-1.0.spkg

should solve the problem.
