There are some issues with cython spyx files:

1. There is *still* nothing in the documentation anywhere in sage about cinclude, clib, etc.  Here's a hint:

```
Basically you put
# clang c
# clib  cblas
# cfile myfile.c
# cinclude "/usr/local/include"
```
Questions -- where can one put these?   Must the # be there?  
However this is documented, at a bare minimum typing 

```
sage: cython?
sage: load?
sage: attach?
```
should give enough information to find docs that clearly explain this cinclude, etc. directives. 

2. Create a file a.pxi and a file b.pyx.  Put one of the # directives in the .pxi file and include the pxi file in the pyx file.  The directive is ignored.  This caused a ton of confusion today.

(1) should have been dealt via #3530, i.e. the documentation of the pragmas. 

(2) is potentially still valid and I am not sure whose fault it is: Sage or Cython. 

I am adding Martin and Robert to the CC field here.

Cheers,

Michael
