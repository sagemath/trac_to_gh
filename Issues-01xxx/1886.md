Attachment: **[K732SSE1.tgz.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1886/K732SSE1.tgz.gz)**

I followed the directions here:
   http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/devel/atlas_devel/atlas_devel.html#SECTION00070000000000000000

In particular, I did:

```
   1. sage -f -m atlas-3.8.p7
   2. cd spkg/build/atlas-3.8.p7
   3. cd ATLAS-build/ARCHS
   4. make ArchNew
   5. make tarfile
```
