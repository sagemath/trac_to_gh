As reported by 'Octoploid' on IRC: The preparser crashes if a line starts with '...'.

This is caused by a string index in preparse_ellipsis() becoming negative and wrapping to the end of the string.

Patch attached. This makes preparse('...') return 'Ellipsis'. Not sure if that's the desired behaviour. Maybe a syntax error would be better?

This patch fixes the problem. 

I agree that a syntax error would be preferable, see second patch (to replace the first). I also made the error on [1..] more explicit.
