The patch

fixes a bug reported by Carlo H. Part of his email is pasted below:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Hi,

I'm doing some work with groups. Using gap.Image() I can get a
permutation like this:

```
sage: x
(1,2)(3,7)(4,6)(5,8)
```
But to make a permutation group out of this element I have to enclose
the x in two sets of brackets:

```
sage: PermutationGroup([[x]])
Permutation Group with generators [(1,2)(3,7)(4,6)(5,8)]
```
On the other hand, the following command fails (see below for code and output):

```
sage: PermutationGroup([x])
```
In my mind the second version is clearer - x is a permutation so [x]
is a list of permutations and I should be able to use that to get a
group.

Should SAGE do a coercion here, or am I doing something in a strange way?

Code and output:

sage: c = F.gen(3)
