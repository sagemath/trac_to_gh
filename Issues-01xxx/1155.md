The patch 
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/patches/permgp-2007-11-12.hg
fixes a bug reported by Carlo H. Part of his email is pasted below:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Hi,

I'm doing some work with groups. Using gap.Image() I can get a
permutation like this:

```
sage: x
(1,2)(3,7)(4,6)(5,8)
```
But to make a permutation group out of this element I have to enclose
the x in two sets of brackets:

```
sage: PermutationGroup([[x]])
Permutation Group with generators [(1,2)(3,7)(4,6)(5,8)]
```
On the other hand, the following command fails (see below for code and output):

```
sage: PermutationGroup([x])
```
In my mind the second version is clearer - x is a permutation so [x]
is a list of permutations and I should be able to use that to get a
group.

Should SAGE do a coercion here, or am I doing something in a strange way?

Code and output:

```

----------------------------------------------------------------------

sage: p = 2
sage: assert is_prime(p)
sage:
sage: F = gap.new("FreeGroup(3)")
sage:
sage: a = F.gen(1)
sage: b = F.gen(2)
sage: c = F.gen(3)
sage:
sage: rels = []
sage: rels.append( a**Integer(p) )
sage: rels.append( b**Integer(p) )
sage: rels.append( c**Integer(p) )
sage: rels.append( a*b*((b*a*c)**Integer(-1)) )
sage: rels.append( c*a*((a*c)**Integer(-1)) )
sage: rels.append( c*b*((b*c)**Integer(-1)) )
sage:
sage: N = gap.NormalClosure(F, gap.Subgroup(F, rels))
sage: niso = gap.NaturalHomomorphismByNormalSubgroupNC(F, N)
sage:
sage: x = gap.Image(niso, a)
sage: x
