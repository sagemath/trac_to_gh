There are several different kinds of fonts that MathJax can use, including STIX fonts (which come with browsers like Firefox, IIRC), as well as some custom fonts that are distributed in #9774.  We did NOT include in #9774 the image fonts (way too big), which is what this ticket is about.  We could have an optional spkg for mathjax image fonts.  Most browsers use the fonts that we do include with #9774, but there will still probably be some older browsers that will need image fonts.

So I'd say: don't close this ticket, but make it specific: an optional spkg for mathjax png image fonts.
