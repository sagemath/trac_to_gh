There are several different kinds of fonts that MathJax can use, including STIX fonts (which come with browsers like Firefox, IIRC), as well as some custom fonts that are distributed in #9774.  We did NOT include in #9774 the image fonts (way too big), which is what this ticket is about.  We could have an optional spkg for mathjax image fonts.  Most browsers use the fonts that we do include with #9774, but there will still probably be some older browsers that will need image fonts.

So I'd say: don't close this ticket, but make it specific: an optional spkg for mathjax png image fonts.

-It is incredibly confusing for most people to install the jsmath fonts.  Morever, that they must download them off an external site is terrible -- what if they install Sage on an internal network or laptop with no net access, and need the fonts.  The fonts should be included in Sage, and the "you should install the jsmath fonts" warning should be much nicer and directly give a link to the fonts.   
+Some older browsers might need extra fonts.  Make them available as an optional spkg.  See discussion below for details.  This depends on #11080 and #9774.
