The patch no longer applies cleanly:

```
mabshoff@sage:/tmp/Work-mabshoff/release-cycles/sage-2.8.13.alpha0/devel/sage$ hg import minkowski.patch
applying minkowski.patch
patching file sage/rings/rational_field.py
Hunk #1 succeeded at 298 with fuzz 2 (offset 23 lines).
Hunk #2 FAILED at 362
Hunk #3 FAILED at 370
Hunk #4 FAILED at 378
3 out of 4 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/rings/rational_field.py.rej
abort: patch failed to apply
```

Cheers,
