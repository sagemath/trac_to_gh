The backtrace William posted on sage-devel shows m4ri is using a min() defined in a file nu.c instead of the min() in m4ri itself.

This seems to point at symmetrica, which has a file nu.c with a min() defined in it.

William worked around this linker issue by adding a line

#define min(x,y) ((x < y)?x:y)

at the top of brilliantrussian.c and packedmatrix.c. I hope there aren't any other subtle things like this that could hurt us elsewhere. Symmetrica defines a lot of 'common' function names like min.
