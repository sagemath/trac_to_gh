I don't know if we implement any, but there are functions such that `d^2f/dxdy != d^2 f/dydx`. 

However, I think the ability to pass in a monomial is an excellent idea. Perhaps beyond the scope of this patch though.

In mathematica, you can pass a list to the differentiate command and the function will be differentiated with respect to successive elements of the list.  So maybe something like:

f.diff([x,y,y,x])

could specify differentiating first wrt x, then y, then y, and then x again.

The command in the patch could be invoked as:

f.diff([x]*3)

I agree that f.diff(x,3) looks better, though.
