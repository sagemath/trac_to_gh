<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
It actually does exactly what it is supposed to do in the documentation [from Ideal?]:

```
        Alternatively, one can also call this function with the syntax
             Ideal(gens)
        where gens is a nonempty list of generators or a single generator.
```
From Sage 2.9.1.1:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: R
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
sage: R.ideal(x^2,x-y)
Ideal (x^2, x - y) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
sage: Ideal([x^2,x-y])
Ideal (x^2, x - y) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
sage: Ideal(x^2,x-y)
Principal ideal (x^2) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
```

<a id='comment:3'>**Comment 3:**</a>
The patch fixes the problem pointed out by Nick, and makes Ideal() complain loudly rather than return the wrong thing in other cases.

Before:

```
sage: Ideal(3,5)
Principal ideal (3) of Integer Ring
sage: Ideal(ZZ,3,5)
Principal ideal (3) of Integer Ring
```

After:

```
sage: Ideal(3,5)
Principal ideal (1) of Integer Ring
sage: Ideal(ZZ,3,5)
...

<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: coerce must be either True or False
```

Sorry this patch doesn't work right. With the patch I get for example:

```
sage: Ideal(2, 4, 6)
[...]
<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: coerce must be either True or False

which is still very confusing.

The recursive function call is not the right way to do this. Should use the `def func(*x, **kwds)` idiom instead; to see an example, look at

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: R.ideal??
