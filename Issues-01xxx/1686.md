The file

```
SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/numerical/tests.py
```

contains this doctest:

```
sage: from scipy import sparse
sage: import arpack

#Test arpack
#This matrix is the finite difference approximation to
# the eigenvalue problem
#d^2f/dx^2=\lambda f, on [0,\pi], which boundary values 0
# The lowest eigenvalue calulated should be close to 1
sage: import scipy
sage: n=scipy.zeros((3,500))
sage: n[0,:]=-1
sage: n[1,:]=2
sage: n[2,:]=-1
sage: A=sparse.spdiags(n,[-1,0,1],int(500),int(500))
sage: e,v=arpack.speigs.ARPACK_eigs(A.matvec,500,6,which='SM')
sage: e[0]*float(501/pi)**2
0.999............
```

The line 

```
sage: e,v=arpack.speigs.ARPACK_eigs(A.matvec,500,6,which='SM')
```
crashes on at least one Pentium 4 machine with Sage built using gfortran.

If any sage developers replicate this on their personal hardware, please
email sage-devel.  We have removed the above doctest until this gets fixed.

My assumption is that #2303 fixed this issue, too. So we should apply the reverse of the doctest patch and close this ticket.

There is no actual patch to review yet, just consider the reversing of the above doctest patch.

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael
