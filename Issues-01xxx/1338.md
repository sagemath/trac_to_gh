It seems that symmetrica doesn't do too well on big endian machines. On Sparc as well as PPC under Linux the sfa doctest segfaults or shows bad things happening under valgrind. Mike Hanson said that there will be a new upstream version of symmetrica soon, so let's see if those fix the issue.

Cheers,

Michael

This bug is not invalid, since it is probably fixed by #1417. But only when we can confirm that we will close the bug as fixed.

We do not invalidate bugs because they were fixed by another ticket.

The new symmetrica does not fix the issue and it still dumps core during various doctests. While something else might still be involved (libSingular) the ticket should remain open until we sort this all out.

The spkg is at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-4.0/alpha0/symmetrica-2.0.p3.spkg

The patch posted makes the symmetrica extension depends on def.h, so it gets rebuild when symmetrica is being updated.

Cheers,

Michael
