Add function to do gramm schmidt orthogonalization and also to verify the LLL criterion to Sage.

NOTE: I have mostly done this.  This trac is just so I have a place to submit a patch.  So you shouldn't do this :-).

From David Joyner:

```
I looked at it but can't figure out how to apply it to a cloned version
of SAGE. It seems to make sense but I'd like to test it out.
Sorry for the delay. I had a final to type up and lots of grading.
