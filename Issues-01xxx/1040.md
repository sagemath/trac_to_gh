Now that we allow notation such as

```
QQ[2^(1/3)]
```
to create a number field, the following is totally wrong and
needs to be fixed ASAP:

```
sage: K.<a> = QQ[2^(1/3)]
sage: K
Univariate Polynomial Ring in a over Rational Field
sage: parent(a)
Univariate Polynomial Ring in a over Rational Field
```

More:

This is because the preparser is written stupidly in this case:

```
sage: K.<a> = QQ[2^(1/3)]
sage: preparse('K.<a> = QQ[2^(1/3)]')
'K = QQ["a"]; (a,) = K._first_ngens(Integer(1))'
```

I think this is what *should* happen:

```
sage: K.<a> = QQ[2^(1/3)]
sage: preparse('K.<a> = QQ[2^(1/3)]')
'K = QQ["2^(1/3)"]; (a,) = K._first_ngens(Integer(1))'
```

The previous behavior should only happen in the case when nothing is between brackets, as a sort of short cut:

```
sage: K.<a> = QQ[2^(1/3)]
sage: preparse('K.<a> = QQ[]')
'K = QQ["a"]; (a,) = K._first_ngens(Integer(1))'
```
