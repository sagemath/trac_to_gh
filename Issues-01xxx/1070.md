For instance, if local/lib/libmpfi.a changes, then sage/rings/real_mpfi.pyx should be rebuilt.  

Most of the information to do this is in setup.py; the missing piece is knowing which libraries are static-only, which can presumably be determined by looking in local/lib/ for libraries with ".a" files and without corresponding ".so" files.

Touching libecm.a now leads to a rebuild of the ecm extension.
