For instance, if local/lib/libmpfi.a changes, then sage/rings/real_mpfi.pyx should be rebuilt.  

Most of the information to do this is in setup.py; the missing piece is knowing which libraries are static-only, which can presumably be determined by looking in local/lib/ for libraries with ".a" files and without corresponding ".so" files.

This has been fixed during Sage 3.2 or so with the new build system. For example the following change makes the ecm extension depend on libecm.a:

```

Touching libecm.a now leads to a rebuild of the ecm extension.

Cheers,
