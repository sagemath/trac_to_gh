This bug was reported by James Carlson:

```
sage: R.<u,v> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: g = u^4 + v^4 + u^3 + v^3
sage: I = ideal(g) + ideal(g.jacob())
sage: I.dimension()
0
sage: PD = I.primary_decomposition()
sage: len(PD)
1
sage: P = PD[0]
sage: I == P
True
sage: I.vector_space_dimension()
9 
sage: P.vector_space_dimension()
4 # <<<<<<<<<<<<< doesn't match
```
