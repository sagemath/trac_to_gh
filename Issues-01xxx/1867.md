NOTE: This ticket depends on #5068, which is done.

There is a standard algorithm to factor polynomials over a non-prime field that reduces the problem to factoring over a prime field and using gcd over the non-prime field.  It seems that gcd works fine over non-prime fields in Singular, as does factoring over prime fields, so this should work for us.   Probably singular doesn't do this because either it is slower or it is too much of a pain to implement in Singular (which isn't much of a language), or maybe they just don't care about this problem.

Anyway, to start this off, here is a sample session that illustrates the idea:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(9)
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(k)
sage: f = (x-a)*(y-a)
sage: f.factor()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: factorization of multivariate polynomials over non-prime fields explicitly disabled due to bugs in Singular
sage: singular(f)
sage: x*y+(-a)*x+(-a)*y+(a+1)
x*y + ( - a)*x + ( - a)*y + (a + 1)
sage: singular(f).factorH()
[1]:
   _[1]=1
   _[2]=x*y+(-a)*x+(-a)*y+(a+1)
[2]:
   1,1
sage: g = f*(x-a^3)*(y-a^3); g
x^2*y^2 - x^2*y - x*y^2 - x^2 + x*y - y^2 + x + y + 1
sage: gg = GF(3)['x,y'](repr(g))    # why doesn't change ring or coerce work
sage: F = gg.factor()
sage: factor1 = R(F[0][0])
sage: factor2 = R(F[1][0])
sage: factor1.gcd(f)
(a)*y + ( - a - 1)
sage: factor2.gcd(f)
(a)*x + ( - a - 1)

<a id='comment:2'></a>I have attached a patch that:

* fully implements this idea.  This works with dramatically higher probability than singular itself.  Singular usually gives wrong answers, whereas with this code it seems right "about 99% of the time".  E.g., this runs for a long time before finding a problem:

```
k.<a> = GF(3^2); R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(k)
for i in range(500):
    v = [R.random_element() for _ in range(3)]; print i; assert prod(v).factor(proof=False).prod() == prod(v)

1
...
328
boom!
AssertionError: bug in Singular factoring an auxiliary polynomial over GF(p): bad multiplicity (1, 2)
```

and



* found bugs in factorization over GF(p) -- see ticket #5068.  Added a proof flag, and *only* allow factoring if proof=False.

I think this should go into sage because: 
1. It works massively better than singular currently does over GF(q).
2. Even if singular does fix say factoring, maybe they will only fix GF(p) factorization and not GF(p^e).  Then this code will make factoring over GF(p^e) work too.
3. If we ever implement our own factorization then this code means we only have to implement GF(p), at least for starters.  It would be very nice if we at least had *some* implementation that works, even if is slow.
4. This patch adds some useful functions such as map_coefficients (which has the same api as the corresponding function in sage-combinat), and _norm_over_nonprime_finite_field.
