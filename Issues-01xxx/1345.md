This behavior seems strange:

```
 sage: foo = I+I
 sage: foo._operands
 [I, I]
 sage: [type(i) for i in foo._operands]
 [<class 'sage.calculus.calculus.SymbolicConstant'>,
  <class 'sage.functions.constants.I_class'>]
```
And here's another strange thing (probably the same bug):

```
 sage: is_SymbolicExpression(SR(I))
 False
```
