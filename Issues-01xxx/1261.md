It would be very desirable for "sage -br" to take advantage of multi-processor and multi-core machines automatically.

The following irc session describes an idea for a way to easily implement this.
The main idea is to use the dry_run option to setup(...) in setup.py, capture
the output of the dry_run, then run those commands in parallel.

```
[9:21pm] was_: When "sage -br" runs we first (with custom code I wrote) run cython on a bunch of files -- for this the order is probably important.
[9:21pm] was_: (??)
[9:22pm] was_: Anyway, after that, distutils runs gcc or g++ on a large number of files.  I think for that the order doesn't matter much.
[9:22pm] cwitty: The order of running Cython should not be important.
[9:22pm] was_: Are you sure?
[9:22pm] mabshoff: ok
[9:22pm] was_: There is a dry_run option to the setup function in devel/sage/setup.py.
[9:22pm] cwitty: (Cython depends on source files, like .pxd; but I'm pretty sure it doesn't depend on the generated .c or .cpp files.)
[9:23pm] was_: cwitty -- I think you're right.
[9:23pm] mabshoff: each file cython compiles is a dynmaic library?
[9:23pm] was_: Definitely things are easier if you are.
[9:23pm] cwitty: mabshoff, yes.
[9:23pm] was_: cython just makes .c/.cpp/.h files as output; that's it.
[9:23pm] was_: And everything is dynamic.
[9:23pm] mabshoff: Then it shouldn't have compile time dependencies.
[9:23pm] was_: Anyway, back to my idea.
[9:23pm] mabshoff: link time at import, but that doesn't matter.
[9:23pm] was_: (There are possibly some mild dependencies since multiple files are combined to make one dynamic library in some cases.)
[9:24pm] was_: Anyway, back to my idea.
[9:24pm] was_: If you look at devel/sage/setup.py, and put dry_run=True as the last option to the huge setup(...) function,
[9:24pm] was_: then distutils will simply print out all the gcc commands it *would* run.
[9:24pm] was_: But it doesn't run thme.
[9:24pm] mabshoff: I see where you are going 
[9:25pm] was_: So my crazy idea is to run setup once as a dry_run, capture all the output, divide it up, do the gcc's in parallel, then run distutils again with dry_run=False,
[9:25pm] was_: which will be fast.
[9:25pm] mabshoff:
[9:25pm] mabshoff: Let's hope it works.
[9:25pm] was_: I have no idea if it would really work.
[9:25pm] mabshoff: Even then we could also create a makefile from cython info and run parallel make on that.
[9:26pm] was_: If we wanted, though it seems hardly necessary.
[9:26pm] mabshoff: KISS
[9:26pm] was_: yep.
[9:26pm] was_: Make is pretty KISS though, at least the way we're thinking of using it.
[9:26pm] was_: KISS was why the spkg build system uses make.
[9:27pm] mabshoff:
[9:27pm] mabshoff: I just got a timeout with -long running doctests.
[9:27pm] mabshoff: Maybe we should disable TIMEOUT with -long
[9:27pm] was_: There should be a timeout but it should be way longer.
[9:27pm] mabshoff: ok
[9:27pm] was_: E.g., David Joyner put an annoying #long doctest in once that took *days* to run.
[9:27pm] was_: Very annoying.
[9:27pm] was_: It was good that there was a timeout.
[9:28pm] was_: I asked him about it and he said it was a "record breaking" computation...
[9:28pm] mabshoff:
[9:28pm] mabshoff: I think the doctest finishes, but then python realises that the TIMEOUT was exceeded.
[9:29pm] was_: that sounds dumb.
[9:29pm] mabshoff:
[9:29pm] mabshoff: I set my timeout to 30 minutes for now on my copy.
[9:29pm] was_: I just did some tests with my parallel "sage -br" above and it looks very promising.
[9:30pm] mabshoff: Is it going in 2.8.14? *ducks*
[9:30pm] was_: no
[9:30pm] was_: I want to release 2.8.14 in an hour.
[9:30pm] mabshoff: I thought so.
[9:33pm] was_: For smaller files running cython takes longer than gcc.
[9:33pm] was_: E.g., I just tested on sage/libs/cremona/*.pyx, and it takes < 4 seconds to run GCC and nearly 12 seconds to run Cython.
[9:33pm] mabshoff: ok
[9:33pm] was_: Maybe we should write Cython in Cython (ducks)
[9:34pm] mabshoff: my thoughts exactly.
[9:34pm] mabshoff: For 10% of the code it would probably be worth it for performance reasons.
[9:34pm] mabshoff: Maybe you should suggest it to Robert.
[9:34pm] was_: But from the point of view of parallel sage -br, it just means we need to do that in parallel too...
[9:34pm] was_: I.e., both are worth doing.
[9:35pm] mabshoff: Yep,.
[9:35pm] was_: First should be the gcc code.

* I don't understand what the option parsing code has to do in the build system? 
* class enviroment ought to be class environment
* there ought to be spaces between defs 
* documentation in general is missing, but we agreed that it would be added past the review
* how much code duplication is going on here with code like ptest?

I need to take a closer look to see what the code actually does.

Cheers,

Michael
