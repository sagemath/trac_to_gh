In what should be a very small subsection of the reference manual, the Visualizing Graphs section contains the documentation for *every* function in graph.py.

See
http://sagemath.org/doc/html/ref/node48.html currently to see this.

A consequence of this is that it is very hard to find the documentation for a graph function when browsing the source because the table of contents does not indicate that all these are hidden under a sub section.


Component: **documentation**
