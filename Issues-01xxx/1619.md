* packaged upstream version 0.94f
* removed some temporary files
* adapted the allfaces.c patch
* updated the SPKG changelog
* did not update the dist/debian directory
* did not integrate #3297 nor #3304
* did not commit anything into the .hg repository 

PS: this comment was at first mis-located at #3297
