There are instances in which Sage thinks that a one-dimensional space of modular symbols is not simple, and it decomposes the space into a one-dimensional and a zero-dimensional subspace:

```
sage: C=ModularSymbols(1,14,0,GF(5)).cuspidal_submodule()
sage: C
Modular Symbols subspace of dimension 1 of Modular Symbols space of dimension 2 for Gamma_0(1) of weight 14 with sign 0 over Finite Field of size 5
sage: C.is_simple()
False
sage: C.simple_factors()

[Modular Symbols subspace of dimension 1 of Modular Symbols space of dimension 2 for Gamma_0(1) of weight 14 with sign 0 over Finite Field of size 5,
 Modular Symbols subspace of dimension 0 of Modular Symbols space of dimension 2 for Gamma_0(1) of weight 14 with sign 0 over Finite Field of size 5]
```
