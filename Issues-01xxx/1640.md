Documentation missing:

```
E = EllipticCurve('5077a')
E.heegner_discriminants?
```


says


```
File:        /opt/sage/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py
Type:        <type 'instancemethod'>
Definition:  E.heegner_discriminants(bound)
Docstring: 
x.__init__(...) initializes x; see x.__class__.__doc__ for signature
```


but


```
E.heegner_index?
```


is ok.
