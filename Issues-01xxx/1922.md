This is an update for lprint().

* renamed to pretty_print_default()
* _show_hook is now pretty_print()

Both functions are smarter now.

Someone (me?) should go through latex.py and clean it out.  There are lots of other functions like jsMath(), typeset(), etc. that all appear to do the same thing.

Component: **notebook**
