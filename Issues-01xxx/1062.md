<wstein> 
 The new ?? help looks quite nice. It would
 be good for gp.foo? to use it.
```

The idea is that

```
sage: foo = gp(x)
sage: foo.polroots?
```

should use the help text from the gp command `??polroots`.

The obvious approach is to change '?%s' to '??%s' in gp.py's help() method.  This doesn't quite work, for two reasons:

1) gphelp carefully formats the text to fit in the current line width, and then Sage displays this text indented; so almost every line wraps.

2) gphelp uses control characters to make words bold, underlined, etc.; when the help is viewed from the notebook, these control codes are visible in the output, and look very ugly.

This works in `cypari2` which is de facto the way to use PARI in Sage

```
sage: x.polroots?
Signature:      x.polroots(precision)
Docstring:     
   Complex roots of the given polynomial using Schonhage's method, as
   modified by Gourdon.
```

I do not agree that this works. We currently display only the short documentation, for pari() objects as well as for gp() objects.

The complete doc is much longer.
