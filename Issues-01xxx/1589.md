If you try to use jmol over https, every single time
you display an image it displays the following dialog box:

"Client Authentication: The client is trying to ... Please select
the certificate:"

Then there is a list with no certificates, and a button "Details"
that when clicked does nothing.    

This is really annoying.


Component: **graphics**

This is a known issue with java and https. See http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6186280

However, to use http we might need to sign the applet, which would be a (different) dialog. 

There may be something we can change on the twisted side of things so that it knows not to ask for a client certificate. This I think is our best bet, but I am very unfamiliar with the notebook authentication code (but would be willing to learn).

I have confirmed that this is a twisted authentication issue, one can serve applets over https (and have said applets request resources) without this annoying dialog. 

I'm looking into our authentication code now.
