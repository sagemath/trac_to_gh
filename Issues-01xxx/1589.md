If you try to use jmol over https, every single time
you display an image it displays the following dialog box:

"Client Authentication: The client is trying to ... Please select
the certificate:"

Then there is a list with no certificates, and a button "Details"
that when clicked does nothing.    

This is really annoying.

This is a known issue with java and https. See http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6186280

However, to use http we might need to sign the applet, which would be a (different) dialog. 

There may be something we can change on the twisted side of things so that it knows not to ask for a client certificate. This I think is our best bet, but I am very unfamiliar with the notebook authentication code (but would be willing to learn).

I have confirmed that this is a twisted authentication issue, one can serve applets over https (and have said applets request resources) without this annoying dialog. 

I'm looking into our authentication code now.

GNUTLS provides two options for client-side certificates, CERT_REQUEST and CERT_REQUIRE, both of which request a certificate. I found the place in the source that uses these constants, and if one sets the value to 0 (unexposed via in the api) a certificate won't be requested. 

The least intrusive change was to spoof CERT_REQUEST=0 in the notebook run script. This finally gets rid of that dialog that's been haunting me for almost a year now (was there with the other java 3d viewers as well).
