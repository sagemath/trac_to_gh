The following test fails in 2.8.15.alpha1:

```
            sage: v = QQbar.zeta(3) + 1
            sage: v.exactify()
            sage: v.abs().minpoly()
```
but the attached patch fixes it.

**Attachment:** [1356.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1356/1356.patch.gz)

Now:

```
sage: v = QQbar.zeta(3) + 1
sage: v.exactify()
sage: v.abs().minpoly()
x - 1
```
