this is *only* a documentation addition -- no code, so should be easy to referee.

If the second hunk fails, no problem.  That's not relevant.  Only the first big
hunk is.

Looks good to me.  

To apply: Attempt to apply the patch as usual.  Ignore the error message:

```
Hunk #2 FAILED at 127
1 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/plot/plot.py.rej
abort: patch failed to apply
```

Then do `hg_sage.ci()`, to check in the half-applied patch.
