David,

what is the status here? It seems that your website does contain the code.

Cheers,

Yes it does, but it doesn't have tuning code and I don't have time to work on it now. Without proper tuning it is just as likely to make things slower.

I think this code has been integrated (somehow) into NTL 6.0.
So #14876 should supercede this.
