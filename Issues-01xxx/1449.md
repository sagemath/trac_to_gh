You're right.  And this is especially bad since right now on a Mac
"shift enter" doesn't work.   I can't believe we missed this, given that
so many Sage developers (like me) work on Macs!

I think the fix will be to make it so "shift return" does work on macs,
in addition to "shift enter".  This will make the documentation stay
uniform (but we'll also mention shift-enter in the docs).
