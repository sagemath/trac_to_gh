How works completion?


```
P.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ); P.completion?
```


tells me

```
File:        /opt/sage/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring.py
Type:        <type 'instancemethod'>
Definition:  P.completion(p, prec, extras)
Docstring: 
x.__init__(...) initializes x; see x.__class__.__doc__ for signature
```


what's the p and examples are missing...

Component: **doctest coverage**
