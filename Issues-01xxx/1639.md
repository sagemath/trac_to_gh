How works completion?


```
P.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ); P.completion?
```


tells me

```
File:        /opt/sage/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring.py
Type:        <type 'instancemethod'>
Definition:  P.completion(p, prec, extras)
Docstring: 
x.__init__(...) initializes x; see x.__class__.__doc__ for signature
```


what's the p and examples are missing...

<a id='comment:3'>**Comment 3:**</a>
The attached patch adds docstring and tests.

This ticket should perhaps be kept open in another form so that someone could implement the completion function for irreducuble polynomials other than just x.  I am happy to be the owner of that.
