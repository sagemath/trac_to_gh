Reported by Harald Schilly:

Here what I've tried (documentation does it a bit more "difficult",
but should be the same -- at least I hope so)
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/html/const/node37.html

C = HammingCode(2,GF(5))
v = matrix(GF(5),[This is the Trac macro *1,0,0,2,1,0* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1,0,0,2,1,0-macro))
C.decode(v)

works (at least no errors), but

v = vector(GF(5),[1,0,0,2,1,0])
C.decode(v)

says:

TypeError: Gap produced error output
Permutation: <expr> must be a positive integer (not a integer)
executing $sage333:=(1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0);;

I can see the different braces in the output, but internally a 1xn/nx1
matrix should handled in some way the same as a vector.
