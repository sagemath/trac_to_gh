}
```
I think we should use this syntax for integration:

```
>>> integrate(x**3, (x, -1, 1))
0
>>> integrate(sin(x), (x, 0, pi/2))
1
>>> integrate(cos(x), (x, -pi/2, pi/2))
2
```

instead of

```
sage: integral(x/(x^2+1), x, 0, 1)
     log(2)/2
```

as in SAGE currently, to be close to Mathematica. Because then you can
use the syntax:

integrate(cos(x*y), (x, -pi/2, pi/2), (y, 0, pi))

for multiple integrals.

See also [1], how we discussed this in SymPy.

I changed this to sage-2.9, since it will be very easy to implement.

This probably goes without saying, but presumably after the change one
will still be able to use the syntax 'integrate(sin(x),x) ' for
indefinite integration?  That is, the second argument may be a triple
or a symbol?

This will break backward compatibility in a massive way, so I would suggest setting it to "won't fix".

Well, I haven't replied here when you suggested won't fix, as I was thinking about this.

I understand that breaking code is bad.

But still consistency is consistency. There are ways to improve the API in a non compatible way, e.g. introduce both versions and raise python warning for the old API. and after couple releases, remove it.

Also this was agreed on the sage-devel, so if you seek a different conclusion, you should (imho) advocate that on the list.

```

The docstring for `sage.misc.functional.integrate()` and `sage.symbolic.integration.integral.integral()` contains plenty of doctests to test the tuple syntax.

Further discussion on
* implementing multiple integrals with `integrate(cos(x*y), (x, -pi/2, pi/2), (y, 0, pi))` and
* replacing the examples in the docstrings with the tuple syntax and deprecating the old one
can be continued in #2787.
