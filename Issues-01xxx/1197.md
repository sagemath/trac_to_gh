A first solid version of this is now done, due to work of Ralf PW, John Cremona, and myself. 

A patch bundle that applies cleanly and the corresponding spkg are both available here:

    http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/cremona/

The wrapper code now has 100% doctest coverage, is structured correctly, and provides some useful functionality.  

Component: **modular forms**
