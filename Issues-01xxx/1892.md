Upload it then access it by typing

open(DATA + 'chapitre.1.txt').read()

This DATA variable is documented in line three if you click on the Help button
in the upper right of the worksheet.  It would also be good if it appeared any
time you upload a file in the confirmation message -- it doesn't right now.  I'll
make a ticket to add this (which will be very easy).
