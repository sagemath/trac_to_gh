There is no built in function, but we can write one easily:

def pnorm(v, p):
      return sum([a^p for a in v])^(1/p)


Then:

sage: pnorm(vector([1,2,3]), 5)
276^(1/5)
sage: pnorm(vector(RDF, [1,2,3]), 5)
3.07738488539
sage: var('a b c d p')
sage: pnorm(vector([a, b, c, d]), p)
(d^p + c^p + b^p + a^p)^(1/p)

I agree that matrix norms are important.  However, unlike the case of vectors, where the p-norm is rather universally agreed upon, there are a bunch of different definitions for norms on matrices, see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm
There are at least 3 different things denoted as p-norm there.

I think it's important for us to do this, but trickier than the vector case, so I've made it into track #1763.

In the meantime, it would be great if someone reviewed the current patch.
