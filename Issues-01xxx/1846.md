Consider

```
log(a*e^(-a*x-b)).simplify_exp()
```

This gets expanded correctly, however

```
log(a*e^(-a*x-b)/(1+exp(-a*x-b))^2 ).simplify_exp()
```
appears to lose the minus signs on ax and b.

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
Actually Sage is right and you are wrong, because of the identity `log(e^(-a*x - b) + 1) == log(e^(a*x + b) + 1) - a*x - b` which one can derive from Taylor expansions of `log(x+1)` and `log(x^(-1) + 1)`.  See below. 


```
h = log(exp(-a*x-b) + 1)
```

```
h == h.simplify_exp()
///
log(e^(-a*x - b) + 1) == log(e^(a*x + b) + 1) - a*x - b
```

```
log(x+1).taylor(x,0,5)
///
x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + x^5/5
```

```
log(x^(-1)+1).taylor(x,0,5)
///
-log(x) + x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + x^5/5
```
