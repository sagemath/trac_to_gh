It seems not possible to create a functional variable in SAGE. This gives strange things:

```
sage: var('f');
sage: f(x)
x
```
Ideally one should be able to do the following, to compute the formal derivative of f(g(x)):

```
sage: var('f,g');
sage: diff(f(g(x)), x)
```
(Currently this gives 1 due to the above strange simplification f(x) -> x.)

Use function, as mentioned above:

```
sage: function('f, g')
(f, g)
sage: diff(f(g(x)), x)
diff(f(g(x)), x, 1)
```
