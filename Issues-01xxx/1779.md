sage: There was an error installing modified sage library code.

Emacs must have made a temp file .#polynomial_element.pyx. Python screws up on hashing this; the string should be sanitized in some way, I suppose; however, we do not need to be hashing the timestamp on hidden .pyx files.

Patch looks good to me. It seems unlikely that anybody would add legitimate Cython files that start with a dot.
