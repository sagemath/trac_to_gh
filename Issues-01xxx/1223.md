On my trusty OSX 10.4 PPC 1.4GHz iBook I get the following timeout:

```
michael-abshoffs-ibook-g4:~/Desktop/sage-2.8.13.rc0 mabshoff$ ./sage -
t  devel/sage-main/sage/plot/plot.py
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/plot/plot.py                  *** ***
Error: TIMED OUT! *** ***
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! *** ***
         [269.9 s]
exit code: 256

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/plot/plot.py
Total time for all tests: 269.9 seconds
```
I have seen similar issues on slower Linux boxen, so maybe we should raise the timeout value.

Cheers,

Michael
