first `bison` is required and after installing that, this happens:

```
In file included from ../comp.hpp:9,
                 from ../comp_gb.hpp:6,
                 from lingb.hpp:8,
                 from lingb.cpp:1:
../comp.hpp:7: error: previous declaration of ‘int gbTrace’ with ‘C++’ linkage
../engine.h:1530: error: conflicts with new declaration with ‘C’ linkage
```

This is with `GCC 4.2.3` on 64-bit Debian/testing.

Attached a small patch. The 'extern int gbTrace' in engine.h is in an extern "C" {} block, while 'int gbTrace' is defined in a .cpp file.

Since it doesn't appear to be patched in Macaulay2 svn, attaching a small patch.
