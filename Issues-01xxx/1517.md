Many people have run out of disc space while building Sage. So check in `sage-spkg` if at least K MB are free on the partition we are building Sage in. K should be a couple hundred Megabytes in my opinion ;) We might also print a warning once we go below another, higher threshold. 

Cheers,

Michael

It's not the job of Sage to check filesystem space. Besides, this looks very hard to do in a portable way.
