The spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-2.10.1/rc0/r-2.6.1.p11.spkg

fixed the issue. There is a spkg-check failure, which is now #1936.

Cheers,

Michael

Another updated r.spkg (which is also merged in 2.10.1.rc0) is at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-2.10.1/rc0/r-2.6.1.p12.spkg

It removes the tar.gzs in Recommended and shrinks the spkgs by 3 mb. Once we build the recommended extensions we need to add the tar.gzs back.

Cheers,

Michael
