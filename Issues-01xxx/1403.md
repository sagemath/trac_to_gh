Justin Walker reported:

```
'mwrank' doesn't like it if you just exit (by typing "^D" or, more or  
less equivalently, by "ending a file").

Thus, if you run 'mwrank' and give it a file containing, for example,  
"[0,0,1,-1,0]" and nothing else, it will barf at the end.  If your  
file contains "[0,0,0,0,0]", the program sweetly closes up shop (when  
it reads this) and quits.

The error I get is
   bad ZZ input
   Abort trap

Anyone know why this doesn't show up in the test logs?  Is it worth  
tracking down?

The issue is that the terminating condition for input processing in  
'getcurve()' is a "null curve" (""[0,0,0,0,0]""), rather than EOF.  
An EOF is an error condition, hence the abort(). 
```

See also #1402.

Cheers,

Michael

Hello John,

the release manager usually closes the ticket once the patch has been applied into the current release tree. That way we do not lose fixes.

Cheers,
