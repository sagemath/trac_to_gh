In the public notebook (on www.sagenb.org), when I evaluate a cell with `piecewise?`, I get this:

```
File:        /usr/local/sage-2.6/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/functions/piecewise.py
Type:        <type 'classobj'>
Definition:  piecewise(x0)
Docstring:
```
with no actual docstring.  (Doing the same thing from the command line does give a useful docstring.)

```
[10:09am] was_: It does fail on my ocally-running notebook.
[10:09am] was_: Ipython does the help on the command line.
[10:09am] was_: *I* wrote what does the help in the notebook.
[10:09am] DenisG_: (my locally running notebook)
[10:09am] was_: It's separate code; I think it is is sage/server/support.py or something like that
[10:10am] was_: And there is definitely a bug.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Actually, I don't think anything wrong with the ? or ?? notation.  What was happening was roughly the following:

```
class PiecewisePolynomial:
    def __init__(self, list_of_pairs):
        """docstring"""

    ...

piecewise = PiecewisePolynomial
```

The result of piecewise? was correct since PiecewisePolynomial didn't have a class docstring.
