Build time has increased. On neron, i.e an Ultra III Sparc:

```
real    61m13.083s
user    60m26.070s
sys     0m35.080s

Mike Hansen and I did some more testing and all the following figures are from sage.math:

```
0.3.3:

real    0m51.192s
user    0m46.991s
sys     0m3.044s

2.0 vanilla, i.e. "-O2":

real    31m30.192s
user    30m48.360s
sys     0m35.214s

2.0 "-O0" +pch:

real    4m6.438s
user    3m45.962s
sys     0m15.149s

2.0 "-O0":

real    4m14.650s
user    3m56.743s
sys     0m16.057s

2.0 "-O1":

about 13 minutes
```
Mike Hanson did some benchmarking:  "It looks like O1 is just as fast (and in some cases faster) than O2."

So, "-O1" it ought to be.

Cheers,

Michael
