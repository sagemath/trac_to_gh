If one has a power series over QQ one can coerce it to have coefficients in FF_p using %:

`delta=CuspForms(1,12).0.q_expansion(30)`

`f=CuspForms(11,2).0.q_expansion(30)`

`f % 11`

However, one cannot subtract a series with coefficients in FF_p from a series with coefficients in QQ; the coercion doesn't work:

I strongly agree with this.  However, it might be reasonable to have `Mod(f,11)`
do what f%11 currently does.  

Right now, use f.change_ring

```
sage: R.<q> = QQ[[]]
sage: f = 1 + 19*q^2 + q^4
sage: f.change_ring(GF(13))
1 + 6*q^2 + q^4
```
