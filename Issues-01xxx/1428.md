Hallo!

I tried to compute the SVD of a complex matrix (module
matrix.matrix_complex_double_dense), but I didn't found a function to
do so. However, real matrices (module matrix.matrix_real_double_dense)
support it. Is there really no way to compute a complex SVD? If I
remember correctly, at least the underlying library GSL supports
complex SVDs... What would I have to do to integrate those functions
into Sage?

Basically all that needs to be done is to translate the real code over to the complex case.

The patch looks great. I would suggest making an option that would just return S, instead of the tuple (U,S,V') since people that use this method tend to care more about S than anything else.
