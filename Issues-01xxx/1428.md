Hallo!

I tried to compute the SVD of a complex matrix (module
matrix.matrix_complex_double_dense), but I didn't found a function to
do so. However, real matrices (module matrix.matrix_real_double_dense)
support it. Is there really no way to compute a complex SVD? If I
remember correctly, at least the underlying library GSL supports
complex SVDs... What would I have to do to integrate those functions
into Sage?

Sander
```

Basically all that needs to be done is to translate the real code over to the complex case.
