To fix trac #1083, I added a workaround due to a bug in Pari. The code is fixed in their svn version, but it's unlikely that we'll see a new release terribly soon. However, when one comes along, someone should go to sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py and undo the following patch:

```
-        g = self.__rnf.rnfeltabstorel(pari(f))
+        if self.__K.degree() == 1:
+            g = -1*self.__rnf[0][0]*f[1] + f[0]
+        else:
+            g = self.__rnf.rnfeltabstorel(pari(f))
```
Or, if whoever is updating the pari spkg sends me an email, I'll take care of this.

Is this already fixed?  According to

./rings/number_field/number_field_rel.py:        poly_xy = self.pari_rnf().rnfeltabstorel( self(element)._pari_() )

But I don't see nearby code similar to that in the description.  However, I'm definitely not an expert.
