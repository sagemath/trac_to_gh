To fix trac #1083, I added a workaround due to a bug in Pari. The code is fixed in their svn version, but it's unlikely that we'll see a new release terribly soon. However, when one comes along, someone should go to sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py and undo the following patch:

```
-        g = self.__rnf.rnfeltabstorel(pari(f))
+        if self.__K.degree() == 1:
+            g = -1*self.__rnf[0][0]*f[1] + f[0]
+        else:
+            g = self.__rnf.rnfeltabstorel(pari(f))
```
Or, if whoever is updating the pari spkg sends me an email, I'll take care of this.

Is this already fixed?  According to

```sh
$ grep rnfeltabstorel `find -name \*.py\*`
./libs/pari/gen.pyx:    def rnfeltabstorel(self, x):
./rings/number_field/number_field_rel.py:        poly_xy = self.pari_rnf().rnfeltabstorel( self(element)._pari_() )
./rings/number_field/maps.py:        g = self.__rnf.rnfeltabstorel(pari(f))
```
But I don't see nearby code similar to that in the description.  However, I'm definitely not an expert.

Well, the workaround is for the case where the degree of the relative number field is one, and it's definitely still present -- several of us fought with that code just a few weeks ago. So I think we still need this ticket.
