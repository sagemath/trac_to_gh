With 2.8.10.alpha1 every file that includes decl.pxi cython emits the following warnings:

```
warning: /tmp/Work-mabshoff/sage-2.8.10.alpha1/devel/sage-main/sage/libs/ntl/decl.pxi:33:18: Function signature does not match previous declaration
warning: /tmp/Work-mabshoff/sage-2.8.10.alpha1/devel/sage-main/sage/libs/ntl/decl.pxi:34:18: Function signature does not match previous declaration
warning: /tmp/Work-mabshoff/sage-2.8.10.alpha1/devel/sage-main/sage/libs/ntl/decl.pxi:244:27: Function signature does not match previous declaration
```
