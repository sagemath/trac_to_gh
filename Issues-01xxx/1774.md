I just received this off-list from Bill Alombert:

```
As you much probably already now, we released PARI/GP 2.3.3 in December.

Furthermore, I started to review the GP script for SEA and we fixed
several problems that could lead to wrong results being returned,
so I would suggest you update the copy in SAGE to the current CVS
version of SEA.
