The polybori wrapper initializes m4ri by building some tables, but this is not freed on exit. As polybori is now imported from top level, this shows up as still reachable memory on valgrind for every sage session.

The bundle attached fixes this, along with a minor modification to remove a workaround for a polybori bug which is now fixed.
