I very much agree that the problem below is a bug, which we should resolve. 

```
subs and substitute are not equivalent for single variable
polynomials,
though they are in the field of fractions or for polynomials in more
than
one variable:

Review and questions:

If this is just an alias would it not be simpler to just put

```
    substitute = subs
```
in the class definition instead of defining a second function which calls the first?

Secondly, for some reason the patch posted does not display in the normal way, but I don't know why.

I don't really know enough about the issues raised by  jbmohler  to judge this solution;  but if this does solve the problem then the simple assignment I suggested would also!

Not literally,  but after the assignment they are the `__same__` function so the docstring for one is displayed for both.  For example, `prime_factors` is a synonym for `prime_divisors`, and look:

```
sage: n=123
sage: n.prime_factors?
Type:           builtin_function_or_method
Base Class:     <type 'builtin_function_or_method'>
String Form:    <built-in method prime_divisors of sage.rings.integer.Integer object at 0xa124980>
Namespace:      Interactive
Docstring:

            The prime divisors of self, sorted in increasing order.  If n
            is negative, we do *not* include -1 among the prime divisors, since -1 is
            not a prime number.

            EXAMPLES:
                sage: a = 1; a.prime_divisors()
                []
                sage: a = 100; a.prime_divisors()
                [2, 5]
                sage: a = -100; a.prime_divisors()
                [2, 5]
                sage: a = 2004; a.prime_divisors()
                [2, 3, 167]
```
Although that looks slightly strange, I think it is ok, especially if the docstring mentions the synonym (which in this case it does not, which is my fault since I inserted the synonym while no-one was looking).
