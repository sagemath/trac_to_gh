I very much agree that the problem below is a bug, which we should resolve. 

```
subs and substitute are not equivalent for single variable
polynomials,
though they are in the field of fractions or for polynomials in more
than
one variable:

Attachment: **[redef_substi.changeset.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1440/redef_substi.changeset.gz)**

Review and questions:

If this is just an alias would it not be simpler to just put

```
    substitute = subs
```
in the class definition instead of defining a second function which calls the first?

Secondly, for some reason the patch posted does not display in the normal way, but I don't know why.

I don't really know enough about the issues raised by  jbmohler  to judge this solution;  but if this does solve the problem then the simple assignment I suggested would also!

Replying to [@sagetrac-broune](#comment%3A5):
> Is it possible to attach a docstring if the function is written using an assignment? Otherwise you would get no docstring, or possibly the docstring for subs, upon calling help on subtitute.

Not literally,  but after the assignment they are the `__same__` function so the docstring for one is displayed for both.  For example, `prime_factors` is a synonym for `prime_divisors`, and look:

```
sage: n=123
sage: n.prime_factors?
Type:           builtin_function_or_method
Base Class:     <type 'builtin_function_or_method'>
String Form:    <built-in method prime_divisors of sage.rings.integer.Integer object at 0xa124980>
Namespace:      Interactive
Docstring:

            The prime divisors of self, sorted in increasing order.  If n
            is negative, we do *not* include -1 among the prime divisors, since -1 is
            not a prime number.

            EXAMPLES:
                sage: a = 1; a.prime_divisors()
                []
                sage: a = 100; a.prime_divisors()
                [2, 5]
                sage: a = -100; a.prime_divisors()
                [2, 5]
                sage: a = 2004; a.prime_divisors()
                [2, 3, 167]
```
Although that looks slightly strange, I think it is ok, especially if the docstring mentions the synonym (which in this case it does not, which is my fault since I inserted the synonym while no-one was looking).
