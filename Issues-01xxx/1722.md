Against my 2.10.2.alpha0 I get a reject:

```
patch -p1 --dry-run < trac_1722.patch
patching file sage/matrix/matrix_symbolic_dense.pxd
patching file sage/matrix/matrix_symbolic_dense.pyx
Hunk #1 succeeded at 15 with fuzz 2 (offset 9 lines).
Hunk #2 succeeded at 48 with fuzz 2 (offset 8 lines).
Hunk #3 succeeded at 536 (offset 248 lines).
Hunk #4 FAILED at 617.
Hunk #5 FAILED at 681.
2 out of 5 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/matrix/matrix_symbolic_dense.pyx.rej
```
The patch should be rebased against 2.10.2.alpha0 once it is out.

Cheers,

Michael
