Against my 2.10.2.alpha0 I get a reject:

```
patch -p1 --dry-run < trac_1722.patch

Hunk #1 succeeded at 15 with fuzz 2 (offset 9 lines).
Hunk #2 succeeded at 48 with fuzz 2 (offset 8 lines).

2 out of 5 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/matrix/matrix_symbolic_dense.pyx.rej

The patch should be rebased against 2.10.2.alpha0 once it is out.
