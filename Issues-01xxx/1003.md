Carl Witty reported:

```
On my 32-bit linux box, I had an additional failure:
 **********************************************************************
File "finite_field_element.py", line 18:
    sage: c = a^e
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):

      File "<doctest __main__.example_0[9]>", line 1, in <module>
        c = a**e###line 18:
