1. It should say "Moin Moin wiki with math typesetting".

```
Tombo:tmp was$ sage -wiki
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| SAGE Version 2.8.10, Release Date: 2007-10-28                      |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Please wait while the SAGE Notebook server starts...

```

2. Spam filtering should be on by default and anon access off.
I.e., the wikiconfig file *should* look like the attached one.
