On a linux box the function setlocale in locale.py sometimes files for some weird locals, which breaks matplotlib.   We patch the python spkg so instead of giving an error in that case, it just uses the default locale. 

NOTE: This might be hackish -- probably the right fix would be to somehow change matplotlib.

<a id='comment:3'></a>The updated spkg is at 

  http://sagemath.org/packages/standard/python-2.5.1.p11.spkg

If you just do "sage -upgrade" before making the next version of Sage,
you'll get this fixed package.
