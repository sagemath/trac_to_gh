The issue was a memory management one. In general, whenever a pari GEN is allocated, if we want it to be preserved, there ultimately has to be *some* python object pointing to it somewhere. What would happen in this case is that x[0][0] = 500 became x.__getitem__(0).__setitem__(0,500), and the return value from x.__getitem__(0) would store a pointer to the GEN containing 500. However, after the `__setitem__` was finished, the object returned by `__getitem__` was deallocated, and thus our GEN no longer had any python object pointing to it, and it was itself deallocated. \n\nSo, ultimately, we need to do a bit more memory management. Here's the fix I implemented (which came out of some conversation with Carl Witty during Bug Day ... 7?), and which is really just a more complete version of something already in place. Namely, pari gens sometimes have a _refers_to dictionary, which in the case of a t_VEC or t_MAT, stores references to the gens pointing to the GENs stored there. I've mostly just beefed up this system. \n\nI added two new fields, _GEN_owner and _owner_set. The idea is this: any time you create a gen that's not the only gen pointing to its GEN, we need to make sure that everyone knows when that GEN gets updated. So when we create a gen that's not the unique one pointing to its GEN, we set its _owner_set to 1, and _GEN_owner to the other gen pointing to its GEN. \n\nSince that reads like something out of \"Who's on First,\" let's give an example: we'll pretend for a moment that _owner_set, _GEN_owner, and _refers_to are def'd instead of cdef'd, and give a mock sage session explaining an example:\n\n```\nsage: x = pari([0,1,2])\nsage: x._owner_set\n0\nsage: x._refers_to\n{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2}\nsage: y = pari([3,4])\nsage: y._owner_set \n0\nsage: x[0] = y ; x\n[[3, 4], 1, 2]\nsage: x[0]._owner_set\n1\nsage: x[0] is y\nFalse\nsage: x[0]._GEN_owner is y\nTrue\nsage: x[0][0] = 123 ; x\n[[123, 4], 1, 2]\nsage: y\n[123, 4]\n```\n\nSo this does what we want. There's one somewhat frustrating thing that can happen, though. In the above example, we're allocating each element of the list, so our _refers_to gets set just as we'd like. However, it's possible that not every GEN has a gen pointing to it. That is:\n\n```\nsage: x = pari(\"[[1,2],3,4]\") ; x._refers_to\n{}\n```\n\nThis is annoying for us -- it means that we don't have our reference tracking working with such an object until the user tries to refer to a piece of it.

There's an old bug in the `__setitem__` code for pari gen objects:

```
x = pari("[[1,2],3]") ; x[0][0] = 500 ; x
```

would give you back a list with nonsense where the 500 should go. The issue was a memory management one. In general, whenever a pari GEN is allocated, if we want it to be preserved, there ultimately has to be *some* python object pointing to it somewhere. What would happen in this case is that x[0][0] = 500 became x.__getitem__(0).__setitem__(0,500), and the return value from x.__getitem__(0) would store a pointer to the GEN containing 500. However, after the `__setitem__` was finished, the object returned by `__getitem__` was deallocated, and thus our GEN no longer had any python object pointing to it, and it was itself deallocated. 

So, ultimately, we need to do a bit more memory management. Here's the fix I implemented (which came out of some conversation with Carl Witty during Bug Day ... 7?), and which is really just a more complete version of something already in place. Namely, pari gens sometimes have a _refers_to dictionary, which in the case of a t_VEC or t_MAT, stores references to the gens pointing to the GENs stored there. I've mostly just beefed up this system. 

I added two new fields, _GEN_owner and _owner_set. The idea is this: any time you create a gen that's not the only gen pointing to its GEN, we need to make sure that everyone knows when that GEN gets updated. So when we create a gen that's not the unique one pointing to its GEN, we set its _owner_set to 1, and _GEN_owner to the other gen pointing to its GEN. 

Since that reads like something out of "Who's on First," let's give an example: we'll pretend for a moment that _owner_set, _GEN_owner, and _refers_to are def'd instead of cdef'd, and give a mock sage session explaining an example:

```
sage: x = pari([0,1,2])
sage: x._owner_set
0
sage: x._refers_to
{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2}
sage: y = pari([3,4])
sage: y._owner_set 
0
sage: x[0] = y ; x
[[3, 4], 1, 2]
sage: x[0]._owner_set
1
sage: x[0] is y
False
sage: x[0]._GEN_owner is y
True
sage: x[0][0] = 123 ; x
[[123, 4], 1, 2]
sage: y
[123, 4]
```

So this does what we want. There's one somewhat frustrating thing that can happen, though. In the above example, we're allocating each element of the list, so our _refers_to gets set just as we'd like. However, it's possible that not every GEN has a gen pointing to it. That is:

```
sage: x = pari("[[1,2],3,4]") ; x._refers_to
{}
```

This is annoying for us -- it means that we don't have our reference tracking working with such an object until the user tries to refer to a piece of it. So, when you try to create a new_ref to an object, and it's never been referenced before, we first make and store a reference to it as we would have done at allocation.

While I was doing this, I sped up pari coercion a bit here and there ... here's two examples:

Before:

```
sage: ls = [2,3]

sage: time for _ in range(100000): x = pari(ls)
CPU times: user 4.84 s, sys: 1.05 s, total: 5.89 s
Wall time: 6.40

sage: foo = True

sage: time for _ in range(100000): x = pari(foo)
CPU times: user 1.25 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 1.26 s
Wall time: 1.35
```

After:

```
sage: ls = [2,3]

sage: time for _ in range(100000): x = pari(ls)
CPU times: user 2.56 s, sys: 0.89 s, total: 3.45 s
Wall time: 3.90

sage: foo = True

sage: time for _ in range(100000): x = pari(foo)
CPU times: user 0.73 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.73 s
Wall time: 0.80
```

I think I understand what this patch is doing.  It seems excessively complicated and possibly broken.

1) Sometimes _GEN_owner refers to another gen with the same value as self; sometimes it refers to another gen (a matrix or vector) such that self is an element of _GEN_owner.  This is quite confusing.

I think the latter case is the only important case; then _GEN_owner should be renamed to _GEN_parent.

In the former case, instead of creating multiple gen elements with the same value, and setting _GEN_owner, it should just use the original gen.  So:

```
                    return P.new_ref((<gen>x).g,x)
```
would become

```
                    return x
```

2) There need to be more comments describing these fields.

3) (less important): It seems that ._owner_set is true iff ._GEN_owner is not None; I recommend removing this field and just checking ._GEN_owner (or, in the rewritten patch, ._GEN_parent), to save memory at a (probably) negligible cost in time.
