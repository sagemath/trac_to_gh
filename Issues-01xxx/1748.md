From the thread in gg:sage-devel: Enthought mayavi2 as a library

```
My question: Is there a better way to pass the argument "-wthread" to ipython?
And than run the real sage.

What I do is a kind of cheating: ipython comes back with the prompt
sage:

So it looks like sage but it isn't.

Jaap

```


```
Yes, the issue is really that I explained myself poorly to Jaap.  He's running

import IPython
IPython.Shell.IPShellWX().mainloop()

Inside an already started Sage session.  But at the exit of that
mainloop(), ipython will tear down the threading support (absolutely
necessary for WX to work without blocking the interactive console).
That mainloop is hooked into the WX event loop, so it can't really be
restarted.

The solution is to have Sage start ipython with the wthread option, if
you want full Sage support.  As a starter, you can test this. Make a
little file that's simply

#!/path/to/sage/python
import IPython
IPython.Shell.IPShellWX().mainloop()


make it executable, and run it *standalone* in a sage-sh configured
shell.  This standalone ipython is equivalent to running

ipython -wthread

and will simply exit at the end.  If that works and closes without
crashing, then someone more familiar than myself with how sage starts
itself can then offer an option for sage to fire up ipython with
'-wthread' at startup.  This will ensure that the threads cleanup only
happens when sage itself exits, not in the middle of the enclosing
Sage session.

My originally incomplete explanation led Jaap to have a main event
loop inside another one.  That's always bad news.

I hope this is now clearer.

Cheers,

f

```

This worked for me.
