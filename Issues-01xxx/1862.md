Here's how do this sort of thing using contour_plot in sage right now.
(Note -- for efficiency reasons, you definitely want to only plot a Python
function -- i.e., lambda -- at present.  This will change soon.)

First, define this function in Sage:

def implicit_plot(f, x_range, y_range, plot_points=100):
      return contour_plot(f, x_range, y_range, fill=False, contours=1, plot_points=plot_points)

Then use it:

sage: implicit_plot(lambda x,y: x^2 + y^2 - 1, (-2,2), (-2,2))
sage: implicit_plot(lambda x,y: x^3 + x*y^2 - 1, (-2,2), (-2,2))
sage: implicit_plot(lambda x,y: (x-y^2)*(y-x^3), (-2,2), (-2,2))

The input should be a function f of two variables, and implicit_plot as I've
defined it above graphs f(x,y) == 0 in the given region.

This could be turned into a first version of a genuine implicit plot at some point. 

Josh Kantor is also looking into some other more sophisticated related
approaches.    It would be good to understand precisely how Sage's
contour_plot function works (it builds mostly on matplotlib's functions)....

I just refereed that patch and I can't find any implicit_plot functionality in it...

Some problems:

```
sage: x,y=var("x,y")
sage: implicit_plot(x^2+y^2-1,(-1,1),(-1,1))
```
takes a very long time (in fact, I tried to kill it using ctl-c repeatedly and had a hard time).
On the other hand,

```
sage: f = lambda x,y: x^2+y^2-1
sage: implicit_plot(f,(-1,1),(-1,1))
```
is almost instantaneous.
Can this be fixed or at least documented?

This should be trivial to fix by changing implicit_plot to call fast_float.  In fact, then the relevant part of your first example would be 10 times faster than the second.
