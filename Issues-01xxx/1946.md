I'm sure -- after a bit of a glance, for example, at scale_curve,
that lots of this code is broken as a result of having no doctests!

Attachment [8089.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket1946/8089.patch) by @JohnCremona created at 2008-01-28 06:32:09

Lots of doctests for elliptic curves with many bug fixes for bugs revealed by them.

Several new functions for changing models:  thought still needed on how to return the isomorphism as well as the new model;  if not Magma style then by storing the map as an attribute of the new curve as is done for number fields?

Joint work by John Cremona and William Stein.

The previous patch left some failing doctests in number_field_ideal_rel.py.
This patch 8090.patch fixed those with some substantial reworking of the classes NumberFieldIdeal, NumberFieldFractionalIdeal and NumberFieldFractionalIdeal_rel. 

Please would people with experience of the elliptic curve classes review 8089.patch and someone who knows the number field code review 8090.patch (which should be applied after 8089.patch.

By the way, I have checked all doctest in both number_field/ and elliptic_curve/ directories (and have added lots to these), and also the doc and const directories (where a couple of changes were needed).

REFEREE REPORT:

1. I applied both patches to sage-2.10.1.alpha0.  There is one rejected hunk
in the second patch (8090.patch).  I replaced 8090.patch by one that works without
any problems.

2. After applying both patches all doctests in elliptic curves and number fields pass. 

3. I fixed a number of formating issues with the new docstrings. See the third patch 3.

4. This patch rocks!  It is a major significant contribution to improving the doctest coverage and quality of the sage elliptic curve code. Very positive review.

Even that bundle does not apply cleanly against my 2.10.2.a1 or 2.10.2.a2. It looks like a whole bunch of trivial, white space related rejects. One exception is the fixed doctest, but that is easy to fix.

Cheers,

Michael
