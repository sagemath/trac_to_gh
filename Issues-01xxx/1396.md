> e.g. Singular supports `redTail` and such. We should provide a somewhat unified interface for those (probably modelled after whatever Singular provides).


I have a version of this going now, with the behavior similar to what the ticket requests. However, would it be more desirable to allow the user's options to persist through several operations, using an interface such as (say)

* `I.set_singular_option("lazy"); I.groebner_basis()`

rather than add arguments only to the Groebner basis command, such as

* `I.groebner_basis(lazy=True)`

Replying to [john_perry](#comment%3A3):

That stuff somewhat works already:

```
sage: singular.option('lazy')
sage: singular.option()
//options: lazy redefine loadLib usage prompt
```

The point of this ticket is that the user can be ignorant of the fact that (s)he is running Singular in the background and can specify options for a particular GB computation.

<a id='comment:7'></a>
This patch extends Martin's work on libSingular options. Now, the options `degBound` and `multBound` can be used. A decorator, applied to all relevant methods, ensures that standard options are used unless explicitly requested by setting named arguments -- even if outside the methods other options are set.

The options can be named in Python style (deg_bound) or in Singular style (`degBound`), at the user's choice.

Examples:

1. Degree bound

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: I = R*[x^3+y^2,x^2*y+1]
sage: from sage.libs.singular.option import opt
# Use prot and deg_bound
sage: I.groebner_basis(prot=True, deg_bound=2)
std in (0),(x,y),(dp(2),C)
[4294967295:2]3ss
(S:1)-
product criterion:0 chain criterion:0
[x^3 + y^2, x^2*y + 1]

# Set prot and degBound outside the method
sage: opt['prot'] = True
# Singular style name
sage: opt['degBound'] = 2
# ... but inside the method, standard options are used:
sage: I.groebner_basis()
[x^3 + y^2, x^2*y + 1, y^3 - x]
sage: opt['prot']
True
# Python style name
sage: opt['deg_bound']
2

# similarly in Singular, rather than libSingular
sage: I.groebner_basis(algorithm='singular',deg_bound=2)
[x^3 + y^2, x^2*y + 1]
sage: singular.eval('degBound=2')
'degBound=2;'
sage: I.groebner_basis(algorithm='singular')
[x^3 + y^2, x^2*y + 1, y^3 - x]
sage: singular.eval('degBound')
'2'
```

2. Multiplicity bound

```
sage: Rlocal.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ, order='ds')
sage: J = [x^7+y^7+z^6,x^6+y^8+z^7,x^7+y^5+z^8, x^2*y^3+y^2*z^3+x^3*z^2,x^3*y^2+y^3*z^2+x^2*z^3]*Rlocal

# Set the multBound in Singular
sage: singular.eval('multBound=100')
'multBound=100;'
# ... nevertheless, the default multBound=0 is used:
sage: J.groebner_basis(algorithm='singular')

sage: singular.eval('multBound')
'100'
# ... unless requested otherwise
sage: J.groebner_basis(algorithm='singular',mult_bound=100)
[x^3*y^2 + y^3*z^2 + x^2*z^3, x^2*y^3 + x^3*z^2 + y^2*z^3, y^5, x^6 + x*y^4*z^5, x^4*z^2 - y^4*z^2 - x^2*y*z^3 + x*y^2*z^3, z^6 - x*y^4*z^4 - x^3*y*z^5]
```

I just verified that `sage -testall` passes. So, ready for review!

One remark: It turned out to be impossible to doctest `libSingular's` protocol output. I inserted examples with protocol in the documentation, for illustration, but don't test these. Of course, deg_bound and mult_bound is doctested.

Backing out the patch does allow Sage to start on t2.math, so for 4.5.2, I'm going to yank this patch, and open another ticket; this patch can go back in, along with the necessary spkg, in the next release. Sorry.

We don't have an "unmerged in:" field, but this patch is getting "unmerged" in 4.5.2.alpha1.

Should it not be set back to "needs work" then? That seems the most accurate description of the status - more accurate so than "fixed".
