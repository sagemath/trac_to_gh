```
If you create an n x m matrix over ZZ in sage with n > m, then 
run the LLL algorithm on it (fplll), Sage completely terminates.

```
sage: A = random_matrix(ZZ, 15, 10)
sage: A.LLL()
Ill-formed matrix  : d>n
bsd:~ was$ 
```

Possible Solutions:
1. trap bad conditions somewhere and raise an exception.

2. Just immediately give an error in the A.LLL function if A is nonsquare (instead of letting fplll do this
 
3. Put an error in the fplll wrapper code in libs/fplll

Component: **linear algebra**

I installed the new spkg (on 32-bit x86 Linux).  The test in the bug report no longer crashes, and doctests in fplll.pyx and matrix_integer_dense.pyx still pass.

I did not apply the attached patch, and I don't think we should apply it... as Damien points out, that case is not actually invalid.

In short, the spkg looks good to me.
