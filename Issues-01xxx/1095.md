I made a silly mistake when I was editing sage-coverage -- it will always tell you that a function is "possibly wrong" (i.e. function name doesn't occur in doctest) when there is no doctest; this is pretty obvious. This patch fixes it, so that now things only appear in the "possibly wrong" list if they *don't* appear in either of the other lists (missing documentation or missing doctests).
