This is a small error that is embarrasingly old. This patch solves the problem. You can use a generator name and the preparser in all combinations.

- I have added a default name for the generator 'a' to be consistent with NumberField.

- I have documented the behaviour of Sage when QuadraticField and NumberField are given two generators but there is a conflict in their names. The generator name given by the preparser has precedence in this case.
