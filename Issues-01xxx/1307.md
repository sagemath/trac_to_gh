I believe that database just contains the data that is exposed here:

http://good.math.iastate.edu/grout/graphs/

You can download one of the many SQLITE GUI tools listed at http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=ManagementTools and look at the database.

Is there anything more efficient, in case the users needs to enumerate them all ?
