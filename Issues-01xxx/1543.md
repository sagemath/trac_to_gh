Again, the title says it all -- on some systems (like mine), tail -1 produces an error (since this is supposedly "deprecated" behavior), recommending that the user use tail -n 1 instead. rpy fails after that; fixing this, everything works fine. I've added one more file to the patches/ directory, and one more line to the spkg-install (namely, copying that file over).
