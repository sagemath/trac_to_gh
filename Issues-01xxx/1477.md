No, more likely I'm missing something in how that functionality
was implemened.  You're probably one of the first ever Russian uses of 
Sage, and we have had very little testing of Unicode in Sage. 
Hopefully fixing the above is for developers just a 
matter of changing a few lines in 

  SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/server/noteboook

that relate to loading and saving the file worksheet.txt.

To be correct, they're replaced by "non-browser"  unicode codes (like
%u0440 instead of &#x0440; )

> (2) Using edit mode, unicode not in {{{}}}'s gets saved just fine.

Yes, as they are NOT processed (as I understand) and get saved "as
is".

Thanks, can be helpful when writing my materials.

Sage's support for Unicode and UTF-8 in the notebook is `_awful_`.  It will take a bit of work to fix this.  For starters, we should be using encodeURIComponent in the Javascript instead of escape since escape fails miserably for non-ASCII characters.

I'll look into this more once the templating is done.  There's too many strings floating as it is.
