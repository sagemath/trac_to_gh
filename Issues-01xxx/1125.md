That's because you're using gfortran.  Evidently Josh's fix for cvxopt not fully working
fails for people using gfortran.  I'll open a trac ticket.

This either has to be properly fixed, or cvxopt has to be removed or something.
We need to make sure we fully support using gfortran.  Perhaps we should just
completely switch to using gfortran and make having gfortran installed a requirement for building sage.  Tempting.
