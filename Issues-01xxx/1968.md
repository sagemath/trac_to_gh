Timothy Clemans points out to me in chat a *major* security issue with the notebook.  If a user visits the live tutorial, e.g., 

    https://your_computer:port/doc/live/tut/node5.html

then they can execute code even if they aren't logged in!

This is a major security hole if somebody is running their own notebook server.

Solution: by changing about 2 lines in server/notebook/twist.py, one can change it
so the entire live tutorial is inaccessible accept to users that are logged in.  This should be done.

<a id='comment:2'></a>This seems to work.
Directly visiting the tutorial as above works when logged in but not when logged out
(you get a not found error in the browser).


was: can you clarify that this is the intended effect.
