Timothy Clemans points out to me in chat a *major* security issue with the notebook.  If a user visits the live tutorial, e.g., 

    https://your_computer:port/doc/live/tut/node5.html

then they can execute code even if they aren't logged in!

This is a major security hole if somebody is running their own notebook server.

Solution: by changing about 2 lines in server/notebook/twist.py, one can change it
so the entire live tutorial is inaccessible accept to users that are logged in.  This should be done.

This seems to work.
Directly visiting the tutorial as above works when logged in but not when logged out
(you get a not found error in the browser).


was: can you clarify that this is the intended effect.
