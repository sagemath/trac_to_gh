This patch replaces the wrapper around Gap to give the conjugate partition.  It speeds up the computation quite a bit.

I'd say it's an improvement, but it may be better to avoid code duplication with the following:

```
sage: Partition([3,1]).conjugate()
[2, 1, 1]

With the patch:

```
sage: %timeit partition_associated([6,5,5,4,2,2,1])
100000 loops, best of 3: 9.21 µs per loop
sage: %timeit Partition([6,5,5,4,2,2,1]).conjugate()
10000 loops, best of 3: 154 µs per loop
sage: a=Partition([6,5,5,4,2,2,1])
sage: %timeit a.conjugate()
1000 loops, best of 3: 268 µs per loop
```

So I'll probably delete the partition_associated function and replace the Partition.conjugate() function, if that's all right, and post up another patch.

Some timings after I put my code into partition.py:

```
[15:42] <jason-> sage: a=Partition(sum([[i]*20 for i in range(50,1,-1)],[]))
[15:42] <jason-> sage: print len(a), len(a.conjugate('mike'))
[15:42] <jason-> 980 50
[15:42] <jason-> sage: %timeit a.conjugate('jason')
[15:42] <jason-> 100 loops, best of 3: 3.34 ms per loop
[15:42] <jason-> sage: %timeit a.conjugate('mike')
[15:42] <jason-> 100 loops, best of 3: 3.25 ms per loop
[15:42] <jason-> sage: %timeit a.conjugate('mikeandjason')
[15:42] <jason-> 100 loops, best of 3: 3.05 ms per loop
[15:42] <jason-> sage: a=Partition(sum([[i]*2 for i in range(5000,1,-1)],[]))
[15:42] <jason-> sage: print len(a), len(a.conjugate('mike'))
[15:42] <jason-> 9998 5000
[15:42] <jason-> sage: %timeit a.conjugate('jason')
[15:42] <jason-> 10 loops, best of 3: 246 ms per loop
[15:42] <jason-> sage: %timeit a.conjugate('mike')
[15:42] <jason-> 10 loops, best of 3: 34.8 ms per loop
[15:42] <jason-> sage: %timeit a.conjugate('mikeandjason')
[15:42] <jason-> 10 loops, best of 3: 32.4 ms per loop
[15:42] <jason-> we both win this time.
[15:42] <jason-> 'mikeandjason' is making a few slight modifications to your algorithm (like using .extend instead of +=, etc.)
```

So I'll post a minor patch to Mike's code.

The error apparently has to do with the top-level import in combinat.py:

    from sage.combinat.partition import Partition

When I move the top-level import into the associated_partition function, the failing doctest passes.

Mike, do you know what is going on?
