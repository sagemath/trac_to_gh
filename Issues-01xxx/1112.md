```
the attached patch makes this work:

```
sage: pow(10,20,17)
4
sage: pow?
    pow(x, y[, z]) -> number

    With two arguments, equivalent to x**y.  With three arguments,
    equivalent to (x**y) % z, but may be more efficient (e.g. for longs).
```

this is required such that e.g. the Crypto.RSA module works with SAGE integers.

Component: **basic arithmetic**
