Aha!  Great!

This reminds we that when I started using the notebook interface, it
took me an embarrassingly long time to discover what was meant by the
phrase
'click to the left for traceback'.  I found this message confusing
because there is nothing to the left to click on.  At first I thought
this was a strange way
of saying `left-click'.  Eventually I worked it out by accident.  I
suggest a more verbose message along the lines of
`for traceback, click in the blank area just to the left of this
line'.  Or put something to click on, maybe along the lines of the
brackets in
the mathematica notebook, which has a hierarchical grouping mechanism
whereby groups of cells can be hidden or expanded together.
(Of course maybe sage does too, and I just don't know about it!)

Cheers,

Peter
