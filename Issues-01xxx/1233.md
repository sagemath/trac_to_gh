I found that elliptic curves which are defined by non-minimal equations cause rank() etc to crash or give error messages.  Possibly only when there is 2-torsion.  Since mwrank itself handles the same curves with no problem, there is a problem with the wrapper code.  First here are two examples of what goes wrong:

```
sage: E=mwrank_EllipticCurve([-1323,3942])
sage: E.rank()
Result of shifting the point [36:-108:1] is [1:-1:1] which is not a valid point on its curve [0,0,0,-1323,3942]!
Point [1:-1:1], height = 3.1490443504515297201640615419259554770993208565687 --warning: NOT on curve!

Explanation:   In the stand-alone mwrank binary (run via !mwrank for example) curves are converted to minimal models after input and any points computed are converted back so that the points output are on the input curve (!).  But the Sage wrapper does not so this and everything gets confused.

One solution would be for me to change the mwrank code itself so that the two_descent class itself handled the minimalization.  That would be cleanest, and would not require any changes to the Sage wrapping.  Otherwise, as with Simon's code, we would run up against the fact that currently Sage has no means of changing models and points itself.

So I guess this lands on my own to-do list.

I have changed the mwrank source code so that non-minimal models are now handled properly.  All the work is done on a minimal model, but opints are mapped back to the input model if that is different.

Note that it is not correct to say that this was a Sage-wrapping problem!   The stand-alone mwrank binary used to manage this properly by converting to a minimal model before calling the two_descent class, and the latter just assumed it was being given a minimal model.  The Sage wrapping went straight into the two_descent.  Now, the two_descent class handles this itself (so that the mwrank.cc program has less to do).

I will attach a bundle which corrects this;  it should be possible to apply this to the cremona*.spkg in Sage 2.9.

No, that failed, since it did not recognise the parent.  Help!
