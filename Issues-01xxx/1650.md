This points potentially to another issue in template.h. If I have some more time I will investigate later.

The spkg at #1649 should fix this. But that needs to be verified.

New version that passes spkg-check on OS X as well:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/tmp/eclib-20080127.spkg

I upped the release version number, since Cremona and I made changes
inside the src/ directory (which we dutifully checked in).
