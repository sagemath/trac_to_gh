**Attachment:** [polybori_booleanpolynomial_getattr.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1541/polybori_booleanpolynomial_getattr.patch)

Following Martin's comments on the slowdown caused by using `__getattr__` in `BooleanPolynomial`, attached patch with file name `polybori_booleanpolynomial_getattr.patch` makes the methods directly available.

Some timings (using random polynomials in each case might not be a good idea, but it still demonstrates the point):

Without the patch:

```
sage: P = BooleanPolynomialRing(100,'x')
sage: from polybori.randompoly import gen_random_poly
sage: p = gen_random_poly(int(100))
sage: %timeit s = p.set()
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.85 µs per loop
sage: %timeit d = p.deg()
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.26 µs per loop
sage: %timeit m = p.lead()
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.7 µs per loop
sage: %timeit n = p.navigation()
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.82 µs per loop
sage: %timeit c = p.constant()
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.02 µs per loop
```

With the patch:

```
sage: %timeit s = p.set()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 540 ns per loop
sage: %timeit d = p.deg()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 382 ns per loop
sage: %timeit m = p.lead()
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.76 µs per loop
sage: %timeit n = p.navigation()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 453 ns per loop
sage: %timeit c = p.constant()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 305 ns per loop
```

[attachment:polybori-coercion.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1541/polybori-coercion.patch) provides coercion enhancements and small fixes to `pbori.pyx`. It should be applied after [attachment:polybori_booleanpolynomial_getattr.patch.](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1541/polybori_booleanpolynomial_getattr.patch.)

This patch adds coercion from `ZZ`, and `GF(2)` to `BooleanPolynomialRing`, so Martin's patch needs to be revised.

Merged in Sage 2.10.alpha0. 

Caution: when patching the offset was very large: `Hunk #1 succeeded at 1372 (offset 284 lines).` I did verify that indeed the section was moved that far down in the current sources.  

Cheers,

Michael
