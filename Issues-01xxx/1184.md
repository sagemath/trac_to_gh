Moving a sage install on OSX 10.4 and then upgrading anything that is linked against NTL leads to link errors due to missing gmp symbols. The problem is the link mode with which the dynamic NTL is created. I have a fix, but I am currently verifying that it really fixes the issue. Everything that is linked against NTL needs to be recompiled, i.e. singular and cremona at the moment.

To add to the confusion: This is not an issue on OSX 10.5.

Cheers,

Michael

Attachment: **[Sage-2.8.15.alpha1-twiddle-with-link-order.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1184/Sage-2.8.15.alpha1-twiddle-with-link-order.patch.gz)**

The updated spkg is at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/ntl-5.4.1.p7.spkg

You need to apply both the patch and add the ntl.spkg.

Cheers,

Michael
