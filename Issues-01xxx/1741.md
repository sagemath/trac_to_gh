I have been looking for various problems in zlib that valgrind exposed. Since we do not build with debug info I need to rebuild zlib manually, so fix this in the spkg. An updated spkg with this trivial fix is at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-2.10/alpha1/zlib-1.2.3.p3.spkg

Cheers,
