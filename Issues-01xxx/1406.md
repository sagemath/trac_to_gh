Reducing a polynomial to the libsingular polynomials to GF(p^n) is buggy as the following examples all illustrate. 

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: S.<xx,yy> = GF(5)[]
sage: S(5*x*y + x + 17*y)
0*xx*yy + xx + 2*yy
sage: R.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: S.<xx,yy> = GF(5)[]
sage: R.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: S.<xx,yy> = GF(25,'a')[]
sage: S(5*x*y + x + 17*y)
0*xx*yy + xx + 2*yy
sage: type(S(5*x*y + x + 17*y))
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular'>
sage: R.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: S.<xx,yy> = Integers(5)[]
sage: S(5*x*y + x + 17*y)
xx + 2*yy
```
