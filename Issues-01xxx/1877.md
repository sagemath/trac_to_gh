```
sage: var('x,y')
sage: plot3d(sin(x*y), (x,-1,1), (x,-1,1))
boom!
```

The problem is that both ranges use the variable x.  The fix is to make
sure that the two variables are different and if not raise an exception (do this also in parametric_plot3d).

plot3d and parametric_plot3d should fail a tiny bit more gracefully if they're given two ranges using the same variable:

```
sage: var('x,y')
sage: plot3d(sin(x*y), (x,-1,1), (x,-1,1))
ValueError: If the ranges in the argument of plot3d are 3-tuples, then the first components of those 3-tuples must be different.
sage: var('u,v')
sage: parametric_plot3d((cos(u), sin(u) + cos(v), sin(v)), (u, 0, 2*pi), (u, -pi, pi))
ValueError: If the ranges in the argument of parametric_plot3d are both 3-tuples, then the first components of those 3-tuples must be different.
```
