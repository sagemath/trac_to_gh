```
sage: var('x,y')
sage: plot3d(sin(x*y), (x,-1,1), (x,-1,1))
boom!
```

The problem is that both ranges use the variable x.  The fix is to make
sure that the two variables are different and if not raise an exception (do this also in parametric_plot3d).

plot3d and parametric_plot3d should fail a tiny bit more gracefully if they're given two ranges using the same variable:

```
sage: var('x,y')
sage: plot3d(sin(x*y), (x,-1,1), (x,-1,1))
ValueError: If the ranges in the argument of plot3d are 3-tuples, then the first components of those 3-tuples must be different.
sage: var('u,v')
sage: parametric_plot3d((cos(u), sin(u) + cos(v), sin(v)), (u, 0, 2*pi), (u, -pi, pi))
ValueError: If the ranges in the argument of parametric_plot3d are both 3-tuples, then the first components of those 3-tuples must be different.

I've posted a new patch that raises an error in the usual way, and provides a briefer but still clear error message.  If this is accepted, only trac_1877.patch should be applied.

trac_1877_review.patch does some minor cosmetic adjustements on top of trac_1877.patch (like not starting the error messages with a capital).  Otherwise this gets a positive review from me.

It might still my part still needs to be reviewed so I'll leave it as needs review.
