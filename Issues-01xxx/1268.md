I've built a new MPFI spkg that switches to using the current MPFI CVS.  (They have all the bug fixes from the previous Sage spkg, and more.)  Plus, they've started installing shared and static libraries, so we end up using the shared library version.

The new spkg is at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/cwitty/mpfi-1.3.4-cvs20071125.p1.spkg

testall passes on 32-bit x86 linux with the new spkg.

By the way, if you're going to test it, you can't just install the new spkg, because the old library will still be statically linked in to the relevant extension modules.  You also need to do:

```
touch devel/sage/sage/rings/mpfi.pxi
sage -b
```
