At least on sage.math Sage fails to start up when doing import all. The following doctest failure illustrates the problem:

```
mabshoff@sage:/tmp/Work-mabshoff/release-cycles-2.9/sage-2.9.alpha7$ ./sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/numerical/test.py
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/numerical/test.py             Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ".doctest_test.py", line 1, in <module>
    from sage.all_cmdline import *;

ne 33, in <module>
    from sage.rings.complex_double import CDF
ImportError: /tmp/Work-mabshoff/release-cycles-2.9/sage-2.9.alpha7/local/lib/libcblas.so: undefined symbol: ATL_ctbmv

         [0.3 s]
exit code: 256
```
The attached patch fixes that, but not in a very clean way. I tried various "clean" approaches, but non of them got past Cython and always lead to link errors.

Cheers,

Michael
