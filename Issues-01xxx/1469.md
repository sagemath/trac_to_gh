The doctest script sage-doctest should try to import the namespace of the file being tested. It is not very convenient to add

```
from sage.foo import bar
```

at the beginning of every doctest in a file.

This would simplify some of the doctests in ~100 files, removing ~450 lines.

Importing the module might have an impact on the speed of the doctests.
