Consider this example from the Magma handbook:

```
# n integers which's GCD we are interested in
sage: Q = [ 67015143, 248934363018, 109210, 25590011055, 74631449, 10230248, 709487, 68965012139, 972065, 864972271 ]
sage: n = len(Q)
sage: S = 100 
sage: X = Matrix(IntegerRing(), n, n + 1)
sage: for i in xrange(n):
...     X[i,i + 1] = 1
sage: for i in xrange(n): 
...     X[i,0] = S*Q[i]
sage: L = X.LLL()
sage: show(L)
sage: M = L[n-1].list()[1:]
sage: add([Q[i]*M[i] for i in range(n)])
864972271
```

which isn't quite right, we expect:

```
# n integers which's GCD we are interested in
sage: Q = [ 67015143, 248934363018, 109210, 25590011055, 74631449, 10230248, 709487, 68965012139, 972065, 864972271 ]
sage: n = len(Q)
sage: S = 100 
sage: X = Matrix(IntegerRing(), n, n + 1)
sage: for i in xrange(n):
...     X[i,i + 1] = 1
sage: for i in xrange(n): 
...     X[i,0] = S*Q[i]
sage: L = X.LLL(algorithm='NTL:LLL')
sage: show(L)
sage: M = L[n-1].list()[1:]
sage: add([Q[i]*M[i] for i in range(n)])
-1
```

Is this my lack of understanding of LLL reduction or is this a bug?

One quick point is at least the result is still a basis for the correct lattice:

```
A = X.row_module()
B = L.row_module()
A == B
///
True
```

so it's returning something that is a basis for the correct lattice.  But maybe it's not LLL reduced. 

We should write a function to determine whether or not a matrix is LLL reduced, i.e., use the LLL criterion, as described in Section 2.6 of Cohen's book. 

If the output isn't LLL reduced, then there is definitely a bug.  

Anyway, I am going to attempt to implement this criterion right now, and see what
happens.

Correction to the above comment: fpLLL gets things wrong, not NTL.

Currently Sage doesn't check the return value of the LLL() calls in fplll.pyx (zero = ok, non-zero = error). When adding that, it turns out that for this example fpLLL itself detects something is wrong.

```
[11:46] <wjp> malb: I slightly updated your fplll patch replacing ret < 0 by ret != 0 since fpLLL returns positive values on error
[11:46] <malb> I disagree
[11:46] <malb> are you sure it has to be an error if !=0 ?
[11:47] <malb> it just returns kappa, doesn't it?
[11:47] <wjp> only in error case, as far as I can tell
[11:47] <malb> the example will not work if you test for ret != 0
[11:47] <malb> i.e. the doctest I just added
[11:48] <wjp> that's strange; I'll look through the fplll sources again then
[11:48] <malb> also heuristic may return kappa != 0 because it is not guaranteed to be LLL reduced anyway
[11:48] <malb> I only superficially scanned the source though
[11:48] <wjp> hm, so it might not be usable as an error code
[11:49] <malb> yes, but I am not sure, we could ask Damien?
