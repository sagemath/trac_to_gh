I run 32-bit Debian on my Core 2 Duo box.  ATLAS detects the Core 2 Duo and attempts to do a 64-bit build, which fails with errors like this:

```

Unable to find usable compiler for ICC; abortingMake sure compilers are in your path, and specify good compilers to configure
(see INSTALL.txt or 'configure --help' for details)
```
(Note the "-b 64" at the beginning of the above, which means to do a 64-bit build.)

Adding "-b 32" to the configure line in spkg-install allows the build to proceed.
