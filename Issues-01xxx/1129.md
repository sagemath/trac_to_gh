I don't know whether this helps, but here it is:  the problem is clearly in factor(), not in is_irreducible().  Now the function factor() first creates the pari polynomial

```
Mod(1, a^2 - 5)*x^5 + Mod(-a + 2, a^2 - 5)*x^4 + Mod(-a, a^2 - 5)*x^3 + Mod(3*a - 6, a^2 - 5)*x^2 + Mod(5*a - 10, a^2 - 5)*x + Mod(2*a - 5, a^2 - 5)
```
and then asks pari to factor it.

But this is what happens if I try that directly in pari:

```
? f=Mod(1, a^2 - 5)*x^5 + Mod(-a + 2, a^2 - 5)*x^4 + Mod(-a, a^2 - 5)*x^3 + Mod(3*a - 6, a^2 - 5)*x^2 + Mod(5*a - 10, a^2 - 5)*x + Mod(2*a - 5, a^2 - 5)
%7 = Mod(1, a^2 - 5)*x^5 + Mod(-a + 2, a^2 - 5)*x^4 + Mod(-a, a^2 - 5)*x^3 + Mod(3*a - 6, a^2 - 5)*x^2 + Mod(5*a - 10, a^2 - 5)*x + Mod(2*a - 5, a^2 - 5)
? factor(f)
  *** factor: bug in GP (Segmentation Fault), please report
```

So it seems to be an issue with pari, not with sage proper.

Added a fix for this bug. This code called into the pari library function factor0, which was then calling off to factornf. The error coming from factornf is still boggling to me (see note below), but reading the documentation, it mentions that nffactor is in general faster anyway. So I switched the code to use nffactor; this required one small modification elsewhere in the NumberField code. Specifically, F.pari_polynomial would always return a polynomial in "x", but we needed it to be in a different variable (because of Pari's notion of "priority" of variables, basically). So I added an optional argument to that function, switched the factor for polynomials over a NumberField to call into nffactor, and now everything seems to work. 

Note: the Pari error can be reproduced in gp as follows:

```
? f=Mod(1, a^2 - 5)*x^5 + Mod(-a + 2, a^2 - 5)*x^4 + Mod(-a, a^2 - 5)*x^3 + Mod(3*a - 6, a^2 - 5)*x^2 + Mod(5*a - 10, a^2 - 5)*x + Mod(2*a - 5, a^2 - 5)
%1 = Mod(1, a^2 - 5)*x^5 + Mod(-a + 2, a^2 - 5)*x^4 + Mod(-a, a^2 - 5)*x^3 + Mod(3*a - 6, a^2 - 5)*x^2 + Mod(5*a - 10, a^2 - 5)*x + Mod(2*a - 5, a^2 - 5)
? factor(f)
  *** factornf: reducible modulus in factornf.
? factornf(f, a^2-5)
  *** factornf: reducible modulus in factornf.
```

The documentation for factornf says that it uses "Trager's trick" to do factorization over a number field. I think this is just a bug in Pari, which I'm happy to report, as long as someone confirms for me that I'm not doing something stupid (i.e. not knowing how to use Pari correctly).
