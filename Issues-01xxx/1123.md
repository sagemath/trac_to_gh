I had sage installed by the IT folks at my university, and they compiled it in one directory and then moved it to another location.  Most things work, but the notebook has some bugs.  In particular, I can create a worksheet but then I cannot open it.  The notebook says:

Internal Server Error
An error occurred rendering the requested page. More information is available in the server log.

On the server log, there is a reference to the original directory (in this case /root/sage-2.8.11) in the error:

        Traceback (most recent call last):

        exceptions.OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/root/sage-2.8.11'

I am going to have them recompile it in its present directory and see if that fixes it.
