Thanks.  I would actually strongly encourage you or somebody to
sit down and actually write a function that has the _same_ functionality
as http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Partition.html
since that looks like a very useful function, and I think having it
trivially available in Sage will be very useful to people used to
Mathematica or people porting Mathematica code to Sage.
I hope people will implement something with the same interface and
submit a patch.

and 

```
Let me be the first of many  ;-)  to say that's maybe more efficient to
use a temporary variable for the padding:

def partition(v,n,pad=0):
    t=(v+[pad]*(n-len(v)%n))
    return [t[i:i+n] for i in range(0,len(v),n)]


-vgermrk-
```
