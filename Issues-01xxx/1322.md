There are several problems with the way things are done in menu-widget.patch:

* We rely on a complete hack of sending an AJAX request with an invalid cell id (-1).  The webserver complains ("Warning -- cell -1 no longer exists"), but the code is still executed and everything seems fine.  So it'd be great if we could remove the warning and call it a feature :).
* The variable is not set initially.  You have to select a value before using the variable.  The variable is not set initially because I couldn't figure out how to set a global variable from within the menu.__init__ function.  We could probably look into the polynomial ring stuff and figure out how to inject variables into the global namespace.  I have a rough cython file written that attempts to define an "inject_global" function that injects a variable into the global namespace, but when this function is called from menu.__init__, it doesn't inject into the global namespace.
* When a value is updated via the menu, it doesn't change or reevaluate any cells in the notebook.  It would be very nice to automatically evaluate other cells in the notebook to get real-time dynamic feedback from picking new values from the menu.

The menu select box is the tip of the iceberg here.  It'd be nice to have fancy sliders and things like that using javascript.

Oh, and one more thing: we currently have to import the function:

```
sage: from sage.server.notebook.widgets.menu import menu
sage: menu('f',[sin,cos,tan]).show()

(a menu is shown.  pick a value for f)

sage: plot(f(x),0,2*pi).show()

(the plot of f(x) (with the selected f) is shown.)

Wow, this is a lot of fun!

Here's another, more interesting example.  (This uses a CELL_ID of zero, so the first cell in your notebook will be overwritten.)

```
x = polygen(ZZ)
coeff_range = ButtonGroup([-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4])
manipulate("p = a*x^4 + b*x^3 + c*x^2 + d*x + e; show(plot(p, -4, 4)); show(p); p.roots(ring=RR)", 
           {'a': coeff_range,
            'b': coeff_range,
            'c': coeff_range,
            'd': coeff_range,
            'e': coeff_range}, 0)
```

Just judging from the functionality, I'd be willing to give a positive review once these two issues were addressed.  (I haven't read the code yet, though.)

1. Having to specify a CELL_ID is lame.

2. The API of specifying a dictionary is bad.  In the above example, the controls don't appear in the expected order (a,b,c,d,e); but that can't be fixed in manipulate, because it doesn't know what order you used when you typed the dictionary literal.  Instead, manipulate should take a list of pairs.

Wishlist items:

1. Slider bars would be nice.

2. Widgets should be labeled with the variable name they control.

3. The syntax is pretty ugly.  I haven't thought of a way to fix that without some sort of preparser; here's a first suggestion for a preparser-based syntax:

```
%manipulate
x : Menu([2,4,6,8])
y : Menu([1,10,100,1000])
--
x^y
```
For extra bonus points, this could work in conjunction with %pari/%magma/etc.

This patch manipulate-take3.patch is a completely totally different approach to the whole manipulate thing.  It is just a prototype!!! It's not supposed to work perfectly, in particular, you must enter a number first and press return to see anything.
Anyway, here are some example inputs (each should be entered in its own cell):

```
@manipulate
def myfactor(n):
    print jsmath(factor(n))


@manipulate
def polys(m):
    R = QQ['x']
    f = R.random_element(m)
    print "f = ", jsmath(f)
    print "real roots = ", f.real_roots()
    show(plot(f))



@manipulate
def ellcurve(label):
    E = EllipticCurve(label)
    show(E)
    show("E conductor = %s"%E.conductor())
    show(E.q_eigenform(7))
    show(plot(E))



@manipulate
def pl(n):
    var('x,y')
    show(x^n-y^n)
    show(plot3d(x^n-y^n, (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2)))

```
