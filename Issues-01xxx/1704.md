This patch replaces the `_DivPolyContext` class with a new function `_multiply_point`. The main downside of the original `_DivPolyContext` is that it's very recursive, and I started overflowing python's stack for some large problems I needed to play with. The new function is not recursive, and also turns out to be slightly faster.
