The code in the new cremona* package contains all of what was in the mwrank* package.  So the latter can be abandoned as soon as the wrappings for mwrank functions have been migrated.  This will only be really serious when I next fix a bug in mwrank -- since from now on I'll only be editing the version which is part of cremona*.

I'm sure this is an easy job for someone who is familiar with the mwrank wrappings (not me, alas, though I suppose I should be).

I am taking care of this. The following things need to be done:

```
[18:17] <was_> Definitely the solution is to (1) remove the mwrank*spkg.
[18:17] <was_> (2) copy over the mwrank executable which gets build as part of cremona*.spkg
[18:17] <was_> (3) Change things in setup.py so that all the prober mwrank-related libraries are linked in (it's maybe 4 libraries now instead of 1)
```

Cheers,

Michael
