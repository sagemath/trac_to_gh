The code in the new cremona* package contains all of what was in the mwrank* package.  So the latter can be abandoned as soon as the wrappings for mwrank functions have been migrated.  This will only be really serious when I next fix a bug in mwrank -- since from now on I'll only be editing the version which is part of cremona*.

I'm sure this is an easy job for someone who is familiar with the mwrank wrappings (not me, alas, though I suppose I should be).
