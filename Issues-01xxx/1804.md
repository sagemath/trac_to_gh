This is LAME:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, 2)
sage: F = Factorization([(x,3), (y,2)]); F
x^3 * y^2
sage: F*F
x^6 * y^4
```

Same comments apply to `__invert__` in the file factorization.py.  

```
sage: R.<x,y> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, 2)
sage: F = Factorization([(x,3), (y,2)]); F
x^3 * y^2
sage: F^(-1)
x^-3 * y^-2
