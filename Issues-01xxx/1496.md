It was built using latex2html plus an html --> worksheet parser
that Dorian Raymer wrote. 

I did start writing something to turn *tex* documents into sage notebooks, but
it's really not ready for prime time, and that's not what you want anyways. 

You can link worksheets together though, e.g., this will make a link to worksheet 15:

<a href="/home/admin/15">worksheet 15</a>

This is obviously sucky, since the worksheet numbers change if you download/upload
the worksheets.  Doing something better, i.e., somehow linking by the title of the worksheet,
etc., is not yet implemented.
