`NumberFieldElement_quadratic` should override `_new()` to copy the D attribute from the source object; currently every call to _new() actually calls the base class implementation and then D is copied manually.


Component: **basic arithmetic**

Currently quadratic field elements don't have __numerator or __denominator (or any other ntl variables) defined, so I'm not sure if this is really an issue. 

See, however, #1385

Robert convinced me in email that the patch is fine as-is, but he said it wasn't worth merging this code since #1385 would happen soon and the code would all be rewritten anyway.

Since it's been two months and #1385 hasn't happened, it's time to go ahead and merge this patch; I'm changing my review to positive.  (Note that my positive review is, essentially, from early December; I have not tested that doctests still pass, or even that the patch still applies to a current Sage.)

Mmmh, maybe I was too optimistic: This patch does cause some doctest failures in `tut.tex` that potentially indicate much more trouble than it is worth for 2.10.2, so I might still revert the patch.
