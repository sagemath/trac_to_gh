I have found a code C which crashes C.permutation_automorphism_group().
This function basically is a wrapper for GAP's `MatrixAutomorphisms` 
function. The code that causes it to fail is [20,14] in

Is this a bug in gap?  If so, make a Gap-only session that replicates it and report it to the Gap list asap.

This definitely doesn't seem valid anymore:

In fact, none of the codes from that function cause a "crash":

```
sage: for n in range(24):
....:     for C in self_dual_codes(n):
....:         G = C[0].permutation_automorphism_group()
....:
