The url in trac emails is typically something like

```
http://modular.math.washington.edu:9002/sage_trac/ticket/1657
```
but it should be

```
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/1657
```

This is very bad, because people behind certain firewalls can only
view the latter URL and not the former.  Also the latter URL is stable,
but the former could easily change, e.g., if I run trac on a different port.
