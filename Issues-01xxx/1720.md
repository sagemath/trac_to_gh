This updates the numpy package to the latest version 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jkantor/spkgs/numpy-20080104-1.0.4.spkg

(note I have removed a section of the spkg-install that was allowing numpy to build without
atlas if the inital build didn't work. I saw that this was happengin when using gfortran. I think I fixed the initial problem but this may cause build failures that were going unnoticed to become manifest. I want to know so I can fix them.)
