This should either raise an error or give a result:


```
a = RealInterval('2.3')
erf(a)
```


CPU is at about 0%, so it is doing nothing.

maybe there are other unsupported functions, should be checked out!

This actually has nothing to do with erf really -- it's that converting a real interval to Maxima (or any other system) should raise a TypeError, but doesn't.   

Of course, erf could be implemented for intervals, but that's not done yet; that would be an enhancement not a bug.
