Yep, that is a bug.  I've made it.

```

My first thought on reading the above is "get rid of handling .sage files in a special way in order to automatically fix all such issues".   That's what I did with .tex files a while ago.

I think the issue has been fixed in Sage 3.2.x since we no longer treat .sage files special. Can you verify this?

Cheers,

Michael

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

This is fixed. A simple test case:

```
$ cat sage_extension_tests.sage 
r"""

A test case for *.sage files.

::

    sage: 1
    1

::

    sage: 2 # long time
    2

::

    sage: 3
    3

"""
```

I see that the long test is skipped normally:

```
$ sage -t -verbose sage_extension_tests.sage
...
5 passed and 0 failed.
```

And executed when -long is passed:

```
$ sage -t -verbose -long sage_extension_tests.sage
...
6 passed and 0 failed.
```
