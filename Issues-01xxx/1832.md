real is defined as:
    try: return x.real()
    except AttributeError: return CDF(x).real()
so it's fallback behavior is to create an RDF, if it hasn't
been otherwise defined.  It should be the "real part"
in general, so for the rationals (and integers) it should be defined to
just return the rational number.   Even better, the definition
of the real default method should be changed to try coercing
x to RDF and if that succeeds, just return x itself.

No.  A real double is a double precision machine real.  It is much
faster than a real_mpfr with precision 53 bits.  However, mpfr's have
better numerical semantics. 

sage: a, b = RDF(3993), RDF(18)
sage: c, d = RR(3993), RR(18)
sage: time for _ in xrange(10^6): e = a*b
CPU times: user 0.29 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.30 s
Wall time: 0.31
sage: time for _ in xrange(10^6): e = c*d
CPU times: user 0.77 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.78 s
Wall time: 0.83
sage: time for _ in xrange(10^6): e = a.sin()
CPU times: user 0.50 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.51 s
Wall time: 0.56
sage: time for _ in xrange(10^6): e = c.sin()
CPU times: user 12.24 s, sys: 1.38 s, total: 13.61 s
Wall time: 14.98

real( ... ) means "real part"

> How is the real_double implemented, i guess though mpfr?

No.  It uses GSL for most functionality actually.  CDF for complex
double is similar.
