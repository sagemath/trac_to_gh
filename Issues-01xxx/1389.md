Most patches here should be trivial to review, though some *may* require rebasing. 

This ticket perhaps should have an ongoing existence - as patches are merged, new ones could still be added.

Of the patches here:

```
copying.patch,
readme.patch,
readmeOSX.patch,
```
all look okay: the changes are pretty trivial.
`mercurial-howto.patch` I think is no longer needed, since I think that file has been deleted.  Right?

`10737.patch` actually changes some code, so is slightly less trivial.  It looks good, too.

I'll give a positive review to all of these. Two things:

1. After applying 10737.patch, the output from

```
sage: banner()
```
is 

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
which is not the same as what I see when I start up Sage:
| Sage Version 3.1.4, Release Date: 2008-10-16                       |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Loading SAGE library. Current Mercurial branch is: clone
```
Note the two instances of "SAGE" here. Where is this string coded?

Not exactly. It's shipped with sage-3.1.3 source distribution in the directory

```
<sage-parent-dir>/sage-3.1.3/devel/sage-main/mercurial-howto.txt

But perhaps it'll be removed in sage-3.2?

The patches **copying.patch, readme.patch, readmeOSX.patch**
all affect files at the top-level of SAGE_ROOT.  I don't know if there is a corresponding repository for those, so they might need to be applied by hand.

Produced using `hg_sage`: **10737.patch, 1389-misc.patch**.

Produced using `hg_doc`: **1389-tut.patch**.

Produced using `hg_scripts`: **1389-scripts.patch**.  This one hasn't been reviewed yet; the others all seem to have positive reviews.

As far as I can tell, these can be applied in any order.

Share and Enjoy.

> 4. From [Publications](http://www.sagemath.org/library/publications.html), publication items 4 and 20 both have "SAGE" in their names. I'm not sure it's a good idea to change those occurrences of "SAGE" to "Sage".



I think we can leave publication item 4 alone. The only occurrence of "SAGE" for that item is from a quoted text within a paper: "On page 10 they write "These performance numbers were obtained using the SAGE library."

Hi, I'm well aware of all those old uppercase occurrencies on the website. I just have to finish another project, then I'll redo the packages, download and all other sites like that. Those are old scripts that I'll replace. Don't worry. 

Though, the donation page for the foundation is still unclear, since it could be registered by the uppercase version and therefore it simply has this name, but shouldn't be a problem.

The patch `1389-scripts.patch` looks good to me. However, when I applied `1389-scripts.patch` against sage-3.1.4 using the command `hg_scripts.patch("<path-to>/1389-scripts.patch")`, the following section from the patch was rejected:

It seems that the script

that's shipped with sage-3.1.4 contains the line

```
SAGE Version 3.1.4, Release Date: 2008-10-20

and NOT

```
SAGE Version 3.1.4, Release Date: 2008-10-16

Notice the different release dates, which I think accounts for the said rejection. By the way, I fetched the sage-3.1.4 source distribution from

So if we're going to fix the citation of Sage in the script `sage-3.1.4/local/bin/sage-banner`, then assuming you're working with sage-3.1.4, here's a suggestion:
