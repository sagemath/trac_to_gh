I thought we already wrote code so building sage on cygwin would *immediately* terminate the build with a "it won't work" error.  Same with gcc <= 3.3.  But
we keep getting emails like this on sage-support:

```
I just downloaded sage 2.9 source code tar from http://www.sagemath.org/dist/src/index.html

did tar xvf on it, then did make.

I get this build error below.
I am using cygwin

I just tested and Sage prints a message informing the user that it
isn't supported, but then goes on happily :)

Even if we terminate the build by default I would really like to bypass this by setting some magic env-variable to keep the port alive. The same should happen on Solaris.

Cheers,

I added the following to `spkg/base/prereq-0.3-install`:

```
if [ "$SAGE_PORT" = "" ]; then
   if [ `uname | sed -e 's/WIN.\+/WIN/'` = "CYGWIN" ]; then
      echo "Building or using SAGE with Cygwin is absolutely definitely"
      echo "not supported, and will definitely not work.  The only way"
      echo "to run SAGE on Windows, is via VMware (or Virtual PC or "
      echo "some other virtualization system such as andLinux)."
      echo "NOTE: SAGE used to support Cygwin several months ago (around March"
      echo "2007), so you may have seen some old documentation about this."
      exit -1
   fi
   if [ `uname` = "SunOS" ]; then
      echo "Building or using Sage on Solaris is tricky and not supported"
      echo "at the moment. It is possible, but you should be well aware that"
      echo "some things do not work. To get past this message export the"
      echo "variable \$SAGE_PORT to something non-empty. Support for Solaris"
      echo "is actively being worked on."
      exit -1
   fi
fi
```
The first check, i.e. the Cygwin one was already there, but was missing the `exit -1`.

Cheers,

Michael
