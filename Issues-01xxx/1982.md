I'm a total newbie and installed sage 2.10 from a .dmg on Mac Os 10.5.
It seems to be a python error, but I have no idea about python as
well.

Thanks for your help
Cheers
Matthias

Could you try carefully replacing  the file

  /Applications/sage/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/matplotlib/cbook.py

on your computer by the attached file, then report back to us whether this
fixes the problem or not?  Thanks!  If so, we'll be able to easily patch Sage
so that this problem doesn't happen for you in the future (when you upgrade).

Thanks for reporting this issue with running Sage!

Hi William,

thanks for your help. The file worked perfectly fine!
Kudos to the program, I'm just starting to use it and already it seems
REALLY powerful!

Cheers

Attachment [cbook.py](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket1982/cbook.py) by @williamstein created at 2008-01-30 12:35:18

I think there is also a need version of matplotlib, so probably when looking into this patch, one should also upgrade matplotlib, and see if this change is still needed. 

The changed cbook.py try except calling some locale function in the standard Python library, because on REAL LIFE computers often that function often blows up (!), even
though it probably "shouldn't" if everybody's computers were setup perfectly.  Honestely, I've even had related problems on my office mac pro, which is pretty weird since it's fairly plain vanilla.

This is a dupe of #1967. `cbook.py` is identical in both cases.
