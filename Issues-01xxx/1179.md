```

I've tried started it from bash and tcsh, if that matters.
But please note that on Solaris /bin/sh is not bash, so
if scripts start with

#!/bin/sh

some things may not work as expected. 
```

On neron, i.e. William's Sun we replaced /bin/sh by /bin/bash because the original /bin/sh caused all kinds of problems during the build.

Cheers,

Michael
