The patch removes `FiniteField_prime_modn` from `finite_field.py` because it was odd that this implementation was the only showing up in the reference manual. Also, `GF` is now defined in `rings.all` rather than in `rings.finite_field` to avoid that the documentation for it shows up twice. Finally, a more verbose description of the finite field module is given at the top of the `finite_field.py` file and some doctests were added to `FiniteField_prime_modn`.
