There is code in integer_mod.pyx that coerces a Python int into an int_fast32_t.  This is wrong, since a Python int can hold a C long; so this might truncate if sizeof(int_fast32_t) < sizeof(long).

However, the bug has little or no practical effect, since:
1) on 64-bit x86 Linux, sizeof(int_fast32_t) == sizeof(long);
2) the problem only occurs if you call `IntegerMod_int` directly (which nobody should); it looks like all the wrappers do the modulo before they create the `IntegerMod_int`.

Component: **basic arithmetic**
