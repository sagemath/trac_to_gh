The rows of matrices in a list right now do not line up when printed, even though carriage returns are inserted as if they should line up.  That means all the matrices look *very* messed up when printing a list of matrices.

In the command line:

```
sage: list(MatrixSpace(GF(2),2))

[[0 0]
[0 0],
 [1 0]
[0 0],
 [0 1]
[0 0],
 [0 0]
[1 0],
 [0 0]
[0 1],
 [1 1]
[0 0],

[1 0],
 [1 1]
[0 1],
 [1 0]
[1 1],
 [0 1]
[1 1],
 [1 1]
[1 1]]
```

In the notebook, it's worse.  Each matrix is chopped in half and continues at the start of the next line.  This gives the appearance of matrices that are not part of the list (one row of one matrix and another row from a different matrix).

```
[[0 0]
[0 0], [1 0]
[0 0], [0 1]
[0 0], [0 0]
[1 0], [0 0]
[0 1], [1 1]
[0 0], [1 0]
[1 0], [1 0]
[0 1], [0 1]
[1 0], [0 1]
[0 1], [0 0]
[1 1], [1 1]
[1 0], [1 1]
[0 1], [1 0]
[1 1], [0 1]
[1 1], [1 1]
[1 1]]
```

An example of better output would be:

```
sage: list(MatrixSpace(GF(2),2))

[
[0 0]
[0 0],

[1 0]
[0 0],

[0 1]
[0 0],

[0 0]
[1 0],

[0 0]
[0 1],

[1 1]
[0 0],

[1 0]
[1 0],

[1 0]
[0 1],

[0 1]
[1 0],

[0 1]
[0 1],

[0 0]

[1 1]
[0 1],

[1 0]
[1 1],

[0 1]
[1 1],

[1 1]
[1 1]]
```

Or even better:

```
[
[0 0]  [1 0]  [0 1]  [0 0]  [0 0]  [1 1]  
[0 0], [0 0], [0 0], [1 0], [0 1], [0 0], 

[1 0]  [1 0]  [0 1]  [0 1]  [0 0]  [1 1]
[1 0], [0 1], [1 0], [0 1], [1 1], [1 0],

[1 1]  [1 0]  [0 1]  [1 1]
[0 1], [1 1], [1 1], [1 1]
]
```

By the way and as a consequence, I don't think this has to do with linear algebra.

I agree.  Furthermore, this will let us shake out any unintended consequences or bugs in a narrow case before expanding to lots of combinatorics objects.

The patch has already waited a long time.  Unless the change you suggest is trivial (but it sounds like already there are questions about the design of your suggestion), I'd say if the patch is ready to go in, let it go in.

    "body": "<a id='comment:10'></a>Replying to [comment:7 hivert]:\n\nI agree that there are many more cases where this type of list formatting could be useful, and indeed the code is general enough to work with any type of object whose repr spans multiple lines. The issue is simply choosing which lists to format specially (in print_obj()).\n\nIn one of my earlier iterations of the displayhook, I applied the special list formatting to every \"tall\" list. But when I ran testall I found that some objects just didn't work well with the formatting. So I think that applying the hook always is a mistake, and besides would introduce many more doctest headaches. Having objects \"opt-in\" by including a special field or method that tells the displayhook to use the special list formatting sounds like a good idea though.\n\nThis kind of work should definitely be done, but in another ticket. We will have to come to an agreement about these design issues. For now, let's get this patch into Sage.",

<a id='comment:10'></a>Replying to [comment:7 hivert]:

I agree that there are many more cases where this type of list formatting could be useful, and indeed the code is general enough to work with any type of object whose repr spans multiple lines. The issue is simply choosing which lists to format specially (in print_obj()).

In one of my earlier iterations of the displayhook, I applied the special list formatting to every "tall" list. But when I ran testall I found that some objects just didn't work well with the formatting. So I think that applying the hook always is a mistake, and besides would introduce many more doctest headaches. Having objects "opt-in" by including a special field or method that tells the displayhook to use the special list formatting sounds like a good idea though.

This kind of work should definitely be done, but in another ticket. We will have to come to an agreement about these design issues. For now, let's get this patch into Sage.

You raise an interesting point Florent. The problem here is that Python's displayhook mechanism only affects the output from the interpreter, not the behavior of the print statement.

```
sage: print format_list_of_matrices([matrix(2,2) * 3])
