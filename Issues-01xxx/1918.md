The rows of matrices in a list right now do not line up when printed, even though carriage returns are inserted as if they should line up.  That means all the matrices look *very* messed up when printing a list of matrices.

In the command line:

```
sage: list(MatrixSpace(GF(2),2))

[[0 0]
[0 0],
 [1 0]
[0 0],
 [0 1]
[0 0],
 [0 0]
[1 0],
 [0 0]
[0 1],
 [1 1]

 [1 1]
[0 1],
 [1 0]
[1 1],
 [0 1]
[1 1],
 [1 1]
[1 1]]
```

In the notebook, it's worse.  Each matrix is chopped in half and continues at the start of the next line.  This gives the appearance of matrices that are not part of the list (one row of one matrix and another row from a different matrix).

```
[[0 0]
[0 0], [1 0]
[0 0], [0 1]
[0 0], [0 0]
[1 0], [0 0]
[0 1], [1 1]
[0 0], [1 0]
[1 0], [1 0]
[0 1], [0 1]
[1 0], [0 1]
[0 1], [0 0]
[1 1], [1 1]
[1 0], [1 1]
[0 1], [1 0]
[1 1], [0 1]
[1 1], [1 1]
[1 1]]
```

An example of better output would be:

```
sage: list(MatrixSpace(GF(2),2))

[
[0 0]
[0 0],

[1 0]
[0 0],

[0 1]
[0 0],

[0 0]
[1 0],

[0 0]
[0 1],

[1 1]
[0 0],

[1 0]
[1 0],

[1 0]
[0 1],

[0 1]
[1 0],

[0 1]
[0 1],

[0 0]
[1 1],

[1 1]
[1 0],

[1 1]
[0 1],

[1 0]
[1 1],

[0 1]
[1 1],

[1 1]
[1 1]]
```

Or even better:

```
[
[0 0]  [1 0]  [0 1]  [0 0]  [0 0]  [1 1]  
[0 0], [0 0], [0 0], [1 0], [0 1], [0 0], 

[1 0]  [1 0]  [0 1]  [0 1]  [0 0]  [1 1]
[1 0], [0 1], [1 0], [0 1], [1 1], [1 0],

[1 1]  [1 0]  [0 1]  [1 1]
[0 1], [1 1], [1 1], [1 1]
]
```

This is another example of something that can probably only ? be addressed
by changing the Python displayhook thing.  That's completely reasonable.

The patch doesn't just lead to doctest failures in the matrix directory - on my machine it seems to lead to the failure of every single doctest that produces output!  e.g.

```
File "/Applications/sage/devel/sage-1918/sage/algebras/algebra.py", line 29:
    sage: is_Algebra(R)
Expected:
    True
Got nothing
```
When running a test manually (i.e. typing it into a sage console), everything works as intended - the output matches the expected doctest result exactly.  So the patch seems to break the doctesting mechanism in some way.  I note that all of the output-producing tests in the new file displayhook.py pass their output through DH.print_obj() or similar.

But maybe we should keep the for another patch. 

By the way and as a consequence, I don't think this has to do with linear algebra.

To be more specific, I'd like to be able to write thing like that

```
sage: class bla(): 
....:     def __init__(self, str): self.str=str
....:     def __repr__(self): return self.str
``` 
And without patching displayhook, to get

```
sage: sage.misc.displayhook._check_tall_list_and_print(sys.stdout, [a,b])
[
       dsf
werew  sdf
sdfd , sf 
]
```
instead of...

```
sage: [bla("werew\nsdfd"), bla("dsf\nsdf\nsf")]
[werew
sdfd, dsf
sdf
sf]
```
I'm not sure what is the correct mechanism of plugin. should we add in the class a method called say `_repr_use2d_` ?

I agree.  Furthermore, this will let us shake out any unintended consequences or bugs in a narrow case before expanding to lots of combinatorics objects.

I agree that there are many more cases where this type of list formatting could be useful, and indeed the code is general enough to work with any type of object whose repr spans multiple lines. The issue is simply choosing which lists to format specially (in print_obj()).

In one of my earlier iterations of the displayhook, I applied the special list formatting to every "tall" list. But when I ran testall I found that some objects just didn't work well with the formatting. So I think that applying the hook always is a mistake, and besides would introduce many more doctest headaches. Having objects "opt-in" by including a special field or method that tells the displayhook to use the special list formatting sounds like a good idea though.

This kind of work should definitely be done, but in another ticket. We will have to come to an agreement about these design issues. For now, let's get this patch into Sage.

Agreed, this show that they are a lot of possible improvement in sage output routine. Thanks a lot for showing us how to do that.

I've a request concerning this ticket: You manage to hijack ipython's printer but not python's one.

```
sage: [matrix(2,2)] * 3
[
[0 0]  [0 0]  [0 0]
[0 0], [0 0], [0 0]
]
sage: print([matrix(2,2)] * 3)
[[0 0]
[0 0], [0 0]
[0 0], [0 0]
[0 0]]
```
Is it trivial to solve this ? Or should I open a new ticket ?

Cheers,

You raise an interesting point Florent. The problem here is that Python's displayhook mechanism only affects the output from the interpreter, not the behavior of the print statement. In fact, the displayhook uses the print statement to output values, so if the print statement used the displayhook it would be bad.

AFAIK, there is no way to hook into the print statement. All it does is write the object's repr to sys.stdout. And now we run into the limitation that drove us to use a displayhook in the first place: you can't change the way repr behaves for lists.

The only thing I can suggest is to add a function, say, `format_list_of_matrices()` to the matrix library so that your code becomes:

```
sage: print format_list_of_matrices([matrix(2,2) * 3])
```
But I feel like such a facility would be not at all obvious for end-users. Unless they notice how crappy a list of matrices looks when its `print`ed and root around the documentation for answers.
