The rows of matrices in a list right now do not line up when printed, even though carriage returns are inserted as if they should line up.  That means all the matrices look *very* messed up when printing a list of matrices.

In the command line:

```
sage: list(MatrixSpace(GF(2),2))

[[0 0]
[0 0],
 [1 0]
[0 0],
 [0 1]
[0 0],
 [0 0]
[1 0],
 [0 0]
[0 1],
 [1 1]
[0 0],
 [1 0]
[1 0],
 [1 0]
[0 1],
 [0 1]
[1 0],
 [0 1]
[0 1],
 [0 0]
[1 1],
 [1 1]
[1 0],
 [1 1]
[0 1],
 [1 0]
[1 1],
 [0 1]
[1 1],
 [1 1]
[1 1]]
```

In the notebook, it's worse.  Each matrix is chopped in half and continues at the start of the next line.  This gives the appearance of matrices that are not part of the list (one row of one matrix and another row from a different matrix).

```
[[0 0]
[0 0], [1 0]
[0 0], [0 1]
[0 0], [0 0]
[1 0], [0 0]
[0 1], [1 1]
[0 0], [1 0]
[1 0], [1 0]
[0 1], [0 1]
[1 0], [0 1]
[0 1], [0 0]
[1 1], [1 1]
[1 0], [1 1]
[0 1], [1 0]
[1 1], [0 1]
[1 1], [1 1]
[1 1]]
```

An example of better output would be:

```
sage: list(MatrixSpace(GF(2),2))

[
[0 0]
[0 0],

[1 0]
[0 0],

[0 1]
[0 0],

[0 0]
[1 0],

[0 0]
[0 1],

[1 1]
[0 0],

[1 0]
[1 0],

[1 0]
[0 1],

[0 1]
[1 0],

[0 1]
[0 1],

[0 0]
[1 1],

[1 1]
[1 0],

[1 1]
[0 1],

[1 0]
[1 1],

[0 1]
[1 1],

[1 1]
[1 1]]
```

Or even better:

```
[
[0 0]  [1 0]  [0 1]  [0 0]  [0 0]  [1 1]  
[0 0], [0 0], [0 0], [1 0], [0 1], [0 0], 

[1 0]  [1 0]  [0 1]  [0 1]  [0 0]  [1 1]
[1 0], [0 1], [1 0], [0 1], [1 1], [1 0],

[1 1]  [1 0]  [0 1]  [1 1]
[0 1], [1 1], [1 1], [1 1]
]
```

This is another example of something that can probably only ? be addressed
by changing the Python displayhook thing.  That's completely reasonable.

The patch doesn't just lead to doctest failures in the matrix directory - on my machine it seems to lead to the failure of every single doctest that produces output!  e.g.

```
File "/Applications/sage/devel/sage-1918/sage/algebras/algebra.py", line 29:
    sage: is_Algebra(R)
Expected:
    True
Got nothing
```
When running a test manually (i.e. typing it into a sage console), everything works as intended - the output matches the expected doctest result exactly.  So the patch seems to break the doctesting mechanism in some way.  I note that all of the output-producing tests in the new file displayhook.py pass their output through DH.print_obj() or similar.

I agree.  Furthermore, this will let us shake out any unintended consequences or bugs in a narrow case before expanding to lots of combinatorics objects.
