Notice getting +1 instead of -1:

```
sage: z = complex(0,1)
sage: z
1j
sage: z*z
(-1+0j)
sage: z^2
(1+1.973601453121677e-310j)
sage: z^float(2)
(-1+0j)
sage: z^int(2)
(-1+0j)
```

Component: **basic arithmetic**

This is a bug in Python 

```
sage: complex(0,1).__pow__(2r)
(1+2.0489322973043257e-310j)
```

I've changed the Integer.__pow__ function to use ** (which should be faster too).
