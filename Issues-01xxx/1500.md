I've already had two requests just today to solve simple equations modulo n.

Here is code to be pasted into the notebook that can do it:

```
def solve_mod(eqns, modulus):
    """
    Return all solutions to an equation or lists of equations modulo 
    the given integer modulus.  Each equation must involve only 
    polynomials in 1 or many variables. 

    The solutions are returned as n-tuples, where n is the 
    number of variables appearing anywhere in the given equations.  
    The variables are in alphabetical order. 


    INPUT:
        eqns -- equation or list of equations
        modulus -- an integer 

    EXAMPLES:
        sage: var('x,y')
        (x, y)
        sage: solve_mod([x^2 + 2 == x, x^2 + y == y^2], 14)
        [(2, 4), (6, 4), (9, 4), (13, 4)]
        sage: solve_mod([x^2 == 1, 4*x  == 11], 15)
        [(14,)]

    Fermat's equation modulo 3 with exponent 5:
        sage: var('x,y,z')
        (x, y, z)
        sage: time solve_mod([x^5 + y^5 == z^5], 3)
        [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 2), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 0), (2, 0, 2), (2, 1, 0), (2, 2, 1)]
        
    WARNING:
        Currently this naively enumerates all possible solutions.
        The interface is good, but the algorithm is horrible if the
        modulus is at all large!   Sage *does* have the ability to do
        something much faster in certain cases at least by using
        the Chinese Remainder Theorem, Groebner basis, linear algebra

        as is might be useful.  At least it establishes an interface.
    """

    modulus = Integer(modulus)
    if modulus < 1:
         raise ValueError, "the modulus must be a positive integer"
    vars = list(set(sum([list(e.variables()) for e in eqns], [])))
    vars.sort()
    n = len(vars)
    R = Integers(modulus)
    S = MPolynomialRing(R, len(vars), vars)

                break
        if is_soln:
            ans.append(t)

    return ans
```

I'll incorporate this into sage as a patch in a moment.

This seems to be a good implementation for the toy cryptanalysis i want to play around with.

```
a,b = var('a,b')
solve_mod([4*a + b == 17,19*a + b == 3],26)
///
[(6, 19)]
```

I like the interface a little better than "Solve[{x^2  == 1, 4*x  == 2, Modulus==10}, x, Mode->Modular]."

Looks good to me, is doctested, doesn't touch any existing code, so merge it.

Cheers,
