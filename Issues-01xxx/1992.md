When

```
 sage: load filename.spyx
```
is done repeatedly on a specific single file filename.spyx, after about 3-4
tries Sage tries to delete some files.  On some NFS mounted filesystems, there
are lock files, and these can't be deleted for permissions reasons.  Instead of 
sage gracefully continuing on it fails at this point, and bombs out.  This makes
loading cython files fail henceforth, making spyx files completely useless.

The fix is probably just to put a try/except block around any code that deletes files that is related to attaching and loading [s]pyx files.
