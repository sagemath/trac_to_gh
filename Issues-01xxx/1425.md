```
The following simplification is wrong in my opinion:

```
sage: pow(pow(z,2),1/3)
z^(2/3)
```
For example for z = -1, pow(pow(-1,2),1/3) gives 1, but pow(-1,2/3) should give -1/2+sqrt(3)/2*I
(it gives currently 1 in sage, which is another bug in my opinion):

```
sage: pow(-1,2/3)
1
```

Indeed pow(z,a/b) for a and b integers is defined to be pow(pow(z,1/b),a), where pow(z,1/b) is the
principal b-th root of z, i.e., in the argument domain (-pi/b, pi/b]. Thus the other simplification
pow(pow(z,1/b),a) -> pow(z, a/b) is valid, but pow(pow(z,a),1/b) -> pow(z,a/b) is not.
It suffices to consider the case a=b to understand this:

```
sage: pow(pow(z,2),1/2)
abs(z)
sage: pow(pow(z,3),1/3)
z
```

Unfortunately, this causes another major problem:

```
(%i13) domain: complex$
(%i14) radcan( sqrt(x^2) - x );
(%o14)                                 0
(%i15) domain: real$
(%i16) radcan( sqrt(x^2) - x );
(%o16)                            abs(x) - x
```

which causes

```
sage: bool(sqrt(x^2) == x)
True
```
