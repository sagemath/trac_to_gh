After all of the patches that lead to the fix in #1961, this case no longer takes any real time. Once #1961 is merged, this ticket should also be closed!

I ran the computation with #1961 applied and rlm confirms that the result is as expected:

```
sage: GAut = G.automorphism_group(partition=Pi)
sage: GAut
Permutation Group with generators [(1,6)(9,14)(18,28)(19,29)(34,44)(35,45)(50,60)(51,61)(66,76)(67,77), 
(6,7)(8,9)(28,30)(29,31)(32,34)(33,35)(60,62)(61,63)(64,66)(65,67), 
(5,8)(7,10)(26,32)(27,33)(30,36)(31,37)(58,64)(59,65)(62,68)(63,69), (4,5)(10,11)(24,26)(25,27)(36,38)(37,39)(56,58)(57,59)(68,70)(69,71),
