After all of the patches that lead to the fix in #1961, this case no longer takes any real time. Once #1961 is merged, this ticket should also be closed!

I ran the computation with #1961 applied and rlm confirms that the result is as expected:

```
sage: GAut = G.automorphism_group(partition=Pi)
sage: GAut
Permutation Group with generators [(1,6)(9,14)(18,28)(19,29)(34,44)(35,45)(50,60)(51,61)(66,76)(67,77),
