Many people have reported issues with locale.py going boom on quite a range of different OS X (and Linux?) machines.  The very slightly patched version of 

  SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/matplotlib/cbook.py

attached to this ticket may very likely fix the problem.  See this thread:
  
  http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/edcf2740f7276e6a?hl=en#78ee7d78a0a99f12

If this really turns out to be the fix, cbook.py should be put into the matplotlib spkg as a patch.
