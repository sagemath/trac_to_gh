The page numbers are numbers in the pdf version (in parentheses the printed page numbers)
I'm actually not sure about how to reference the page numbers...

page 175 (162): ** instead of ^;
the pyx example says: "sage: y(x) = x*sin(x**2)"
using the "**" is nice for python, but isn't Sage emphasizing to use "^" instead?

page 1843 (1830): ncols()... return number of "rows" instead of "coloumns";
the description for ncols() reads "number of rows" instead of "number of coloumns"



Best wishes, Fabio
```

NOTES:
   The first sin(x**2) above this from plot.py, and I agree with changing it to sin(x^2)

   The second listed problem seems like a clear mistake.
