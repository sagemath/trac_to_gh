Doctesting numerical.py shows the following leak:

```

==18034==    definitely lost: 1,936 bytes in 50 blocks.
==18034==    indirectly lost: 4,928 bytes in 106 blocks.

==18034==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks.
```
With the patch I will attach shortly I get:

```
==18694== LEAK SUMMARY:
==18694==    definitely lost: 96 bytes in 4 blocks.
==18694==    indirectly lost: 240 bytes in 14 blocks.
==18694==      possibly lost: 324,343 bytes in 921 blocks.
==18694==    still reachable: 30,248,248 bytes in 211,748 blocks.
==18694==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks.
```
Sage with the patch passes testall and valgrinding the doctest doesn't show any problems.

Cheers,

Michael
