This patch extends the functionality introduced in #1869 .  It lets you show lists of things as tiled images.  This does take out the default settings for graphs that were set in #1869, though.  Should those be in the system show() command?


```
        sage: show(graphs(3), layout='circular', vertex_size=50, vertex_labels=False, graph_border=True)
        sage: show(list(graphs(3)), layout='circular', vertex_size=50, vertex_labels=False, graph_border=True)
        sage: show(graphs(4), layout='circular', vertex_size=50, vertex_labels=False, graph_border=True)
        sage: show([plot(sin(i*x)) for i in range(30)]) # Two pages of images
        sage: show([sin(i*x) for i in range(2)])
        sage: show([sin(i*x) for i in range(30)], columns=1, rows=10)
```

Jason,

The whole point of having the graphs_list functionality called from show is to take advantage of the code that is already written. Many hours were put into that code, and the fact that the show function might become bogged down is a good thing - the more things it can handle well, the better. There is no reason to undo all that hard work!

Robert,

I agree that the graphs look very nice with those default parameters and it does look like it took a lot of work to get it to the state it is in now.  Let me see if I can rework my patch to include those defaults automatically.  Is there any other functionality provided in graphs_list that isn't provided for in the attached patch?

I think I addressed in show_list-updated.patch the concerns that Robert had with the show() function not having nice defaults for graphs.  I pushed the defaults for a particular object into the class definition, though, instead of having a huge switch statement in show().  That way the defaults are not hardcoded, but could be easily changed on a per-object basis if the user wanted their graphs or other objects plotted a different way than the default (for example, if a user wanted their digraphs to look different from their graphs, or their BundleGraphs to look different from their normal graphs, etc.)

To define some defaults for plotting an object in an array, just assign the class variable object.graphics_array_defaults to a dictionary containing your default options to object.plot().  Any defaults are overridden with explicit keyword arguments to show().
