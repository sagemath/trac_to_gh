This patch extends the functionality introduced in #1869 .  It lets you show lists of things as tiled images.  This does take out the default settings for graphs that were set in #1869, though.  Should those be in the system show() command?


```
        sage: show(graphs(3), layout='circular', vertex_size=50, vertex_labels=False, graph_border=True)
        sage: show(list(graphs(3)), layout='circular', vertex_size=50, vertex_labels=False, graph_border=True)
        sage: show(graphs(4), layout='circular', vertex_size=50, vertex_labels=False, graph_border=True)
        sage: show([plot(sin(i*x)) for i in range(30)]) # Two pages of images
        sage: show([sin(i*x) for i in range(2)])
        sage: show([sin(i*x) for i in range(30)], columns=1, rows=10)

Jason,

The whole point of having the graphs_list functionality called from show is to take advantage of the code that is already written. Many hours were put into that code, and the fact that the show function might become bogged down is a good thing - the more things it can handle well, the better. There is no reason to undo all that hard work!

I think I addressed in show_list-updated.patch the concerns that Robert had with the show() function not having nice defaults for graphs.
