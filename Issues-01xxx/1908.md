This patch extends the functionality introduced in #1869 .  It lets you show lists of things as tiled images.  This does take out the default settings for graphs that were set in #1869, though.  Should those be in the system show() command?


```
        sage: show(graphs(3), layout='circular', vertex_size=50, vertex_labels=False, graph_border=True)
        sage: show(list(graphs(3)), layout='circular', vertex_size=50, vertex_labels=False, graph_border=True)
        sage: show(graphs(4), layout='circular', vertex_size=50, vertex_labels=False, graph_border=True)
        sage: show([plot(sin(i*x)) for i in range(30)]) # Two pages of images
        sage: show([sin(i*x) for i in range(2)])
        sage: show([sin(i*x) for i in range(30)], columns=1, rows=10)

Jason,

The whole point of having the graphs_list functionality called from show is to take advantage of the code that is already written. Many hours were put into that code, and the fact that the show function might become bogged down is a good thing - the more things it can handle well, the better. There is no reason to undo all that hard work!

Robert,

I agree that the graphs look very nice with those default parameters and it does look like it took a lot of work to get it to the state it is in now.  Let me see if I can rework my patch to include those defaults automatically.  Is there any other functionality provided in graphs_list that isn't provided for in the attached patch?  My purpose in this patch is to extend the great ideas in the graphs_list function to any sort of list of graphics objects.
