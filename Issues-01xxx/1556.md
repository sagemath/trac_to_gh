The current page you get when you try to login to the notebook with an unknown username is incredibly hard to read since it does not even alphabetize usernames.  This patch will alphabetize the list and put each username on a single line.

I should have finished by adding that there is no point at all in
not listing usernames in the scenarios in the first paragraph above -- that
would just be security by obscurity.  There is a point in not listing
user names in paragraph two above.  When Sage actually supports
what is described in paragraph two, then when the notebook is in
that mode it shouldn't list usernames.
