I like the idea of replacing "Use" with something like "GUI" and also
placing a "Back to Worksheet" button on the page after a file has been
uploaded.
```

I don't like "GUI" since the whole thing is a GUI.  However, "Worksheet"
might be much better.

Worksheet instead of GUI would be fine.

Another suggestion is to move the jsMath button from the bottom left corner of the window to the bottom right corner.  In its current position, it covers the part of the lowest cell that typing begins at.
