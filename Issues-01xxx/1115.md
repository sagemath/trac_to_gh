I am unable to reproduce the TypeError. Is the lie just in the precision? 

The docstring states that only the L-series is calculated with the given precision. This could be passed onto Omega as well, but letting mwrank run at precision 200 would probably take a long, long time. 

Once the generators are known, the regulator could be computed directly (rather than asking mwrank) to high precision, but this would be more an enhancement than a bug fix.

The patch sage-trac1115.patch implements the following:

In ell_point.py: arbitrary precision for canonical heights (over Q)

In ell_rational_field.py: improved use of database for gens() (e.g. if the curve is not in the database but an isomorphic curve is);  no longer gets regulator from db but computes it from gens;  regulator_of_points() function to find the regulators (i.e. det of height pairing matrix) for any list of points, to arbitrary precision;  revised regulator() function handles arbitrary precision with caching.

In ell_sha.py:  full precision setting for an_numerical(), which amongst other things deals with the original posting.

I'm in the process of looking at this.  Here are two things:

1. I get a doctest failure in ell_point.py.  Not sure what's going on, but it's basically the following:

```
sage: e = EllipticCurve([0,0,1,-1,0])  
sage: dumps(e);
sage: g = e.gens()                                                             
sage: dumps(e);
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)

/opt/sage-3.1.2.alpha3/devel/sage-main/sage/<ipython console> in <module>()

/opt/sage-3.1.2.alpha3/devel/sage-main/sage/sage_object.pyx in sage.structure.sage_object.dumps (sage/structure/sage_object.c:5132)()

RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
```

So somehow the new gens or regulator code breaks dumps(e).


2. a few minor typos:
- line 657 of ell_point.py: "precision of None" should be "precision if None"
- line 1473 of ell_rational_field.py: "int or Noene" should be "int or None"
- line 1588 of ell_rational_field.py: "number of bit" should be "number of bits"

Everything else seems to work as advertised.

I tried the dumps() thing again on a 64-bit machine and got the same error as you.

Michael A, any chance you can help determine what makes this dumps() call work ok in 32-bit but not in 64-bit?

 -- including the credit for introducing the infinite recursion!

Thanks, Alex, for your work tracking this down.  I think that in the end it was not a 32/64-bit thing at all, but rather that my 32-bit system had the optional database which *does* include the gens for database curves, while the 64-bit test I did was with a Sage which did not have the large database and hence had no gens.

I will need to change Alex's fix though:  it has the effect that even when the large database is installed so the database curve's gens are known, they are not used!  The trick will be to test if the database curve's field `__gens` is set and extract the gens from there directly instead of calling the gens() function again.

I'll do this and test it after sorting out #3377.

The new small patch  1115-sha_prec-1.patch fixes the issue raised above:  without the recursive call to gens(), it gets the database curve's gens if they are there and maps them to this curve.

I have tested this on 3.1.2.alpha4 + 3377 patches, both on 32- and 64-bit machines, bothe before and after installing the optional database (the one with the gens).

I hope that does it!

I'm getting paranoid so I've tried out John's mini-patch (although he didn't ask for it :).

Verdict: good.

After #3377 is closed, apply 1115-sha_prec.patch followed by 1115-sha_prec-1.patch.
