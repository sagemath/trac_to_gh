The fix for lcalc is to change the line

```
cp lcalc* "$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin
```
in spkg-install to

```
cp lcalc "$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin
```
The former was needed when we supported windows (e.g., lcalc.exe), and was sort of hack-ish. The latter works around that there is some small problem with strip on os x, which isn't an issue.
