```
Hello Michael,

I think I found my problem. A little googling actually helped with
this link:
http://bugs.archlinux.org/task/6864
I did some experiments with the intel _fortran_ compiler (not even the
C compiler)
and I still have it on my system.
Since the intel compiler doesn't compile my lattice QCD code correctly
anyway
I will remove it and try again.
I am busy for the next few hours so I will do that a bit latter.

Thanks for looking,
Francois
```

Cheers,

Michael

Since none of the code we compile with SCons is actually Fortran there is no point in selecting a different default Fortran compiler. Since SCons doesn't support g95 or gfortran (even with the December 2007 release!) we just remove the offending linker flag. The update spkg at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-2.11/alpha2/scons-0.97.0d20071212.spkg

It updates to the latest stable snapshot release. It also removes some crap from inside the spkg shrinking it about 30%. 

Cheers,

Michael
