Hello Michael,

I think I found my problem. A little googling actually helped with
this link:
http://bugs.archlinux.org/task/6864
I did some experiments with the intel _fortran_ compiler (not even the
C compiler)
and I still have it on my system.
Since the intel compiler doesn't compile my lattice QCD code correctly
anyway
I will remove it and try again.
I am busy for the next few hours so I will do that a bit latter.

Thanks for looking,
Francois
```

Cheers,

Michael
