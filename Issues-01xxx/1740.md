There is a know problem with ATLAS BLAS that misdetects Pentium Ms as CoreDuos and consequently takes a long, long time tuning to build. This patch by Paul Zimmermann fixes the issue. It has been integrated into 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-2.10/alpha1/atlas-3.8.p7.spkg
