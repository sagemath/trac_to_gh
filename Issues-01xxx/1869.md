Very nice functionality!

Three things:

* Could we pass the width and height of the grid as parameters?  something like {{{
sage: show(graphs(5),width=3,height=3)
# Displays 3x3 pages of the graphs
}}}
* Why limit this to graphs?  Why not have a list trigger a default rendering as a rectangular array, where each item is drawn with "show(list[i])"  Hmmm...then nested lists would even work and display nicely.
* `show(graphs(1))` gives an image with space for 4 graphs, but only the one result is displayed.  Can we make the image narrower?

I think this patch is a great start.
