I cannot reproduce this. So could you supply more information, i.e. compiler used, operating system and so on. What seems strange is that it took 90 seconds to get to a failure. on sage.math the whole doctest takes 20 second.

Please also assign a milestone to all your tickets. In case of doctest failures it should be always the next release.

Cheers,

Michael

May be you are right about some problem with my own version of
pari in #258, I could not reproduce the bug in a fresh install
of sage-2.9.3

I'll check further...
