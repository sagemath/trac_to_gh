I cannot reproduce this. So could you supply more information, i.e. compiler used, operating system and so on. What seems strange is that it took 90 seconds to get to a failure. on sage.math the whole doctest takes 20 second.

Please also assign a milestone to all your tickets. In case of doctest failures it should be always the next release.

Cheers,

Michael

Hmm, any chance your improved pari.spkg from #258 is involved here?

May be you are right about some problem with my own version of
pari in #258, I could not reproduce the bug in a fresh install
of sage-2.9.3

I'll check further...
