The patch is fine, and does what it says, but it makes it look like printing a polynomial ring will give this verbose output:

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ,order=TermOrder('degrevlex',1)+TermOrder('lex',2)) 
sage: print P
Multivariate Polynomial Ring
Base Ring : Rational Field 
Size : 3 Variables 
Block  0 : Ordering : degrevlex 
```
That's *not* okay -- way too much by default!

Because I disagree with Nick's verdict, I forwarded this to [sage-devel]:

  http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/612b3ec4a61310fa

I figure, that this is more a design choice than a correctness issue and thus it should be discussed on [sage-devel] rather than here. I hope that's okay with you, Nick.
