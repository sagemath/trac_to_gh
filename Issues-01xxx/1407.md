Consider this:

```
sage: P.<a,b,c> = QQ[2^(1/2), 2^(1/3), 2^(1/5)]
sage: P.order([1,a])
*should* go boom very quickly... but runs forever and runs out of RAM
```

In the situation above, a satisfies only a quadratic polynomial so 
there is no possible way it will generate an order in a degree 8 field,
since the index [O_K : ZZ[a]] is clearly infinite.   Sage should
quickly detect this and give an error message, but doesn't for some
reason.
