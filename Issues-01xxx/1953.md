**Attachment:** [trac-1953.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1953/trac-1953.patch.gz)

I think this patch is OK.

I want to make one comment though.  With the previous version of this patch, if you made a new class that derives from CallableSymbolicExpressionRing_class and overload args, then arguments would automatically call the overloaded method.  Now it won't -- argument will give you the old method before overloading.  This isn't a problem since that's not done in calculus.py.  

So I give this a positive review.
