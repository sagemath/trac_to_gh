This spkg needs cmake-2.4.7.spkg (already in experimental), vtk-5.0.3.spkg, setuptools-0.6.spkg
and wxPython-2.8.7.1 (already in experimental as wxPython-linux-2.8.7.1.spk).

```
The following is working on Fedora 7/8 (and Ubuntu?):

 > Dependencies for Sage:
 >

 >   - http://www.wxpython.org wxPython-2.6.x or higher for the UI
 >   - vtk-5.0.3
 >   - setuptools-0.6b

1) Install wxPython-2.8.7.1:
    http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/SPKGS/MayaVi/wxPython-2.8.7.1.spkg

2) Install vtk-5.0.3:

    install cmake (also an experimental spkg):
    http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/SPKGS/MayaVi/cmake-2.4.7.spkg
    and
    http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/SPKGS/MayaVi/vtk-5.0.3.spkg

3) Install setuptools:
    http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/SPKGS/MayaVi/setuptools-0.6.spkg

4) Install mayavi_2.0.20080117.spkg
    http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/SPKGS/MayaVi/mayavi_2.0.20080117.spkg

```

This new spkg will install its dependencies automagically.

Eventually

```
./sage -i mayavi_2.0.20080117
```

will do the trick.

This experimental package could easily be included, I think.

Once this gets a positive review from some people trying it out, it will be posted to the sage official spkg webpage.
