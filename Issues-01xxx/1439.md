On a 1.8Ghz opteron (sagemath.org) it takes 18 minutes (I just tested 
the install).   I am completely baffled that it would take > 11 hours to
install into vmware under windows.  I'll look into that next time I get a
chance to use windows (in my office).   Thanks for reporting the problem.

That is very likely the problem.  The output of installing packages through
the notebook is way too verbose, so this is in fact a likely source of
the problem (which could be remedied).   Better would be to login as "manage"
and type "sage -i fricas-0.3.1".

Excellent.

Better would be to fix things so they work through the notebook well.

```

The fix would likely be to execute the update command, but pipe everything
to a file, and include a link to that file in the output (so one can look
at it and press refresh in the browser to test status).

This confirms my hypothesis...

```
Well,per your request, I logged in to the Sage VM and did
 sage -f fricas-0.3.1
simply hangs. However,
 sage -f axiom4sage-0.3.1
succeeds and shows a total time of
 real 18m42
or, if I include network time
 real 19.6
which is about the wall-clock time.

So there appears to be a suggestion that it might
be a good idea to do package installs directly rather
than thru the notebook interface. Potentially this
could be due to the large amount of screen output.

Apparently the package rename didn't work.
