```
When running sage -t cubegroup.py & (to run it in the background), the process is stopped.

This is caused by pexpect.sendeof() (called from rubik.py) calling termios.tcsetattr() on stdin which causes the process to be stopped with a SIGTTOU (=write to tty from a background process).

The pexpect.sendeof() function has been entirely changed in the current version of pexpect, and using that new sendeof() fixes this problem. So, updating to a newer pexpect (ticket #502) should fix this as well.
