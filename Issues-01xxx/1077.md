When a job times out, the worker restarts running two jobs.  This slows things down and is not natural.

And when one of those new jobs finishes, it performs a hard reset, killing the second job, which then never gets completed.

Yi, could you please provide a patch or bundle once 2.8.13 is out. If I try the bundle above it complains about unknown parent and it is unclear to me whether to apply the other bundle first.

Cheers,
