Well, perhaps this is know, but apropos the petition to make steps
4--6 of installation in OS X nicer, there are a very easy way. Simply
rename the sage script to sage.command. This way if you double-click
over it from finder it will be automatically launched inside a
Terminal session.

Saludos,
Rafa

P.D. I'm not a OSX guru, only a /bin/sh user in OSX landscape ;-)

One way to implement this is make it so sage -bdist on osx, in addition to just making  dmg, also does

```
 ln -s sage sage.command
```
in SAGE_ROOT right before making the dmg file.   This should just involve
adding one line to SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-bdist

Wow, I can't believe this ticket eluded detection for all this time.  Do we really need this now that we have the app bundle (even made all the time, thanks Jeroen!)?

Bye-bye.  Not that it isn't fun to have a symlink, but anyone who really needs this will either
   * download the app because they don't know how to do this
   * make a symlink themselves because they do.
