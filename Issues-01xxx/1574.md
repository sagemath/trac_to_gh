When applying a patch to a non `pyx|pxi|pxd` file (mwrank.cc in this case) and running `sage -b` odd things happen:

```

running install
running build
running build_py
running build_ext
building 'sage.libs.mwrank.mwrank' extension
error: unknown file type '.pyx' (from 'sage/libs/mwrank/mwrank.pyx')
sage: There was an error installing modified sage library code.

running install
running build
running build_py
running build_ext
building 'sage.libs.mwrank.mwrank' extension
error: unknown file type '.pyx' (from 'sage/libs/mwrank/mwrank.pyx')
sage: There was an error installing modified sage library code.
```
Touching a pyx file that the particular file depends upon (mwrank.pyx) in this case fixes the issue and everything is properly recompiled.

Cheers,

Michael

Anybody willing to fix this? It seems that all that needs to be done is to add C/C++ files linked extensions to the list of dependencies to track.
