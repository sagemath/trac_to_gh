 Andrzej Giniewicz reported:

```
 not counting plenty (281) warnings in file curvesort.cc (about
deprecated conversion from string constant to 'char*') I also get
WHOLE lot (about 8000) errors all in one nature:

../g0n/curvesort.cc:106: error: jump to case label
../g0n/curvesort.cc:105: error:   crosses initialization of 'int
<anonymous>[3]'

with different numbers only... problems starts from:

g++ -c -fPIC -g -O2 -DNEW_OP_ORDER -DUSE_PARI_FACTORING -I../include -
DNTL_ALL -I/opt/sage/local/include -I/opt/sage/local/include  tsat3.cc
-o tsat3_n.o
In file included from tsat3.cc:37:
../g0n/curvesort.cc ....... etc etc

I think there is no sense to attach such big report... I'm running
current Arch Linux, that is GCC 4.2.2, gLibc 2.7, kernel 2.6.23.8. Is
there some workaround?
