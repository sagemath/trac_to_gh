 Andrzej Giniewicz reported:

```
 not counting plenty (281) warnings in file curvesort.cc (about
deprecated conversion from string constant to 'char*') I also get
WHOLE lot (about 8000) errors all in one nature:

../g0n/curvesort.cc:106: error: jump to case label
../g0n/curvesort.cc:105: error:   crosses initialization of 'int
<anonymous>[3]'

with different numbers only... problems starts from:

g++ -c -fPIC -g -O2 -DNEW_OP_ORDER -DUSE_PARI_FACTORING -I../include -
DNTL_ALL -I/opt/sage/local/include -I/opt/sage/local/include  tsat3.cc
-o tsat3_n.o
In file included from tsat3.cc:37:
../g0n/curvesort.cc ....... etc etc

I think there is no sense to attach such big report... I'm running
current Arch Linux, that is GCC 4.2.2, gLibc 2.7, kernel 2.6.23.8. Is
there some workaround?

There is also an issue on OpenSuSE 10.2:

You mention that there is an issue with cremona.spkg on Linux/Itanium with
older gcc and also Solaris. My settings are:
