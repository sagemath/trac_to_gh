Docstring:

           Return chosen generator of the finite field.  This generator
           is a root of the defining polynomial of the finite field, and
           is guaranteed to be a generator for the multiplicative group.

(This is wrong because in this case the generator is not guaranteed to
be a generator for the multiplicative group.)

It looks like there's some randomness in `FiniteField_ext_pari(23^20, "b")`, such that the proposed doctests will often fail.  Here's one failure mode, with two failing doctests:

```
sage -t  devel/sage-review/sage/rings/finite_field_ext_pari.py**********************************************************************
File "finite_field_ext_pari.py", line 300:
    sage: F.gen().multiplicative_order() == F.order()-1
Expected:
    False
Got:
    True
**********************************************************************
File "finite_field_ext_pari.py", line 302:
    sage: F.multiplicative_generator()
Expected:
    b + 1
Got:
    b
**********************************************************************
```

And here's the other failure mode, with only one failing doctest:

```
sage -t  devel/sage-review/sage/rings/finite_field_ext_pari.py**********************************************************************
File "finite_field_ext_pari.py", line 302:
    sage: F.multiplicative_generator()
Expected:
    b + 1
Got:
    b + 14
**********************************************************************
```

And sometimes both tests pass.
