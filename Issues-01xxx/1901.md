Docstring:

           Return chosen generator of the finite field.  This generator
           is a root of the defining polynomial of the finite field, and
           is guaranteed to be a generator for the multiplicative group.

(This is wrong because in this case the generator is not guaranteed to
be a generator for the multiplicative group.)

It looks like there's some randomness in `FiniteField_ext_pari(23^20, "b")`, such that the proposed doctests will often fail.  Here's one failure mode, with two failing doctests:

```
sage -t  devel/sage-review/sage/rings/finite_field_ext_pari.py**********************************************************************
File "finite_field_ext_pari.py", line 300:
    sage: F.gen().multiplicative_order() == F.order()-1
Expected:
    False
Got:
    True
**********************************************************************
File "finite_field_ext_pari.py", line 302:
    sage: F.multiplicative_generator()
Expected:
    b + 1
Got:
    b
**********************************************************************
```

And here's the other failure mode, with only one failing doctest:

```
sage -t  devel/sage-review/sage/rings/finite_field_ext_pari.py**********************************************************************
File "finite_field_ext_pari.py", line 302:
    sage: F.multiplicative_generator()
Expected:
    b + 1
Got:
    b + 14
**********************************************************************
```

And sometimes both tests pass.

The second patch 8685.patch removes the doctests which are too random to be useful, and also adds to the docstring so that users are referred to multiplicative_generator() and warned that `_both_` are random.
