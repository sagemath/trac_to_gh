The attached patch has a number of goals.
1.  Allow shared members of ZZ and ZZ[x] to be used interchangeably in a dictionary.
2.  Replace ZZ in !#1 by QQ, IntegerModRing(p) and probably a bunch of other things.
3.  Replace ZZ[x] in !#1 by ZZ[x,y,...]
4.  Allow shared members of FractionFields and their base rings to be used interchangeably in a dictionary.
5.  Make the __hash__ function faster in polynomial rings

Goal !#5 was achieved very nicely for univariate poly rings, but __hash__ in QQ[x,y] was extremely fast in the original code.  Unfortunately, that very fast __hash__ violated all good things of the goals above.  It also wasn't asymptotically fast (think huge numerical coefficients).

The goals 1-4 above result in a fix for the subs method:

```
sage: R.<x,y>=ZZ[]
sage: (x/y).subs({x:1})
1/y  # produced x/y in the old version
```

A bad thing about this patch is that the results of hash(x) changing reorders the output of things that come from a dictionary.  There is a number of doc-tests output changes which are only a matter of order in the list.  I think this is probably bad style in doc-tests and in real life.  At least some of those outputs have a very natural order (to the human mind if not mathematically).

The attached patch entirely supersedes #1075 and I'm going to go close it right now.

<a id='comment:1'></a>Some benchmarks:

Original:

```
sage: R.<x>=ZZ[]
sage: one=R(1)
sage: f=x^2+2*x+1
sage: timeit hash(one)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.03 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit hash(f)
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.53 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit hash(x)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.91 Âµs per loop
sage: R.<x,y>=QQ[]
sage: one=R(1)
sage: f=x^2+2*y+1
sage: timeit hash(one)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 931 ns per loop
sage: timeit hash(f)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.86 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit hash(x)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 486 ns per loop
```

Patched:

```
sage: # first the success
sage: R.<x>=ZZ[]
sage: one=R(1)
sage: f=x^2+2*x+1
sage: timeit hash(one)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.04 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit hash(f)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.98 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit hash(x)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.4 Âµs per loop
sage: # second: the huge slowdown
sage: R.<x,y>=QQ[]
sage: one=R(1)
sage: f=x^2+2*y+1
sage: timeit hash(one)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.88 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit hash(f)
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.31 Âµs per loop
sage: timeit hash(x)
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.18 Âµs per loop
```

I believe (but haven't verified too much) that the big problem is converting coefficients to the base ring from the singular poly.  This should probably be optimized for a whole bunch of reasons other than hashing, which will carry over to hashing.
