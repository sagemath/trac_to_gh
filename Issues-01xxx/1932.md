I've checked this on a 10.5 PPC, 10.5 Intel, and a 10.4 Intel. David Roe tried it on a 10.4 Intel and got this slightly different traceback:

The error disappears if you try it in any other directory (or, at least, any I've found!). Any ideas?

It works with hg 0.9.4, but not with 0.9.5 on Ubuntu 7.10 on an AMD processor.

The 0.9.4 distributed with Ubuntu works fine.  The sage -hg version blows up like you have in the ticket.

I think it has to do with Python (hg is a python program) picking up
something in the local path.  A workaround is to change to another directory one
up and run the same command, e.g, 

```
   cd ..
   hg diff elliptic_curves/sha.py
```
works.

I'm not saying this isn't a bug though!

It creates a new `sha.py` which simply raises a `DeprecationWarning` with a reference to the new module, and this trac ticket. This should be applied now. Of course, since there is still a `sha.py` in the hg repository, it doesn't actually fix this bug. The second patch simply removes `sha.py` -- this should be applied one or two versions down the road (I don't know what our deprecation policy is), and **actually** fixes the problem.

positive review.  i had to tweak craig's first patch a bit (after checking with him) and i tried to just replace it but trac didn't like that.

i checked both the deprecation warning with the first patch, and the fact that the issue is completely resolved with the second patch (yay i can use hg in schemes/elliptic_curves/ again!)

so: apply trac-1932-pt1.2.patch now, and apply trac-1932-pt2.patch when the deprecation period is over.

Craig,

please open another ticket for trac-1932-pt2.patch since once I merge trac-1932-pt1.2.patch I will close this ticket. Add something like "merge by August 2009" to the subject so that we will merge this once we have waited six months (or whatever timeframe we come up with). Once that ticket is open it would be nice if you mentioned it here so that one can easily follow up. We might even want to add a deprecation milestone in trac for those tickets.

Cheers,

Michael
