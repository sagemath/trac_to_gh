```
Michael,

Can we add new machines to the ATLAS database of pre-tuned machines?
I ask, because my Thinkpad laptop -- a Pentium M, is taking literally
several *hours* to build ATLAS, which sucks.

William
```

I will look into this. I am also afraid that compiling ATLAS on PPC/Linux for example will be a rather long, painful experience, so we ought to get on top of this and submit profiles of those CPUs that are missing upstream.

Cheers,

Michael

There is an atlas.spkg with tuning information for Pentium M and Athlon MP added at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-2.10.1/rc5/atlas-3.8.p11.spkg

See also #1886.
