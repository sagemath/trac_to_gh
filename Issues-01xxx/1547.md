```
Michael,

Can we add new machines to the ATLAS database of pre-tuned machines?
I ask, because my Thinkpad laptop -- a Pentium M, is taking literally
several *hours* to build ATLAS, which sucks.

William
```

I will look into this. I am also afraid that compiling ATLAS on PPC/Linux for example will be a rather long, painful experience, so we ought to get on top of this and submit profiles of those CPUs that are missing upstream.

Cheers,

Michael
