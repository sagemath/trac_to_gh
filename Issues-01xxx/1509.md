```

Since axes_label is broken in plot(), one must resort to adding your
own custom labels to a plot().

It would be nice in this application, and others, if one could rotate
text objects.  For example, it
would be nice to be able to make a custom y-axis label that was
parallel to the y-axis.  I guess,
in general, the ability to rotate text would be a useful feature.

```

For Sage, make sure to look up how Mathematica does text rotation, etc.,
and use that interface instead of making something up at random.

I tried to download it and got a strange method. I guess it is not an hg patch but a diff?

Also, did you include an example in the docstring to illustrate your new feature?

Sorry, I'm new to sage dev practices...is there documentation on generating a standard patch?  I used diff to generate the attached patch.

I didn't include an example usage in the docstrings, but did include explanation of the feature.  I'll update the docstring accordingly and update the patch.
