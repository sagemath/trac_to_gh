```
[04:56] <mabshoff> william_stein: #740 seems to create different results in various places, i.e. doc test failures.
[04:56] <william_stein> hmmm
[04:57] <mabshoff> File "tut.py", line 1676:
[04:57] <mabshoff>     : EllipticCurve(5)
[04:57] <mabshoff> Expected:
[04:57] <mabshoff>     Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y  = x^3 + 36/1723*x + 1/1723
[04:57] <mabshoff>                 over Rational Field
[04:57] <mabshoff> Got:
[04:57] <mabshoff>     Elliptic Curve defined by y^2  = x^3 + 25845*x - 29687290 over Rational Field
[04:57] <william_stein> mabshoff -- not surprising.
[04:57] <william_stein> NOBODY has doctested testall after applying that.
[04:57] <mabshoff> ok
[04:57] <william_stein> The new output in tut.py is right, by the way.
[04:57] <mabshoff> :)
[04:57] <william_stein> It's a different curve with that j-invariant -- a better one.
```
Patch coming up.

Cheers,

Michael
