I propose the following strategy for factor(integer):

1. do trial division by all primes up to say 1000. This can be done efficiently by a single gcd with the product of all those primes.
2. use GMP-ECM, starting from say B1=100, and increasing B1 by sqrt(B1) at each step, until one reaches the _recommended_B1_list value which corresponds to 1/3 of the size of the number to be factored. Thus for a 90-digit input, one will stop at B1=250000.
3. try GMP-ECM P-1 and P+1 with respectively 9*B1 and 3*B1 where B1 is the last value tried for ECM. The corresponding cost of those runs will be approximately the same as the last ECM curve, thus this will not slow down the average computation, and might find a few factors.
4. run MPQS or GNFS. You might want to issue a warning to the user (if called from toplevel) at that time.

This proposal is absolutely correct. It is *exactly* what I would do,
with one exception. I would not issue a warning that MPQS is going to
start, unless the factorisation is over say 70 digits (~90s).

I've just discussed this with Paul Zimmerman and here is what we should do (eventually):

1) Trial factoring for primes up to ~1000
2) SQUFOF for numbers up to ~32-40 bits (use the fast implementation in FLINT - it's 4x faster than anything else)
3) Pollard Rho if we have an efficient implementation
4) tinyQS in FLINT *if* the number of digits is small enough, i.e. if that is going to be faster than GMP-ECM (we have to profile this to determine the cutoff)
5) GMP-ECM with bound up to n^(1/3)
6) p-1 and p+1 with large bound (it works rarely, but saves MPQS if it happens to work - the runtime compared to MPQS is *tiny*)
7) MPQS up to ~90 digits if large prime variant, ~100 digits if double large prime variant or ~130 digits if triple large prime variant QS
8) GNFS 
9) You are the NSA, so you know what to do.

Apply first: #5945, #5310

Patch makes use of SQUFOF, ecmfactor, cunningham_table and sympy.factorint.

To pass all tests cunningham database should become a standard package or the warning in cunningham_tables.py should be removed.

To evalutate run attachment:evaluate_1145.sage

This should also fix #9463.

I know that it's waiting on #5310, but your patch is doubled: you exported to a file that already contained the patch.  Also, we should figure out how to merge these factoring improvements with those in #12125 and #12133; it shouldn't be too hard.

A couple other comments: you should use the `perfect_power` method of Integers rather than writing your own base_exponent, and you should pass on the `use_pollard` parameter when you recurse.
