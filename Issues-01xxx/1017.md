It's terribly convenient to be able to write:

```
solutions=solve([x^2+y^2 == 1, y^2 == x^3 + x + 1], x, y, solution_dict=True);
for solution in solutions: 
    print solution[x].n(digits=3), ",", solution[y].n(digits=3)
```

to print out a list of the solutions or to refer back to the solved values.  This patch implements a naive approach to solution_dict.

**Attachment:** [solution_dict.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1017/solution_dict.patch.gz)

patch is no longer a partial patch.

I just noticed one modification.

```
sol_list_dict=blah
return sol_list_dict
```
could be shortened to

```
return blah
```

I meant, in the last part of the patch:

```
sol_dict=blah
return sol_dict
```
could be shortened to

```
return blah
```
