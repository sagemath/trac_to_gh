On a loaded machine ATLAS tends to report the following

```
VARIATION EXCEEDS TOLERENCE, RERUN WITH HIGHER REPS.
```
It then errors out:

```
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21)
gcc -V 2>&1  >> bin/INSTALL_LOG/ERROR.LOG

make[6]: [error_report] Error 1 (ignored)
gcc --version 2>&1  >> bin/INSTALL_LOG/ERROR.LOG
tar cf error_HAMMER64SSE3.tar Make.inc bin/INSTALL_LOG/*

make[4]: Leaving directory `/home/rlmill/sage-2.9.rc2/spkg/build/atlas-3.8.p5/ATLAS-build/bin'
Error report error_<ARCH>.tgz has been created in your top-level ATLAS
directory.  Be sure to include this file in any help request.
cat: ../../CONFIG/error.txt: No such file or directory
cat: ../../CONFIG/error.txt: No such file or directory


IN STAGE 1 INSTALL:  SYSTEM PROBE/AUX COMPILE
```
But the build of Sage goes on and fails down the road.

Cheers,
