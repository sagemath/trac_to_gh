<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

copy from the sage-devel group:

I have been sitting on this code for too long, so I think it would fit
in Sage's philosophy to release early, to include it in the next
version of Sage. Here is my current version:

http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~rkirov2/sage/graph_editor.zip

it contains a diff patch for Sage devel and two files which need to go
"$SAGE_ROOT/local/notebook/javascript/graph_editor" (create that
folder). Sage/local is not under mercurial so I can't add it to the
patch.

now to get the graph editor just type (in notebook):

sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: graph_editor(G)

comments:
1) Update button is really ungraceful but i couldn't figure out how to
send the data behind the scene to the Sage server (as the server so
far is made to communicate only with the cells). So now it just dumps
the data in the cell it was called and leaves it to the user to
execute the update.

2)The graph_editor opens in an iframe, so if you grad a node out of
the whole frame, it stops tracking it (this can be probably fixed with
some major JS hack). However, now it detects you left the iframe and
returns the vertex to its original position.

3) This works only for simple graphs for now.

any suggestions, comments, especially code corrections are welcome 

Rado

A minor suggestion:  Please try transposing the last two lines of `mouseReleased()` to, e.g.,

```
    dragged_node = null;
    last_click_time = millis();
    redraw();
    }
  if(!LIVE) noLoop();
}

class Edge {
```
I think this will solve the problem of "high" CPU use after
* Turning on the live feature.
* Turning off the live feature.
* Clicking on the canvas to add a new node.

I've made the patches and files themselves available. This will make review/discussion easier.

On top of a fresh copy of Sage-4.1.1, I:

1. Applied the patch to the library. There was a rejected hunk, which I fixed, and posted the modified patch as `trac_1321-graph_editor-rebased-4.1.1.patch`. (Since the original patch was not an `hg` patch, my name got put on the patch when I exported it. We'll need to fix this so that Rado gets proper credit.)

2. Copied the html and js files to `$SAGE_ROOT/local/notebook/javascript/graph_editor`, after creating this directory.

3. Rebuilt Sage and tried it out.

REFEREE COMMENTS:

1. This only works from within the notebook, if you run it on a command line it just spits out some HTML. The variable `EMBEDDED_MODE` is used to tell whether this is the case or not. We should do something more intelligent for the command line case.

2. When you update, it always defines the graph `G`, even if that was not the graph you were actually using. You can get Python to tell you the variable name used somehow, but at the moment I forget.

3. Also, when you update, it defines the graph as capital `G`, and then sets the position of lowercase `g`. This gives an error when it is actually evaluated.

4. Finally, the js file seems particularly averse to whitespace. This looks like the result of some obfuscation program or something... Can I suggest we format it a little better?

5. Instead of `graph_editor(G)`, we should probably organize it as `G.edit()` or `G.graph_editor()` or something like that.

6. I really like this, and I want to see it merged ASAP!!!

Thanks for reviewing my editor. Sorry for the late reply, I totally forgot to look at Trac and was waiting on google group thread. I will try to fix the small bugs this weekend and if I have time rewrite some of the js code in pure js, instead of the processing.js fake-java.

>1. This only works from within the notebook, if you run it on a command line it just spits out some HTML. The variable EMBEDDED_MODE is used to tell whether this is the case or not. We should do something more intelligent for the command line case.

This should be easy to fix.

>2. When you update, it always defines the graph G, even if that was not the graph you were actually using. You can get Python to tell you the variable name used somehow, but at the moment I forget.

I couldn't figure how to do that either, not sure if it is even posible. Probably will try my luck with Stackoverflow.

>3. Also, when you update, it defines the graph as capital G, and then sets the position of lowercase g. This gives an error when it is actually evaluated.

That is an easy fix

>4. Finally, the js file seems particularly averse to whitespace. This looks like the result of some obfuscation program or something... Can I suggest we format it a little better?

The js file is not writen by me. Its processing.js with on line modification by me, it lacks whitespace because its should load faster that way, and it is not intended to be further modified (think of it as a graphics library).

>5. Instead of graph_editor(G), we should probably organize it as G.edit() or G.graph_editor() or something like that.

Shouldn't be hard, have to see which file to edit.

>6. I really like this, and I want to see it merged ASAP!!! 

Awesome, that makes two of us. Btw, thanks for fixing my patch. I am still struggling with hg.

ok, attached is the new version.

1) Polished update button, which is now a save button. There is a text cell where the user can enter the name they want to give to the graph. Save is done automatically when button is clicked (no more shift+enter necessary)

2) Turned off the sliders for the live, there is some kind of bug with jqueryui in SAGE. Not sure what, but they were not terribly useful.

3) The processing JS code is moved over to pure JS (instead of the bizarre parsed java). Also now it has its own separate file "graphed.js".

The new patch should be ran on top of the old one.

This looks stable and useful enough now to be merged with one change.

Most all of Robert Miller's comments have been addressed favorably.  I'm of two minds about `G.edit()` versus `graph_editor(G)`, its the latter now.

There needs to be a limit on the size of a graph, so that is one needed addition.

You probably want to create one final set of patches and files, with clear directions on where each goes, the current state is a bit confusing.  Start patch files with  `trac_1321_xxx` and end with `.patch`

Positive review once a size limit goes in.  This will be a really, really nice addition!

I've attached patches to the [sage](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1321/trac_1321-sage_graphed.patch.gz) and [sagenb](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1321/trac_1321-sagenb_graphed.patch.gz) repositories that should enable the graph editor in 4.3.alpha0.  The sagenb patch "depends" on the sagenb patches at #3895 and #7495 --- the latter precede the #1321 patch in my queue and also modify `twist.py`.

Unfortunately, this is about as far as I have time now and in the near future to take this.  But please verify that it works and feel free to make any changes and suggestions!  Some possibilities:

* Finish the docstrings in `graph_editor.py`.  Actually, this is a necessity.

* Add an option to make "Save" send the [position] data to the server but not populate the input cell?

* Use [JSON](http://json.org/js.html) to pass common graph data structures between the browser and Sage?  For example,

```
import json
g_json = json.dumps(g.networkx_graph().adj)
print g_json
gg = Graph(json.loads(g_json))
```
We could then use `JSON.parse` in the browser to reconstitute a graph, retaining loops, directed edges, labels, etc., and similarly for colorings, etc.  (`JSON.stringify` would work in the opposite direction.)

Attachment: **[trac_1321-sage_graphed_v3.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket1321/trac_1321-sage_graphed_v3.patch.gz)**

Version 3, somewhat experimental:

* Adds a keyword option `graph_name` (the default is `None`).  By default, the function attempts to guess the name of the graph.  But it can be useful to be explicit.

* Adds a keyword option `replace_input` (the default is `True`).  If this is `False`, clicking "Save" quietly evaluates the current cell with the updated `Graph`, but it preserves the cell's input (as of when "Save" was clicked).  Currently, we do this by temporarily replacing the input, evaluating the cell, restoring the input, resaving the input, and resizing the cell.  We definitely need a more direct way to do this (even more direct than calling `async_request(worksheet_command('eval'),...)`).

An example:

```
g5 = graphs.TetrahedralGraph()
graph_editor(g5, replace_input=False, graph_name='g5_mod')
```
After clicking "Save", we can evaluate, e.g.,

```
show(g5_mod)
```
in another cell.
