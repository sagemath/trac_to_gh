The patch
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/patches/linear_codes20071124.hg
contains a new functions zeta_polynomial, weight_enumerator, 
chinen_polynomial, is_equivalent (for binary codes); an improved 
best_known_code; many pythonic revisions (suggested by William Stein 
long ago). Also, there are some minor docstring improvements. 
None of these are major improvements but I have a student working
on Duursma zeta functions of self-dual codes and these will be useful 
for her.

Component: **coding theory**

Feedback: The changes all seem good, but I have a suggestion for further improvement. As you are probably well aware, any call like gap.eval(blablahblah) takes a lot of time, because of pseudo-tty. There are several places in the code where you are calling several gap.eval's within an inner loop. It seems like a much better idea to form one large string of GAP code, which includes the loop, and calling gap.eval on the large string exactly once. One example is the loop starting on line 963, linear_codes.py. (I know this will soon be replaced anyway, but it's a good example of unnecessary pseudo-tty lag.)

Also, there are some doctest issues, resulting in a negative review for now.

The first doctest failure seems to be an error in the way GAP is calling Leon's code. The directory mentioned in the documentation is
`SAGEHOME/local/lib/gap*/guava*`
but the guava code is installed in
`SAGEHOME/local/lib/gap*/pkg/guava*`

1. To the best of my knowledge, the doctest failures are not the result of bad programming in this patch. They are because Leon's code, included with guava, is not compiled. It used to be that one could modify the spkg install file in SAGE's standard GAP package to try to fix this problem. Now the mechanism is different and I don't know why Leon's code is not compiled. 
The docstring typo mentioned above has been fixed.

2. "There are several places in the code where you are calling several gap.eval's within an inner loop." Agreed. I spent even more time trying to remove these calls. I did modify several two functions along these lines but don't know if they are any faster.
(a) I don't see how to without rewriting the GAP code. 
(b) Except for the example above, there were only one or 2 other places where gap.eval 
occurred in a loop. In those two cases, I tried to rewrite the code (I've tried before as well) 
but possibly not entirely successful. I don't see a tremendous savings anyway, since the loops are usually over the dimension and the computation inside the loop is growing exponentially with the dimension anyway...
(c) For the example above, I see not point in trying to speed it up since (a) I think it is buggy, (b) Robert Miller's code is hundreds of times faster and will be replacing it very soon. 
It is good to have for testing purposes though.

3. There was a mistake in the patch with the implementation of Chinen zeta polynomials. That has been fixed. 

The patch is at
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/patches/linear-codes20071210.hg
and modified file at

From IRC:

```
[2:48pm] was-1258: rlm -- after applying 1258 the doctests for linear_code.py take 93 seconds on sage.math!
[2:48pm] was-1258: unacceptable.
...
[2:48pm] was-1258: line 1062 takes a long time.
...
[2:49pm] was-1258: line 1280
[2:49pm] was-1258: line 1333
[2:49pm] was-1258: 1757
[2:49pm] was-1258: 352 takes very long.
```

Computations taking longer than about 10 seconds or so should be marked # long time, so that the doctester knows to skip them unless you do `./sage -t -long`. Also, computations taking longer than a minute or two are probably not suitable for doctesting.
