We propose to generate a full list of packages that Sage uses (with links to documentation - see #27495)
for the reference manual from information in `build/pkgs`.

1. If other sources have better information than what is in `build/pkgs`, update `build/pkgs` accordingly. (See https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageWiki)

   - https://github.com/sagemath/website/blob/master/conf/packages.yaml (which is used for generating http://www.sagemath.org/links-components.html)
   - https://wiki.sagemath.org/spkg (another incomplete list of packages)

2. Create a script that formats the information as .rst 

3. Delete the obsolete other sources.

I guess it is `≤` somewhere in the text.


```
1005	Chapter 45.
1006	! Missing $ inserted.
1007	<inserted text> 
1008	                $

```


This one?

```
$ grep -R "≤" src/doc/
src/doc/en/reference/spkg/database_jones_numfield.rst:≤6.
```


So one would need to modify this package, don't know how.
