There are some inconsistencies between PolyBoRi's original interface and Sage's Cython-based reimplementation. 

There were uncovered by the newly introduced self-testing feature of the PolyBoRi-shell `ipbori`. Call `ipbori -t` with #12655 installed to see the issue.

Cython interface consistent with PolyBoRi's built-in interface

For sage-5.0.beta7 (with #12655) the patch applies and tests well (`make ptestlong`) on a SuSE Enterprise 11 AMD64.

Also works with plain sage-5.0.beta7 (without #12655).

Patch looks good, applies cleanly and passes doctests.
