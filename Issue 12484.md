There are some inconsistencies between PolyBoRi's original interface and Sage's Cython-based reimplementation. 

There were uncovered by the newly introduced self-testing feature of the PolyBoRi-shell `ipbori`. Call `ipbori -t` with #12655 installed to see the issue.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12656
