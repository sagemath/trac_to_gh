# Issue 24779: Add PyCygwin as a standard package

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25016

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-03-20 16:49:10

Keywords: cygwin pycygwin

Adds [PyCygwin](https://github.com/embray/PyCygwin) as a standard package, though only actually _installed_ on Cygwin.

This is a little project I've been working on off-and-on to provide Python binding's for Cygwin's C-level API.  It's far from complete but I made an initial release since I would like to have even this small amount of functionality for fixing a few Cygwin-related issues in Sage.

Looking at your upstream sources, this reminds that we should work with Cython upstream to improve the build/packaging of Cython projects.

There is some strange indendation in `build/make/deps`.

Indeed, I actually have an open issue for that on Cython (just search "build_cython" in their github) but I haven't pursued it lately.

Indeed, I had spaces when the other lines begin with tabs.  Doesn't really matter in that particular case but fixed anyway.

Nope. Still not fixed. Ugh, I hate tabs.

This is obviously fine given that it only affects cygwin.
