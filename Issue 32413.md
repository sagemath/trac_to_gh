Great question. In this code:

```

```

it would probably be good to use `try...except` around the import and return a `False` test result if `sage.misc.latex` is not available.

(note to myself: I just noticed that `have_latex` should be updated in `src/sage/doctest/external.py` to use features as well.)

A request on the Cygwin mailing list to package pdf2svg
was answered as follows:

- https://cygwin.com/pipermail/cygwin/2021-November/250061.html

> The pdf2svg home page recommends instead pdftocairo
> from the poppler package, which does the same and
> is maintained as part of the package, rather than
> being a standalone utility which integrates the two,
> and is not as well maintained:
>

That suggests `pdftocairo --svg file.pdf`
will transform `file.pdf` to `file.svg`.

It seems poppler is widely packaged:
