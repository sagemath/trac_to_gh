```
sage:R.<x>=RR[]
sage:f=-15.7724132052927*x^3 + 275.964230612533*x^2 - 1609.26342508113*x + 3127.78392476122
sage:g=2.34170721896176*x^3 - 41.4239781372561*x^2 + 244.135506079109*x - 479.217021253382
sage:t0=5.7642108710894
sage:t=5.764766515597
sage:numerical_integral(sqrt(diff(f)^2+diff(g)^2),t0,t)
(nan,nan)
```


It works if the first line is changed to

```
sage:var('x')
```


then the output is:

```
sage:numerical_integral(sqrt(diff(f)^2+diff(g)^2),t0,t)
(1.031355273859612e-06, 8.669172196746942e-20)
```


I'm using sage version 9.0 under Arch Linux
My version of gsl is 2.6

Moving tickets to milestone sage-9.2 based on a review of last modification date, branch status, and severity.

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.
