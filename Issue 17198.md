Fixed. The problem was that under certain circumstances, the computation `c = a - b` has put the *negative* of a term of `a` into `c`, where it should have put a copy of the term.

Now the tests work. I also included a comparison with the letterplace implementation of free associative algebras. Letterplace is faster, but it is restricted to homogeneous elements.

I did two changes:

- I implemented a kill list for terms. It has not as much impact as I originally thought, so, maybe it makes sense to revert that change. However, when I did some c-profiling, a small improvement was visible.
- In the multiplication of path algebra elements, I did far more term comparisons than needed. Actually (again by c-profiling) I found that half of the time was spent on the comparisons. In the latest commit, I avoid some comparisons by book keeping.

Now, at least according to few benchmarks, the arithmetic for path algebra elements is faster than the arithmetic for both available implementations of free associative algebra elements (one of them, letterplace, is available for homogeneous elements only). Hence, in the long run, it might be worth while to implement free associative algebras as quiver algebras!

At least with `git-rerere` enabled, the dependency merges cleanly into the branch. So, no merge commit this time...

I just noticed that the letterplace implementation leaks in the following example:

```
sage: L.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(GF(25,'t'), implementation='letterplace')
sage: p = x^4+x*y*x*z+2*z^2*x*y
sage: while 1:
....:     print get_memory_usage()
....:     z = p^7
```

The corresponding example with path algebras does not leak (one only sees that the kill list fills up in the first few iterations):

```
sage: P = DiGraph({1:{1:['x','y','z']}}).path_semigroup().algebra(GF(25,'t'))
sage: p = sage_eval('x+y*z*x+2*y-z+1', P.gens_dict())
sage: while 1:
....:     print get_memory_usage()
....:     z = p^7
```

That might explain why letterplace is slower than path algebras. In any case, fixing the leak should be the purpose of another ticket.

I have changed my operating system from openSUSE 12.3 32bit to openSUSE 13.2 64bit. Doing so, I found that one doctest depended on the bits. So, I fixed that.

Something else: While the change from 32bit to 64bit did not make letterplace faster, the timings for my implementation improved by as much as 20%! So, I am looking forward to my applications `:-)`.

Concerning timings: Is it ok to include timings into the docs? After all, they are on a particular machine etc. Is there a policy? If so, I could remove the corresponding parts from `sage.quivers.algebra_elements`.

According to [Nathann's comment on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/OdUGcRTtWc4), including timings is ok, as long as the timings are consistent on different machines.

In this case, on openSUSE 32bit, arithmetic for path algebra elements is faster than arithmetic for letterplace free algebra elements, which is much faster than arithmetic for the default implementation of free algebra elements. On openSUSE 64bit, it is the same ranking; while letterplace is not faster in 64bit than in 32bit, the path algebra implementation becomes 20% faster in this example.

Of course, the purpose of the three implementations is different:

The letterplace implementation only allows to deal with homogeneous elements, but in contrast to the default implementation for free algebras it comes with standard basis computations, allowing to construct graded algebra quotients.

Path algebras are more general then free associative algebras, and homogeneity is not required. At the moment, standard bases are not available---but in fact this should be the next step. I plan to finish implementing a non-commutitive F5 algorithm, which can compute standard bases for one and two-sided ideals of modules over path algebra quotients (in particular, of ideals in path algebras, so that one can deal with algebra quotients), provided of course that the computation terminates in finite time. And moreover, it will be able to compute minimal generating sets of modules over basic algebras.

So, in the long run, it might make sense to replace the current default implementation of free algebra elements, modelling free associative algebras as a special case of path algebras. But that's for future. I hope that for now the comment on the relation of the three implementations is fine.

I am afraid it happened again. This time, `Py_NEW` won't work any longer, since a cythoned class is now not a type any longer (if I understand correctly).

In addition to that, I'd like to change a couple of things that are related with my upcoming application (F5 algorithm for path algebras), namely a framework to use Schreyer orderings. They may be useful when computing Syzygies (as experience in the commutative case shows). Let `I_i` be the i-th generator of a two-sided free module, and `a*I_i*b` be a monomial (paths a, b). A Schreyer ordering is given by choosing, for each i, a path s_i, and then comparison of `a*I_i*b` and `c*I_j*d` involves a comparison of the paths `a*s_i*b` and `c*s_j*d`.

I believe such a change belongs here (even though the applications do not appear here).

Hello,

I am not able to do a serious technical review (cython..), but I am happy enough with what I understand, and the bot gives a green light. So I am ready to give a positive review, if you are satisfied with this rather superficial check.

One minor point: I would prefer to have a bigger example for the latex method, where \cdot appears.

That's to say, I expected that realloc is faster than dealloc followed by alloc.

OK, some general advice just from the top of my head:
1. Most importantly, be consistent: try not to assign a `long` to an `int`, make sure that loop counters and loop bounds have the same type.
2. In most cases, `long` is a good type to use.
3. Use `int` only if you know for theoretical reasons that the value must be small (say, at most `2^31 - 1`). There is no theoretical reason why a reference counter cannot be `2^32`, so `int` is not the right type for that. An `int` is usually good for booleans or for enumerating several possibilities.
4. Use `Py_ssize_t` for lengths and sizes of Python objects.
5. Use `size_t` for lengths and sizes of non-Python objects and of memory chunks. Note that this is an *unsigned* type.

This

```
predec(kill_list.nterms)
```

is just an obscure way of writing

```
kill_list.nterms -= 1
```

so why not use the latter?

In order to be consistent, I will change the types referring to the degree of a monomial to mp_size_t. Rationale: The degree of a monomial is the length of a path, and the length of a path currently IS mp_size_t.

Unfortunately, this rationale leads me to be inconsistent in another regards:

A monomial is of the form `a*I*b`, where `I` is a generator of a free two-sided module, `a` is the left cofactor, and `b` is the right cofactor (both cofactors are paths); OR ALTERNATIVELY, it is simply of the form `a`, making it an element of the path algebra and not of a module over the path algebra.

The current encoding is: If `.mid==-1` then we have an element of the path algebra. Otherwise, `.mid` is equal to the length of the path `a`.

Hence, by the above rationale, `.mid` should be mp_size_t. But by the encoding, it must be able to assume the value -1.

Perhaps it would be better to change the encoding: `.mid` should be replaced by `.l_length`, which is mp_size_t and denotes the length of the left cofactor. Instead, I should either introduce a new component, say `bint in_algebra`, or I should change `.pos` to `long`, saying that if `.pos` is negative then the monomial belongs to a path algebra (not to a proper module over a path algebra), and if it is non-negative then `.pos` denotes the summand of a free module in which the monomial lives. The latter is the current meaning of `.pos`.

What do you think is better? I think using `.pos` makes sense: It tells us where the monomial lives, either in a summand of a free module, or in a path algebra.

Note that all the encoding only becomes relevant in the F5 algorithm for modules over path algebras that I am currently preparing.

I think I have now addressed all remarks by Jeroen, with only exception the sig_check/on/off issue. 
Thanks a lot, Jeroen!

Actually the timings from comment:62 have now improved, in particular for multiplication, which involves a lot of allocation (and perhaps reallocation) and comparison of terms:

```
sage: P = DiGraph({1:{1:['x','y','z']}}).path_semigroup().algebra(GF(25,'t'))
sage: P.inject_variables()
Defining e_1, x, y, z
sage: %timeit p = x^4+x*y*x*z+2*z^2*x*y
The slowest run took 24.13 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
10000 loops, best of 3: 20.2 µs per loop
## Was: 20.7 µs
sage: %timeit p = x^4+x*y*x*z+2*z^2*x*y
100000 loops, best of 3: 18.9 µs per loop
## Was: 21.2 µs
sage: p = x^4+x*y*x*z+2*z^2*x*y
sage: %timeit q = p^7
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.06 ms per loop
## Was: 1.69 ms
```


I'll take care of sig_check later, and also of Frédéric's advices.

I have yet another question about sig_on/off/check.

Assume that f is a cython function that calls another cython function g in a tight loop. First of all, is it correct that there is no point in using sig_... if there is no "except" value given for f and g?

Now assume that both f and g are declared with an except value (or return a Python object). Should one have

```
cdef int g(...) except -1:
    <do something>
    return ...
cdef int f(...) except -1:

```

or

```
cdef int g(...) except -1:
    sig_check()
    <do something>
    return ...
cdef int f(...) except -1:

I have tested that the following code can be interrupted:

```
sage: cython("""
....: include "sage/ext/interrupt.pxi"
....: cdef int test1(int a) except -1:
....:     cdef int i
....:     for i in range(a):

....: """)
sage: test2(5)
^C
Traceback (most recent call last):

So, I will put sig_check/on/off mainly into "small" functions (that of course need to declare an except value) that are frequently called, and will not put it into the caller functions (unless of course there is further code in the caller function that can't be interrupted).

Just some quick comments, I don't have much time.

> it was said to put sig_on/_off around potentially expensive calls to C-functions.
Here, I really meant C functions in an external library that you don't have control over, for pure Cython code, you usually don't need `sig_on`/`sig_off`. Does this clarify things?

> OK, I'll remove the "inline" from any function that is more than three lines. Do you think that's a reasonable rule of thumb?
I think it's difficult to give a rule of thumb. It mostly depends on what the function does. I think a better rule of thumb is: functions which are simple and don't take much time. If you really want to be sure: profile!

> Hence, by the above rationale, .mid should be mp_size_t. But by the encoding, it must be able to assume the value -1.
These conditions do not contradict each other (`mp_size_t` is signed), so there is no problem here.

> Do I need sage -ba?
You should *never* need `sage -ba`. Anytime you do need it, that's a bug in the build system. Just use `make`.

To test with #18927, I'd make a new private branch where you merge the branch of this ticket and the branch of #18927.

For `sig_check`, you just have to ensure that `sig_check` is called often enough in every possible code path. I.e. it should not be possible that your code runs a whole second without ever calling `sig_check`. So, as a rule of thumb: put `sig_check` inside every loop, which corresponds to your third proposal.

In the new commit, I have tried to address the sig_on/off/check issue. I took care to make many boilerplate functions (some of them in sage.data_structures) interruptible. Then, when using these functions in higher level functions, it is not needed to put sig_check again. However, to be on the safe side, often I put additional sig_checks at the beginning of loops.

I elaborate a lot more on what each boilerplate function does, by putting comments in front of each function.

I fixed the problem with the parent of "X/4" that Frédéric found in comment:73. Yet to be fixed is the problem with degree_on_basis.

I checked that the timings are still as good as they used to be (hence, all the signal checking did not make it slower).

I also checked that

```
sage: P = DiGraph({Integer(1):{Integer(1):['x','y','z']}}).path_semigroup().algebra(GF(Integer(25),'t'))
sage: P.inject_variables()
Defining e_1, x, y, z
sage: p = x^4+x*y*x*z+2*z^2*x*y
sage: while 1:
....:     p = p*p
....:     
```

is interruptible. Also I could interrupt determining the string representation of a large element.

And of course I checked that all tests in sage.quivers and also in sage.data_structures pass.

OK. But nonetheless, I believe the encoding should better be in .pos, not in .l_len (formerly .mid), since ultimately what we are encoding is the "position" of the monomial in a module/path algebra.

I think I have put sig_check in all code paths, because it is in all (or at least most) interruptible boilerplate functions, and additionally is used in loops of higher level functions.

Why does CombinatorialFreeModule expect that elements have a public attribute _monomial_coefficients? That's an implementation detail that a generic implementation must not rely on. It can certainly assume that there is `X.monomial_coefficients()` as a method---but not a private (i.e. underscore) attribute!

I am not going to fix that bug in CombinatorialFreeModule---that's not really my world, as I prefer the "classical" way of implementing algebraic structures.

As a work-around, I may override the .sum() method.

Done.

I believe that the usage of `Element._monmial_coefficients` for methods of `CombinatorialFreeModule` should be replaced by `Element.monomial_coefficients()`, but that's of course not the job of this ticket.

Right, exception handling adds an overhead. Perhaps one could say that I should add exception handling and sig_check() in functions that are sufficiently complicated (and contain a loop), so that there is the possibility that they run long enough to catch a Ctrl-C?

Is it not the case that sig_check adds less overhead than sig_on/off? At least this is how I understood what's written in the developer guide. The developer guide seems to suggest to use them for different purposes.

IIRC, is is

```
git checkout <commit> <file>

Concerning "inline", I read in several sources that inline should be done on SMALL functions that are called OFTEN.

But I am not sure what is small. I guess what counts here is the size of the C-code generated by Cython. For example, I removed the "inline" from bitset_init, because I expected that the error handling bloats the C-code, and because I thought that bitset_init is called less often than bitset manipulation functions. The C-code is

```C
static int __pyx_f_4sage_15data_structures_6bitset_bitset_init(struct __pyx_t_4sage_15data_structures_6bitset_bitset_s *__pyx_v_bits, mp_bitcnt_t __pyx_v_size) {
  int __pyx_r;
  __Pyx_RefNannyDeclarations
  int __pyx_t_1;
  PyObject *__pyx_t_2 = NULL;
  int __pyx_lineno = 0;
  const char *__pyx_filename = NULL;
  int __pyx_clineno = 0;
  __Pyx_RefNannySetupContext("bitset_init", 0);
  __pyx_t_1 = ((__pyx_v_size <= 0) != 0);
  if (__pyx_t_1) {
    __pyx_t_2 = __Pyx_PyObject_Call(__pyx_builtin_ValueError, __pyx_tuple_, NULL); if (unlikely(!__pyx_t_2)) {__pyx_filename = __pyx_f[0]; __pyx_lineno = 79; __pyx_clineno = __LINE__; goto __pyx_L1_error;}
    __Pyx_GOTREF(__pyx_t_2);
    __Pyx_Raise(__pyx_t_2, 0, 0, 0);
    __Pyx_DECREF(__pyx_t_2); __pyx_t_2 = 0;
    {__pyx_filename = __pyx_f[0]; __pyx_lineno = 79; __pyx_clineno = __LINE__; goto __pyx_L1_error;}
  }
  __pyx_v_bits->size = __pyx_v_size;
  __pyx_v_bits->limbs = (((__pyx_v_size - 1) / (8 * (sizeof(mp_limb_t)))) + 1);
  __pyx_v_bits->bits = ((mp_limb_t *)sage_calloc(__pyx_v_bits->limbs, (sizeof(mp_limb_t))));
  __pyx_t_1 = ((__pyx_v_bits->bits == NULL) != 0);
  if (__pyx_t_1) {
    PyErr_NoMemory(); {__pyx_filename = __pyx_f[0]; __pyx_lineno = 85; __pyx_clineno = __LINE__; goto __pyx_L1_error;}
  }
```

Is that "long"? I think so. Thus, better not inline.

It's not useless to put `sig_check()` in the beginning of a function. I think it does not matter much, since the code will eventually call `sig_check()` (in a different function) which will catch the interrupt.

Replying to [comment:123 jdemeyer]:
> In short, I would prefer to revert all changes to bitset/biseq.

I didn't revert all changes, but most of them. Also I changed the signal handling according to your advices.

These changes did hardly change the timings for the few examples that I did. As mentioned in comment:136, profiling indicated that I should use more care for deallocation resp. for the freelist. I did as follows:

1. The freelist (which serves for lazy allocation/deallocation of terms) now is not a linked list of terms, but a static array. That allowed to simplify term_free and term_create_... functions.

2. I increased the size of the freelist from 1000 to 5000. Hopefully acceptable.

3. Examples show that it is unlikely that the freelist is empty, it is unlikely that we are dealing with paths of length zero, and it is likely that monomials have more than one reference. I used Cython's likely(...) and unlikely(...) accordingly, which seemed to have an effect.

__Results__

- Doctests pass.

- It still seems that functions are interruptible.

- I tested that
  {{{
sage: P = DiGraph({Integer(1):{Integer(1):['x','y','z']}}).path_semigroup().algebra(GF(Integer(25),'t'))
sage: P.inject_variables()
Defining e_1, x, y, z
sage: while 1:
....:     p = x<sup>4+x*y*x*z+2*z</sup>2*x*y
....:     q = p^7
....:     print get_memory_usage()
  }}}
  does not leak memory.

- Timing now is as follows:
  {{{
sage: %timeit p = x<sup>4+x*y*x*z+2*z</sup>2*x*y
The slowest run took 4.13 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 17.9 µs per loop
sage: p = x<sup>4+x*y*x*z+2*z</sup>2*x*y
sage: %timeit q = p^7
1000 loops, best of 3: 954 µs per loop
  }}}
  That is no change in the "small" example and a visible improvement in the second example.
- Profiling yields
  {{{
sage: %crun for n in xrange(1000): q = (x<sup>4+x*y*x*z+2*z</sup>2*x*y)^7

The difference in the profiling between biseq_init_concat and mon_mul_path indicates how much time is spent for memory allocation of `path_mon_t*`. It makes me think if I should perhaps replace the usage of `path_mon_t*` by arrays of length one.

That would be similar to what is done for biseq_t and seemed to yield an improvement. I couldn't do the same trick for terms, because I have linked lists of terms. But for monomials it would perhaps make sense.

If someone likes to finish reviewing: Go ahead! If changing the monomials has a good effect, then I can still open a new ticket, or post it here if the review isn't finished yet.

It was easy to move the monomials from heap to stack.

With the latest commit, it is still interruptible, arithmetic still runs without memory leak, and the timing becomes

```
sage: %timeit p = x^4+x*y*x*z+2*z^2*x*y
The slowest run took 4.45 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 18 µs per loop
sage: %timeit q = p^7
1000 loops, best of 3: 740 µs per loop
```


So, the small example stays as it was, but the large example improved by as much as 22%!!

The profile:

```
sage: %crun for n in xrange(1000): q = (x^4+x*y*x*z+2*z^2*x*y)^7
PROFILE: interrupts/evictions/bytes = 77/5/26640

The difference between biseq_init_concat and mon_mul_path has disappeared, which obviously is a consequence of using the stack (before, there was an expensive `sage_calloc`).

Also, tests still pass.

I think I am done now! At least unless I find that after all these changes I find a benefit in inlining some monomial-related functions...

I just noticed that all `mon_...` functions appearing in the profile in fact *are* inline, even though I did not suggest to the compiler that `mon_mul_path` should be inlined. Thus, the compiler was clever enough `:-)`.

Anyway, let's do it with a new commit.

It took a very long time to finish this ticket (I had the first version of the code on my laptop two years ago), but the comments of the referees have been very helpful and resulted in major improvements.

Thank you very much!
