I think it'd be better to just use


```
return PermutationGroup(gap_group=gap.Intersection(self, other))
```

Thanks, Mike - yes, that'd be better.  I'd forgotten about the more Python-like syntax being available.

Indeed, this looks better (especially given that % stuff is going away in Python 3, AFAIK).

Yes, the string formatting is being replaced, but I think I read that it will have an extra-long grace period.  Anyway, hopefully there will be tools to automate the conversions.

v2 patch incorporates Mike's suggestion and uses the new string-formatting routine for the error message.

OK. Checked, it works. Positive review.

Just checked, this should apply fine to 4.7.alpha1.
