# Issue 6176: ReSTify modules in sage/numerical and put them in reference manual

Keywords: docstring, ReST, Sphinx, optimize.py

The only module in `sage/numerical/` is `optimize.py`, which is still stuck with the old doc formatting. Change the doc formatting to Sphinx and add the module to the reference manual.
