CC:  @tobiasdiez fbissey jhpalmieri vdelecroix

After #30527, it is possible to install Python packages built by the Sage distribution into user-defined venvs.  

In this ticket, we create `src/requirements.txt` to facilitate this.

We add documentation on how to set up the virtual environment, using either plain `python -m venv`, `virtualenv` (20.x), or `pipenv`.

The existing `src/setup.py` is copied into `build/pkgs/sagelib/src`  to replace the symlink. In this way, the changes to `src/setup.py` made in this ticket do not affect the existing build process of the Sage library.

Yes, I started to play a bit with pipenv, and this looks like a possible route.

I would like to keep that for #29041 though.

On the present ticket I would only want to do the most rudimentary thing - basically to try out the adjustments that sagelib will need (see #22731).
