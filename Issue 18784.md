# Issue 18784: Now the default ipython profile location is "profile_default" not "profile_sage"

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: klee

Original creation time: 2015-08-13 05:35:50

The release manager, Volker Braun, says:

"Since we already have a private .ipython-* directory, I'm fine with using the profile_default."

So "profile_sage" is now changed to "profile_default" at one place of the Sage documentation.
