This is a border case, but I'd still prefer it to work:

```
sage: F = FreeGroup(0)

I made the input to element construct just return the identity anytime a `bool(x)` is `False` (which includes empty lists and tuples), so it fixes the issue (and possibly slightly faster than before).

Looks good to *me*, though a shade of doubt remains about whether `not x` doesn't encompass a few cases too many. Can you run this by someone who knows Sage's free groups well?

It did overextend to include `0` going to the identity. However the input is suppose to be a list or tuple whose entries correspond to (inverse) generators, so I've changed it to explicitly check `x == [] or x == ()`.
