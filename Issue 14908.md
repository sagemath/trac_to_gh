Here's a small review patch which fixes some formatting (including some typos in the full file) and the skips doctests as needed. If you're happy with my changes, then go ahead and set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis

Fixed. I still find the line number of that test ironic.

Can you revert the last commit and actually make it run the 4 tests in doc/en/constructions/groups.rst?

There's a slight bug with the `sources.py` test in that it does not properly realize that

```
   .. skip

   ::
```

is suppose to skip the tests (although the doctesting framework does correctly skip it). This means we have to keep the slight formatting error (but not a rst error) of

```
   .. skip

::
```

but since that was there previously, I've just reverted the change. Do you think that is acceptable?

Comment by vbraun created at 2013-12-23 20:52:57

you have to break the first line of the bullet point

```
-  bullet line
   break point:

   .. skip::

       sage: <skipped>
```

Wow, that's a fine nuance and good to know. Thanks Volker.

I just changed a line back to it's original location since I moved it for better formatting with what I knew before comment:14.
