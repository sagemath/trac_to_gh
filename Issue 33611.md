The bug fixed in #33706 by patching our GIAC package still happens in 9.6.rc3 on systems where the system giac is used: `ubuntu-jammy-standard` (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/6236167662, 1.7.0.39+dfsg2-1build2) and `debian-sid-standard`.

`@`parisse, could you take a look whether our patch https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/build/pkgs/giac/patches/0001-src-global.cc-Do-not-send-SIGINT-to-process-1.patch would be acceptable to merge in giac?
