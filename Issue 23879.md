Can you explain a little bit why you need to explicitly add an `_add_` and `_mul_` methods to `FiniteRingElement`? It seems like it is not (suppose to be) a concrete class and we do not do similar declarations in our other abstract subclasses of `Element`. I'm just trying to understand what is different here.

It's a valid question... we do have to add those declarations somewhere and it seemed silly to do it for every finite field element class separately. This abstract base class looked like the correct level of abstraction: it's still rather concrete (vs. `Element` or `RingElement` for example). On the other hand: for polynomials, we do add it to every concrete class.

Ah, yea, right. LGTM.

Also to anyone else looking at this change, having a doctest here is functionally pointless as these are here mainly as a technical detail. So that it why I positively reviewed this without explicit doctests for those methods.

I plan to move this way down to `element.pyx` in #24607.
