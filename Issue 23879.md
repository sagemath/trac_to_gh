Can you explain a little bit why you need to explicitly add an `_add_` and `_mul_` methods to `FiniteRingElement`? It seems like it is not (suppose to be) a concrete class and we do not do similar declarations in our other abstract subclasses of `Element`. I'm just trying to understand what is different here.

Also to anyone else looking at this change, having a doctest here is functionally pointless as these are here mainly as a technical detail. So that it why I positively reviewed this without explicit doctests for those methods.
