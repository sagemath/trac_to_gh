Keywords: asymptotics, gsoc15

For the sake of usability we have introduced a short notation for growth groups (implemented at [#17600](http://trac.sagemath.org/17600)).

For various reasons, having a factory that is able to generate a growth group from such a "short representation string" is desireable: for example, such a factory enables us to implement a user-friendly way of interacting with the AsymptoticRing (implemented at [#17716](http://trac.sagemath.org/17716)).

This ticket provides an implementation for such a factory (which can be extended easily to cover cartesian products of growth groups as well).
