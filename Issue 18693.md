# Issue 18693: GrowthGroup: short notation factory

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: asymptotics, gsoc15

For the sake of usability we have introduced a short notation for growth groups (implemented at [#17600](http://trac.sagemath.org/17600)).

For various reasons, having a factory that is able to generate a growth group from such a "short representation string" is desireable: for example, such a factory enables us to implement a user-friendly way of interacting with the AsymptoticRing (implemented at [#17716](http://trac.sagemath.org/17716)).

This ticket provides an implementation for such a factory (which can be extended easily to cover cartesian products of growth groups as well).

During the project #17601 (the last months in course of GSOC2015 as mentor) I did a very careful reviewing of all code. This includes the code of this ticket. Now this is clearly a positive_review from my side.

I reviewed this and added two reviewer commits.

Doctests pass and documentation builds and is adequate, code seems to be fine.

Please cross-review my changes and set the ticket to `positive_review` if you are satisfied.
