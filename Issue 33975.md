The new methods are not indented correctly, so this cannot build

Two comments:
- Docbuild fails as [Cohen1993] isn't the reference, it should be [Coh1993].
- I'd like to see an example with more than two places. One option would be to add the number field defined by x<sup>4</sup> - 8x<sup>2</sup> + 3, which has four real places, as an example.

Thank you, Alex. Log embedding for the relative number field is also supported now.
