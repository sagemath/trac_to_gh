Keywords: sparse matrix multiplication matrix_modn_sparse

Multiplying two sparse matrices over a small prime field sometimes produces incorrect results. Small example:


```
sage: p = next_prime(2**15); p
32771
sage: M = Matrix(GF(p), 1,3, lambda i,j: -1, sparse=True); M
[32770 32770 32770]
sage: M*M.transpose()
[32738] # INCORRECT, should be 3
```


In fact, the result in this case is off by 2<sup>32</sup> (mod p) indicating an int overflow.

David,

You should add a doctest to the documentation string that give an example of the bug that you fixed. This has to go in the `TESTS` section (see http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings). A reasonable template is

```
TESTS:

The following was wrong prior to :trac:`23669`::

    sage: the_example_that_used_to_fail_but_is_now_ok()
    output
```
