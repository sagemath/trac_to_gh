Original creator: leif

Original creation time: 2016-08-06 19:27:29

Follow-up to #21178, as the branch here contains many changes to just one file, fixing loads of docstrings (not code or examples etc.).

In `schuetzenberger_involution`, it looks like the `INPUT:` block was one space too few (and then your changes to the bullet points). Also, in `*_special_factors`, we should make the bullet points the correct indentation:

```
- this is a long sentence that goes on but
  should be aligned with the first letter
```

Also in `bispecial_*`.  (Hard to see with two backticks above, especially when the editor in addition wraps long lines in case the window is too narrow... 8-/ )

Fixed now, I'll push in a few minutes.

Rebased on #21178 which in turn got rebased on Sage 7.4.beta0.  No changes otherwise.

oh, shout, I just overwrite the branch here, by working on 21178. Travis do you have a copy ??

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-08-14 08:14:58

No, I don't. However, it should be possible to get a copy by using the commit sha1.

I guess the latest good commit may be this one:

https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=bb7d7aeff37e6077f8270c854a50b34ffb3d9bdc

but I do not manage to make a branch from that..

I have tried to recreate a branch (by hand!)

u/chapoton/poor_branch_21181

but it may be bad, missing some commits.

It would be better if leif had a copy of his own branch, and could make a new branch from the commit bb7d7aeff37e6077f8270c854a50b34ffb3d9bdc

Sorry for all the trouble. I make a forced push on public/21178, having forgotten that this branch was used in 21181 (which is rather bad practice and done after my own advice !)

I've now really _rebased_ my five commits on top of Frédéric's new branch (commit `	b2744b31a5fb76a9c394155566e1210bb595b3ef`) on #21178.
