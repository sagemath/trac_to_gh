Keywords: weak and strong tableaux, hash

Currently WeakTableaux and StrongTableaux are not hashable:

```
sage: T = WeakTableaux(3, [5,2,1], [1,1,1,1,1,1], representation='core')
sage: t = T[0]
sage: hash(t)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two things:

1. The output of the hash is different for 32 bit machines. IMO a better test is `hash(t) == hash(t)`. (Also has the benefit of not having to change doctests when stuff changes.)
2. If the representation is not core or bounded, I think its better to call `super(WeakTableau_abstract, self).__hash__(self)` to not duplicate code and to use the (faster) cython from `ClonableList`.
