I am actually a bit surprised the documentation builds before this change. Although there is another formatting issue that you might want to take care of here: the items are not correctly indented. So there would be changes of the form:

```diff
     1. **series**: elements are displayed as series in `p`.::
 
         sage: R = Qp(5, print_mode='series'); a = R(70700); a
         3*5^2 + 3*5^4 + 2*5^5 + 4*5^6 + O(5^22)
         sage: b = R(-70700); b
         2*5^2 + 4*5^3 + 5^4 + 2*5^5 + 4*5^7 + 4*5^8 + 4*5^9 + 4*5^10 + 4*5^11 + 4*5^12 + 4*5^13 + 4*5^14 + 4*5^15 + 4*5^16 + 4*5^17 + 4*5^18 + 4*5^19 + 4*5^20 + 4*5^21 + O(5^22)
 
-    *print_pos* controls whether negatives can be used in the
-    coefficients of powers of `p`.::
+      *print_pos* controls whether negatives can be used in the
+      coefficients of powers of `p`. ::
```
(Note the last space before the `::` is also important so it doesn't display as "powers of p.:".)
