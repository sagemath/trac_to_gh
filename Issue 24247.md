Hi Volker,

For #23362, we need to upgrade pandocfilters too (and nothing else). Do you mind if we take over the two related diffs there?

Hi again:

To get things moving and for testing, I have pushed a branch with those diffs to #23362; waiting for your confirmation.

Strangely enough, I did not get the same checksums. You downloaded the tarbal from
https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters/releases, right?

Cheers,
                   Nicolas

I see. Thanks for the feedback!

I had downloaded the tarball from github, according to the instructions in the SPKG.txt, and indeed the two tarballs differ slightly:

```
Seulement dans pandocfilters-1.4.2-github/examples: gabc-score.gabc
Seulement dans pandocfilters-1.4.2-github/examples: lilypond-score.ly
Seulement dans pandocfilters-1.4.2-github: .gitignore
Seulement dans pandocfilters-1.4.2-github: MANIFEST.in
Seulement dans pandocfilters-1.4.2-github: PACKAGING
Seulement dans pandocfilters-1.4.2: PKG-INFO
```

It's reasonable to use pypi as authoritative source since we want to stay close to a usual pip install. So I updated the instructions in SPKG.txt and reverted to your checksums in #23362.

I confirmed it works (Ubuntu 16.04); I simply had to install the Ubuntu package `textlive-xetex` to enable the PDF export. 
There remains the bug reported in #23330, but this is a separate issue (and definitively not a blocker).
