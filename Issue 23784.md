* This is class [http://www.graphclasses.org/classes/gc_151.html](http://www.graphclasses.org/classes/gc_151.html). So please add in file `isgci.py`:

```
graph_classes.CoGraph = GraphClass("CoGraph", "gc_151", recognition_function = lambda x:x.is_cograph())
```


* Also, I'm not sure if the empty graph should be considered a cograph or not.

* you can use `graphs.PathGraph(4)`

* Note that this is related to #23487 that needs further reviews.

Done.

Good question... It is a comparability graph of the empty poset, so in kind of should. It is P4-free. And it is not by the definition. Should we ask sage-devel?

> * you can use `graphs.PathGraph(4)`

Tried, got an error as not it is only imported to command line, not to "internal" use.

Yep. After that we can make this faster, I suppose.

You can ask on sage-dev if the empty graph should be considered a cograph or not. It's the only issue I see.

Could you do the following changes:
- `Test whether the graph is cograph.` -> `Check whether the graph is cograph.`  It seems more commonly used. Well, I never remember which is the recommended term
- Add in the description of what is a cograph something like: "A cograph has no induced `P_4`." Then the reader will easy get the relation between the documentation and the code.

There should be a skeleton for Boolean-valued functions. I asked about that in sage-devel, but IIRC there was no clear response.

Some typos in the text:
- `subgraphh` -> `subgraph`
- `splittin to` -> `split it into`

last, you could add a todo block like (at least its here if you prefer not to add it):

```
.. TODO::

    Implement faster recognition algorithm, as for instance
    the linear time recognition algorithm using LexBFS proposed
    in [BCH08]_.
```


and add the ref where it should.

.. [BCH98] Bretscher, A.; Corneil, D. G.; Habib, M.; Paul, C. (2008), "A simple Linear Time LexBFS Cograph Recognition Algorithm", SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 22 (4): 1277–1296, doi:10.1137/060664690.

It should be like this, but the reference does not seem to work. Just compiling error, or did I do something wrong?

Comment by dcoudert created at 2017-10-16 11:16:53

I checked here [http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#sage-s-master-bibliography-file](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#sage-s-master-bibliography-file), and so it's like that. The compilation error in the documentation is because we should rebuild the doc from scratch...

I just saw that you can do `:doi:`10.1137/060664690`` to get the hyperlink.

Also, there is a `\` before initial. So the entry should look like:

```
.. [Bre2008] \A. Bretscher and D. G. Corneil and M. Habib and C. Paul (2008), "A
             simple Linear Time LexBFS Cograph Recognition Algorithm", SIAM
             Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 22 (4): 1277–1296,
             :doi:`10.1137/060664690`.
```


Almost done. I think we can assume that the empty graph is a cograph so far. If someone disagree, then we can fix that later.

OK, it was just a compilation issue. Now done.

I tried to install this ticket with beta8 and I have no merge conflict.

Can you try Jori ?

I guess it is against the next beta that Volker is making now.

There was something very odd with git. As the addition is simple, I just re-run some patches. Seems to be OK, so I put this back to _needs_review_.
