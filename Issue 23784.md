Good question... It is a comparability graph of the empty poset, so in kind of should. It is P4-free. And it is not by the definition. Should we ask sage-devel?

Tried, got an error as not it is only imported to command line, not to "internal" use.

Yep. After that we can make this faster, I suppose.

Could you do the following changes:

- Add in the description of what is a cograph something like: "A cograph has no induced `P_4`." Then the reader will easy get the relation between the documentation and the code.

There should be a skeleton for Boolean-valued functions. I asked about that in sage-devel, but IIRC there was no clear response.

Some typos in the text:
- `subgraphh` -> `subgraph`
- `splittin to` -> `split it into`

last, you could add a todo block like (at least its here if you prefer not to add it):

```
.. TODO::

    Implement faster recognition algorithm, as for instance
    the linear time recognition algorithm using LexBFS proposed
    in [BCH08]_.
```


and add the ref where it should.
