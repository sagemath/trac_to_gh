CC:  tscrim

Keywords: sd88

improve getitem so that the following works

```
sage: l = libgap.eval('[[0,1],[2,3]]')
sage: l[0,0]
```

and implement setitem in order to be able to do

```
sage: l = libgap.eval('[[0,1],[2,3]]')
sage: l[0,0] = -3
```

Some trivial things:

Remove the period:

```
IndexError('index out of range.')
```


Minor formatting:

```diff
-        Set the i-th item of this list
+        Set the ``i``-th item of this list.
```


You have both `multiindices` and `multi indices`. IMO, `multi-indices` is best, but the biggest thing is being consistent.

I fixed the documentation issues in `c3241d6` (though not that this documentation is not compiled in the reference manual).

More importantly, `__setitem__` was not working correctly and that was addressed in `4dc210b`.
