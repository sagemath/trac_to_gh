Add interface to Nauty's gentreeg generator of non-isomorphic trees.

It is slower than `graphs.trees()` but has more options.

I've seen a few failures related to this on CI. For example
https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/7244909758?check_suite_focus=true

```
sage -t --random-seed=339975412379786288587528093076040376748 src/sage/graphs/generators/families.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/graphs/generators/families.py", line 3479, in sage.graphs.generators.families.nauty_gentreeg
Failed example:
    [len(list(graphs.nauty_gentreeg(str(i)))) for i in range(1, 15)]
Expected:
    [1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 23, 47, 106, 235, 551, 1301, 3159]
Got:
    [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 23, 47, 106, 235, 551, 1301, 3159]
```

(that's on debian-stretch-standard using system nauty 2.6r7+ds-1)
