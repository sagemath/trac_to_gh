PyQt_x11 doesn't build on OSX. We should either fix the x11 build or package the aqua version.

I've made an updated sip spkg that removes the Python framework check reported at #13022:

Someone with OSX please test and let me know!

The sip package you posted actually builds for me on OS X 10.7.3 :-).

Where does Qt on OSX put its qmake tool? Is there a standard location or file name in the PATH? e.g. Fedora seems to use qmake-qt4.

For me the default location (installing the qt packages for OSX) is `/usr/bin/qmake`. If they get installed using Macports then the location is `/opt/local/bin/qmake`. HTH.

Package builds and installs fine on OS X 10.6.8, both with the standard qmake and with the macports one. It seems it has no test suite though. Is there anything else I can do to check that it works as expected?

Setting spkg proposals that have not seen recent activity to "sage-wishlist".
