# Issue 12296: # cython: cdivision=True

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12468

The file matrix_window_modn_dense.pyx starts with

```
# cython: cdivision=True
```

which suggests that putting a line like 

```
# cython: cdivision=False
```

would have an impact on the directives used when compiling Cython code.  This is not the case at all.  Such a line is completely ignored.  

To resolve this ticket, either make the directive not be ignored, or delete this line from matrix_window_modn_dense.pyx. 

Note that the actual directories used are currently hard coded in devel/sage/sage/setup.py in this code:

```
        # call cython, abort if it failed
        cmd = "python `which cython` %s --old-style-globals --disable-function-redefinition --embed-positions --directive cdivision=True,autotestdict=False,fast_getattr=True -I%s -o %s %s"%(cplus, os.getcwd(), outfile, f)
        r = run_command(cmd)
```


The default with PSAGE is cdivision=False.  This is causing me headaches when porting code from psage to sage.  (E.g., #12465).    For #12465 I'll probably try to figure out how to rewrite my code to work with cdivision=True, or use explicit cython directives on a function-by-function level.

OK, now I feel stupid.  So even though the command line explicitly has `--directive cdivision=True,`, when cython sees the file it does cdivision=False, as long as `# cython: cdivision=False` is in the file.  So I'm basically just totally wrong.  I'm closing this ticket as invalid. Sorry for the noise and confusion.
