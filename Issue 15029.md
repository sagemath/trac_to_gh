# Issue 15029: finite state machines: inherit from Mutability

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15266

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2013-10-09 09:42:17

Keywords: finite state machine, mutability

The classes `FSMState`, `FSMTransition` and `FiniteStateMachine` should be inherited from `sage.structure.mutability.Mutability`. Adapt hash-functions (use `requre_immutable`).
