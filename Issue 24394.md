Every poset has at least one *greedy* linear extension with optimal number of jumps. Use this to make a faster function.

Isn't this just a backtracking algorithm? I think you should put a little more into the algorithm description (essentially explaining what "greedy" means in this context).

Instead of your `nonlocals`, why not just return the result, which will propagate up? In a similar vein, it is usually better to manually do the backtracking rather than use recursion (faster, and in Python, no [artificial] depth limit), but that is not something I will hold this ticket up for.

Added that.

Recursion depth can not be a problem here; we can propably never compute jump number of 100-element posets, unless it has very small width (and if so, we should optimize by doing series-parallel decomposition). But yes, it would be faster not to use recursion.

Returning a result is not enought if we want to cut the computation based on earlier result.
