# Issue 32687: WordMorphism.is_iterable

First of all the documentation of `WordMorphism.is_endomorphism` is wrong. This is not the definition of endomorphism nor what is implemented. That should be corrected.

Next, it is desirable to have a method to test whether such morphism could be iterated, that is whether the codomain is included in the domain. We introduce the method `is_iterable` for that purpose.

I have nothing to propose but the word [iterable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterable) may be confusing in the Python context.

True. `is_self_composable`?

Please, can you provide in the description an example of an endomorphism which you can not iterate?

> This is neither the definition of endomorphism nor what is implemented. 

Please, can you provide in the description an sagemath example illustrating the issue?

Since you seem to have problems accessing the source code I clarified the issue.

With the definition of endomorphism. Tell me if something remains unclear.

one failing doctest, see patchbot, and one `Returns` that should be `Return`
