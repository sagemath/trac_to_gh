This ticket has the following goals.

First, fix the documentation of `WordMorphism.is_endomorphism`

```diff
-    Returns ``True`` if the codomain is a subset of the domain.
+    Return whether the codomain is equal to the domain.
```
This would match the [definition of endomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endomorphism) and the (correct) implementation

```
return self.codomain() == self.domain()
```

Next, add a method to test whether a `WordMorphism`
can be iterated, that is, whether the codomain
is contained in the domain. This method is called `is_self_composable`. Using this new method could be more appropriate than using `is_endomorphism` in some existing code.

Finally, we impose stricter conditions on the input. The current code allows the two following constructions that raise errors with the branch

```
sage: WordMorphism({'a':'a'}, domain=FiniteWords('ab'))
WordMorphism: a->a
sage: WordMorphism({'a':'a', 'b':'b'}, domain=FiniteWords('a'))
WordMorphism: a->a, b->b
```

I have nothing to propose but the word [iterable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterable) may be confusing in the Python context.

Please, can you provide in the description an example of an endomorphism which you can not iterate?

Please, can you provide in the description an sagemath example illustrating the issue?
