CC:  @seblabbe @slel

First of all the documentation of `WordMorphism.is_endomorphism` is wrong. This is not the definition of endomorphism nor what is implemented. That should be corrected.

Next, it is desirable to have a method to test whether such morphism could be iterated, that is whether the codomain is included in the domain. We introduce the method `is_iterable` for that purpose.

I have nothing to propose but the word [iterable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterable) may be confusing in the Python context.
