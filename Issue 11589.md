Looks you forgot to update the spkg, it is exactly the same as before (last modified on 1 november):

```
$ ls -l /home/robertwb/cython/spkg/cython-0.15.1.spkg
-rw-r--r-- 1 robertwb robertwb 1420704 2011-11-01 06:57 /home/robertwb/cython/spkg/cython-0.15.1.spkg
```


Never mind, I will make the change.

Sorry to be late to the party. I get an error building the optional mpc extension in 4.8.alpha2 and I suspect cython-0.15.1 is the problem

```
sage/rings/complex_mpc.c: In function '__pyx_pf_4sage_5rings_11complex_mpc_15MPComplexNumber_16__float__':
sage/rings/complex_mpc.c:9720:48: error: cast specifies array type
```

I am guessing the complex_mpc.pyx code needs to be updated but I don't really know how.
