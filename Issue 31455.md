# Issue 31455: Refactor display behavior of mixed forms

We refactor the display behavior of mixed forms, in particular:

- We remove square brackets around homogeneous components since it might lead to confusion with cohomology elements (or any other equivalence classes).
- We remove zero-terms to make the output cleaner.

The patchbot says

```
File "src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/vector_bundle.py", line 242, in sage.manifolds.differentiable.vector_bundle.DifferentiableVectorBundle.characteristic_class
Failed example:
    p_form = p.get_form(nab); p_form.display_expansion()
Expected:
    p(TM, nabla_g) = [1] + [0] + [0] + [0] + [0]
Got:
    p(TM, nabla_g) = 1
```

Is there a way to fixdoctesting all files in a folder at once, optimally with multicore support?
