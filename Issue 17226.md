The 'dim' attribute of MIPVariables has been deprecated since 2013-12-06 in
#15489. It was always useless since `myvar[a,b]` works and is more practical
than ``myvar[a][b]``. I had not noticed that when I implemented it `T_T`

With this ticket, the problem is solved.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17463
