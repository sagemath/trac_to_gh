# Issue 17226: Remove the (deprecate) 'dim' argument of MIP variables

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: ncohen

Original creation time: 2014-12-08 07:28:12

CC:  dimpase

The 'dim' attribute of MIPVariables has been deprecated since 2013-12-06 in
#15489. It was always useless since `myvar[a,b]` works and is more practical
than ``myvar[a][b]``. I had not noticed that when I implemented it `T_T`

With this ticket, the problem is solved.

I hope you don't expect me to merge "sage-pending" tickets...

I do not object to changing the milestone and having it merged tomorrow, if you ask.

I'm neither the author nor the reviewer (name missing btw).

PSA: Once you want the ticket merged you can set a milestone to something else than "sage-pending"

Right right. I asked google calendar to send me an email on the 2015-05-06.

Just trying to make sure that everybody understands that feature of the merge script since it caused some confusion on another ticket
