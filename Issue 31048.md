For `cached_method`, we have:


```
sage: from sage.misc.cachefunc import cached_method
sage: class A(SageObject): 
....:     def __init__(self): 
....:         pass 
....:     @cached_method 
....:     def bar(x, s=1): 
....:         return 1
sage: Foo = A()
sage: Foo.bar() is Foo.bar(s=1)
True
```


In contrast to `UniqueRepresentation`:


```
sage: from sage.structure.unique_representation import UniqueRepresentation     
sage: class Foo(SageObject, UniqueRepresentation): 
....:     def __init__(self, s=1): 
....:         pass
sage: Foo() is Foo(s=1)                                                         
False
```


This is very annoying when working with `UniqueRepresentation` because right now one has to sneak in an extra `__classcall__` method to catch that behavior.

It's apparently a duplicate of #14167. I am sorry.
