The input alphabet should be the union of the two input alphabets (instead of `determine_alphabets`).

Replying to [comment:6 slabbe]:
> The branch does not apply cleanly (marked in red above).

Branch merges without any problems. This is a "problem" of trac (git-plugin or something similar), which does not detect that git merge will be successful. No extra merge commit of 6.9.beta1 is needed; thus set back to "needs review"
