I was trying to accomplish something similar, but in fact to remove Python 2 completely with a Python 3 build (as you mentioned on sage-devel). The only reason Python 2 is built in a Python 3 build, currently, is that it is a dependency for setuptools and pip. My patch, which I am currently testing:
