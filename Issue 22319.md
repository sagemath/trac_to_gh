# Issue 22319: implement periodic points for rational maps on projective space

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Currently periodoic points can only be computed for morphisms. This ticket expands the functionality to rational maps where there are possibly infinitely many periodic points of a given period. Consequently, a parameter to return the subscheme of periodic points instead of a list of points is added.

To make this work for subvarieties, indeterminacy locus was modified to work for subschemes.

oops. I thought I'd built them. Typo fixed.

And the doctest:


```

sage: X = P.subscheme(x-y)
sage: H = End(X)
sage: f = H([x^2-4*y^2, y^2-z^2, 4*z^2-x^2])
sage: Z = f.indeterminacy_locus(); Z
```


with the same error:

This seems to have been a conflict with the changes in #22268 and #21104. I pulled the latest beta and fixed.
