Keywords: symbolic preparser builtin built-in

At https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-devel/EQzNB7vkN3o , a user tries this:

```
sage: t=(1,2,3)
sage: type(t)
tuple
sage: len(t)
3
sage: len(t)=4
sage: t
t
sage: type(t)
sage.symbolic.expression.Expression
```


This strange behavior is because of the preparser:

```
sage: preparse('len(t) = 4')
'__tmp__=var("t"); len = symbolic_expression(Integer(4)).function(t)'
```


I propose that when the preparser is about to redefine a Python built-in function, we issue a warning. This will allow users to clobber the builtins, but also tell them they are possibly doing something unwise.

Attached is a first draft of a patch. Two issues: (1) I don't know how to properly raise the warning; right now it just prints it, but perhaps we have a more sophisticated mechanism that should be used? (2) It seems like all lines from the IPython shell get preparsed twice, so the warning is printed twice. I haven't dug into the preparser enough to understand this. But the attached patch is at least a sample of what I propose.

How about the list:

```
__builtin__.__dict__.keys()
```

If the problem is detected you could insert a warning printing message into the preparsing result. Then the warning printing gets executed together with the symbol binding.

The real problem here is that previously mistyping `len(t)==4` as `len(t)=4` resulted in invalid syntax, whereas now it results in an assignment. The same surprise happens when someone types

```
t = 0
sin(t) = 0 # mistyping of sin(t) == 0
```

Do you want to guard against that as well? Then quickly the whole `f(t)=...` notation should lead to a warning (which I wouldn't mind because I think it's one of the places where the preprocessor is too intrusive)

In fact, always printing:

```
sage: f(u,v)=u+v
Defining symbolic function f and symbolic variables u,v
```

might not be so bad. We're defining new syntax. We can define new semantics for that syntax, right?
We could have that result by ensuring that

```
sage: preparse('f(u,v)=u+v')
'__tmp__=var("u,v"); f = symbolic_expression(u+v).function(u,v); print "Defining f and u,v"'
```

or whatever (terse) message would be reasonable.

Or, slightly modified:

sage: preparse('f(u,v)=u+v')
'__tmp__=var("u,v"); f = symbolic_expression(u+v).function(u,v); "Defining f and u,v"'
```

would provide another flavour. Here, essentially the warning is the "value" of the assignment, so it only gets printed if values of statements do (i.e., in interactive environments).

If you want to get rid of the quotes in printing:

```
class NonQuoteRepr(str):
    def __repr__(a):
        return a
```

and return

```
NonQuoteRepr("Defining f and u,v")
```

instead. Perhaps we already have a class for representing messages that does this.

Regarding the message: I think that this behavior needs to be documented.

I think that `DOCTEST_MODE` is more appropriately used when you want to disable displaying a plot or opening up a web page: something which would be disruptive when running doctests — it shouldn't be used as a replacement for writing accurate doctests.

The part that I have always found surprising is that

```
f(x)=...
```

*also* binds `x`. The typographically similar

```
f[x]=...
```

does no such thing. Of course

```
f,x=...
```

does bind both so there is precedent of binding multiple names in one Python statement, but the construction feels unpythonic to me anyway, mainly because semantically the `x` is not there to be defined. It's there as a placeholder. That's why I think an (unpythonic) warning might fit the (to me unpythonic) syntactic construct. It does clobber our wonderful shorthand

```
_(x,y,z)=0
```

for

```
var('x,y,z')
```

with an ugly warning.
