There's a function in code_constructions.py that makes me dizzy:

```
def _lift2smallest_field(a):
    """
    INPUT: a is an element of a finite field GF(q)

    OUTPUT: the element b of the smallest subfield F of GF(q) for
    which F(b)=a.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.coding.code_constructions import _lift2smallest_field
        sage: FF.<z> = GF(3^4,"z")
        sage: a = z^10
        sage: _lift2smallest_field(a)
        (2*z + 1, Finite Field in z of size 3^2)
        sage: a = z^40
        sage: _lift2smallest_field(a)
        (2, Finite Field of size 3)

    AUTHORS:

    - John Cremona
    """
    FF = a.parent()
    k = FF.degree()
    if k == 1:

    if d == k:

    p = FF.characteristic()
    F = GF(p**d,"z")
    b = pol.roots(F,multiplicities=False)[0]
    return b, F
```

How does `pol.roots(F,multiplicities=False)[0]` know to return the *right* root of `pol` (i.e., the one that coerces back to `a`), rather than a random root?

We've added the following comment

```
This is now designed to work only with finite fields with automatic names, built using ``GF(q)``.
```

and changed `FF = GF(q**k,"z")` to `FF = GF(q**k)` meaning that we're using pseudo-Conway polynomials for the extension if `k` is large, rather than a randomly selected polynomial.
Here's some timings (I use number=1 and repeat=1 to eliminate caching effects).  

```
sage: for k in srange(100,150):
....:     if len(k.factor()) < 3: continue
....:     print "3^%s conway "%k,
....:     timeit("FF = GF(3^%s)"%k,number=1,repeat=1)
....:     print "3^%s random "%k,
....:     timeit("FF = GF(3^%s,'z')"%k,number=1,repeat=1)
3^102 conway  1 loops, best of 1: 717 ms per loop
3^102 random  1 loops, best of 1: 2.93 ms per loop
3^105 conway  1 loops, best of 1: 537 ms per loop
3^105 random  1 loops, best of 1: 3.1 ms per loop
3^110 conway  1 loops, best of 1: 794 ms per loop
3^110 random  1 loops, best of 1: 3.17 ms per loop
3^114 conway  1 loops, best of 1: 962 ms per loop
3^114 random  1 loops, best of 1: 3.41 ms per loop
3^120 conway  1 loops, best of 1: 1.25 s per loop
3^120 random  1 loops, best of 1: 3.77 ms per loop
3^126 conway  1 loops, best of 1: 1.47 s per loop
3^126 random  1 loops, best of 1: 3.51 ms per loop
3^130 conway  1 loops, best of 1: 1.06 s per loop
3^130 random  1 loops, best of 1: 6.67 ms per loop
3^132 conway  1 loops, best of 1: 1.26 s per loop
3^132 random  1 loops, best of 1: 5.12 ms per loop
3^138 conway  1 loops, best of 1: 1.57 s per loop
3^138 random  1 loops, best of 1: 3.71 ms per loop
3^140 conway  1 loops, best of 1: 1.5 s per loop
3^140 random  1 loops, best of 1: 4.89 ms per loop
```

These will continue to worsen as the number of factors of the degree increases.

Ok. The modified function is only used in this precise file, and I have no idea if its use here involve finite fields for high powers of primes or not.

What is crucial is to have finite fields that have a coherent system of inclusions, all of them sitting in a common algebraic closure. If I understood correctly, this is only ensured by using the syntax `GF(q)` without names.
