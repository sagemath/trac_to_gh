There remains a few others such ugly things:

```
git grep "^import sage$"
src/sage/combinat/finite_state_machine.py:import sage
src/sage/rings/asymptotic/growth_group.py:import sage
src/sage/rings/asymptotic/growth_group_cartesian.py:import sage
src/sage/rings/asymptotic/term_monoid.py:import sage
src/sage/rings/complex_mpc.pyx:import sage
src/sage/rings/noncommutative_ideals.pyx:import sage
src/sage/sets/finite_set_map_cy.pyx:import sage
src/sage/structure/list_clone.pyx:import sage
src/sage/structure/list_clone_timings_cy.pyx:import sage
```
