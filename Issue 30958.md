Good to go, with or without the following optional extra changes.


```diff
             if self.base_ring()(other).is_zero():
                 return self._zero_element
-            else:
-                return self._one_element
+            return self._one_element
```



```diff
-        sage: A, v = Sequence(l,B).coefficient_matrix()
+        sage: A, v = Sequence(l, B).coefficient_matrix()
```




```diff
-        sage: E, v = Sequence(e,B).coefficient_matrix()
+        sage: E, v = Sequence(e, B).coefficient_matrix()
```
