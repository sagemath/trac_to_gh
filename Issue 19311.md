There is a field

```
EXAMPLES::

without any example inside. This breaks the building of the doc.

ok, looks good to me. I think we may use a new ticket to organise the list given here :

Thanks for doing the review Frédéric.

I agree, this has gotten to the point where we need to start organizing the list of named algebras, but I think both for doc and catalog.
