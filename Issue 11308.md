Great stuff! Code looks really sound, all doctests pass, and I tried a bunch of random corner cases and it coped with all of them gracefully. Positive review.

Hi David,

Yes, this was a fun one.  And I plan to stitch it into `.is_similar()` to make that bullet-proof.

I was secretly hoping you were headed to this one after taking care of the companion matrix constructor.  Thanks very much for looking it over and carefully putting it through its paces.

Rob
