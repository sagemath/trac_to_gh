​We currently have the following entry points:

- [Welcome to the SageMath Installation Guide](https://6212659123a9467b3cb0cd07--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/installation/index.html) 
 (in the current version, shows a decision tree)

- https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/README.md

- https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/walk_through.html#obtaining-and-compiling-the-sage-source-code

From https://www.sagemath.org/development.html: "the highly active IRC channel"?

yes, a nice piece of history. Also

```
"There are releases about every 3-4 weeks"
```

What confused me already a few times is that parts of the installation guide is for both normal users and developers. I would propose to target the installation guide only to the average user, and move the more advanced installation/compilation from source to the developer guide.

So my proposal would be
- "installation guide" = entry point for average user
- "developer guide" = entry point for developers (or more generally people that want to contribute to sagemath)
- "readme.md" = entry point for people stumbling upon sage on github, should give a short explanation of what sage is and then redirect to either to the installation or developer guide.

I think we can replace the whole page by a redirect to https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md, which has a revised version of this text.

I've deleted https://wiki.sagemath.org/IRC and removed mention of it in https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageWiki and https://wiki.sagemath.org/devel/BeginSageDevelopment

Can you please outline in the ticket description how the entry points and user flow are now structured.

Moreover, I would propose to move the content of the readme.md about the installation from source to the (developer) documentation. I think its more convenient for potentially new developers to have everything in one place and really have a "walk through" instead of a "follow links game".

No, I don't like this.

There used to be many copies of incomplete/outdated step by step instructions. 
It was an improvement to consolidate them in a single place, the README.md.

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-04-25 22:18:43

On https://www.sagemath.org/, there are still prominent links "Download 9.5", "Source 9.5", "Download", "Source Code" that should probably be replaced by a link to the Installation Guide front page as well.

`@`isuruf: Our documentation says "This works on Linux and macOS on x86_64 processors, and on Linux on aarch64 processors (using Miniforge)." - is this still correct, or is macOS with aarch64 also supported?

macOS with arm64 is supported now.

I was not proposing to duplicate the information, but to move it from the readme to the documentation. This would then look similar to scipy https://github.com/scipy/scipy which link to their installation guide and to ways to contribute. I think its quite common to design the readme as a general entry point linking to more specialized docs, some examples: https://github.com/django/django https://github.com/pallets/flask https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx https://github.com/JabRef/jabref, all of which are linking to some form of installation and contribution guide explaining how to setup a local development environment etc
