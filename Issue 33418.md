What confused me already a few times is that parts of the installation guide is for both normal users and developers. I would propose to target the installation guide only to the average user, and move the more advanced installation/compilation from source to the developer guide.

So my proposal would be
- "installation guide" = entry point for average user
- "developer guide" = entry point for developers (or more generally people that want to contribute to sagemath)
- "readme.md" = entry point for people stumbling upon sage on github, should give a short explanation of what sage is and then redirect to either to the installation or developer guide.

I was not proposing to duplicate the information, but to move it from the readme to the documentation. This would then look similar to scipy https://github.com/scipy/scipy which link to their installation guide and to ways to contribute. I think its quite common to design the readme as a general entry point linking to more specialized docs, some examples: https://github.com/django/django https://github.com/pallets/flask https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx https://github.com/JabRef/jabref, all of which are linking to some form of installation and contribution guide explaining how to setup a local development environment etc
