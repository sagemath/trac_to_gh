​We currently have the following entry points:

  (in the current version, shows a decision tree)

What confused me already a few times is that parts of the installation guide is for both normal users and developers. I would propose to target the installation guide only to the average user, and move the more advanced installation/compilation from source to the developer guide.

So my proposal would be
- "installation guide" = entry point for average user
- "developer guide" = entry point for developers (or more generally people that want to contribute to sagemath)
- "readme.md" = entry point for people stumbling upon sage on github, should give a short explanation of what sage is and then redirect to either to the installation or developer guide.
