I would like to teach first-year students how to use [QEPCAD](http://www.usna.edu/CS/~qepcad/B/QEPCAD.html) to solve systems of rational inequalities ([example](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-devel/QLEFLgkuXRg/bFAbvp6UWXwJ)).

`sage-6.2.ova` displays the qepcad help with `qepcad?`, but it cannot be used:



```
qepcad('(E x)[a x + b > 0]', vars='(a,b,x)')
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
RuntimeError: Unable to start QEPCAD
```

Btw., I get the same error at http://www.sagenb.org/. This should also be fixed. At http://sagecell.sagemath.org/ qepcad integration works!
