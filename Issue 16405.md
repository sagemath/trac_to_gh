# Issue 16405: Install QEPCAD in the download binaries

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jondo

Original creation time: 2014-07-10 12:10:37

I would like to teach first-year students how to use [QEPCAD](http://www.usna.edu/CS/~qepcad/B/QEPCAD.html) to solve systems of rational inequalities ([example](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-devel/QLEFLgkuXRg/bFAbvp6UWXwJ)).

`sage-6.2.ova` displays the qepcad help with `qepcad?`, but it cannot be used:



```
qepcad('(E x)[a x + b > 0]', vars='(a,b,x)')
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
RuntimeError: Unable to start QEPCAD
```

Btw., I get the same error at http://www.sagenb.org/. This should also be fixed. At http://sagecell.sagemath.org/ qepcad integration works!

Changing keywords from "" to "qepcad".

Same error at https://cloud.sagemath.com/, see [this sage-cloud thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-cloud/pollak/sage-cloud/-4MUdnRLdcs/ddFA7J0y7T0J).

[The inclusion procedure](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging.html#inclusion-procedure-for-new-and-updated-packages) says that qepcad needs to become an "optional package" first, and I assume that the current [qepcad-1.50.spkg](http://sagemath.org/packages/experimental/qepcad-1.50.spkg) has similar problems as the 1.54 spkg from #10224.

So please close this ticket as invalid for now. (I don't have the rights to do this.)

There are indeed too many systems on which this fails to install. Just got this error on my recent Gentoo Linux x86_64 system:

```
cd source; make   opt "CCo=g++" "FLAGSo=-O4" "CCd=g++" "FLAGSd=-g" "MAKE=make  "
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/local/src/sage-git/local/var/tmp/sage/build/qepcad-1.50/src/qesource/source'
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `qepcad.a()', needed by `opt'.  Stop.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/sage-git/local/var/tmp/sage/build/qepcad-1.50/src/qesource/source'
make: *** [opt] Error 2

```

I updated the description's QEPCAD link.

The install fail is now #19450.
