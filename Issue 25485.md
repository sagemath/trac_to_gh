# Issue 25485: Test jupyter kernel symlinks in tmpdir

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25722

The symlink tests for the jupyter kernel currently require write permission to `SAGE_SHARE`. This patch instead tests the symlinking capabilities on a kernel in a tmpdir. See also #25328.

Jeroen would you mind reviewing this? Its a very small change with a in my opinion pretty big advantage.

Makes sense and LGTM, plus passing on multiple patchbots. (A stylistic bikeshed that you can fix if you don't mind: `prefix = tmp_dir()` -> `prefix=tmp_dir()`)
