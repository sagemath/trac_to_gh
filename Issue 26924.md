Changing status from new to needs_info.

I'm not sure where we should put this documentation. In the section `Basic Rings and Fields`? In the section `Algebraic and Arithmetic Geometry` (since Tate algebras are building blocks for rigid varieties)? Elsewhere?

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

Tickets still needing working or clarification should be moved to the next release milestone at the soonest (please feel free to revert if you think the ticket is close to being resolved).

I have a quick question regarding the milestone. Given that the ticket is accepted now, will it be part of the 8.8 release?

Or should we change the milestone for that? Or is it too late in any case?

NO. 8.8 is finished.

No need to change the milestone. But you can if you want. Keeping 8.8 as milestone does not prevent the ticket to be closed in some 8.9 beta release.

I disagree.  The milestone should be changed.  It should have been changed before 8.8 even went into release candidate stage.  I would like to push us more towards using release milestones properly; as we use them currently they are not useful.
