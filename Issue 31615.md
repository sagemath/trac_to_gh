In sage several parents propose several implementations of the same parent such as `MatrixSpace` or `PolynomialRing`

```
sage: MatrixSpace(QQ, 3, 3, implementation='generic')
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Rational Field (using Matrix_generic_dense)
sage: MatrixSpace(QQ, 3, 3, implementation='gap')
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Rational Field (using Matrix_gap)
sage: PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', implementation='FLINT')
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', implementation='NTL')
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring (using NTL)
```

This ticket intends to extend, standardize, optimize and test parents with multiple implementations. Especially regarding
- reconstruction (should be part of `TestSuite`)
- conversion of elements between implementations
- handling of default constructor
