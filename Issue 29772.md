This is a good thing, but it is now possible that someone will hit an overflow error when doing computations that previously succeeded. Although I strongly suspect they would have been taking too long anyways, but I don't know enough to say for certain. However, I am not that worried about it.

Well, I do not see where there could be more overflow errors than before.

Neither do I, but I have been known to be paranoid about such things. `^^;;`
