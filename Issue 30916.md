Before this ticket:

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'a, b, c')
sage: a, b, c = R.gens()
sage: latex(a)  # good
a
sage: I = R.ideal(a**2 + a + 1)
sage: S = R.quotient(I, names=R.variable_names()).fraction_field()
sage: a, b, c = S.gens()
sage: latex(a)  # should be same as above
\text{\texttt{a}}
```
