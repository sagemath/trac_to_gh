CC:  zimmerma chapoton

Keywords: documentation, symbolic ring

in `SR.var?`,


```
* "n" -- (optional) nonnegative integer; number of symbolic
     variables, indexed from 0 to n-1
```


but it should say `positive`, because `SR.var('x', 0)` fails. 

(the exception message, `raise ValueError("the number of variables should be a positive integer")`, is indeed correct).

i've changed the example to the assignment, `x = SR.var('x', 4); x`, because it's the only way that it can be used later.
