Very minor things. Let's change the input block formats to match the style guide:

```diff
-        - ``certificate`` -- (default: ``False``) Whether to return
-          a certificate.
+        - ``certificate`` -- (default: ``False``) whether to return
+          a certificate
```

Also (while you're making these changes), some PEP8 fixes:

```diff
         if not certificate:
-            return self.rank()+1
+            return self.rank() + 1
 
         levels = self.level_sets()
         height = len(levels)
         if height == 0:
             return (0, [])
-        n = height-2
+        n = height - 2
```

Otherwise LGTM.
