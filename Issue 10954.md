# Issue 10954: revise the script sage-check-64

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11077

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2011-03-29 04:42:54

Assignee: GeorgSWeber

Keywords: 64-bit script

The script sage-check-64 should be revised:

 - it should help to protect users who for example set SAGE64="no", build Sage partially, set SAGE64="yes", and resume the build.

 - it should behave better with platforms other than Mac OS X and Solaris: right now, it silently accepts setting SAGE64=yes on any platform, resulting in extra compiler flags being passed in some spkgs.  Should it only pass these flags this on Mac OS X and Solaris?  If not, should it write the file SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/sage-64.txt on any platform?

 - should the status of the build, 32-bit or 64-bit, be stored in the aforementioned file sage-64.txt on any platform, whether or not SAGE64 is set?

 - should the variable SAGE64 be renamed to something more descriptive like SAGE_FORCE_64_BIT_BUILD?

See #10303 for further discussion.

I'm not aware of anywhere that the documentation says to set `SAGE64=no`. Is there a case for setting this to "_no_" If so, what would this do? If we added the -m32 flag everywhere, that would break various bits of code. 

However, I do agree that once a build is started without `SAGE64` being set to "_yes_", then we should not allow a build to be restarted with it set, as that produces a mix of 32-bit and 64-bit objects.

I think it would be most unwise to limit this to just OS X and Solaris. Firstly, it could be useful on other platforms like AIX. Combined with CFLAG64 it can be used with commercial compilers on both AIX and HP-UX. It can also be used as an aid to debugging Linux issues. See the posts on sage-support when I discovered someones 64-bit computer was building 32-bit objects on Linux. I suggested he set SAGE64=yes. He later posted his results:

That incidentally highlights a bug in bzip2, as that built 32-bit on linux, even with SAGE64 set. That is now #11107.

Yes. It would need some though on how best to do it though. Perhaps the "prereq" script is the place to do this. Just test for the `sizeof(long)`. 

>  - should the variable SAGE64 be renamed to something more descriptive like SAGE_FORCE_64_BIT_BUILD?

I agree SAGE64 is not a good name and SAGE_FORCE_64_BIT_BUILD would be better.

Though perhaps long-winded, SAGE_FORCE_64-BIT_BUILD_ON_PLATFORMS_DEFAULTING_TO_32-BIT would make it clearer exactly what the environment variable does, and stop people setting it by mistake, thinking they need it to get a 64-bit build on Linux. 

However, whilst I agree SAGE64 was a bad choice, there's no easy way of changing the variable everywhere

 * Sage library
 * Information on Wiki's.
 * Sage documentation. 
 * All .spkgs. The .spkg's could be done on an automated process, using a simple script, if the release manager did the following:
   * All the changes on one ticket, with one commit message on each .spkg. 
   * SPKG.txt was not updated. 
   * The version of the .spkg was not updated. 

Does the change of name warrant the hassle of changing it?

I just feel that ticket has got too complex to review - at least for me. 

I agree references to 64-bit are being produced too often. On a 64-bit build of Sage on OpenSolaris, with a bit of hand-editing of a C++ file to resolve a core dump, I see unnecessary and inaccurate 64-bit junk every time Sage is started.

PS, even if we store this file, I don't think `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` is the place to store it. A text file is not a library.

Some of these were fixed at #12789. Given the vague description and no activity on this ticket, I'm going to close this.
