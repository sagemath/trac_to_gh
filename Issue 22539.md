This was motivated by, but does not solve #22768.

Currently the `spkg-install` for the pythons does a post-install check that some of the compiled extension modules are actually importable.  The problem with this is that it's post-install, so one can still wind up with a partially broken python install.

Unfortunately, there's no good way (without patching, at least) for Python's build to exit if one of the extension modules (which are ostensibly optional) fails to build.  So this patch just scans the build output for the magic string "Failed to build these modules:" and treats the build as failed if found.

This still might not be fool-proof (an extension module might somehow compile but still not be working), so this keeps the post-install checks as well.  But this will at least catch more issues in build, before install.

Do we care if some of the extension modules are broken? Wouldn't it be better to test the ones that matter to us, one by one? That is what is currently done with `python2` and the `_scproxy` module on Darwin.

This is what I was asking about. One general philosophy is to test only for the features you need and to not care if other parts are broken. You are taking a different approach: test everything, and then if someone eventually points out a feature that is broken that we don't need, then we can decide to ignore it.

Yes, I don't think this is needed now.  One thing that might be good is to add more modules to the list of modules that are tested for importability after the Python build.  For example, this ticket added a test to see if sqlite3 is importable which previously was not tested for.

I could either rewrite this ticket just to add sqlite3 to that list, or open a new ticket for it.
