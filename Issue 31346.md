# Issue 31346: Deprecate quaternion_order() method of quaternion ideals

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31583

Original creator: pbruin

Original creation time: 2021-03-30 18:23:51

Keywords: quaternion algebra

The method `quaternion_order()` of `QuaternionFractionalIdeal_rational` may return a different result depending on whether the left and/or right order of the ideal have been computed.  In this ticket we deprecate this method, as well as `ring()`, which behaves identically, and recommend using `left_order()` or `right_order()` instead.

After the `ring()` method is removed (in a future ticket), calling `ring()` will return the ambient quaternion algebra rather than an order.  This is consistent with the behaviour for fractional ideals of number fields.
