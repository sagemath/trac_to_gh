Hello Frédéric, thanks for this enhancement, it can indeed be useful! Everything seems good (let's wait for the patchbot). Small detail: there should be a colon after the word "INPUT" in the docstring of `is_triangular`.

Ideally, apply pep8 to the examples blocks
(spaces after commas) to encourage good habits.

Triangularly speaking, other wishes
(admittedly out of scope here) include:

- enumeration of triangular matrices
- random triangular matrices
