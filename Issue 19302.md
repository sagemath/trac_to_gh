# Issue 19302: make Graphics.plot refuses argument

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: vdelecroix

Currently `Graphics.plot` ignore all input arguments which make the following very confusing

```
sage: S = circle((0,0), 1)
sage: T = S.plot(aspect_ratio=2)
sage: T.aspect_ratio()
1.0
```


We simply disallow arguments in order to have

```
sage: S.plot(aspect_ratio=1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: plot() got an unexpected keyword argument 'aspect_ratio'
```

What about a courageous review?

Let's try:

```diff
-    if hasattr(funcs, 'plot'):
+    if isinstance(funcs, Graphics):
+        G = funcs
+    elif hasattr(funcs, 'plot'):
```


Why would you ignore (without warning) the contents of `*args` and `**kwds` when 'funcs' is a Graphics object? It seems as bad as what you try to fix in this branch.

More or less. `Graphics` is precisely the class that implemented

```
def plot(self, *args, **kwds):
    return self
```

And nobody inherits from it.

I did it because some code is calling plot(x)... you are right that it would be better to fix it instead.

What do you think that the following should do

```
sage: C = circle((0,0), 1)
sage: plot(C, aspect_ratio=2)
```

It used to return C unchanged and it still does. What my code is modifying is

```
sage: C.plot(aspect_ratio=2)
... -> error
```

If it ignores the 'aspect_ratio=2' argument then it should raise an exception instead, exactly as you do it in this branch for `C.plot(whatever=3)`?
