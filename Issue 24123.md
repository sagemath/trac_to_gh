ccache fails to  pass self-tests on my 32bit VM, while it did not before. I am not sure what created the regression. Log attached.

OK, that is not only on 32bit VM, even my standard 64bit laptop hits the issue (very similar logdir, lot of "Failed; falling back to running the real compiler"), you should be able to reproduce on your own.

I will upgrade `ccache` in #22836 to the latest version available. It may or may not help here.

OK `ccache-3.3.4` passes its test suite with gcc 7.2.0 on my Gentoo  box. I will push a branch to #22836 shortly.

Changing keywords from "" to "sdl".
