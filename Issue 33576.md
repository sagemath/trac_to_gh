From https://ask.sagemath.org/question/62321/order-of-coefficients-of-univariate-polynomial-bug-or-feature/: given

```
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: f = 1 + 2 * x + 3 * x**3
```

`f.coefficients()` returns `(1, 2, 3)` (increasing order of degree, omitting zero terms), similar for `f.exponents()`, while `f.monomials()` returns `[x**3, x, 1]`. The sorting for multivariate polynomials is in decreasing order of degree, and it is documented that way. The single variable case should be documented as well, by specifying how the coefficients are sorted and perhaps by pointing out consistency with `exponents` and inconsistency with `monomials`.
