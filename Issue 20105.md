CC:  dlucas

Keywords: linear code, beginner

The "rate" of a linear code is `k/n` where `k` is the dimension and `n` the length of the code. This is fundamental number that all coding theorists use. This should be available for any linear code in Sage.

Note that it should be implemented on the class `AbstractLinearCode` to be available to both `LinearCode` and specific families of codes such as `GeneralizedReedSolomonCode`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20342

Hello,

I implemented a generic method to compute the rate of a code.
Setting to `needs-review`.

Hi David,

the docstring "Return the ratio of information symbols to code length." should be "Return the ratio of the number of information symbols to the code length."
