Sage uses a convention to append `.pNUM` to indicate patched or updated packages. However, because of the logic in `installed_packages(False)`, the version number returned by `installed_packages(False)` is the version given by `pip` instead of the Sage version number.

This causes in particular that optional doctests are not run for such packages.
