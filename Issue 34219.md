Keywords: piecewise

Implemented piecewise polynomial on realsets. This new class take one variable polynomial as input function and realsets as input domain. It contain add, multiplication, subtraction, divide real number, compute derivative, determine continuous, finding limit, right and left limit and finding which_pair functions.

Changing type from task to enhancement.

```
+class Piecewise_Polynomial(ModuleElement):
```

This naming scheme does not follow our common usage.

It should be changed to one of these:
- `PiecewisePolynomial` -- following the general Python convention for naming of classes
- `PiecewiseFunction_polynomial` -- when the intention is that there is a public constructor `PiecewiseFunction` with several private implementation classes such as `PiecewiseFunction_multi_polynomial`, `PiecewiseFunction_neural_network`, ...

Yes, I agree that this should be a `ModuleElement`.
Now to which module (vector space) should it belong?

This code didn't use any properties from `ModuleElement`. I'm wondering if you know any sample codes or if there is any way would be helpful for me to learn how to adapt the `ModuleElement` into the current code. Thank you so much for any suggestions!

Take a look at `CombinatorialFreeModule` (defined in `sage.combinat.free_module`) and the element class `IndexedFreeModuleElement` (defined in `sage.modules.with_basis.indexed_element`)
