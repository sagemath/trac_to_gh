K(0).numerator_ideal() currently returns a Value Error, but it should return the 0 ideal.

Note that this patch also includes the changes proposed in [http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/11554](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/11554) (since that patch was created on a different computer and the changes were not in my local version of Sage; I thought they should all be in one place). So this ticket effectively replaces the other.

I still don't understand why you changed the documentation of the `denominator_ideal()` method.

His modified version is much, much clearer as a definition.  It's closer to what you find if you look in more general commutative algebra books.   What was there before -- writing as N/D -- is more algorithmic, and requires one to be in the special situation of Dedekind domain where unique factorization of ideals holds.   For example, if you define the denominator ideal of x as the ideal of elements of Frac(R) that multiply x into R, then this definition makes sense for any order R, even though we do not have unique factorization of ideals in R.   It is thus better as a definition.

I guess you mean "elements of R", otherwise the denominator of 2 would be (1/2).

I think the documentation of numerator_ideal() could use a similar change, for now it still mentions 'non-zero'.  The numerator ideal is just the intersection of R with aR.

Converted into a Git branch and made a reviewer patch with further documentation improvements, please check.
