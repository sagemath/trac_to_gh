* In the method `_create_print_table`, the argument `col_titles` was renamed `cols`;
  please update the `INPUT` section accordingly.
* Take this opportunity to change the one-line description from `Creates` to `Create`.
* Some spaces are missing after commas in structures like `for a,b in c` or in function
  or method arguments.

Can you add a doctest showing how the code is enhanced?

It seems simpler to just copy/paste the file I need from Sage. This is a shame.
