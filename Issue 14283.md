In the `lrcalc` package:

```
jdemeyer@boxen:~/spkg/lrcalc-1.1.6$ ls -l src/m4
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 jdemeyer jdemeyer 29 Apr 25 11:46 libtool.m4 -> /usr/share/aclocal/libtool.m4
lrwxrwxrwx 1 jdemeyer jdemeyer 31 Apr 25 11:46 ltoptions.m4 -> /usr/share/aclocal/ltoptions.m4

lrwxrwxrwx 1 jdemeyer jdemeyer 33 Apr 25 11:46 lt~obsolete.m4 -> /usr/share/aclocal/lt~obsolete.m4
```

These are **broken** symbolic links and should be replaced by the actual files (or removed altogether).

I just had a look at the diff and it looks good. I also installed the package and ran the tests (of the spkg and in sage/libs/lrcalc).

In the long run it will be best when upstream (Anders!) fixes the aforementionned issues, but that does the job in the mean time!

Thanks Jeroen!
