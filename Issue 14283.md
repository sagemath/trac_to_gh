These are **broken** symbolic links and should be replaced by the actual files (or removed altogether).

I have no answer from upstream yet... perhaps I should just release `lrcalc-1.1.6.p0` with fixed sources?

I just had a look at the diff and it looks good. I also installed the package and ran the tests (of the spkg and in sage/libs/lrcalc).

In the long run it will be best when upstream (Anders!) fixes the aforementionned issues, but that does the job in the mean time!

Thanks Jeroen!
