# Issue 13534: wrap debug output functions from GiNaC

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13738

Original creator: burcin

Original creation time: 2012-11-21 16:22:29

Assignee: burcin

Attached patch provides access to `dbgprint()` and `dbgprintree()` methods from GiNaC.

The output is sent to `stderr`, so the examples are not doctested.

This looks pretty straightforward to review, and patchbot likes it, though of course we aren't actually testing.

This used to be a good excuse, but the new doctesting framework catches `stderr` too. So you can and should add doctests.

Can you point us to an example, or is just a normal doctest sufficient?

Is this sufficient?  You can put to 'needs work' if not.
