Keywords: modular symbols

This is a follow up ticket on the recently closed #21046, where new code for numerical modular symbols for elliptic curves was added.

1. Issue

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve("20a1")
sage: m = E.modular_symbol_numerical()
sage: m(1/2)
```

fails as it attempts to use the code for unitary cusps.

2. Bug

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve("361a1")
sage: ms = E.modular_symbol(+1,implementation="num")
sage: ms(1/19)
158837/603592
sage: _*19.
4.99990556534878
```

is a problem with rounding. The correct value is 5/19.

I will continue to ad if I find things. But if part is solved I will move it on to a next tickets to separate issues when possible.

This ticket changes some behaviour of the algorithm and it now produces different values than before.            

```
sage: f(1/7)      # abs tol 1e-4
-            1.00001356670155
+            0.999844176260303
```

is a case where it actually matters.

It is probably a matter of opinion and taste in the end, but I would like to keep output that is not 1.0 for this as it illustrates the errors that are made. If an exact value is needed, one should not use the approximating functions, anyway.

Of course the trailing spaces need to be removed.

Of course your algorithm does not return the exact value. By "expected value" I meant "actual value that the numerical algorithm approximates". Sorry for my unprecise english.

To my mind, you are contradicting yourself.
- If you want to test the actual output of the algorithm then don't write `# abs tol` at all.
- If you want to test how close your algorithm gives an answer to the real one, then do write
  {{{
  sage: my_function(xyz)   # abs. tol 1e-5
  exact_value_that_I_should_be_expecting
  }}}
- If you want to emphasize that the answer is non-exact to the reader, then the detail of the output does not matter. And there is no need to update anything.

You are in between these three: you use `# abs. tol` but at the same time claim that what is written in the output should match the actual value. I have hard time figuring out the purpose of it.

Should that be considered as a regression?

The issue is easy explained with an example. Say

```
sage: def my_pi(prec=100):
....:     return sqrt(6*sum( 1./n^2 for n in [1..prec] ))
sage: my_pi(10)
3.04936163598207
sage: my_pi(1000)
3.14063805620599
```

I think the doc test for my_pi should NOT check if the answer of my_pi(10) is pi up to n digit, it should check if that given precise answer 3.04936163598207 is exact up to 8 digits, say.

It is a regression in precision, but a speedup. In analogy with the above, the algorithm used to sum 1000 terms when asked to compute it so that the answer can be proven to be smaller than epsilon = 0.1. Now it only needs to do 100 terms and we still know how to prove that the answer is within 0.1. The bounds on convergenve of the sequence are much worst than the actual convergence, so with 100 or 1000 terms it comes close to the actual answer, yet with 100 maybe the error is not 0.0001 rather than 0.00000001.

The basic idea behind the algorithm is that we approximate an integer with an infinite sum. So we want to prove rigorously that the error is <0.5. I can estimate the error of the absolute sum which is an upper bound to the error. I don't want to do any extra work, so I am happy if the answer has an error of 0.1.

Does that help?

Oh, that is just the usual issue with floating point computations: There is noise depending on the system; so one can not ask for the number to be equal until the last digit. The cython file uses usual llong, int, but also mpfr Real Numbers.
http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#special-markup-to-influence-doctests .

Is this not what has to be done with all floating point results?

mpfr does behave the same on any platform (or it is a bug). Numerical noise mostly comes from machine `float` and `double`. So it is not yet clear to me that there is numerical noise.

Even though there would be numerical noise, you don't expect it to affect 70% of the digits of your computations. In other words, you should be using `# abs. tol e-13` and not `# abs. tol e-4`.
