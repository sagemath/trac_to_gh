# Issue 20477: LatticePoset: add is_join_semidistributive

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20714

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2016-05-30 14:51:21

This patch will add a function to check if a lattice is join-semidistributive or not.

Backend can also check for meet-semidistributive and give a "certificate", i.e. elements failing the definition of semidistributive. It is not used at this time.

Ready for review, or at least for comments. I don't know about examples, but just now can not invent anything better.

missing doctest continuation here:

```
+            sage: H = HasseDiagram({0:[1, 2], 1:[3, 4], 2:[4, 5], 3:[6],
+                                    4:[6], 5:[6]})
```

And shortcut based on covering relations count is in wrong place.

I don't like this test system that does not detect missing continuation line.

OK, maybe this works.

It would be a good idea to think about this, not just blindly translate the definition to code. Maybe later.

You can also use `\neq` instead of `\not=`.
