Haven't seen this before. Do you have something strange in `~/.polymake`?


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2019-08-29 17:30:04

What do you mean by strange?

```
$ ls ~/.polymake/
customize.pl  history  prefer.pl  wrappers.0  wrappers.1  wrappers.2  wrappers.3
```

Though, after `mv .polymake .TMPpolymake` compilation went fine.

My `~/.polymake` folder came from archlinux which ships polymake version 3.5. Might be the source of the trouble.

Perhaps some permissions were set wrong in that folder?

I am the owner of the files in `~/.polymake/`. I did not add manually anything special. And polymake from the system is working fine.

The only reason I can imagine is that polymake 3.5 (from the system) did install some stuff in `~/.polymake/` that perturbed the build of polymake 3.4.
- Is it worth a report to polymake dev?
- Should we have a `spkg-configure.m4` to avoid building polymake if already present on the system?
- Should we have some kind of warning when `./polymake` is already populated?

Replying to [comment:6 vdelecroix]:
> - Is it worth a report to polymake dev?

Yes, please do report upstream.

> - Should we have a `spkg-configure.m4` to avoid building polymake if already present on the system?

Yes, after we upgrade to 3.5. The interface using jupymake requires a threadsafety patch to polymake 3.4; 3.5 has a solution

> - Should we have some kind of warning when `./polymake` is already populated?

No, I don't think so, let's just switch to 3.5 soon.

I think this can be closed

Changing status from new to needs_review.


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2020-04-25 02:40:01

Because a newer polymake is included now?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-04-25 02:51:09

This build failure was a user configuration error


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2020-04-25 13:35:27

Got it, so Vincent can just confirm to positive review in that case - sorry to ask, it just wasn't clear.


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2020-04-25 18:27:12

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.
