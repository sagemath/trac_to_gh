This can be useful to have a poset relabeled in an increasing way by numbers.

This is a very good addition.

However there is no documentation at all (neither in input section nor examples) about relabeling with a list or tuple. Hence I mark this as needs_work. I guess the part "Here we relabel the elements of a poset by {0,1,2,...}" can be removed then.

Is "- - relabeled by integers according to one of its linear extensions." enought? Hmm... maybe "- - relabeled by integers according to one of its linear extensions; that is, relabeled so that i<j (as integers) whenever i<j in the poset."?

If relabeling is `None`, I would just relabel this with `._element_to_vertex_dict`.

And when you are on this, the note section is not exactly true, try


```
P = Poset({1:[]}); Q = P.relabel(); P._hasse_diagram is Q._hasse_diagram
```

Thanks. I changed the doc and simplified the code.

The note is true for ==, so it can stay unchanged.

"integers from 0 to n-1", not to n.

Otherwise good, so mark positive_review after the correction.
