Sometimes it is convenient to set up a polytope without triggering the computation of the full (minimal) double description. 
Currently, `Polyhedron` does not support this; one either needs to work with lists of vertices or lists of inequalities; for an H-representation going through `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` is another option.

A "lazy" backend for `Polyhedron` could be considered. 
But there are open questions regarding the possible design. All `Polyhedron` methods currently guarantee minimal representations. This is reflected also in the names of methods for accessing the V-represenation, such as `vertex_generator`; but not in those for the H-representation (`inequality_generator`). (Note the `minimize` argument is unused in the whole `Polyhedron` code.) Compare with polymake, which has a clear distinction between minimal and non-minimal presentations (VERTICES vs. POINTS).

Here is just a note about constructing from both V- and H- representation:

The method `as_polyhedron` of `PolyhedronFaces` would benefit greatly from this, so perhaps as a follow-up or on this ticket.

This is an early draft, with the purpose of supporting #31799. Comments and improvements to the design are very welcome.

One thing needed for #31799 is finding the parent early - then, for parents that implement init from both representations, one could efficiently compute the double description before calling the element constructor.

What is the status here?

I think the minimal/non-minimal issue should really be fixed. In a way, it is only relevant for `Polyhedron_mutual`. If the backend doesn't allow modification, then what is the point in being lazy?

I really don't know what name choices what make sense and involve little deprecation.
Do we need anything but minimal representation? For the input sure, but once you are asking for `Vrepresentation` or `Hrepresentation` or `inequalities`, you usually want something minimal. But then again, if I construct `P` and `Q` only to compute their intersection, I don't care about the minimal inequalities in many cases.
