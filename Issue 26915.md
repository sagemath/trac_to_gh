> Could it be `b'x'`, not `'x'` in `GF(9,'x')` ?

Why should it? The traceback says that the error occurs in the function `meataxe_init`, in the line that translates `os.path.join(...)` to some global constant of type `char*`. Hence, has nothing to do with `GF(9,'x')`, which does work, by the way:

```
sage: GF(9,'x')
Finite Field in x of size 3^2

Do I understand correctly that the argument of an error should be str, not bytes?

This

```
MtxLibDir = PyBytes_AsString(str_to_bytes(os.path.join(DOT_SAGE,'meataxe')))
```

could be written in a more Cythonic way as

```
MtxLibDir = str_to_bytes(os.path.join(DOT_SAGE, 'meataxe'))
```

Generally, such explicit `PyBytes_AsString` calls are not needed in Cython.

Do I understand correctly: `str_to_bytes` converts a Python bytes to a Python str, and when assigning it to `MtxLibDir` it will automatically converted to `char*`?

In that case, I should certainly drop the `PyBytes/String_...` functions totally (also in pickling).

I had to do it this way because `MtxLibDir` is a statically allocated `char[1024]` array, so I couldn't just assign to it directly.  Perhaps Jeroen knows a better way (other than just using `strcpy()` directly or something).

Another problem here is that ofc if `len(os.path.join(DOT_SAGE, 'meataxe'))` does not fit in the array (unlikely, but not impossible) its value will be truncated.  We should probably check for this and raise a `RuntimeError` or something.

I didn't care about zero termination before, so, probably it works without it. But again, it seems safer.

The existing Cython-generated code for that boils down to

```
memcpy(MtxLibDir, PyBytes_AsString(...), sizeof(MtxLibDir))
```

In other words, it assumes that it's given a string of the correct size. This is therefore definitely a bug to be fixed.

Indeed:

```
Error compiling Cython file:
------------------------------------------------------------
...
cdef inline meataxe_init():
    ## Assign to a variable that enables MeatAxe to find
    ## its multiplication tables.
    from sage.env import DOT_SAGE

    mtxdir = str_to_bytes(os.path.join(DOT_SAGE, 'meataxe'))
                         ^
------------------------------------------------------------

```

But I guess it should be imported at module level (however, meataxe_init is only called once anyway, when the module is loaded, so, having the import in the function won't hurt).

I mean, you still need `import os`, just at module-level.

I guess the "forbidden" comparison is this:

```python

        if self.Data:
            for i in range(self.Data.Nor):

`self.Data.Nor` is `int`, `i` is `size_t`.

What to do? At some point I was told to use size_t to iterate through sizes (and the number of rows of a matrix *is* a size, although MeatAxe uses a signed type for it).

Is Cython clever enough to do the right thing if it sees `for i in range(self.Data.Nor)` without an explicit type declaration for `i`?

No, just the `import os`.  The inline import of `from sage.env import DOT_SAGE` is necessary because the value of `DOT_SAGE` can in principle be changed at runtime, so by importing it at module-level you only ever get its original value.  The alternative in this case is 

`from sage import env`

and then later use `env.DOT_SAGE`.

Either way is fine but for global variables that can change value you have to be careful about this.

Yes, while I'm at it...

The problem is that upstream is not consequent in using signed and unsigned types. `FfCurrentRowSize` is `size_t`, but `nc`/`nr` (number of columns/rows) is `int`, but naturally the current row size is closely related with the number of columns.

With the latest commit, I am down to a single warning, and I don't see how to reduce it further, since I have a variable that in one place is compared against `FfCurrenrRowSize` but in another place (in the same function `mtx_unpickle`) is compared against `FfCurrentRowSize*nr`.

Can we live with this warning?

According to meataxe.pxd, we have

```python
    cdef extern size_t FfCurrentRowSize # The byte size of a single row in memory,
                                        # always a multiple of sizeof(long)
    cdef extern size_t FfCurrentRowSizeIo # The number of bytes actually used in a row
```

In my current code, I have

```python
    cdef int lenData = len(Data)
    cdef size_t pickled_rowsize
    cdef int i
    if Data:
        if nr <= 0 or nc <= 0:
            raise ValueError("This matrix pickle contains data, thus, the number of rows and columns must be positive")
        pickled_rowsize = <size_t>lenData//<size_t>nr
        if lenData != pickled_rowsize*nr:
            raise ValueError(f"Expected a pickle with {FfCurrentRowSizeIo}*{nr} bytes, got {lenData} instead")
        x = Data
        if pickled_rowsize == FfCurrentRowSizeIo:
            pt = OUT.Data.Data
            for i in range(nr):
                memcpy(pt,x,FfCurrentRowSizeIo)
                x += FfCurrentRowSizeIo
                FfStepPtr(&(pt))
                sig_check()
        elif pickled_rowsize >= FfCurrentRowSizeIo:
            deprecation(23411, "Reading this pickle may be machine dependent")
            if pickled_rowsize == FfCurrentRowSize:
                memcpy(OUT.Data.Data, x, OUT.Data.RowSize*OUT.Data.Nor)
            else:
                pt = OUT.Data.Data
                for i in range(nr):
                    memcpy(pt,x,FfCurrentRowSizeIo)
                    x += pickled_rowsize
                    FfStepPtr(&(pt))
                    sig_check()
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Expected a pickle with {FfCurrentRowSizeIo}*{nr} bytes, got {pickled_rowsize}*{nr} instead")
```

```C
extern size_t FfCurrentRowSize;

I didn't know that - I thought having a type in pxd means that there would be an automatic conversion.

Thank you! What is not clear to me: *How* to test? After all, lots of Py3-doctests fail anyway. So, how to know that the ticket doesn't introduce a new failure?

In any case:

I wouldn't use an `assert` statement here:

```
assert len(mtxdir)<1024, "The string os.path.join(DOT_SAGE, 'meataxe') needs to be of length < 1024 --- it is too long"
```

instead, something like

```
if len(mtxdir) >= 1024:
    raise RuntimeError(f"the path for the meataxe library {mtxdir!r} is too long, it needs to be of length < 1024")
```


Then various nitpicks:

Why change whitespace here? PEP 8 prefers the original form

```diff
-            pickle_str = PyBytes_FromStringAndSize(d, pickle_size)
+            pickle_str = PyBytes_FromStringAndSize( d, pickle_size )
```


Here, you might as well keep the `#` aligned:

```diff
     cdef extern int MPB                 # Number of marks stored in a single byte
     cdef extern size_t FfCurrentRowSize # The byte size of a single row in memory,
                                         # always a multiple of sizeof(long)
-    cdef extern size_t FfCurrentRowSizeIo # The number of bytes actually used in a row
+    cdef extern int FfCurrentRowSizeIo # The number of bytes actually used in a row
     cdef extern char MtxLibDir[1024]    # Where to search/create multiplication tables
```


This is a very long line, better split it in multiple statements. Also consider using an f-string:

```
PyErr_SetObject(ErrMsg.get(ErrText.split(': ')[-1], RuntimeError), "{} in file {} (line {})".format(ErrText, char_to_str(err.FileInfo.BaseName), err.LineNo))
```

I wanted to find out if using `Py_ssize_t` fixes the problem for good, or if it just shifts the problem.

These seem to be exactly the errors remaining in vanilla sage with python3 in the matrix module:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/matrix/docs.py  # 4 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx  # 2 doctests failed

sage -t --long src/sage/matrix/matrix_mpolynomial_dense.pyx  # 5 doctests failed
```

Replying to [comment:60 jdemeyer]:

For the record:

```
sage: %time M = matrix(GF(243), 2^16, 2^16)
CPU times: user 7min 31s, sys: 916 ms, total: 7min 31s
Wall time: 7min 32s
sage: pickle = dumps(M)
<crash>
```

Why is it taking 1 hour on your machine?

In any case, the problem isn't solved with the new commit, and I don't understand the stack backtrace. Part of it:

Suggestion: This ticket should focus on Py3. If I see that correctly, meataxe/matrix_gfpn_dense now *does* work with py3, and therefore the ticket should be reviewed.

For the segfault and related problems, I suggest to open a different ticket. There definitely seems something wrong when big matrices are involved:

```
sage: %time M = matrix(GF(243), 2^16, 2^16)
CPU times: user 7min 23s, sys: 1.06 s, total: 7min 24s
Wall time: 7min 25s
sage: M[0,0]
0
sage: M[2^16-1,0]
0
sage: M[2^16-1,2^16-1]
0
sage: M[2^16-1,2^16-1] = 123
sage: M[2^16-1,2^16-1]    # wrong
0
```

So, the new ticket should be about overflows (which is orthogonal to the py3-problem).

The problem is that it's already too late for that. You are already making many changes unrelated to Python 3, so I'm reviewing those changes too. And I have to make sure that there are no regressions.

I generally don't like extremes.

The compromise, from my perspective, is to acknowledge that the reviewer's time is more efficiently spent with looking at smaller changes that really focus on one ticket's topic.

Therefore, I re-ordered and partially rebased the commits, so that here are only the bits that make meataxe workwith py3 (plus some cosmetical change, aligning comments in meataxe.pxd). The other commits will be part of #27198, where they belong.

I will now move to #27198 and hope that all py3 issues are dealt with.

Looking at the C-API documentation [https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/bytes.html](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/bytes.html) it looks like the Python bytes data structure already has room for a trailing 0. It's not going to be a big difference, but going forward it's perhaps something to keep in mind.
