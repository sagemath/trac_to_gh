If I remember well, I historically asked for that normalisation of C++ standard to c++11 to lift the default we should be using. It may be useless now except in some cases (I am looking at you giac). As a matter of fact I just released a new version of brial and the main point of the release was removing features deleted in c++17 which means standard could be lifted there.

Our configure script sets the flags to `-std=gnu++11`. (This is standard autoconf behavior - autoconf does not know about newer standards.)

Supported GCC versions (GCC >= 6.3 since #33316) have default `std=c++14` (according to https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx14).
(Haven't checked what the default is in XCode "gcc" (clang).)

Yes, we have a small number of files that explicitly ask for `-std=c++11`. Pretty sure that we can at least change it to `-std=gnu++11`.

I have kept the little bit of code that watches for `-std=c...` in C++ mode. I don't think it's needed for anything, but it does not hurt

That's great, but as long as we accept old system installations of brial, we'll have to keep the flag

To me, it looks like a no-op right now. Does nothing when matching and nothing is set to trigger something later.

The `continue` skips the `append`

Right, it skips to the end of the for loop, not just the next level of conditional. I have to have a refresher on python standard.

This really need to be bot checked for side effects. Code looks OK, but I feel like it needs to be tested on more than one setup before getting a positive review.

Note that after #32406, this code is only run if the user uses `configure --disable-editable`. So we won't see it in the bots

Ouch. So, sage-on-gentoo may be on the front row for that since it is the only way I distribute it. Should be the same for all sage-on-distro if they know what they are doing.

Because of the testing situation, I will say let's get it in and start collect feedback as we go. I don't particularly like the "methodology" but our testing is currently not handling that.

Thanks!

The tests of the modularized distributions (#33817) do still use this code, so it is still tested a bit, just not on more than 1 platform.
