If I remember well, I historically asked for that normalisation of C++ standard to c++11 to lift the default we should be using. It may be useless now except in some cases (I am looking at you giac). As a matter of fact I just released a new version of brial and the main point of the release was removing features deleted in c++17 which means standard could be lifted there.

Our configure script sets the flags to `-std=gnu++11`. (This is standard autoconf behavior - autoconf does not know about newer standards.)

Supported GCC versions (GCC >= 6.3 since #33316) have default `std=c++14` (according to https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx14).

That's great, but as long as we accept old system installations of brial, we'll have to keep the flag
