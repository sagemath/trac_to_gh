# Issue 15844: Python 3 preparation: "xrange()" is gone and "range()" becomes an iterator

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16081

Original creator: wluebbe

Original creation time: 2014-04-07 09:06:37

Keywords: python3

The tool 2to3 renames `xrange()` to `range()` and wraps existing `range()` usages with `list()`.


But the code has to depend on the Python version!

There are 293 effected modules. 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

Going ahead and closing (unless you disagree) since it's not a real change to commit.  There aren't too many range-related issues remaining (and those that do remain are mostly in classes/functions that should accept `range` objects as arguments but currently don't).
