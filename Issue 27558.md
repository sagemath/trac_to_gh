I agree, but `bootstrap`, of course, gets run automatically by `make install`. At least in my test I verified that it was run and that your configuration script detected a non-GNU Term::Readline.

I would be inclined to set it to positive review, but it could perhaps use another round of testing on a Linux system.

Hi, I know that this ticket is closed, by I thought it makes sense to mention this here anyways:

I just installed polymake through sage on my office computer and it was not working unless the experimental package `perl_term_readline_gnu` was installed.

Now, this is without the present ticket, but perhaps my question is still relevant: shouldn't `perl_term_readline_gnu` be a dependancy of polymake?

Now, I checked... It is a dependency but I have no idea why it did not install it at first run (it is true that the installation crashed due to the lack of json, that I then fixed) and then installing polymake again perhaps thought that `perl_term_readline_gnu` was succesfully installed. That could explain it.

--> In any case, having polymake move slowly to a stable optional package is definitely a huge positive progress. Thanks for this work!
