this is a slightly non-standard perl module we happen to have an spkg for, used in polymake interface.

Seems to work on macOS, where Term::Readline is non-GNU.

for some reason I not only had to run `./bootstrap`, but also `aclocal` ---
otherwise the new macro in m4/ just didn’t want to get expanded.

Worked for me without even calling bootstrap explicitly.

Without `./bootstrap` the answer would be always "no", regardless of good Term::ReadLine::Gnu being available. Cause the `m4` file in question gets collected by `./bootstrap` into `m4/sage_spkg_configures.m4` to be used in `./configure`. 

Without running `./bootstrap` it won't make any difference.

I agree, but `bootstrap`, of course, gets run automatically by `make install`. At least in my test I verified that it was run and that your configuration script detected a non-GNU Term::Readline.

I would be inclined to set it to positive review, but it could perhaps use another round of testing on a Linux system.

I just tried on stable Debian, and without debian package `libterm-readline-gnu-perl`
the spkg is marked as to be installed, whereas if I install `libterm-readline-gnu-perl`
then it is marked as not to be installed.

Yikes now we have to go searching for perl modules too?  Nevertheless, thank you for taking care of it.

Yes we can! Onward with experimental interfaces to Haskell, Julia, Coq! :-)

Hi, I know that this ticket is closed, by I thought it makes sense to mention this here anyways:

I just installed polymake through sage on my office computer and it was not working unless the experimental package `perl_term_readline_gnu` was installed.

Now, this is without the present ticket, but perhaps my question is still relevant: shouldn't `perl_term_readline_gnu` be a dependancy of polymake?

Now, I checked... It is a dependency but I have no idea why it did not install it at first run (it is true that the installation crashed due to the lack of json, that I then fixed) and then installing polymake again perhaps thought that `perl_term_readline_gnu` was succesfully installed. That could explain it.

--> In any case, having polymake move slowly to a stable optional package is definitely a huge positive progress. Thanks for this work!

hmm, installation of what package did crash due to no json?

polymake. But that was my mistake, I did not install the perl-json package prior to running `./sage -i polymake`. Then installed json, then ran `./sage -i polymake` with success, but apparently skipped the dependency.
