In #29124 the text files describing prerequisite package
names for each distribution moved from `build/pkgs/*.txt`
to `build/pkgs/_prereq/distros/*.txt`.

This ticket updates links in the README accordingly.

Add link to current develop README in ticket description.

Since this ticket was merged in Sage 9.4.beta4,
that now has the correct links.
