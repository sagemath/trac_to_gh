Computing a basis of a particular `m`-torsion subgroup is an important subroutine in several algorithms for isogenies and endomorphism rings of elliptic curves over finite fields.

This patch adds a `.torsion_basis()` method to `EllipticCurve_finite_field`. Its current implementation is merely a thin wrapper around `.abelian_group()` and `.torsion_subgroup()` — the point of this patch is to introduce the interface first so that more optimizations can be incorporated later.
