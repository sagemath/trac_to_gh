`[-oo]`, `[+oo]` and `[-oo,+oo]` are three very different intervals. Though Sage is ignoring the difference between the first two in printing

```
sage: a = RBF(-infinity)
sage: b = RBF(+infinity)
sage: a
[+/- inf]
sage: b
[+/- inf]
```

Even though they are different

```
sage: a.endpoints()
(-infinity, -infinity)
sage: b.endpoints()
(+infinity, +infinity)
```


For the last interval `[-oo,+oo]` the following should work but does not

```
sage: RBF([-infinity,infinity])
nan
sage: RBF([-infinity,infinity]).endpoints()
(NaN, NaN)
```

Not only Sage, but arb itself (intentionally, I think).

`@`Frederik: is the printing of arb infinities intentional? Shouldn't `[-oo ± c]`, `[+oo ± c]` and `[c ± oo]` be printed differently?

The rationale for arb_get_str / arb_printn behavior was to minimize the amount of irrelevant information when there are no digits of a real number to print; the idea is to show what the ball represents, not the representation of the ball itself. This is in particular why [c +/- inf] prints as [+/- inf]. However, I'm open to printing +inf and -inf explicitly. One reason for not doing this in the first place was to sidestep the decision of whether [+inf +/- 3] should be printed as such or as +inf. The latter is not ideal, but it is more consistent with the interpretation I gave above, and I found that it is better to avoid printing any digits for non-finite balls. When I scan a long printout of values (coefficients in a polynomial or matrix, say), I found that any digits mislead me to think that there are finite balls present. However, it would be reasonable to print the c's in [c +/- inf] or [inf +/- c] when ARB_STR_MORE is used.
