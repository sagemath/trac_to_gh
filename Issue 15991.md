Keywords: tachyon, verbose, beginner

`Tachyon.save` and `Tachyon.show` have their own arguments for verbose output and do not pay attention to the verbosity levels set by `sage.misc.misc.set_verbose`.  This makes for inconsistent and confusing interface.

Instead of checking the value of an optional argument, these methods should check sage's verbosity setting.  This is done implicitly when messages are printed with `sage.misc.misc.verbose`.  An explanation of this change should be added to the documentation.

Since `Tachyon.show` calls `Tachyon.save` should `Tachyon.save` check the verbosity level and pass it to `tachyon_rt` in `sage.interfaces.tachyon`? or should all references to the verbosity level be removed from `Tachyon.show` and `Tachyon.save` and just check the verbosity level in `tachyon_rt`?

Can you provide doctests illustrating the effects of setting `sage.misc.misc.set_verbose` ? 

(don't forget to set `sage.misc.misc.set_verbose` back to its original value in such a doctest)

Okay. How do you normally go about creating doctests? I haven’t done that before. From reading http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/doctesting.html#beyond-the-sage-library , i gather that, like in the examples section of a function definition eg: 



```
        r"""
        Creates a PNG file of the scene.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: q = Tachyon()
            sage: q.light((-1,-1,10), 1,(1,1,1))
            sage: q.texture('s')
            sage: q.sphere((0,0,0),1,'s')
            sage: q.show(verbose=2)
        """
```


I put these further examples in this section, then run $ ./sage -t src/sage/plot/plot3d/tachyon.py ?
Or Are you referring to another method? :)

Right :)

Also, build the documentation and check that it looks good in the reference manual.
