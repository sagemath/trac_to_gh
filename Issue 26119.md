# Issue 26119: Minimal approximant bases

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26356

Original creator: vneiger

Original creation time: 2018-09-27 14:56:07

CC:  @romainlebreton

Keywords: polynomial matrix; approximant basis; Hermite-Pad√© approximation

New functionalities:
* **computation** of shifted minimal approximant bases (iterative algorithm),
* **verification** that a matrix is a shifted minimal approximant basis.

This should be done in a general context:
* accepting non-uniform orders and non-uniform shifts,
* allowing to work row-wise or column-wise,
* offering the possibility of obtaining the canonical basis (that is, the one in shifted Popov form).

The features mentioned in the ticket have been implemented, with complete documentation and tests. After a few more tests, for safety, this will be ready for review.

Hello vneiger,

your code was great. I have only noticed a few problems that I solved. Could you please double check my changes ?
If everything is fine by you and if the continuous integration passes, then you can mark it as a positive review.
Best,
Romain

Quick question : why the function names is_minimal_approximant_basis and approximant_basis differ ? Should we rename the 2nd function minimal_approximant_basis ?

Hi,

Thank you very much for your reviewing and improvements of the code. All this looks good to me now.

I would only suggest to indeed change the name to "minimal_approximant_basis", and to replace "order should be positive integers" with "order should consist of positive integers". May I let you do this? For some reason, with the branch change you made, I have difficulties pushing my changes (I get in detached HEAD for a reason I'm not sure to understand...).

Thank you.
