For anyone looking for a beginner ticket, this should be fairly easy.

Changing keywords from "" to "beginner".

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

OK, we can indeed check for presence of a loop, and set the chromatic number to 0.

This change updates `G.chromatic_polynomial()` to give 0 (in `ZZ['x']`). `chromatic_number()` already raises a `ValueError` when G has `loops=True`, so it isn't strictly necessary to change that.
