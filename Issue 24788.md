# Issue 24788: Fix jmol package in Cygwin

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25025

This does two things:
1) Original motivation is to ensure a Windows native path is used when passing the path to `Jmol.jar` to the java interpreter.

2) Cleans things up a bit by providing our own, slightly simpler `jmol` script as opposed to the script that comes with the jmol binary package, rather than patching that script.

I feel this is fairly critical actually--although in most cases threejs should probably be preferred at this point over jmol, I still get lots of users on ask.sagemath.org having problems with this.
