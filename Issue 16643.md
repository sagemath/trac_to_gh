CC:  @nathanncohen @jdemeyer

The cythonization of `prime_powers` is much faster (around x4 in the timings). We also introduce the keyword `py_ints` as in `prime_range` in order to be able to use Python int instead of Sage integers.

Note: I do not like the convention that the name are different `prime_powers` vs `prime_range`... why not using `primes` or `prime_power_range`?

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16880

I used `mpz_tstbit` instead. Should be the fastest.

Potential micro optimization that would need to use `mpn_*` functions
- the call to `mpz_sizeinbase` can be replaced by `mpn_count_leading_zeros` and some arithmetic
- we can avoid a useless bit shift in `mpz_tstbit` by only considering the `&` with the most significant limb. Moreover, the allocation of the limbs will not change inside the loop. So we can already use the good pointer to the concerned limb.

I think this is too much for a naive algorithm...

`skept` -> `skipped`

This should be moved *after* the comparison with 2 (and `self` should be compared with 2):

```
cdef Integer n = PY_NEW(Integer)
```


Another simplification that I missed: you can skip the block

```
    if mpz_even_p(n.value):
    if n.is_prime_power(proof=proof):
    return n
    mpz_add_ui(n.value, n.value, 1)
```

if you instead just add 2 if `self` was odd:

```
mpz_add_ui(n.value, self.value, 1 if mpz_even_p(self.value) else 2)
```


Then the `bit_index` should be based on the value of `self`, such that the check works correctly if `self` was `2^n - 1`.
