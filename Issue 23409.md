Sadly, this change was necessary to make the doctest pass. Otherwise, we are comparing a filtered vector-space (V) and a bare vector-space V.get_degree(0). And they are no longer considered to be equal. 

Maybe one can consider that the doctest did pass, but should not have. Otherwise, one needs to restore the old behaviour somehow.

In fact, the doctest

```
V.get_degree(0) == V
```

still passes (is True) but the opposite comparison

```
V == V.get_degree(0)
```

is False. I do not know if this was the existing behaviour, but probably. This is because the `__eq__` for free module accepts everything that acts as a free module, whereas the `__eq__` for filtered modules only accepts filtered modules.

I think (but this should be checked) that we are not changing the current behaviour.
