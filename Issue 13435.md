```

But modulo 1, the inverse does exist.  Note that gcd(0,1) == 1.

Looks good to me, nice cleanup too. How did you run into this?

Quite naturally in fact.  I needed some random numbers to create an exercise for students to solve which involved (amonst other things) inverting `Mod(r,s)`.  I wrote a loop to randomly generate some numbers, checking that `gcd(r,s) == 1`.
