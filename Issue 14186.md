# Issue 14186: Let FFLAS-FFPACK use Sage's LAPACK

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14390

Original creator: jpflori

Original creation time: 2013-03-30 18:08:02

Assignee: jdemeyer

The current spkg fails to detect (Sage's) LAPACK.
It uses the same linker option to detect it as to detect BLAS and it obviously fails.

fflas_fflapack install script also needs serious revamping for Solaris, Cygwin and surely other os where it looks for system-wide libraries or libraries we don't build anymore.

For solaris we surely need to pass -lrt.

The dependency of fflas-ffpack to LAPACK is optional and really not relevant to sage. It is only used for benchmarks, in order to compare its timings with LAPACK's.

It is safe to assume that Sage should build fflas-ffpack without LAPACK dependency and I suggest to close this ticket.
