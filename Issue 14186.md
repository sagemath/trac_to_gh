The current spkg fails to detect (Sage's) LAPACK.
It uses the same linker option to detect it as to detect BLAS and it obviously fails.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14390

fflas_fflapack install script also needs serious revamping for Solaris, Cygwin and surely other os where it looks for system-wide libraries or libraries we don't build anymore.

The dependency of fflas-ffpack to LAPACK is optional and really not relevant to sage. It is only used for benchmarks, in order to compare its timings with LAPACK's.

It is safe to assume that Sage should build fflas-ffpack without LAPACK dependency and I suggest to close this ticket.
