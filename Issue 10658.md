This works on my mac, but the spkg (at least when I downloaded it) had uncommitted changes.

I first wanted to test it.  Now it seems to work and I've committed the changes.  Needs review.

Patch fixes the problem of the tex pool being exhausted.

We might want to think about organizing the reference manual pdf into smaller files instead of one 6000+ page document. I hope nobody prints it.

I have updated the merger script such that it will detect when any of the documentation fails to build.  So in the future a problem like this will not go unnoticed.
