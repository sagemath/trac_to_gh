Thanks, Frédéric.  Can I ask whether the changes other than the new doctest and the addition of `RunTimeError` are nontrivial?  I don't think so, but there were a lot of prettification changes.

Do you want the "known bug" doctest ? This does not seem to be really necessary to me. We are not responsible for maxima bugs.

It would be nice, because we typically do this in other cases.  But I guess since in this case it is an actual exception raised, as opposed to a wrong result we had to work around, it is not necessary.

But if Volker complains about failing doctests, I am trusting your morally green patchbot :-) Just upgraded OS (still several versions behind) and so won't be building new Sage for a little while until I have time to check that command line tools are working properly.
