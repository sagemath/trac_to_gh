This ticket adds some targets to `src/Makefile.in`: `sdist` and `sdistcheck`.
The latter, after building an `sdist` (using `distutils`), unpacks it into a subdirectory, and builds and installs (into SAGE_LOCAL) from there. 

`(cd src && make sdist)` gives the following warnings. They need fixing.

```
warning: sdist: standard file not found: should have one of README, README.txt
```
(this one is #21565)

```
reading manifest template 'MANIFEST.in'
warning: sdist: MANIFEST.in, line 6: 'recursive-include' expects <dir> <pattern1> <pattern2> ...

warning: no previously-included files matching '*.h' found under directory 'sage/ext/interpreters'
warning: no previously-included files found matching 'sage/libs/pari/gen.h'
warning: no previously-included files found matching 'sage/modular/arithgroup/farey_symbol.h'
warning: no previously-included files found matching 'sage/rings/real_mpfi.h'

warning: no files found matching 'doc/en/bordeaux_2008/modpcurve.png'
no previously-included directories found matching 'doc/output'
```


There is something more seriously wrong with the sdist. The sage that is built from there (using `(cd src && make sdistcheck)`)  crashes as follows.

```

     22                      double* result) except 0

ImportError: No module named wrapper_rdf
```

This needs fixing.

The branch is on top of #21480.

Obviously you are missing an include that would point where to find `sage/ext/fast_callable.*`. I will have a deeper look.
