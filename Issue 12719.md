Keywords: documentation untested

On [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/aa60c0616ecdd1b6), Johan Gr√∂nqvist suggested to add a message when a function is called that has no doctest. The problem is that that would massively affect the performance.

I suggested a modification of that idea: When the user reads the documentation of an untested function (or method) either in the notebook or the command line interface, s/he should be invited to contribute a test, such as

```
sage: def my_function(a,b):
....:     """
....:     some docs, but no test
....:     """
....:     return a+b
....: 
sage: my_function?
Type:		function
Base Class:	<type 'function'>
String Form:	<function my_function at 0x7309938>
Namespace:	Interactive
Loaded File:	/mnt/local/king/SAGE/stable/sage-5.0.beta13/devel/sage-main/<ipython console>
Source File:	/mnt/local/king/SAGE/stable/sage-5.0.beta13/devel/sage-main/<ipython console>
Definition:	my_function(a, b)
Docstring:
       ####
       # my_function appears to be untested.
       # The Sage community would appreciate if someone (e.g., you)
       # added a test to the documentation.
       ####
       some docs, but no test
```


Reading the documentation is certainly not critical for performance. I thought it could be implemented in sage/misc/sagedoc.py or sage/misc/sageinspect.py. Unfortunately, this only holds for the ipython interface of Sage. The notebook seems to use stuff in sagenb/misc/support.py and sagenb/misc/sageinspect.py (which is an ** *outdated* copy** of sage/misc/sageinspect.py!).

I'm guessing this will be a sort of meta-ticket, where you open another ticket for an undocumented function, and provide a link here. Hopefully then writing the doctest on the other ticket. Is that what you had in mind?

Not at all. As the ticket description says: The aim is to change the behaviour of `obj?` in Notebook and ipython interface (I am afraid both needs to be done) so that people trying to read the documentation of obj are encouraged to contribute a doctest (of course only if such doctest is missing).

In other words, this is not a (meta-)ticket about doctests but a ticket about a potential approach to get people to start contributing to sage by writing doctests (this is why I chose the component "user interface", not "doctest").

Since sagenb is part of Sage, we would always have access to this file, but it still allows sagenb to be a standalone project.

From my perspective, it does not make sense that *any* version of sageinspect is in sagenb, if the sage notebook wants to pretend to be standalone.

sageinspect is supposed to know how to find sources *in the `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/` repository*, but I don't think that the notebook should try to find files in `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/` if it is used in a project that has nothing to do with Sage.

Off topic:
A better solution for the notebook as a standalone project would be to create a hook for the relevant functionality: The relevant functions are supposed to return the doc of a given object or to find the source of a given object or to determine the arguments of a function.

In other words, there should be a module sagenb.inspect containing placeholder functions such as get_doc and get_sourcelines (perhaps defaulting to Python's inspect.getdoc and inspect.getsourcelines), and the notebook should entirely rely on these functions. Now, if one wants to use the standalone notebook for Sage, then one has to do

```
sagenb.inspect.getdoc = sage.misc.sageinspect.sage_getdoc
sagenb.inspect.getsourcelines = sage.misc.sageinspect.sage_getsourcelines
sagenb.inspect.getargspec = sage.misc.sageinspect.sage_getargspec
...
```

and if one wants to use the notebook in, say, mathematica, then one has to use other definitions (assigning sagenb.inspect.getsourcelines to a function that raises a `NotImplementedError` or so...),

The advantage for the topic of this ticket would be that we only needed to change one location, not two. The advantage for me would be: I am not a notebook user, and I don't really want to learn github for something that I don't use.
