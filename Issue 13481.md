More doctests for the rest of `sage.rings` as a followup to #13618. This adds documentation for minor functions in the following files:
* M sage/rings/commutative_algebra.py
* sage/rings/commutative_ring.py
* sage/rings/commutative_ring_element.py
* sage/rings/dedekind_domain.py
* sage/rings/dedekind_domain_element.py
* sage/rings/euclidean_domain.py
* sage/rings/euclidean_domain_element.py
* sage/rings/field.py
* sage/rings/field_element.py
* sage/rings/fraction_field.py
* sage/rings/fraction_field_element.pyx
* sage/rings/function_field/constructor.py
* sage/rings/ideal_monoid.py
* sage/rings/infinity.py
* sage/rings/integer_ring.pyx
* sage/rings/integer_ring_python.py
* sage/rings/integral_domain.py
* sage/rings/integral_domain_element.py
* sage/rings/monomials.py
* sage/rings/morphism.pyx
* sage/rings/multi_power_series_ring_element.py
* sage/rings/noncommutative_ideals.pyx
* sage/rings/principal_ideal_domain.py
* sage/rings/principal_ideal_domain_element.py
* sage/rings/quotient_ring.py
* sage/rings/real_double.pyx
* sage/rings/residue_field.pyx
* sage/rings/ring.pyx

Most of these files were a few functions short of 100% doctest coverage. This patch also goes through and cleans up some of the documentation in these files as well.

Needs to be rebased for sage-5.8.beta1, I get

```
Hunk #77 succeeded at 2051 with fuzz 2 (offset -1 lines).
```

(we don't like fuzz > 1)

I'll build `5.8.beta1` over tonight and post the updated patch tomorrow.

And I'll also rebase over #14040.

In fact, better to wait for sage-5.8.beta2 as there are more patches to rings with positive review.
