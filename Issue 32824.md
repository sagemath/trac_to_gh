There is a slight inconsistency:

```
sage: s = findstat("integer partitions", distribution=lambda x: x[0], depth=0); list(s.first_terms().items())[:10]
[([1], 1),
 ([2], 2),
 ([1, 1], 1),
 ([3], 3),
 ([2, 1], 2),
 ([1, 1, 1], 1),
 ([4], 4),
 ([3, 1], 3),
 ([2, 2], 2),
 ([2, 1, 1], 2)]

sage: s
0: St000010 (quality [100, 100])
1: St000147 (quality [100, 100])
2: St000378 (quality [34, 94])

sage: s = findstat(distribution=10, depth=0); list(s.first_terms().items())[:10]
[([1], 1)]
```


I think that only the second result is correct: philosophically, `findstat("integer partitions", distribution=lambda x: x[0])` represents a statistic of which only the distribution is known.
However, it might be more practical not to follow this idea.

I'm afraid I don't quite understand the issue. Although I don't think too many people would get upset over whichever choice you make. As long as it is documented, it should be okay.
