Keywords: python3

If `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`, then when IPython is build, it adds a script `ipython3` to `local/bin`. This script carefully writes the path to Sage's python3 to its first line: `#!/path/to/.../python3`. Then the function `make_scripts_relative` in `sage-location` replaces this with `#!/usr/bin/env python`, which breaks it.

Hm, it really seems wrong to me that a routine that is supposed to make scripts relative also changes the kind of interpreter that's used. A reasonable default seems to me to stick with whatever was specified (including maintaining the options that are selected!!!)

If we need further tweaking of the "#!" line, I would think this needs to be tuned to the script in question, and thus not just be done for all files with a first line matching "#!.*/python".
