For compactness, the usual ascii_art plot does not display the leaves, which nevertheless are nodes.

Replying to [comment:1 chapoton]:

Indeed, that explains the output I got. It is still a bit confusing that `node_number_at_depth` counts nodes including leaves, while `node_number` does not include the leaves.


```
sage: [t.node_number() for t in BinaryTrees(3)]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
```


In my opinion, there is an inconsistency that should be fixed.

The documentation is not that clear about this. If anything, I am inclined to interpret it as saying that leaves are not considered nodes in binary trees:


```
    Binary trees contain nodes and leaves, where each node has two
    children while each leaf has no children. The number of leaves
    of a binary tree always equals the number of nodes plus `1`.
```

I think it is slightly misleading to say `ascii_art` does not display the leaves. I would consider there to be two distinct sets of objects:

1 - binary trees with `n` nodes and
2 - full binary trees with `n` internal nodes.

There is a definite inconsistency here between `node_number` and `node_number_at_depth`. The problem is this corner case:

```
sage: T = BinaryTrees(3)[3]
sage: Tp = T[1]
sage: Tp
.
sage: Tp.is_empty()
True
sage: Tp.node_number_at_depth(0)
1
```

In particular, it says an empty tree has 1 node, which is wrong. This branch fixes this.

Thanks for fixing this so quickly. It works exactly as I expect.

Frédéric, if you agree, I think this can be set to positive.
