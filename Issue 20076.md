Here is a small update of the patchbot.

Only very minor changes on the client side, so it should work just as now.

This looks good. I am in the process of rebuilding Sage on another machine to test the new owner option :-) Will report later today.

Hmm, the owner option will have no visible effect. This information will be stored in the internal reports, in the patchbot server database, but not displayed in the web pages.

So only people with access to the server will be able to see who own the bots.

I am currently testing it on qemu/kvm VM. Crossing fingers.

Changes in the code look good, and the patchbot now runs correctly within a VM, good to go !
