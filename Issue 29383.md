perhaps fixing this in ./configure is the most natural thing to do.

The only reason that comes to mind is that at least one package uses an mpir-specific interface: #30325.

For Sage 9.3, I would be reluctant to remove MPIR completely. But it would be good to remove this trap in our configure script.

Reworded ticket description (removing some bits
reproduced below) after

- ATLAS removed in #30350.
- MPIR removed in #32549 and #32727.
- work on boost and boost-cropped:
  - #31871: replace boost by boost_cropped in m4 files
  - #31575: Remove full boost package
  - #31250: Upgrade: boost_cropped 1.78.0

---

For gmp/mpir, we have:

```
  --with-system-gmp={no|yes (default)|force (exit with an error if no usable version is found)}
                          detect and use an existing system gmp
  --with-system-mpir={no|yes (default)|force (exit with an error if no usable version is found)}
                          detect and use an existing system mpir
  --with-mp=system        use the system GMP as multiprecision library, if
                          possible (default)
  --with-mp=mpir          use the Sage SPKG for MPIR as multiprecision library
  --with-mp=gmp           use the Sage SPKG for GMP as multiprecision library
```
The first two are automatically generated and do not work properly. The `--with-mp` option is legacy and works properly but does not fit well with the systematic naming scheme. Removing `mpir` in #32549 removes this case.

Same for BLAS (as reported most recently in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-support/c/pqnhfUJYS-Q/m/lOQJ3EtYBwAJ):

```
  --with-system-atlas={no|yes (default)|force (exit with an error if no usable version is found)}
                          detect and use an existing system atlas
  --with-system-openblas={no|yes (default)|force (exit with an error if no usable version is found)}
                          detect and use an existing system openblas
  --with-blas=openblas    use OpenBLAS as BLAS library (default)
    --with-blas=atlas       use ATLAS as BLAS library
``` 
Removing `atlas` in #30350 removes this case.

And to a lesser degree for these ones:

```
  --with-system-boost={no|yes (default)|force (exit with an error if no usable version is found)}
                          detect and use an existing system boost
  --with-system-boost_cropped={no|yes (default)|force (exit with an error if no usable version is found)}
                          detect and use an existing system boost_cropped
```
