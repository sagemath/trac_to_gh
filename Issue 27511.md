I opened this ticket but we must wait for 8.8.beta4.

Note that I find `is_package_installed` much more natural than a `try:... except...` here, but if this method is not good, let's use something else.

there is an error: it is `vertex_list` and not `vertexlist` in `v_to_int = {v: i for i, v in enumerate(vertexlist)}`.

We could also change `vertex_list = self.vertices()` to `vertex_list = list(self)`, but it is documented like that. So may be in a future ticket.

I use the `Feature` now which gives a nice error message.
