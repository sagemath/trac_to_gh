We should have tests to avoid Py3 regressions as people work on other tickets. One low-hanging fruit to be implemented on this ticket is to compile with python3 and check for syntax errors

What is the use of the line

```

```

?

Is it intentional that this is missing a closing quote too?

```
print "invalid print statement
```

I made 2 small changes. Now looks good enough to me. It would be very good to have this in place, to prevent possible regressions.
