The file http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/pyopenssl-0.13.p0.spkg has been removed, but not the links in http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/list nor http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/

So currently, `sage -i pyopenssl` leads to a message that is not clear to the user: 


```
>>> Checking online list of optional packages.
[.]
>>> Found pyopenssl-0.13.p0
>>> Trying to download http://www.sagemath.org/spkg/optional/pyopenssl-0.13.p0.spkg
...
IOError: [Errno 404] Not Found: '//www.sagemath.org/spkg/optional/pyopenssl-0.13.p0.spkg'
Error: failed to download package pyopenssl-0.13.p0
```

Uhm, I have actually no idea. After any change of the files on the mirror one has to run the mirror indexing scripts. But one of them is commented out and the other one isn't even called â€¦ that's where I'm getting really confused about this.

I'm also working on moving this to the new infrastructure. This can't be maintained any more and untangling all this will help.

apart from that: this is fixed now
