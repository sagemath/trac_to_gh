This algorithm enumerates *induced* subgraphs. The connectivity here has the same meaning than for `G.is_connected()`.

If this is enumerating induced subgraphs, then this needs to be very documented as the induced part was not mentioned in the ticket description, much less in the doc.

We can get spanning trees (think matroid bases), and then add other edges to these (and keeping track of the subgraphs we've seen). However, this is probably a bit too brute force.

I have documented the fact that the subgraphs are induced. I could also ad it to the name of the method if you think it is better.

For spanning subgraphs, I'm only able to find algorithms for spanning trees (and we have a ticket for that #23115). I'm not sure the problem has been considered yet. We could certainly find a smart algorithm...
