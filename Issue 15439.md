# Issue 15439: Adding Tseitin's equisatisfiable CNF encodings to symbolic logic module

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15676

Currently, using the symbolic logic module, propositional formulas can be easily entered. However, as listed in the documentation, the transformation to CNF is inefficient. Tseitin's equisatisfiable CNF encodings are efficient (linear increase in size). It may be useful to include them.
