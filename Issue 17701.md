Sorry, but I do not understand what you do with the reverse morphism. It seems like you just do nothing in this `if not(self.is_complete())` statement. Does the simple fact of calling `FanMorphism` magically modify `subdivision` ?

It better not modify anything in the global namespace!!!

```
sage: F1 = toric_varieties.P2().fan()
sage: F2 = Fan([F1.generating_cone(0)])
sage: F2.common_refinement(F1)
...
   1661         if not self.is_complete():
   1662             # Construct the opposite morphism to ensure support equality
-> 1663             FanMorphism(id, other, self, subdivide=True)
...
ValueError: morphism defined by
[1 0]
[0 1]
does not map
Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N
into the support of
Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N!
```

Without constructing the second morphism, it is not obvious that the support of F1 is not strictly bigger than the support of F2. Yet if the second one can be constructed, its domain fan will be exactly the same subdivision, so no need to use it somehow.

Checking equality of supports of non-complete fans is tricky, since the support does not have to be convex, so there is no simple object that can model it. (And that's why we don't have `fan.support()` method - the best model for the support of a general fan is the fan itself as a polyhedral complex.) Another more transparent option is to check if the first constructed morphism is surjective, but looking at the code I suspect it is more time-consuming.
