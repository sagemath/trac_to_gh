Thanks for pointing this out. Upstream, the tarball generation (for distribution) will now fix the permissions accordingly, see

Note, that `sage -pkg` needs to be fixed also.

The package builds, installs and passes the relevant tests. I' fine withthe differences and merges it to #11261 (soon to #11575, too).
