The following code in Sage 9.4 gives me **KeyError: ((None,), ())** followed by **AttributeError: 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression' object has no attribute 'ceil**':


```
from sage.modules.free_module_integer import IntegerLattice                                                                                                                                                                                                               
L = IntegerLattice([[-1,  0,  1],[1,0,2]])                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
L.closest_vector((1,1,1))
```


It was suggested at https://ask.sagemath.org/question/58842/ that the latter error comes from `sqrt(5).ceil()` not working.

I see the same error on many other `.closest_vector()` call - so essentially its functionality is broken at the moment.

Indeed, that is exactly what happens in the line referenced above. However, when figuring out what the largest norm is that occurs, one should probably not take square roots at all!

I don't think that's the right fix, \ell_2 norm is generally understood and LLL (which is called after) works in the \ell_2 norm. Shouldn't `RR(abs(v))` do the trick?

We're taking slightly longer vectors in this patch, but this can only be harmful for the performance, as far as I understand.

Besides, I'm sure there are good algorithms to find a ceil(abs(v)), without first computing a floating point approximation of abs(v), no?

if one has to go with \ell_2 norm then one needs to call a function for the squared \ell_2 norm n2 of v, 
and then take (r,rem)-n2.sqrtrem() (which basically wraps one call to GMP) of the result;

then ceil(abs(v)) is r if rem==0, and r+1 otherwise.
