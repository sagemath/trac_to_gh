FYI, I changed "return None" to raise an error to avoid (and make more debuggable) future issues of this sort. For places where None is explicitly acceptable (in the bowels of Pynac) it can be returned explicitly in the except clause.

Use the Python 3 compatible syntax to raise an error

```
raise ValueError("recursion")
```

Burcin, I trust this fix doesn't cancel your positive review?
