The functionality is working fine. There are a couple little things to fix

- the Input and Output docs strings do not format correctly

- adjust the doc string to reflect non-preperiodic points such your second doc example

- add a comment or two more in the code to help a reader follow along

- the while True/break perhaps should be done another way.
