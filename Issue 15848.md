Keywords: python3

In Py2 we have

```
Python 2.7.5+ (default, Feb 27 2014, 19:37:08) 
[GCC 4.8.1] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> b = True
>>> type(b)
<type 'bool'>
```

while in Py3

```
Python 3.3.2+ (default, Feb 28 2014, 00:52:16) 
[GCC 4.8.1] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> b = True
>>> type(b)
<class 'bool'>
```

The result may be unified with `isinstance()`.
Py2

```
>>> isinstance(b, bool)
True
```

and Py3

```
>>> isinstance(b, bool)
True
```

About 161 py module are effected.
