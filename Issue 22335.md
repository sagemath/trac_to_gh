Keywords: days84, geometry, tutorial

This ticket adds a thorough tutorial surrounding the polyhedron class.

The tutorial was elaborated during the [Sage Days 84](https://wiki.sagemath.org/days84) where all participants gave several significant inputs about the tutorial and its content.

What is the username of Vincent Klein?

I should try to push a version complete "draft version" very soon. Not much is left.

Meanwhile, a question: is it possible that a ref block in rst can not include math mode?

It is `vklein`.

Are you looking for a reviewer for this ticket?

Hmm, I didn't understand :/

Thanks Marcelo!

My question refers to the fact that I make references to the base classes using `:ref:` and in this block, the `math` does not appear, like QQ and ZZ. I do not know why...

As for reviewers, you are welcome to review the ticket! I am not completely done yet though... That's why I left it as new. I still want to put some more work in there, but I thought that it is good if people can have a look at it already!

Since the tickets #22574, #22575 are not quite ready yet and I'd like this ticket done soon, I put them in a forthcoming ticket to do later.(!)

Changing keywords from "days84, geometry, tutorial" to "days84, geometry, tutorial, days88".

you have to remove trailing whitespaces

I would not order a tutorial by method. This is what the reference manual is about. You should find a "fil rouge". I think the best way to proceed is to have concrete big problems and show how to solve it in Sage step by step.

Furthermore, I think that it is very good to have exercices in thematic tutorials!

EDIT: there are actually a lot of different files:
- `is_this_polyhedron.rst`
- `lectures.rst`
- `new_from_old.rst`
- `related_objects.rst`
- `tips.rst`
- `visualization.rst`
I think it is bad to put these rather generic names. Geometry is not just about polyhedra...

1. Change the title `Tutorials for the Geometry module of Sage` into `Polyhedra` in the file `geometry.rst`

2. At the very top of the main thematic tutorial page there is a nice distinction between _quickrefs_, _primer_ and _tutorial_. It would be good to tag the different files you wrote accordingly.

I rebased everything on 8.1.beta3 (folding all your commits in 1). The three documents `is_this_polyhedron.rst`, `new_from_old.rst` and `related_objects.rst` are now folded in a unique `polyhedra_quickref.rst`.

The organization of the quickref should be discussed...

I added some todos that I observed while making the tutorial.

You should not use a generic name for your file like `geometry/lectures.rst`. Your tutorial is specific on polytopes. Note that there is moreover a `polytutorial.rst`. Perhaps `polytope_quick_tutorial.rst` for the latter and `polytope_tutorial.rst` (that way all of them starts with `polytope` that helps)?

Some sided comment:
- `:math:`\mathbb{R}^d`` could be simplified to ``\mathbb{R}^d`` (the default sphinx directive for backstick is math)
- ``\mathbb{R}^d`` could be simplifed in ``\RR^d`` (sage comes with some predefined macro)

in lectures.rst at the beginning of the first lecture right after the second displayed equation, do you need to ask for the `\lambda_i` to be `\geq 0` ?

Yes! Thanks for spotting this!

I just pushed the suggested changes.

One remark: I prefer how the `\mathbf{R}` appears compared to `\RR`.

Great :-)

Then propose to change it globally in Sage? This is just a macro. It is better to have it consistent accross documentation rather than good looking on your tutorial.

Thanks for the tutorial!

I only have a few remarks/corrections

 * has the ambient space --> as the ambient space
 * should the explanation for "is_compact" perhaps mention the word "bounded"?
 * add a link for "composite_field" (and change the word to "composite_fields")
 * the reason why we cant do computations in the symbolic ring is given as because it is "not exact". Perhaps we could simply state that it is not implemented. (Computations in RDF are also "not exact")
 * access to vertices ... --> access vertices ...
 * remove the part "clearly (!)" (or is this a joke I don't get?)
 * in the sage_input example, I suggest to change whats there to 


```
sage: Cube = polytopes.cube()
sage: TCube = Cube.truncation().dilation(1/2)
sage: sage_input(TCube)
```

That is add "dilation" to avoid "QQ(1)" many times, which doesn't look pretty.

Salut Moritz,

Thanks a lot for the review. I made the corrections you suggested.

Hopefully, the bot likes it.
