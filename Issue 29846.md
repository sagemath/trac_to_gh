# Issue 29846: Inconsistency with super graded vector spaces

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30083

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2020-07-07 02:54:07

Keywords: graded super vector spaces


```
sage: C = Modules(QQ)
sage: C.Super().Graded()
Join of Category of super modules over Rational Field and Category of graded vector spaces over Rational Field
sage: C.Graded().Super()
Category of super modules over Rational Field
```

Compare this with

```
sage: C = Modules(ZZ)
sage: C.Super().Graded()
Category of super modules over Integer Ring
sage: C.Graded().Super()
Category of super modules over Integer Ring
sage: _ is __
True
```

and for

```
sage: C = Algebras(QQ)
```

This is likely related to the fact that `SuperModules` uses `super_categories` instead of `extra_super_categories` to note that `super => graded`.

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.
