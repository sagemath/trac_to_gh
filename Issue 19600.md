# Issue 19600: let RealBallField coerce to symbolic ring

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dkrenn

```
RBF = RealBallField()
RBF(0.42) + SR(1)
```

does not work, since there is no coercion defined from `RBF` to `SR`.

However, conversion works.

Minor merge conflict with `develop`.

Also, I thought it no longer was fashionable to add `is_Foo` methods that just call `isinstance`. But perhaps that only applies to Elements?

Solved.

Changed. (I didn't know. Is this written somewhere?)

I don't know, sorry. It just seemed to me that people tended to remove these methods.

Anyways, +1 for removing (as done).
