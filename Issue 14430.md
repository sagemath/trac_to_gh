# Issue 14430: Cython sometimes embeds wrong file names in docstrings

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14634

Original creator: vbraun

Original creation time: 2013-05-23 15:09:08

Assignee: jdemeyer

Cython's `Nodes.relative_position` makes file names relative by stripping off the first `len(os.path.abspath(os.getcwd()))` characters. This is totally wrong if the file is from the include search path and not relative to `cwd`
