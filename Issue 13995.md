I noticed that suddenly the following changes appeared in my working repository:

```diff
diff --git a/doc/en/reference/misc/sagetex.rst b/doc/en/reference/misc/sagetex.rst
--- a/doc/en/reference/misc/sagetex.rst

-Installing and using SageTeX
-============================
+.. nodoctest

-SageTeX is a system for embedding computations and plots from Sage into
-LaTeX documents. It is included by default with Sage, so if you have
-installed Sage, you already have SageTeX. However, to get it to work,
-you need to make TeX aware of SageTeX. Instructions for that are in the
-"Make SageTeX known to TeX" section of the `Sage installation guide
-<http://sagemath.org/doc/installation/index.html>`_ (`this link
-<../../installation/index.html>`_ should take you to a local copy of the
-installation guide).

```

If this an autogenerated file, it should not be tracked by Mercurial. And also, what happened to this file, why did all content get removed?

I think I may have seen something like this a long time ago, in the early stages of testing #6495, but then I thought it had to do with maybe not deleting the old doc output or something like that. Was this a build from scratch or an upgrade?

I think that the only OS X 10.6 system that I have access to is bsd.math.washington.edu, and I can't reproduce this there, at least after building the docs a few times with a freshly built Sage 5.8.beta2.

Replying to [comment:5 jhpalmieri]:
> Was this a build from scratch or an upgrade?
I don't remember, it was on a buildbot machine (`bsd.math`), but I guess it was a build from scratch. On `bsd.math` look for `/Users/buildbot/sage-5.8.beta2-14199.tar.bz2` which is a build with this problem.

Okay, I think I've figured it out: the problem is that "sagetex.rst" starts with "sage". See the attached patch.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Maybe you should document better what's the purpose of the condition

```
if name.startswith('sage' + os.sep):
```
