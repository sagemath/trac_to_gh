# Issue 20846: Upgrade BRiAl and build it without '-std=c++98' when upstream issue #11 is fixed

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21083

Original creator: leif

Original creation time: 2016-07-24 16:27:00

CC:  fbissey

Keywords: unordered_map hash_map segfault C++11

We currently work around BRiAl not building in C++11 mode by passing `-std=c++98`, which is odd.

See [https://github.com/BRiAl/BRiAl/issues/11](https://github.com/BRiAl/BRiAl/issues/11).

It looks like upstream closed issue 11, and in fact version 1.0.1 is out.

Yes upstream is me for all that's worth [in a maintenance capacity only) and I meant to do this. Anyway those issues were technically addressed in 0.8.7, `brial` should compile with C++11. The only issue is that you need at least C++98. If we decide to default it to C++11 we must make sure that the sage extension is also compiled with C++11.

Thanks to the changes to upstream, this is pretty straight-forward now.

Looks good to me.

Fails without boost:

```
[brial-1.0.1] checking whether the Boost::Unit_Test_Framework library is available... yes
[brial-1.0.1] configure: error: Could not find a version of the library!
[brial-1.0.1] Error configuring BRiAl
```

Right, my fault upstream when I resurrected the testsuite. I'll need to just mark the testsuite disabled if not found rather than it being mandatory.

Actually we should be able to fix this by just adding `--with-boost-unit-test-framework=no`, it default to `yes` and assumes that it means mandatory.

So you mean add `--with-boost-unit-test-framework=no` as `./configure` flag and then run the testsuite as usual?

Yes

> and then run the testsuite as usual?

No - or yes if you consider there is currently no `spkg-check` for brial.  You need the boost-unit-test-framework library to link the testsuite (libboost_unit_test_framework.so). And boost_cropped is just headers, no libraries so we cannot run the testsuite without the full boost package.

I think I understand. The BRiAl build in Sage fails because it doesn't find the boost unit testing framework. However, since Sage doesn't run the testsuite, it doesn't actually need boost at all.

It still needs boost headers (boost_cropped), they are used in brial in several places. But the test suite relies on something that is only built with the full boost.
