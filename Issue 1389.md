about number 5: when i compiled the collection of quotes, i wanted them to be real quotes. I thought about replacing the wrong Sage capitalizations but i rejected it. Do you think it should be replaced?

The same holds for the publications. They are written in that way, the past cannot be changed ;)

Well, you're absolutely right on this point, hence my comment "Here are some _possible_ trivial fixes:", emphasis added. But I wanted to collect those "suggestions" here for future reference.

Most patches here should be trivial to review, though some _may_ require rebasing. 

This ticket perhaps should have an ongoing existence - as patches are merged, new ones could still be added.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2008-10-20 23:06:14

Here's a patch to deal with the first item 1 in the description: fix the conflict in citation instructions between the tutorial and sagemath.org.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2008-10-20 23:22:30

Of the patches here:

```
copying.patch,
readme.patch,
readmeOSX.patch,
```

all look okay: the changes are pretty trivial.
`mercurial-howto.patch` I think is no longer needed, since I think that file has been deleted.  Right?

`10737.patch` actually changes some code, so is slightly less trivial.  It looks good, too.

I'll give a positive review to all of these. Two things:

1. After applying 10737.patch, the output from

```
sage: banner()
```

is 

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

which is not the same as what I see when I start up Sage:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Loading SAGE library. Current Mercurial branch is: clone
```

Note the two instances of "SAGE" here. Where is this string coded?

Okay, found them.  One instance is in a script 'sage-banner', and another is in misc.py.  Patches attached.

I'm beginning to agree with kcrisman that we maybe should merge some of these when we can, then get to the others later...

Not exactly. It's shipped with sage-3.1.3 source distribution in the directory

```
<sage-parent-dir>/sage-3.1.3/devel/sage-main/mercurial-howto.txt
```

But perhaps it'll be removed in sage-3.2?

The patch `1389-misc.patch` looks good to me.

It is gone in Sage 3.1.4.

This ticket is really messy by now. Can someone in detail list the patches that need to be applied in which order to which repo?

Cheers,

Michael

There is a new version of the tut patch, taking the comments into consideration.  Note:

Replying to [comment:14 mvngu]:
> 4.

> -Year = 2008}

> +Year = {2008}

I made a change like this, but changing `2008`} to `{2008`}}.  The second brace } matches the one a few lines earlier, in the line ``@`manual{sage`.  (The change wasn't really necessary, but it doesn't hurt, either.)

The patches *copying.patch, readme.patch, readmeOSX.patch*
all affect files at the top-level of SAGE_ROOT.  I don't know if there is a corresponding repository for those, so they might need to be applied by hand.

Produced using `hg_sage`: *10737.patch, 1389-misc.patch*.

Produced using `hg_doc`: *1389-tut.patch*.

Produced using `hg_scripts`: *1389-scripts.patch*.  This one hasn't been reviewed yet; the others all seem to have positive reviews.

As far as I can tell, these can be applied in any order.

Share and Enjoy.
  John

I think we can leave publication item 4 alone. The only occurrence of "SAGE" for that item is from a quoted text within a paper: "On page 10 they write "These performance numbers were obtained using the SAGE library."

Hi, I'm well aware of all those old uppercase occurrencies on the website. I just have to finish another project, then I'll redo the packages, download and all other sites like that. Those are old scripts that I'll replace. Don't worry. 

Though, the donation page for the foundation is still unclear, since it could be registered by the uppercase version and therefore it simply has this name, but shouldn't be a problem.

The patch `1389-scripts.patch` looks good to me. However, when I applied `1389-scripts.patch` against sage-3.1.4 using the command `hg_scripts.patch("<path-to>/1389-scripts.patch")`, the following section from the patch was rejected:

```
diff -r 76339a4ccc14 -r f9dd774a1f61 sage-banner
--- a/sage-banner	Thu Oct 16 03:43:22 2008 -0700

 | Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
```


It seems that the script

```
sage-3.1.4/local/bin/sage-banner
```

that's shipped with sage-3.1.4 contains the line

```
SAGE Version 3.1.4, Release Date: 2008-10-20
```

and NOT

```
SAGE Version 3.1.4, Release Date: 2008-10-16
```

Notice the different release dates, which I think accounts for the said rejection. By the way, I fetched the sage-3.1.4 source distribution from

```
http://freethemes.mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/sage/src/sage-3.1.4.tar
```

So if we're going to fix the citation of Sage in the script `sage-3.1.4/local/bin/sage-banner`, then assuming you're working with sage-3.1.4, here's a suggestion:

```
-| SAGE Version 3.1.4, Release Date: 2008-10-20                       |
+| Sage Version 3.1.4, Release Date: 2008-10-20                       |
```

Positive review for 1389-misc.py.patch.

Please do not add patches over and over again to this already very messy ticket. The SAGE -> Sage transformation has *zero* to do with the original ticket, so please add new tickets for additional patches.

Cheers,

Michael

1389-misc.py.patch and 1389-misc.patch also attempt to do the same thing. This is getting really messy.
