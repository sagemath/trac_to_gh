There is no `==` operator in Maxima, but on invalid input it does bad things to the C-level stream. On Linux (below) this is caught by gilbc, on OSX the Maxima process hangs indefinitely:

```

Maxima encountered a Lisp error:

 Read or write operation signaled an error
C library explanation: Illegal seek.

Automatically continuing.
To enable the Lisp debugger set *debugger-hook* to nil.
```


This syntax error was diagnosed correctly in Maxima-5.34.1:

There's a proposed almost trivial patch there now. If we need this bug solved in Sage, we can patch our ECL.

There is a good chance that Maxima/SBCL on OSX has the same problem as Maxima/ECL, since the underlying problem is a rather unfortunate interpretation of POSIX mandated behaviour of lseek on terminal streams. It might be worth trying that, because if the problem surfaces there too, then the Maxima developers might want to avoid depending on the behaviour of the "file-position" lisp function that ends up wrapping lseek. (Similarly for other lisps for which Maxima is supported).
