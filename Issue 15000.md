# Issue 15000: Crystals using tableaux do not create if dot2tex installed but graphviz is not

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15237

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2013-09-27 23:11:59

Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  sage-combinat aschilling

Keywords: dot2tex graphviz crystals

It prints a very angry error message about not finding the graphviz binaries. The problem comes from dot2tex is installed, so `CrystalOfLetters` creates a `DiGraph` with the dot2tex option, but it fails to create it because it needs graphviz (for one reason or another). This fixes it by having the `DiGraph` not created until a less/greater than comparison is made.
