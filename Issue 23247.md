I ran a doctest and I got this error : 

```
File "src/sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod.pyx", line 4172, in sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_to_IntegerMod.is_surjective
Failed example:
    Zmod(4).hom(Zmod(2)).is_surjective()
Exception raised:

        raise NotImplementedError(type(self))
    NotImplementedError: <type 'sage.rings.morphism.RingHomomorphism_coercion'>
```

I haven't figured it out yet, but I'm checking it.

There was a dependency missing. Sorry for that. Now it should work.

Ok, in that case, everything seems right.

If you are happy with the changes you can set it to positive_review.

I prefer to wait until #23204 is review, just to prevent any possible bugs.

The tests that the patchbot reports as failing are failing on other tickets as well, so not related to this ticket.
