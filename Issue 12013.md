The same problem occurs for the norm function of relative orders.

Johan, the examples here work in 4.8.alpha5 without applying any patches! Apparently the issue has been fixed by some other patch merged in alpha5 (most likely #11904).

I confirm that the examples work in 4.8.alpha4 + #11904.

Cool, my patch #11904 fixed a bug by accident.
