CC:  @mjungmath @fchapoton

In order to uniformize, simplify and in view of #24456 (see also #17713) we merge the two files `complex_field.py`, `complex_number.pyx` into a unique `complex_mpfr.pyx`.

As pynac used explicitely these modules, we had to provide a tiny patch.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24483

The whole point is precisely to start a deprecation... though for ease of review I can move the deprecation in another ticket. Would that be better?

I can try. I just noticed minor things.

This one could use another line break:


```diff
        return Factorization([(R(gg).monic(), e) for gg, e in zip(*F)],
                             f.leading_coefficient())
+
cdef class ComplexNumber(sage.structure.element.FieldElement):
    """
    A floating point approximation to a complex number using any
```


Due to the new global import of `Integer`, you can also remove the following now unnecessary imports:


```diff
            sage: ComplexField().characteristic()
            0
        """
-        from .integer import Integer
        return Integer(0)
...
            0.309016994374947 + 0.951056516295154*I
        """
-        from .integer import Integer
        n = Integer(n)
        if n == 1:

Maybe there are more of those imports, but that's what I swiftly located.

As far as I can see it, some global variables are collected in the beginning of the file while others are placed right before the corresponding class/method. I think, some sort of unification with good commenting can be beneficial for readability. But maybe that's too pedantic right now and should be part of another ticket if necessary.

Thank you. I moved around the `late_import`. The remaining `cache` global variable is used in the function just after. It makes sense to keep it there as it is not used anywhere else in the code.
