Keywords: number fields, coercion, pushout, composite field

For generic number fields, there is a method `composite_fields` that
preserves there embeddings, if they exists:

```
sage: z = QQ['z'].0
sage: K2 = NumberField(z^2 - 2,'s', embedding=AA(2).sqrt())
sage: K3 = NumberField(z^2 - 3,'t', embedding=AA(3).sqrt())
sage: K2.composite_fields(K3)
[Number Field in st with defining polynomial z^4 - 10*z^2 + 1 with st = 0.3178372451957823?]
```

This ticket implements the method `_pushout_` to return this composite field, if:
- it exists,
- is unique,
- and both fields have compatible embeddings (e.g. the pushout of the fields embedded to exists).

Thanks for pointing this out. I was aware of this method, but not that you had the discussion before.

Nevertheless, one could just devote this ticket here to implementing the case, where the fields are embedded into `QQbar`.

I figured this would be useful for rings in general.

Assuming this also makes coercion between `AA` and number fields embedded in `QQbar` possible, this would then help solve #28489 as far as I can see (possibly after #28774).

I also fixed a bug of the previous construction. It did try to coerce number fields embedded into `RLF` into `AA`, which did not work (the attribute `_embedded_real` is set to `True` in that case).

There is a failing doctest now in `sage/rings/qqbar.py` line 167, for which I need some help.

The test wants to make sure, that `QQ[I]` and `QQbar` cannot be implicitly coerced, as `QQ[I]` does not come with an embedding.

This makes sense, however this is not the way it is implemented:

```
sage: QQ[I]
Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 with I = 1*I
```
So `QQ[I]` does come with an embedding to `QQbar` and therefore I think my construction is correct in using this embedding.
Unlike this example

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 1); K
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
```
where my construction does not give a pushout.

To be more precise, as it is `QQ[I]` comes with an embedding to complex lazy field:

```
sage: coercion_model.explain(QQ[I], CLF)
Coercion on left operand via
    Generic morphism:
      From: Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 with I = 1*I
      To:   Complex Lazy Field
      Defn: I -> 1*I
Arithmetic performed after coercions.
Result lives in Complex Lazy Field
Complex Lazy Field
```
and there is a coercion from `QQbar` to `CLF`

```
sage: coercion_model.explain(QQbar, CLF)
Coercion on left operand via
    Generic morphism:
      From: Algebraic Field
      To:   Complex Lazy Field
Arithmetic performed after coercions.
Result lives in Complex Lazy Field
Complex Lazy Field
```
I find it very confusing, that there is a doctest fixing that there shall be no coercion of `QQ[I]` and `CLF`. If this is the way we want it to be, there should not be coercion of `QQ[I]` and `CLF` in the first place.

The same holds for `QQ[sqrt(2)]` btw. There is no embedding of `QQ[sqrt(2), sqrt(3)]` to `RLF`, but probably not by design but only because relative number fields do not support embeddings.
