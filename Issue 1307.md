I believe that database just contains the data that is exposed here:

http://good.math.iastate.edu/grout/graphs/

You can download one of the many SQLITE GUI tools listed at http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=ManagementTools and look at the database.

Well, so what about this database ? Do you think it would be a good idea to build a sqlite database for Sage with these graphs ? I do not know, for example, if this database will be compressed in any way, because there are a lot of graphs available and it could become a bit heavy.. 
Is there anything more efficient, in case the users needs to enumerate them all ?

Hey, thisÂ would be really useful.  Jason, if you see this, can you paste that code here?  Also, I'm not sure where your database lives now.  This could easily become an optional database, and Magma also has such things.
