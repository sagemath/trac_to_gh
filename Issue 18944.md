# Issue 18944: sage_gymnasium: typo in "Partialbruchzerlegung"

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: schilly

Original creation time: 2015-09-10 09:41:15

The formulas here: http://doc.sagemath.org/html/de/thematische_anleitungen/sage_gymnasium.html#partialbruchzerlegung are wrong (`x` instead of `x^2`), while the SageMath output is correct.

Original report sent to me via email from Helmut BÃ¼ch.
