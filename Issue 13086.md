# Issue 13086: Replace some deprecated functions in the documentation

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13258

Assignee: mvngu

This patch replaces some deprecated functions in the documentation (devel/sage/doc/) and removes the operator `<>`. This operator shouldn't be used because it's deprecated and not supported by Python 3 anymore.
