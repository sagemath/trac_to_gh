# Issue 20554: NumberField.extension() creates non-unique parents

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20791

Original creator: pbruin

Original creation time: 2016-06-09 06:49:48

The following should return `True`:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 1)
sage: K.extension(x^2 - 2, 'b') is K.extension(x^2 - 2, 'b')
False
```

This happens because `NumberField.extension()` does not use the `NumberField` factory.

If you could change `:trac:20791` to `:trac:`20791``, then if the patchbot is happy, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
