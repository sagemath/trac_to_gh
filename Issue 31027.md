Keywords: plot3d, zmin, zmax

Various types of 3d plots lack a way of
setting zmin and/or zmax, or a zrange:

- `plot3d`
- `plot` method of hyperplane arrangement
- `plot` method of polyhedron

while some others provide one, such as:

- `implicit_plot3d`
- `plot_vector_field3d`

This is frequently requested by users,
see for instance:

Where would be the appropriate place to read `zmin` and `zmax` keywords? Currently, they are stored in the `_extra_kwds` of the graphics object that is created but never read. A hacky way would be to use the `add_constraint` workaround (see above) and just do something like this:
