# Issue 31027: Allow setting zmin, zmax in plot3d and other 3d plots

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31264

Original creator: slelievre

Original creation time: 2021-01-19 17:00:02

CC:  slelievre

Keywords: plot3d, zmin, zmax

Various types of 3d plots lack a way of
setting zmin and/or zmax, or a zrange:

- `plot3d`
- `plot` method of hyperplane arrangement
- `plot` method of polyhedron

while some others provide one, such as:

- `implicit_plot3d`
- `plot_vector_field3d`

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

Where would be the appropriate place to read `zmin` and `zmax` keywords? Currently, they are stored in the `_extra_kwds` of the graphics object that is created but never read. A hacky way would be to use the `add_constraint` workaround (see above) and just do something like this:


```diff
--- a/src/sage/plot/plot3d/parametric_plot3d.py

         G = _parametric_plot3d_surface(f, urange, vrange, plot_points=plot_points, boundary_style=boundary_style, **kwds)
