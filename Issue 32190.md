Agreed this can be done.  If it applies properly and doing so with a finance command shows the deprecation command as I would expect, we should merge it.

Apparently, `sage.stats` depends on `sage.finance`, perhaps moving `time_series.*` from finance to stats would solve the issue.

There is one remaining failing doctest, related to the book "Computational mathematics with Sagemath" in the file `src/sage/tests/books/computational-mathematics-with-sagemath/graphique_doctest.py`. Let me CC one of the authors.

Proposal:

- keep the call to `finance.TimeSeries` untouched because it is written that way in the book
- add the `DeprecationWarning` to the output of the doctest to let it pass
- let the authors change the call to `finance.TimeSeries` to `stats.TimeSeries` when they update the book
