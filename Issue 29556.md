# Issue 29556: script packages should cd into the SPKG directory

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29793

This simplifies several `spkg-install` scripts and make script packages a bit more similar to normal packages.

This is a step towards #29386 (Install script packages via `sage-spkg`).

LGTM but is there some documentation that says what the initial working directory of spkg-install should be? It shouldn't be an implementation detail.
