# Issue 22941: Do not generate local/share/sage/doc/output symlink

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2017-06-08 14:47:08

The symlink

```
local/share/sage/doc/output -> .
```

was added for backwards compatibility in #20047. Let's remove it now.

Looks good to me. The link looks pretty stupid, anyway. Was it originally supposed to be to `SAGE_DOC_SRC`?

I don't remember why it was done that way. Let's just say for "historical reasons".
