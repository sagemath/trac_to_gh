I updated the "Collaborative Development with Git-Trac" https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/git_trac.html documentation to say how to configure ``git trac`` when you login to trac via Github

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

Moving tickets from the Sage 8.8 milestone that have been actively worked on in the last six months to the next release milestone (optimistically).

I believe this ticket is now redundant in light of comment:3  #27340
