Lots of failing tests because you missed this line in `words.py`:

```
self.cmp_letters = self._cmp_letters  # deprecated
```

Actually, you should be able to remove `cmp_letters` as well.

I would say either the failing doctest in `doctest/control.py` is invalid because it was checking the deprecation warning or it is now the correct output. However, since you wrote that, I guess you would know. :P

I reverted the conflicting change in `words.py` (involving `cmp_letters`). This way, the rest of this branch can still be merged.
