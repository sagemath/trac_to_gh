As mentioned in [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/_COZBKnRcVo), it would be nice to fix a convention for the typography of proper noun in functions. In other words what should be the standard
 1. `count_Heegner_points`
 2. `count_heegner_points`
 3. both (in which case we need to choose which one is an alias of the other)

The developer manual should be updated accordingly.
