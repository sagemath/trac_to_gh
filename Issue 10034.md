Now that Pynac will support 'hold' of symbolic expressions, like

```
sage: tan(pi/12,hold=True)
tan(1/12*pi)
```
we might want a 'context' for this.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10035

No, because this is really a followup to another ticket.  I'll cc: Burcin in, though he probably already gets it given the component.  I imagine something like

```
sage: context('hold') # or whatever the usual syntax is for such things - Sage doesn't have any yet
sage: a = tan(pi/12)
sage: a
tan(pi/12)
```
as opposed to evaluating it.

But with such a construction it is not obvious how to simplify 't' without going through Maxima as suggested in [#10034](http://trac.sagemath.org/search/opensearch?q=ticket%3A10034)


```
sage: with hold: 
....:     t = tan(pi/2) 
....: 
sage: t tan(pi/12) 
sage: t.eval() #or t.unhold() or whatever 
-sqrt(3) + 2

You are going through Maxima because the `simplify...` functions do this. So improve these by replacing Maxima. It has nothing to do with the question of a global hold context.

I think the best strategy is to keep the old functionality but replace doctests in tutorials and introductory docstrings (another ticket). As there will be more such contexts a syntax for multiple settings like `with context(hold, eval_fp, simplify):` seems best.

Note however that the Python directive `with` interactively acts on its content all at once. That is,

```
sage: with hold:
....:     sin(0)
....:     cos(0)
....:     
sin(0)
cos(0)

Maybe we should provide `start()/stop()` so people can do

```
sage: mycontext1 = context(...)
sage: mycontext2 = context(...)
sage: with mycontext1:
........
sage: mycontext2.start()
...
sage: mycontext2.stop()
