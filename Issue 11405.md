If the filename passed to save() contains a dot, save() assumes that the user doesnt just want to dump the (pickled) object, but instead wants to call the object's save() method. I guess this makes sense in situations like save(g, 'mygraph.png'), but the code should fall back to dumping the pickled version (e.g. via try: ... except AttributeError: ... - suggested via IRC by leif) if the object has no save() method.

leif also suggested checking if the file name extension is known - however I guess that we then should verify this with the object itself (e.g. it wouldn't make sense to save a graphics object to a .wav file) and not statically compare with a list of known extensions.

Finally...

The updated patch now adds another doctest and clarifies the description in the docstring. (I intentionally haven't changed it to enumerate all parameters as we normally do, as I think it is more readable as it is now, and `compress=True` should be self-explanatory. For some reason I don't get the correct default parameters shown when typing `save?` at the Sage prompt though.)

I originally wanted to add 

```python
    import os.path
    from sage.misc.misc import SAGE_TMP
    filename = os.path.join(SAGE_TMP, "foo.bar")
    ...
```

but then saw the other examples, so I guess *a lot of* doctests rely on
* having `SAGE_TMP` already imported (by `sage.all`), and also
* `SAGE_TMP` having a trailing slash (or `os.path.sep`),
the latter being perhaps a bit more dangerous than the former.

So I also just used `SAGE_TMP + "..."`.

Oh, I did not notice the true keywords.

The most disturbing thing with `SAGE_TMP` is IMHO that it ignores settings of `TMP`, `TMPDIR` and `TEMP`, and -- worse -- does not even use `/tmp/` which is more likely to be on a local (usually auto-cleaned) file system than `$HOME/.sage/`, and I don't expect people to change `DOT_SAGE`  to live on a temporary filesystem. (Ok, one can still create a symbolic link from `~/.sage/temp` to whatever is desired, but who knows? Especially since there's also `~/.sage/tmp/` and of course `$SAGE_ROOT/tmp/`.) We furthermore had `SAGE_TMPDIR` and `SAGE_TESTDIR`, the former meanwhile changed to the latter. I'll perhaps open a `sage-devel` thread on that (to make William happy).

Ok. Regarding extensions, I'd consider `foo.png` having *one*, while `foo.baz` and `foo.bar` (non-exclusively) having *some*. :-)
