# Issue 15355: Birational rowmotion

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15592

Original creator: darij

Original creation time: 2013-12-26 00:56:56

CC:  sage-combinat tscrim jessicapalencia aschilling vbraun

Keywords: birational rowmotion, posets, combinat

This is a heavily refactored version of the code Tom and I used in studying birational rowmotion and showed around in Bures-sur-Yvette. It is missing some of the hacky research-related methods but the main features are there.

Hey Darij,

I've fixed up the doc and changed the arg `alphabet` to `prefix` in `birational_free_labelling()`. I tried to implement `birational_toggles()` and `birational_rowmotion()` using a `reduce`, but this didn't net any speedup. Somewhat surprisingly to me, this actually slowed it down slightly, even with avoiding the extra `lambda` calls by swapping the order of the arguments in `birational_toggle()`.

Anyways, if you're happy with my changes, then it's a positive review.

Best,

Travis

Thank you Travis! This was honestly the patch I least expected to get a speedy review...

Are you fine with the last fixes I just made? (I added a reference to an abstract which was just put online today and which, weirdly, has some content the main paper does not.)

Your welcome, it is interesting.

Yep, looks good.

Thanks for the catch. Am I right to assume that this

```
            existing elements of `P` and `1`. Now, a `\mathbf{K}`*-labelling
            of* `P` will mean any function from `\widehat{P}` to `\mathbf{K}`.
```

should be this:

```
            existing elements of `P` and `1`. Now, a *`\mathbf{K}`-labelling
            of* `P` will mean any function from `\widehat{P}` to `\mathbf{K}`.
```

(I can't compile doc fast enough to check this now.)

I think this should be the correct way of doing things:

```
            existing elements of `P` and `1`. Now, a `\mathbf{K}`-*labelling
            of* `P` will mean any function from `\widehat{P}` to `\mathbf{K}`.
```

Sorry, the bug was on a different line. Apparently Sphinx doesn't like italics beginning or ending in the middle of a word, and I had `*pro*motion`.

I guess it's positive_review due to the insignificance of the edits.
