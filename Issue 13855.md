In #2435, the deallocation function in sage/rings/integer.pyx became as follows:

```python
cdef void fast_tp_dealloc(PyObject* o):

    # If there is room in the pool for a used integer object,
    # then put it in rather than deallocating it.

    global integer_pool, integer_pool_count
    
    if integer_pool_count < integer_pool_size:
    
        # Here we free any extra memory used by the mpz_t by
        # setting it to a single limb. 
        if (<__mpz_struct *>( <char *>o + mpz_t_offset))._mp_alloc > 10:
            _mpz_realloc(<mpz_t *>( <char *>o + mpz_t_offset), 10)
            
        # It's cheap to zero out an integer, so do it here. 
        (<__mpz_struct *>( <char *>o + mpz_t_offset))._mp_size = 0
        
        # And add it to the pool.
        integer_pool[integer_pool_count] = o
        integer_pool_count += 1
        return

    # Again, we move to the mpz_t and clear it. See above, why this is evil.
    # The clean version of this line would be:
    #   mpz_clear(<mpz_t>(<char *>o + mpz_t_offset))

    mpz_free((<__mpz_struct *>( <char *>o + mpz_t_offset) )._mp_d, 0)

    # Free the object. This assumes that Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC is not
    # set. If it was set another free function would need to be
    # called.

    PyObject_FREE(o)
```


The purpose of #2435 was to fix a memory leak introduced in #1337. Problem: One has to manually incref `ONE`, which I find a bit suspicious.

When I build sage-5.7.beta2 in debug version (as by #13864), Sage crashes at exit, while attempting `PyObject_FREE(o)`. I will attach backtraces in comments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.

At least, this is not due to Python being built with --pydebug as it happens on my 5.7.beta[1|2] with SAGE_DEBUG=yes but without the correct Python spkg.

What is the original purpose of fast_tp_dealloc? If I understand it correctly, if there is enough room left on the stack, then dead integers are put there (and I guess get freed in a whole bunch, which is cheaper than freeing them one by one), otherwise fast_tp_dealloc explicitly removes them.

And I see that the Integer class has a `__dealloc__` method; but it seems that 

```
hook_tp_functions(global_dummy_Integer, NULL, <newfunc>&fast_tp_new, NULL, &fast_tp_dealloc, False)
```

is then used to override the __dealloc__, or what?

And concerning the global_dummy_Integer, I see the comment

```
# We use a global Integer element to steal all the references
# from.  DO NOT INITIALIZE IT AGAIN and DO NOT REFERENCE IT!
cdef Integer global_dummy_Integer
global_dummy_Integer = Integer()
```


Sounds like black magic to me. Robert, can you elaborate how it all works?

Namely, when I uncomment `mpz_init( <mpz_t>(<char *>new + mpz_t_offset) )` and comment the last line, then the module won't build:

```
sage/rings/integer.c: In function ‘__pyx_f_4sage_5rings_7integer_fast_tp_new’:

Error installing modified sage library code.
```


So, the "clean version" doesn't even build.

I think the point of this black magic is to keep a pool of pointers to Sage integers rather than allocating/freeing one each time a new one is needed/deleted.

So when you want a new integer and there are preallocated ones left you just grab one and when you want to delete one, and there is room left in the pool, you put it back there.

FLINT more or less uses a similar strategy (in single threaded mode).

The commented out line makes sense, inside the memory allocated for a Sage integer, we move to the address reserved for the mpz structure and initialize it, I guess its just illegal to cast to mpz_t type which is a typedef for an array of mpz of size one, something like mpz* should be used.

Not quite sure what the global dummy integer is used for, obviously for dark magic refcounting, but still unclear to me.

The point of the global dummy integer is to fool.

Yep, I understood that much.

So, you think one needs to write `mpz_init( <__mpz_struct*>(<char *>new + mpz_t_offset)`instead of `mpz_init( <mpz_t>(<char *>new + mpz_t_offset)`, and similar for deallocation?

The problem occurs when deallocating ONE, which is allocated before the hooks are setup, with the hooked method.

Creating ONE after hooking up the method (seemingly) solves the problem.

OK. But ONE is not the only integer that gets created before setting the hook.

The created integers are:

* 0
* 1
* ONE (hence, the integer 1 is created, and then another 1 is created and assigned to ONE)
* -1
* 0
* 1
* `global_dummy_Integer` (which is 0)

And them the hooks are established.

But probably we should take care of the other elements as well.

By the way: There is another way to make the segfault vanish. We could simply insert print statements, that print the memory addresses of the integers when they are created/deleted/taken from the pool/put into the pool. It works (but don't take it as a serious suggestion...)!

So, how did you find out that ONE is deallocated with the hooked method?

Looking at the enhanced backtrace.
A dict is deallocated and our tools are smart enough to print the name of the object in the dict with there address and one step further the fats_tp_dealloc method is called on the address corresponding to ONE.

> Yup.

It is obvious where the integers between ONE and `global_dummy_Integer` come from:

```
ONE = Integer(1)
cdef long small_pool_min = -1
cdef long small_pool_max = 1
cdef list small_pool = [Integer(k) for k in range(small_pool_min, small_pool_max+1)]
cdef inline Integer smallInteger(long value):
    cdef Integer z
    if small_pool_min <= value <= small_pool_max:
        return <Integer>small_pool[value - small_pool_min]
    else:
        z = PY_NEW(Integer)
        mpz_set_si(z.value, value)
        return z
```

Before ONE, the function `zero_one_elements()` creates 0 and 1.

So, our current guess is that we should move the creation of the dummy and the hooking to the very beginning of the module, right?

I don't really think your solution is right.
As I mentioned these small integers won't be deallocated anyway as they are cdefed, so we don't care.

And I'm not really sure that doing anything after the global dummy is created rather than after the hook is in place (I'm aware of http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/2435#comment:10, but that might just be cosmic rays).

For further investigation, the Py_INCREF of the global dummy in sage/misc/allocator.pyx seems useless as well now as it is cdefed and won't be collected.

I meant that following what you posted you should have tried to create the integers different from the dummy one just after the dummy one and not after the hooks are in place.

But as stated above, I agree that it is cleaner to create everything after the hooks are in place, except for dummy of course cos its not possible.
And anyway these integers are cdefed so wont be garbage collected automatically, although you can trigger their deletion by calling del on them.

And it would make a small slowdown to keep this incref :)
And prevent a proper deallocation of ONE when Sage quits, if we ever want or manage to do that.

It is not a problem outside of debug mode I guess.

In debug mode the problem is that it seems that the object has been malloced/created without these surrounding FORBIDDENBYTE (and some additional info including the size allocated, and what API was used), but when it is deallocaed (what happened because a Py_INCREF was removed in #12615, and ONE was not cdefed), the dealloc functions look for these bytes (that's the OUCH part), and then try to reach something based on the size allocated which should be stored next to these bytes.

I meant the other INCREF mentioned here http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/2435#comment:6 and with no info on why it would be needed.

About the INCREF on dummy, my point is that it is useless as dummy is cdefed and won't be automatically collected.
But indeedit could be called on something not cdefed so let's keep it.

Hum, the problem with this BYTE marker has really something to do with the change of allocator/deallocator.

If I remove the call to hook_fast_tp_functions, then the integers created, even during an interactive session, are preceded by CLEANBYTE rather than FORBIDDENBYTE and deallocated without problems.

So I guess I'll have to have a closer look at Python's code...

That's quite exactly what I've been ranting about and hoped we could better understand although the problem is not at this level but deeper it seems.

A first guess is that somehow the deep PyObject_Malloc function used before the hooks are setup is not the debug version and do not produce the FORBIDDENBYTE markers (and additional info including the size alloced) and the PyObject_Free function is not as well and does not expect them and everything is fine if we try to deallocate ONE (you can put an explicit del statement and check there is not crash, or completely remove the hooks setup).
But when the hooks are setup, these two functions get replaced by the Malloc and Free debug functions which set and expect the FORBIDDENBYTE markers (and some additional info).
So at dealloc time it bangs.
What I don't understand is why these two last debug version would not used from the start.
After all were living in a debug build of Python...

So our workaround here is just to make sure that Integer allocated before the hooks are setup do not get deallocated, even when Sage start.

It has two flavours:
* cdef the Integer, so there is no automatic collection,
* artificially increase its refcount so that it never reaches zero.

And we use both.

Ok got it.

The problem is that the dummy is allocated with the PyObject_GC_Malloc function and that adds an additional header of 32 bytes before the object itself.
And if you look 36 bytes before the object itself you indeed find the FORBIDDENBYTE markers.

Indeed. Types that are not container type (types that do not hold references to other python objects) need not be tracked by GC. I don't think Cython supports "not GC tracked" by default. Basically all Sage objects formally are container types because they have a _parent pointer or something like that.

Integers do too, but since ZZ is supposed to be immortal anyway, it doesn't matter.

It means that

```
del ZZ
```

would not lead to ZZ actually being deallocated (even if there are no other references to it anymore, because `ZZ.one_element` would have a pointer to `ZZ` that can't be discovered to be part of the cycle by GC.
