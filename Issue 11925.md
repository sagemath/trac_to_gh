After `F.truncate()`, should there also be a line `F.close()`?  Or does the `with` clause automatically close `F`?

Yes! From http://docs.python.org/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects

```
sage: with open('/tmp/workfile', 'rw') as f:
....:     read_data = f.read()
....:     
sage: f.closed
True
```
