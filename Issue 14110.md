```
sage: m = matrix({(0,0):4,(5,3):2})
sage: matrix(m) 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/travis/sage-5.8.beta1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/matrix/constructor.pyc in _matrix_constructor(*args, **kwds)
    526                 return args[0]._matrix_(sparse=sparse)
    527         except TypeError:
--> 528                 return args[0]._matrix_()
    529     elif len(args) == 2:
    530         if hasattr(args[0], '_matrix_'):

TypeError: _matrix_() takes exactly one argument (0 given)
```

In both sparse and dense integer matrices (I didn't check for other kinds), the expected input is 1 argument of a new ring for the entries.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

I gave `_matrix_()` a default argument of `None` and if no argument is passed in, it just returns the original matrix.

Thanks for the patch, I had this annoying issue on TODO for a while ;-)
