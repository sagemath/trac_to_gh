hello,

    with version 8.0 of sagemath/sagemath image docker, sagemath detect all my cpus:
   
`$ docker run -it --rm sagemath/sagemath:8.0 sage`
    [SageMath](SageMath) version 8.0, Release Date: 2017-07-21\\
    Forcing sage-location, probably because a new package was installed.\\
    Updating various hardcoded paths…\\
    (Please wait at most a few minutes.)\\
    DO NOT INTERRUPT THIS.\\
    Done updating paths.\\
    sage: `sage.parallel.ncpus.ncpus()`
    8

    with version 8.1 and latest sagemath detect only one cpu:
    
`docker run -it --rm sagemath/sagemath:latest sage `
    ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\\
    │ [SageMath](SageMath) version 8.2, Release Date: 2018-05-05 │\\
    │ Type "notebook()" for the browser-based notebook interface. │\\
    │ Type "help()" for help. │\\
    └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\\
    Setting permissions of DOT_SAGE directory so only you can read and write it.\\
    sage: `sage.parallel.ncpus.ncpus()`
    1

and if i launch "nproc" in container i have all my cpus:

`docker run -it --rm sagemath/sagemath:latest nproc`
8
saraedum say Me i had the same pb after Building sagemath 8.1+ from scratch.
it seems to be a bug with sagemath since 8.1 version.

Can you help me , please

If you just want to set the number of cores and ignore the automatic detection, you can do

```
$ docker run -e SAGE_NUM_THREADS=123 -it sagemath/sagemath sage -c 'print sage.parallel.ncpus.ncpus()'
Setting permissions of DOT_SAGE directory so only you can read and write it.
123
