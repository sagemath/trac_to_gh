CC:  @saraedum

Keywords: parallel

In recent docker images

```
docker run -it --rm sagemath/sagemath:latest sage
sage: sage.parallel.ncpus.ncpus()
1
```
in 8.0 this still returned the actual number of cores.

This seems to be unrelated to the fact that this is running in the docker image.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25779

If you just want to set the number of cores and ignore the automatic detection, you can do

```
$ docker run -e SAGE_NUM_THREADS=123 -it sagemath/sagemath sage -c 'print sage.parallel.ncpus.ncpus()'
Setting permissions of DOT_SAGE directory so only you can read and write it.
123
```
