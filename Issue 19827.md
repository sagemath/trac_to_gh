See #18836.  This bug is holding up that (and also #20028).  The following code creates an elemnt d of QQbar and tries to do d.sqrt().  It fails unless you call d.imag().is_zero() first.

```
K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)

# define a low-precision embedding from K to CC:                                                                

emb = K.embeddings(CC)[1]

# extend this to the closest embedding into QQbar:                                                              

old_gen = emb(K.gen())
rr = K.defining_polynomial().roots(QQbar, multiplicities=False)
diffs = [(CC(r)-old_gen).abs() for r in rr]
new_gen = rr[diffs.index(min(diffs))]
emb0 = K.hom([new_gen], check=False)

# Take a polynomial with 3 roots in K:                                                                          

e1 = -4+i
e2 = 1+i
e3 = 3-2*i
print("Original ei: %s with parent %s" % ([e1,e2,e3],parent(e1)))
x = polygen(K)
pol = (x-e1)*(x-e2)*(x-e3)

# Find the roots again in QQbar:                                                                                

pol0 = PolynomialRing(QQbar,'x')([emb0(c) for c in list(pol)])
e1, e2, e3 = pol0.roots(QQbar,multiplicities=False)
print("Roots ei: %s with parent %s" % ([e1,e2,e3],parent(e1)))

# Attempt to compute sqrt(e1-e2) from these:                                                                    

d = e1-e2
print("d=%s with parent %s" % (d,d.parent()))
# If the next 2 lines are commented out, an error is raised in the sqrt!                                        
s = d.imag().is_zero()
print("d.imag().is_zero()=%s" % s)
print("d=%s with parent %s" % (d,d.parent()))
d = d.sqrt()
print("d=%s" % d)
```

(Extracted from #18836 comment 9)

> The fact that `_value` becomes a _real_ interval element is probably due to this implementation (line 7431 of `sage/rings/qqbar.py`)

> Looking at it a little bit more, I think the error is in fact in `__pow__` (sage/rings/qqbar.py:4233). I expect it's  not invalid for `_value` to be a RIF element. That seems to happen quite a bit:
> {{{

> It's just that elements where that happens are usually filtered out earlier. So in this case, `d` isn't recognized as a rational number yet when we enter, but then in the for loop on line 4304, we have that on line 4322 we execute:
> {{{
>                val = self._interval_fast(prec)
> }}}
> So actually, on the first pass `val` is a CIF element. We apparently get an error on the second pass, when `val` has been forced through `_interval_fast`.

> So I see two solutions: either ensure that val is put back into CIF or ensure that "argument extraction" is done appropriately in cases where "val" is in RIF.

Surely it is simplest to implement arg for RIF elements, returning 0 or Pi depending on sign provided that the interval has constant sign, and raising an error otherwise?

Replying to [comment:2 cremona]:
> Surely it is simplest to implement arg for RIF elements, returning 0 or Pi depending on sign provided that the interval has constant sign, and raising an error otherwise?

I would regard that as a "change in design/API", though. I think our real fields currently quite consistently do not have an "argument" method:

```
sage: CC(-4).argument()
3.14159265358979
sage: RR(-4).argument()
AttributeError: ...
sage: CDF(-4).argument()
3.141592653589793
sage: RDF(-4).argument()
AttributeError: ...
```

Your proposal is in line with the solution taken in #18337 (to put "real" and "imag" on RIF) so perhaps putting "argument" there is the simplest solution.

From an efficiency point of view: I'm not sure how hard we'd be hitting the coercion system by mixing RIF and CIF elements.

This looks good to me.  I have checked that it deals with the original problems I had at #18836, so I am going to set this to positive_review, make that ticket depend on this and set that one to needs_review.
