See #18836.  This bug is holding up that (and also #20028).  The following code creates an elemnt d of QQbar and tries to do d.sqrt().  It fails unless you call d.imag().is_zero() first.

```
K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)

# define a low-precision embedding from K to CC:                                                                

emb = K.embeddings(CC)[1]

# extend this to the closest embedding into QQbar:                                                              

old_gen = emb(K.gen())
rr = K.defining_polynomial().roots(QQbar, multiplicities=False)
diffs = [(CC(r)-old_gen).abs() for r in rr]
new_gen = rr[diffs.index(min(diffs))]
emb0 = K.hom([new_gen], check=False)

# Take a polynomial with 3 roots in K:                                                                          

e1 = -4+i
e2 = 1+i
e3 = 3-2*i
print("Original ei: %s with parent %s" % ([e1,e2,e3],parent(e1)))
x = polygen(K)
pol = (x-e1)*(x-e2)*(x-e3)

# Find the roots again in QQbar:                                                                                

pol0 = PolynomialRing(QQbar,'x')([emb0(c) for c in list(pol)])
e1, e2, e3 = pol0.roots(QQbar,multiplicities=False)
print("Roots ei: %s with parent %s" % ([e1,e2,e3],parent(e1)))

# Attempt to compute sqrt(e1-e2) from these:

print("d=%s with parent %s" % (d,d.parent()))
# If the next 2 lines are commented out, an error is raised in the sqrt!                                        
s = d.imag().is_zero()
print("d.imag().is_zero()=%s" % s)
print("d=%s with parent %s" % (d,d.parent()))
d = d.sqrt()
print("d=%s" % d)
```

Surely it is simplest to implement arg for RIF elements, returning 0 or Pi depending on sign provided that the interval has constant sign, and raising an error otherwise?

Replying to [comment:2 cremona]:
> Surely it is simplest to implement arg for RIF elements, returning 0 or Pi depending on sign provided that the interval has constant sign, and raising an error otherwise?

I would regard that as a "change in design/API", though. I think our real fields currently quite consistently do not have an "argument" method:

```
sage: CC(-4).argument()
3.14159265358979
sage: RR(-4).argument()
AttributeError: ...
sage: CDF(-4).argument()
3.141592653589793
sage: RDF(-4).argument()
AttributeError: ...
```

Your proposal is in line with the solution taken in #18337 (to put "real" and "imag" on RIF) so perhaps putting "argument" there is the simplest solution.

From an efficiency point of view: I'm not sure how hard we'd be hitting the coercion system by mixing RIF and CIF elements.
