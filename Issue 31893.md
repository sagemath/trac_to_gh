# Issue 31893: _sympy_ method for function objects

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32130

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2021-07-05 01:07:52

Currently we have:

```
sage: from sympy import sympify
sage: sympify(sin(x))
sin(x)
sage: 
sage: sympify(sin)
SymPyDeprecationWarning: 

String fallback in sympify has been deprecated since SymPy 1.6. Use
sympify(str(obj)) or sympy.core.sympify.converter or obj._sympy_
instead. 
```


We should fix this by providing functions with a `sympy` method that implements the same conversion as `SympyConverter.composition`.
