# Issue 16874: Sage is missing one letter

Issue created by migration from Trac.

After #17034 Sage reports :


```
sage: designs.orthogonal_arrays.explain_construction(10,154)
'the database contains a (154,10;1,0;17)-quasi difference matrix'
```


But we have no `(154,10;1,0;17)`-QDM. Here is what it should be:


```
sage: designs.orthogonal_arrays.explain_construction(10,154)
'the database contains a (137,10;1,0;17)-quasi difference matrix'
```


And this is because of a missing 'n'

Thanks !

(I am working on a design patch at the moment. For incomplete orthogonal arrays. But I don't know how to write it yet `:-/`)

Not really. The does not remain SOOOOO many OA to build. Then it will be the researcher's turn to build new ones !
