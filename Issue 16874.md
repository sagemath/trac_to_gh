After #17034 Sage reports :


```
sage: designs.orthogonal_arrays.explain_construction(10,154)
'the database contains a (154,10;1,0;17)-quasi difference matrix'
```


But we have no `(154,10;1,0;17)`-QDM. Here is what it should be:


```
sage: designs.orthogonal_arrays.explain_construction(10,154)
'the database contains a (137,10;1,0;17)-quasi difference matrix'
```


And this is because of a missing 'n'
