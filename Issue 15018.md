CC:  ncohen

The name assigned to GridGraph was incorrect because the `networkx.grid_graph(dim)` method modifies the input list of dimensions. This patch solves this issue.

Before:

```
sage: G = graphs.GridGraph([2,3,4])
sage: G
Grid Graph for []: Graph on 24 vertices
sage: G = graphs.Grid2dGraph(4,5)
sage: G
2D Grid Graph: Graph on 20 vertices
```


After:

```
sage: G = graphs.GridGraph([2,3,4])
sage: G
Grid Graph for [2, 3, 4]: Graph on 24 vertices
sage: G = graphs.Grid2dGraph(4,5)
sage: G
2D Grid Graph for (4, 5): Graph on 20 vertices
```

Why is there `[]` in one result and `()` in the other ?

Grid2DGraph don't call GridGraph and so names are set in each function.

I have changed the Grid2DGraph function so that in uses `[]` too.

We can find many other methods for which the naming convention is not consistent. For instance:

```
sage: G = graphs.Toroidal6RegularGrid2dGraph(6,6)
sage: G
Toroidal Hexagonal Grid graph on 6x6 elements: Graph on 36 vertices
sage: G = graphs.ToroidalGrid2dGraph(6,6)
sage: G
Toroidal 2D Grid Graph with parameters 6,6: Graph on 36 vertices
```

Should I try to fix them too in this patch? but then which is the best convention?

Thanks.

I think it is not a good idea to change other string representations. Maybe in another ticket..

Please add doctests to document the new behavior and the solved issues.
