# Issue 22301: INFINITY is not an enum

Issue created by migration from Trac.

This is very wrong:

```
cdef extern from "math.h":
    enum: INFINITY
```

An `enum` is assumed to be an `int`, so this actually treats `INFINITY` as an `int`. This causes compiler warnings `warning: overflow in implicit constant conversion [-Woverflow]`.
