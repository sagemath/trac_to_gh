This ticket is used to keep track of the progress towards python3.

Situation in 8.4.b4

Folders where all tests pass:

* lfunctions
* knots

Folders with work in progress:

* quivers
* finance
* plot

good progress on 8.5.b0

The six remaining files with many failures are

```
['sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/finite_state_machine.py  # 189 doctests failed',
 'sage -t --long src/sage/dynamics/arithmetic_dynamics/projective_ds.py  # 105 doctests failed',

For whoever wants to work on it, regarding

```
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/finite_state_machine.py  # 189 doctests failed
```

about 150 of the failures can be cured by replacing 'iteritems' by 'items' in lines like

```
        elif hasattr(data, 'iteritems'):
            # data is a dict (or something similar),
```

I don't know if 'items' is the right attribute to check, or if it would actually be better to change to `isinstance(data, dict)`. What other data structures are mean to be acceptable? What is "something similar" to a dict?

There is some custom "Mapping types" in sage like `FreeModuleElement_generic_sparse`, which implements `items` and `iteritems` but doesn't inherit from `dict`.

There was a regression in the manifolds folder (sigh)..

The 3 remaining files with more than 100 failing doctests are

```
['sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/finite_state_machine.py  # 182 doctests failed',
 'sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py  # 109 doctests failed',
 'sage -t --long src/sage/rings/padics/padic_lattice_element.py  # 167 doctests failed']
```

The first one is already tackled in #26147 at least partially.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2018-10-27 21:17:22

Regarding

```
'sage -t --long src/sage/rings/padics/padic_lattice_element.py  # 167 doctests failed'
```

I can reproduce those failures when I run `./sage -t ...`, but (at least for the first few) not when I run Sage interactively. Odd.

maybe due to the upgrade of gap, there is a regression:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/groups/matrix_gps/finitely_generated.py
  # 3 doctests failed
```

```
['src/sage/categories/crystals.py',
 'src/sage/matroids/circuit_closures_matroid.pyx',
 'src/sage/matroids/dual_matroid.py']

file where failing doctests have disappeared (progress):

```
['src/sage/misc/decorators.py',
 'src/sage/rings/polynomial/laurent_polynomial.pyx']

so this is a net loss of 1 file

Re

```

I only see 6 failed doctests (this is on OS X; is it platform dependent?).

Comment by dcoudert created at 2019-02-16 09:55:32

There are certainly some differences between plateforms and other factors. For instance, I see this, which is not in the reported worst 15:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/digraph.py  # 14 doctests failed
```

I had 14 with 8.7.beta1, only 7 with beta2 and beta3, and now 14 again. All these failed doctests are related to the order of items in the output. See #27170.

Is there a followup ticket to modify `src/ext/doctest/python3-known-passing.txt`? Should that happen for every beta, or just every actual release? Anyway, we should add `algebras`, `data_structures`, `homology`, `modular`, `modules`, `schemes/curves`, `schemes/product_projective`. What am I missing?

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-05-05 03:14:04

Regarding `matroids`: there is some piece of underlying data which is intrinsically unordered, and it is causing all sorts of failures. I don't know if it's best to mark them all `# py3 random` or to sort the data so this doesn't happen. Is there an active Sage developer who knows enough about matroids to help make this decision?

Sure, but make sure to check #27791: closed but not yet merged into a beta release.

Edit: oh, sorry, that deals with multi_polynomial, and you were talking about multi_polynomial_ideal. I don't see any relevant tickets, so please go ahead.

**EDIT** wrong ticket

Comment by embray created at 2019-06-14 14:54:19

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

In 8.9.beta0:

```
less than 1 : 9
less than 2 : 12
less than 4 : 17
less than 8 : 20
less than 16 : 22
```

In the 15 worst files, 64 broken doctests:

```
['src/sage/tests/books/computational-mathematics-with-sagemath/graphtheory_doctest.py  # 1 doctest failed',
 'src/sage/tests/books/computational-mathematics-with-sagemath/sol/graphtheory_doctest.py  # 1 doctest failed',

```


There is an unexpected failure in 8.9.beta0 in the schemes folder :

```
sage -t --long src/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_finite_field.py  # 1 doctest failed on line 780
```

apparently, new regression here:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron/base.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
```

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-07-20 23:57:00

Can anyone provide any more information on the "fragile" doctests? In repeated runs, I get no failures (on OS X) with

```
./sage -tp --long src/sage/repl src/sage/numerical/ src/sage/libs
```

For the doctest failures in `french_book`, it is not clear to me what sort of changes are allowed, since the book is now in press. Should the failing tests just be marked as `# py2` until the authors present a better solution?

Comment by @mwageringel created at 2019-07-21 05:30:40

The failures can be seen in the logs of the Python 3 patchbot: https://patchbot.sagemath.org/ticket/0/. Without being able to reproduce these, they still seem pretty difficult to solve though.

Yes, the 8 last failing doctests in `generic_graph.py` have been fixed with #27232. So, all doctests in the standard graphs module are now fixed !!!

We still have some failing doctests in optional packages like `plantri` #28108. I have now yet checked all other optional packages. Do we have a meta-ticket to record them ?


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-07-29 17:37:33

Is this a new one? All tests in `schemes` are supposed to pass.

```
'src/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_finite_field.py  # 1 doctest failed'
```



---

Comment by chapoton created at 2019-07-29 19:03:27

I think I have seen that already in previous betas, maybe since 8.9.beta3 or before.

EDIT: it was already there in 8.9.b0 (see above)


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-07-29 22:38:08

Is there a ticket for it? What's the error? (I don't see it on my OS X machines.)


---

Comment by vklein created at 2019-07-30 07:27:29

I don't have it either on ubuntu 16.04.


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2019-07-30 07:54:42

There is no ticket for this error in schemes. The exact error can be seen in the patchbot log:

```
https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/0/Ubuntu/16.04/x86_64/4.4.0-148-generic/atlas/2019-07-29%2008:49:23?short
```


This patchtbot is running on an ubuntu 16.04, using gcc 8.3.0.

Maybe we should start a new ticket for the final polishing ? This one is very long already.

Good idea. It's great seeing the progress!

I have created #28298 for the few remaining final steps.

**LARGE SCALE REGRESSION** in 8.9.b5, with 241 failing doctests !!!!

EDIT: This could have been caused by a wrong version of gcc being used. Will retry.

For what it's worth, on OS X I only see one new failure, due to #28225, a proposed fix at #28320.

This was a false alert, due to a wrong gcc. There are 18 failing doctests.
