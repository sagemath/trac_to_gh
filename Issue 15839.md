CC:  @embray

Keywords: python3

The tool 2to3 renames `__nonzero__` to `__bool__`.


But the code has to depend on the Python version!

There are 25 effected modules. 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

Here is a brute-force tentative

* search and replace `__nonzero__` by `__bool__`
* remove the former lines that have become `__bool__ = __bool__`

Let us see what happens..

The way I've seen for this to be 2/3 compatible is to have `__bool__` be an alias for `__nonzero__` (or vice versa). The other way we could hack this is have in `SageObject`, as almost everything has this as a base class, we implement:

```python
def __bool__(self):
    return self.__nonzero__()
```

Hello Travis,

if you feel like giving it a try, please do. There is an abstract method `__nonzero__` somewhere, which is the last place where `__nonzero__` is not an alias (in python files).

I think we should keep things as `__nonzero__` for right now (up to having an explicit alias) for right now since we are in Python2 and to avoid the extra redirection. Although I guess to test how much this would cover things for Python3, it would have to be with a Python3 build.

I know that this reply is pointless is now, but I guess that something like that would have worked :-)

We are doing something similar for division in `CategoryObject`:

```
from __future__ import division

cdef class CategoryObject(SageObject):
    def __div__(self, other):
        return self / other
```
