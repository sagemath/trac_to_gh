I think this should be a FAQ.

In the patch it says:
"In Python 1 is a machine integer ``int`` (32 or 64 bits depending on your machine) and ``Integer(1)`` is ..."
That's not quite true. Python's "int" type is a bit shorter than the machine word length and they automatically extend to "long" in case of overflow. In Python 3, the only type visible is "int" and whether you have one or the other is an implementation detail.

Note that http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html is a bit misleading: Yes, python int is implemented via C-style "long" but that doesn't imply that maxint is the typical maxint for 64 or 32 bit:

```
>>> import sys
>>> sys.maxint
9223372036854775807
>>> 2**63
9223372036854775808L
