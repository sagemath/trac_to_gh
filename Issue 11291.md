# Issue 11291: Add a Sage vs. Python FAQ

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: hivert

Original creation time: 2011-06-11 07:48:15

Assignee: mvngu

Keywords: FAQ

We've bee asked to following question in #10519:

> I thought this might be because amgf.sage is a Sage file and not a Python
> file. So i renamed it amgf.py instead and got syntax errors. What's up with
> that? Do i have to rewrite all my code in Python instead of Sage?

I think this should be a FAQ.

It might be worth mentioning `sage -preparse`. Also, for most users (especially those not trying to add to the library) it is much safer to import what you need from `sage.all` it's just too easy to shoot yourself in the foot otherwise. (Even for library code, it's better to import PolynomialRing from sage.rings.all or sage.rings.polynomial.alll than sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring_constructor--it's safer, helps reduce the spaghetti of imports that we currently have, and is more future-proof.

Note that this reproduces a little bit from the tutorial: see [http://sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/afterword.html#the-pre-parser-differences-between-sage-and-python](http://sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/afterword.html#the-pre-parser-differences-between-sage-and-python).

In the patch it says:
"In Python 1 is a machine integer ``int`` (32 or 64 bits depending on your machine) and ``Integer(1)`` is ..."
That's not quite true. Python's "int" type is a bit shorter than the machine word length and they automatically extend to "long" in case of overflow. In Python 3, the only type visible is "int" and whether you have one or the other is an implementation detail.

Note that http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html is a bit misleading: Yes, python int is implemented via C-style "long" but that doesn't imply that maxint is the typical maxint for 64 or 32 bit:

```
>>> import sys
>>> sys.maxint
9223372036854775807
>>> 2**63
9223372036854775808L
```

I am attaching a grammar review patch for the original patch. The modifications I made include:
    * Minor grammar corrections;
    * Added some commas;
    * Replaced a couple of words;
    * Set the text width of the raw text file to 70 characters (like the rest of the file).

The en/faq document builds properly in both html and pdf formats.

I am not qualified to review the technical contents of the FAQ.

Hey Florent,

I've uploaded a second review patch which fixes some formatting and does some tweaks to address the above comments. If you agree with my changes, feel free to set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis

The patch doesn't apply to sage-5.8.

I don't know why it was specified only to apply my review patch. All 3 patches need to be applied, and it works for me in `5.9.beta5`.

I tweaked the wording around so that it doesn't have the doctesting framework call the test. I did it this way so that we wouldn't have a `# not tested` which might confuse readers. Needs another review.
