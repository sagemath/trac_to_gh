I think somebody changed something elsewhere that dims.py depends on, which resulted in breaking dimension_new_cusp_forms when the character is trivial and the level is 1 or 2.


```
sage: dimension_new_cusp_forms(DirichletGroup(1)(1), 12)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    305     elif isinstance(X, dirichlet.DirichletCharacter):

    307     elif isinstance(X, (int,long,Integer)):
    308         return Gamma0(X).dimension_new_cusp_forms(k,p=p)

```

It seems like bigger levels work fine...

```
sage: dimension_new_cusp_forms(DirichletGroup(3)(1), 12)
1
sage: dimension_new_cusp_forms(DirichletGroup(4)(1), 12)
1
```

Just for the record: that "somebody" was me, at ticket #11601. From that ticket description:

"Some "rationalisation" is also included: e.g. one can no longer create Gamma1(1) or GammaH(11, [2]), which previously existed as less-functional duplicates of SL2Z and Gamma0(11)."
