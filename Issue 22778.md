Provide a corresponding Sage function for Giac's `rootof`. From the inline help of XCAS:

> `rootof(LstPoly(P),LstPoly(Q))`: Polynomial in terms of a root of an irreducible polynomial on `Q`. Returns `P(a)` with `a` the greatest root of `Q`.


For example,

```
sage: giac.simplify((exp(2*i*pi/3)+exp(2*i*pi/15))^3)
((-768*i)*(-1)^(2/15)*sqrt(3)-768*(-1)^(2/15)+768*i*(-1)^(4/15)*sqrt(3)-768*(-1)^(4/15)+rootof([[16-16*i,-16+16*i,-400+528*i,144+240*i],[1,0,-30,-40,5]]))/512
```

This seems different from #22024.

fyi, This still shows up in 8.9
