I thought that sage-brial depends on `sage.libs.polybori` but that may not be the case. It imports `sage.all` and specifically `sage.rings.polynomial.pbori` and that's the only sage specific bits it imports.

`sage.rings.polynomial.pbori` itself relies on `sage.libs.polybori` (through `sage.libs.polybori.decl`) and both need the C++ brial library.

Does that answer your question?

In Sage 9.3 I would hope to be able to create a separate distribution (distutils package) `sage-brial`, which would then package `sage.rings.polynomial.{brial,pbori}`, `sage.libs.polybori`, `sage.libs.fes`, `sage.crypto.boolean_function` -- everything that has a compile-time dependency on `libbrial`.

This is not ready for review. I am just pushing my work in progress so it is not just on my workstation, it is visible and open to others contribution.

There is a lot to do:
1. update paths
2. convert docstrings and tests to sage framework

This may take some time and I doubt it will be ready in time for 9.2 but we can only try.

More joy! I found a subtle coding error while fixing the test suite. I guess it won't have an impact on the rest of sage because that code path just error-ed out when taken. So it is probably a dead code path anyway.

Indeed, this is a known problem that needs some attention: #21892, #24748, possibly #27019, #23310, #23312, possibly #23311, #15223.

My idea is to scrap `BooleanPolynomialRing_constructor` and just have `BooleanPolynomialRing` be a `UniqueRepresentation` object, possibly just being a subclass of the monoid algebra parent.
