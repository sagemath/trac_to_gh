# Issue 19895: add symbolic domains posint, crational

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20132

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2016-02-28 08:05:32

Keywords: assumptions, domain

While Maxima does not know about these domains in its assumption framework they can be emulated by giving the combined assumptions `("integer", ...>0)`, `("complex", "rational")`. This ticket should then also check with `is_abc...()` that Pynac understands them as well.

The posint Pynac logic is in pynac-0.6.4, it needs to be complemented with recognition of the keyword in `SR.var` and `assume`.
