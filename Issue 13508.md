From [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1985/unexpected-result-for-the-sum-of-a-series):


```
sage: n = var('n')
sage: sum(1/((2*n-1)^2*(2*n+1)^2*(2*n+3)^2), n, 0, oo)
3/256*pi^2 - 1/32
```


The correct answer is `3/256*pi^2`.

We should report this to maxima:


```
(%i10) load(simplify_sum);
(%o10) /tmpbig/burcin/sage-5.4/local/share/maxima/5.26.0/share/contrib/solve_r\
ec/simplify_sum.mac
(%i11) simplify_sum(sum(1/((2*n-1)^2*(2*n+1)^2*(2*n+3)^2), n, 0, inf));

                                          2
                                       %pi
                                   2   ---- - 4
                                %pi     2
(%o11)                          ---- + --------
                                128      128
```

I can confirm this is true in Maxima 5.28.0 as well.  This is now [Maxima artifact 3587514](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3587514&group_id=4933&atid=104933).

Fixed in Maxima 5.30.0: #13973.

Should add doctest.

After #13973:

```
sage: n = var('n')
sage: sum(1/((2*n-1)^2*(2*n+1)^2*(2*n+3)^2), n, 0, oo)
3/256*pi^2
```

Done (at least in someplace where I think it's natural...)

This is not a useful commit, unfortunately, because this depends on #13973 which isn't in 6.3.beta2, as far as I can tell.  I just wasted a lot of time discovering this, and I don't have enough git prowess to figure out how to "merge" this into that ticket's tree.

`git merge trac u/pbruin/13973-maxima_update` or whatever your remote for trac is (the other likely one is `origin`).

Apparently my remote is indeed `trac` but this command doesn't work, nor do I have any idea what the branch is since that ticket seems to have a branch called "a130eed".

Okay, the following sequence worked:

```
$ git fetch trac refs/heads/u/pbruin/13973-maxima_update:refs/remotes/trac/u/pbruin/13973-maxima_update
$ git merge trac/u/pbruin/13973-maxima_update
```

This is so frustrating compared to the old system.

Ack sorry, I meant `git pull trac u/pbruin/13973-maxima_update` (which, in effect, combines those two) (also in case you are unaware, you can also delete the temp branch by `git branch -D name/of/branch`).

Okay, **finally** I got it all working and positive review!

Thanks. Sorry about mixing my git commands up!
