It looks like the cayley_graph of finitely presented group is broken in Sage 6.7.

For example, cayley_graph of Klein group returns a graph with 14 vertices:


```
sage: groups.presentation.KleinFour().cayley_graph()                                                                                    
Digraph on 14 vertices
```


On the other hand in Sage 6.6 one gets the correct graph with 4 vertices:


```
sage: groups.presentation.KleinFour().cayley_graph()
Launched png viewer for Digraph on 4 vertices
```

Your problem does not come from `cayley_graph` but from the presentation group itself:


```
sage: g=groups.presentation.KleinFour()
sage: a,b=g.generators()
sage: a**2 == a**4
True
sage: hash(a**2) == hash(a**4)
False
```


Example:

```
sage: {a**2:2,a**4:5}
{a^4: 5, a^2: 2}
```

As I do not know how to fix this problem, I advise you to open a new ticket with a more exact title or to ask on sage-devel. Otherwise, it is likely that none of those who know how to fix that will notice.

Yes, it indeed comes from the group itself. Somehow the rules obeyed by the group elements are not taken into account (automatically) and `cayley_graph` then creates new vertices.

One can get the unique representation of the group element in the following way:


```
sage: G=groups.presentation.KleinFour()
sage: a,b=G.generators()
sage: rs=G.rewriting_system()
sage: rs.make_confluent()
sage: rs.reduce(a^(-1))
a
sage: a^(-1)
a^-1
```


One way to fix this in `cayley_graph` would be to simplify/reduce the products of group elements before adding them to the graph.

> One way to fix this in `cayley_graph` would be to simplify/reduce the products of group elements before adding them to the graph.

That would be a way to fix your code, but if we did that we would knowingly *not* fix the real bug, i.e. the hashing problem. The code of `cayley_graph` does nto seem wrong to me: the problem is with the group elements which do not respect a standard.

You should write to sage-devel about this: not about the `cayley_graph` problem, but about the hashing problem. "Two equal elements should always have the same hash", and this is not satisfied here.

`@`ncohen: I see. Vincent pointed me to ticket #16059, which seems to solve a similar problem for a different group. I will try to figure this out.
