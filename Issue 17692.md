Here is a commit correcting just a few details in the doc of the added modules.

Why did not you add `discrete_valuation` and `poor_man_map` ?

I meant to; I guess I must have forgotten to save my changes at some point, or something like that.

Edit: fixed, untested.

Sorry, I thought the pdf reference manual was more or less abandoned. Thanks for the notice.

The point of the pdf reference is of course not to print it out but to ensure that the markup is valid (so you don't end up with broken mathjax warning when you look at it in the browser).
