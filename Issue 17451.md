Marc have you checked that arb is passing its own test suite (spkg-check)? I am fairly sure it won't because there is no release of flint2 with the right function for the testsuite not to fail. You would need a git checkout or someone making a new release of flint.

I have decided to make an ebuild of arb for gentoo (in the sage-on-gentoo overlay) and I got this when running "make check"

```

```

No stable release of flint has fmpq_dedekind_sum in flint 2.4.4 as shipped with sage. It is still arith_dedekind_sum. And of course that's were it stopped, there could be more.

No, I haven't. I usually don't do touch spkgs and I didn't think it was relevant. Feel free to set the ticket back to `needs_work`, or set its milestone to `pending` depending what you think is appropriate. Thanks for the comment!

I feel compelled to put it back to "needs_work" which is almost certainly what Volker would do especially if he reads my comments. Te merge window for non-critical stuff in 6.5 is closed anyway so it is a matter for the next release.
