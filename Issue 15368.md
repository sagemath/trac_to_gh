Likely a duplicate, but I couldn't find it elsewhere...

Of course, this is inconsistent with virtually all interpretations and conversions of symbolic expressions...

It is indeed a known issue since at least [this ask answer](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/10063/get-variants-of-complex-cube-root/?answer=14842#post-id-14842), and i use this example in my presentations about Sage and the need to define objects within a reliable parent. 

I did not report that on trac because this is somehow a feature of the symbolic ring : no semantics. I remember a discussion with you at sd49 (Orsay) about that precise example and the benefits (or not!) of having such kind of symbolic expressions that are able to make all kind of simplifications/derivatives/evaluations without context.

If one want to have something that both:
- applies rules such as `a^(bc) = (a<sup>b)</sup>c` systematically,
- takes principal branches of multi-valued complex function when evaluating,
then we should accept that kind of behaviour.

It would however be awesome to have a well-designed object to work with holomorphic functions, along the same lines that what is done with polynomials, i guess it is a very hard task, and i do not know whether there exists libraries for that.

I think that with `bc` numeric (and it only makes sense to me if rational) and `a` negative the rule `a^(bc) = (a<sup>b)</sup>c` should not be applied simply because then `a^b` loses information. With symbolic exponent the user will probaby expect simplification.

I agree in part only. Sure, general symbolic expressions have very weak semantics—essentially, I view them as straight-line programs that are just required to evaluate to what you'd expect when you assign values to free variables. Many *operations* on symbolic expressions, however, only make sense with stronger assumptions on the expressions. Typically, simplifications are supposed to transform these ”programs“ into ”equivalent“ ones, but of course whether two ”programs“ are equivalent depends on what the variables can represent.

The sensible thing to do IMO is to view all variables as complex by default, and require simplifications to be valid for arbitrary complex values of all variables (or more accurately, for a generic choice of complex values: for example, we probably do want `x/x` to simplify to `1`). At least what's what Maple does, and Maple arguably has the best implementation of ”general symbolic expressions” over there.

We'll still get nonsense in many cases when trying to simplify expressions containing constants from finite fields or other parents that do not fit well into this model, but I don't know how to avoid that. (Something that may be worth trying would be to define new symbolic ”rings“ parametrized by a parent. For instance, in `SR(QQ)`, all variables would be assumed to represent elements of `QQ`, constants would automatically be coerced into `QQ`, and arithmetic operations between constants would take place there. But that's not how the existing `SR` works.)

> If one want to have something that both:

I don't think we want that. IMO this rule should be applied only if either assumptions on `a`, `b`, `c` make it safe (e.g., `c` is known to be an integer) or the user explicitely asked for it. Of course, safe simplification routines are more cumbersome to use. To mitigate the issue, Maple's `simplify` accepts an option (`symbolic`) that tells it to disregard all analytical issues related to multivalued functions and just take any branch it likes. Something like that would be convenient in Sage as well.

Just to give some concrete motivations, in #16222 (and #17516) we need a rather small subsets of symbolic expressions that modelize (some) algebraic numbers. Namely:
- no variable
- rational coefficients
- I
- exp(2*I*pi*a), cos(2*pi*a), sin(2*pi*a) with a rational
- rational powers
- taking real and imaginary parts

An example of such expression is

```
((cos(pi/7) + (-1)^(1/3))^(2/3)).real()
```


Do you think this must be out of the symbolic ring?

Here is one problem with using the symbolic ring for constants:

```
sage: 0.1 * cos(pi/13)
0.100000000000000*cos(1/13*pi)
```

The answer should be a floating point real number!

Back to the original issue. The actual problem is in the Pynac logic for powers where usually the Python / Cython code for `Rational.rational_power_parts` is called and used. Apparently to speed things up this is only called if a numeric computation does not return a rational (which does not work as expected).

However, we cannot just say always use `rational_power_parts` because that is wrong too,

```
sage: from sage.rings.rational import rational_power_parts
sage: rational_power_parts(-1,1/3)
(1, -1)
sage: rational_power_parts(-1,2/3)
(1, 1)
sage: [rational_power_parts(-1, i/77) for i in range(9)]
[(1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
```


i.e. both wrong results in the following are from independent bugs:

```
sage: SR(-1)^(2/3)
1
sage: QQ(-1)^(2/3)
1
```
