This patch does a couple of things:

1. Fix the `change_labels` bug above.

2. Add a left/right summand/factor method to sum and product species.

3. Make the `labels` method return all of the labels rather than just the ones that appear.  This is a backwards incompatible change, but I am pretty sure that there isn't really any code out there that depends on this.

4. Add a `labels_subset` method to do what the old `labels` methods did for subsets.

5. Add additional documentation to some of the classes.

Looks OK.  It might make sense to add a docstring to `change_labels` in 

```
composition_species.py:69:    def change_labels(self, labels):
partition_species.py:112:    def change_labels(self, labels):
product_species.py:119:    def change_labels(self, labels):
structure.py:125:    def change_labels(self, labels):
structure.py:267:    def change_labels(self, labels):
```


I suggest:


```
Returns a relabelled structure.

INPUT:

- ``labels``, a list of labels.

OUTPUT:

A structure with the i-th label of self replaced with the i-th label of the list.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: C = species.CycleSpecies(3)
    sage: ls1 = C.structures([1,2,3]); ls2 = C.structures(["a", "b", "c"])
    sage: s = s1[0].change_labels(["b", "c", "a"]); t = s2[0]; (s,t,s==t)
    (('b', 'c', 'a'), ('a', 'b', 'c'), False)
    sage: s = s1[0].change_labels(["a", "b", "c"]); t = s2[0]; (s,t,s==t)
    (('a', 'b', 'c'), ('a', 'b', 'c'), True)
