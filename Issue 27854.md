Trying to compile `example.tex` : LaTeX passes well, but :

```
sage example.sagetex.sage 
  File "example.sagetex.sage.py", line 433
    except ValueError, ZeroDivisonError:
                     ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```


Python3 seems to need 

```
    except (ValueEror, ZeroDivisionError):
```


The problem lies in `example.tex` : fixing it in the source code for the Gnuplot example allows for compilation.
