Hello and welcome to Sagemath.

I have some comments on your patch:

- `Returns the Golomb graph.` -> `Return the Golomb graph.`

- Instead of putting a lot of examples, you could add a text like: `The Golomb graph is a planar and Hamiltonian graph with 10 vertices and 18 edges. It has chromatic number 4, diameter 3, radius 2 and girth 3. It can be drawn in the plane as a unit distance graph.`

  Then you can keep the test showing that it's a unit distance graph.

- It might be better to refer to the wikipedia page like that:

```
-    For more information, see this
-    `MathWorld article on the Golomb graph <http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GolombGraph.html>`_.
+    See :wikipedia:`Golomb_graph` for more information.
```


- For the test for unit distance graph, I think this is equivalent and simpler

```
sage: dist2 = lambda u,v:(u[0]-v[0])**2 + (u[1]-v[1])**2
sage: all(dist2(pos[u], pos[v]) == 1 for u, v in G.edge_iterator(labels=None))
```


You will have to rebase your patch on last develop branch.

I did some corrections directly in your patch to be more efficient. You can push modifications to the new branch as it is in `public`.

What I did:
- use rational field `QQ` instead of defining `ratlit`
- move import of `sqrt` and `QQ` at the top of the file
- remove some trailing white spaces
- some [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) cleaning

If you agree with thoses changes, you can set this ticket to positive review on my behalf.

Your changes seem fine to me, I used ratlit(num, den) as I presumed it was faster than QQ('num/den'), but it is easier to read the QQ version. Thanks for editing the patch.
