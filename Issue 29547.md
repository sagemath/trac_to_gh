(from #29733)

Let the documentation, in particular
the developer walk-through at

- https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/walk_through.html

better reflect recent changes to the readme.

Mention that `make` takes very long.

Add discussion of `make build`.

Update Git instructions as discussed in

- https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/e9Nt_E4glkM/m/Lpmz_va_BAAJ

Thanks for the update! 

Maybe in `README.md`, replace

12. Type `make`.  That's it! Everything is automatic and
   non-interactive; but it will take a few hours (on a recent

```
by something like

I don't think one strictly needs to exclude the Windows git. I had no problems so far using it. Based on other discussions on similar points, I would propose to formulate it as a strong recommendation to use the Linux git, but the native Windows way should be described as well.

Here are some changes to the README
(all in a single commit, sorry).

As listed in the commit message:

- Adjust indentation
- Merge steps 2 and 3 for consistency since the Git version
  of step 2 already changed into the Sage directory
- Minor rephrasing, e.g.:
  - "to something not containing any non-alphanumeric characters"
    -> "to contain only alphanumeric characters"
  - "(a matching set of these three will avoid the compilation
    of Sage-specific compilers - unless they are too old)" ->
    "(a recent enough matching set of these three will avoid
    building Sage-specific compilers)."
- Update required disk space to "at least 10 GB" (rather than 6)
- Spell out some abbreviations (OSS license -> software license;
  NFS -> network file system; cd -> change directory)
- Add `--tags` to `git clone`
- Fix minor punctuation inconsistencies (use `-` for all lists
  instead of sometimes `*`, comma after opensuse, period after `bc`)
- Expand the "try it out" item to suggest some things to try
- Suggest bookmarking the local documentation in your browser
- Add link to online list of Sage packages
- Add optional step to add symlink to `sage` in `/usr/local/bin`
