As far as I can tell this builds fine.  I think at the time this `spkg-install` was written Cygwin-64 just wasn't supported yet.

I don't know whether or not there are any specific runtime issues with this.  I don't have any reason to believe there are but I've still barely begun to crack into the failing tests on Cygwin.

Do we really need to hardcode the `ABI` value? Doesn't GMP auto-detect this?

Maybe at that time Cygwin64 was not officialy supported and some "*cygwin*" regexp forced 32 bits builds.
It might be the case things have changed...

No, I don't think it's necessary anymore.

In other words, I could update this patch to just remove that case entirely.

Branch pushed to git repo; I updated commit sha1. This was a forced push. New commits:

Okay, I've confirmed manually setting `ABI` is not necessary at all for 64-bit builds (or likely not 32 for that matter).  So I redid the branch to just remove the case for Cygwin entirely.
