# Issue 14874: Segmentation fault and doctest failure in find_generators.py

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: itaibn

Original creation time: 2013-08-27 20:12:59

Keywords: segfault doctest

The following test fails with one of the tests getting segmentation fault:

```
$ sage -t --long sage/modular
```

The error message can come in two forms. I am attaching both. The error can be created more directly by:

```
sage: ModularFormsRing(Gamma0(3)).modular_forms_of_weight(80).cuspidal_submodule().q_expansion_basis()
```

I tried this again in a build of Sage 6.1.1 also compiled from source and it doesn't replicate. I'm hesitant about closing the ticket without know what caused the error in the first place, but the doctest is still there and so if it reappears someone will notice. It might have been a rare random error during compiling.
