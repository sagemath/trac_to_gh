zenodo guesses the authors from the github commit data, and has a cutoff in the number of authors. The way to adjust this is to have 
`.zenodo.json` file, cf e.g. https://github.com/zenodo/zenodo/issues/1421

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30737

currently it is https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/repository/sagemath/sage#490dca58-642d-465a-876a-9d6272672b76-metadata
and I propose

I don't know how much of the data should be in, i.e. would zenodo fill in e.g. version if we omit it in json.
