zenodo guesses the authors from the github commit data, and has a cutoff in the number of authors. The way to adjust this is to have 
`.zenodo.json` file, cf e.g. https://github.com/zenodo/zenodo/issues/1421

marking critical to have in 9.2 - this data is hard   to adjust after the release.

currently it is https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/repository/sagemath/sage#490dca58-642d-465a-876a-9d6272672b76-metadata
and I propose

```
{
    "description": "Mirror of the Sage https://sagemath.org/ source tree", 
    "license": "other-open", 
    "title": "sagemath/sage: 9.1", 
    "version": "9.1", 
    "upload_type": "software", 
    "publication_date": "2020-06-24", 
    "creators": [
        {
            "affiliation": "SageMath.org", 
            "name": "The SageMath Developers"
        }
    ], 
    "access_right": "open", 
    "related_identifiers": [
        {
            "scheme": "url", 
            "identifier": "https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/9.1", 
            "relation": "isSupplementTo"
        }, 
        {
            "scheme": "doi", 
            "identifier": "10.5281/zenodo.593563", 
            "relation": "isVersionOf"
        }
    ]
}
```


I don't know how much of the data should be in, i.e. would zenodo fill in e.g. version if we omit it in json.

it appears that the data should be complete, so we'd need a template where the version and the date are filled in (by `sage-update-version`)

I looked at the commits. This is a good idea and matches what zenodo says about adding such a hidden file to the repository tree.
