# Issue 12770: Balaban's 10-Cage

This patch adds one graph constructor and an interesting embedding for it. This one took a loooooooottt of sweat, but I'm learning a lot of tricks to create new embeddings :-)

Oh, and the patch also adds a helper method which I plan on using very often for other patches : it sets the position of some points so that they are on a circle of given center and radius.. This will *really* be useful for many embeddings `:-)`

Oh, thanks for reminding me to rebase my old Balaban 11-cage patch :)

Arg O_o

You wrote it already ? `:-D`

Well, anyway I learnt to fight with automorphism groups a bit.. I'm giving the 11cage a try right now `:-D`

Yup... as you can see, the patch looks very mysterious :P http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/keshav/files/trac_9136-balaban-11-cage.patch

I think I will use your helper function instead, and maybe extend it so that it doesn't only do evenly spaced points around the circle... (maybe allow for some None elements of the list of points, for example)

That patch applies to Sage 4.7.1.rc1 by the way :D

I see `:-D`

by the way : you can actually space points differently with this patch. That's more or less what I did in the embedding : you create two cicles with different shifts `:-)`

Well, perhaps the _circle thing will have to be modified too.. 

And GOD, the 11cage is really something `O_o`

No, I mean, to put points on a circle but not evenly spaced. Maybe three points clustered near the top of the circle, three near the bottom, three near the left, and three near the right, for example. So then you would pass `[v1, v2, v3, None, None, None, v4, v5, v6, None, None, None, v7, v8, v9, None, None, None, v10, v11, v12, None, None, None]` with `shift=-1.5`, or something like that.

Well, this you can do ! The points v1, v4, v7, and v10 are evenly spaced ! And the same for v2, v5, v8, v11. That's what happens to the point from the "inner layer" in my patch's embedding. Some vertices are "clones" of each other, and I made them closer so that this appears in the drawing `:-)`

Err, you're right :) But the less symmetry there is, the more calls you will need to that function... then again, if there's so little symmetry, why even use a circular embedding? :P

I'll test and review this patch once I finish doctesting my rebase of #12533.

Passes all doctests! I added a reviewer patch which wraps docstrings to 72 columns per PEP 8, and makes a few minor changes. I also changed the name of the graph to "the Balaban 10-cage" instead of "Balaban's 10-cage" (because of how it's named on Wikipedia). Is there a reason to have it as "Balaban's 10-cage"?

Hey patchbot: apply trac_12942.patch and then trac_12942.reviewer.patch .

(Will that work?)

ncohen: if you agree to the name change, I'll give this positive review, otherwise I'll revert the name change and then give it positive review. Thanks for making this helper function in particular! :)

No prob with this at all ! But the max width for the lines is 80, so mine were not too long `:-)`

Good to go !

Well, PEP 8 prescribes 79 columns for code and recommends 72 for documentation... http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length And we supposedly follow PEP 8 in Sage. So that's why I wrapped the docstrings to 72.

Positive review!

`O_O`

My GOD. You will have to become a lawyer to send Sage patches very soon `:-D`

They're mad guys `O_O`

Nathann: Not to send Sage patches, only to review them :P
