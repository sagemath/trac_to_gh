Thanks!  I am planning a pause now; the last batch of 10000 conductors took 7 weeks anyway.

There was when I left it for review!  Where can it have gone?  It was called u/cremona/ticket/16336 if I recall.  Also, I assume tha Jeroen actually used the branch I uploaded...

Maybe not.

I simply did

```
./sage -dev checkout --ticket 16336
```

which makes a new branch if the Trac ticket has no branch.

I put it back.  Perhaps I got the branch name mixed up, it really is u/cremona/trac/16336 .

JUst notices this had the fatal tag "needs work".  I am putting it back to "needs review" but if the branch has not disappeared I think anyone can switch it back to "positive review".
