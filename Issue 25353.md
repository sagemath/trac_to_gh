I'm fine with almost all of the changes. After compiling and looking through the graph generators doc page, I noticed that the folded cube graph, the johnson graph, the turan graph, and line graph forbidden subgraph all have some non-standard formatting for their wikipedia links, and might as well be touched up.

It should be 'Return the Tutte 12-cage', not 'Return the Tutte's 12-cage'.

Wikipedia pages for sousselier graph and wiener-araya graph should to be reverted to have the non-standard formatting, since :wikipedia: defaults to the english version of the site (at least for me), and those articles only exist in the french version.

Thank you for your help. I have implemented all your remarks.

I noticed issues with wikipedia links in `classical_geometries.py` as well, but I prefer to implement them in a different ticket to avoid touching too many files at once (and so conflicts). All files have to be cleaned...

Merge conflict

I just tried with the current beta0 and I don't have merge conflict.
Is there a conflict with another ticket that you want to add to the next beta ?

It's quite hard to fix without knowing where the problem comes from. So the best is certainly to way and see for the next beta...

I rebased the ticket on 8.4.beta1 and fix merged conflict. I hope I did it the right way...
