The web page http://wiki.sagemath.org/SageDays is not coherent with
http://wiki.sagemath.org/MyStartingPage#sagedays: the former only
mentions SD24 in the upcoming events, and mentions the out-dated
`Sage Days ?? -- Cambridge, MA (dates TBA, but sometime in fall 2009)`
whereas the later mentions up to SD26, and points to yet another
page http://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops!

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/8384

Anybody who maintains the Workshops wiki page? It was copied 2009-09-28 from another page by qed777 and the sage days page was never updated again. We can place a link on the SageDays page pointing to Workshops. Other ideas? It would be good to create a dedicated wiki category (called workshops or sagedays) and then the overview page is generated automatically.

Agreed that things are still a little incoherent, but now http://wiki.sagemath.org/MyStartingPage#sagedays does look good, and http://wiki.sagemath.org/SageDays, though weird, has a link to the authoritative http://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops.  I recommend this ticket be closed.  

In general I'm not sure Trac is the best place to discuss content problems (as opposed to programming problems) on the Wiki, since it's rather independent of the Sage code base.

To release manager - mind closing this?

Still the case.  We could in theory get rid of the SageDays one, but probably it's better to leave it, as it is nowhere linked from the start page and may have some useful data on it.  It is clear on that page that it is superseded.
