Just a question: do you build R on Cygwin? I ask because R needs PCRE and a broken PCRE might yield a broken R. This is how we found out about the PCRE issues on Solaris.

Or maybe only specific parts of PCRE are broken that are not used by R on Cygwin.

I don't know--there's like one test for PCRE that fails but I haven't looked into it.  The full tests for R have never passed on Cygwin either; see #22866.  But I'll run them again to see if any of them are "obviously" regexp related (I'd be surprised).

I'd certainly like to address #22866 but it's low priority short of actual bug reports from users (and I don't think many people are installing Sage in order to use R on Windows...)

On Solaris, even the _build_ of R fails with the broken PCRE. So it seems that the Cygwin problem is not that severe.

The only thing that I'm missing in this branch is a comment saying that we don't run the testsuite on Cygwin because it fails always in a way which doesn't seem to affect other packages. positive review if you add that.

I think the additional comment is mostly superfluous since there's already a link to the original ticket, which could also be updated with a note about this. But I don't object.
