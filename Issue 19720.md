Hi! I really like the idea of this ticket; graphic comparison is quite useful. Quick remarks:

- should there be a keyword `scaled=True` with which the division by the error term can be controlled?
- would it make sense to be able to compare against expansions without error term?
- what do you think of a `PLOTS::`-section for the documentation?

if there is no error term, then there is no need to rescale nor plot,
`all( ... for ...)` should do the trick in that case.

Within a finite amount of time, I could not get it to work. In any case, this is distinct from doctesting; thus one would have to repeat all commands to generate the plot. Sage preparsing apparently does not work here. Then I got a strange error message.

For doctests, I rather think that we might want to output the list itself instead of the list plot, perhaps already piped through `RIF` or something like that. That would make useful doctests (and could be used throughout the modules during review phases). Thus there could be a flag `return_list=True` or something like that (or a separate method computing the list which could be used in this method here ...).

Plot the relative and the absolute error, respectively. Sometimes I like to look at both.

I couldn't get it to work either: some strange error regarding coercion of a function to `SR` occurrs...

> For doctests, I rather think that we might want to output the list itself instead of the list plot, perhaps already piped through `RIF` or something like that. That would make useful doctests (and could be used throughout the modules during review phases). Thus there could be a flag `return_list=True` or something like that (or a separate method computing the list which could be used in this method here ...).

I've implemented parts of this: there are now two methods; one for computing the list of differences and one for actually plotting. Also, for the sake of convenience, I've added the option to input a symbolic expression containing at most one variable.

Regarding the output: while I'd really like to have RIFs in the output of the difference method, unfortunately this causes problems for `list_plot`, e.g. try

```
sage: list_plot([(k, RIF(sqrt(k))) for k in srange(10)])
```

If the difference should lie in a RIF, the list would have to be processed again before plotting.

Opinions?

Typo. Fixed.

I've added a more sophisticated doctest.

Done. The check currently is for a relative diameter of less than `0.025`, which seems like a somewhat practical choice (the example with the harmonic numbers then works up to `n \approx 500`).

Done.
