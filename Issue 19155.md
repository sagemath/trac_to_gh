> * First line of doc should be a single sentence. So I would make the first line be "Returns the tetrahedral poset based on the input colors."

Actually "return", not "returns". And there is a missing space before it. (I.e. an indentation of 3 spaces instead of 4.)

Looks good. A few comments on the doc: 

In the second sentence, the color 'yellow' is missing.

Add 'For example,' to the start of the fourth sentence.

The fourth, fifth, and sixth sentences need periods at the end.

Under `INPUT:`, you should have ```False``` instead of just `False`.

Try making it "totally self-complementary plane partitons in a ``2n \times 2n \times 2n`` box".

Description for optional parameter `int_label` should be more explicit in saying which boolean value gives which labeling.

Just two more minor things

* Add `TetrahedralPoset` to the index of methods at the top of the file.

* I would put `labelcount=0` immediately before (and at the same indentation as) `for (i,j,k) in elem:`. No point in initializing `labelcount` until you've checked to see that it's going to be used.
