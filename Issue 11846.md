As the summary says.  The script sage-list-packages writes a temporary file to

```
file = "%s/tmp/list"%SAGE_ROOT
```
This should use a temporary file instead.

In your patch, I appreciate the use of os.path.join for local paths, but is this the right thing to do for urls? If the local system has some funny path separator, the url may be misformed.
