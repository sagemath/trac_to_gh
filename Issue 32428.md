# Issue 32428: Deprecate is_SymbolicEquation, is_CallableSymbolicExpression, is_SymbolicVariable

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32665

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2021-10-10 19:34:00

CC:  tscrim mjo @kliem

As a follow-up on #32638, which deprecated `is_Expression`, we deprecate `is_SymbolicEquation`, `is_CallableSymbolicExpression`, `is_SymbolicVariable`. We replace uses by `isinstance(x, Expression)` and a method call (may need a new method `is_callable`).

This is part of meta-ticket #32414.

If this is fully ready for review (just checking relative to comment:7), then you can set a positive review.
