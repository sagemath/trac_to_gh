# Issue 3851: [with patch, needs review] Steenrod algebra doctest patch: small coercion issue with 3.1alpha

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2008-08-14 16:48:42

Assignee: tbd

Keywords: algebra, steenrod, coercion

I think because of #3744, there was a doctesting error in steenrod_algebra_element.  This patch fixes it (and changes an explanatory sentence, as well).

Patch looks good to me and fixes the doctest issue for me.

Cheers,
