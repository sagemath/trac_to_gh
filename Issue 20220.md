CC:  roed kedlaya

Keywords: padics, teichmuller, residue field

The following does not currently work:

```
sage: F.<a> = Qq(5^2,10)
sage: F.teichmuller_system()
```


I propose an easy patch that fixes this, although the long-term solution would be to fix the method lift() for elements in F.residue_field().

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20457
