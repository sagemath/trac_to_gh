# Issue 20220: Fix teichmuller_system method for p-adic extension

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: mmasdeu

Original creation time: 2016-04-18 13:39:22

CC:  roed kedlaya

Keywords: padics, teichmuller, residue field

The following does not currently work:

```
sage: F.<a> = Qq(5^2,10)
sage: F.teichmuller_system()
```


I propose an easy patch that fixes this, although the long-term solution would be to fix the method lift() for elements in F.residue_field().
