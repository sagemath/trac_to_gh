I guess this is because of the PIP stuff which got added in #19213. I see no easy fix... the only possibility is removing the use of PIP in `is_package_installed`.

IMHO `installed` (or some related variable) should be a dictionary mapping just "base" package names to {`True`, `False`}, i.e., a `set()`.

Then `is_package_installed()` could just `return package in WHATEVER` (unless also `update=True` was passed, or the variable is yet `None`).

The package versions could be recorded in *separate* dictionaries.

Replying to [comment:16 jdemeyer]:

There's also a colon missing after `default`.

\\

Isn't the description of `exclude_pip` in `list_packages()` as wrong as that of `local`?

If the former is `True` (**not** `False`), PIP packages are excluded (not considered), or keep the `False`, and remove the "not" in *"then [also] pip packages are not considered."*.

Similar for the latter (`local`):  Either change `False` to `True`, or remove the "not".

The *"**than** no error is raised"* is still in.

`src/sage_setup/optional_extension.py` uses `list_packages()` (which currently has `exclude_pip=False` as default); should we "fix" the former, too, and if so, here?

In principle, any pip-related function here should first check whether `is_package_installed("pip")`... ;-)

No, you just made it worse... ;-)

I only meant replace the misspelled *"than"* by *"then"*.

Now the *"than"* is still in, and the description is wrong, as `ignore_URLError=True` of course means **don't** raise an exception but simply return `None` on errors, but you turned the *"no error"* into *"an error"* and added another logically wrong sentence.

I'll push a branch with the fixes *later* if you don't have the time.

It's still a blocker ticket...

So I've fixed more docstrings on top of your changes.

Either check out my branch `u/leif/21291`, or simply set the ticket to positive review.

For beta4, it's unfortunately meanwhile too late.
