CC:  fbissey embray thansen infinity0 isuruf mkoeppe

this is a relatively stable C library, the only problem is that there are also very old versions (2.2.0 on Fedora 26) around, and it's not quite clear whether they work and how to distinguish them.

(one way to distinguish is to test for macro gp_IsArc - present in old 2.2.0 headers, but then gone)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29063

2.2.0 prevents sagelib building, as `planarity/graphStructures.h` should have

```
typedef struct
{
        int  link[2];
        int  index;
        unsigned flags;
} vertexRec;
```

and not

```
typedef struct
{
        int DFSParent, leastAncestor, Lowpoint, adjacentTo;
        int pertinentBicompList, separatedDFSChildList, fwdArcList;
} vertexRec;
```


So we can write a test using `AC_COMPILE_IFELSE()`.
