Since #32744, Sage has a specialized class `EllipticCurveHom_composite` for composite elliptic-curve isogenies which is designed to behave the same as other, non-factored isogenies.

In this patch, we change the default composition for `EllipticCurveHom` instances from generic formal composite morphisms to the specialized implementation.
