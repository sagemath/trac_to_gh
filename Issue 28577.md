Keywords: mathematica conversions

Exploration of a problem reported in an [ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/48908/how-to-avoid-scientific-notation-of-numbers-in-the-mathematica-interface/).

The conversion of large or small floating point constants (needing scientific notation) to mathematica is incorrect:

```
# Reference
sage: 3.5.log().n()
1.25276296849537
# This works
sage: mathematica.N(mathematica.Log(3.5)).sage()
1.252762968495368
# Scale up works in Sage:
sage: 3.5e6.log().n()
15.0682735264596
# Doesn't work when translated to to mathematica
sage: mathematica.N(mathematica.Log(3.5e6)).sage()
log(3.5*e6)
# Possible cause : confusion with SR
sage: mathematica.N(mathematica.Log(3.5e6)).sage().parent()
Symbolic Ring
# Ditto for small values. OK in Sage
sage: sin(1e-8).n()
1.00000000000000e-8
# Fails when converted to mathematica:
sage: mathematica.N(mathematica.Sin(1e-8)).sage()
-1.0*sin(-1.0*e + 8.0)
# Same possible cause
sage: mathematica.N(mathematica.Sin(1e-8)).sage().parent()
Symbolic Ring
```


The reverse conversion (Mathematica --> Sage) works...

```
sage: mathematica.N(mathematica.Exp(500))
1.4035922178528375*^217
sage: mathematica.N(mathematica.Exp(500)).sage()
1.4035922178528375e+217
sage: mathematica.N(mathematica.Exp(-500))
7.124576406741286*^-218
sage: mathematica.N(mathematica.Exp(-500)).sage()
7.124576406741286e-218
```


...as long as Sage is able to express it:

```
sage: mathematica.N(mathematica.Exp(1000))
1.970071114017*^434
sage: mathematica.N(mathematica.Exp(1000)).sage()
+infinity
sage: mathematica.N(mathematica.Exp(-1000))
5.0759588975495*^-435
sage: mathematica.N(mathematica.Exp(-1000)).sage()
0.0
```


The latter quantities over/underflow the default Sage floating point systems...

Another workaround to avoid scientific notation:

```
sage: mathematica.Log(3.5e6.str(no_sci=2)).sage()
15.068273526459642

The overflows might be difficult to avoid since that is a problem of `SR`, and the symbolic ring is the closest thing in Sage that Mathematica expressions can convert to.

Indeed. That's a consequence of [IEE 754](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754). Do we need Mathematica's large-absolute-magnitude floats ?

Actually I was wrong about `SR` – it does support arbitrary precision floating point numbers. The conversion from Mathematica to Sage treats them as elements of `RDF` before embedding them in `SR`, though. Here is a branch where they are converted to elements of `RealField` instead which automatically chooses a suitable precision.

Moreover, I implemented the conversions from Sage to Mathematica for elements of `RDF`, `CDF`, `RealField` and `ComplexField` in order to handle the scientific notation.

These changes have the potential for some numerical noise. The function `symbolic_expression_from_string` is also used by `SR` to create expressions from strings, so floating point numbers parsed from strings are now backed by `RealField` elements instead of `RDF`. This is also why some tests in sandpiles fail with the current branch.


```
sage: SR('.3333333333333333333333333333333333333')  # before: internally an element of RDF
0.3333333333333333
sage: SR('.3333333333333333333333333333333333333')  # after: now internally an element of RealField
0.333333333333333333333333333333333333
sage: SR(.3333333333333333333333333333333333333)    # unaffected by these changes
0.333333333333333333333333333333333333
```


Is it ok to change this? It seems desirable to preserve the precision here, but I am not sure if this might have other negative consequences.
