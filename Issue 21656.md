# Issue 21656: Properly initialize symbolic rings

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21893

Original creator: saraedum

Original creation time: 2016-11-18 01:22:54

Currently

```
sage: f(x) = 1
sage: TestSuite(f.parent()).run()
AttributeError
```


Also, some tests do not pass because the factory is not properly used:

```
sage: f.parent()._test_pickling()
AssertionError
```

The tests in `symbolic/` pass. Let's see what the patchbot thinks.

The commits should make sense one by one. The reviewer might want to review them individually.

Looks good once patchbot approves.
