Currently

```
sage: f(x) = 1
sage: TestSuite(f.parent()).run()
AttributeError
sage: 'sum' in dict(f.parent())
True
sage: f.parent().sum
AttributeError
```
This is because this symbolic ring does not call its super classes `__init__` and therefore it does not inherit correctly the methods of its category.

Also, some tests do not pass because the pickling provided by factory is not properly used:

```
sage: f.parent()._test_pickling()
AssertionError
```

The tests in `symbolic/` pass. Let's see what the patchbot thinks.

The commits should make sense one by one. The reviewer might want to review them individually.
