The signature of `Matrix_gfpn_dense.__init__` is different from the other matrix constructors. Fix this.

Simon: this is really part of #24742 but I made a separate ticket in case the particular `__init__` signature is somehow important to you.

No, the commonly used signature is fine for me.

So, would you be willing to give positive review (assuming that tests pass)?

Note that the `mutability` parameter is non-standard, but I actually like it.

I am not sure if I actually use that parameter, but if possible I'd prefer it to be preserved.

The patchbot complains about a non-ascii character. Apart from that, it would be positive review.

I don't think so. It looks like the patchbot plugin itself is generating a `UnicodeDecodeError`.

Note that the code of `Matrix_gfpn_dense.__init__` will change completely in #24742, but those should make no functional difference.
