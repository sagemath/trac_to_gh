Salut Marc ! I have doubts concerning the return type of this new function. First, I always wonder one should use Python's `set` or Sage's `Set`. But also I wonder whether these bases should be returned as sets: In all cases I've found (≠ all cases, probably), bases are returned as lists (or `PolynomialSequence_generic` for polynomials) and not sets. Wouldn't it be more consistent to return a list there too?

I propose you to return a `Sequence` with `universe=self`. 

Another (minor) point: If the elements in the sequence do not belong to `self`, the exception is not very clear. For instance:


```python
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: QQ.gcd_free_basis([x+1,x+2])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: not a constant polynomial
```


You may catch the exception and raise your own `TypeError: the elements you provided do not belong to QQ` (or something similar). Actually I ran into the exact example I paste above...

Apart from this remarks, this looks good to me!

Done.

I improved `Sequence()` itself instead. Of course, I can move the corresponding commits to another ticket if you don't feel like reviewing them.

A comment still on the `Sequence()` part: Should'nt the error message explicitly mention that there is a conflict with the universe? Something like 
`unable to convert {} to an element of the universe ({})".format(x[i], universe))`

Done (#20621).

I don't think so: when `Sequence()` is used internally by another function (e.g. in the present case), it will be clear that the function needs to somehow convert some elements to a given parent, but it doesn't matter that this parent is the universe of some Sequence (and that may even make the error more confusing to casual users)...
