A fix for a couple of doctest went missing from #33141.

Doctesting this file in is made more robust, and distro friendly by allowing and making `SAGE_DOC` to be a random temporary directory at the start of the doctesting of the file.

To allow `SAGE_DOC` to be set randomly for doctesting we cannot let it be imported globally in the whole file. Functions that uses it need to import it explicitly.

Would it be too clumsy to conditionally import `SAGE_DOC` at the top of the file if it is not yet defined? That would require the doctests to set the environment variable `SAGE_DOC` before importing from `sage_docbuild`, but at the moment there seems to be only one affected doctest (or at least `SAGE_DOC` is only defined in one testing block), while the current branch requires five new `from sage.env import SAGE_DOC` statements.

Now that I look at it with a bit of distance, there is one thing that could be interesting to try. Define `SAGE_DOC` in the doctest before the first import of `sage_docbuild` and see if that sticks.

Having thought about it more, I think it's too fragile to have doctests depend on whether `SAGE_DOC` is defined before the relevant `import` statements. Let's leave the branch as it is — I don't have any better ideas for how to fix this.

Tests pass on Sage built from scratch, and I trust that they fix problems, or at least don't cause any new ones, for distros.
