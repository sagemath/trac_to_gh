As reported on [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/31323/cannot-mulyiply-polynomial-by-matrix-when-ordering-is-explicitly-specified/?answer=31324#post-id-31324):


```
sage: F = GF(17)
sage: R.<x, y> = PolynomialRing(F)
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(F, 5, 4)
sage: cm = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()
sage: cm.explain(R,MS)
Action discovered.
    Left scalar multiplication by Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Finite Field of size 17 on Full MatrixSpace of 5 by 4 dense matrices over Finite Field of size 17
Result lives in Full MatrixSpace of 5 by 4 dense matrices over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Finite Field of size 17
Full MatrixSpace of 5 by 4 dense matrices over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Finite Field of size 17
```


but it does not work anymore if we specify the `'lex'` ordering for monomials of `R`:


```
sage: R.<x, y> = PolynomialRing(F, order='lex')
sage: cm.explain(R,MS)
Will try _r_action and _l_action
Unknown result parent.
```


However it works if we specify the `'degrevlex'` ordering for monomials of `R`:



```
sage: R.<x, y> = PolynomialRing(F, order='degrevlex')
sage: cm.explain(R,MS)
Action discovered.
    Left scalar multiplication by Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Finite Field of size 17 on Full MatrixSpace of 5 by 4 dense matrices over Finite Field of size 17
Result lives in Full MatrixSpace of 5 by 4 dense matrices over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Finite Field of size 17
Full MatrixSpace of 5 by 4 dense matrices over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Finite Field of size 17
```


And it works with the `'lex'` ordering for monomials of `R` if the matrix space is "square" (through a different path however):


```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(F, 5, 5)
sage: R.<x, y> = PolynomialRing(F, order='lex')
sage: cm.explain(R,MS)
