Let's get this in please.

Only the last 3 commits need review, the earlier ones are all from #33648.

It looks good to me, but maybe it is worth keeping a note regarding the non-github login that uses the legacy account, after deleting the following.

```
-**New:** Previously, it was necessary to manually request a Trac account in
-order to post anything to Sage's Trac.  Now, if you have a GitHub account, you
-may log in using it to create and comment on tickets, and edit wiki pages on
-Sage's Trac.
```

I deleted it because this information is also on the front page of Trac (https://trac.sagemath.org/#legacy-account-request).

I've just edited https://wiki.sagemath.org/#About_this_wiki to also be clearer about this.

The big problem with mentioning the legacy account requests is that no one actually tends to them. (I requested one in January for a special purpose and have not received a reply.)

I didn't make it clear. Actually I was wondering if you could add a note in the guide, saying that the first login button on the trac page is only for legacy account users; and that if the user had such an account, then the login instead of github-login is the right one to use.

(If I haven't used trac for a while and I got a new laptop that does not have my Username/Password cached, then I will be confused about the trac page's login/github-login, and I won't find the instruction in the new developer's guide.)
