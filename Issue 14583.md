Hey Ben,

Could you put some line breaks in the bullet point on lines 265, 267? Also could you (and/or coauthors) create more descriptive names for these statistics?

Thanks,

Travis

Changed .N() to .number_of_parts() and .M() to .sum_of_weighted_row_lengths().

Eliminated recursion from number_of_parts method.

The PDF documentation doesn't build:

```

l.128428 Return the value of $\mathscr
                                      {N}$ on \code{self}.

Hey Jeroen and Ben,

It seems like the pdf builder doesn't include the package(s) to support `\mathscr`, even though the html/mathjax does. Jeroen, could we include `mathrsfs` as part of the pdf build (possibly [also] `amsfonts`), or should we just change this to use `\mathcal` instead?

Thanks,

Travis

Replying to [comment:8 tscrim]:

If those packages are reasonably standard packages and included with most LaTeX distributions, then yes.

The mathrsfs package was added misc/latex.py.

I also had to add it to `doc/common/conf.py`.

This needs to be rebased to #14382.
