It turns out that 

```
sage: w = vector([x^2,3,x^3])
sage: plot(w,(x,0,1))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError     
```
I guess this makes sense, since it is parametric.  But this seems reasonable to implement.  

Far worse is 

```
    from sage.structure.element import is_Vector
    if kwds.get('parametric',False) and is_Vector(funcs):
        funcs = tuple(funcs)


    if hasattr(funcs, 'plot'):
        G = funcs.plot(*args, **original_opts)
    # if we are using the generic plotting method
    else:
```
Which means that plotting a numeric vector apparently doesn't go through its custom `.plot()` method.  ???

Anyway, we should figure out how to change this so that the vector plotting in 2 and 3 D is uniform in style.
