In algorithms for elliptic curves over finite fields, we often require a basis of the `n`-torsion for some integer `n`. Since `.abelian_group()` already exists, we can simply add a small method to `AdditiveAbelianGroupWrapper` to make the following syntax work:


```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(431^2), [1,0])
sage: E.abelian_group().torsion_subgroup(2^4).gens()
((316*z2 + 414 : 199*z2 + 106 : 1), (120 : 340*z2 + 261 : 1))
```

Two comments:

1. It would be good to also add the `n`-choice functionality to the `AbelianGroup_class.torsion_subgroup()`.
2. While it is slightly more complicated and redundant code, I might move the `if n is None` outside the `for` loop for speed.
