Keywords: Sphinx

The patch here implements

```
sage --docbuild file=/path/to/foo.py TYPE
```

where `TYPE` may be any of the standard documentation types (e.g., html or pdf). This lets you build the docs for a file inside or outside the Sage library. It doesn't work for .pyx files right now, but .py and .sage files seem to be fine.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13679

Well, it doesn't work for .pyx files, and I think that should be fixed before it's ready for review. When I wrote the original patch, I didn't spend a lot of time working on it, so there are probably other flaws as well. You can certainly test it out and report the results here.

Hi there,

The option does not appear within `sage -docbuild --help` but it should!

Another minor question: it is a bit annoying that the resulting file belongs to `$HOME/.sage/docbuild/output/$NAME_OF_THE_FILE/output/html`. Is it possible to do otherwise?

This is a really amazing gadget!

Vincent

I just discovered this gadget. Yeah! Finally! I have been dreaming of this for a while. Indeed, I write my course notes and work sheets in ReST, and my workflow to convert them to html is, err, painful.

I am just missing one feature: having it work on .rst files as well. Would it be hard?

Thanks!

You could check out the documentation for `sage -sws2rst` where it tells how to convert the rst files to actual documentation using Sphinx; maybe that will give you an idea of how to do it easily with this (it's been a while since I looked at it).
