This is due to the indexing convention of the simple roots.

Thanks for pointing this out -- I am totally annoyed by these issues! I will provide a solution by actually computing this matrix myself without any reference to the Cartan type.

Sounds quite reasonable.

Well, the disadvantage is that the outcome then is a plain matrix and not a `CoxeterMatrix`. But I am okay with this. What do you think?

I indeed should probably also relabel the Cartan type accordingly...

If you pass the data to `CoxeterMatrix`, it should recognize it as type B<sub>n</sub> under the different labeling IIRC.

Overall, LGTM, but the output of `coxeter_diagram` should be an immutable graph since it is cached. I would actually just build all of the data, then pass it in with the `immutable=True`, so

```python
        V = self.index_set()
        S = self.simple_reflections()
        E = []
        for i,j in combinations(V, 2):
            o = (S[i]*S[j]).order()
            if o >= 3:
                E.append((i,j,o))
        return Graph([V,E], format='vertices_and_edges', immutable=True)
```
