Looks fine to me, though I don't really know how "old style packages" are supposed to work.  Are none of them tested?

Doesn't really matter. The only thing this patch does is to keep whatever behaviour was there before.

> Are none of them tested?
Old-style packages are never tested, they are never automatically installed anyway.

Why old-style package should be deprecated? I thought that we wanted to support people own spkgs using this format...

More precisely: we should not have the list of packages hardcoded into Sage source (is it imposed by the "new-style"?)... there should be an alternative way to install things.

Old style is deprecated. There is `sage -pip` for an alternative way.

What about a package including C-libraries, databases or executables? As far as I understand, `sage -pip` is the alternative for python (possibly cython) libraries.
