# Issue 23783: Cygwin: misc test failures

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24020

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2017-10-12 12:46:05

A few tests have started failing on Cygwin, mostly since I had to take the Cygwin patchbot down:

 * `sage.env._add_variable_or_fallback` since #23758
 * `sage.misc.functional.log` since #19444 (due to a minor numerical difference I've observed before in `log(3.0)`).
 * `sage.symbolic.expression.Expression._eval_self` (I'm not sure yet where this one broke, but like the previous one it looks like a small numerical difference)

I will probably try to tackle these all at once since they all seem to be pretty small issues just in the tests, but if any become more significant I'll create a separate ticket.

Had to add dependency on #23979 since the tests can't even be run without.

These all make sense.
