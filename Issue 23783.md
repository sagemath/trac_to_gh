A few tests have started failing on Cygwin, mostly since I had to take the Cygwin patchbot down:

* `sage.env._add_variable_or_fallback` since #23758
* `sage.misc.functional.log` since #19444 (due to a minor numerical difference I've observed before in `log(3.0)`).
* `sage.symbolic.expression.Expression._eval_self` (I'm not sure yet where this one broke, but like the previous one it looks like a small numerical difference)

I will probably try to tackle these all at once since they all seem to be pretty small issues just in the tests, but if any become more significant I'll create a separate ticket.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24020
