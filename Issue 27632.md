As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

```

A reduced example of the error is as follows:


```
R.<a,b,c,d> = ZZ[]
Q = R.quotient(-b*c + a*d - 1)
Q.defining_ideal().is_maximal() # Raises a NotImplementedError
```


If we could correct this error, I still don't think the matrix code example will work, but this is a good start

It's also worth pointing out that the `is_maximal` function has a TODO (line 677 of rings/ideals.py):


```
.. TODO::

            This is not implemented for many rings.  Implement it!
```


It's obviously not implemented for this ring!

Enhancing quotients of multivariate polynomial ring is another problem. To make inversion works, one can for example compute the matrix of cofactors. And each minor can easily be done (via a division free algorithm).
