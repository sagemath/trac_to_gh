Does it make sense to compare Not a Number to number?

I get `False`, so the bug seems to be gone.  (Tested 9.1 on `CoCalc` and 9.2rc0 on MacOS 10.15.7.)  If `False` is the correct answer, then we should just add a doctest. But I don't know anything about numerics: should this be a `ValueError`?

Does anything need to be changed?  Should we add doctests?

There is ambiguity because they are of different type.

```
sage: type(oo)
<class 'sage.rings.infinity.PlusInfinity'>
sage: type(1./0)
<class 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber'>
```

I feel this is useful to be documented with the relevant cases.
