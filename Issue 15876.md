I think we should wait for an upstream answer.

Should be fixed by Cython 0.21, see #16912.

#16912 indeed fixes this during the Cythonizing phase, but the GCC phase which uses distutils (I guess?) still exhibits the same problem.

I see, you have a patch for `setup.py` also.

Do we need `maxtasksperchild=1` in the `Pool()` constructor?
