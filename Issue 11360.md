I just tried to create an account into the public sage notebook server using my launchpad OpenID login, https://launchpad.net/~gagern. The launchpad side of things seemed to work all right, but back to sage I got an internal server error for the page http://www.sagenb.org/openid_profiles. The page states that "More information is available in the server log" so please have a look at around 2011-06-22 08:35 UTC, see what you can find there.

Hi Martin, did you try posting on the sage-notebook mailing list? (On Google Groups.) Seems more likely to get attention there than here.
