    sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=((0, 0), (17,3))) + 1/1000*polytopes.regular_polygon(5)
    TypeError: int() argument must be a string or a number, not 'AlgebraicReal'
```

(This is an irrational polytope with a small bounding box. Sage should be able to enumerate it easily using the `rectangular_box_points` method.)

Also, the method for integer point enumeration using triangulation and Smith form (a simple implementation of normaliz's method (see #20885 comment:6) in `simplex_points` is limited to lattice polytopes. Normaliz is much faster and has an implementation for rational (non-lattice) polytopes. A generalization to include the case of semi-rational polytopes (i.e., possibly irrational translations of lattice polytopes) could be valuable; example:

```
    Polyhedron(vertices=((0, 0), (1743,3134))) + 1/1000*vector(AA, [AA(sqrt(5)), AA(sqrt(5))])
```

IIRC, I also got that error sporadically when I was testing #18029 as well, but I don't seem to get that on develop. Jeroen, any ideas?
