# Issue 19571: Return cached value for cached function

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-12-30 13:42:36

Currently, cached functions lack a way of returning a cached value without computing it. We add a method `cached()` which does exactly this: either it returns the cached value or it raises `KeyError`.

ok, looks good to me. I hope you have a real use case.

I have many!

A typical situation is where you need to compute some invariant X, which can either be computed directly or which can be immediately derived from some more complication invariant Y. If you already computed Y, you use it to get X. If you didn't compute Y already, you compute X directly.

For example, Y could be a group and X its cardinality.
