Currently, cached functions lack a way of returning a cached value without computing it. We add a method `cached()` which does exactly this: either it returns the cached value or it raises `KeyError`.

I have many!

A typical situation is where you need to compute some invariant X, which can either be computed directly or which can be immediately derived from some more complication invariant Y. If you already computed Y, you use it to get X. If you didn't compute Y already, you compute X directly.

For example, Y could be a group and X its cardinality.
