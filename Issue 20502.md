Keywords: days74

Make [SnapPy](http://www.math.uic.edu/t3m/SnapPy/) an "official" optional package. That could be the occasion of ensuring compatibility of the Sage Link class and the SnapPy link class.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20739

Nice!

How exactly do you imagine the integration with our Link class?

}
```

As a first step, Nathan tought us the `sage_link` method

```
sage: 
sage: import snappy
sage: L = snappy.Link('K10n11')
sage: K = L.sage_link()
sage: K.alexander_polynomial()
-t^-3 + 5*t^-2 - 9*t^-1 + 11 - 9*t + 5*t^2 - t^3
sage: L.alexander_polynomial()
t^6 - 5*t^5 + 9*t^4 - 11*t^3 + 9*t^2 - 5*t + 1
```

And there is a nice conversion from Sage link to SnapPy handled automatically

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(8)
sage: K = Link(B([-1, -1, -1, -2, 1, -2, 3, -2, 3]))
sage: L = snappy.Link(K)
```


This might already help for:
- double checking the outputs (from both sides)
- comparing the implementations

To enhance it further we could make work the natural conversion the other way around

```
sage: L = snappy.Link('K10n11')
sage: Link(L)
```

Something that would be good to have upstream is a `_sage_` method as that is the standard way to call something back to something Sage knows about. In any case, our `Link` code should just call the appropriate method in the SnapPy `Link` (and as a bonus, we can pass strings to SnapPy and convert those back to Sage so the knot names work).

As for passing the `--user` option, we should talk to Jeroen or Volker about that.

I just added the `_sage_` method to Spherogram, essentially as an alias for the `sage_link` method mentioned above.
