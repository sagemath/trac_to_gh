Thanks for fixing this.

A question: why have you made the method `degree()` of scalar fields return `self._tensor_rank` instead of `0`?

Actually, I had no particular reason in mind. :D
I guess, one reason is, to make clear the connection between the degree and the tensor rank. Moreover, this is more consistent to what is implemented in `diff_form.py`. In the end it felt more "round".

Do you want me to change it back?

Thanks.

A general comment: when you create a ticket, do not fill the "Reviewers" field; it will be filled by the reviewers themselves when they are actually making the review. If you want to suggest a reviewer for your ticket, simply add its username to the "Cc" field.
