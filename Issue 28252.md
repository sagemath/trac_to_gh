I can also get the error while running Sage, using the commands

```

This also happens about a third of the times I run Sage. In a given Sage session, it either always works or always fails, but if I restart Sage, the behavior can change.

The error can be reproduced only by

{
    "body": "\n```\nsage: gcd(x, QQbar(I))\n```\n\n\nIn Pynac, the above computation raises the error in the [line](https://github.com/pynac/pynac/blob/pynac-0.7.26/ginac/mpoly-singular.cpp#L71)\n\n```\n        map.insert(std::make_pair(e, index));\n```\n\nof `replace_with_symbol` invoked from [num2canonical](https://github.com/pynac/pynac/blob/pynac-0.7.26/ginac/mpoly-singular.cpp#L106), where the expression `e` is `I` and the `insert` method is from `std::unordered_map`. At this point, using `Log(map);`, the map looks like:\n\n```\n    {4}\n    1 => 4\n    0 => 3\n    x => 2\n    symbol0 => 1\n```\n\nThe `insert` function will need to compute the hash of the expression `e` (which succeeds) and, upon hash collisions, will need to perform equality tests with elements that are already stored in the map. I do not know where exactly this equality test is implemented, but this must be the step that fails. This explains the randomness in the bug, as the hash values depend on the session, so a collision for `I` might or might not occur. Additionally, this might depend on the implementation of the C++ standard library \u2013 though in principle this bug can occur on every platform, even with Python 2.\n\nThe equality test seems to check whether the difference of two elements is zero, resulting in the computation of `1 + (-I)`. Here, `1` is of type `AlgebraicReal` and `-I` is a `NumberFieldElement_quadratic`.\n\n--------\n\nI see two potential ways out:\n\nOne option is to always raise a `NotImplementedError` when attempting to compute the GCD of symbolic polynomials. As per the documentation, it does not reliably give correct results anyway:\n\n```\n        Embedded Sage objects of all kinds get basic support. Note that\n        full algebraic GCD is not implemented yet::\n\n            ...\n            sage: sqrt2 = SR(QQbar(sqrt(2)))\n            sage: gcd(sqrt2 + x, x^2 - 2)    # known bug\n            1\n```\n\n\nThe other option is to make the following addition work. And by my understanding of the coercion framework, it actually should work, as both arguments coerce to `CLF`, since the quadratic number field `N` comes with a complex embedding:\n\n```\nsage: N, i_neg, emb = QQbar(-I).as_number_field_element()\nsage: AA(1) + i_neg  # this should work\n...\nTypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for +: 'Algebraic Real Field' and 'Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 with I = 1*I'\nsage: N.coerce_embedding()\nGeneric morphism:\n  From: Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 with I = 1*I\n  To:   Complex Lazy Field\n  Defn: I -> 1*I\nsage: CLF.has_coerce_map_from(AA), CLF.has_coerce_map_from(N)\n(True, True)\nsage: CLF(AA(1)) + CLF(i_neg)\n1 - 1*I\n```\n\nMaking this addition work could be quite useful in general. Any suggestions how to solve this?",

```
sage: gcd(x, QQbar(I))
```


In Pynac, the above computation raises the error in the [line](https://github.com/pynac/pynac/blob/pynac-0.7.26/ginac/mpoly-singular.cpp#L71)

```
        map.insert(std::make_pair(e, index));
```

of `replace_with_symbol` invoked from [num2canonical](https://github.com/pynac/pynac/blob/pynac-0.7.26/ginac/mpoly-singular.cpp#L106), where the expression `e` is `I` and the `insert` method is from `std::unordered_map`. At this point, using `Log(map);`, the map looks like:

```
    {4}
    1 => 4
    0 => 3
    x => 2
    symbol0 => 1
```

The `insert` function will need to compute the hash of the expression `e` (which succeeds) and, upon hash collisions, will need to perform equality tests with elements that are already stored in the map. I do not know where exactly this equality test is implemented, but this must be the step that fails. This explains the randomness in the bug, as the hash values depend on the session, so a collision for `I` might or might not occur. Additionally, this might depend on the implementation of the C++ standard library – though in principle this bug can occur on every platform, even with Python 2.

The equality test seems to check whether the difference of two elements is zero, resulting in the computation of `1 + (-I)`. Here, `1` is of type `AlgebraicReal` and `-I` is a `NumberFieldElement_quadratic`.

I see two potential ways out:

One option is to always raise a `NotImplementedError` when attempting to compute the GCD of symbolic polynomials. As per the documentation, it does not reliably give correct results anyway:

```
        Embedded Sage objects of all kinds get basic support. Note that
        full algebraic GCD is not implemented yet::

            ...
            sage: sqrt2 = SR(QQbar(sqrt(2)))
            sage: gcd(sqrt2 + x, x^2 - 2)    # known bug
            1
```


The other option is to make the following addition work. And by my understanding of the coercion framework, it actually should work, as both arguments coerce to `CLF`, since the quadratic number field `N` comes with a complex embedding:

```
sage: N, i_neg, emb = QQbar(-I).as_number_field_element()
sage: AA(1) + i_neg  # this should work
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for +: 'Algebraic Real Field' and 'Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 with I = 1*I'
sage: N.coerce_embedding()
Generic morphism:
  From: Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 with I = 1*I
  To:   Complex Lazy Field
  Defn: I -> 1*I
sage: CLF.has_coerce_map_from(AA), CLF.has_coerce_map_from(N)
(True, True)
sage: CLF(AA(1)) + CLF(i_neg)
1 - 1*I
```

Making this addition work could be quite useful in general. Any suggestions how to solve this?

This seems all pretty complicated. Can we at least for now just add a `# known bug`? According to the discussion here its not a new bug, we just are now hitting an old one.
