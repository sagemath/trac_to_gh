The first question is about the internal representation.  Options are:

* a `ClonableArray` of `frozenset`s.  This gives reasonable performance, with hardly any changes in library code.

* a `ClonableArray` of sorted `tuple`s.  This should give much better performance, and is more natural in many situations.  However, it may be surprising to users.

* a totally ordered base set, together with a restricted growth function.

I would expect that sorted tuples give much worse performance generically when things get large because of the sorting. I have no problem with set partitions being `tuple`s that represent sets, but I would think the code would be more natural/intuitive/readable by using `frozensets`.

Quick comments:


```
-len(z.intersection(p)) != 0
+z.intersection(p)
```

is a faster test for non-emptiness.

I don't like going to a recursive algorithm; Python's recursion check limit gets in the way of computing large examples. Also, why is this iterator faster? Is it because it does not create so much transient (Sage) objects? I think it would be better to explicit implement a backtracking version instead of the recursion (you will also get fewer transient objects and could do this in Cython for speed).

Your `from_word`, you could create `set`s, which is more efficient to convert to a `frozenset`:

```
sage: X = set([1,2,3])
sage: L = [1,2,3]
sage: %timeit frozenset(X)
10000000 loops, best of 3: 128 ns per loop
sage: %timeit frozenset(L)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 193 ns per loop

sage: X = set(range(12))
sage: L = list(range(12))
sage: %timeit frozenset(X)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 269 ns per loop
sage: %timeit frozenset(L)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 399 ns per loop
```

Dear Travis! Thank you very much for your comments!

I have now included an alternative iterator, due to Knuth.  It is a small bit faster and non-recursive.  However, I find it quite a bit more difficult to understand.

Please let me know whether you prefer it.

> Your `from_word`, you could create `set`s, which is more efficient to convert to a `frozenset`

in principle this is true, however, I have to `add` elements (which I know to be distinct, but I cannot take advantage of this) to each of the blocks all the time.  It turns out that appending to lists and then converting to a `frozenset` is (marginally) faster.

> I don't like going to a recursive algorithm; Python's recursion check limit gets in the way of computing large examples. Also, why is this iterator faster? Is it because it does not create so much transient (Sage) objects? I think it would be better to explicit implement a backtracking version instead of the recursion (you will also get fewer transient objects and could do this in Cython for speed).

I think that one reason - apart from using `OrderedSetPartitions`, is that the original iterator does something much more complicated: you can prescribe the sizes of the blocks, too.  I can have a short look whether we gain much by changing the internal representation of `OrderedSetPartition`.  I must admit that I have not yet understood the iterator.

I have also implemented (but not yet committed) a (recursive) iterator for generating set partitions into a given number of blocks.  I'm afraid I do not have a non-recursive version of that one.

If possible, could you give a use case for iterating over set partitions (into k blocks) where we hit the recursion limit?  When the number of blocks is unrestricted, I am hitting it for set partitions of a 983-element set.

I don't think that would be any worse than the current version. From a quick test, I get a recursion depth error for this:

```
sage: SP = SetPartitions(5000, Partition([5]*1000))
sage: it = iter(SP)
sage: it.next()
```


At one point I understood how `OrderedSetPartitions` iterator worked, but I have forgotten.

With combinatorial objects, we can sometimes test conjectures on very large objects. Say you want to test the first million of set partitions of 5000 with 1000 parts. Basically it becomes an artificial  limitation; plus, recursion is relatively slow.

It turns out that I have another question:

Currently, for two set partitions `s` and `t` we have `s < t` if turning them into lists (sorting each block into increasing order, then the set of blocks by minimal element) makes `s` come before `t` in lexicographic order.

This leads to strange results, for example:

```
sage: it = SetPartitions().__iter__()
sage: sorted(next(it) for x in range(10))
[{},
 {{1}},
 {{1}, {2}},
 {{1}, {2}, {3}},
 {{1}, {2, 3}},
 {{1, 2}},
 {{1, 2}, {3}},
 {{1, 2, 3}},
 {{1, 2, 3, 4}},
 {{1, 3}, {2}}]
```

Note that `{{1},{2,3}}` comes before `{{1,2}}`.

I would rather first sort by size, then by the number of blocks, and finally lexicographically.

Should I do this?

The problem is that the new iterator produces the set partitions in different order, which makes something like 30 doctests fail in `diagram_algebras.py`. I thought of replacing doctests like

```
P.basis().list()
```

with

```
set(P.basis())
```

and
to make them more robust, but then the sorting order is weird.

Dear Aaron and Mike!

since my original motivation was to do some computations with the orbit basis, and this ticket makes these computations a bit faster, maybe you could have a look?

For example (on 8.3.beta6):

```
sage: P5 = PartitionAlgebra(5, 2, ZZ); O5 = P5.orbit_basis(); O5
Orbit basis of Partition Algebra of rank 5 with parameter 2 over Integer Ring
sage: o1 = O5([[1,2,3,-1,-2,-3], [4,-4],[5,-5]])
sage: o2 = P5([[1,-1],[2],[3],[-2],[-3], [4],[-4],[5,-5]])
sage: o3 = O5([[1,2,-2,-1],[3,-3],[4,-4],[-5,-5]])
sage: %timeit o1*o2*o3
1 loop, best of 3: 24.9 s per loop
sage: 
```

with this ticket:

```
sage: %timeit o1*o2*o3
1 loop, best of 3: 1.07 s per loop
```

So there are a few things that warrant a second look:

- Changing `self.n` to `self._k`. While this is the correct thing to do, this is a backwards incompatible change and requires deprecation (it is public). I think you should have `n` as a lazy attribute that raises the deprecation warning saying that it will become a method (there needs to be a public way to get this information).
- `x, y = min(a), max(a)` is better as `x, y = sorted(a)` as the latter forces `a` to have length 2.
- What about using `_iterator_part` for returning objects that are not elements of set partition, which do have some overhead?
- You have changed the behavior of `partition_diagrams` (at least on Python2) as `map` returns a list. I think it would be better to keep it as an explicit iterator.

Right.  In fact, I do not know what would be correct.  It did not work with `x, y = sorted(a)`, if I remember correctly - sometimes `a` has length greater than 2.

Your iterator creates an actual element of the parent, which has overhead. I don't see why you are not rewriting `_iterator_part` with the new algorithm and using that.

No, the original code took the first and the second element of the `Set` `a`, I take, for simplicity the smallest and the largest.

I do not understand.  `SetPartitions._iterator_part` is **very** slow, and I have no new algorithm for it, and it is not completely trivial to improve it.

Most of the time the `atoms_of_congruence_lattice` have parts of size greater than 2 (in fact, just testing a number of lattices they are often just one block) and this algorithm returns two elements from those blocks.  You might be able to speed this up in some cases by turning `a` into a list and taking the first and second elements, but this doesn't seem like it would be more efficient in general.

I checked and `_iterator_part` is returning a set of sets.  What do you suggest it should return?

```
sage: SetPartitions(6)._iterator_part(Partition([3,2,1])).next().parent()
<class 'sage.sets.set.Set_object_enumerated_with_category'>

Oh, I see, the iterator is for all set partitions, not with a fixed set size. However, I think it would be better to have a separate iterator that returns the lists of frozensets for those things that do not need a real `SetPartition`. I also think `_iterator_parts` should be consistent and return lists of frozensets. Would it also be possible to modify the Knuth algorithm for `_iterator_parts`?

This is horrible code:

```sage
            try:
                tst = frozenset(e for B in self._base_diagram for e in B)
                if tst != self.parent()._set:

Provided such a method, but not used.  It looks a bit like premature optimization to me right now.

This is on my todo list, but on a separate ticket.  Currently, I would be transforming `Set` (from `OrderedSetPartition`) into `frozenset`, which is a bit backwards.

Because the bug turned up only for tableaux of size 10.

because it is much better to trace through, and at least for me, easier to understand.  If you insist, I'll change it.

There is a reason to have some of the output as it is: it is quite possible that the order the set partitions appear changes again.  Then the diff will be much easier to check.

Thanks for your careful look! I modified all other things as you suggested.

That is a bit unfair as it is something that could easily be used in places where ordering over all set partitions but that is not the actual returned object.

That is fine.

Huh? Isn't that what we are doing here?

Really? That makes me very worried that the general iterator order is machine dependent, which seems very strange to me as it looks like there shouldn't be anything machine dependent in the implementation. `CFM._an_element_` just iterates over the first few elements.

OK, please suggest a name - is there any convention?  In any case, I think that in the case of diagram algebras one might want to consider to use `SetPartitions(x).list()` instead, because this caches the result.  That's why I said it might be premature.

Sorry, I do not recall the details anymore precisely.  Roughly, I had to modify the code (because `frozenset`s do not support indexing), and the first version had a bug, which I only discovered by luck, because it didn't happen for very small tableaux.  I don't think that I ever commited the wrong code...

Of course not - only if the order of the items in the lists is very likely to change again.

I am really sorry, but I cannot remember what I did exactly.  However, since there are really very few standard Young tableaux on 5 elements, it is quite unlikely to hit a bug by producing such a small tableau.

I still do not see how `an_element` is machine dependent without the iterator being machine dependent, which is a bigger problem. The precise code for the `_an_element_` (and hence, `an_element`) for the orbit basis is:

```sage
        x = self.zero()
        I = self.basis().keys()
        R = self.base_ring()
        try:
            x = x + self.monomial(I.an_element())
        except Exception:
            pass
        try:
            g = iter(self.basis().keys())
            for c in range(1,4):
                x = x + self.term(next(g), R(c))
        except Exception:
            pass
        return x
```

Now the doctests themselves may need to be updated because the iteration order of the set partitions has changed, but I do not see the need of moving away from `an_element`. I am okay with constructing an explicit element, but I want to be certain that there is no machine dependency here, as that would mean the iterator is machine dependent.

Okay, I pushed a bunch of changes, including adding back in the `an_element()` tests. I think perhaps the non-determinism might have come from the fact you were calling `list(self.base_set())` in your iterator, which may not have a guaranteed output. I also cythonized the set partition iterators, which cut the time to ~60%.

Since you claim this is much faster but have not provided timings, here are some:

```
sage: S = SetPartitions(10)
sage: S.cardinality()
115975
sage: SP = SetPartitions(12,7)
sage: SP.cardinality()
627396

sage: %time for x in S: pass
CPU times: user 1min 19s, sys: 71.4 ms, total: 1min 19s
Wall time: 1min 19s

sage: %time for x in S: pass
Longer than 5 minutes
```

vs "current" branch:

```
sage: %time for x in S: pass
CPU times: user 881 ms, sys: 28.1 ms, total: 909 ms
Wall time: 851 ms
sage: %time for x in SP: pass
CPU times: user 5.9 s, sys: 19.2 ms, total: 5.92 s
Wall time: 5.89 s
```

vs with my changes:

```
sage: %time for x in S: pass
CPU times: user 602 ms, sys: 14.5 ms, total: 617 ms
Wall time: 571 ms
sage: %time for x in SP: pass
CPU times: user 3.84 s, sys: 19.4 ms, total: 3.86 s
Wall time: 3.82 s
```


Now if we could get a non-recursive version of the set partition iterator with fixed blocks, I could get some more speed out of those iterators. The other possibility would be to try and make that into a parallel function, but that might be tricky because `a` needs to be shared in some fashion.

So if tests pass for you, then we can set this to a positive review as I am fairly confident that the iteration order (and hence the `an_element()`) is not machine-dependent (since I squashed the only other place I could see where a machine dependency might creep in).
