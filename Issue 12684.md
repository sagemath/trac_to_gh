# Issue 12684: multiline doctests starting with '....:'

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12856

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2012-04-18 21:42:42

Assignee: mvngu

Keywords: multiline doctest

Since the Sage prompt for multiline commands is `....:`, this should also work for doctests. At the moment you have to use the python `...` prompt for doctests.

See also #10458 and #12415. (I suspect this and/or #10458 would need to be rebased on #12415 since the latter rewrites much of the doctest framework.)

Actually I guess this ticket is pretty much a duplicate of #10458...
