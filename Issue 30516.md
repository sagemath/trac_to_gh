I'm not sure if the threshold for selecting default algorithm is still best possible. At least, we have improved both algorithms.

Currently, the default algorithm is `'delete'` if the number of vertices of the subgraph is at least 5% of the number of vertices of the graph. But following tests suggest that `'add'` is faster when the number of vertices of the subgraph is up to 90%... so we should change the threshold to e.g. 90%. Do you agree ?

Btw, `subgraph_by_deleting` should only be used in place or if the backend has an optimized copy method (which appears to be not the case yet).

Not sure about the special subgraphs yet, which are not obtained by just reducing the number of vertices.

- may be the method `obtain_subgraph` could be renamed like `subgraph_given_vertices` or something more explicit with respect what it actually do.
- there is a line `cdef CGraph` to remove
- instead of `max(b_vertices_2)`, why not using the size or capacity of bitset `active_vertices` ? or may be the size of `b_vertices` ?
- Somehow, before starting to add vertices to `other`, we should call `realloc` with appropriate size, thus avoiding multiple calls.
- I have no clue how to deal with multiple edges here.

- Concerning methods `add` and `delete`, I fully agree that now `delete` should be used only when `inplace is True or algorithm == 'delete'`. The  `add` method is now way faster and should be the default one, without threshold.

I'll keep that in mind.

Concerning the multiedges, unfortunately I shbould clean up dense and sparse graphs backend a bit first. Otherwise, I think it is not a problem.

If ``self`` is mutliedge, it will simply try to make ``other`` multiedge. If other is dense, this will raise an error.

If I do things right, optimizing `is_subgraph` afterwards should be easy. In particual this can be used to check equality fast.

So may be for the moment, we can use the new method for graphs without multiple edges only and let other cases in the todo list (i.e., raise `NotImplementedError` if called on a graph with multiple edges).

This is basically working.

What is missing:

- Documentation.
- Cleanup.
- Exposure in `__init__` of `DiGraph` and `Graph` to speed up e.g. copy.
- (Maybe) Heuristics when to delete instead of add:
  As long as there are no improved copying methods, I changed the deletion subgraph to first obtain the subgraph induced by the given vertices instead of making a copy. Depending on the input of `edges` and `edge_property`, this might be better than adding, but maybe in not so many cases. And in those cases it might be more natural to obtain a subgraph first and then delete edges.
