I'm OK with this improvement, but the same should be done for `weighted_adjacency_matrix`.

These methods could benefit further improvements. So far we first feed a dictionary and then build the matrix. It might be faster to directly feed the matrix.

I'll stop here, but the same could be done to `BipartiteGraph.reduced_adjacency_matrix` and some other methods that I see in `git grep ' def.*_matrix' src/sage/graphs/`

For `distance_matrix`, `kirchhoff_matrix` it is trickier because these methods already accept `**kwds` that they pass on to some other method.

For `kirchhoff_matrix`, all arguments in `**kwds` are passed to `adjacency_matrix` or `weighted_adjacency_matrix`. So it is now possible to specify the base ring.

A question is whether we should allow passing arguments for the matrix constructor to methods calling `adjacency_matrix` and similar methods.
