Why doesn't touching `spkg/installed/gcc-*` before going an upgrade cause all packages that depend on gcc to be rebuilt? Oh, I see, nothing actually depends on gcc.

I've tried upgrading using this patch, and several times I've gotten an error with R:

```
mkdir /Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/sage-5.X-upgrade/local/lib/R/include
mkdir: /Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/sage-5.X-upgrade/local/lib/R/include: File exists
```

And sure enough, there is a *file* (not a directory) `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/R/include`. It's not from the previous installation, since the spkg-install file deletes `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/R/`. I'm guessing that it's not related to this ticket. Have you ever seen this before?

If sage-env gets sourced more than once (as can happen during upgrading with this patch), we will get duplicate entries in $PATH, $LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and others. I don't think this is an issue, but it was one of the points of #10469. Should I be concerned about this?

Personally, I am not concerned about this.  I don't see a problem (apart from efficiency perhaps) with having duplicate `PATH` or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` entries.  Also note that #10469 did not point out a particular problem that this causes.

Also remember that this can happen only *during* upgrading.
