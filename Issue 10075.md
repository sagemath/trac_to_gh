James Parson writes on sage-support:

```
I was playing with some elliptic-curves calculations in Sage 4.5.3, 
and I came across (or, rather, cooked up) the following, which puzzled 
me: 
sage: K = QuadraticField(8,'a') 
sage: E = EllipticCurve([K(0),0,0,-1,0]) 
sage: P = E([-1,0]) 
sage: P.division_points(2) 
[] 
sage: P.is_divisible_by(2) 
True 
Is this the intended behavior? From the source code, it looks as if 
P.is_divisible_by(2) just checks whether the x-coordinate of the 
system of equations for dividing P by 2 can be solved over K. The 
division_points method does the full check of whether the system has a 
solution over K. Shouldn't is_divisible_by do the same thing? 
```

to which John Cremona replied 

```
It is a bug -- well spotted.  In this case the x-coordinates of the 
points Q such that 2*Q=P are the roots of x^2 + 2*x - 1 which are a/ 
2-1 and -a/2-1, but the y-coordinates are not in the field. 
```


Patch coming up.

By the way, the only points P for which P.is_divisible_by(m) might have returned the wrong result (True when it should be False) are those of order 2, when m is even.  [Proof: exercise.]

William points out that the new code, whjle correct, is slower (it solves quadratics and constructs points) so I'll re-work this more thoroughly, leaving the old code where it works and doing as little as possible where it does not.

There's a new patch (intended to replace the old but due to a typo in the name both still appear in the list above, sorry) which does a more thorough job, with more tests, ready for review.

That is fine. All tests pass and I do agree that the second version is what we want.
