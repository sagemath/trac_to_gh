# Issue 17803: Minimal polynomials of matrices over SymbolicRing

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18040

Original creator: pbruin

Original creation time: 2015-03-23 11:39:26

Keywords: minimal polynomial symbolic maxima

In Sage 6.6.rc0:

```
sage: M = matrix.identity(SR, 2)
sage: type(M)
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_symbolic_dense.Matrix_symbolic_dense'>
sage: M.minpoly()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: is_squarefree() is only implemented for polynomials over principal ideal domains
```

Trying to work around #11126 fails with a different error:

```
sage: SR in Fields()
True
sage: M.minpoly()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError:
```

This ticket implements `minpoly()` for matrices over `SymbolicRing` using the function `minimalPoly()` from Maxima's `diag` package.
