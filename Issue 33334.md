one does not need a new remote branch, just do `git push` with "force" (`-f`) to the old one.

```
git push trac HEAD:u/gh-adarsh-kishore786/documentation_is_outdated_in_some_places -f

```
Removing a File from Every Commit

This occurs fairly commonly.
Someone accidentally commits a huge binary file with a thoughtless git add ., 
and you want to remove it everywhere. []
filter-branch is the tool you probably want to use to scrub your entire history. 
To remove a file named passwords.txt from your entire history,
you can use the --tree-filter option to filter-branch:

$ git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f passwords.txt' HEAD
```
