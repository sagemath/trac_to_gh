These are only some of the errors which I found in the documentation. I am sure that there are various others at different places. If anyone notices such an error, please submit a change here

please remove `developer.pdf` from your branch, it surely is an oversight on your side.


---

Comment by @adarsh-kishore786 created at 2022-03-30 13:44:12

The `developer.pdf` file is a part of the `develop` branch of [SageMath](SageMath) as far as I know. I simply made a new branch from there which also contains `developer.pdf`. If this is a mistake, please say so and I will correct it.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2022-03-30 13:53:36

if you look at your branch by clicking on it, you'll see

```diff
diff --git a/developer.pdf b/developer.pdf
new file mode 100644
index 00000000..cb6e513
--- /dev/null
+++ b/developer.pdf
```

which means that there was no `developer.pdf` in the branch you used to create yours. You somehow added this file to the branch (perhaps while running `git commit -a`, which would automatically add, in some cases at least, untracked files).

So yes, it was a mistake on your side.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

Comment by egourgoulhon created at 2022-03-31 17:15:25

Maybe I am abusing by setting the ticket to "positive review". Did you plan to add something to it? The usual workflow is that the author sets the ticket to "needs review" state when it is ready from his point of view. If you would like to add something, please set the ticket to "needs work" state.

Though as of now I have no more things to add, I did mention in the comments that as I (or someone else) comes across outdated documentation, they can push it on this branch. In view of this, I think it is indeed more apt to have a "needs work" status rather than "positive review"

OK, but note that it is perfectly fine to have tickets that perform small fixes, like this one in its current state (2 lines in the source code). For instance, the ticket title could be narrowed to something like "Correct wrong paths in the developer's guide" and get positive review to be effective in Sage 9.6. Otherwise, it might remain open for a long time and the developer's guide will still have the errors you have spotted.

Put that way, it seems to me that it is better to narrow down the ticket title and get a positive review. These changes, though small, would be important to someone reading the developer's guide and therefore should be fixed as soon as possible. I will do what you suggested.

Comment by egourgoulhon created at 2022-04-01 06:22:02

One last thing: it's better to re-implement your fix in a new clean branch, otherwise when this one is merged, it will clutter Sage's git tree with 1 MB of spurious data (the size of the file `developer.pdf`).


---

Comment by @adarsh-kishore786 created at 2022-04-01 06:42:51

I have deleted `developer.pdf` from this branch. Should I create a new ticket still?

No, simply create a new branch from some Sage 9.6.beta6 (or earlier beta), implement your changes, commit them and push the new branch to trac (with a new name), then replace the name of the branch in the `Branch` field of the ticket.


---

Comment by @adarsh-kishore786 created at 2022-04-01 08:00:43

The `Branch` field of this ticket or the new one I will create?

The `Branch` field of this ticket; there is no need to create a new ticket.

Sorry for the delay in responding: as I said in comment:22, there is no need to create a new ticket.

one does not need a new remote branch, just do `git push` with "force" (`-f`) to the old one.

```
git push trac HEAD:u/gh-adarsh-kishore786/documentation_is_outdated_in_some_places -f
```



---

Comment by @adarsh-kishore786 created at 2022-04-01 08:49:05

alright so I have to do these commands in sequence from SAGE_ROOT:


```
git checkout u/gh-adarsh-kishore786/documentation_is_outdated_in_some_places
git push trac HEAD:u/gh-adarsh-kishore786/documentation_is_outdated_in_some_places -f
```


Please correct if any changes in this are required.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2022-04-01 08:53:55

it's a bit late, but let me point out a correct way to get rid of a file that was once checked in, from all commits. The following can be found in https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History (which has all the details and examples)

```
Removing a File from Every Commit

This occurs fairly commonly.
Someone accidentally commits a huge binary file with a thoughtless git add ., 
and you want to remove it everywhere. []
filter-branch is the tool you probably want to use to scrub your entire history. 
To remove a file named passwords.txt from your entire history,
you can use the --tree-filter option to filter-branch:

$ git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f passwords.txt' HEAD
```



---

Comment by @adarsh-kishore786 created at 2022-04-01 08:56:16

alright, so I can do a 

```
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f developer.pdf' HEAD
```


and then 

```
git push trac HEAD:u/gh-adarsh-kishore786/documentation_is_outdated_in_some_places -f
```

right?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2022-04-01 09:03:42

yes, assuming you're on the branch that you pushed to the remote `u/gh-adarsh-kishore786/documentation_is_outdated_in_some_places` (i.e. it should be the `HEAD`)

if you meanwhile are on another branch you can get back to it by using appropriate `git checkout`.


---

Comment by @adarsh-kishore786 created at 2022-04-01 09:17:44


```
WARNING: git-filter-branch has a glut of gotchas generating mangled history
	 rewrites.  Hit Ctrl-C before proceeding to abort, then use an
	 alternative filtering tool such as 'git filter-repo'
	 (https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/) instead.  See the
	 filter-branch manual page for more details; to squelch this warning,
	 set FILTER_BRANCH_SQUELCH_WARNING=1.
```


This was a warning I got on using the command. I hope that's alright to use?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2022-04-01 09:28:14

Given that in your case `filter-branch` is going to change just one or two commits, I'd just ignore this warning.

Alright, this took a while to complete, but it has been done now. Does it look the way you intended?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2022-04-01 15:48:01

hmm, no, sorry, it looks as if, indeed, as warned, it created a huge changeset. :-(

I've put on the correct branch you created for the other ticket instead:
`u/gh-adarsh-kishore786/correct_wrong_paths_in_the_developer_s_guide` - it's good.

Positive review.

I hope I have done everything correctly in the new ticket which I opened earlier. I can fill the ticket description etc and then I guess we close this ticket.

Thanks a lot both of you dimpase and egourgoulhon for the help and also I am extremely sorry for wasting your time on an unnecessarily complicated issue due to my inexperience. I hope that I will do better as I learn more.

Oh, I think you mean we leave this ticket as it is after you changed commit branch and delete the other new one?

Yes exactly: #33620 should be closed as duplicate of the current ticket. 
The new branch introduced here in comment:38 looks good to me, so I agree with the positive review. Thanks for your work.

You're welcome. Also on my side, the explanations I gave were probably not very clear.

Thanks for this tip. I did not know about it.
