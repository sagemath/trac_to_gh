The sage_conf package supports substitutions of autoconf variables in an ad-hoc way. For example,

```python
SAGE_LOCAL = "@prefix@"
```

uses a direct autoconf substitution of the `$prefix` variable, but then

```python
SAGE_PKG_CONFIG_PATH = "@SAGE_PKG_CONFIG_PATH@".replace('$SAGE_LOCAL', SAGE_LOCAL)
```

relies on python to substitute the correct value in for the `$SAGE_LOCAL` placeholder. Moreover, substitutions involving most other ./configure variables like libdir, bindir, and so on cannot be made: they all include references to the (exec) prefix, as in

```sh
libdir='${exec_prefix}/lib'
```

While this is a bit annoying, it's part of the GNU coding standards. The indirection allows for the end-user to override these paths at "make" time by running `make variable=value`. This is discussed at

https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.70/html_node/Installation-Directory-Variables.html

The bottom line is that "make" needs to be involved in the process if you don't want to wind up fighting the tools. I propose that we add a "make" step to sage_conf to perform these substitutions based on the sample code in the autoconf documentation, so that we can make substitutions like ``@`libdir`@`` directly in spkg-configure.m4 and elsewhere.
