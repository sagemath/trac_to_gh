Keywords: out-of-kilter, minflow, maxflow, critical path, GLPK

Certain types of linear problems can be more efficiently solved with algorithms more specialized than the simplex algorithm. An example of such problems is a mincost problem. The GLPK provides a set of graph / network algorithms which currently have got not interface to Sage.

This patch implements a new backend intended to provide access to the GLPK graph / network routines. The initial implementation should provide an interface to

* glp_mincost_okalg - Solving mincost problems with the out-of-kilter algorithm
* glp_maxflow_ffalg - Solving maxflow problems with the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
* glp_cpp - Solving critical path problems

In addition it provides support for reading and writing problem data to files

Hellooooooooo Christian !!!

Your patch is still waiting for a review, but such large patches eat my week-ends. And I also have #13808 too deal with `T_T`
I uploaded a patch which does some (uninteresting) changes to your patch. I also have a list of comments. I can see that you put a lot of work in this patch, but you add a big amount of things in Sage so it is bound to take some time again `^^;`

* `create_graph method` : why is this a method, and not just part of the __init__ function ? If I do the following, it looks like memory keeps being allocated and is never freed !
  {{{
  gbe = GLPKGraphBackend()
  gbe.create_graph()
  gbe.create_graph()
  gbe.create_graph()
  ...
  }}}

* Can't all occurrences of `if self.graph is NULL:` be removed from the file ? self.graph() can never be null !
* self.graph() can be null if something went wrong with the memory allocation. An exception should be raised if that happens.
* I had never seen this `property` Python thing but it feels weird to have two ways to set/get this graph_name parameter. Could you chose between one of those ? (same for other properties defined in the module)
* Note from personal experience : I regret to have exposed "name" functions in the LP interface. It has always been a mess to maintain, it takes a loooooooooot of code just to deal with it, and I really do not see the point. It's up to you in this case but in you stead I would not expose anything related to names `^^;`
* It looks like you need to free memory in methods like `del_vertices` when you allocate it, for instance your `num` variable.
* Considering that the Graph methods in Sage are `Graph.add_vertices` and `Graph.delete_vertices`, could you copy the same names in your interface ? Or do you think that it is a bad idea ? (same with edges)
* `arc_exists` is `has_edge` in Sage. Or `has_arc` if you prefer.
* I had not seen this `delete_graph` method when I made my first comment. But here again, I feel that this should not be a meethod, and be a part of `__destruct__` instead `:-)`
* `read_graph` : in Sage's way of doing things, this should be part of the constructor. Something like "you can build an empty graph, or build it from a file`
* It would be nice to have an index of methods at the top of the module's documentation, as we have at the top of the following page : http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/graphs/graph.html.

Hello Nathann,

sorry, I did not mean to push you for a review (I know the patch is big) but thanks a million for your fast and very constructive comments. You really gave me something to chew on ;-), but this is fun.

Hi Nathann,

finally I find the time start working on your comments, maybe I can bother you with a few questions again ;-)


> 
> * `create_graph method` : why is this a method, and not just part of the __init__ function ? If I do the following, it looks like memory keeps being allocated and is never freed !

Absolutly correct, changed that!

> 
> * Can't all occurrences of `if self.graph is NULL:` be removed from the file ? self.graph() can never be null !
> * self.graph() can be null if something went wrong with the memory allocation. An exception should be raised if that happens.

Got it again, residues from prior version :$  Killed them all and added a memory check with the appropriate exception.
> * I had never seen this `property` Python thing but it feels weird to have two ways to set/get this graph_name parameter. Could you chose between one of those ? (same for other properties defined in the module)
Ok, you might be right here.
> * Note from personal experience : I regret to have exposed "name" functions in the LP interface. It has always been a mess to maintain, it takes a loooooooooot of code just to deal with it, and I really do not see the point. It's up to you in this case but in you stead I would not expose anything related to names `^^;`
You might be right that this feature makes no sense but I do not fully grap what the problems you mention could be. Can you give me a hint here?
> * It looks like you need to free memory in methods like `del_vertices` when you allocate it, for instance your `num` variable.
Yup! Learned something again and will pay attention to mallocs in the future, I promise ;-)
> * Considering that the Graph methods in Sage are `Graph.add_vertices` and `Graph.delete_vertices`, could you copy the same names in your interface ? Or do you think that it is a bad idea ? (same with edges)
Hmm, do you mean the same names only or the full interface (names and arguments and output)? Although it would require a bit of work it might be sensible to go for the second alternative: A standard (same job = same function call) within a software like Sage would make sense. What do you think?

dito
> * I had not seen this `delete_graph` method when I made my first comment. But here again, I feel that this should not be a meethod, and be a part of `__destruct__` instead `:-)`
Right, see above.
> * `read_graph` : in Sage's way of doing things, this should be part of the constructor. Something like "you can build an empty graph, or build it from a file`
Right, see above
> * It would be nice to have an index of methods at the top of the module's documentation, as we have at the top of the following page : http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/graphs/graph.html.

Yes, you are right, but as you say, when the patch is almost done ;-
> * It would be nice to say what ccdata is supposed to be, somewhere.
Ah, yes indeed ;-=
> * It would make sense to update GenericGraph.flow() so that it can use GLPK as a solver. Actually, the best would be to have in your new module a function converting a Sage graph to a GLPK graph, so that the code in GenericGraph would stay short.

That's a cool idea, let's see what I can do ;-)

Hello,

I reworked the patch considerably based on Nathann's comments above. The major changes:
* Assured syncronization of created extension types and the glpk_graph
* Removed potential memory leaks
* Renamed methods to align with existing Sage Graph method names, and
* added some methods to align with existing Sage Graph
* Removed exposure of "name" property of glpk graph

Hmmmmm.... I'm sorry to say this but I read this patch 3 times, on three different days (with long intervals in between), and each time it made me very angry.. There's something like 1500 lines of code in there whose role is to do :

```
get_something()
    return self.backend.something
set_something(x)
    self.backend.something = x
```

each time checking that the backend exists, and with doctests.. Honestly, we have to find a way around this. 1500 lines of code.Including doctests, of course. 1500 lines.

I'll walk a bit and go eat something to change my mind, then think about it again.

Hello Nathann,

first of all: Thanks for the time you invest in helping me on this! Sorry for making you angry, not my intention - I just did the best I could. But I know how to take your well meant beatings by now ;-)

Two quick things :
* Why do you keep a pointer toward Sage's graph ``self.sage_graph`` ? There are several problem with this design : the graph may be modified by the user, while you keep a pointer toward a graph that gets modified. Secondly, as it seems you only need it for two methods, you might as well give the graph as a parameter to those two methods, and get rid of the parameter.
*  Don't do this :
    {{{
    sage: from sage.numerical.backends.glpk_graph_backend \ 
import GLPKGraphBackend
}}}
    If you *need* to split lines, do it this way :
    {{{
    sage: from sage.numerical.backends.glpk_graph_backend \ 
...      import GLPKGraphBackend
}}}

    But you really shouldn't split lines so often. It' meant to make code easier to read (a least I believe it is), but sometimes it really doesn't help. As they appear really often, I think that you should let this line stay even if it is very long. Besides, you very often don't need to add a terinal `\`. For instance, this :

        {{{
 	830	                return (u, v, {"low":(<c_a_data *>a.data).low, \ 
 	831	                               "cap":(<c_a_data *>a.data).cap, \ 
 	832	                               "cost":(<c_a_data *>a.data).cost, \ 
 	833	                               "x":(<c_a_data *>a.data).x}) 
}}}

    Can be replaced by 

        {{{
 	830	                return (u, v, {"low":(<c_a_data *>a.data).low, 
 	831	                               "cap":(<c_a_data *>a.data).cap, 
 	832	                               "cost":(<c_a_data *>a.data).cost, 
 	833	                               "x":(<c_a_data *>a.data).x}) 
}}}
    It works, because Python knows the line is not finished : some parenthesis are still open at this step, and it's waiting for `}` and `)`.

Hellooooooooooooooo Christian.

Well, I think I spent my whole saturday on your patch. Here is a patch to apply on topof yours, which changes many things among which the following :

* `set_vertex/set_vertices` were renamed to `set_vertex_demand` and `set_vertices_demand` as they define "rhs", and as the help of `get_vertex` says that `"rhs"` represents the demand in mincost flow algorithms. As a result, they do not take a dictionary as an argument anymore but only a numerical value, as it is only meant to define a numerical value and nothing else.

* some unimportant reformatting of the index of method at the tp of the document. It goes beyond 80 characters, but it is easier to read this way.

* `fname` is not `fname` but "data". data can be a filename, None, or a Sage graph.

* You can use "::" wherever you like, not only after "EXAMPLES".

* `import_generic_graph` looks like trouble if you call it after having defined edges and vertices in the graph. And its use did not seem very sensible at this step. Hence I removed the function, which is now part of the class constructor.

* In this `import_generic_graph` function you were trying to guess the value of `rhs` from the vertex name, by casting it to a float. Are you aware that most of our graph's vertices are integers ? And that no two vertices can have the same name ? This would let rhs be defined to 0, 2, 3, 4, 5 ... in a graph without anybody noticing, wouldn't it ? I removed that part of the code. Honestly I do not like the fact that rhs is guessed from the result of `Graph.get_vertex` (if it happens to be a numerical value or a dictionary) as it seems to be that users could have stuff defined in `rhs` without knowing it. Looks dangerous. If you agree I would be glad to see it removed, otherwise I will not complain anymore.

* I hate the fact that vertices are necessarily represented by strings. But that's not your fault of course, the API is written like that.

* I hate the fact that there is no function in the API to look for an edge, and that you have to do it yourself.

And many, many other small details in the code. A bugfix in `add_vertices` random stuff everywhere.

Well. Tell me what you think about it. I don't know if all this will be heavily used for itself, but we will a least have to expose the flow algorithms inside of the Graph.connectivity methods later on. Thank you for your work for I know it has taken a lifetime, and I think this patch will be ready very soon. 

See youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu !!!

Hello Nathann,


> * `set_vertex/set_vertices` were renamed to `set_vertex_demand` and `set_vertices_demand` as they define "rhs", and as the help of `get_vertex` says that `"rhs"` represents the demand in mincost flow algorithms. As a result, they do not take a dictionary as an argument anymore but only a numerical value, as it is only meant to define a numerical value and nothing else.
>

Thanks for all the good changes!

> * `import_generic_graph` looks like trouble if you call it after having defined edges and vertices in the graph. And its use did not seem very sensible at this step. Hence I removed the function, which is now part of the class constructor.

You're absolutely right


> * In this `import_generic_graph` function you were trying to guess the value of `rhs` from the vertex name, by casting it to a float. Are you aware that most of our graph's vertices are integers ?

You are absolutely correct, I hadn't thought of that. I removed the "guessing".

I agree, the API is not perfect. I had thought about the "vertices must be strings" issue and do have some ideas for a workaround to leave it aside for now.

Thanks again!!!!

The only "unique" aspect in the method causing the error is the pointers passed to the GLPK library function. This is the only function where the pointer of two parameters is defined like "x*sizeof(double) + y*sizeof(long)" - and these two values are causing the errors. All other pointers are defined like "x*sizeof(double)". Therefore I suspect that "sizeof(long)" is causing the errors.

I therefore redefined the "c_v_data" structure so the <long> value is the last value. This now allows all pointers to be defined as "x*sizeof(double)", i.e. without sizeof long. In addition defined the field in the data structure as "long" and not as "int".

Hopefully this removes the failure in the test on a Solaris. Due to the lack of a solaris machine I cannot verify this myself, therefore I tried to explain the reasoning behind the changes I did.

Why don't you think it was just caused by the fact that "cut" used to be of "int" type in the structure's definition, and seemed to be counted as "sizeof(long)" int `glp_cpp` ?

Besides, if this line (the call to `glp_cpp`) has to be changed, wouldn't others need to be changed too ?

You are probably right, just to be on the safe side I did both ;-)

Yes of course, I changed "glp_maxflow_ffalg" call too, which I did. All other function calls are not affected as they do not need the affected fields of the structure.
