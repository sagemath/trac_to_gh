# Issue 34240: one-letter typo in docstring of Sets.ParentMethods.algebra()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34477

Original creator: @DaveWitteMorris

Original creation time: 2022-09-01 19:47:11

In the docstring of `sage.categories.sets_cat.Sets.ParentMethods.algebra()`, `self` is "a parent `S`". However, this parent is erroneously called `G` at one point.

Thanks! I hadn't noticed that mistake. I fixed it (and also rebased and squashed the two commits).
