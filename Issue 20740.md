From Polymake SPKG.txt (#20892):

Should convert this old-style Sage package:
- qhull

Software that currently would need to be installed manually (no Sage package
available) for a more featureful Polymake installation:
- azove,
- porta,
- vinci,
- SplitsTree4,
- bliss (needs Debian patches; can't use the existing old-style Sage package -- #20901)

It does seem a bit like we're duplicating Debian packaging... In any case, patches can be lifted from there or other distributions.

bliss is a part of Sage, as an optional package. Although it currently installs as a static library only. I don't know in which form it is needed by polymake.

Right, I've deleted "old-style" in the description. See #20901 for details.
