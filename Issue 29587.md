This should be ready to go now.

I have moved the creation of pari data from L-functions to Dirichlet characters file.

And fixed this conversion by the way.

I will look at it later today.  It would be nice to have an explanation of why some of the numbers output by doctests have changed.

Concerning the changed numbers : apparently the conversion of Dirichlet characters was not working correctly, so the L-function was computed for another character. I checked the new values purely in pari, and they are now correct.

Looks good to me.  

One day we might include Bober's pip-installable package https://github.com/jwbober/conrey-dirichlet-characters.   At that time, somce of the code in https://github.com/JohnCremona/CMFs/blob/master/sage-pari/char.py might be useful.
