CC:  @williamstein

Keywords: matrices, documentation,

It claims to take a list of triples `(i, j, entry in row i and column j)`, but it actually takes a dictionary `(i, j): entry in row i and column j`.

I have fixed the error where it appears (integer, rational and mod-n matrices). It would also be good to copy this documentation to other classes where it makes sense.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17245

They are ignored indeed, but it the safe direction: the code acts if both `copy` and `coerce` are True.

```

+                           an integer.  The ``i,j`` entry of ``self`` is
+                           set to ``x``.  The ``x``'s can be ``0``.
+                         * Alternatively, entries can be a list of *all*
