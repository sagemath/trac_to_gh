I believe you can just replace this:

```diff
-        def precompose_map(supp):
-            return support_map(supp)
-        module_morphism = self.module_morphism(precompose_map,
+        module_morphism = self.module_morphism(support_map,
                                                codomain=codomain)
```

Otherwise LGTM.
