# Issue 18769: transcendental functions of polynomial

Following #19005 we use flint functions for `exp`/`log`/`sin`/... of polynomials. This only concerns polynomials over `QQ` (for which the flint type is `fmpq_poly`).

* Keeping with the discussion at #19005, what would you think of renaming the new methods to `_exp_series`, etc.?

* I believe the restrictions on the constant terms should be documented (as far as I understand the TESTS blocks of docstrings are not considered part of the documentation).

Typos:
* “Transcendemtal functions” in `fmpq_poly.pxd`
* “truncanted series” in `polynomial_rational_flint.pyx`

I implemented three of your remarks.

The restriction is part of the definition of the series. The type of errors might be documented though. But as these are private function (ie intended for programmers) with very short code it is easy to find out what these are.

Not really: for example, `(1+x).exp_series()` might very well return `exp(1) + exp(1)*x + 1/2*exp(1)*x^2 + ...`. But I agree that it is less of an issue if the methods are private.

Not transcendentals, but presumably fmpq_poly_sqrt_series and fmpq_poly_invsqrt_series would fit this ticket too?

Note that these have an artificial restriction in flint right now: the constant term is required to be 1, but of course any perfect square could be allowed by extracting this constant factor.

lgtm, but needs rebase (since #19005 was rebased)
