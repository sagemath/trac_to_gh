The behavior of `for x in iter(cartesian_product([RR, RR])): print(x)` has changed with this ticket, I think in an improvement. Old version:

```
sage: for x in iter(cartesian_product([RR, RR])): print(x)
/Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/git/sage/src/sage/categories/sets_cat.py:2300: UserWarning: Sage is not able to determine whether the factors of this Cartesian product are finite. The lexicographic ordering might not go through all elements.
  warn("Sage is not able to determine whether the factors of "

----> 1 for x in iter(cartesian_product([RR, RR])): print(x)

```

New version:

```
