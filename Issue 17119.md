CC:  @nathanncohen

`meet_matrix()` and `join_matrix()` were moved from posets to lattices. I forgot to add `from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation` to functions in `posets.py`. Sorry!

Oops. Right `:-/`

Turns out the function was only called on lattices, which is a rather good sign.

I don't think it is worth adding a doctest as the function will be removed asap.
