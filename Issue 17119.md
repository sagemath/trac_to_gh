# Issue 17119: Deprecation error in poset join_matrix

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17356

`meet_matrix()` and `join_matrix()` were moved from posets to lattices. I forgot to add `from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation` to functions in `posets.py`. Sorry!

This would also be done by #17354, if you review it..

Oops. Right `:-/`

Turns out the function was only called on lattices, which is a rather good sign.

I don't think it is worth adding a doctest as the function will be removed asap.
