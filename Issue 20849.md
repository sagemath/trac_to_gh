1. You need to check for errors in `spkg-install` (in particular, the `mv` commands).

2. You can replace

```

if [ -d ${TARGET} ]
then
	echo "REMOVING PREVIOUS VERSION"
    rm -rf ${TARGET}
fi
```

by

```
rm -rf ${TARGET}
```


3. I don't like this error handling:

```
         try:
             coeff_list = _dbz_to_integer_list(modpol)
        except IOError:
            raise KeyError("No database entry for modular polynomial of level %s"%level)
```


I think it would be better to raise the error directly in `_dbz_to_integer_list` and then only if the file really cannot be opened. If the error is raised while reading the file, it should be propagated as `IOError`. I also think that `KeyError` is not really appropriate, since it's not a key. I would prefer `LookupError`.

Could you provide the commands available to check the data in the package?

What do you think about using pari and deprecate the database?

Maybe you should ask the PARI developers (are you currently in Bordeaux?)

> What do you think about using pari

This already happens. The database is no longer used by anything else in Sage.

> and deprecate the database?

I don't think this is needed. It is still useful to avoid long computations if you need the large polynomials.

You didn't fix this:

1. You need to check for errors in `spkg-install` (in particular, the `mv` commands).

Another detail (feel free to fix this or not): I don't think that the extra arguments to `__getitem__` are useful:

```
def __getitem__(self, disc, level=1, var='x'):
```

I would change this to

```
def __getitem__(self, disc):
```
