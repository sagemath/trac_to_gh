I don't see why it would need Sphinx 1.8.3. The only change relevant to #26451 (the new sphinx) was to replace SageNB's sphinxify to just use `sage.misc.sphinxify`. So SageNB should remain compatible with whatever the Sage library is using, rather than having code duplication (and code divergence) between the two.

In any case, I'm building and running doctests now.

All tests pass for me with sphinx 1.7.6 and sphinx 1.8.3. The legacy notebook appears to work, and docstrings look nice, so I think the sphinxify function is working properly.
