I don't think there is anything we can do there except for migrating to github.

If only there was a way to query a JSON endpoint like https://api.github.com/repos/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/actions/workflows/build.yml/runs?branch=u/mkoeppe/remove_use_of_sage_lib_in_sage_misc&status=in_progress

Looks like we have momentum to do the transition to GH, so we can close this
