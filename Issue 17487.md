# Issue 17487: Rename PowerSeries.reversion() in PowerSeries.reverse()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17724

Original creator: bruno

Original creation time: 2015-02-03 17:28:11

Keywords: reverse, series

The method `PowerSeries.reversion(self)` returns the reverse power series of `self`. Following the apparent naming convention, I propose to rename it `PowerSeries.reverse(self)`. 

It is more consistent with other method such as (for `PowerSeries`): `derivative()` (not `derivation`) or `truncate()` (not `truncation`).
