There a decision to take: method `hyperbolicity` sorts the vertices of the output.
As this method is not yet exposed in `Graph` and that the sorted list of vertices has only 4 vertices, we can just remove this sorting. Do you agree ?

LGTM modulo

```diff
@@ -361,10 +361,18 @@ cdef tuple hyperbolicity_basic_algorithm(int N,
 def _greedy_dominating_set(H, verbose=False):
     r"""
     Returns a greedy approximation of a dominating set
+
+    EXAMPLES:
+
+        sage: from sage.graphs.hyperbolicity import _greedy_dominating_set
+        sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
+        sage: _greedy_dominating_set(G)
+        [0, 2, 6]
     """
```

should be `EXAMPLES::`

```
-    if len(certificate) == 0:
+    if not len(certificate):
```

could be simply `if not certificate` and

```diff
-raise ValueError("algorithm '%s' not yet implemented. Please contribute" %(algorithm))
+raise ValueError("algorithm '%s' not yet implemented, please contribute" %(algorithm))
```

for sentence syntax.

Once changed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

This should be re-targeted for 8.5.
