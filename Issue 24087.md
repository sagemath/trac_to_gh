From an untested example in `src/sage/combinat/dyck_word.py`:

```
sage: D = DyckWord([1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0])
sage: DyckWords.options.display="lattice"
sage: D
[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
sage: DyckWords.options(diagram_style="line")
sage: D
[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
```

I should be able to fix this, but I won't be able to get to it likely for a few days.

oh, well, this can wait for the next release (or rather the next beta), and who knows when this will happen.. We have already more than 105 positive reviewed tickets waiting for some of them since 5 weeks..
