Assignee: tbd

Currently (Sage 5.7.beta3) on `OpenSuse 12.2` with gcc version 4.7.1 20120723 the CHomP package (version chomp-20100213.p2) can't be installed.

The following (trivial) changes are needed to compile:

* change 'erase' to 'this->erase' in 'include/capd/homologicalAlgebra/ChainT.h'
* change 'containsPixel' to 'this->containsPixel' in 'include/capd/bitSet/CubSetT.hpp'

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14076

Its a bit of a variant of #14578: caching for mutable objects is fragile. Its difficult to get right, and even if you do you'll break it when you make changes in the future.

The right thing to do is to make cell complexes immutable, and `add_face` / `remove_face` return new cell complexes. With an `add_faces` analogue to add multiple faces in one go to avoid performance issues. Bonus: the cell complexes can then be parents for chains. Thoughts?

Regarding "With #14595 this leads to the following doctest failure --- which notation do we prefer for the homology groups?" I have a slight preference for
