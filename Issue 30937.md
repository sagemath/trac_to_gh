I'm not sure how to improve the description of the `seed` parameter with respect coding style.

```
    - ``seed`` -- a ``random.Random`` seed or a Python ``int`` for the random
      number generator (default: ``None``)
```

I would do

```
    - ``seed`` -- (optional) a ``random.Random`` seed or a Python ``int``
      for the random number generator
```

All of your other changes LGTM. Whether you decide to change it or not, you can set this to a positive review.
