# Issue 12918: Make LinearCode take minimum distance as a parameter

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: minimum distance

For some codes, the minimum distance is a known parameter. For instance, for Reed-Solomon code, Hamming code, Golay code, etc. For these cases, making Sage compute the minimum distance is quite a wasted effort.

I am introducing a patch which does the following
1. adds an extra parameter `d=None` to `LinearCode`. If `d` is provided, then the minimum distance of the code is set to `d`.
2. An extra attribute `self.__distance` is introduced which stores the distance. If `d` is not provided during the initialization of the class and if the minimum distance has already been computed before, then the computed value is stored in `d` so that it does not need to be recomputed the next time it is called.
3. To force recomputation of the distance, if desired, `LinearCode.minimum_distance()` takes the parameter `algorithm="gap"`.

Good, but could you please insert references to the distance data you are plugging in? E.g. I have no clue where to look for the minimum distance of toric codes...
You could insert some (#long time) tests to check your claims for particular values...

I haven't touched the toric codes. The ones I specified the distance to are (in order): `BinaryGolayCode`, `HammingCode`, `ReedSolomonCode`, `TernaryGolayCode` and `WalshCode`. For these the distance is already present in the documentation of the function. I can make some long tests which force the computation of the distance.

Looks like I missed the `ExtendedBinaryGolayCode`, `ExtendedTernaryGolayCode`. I will update the patch with the distances from those codes.

Updated the patch to include the Extended Golay codes, and with additional long time doctests.
