Keywords: Galois group decomposition permutation

Decomposition groups are sometimes represented as permutation groups on the wrong number of elements:

```
sage: L.<c> = NumberField(x^2 + 1)
sage: G = L.galois_group()
sage: P = L.primes_above(5)[0]
sage: H = G.decomposition_group(P)
sage: G.domain()
{1, 2}
sage: H.domain()
{1}               # should be {1, 2}
```

This causes

```
sage: G.artin_symbol(P)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
PariError: incorrect type in permtopol [permutation] (t_VECSMALL)
```
