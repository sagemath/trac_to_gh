For the new package `auditwheel_or_delocate`, it seems that potentially both are used on Linux, only `delocate` on OS X. If that's right, then the `SPKG.rst` should be modified. 

Installing `auditwheel` via pip also installs `pyelftools`, and `patchelf` is listed as a dependency on the PyPI page. Do we need to create a new package `pyelftools`, too? Is `patchelf` really required, or is it only necessary if one is trying to fix files, not just detect whether they're broken?

The comment "and delete the rest" does not seem to be accurate (and I think it's fine not to delete the old stamp files here).

Not needed - that's what makes optional "pip" packages so convenient.

Right, it's only needed for repairing wheels. But it's best not try to circumvent the declared dependencies. 

The scipy upgrade (#34081) will bring a patchelf, by the way.
