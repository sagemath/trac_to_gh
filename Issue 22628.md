Hello,

I had some troubles with my laptop recently, I need to recompile Sage... Which will obviously take a while :). I'll review this as soon as my compilation completes.

Best,

David

No problem - it took me a while to figure out how to use git and trac anyway. Thanks again.

Quick comments. I will let David handle the main review:

- Use your real name in the author block.

- You need a blank line after these: ```codes_catalog.py`` (continued)::`
