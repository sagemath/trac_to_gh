I guess these warnings should be addressed.

I'm puzzled. In some instances of the compiler warnings, an int is compared with a size_t. So, I changed declarations so that only int with int or size_t with size_t are compared.

However, it didn't fix the problem. Also, in some of the warnings, the comparison was between size_t and size_t.

So, can please someone explain to me what causes the compiler warning?
