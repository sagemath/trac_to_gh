The line

```
            sage: os.environ['SAGE_PEXPECT_LOG'] = "1"
```

which appears twice in `sage/doctest/forker.py` turns on logging for `pexpect`, and this results in two files being created in `DOTSAGE/pexpect_logs` every time you doctest this file.

Doctests pass after deleting these lines. Do we

- keep it as is?
- delete the lines?
- keep the lines but use a temporary `DOTSAGE`?
