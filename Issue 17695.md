Why did you add `sage/databases/sql_db` here, there is also a database section in the reference manual?

`sage/misc/superseded` occurs twice.

Then there is a separate section about lazy stuff, so all lazy stuff should go in there.

The `AUTHORS` blocks should be formatted like [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files).

You should only use `::` to show code blocks, not for example here

```
    Databases are constructed via a triple indexed dictionary called a
    skeleton. A skeleton should be constructed to fit the following format::

    - skeleton -- a triple-indexed dictionary
```


Finally: `db.py` is completely deprecated and shouldn't be in the manual. `refcount.pyx` and `file_to_worksheet.py` don't really do anything, are unused and should probably be removed completely.

A merge mistake... And I was sure I had checked this line specifically `:-//`

I wanted to do that later as well. But fine.

But why shouldn't they be in the manual as long as the code is there (and the docs clearly say that `db.py` is deprecated)?

There are two cases:

1. people who already use the deprecated code don't need the manual since they manage to use the code without the manual.

2. people who do not use that code should not start using this deprecated code, so why should they see it in the manual?

OK, now really reviewing this.

1. I am not too happy with the unstructured `src/doc/en/reference/misc/index.rst`, for example, why aren't `cython`, `cython_c` and `inline_fortran` together, what is `sage/ext/memory` doing there...? Perhaps you're simply trying to lump too many things together.

2. `sage/misc/sage_input` is duplicated.

3. `sage/misc/derivative` looks like it should be in calculus (no idea why the module isn't)

4. Please rebase to 6.7.beta0: `sage/ext/gen_interpreters` moved to `sage_setup/autogen/interpreters`

5. I would like to see `sage/misc/typecheck` and `sage/structure/element_verify` removed (unused modules)

6. `sage` -> `Sage`

7. I think we can remove the `WRONG (for now) docs` which have been wrong for over 6 years...

8. Many new `INPUT` blocks are badly formatted, the correct formatting is

```
INPUT:

- ``metadata`` -- The metadata_by_opname from a wrapper module
```


9. I think this comment can be removed:

```
TODO:

This stuff probably belongs somewhere like sage/misc/misc_c.pyx.
The only reason it's in its own file here is because of some circular cimport
problems (can't cimport Integer to sage/misc/misc_c.pyx). For further
discussion see

I agree in principle, but do these changes really need to be done here? I would prefer to first get all modules included in the reference manual and then organize the tables of contents and modernize the docstrings.

Regarding `sage.ext.memory`, I don't really know where to put it, do you see a better place?

I think you should do a little more effort regarding this point:

Replying to [comment:37 jdemeyer]:
> 1. I am not too happy with the unstructured `src/doc/en/reference/misc/index.rst`, for example, why aren't `cython`, `cython_c` and `inline_fortran` together, what is `sage/ext/memory` doing there...? Perhaps you're simply trying to lump too many things together.

When you're adding new modules to the documentation, at least add them in meaningful places.
For example, there are various modules about calling external code (`cython`, `cython_c` and `inline_fortran`, `python`, `sh`). These should be put together.

Also low-level stuff (like `ext/memory`, `fpickle`, `c3`,...) should be put together.

I though your answer in comment:41 was about that point too.

Ok, I can do a first pass on the table of contents in this ticket if you insist, but not right now.

The table of contents looks a lot better now! Maybe not perfect, but I like it.

You missed this:

Also, can you remove the periods from module descriptions, e.g. `Relational (sqlite) Databases Module.` -> `Relational (sqlite) Databases`

Please remove `media/channels` from the doc since it doesn't have *any* documentation at all.
