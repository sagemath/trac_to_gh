```
sage: P = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: x = P["x"]
sage: P.set_max(x, 0)
sage: print P.get_max(x)
None
```


The problem is that GLPK backend has `value = False` default parameter with a test `value == False` later on and zero is equal to false. `None` has to be used instead!

Why are there "numerical" and "linear programming" components?.. "numerical" always confused me as a choice for the directory name...
