This is with the Cygwin system gcc 4.5.3.  Perhaps it would work better with the Sage one, but I won't have the chance to try this in the near future.

Same with Sage's GCC.

Ok, it's just because we're looking for a .so file but gcc produces a .dll one.

That's simple enough, I'll try that out.

Works, great!
