1. Clearly document and test that `--optional` tags and options are case-insensitive.

2. `--show-skipped` never mentions skipped `sage` tests.

3. Check for invalid `--optional` arguments (basically, anything that isn't alphanumeric).

In the developer's guide, in `conventions.rst`, it says

```
      Any words after ``# optional`` are
      interpreted as a list of package names, separated by spaces.
      Any punctuation (periods, commas, hyphens, semicolons, ...)
      after the first word ends the list of packages.
      Hyphens or colons between the word ``optional`` and the first
      package name are allowed.
      Also, all text is converted to lower case.
```

So the case-insensitivity is mentioned, but could be emphasized more.
