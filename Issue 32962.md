same issue several times in `b/src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py` like

```diff
@@ -22848,7 +22849,8 @@ class GenericGraph(GenericGraph_pyx):
             G2 = other
             partition2 = other_vertices
         G_to = {u: i for i,u in enumerate(self_vertices)}
-        from sage.graphs.all import Graph, DiGraph
+        from sage.graphs.graph import Graph
+        from sage.graphs.digraph import Digraph
```

and also in `b/src/sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/refinement_graphs.pyx`
