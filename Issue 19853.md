# Issue 19853: implement asec/acsc series at infinity

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2016-02-21 08:54:31

The known series for `asec`/`acsc` are not implemented:

```
sage: asec(x).series(x==oo)
(arcsec(+Infinity)) + Order(+Infinity)
sage: acsc(x).series(x==oo)
(arccsc(+Infinity)) + Order(+Infinity)
```

This would be possibly in a next Pynac version. If so, this ticket should doctest that.
