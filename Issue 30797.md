We should be able to automate this using

```
./sage -package download --allow-upstream :all:
```

followed by 

```
./sage -package upload :all:
```

... if someone is able to set up the necessary credentials for the workflow.

There is at least an info section missing here https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html, so that people are warned when adding new packages.

However, I would prefer it the other way around, even though it is annoying: Have a small sentence in SPKG.rst that we may redistribute. This would be more fool-proof.

Good idea.

I disagree. We make free software here; the non-distributable case is an exception for rare cases.

It does not have to be foolproof. We have the review process that so far seems to have successfully stopped people from adding proprietary packages.

If you are interested in adding structured license info to `build/pkgs/`... see #21571.
