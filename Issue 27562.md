            sage: def f(z):
            ....:     return z/(1-z)
            sage: B.coefficients_of_generating_function(f, (1,), precision=3)
```

Reports `O(0)`, but one cannot get around this. By specifying an error term, this would work.

If I see this correctly, the currently remaining pyflakes warnings are also taken care of due to #27759, so the patchbot is happy.

The changes in the code look good to me. (And I've run into the same issue before, so thanks for fixing!)
