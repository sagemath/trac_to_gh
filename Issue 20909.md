# Issue 20909: Building the doc produces deprecation warning

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21146

Original creator: vdelecroix

When building the doc we got

```
[dochtml] [plotting ] <string>:7: DeprecationWarning: Use of vertex_colors=<string> is deprecated, use vertex_color=<string> and/or vertex_colors=<dict>.
[dochtml] [plotting ] See http://trac.sagemath.org/21048 for details.
```

(of course due to #21048). Would be better to fix it.

May take more than 10 days for me to review this.

Don't we have patchbot plugin for there kind of errors?
