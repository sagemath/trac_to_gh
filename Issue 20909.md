When building the doc we got

```
[dochtml] [plotting ] <string>:7: DeprecationWarning: Use of vertex_colors=<string> is deprecated, use vertex_color=<string> and/or vertex_colors=<dict>.
[dochtml] [plotting ] See http://trac.sagemath.org/21048 for details.
```

(of course due to #21048). Would be better to fix it.
