With `u/mkoeppe/sagelib__add_setup_cfg__install_requires_` applied, I get a different error

Make sure you're either building from a fully intact git repository or PyPI tarballs. Most other sources (such as GitHub's tarballs, a git checkout without the .git folder) don't contain the necessary metadata and will not work.

For example, if you're using pip, instead of https://github.com/user/proj/archive/master.zip use git+https://github.com/user/proj.git#egg=proj

    Make sure you're either building from a fully intact git repository or PyPI tarballs. Most other sources (such as GitHub's tarballs, a git checkout without the .git folder) don't contain the necessary metadata and will not work.

    For example, if you're using pip, instead of https://github.com/user/proj/archive/master.zip use git+https://github.com/user/proj.git#egg=proj

Don't take this as authoritative, but based on the experience in https://github.com/mathics/Mathics/issues/1169#issuecomment-806532433 mpmath 1.2.x may be necessary. (Or it that seemed to be the case for mpmath on the Fedora distribution.) 

But I also suspect it is not sufficient because mpmath has code, which seems to go back for a long time, that special cases when the "backend" is sage.
