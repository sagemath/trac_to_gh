All this documentation was pretty outdated, and some formats were missing.

I also tried to make it easier to read/parse, by displaying at the beginning of the INPUT blocks the different formats (and not just by giving their names).

In particular, I do not think that it is very important to burden the users with a 'format' flag in most cases, when there is no ambiguity. However, when the input is a matrix and the behaviour depends on its properties, it is advertised.

A lot of documentation is also removed: some of it is replaced by links toward dedicated modules (i.e. 'how to access the graph catalog') or simply removed: the `__init__` entry in th reference manual is no place to explain how to compute connected components.

There is still a lot of verbosity in this module, and in particular all the file formats *also* appear in the module's documentation (and are, of course, outdated). This will be for later.

One of the points of this branch is also to ease maintainability: when the same things are documented in different places at once, we forget to update all of it when it would be needed. Short, and to the point: that's a reference manual, not a tutorial.

Hellooooooo!

Sorry if I am not very active in these tickets, but I'm quite busy in these days...

Just to say that when I inserted `igraph`, the variable `vertex_labels` was already there, and I only used it in my code. Indeed, you can find examples (written before igraph) where this variable was used (for instance, in `cliques_get_max_clique_graph`).

Though, I have no idea what it was used for! The comment in the code before my modifications was:

```
    -  ``vertex_labels`` - only for implementation == 'c_graph'.
       Whether to allow any object as a vertex (slower), or
       only the integers 0, ..., n-1, where n is the number of vertices.
```
Hope this helps!

Michele

Okay okay. I write these tickets because I want to have some `Graph(filename)` constructor in order to not meet again this problem I had with your .nde files.

In `cliques_get_max_clique_graph` it seems to be an argument of `.show()` (to display the labels) not an argument of `Graph.__init__`. In the constructor, the only occurrence of this `vertex_labels` argument is in the igraph code. If it is user anywhere else, well, it is actually ignored. It is not very bad anyway, just something that has to be done.

For me the patch is good to go, but you will certainly have to rebase it on last beta first.
