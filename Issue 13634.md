The current implementation of `KleberTree` is only valid for the simply laced types. This ticket will implement the virtual Kleber algorithm and thus expand `KleberTree` to generate rigged configurations for all affine types.

Hi Travis,

It would be good if you could implement the tensor product multiplicity (and please call it tensor_product_multiplicity) which is formula (3.2) of http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9809087.pdf in order to check that the code is giving the correct output. For nonsimply-laced types it would be the virtual analogue of this formula. The Kleber tree gives the admissible partitions, but to get the multiplicity one needs to sum over the product of binomial coefficients.

Hey Anne,

Here's the new version with the changes we've discussed (via e-mail/in person) along with a method `latex_options()` for controlling the latex output. I also think it's okay for the virtual Kleber tree to accept simply-laced types as input and for them to not compare as equal (since they are different mathematical constructions because we consider it as a folded type). I've documented this behavior.

Thank you for doing the review,

Travis

Hi Travis,

If you want to allow for simply-laced input in the VirtualKleberTree, don't you want to select all nodes and bracket them in the output? Otherwise the behavior is different from the simply-laced and non-simply-laced types. If it is really just the same as the usual KleberTree, then why not make them equal in this case?

Best,

Anne
