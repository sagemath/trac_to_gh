The current implementation of `KleberTree` is only valid for the simply laced types. This ticket will implement the virtual Kleber algorithm and thus expand `KleberTree` to generate rigged configurations for all affine types.

Hi Travis,

Hey Anne,

Here's the new version with the changes we've discussed (via e-mail/in person) along with a method `latex_options()` for controlling the latex output. I also think it's okay for the virtual Kleber tree to accept simply-laced types as input and for them to not compare as equal (since they are different mathematical constructions because we consider it as a folded type). I've documented this behavior.

Thank you for doing the review,

Hi Travis,

If you want to allow for simply-laced input in the VirtualKleberTree, don't you want to select all nodes and bracket them in the output? Otherwise the behavior is different from the simply-laced and non-simply-laced types. If it is really just the same as the usual KleberTree, then why not make them equal in this case?

Best,

Anne
