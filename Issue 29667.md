# Issue 29667: Broken double description of hypercube

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29904

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2020-06-19 20:30:24

Turns out the double description of the hypercube after #28866 is not set up incorrectly.

This wasn't detected due to a meaningless doctest.


```
sage: intervals = [[-2,2]]
sage: polytopes.hypercube(1, intervals)
A 0-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^1 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex
```

We really need to turn off the fake randomness by default in doctests. I've missed so many bugs in exactly the same way.

I agree. I just posted about this on sage-devel.
