# Issue 13262: Listing elements in Cartesian Products for Sets

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: chrisjamesberg

Original creation time: 2012-09-06 16:13:41

Assignee: Chris Berg

Keywords: Cartesian Product

Right now, CartesianProduct has no attribute 'list'. One would like to be able to index the elements of a Cartesian product. For instance:


```
S = Set([1,2])
C = S.cartesian_product(S)
C.list()
```

> {{{

works.

Those are different objects, and yes, it is somewhat confusion (I believe there's a ticket already about/related to this). So there is something to be fixed here.
