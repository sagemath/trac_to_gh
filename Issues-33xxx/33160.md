A priori, no need to clean any package afterwards, the bot will just re-build any anterior version when testing another ticket. I can see a problem only when we ask the patchbot to build immediatly a different version of the same package with the same number. This should not happen so often.

There is no more pynac spkg. It's merged into sagelib,
and lives in src/sage/symbolic/ginac/ and in src/sage/symbolic/

Could it be that some cython `# distutils:` declarations for dependent libfactory are missing somewhere

Cygwin build went through (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/2618873352). There are currently numerous severe issues in the doctests (#34127), but nothing that appears to be related to Singular.

Linux/macOS tests ran at https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/2618873340, looking fine

So let's get this in.
