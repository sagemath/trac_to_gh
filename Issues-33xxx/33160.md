A priori, no need to clean any package afterwards, the bot will just re-build any anterior version when testing another ticket. I can see a problem only when we ask the patchbot to build immediatly a different version of the same package with the same number. This should not happen so often.

Anyhow, a package upgrade must cause rebuild of everything that depends on it (e.g. sagelib in this case, and sagelib is not rebuilt (thus the error - libfactory-4.2.1, something from the older Singular version, is not found)).

There is no more pynac spkg. It's merged into sagelib,
and lives in src/sage/symbolic/ginac/ and in src/sage/symbolic/

Could it be that some cython `# distutils:` declarations for dependent libfactory are missing somewhere
there?  (it used to be taken care by the deps of pynac, cf. e.g. https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/9.4/build/pkgs/pynac/dependencies).

By the way if any Singular experts can chime in at #33327
(in multivariate polynomial rings over QQbar, when factoring,
any variable named "c" gets renamed "`@`c", leading to an error).

Cygwin build went through (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/2618873352). There are currently numerous severe issues in the doctests (#34127), but nothing that appears to be related to Singular.

Linux/macOS tests ran at https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/2618873340, looking fine

So let's get this in.
