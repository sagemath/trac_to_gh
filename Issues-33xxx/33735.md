We remove some documents from the reference manual. The corresponding Python files were deprecated in previous tickets, and as part of the deprecation, most of the content and all of the documentation was removed. See [sage.symbolic.getitem](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/calculus/sage/symbolic/getitem.html) for a typical example. These pages now result in a useless page in the reference manual and a message `Warning: Missing title for sage.symbolic.getitem` when creating the documentation. This happens for the pages 
- `sage.libs.pynac.pynac`,  `sage.symbolic.getitem`, and `sage.symbolic.constants_c` (from #32386)
- `sage.finance.time_series` (from #32427)

For a future ticket: we need to remember to remove pages from the reference manual when currently deprecated modules/packages are actually removed, in particular `sage.media`, `sage.finance`, and `sage.structure.graphics_file`. These currently produce warning messages during docbuilding, but there is actual content in the documentation, so we keep them in place.

Other warnings which could be investigated:

```
DeprecationWarning: Passing a schema to Validator.iter_errors is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Call validator.evolve(schema=new_schema).iter_errors(...) instead.
```
and

```
[IPKernelApp] WARNING | debugpy_stream undefined, debugging will not be enabled
```
and

```
FutureWarning: EllipticCurveHom_composite is experimental code.
See https://trac.sagemath.org/32744 for details.
```
and

```
...../sage/plot/contour_plot.py:206: 
UserWarning: No contour levels were found within the data range.
[plotting ]   CS = subplot.contour(self.xy_data_array, contours, cmap=cmap,
```
This was introduced intentionally in #21042, I think, but should we silence the warning?

Depends on #33738

All I am thinking is having a title of something like:\n\n```\n\"\"\"\nMedia (deprecated)\n\"\"\"\n```\nNothing else is needed beyond this (other than possibly adding a ref to the deprecating ticket).\n\n> That is, I prefer my approach. If you want to create docstrings for those files, I think it's a waste of time, but don't let that stop you.\n\nThese docstrings last a bit longer on the the Sage doc since they only get updated between major versions. Thus, it is possible it lasts longer than the files within beta versions of Sage.\n\nUnfortunately I don't have my computer with me for the next few days.

I was thinking of the former case. Files with truely no content should be deleted altogether, but I am guessing you mean no docstring content. All I am thinking is having a title of something like:

```
"""
Media (deprecated)
"""
```
Nothing else is needed beyond this (other than possibly adding a ref to the deprecating ticket).

> That is, I prefer my approach. If you want to create docstrings for those files, I think it's a waste of time, but don't let that stop you.

These docstrings last a bit longer on the the Sage doc since they only get updated between major versions. Thus, it is possible it lasts longer than the files within beta versions of Sage.

Unfortunately I don't have my computer with me for the next few days. I won't be able to push something until Sunday.

Good, that makes sense.

> Files with truely no content should be deleted altogether, but I am guessing you mean no docstring content.

The pages I'm currently removing from the reference manual come from Python files that look like, for example (`symbolic/getitem.py`):

```
from sage.misc.lazy_import import lazy_import
lazy_import('sage.symbolic.expression',
            ['normalize_index_for_doctests', 'OperandsWrapper', 'restore_op_wrapper'],
            deprecation=32386)
```
(That's the entire file.)

> All I am thinking is having a title of something like:

> Nothing else is needed beyond this (other than possibly adding a ref to the deprecating ticket).

That could be done on this ticket or on a future ticket. Could the deprecation function somehow take care of this automatically, when you're deprecating a module or a package?

Anyway, as of now:
- `sage.media.wav` already has a line in its top-level docstring saying "This module (and all of sage.media) is deprecated."
- `sage.structure.graphics_file` has no such message.
- `sage.finance` doesn't have any such messages, either. 

We could change the reference manual `.rst` files instead:

IMO, we want the files there with the title in the documentation (and a deprecation message) because we should be documenting all of our files and changes. Even though it is deprecated, I don’t think it is good for a project to have “hidden” files.

This should be done on this ticket IMO as adding it back on.a future ticket would effectively be reverting this one.

I would argue that those files (other than `all.py`, which are special and we have some general guidelines, or at least practices/conventions, about those) should be included in the reference manual. They are describing Sage’s functionality in a public-facing way. In this case, these files were previously there, but they would be apparently disappearing without a deprecation from that perspective.
