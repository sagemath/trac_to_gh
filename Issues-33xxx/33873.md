We extend the scripts `sage-get-system-packages` and `sage-print-system-package-command`: 

- When `system=auto`, they now invoke `sage-guess-package-system`.

- `sage-print-system-package-command` gets a new option `--spkg`; then it invokes `sage-get-system-packages`.

This simplifies some uses.

I think this does not actually invoke the package scripts at all, but you can do `tox -e local-root-standard` and wait for the error from not being root

These tox environments are primarily for use on containers to install system packages. It's not intended to be user-facing.
