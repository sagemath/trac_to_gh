`lrslib` is optional, so it will not be installed unless you use `configure --enable-lrslib` (or install the package explicitly using `sage -i lrslib`).

That the doctest is tested anyway is an interesting new behavior introduced by #32174. It finds system `lrslib` at runtime via `sage.features.lrs`

Is it a good thing or a bad thing?

Also, I notice that lrslib appears both as an optional package and as a feature to be detected:

```
Using --optional=4ti2,bliss,build,cbc,ccache,cryptominisat,database_symbolic_data,debian,debugpy,dochtml,dot2tex,e_antic,fricas,glucose,latte_int,lidia,lrslib,normaliz,notedown,pandoc_attributes,pip,pycosat,pynormaliz,rst2ipynb,rubiks,sage,sage_numerical_backends_coin,sage_spkg
Features to be detected: 4ti2,benzene,bliss,buckygen,conway_polynomials,csdp,database_cremona_ellcurve,database_cremona_mini_ellcurve,database_jones_numfield,database_knotinfo,dvipng,ffmpeg,graphviz,imagemagick,jupymake,kenzo,latte_int,lrslib,mcqd,meataxe,pandoc,pdf2svg,plantri,pynormaliz,rubiks,sage.combinat,sage.geometry.polyhedron,sage.graphs,sage.plot,sage.rings.number_field,sage.rings.real_double,sage.symbolic,sage_numerical_backends_coin,tdlib
```

But at the end, lrslib does not appear:

```
Features detected for doctesting: 
```
Therefore, in my case, lrslib tests are run because it is an optional package that I haved installed:

```
$ sage -optional | grep lrs
lrslib..................................071b+autotools-2021-07-13 (071b+autotools-2021-07-13)
```

In my case, tests passed with and without the branch. Why needs work?

It should not happen. Sage knows that my system lrslib is not compatible with my Sage installation, so the optional tests should not be run with an incompatible lrslib version (note that I have not installed the optional package). I do not know how to solve this, though.

> In my case, tests passed with and without the branch. Why needs work?


The branch makes the tests pass, but actually does not solve the underlying problem.

If the `lrslib` that is available on your machine is not functional, you should be able to find an example where it does not behave correctly and you can add this example to the list of examples checked in the method `is_functional` so that `is_functional()` returns `False`. This will imply that the doctests marked with tag `lrslib` will not be run on your machine.

Independently of the doctesting behavior – if I use lrslib functionality at runtime, why does Sage not raise an error telling me to install the optional package first? Is it safe to just use it without checking? I know nothing about lrslib, to be honest.

I think it is because it checks whether `lrs` command exists in the `sage -sh` environment which is a union of command from sage and from your system. Since the feature `lrs` is found there, it does not tell you to install it.

> Is it safe to just use it without checking? 


A check *is* done in the `is_functional` method. (Maybe the goal of this ticket is to update this method.)

> I know nothing about lrslib, to be honest. 


Me neither.

> For some interfaces such as Macaulay2, it is usually not necessary to check the concrete version that is installed, but I am not sure about optional packages. Especially due to the gmp/flint dependency, as seen in[comment:3](#comment%3A3).


One option is to change the feature `lrs` which is currently written as an executable `class Lrs(Executable)` and modify it into just feature that checks the presence of the optional package. I let someone else more knowledgeable on lrs than me decides here.

No, this is not a step in a good direction. Note that our build system does not record at all whether an optional system package is available. The point of going through `Feature`s is that it also works on both system packages and SPKGs.

I would suggest to:
- check whether lrslib 070 works correctly (perhaps in one of our previous tickets this is already commented on, I don't recall) and if so, relax the tests in `build/pkgs/lrslib/spkg-configure.m4` so that they accept this version
- run equivalents of the tests made by `spkg-configure.m4` in the `lrs` Feature (comment:9,[comment:10](#comment%3A10)).
