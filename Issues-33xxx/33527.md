sage: K = Qq(25, names='a')
sage: K0 = K.base_ring()
sage: K0(K(1))
Traceback (most recent call last):

```
I think at some point the element constructor for `K0` tries to convert into its base ring, which is `K0` itself.  Instead, we probably need to create an explicit section of the inclusion of `K0` into `K`.
