Re: https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/zhjl_j6j_Qc

These days, using a `SAGE_TMP` that by default lives under `$HOME` is overly complex and often inefficient. In this ticket we implement the first phase of its removal, to be replaced by python's `tempfile` module. Specifically,

1. We replace all direct uses of `SAGE_TMP` within the sage library and doctests.
2. We update `tmp_dir()` and `tmp_filename()` to use the `tempfile` defaults.
3. We remove `SAGE_TMP`.

Afterward, the custom functions `tmp_dir()` and `tmp_filename()` can be deprecated in favor of `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` and `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()`.

Moreover when #8784 is done, we'll be able to remove sage-cleaner entirely.

<a id='comment:1'></a>
I've posted a work-in-progress branch that raises a question. The python docs,

  https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html

state that, in regards to a named temporary file,

> Whether the name can be used to open the file a second time, while the named temporary
> file is still open, varies across platforms (it can be so used on Unix; it cannot on
> Windows NT or later)


So in many cases, where I would have liked to have done

```
sage: with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as f:
....:     q.save_image(f.name)
```

I have instead done something like

```
sage: f = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False); f.close()
sage: q.save_image(f.name)
sage: os.remove(f.name)
```

or

```
sage: with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as d:
....:     filename = os.path.join(d, "foo.png") 
....:     q.save_image(filename)
```

to avoid the `save_image` call reopening the same name. However, the docs are unclear about what "on Windows" means. So the two examples above can be simplified if this is not a problem on cygwin.

How did you solve the problems that sage-cleaner solves?  It's not like I wrote it for no reason.  There are many situations in practice that people hit where temp files and subprocess get left around.  Make sure that at least the following works:

1. Start sage.  Do something that creates a temp file and also something that spawns a subprocess.
2. Segfault the sage that you started, e.g., by doing something stupid with Cython.

What happens?  Are all temp files and spawned processes properly cleaned up?

It's an unfortunate reality that we make Cython relatively easy to use, hence it's easy from the command line or notebook to segfault a running Sage process.

Just curious.  I never liked or wanted to write sage-cleaner, but I couldn't think of any better approach to make end users happy.

1. Now that all temporary files are created in `/tmp` or equivalent, they'll be cleaned up by the system eventually. In the event of a crash, I would say that this is preferable, because those temporary files can contain important debugging information.

2. Sage doesn't segfault. More seriously, it depends on the process. In the simplest case, the subprocess will continue doing whatever it's doing until it completes, and will then terminate. Next would be subprocesses that communicate with the parent; eventually they'll be sent a SIGPIPE and commit suicide. If you go out of your way to launch something that is basically a daemon, though, it can indeed outlive the parent.

For (2) to be an issue, you have to launch a standalone process that never terminates, detach it from the parent, compile a C extension, load the extension into your current session, and then cause it to segfault. I don't think cleaning up after that situation should be the responsibility of *any* application; but especially not of a computer algebra system.

If you intend to do something like that frequently (or host a service for users who will...), there are better solutions these days -- cgroups on linux being the best example.

We just need to know if this works,

```
sage: import tempfile
sage: p = plot(sin(x), x, (-pi, pi))
sage: with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=".png") as f:
....:     p.save(filename=f.name)
....: 
```

or if the fact that `save()` reopens the (already open) file causes problem.

The changes to using `TemporaryDirectory` in doctests are easy to review and are definitely a great improvement that we should merge as soon as possible.

However, I would suggest to split this ticket, so that the wholesale removal of the cleaner is in its own ticket. In particular, user code may continue to use `SAGE_TMP`, as this was the advertised interface since the beginning of time. So we need a transition period here. Perhaps a deprecation warning that the cleaner issues when it actually finds something to clean.

To my surprise, `SAGE_TMP` was actually undocumented. It's not in the reference manual or the developer guide, and it had no docstring. But you're probably right that a few sage developers managed to use it in their own code.

If we want to raise a deprecation warning for it, I can do so in a way that doesn't affect the rest of this ticket by changing `SAGE_TMP` to return a `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` instead of the old `DOT_SAGE` value. Then its use won't create anything that would require sage-cleaner to remove.

It doesn't really delete anything except the files created specifically for the benefit of sage-cleaner, and some legacy paths whose locations were changed in the `fix_old_mistakes()` funtion.

I'm not strongly opposed to leaving sage-cleaner alone, but a deprecation warning on killed processes is going to produce false positives on every process that would have terminated nicely but was killed prematurely by sage-cleaner, i.e. most of them.

My attempts to build 9.5 beta and rc
releases fail on `sagemath_doc_html`.

My attempts to build the 9.6 beta releases
fail earlier, on `sagelib` I think.

Fortunately this is only a python question... if you don't mind, does this work?

```
>>> import tempfile
>>> with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=".txt") as f:
...     with open(f.name, "w") as g:
...         _ = g.write("Hello, world!")
...     with open(f.name) as h:
...         contents = h.read()
... 
>>> print(contents)
Hello, world!

Overall, I'm a bit unsure about changes like this one to the doctests. 
What is lost for the user is being able to copy-paste the code and then inspect the

In many cases, the point of the method is that it writes what would normally be shown to the user to a file instead. If you want to see this MILP, for example, then `p.show()` can be used instead. I'm dodging your point, but looking back, many of these tests are in the same spirit.

Current branch still removes `SAGE_TMP`. This needs to be backed out. Likewise the removal of `ECL_TMP`, `SPYX_TMP` - they are part of the public API.
