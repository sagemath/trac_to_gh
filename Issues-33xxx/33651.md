(from #33650#comment:7)

In https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/launching.html#setting-up-sagemath-as-a-jupyter-kernel-in-an-existing-jupyter-notebook-or-jupyterlab-installation we tell users to install the kernelspec of a Sage installation using `jupyter kernelspec install --user`.

But we forget to tell them that it will shadow the kernel invoked by `sage -n` globally (for every copy of Sage), unless `--name` is used to rename it from `sagemath` to something more specific.

In this ticket:
- We adjust the documentation 
- We have `sage -n` issue a warning if the user configuration shadows the kernels
