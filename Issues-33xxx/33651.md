(from [#33650 comment:7](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/33650#comment:7))

In https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/launching.html#setting-up-sagemath-as-a-jupyter-kernel-in-an-existing-jupyter-notebook-or-jupyterlab-installation we tell users to install the kernelspec of a Sage installation using `jupyter kernelspec install --user`.

But we forget to tell them that it will shadow the kernel invoked by `sage -n` globally (for every copy of Sage), unless `--name` is used to rename it from `sagemath` to something more specific.

In this ticket:
- We adjust the documentation 
- We have `sage -n` issue a warning if the user configuration shadows the kernels

This is how we can read out the `kernel_spec`.

```
sage: from jupyter_client.kernelspec import get_kernel_spec
sage: spec = get_kernel_spec('sagemath')
sage: spec.argv[0]
'/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-gcc11/local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.10/bin/sage'
