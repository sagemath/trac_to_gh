The command `sage --upgrade` used to provide a way of

It was removed in #30866 but the help still mentions it.

Here we remove the `--upgrade` option from the help.

Sage 9.5 has already been released (on 30 January), so it is too late for that. If someone fixes the issue, it will be effective in Sage 9.6.
