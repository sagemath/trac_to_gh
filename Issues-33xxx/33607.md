Versions of jupyterlab-server >= 2.11 require jinja2 >= 3, which is incompatible. https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md


This leads to errors when creating a new jupyter notebook:

```
      File "/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-gcc11/local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.10/lib/python3.10/site-packages/notebook/templates/notebook.html", line 115, in block 'header'

        from jinja2 import contextfilter
    ImportError: cannot import name 'contextfilter' from 'jinja2' (/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-gcc11/local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.10/lib/python3.10/site-packages/jinja2/__init__.py)
```


Our upgrade for `jinja2` is stuck in #31937, so we set a version bound here.
