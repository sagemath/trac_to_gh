This package not used at all, it was replaced by PARI by #24531 merged on february 2018. The commit added the following note in `SPKG.txt`:

```
NOTE: the ratpoints package has been assimilated by PARI/GP. Therefore,
this package (as Sage package) is deprecated. In the future, it will be
removed from Sage.
```
I think it's due time that this package is removed.

@mkoeppe: `src/doc/en/developer/portability_testing.rst` mentions `ratpoints` in an attempt of giving instructions to build only one small package. However, I wasn't able to reproduce this tutorial so I didn't change it.

This is https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/portability_testing.html#generating-dockerfiles

FWIW my issues with the tutorial:
a. the dockerfile tries to install libgap-dev which doesn't exist on ubuntu:latest
b. after removing libgap-dev from build/pkgs/gap/distros/debian.txt, docker refuses to acknowledge the build-arg `TARGETS`, it just ignores I only want to build ratpoints and builds everything.

In any case, you are probably better suited than me to rewrite or remove that section (I was thinking of changing `ratpoints` by a different small package, but since I can't properly reproduce anything I'd rather not touch it).
