One place for such tests might be `fricas.py`, line 1510.

I guess one could systematically compare some numerical values, to make sure that the definitions agree.  For example

```
sage: jacobi_cn(0.9,2.1) - fricas("jacobiCn")(0.9,2.1).sage()
-7.04818555476145e-20*I
```
but I have absolutely no idea which values would make sense.

<a id='comment:9'></a>I'm sorry to be pedantic, but I find doctests like

```
sage: fricas(gen_legendre_P(2,1/2,x))  # optional - fricas
            1
legendreP(2,-,x)
            2
```
not very informative.  All this tests is that there is a trivariate fricas function `legendreP`.  It does not test, for example, that the ordering of the variables is as suggested.

I admit that it is a bit of work to find out how much information fricas actually has about these functions.  I did some digging:

* for the univariate elliptic, fricas can evaluate numerically
* for the bivariate legendre, hermite fricas knows the polynomial, e.g.:

```
sage: fricas.legendreP(4,x)
35  4   15  2   3
-- x  - -- x  + -
 8       4      8

```
* for the bivariate jacobiCn, jacobiSn, jacobiDn, ellipticE, ellipticF fricas knows the taylor series:

```
sage: fricas.series(fricas.jacobiCn(x,4), x=0)
    1  2   17  4   433  6   2903  8   226327  10      11
1 - - x  + -- x  - --- x  + ---- x  - ------ x   + O(x  )
    2      24      720      5760      518400

sage: fricas.series(fricas.ellipticF(x,2), x=0)
    1  3   19  5    9  7   289  9   279  11      12
x + - x  + -- x  + -- x  + --- x  + --- x   + O(x  )
    2      40      16      384      256
