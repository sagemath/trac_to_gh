<a id='comment:12'></a>For multiline imports, how about

- parentheses instead of line continuation with backslash?
- sorting by alphabet or theme (unless the order reflects
  dependencies among imports)?

For instance:

```diff
-from .combinat import bell_number, catalan_number, euler_number, fibonacci, \
-    lucas_number1, lucas_number2, stirling_number1, stirling_number2, \
-    polygonal_number, CombinatorialObject, CombinatorialClass, \
-    MapCombinatorialClass, \
-    tuples, number_of_tuples, unordered_tuples, number_of_unordered_tuples, \
-    bell_polynomial, fibonacci_sequence, fibonacci_xrange, bernoulli_polynomial
+from .combinat import (
+    CombinatorialClass, CombinatorialObject, MapCombinatorialClass,
+    bell_number, bell_polynomial, bernoulli_polynomial,
+    catalan_number, euler_number,
+    fibonacci, fibonacci_sequence, fibonacci_xrange,
+    lucas_number1, lucas_number2, polygonal_number,
+    stirling_number1, stirling_number2,
+    tuples, number_of_tuples,
+    unordered_tuples, number_of_unordered_tuples
+)
```

Maybe reword "inheritate from when needed"
to "inherit from it when needed".

Maybe rephrase:

```diff
-As repetition can occur in the initial word, the subwords of a given word is
-not a set in general but an enumerated multiset!
+As repetition can occur in the initial word, in general subwords
+of a given word form an enumerated multiset rather than a set!
```
