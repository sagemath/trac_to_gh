Due to  #32475, merge in 9.5, method `perfect_mathings()` is no longer working for `BipartiteGraph` (see #comment:1). 

To fix this bug, we implement a specialized version of the perfect matchings iterator for `BipartiteGraph`. It takes into account the left and right subsets of vertices and ensures that in the list of reported edges, the first vertex of each edge is from the left set and the second from the right set. So we have:

```
sage: B = BipartiteGraph( [(0, 5), (0, 7), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (6, 9), (8, 9)] )
sage: B.left, B.right
({0, 1, 2, 3, 9}, {4, 5, 6, 7, 8})
sage: for m in B.perfect_matchings(labels=False):
....:     if any(u not in B.left or v not in B.right for u, v in m):
....:         raise ValueError("something goes wrong")
....:     print(sorted(m))
....: 
[(0, 7), (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6), (9, 8)]
[(0, 7), (1, 4), (2, 8), (3, 5), (9, 6)]
[(0, 5), (1, 7), (2, 4), (3, 6), (9, 8)]
[(0, 7), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 5), (9, 8)]
[(0, 5), (1, 7), (2, 8), (3, 4), (9, 6)]
[(0, 7), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (9, 8)]
```

A solution is to do a specific method for bipartite graphs. I'll give it a try.
