This no longer works properly:

```
sage: x = [0,1,2,3,4]   
sage: y = [8,5,2,-1,-4]
sage: var('a,b,t')
sage: model(t)=a*t+b
sage: data=zip(x,y)
sage: fit=find_fit(data,model,solution_dict=True) # Dictionary is optional but handy
sage: model.subs(fit) # Show the model
sage: plot(model.subs(fit),(t,0,5))+ points(list(data),pointsize=20,color='red') # Nice plot
TypeError: data has to be a list of lists, a matrix, or a numpy array
```
However, if one puts `list(data)` somewhere to account for this, it uses up the generator!  The workaround is to let `data=list(data)` but that is obviously hackish.  `find_fit` should accept zips of properly formatted lists of data points, at a minimum.
