When doctesting `src/sage_docbuild/__init__.py` on a read-only location we get a failure which ultimately boils down to:

This is due to a `save_cache()` method trying to save into that file; I believe it would be harmless to ignore this permission error (if the cache is not saved, it will have to be regenerated, so what).

Running tests on a read-write directory creates all of this:

```
$ find local/share/doc/sage
local/share/doc/sage
local/share/doc/sage/html
local/share/doc/sage/html/en
local/share/doc/sage/html/en/tutorial
local/share/doc/sage/html/en/docname
local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference
local/share/doc/sage/doctrees
local/share/doc/sage/doctrees/en
local/share/doc/sage/doctrees/en/tutorial
local/share/doc/sage/doctrees/en/docname
local/share/doc/sage/doctrees/en/docname/reference.pickle
```
Failure to write `reference.pickle` is no longer a failure after the patch in this ticket. If any of the directories doesn't exist and cannot be created, we get a failure.

Also created on a test run are: `local/lib/sage-current-location.txt` and `logs/pkgs/sqlite.log`.

Make sure the directory `local/share/doc/sage/doctrees/en/docname/` exists, otherwise there will be a failure when calling some `_output_dir()` method from `self.cache_filename()`.

This seems to be a cache of filenames or something... that is computed (or retrieved if cache file present) by `self.get_cache()` and then saved back to `local/share/doc/sage/doctrees/en/docname/reference.pickle` by the call to `pickle.dump()`.

For me I think what triggered this is: I build and doctest sagemath before packaging (in that check I have write permission). The package gets installed in a live system at `/usr/lib/sagemath...` where I don't have write permission. The `reference.pickle` file mentioned above was left over from the build doctest. Running the sequence in the description of the ticket (which reproduces part of a doctest) gives the failure, possibly given that the `reference.pickle` file exists.

Note that I'm building with `make build` so documentation is not built at this stage. I'm aiming for doctests to pass 100% at build time (rw tree) and also pass 100% when installed (ro tree).

Short answer: no

Long answer: a "doctrees" folder is passed to the sphinx app, but it is a temporary one. The relevant lines in `sphinxify.py` are

```
    srcdir = mkdtemp()
...
    doctreedir = os.path.join(srcdir, 'doctrees')
...
    sphinx_app = Sphinx(srcdir, confdir, outdir, doctreedir, format,
                        confoverrides, None, None, True)
```
So, a temporary "doctrees" folder is used by sphinxify and it has no relationship with what is normally in `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/sage/doctrees`.

Grepping sage's source for "doctrees" returned a false positive in that case.
