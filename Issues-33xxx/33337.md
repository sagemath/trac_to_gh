Currently, comparisons involving infinities can be slow:

```
sage: %timeit 2 > oo  # slow
4.96 µs ± 35.1 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
sage: %timeit oo > oo  # ok
321 ns ± 4.57 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)
sage: %timeit 1/2 > oo  # slow
5.95 µs ± 311 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
sage: o = RR(oo)
sage: %timeit o > oo  # slow
2.5 µs ± 26.8 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
```

It's probably a good idea to implement `__richcmp__` for the infinity elements to special case a few of these obvious things.

In fact, there is already a special method `_richcmp_` implemented for infinite elements.

I think that the slowness comes from the fact that `__richcmp__` first coerces the arguments to the same parent and so creates `InfinityRing(2)`, which is more or less slow:

```
sage: %timeit _ = InfinityRing(2)
2.9 µs ± 17.2 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
```

Exactly, that's why we should probably implement the double underscore method which does not do any coercion.

+1 on doing this. One hack around this that is fast is

```
sage: %timeit 2 < float("inf")
285 ns ± 2.88 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)
```

Ah OK.
I'm fine with doing this but I think that this solves only half of the problem because `2 > oo` calls `__richcmp__` on `2`.
