To replicate the issue:
* ./configure --enable-sagemath_doc_pdf=yes
* make
* ./sage -n jupyter
* select `New -> [SageMath](SageMath) xxxx`
* select `Help -> Sage Documentation`

`Clicking` on any of the PDF icons gives, for example, in the terminal:

```
[W 20:13:44.654 NotebookApp] Kernelspec name pdf cannot be found!
[W 20:13:44.655 NotebookApp] 404 GET /kernelspecs/pdf/en/tutorial/SageTutorial.pdf (::1): Kernel spec pdf not found
[W 20:13:44.656 NotebookApp] 404 GET /kernelspecs/pdf/en/tutorial/SageTutorial.pdf (::1) 2.920000ms referer=http://localhost:8888/kernelspecs/sagemath/doc/index.html
```
with a corresponding `404 : Not Found` browser page

Note:

if Sage is configured with `--enable-sagemath_doc_pdf=no` then PDF documentation icons/links will not appear in the Documentation.

Unless I'm mistaken, in addition to now creating the `pdf` symlink under the "website" folder the entire `pdf` tree under `local/share/doc/sage/pdf` had been copied to `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/pdf`. Is this intended?
