We delay importing `lazy_import_cache` until a lazy star import is done (which the Sage library never does).

We change two copies of essentially the same code that tries to use `SAGE_SRC` and `SAGE_LIB` to turn a source filename to a qualified package name so that 
- it does not fail when `sage.env.SAGE_SRC` cannot be imported or is empty
- it replaces the use of `SAGE_LIB` by using `sage.__path__` (to handle namespace packages correctly)

part of Meta-ticket #33037 (Remove use of `SAGE_LIB` and `SAGE_EXTCODE` variables)

If it ends up being useful in more than two files, should it be factored somewhere?
