`bootstrap` generates various files (in the above, `src/install-requires.txt`) from the source files `build/pkgs/*/install-requires.txt`).
To fix this, we should add these files as dependencies of the `configure` target in the top-level `Makefile`.

Likewise for the source files `build/pkgs/*/package-version.txt`, which influence other files such as `src/requirements.txt` that are generated by `bootstrap`.
