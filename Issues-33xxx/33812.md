```
Currently **sagemath-categories** distributes a superset of **sagemath-objects**, and both distributions include a copy of the doctester for their doctesting. We remove this duplication by declaring install-requires and extras-require.

The dependencies are illustrated in the updated developer's guide - https://e019add9a8540b8213dfc563e8e4bda04777282c--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/developer/packaging_sage_library.html#hierarchy-of-distribution-packages


As #33817 is a dependency, this ticket can be tested by running 

```
./bootstrap && make SAGE_CHECK=yes pypi-wheels
```
This test is also run as part of the "Build&Test" workflow.
