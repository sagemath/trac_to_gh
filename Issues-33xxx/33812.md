```
Currently **sagemath-categories** distributes a superset of **sagemath-objects**, and both distributions include a copy of the doctester for their doctesting. We remove this duplication by declaring install-requires and extras-require.

The dependencies are illustrated in the updated developer's guide - https://e019add9a8540b8213dfc563e8e4bda04777282c--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/developer/packaging_sage_library.html#hierarchy-of-distribution-packages


As #33817 is a dependency, this ticket can be tested by running 

```
./bootstrap && make SAGE_CHECK=yes pypi-wheels
```
This test is also run as part of the "Build&Test" workflow.

Sorry.. The hierarchy diagram is the hierarchy of the distribution pkgs. I now see the correct dependencies in `install_requires`.

It seems a provision to avoid `ImportError` in the situation when `sage.misc.lazy_import` is used when `sage.features` package is not present...

How about adding a comment to the code to explain the situation more concretely?

<a id='comment:71'></a>Thanks for the comment.

`9.7b6` below is `9.7` in other files, though I think it doesn't matter as explained in the comment.
