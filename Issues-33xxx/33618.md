With Sage 9.6.beta6:

```
$ ./sage --docbuild reference
Error building the documentation.
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: getattr(): attribute name must be string
```

The problem is of course the missing "output format" argument (i.e., `html`) for `--docbuild`. This should be recognized by the script, but the check in `src/sage_docbuild/__init__.py` contains a typo:

```
    name, typ = args.document, args.format
    if not name or not type:
```

Easy fix: `type` → `typ`.
