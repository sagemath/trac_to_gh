As reported in comment:8:ticket:32782, PARI's `qfbsolve()` does not work with quadratic forms whose discriminant is a square integer.

This currently triggers failures in random testing, but it is not a regression: `BinaryQF.solve_integer()` used to reject *all* positive discriminants prior to #32782.

Instead of

```
+                try:
+                    y = ZZ((n//x - Q._a*x) / Q._b)
+                except TypeError:
+                    continue
+                return tuple(row[0]*x + row[1]*y for row in M.rows())
```
you would better do

```
y_num = n // x - Q._a * x
if Q._b.divides(y_num):
    y = y_num // Q._b
    return tuple(row[0]*x + row[1]*y for row in M.rows())

It is better to avoid the use multiple statements on the same line as

```
U.rescale_row(0, choice((+1,-1))); assert U.det() in (+1,-1)
```
See [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). (I don't understand why this is not checked by the patchbot.)

Since you have a special treatment for `n=0`, it would be reasonable to have a dedicated doctest.
Maybe, you could change

```
sage: n = randrange(-10^3, 10^3)
sage: Q = BinaryQF([n, randrange(-10^3, 10^3), 0][::(-1)**randrange(2)])
sage: U = random_matrix(ZZ, 2, 2, 'unimodular')
sage: U.rescale_row(0, choice((+1,-1))); assert U.det() in (+1,-1)
sage: Q = Q.matrix_action_right(U)
sage: Q.discriminant().is_square()
True
sage: xy = Q.solve_integer(n)
sage: Q(*xy) == n
True
```
to

```
sage: Q = BinaryQF([n, randrange(-10^3, 10^3), 0][::(-1)**randrange(2)])
sage: U = random_matrix(ZZ, 2, 2, 'unimodular')
sage: U.rescale_row(0, choice((+1,-1))); assert U.det() in (+1,-1)
sage: Q = Q.matrix_action_right(U)
sage: Q.discriminant().is_square()
True
sage: xy = Q.solve_integer(0)
sage: Q(*xy) == 0
True
sage: n = randrange(-10^3, 10^3)
sage: xy = Q.solve_integer(n)
sage: Q(*xy) == n
True
```

And I think this will be all my comments for this ticket.
