#33073 removed a doctest that failed on 32-bit machines, see #33073#comment:22.

We fix it.

The purpose of the test is to illustrate that allocating too much memory for a `ListOfFaces` will give a correct error instead of segmentation fault or similar.

Instead of allocating `2^32-1` bits on 32-bit machines, we now allocate 10 times `2^32-1` bits, which should certainly fail.

I added a comment, that this tests that deallocation does works fine even if `__cinit__` fails.

The problem with the doctest was the following:

It certainly fails to allocate `2 ** sizeof(size_t)` bytes. However, `ListOfFaces` only allocates bit and `2 ** sizeof(size_t) / 8` bytes might very well be available (on 64-bit machines not really as all manufactures have limits below `2 ** 64` bytes of RAM).

Anyway, if we allocate `10` faces, each holding at least `2 ** sizeof(size_t)` bits, this must fail.
