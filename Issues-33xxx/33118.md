#33073 removed a doctest that failed on 32-bit machines, see #33073#comment:22.

We fix it.

The purpose of the test is to illustrate that allocating too much memory for a `ListOfFaces` will give a correct error instead of segmentation fault or similar.

<a id='comment:1'></a>Instead of allocating `2^32-1` bits on 32-bit machines, we now allocate 10 times `2^32-1` bits, which should certainly fail.

I added a comment, that this tests that deallocation does works fine even if `__cinit__` fails.
