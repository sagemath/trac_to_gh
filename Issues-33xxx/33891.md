In Sage 9.7.beta8, the docstring for the `parameter_set`
method of function derivative operators has an example
but no description.

To see this:

```
sage: y = function('y')(x)
sage: yd = diff(y, x)
sage: op = yd.operator()
sage: op.parameter_set?
Signature:      op.parameter_set()
Docstring:
   EXAMPLES:

      sage: from sage.symbolic.operators import FDerivativeOperator
      sage: f = function('foo')
      sage: op = FDerivativeOperator(f, [0,1])
      sage: op.parameter_set()
      [0, 1]
Init docstring: Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
File:           .../sage/symbolic/operators.py
Type:           method}}}
```
