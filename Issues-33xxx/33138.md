Seen in https://trac.sagemath.org/attachment/ticket/33070/numpy-1.21.4.log

The change made as part of #32046, using `pip wheel --build-option ...` (instead of `setup.py bdist_wheel...`) seems to have broken the use of said build options when the package is a PEP 517 package (i.e., has `pyproject.toml`)

Among the packages found by `git grep sdh_prefix`, only **numpy** is 
affected (the others, `python_igraph`, `jupyter_jsmol`, `pillow`, do not have `pyproject.toml`).

The build options for numpy are in particular needed for `SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes` builds. This would explain the segfaults (again!) in the multi-stage Cygwin build, triggered by plots in doctests - https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/4768915607?check_suite_focus=true

(Hence "blocker" for Sage 9.5.)

Also fixes a build problem on `alpine-standard` (#33083)
