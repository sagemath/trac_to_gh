## The symptom

On Ubuntu 18.04, with `SageMath version 9.6.beta6, Release Date: 2022-03-27`, with the GLPK available on the system `$ glpsol -v` returning `GLPSOL: GLPK LP/MIP Solver, v4.65`, we observe doctest failures of the following kind:

```
Failed example:
    lp.solve() # tol 1e-8   # optional - sage.rings.number_field
Expected:
    1.3090169943749475
Got:
    Long-step dual simplex will be used
    1.3090169943749472
```

Failures always consists of doctests tagged with some numerical tolerence `# tol`. It seems the fix proposed in #29317 to ignore sentence `Long-step dual simplex will be used` printed by GLPK does not work for doctests tagged with `# tol`.


The complete list of failures consist of the following 4 files:

```
sage -tp --long src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py src/sage/numerical/backends/glpk_backend.pyx src/sage/numerical/mip.pyx src/sage/tests/books/computational-mathematics-with-sagemath/lp_doctest.py
```
gives

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/numerical/backends/glpk_backend.pyx  # 4 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/numerical/mip.pyx  # 8 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/tests/books/computational-mathematics-with-sagemath/lp_doctest.py  # 2 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Isolation of the problem

The problem was understood in [comment:7](#comment:7). The warnings are not ignored by `check_output` method when tolerance tags are given. The following example illustrate the issue, the last line should be True:

```
sage: from sage.doctest.parsing import SageOutputChecker, SageDocTestParser
sage: import doctest
sage: optflag = doctest.NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE|doctest.ELLIPSIS
sage: DTP = SageDocTestParser(('sage','magma','guava'))
sage: OC = SageOutputChecker()
sage: example = "sage: 1.3090169943749475 # tol 1e-8\n1.3090169943749475"
sage: ex = DTP.parse(example)[1]
sage: ex.sage_source
'1.3090169943749475 # tol 1e-8\n'
sage: ex.want
'1.3090169943749475\n'
sage: OC.check_output(ex.want, '1.3090169943749475', optflag)
True
sage: OC.check_output(ex.want, 'ANYTHING1.3090169943749475', optflag)
False
sage: OC.check_output(ex.want, 'Long-step dual simplex will be used\n1.3090169943749475', optflag)
False
```

## The problem with the current code

It can be checked inside of the `check_output` method at [line 925 and below](https://gitlab.com/sagemath/sage/-/blob/develop/src/sage/doctest/parsing.py#L925) that when a tolerance is given a result True or False is returned before any fixup is performed to remove eventual `Long-step dual simplex will be used` to the output.

More precisely, at line 934, we return False because everything other than float numbers are not equal. This `return False` is done too early. Because we want to do eventual fix ups before returning False.

## The solution

The solution is not to return False at line 934 when the non-float part is not equal. In fact it is better to first check that all floats intervals intersect (currently done at line 942) and return False if not all intervals intersect.

Then, we can continue with checking the remaining non-floats parts as it is done by default when no tolerance is given instead of returning False.

## Further improvements

We create a independent method `do_fixup` which does the removal of eventual warnings as a last resort solution before returning False.

To ease the review, we keep the list `_repr_fixups` for now in the header of the module and leave its integration within `do_fixup` method for the follow-up ticket #33680.

Yes, it is the glpk from the system:

```
$ grep glpk config.log
## Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG glpk... ##
configure:12313: checking glpk.h usability
configure:12313: checking glpk.h presence

configure:12374: result: yes. Use system's glpk
configure:12395: will use system package and not install SPKG glpk
configure:12434: result: using glpk from the system
```

This one:

```
$ glpsol -v

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment:6):
> As I said, I wonder why the fix from #29317 is not catching this.

I got it. It is because the `# tol 1e-8` is dealt in the `check_output` method before the glpk regex get replaced.

The following behavior is fine:

```
sage: import doctest
sage: optflag = doctest.NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE|doctest.ELLIPSIS
sage: from sage.doctest.parsing import SageOutputChecker
sage: OC = SageOutputChecker()
sage: OC.check_output('1.3090169943749475','1.3090169943749475',optflag)
True
sage: OC.check_output('1.3090169943749475','ANYTHING1.3090169943749475',optflag)
False
sage: OC.check_output('1.3090169943749475','Long-step dual simplex will be used\n1.3090169943749475',optflag)
True
```

The following is ok as well:

```
sage: from sage.doctest.parsing import SageOutputChecker, SageDocTestParser
sage: import doctest
sage: optflag = doctest.NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE|doctest.ELLIPSIS
sage: DTP = SageDocTestParser(('sage','magma','guava'))
sage: OC = SageOutputChecker()
sage: example = "sage: 1.3090169943749475\n1.3090169943749475"
sage: ex = DTP.parse(example)[1]
sage: ex.want
'1.3090169943749475\n'
sage: OC.check_output(ex.want, '1.3090169943749475', optflag)
True
sage: OC.check_output(ex.want, 'ANYTHING1.3090169943749475', optflag)
False
sage: OC.check_output(ex.want, 'Long-step dual simplex will be used\n1.3090169943749475', optflag)
True
```

The following illustrates the bug (the last line should be True):

```
sage: example = "sage: 1.3090169943749475 # tol 1e-8\n1.3090169943749475"
sage: ex = DTP.parse(example)[1]
sage: ex.sage_source
'1.3090169943749475 # tol 1e-8\n'
sage: ex.want
'1.3090169943749475\n'
sage: OC.check_output(ex.want, '1.3090169943749475', optflag)
True
sage: OC.check_output(ex.want, 'ANYTHING1.3090169943749475', optflag)
False
sage: OC.check_output(ex.want, 'Long-step dual simplex will be used\n1.3090169943749475', optflag)
False
```

Observe that turning `ex.want` back to a string fixes it because I think the return is made in the `if isinstance(want, MarkedOutput):` block within the `check_output` method:

```
sage: type(ex.want)
<class 'sage.doctest.parsing.MarkedOutput'>
sage: sage: OC.check_output(str(ex.want), 'Long-step dual simplex will be used\n1.3090169943749475', optflag)
True
```

The code as it is now works and fixes the issue in the description of this ticket. Doing so, I added a new method `try_fixup` which helps understand what is happening. The way it is written follows how the code was written before. But here are few things that I dislike and that could be improved if reviewers agree:

- parameter `want` is not changed by `try_fixup`, only `got`, so why should `fixup` take `want` as input?
- the list `_repr_fixups` is defined in the header of the module but it is used only in the `try_fixup` method. I think it would make sense to remove it from the header and move it down inside the `try_fixup` method. It would make the `try_fixup` method more usable. More precisely, when somethings goes wrong for instance while debugging #33588, it is practical to add few `print` statements to see what is happening but it is quite painful to add a print statement inside of the lambda functions defined in the `_repr_fixups` at the top of the module.
- Since `_repr_fixups` is defined completely out of context in the top module it comes with 8 lines of documentation painfully explaining what it is. These lines would just disappear by defining them in context inside of the `try_fixup` method.

```python
# Collection of fixups applied in the SageOutputChecker.  Each element in this
# this list a pair of functions applied to the actual test output ('g' for
# "got") and the expected test output ('w' for "wanted").  The first function
# should be a simple fast test on the expected and/or actual output to                 
# determine if a fixup should be applied.  The second function is the actual
# fixup, which is applied if the test function passes.  In most fixups only one
# of the expected or received outputs are normalized, depending on the
# application.                            
_repr_fixups = [                                                          
    (lambda g, w: "Long-step" in g,         
     lambda g, w: (glpk_simplex_warning_regex.sub('', g), w)),
                                  
    (lambda g, w: "dylib" in g,                             
     lambda g, w: (ld_warning_regex.sub('', g), w)),             
                                                                    
    (lambda g, w: "pie being ignored" in g,                              
     lambda g, w: (ld_pie_warning_regex.sub('', g), w))                                          
]    
```

If reviewers agree with me, I will do one more commit improving that.

-The problem was understood in [comment:7](#comment:7): the warnings are not ignored by `check_output` method when tolerance tags are given.
+## The problem with the current code
+
+It can be checked inside of the `check_output` method at [line 925 and below](https://gitlab.com/sagemath/sage/-/blob/develop/src/sage/doctest/parsing.py#L925) that when a tolerance is given a result True or False is returned before any fixup is performed to remove eventual `Long-step dual simplex will be used` to the output.
+
+More precisely, at line 934, we return False because everything other than float numbers are not equal. This `return False` is done too early. Because we want to do eventual fix ups before returning False.
+
+## The solution
+
+The solution is not to return False at line 934. In fact it is better to first check that all intervals intersect (currently done at line 942) and return False if not all intervals intersect.
+
+Then, we can continue with checking the remaining non-floats parts as it is done by default when no tolerance is given.
+
+## Further improvements
+
+We create a independent method `do_fixup` which does the removal of eventual warnings as a last resort solution before returning False.
+
+To ease the review, we keep the list `_repr_fixups` for now in the header of the module and leave its integration within `do_fixup` method for a later ticket.

 ## The problem with the current code
 
+The fix proposed in #29317 to ignore sentence `Long-step dual simplex will be used` printed by GLPK does not work for doctests tagged with `# tol`.
+
 It can be checked inside of the `check_output` method at [line 925 and below](https://gitlab.com/sagemath/sage/-/blob/develop/src/sage/doctest/parsing.py#L925) that when a tolerance is given a result True or False is returned before any fixup is performed to remove eventual `Long-step dual simplex will be used` to the output.
 
 More precisely, at line 934, we return False because everything other than float numbers are not equal. This `return False` is done too early. Because we want to do eventual fix ups before returning False.
 
 ## The solution
 
-The solution is not to return False at line 934. In fact it is better to first check that all intervals intersect (currently done at line 942) and return False if not all intervals intersect.

The documentation failure was due to a docstring defined with `"""..."""` as opposed to `r"""..."""`. I added a commit to fix that.

Now rebased on 9.6.rc0.

Also squashed the commit changing name `try_fixup` to `do_fixup` to simplify the review.
