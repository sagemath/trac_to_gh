<a id='comment:1'></a>Technically speaking, it shouldn’t matter that they are stored as integers as coercion should allow that to work. That being said, we can be more careful about how we build these things without a loss of optimization during the construction.

Without testing the code, I am a bit skeptical that there is not also a bug in the input because it should be a partition. I don’t quite understand why this is even constructing an element of the Schur functions, but I don’t have the code in front of me right now.

I will take a more detailed look tomorrow.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Here is a fix, where this is exposing a deeper issue with not converting the coefficients correctly. So working over, say, `GF(2)` leads to coefficients with 2 appearing because they were integers. Now everything is coerced into the base ring and computations are done there.

I also did some optimizations for `skew_by()` and `_apply_multi_module_morphism()`, which came up when I was looking into this ticket.

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: %timeit s[5,4,2,2,1].skew_by(s[3,2,2,1] + s[3,1])
366 µs ± 2.25 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
```
versus with #33267:

```
sage: %timeit s[5,4,2,2,1].skew_by(s[3,2,2,1] + s[3,1])
391 µs ± 3.62 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
```
versus 9.5:

```
sage: %timeit s[5,4,2,2,1].skew_by(s[3,2,2,1] + s[3,1])
404 µs ± 2.91 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
```

#33267 dependency is for a trivial conflict.
