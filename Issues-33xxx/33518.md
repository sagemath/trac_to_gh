Compare:

```
sage: L = crystals.Letters(['A',[1,2]])

sage: T1 = tensor([L,L])
sage: type(T1)
<class 'sage.combinat.crystals.tensor_product.FullTensorProductOfSuperCrystals_with_category'>

sage: T2 = crystals.TensorProduct(L,L)
sage: type(T2)
<class 'sage.combinat.crystals.tensor_product.FullTensorProductOfCrystals_with_category'>
```
This can lead to mathematically wrong results. We add a special case for super crystals.
