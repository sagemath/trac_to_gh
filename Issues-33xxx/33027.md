```
invoking `maxima` in a Sage script leads to a zombie process. E.g.
run the following in terminal

```
echo "t=maxima('2+2')" > /tmp/foo.sage && ./sage /tmp/foo.sage
```
and observe zombie `maxima` process after this terminates.
Don't forget to 

```
killall maxima
```
now and then.


A slightly shorter

```
echo "t=maxima('2+2')" | ./sage
```
does not lead to a zombie - in fact, it prints on exit:

```
sage: sage: Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m0.08s, Wall time 0m0.67s).
Exiting Maxima with PID 2318 running <SAGEROOT>/local/bin/maxima -p <SAGEROOT>/local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/interfaces/sage-maxima.lisp
```

This was observed while testing `sagetex` spkg with `SAGE_CHECK=yes make sagetex` on #32887.

Using `maxima_calculus()` (the library interface) rather than `maxima()` (pexpect interface) does not lead to zombies.

Apparently, this only happens with ecl installed in Sage rather than with system-wide ecl.

Ah yes, this might be the reason. I can also observe this on ubuntu focal with ecl installed as SPKG.

Yes, I can reproduce this - on a Gentoo machine with systemwide ecl there is no zombie, but installing ecl+maxima in Sage leads to zombies.

This was the correct guess.
If I remove `--disable-threads` then no zombies pop up.

Can this also be done on macOS?

macOS is sufficiently different from Linux, I'm not surprised. I noticed that Homebrew builds ecl with threads enabled, so the change proposed here should be fine on macOS too.

Not sure about cygwin though.

I am fairly certain that this is a race condition and enabling threads will not help in general.

Attaching a debugger to the maxima zombie process shows that the process hangs in a loop where it tries to flush the standard output, gets an error, tries to report that error to the standard error stream, then gets an error for that and so on. The following script

```
import atexit
atexit.register(lambda : maxima.quit())
t=maxima('2+2')
```

works fine and leaves no maxima zombies.

I don't have time to dig into the maxima interface code, but I am pretty sure that sage just doesn't shut down maxima properly.

Sounds related to https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/-/issues/634?

The fact that it works with threads enabled could be due to https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/-/issues/129. If that's the case then indeed we shouldn't rely on it.

The following script

The pexpect interface has been deprecated forever, so it's not unlikely. And I don't think adding a `quit()` hook could hurt in any case.

No, it's not. We have 2 maxima interfaces. `maxima_calculus` is the unique instance of the library-based interface and is for internal use by symbolics. `maxima` is the user-facing interface and is pexpect-based.

But when is that string sent to the running maxima process? I meant something like [comment:31](#comment%3A31).

I see now that there's a function called `quit_sage()` in `src/sage/all.py`,

```python
def quit_sage(verbose=True):
    """                                                                                                                                                                      
    If you use Sage in library mode, you should call this function                                                                                                           
    when your application quits.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                             
    It makes sure any child processes are also killed, etc.                                                                                                                  
    """
    ...
    from sage.interfaces.quit import expect_quitall
    expect_quitall(verbose=verbose)
    ...
```

which kills all running pexpect processes. And apparently you are supposed to call this function yourself. So, I guess we can blame sagetex for not calling `quit_sage()` at the end of the scripts it generates? =)

I'm going to experiment with a cleanup hook for symmetrica on another ticket. Our interface to that library has `start()` and `end()` functions that are supposed to be called manually. The `start()` function gets called when you import `sage.libs.symmetrica.all`, but `end()` never does unless you call `quit_sage()`. So I'm going to have `start()` register a hook that calls `end()`, and remove the corresponding bits from `quit_sage()`. The body of `quit_sage()` isn't very long so we may be able to obsolete it rather quickly.

I posted a branch on #8784 that eliminates `quit_sage()` and puts all of the cleanup chores (including the termination of pexpect processes) into atexit hooks.

It's a more-invasive change, but the right thing to do if it doesn't cause any subtle new bugs.
