Maybe I don't understand your idea exactly. I've tried to use a quotient ring over a three variate polynomial ring the third variable of which corresponding to the term abbreviated `Y` in Ivan Marin's paper. At the moment I don't have access to my notes about that, since I'm on vacation. But this was even slower than using the symbolic ring.

I am not suggesting that. In the description, you say you use `SR` since for the Laurent polynomial ring variables "x,y", you use x<sup>1/2</sup> and y<sup>1/2</sup> in the computations. I am just saying use the variables t<sub>0</sub> = x<sup>1/2</sup> and t<sub>1</sub> = y<sup>1/2</sup> for the computations to avoid `SR`. Then in the final computation, you just rescale all of the exponents by 1/2 since the result is a polynomial. Although we could just output with the squared variables with a `..

No problem. Enjoy your vacation.

I would have the internal cached method use fixed variable names and then do a substitution for different user input to not redo the computation just because the variable names change.

Also, typo: `beeing`.

It's not just squares of the variables, there are also squares of non monomial Laurent polynomials (see the `Y`). Apparently it's a non-trivial fact that the result always simplifies to Laurent polynomials.

Anyway, I will think about this once again, when I'm back home. Thanks for looking at the ticket!

<a id='comment:11'></a>Sorry for taking so long to get to this.

I am glad you were able to speed it up. How does it compare to doing computations in

```python
            LC = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ, 's0r, s1r')
            s0r, s1r = LC.gens()
            LR = PolynomialRing(LC 'Yr')
            Yr = LR.gen()
            pqr = Yr**2 + (s0r**2-1)*(s1r**2 -1)
```
This way it is the quotient ring of a *univariate* polynomial ring. I would think working with quotients there would be faster since the data type is more simple.

Also, I would have

```python
def links_gould_polynomial(self, varnames=None, use_symbolics=False):
    if varnames is not None:
         poly = links_gould_polynomial(use_symbolics=use_symbolics)
         R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, varnames)
         t0, t1 = R.gens()
         return poly(t0=t0, t1=t1)
    varnames = 't0, t1'
```
to not do the full computation again when only the variable names have changed.

Many thanks for this useful suggestion. Once again, I could achieve a remarkable improvement of performance with it. The calculation for knot K10_1 which didn't terminate using symbolics within a day, now needs 22 minutes. With the former quotient ring version it has been 4 hours.

Furthermore, I now could successfully run a crosscheck over all links listed in the KnotInfo and LinkInfo databases having less than 5 strands (3342 in sum) against the according specialization of the formal Markov trace on the cubic Hecke algebra (see method `formal_markov_trace` of class `CubicHeckeElement` in ticket #29717) in less than 5.5 hours.

This is done now, as well!

BTW: You may have asked why I wrote `(R1*R2*R1 - R2*R1*R2).is_zero())` before. The reason was that comparison in quotient rings over multivariate Laurent polynomial rings doesn't work. I will open a corresponding ticket about that, soon.
