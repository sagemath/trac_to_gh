Currently, `EllipticCurveIsogeny.dual()` contains a few calls of the form `phi.formal()[1]` where `phi` is an isogeny. Since we only need the leading coefficient, using the default precision `20` is wasteful: we can pass `prec=2` instead.

Moreover, `self.formal()[1]` is computed twice in the code; we should reuse it.

Example:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(j=GF(431^2)(4))
sage: phi = E.isogeny(2^99*E.gens()[0])
sage: phi
Isogeny of degree 27 from Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x over Finite Field in z2 of size 431^2 to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (237*z2+278)*x + (412*z2+74) over Finite Field in z2 of size 431^2
sage: %timeit phi.dual(); phi._EllipticCurveIsogeny__dual = None
```

9.5.rc3:

```
1.37 s ± 4.16 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```

This branch:

```
896 ms ± 1.91 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```
