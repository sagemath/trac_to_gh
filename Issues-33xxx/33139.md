On sage-release, report on a failure in Cygwin
(from a fresh git clone):

- https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/gTNMEVbzb6M/m/oLwrXx6yAQAJ

Also observed on Linux, where `make distclean` fixed it:

- https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/gTNMEVbzb6M/m/4iALmgfJAQAJ
- https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/gTNMEVbzb6M/m/k152YqXPAQAJ

Let us deal with the Cygwin failure here,
and with the Linux failure at #33488.

Also observed on Linux, where `make distclean` fixed it.

- https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/gTNMEVbzb6M/m/4iALmgfJAQAJ
- https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/gTNMEVbzb6M/m/k152YqXPAQAJ

So this ticket's component is not "porting: Cygwin".

Maybe "build" or "documentation" or "packages: standard"?

What are the `environment.pickle` files

Why are some of them missing?

This breaks my development versions of Sage
on Cygwin, Debian, macOS, Ubuntu.

I agree Sage 9.5 needs to get out though,
and I have no clue on solving this failure.

I hit the same issue (on WSL2, tried to clean the doc build and error persisted). What helped for me was to demote the warning (which is then treated as an error) to a debug message.
The build seems to succeed without any issues without the pickled env file.

A very similar issue occurs also on the github workflow added in #31415.
There, sphinx (not the sage code invoking sphinx) reports the following messages:

```
[sagemath_doc_html-none] [spkg     ] loading pickled environment... failed
[sagemath_doc_html-none] [spkg     ] failed: source directory has changed
[sagemath_doc_html-none] [spkg     ] building [inventory]: targets for 355 source files that are out of date
[sagemath_doc_html-none] [spkg     ] updating environment: [new config] 355 added, 0 changed, 0 removed
```
But since there is no "Warning" prefix, these are then not upgraded to errors.

See for example, https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/runs/5112648667?check_suite_focus=true
