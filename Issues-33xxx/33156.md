On 9.5.rc0:

```
 sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(65537), [5,5])
 sage: %prun _ = E.multiplication_by_m(127)
         5078 function calls (4879 primitive calls) in 0.406 seconds
         [...]
 sage: %prun _ = E.multiplication_by_m(127, x_only=True)
         327932 function calls (327450 primitive calls) in 21.238 seconds

   Ordered by: internal time

   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
    32263   19.549    0.001   19.584    0.001 polynomial_ring.py:309(_element_constructor_)
         [...]
```

The main reason seems to be the same as that underlying #33164: The variables `x` of `PolynomialRing(R,'x')` and `PolynomialRing(R,'x,y')` compare equal, hence we obtain a multivariate polynomial when querying the cache with the univariate variable, and then we run into the multivariate incarnation of #33165.

This can also lead to incorrect results when using the `._multiple_x_{numerator,denominator}()` methods directly:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(65537), [5,5])
sage: R.<x> = E.base_field()[]
sage: E._multiple_x_numerator(5, x=R.quotient(x^2).gen())
10220*xbar + 42539
sage: E._multiple_x_numerator(5)
10220*xbar + 42539
```

No, the correctness issue unfortunately persists.

Here's an attempt: We replace `@cached_method` (which is wrong for things that compare equal but aren't) by ad-hoc caching code, and we only cache the results here in the generic case (when `x is None`) to prevent ever-growing memory consumption. (Within the Sage library, these methods are only ever called with `x=None` anyway.)

This patch is orthogonal to #33164, but it will be faster on top of #33164.

However, this means it will be slower on repeated calls for the non-generic case. Should we be worried about this?

Also, shouldn't we also take advantage of the cache when `x` is passed by `cache[n](x)` (provided `n in cache`)?

Just like for division polynomials, this is a tradeoff: Evaluating the generic formulas is exponentially slower in `n` than computing the result directly for a given `x`, hence that should only be done for tiny `n` (if at all). However, the bulk of these methods is calling `.division_polynomial_0()`, which post-#33164 already attempts to find the crossover point for evaluation vs. fresh computation, so I'd suggest simply letting the logic there deal with it — the remaining overhead is a fixed number of base-ring operations, which should amount to a relatively small amount of work.
