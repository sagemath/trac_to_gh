It seems a bug:

```
sage: bool(AA(sqrt(2))/pi == sqrt(2)/pi)
TypeError: ECL says: THROW: The catch MACSYMA-QUIT is undefined.
```
The following comparison is fine, though.

```
sage: bool(AA(sqrt(2)) == sqrt(2))
True
```

To fix this, we provide elements of `AA` and `QQbar` with a `_maxima_init_` method that 
- handles the case of elements for which Sage can find a radical expression and 
- raises an error in all other cases. 
This is better than sending the unusable print representation of algebraic numbers (including `?`) to Maxima.
