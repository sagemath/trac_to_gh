We

* switch the language level of cython from 3str to 3.

This should not change anything, as we are now using python3. We also

* change the language level from 2 to 3 in specific pyx files,

in a way not to break anything.

Indeed, (3) and (5) pass for me. Let us forget about them.

For (2) and (4), maybe we could just change the doctests.

For (1), I suspect that we are going to meet large-scale problem with the doc.

For (6), I have no clue.
