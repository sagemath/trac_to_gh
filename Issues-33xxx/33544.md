We

* switch the language level of cython from 3str to 3.

This should not change anything, as we are now using python3. We also

* change the language level from 2 to 3 in specific pyx files,

in a way not to break anything.

The first shift is by

```
sage: identity_matrix(2).rook_vector.__doc__[20:60]
"elf, algorithm=u'ButeraPernici', complem"
```
vs `"elf, algorithm='ButeraPernici', compleme"` (without ticket)

I suspect that this insertion of `u` is a bug of Cython since Cython does not need to add `u` for (unicode) strings of Python3...
