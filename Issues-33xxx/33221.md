Why not use `gens()`?

Also, this should be split over 2 lines*

```
Ci, Cj = P.atlas()[i], P.atlas()[j]

Spheres do appear to use `\mathbb` (see https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/examples/pdf/SM_sphere_S2.pdf) so I adjusted accordingly, reflected in most recent commit.

Indeed, at the moment, we have

```
sage: latex(EuclideanSpace(2))
\mathbb{E}^{2}
sage: latex(manifolds.Sphere(3))
\mathbb{S}^{3}
```
So please use `\mathbb{P}` for projective spaces as well.

PS: there is some inconsistency with the above in 

```
sage: latex(manifolds.RealLine())
\Bold{R}
```
This should probably be fixed/discussed in another ticket. I guess this was to be consistent with 

```
sage: latex(RR)
\Bold{R}
```
but this may not be necessary, because after all `RR` and `manifolds.RealLine()` are two different beasts and having a distinction in the LaTeX output might not be a bad thing. Also in the long term, IMHO we should get rid of this `\Bold` extra command, which unnecessarily pollutes the Jupyter notebooks.

Ah right, that was done as a workaround to get the `X.<a,b> = M.chart()` preparser syntax working. You should just use `X[:]` instead (which is what `_first_ngens()` does).

For the standard name, I meant pass a `name="RP{}".format(dim)`. However, as you said, it is already implicitly there with the unnamed `"P"` input. I had missed that, sorry. For consistency, I think it should follow the latex name.

You also need `{}` for the latex in case the dimension is at least 10, so `latex_name=r"\mathbb{{RP}}^``".format(dim)`.

I would use a nested `for` loop instead of `combinations`:

```python
A = P.atlas()
for i in range(dim+1):
    Ci = A[i]
    gi = Ci[:]
    for j in range(i,dim+1):
        Cj = A[j]
        gj = Cj[:]
```
and so on. Although being slightly clever, you can combine this with the previous `for` loop for creating the charts (this might not be the best option in terms of code presentation; only in terms of optimization). I also might not rely on `atlas` being in a particular order either and instead just store the charts you make in a list you make.

It will also be faster if you explicitly set the inverse rather than having Sage compute it (and you can skip the checks too in the final version).

It might be good to also give a latex name to the subsets of `U_{i}`.

Thanks for the catch. I am hoping that `d=` is in math mode and `dim` is in fixed-width font. Will adding a space between `=` and `dim` 

```
`d=` ``dim``

work for that?
