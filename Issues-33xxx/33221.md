Indeed, at the moment, we have

```
sage: latex(EuclideanSpace(2))
\mathbb{E}^{2}
sage: latex(manifolds.Sphere(3))
\mathbb{S}^{3}
```
So please use `\mathbb{P}` for projective spaces as well.

PS: there is some inconsistency with the above in 

```
sage: latex(manifolds.RealLine())
\Bold{R}
```
This should probably be fixed/discussed in another ticket. I guess this was to be consistent with 

```
sage: latex(RR)
\Bold{R}
```
but this may not be necessary, because after all `RR` and `manifolds.RealLine()` are two different beasts and having a distinction in the LaTeX output might not be a bad thing. Also in the long term, IMHO we should get rid of this `\Bold` extra command, which unnecessarily pollutes the Jupyter notebooks.

For the standard name, I meant pass a `name="RP{}".format(dim)`. However, as you said, it is already implicitly there with the unnamed `"P"` input. I had missed that, sorry. For consistency, I think it should follow the latex name.

You also need `{}` for the latex in case the dimension is at least 10, so `latex_name=r"\mathbb{{RP}}^``".format(dim)`.

I would use a nested `for` loop instead of `combinations`:

```python
A = P.atlas()
for i in range(dim+1):
    Ci = A[i]
    gi = Ci[:]
    for j in range(i,dim+1):
        Cj = A[j]
        gj = Cj[:]
```
and so on. Although being slightly clever, you can combine this with the previous `for` loop for creating the charts (this might not be the best option in terms of code presentation; only in terms of optimization). I also might not rely on `atlas` being in a particular order either and instead just store the charts you make in a list you make.

It might be good to also give a latex name to the subsets of `U_{i}`.

Thanks for the catch. I am hoping that `d=` is in math mode and `dim` is in fixed-width font. Will adding a space between `=` and `dim` 

```
`d=` ``dim``

```
