(split out from #30845)

`git grep SAGE_LOCAL src/sage` shows that there are still a few leftover places in the Sage library that hardcode `SAGE_LOCAL` as the directory where some executables etc. are found, notably `gap`.

In some settings, this forces us to set `SAGE_LOCAL` to a system location when ideally it should ideally be unset (as in distribution packaging). In particular, in the (experimental) set up of Conda for Sage developers described in https://wiki.sagemath.org/Conda, we would set `SAGE_LOCAL` to `CONDA_PREFIX`.

We adjust the configure script for this situation.

Replying to [@mkoeppe](#comment%3A9):

just tried in a Docker container, and ran into

```
config.status: /usr/lib64 is not a symlink, see Trac #19782
config.status: error: Cannot perform incremental update, run "make distclean && make"
```
not sure if this is a bug for this branch.
