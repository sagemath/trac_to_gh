Thank you for the doctest fixes. I have resolved the problem in `ideal.py` – the warning comes from Sage and was introduced by #32320, so can be ignored in this doctest.

Moreover, I have altered two tests in the interface to make them compatible with both 1.18 and 1.19. Then I can enable these tests on the patchbot again.

If you agree with these changes, we can set this ticket to positive.
