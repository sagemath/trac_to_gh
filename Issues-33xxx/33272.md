Much more work to do from the output I get. Constructs like

```
`some text <https://someadress>`_
```
work fine but

```
`this text <:trac:`12345`>`_
```
doesn't at all. It displays <code>thistext <:trac:>\`_</code> in italics. The lack of space between `this` and `text` is not a mistake, it is really not present in the output. The final underscore may not be in italics but that's hard to establish and it shouldn't be visible in the first place.

`:trac:` is just an example, `:wikipedia:` behaves the same way and I expect all handles will be the same. Whatever the correct thing to do is, we will have to comb the whole thing to update the syntax.

Done a build (html and pdf), but I won't be able to see the resulting documents before about 9am NZ time which is in a bit less than 13 hours.

Of particular interest are
* `src/sage/knots/knotinfo.py` where the original was missing an ending `"` and I am not sure if it will parse properly or need to be replaced by codes.
* `src/sage/sat/solvers/satsolver.pyx` where I changed slightly the caption.

Also I saw `:meth:` in `src/sage/knots/knotinfo.py` and several other files but I cannot find where it is defined. Can someone tell me more about it?
