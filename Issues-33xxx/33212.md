This is for [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) version 9.5.rc3 built on two M1 Macs, one with macOS 11.6.2 (Big Sur) and the other with macOS 12.1 (Monterey).

One test in

```
src/sage/matrix/matrix_gf2e_dense.pyx
```
seems to fail consistently, namely

```
sage: K.<a> = GF(2^n)
sage: A = random_matrix(K, 50, 50)
sage: B = random_matrix(K, 50, 50)
sage: A._multiply_karatsuba(B) == A._multiply_classical(B)
```
as soon as `n > 2`.
In fact, `A` and `B` appear to be completely different.

I do not know how to deal with this, but I am available to test.

Works on my x64 Linux. I assume the underlying reason is that M4RIE relies on some undefined behaviour that works "as expected" on x86-ish architectures? Can you compile M4RIE with all warnings on and then run the tests? Maybe it's already triggered there?

I have been able to compile M4RI and M4RIE (the former is needed for the latter).

However, all checks fail for M4RIE.
