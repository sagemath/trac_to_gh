Fetching trac doesn't work without ssh keys (at least for me).

It doesn't if the remote is ssh, which is why we have changed that.

<a id='comment:45'></a>I don't get what you want.

```
+        git remote set-url --push trac git@trac.sagemath.org:sage.git
```
is in conflict with

```
+        git remote set-url --push trac pushing-needs-ssh-key
```
Since the ssh setup is more involved for gitpod, its better in my opinion to explicitly tell the user that something is off so he might look this up in the docs.

Ps: can we please migrate to github/gitlab; their server are beefy enough to don't need a special mirror setup ;-)
