**The problem with wiki.sagemath.org:**

It excludes new and newish developers who do not have the required legacy Trac account but log in to Trac using their GitHub accounts.

Wikis work because of the principle of crowdsourcing. Without a crowd, the material will just become outdated. New material added is indistinguishable from old material.

There is also a conflict between viewing the Wiki (1) as an archive (as a record of past achievements, and perhaps for the benefit of future software archaeologists); (2) as something that is useful for current users and developers; and (3) a place for discussion and planning actions.

These uses are not compatible. We propose to separate these types of material clearly and move each to a more appropriate system. 

**Source material on wiki.sagemath.org:**
- https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageWikiMaintenance%20page
- https://wiki.sagemath.org/TitleIndex

---

Proposed targets:


**Migration to Trac tickets / GitHub issues**

Ticket/issue descriptions can be used for collecting/curating/staging material that eventually should be added to our documentation or to our code.

- #30500 Meta-ticket: document configuring IDEs and text editors
- #31164 Meta-ticket: Add user packages from https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageMathExternalPackages as optional/experimental packages

**Migration to our documentation**

(needs conversion to rst)

- #33649 Developer's Guide: Update reviewer's check list from wiki
- #33663 Developer guide: Check material in https://wiki.sagemath.org/TentativeConventions
- #34554 Merge https://wiki.sagemath.org/CodeSharingWorkflow into developer manual

Current drawback: The documentation is only updated one every stable release (to be fixed in #33862)

**Migration to www.sagemath.org**

(needs conversion to html; or website scripts need extension to handle markdown or moinmoin sources; https://python-markdown.github.io/reference/; https://github.com/github/markup)

- This would be suitable for example for archiving https://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops

- #31533 Migrate old Sage release tours from Sage wiki
- [Merge info from https://wiki.sagemath.org/CategoryHomepage into contributors.xml](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/Qe0WU0VpBjY)

---

Considered but won't be needed:


**Migration to GitHub wiki:** 

"Note: Search engines will not index the contents of wikis. To have your content indexed by search engines, you can use GitHub Pages in a public repository." https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis

**Migration to GitHub pages:**

https://pages.github.com/

(needs conversion to markdown)

Unclear why we should create a new website when we already have www.sagemath.org

**Migration to trac.sagemath.org/wiki:**

As proposed in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/ayOL8_bzOfk/m/wOuVdXwbAgAJ, https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/Acy5nNZWaUA/m/DuqGh3JkCwAJ and https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/4ysVRpYGU_E

The [Trac wiki](https://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/WikiFormatting) markup appears to understand most of the old Sage wiki's markup, except:

- In section headers, [CamelCase](CamelCase) words need to be escaped with "!"
- edit the markup for included images
  - `{{https://patchbot.sagemath.org/svg/Pending||width=48}}` changes to `<img src="https://patchbot.sagemath.org/svg/Pending" width=48>`
- Replace `<<TableOfContents>>` by `[This is the Trac macro *PageOutline* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#PageOutline-macro)`

Also we can simplify some markup by replacing links to Trac tickets by just `#...`.

- A command that helps with this:
  {{{
  sed 's/<<TableOfContents[()]*>>/[This is the Trac macro *PageOutline* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#PageOutline-macro)/;s,\[\ 
  [https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/\([0-9]*\)|#\1\]\],#\1,g;/^=/s/ \ 
  ([A-Z][a-z][a-z]*[A-Z]\)/ !\1/g;' INPUT > OUTPUT
  }}}
- https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/MoinToTracScript (untested)

See, however, #30363 (Proposed migration from Trac to GitHub).


---

**Format conversion tools, workflow:** 

- https://github.com/swenson/sagewiki

- Convert directly to Markdown using https://github.com/phlash/moin2markdown

- Conversion from Trac wiki to markdown: https://github.com/sagemath/trac-to-github/

- To do while migrating: We also audit/update our documentation regarding links to the wiki.
  {{{
  $ git grep 'wiki[.]sage'
  }}}

It's critical that we get rid of the old Sage wiki. As Dima says - it excludes new developers. 

Trac is maintained because it has to be (thanks to all who keep it running!) The wiki part of it places no additional burden on maintaining Trac.

Some pages, for example https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageMathExternalPackages, are written in RST.

The Trac wiki also supports RST - https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiRestructuredText - but it looks like it is not activated. 

`@`dimpase, could you install `docutils` (as per https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiRestructuredText#Requirements)?
