**The problem with wiki.sagemath.org:**

It excludes new and newish developers who do not have the required legacy Trac account but log in to Trac using their GitHub accounts.

Wikis work because of the principle of crowdsourcing. Without a crowd, the material will just become outdated. New material added is indistinguishable from old material.

There is also a conflict between viewing the Wiki (1) as an archive (as a record of past achievements, and perhaps for the benefit of future software archaeologists); (2) as something that is useful for current users and developers; and (3) a place for discussion and planning actions.

These uses are not compatible. We propose to separate these types of material clearly and move each to a more appropriate system. 

**Source material on wiki.sagemath.org:**
- https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageWikiMaintenance%20page
- https://wiki.sagemath.org/TitleIndex

---

Proposed targets:


**Migration to Trac tickets / GitHub issues**

Ticket/issue descriptions can be used for collecting/curating/staging material that eventually should be added to our documentation or to our code.

- #30500 Meta-ticket: document configuring IDEs and text editors
- #31164 Meta-ticket: Add user packages from https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageMathExternalPackages as optional/experimental packages

**Migration to our documentation**

(needs conversion to rst)

- #33649 Developer's Guide: Update reviewer's check list from wiki
- #33663 Developer guide: Check material in https://wiki.sagemath.org/TentativeConventions
- #34554 Merge https://wiki.sagemath.org/CodeSharingWorkflow into developer manual

Current drawback: The documentation is only updated one every stable release (to be fixed in #33862)

**Migration to www.sagemath.org**

(needs conversion to html; or website scripts need extension to handle markdown or moinmoin sources; https://python-markdown.github.io/reference/; https://github.com/github/markup)

- This would be suitable for example for archiving https://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops

- #31533 Migrate old Sage release tours from Sage wiki
- [Merge info from https://wiki.sagemath.org/CategoryHomepage into contributors.xml](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/Qe0WU0VpBjY)

---

Considered but won't be needed:


**Migration to GitHub wiki:** 

"Note: Search engines will not index the contents of wikis. To have your content indexed by search engines, you can use GitHub Pages in a public repository." https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis

**Migration to GitHub pages:**

https://pages.github.com/

(needs conversion to markdown)

Unclear why we should create a new website when we already have www.sagemath.org

**Migration to trac.sagemath.org/wiki:**

As proposed in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/ayOL8_bzOfk/m/wOuVdXwbAgAJ, https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/Acy5nNZWaUA/m/DuqGh3JkCwAJ and https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/4ysVRpYGU_E

The [Trac wiki](https://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/WikiFormatting) markup appears to understand most of the old Sage wiki's markup, except:

- In section headers, [CamelCase](../wiki/CamelCase) words need to be escaped with "!"
- edit the markup for included images
  - `{{https://patchbot.sagemath.org/svg/Pending||width=48}}` changes to `<img src="https://patchbot.sagemath.org/svg/Pending" width=48>`
- Replace `<<TableOfContents>>` by `[This is the Trac macro *PageOutline* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#PageOutline-macro)`

Also we can simplify some markup by replacing links to Trac tickets by just `#...`.

- A command that helps with this:

  ```
  sed 's/<<TableOfContents[()]*>>/[[PageOutline]]/;s,\[\ 
  [https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/\([0-9]*\)|#\1\]\],#\1,g;/^=/s/ \ 
  ([A-Z][a-z][a-z]*[A-Z]\)/ !\1/g;' INPUT > OUTPUT
  ```
- https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/MoinToTracScript (untested)

See, however, #30363 (Proposed migration from Trac to GitHub).


---

**Format conversion tools, workflow:** 

- https://github.com/swenson/sagewiki

- Convert directly to Markdown using https://github.com/phlash/moin2markdown

- Conversion from Trac wiki to markdown: https://github.com/sagemath/trac-to-github/

- To do while migrating: We also audit/update our documentation regarding links to the wiki.

  ```
  $ git grep 'wiki[.]sage'
  ```

What's the reason why a wiki is necessary in addition to the main website and the documentation in the main repo? I think this leads only to possible duplication and confusion on where to put what.

In the past the wiki was very useful for organizing Sage Days and generally doing things that required quick updates by many people.   I think there are much better tools for such activities these days.

That is an important point. Together with liberal write permission to developers, that will make a search-engine-indexed website close to a wiki site...

Yes, the source code of our website is maintained on github. https://github.com/sagemath/website

I agree, it would be good to add GH Actions that runs what Harald currently runs manually after merging PRs, with a preview of the generated HTML on PRs.

After trac-to-github migration, we will have a new wiki https://github.com/sagemath/sage/wiki. The new wiki will have good visibility for sage developers. Developers could collaboratively edit the wiki pages easily. 

Its weak point "search engines will not index the contents of github wikis" seems minor. The wiki is for developers, who know already where to search. For prospective new users, we can advertise the new wiki through the sage homepage.

We don't need to close wiki.sagemath.org. It is being used and loved by some developers. We can just have two wikis. Why not? They will compete for a while, but I guess the new wiki will eventually win the game (the old wiki will be deprived of contents and visitors in the long run).

I think I can agree with this viewpoint. 

If there is material that needs to be found by search engines, we can just migrate that material to either the documentation or the website.
