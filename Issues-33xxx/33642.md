(from ticket:33491#comment:6)

(from #33331): Failures with conda install:

- matplotlib distutils classes

```
/usr/share/miniconda/envs/sage-build/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/__init__.py:169: DeprecationWarning: distutils Version classes are deprecated. Use packaging.version instead.
      if LooseVersion(module.__version__) < minver:
    /usr/share/miniconda/envs/sage-build/lib/python3.8/site-packages/setuptools/_distutils/version.py:351: DeprecationWarning: distutils Version classes are deprecated. Use packaging.version instead.
      other = LooseVersion(other)
```
Should be fixed by https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/21073, which is in included in matplotlib 3.5.1 (but for some reason conda installs only 3.3.2, to be investigated)

- matplotlib colormaps

```
     sage.repl.rich_output.display_manager.RichReprWarning: Exception in _rich_repr_ while displaying object: cannot import name 'colormaps' from 'matplotlib' (/usr/share/miniconda/envs/sage-build/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/__init__.py)
```
Probably introduced by #33491.

This is not really fixing the version conda picks. Conda still uses v3.3.2 on linux, see https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/runs/5871183030?check_suite_focus=true

So there should at least be a proper version requirement for conda, so that the environment file correctly setups up the conda environment.

Thanks! Looks good to me and seems to work well: https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/runs/5876791740?check_suite_focus=true

By the way, there are more conda-installed packages that are later replaced by pip: ptyprocess, iniconfig, sphinx, pytest, rpy2. I'll add them to #33331.
