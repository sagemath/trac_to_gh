While working on using pytest for doctesting, I encountered the following error, which is triggered by the import of `interacts.all`:

grid = Grid(nrows, ncols, make_widget, **kwds)

return sage_eval(self.value, get_globals())
sage/repl/user_globals.py:99: in get_globals

raise RuntimeError(
E RuntimeError: the user-space globals dictionary has not been initialized. Use initialize_globals() or set_globals() or use a different function which doesn't need these globals
```
The reason for this error is that `interacts.all` imports `interacts/library`, which contains a few methods whose default arguments call methods that have sideeffects (or at least require a certain initialization to happen first). This is fixed by moving the default argument calculation to a lambda callable which is only invoked once the function is executed.

No, I couldn't come up with a way that would be backwards compatible. I think this shouldn't really be a problem since it's clearly a local helper method (and should probably not even be exposed).

True, that page has a section "User interfaces" with two headings:

- "Command Line Interface", which under "Miscellaneous" has links to
  "Interacts", "Widgets", and a few other Jupyter-related things
- "Jupyter Notebook Interface", which points straight to the official
  Jupyter Notebook documentation

That could probably be improved.
