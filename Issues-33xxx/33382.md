While working on using pytest for doctesting, I encountered the following error, which is triggered by the import of `interacts.all`:

```
sage/interacts/all.py:20: in <module>
from . import calculus
sage/interacts/calculus.py:19: in <module>
from .library import taylor_polynomial
sage/interacts/library.py:1030: in <module>
interval_g = input_grid(1,2,default=[[0,8]], label="keyboard: "),
sage/repl/ipython_kernel/widgets_sagenb.py:559: in input_grid
grid = Grid(nrows, ncols, make_widget, **kwds)
sage/repl/ipython_kernel/widgets.py:430: in init
self._update()
sage/repl/ipython_kernel/widgets.py:456: in _update
v[i].append(col.children[i].get_interact_value())
sage/repl/ipython_kernel/widgets.py:154: in get_interact_value
v = self.get_value()
sage/repl/ipython_kernel/widgets.py:196: in get_value
return sage_eval(self.value, get_globals())
sage/repl/user_globals.py:99: in get_globals
_check()
sage/repl/user_globals.py:82: in _check
raise RuntimeError(
E RuntimeError: the user-space globals dictionary has not been initialized. Use initialize_globals() or set_globals() or use a different function which doesn't need these globals
```
The reason for this error is that `interacts.all` imports `interacts/library`, which contains a few methods whose default arguments call methods that have sideeffects (or at least require a certain initialization to happen first). This is fixed by moving the default argument calculation to a lambda callable which is only invoked once the function is executed. As part of this, the `library_interact` decorator is converted to a decorator factory that accepts the interaction widget as parameter. This aligns it with the `interact` decorator of ipwidgets (see https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Using%20Interact.html#Basic-interact, example 6).  As a nice plus, the startup time of sage is minimally decreased as importing `interacts.all` is now less involved.

<a id='comment:21'></a>True, that page has a section "User interfaces" with two headings:

- "Command Line Interface", which under "Miscellaneous" has links to
  "Interacts", "Widgets", and a few other Jupyter-related things
- "Jupyter Notebook Interface", which points straight to the official
  Jupyter Notebook documentation

That could probably be improved.
