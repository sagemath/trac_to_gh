We explain the notation `\mathfrak{X}(U,\Phi)` for the space of vector fields along a map and, in particular, stretch that its only an abbreviation for `\Gamma<sup>\infty(\Phi</sup>* TM)`.

Also include a few other fairly trivial improvements to the documentation.

From what I've seen, this is the usual notation for arbitrary k-smooth maps from `U` to `E`; the set of global sections of `E` is usually denoted by `\Gamma(E)` or `\Gamma^k(E)`, and `\Gamma^k(U; E)` (or `\Gamma^k_U(E)`) for sections over a subset `U` of the base.

`\mathfrak{X}(M)` is a pretty common notation for the set of vector fields on `M`. I don't think there is a standard notation for vector fields along a map, but `\mathfrak{X}(U,\Phi)` seems like a good convention (which however needs explanation).

I agree: `\mathfrak{X}(M)` is a standard notation and we should keep it. It is then quite natural to use `\mathfrak{X}(U,\Phi)` for vector fields along a map.

May I ask about the purpose of these doctests:

```diff
+        TESTS:
+
+        Identity map of a differentiable manifold::
+
+            sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='differentiable')
+            sage: id = M.identity_map(); id
+            Identity map Id_M of the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
+            sage: isinstance(id, sage.manifolds.differentiable.diff_map.DiffMap)
+            True
+
+        Identity map of a topological manifold is not smooth::
+        
+            sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='topological')
+            sage: isinstance(M.identity_map(), sage.manifolds.differentiable.diff_map.DiffMap)
+            False
```
They are pretty trivial and I am not sure they are useful. Moreover, I don't see the connection with the topic of this ticket.

I don't like this notation. This looks like a statement. I'd prefer something like this:

```diff
-    the *vector field module* `\mathfrak{X}(U,\Phi)` is the set of
+    the *vector field module* `\mathfrak{X}(U,\Phi)` (sometimes also denoted as 
+    `\Gamma(\Phi^* TM)` or `C^k(U; \Phi^* TM) )` is the set of
```

Also, it could be a nice idea to add a reference to [the section modules of vector bundles](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/section_module.html).

It might be worth to check other files and make the changes accordingly.

It is also a statement. `\mathfrak{X}(M)` is an abbreviation for `\Gamma^\infty(TM)`, i.e. `\mathfrak{X}(M) \equiv \Gamma^\infty(TM)`. I've clarified this point now.
