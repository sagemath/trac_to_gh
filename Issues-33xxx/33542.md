We explain the notation `\mathfrak{X}(U,\Phi)` for the space of vector fields along a map and, in particular, stretch that its only an abbreviation for `\Gamma<sup>\infty(\Phi</sup>* TM)`.

Also include a few other fairly trivial improvements to the documentation.

From what I've seen, this is the usual notation for arbitrary k-smooth maps from `U` to `E`; the set of global sections of `E` is usually denoted by `\Gamma(E)` or `\Gamma^k(E)`, and `\Gamma^k(U; E)` (or `\Gamma^k_U(E)`) for sections over a subset `U` of the base.

<a id='comment:4'></a>> \mathfrak{X}(U,\Phi)


`\mathfrak{X}(M)` is a pretty common notation for the set of vector fields on `M`. I don't think there is a standard notation for vector fields along a map, but `\mathfrak{X}(U,\Phi)` seems like a good convention (which however needs explanation).

I agree: `\mathfrak{X}(M)` is a standard notation and we should keep it. It is then quite natural to use `\mathfrak{X}(U,\Phi)` for vector fields along a map.

They are pretty trivial and I am not sure they are useful. Moreover, I don't see the connection with the topic of this ticket.

Also, it could be a nice idea to add a reference to [the section modules of vector bundles](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/section_module.html).

It might be worth to check other files and make the changes accordingly.

It is also a statement. `\mathfrak{X}(M)` is an abbreviation for `\Gamma^\infty(TM)`, i.e. `\mathfrak{X}(M) \equiv \Gamma^\infty(TM)`. I've clarified this point now.
