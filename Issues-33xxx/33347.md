```
HTML pages of our documentation that contain maths only in TOC trees do not render maths by MathJax because Sphinx does not include MathJax javascript files as the Sphinx MathJax extension does not recognize maths in TOC trees and to save loading time. See for instance,

  https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/schemes/index.html

There could be several solutions:

1. Fix in the upstream Sphinx MathJax extension. A relevant discussion is

   https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/10192

2. Add dummy :math:... to every inflicted pages to enable MathJax.

3. Enable MathJax by brute force by adding line

  ```python
  html_js_files = ['MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full', 'mathjax_sage.js']
   ``` 
   for `conf` files. But this results in duplicate MathJax inclusion 
   in the generated html file.

4. Rewrite maths in titles using bold, italics, superscripts, and subscripts as allowed in rst format.

A good solution would be implemented in this ticket.

Doc files are in reStructuredText format. HTML tags do not work in rst files, as I understand.

If Sphinx people do not help, then we may go for the option (2) somehow.

No kidding.

rst can also do bold, italics, superscripts, and subscripts.

+1.

Good main title "p-adic analysis" there,
subsection title "P-adic quantum mechanics" needs work:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_analysis#P-adic_quantum_mechanics

though the main title "p-adic_quantum_mechanics"
at the dedicated page for it is good:
