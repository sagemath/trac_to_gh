`homebrew-maximal` is broken because there's no gcc@12 package yet.
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/5353146513?check_suite_focus=true

`opensuse-15.2.1` is broken badly because apparently the Docker image is not maintained (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/5353145981?check_suite_focus=true), so this test is useless for us

The workflows for testing optional packages should not test `sagemath_doc_pdf` because that is best tested on top of the regular Sage build.
