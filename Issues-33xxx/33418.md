As a follow-up to #33363, I've attached an example that gives `hermite_form()` some trouble.

On my machine,

```
$ time sage hermite.py 
OK

real	7m15.960s
user	7m10.606s
sys	0m2.824s
```

whereas a "typical" random matrix would take under 10s.

If this is something that can be fixed, the test from #33363 can be restored afterwards.
