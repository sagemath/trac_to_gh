This is on Apple Silicon M1.

After `brew install primecount` and merging this ticket #33805 on top of [SageMath](SageMath) 9.7.beta5:

* `./configure` detects system primecount (`primecount-7.4:  using system package; SPKG will not be installed`).

* `make && make pytest && make ptestlong` succeeds.

there is no harm in having it in homebrew-build-env. As I explained in the thread above, it's possible not to have it in the appropriate paths (or not in the right place in these paths).

Thanks for testing! This means that we only need the new file `build/pkgs/primecount/distros/homebrew.txt`, but not the change to `.homebrew-build-env`.

why not, it's about 20 libraries, I gather.
Besides, it can be linked today, and no longer linked after `brew update`...
