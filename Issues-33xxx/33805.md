This is on Apple Silicon M1.

After `brew install primecount` and merging this ticket #33805 on top of [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) 9.7.beta5:

* `./configure` detects system primecount (`primecount-7.4:  using system package; SPKG will not be installed`).

there is no harm in having it in homebrew-build-env. As I explained in the thread above, it's possible not to have it in the appropriate paths (or not in the right place in these paths).
