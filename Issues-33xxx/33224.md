On 9.5.rc3:

```
sage: R.<z> = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ, implementation='pari')
sage: z^-2
z^-2 + O(z^18)
```

This happens because `construct_from_pari` in `power_series_pari.pyx` expands all `t_RFRAC` elements to a power series using the parent ring's default precision (usually 20). However, this needlessly reduces the precision when the `t_RFRAC` has denominator one, i.e., is actually a polynomial and can therefore be represented exactly as a power series. The fix is very simple: Check if the denominator equals `1`.

(This behaviour was identified as the root cause for the following loss of precision:)

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(257^2), [5,5])
sage: E.weierstrass_p(prec=50, algorithm='fast')
z^-2 + 256*z^2 + 36*z^4 + 86*z^6 + 107*z^8 + 126*z^10 + 119*z^12 + 4*z^14 + 54*z^16 + 216*z^18 + 212*z^20 + 185*z^22 + 100*z^24 + 85*z^26 + 3*z^28 + 10*z^30 + 53*z^32 + 26*z^34 + 163*z^36 + 144*z^38 + 176*z^40 + 121*z^42 + 163*z^44 + 241*z^46 + 82*z^48 + O(z^50)
sage: E.weierstrass_p(prec=50, algorithm='pari')
z^-2 + 256*z^2 + 36*z^4 + 86*z^6 + 107*z^8 + 126*z^10 + 119*z^12 + 4*z^14 + 54*z^16 + O(z^18)
sage: E.weierstrass_p(prec=50, algorithm='quadratic')
z^-2 + 256*z^2 + 36*z^4 + 86*z^6 + 107*z^8 + 126*z^10 + 119*z^12 + 4*z^14 + 54*z^16 + O(z^18)
