For the record, Ctrl-C is broken starting with version 3.0.25 of prompt_toolkit (current version 3.0.28 still broken, sage-the-distribution bundles 3.0.22 so it's ok).

If one waits the half hour or so that it takes to factor the number above, then the `^C` gets through, but waiting kind of defeats the purpose of hitting `^C`. This is not specific to factoring -- anything that depends on cysignals for Ctrl-C working is broken.

Upstream issue: https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/issues/1576

In the GH issue there are two different fixes suggested (with patches), IMHO the second one is better for sage (the downside is that introduces a dependency on cysignals, but sage already depends on cysignals).

No action is needed now, but one of the patches will be necessary if/when prompt_toolkit is updated, or for distro packages on systems with a recent version of prompt_toolkit (void linux issue and discussion in https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/35730)
