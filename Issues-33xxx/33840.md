`Matrix0.get_is_zero_unsafe()`, and hence some other functions including `Matrix.__bool__()` do not propagate exceptions:

While I cannot think of any example in the Sage library, I don't see why `__bool__` shouldn't raise exceptions.
[This question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52862526/can-the-python-bool-function-raise-an-exception-for-an-invalid-argument) on stackoverflows gives a few examples where it does, including

```
sage: import numpy
sage: bool(numpy.array([[1],[2]]))
...
ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
```
and we discussed on several occasions doing something similar in Sage. My own use case was a bit similar too—a custom number class that worked with numerical approximations and could raise an exception to ask the caller to redo the whole computation with a higher working precision.

> We do not propagate such errors for other `*_unsafe` matrix methods either.

If I remember correctly, other `_unsafe` methods (or the ones I know about) are internal to the matrix implementation; they do not call methods from the base ring or its elements.

They can build elements from or convert data to internal data structures. For example, see `matrix_gf2e_dense.pyx`.",

Numpy arrays are very different than a matrix, which has a (very different) mathematical meaning.

I think `__bool__` should be treated like `__eq__`, which should generally never raise an error. (I would like to see an `Unknown` type being able to return however.) My justification is `bool(x)` should be equivalent to `x == 0` for any object where `0` makes sense.

> My own use case was a bit similar too—a custom number class that worked with numerical approximations and could raise an exception to ask the caller to redo the whole computation with a higher working precision.

IMO, the correct thing do for this is to implement a subclass that handles such things as necessary. I don't think raising an exception is the correct way to deal with working around the lack of an `Unknown` return type. IMO, you should check something like `if not (x == 0) and not (x != 0):`.

Note also that `-1` is not (strictly speaking) a `bint`. So the error code is returning something of a different type or indistinguishable from `1`. Although IIRC, Cython treats `bint` as an `int` when building the C code, but I wouldn't want to rely on that.

I would say this is internal as well, but I know you are using a different definition (see below).

That is not true. They can build elements from or convert data to internal data structures. For example, see `matrix_gf2e_dense.pyx`.

Of course. My point was just that, in general, Python objects do have `__bool__()` methods that raise exceptions.

`get_is_zero_unsafe()` is used by *generic* matrices, meaning it may call the `__bool__()` method of elements of arbitrary rings, including custom rings provided by the user. Why shouldn't it propagate the exceptions raised in these methods?

Actually I can (a very contrived one, but using only pure Sage objects):

```
sage: t = SR(matrix(2,2,range(4)))
sage: mat = matrix([[t]])
sage: bool(mat)
...
Exception ignored in: 'sage.matrix.matrix_symbolic_dense.Matrix_symbolic_dense.get_is_zero_unsafe'

I can also make a Python object that can delete your entire system upon calling `__bool__()`. Saying it could happen is different than saying it should be allowed to happen.

There is an implicit assumption that those rings are reasonable well-behaved. In particular, if you are wanting to see if something is zero, then it should be well-behaved in this regard and not raise an error on comparisons to `0`. So many things do not protect against this for good reason.

That is a fair point about the interruption. I also did a little bit more reading and the Cython docs do say `bint` is a C `int` (with a special mapping to `True/False` in Python). Thus I am now okay with this change. Although I still oppose code where `__bool__()` (and `__eq__()`) raise an error for any category where it makes sense to compare to `0`  as being anything other than a bug.For example, the [comment:8](#comment:8) example is a bug IMO.

Raising an error on equality can cause lots of subtle problems. For example, when working with dictionaries in which you get a hash collision:

```sage
sage: M = matrix(2,2,range(4))
sage: M.set_immutable()
sage: t = SR(M)
sage: mat = matrix([[t]])
sage: mat.set_immutable()
sage: mat == 0. # boom
sage: hash(mat)
1677951251422179082
sage: d = {mat: 0}
sage: d[mat]  # fine since no hash collision
0
sage: d[hash(mat)] = 2 # boom from a hash collision that invokes an equality check
```
