As reported on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/G7Jxm42sTIo/m/cS8jpJ19BgAJ), maxima (and therefore sage) calculates the following sum incorrectly (but gives the correct answer when the constant `1` is changed to the variable `y`:

```
sage: s, n, x, y, t = var('s, n, x, y, t')
sage: sum(binomial(n,s) * (x + 1)^s * x^(n-s), s, 0, n)  # should be (2*x + 1)^n
(2*x)^n
sage: sum(binomial(n,s) * (x + y)^s * x^(n-s), s, 0, n)  # correct
(2*x + y)^n
```
The problem is in maxima. More precisely, as will be explained in the maxima bug report, the Zeilberger method computes an incorrect recurrence relation.

Related ticket: #31844. (In this related bug, Zeilberger computes the correct recurrence relation, but the wrong initial condition.)

Keywords: **maxima, sum, binomial, Zeilberger**

Fyi, `maple` and `giac` get the correct answer (but in more complicated forms):

```
sage: sum(binomial(n,s) * (x + 1)^s * x^(n-s), s, 0, n, algorithm="maple")
x^n*((2*x + 1)/x)^n
sage: sum(binomial(n,s) * (x + 1)^s * x^(n-s), s, 0, n, algorithm="giac")
x^n*e^(n*log(2*x + 1) - n*log(x))
```
Sage doesn't understand `sympy`'s answer, so I don't know whether it is correct:

```
sage: sum(binomial(n,s) * (x + 1)^s * x^(n-s), s, 0, n, algorithm="sympy")
     ...
NotImplementedError: conversion to SageMath is not implemented
```
