Does this test pass on Alpine?

```
sage -t /usr/lib/sage-9.5.beta9/src/sage/matrix/matrix_mod2_dense.pyx # 1 doctest failed
```

It's the last one failing on Void with musl 1.2.2,
where it gives 

```
cysignals.signals.SignalError: matrix allocation failed
```

instead of

```
RuntimeError: matrix allocation failed
```

so I wonder if the result is the same on Alpine,
and whether possibly the test result should be updated.

It looks to me like a bug in `posix_memalign()` in musl 1.2.2, see https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/34030#issuecomment-1002300676 and the comment before that one.

The cysignals code looks ok to me (specifically `sig_raise_exception` in `signals.pyx`) except that when raising `SignalError` with a custom message there is no way to distinguish `SIGILL`, `SIGSEGV` and `SIGBUS`. Maybe useful to append or prepend `"(SIGILL)"`, etc. to the message to aid debugging.

The intention of `fgamma()` seems to be to compute gamma (not log gamma). If I'm not mistaken the patch would be necessary for glibc as much as for musl, but I don't know if there's a way to trigger giac to call `fgamma()` at all.

From reading giac source, it's obvious that `tgammaf` was meant there. It's just some weirdness of musl or alpine which makes it not to use `tgammaf`, but `gammaf`, where e.g. on Apple it would have been `tgammaf`.

Building with `CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -DNO_BSD" make giac` succeeds. `NO_BSD` is some strange variable that does not seem to be used anywhere else in giac, so that's tentative.

Suitesparse found in the system library/header path but cvxopt tries to guess it anyway?

This has been reported a few times,
- https://github.com/cvxopt/cvxopt/issues/156
- https://github.com/cvxopt/cvxopt/issues/174

For now we'll probably be adding another special case to

running Apline in an lxc container.
Using their Python 3.10, their openblas - I guess that's the only pieces of the config puzzle that matter. 

That's the same error as I get while trying to build numpy wheel without Sage using pip,
just by running `pip wheel -e .` in the unzipped numpy distro. (same error on their master from the repo, too),
