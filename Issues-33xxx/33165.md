This seems to be part of what's going wrong in #33156:

```
sage: R.<x> = GF(31337)[]
sage: f = R.random_element(degree=999)
sage: g = R.random_element(degree=9999)
sage: S.<y> = R.quotient(f)
sage: %timeit g(y)
188 ms ± 1.74 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
sage: %timeit (g%f)(y)
16.4 ms ± 31 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
sage: %timeit S(g%f)
2.97 ms ± 185 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
```

This patch adds an optimized code path for evaluation at generators of (quotients of) polynomial rings isomorphic to the polynomial's parent. With the new code, `g(y)` is about as fast as `S(g)`.

The following cases are handled: {univariate polynomial rings, multivariate polynomial rings, quotients of univariate polynomial rings} over the same base.

We also speed up evaluation at monomials in another polynomial ring in a similar way.

This avoids slowing down the case of evaluations at elements of the base ring as much, and extends your speed-up to evaluations using keyword syntax.

A few comments since you want to optimize this:

- Instead of `is_MPolynomialRing(parent(a))` why not test `isinstance(a, MPolynomial)`. This should be faster.
- Use `(<Element> a)._parent` as it is faster. If you don't want to break encapsulation, use `parent(a)` since it is a Cython function instead of a Python method IIRC.
- It might be good to tweak `change_variable_name` to take advantage of this codepath.

Yes, thank you. I have also made some additional tweaks to try and get more speed out. Most notable:

- I made sure the handle the dense and sparse cases separately.
- `0` and constants are handled as further special cases.
- Not everything that is `x` is true as `is_gen()`:

  ```
  sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
  sage: R([0,1]).is_gen()
  False
  ```
  So I now cover this case.

With my changes, I get just a little tiny bit more (at least it is no worse):

```
sage: R.<x> = GF(31337)[]
sage: g = R(list(range(1,1001)))
sage: U.<t,u,v> = GF(31337)[]
sage: %timeit g(u)
1.86 ms ± 10.2 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)git
```
versus your branch

```
sage: %timeit g(u)
1.88 ms ± 35.7 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
```
I didn't run timing tests extensively, but where I did test, I saw at least a little speedup.

I am not sure about this change:

```
         R = parent(a)
 
-        if parent(cst) is not R:
-
+        if R is not self._parent._base:
```
Shouldn't it be `pol._parent._base` instead of `self._parent._base`?

Apart from that, lgtm! (But someone else should have a look since I contributed to the code.)

Since everything else in that code is working with `pol`, I think we should check that base ring. Although from what I understand of the code above, it should be the same base ring as `self`.

I have also checked your code, so if you are okay with mine, then we can set a positive review.
