<a id='comment:3'></a>What confused me already a few times is that parts of the installation guide is for both normal users and developers. I would propose to target the installation guide only to the average user, and move the more advanced installation/compilation from source to the developer guide.

So my proposal would be
- "installation guide" = entry point for average user
- "developer guide" = entry point for developers (or more generally people that want to contribute to sagemath)
- "readme.md" = entry point for people stumbling upon sage on github, should give a short explanation of what sage is and then redirect to either to the installation or developer guide.

I think we can replace the whole page by a redirect to https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md, which has a revised version of this text.

On macOS / No development / 3-manifolds:
The following was only true for [SageMath](SageMath) 9.4:
   You can choose between two options: A 800 MB disk image with the standard Sage distribution, and a 1 GB disk image that adds many optional packages.
Currently there are 2 versions:  Intel and ARM (Apple Silicon), less than 1 GB each.

In the cloud:

I was not proposing to duplicate the information, but to move it from the readme to the documentation. This would then look similar to scipy https://github.com/scipy/scipy which link to their installation guide and to ways to contribute.
