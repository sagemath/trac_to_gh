Method `distance_graph`, introduced in #7533, has been designed for undirected graphs (see #7533#comment:3) and moved to `generic_graph.py` in #7634 without care for directed graphs.

In this ticket, we move `distance_graph` to `graph.py` and improve it.

We let open the design of an adequate method for directed graphs and the extension to weighted (di)graphs.
