The `image` method of matrices mentions `row_space`.

It should also mention `column_space`.

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
I tried to take a look at this, but I couldn't find any mention of row_space in any of the matrix image functions, any of the documentation, or the wiki.

Can you clarify the specific method you're talking about?
