The `image` method of matrices mentions `row_module` (= `row_space`).

It should also mention `column_space`.

I tried to take a look at this, but I couldn't find any mention of row_space in any of the matrix image functions, any of the documentation, or the wiki.

Can you clarify the specific method you're talking about?

I have updated the ticket to reflect that `row_module` = `row_space`, and the former is the one used in the examples.
