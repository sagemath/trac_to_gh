pycryptosat is meant to be installed as a part of cryptominisat,
but it does not happen.

This is because it's installing the Python module in SAGE_ROOT/local/
From the log:

```
-- Found python interpreter, libs and header files
-- Building python interface
-- Python CFLAGS:  '-Wno-unused-result -Wsign-compare -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O2 -Wall -g -ffile-prefix-map=/build/python3.9-RNBry6/python3.9-3.9.2=.  -fstack-protector-strong -Wformat -Werror=format-security  -g -fwrapv -O2   '
-- Python LDFLAGS: '-lcrypt -lpthread -ldl  -lutil -lm'
-- Python LINKFORSHARED flags: '-Xlinker -export-dynamic -Wl,-O1 -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions'
-- Python module will be installed to : '/home/dimpase/work/sage/local'
-- Configuring done
```

See

```
./sage --pip install pycryptosat
```
can be used as a workaround

in cmake [config of cryptominisat](https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat/blob/master/python/CMakeLists.txt) on sees

```
if(DEFINED ENV{PYCRYPTOSAT_INSTALL_PATH})
    set(PY_INSTALL_PREFIX "--prefix=$ENV{PYCRYPTOSAT_INSTALL_PATH}")
elseif(DEFINED ENV{VIRTUAL_ENV})
    set(PY_INSTALL_PREFIX "")
else()
    set(PY_INSTALL_PREFIX "--prefix=${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}")
endif()
```

so one can explicitly set the path for the module. But to what value?

I don't see why it's not OK. Passing `PYCRYPTOSAT_INSTALL_PATH=$SAGE_VENV`
would make sure the python package installs in the correct venv, while the rest goes where it should.

When a system python is in use, `$(PYTHON)` is the path to `$(SAGE_VENV)/pyvenv.cfg`. This file is created on creation of the venv for the configured python and is never updated.

Switching between pythons = Re-running `configure`, with or without `--with-python=....`, which selects different system python versions.

how does using another Python in a configure run sets up rebuilt of python packages? Suppose you have 

```
