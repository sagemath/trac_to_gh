With this ticket the doctest framework takes into account the time it takes to check the output of doctests when issuing a `--warn-long` warning, as discussed in #33293.

This should make it easier to notice problems in which a test finishes quickly, but checking its output takes a long time.

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 30.0 --random-seed=167278271317752899549362543776637089081 src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/isogeny_small_degree.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/isogeny_small_degree.py", line 1553, in sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.isogeny_small_degree.Psi2
Warning, slow doctest:
    Psi2(71)  # long time (1 second)
Test ran for 0.50 s, check ran for 188.94 s
    [303 tests, 226.15 s]
```
To test this change locally and obtain the output above, one needs to revert the fixes from #33293 (e.g. `git revert 0047c4d d3a07b2 6c4a27e`).

The doctest timings make two other appearances that I've found. First, in the summary,

```
sage -t --random-seed=... src/sage/crypto/sbox.pyx
    [269 tests, 43.87 s]
```

and also in the `sage -t --verbose` output,

```
Trying (line 11):    units.length.meter
Expecting:
    meter
ok [0.11 s]
```

Should we include the check time in those?

Or more generally, do you think we should combine the example & check times for most purposes -- except when reporting a `--warn-long` violation? If we combined them, the "summary" time and verbose timings above would then include the check time, solving for us the problem of how to display the check times in those situations. Moreover we could do without this clause,

```python
if self.options.warn_long > 0 and example.walltime > self.options.warn_long:
    self.report_overtime(out, test, example, got)
```

since the subsequent one (including the check time) would suffice, being consistent with what the users sees in the summary/verbose timings.

To be clear, I think the variables should remain separate. I'm just wondering if we shouldn't use ` example.walltime + check_duration` in most places where we currently have `example.walltime`.

Yes, I think you are right about this. I have changed it in the last commit.

The summary time already included the check duration. Apparently, the variable `total_walltime` is only used when the time for running the tests is bounded by `--short=…`, but it makes sense to include the duration of the checking in that computation as well.


> Moreover we could do without this clause,

I have removed the clause, but this means that the long time warning almost always looks like

```
Test ran for 71.83 s, check ran for 0.00 s
```
where the second time is not of much use. Since these warnings should be rare anyway and since this simplifies the implementation (by getting rid of a branch that is practically never used unless there is a problem in the doctesting framework like #33293), this extra bit of verbosity seems acceptable to me.

It took me a while to understand this because I was convinced this was already possible with the old branch, but you are right – this works now, since previously the report for a test taking more than 0.1 seconds would not include the check time.

Thanks for the comments and the review.
