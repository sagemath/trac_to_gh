Should we rename the source file `plantri-5.2.tar.gz`? Note that it creates directory `plantri52/`. So either we let as is, or we have to fully repackage `plantri`.

Note that the package also contains `fullgen`, a generator of fullerenes. It was mentioned in #14618 but at the time buckygen was preferred due to licensing problems (I assume it's no longer an issue since we have plantri). So we could also use it...

As far as I can see on the website, "The programs are written in C and are free for all purposes other than sale for profit." - so this is still a non-free license.
