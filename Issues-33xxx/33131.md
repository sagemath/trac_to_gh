The binary distributions on the Sage mirrors are unmaintained (#31133) and have been broken for a long time.

We update the manual by including a decision tree. It never leads to the recommendation to use these binary distributions because better alternatives are available for every use case.

Hence, we replace all details regarding binaries by a short notice that they have been discontinued.

PR to also remove mention of the binaries from the website: 
- https://github.com/sagemath/website/pull/228 (merged)

Binary distributions are a "necessary evil" for platforms where *building* Sage can be considered as needing "system fu" out of proportion of "normal" *using* Sage fu.

Cases in point :

* Windows

Notwithstanding E. Madison Bray and others' gigantic efforts, building the Cygwin port of Sage is difficult ; probably too difficult for casual Windows users. The problem is that this puts Sage above the reach of at least 90% of undergraduate science/math students, i. e. our core target audience for future users.

The future of Sage on Windows may well reside in WSL2. However, this solution implies the care and feeding of a Linux virtual machine on Windows. Easier, but again out of the reach of at least 50% of our target audience (Unif fu isn'a as popular among science/engineering students ast it once was, don't get me started on biology/geology students, and don't even *think* of physicians-to-be...:-)).

* Mac

Not approaching a Mac at least than ten yards, I can't possibly knowledgeably comment on this platform ; I am still impressed by the sheer volume of Mac-specific or Mac-related problems that flourish on `sage-release` at each release...

Again, this platform represents a non-negligible part of our target audience.

These two platforms are a special case, requiring IMHO special consideration...

Which are nowadays a dwindling minority (if an elite one, of course ;-)). See below my remarks on Windows and Macs...

The ticket is to remove it from the *installation documentation*. I'm absolutely fine with that if it improves the situation for developers and users.

I would still like *access to easily download* binary distributions.

I recently on Linux (Debian) had problems building a newer version than apt but th ebinary distribution worked fine. I also do have problems with the numpy SIGILL on older CPUs (which the Debian versions don't have; don't know why).

I'd love to have Debian backports and sloppy-backports or third party (preferably sagemath not launchpad) repositories with latest sagemath packages for Debian releases and Ubuntu LTSes at least. Might be a tall order for volunteers to maintain.

That's not an option either way:

- https://www.sagemath.org/download-windows.html
- https://www.sagemath.org/download-linux.html
- https://www.sagemath.org/download-mac.html

There are many unfixed problems -- some fundamental -- and to put it bluntly, nobody cares. This ticket just changes the documentation to reflect reality, and perhaps in the future will allow us to not be held back by "what about the binaries?!" arguments.

    "body": "<a id='comment:16'></a>\nI think the question is not whether the binaries are maintained or not on our side but whether they are useful to users. I used to build up to 16 binaries at each release some years ago, then stopped since Jan Groenwald at AIMS dedicated some machines for that. Maybe he stopped after many years, but it is not an individual question. If those binaries are useful, then we should put some energy to dedicate some infrastructure for them, not the other way. I have the impression that the same happened with gitlab workers (they were usefull but since they were unmaintained, we stopped them).\n\nRegarding MacOS binaries, why not shipping the ones produced by 3-manifolds project on the Sage mirrors ?",

I think the question is not whether the binaries are maintained or not on our side but whether they are useful to users. I used to build up to 16 binaries at each release some years ago, then stopped since Jan Groenwald at AIMS dedicated some machines for that. Maybe he stopped after many years, but it is not an individual question. If those binaries are useful, then we should put some energy to dedicate some infrastructure for them, not the other way. I have the impression that the same happened with gitlab workers (they were usefull but since they were unmaintained, we stopped them).

Regarding MacOS binaries, why not shipping the ones produced by 3-manifolds project on the Sage mirrors ?

It would be useful to our users if they could hop on a zoom call and have a sage developer personally install sage for them. But is that a good use of our time? Is anyone actually going to volunteer to do it?

It would be nice to include all the known ways to run `SageMath` online as well, e.g., Sage cell server (https://sagecell.sagemath.org/), `CoCalc` (https://cocalc.com), etc.  Actually, I don't know of any others, but maybe somebody could make a mybinder (https://mybinder.org/) of Sage, if it doesn't exceed the size limits.

I once made a list but it was missing actual Binder links:

- answer to [Ask Sage question 42876](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/42876)

OpenDreamKit's "try" page

- https://opendreamkit.org/try/

and the "More SageMath tutorials" page

- https://more-sagemath-tutorials.readthedocs.io/

both use the same Binder link, which currently does not work.

Might not be that hard to fix...

That would be nice but the proposed patch mentions neither, nor an distro-specific installation. There are surely issues with the binary packages but they can work for some whereas the current patch isn't helpful at all.

At the very least we should have some eli5 instructions for how to get conda up and running and then install the conda sagemath package. Since conda is really the only way that works without root permissions I'd put that front and center.

+1 for removing binary distributions for linux, cannot say anything about mac.

The information for how to install sage is pretty scattered (wiki, website, docs, readme, ...). I think this should be combined in one place, listing the preferred installation method for each system and describe alternative installation methods as subpages.

If our binaries are broken and those are fine, why not just use their build scripts ? Otherwise, why not ship those working binaries on the Sage mirrors ?

I'm not aware of such a possibility. What one could do is to create a custom WSL image (with sage pre-installed), which people could then use. But in order to distribute this in the store, one would need to contact microsoft: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/build-custom-distro#for-linux-distro-maintainers

Another possibility is to install sage as a graphical app in WSLg (https://github.com/microsoft/wslg). For Win11, this then adds a launcher in the Windows start menu.

If you are a non-profit org, you don't have to pay for the developer account (which is needed for the codesigning): https://developer.apple.com/support/membership-fee-waiver/
Not sure if sage officially falls under this, but maybe worth a try?

Unless we have a volunteer who's willing to jump through all the hoops to set this all up (we don't have a proper non-profit set up, despite talking about it for years - that's why in particular our donations (GitHub and "direct") are received via OpenCollective, and not in a more direct and cost-efficient way), it's all idle chatter. 

Same for a volunteer to actually get on with the Apple developer cerificates, setting the necessary builds up, etc. (as this is all targeting developing via XCode, it's hit and miss with command line).

As per usual in these arguments, what this means is, "nobody with the expertise to maintain binary distributions cares enough to put in the nontrivial work it demands", which isn't quite the same thing.

Anyway, if someone with the expertise of pipedream aka Jan G. is asking about Linux binaries, then it should go without saying that we need some sustainable, reliable way to provide Mac and Windows binaries (unless we assume everyone is using CoCalc, which I do not think should be the assumption).  If Nathan and the Snappy folks are committed to this on Mac and that is easy to advertise everywhere it needs to be, great.

I spent a day with them once.  The first few hits for this search

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=william+stein+sagemathcloud+ucla

are to some short videos that came out of that.  

The answer is that they use CoCalc (previous called SageMathCloud) with Sage worksheets and Jupyter notebooks, and have done so since 2014. They do not install Sage locally.
