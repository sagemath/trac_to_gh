```
for k in range(N + 1):
    CoeffPolys = (CR.gen(k) ** D).lift(I)
    h = max([c.global_height(prec) for g in CoeffPolys for c in (g).coefficients()])
    maxh = max(maxh, h)

-        for k in range(N + 1):
-            CoeffPolys = (CR.gen(k) ** D).lift(I)
-            h = max([c.global_height(prec) for g in CoeffPolys for c in (g).coefficients()])
-            maxh = max(maxh, h)
-        L = R((N + 1) * binomial(N + D - d, D - d)).log() + maxh
+        L = R((N + 1) * binomial(N + D - d, D - d)).log() + f.global_height(prec)
```

The error of the existing code is the line

```
h = max([c.global_height(prec) for g in CoeffPolys for c in (g).coefficients()])
```
What is wrong is that it is taking the height of g to be the max of the height of its coefficients. You still need to take maxh to be the max of the heights of the CoeffPolys, but the correction is to use the new height code (#34060) to compute the heights of each g.

I'm also getting these errors on a clean branch. The first one is in the example

```
            sage: P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(ZZ, 2)
            sage: f = DynamicalSystem_projective([4*x^2 + 100*y^2, 210*x*y, 10000*z^2])

            sage: f.height_difference_bound()
            10.3089526606443
```
It doesn't make sense to keep .normalize in here anymore as the height of the polynomials is independent of the normalization. The 10.308... is the correct value. So condense this example down to a single (correct) value.

The second failure is just the wrong value.
