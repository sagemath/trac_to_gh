When the workflow is invoked on `GITHUB_REF` of the form `refs/tags/TAG_NAME`, set `NETLIFY_ALIAS=TAG_NAME`. The resulting URL can then be referred to in a redirect rule. https://github.com/sagemath/documentation/issues/24#issuecomment-1108225322

I don't think this works for the following reasons:
- you edited the step that is only run for branches != develop
- the workflow currently only runs on the sagetrac mirror but there tags no longer are created when one believes https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/tags
