When the workflow is invoked on `GITHUB_REF` of the form `refs/tags/TAG_NAME`, set `NETLIFY_ALIAS=TAG_NAME`. The resulting URL can then be referred to in a redirect rule. https://github.com/sagemath/documentation/issues/24#issuecomment-1108225322

I don't think this works for the following reasons:
