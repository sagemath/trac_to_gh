Hello!
I have encountered an error while building Sage. Here is  my OS info:

- Debian testing (bookworm)
- Sage-9.6.beta4
- package sagemath_doc_html-none

I ran make a few times and the package continually failed to build.
I expected this to build, but now I can not run the sage command.
Sage is broken. I'm not sure what happened here but please let me
know what I can do next. I have attached the log files for you
and a snippet of the last few lines of my terminal.

Errors building `sagemath_doc_html` have been frequent recently.

On Linux and macOS, it seems this usually solves it:

```
$ make -s V=0 doc-clean doc-uninstall && make -s V=0
```

Failing that, this has also worked for some:

```
$ make -s V=0 distclean && make -s V=0
```

On Cygwin, none of these helped for me.
