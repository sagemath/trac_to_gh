[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) allows one to setup a complete dev environment in the cloud. It is free to use for up to 50 hours per month. In this ticket the config necessary for making this work with sagemath is added. 

You can try this out by going to https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/tree/mkoeppe-9.5.beta9%2Bupdates. 

It works by building docker images on github, push them to GH packages (https://github.com/mkoeppe?tab=packages&q=gitpod) and then use these ones as the base for the gitpod workspace.

After this ticket is merged, we should activate the automatic prebuild by installing the github app (https://www.gitpod.io/docs/prebuilds#on-github). With this enabled, every push would trigger a prebuild of the complete environment (including the build of all dependencies and cythonizion) so that one has a up-to-date code env very quickly without the need to build anything.

Follow-up: #33113 gitpod usability improvements

Alternative: #32749, which only builds the docker image on gitpod (which is currently not really feasible as they have a time limit of 1h) 


Depends on #30933
Depends on #29285

Also the configuration of VS Code should be improved. It seems to start up using the wrong interpreter (not `venv/bin/python3`), and also one needs to manually select the right Jupyter kernel. 

The scipy folks have some good documentation and configuration (https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/contributor/quickstart_gitpod.html), perhaps we can lift something from there.

Is the prebuild working for this branch?

How can one work with branches that update sage packages? With #32749 one could trigger a rebuild of the docker image (and thus of the system packages) using the `#imagebuild` context. Can something like this also be implemented here? For example, take the github action build docker as base, and then re-install system or python packages on top of this if they have newer versions?

For the VS integration, #30677 is closed but not yet merged into develop.

I've just merged #33071 into the branch https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/tree/mkoeppe-9.5.beta9%2Bupdates to try this out.

Nothing special, `make` just rebuilds what needs rebuilding.

A few more points:
- please use the recent version of gitpod.yml from https://github.com/tobiasdiez/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/.gitpod.yml (the ssh stuff and num threads = 8)
- `--prefix=$HOME/sage-local` in gitpod.yml should probably be `/workspace/sage-local` or a few lines above `$HOME` should be used?
- probably 8 parallel tasks are fine. gitpod gives 6 (or 7?) vCPUs to users.

Did you added a `PRIVATE_SSH_KEY` env variable in gitpod with your trac ssh as described in the docs? It's working for me.

> OK, now it's in good shape.

For me it takes over 5min to start a workspace due to the large workspace image (it displays "fetching build image" or something like this in the loading screen). I think this should be optimized as part of this ticket since otherwise I fear people will not adopt gitpod for e.g. reviewing of tickets.

Also it still loads `pyenv`: `pyenv shell 3.8.12` so https://github.com/tobiasdiez/sagetrac-mirror/blob/20ca179bed4ff605de4111362b02c8e2acca617e/.gitpod.yml#L18-L19 should probably be readded.

That sadly doesn't solve the issue for me. Starting a workspace still takes 8+ mins, while #32749 takes about 2mins.

It also seems that the workspace image is quite large at around 16GB. In particular, the sage folder contains

``` 
4.9G    local
6.2G    src
```

I'm not sure if the following folders are really necessary or if they can be deleted (latest at the end of the prebuild):

```
1.8G    ./local/share/doc
4.3G    ./src/build
```

Moreover,

```
3.0G    /usr
3.3G    /home
```

is also bigger than the one from the other image of #32749

```
2.2G    /usr
2.3G    /home
```

So I suggest to use gitpod/workspace-base as a base.

I'll check if we can delete them without sacrificing fast rebuilds of documentation (`make doc-html`) and sagelib (`./sage -b`). 

For documentation, I see

```
[sagemath_doc_html-none] make doc-inventory--reference-references
[sagemath_doc_html-none] cd /workspace/sage && ./sage --docbuild --no-pdf-links reference/references inventory 
[sagemath_doc_html-none] [reference] loading pickled environment... failed

```
... so something is not ideal there anyway

Apparently, images are built in the US and then downloaded every time from there without caching. This explains why it takes so much longer for me. Gitpod is working on a solution https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/7002 and https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6145. But having a 15GB+ image is not ideal anyway.

A few packages that I think are not used by the built script or needed in general:

```
3722    python2.7-minimal
9370    libflint-dev
10026   pari-gp (and other pari-related stuff)
13215   ecl

19531   libgiac0 (and other giac-related stuff)
30765   vim-runtime
41291   emacs-nox
66816   emacs-common
330712  libgl1-mesa-dri (?)
```
I would suggest to exclude them from the installation / uninstall them, similar to what is done in #32749. 

Together that should give another 1GB.

Too bad, this no longer works with the smaller base image because it does not have docker. 

And `sudo apt-get install docker.io` is not sufficient to fix it:

```
$ docker run -it ubuntu:bionic bash
[...]
docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create shim: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:380: starting container process caused: error adding seccomp filter rule for syscall clone3: permission denied: unknown.
ERRO[0008] error waiting for container: context canceled 

$ sudo docker run -it ubuntu:bionic bash
docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create shim: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:380: starting container process caused: error adding seccomp filter rule for syscall clone3: permission denied: unknown.
ERRO[0001] error waiting for container: context canceled 
```

There's no web browser in the container, so you can't use `sage -n`.
To use Jupyter notebooks, use the Command Palette to run "Jupyter: Create New Jupyter Notebook", see

I've sent you an invite. I guess I installed their "app", but I don't see how to proceed.

Thanks! I've now created a "team" sagemath and added the `sage` and `sagetrac-mirror` as projects. If you have a gitpod account and want to be invited to this team (in order to access the config), just post your email address and I send an invite.

Currently, the creation of the image fails however due to a permission error:

That link is for a self-hosted gitpod and thus does not apply to our situation (we don't have a gitpod config other than what is committed in this branch).

I think the issue is that the image `sage-docker-gitpod-standard-with-targets` is not yet published under `sagemath/sage`. But how is this then working with your account Matthias?

Yes, on the next release that includes this branch, the Docker image will be pushed (by separate instances of the workflow) both to `gchr.io/sagemath/sage` and to `gchr.io/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror`.

We will then see whether the 403 Forbidden will go away. I think it will not, for workflows run on `github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror`, because it may not have the `read:packages` credential for `gchr.io/sagemath/sage`.
