Currently, the number of jobs used for parallel operations is re-computed and set in various places. In this ticket, we unify this to one central place in `sage.env`, which is then reused across the whole infrastructure. The only exception is the script `build/bin/sage-build-num-threads` which is only needed in the build of the `sage-conf` package. This can probably be improved as well, but we leave it for a follow-up ticket.

Changes in detail:
- Remove SAGE_NUM_THREADS_PARALLEL since it was only used for the docbuild.
- Introduce the method `thread_count` in `sage.env` that based on the environment variable `SAGE_NUM_THREADS` and the number of CPUs computes the number of parallel jobs sage should use.
- Use this method (or its cached value `THREAD_COUNT`) everywhere where previously `SAGE_NUM_THREADS` has been used.
- Remove a few places that also calculated the number of CPUs or number of parallel jobs.
- In particular, remove the computation of the number of threads to use in the make files. This is now exclusively handled through `sage.env`.
- Don't specify `SAGE_NUM_THREADS` on CI, but let this be calculated using the number of CPUs available.

I'm concerned with mathematicians not knowing that they should change it and so accidentally overloading a system. We should not rely on users knowing what they're doing.

Users who need speed will figure out how to change
a low default to something higher.

They can set the number of threads to use
for parallel computations in their `init.sage`.

I took the `cpu_count` function from python as a blueprint, but can change the naming of course if you think `num_threads` is easier / more common.

I didn't delete this script, but only the one in src/bin.

I think you misunderstood me. I didn't change the user-facing multiprocessing for calculation, i.e. what `ncpus` in `sage/parallel` returns (at least if I don't overlook something). This still first returns `SAGE_NUM_THREADS` if set, and only as a fallback uses the number of cores. What I changed was that other parallel processes follow the same strategy. This change should only impact devs that compile sage and run doctests. I'm not sure if it really makes sense to be more strict there than with user-facing calculations. I would expect that devs have more knowledge that they might need to restrict parallel computations in order to not negatively impact their system.

Anyway, if the special treatment of compilation and doctests is indeed preferred, what would be a good default? No parallelization at all if the user doesn't specify SAGE_NUM_THREADS?

You deleted its use in `build/make/install`
