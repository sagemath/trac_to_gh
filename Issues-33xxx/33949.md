<a id='comment:2'></a>
What is the rationale?

(1) Setting Singular ring is not expensive anymore.

(2) `have_ring` is not set `True` anywhere in Sage, and practically not used.

(3) Both.

#2331 seems to say that before libSingular, `set_ring()` was expensive, and `have_ring` option was useful, but after libSingular, `set_ring()` is a breeze, and `have_ring` is useless.

Me neither.

It seems code like `_singular_(singular).set_ring()` is using the singular pexpect interface. It is really expensive. On my system, it takes about 100 microsecond. Hence those comments are still relevant. Sorry...
