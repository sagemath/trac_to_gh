```
Let's try to invert an element of a
finite-dimensional algebra over a field:

```
sage: QS3 = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, 3)
sage: qs = lambda p: QS3(Permutation(p))
sage: a = 3 * qs([1, 2, 3]) + qs([1, 3, 2]) + qs([2, 1, 3]))
sage: b = ~a; b
```
At the moment, this is not implemented.
The branch attached provides a naive implementation.

It does overshadow the `__invert__` method on
`AlgebrasWithBasis`, which however is unable to
invert anything but a scalar multiple of the unity
(and that only in the case when the unity is a
basis element). In theory, this could be a problem,
but I don't expect it to be.

I hope it doesn't overshadow any more efficient
`__invert__` methods on other classes of algebras
via diamond inheritance. Anyone who knows the hierarchy?

This is good to add. I think we should have a shortcut for scalars of the identity when `1` is a basis element (via `one_basis()`).

Since from-category methods are low in the MRO, there shouldn't be any danger of overshadowing more specific implementations.

How could this fail to find an inverse when one did exist? I imagine there has to be some condition on the ground ring.

We probably should also force the coefficients into the base ring (which will fail when it has say 1/2 when over **Z** as it should). I would add a `coerce=False` (to keep the current optimized behavior in the code elsewhere) to `from_vector` that passes that off to `_from_dict`.

For pushing to trac, perhaps check that your public key on trac? Perhaps something got changed on your computer too?

Thanks. Should we just check for the case when both `self` and `alg.one()` have length 1 (I assume we can use `len()` to get the number of nonzero coefficients, right?) and divide the coefficients?

> Since from-category methods are low in the MRO, there shouldn't be any danger of overshadowing more specific implementations.

I hope so, but I'm worried that some categories themselves might be specific (e.g., what if we have some kind of, say, "division rings" category that has its own implementation of inverses?).

> How could this fail to find an inverse when one did exist? I imagine there has to be some condition on the ground ring.

That would happen if the ground ring doesn't know enough linear algebra to support `solve_right`. I'm not sure what a good example would be.

Yeah, that sounds reasonable.

My key is on trac, but yes, something changed on my computer (recent reinstall), and something seems to have changed on the server as well (the change from git:// to https://). I'd be happy to discuss this over zoom.
