We have:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(7))
sage: print( (x-5).roots(multiplicities=False)[0].parent() is R.base_ring() )
True
```
but at the same time:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(Integers(21))
sage: print( (x-5).roots(multiplicities=False)[0].parent() is R.base_ring() )
False
```
In the latter example, `.roots()` returns elements of `ZZ` rather than `Integers(21)`.

Keywords: root, parent, IntegerModRing
