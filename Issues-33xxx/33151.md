Contrary to what is claimed in the README in https://pypi.org/project/sage-conf/9.5rc0/, after `pip install  sage_conf==9.5rc0`, there is no wheelhouse available: `ls $(sage-config SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS)` gives "No such file or directory".

We fix this by changing `make build-local` to `make build` in the install script (and fixing a bug that caused `make build` to fail).
