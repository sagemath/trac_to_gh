Upstreaming the work done for https://github.com/3-manifolds/Sage_macOS

https://github.com/3-manifolds/Sage_macOS/blob/main/Sage_framework/build_big_sage.sh

Also we could add targets like: `all-optional-ignoring-errors-a-k` -> matching packages starting with `[a-k]`. This could simplify CI scripts like seen in #33062
