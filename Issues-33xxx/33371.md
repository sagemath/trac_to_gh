On rare occasions when I've installed a binary, it has run a script to hardcode various library locations, and I wonder if it uses `sage-location`. (To be honest, I don't know the status of binary distributions of Sage anymore.)

This isn't working for me as an incremental upgrade. After building Sage 9.6.beta2, I checked out this branch and ran `make`. It failed almost immediately, complaining that 

```
[sagelib-9.6.beta2] error: file '.../sage-9.6.beta2/pkgs/sagemath-standard/bin/sage-location' does not exist
```

(Does anyone use the script `sage-update-src`? Maybe that should go next.)
