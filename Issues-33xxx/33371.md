On rare occasions when I've installed a binary, it has run a script to hardcode various library locations, and I wonder if it uses `sage-location`.

[sagelib-9.6.beta2] error: file '.../sage-9.6.beta2/pkgs/sagemath-standard/bin/sage-location' does not exist
```

(Does anyone use the script `sage-update-src`? Maybe that should go next.)
