This new option is similar to `--all` but 
- it tests all Sage modules installed (in `SAGE_LIB`) instead of `SAGE_SRC`. (This will be useful for testing modularized distributions such as #32601.)
- it tests the installed Sage documentation (specifically, the `.rst.txt` files installed in `html/**/_sources`) instead of `SAGE_DOC_SRC`.

```
$ ./sage -tp --installed

(Actually, because portions of namespace packages can be installed in separate locations, the variable `sage.env.SAGE_LIB` is no longer meaningful. Instead, we make use of the `__path__` attribute of packages, https://python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/import.html#module-path, which in the case of namespace packages is an iterable.)

This would also make sense for distribution packaging, which no longer would have to rely on the fallbacks `SAGE_SRC` -> `SAGE_LIB` and `SAGE_DOC_SRC -> SAGE_DOC`.



Part of Meta-ticket #33037.

I think the move makes some sense especially in the context of the elimination of `SAGE_LIB` and potentially more variables as sage matures more in the future.

The only thing I am not sure is introducing a new option. Why not make it the default instead? What workflow would that prevent?

I think the default is valuable because doctests can be written / updated and immediately tested without having to build the Sage library.

More to the point, it is a pain in the workflow to recompile in that case. But you should explicitly test a file or directory in that case. But let's go with a developer focused for now.

We may want to suggest not to use `--installed` and `--all` at the same time for distros as it will try to add a non-existent path once we remove the default `SAGE_SRC` -> `SAGE_LIB`. Also the current `--all` will catch `sage_setup`, `sage_docbuild` and `SAGE_DOC_SRC` (which in distros will point to `SAGE_DOC`). But `--installed` doesn't do any of that. Should it?

Let's leave it for another clean up ticket. I am already quite happy that we fixed the `.rst.txt` thing in this one. I'll want a clean slate in my brain to think properly of all the consequences when we get to it.

It was good work on this one, thank you for all the commits :)

If you have nothing to add, it is a positive review from me.

While it is unrelated to eliminating `SAGE_*` variables, there is something related to testing an installed sage that we need to address in a follow up. pytest doesn't work if you cannot write in the "rootdir" of what is tested.

There are two issues with that. First it may leave unwanted files all over the place. Second it fails miserably if you try to test something that is read-only.

There seem to be some option to change where the cache is created (`-o cache_dir=$somelocation`) but I have so far failed to integrate it successfully in `sage-runtest` when `pytest` is called.
