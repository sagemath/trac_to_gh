(from [#33650 comment:32](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/33650#comment:32))

It was moved in #29111 to `build/bin/sage-site`, but it does have some (limited - #30475) functionality for users.

**sage-docbuild** would be declared as an `install-requires` of **sagemath-standard**. #29941 also declares it as an `extras-require` of **sagemath-environment**.

I'm a little concerned about things breaking if we just use `python -m sage_docbuild`, based on this snippet from `sage-site`:

```

    # Redirect stdin from /dev/null. This helps with running TeX which
    # tends to ask interactive questions if something goes wrong. These
    # cause the build to hang. If stdin is /dev/null, TeX just aborts.
    shift

    # Trac #30002: ensure an English locale so that it is possible to
    # scrape out warnings by pattern matching.
    export LANG=C
    export LANGUAGE=C

    # See #30351: bugs in macOS implementations of openblas/libgopm can cause
    # docbuild to hang if multiple OpenMP threads are allowed.
    if [ `uname` = 'Darwin' ]; then
        export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
    fi

    # Trac #33650: Make sure that user configuration of Jupyter does not
    # shadow our sagemath kernel when jupyter-sphinx is invoked

I'll admit that I don't have some of that baggage in sage-on-gentoo. If I was needing any of that stuff to build the doc, I would set it up before running the make invocation. 

The `LANG`/`LANGUAGE` is something I expect from my environment for sanity (possibly a mistake :) ). The darwin thing could be handled if I go back to supporting gentoo-prefix on Mac. I build in a sandbox where user settings for jupyter will not affect me (gentoo-prefix may need checking for that scenario).

The `/dev/null` thing is probably something that need to be added to what I have done so far.

I am mostly seeing `sage --docbuild` as a relic from the past, but yes that cruft needs attention.

> I am mostly seeing `sage --docbuild` as a relic from the past

In #29941, I am making `src/bin/sage` part of a small basic distribution **sagemath-environment**, so that users can invoke, for example, `sage --sh` even when nothing else of Sage is installed. Options such as `sage --docbuild`, of course, will not work when nothing else is installed -- so the script could inform users what to install in this case.

LGTM, but this comment:

```
+    # Redirect stdin from /dev/null. This helps with running TeX which
+    # tends to ask interactive questions if something goes wrong. These
+    # cause the build to hang. If stdin is /dev/null, TeX just aborts.
```
is in a strange place (already in the original).
It would be better placed just before 

```
+    exec sage-python -m sage_docbuild "$@" </dev/null
```
