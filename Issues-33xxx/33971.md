The height of a dynamical system is currently calculated as the max of the heights of the coefficients, which is incorrect. To avoid writing a complicated formula, the correct height can be thought of as treating the coefficients of all coordinate functions as one big projective point and taking the height of that. For example

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
f=DynamicalSystem([1/25*x^2 + 25/3*x*y+y^2,1*y^2])
exp(f.global_height())
```

gives 25, but should be 625.

<a id='comment:13'></a>A couple issues here

- The dimension of the projective space is off by 1. It should be

```
P = ProjectiveSpace(K, len(coeffs)-1)
```

- I'd suggest having one less variable defined

```
proj_point = P.point(coeffs)
return proj_point.global_height()
```
to

```
return P.point(coeffs).global_height()
```

- correct the doc string to describe what this height is actually doing. (i.e., this is the global height of the coefficents as a projective point)

- There seems to be an issue with scaling. The definition of height should be independent of the representative, so these should return the same height. I suggest adding an example for this too. There is an issue somewhere as these are giving different values.

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
f=DynamicalSystem([1/25*x^2 + 25/3*x*y+y^2,1*y^2])
print(f.global_height())
c=10000
f.scale_by(c)
f.global_height()
```

- These should be implemented for Affine Dynamical systems too. Careful here that you construct the correct projective point; it may be simplest to homogenize the dynamical system first and then call the projective version (don't forget the case of morphisms between spaces of different dimensions).

- The local_height and local_height_arch seem not to be implemented for affine morphisms at all yet.

<a id='comment:25'></a>The functionality works when the domain and codomain have the same dimension, but not when they do not.

```

H = Hom(P,A)
f = H([1/1331*x^2 + 4000*y*z,y^2])
