The height of a dynamical system is currently calculated as the max of the heights of the coefficients, which is incorrect. To avoid writing a complicated formula, the correct height can be thought of as treating the coefficients of all coordinate functions as one big projective point and taking the height of that. For example

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
f=DynamicalSystem([1/25*x^2 + 25/3*x*y+y^2,1*y^2])
exp(f.global_height())
```

gives 25, but should be 625.

The return values of the examples in the docstring of `global_height` in `projective_morphism.py` are same as before, except for the first one (current result is something like 20.83484...):


```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
sage: H = Hom(P,P)
sage: f = H([1/1331*x^2+1/4000*y^2, 210*x*y]);
sage: f.global_height()
8.29404964010203
```

I also added the example from description to the documentation.

A couple issues here

- The dimension of the projective space is off by 1. It should be

```
P = ProjectiveSpace(K, len(coeffs)-1)
```

- I'd suggest having one less variable defined

```
proj_point = P.point(coeffs)
return proj_point.global_height()
```
to

```
return P.point(coeffs).global_height()
```

- correct the doc string to describe what this height is actually doing. (i.e., this is the global height of the coefficents as a projective point)

- There seems to be an issue with scaling. The definition of height should be independent of the representative, so these should return the same height. I suggest adding an example for this too. There is an issue somewhere as these are giving different values.

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
f=DynamicalSystem([1/25*x^2 + 25/3*x*y+y^2,1*y^2])
print(f.global_height())
c=10000
f.scale_by(c)
f.global_height()
```

- These should be implemented for Affine Dynamical systems too. Careful here that you construct the correct projective point; it may be simplest to homogenize the dynamical system first and then call the projective version (don't forget the case of morphisms between spaces of different dimensions).

- The local_height and local_height_arch seem not to be implemented for affine morphisms at all yet.

- add description to the affine one that you are taking the height of the homogenization.

-doc test failures:

```
1 item had failures:
   3 of  32 in sage.schemes.projective.projective_morphism.SchemeMorphism_polynomial_projective_space.global_height
    [612 tests, 3 failures, 4.79 s]
```
I did not run the full set of doc tests, so be sure to do so.

- docs fail to build

The functionality works when the domain and codomain have the same dimension, but not when they do not.

```
P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
A.<z,w>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
H = Hom(P,A)
f = H([1/1331*x^2 + 4000*y*z,y^2])
f.global_height()
```

```
P.<x,y> = AffineSpace(QQ,2)
A.<z>=AffineSpace(QQ,1)
H = Hom(P,A)
f = H([1/1331*x^2 + 4000*y])
f.global_height()
```

This example no longer makes sense since normalization does not have an effect on the height. Delete the text and the second half of the example.

```
        This function does not automatically normalize::

            sage: P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(ZZ,2)
            sage: H = Hom(P,P)
            sage: f = H([4*x^2 + 100*y^2, 210*x*y, 10000*z^2]);
            sage: f.global_height()
            8.51719319141624
            sage: f.normalize_coordinates()
            sage: f.global_height()
            8.51719319141624
