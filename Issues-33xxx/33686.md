Currently the arguments `point`, `line`, `polygon` are booleans or dictionaries, giving plotting attributes such as color for the elements of dimension 0, 1, 2 in the plot.

We extend this interface by allowing to pass a function instead.
This extends the special case of "rainbow" introduced in #31802.

Component: **graphics**
