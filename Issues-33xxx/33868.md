I see. I forgot that... Anyway I will think of a way to raise an exception less surprising in such cases, or provide a simple implementation of submodules of such ambient modules. 

I was working with morphisms between modules over multivariate polynomial rings, and tried to get the image and the kernel of a morphism. I did't know even submodules are not in place...

Actually what I need is submodules of free modules (of finite rank) over graded multivariate polynomial rings. The grading may be multigrades, that is, by integer vectors. Then are these modules included in `fp_graded` modules?

I don't know how well tested the code is for multigradings, but in principle it should work. The biggest issue I think is polynomial rings do not know they are multigraded. We can hack around this with an appropriate subclass of `CombinatorialFreeModule` that uses a free monoid as its indexing set. However, do not expect algebraic operations to be fast, or have some other polynomial features like division, Gröbner bases, etc.

The easiest fix for this issue would probably be to just modify the `_vector_` to take `order` and ignore it. I can't promise there won't be another compatibility issue, but we can fix those as we encounter them.

Moreover, these modules like `fp_graded` seem intended for modules over algebras and these algebras are not primarily commutative. I see "graded commutative" in sage.algebras.commutative_dga, but this is not "graded" + "commutative".

These seem to be not proper tools to work with the usual graded polynomials rings and modules needed for computational commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.

That is true. They are meant to work with general (likely associative unital) algebras. It does not have the linear algebra quite so close at hand, but they might fair a bit better when moving outside of free modules. We need to have more native support for non-free modules, some of which for commutative base rings can be pulled from singular.

> These seem to be not proper tools to work with the usual graded polynomials rings and modules needed for computational commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.


I don't quite know what you are hoping to compute as it is a bit too far outside of my area. The code here can do some homological algebra. John might know more about how it could be applied.

PS - The `order` argument is for free modules that do not necessarily have a fixed/well-defined ordering of the basis elements. However, to (efficiently) do the linear algebra, we need to chose an ordering of the basis to manipulate the matrices. Thus this is used to convert to/from the implementation with a fixed ordering.

> PS - The `order` argument is for free modules that do not necessarily have a fixed/well-defined ordering of the basis elements. However, to (efficiently) do the linear algebra, we need to choose an ordering of the basis to manipulate the matrices. Thus this is used to convert to/from the implementation with a fixed ordering.


Thanks for explanation.

Done in the last commit. I used the name `FreeModule_base`, as the base class of modules whose elements are represented by elements of a free module. `FreeModule_generic` is such a base class but it is for modules with a basis. `FreeModule_base` are for modules without a basis.

There is no natural map from the ambient free module to a submodule. There is a natural coercion map from the ambient free module to a quotient. This map is really what I need for the free resolutions.

I think that was basically a typo: I think the suggestion was that it might be good to have a shortcut way to construct the morphism from the submodule to the ambient free module. The finitely presented module code, for example, rather than constructing a submodule `M` instead constructs the inclusion map `M -> F`.

<a id='comment:43'></a>Thank you for doing the refactoring. I think this is better and reflects the mathematics.

Yes, that was a typo; I was also thinking of the morphism to the quotient module too.

From the patchbot, you have some doctest failures:

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=[snip] src/sage/manifolds/chart.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --random-seed=[snip] src/sage/rings/padics/padic_generic_element.pyx  # 8 doctests failed
```

I am not sure I like the generic class called `FreeModule_base` as it suggests that it is a free module. Perhaps `ModuleWithAmbientFreeModule` (or `Module_with_free_ambient`)?

Do we also want that class to have a `rank()` method? I feel like that should belong only to the free module subclasses.

By "the second", you mean `'sage.misc.cachefunc.cached_method' imported but unused`? This is really an unused import. I removed it.

Sorry about those many tiny changes (and not so tiny reformatting of the modules documentation), not strictly related with this ticket. Hopefully they are all for better readability of source files (and the documentation).

> I don't really like the extra blanklines between bulletpoint items, much less making a de facto standard through an unrelated ticket).


I see. I guess you mean specifically the extra blankline in the `AUTHORS` section. I removed it.

I did think the blanklines in `AUTHORS` section is standard. But as I now checked source files, they are not uniform in this matter. I do think there should be a standard though. But this ticket is not a place for the discussion.

Sorry, I had transposed the two when I wrote my comment. It was the `FreeModule_base` that no longer existed with your refactoring and that code path in the quotient module comparison code.

I am not sure how much I agree, and there are a number of conventions being chosen. The first/title line capitalization and some of the other formatting things are another example of things I don't think we have standardized or discussed as a community. It is not so good that we don't have consistency in the doc.

Not just that but more broadly throughout the Sage documentation. However, we have not set any standard about this AFAIK.

> I did think the blanklines in `AUTHORS` section is standard. But as I now checked source files, they are not uniform in this matter. I do think there should be a standard though. But this ticket is not a place for the discussion.  


I remember the Sage dev guide not having this in its example before. Anyways, this is not the place to be deciding standards.

At some point, I wished consistency in the formatting of the first line in the header of source files, as different formats used by different authors really made the tables of contents of our html documentation look ugly. So in some ticket, I put the "standard" header format into the developer manual:

But as far as I remember this was not openly discussed in the sage-devel. If you think the format suggested in the developer manual is not "right" in some way (like the blanklines in the `AUTHOR` section), please open a discussion there. It would be good that we have a standard that most developers agree.

This is possible if the base ring is a multivariate polynomial ring, using Groebner bases. For general rings, I think there is no meaningful equality check (for submodules).

There was another `__init__()` method that you moved from the refactoring that doesn't have any doctests. Anyways, since it was already like that, you don't need to do anything.

> A subclass of `Module_free_ambient` can work with more specific `Module_free_ambient` modules, like submodules, quotient modules, or subquotient modules (not yet implemented) of free ambient modules. These subclasses could implement `__richcmp__` using Groebner bases on firm mathematical ground.   


Only when the base ring is a multivariate polynomial ring. For a general ring, I have no idea...

We may have a separate `__richcmp__` for `Module_free_ambient`, that does the simple cases. As you say, there are obvious cases that can answer `True` or `False`. In other cases, we may raise an exception.

- Degree 1 submodules now compare correctly:
  {{{
sage: S.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: M = S**1
sage: N2 = M.submodule([M([x^2]), M([y^2])])
sage: N1 = M.submodule([M([x]), M([y])])
sage: N2.is_submodule(N1)
True
sage: N2 < N1
True
sage: N1 < N2
False
  }}}
- Zero submodules now also compare correctly too.
- Things are also prepared to implement more specialized comparisons, such as modules over polynomial rings (although some minor refactoring might be needed to avoid code duplication).
- The `is_submodule()` is used for comparisons.
- I don't understand your comment about `S1` and `S2`. That returns `False` with your branch for me.

I believe we can push the comparison code a bit further by rejecting the modules that do not have containment with extension of scalars over the fraction field.

I don't think you can conclude that from the above, nor do I think that is the problem. I do not get this failure when only changing the comparison code. It only happens when I make the free quotient a subclass of the generic quotient. To me, this seems to be a very subtle behavior change in the quotient module, but I cannot see what actually changes.

It somehow seems to be loosing one additional coercion check:

```
checking _coerce_map_from_ Vector space of dimension 1 over Finite Field of size 2
self: Vector space quotient V/W of dimension 1 over Finite Field of size 2 where
V: Vector space of dimension 2 over Finite Field of size 2
W: Vector space of degree 2 and dimension 1 over Finite Field of size 2
Basis matrix:

I see that this is missing against `develop` by adding a `print()` inside the quotient's `_coerce_map_from_`. (I even checked with using the same constructor as the `develop` version and making sure the `super()` calls are correct too.) The MRO only differs in the added classes marked with a `#`:

```
sage: A = QQ^5; V = A.span_of_basis([[1,0,-1,1,1], [1,-1,0,2/3,3/4]]); W = V.span_of_basis([V.0 - 2/3*V.1]); Q = V / W
sage: Q.__class__.__mro__
(<class 'sage.modules.quotient_module.FreeModule_ambient_field_quotient_with_category'>,

I am out of ideas for this today.

I don't want the zero submodule of a quotient to compare equal to the zero submodule of the `cover()` free module. I am thinking actually of implementing an `ambient_free_module()` and using that do the linear algebra, which will be different than `ambient_module()`, which would be what is currently the `defining_module()`.

If we implement a subquotient, then that would be another way out of the above issue of submodule comparisons. Do we really want a separate class for submodules of free modules and submodules of (general) quotient modules? This would further split the generic modules and free modules implementations.

Why? The "hack" I am referring to has to do with submodule definitions that is independent of `__richcmp__`. I can remove the submodules of quotient modules and still have the comparison (which  I would argue should be there to protect against mathematically wrong answers, see `S1 != S2`).

It seems we think different things for `Submodule_free_ambient`, and `Quotient_free_ambient`. 

`Submodule_free_ambient` is the class of **submodules of an ambient free module**. `S1` and `S2` here:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: F = P**2
sage: F
Ambient free module of rank 2 over the integral domain Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
sage: S1 = F.submodule([(x,y),(y,x)])
sage: S2 = F.submodule([(x,y)])
```
A submodule is the row space of a matrix over the base ring. In this sense, a submodule is defined by a matrix.

`Quotient_free_ambient` is the class of **quotient of an ambient free module by a submodule of the ambient free module**. `Q1` and `Q2` here:

```
sage: Q1 = F.quotient(S1)
sage: Q2 = F.quotient(S2)
```

Now if we do (hypothetically as we do not have subquotients yet),

```
sage: SQ = Q2.submodule(S1)
```
Then `SQ` is a subquotient. Mathematically it is S1/S2. Hence it is defined by **two matrices**.

So subquotients (submodules of quotients) need a separate class, perhaps `Subquotient_free_ambient`.

Under these definitions, what do you mean by `defining_module()` of a submodule? To me,  `ambient_module`, `ambient_free_module`, `defining_module` refer to the same thing!

Without your `defining_module()` and `submodule()` of quotients, does your `__richcmp__` meaningfully work with no doctest failures? I thought you introduced them to make `__richcmp__` work with no doctest failures. That is why I called them "inadequate hacks" (no intention to be personal).
