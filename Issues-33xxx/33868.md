We improve the situation by adding modules over integral domains. Thus we can do at least

sage: N

Generated by the rows of the matrix:
[x - y z - w]
[  y*z   x*w]

I see many module-related methods accept this `order` argument. It is not immediately clear what is the role of this argument. I guess it gives an "order" to the basis...

As dimpase pointed out on sage-devel, many things are just not implemented for modules over infinite-dimensional rings. The recently added `modules/fp_graded` (finitely presented modules over graded connected rings) implements some things, but only in a graded setting.

I see. I forgot that... Anyway I will think of a way to raise an exception less surprising in such cases, or provide a simple implementation of submodules of such ambient modules. 

I was working with morphisms between modules over multivariate polynomial rings, and tried to get the image and the kernel of a morphism. I did't know even submodules are not in place...

Actually what I need is submodules of free modules (of finite rank) over graded multivariate polynomial rings. The grading may be multigrades, that is, by integer vectors. Then are these modules included in `fp_graded` modules?

I don't know how well tested the code is for multigradings, but in principle it should work. The biggest issue I think is polynomial rings do not know they are multigraded. We can hack around this with an appropriate subclass of `CombinatorialFreeModule` that uses a free monoid as its indexing set. However, do not expect algebraic operations to be fast, or have some other polynomial features like division, Gröbner bases, etc.

The easiest fix for this issue would probably be to just modify the `_vector_` to take `order` and ignore it. I can't promise there won't be another compatibility issue, but we can fix those as we encounter them.

Moreover, these modules like `fp_graded` seem intended for modules over algebras and these algebras are not primarily commutative. I see "graded commutative" in sage.algebras.commutative_dga, but this is not "graded" + "commutative".

These seem to be not proper tools to work with the usual graded polynomials rings and modules needed for computational commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.

That is true. They are meant to work with general (likely associative unital) algebras. It does not have the linear algebra quite so close at hand, but they might fair a bit better when moving outside of free modules. We need to have more native support for non-free modules, some of which for commutative base rings can be pulled from singular.

I don't quite know what you are hoping to compute as it is a bit too far outside of my area. The code here can do some homological algebra. John might know more about how it could be applied.

PS - The `order` argument is for free modules that do not necessarily have a fixed/well-defined ordering of the basis elements. However, to (efficiently) do the linear algebra, we need to chose an ordering of the basis to manipulate the matrices. Thus this is used to convert to/from the implementation with a fixed ordering.

Replying to [tscrim](#comment%3A8):

> I don't quite know what you are hoping to compute as it is a bit too far outside of my area. The code here can do some homological algebra. John might know more about how it could be applied.


I am working on graded free resolutions of graded modules over polynomial rings, pulling the resolution machinery of Singular. Hence I really don't need to compute with the modules in Sage, but just need the framework. As it is not there, perhaps I can work with matrices instead.

> PS - The `order` argument is for free modules that do not necessarily have a fixed/well-defined ordering of the basis elements. However, to (efficiently) do the linear algebra, we need to choose an ordering of the basis to manipulate the matrices. Thus this is used to convert to/from the implementation with a fixed ordering.


Thanks for explanation.

Now `FreeModule_generic`, which is the base class of all modules, does not assume that a rank is defined (or an echelon form of its basis matrix is defined). The argument `rank` is `None` in this case.

The change allows a room for `FreeModule_generic_domain` the class of modules over an integral domain, for which there is no notion of rank. Submodules and quotient modules of ambient free modules over a domain can be constructed. There is no attempt to provide a "rank" (or an "echelon form" of the defining matrix) for them.

It now seems to me that classes `FreeModule_submodule_...` defined in `sage.modules.free_module` are intended for (mathematical) free modules, but just embedded as a submodule (of a free module). Hence they all have mathematically well-defined notion of rank (but still possibly no echelon form). 

Then it seems wrong to insert submodules of free modules over a domain (without well-defined notion of rank) here...

Now submodules of free modules over a domain is defined in new `submodule.py`.

I also cleaned up modules toc tree.

Some quick comments:

- For `submodule.py`, I don't think it is good to call the generators basis elements since that implies it is a free module. It would be better to call them generators.
- It might be good to have a shortcut way to construct the morphism from the ambient free module into the submodule in order to do homological algebra (a la the finitely presented graded modules code; but perhaps one needs a little more finite-dimensional-ness coming from the grading to do anything meaningful).

Done in the last commit. I used the name `FreeModule_base`, as the base class of modules whose elements are represented by elements of a free module. `FreeModule_generic` is such a base class but it is for modules with a basis. `FreeModule_base` are for modules without a basis.

There is no natural map from the ambient free module to a submodule. There is a natural coercion map from the ambient free module to a quotient. This map is really what I need for the free resolutions.

I think that was basically a typo: I think the suggestion was that it might be good to have a shortcut way to construct the morphism from the submodule to the ambient free module. The finitely presented module code, for example, rather than constructing a submodule `M` instead constructs the inclusion map `M -> F`.

Thank you for doing the refactoring. I think this is better and reflects the mathematics.

Yes, that was a typo; I was also thinking of the morphism to the quotient module too.

From the patchbot, you have some doctest failures:

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=[snip] src/sage/manifolds/chart.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --random-seed=[snip] src/sage/rings/padics/padic_generic_element.pyx  # 8 doctests failed
```

I am not sure I like the generic class called `FreeModule_base` as it suggests that it is a free module. Perhaps `ModuleWithAmbientFreeModule` (or `Module_with_free_ambient`)?

Do we also want that class to have a `rank()` method? I feel like that should belong only to the free module subclasses.

Sorry, I had transposed the two when I wrote my comment. It was the `FreeModule_base` that no longer existed with your refactoring and that code path in the quotient module comparison code.

Not just that but more broadly throughout the Sage documentation. However, we have not set any standard about this AFAIK.

At some point, I wished consistency in the formatting of the first line in the header of source files, as different formats used by different authors really made the tables of contents of our html documentation look ugly. So in some ticket, I put the "standard" header format into the developer manual:

Indeed, I should do that so we can set a standard.

Onto some more technical parts of the review:

- Why not have `Module_free_ambient` use the richcmp? I feel like the comparison method makes sense in the non-free case.
- You should add doctests for the `__init__` method you added. Ideally, it should be both, but one of them is just moved and not necessary.
- Some doc formatting:

  ```diff
  -    - ``sparse`` -- bool (default: False)
  +    - ``sparse`` -- boolean (default: ``False``)
   
       - ``coordinate_ring`` -- a ring containing ``base_ring``
         (default: equal to ``base_ring``)

This is possible if the base ring is a multivariate polynomial ring, using Groebner bases. For general rings, I think there is no meaningful equality check (for submodules).

There was another `__init__()` method that you moved from the refactoring that doesn't have any doctests. Anyways, since it was already like that, you don't need to do anything.

Here is a version that makes some feeble attempt at comparisons for general modules. With the first commit, all (short) tests pass in the modules folder. I haven't really tested this to see what it is capable of or if there are any bugs (I have been trying to figure out the issue below).

@jhpalmieri I have cc-ed you to see if you have an idea about what could be causing this. I am stuck as the output of the different quotient modules seems to be the same. I don't know how that is working well enough to be able to debug it further.

If we have no idea what is causing this, we can simply revert the last commit.

One wrinkle in the current implementation is the ambient module of a quotient module:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(9); A = k^3; V = A.span_of_basis([[1,0,a], [a,a,1]]); W = V.span([V.1])
sage: Q = V/W
sage: Q.ambient_module() is Q
True

Unfortunately `__eq__` cannot return anything other than `True` or `False`.

So I have hacked around some issues: In particular, submodules of a quotient module and the free module should not be comparable. So I have a `defining_module()` attribute so there is no confusion with `ambient_module()`. It leads to some fairly ugly code, but it was the easiest thing to do without further doing major overhauls. I also moved up the `submodule()` and `span()` code as they work in more generality. The code is telling me that it should just override `ambient_module()`. However, then the ambient module for quotients will need some care, and likely the comparison code too.

- Degree 1 submodules now compare correctly:

  ```
  sage: S.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
  sage: M = S**1
  sage: N2 = M.submodule([M([x^2]), M([y^2])])
  sage: N1 = M.submodule([M([x]), M([y])])
  sage: N2.is_submodule(N1)
  True
  sage: N2 < N1
  True
  sage: N1 < N2
  False
  ```
- Zero submodules now also compare correctly too.
- Things are also prepared to implement more specialized comparisons, such as modules over polynomial rings (although some minor refactoring might be needed to avoid code duplication).
- The `is_submodule()` is used for comparisons.
- I don't understand your comment about `S1` and `S2`. That returns `False` with your branch for me.

I believe we can push the comparison code a bit further by rejecting the modules that do not have containment with extension of scalars over the fraction field.

I don't think you can conclude that from the above, nor do I think that is the problem. I do not get this failure when only changing the comparison code. It only happens when I make the free quotient a subclass of the generic quotient. To me, this seems to be a very subtle behavior change in the quotient module, but I cannot see what actually changes.

Ah, now `S1 != S2` also returns `False`.

It somehow seems to be loosing one additional coercion check:

```
checking _coerce_map_from_ Vector space of dimension 1 over Finite Field of size 2
self: Vector space quotient V/W of dimension 1 over Finite Field of size 2 where
V: Vector space of dimension 2 over Finite Field of size 2
W: Vector space of degree 2 and dimension 1 over Finite Field of size 2
Basis matrix:
[1 0]
```
I see that this is missing against `develop` by adding a `print()` inside the quotient's `_coerce_map_from_`. (I even checked with using the same constructor as the `develop` version and making sure the `super()` calls are correct too.) The MRO only differs in the added classes marked with a `#`:

```
sage: A = QQ^5; V = A.span_of_basis([[1,0,-1,1,1], [1,-1,0,2/3,3/4]]); W = V.span_of_basis([V.0 - 2/3*V.1]); Q = V / W
sage: Q.__class__.__mro__
(<class 'sage.modules.quotient_module.FreeModule_ambient_field_quotient_with_category'>,
 <class 'sage.modules.quotient_module.FreeModule_ambient_field_quotient'>,
 <class 'sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule_ambient_field'>,
 <class 'sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule_generic_field'>,
 <class 'sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule_ambient_pid'>,
 <class 'sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule_generic_pid'>,
 <class 'sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule_ambient_domain'>,
 <class 'sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule_generic_domain'>,  #

 <class 'sage.modules.quotient_module.QuotientModule_free_ambient'>,  #
 <class 'sage.modules.free_module.Module_free_ambient'>,  #
```

I am out of ideas for this today.

You added `defining_module()` as a public method. What is the "defining module" of a submodule from a user's perspective? It should be something different from `ambient_module()`.

You added `submodule()` of `QuotientModule_free_ambient`. It should return a submodule of a quotient module, but it returns an instance of `Submodule_free_ambient`. For submodules of a quotient module, we should have a new class `Subquotient_free_ambient` (as in Macaulay2), but this is not yet implemented.

Frankly I want to revert back to my last commit, as `__richcmp__` for `Module_free_ambient` is not a prerequisite but a missing feature. It would be great to have `__richcmp__` method but as you say, we should think more from a higher level to avoid introducing inadequate hacks. We may open a new ticket for `__richcmp__`.

I don't want the zero submodule of a quotient to compare equal to the zero submodule of the `cover()` free module. I am thinking actually of implementing an `ambient_free_module()` and using that do the linear algebra, which will be different than `ambient_module()`, which would be what is currently the `defining_module()`.

> You added `submodule()` of `QuotientModule_free_ambient`. It should return a submodule of a quotient module, but it returns an instance of `Submodule_free_ambient`. For submodules of a quotient module, we should have a new class `Subquotient_free_ambient` (as in Macaulay2), but this is not yet implemented. 


If we implement a subquotient, then that would be another way out of the above issue of submodule comparisons. Do we really want a separate class for submodules of free modules and submodules of (general) quotient modules? This would further split the generic modules and free modules implementations.

Why? The "hack" I am referring to has to do with submodule definitions that is independent of `__richcmp__`. I can remove the submodules of quotient modules and still have the comparison (which  I would argue should be there to protect against mathematically wrong answers, see `S1 != S2`). That is a natural thing to want to construct, and it is not something that should require that much more work.

It seems we think different things for `Submodule_free_ambient`, and `Quotient_free_ambient`. 

`Submodule_free_ambient` is the class of **submodules of an ambient free module**. `S1` and `S2` here:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: F = P**2
sage: F
Ambient free module of rank 2 over the integral domain Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
sage: S1 = F.submodule([(x,y),(y,x)])
sage: S2 = F.submodule([(x,y)])
```
A submodule is the row space of a matrix over the base ring. In this sense, a submodule is defined by a matrix.

`Quotient_free_ambient` is the class of **quotient of an ambient free module by a submodule of the ambient free module**. `Q1` and `Q2` here:

```
sage: Q1 = F.quotient(S1)
sage: Q2 = F.quotient(S2)
```

Now if we do (hypothetically as we do not have subquotients yet),

```
sage: SQ = Q2.submodule(S1)
```
Then `SQ` is a subquotient. Mathematically it is S1/S2. Hence it is defined by **two matrices**.

So subquotients (submodules of quotients) need a separate class, perhaps `Subquotient_free_ambient`.

Under these definitions, what do you mean by `defining_module()` of a submodule? To me,  `ambient_module`, `ambient_free_module`, `defining_module` refer to the same thing!

Without your `defining_module()` and `submodule()` of quotients, does your `__richcmp__` meaningfully work with no doctest failures? I thought you introduced them to make `__richcmp__` work with no doctest failures. That is why I called them "inadequate hacks" (no intention to be personal).

Now we can take quotients of quotients, which keeps track of how it was created, as well as the defining matrices of generators and relations for future use in doing homological algebra (a la Macaulay2).

I also was able to remove redundant `span()` and `submodule()` by a new attribute that tells which class defines the submodules and by adding one call to `ambient_module()` when the base ring changes (which will very slightly slow down that code when ``self`` already is an ambient module, but this should be negligible).

I am now happy with the current capabilities of the code. It should be fairly future-proof. There might be some trivial failures around due to changing the error messages.

These are good.

I am 99% okay with this. I just have a very slight reservation that it doesn't make the free module version. Yet, it is not public facing and the classes are currently separate (although IMO they should not be), so this is okay with me.
