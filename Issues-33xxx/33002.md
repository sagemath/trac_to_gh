As a follow up of #20343, the current branch now allows to specify the output type of the `tikz` method of a polyhedron:

```
sage: co = polytopes.cuboctahedron()
sage: t = co.tikz([674,108,-731], 112, output_type='TikzPicture')
sage: t
\documentclass[tikz]{standalone}
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}%
        [x={(0.249656cm, -0.577639cm)},
        y={(0.777700cm, -0.358578cm)},
        z={(-0.576936cm, -0.733318cm)},
        scale=1.000000,

%%
%%
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
sage: t.pdf()
'/tmp/tmpobwhg3p7/tikz_o9dkz419.pdf'
```

We also change the default behavior in favor of `output_type='TikzPicture'`. A deprecation warnings is now sent when `output_type` is not given:

```
sage: co = polytopes.cuboctahedron()
sage: t = co.tikz([674,108,-731], 112)
... DeprecationWarning: Since SageMath 5.13 (ticket #12083), the method
 .tikz() of a polyhedron returns an object of type ``LatexExpr`` which is a 
Python str. Since SageMath 9.7, this default behavior of returning an object
 of type LatexExpr is deprecated as the default output will soon change to 
an object of type ``TikzPicture`` from the module sage.misc.latex_standalone
 (newly introduced in SageMath 9.6). Please update your code to specify the
 desired output type as ``.tikz(output_type='LatexExpr')`` to keep the old
 behavior or ``.tikz(output_type='TikzPicture')`` to use the future default
 behavior.

I would suggest to implement this for the function `Projection.tikz()` (of `geometry.polyhedron.plot`),
and then add the parameter `output_type` to `Polyhedron_base6.tikz()`.

One reason for that is sometimes you may want to modify the projection before drawing the polytope using TikZ.
For instance in #34113:
you may want to choose a different window facet for the Schlegel projection before drawing the polytope.
So something like this should work:

```
P.schlegel_projection(P.facets()[1]).tikz([1, 0, 0], output_type="TikzPicture")
```

Good comment. I did the change.

I also added a deprecation warning in favor of `output_type='TikzPicture'`.

I adapted the doctests in `sage/geometry/polyhedron` and in the doc.

Maybe there are remaining doctests to update? Let's see what the patchbots say.

I will have another look at the ticket (hopefully) tomorrow. For now:

* In `polytope_tikz.rst`: Please change `Since Version` to `Since version`.

* The deprecation message is long. Can you please make it shorted. Maybe something like this:

  ```
  The default type of the returned object will soon be changed from
  `sage.misc.latex.LatexExpr` to `sage.misc.latex_standalone.TikzPicture`.
  Please update your code to specify the desired output type
  as `.tikz(output_type='LatexExpr')` to keep the old behavior
  or `.tikz(output_type='TikzPicture')` to use the future default behavior.

In `polytope_tikz.rst`:
* Add full stop to the end of "... the raw TikZ picture of your polytope" 
* "you will have a file named.." -> " you will have two files.."

I suggest also:
<code>\`\`None\`\`(deprecated)</code> -> <code>\`\`None\`\` (to be deprecated)</code>

Thanks, i just added a commit which does that.

I think the definition of "deprecated" is that the option will be change or be gone in the future. An option *is* deprecated one or two years before it is gone. So, I keep it as it is for now.

Needs review. (I will be away from internet for the next two weeks).
