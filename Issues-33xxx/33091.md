I'm occasionally getting this timeout:

```
sage -t --random-seed=39014585829676668007219039140784171913 src/sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx
    Timed out
**********************************************************************
Tests run before process (pid=6202) timed out:
...
...
sage: all(L.change_ring(SR).is_Z_operator_on(K)
    for L in K.Z_operators_gens())  # long time ## line 17218 ##
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

I'm not using `--long` here, but this test is still running.

This is fixed if the `# long time` label is moved to the first line of the doctest.

The same file contains other multiline doctests labeled long in the second line.

In this ticket:
- We document that the label belongs on the first line.
- We add a test for this fairly common mistake to the linter (`./sage -tox -e relint`)
- We fix all uses

I honestly don't know if the label needs to be on the first line, or on all of them. I would think the "correct" place for the label is at the end of the logical line, though, since this is python.

I'm responsible for that doctest and likely others in matrix2.py and sage.geometry.cone. At some point I started adding the `# long time` on each line, but those are older. I'm happy to fix them.

Currently doctest annotations belong on the first line
of each doctest.

It's not standard, but it is actually pretty common, since the correct place to put the tag is undocumented and placing it at the end doesn't work. I mention it in the commit message,

I think we should standardize on the tag being at the end of the logical line (as all of the examples in the developer's guide show) rather than in the middle of the logical line, which makes no sense at all to me. If we ever do try to make that change, having every line decorated will make the job easier; and it doesn't hurt anything otherwise.

There's a total of 190 such lines in the entire codebase, per `$ git grep -E '[.][.][.][.]:.*#.*(long|optional)'  | wc -l`

This is markup based on guesswork, let's just fix it to match what actually works (first line marked).

I'm strongly -1 on changing the standard. In particular, I have been adding thousands of `# optional` tags in modularization tickets and I would hate to have to change multiline tests for this.

Let's just document what is correct and fix the 190 outliers. Easy to do with one `git grep -l ... | xargs sed ...`.

As you know, line breaks are significant in Python. The markup is not "in the middle of a logical line"; it is on the first line of the block.

I'm not talking about blocks. I'm talking about how

```
(a + b) # long time
```

is correct, but

```
(a +
 b) # long time 
```

silently does the wrong thing because sage wants

```
(a + # long time 
 b)
```

The latter is bordering on the absurd to me.

The above examples make immediate sense if you don't omit the prompts.

```
sage: (a + b) # long time
```

is correct, but

```
sage: (a +
....:  b) # long time     # WRONG
```
silently does the wrong thing because sage wants

```
sage: (a + # long time 
....: b)
```
by the very simple rule "magic comments go on the first physical line".
(which has always been in force and is now documented.)

We've wound up with way more work than is necessary here. I think most people would agree that

```
(a +

is where that tag should be, but that also

```
while x < y: # long time

has the tag the best place. We could just merge my one simple commit here, and then update the parser in #17404 to support both placements (or anywhere in the logical line).

The doctest format is designed this way, it has been documented in `sage.doctest.parsing.parse_optional_tags`, and has been like this since at least 2012.
