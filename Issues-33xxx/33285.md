```
C = CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ, [1,2], category=AlgebrasWithBasis(ZZ))

As pointed out on sage-devel, [https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/lF2Ot3rgYi0](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/lF2Ot3rgYi0)
"The infinite loop comes from C.one() calling C(1)
calling C.one()... When you specify a category
the inheritance is different and this explains
the difference of behaviour."

Which method are you talking about ? What is wrong about it ?

> In fact, there is fundamentally no way to do this at the category level. It is up to the individual classes to handle creating their zero element as they are the only ones who know how to do it.

Sure and `CombinatorialFreeModule` knows how to do it via `C.zero()`. The branch just bypasses the multiplication `(zero in base ring) x (one in the algebra)`. I do not understand what is wrong about it.

> This is an example of creating a partially defined object, so you should expect some bad behavior.

Agreed. But you could also expect the object `C` to be partially working. In that particular example, we could hope for its module structure to survive. Especially calling `C(0)`.

> In particular, for it to be an algebra, it needs to have an identity, and hence a canonical embedding of the base ring. In short, this *should* fail because it does not know what the identity is.

The canonical embedding of zero does not need the unit, hence my fix.

> I propose we close this ticket.

Sure but with a won't fix or my branch :) ?

There is only one method you modify in your branch `from_base_ring()`. However, I misread the code and thought it just returned `0` whenever it couldn't do the computation.

> > In fact, there is fundamentally no way to do this at the category level. It is up to the individual classes to handle creating their zero element as they are the only ones who know how to do it.

Right. it only works because `CFM` has defined `zero()` through a specific implementation. There is a generic implementation that calls `self(0)`, which will run into the same problem now with a different infinite loop.

I think it is bad form to make something work because someone is working with malformed input. This is in the category of algebras, so it should rightfully assume that it has `1` specified.

As I mentioned above, generically speaking, yes it does.

won't fix.

This could be useful as an optimization as the only (generally) expensive `== 0` test is for `SR`. However, I think this runs into an infinite loop for an algebra that only defines `1` and uses the default implementation of `0`. So the generic `AdditiveMagmas.zero()` method would need some modification to avoid coercion. If we did go this route, then the doctest needs to be changed.

Is it? In a complicated quotient ring `Zmod(2^16)[x, y, z] / I` or `Multizetas()` couldn't it be costly as well?

> However, I think this runs into an infinite loop for an algebra that only defines `1` and uses the default implementation of `0`. So the generic `AdditiveMagmas.zero()` method would need some modification to avoid coercion. If we did go this route, then the doctest needs to be changed.

Indeed, an algebra could also assume that it does not need `zero()` to be implemented since it can be recovered with `(zero in the base ring) x (one in the algebra)`.

This last comment make me think that even though it looked innocent, my branch might create some other problem. `wontfix` looks like a reasonable option.

Fair enough. For the quotient, I think it always reduces elements, so checking 0 is quick. I might be mistaken there. However, I agree for `Multizetas()` or maybe in the group algebra of a (confluent) finitely presented group.

While I don't think we have any cases of this (since most roads for algebras lead through `CFM`), it might break something in the wild.

Thank you (both) for looking at this.
