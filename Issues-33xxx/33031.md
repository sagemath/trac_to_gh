Discovered in #33023, the implementation of `is_hermitian()` for sparse double matrices is the generic one that tests equality of entries, and can fail due to numerical imprecision.

We already have an `is_hermitian()` for DENSE double matrices, but it is not used for the sparse class, which is its sibling and not a child. A quick way to fix this is to implement the "naive" version from the sense class in the sparse class. But a better solution might be to move the "naive" algorithm for dense matrices up into the superclass, and just allow the generic method to take a tolerance. If that's stable, it would allow us to avoid reimplementing `is_hermitian()` three times.

When this has been fixed, the `# known bug` tags need to be removed from the following tests in `src/sage/matrix/matrix_double_sparse.pyx`:

```
sage: L = A.cholesky()                    # known bug, 33031        
sage: (A - L*L.T).norm(1) < 1e-10         # known bug, 33031        
True                                                                
sage: B = A.change_ring(RR)               # known bug, 33031        
sage: (B.cholesky() - L).norm(1) < 1e-10  # known bug, 33031
```

```
sage: L = A.cholesky()                    # known bug, 33031        
sage: (A - L*L.H).norm(1) < 1e-10         # known bug, 33031        
True                                                                
sage: B = A.change_ring(CC)               # known bug, 33031        
sage: (B.cholesky() - L).norm(1) < 1e-10  # known bug, 33031
```

Depends on #33023

`is_hermitian()` already fails on `RBF` and `RIF` matrices for want of a `conjugate()` method...

This does not seem to be due to the tolerance, though, because `(B - B.H).norm(1)` is `1.5474000715052094e-16`.

Argh, of course, you're now hitting the same problem over `RR` and `CC`, which we use to check the answer. Thankfully those aren't crucial to the process. I just pushed another commit that checks the answer against the dense RDF/CDF factorization instead, which will use a different but supposedly stable `is_hermitian()`, but the same `cholesky()` that we had with RR/CC.

I think it's kind of nice to see the symmetry/contrast between uses of the internal function in the user-facing ones. i.e.:\n\n```python\n# in the superclass\ndef is_hermitian(self):\n    return self._is_hermitian(skew=False, tolerance=0)\ndef is_skew_hermitian(self):\n    return self._is_hermitian(skew=True, tolerance=0)\n# in the subclass\ndef is_hermitian(self, tolerance=1e-12):\n    return self._is_hermitian(skew=False, tolerance=tolerance)\ndef is_skew_hermitian(self, tolerance=1e-12):\n    return self._is_hermitian(skew=True, tolerance=tolerance)\n```\n\nThe user-facing method always knows the value of the `skew` parameter, so there's never any real need to \"default\" it. Doing so would only save a total of five characters. The tolerance parameter is similar... a default of zero would work now, but would be superfluous when we finish making the tolerance (in the superclass) user-facing in #33053.",

This is mainly a style choice since it's an internal function and users won't be annoyed by the extra parameter. I think it's kind of nice to see the symmetry/contrast between uses of the internal function in the user-facing ones. i.e.:

```python
# in the superclass
def is_hermitian(self):
    return self._is_hermitian(skew=False, tolerance=0)
def is_skew_hermitian(self):
    return self._is_hermitian(skew=True, tolerance=0)
# in the subclass
def is_hermitian(self, tolerance=1e-12):
    return self._is_hermitian(skew=False, tolerance=tolerance)
def is_skew_hermitian(self, tolerance=1e-12):
    return self._is_hermitian(skew=True, tolerance=tolerance)
```

The user-facing method always knows the value of the `skew` parameter, so there's never any real need to "default" it. Doing so would only save a total of five characters. The tolerance parameter is similar... a default of zero would work now, but would be superfluous when we finish making the tolerance (in the superclass) user-facing in #33053.
