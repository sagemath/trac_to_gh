sage: (QQ^2).submodule([[1,1]])
Vector space of degree 2 and dimension 1 over Rational Field
Basis matrix:
[1 1]
sage: _.category()
Category of finite dimensional vector spaces with basis over (number fields and quotient fields and metric spaces)
```

`Subobjects` is missing, so the standard methods `ambient`, `lift`, `retract` are missing. 

This is in contrast to `CombinatorialFreeModule`.


(There is a class-specific method `ambient_module` though.)

Also there is an apparent conflict of the element method `lift` with the one defined in `free_module_element.pyx`; not resolved here.
