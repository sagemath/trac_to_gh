PR https://github.com/sagemath/sage-patchbot/pull/155 adds a GH Actions workflow to sage-patchbot, which runs the patchbot in a Docker container using one of the pre-built images that our CI pushes to https://github.com/orgs/sagemath/packages?repo_name=sage



Follow-ups:
- https://github.com/sagemath/sage-patchbot/pull/156 (fixup)

- https://github.com/sagemath/sage-patchbot/pull/157 (Cygwin)

- Run as a scheduled workflow on GH Actions.  Users who fork the GitHub repo can activate the workflow by depositing a repository secret `SAGE_PATCHBOT_ENVS` of the form `ubuntu-focal-standard ubuntu-hirsute-standard ...`. The workflow would create 1 job per platform listed there

Is this really necessary? It's running one ci tool in another one. I would say its more flexible to convert the patchbot steps into github workflows, as we have already done with the linter and #33263. This should replace the patchbots completely in the long term.
