That package includes prompt-toolkit 2 because prompt-toolkit 3, which started using the asyncio module for its event loops, does not work correctly with Tk.  IPython 8 currently generates exceptions when used with prompt-toolkit 2.  It appears that the IPython developers do not intend to fix this.
