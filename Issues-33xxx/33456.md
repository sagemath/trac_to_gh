Originally added in #30404, then removed in #32491, now it's back: the pyright check via the github actions.

I've changed the pyright config so that some of the errors are demoted to warnings (all of the demoted errors occurred at least 100 times and thus are not fixable in a single ticket). This made it check now pass on the complete sage source code.

Also fixed a handful of errors that pyright reported:
- Missing closed bracket in smallgraphs by removing leading zeros in the numbers (might actually be a bug in pyright)
- Remove global declaration in `latex`, where pyright complained about global appearing before import. If I understand it correctly, then `global` is not needed here (because `sage_configurable_latex_macros` is not a global variable in the latex module)
- Remove duplicate import in `free_module`
