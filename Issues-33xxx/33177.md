With version 2.1.2 of cypari2, which comes with Sage 9.3-9.5, the following causes cypari2 to allocate memory at several GB per minute:

```
sage: while True:
....:     v = pari.vector(10, range(10))
```
Observed on both Linux and macOS with Intel processors.

Also filed at [https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/issues/112](https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/issues/112).
