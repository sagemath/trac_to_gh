```
sage: n = var("n")
sage: assume(n, "integer")
sage: assume(n, "odd")
sage: legendre_P(n, 0)  # this should be 0
legendre_P(n, 0)
```
The problem is that pynac does not know that `n` is odd, so the appropriate code branch in pynac's `legp_eval` function is not taken:

```
if (n.info(info_flags::odd))
        return _ex0;
```

This is a follow-up to #33963, which fixes a bug in the case where `n` is even. (The assumption `assume(n, "even")` does get passed to pynac.)

Keywords: **parity, pynac, assumptions**

Component: **symbolics**
