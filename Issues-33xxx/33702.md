Copy-paste oversight:

```diff
         - ``action`` (string; default ``"OnPoints"``) -- should the group be
           considered to act on points (``action="OnPoints"``) or on sets of
-          points (``action="OnSets"``) or on tuples of points (``action="OnSets"``).
+          points (``action="OnSets"``) or on tuples of points (``action="OnTuples"``).
```

Error messages should not end with period (and can be made shorter).

```diff
-            ValueError: 'action' must be equal to 'OnPoints', 'OnSets' or to 'OnTuples'.
+            ValueError: 'action' must be 'OnPoints', 'OnSets' or 'OnTuples'
```

```diff
-            raise ValueError("'action' must be equal to 'OnPoints', 'OnSets' or to 'OnTuples'.")
+            raise ValueError("'action' must be 'OnPoints', 'OnSets' "
+                             "or 'OnTuples'")
```

Consider wrapping long lines, and remove incorrect use of `:meth:`:

```
        - ``action`` (string; default ``"OnPoints"``) -- should the
          group be considered to act on points (``action="OnPoints"``)
          or on sets of points (``action="OnSets"``) or on tuples of
          points (``action="OnSets"``). In the latter two cases, the
          first argument must be a subset of ``domain``.

<a id='comment:7'></a>It might be worth updating the description of `point` too.

How about rephrasing the two items of the `INPUT` field as follows?

```diff
-        - ``point`` -- a point of the :meth:`domain`, or a set of points
-          depending on the value of ``action``.
+        - ``point`` -- either a point, a set of points, or a tuple
+          of points, consistently with the value of ``action``. The
+          point or points should be in the domain this group acts on
+          (see :meth:`domain`).
-
-        - ``action`` (string; default ``"OnPoints"``) -- should the
-          group be considered to act on points (``action="OnPoints"``)
-          or on sets of points (``action="OnSets"``) or on tuples of
-          points (``action="OnTuples"``). In the two latter cases, the
-          first argument must be a subset of ``domain``.
+        - ``action`` (string; default: ``"OnPoints"``) -- whether to
+          return the stabilizer of a point (``action="OnPoints"``),
+          of a set of points (``action="OnSets"``), or of a tuple
+          of points (``action="OnTuples"``). This should be consistent
+          with the value of ``point``.
```
