For some reason on a Symmetric Group object, there's a method `permutahedron`, but when calling it, it fails since no fundamental weights are defined. 

```

sage: S.permutahedron()

For now, I'm not sure the best way to approach this, but wanted to catalog it to get back to it later.

The symmetric group in Sage is a permutation group, but 

```
S in CoxeterGroups.Finite()
```
gives `True`, correctly.  So this connection apparently hasn't been fully implemented.  See [here](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/categories/sage/categories/finite_coxeter_groups.html?highlight=permutahedron#sage.categories.finite_coxeter_groups.FiniteCoxeterGroups.ParentMethods.permutahedron) and [the current code for the weights](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/43474c96d533fd396fe29fe0782d44dc7f5164f7/src/sage/groups/matrix_gps/coxeter_group.py#L666).    See in particular [this comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/43474c96d533fd396fe29fe0782d44dc7f5164f7/src/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.py#L262), though I'm not sure if that class is the "correct" place to add it - you might want to ask people more conversant with that code, one of whom I've cc:ed.

Comment: Perhaps also connecting with [the polytope](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/discrete_geometry/sage/geometry/polyhedron/library.html#sage.geometry.polyhedron.library.Polytopes.permutahedron).
