Follow up on #30040:

If we are in a lattice, such that all intervals `[F, G]` are boolean, if `F` is not the lower bound, then any face except the lower bound, has a unique representation as meet of coatoms.

This means that we do not need to mark a face as visited, when removing it from the coatoms.

Before (benchmarks without parallelization):

```
sage: P = polytopes.cyclic_polytope(10, 22)
sage: %timeit C = CombinatorialPolyhedron(P); C.f_vector(1, 0)
43.2 ms ± 40 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
sage: P = polytopes.associahedron(['A', 8])
sage: %timeit C = CombinatorialPolyhedron(P); C.f_vector(1, 0)
20.1 ms ± 69.3 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(12, backend='field')
sage: %timeit C = CombinatorialPolyhedron(P); C.f_vector(1, 0)
38.6 ms ± 464 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
sage: P = polytopes.Birkhoff_polytope(5)  # neither simple nor simplicial
sage: %timeit C = CombinatorialPolyhedron(P); C.f_vector(1, 0)
275 ms ± 531 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```

After (benchmarks without parallelization):

```
sage: P = polytopes.cyclic_polytope(10, 22)
sage: %timeit C = CombinatorialPolyhedron(P); C.f_vector(1, 0)
38.6 ms ± 1.07 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
sage: P = polytopes.associahedron(['A', 8])
sage: %timeit C = CombinatorialPolyhedron(P); C.f_vector(1, 0)
18.3 ms ± 23.7 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(12, backend='field')
sage: %timeit C = CombinatorialPolyhedron(P); C.f_vector(1, 0)
30.9 ms ± 40 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
sage: P = polytopes.Birkhoff_polytope(5)  # neither simple nor simplicial
sage: %timeit C = CombinatorialPolyhedron(P); C.f_vector(1, 0)
274 ms ± 410 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```
