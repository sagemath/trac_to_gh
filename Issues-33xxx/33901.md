```
The script sage-bootstrap-python attempts to call a command like
"/path/to/python" -c "..."
Pyenv python treats "python" differently from just python, giving the output:
/home/.../.pyenv/shims/python: line 1: 2: command not found

With pyenv installed and configured normally, the script will never check a non-pyenv version of python, and thus will fail to find a suitable python. My fix was to attempt to remove pyenv from the PATH before testing for python.

I've only confirmed this behavior on arch linux
