One of the dominant steps in creating a general p-adic extension is finding the (approximate) nth root of a polynomial over a number field, given a valuation `v`.  Ie, given a polynomial `f(x)`, an integer `n` and a precision `k`, find a polynomial `g(x)` with `v(f(x) - g(x)^n) >= k`.  There's also a version of this on the approximate side (ie with coefficients in a p-adic field).
