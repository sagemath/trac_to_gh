As a general fact, it is delicate or impossible to maintain consistently the `_pos`, `_pos3d` or `_embedding` attributes of graphs under modifications (eg vertex/edge addition/deletion). In order to keep modifications as fast as possible, we simplify the handling of these attributes by just adding a consistency check in `get_pos` and `get_embedding` (that could modify the attributes when necessary). We also remove the updating that were previously done in vertex/edge deletions.

May be we could add some kind of hash  of the graph (or a copy of the list of vertices and edges) to the embedding and test in `_check_embedding_validity` if the hash has changed ?

One difficulty with adding an extra argument to a method like `add_edge` is that we must also add this argument to all methods calling it, for instance `add_path`,  `add_cycle`,  etc.

It would clearly be better if we could postpone the updates of the embedding to `get_embedding` and/or methods using embeddings.
Deleting the embedding is certainly the best choice after all.

One can not postpone operations such as `merge_vertices` since the graph has no memory of what happened. One postponing possibility is to do

```
def get_embedding():
    1. remove all vertices that disappear from self._embedding
    2. remove all edges that disappear from self._embedding
    3. check validity
       if correct: return it
       else: delete self._embedding and raise an error
```
If we do so, then we can ignore most of what is done in #33759.

On my machine, all tests pass in the `sage/graphs` folder with optional `bliss, igraph, nauty, python_igraph`.

I find the version in the branch more consistent. However it is backward incompatible with the previous behavior (eg `get_pos` used to return invalid positions). Also it might make sense to have a partial positionning or embedding that we want to impose when calling `plot` or `genus`. What do you think?

- in `get_embedding`, the description of the method must be clarified. Indeed, the method tries to clean the embedding.

- in `_circle_embedding`, you must initialize pos to None before the try.

- don't forget to align comments on 80 columns mode

- In the doctest

```diff
+            sage: G.get_pos()
+            {1: (-0.9510565163, 0.3090169944),
+            ...
+             9: (0.47552825815, 0.1545084972)}
```
 You should write `(-0.9510..., 0.3090...)` to prevent from numerical instability on other computers.

If we go this route, than rather then modifying `self._pos`/`self._pos3d`/`self._embedding` I would rather return a modified dictionary but not touch the attributes. So that, even if partial, they could be used by `plot()` or `genus()`.

LGTM. I don't have doctests errors anymore.
