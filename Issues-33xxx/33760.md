As a general fact, it is delicate or impossible to maintain consistently the `_pos`, `_pos3d` or `_embedding` attributes of graphs under modifications (eg vertex/edge addition/deletion). In order to keep modifications as fast as possible, we simplify the handling of these attributes by just adding a consistency check in `get_pos` and `get_embedding` (that could modify the attributes when necessary). We also remove the updating that were previously done in vertex/edge deletions.

<a id='comment:12'></a>One difficulty with adding an extra argument to a method like `add_edge` is that we must also add this argument to all methods calling it, for instance `add_path`,  `add_cycle`,  etc.

It would clearly be better if we could postpone the updates of the embedding to `get_embedding` and/or methods using embeddings.
Deleting the embedding is certainly the best choice after all.

<a id='comment:19'></a>in `_check_embedding_validity`, you may set `self._pos` or `self._pos3d` to `None` and then return `pos` which might be different.

This might be a cause of the doctest errors, in particular doctests with `# optional - python_igraph`, but not only. For instance

<a id='comment:25'></a>- in `get_embedding`, the description of the method must be clarified. Indeed, the method tries to clean the embedding.

- in `_circle_embedding`, you must initialize pos to None before the try.

- don't forget to align comments on 80 columns mode

- In the doctest

```diff
+            sage: G.get_pos()
+            {1: (-0.9510565163, 0.3090169944),
+            ...
+             9: (0.47552825815, 0.1545084972)}
```
 You should write `(-0.9510..., 0.3090...)` to prevent from numerical instability on other computers.
