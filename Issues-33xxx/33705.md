Followup to #29310, #33104

We could consider to extend `make doc-clean` so that it also removes `inventory`, `doctrees`.
This should suffice to resolve incremental docbuild problems.

For normal Sage packages, `make PKG-clean` really uninstalls and should be renamed (with deprecation) to `make PKG-uninstall` (as discussed in #29097).

I'm not sure how to do this more cleanly without moving the `doc-clean` target into `build/make/Makefile.in`, in which case `./configure` probably gets run when you run `make doc-clean`. The problem is that no helpful environment variables are defined in the top-level `Makefile`.

Ready for review.

I don't think we need the change from[comment:1](#comment%3A1), but it does raise a question: if I run `make doc-html-no-plot`, I get an error:

```
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `doc-clean', needed by `doc-html-no-plot'.  Stop.
```
Do `make` targets (like `doc-clean`) from the top-level `Makefile` need to reproduced in `build/make/Makefile.in` if we want to refer to them?
