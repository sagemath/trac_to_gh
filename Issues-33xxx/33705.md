CC:  @jhpalmieri @kwankyu

Followup to #29310, #33104

We could consider to extend `make doc-clean` so that it also removes `inventory`, `doctrees`.
This should suffice to resolve incremental docbuild problems.

I don't think we need the change from comment:1, but it does raise a question: if I run `make doc-html-no-plot`, I get an error:

```
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `doc-clean', needed by `doc-html-no-plot'.  Stop.

Do `make` targets (like `doc-clean`) from the top-level `Makefile` need to reproduced in `build/make/Makefile.in` if we want to refer to them?
