The aim of this ticket is to:
* add CI that runs on each ticket (using github actions)
* use self-hosted runner that is fast enough to build all tickets from scratch
* prevents tickets from being merged unless it succeeds
* add status badge to trac

The code from trac ticket will be pushed by an external script to a branch ticket/12345, and this will trigger the CI run.

Example runs: https://github.com/vbraun/sage/actions/workflows/ticket.yaml

There are necessarily going to be some differences with a self-hosted runner, like
* No docker
* Use local fs cache (ccache and /upstream)
but what can be shared should, of course.

https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror already has all trac branches. Do you have a script already that would push branches that merge the trac branch into the current beta?
