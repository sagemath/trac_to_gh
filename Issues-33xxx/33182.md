The following throws a `TypeError`:

```
sage: z=var("z")
sage: g=z + 2/z + 3
sage: g.roots(z,ring=ComplexField (prec=10), multiplicities=False)
TypeError: fraction must have unit denominator
```
Meanwhile, this works:

```
sage: g=z^2 + 2 + 3*z
sage: g.roots(z,ring=ComplexField (prec=10), multiplicities=False)
[-2.0, -1.0]
```

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

This is user error. Specifying a ring tells the method to convert the expression to a polynomial over that ring:

```
INPUT: ...

   * "ring" - a ring (default None): if not None, convert self to a
     polynomial over ring and find roots over ring
```
That is impossible in this case, so an exception is raised.  

Should we improve the error message, or just close this ticket as invalid?  (Or does the method need enhancement?)

PS The method works as expected if no ring is specified:

```
sage: z = var("z")
sage: g = z + 2/z + 3
sage: g.roots(z, multiplicities=False)
[-2, -1]
```
