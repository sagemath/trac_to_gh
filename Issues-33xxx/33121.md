PARI/GP implements discrete logarithm on elliptic curves

```
sage: F = GF(3^6,'a')
sage: a = F.gen()
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,1,1,a,a])
sage: A = E.abelian_group()
sage: P = A.gen(0).element()
sage: from sage.libs.pari import pari
sage: pari.elllog(E, 400*P, P)
400
```
This should be benchmarked against the native sage implementation `P.discrete_log(400*P)`. If relevant, PARI/GP should be an alternative in the function `discrete_log`.

This might apply to other functions as well, see [PARI/GP elliptic curve reference card](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/manuals/2.13.3/refcard-ell.pdf).

Alright, here's a branch. Its primary goal was to call `elllog` in `.discrete_log()`, but there's a little complication: PARI doesn't actually guarantee that `elllog` terminates when `Q` is not a multiple of `P`.
Hence, I added a Weil pairing check to ensure this before calling into PARI, and changed `.weil_pairing()` to use PARI as well. (The old implementation remains accessible via an optional `algorithm=` argument.)

Benchmarks with pairings in fields up to 128 bits and ECDLPs up to 40 bits indicate that the new code is about 15 times faster on average for those sizes (in both cases). The biggest speedups observed in my tests were about 25× for pairings and about 100× for ECDLPs. Minor slowdowns were only observed for really tiny instances, presumably due to the added conversions between PARI and Sage. We could add a case distinction there, but frankly, I think it doesn't matter.

Example:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(986328349423), [49984317488,114040674816])
sage: P = E.random_point(); Q = 123451234512345*P
sage: %timeit P.discrete_log(Q)
```
9.5.rc0:

```
53.9 s ± 1.26 s per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```
This branch:

```
2.14 s ± 8.5 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```

While benchmarking, I also noticed that scalar multiplications in Sage are significantly (5×?) slower than PARI's `ellmul`, but changing that is a little more intricate, hence left for future work. I also refrained from touching `.tate_pairing()` for now.

In the `znlog()` documentation, near the bottom, it says:

    In addition, Pollard rho is not able to handle the case where there are no solutions: it will enter an infinite loop.

However, the documentation also says that rho is only used for "large" sizes, so it seems like we could skip the check for the smaller instances if it's a problem. Overall, the cost of the pairing is negligible anyway (Miller's algorithm is `O(log(n))` base field operations, ECDLP is worst-case `O(sqrt(n))`).

You are right that "`Q in ℚ·P`" can be an issue, but in this case it isn't.

Modulo a bunch of identifications, the Weil pairing is "just" the determinant pairing: Our points live in a group isomorphic to `G = (ℤ/n × ℤ/n, +)`, and the pairing is given by
  `G × G → k; ((a,b),(c,d)) ↦ z^(ad-bc)`
where `z` is a fixed primitive `n`th root of unity in the base field `k` of the curve.

Thus, the pairing is `1` if and only if `ad-bc ≡ 0 (mod n)`. The input vector `(a,b) ∈ ℤ/n × ℤ/n` corresponding to the point `P ∈ E` has full order `n` by construction (this is exactly how `n` was chosen), hence `gcd(a,b,n) = 1`. By Bézout we can find `u,v ∈ ℤ` such that `au + bv ≡ 1 (mod n)`. Letting `λ = cu + dv` and using `ad ≡ bc`, we then get `λ·(a,b) ≡ (c,d)` as desired.

If we drop the assumption that one of the inputs has full order, we can indeed easily construct counterexamples: `n=6`, `(a,b)=(2,0)`, `(c,d)=(0,3)`.
