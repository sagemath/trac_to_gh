Currently, images for https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sagemath/sagemath are not built automatically anymore. The main issue seems to be that there are no dedicated runners registered there anymore.

There are likely other problems since the [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) Pipeline has not been running for ages now.
