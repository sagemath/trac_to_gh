At the moment, iterating over `ZZ^n` only ever produces vectors in `ℤ × {0}^(n-1)`:

```
sage: for i,v in enumerate(ZZ^5):
....:     print(v)
....:     if i > 10: break
....:
(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
(1, 0, 0, 0, 0)
(-1, 0, 0, 0, 0)
(2, 0, 0, 0, 0)
(-2, 0, 0, 0, 0)
(3, 0, 0, 0, 0)
(-3, 0, 0, 0, 0)
(4, 0, 0, 0, 0)
(-4, 0, 0, 0, 0)
(5, 0, 0, 0, 0)
(-5, 0, 0, 0, 0)
(6, 0, 0, 0, 0)
```

This patch makes Sage iterate over `ZZ^n` in a more natural order: Sorted primarily by `1`‑norm, secondarily by `∞`‑norm.

There are two motivations to prefer this behavior in particular:
1. It is mathematically more correct — `iter(ZZ^n)` now actually enumerates all of `ℤ^n` rather than just a subset.
2. It can be useful in some situations (such as in cryptography) when searching for a small error vector of some sort.

I agree that it would be good to have such an implementation at the category level. Although we did have a reason for not doing something like this IIRC. I forget if it was backward compatibility, breaking doctests, slowdowns, or something else.

For this ticket, can you also add a doctest that shows it works over other enumerated rings, such as `GF(2)[‘t’]`? It should work for any infinite enumerated ring.

Well... It doesn't:

```
sage: GF(2)['t'] in InfiniteEnumeratedSets()
False
```
Indeed, `iter(GF(2)['t'])` throws a `NotImplementedError`.

It looks like `ZZ` is the only ring that's registered as an `InfiniteEnumeratedSet`.

You get the same category result for changing the base ring to `ZZ`:

```
sage: ZZ['t'] in InfiniteEnumeratedSets()
False
```
which IMO is a bug. (You also get a `NotImplementedError` for `iter(ZZ['t'])`.)

However, there should still be other infinite enumerated rings that are not so nice.

Interestingly

```
sage: QQ in InfiniteEnumeratedSets()
False
```
but it iterates just fine. IMO also a bug. I also cannot iterate the braid groups, which I should be able to since they are finitely generated as a monoid. Group algebras over enumerated monoids should also work for this, but they don't as they fail through a strange (IMO) code path:

```
sage: G = groups.misc.CoxeterGroup(['A',2,1])
sage: G in InfiniteEnumeratedSets()
True
sage: A = G.algebra(GF(2))
sage: A in InfiniteEnumeratedSets()
False
sage: next(iter(A))

```

Nothing in this code seems to be specific to `ZZ`, just Sage doesn't have put enough objects into the correct category (with the corresponding implementations) to support it.

Perhaps for now we can just change the documentation to say this works for any infinite enumerated (commutative) ring?
