The following code illustrates the problem that two bipartite graph `B1` and `B2` (both canonically labeled) are claimed to be equal and have equal hashes, while they are NOT isomorphic, let alone equal, as labeled graphs. 

When labels are ignored, these graphs are isomorphic, and so the problem may be caused by equality testing / `hash()` function somehow ignoring edge labels.


```
B1 = BipartiteGraph( [(0, 11, 2), (0, 12, 1), (0, 14, 1), (0, 16, 1), (1, 10, 1), (1, 13, 1), (1, 14, 2), (1, 16, 1), (2, 10, 2), (2, 11, 1), (2, 15, 1), (2, 16, 1), (3, 10, 1), (3, 12, 1), (3, 16, 2), (3, 17, 1), (4, 11, 1), (4, 13, 1), (4, 15, 2), (4, 17, 1), (5, 9, 2), (5, 14, 1), (5, 15, 1), (5, 17, 1), (6, 9, 1), (6, 13, 2), (6, 16, 1), (6, 17, 1), (7, 9, 1), (7, 10, 1), (7, 11, 1), (7, 12, 2), (7, 14, 1), (8, 9, 1), (8, 12, 1), (8, 13, 1), (8, 15, 1), (8, 17, 2)], immutable=True )

B2 = BipartiteGraph( [(0, 11, 1), (0, 12, 1), (0, 14, 2), (0, 16, 1), (1, 10, 2), (1, 13, 1), (1, 14, 1), (1, 16, 1), (2, 10, 1), (2, 11, 2), (2, 15, 1), (2, 16, 1), (3, 10, 1), (3, 12, 1), (3, 16, 2), (3, 17, 1), (4, 11, 1), (4, 13, 1), (4, 15, 2), (4, 17, 1), (5, 9, 2), (5, 14, 1), (5, 15, 1), (5, 17, 1), (6, 9, 1), (6, 13, 2), (6, 16, 1), (6, 17, 1), (7, 9, 1), (7, 10, 1), (7, 11, 1), (7, 12, 2), (7, 14, 1), (8, 9, 1), (8, 12, 1), (8, 13, 1), (8, 15, 1), (8, 17, 2)], immutable=True )

print('Same hashes:', hash(B1) == hash(B2) )
print('Isomorphic:', B1.is_isomorphic( B2, edge_labels=True ) )
print('Equal:', B1 == B2)
```

The docstring for `Graph.__eq__` says: "... labels of arrows/edges are taken into account if **and only if** the graphs are considered weighted ...".  This means that if you want equality testing to consider the edge labels (i.e., if you want the graphs to be considered as labelled graphs), then you need to make the graphs weighted.

```
sage: B1 = BipartiteGraph( [(0, 11, 2), (0, 12, 1), (0, 14, 1), (0, 16, 1), (1, 10, 1), (1, 13, 1), (1, 14, 2), (1, 16, 1), (2, 10, 2), (2, 11, 1), (2, 15, 1), (2, 16, 1), (3, 10, 1), (3, 12, 1), (3, 16, 2), (3, 17, 1), (4, 11, 1), (4, 13, 1), (4, 15, 2), (4, 17, 1), (5, 9, 2), (5, 14, 1), (5, 15, 1), (5, 17, 1), (6, 9, 1), (6, 13, 2), (6, 16, 1), (6, 17, 1), (7, 9, 1), (7, 10, 1), (7, 11, 1), (7, 12, 2), (7, 14, 1), (8, 9, 1), (8, 12, 1), (8, 13, 1), (8, 15, 1), (8, 17, 2)], immutable=True, weighted=True )

sage: B2 = BipartiteGraph( [(0, 11, 1), (0, 12, 1), (0, 14, 2), (0, 16, 1), (1, 10, 2), (1, 13, 1), (1, 14, 1), (1, 16, 1), (2, 10, 1), (2, 11, 2), (2, 15, 1), (2, 16, 1), (3, 10, 1), (3, 12, 1), (3, 16, 2), (3, 17, 1), (4, 11, 1), (4, 13, 1), (4, 15, 2), (4, 17, 1), (5, 9, 2), (5, 14, 1), (5, 15, 1), (5, 17, 1), (6, 9, 1), (6, 13, 2), (6, 16, 1), (6, 17, 1), (7, 9, 1), (7, 10, 1), (7, 11, 1), (7, 12, 2), (7, 14, 1), (8, 9, 1), (8, 12, 1), (8, 13, 1), (8, 15, 1), (8, 17, 2)], immutable=True, weighted=True )

sage: print('Same hashes:', hash(B1) == hash(B2) )
sage: print('Isomorphic:', B1.is_isomorphic( B2, edge_labels=True ) )
sage: print('Equal:', B1 == B2)

Same hashes: False
Isomorphic: False
Equal: False
```
So this is not a bug in the method, but I can see that this could be unexpected behavior.  

Perhaps a warning should be given when edge labels are put on an unweighted graph, or perhaps the documentation should be clarified.

The manipulation of edge labels is not simple since labels might not be hashable. For instance, a label can be a `Graph` or a dictionary.
In general, I prefer when the decision to consider labels is explicit (an argument set to `True` or `False`). 
Do you have any proposal to improve the documentation ?

A related issue is the name of this option. What is called `weighted=` in `BipartiteGraph()` in many other methods (like `.is_isomorphic()`, `.canonical_label()`, `.automorphism_group()` etc.) is called `edge_labels=`.

Documentation says:

    weighted – boolean (default: None); whether graph thinks of itself as weighted or not. See self.weighted()

So, the default value is not `True` or `False`, but `None`. I'd suggest that when `weighted=None` (ie., not specified), it should guessed from the input data. That is, if labels are present in the given data, `BipartiteGraph()` should assume `weighted=True`, otherwise it's `weighted=False`.

There was never a unanimous consensus on how to handle the weight/labelling logic, so I've implemented a suggestion.

My implementation adds an optional boolean parameter hash_labels to the class constructor, which if left empty will default to None and warn the user upon hash() invocation, and then include labels in the hash.

Let me know what you guys think.

(I'm new to the project so please feel free to give criticism, I'm assuming I've somehow misused trac).

Welcome to Sagemath.

To be consistent, you should add parameter `hash_labels` to all (bipartite) (di)graph classes and make sure the parameter is copied when making a copy of the graph.

I disagree with the default `None` value. We usually don't print warnings.
I think it should default to `False` (current behavior) and be set to `True` if either it's the input value or if the graph is weighted.

For the `__hash__` method, please check `Graph.__hash__??`. It's better to use frozenset to avoid sorting. So simply use `left = frozenset(self.left)`.

Finally, please try to use the same coding style as other methods.

Please avoid modifying parts of the code that have nothing to do with the objective of this ticket. It makes the reviewing process very difficult. To improve the coding style of a file, we prefer to open dedicated tickets and to not do it blindly.


Similarly to the `Graph__hash__` method, the `__hash__` method should be something like this (examples and tests are missing).

```
def __hash__(self):
    r"""
    Compute a hash for ``self``, if ``self`` is immutable.

    """
    if self.is_immutable():
        edge_items = self.edge_iterator(labels=self._weighted or self.hash_labels)
        if self.allows_multiple_edges():
            from collections import Counter
            edge_items = Counter(edge_items).items()
        return hash((frozenset(self.left),
                     frozenset(self.right),
                     frozenset(edge_items))
    raise TypeError("This graph is mutable, and thus not hashable. "
                    "Create an immutable copy by `g.copy(immutable=True)`")
```

Now, if we add this parameter to `BipartiteGraph`, it might be better to add it to `Graph`, `DiGraph`, etc. as well. Also, you must ensure that the parameter is copied if you do a copy.

I've had a play around with your suggestion, but there is some slightly weird behaviour.

I'm not exactly sure what's going on, but for some reason, hashing a tuple containing an edge_iterator() object gives unreliable results:


```
sage: B1 = BipartiteGraph([(1,2,3)], immutable=True)
sage: hash((B1.edge_iterator(labels=False),))
-4081111260156298028
sage: hash((B1.edge_iterator(labels=False),)) # same line as above
6054870339558346632
```

For now, I'm going to keep using my initial list/tuple_depth implementation since it seems to produce more reliable results

> Now, if we add this parameter to `BipartiteGraph`, it might be better to add it to `Graph`, `DiGraph`, etc. as well. 

Apologies for repeatedly asking for clarification, but are you saying I should add a hash_labels argument to the constructors of every graph class, [and/or _use_hash_labels() logic]?

> Also, you must ensure that the parameter is copied if you do a copy.

How should I go about making sure the parameter is copied?

Have your tried the method I proposed to hash a `BipartiteGraph` ? it is very similar to the hash function for `Graph`. It makes a frozenset of the list of edges which prevents ordering issues.

Concerning copy, you must ensure in method copy of `src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py` that attribute `hash_labels` is copied (if it exists).

If you want to generalize the idea to `Graph`, `DiGraph`, `GenericGraph`, the parameter should be set in the constructor of each of these classes and that the hash method of  `src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py` should be updated accordingly.

> If you want to generalize the idea to `Graph`, `DiGraph`, `GenericGraph`, the parameter should be set in the constructor of each of these classes and that the hash method of  `src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py` should be updated accordingly.

Done, passing all tests.

for anyone interested, here is the text he's referring to:

''This is an ugly hack but it works.

and (hash_labels is None or (hash_labels==self._use_labels_for_hash()))

I did several corrections / improvements. It currently passes tests, but I may have missed some cases.

I'll check the copy method asap. It's not obvious how to endup with a clean solution.

This should do the job.

Roughly, if parameter `hash_labels` is `None`, we have the same behavior than for the `weighted` parameters. If the parameter is set, we create a (im)mutable copy of the graph depending on the value of parameter `immutable`.

In another ticket, we can change the default behavior of returning self when asking for a copy of an immutable graph without changing parameters.
