Isn't it strange that the first few pages of this site are devoted to Hecke algebras? Even I got confused; newbies will probably be even more confused. I'm not sure if sphinx has a feature for providing an ordering of classes in a doc; if not, maybe we should warn the reader about it at the top of the page, or create a table of contents.
