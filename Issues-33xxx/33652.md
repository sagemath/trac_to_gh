```
For matrices over `ComplexBallField`, one can get
right eigenvectors but asking for left eigenvectors
triggers a not-implemented error.

```
sage: M = random_matrix(CBF, 2, 2)
sage: right = M.eigenvectors_right()
sage: left = M.eigenvectors_left()
NotImplementedError: eigenspaces cannot be computed reliably for inexact rings such as Complex ball field with 256 bits of precision,
consult numerical or symbolic matrix classes for other options
```

Here we make `eigenvectors_left` return
the right eigenvectors of the transpose.
