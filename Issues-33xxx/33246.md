`.canonical_label` on bipartite graph returns a graph with incorrect partite sets. The following code illustrates an example, where the resulting graph `C` has vertices `1` and `9` in the same left partite set and also an edge between them. 

The graph `C` itself seems to be correct, but partition of its vertices into `C.left` and `C.right` is not (they should be `{0,1,2,3,4}` and `{5,6,7,8,9}`).

```
B = BipartiteGraph( [(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9)] )
C = B.canonical_label(partition=(B.left,B.right))
print( (1 in C.left) and (9 in C.left) and C.has_edge(1,9) )
```

As a workaround for *connected* graphs, we can recompute the partite sets from just edges of `canonical_label()` - like:

```
C = BipartiteGraph( B.canonical_label(partition=(B.left,B.right)).edges() )
```

If `B` is not connected, recomputing the partite sets may shuffle them from different connected components inconsistently with the partite set in `B`.

Thanks for the proposal. I have some comments/questions:
- what's the main difference between this method and `GenericGraph.canonical_label` ? I'm asking beacause you have copy/paste multiple parts of the code, and so it's not obvious to see what makes the difference, why it is working correctly this way
- when you call a function with several optional parameters, it's better to name them: `partition=partition`, `certificate=certificate`, etc. This way you avoid errors if a new parameter is added.
- Bipartite graphs are undirected and without loops. So you don't need to check if it is directed or if it has loops
- the import of `DiGraph` is useful only if you use the fact that you can direct all arc from `left` to `right` to indicate a partition. Otherwise, you can remove it, no ?
- `{ cert[v] for v in self.left }` -> `{cert[v] for v in self.left}`

<div id="comment:11" align="right">Comment 11</div>

you need to
- remove `dig = (self._directed or self.has_loops())`
- use `dig=False` 
- replace `self_directed` with `False`

Also, in the example, write like this (not mandatory but nicer):

```diff
-            sage: B = BipartiteGraph( [(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8
-            ....: ), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9),
-            ....:  (7, 9)] )
+            sage: B = BipartiteGraph([(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 5),
+            ....:                     (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8),
+            ....:                     (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9),
+            ....:                     (6, 9), (7, 9)])
```

Lats, add (small) examples with `certificate=True`, `edge_labels=True` and a bipartite with multiple edges. This is to ensure that the method is working well.

- remove

```diff

```
- Why do you need `G_directed` in `HB.add_edge(G_to[u], G_to[v], None, G._directed)` ?
- When `certificate=True`, you must also return the certificate. Currently it's only the graph. Add a docket.

 I'm not sure where the problem comes from. 


- Concerning the call

```
            C = GenericGraph.canonical_label(self, partition, certificate, edge_labels, algorithm, return_graph)
```
 May be I'm missing something, but isn't it better to simply do:

```
            C = self.relabel(perm=cert, inplace=False)
```
 This way you avoid repeating computations you have already done.
