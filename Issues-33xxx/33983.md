In between this ticket and my previous one about the `build` target that was also related to `autogen`, it occured to me that the whole `autogen` should probably moved somewhere else in the near future.

I should expand, with modularization `sage_setup` is providing some build tools for other sage modules and possibly downstream package. `autogen` is only used by one of these modules at most and should therefore live with it. It is not at the present a common infrastructure used by many modules. May be you already have a ticket about this that I am unaware off?
