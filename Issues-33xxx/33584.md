Since this upgrade of SymPy (especially by [this commit](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/commit/72420537f320d333b5302040adfe94f0c335af93)) the Mathics interface is broken:

```sage
sage: slist = [[1, 2], 3., 4 + I]
sage: mlist = mathics(slist)
sage: mlist.sage()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: conversion to SageMath is not implemented
```

Here we implement a fix of that.


**Keywords:** Mathics inteface SymPy

I agree that my patch is a dirty hack :)

I agree that proper work with SympyExpression should be on on a separate ticket.

I agree that this ticket should be merged ASAP.
