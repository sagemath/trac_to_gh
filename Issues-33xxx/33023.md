This works on amd64 (with cvxopt installed):

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=138452687149883420730489596915102319785 src/sage/matrix/matrix_double_sparse.pyx
    [28 tests, 0.33 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 0.5 seconds
    cpu time: 0.3 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 0.3 seconds
```

but of course I'm just now noticing that the `--disable-cvxopt` branch I was so careful to add doesn't work at all.

Can you use `set_random_seed()` within a sage session to reproduce the failing test manually? And then let us know what the matrix is? The problem may be somewhere else entirely.

Does anyone know in what sense `is_hermitian(algorithm="orthonormal")` is more stable than  `is_hermitian(algorithm="naive")` for double dense matrices?

I'm tempted to write one fast `is_hermitian()` in the superclass that works for all subclasses, but the name "naive" makes me think that maybe I'm being naive.

But what does it handle badly?  If `A` is hermitian, than `A - A.conjugate_transpose()` should be zero, and how un-zero it is depends on the magnitudes of its entries.

Here's the duct-tape fix. I opened #33031 for the real one.

An uneducated guess: There are multiple ways to use this norm, such as `(A - B).norm() < tol` and `(A - B).norm() / A.norm() < tol`. Maybe the latter is less naive?

The test checks equality of floating point numbers and so is fundamentally broken. The fact that it seems to work on amd64 is the miracle.

The superclass's `is_hermitian()` method is doing `self[i,j] == self[j,i].conjugate()`.

For posterity wrt the aarch64 situation: It seems like this is just GSL's normal behavior for complex numbers. For a while, GSL failed its own test suite on non-x86 archs (see https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gsl/2018-04/msg00000.html, https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gsl/2019-08/msg00006.html), and this was fixed by increasing the testsuite tolerance (if I understand correctly). In Sage, this leads to the following:

```
sage: n = 2
....: A = matrix.random(CDF, n, sparse=True)
....: I = matrix.identity(CDF, n, sparse=True)
....: B = A*A.conjugate_transpose() + I
sage: B.is_hermitian()
False
