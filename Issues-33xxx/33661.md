`jupyter-sphinx` creates some python files for internal use which are installed along with documentation. These files are included in the list of files to test when running `sage -t --installed`, and they are causing a failure already in 9.6.beta7:

That's one of those things, I am surprised it only becomes apparent now. I historically had that issue before the use of `jupyter_sphinx` in sage-on-gentoo. For some reason some python files are left over from all the plots. And I don't know how they are avoided in vanilla sage. So, I am just removing them before install.

https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/402

My net above is sufficiently wide that it probably caught all those `jupyter_sphinx` files and I never noticed. I never quite got to the bottom of why I had those files in the first place, but they shouldn't be installed and neither should those.
