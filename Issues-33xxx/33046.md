In `gap/spkg-install` two absolute symlinks are created; this confuses packagers and relocation.

The current ticket replaces them by relative symlinks.

All the paths involved are hardcoded in this file (even `SAGE_BIN`), so nothing external can affect it.

<a id='comment:3'></a>this needs to be tested on macOS, which is notoriously fiddly with these things.
