We create a GH Actions workflow, run daily (intended for running on `sagetrac-mirror`) as a cron job (
https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule).

It can also be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`.

Example run at 
https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/5060070979

1. Merge mergeable Trac tickets from the current milestone, ordered by priority/deps, using `git releasemgr merge-all --milestone=current`

2. Run using tox/docker on a stable platform (`ubuntu-focal-recommended`). (The new package factor `recommended` is like `standard`, but with texlive etc. added, as needed for `doc-pdf`). We set `SAGE_DOCTEST_RANDOM_SEED=0` to reduce random failures.
Only testsuite failures that do not already fail in the baseline are considered failures. 

3. Docker images are pushed to `ghcr.io`, see https://github.com/mkoeppe?tab=packages&q=recommended

Refinements:
- Provide it with Trac credentials so it can set tickets back to `needs_work` on merge failures (using https://github.com/sagemath/git-trac-command/pull/57)

  --> Trac account requested

- Run `git log --first-parent` on files with merge conflict

- Provide it with [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) credentials so it can push a branch `$RELEASE_TAG+integration-$DATE`, if it passes build + doctests + doc-pdf.

- Perhaps `git bisect --first-parent` for passing; set first failing ticket back to `needs_work`

- Another workflow for integration testing of all tickets in the current milestone with `--patchbot-status=Spkg` and `--status=needs_review positive_review` with the full portability CI.

Volker, would you be willing to share your existing scripts that probably already implement something like step 2 above? It does not have to be pretty.

Uff that's quite complicated. Why do you first need to create a new baseline image for the integration tests and not reuse the docker image build during the latest push to the develop branch?

Instead of manually handling the docker pull (using cli commands) I would propose to use the `container` tag for the workflow (or job). Makes things easier and I assume github also takes care of the permission handling.

Also the `integration` job is currently timing out, and if I read the logs correctly then it is actually not merging the tickets for the new milestone (but tries to merge tickets for the already finished milestone 9.5): `No tickets for milestone sage-9.5 are ready to be merged`.

Finally a general remark: please use the new reusable actions instead of copy&pasting stuff around, like the "free space" or "login to ghcr" parts (which shouldn't be necessary in the final `integration` job because that's only reading, right?).

I need an image with more packages, which is not built by the CI. This is to run `make doc-pdf`, an essential step that currently no CI is testing.

I am deliberately setting this up as an image build, not just a container run, because I want to create a Docker image that can be pulled for local inspection.

I didn't meant you should refactor the existing workflows. But if you want to reuse some steps in the newly created workflow than they should be extracted to a new action (instead of copy&paste them). Refactoring the other workflows to use this new action can be done later.
(You wouldn't also let python code pass that copy&pastes some methods around, right?)

Can you expand on why this should be helpful, i.e. where are the advantages over just checking out the branch in your local git (and maybe running it in the baseline-integration docker image if you like). Also you can just execute the github workflow locally using `act` if you like.

Also, are you aware that there are special actions for the login and publish, which make the whole process way easier (and we don't need to maintain them)? https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-docker-images#publishing-images-to-github-packages

Yes, changing the existing CI to build the `-recommended` instead of `-standard` workflow may be something that we want to do at some point in the future. But this will need #33062 (split the workflow, with caching of Docker layers). That's exactly what the changes to tox.ini here on the ticket are implementing!

Yes, but they don't help much. The login action could replace these 5 lines:

```

            if [ -z "$TOKEN" ]; then

But the push happens before the final "Build & test integration head", so it neither contains the test results nor the build, or I'm missing something?

Even after sleep I don't understand your comment. The second if doesn't do anything in my opinion since the Github token is always there and we need to login to ghcr as you said earlier.
For the first if, this should be `password = ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PKG_GITHUB_TOKEN || secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` with the docker/login-action

Thinking about this again: would it be an idea to run the integration workflow as follows:
- use the docker image build during the ci for the develop branch
- merge all new tickets
- re-build sage, including the packages that are needed for `doc-pdf`
- run tests (using the ci artifact as baseline)
- build docs

Not sure how long the last step takes, but step 4 should finish in 30-60 mins (depending on how much packages are touched in the to-be-merged tickets) and step 5 about 1h. So this should all fit very nicely in one workflow. So the main advantage would be that you don't have to rebuild all packages from scratch during the integration workflow.

This is under the assumption that the packages needed for the pdf build of the documentation don't influence the tests, because otherwise the test-baseline could be wrong (but is probably still good enough).

Mainly to better understand the process behind the scenes, why is an additional "integration" branch necessary? Can one not simply push to "develop" (in case there are no errors)? I guess this comes down to the question "what does the release manager has to do in the background that demands a manual merge into the develop branch".
