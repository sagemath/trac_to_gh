`bitset_copy_flex` doesn't work at all, due to a sign error.

The following gives a segmentation fault:

```
sage: polytopes.hypercube(8).combinatorial_polyhedron().pyramid()
```

The problem is that we are trying to copy a bitset with 256 bits to a bitset with 257 bits. This bitset is guaranteed to have more limbs and the bug shows.

Depends on #32827
