I am running Debian bullseye with `polymake` (4.3) and `libpolymake-dev` installed from the distro. However, if i configure with `--enable-polymake` the package is built anyway. The `spkg-configure.m4` seems to require a version at least 3.5 though.

**Upstream:** Not yet reported upstream; Will do shortly.

Here are the logs, the build of polymake (that was unexpected) ended with no space left on device, but this is not the issue.

Polymake is installed, as you can see with:
