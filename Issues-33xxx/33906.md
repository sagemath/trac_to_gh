Example:

```sage
sage: pow(5,7,13).parent()
Ring of integers modulo 13
```

This contradicts the docstring ("Return `(left ^ right) % modulus`."), and it doesn't happen for other parents:

```sage
sage: R.<x> = GF(59)[]
sage: pow(x,123,x^5-x+1).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field of size 59
```

Thanks for fixing this. The documentation for `lift` just says "Lift an integer modulo `n` to the integers", but doesn't guarantee that the lift is the canonical one. However, looking at some of the code seems to show that the lift (i.e., the `ivalue`) is always in the correct range, so it seems to be ok. 

I do think the docstring of `lift` should be revised to clarify this (unless I missed something), but that's not for this ticket.
