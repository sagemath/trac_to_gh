Based on a suggestion by the author of the sphinx theme furo in https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo/pull/408#issuecomment-1084865096, we rework the inventory builder to derive from `DummyBuilder` instead of `HtmlBuilder`. The sphink link checker is implemented in a similar way: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/_modules/sphinx/builders/linkcheck.html. This simplifies the implementation, yields a bit of a speedup and fixes issues arising when the furo theme is used (first entry under "known issues" in #33601 results from furo treating the inventory builder as a normal html builder and injecting its custom logic).

As far as I can see, the only "feature" of the HTML builder we loose with this implementation is the `BuildInfo` serialization (which is used to invalidate the output if the config changes). But since the inventory builder doesn't contain any configurable bits, I don't think this is a big loss (but I might miss something here).

I've compared a few build inventory files with the ones build on `develop`, and they were identical.

It works well. A comment and a question:

1. What is this `assert self.env is not None` for? Why is this check necessary?

2. The indentation of the header doc needs to be adjusted.

This is mostly to satisfy the type checker that would complain otherwise that `self.env` could be None (which, in practice, it will not be).

In our case, the caller is fixed, and we should make it sure that the caller set `self.env` to a non `None`. 

Practically though, I agree that the `assert` would serve as a guard against a possible bug (perhaps in the future). Thanks for explanation.

Otherwise all looks good to me. Thank you.
