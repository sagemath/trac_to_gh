Based on a suggestion by the author of the sphinx theme furo in https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo/pull/408#issuecomment-1084865096, we rework the inventory builder to derive from `DummyBuilder` instead of `HtmlBuilder`. The sphink link checker is implemented in a similar way: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/_modules/sphinx/builders/linkcheck.html. This simplifies the implementation, yields a bit of a speedup and fixes issues arising when the furo theme is used (first entry under "known issues" in #33601 results from furo treating the inventory builder as a normal html builder and injecting its custom logic).

As far as I can see, the only "feature" of the HTML builder we loose with this implementation is the `BuildInfo` serialization (which is used to invalidate the output if the config changes). But since the inventory builder doesn't contain any configurable bits, I don't think this is a big loss (but I might miss something here).

I've compared a few build inventory files with the ones build on `develop`, and they were identical.

This is mostly to satisfy the type checker that would complain otherwise that `self.env` could be None (which, in practice, it will not be).

Then why do we need that? I guess it was added for debugging purpose. Then shouldn't it be deleted in the final code?

In our case, the caller is fixed, and we should make it sure that the caller set `self.env` to a non `None`. 

Practically though, I agree that the `assert` would serve as a guard against a possible bug (perhaps in the future). Thanks for explanation.

Otherwise all looks good to me. Thank you.
