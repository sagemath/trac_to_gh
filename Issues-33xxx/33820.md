This would be just like `lazy_import` but actually eager (= equivalent to an ordinary `import` statement). Hence it would be suitable everywhere, including for importing classes that will be subclassed (see #33384).

On import failures, it would however not raise an error but provide a binding to a `LazyImport` instance that reports the failure on first use (and can give package installation advice -> discoverability).

We would use this mechanism in `sage.all`.
