From Marc Culler:

`prompt_toolbox` with versions >= 3.0.0 completely breaks Tk graphics on macOS (Linux not affected).  Symptoms include very high CPU usage when doing essentially nothing as well as crashes.  The older `prompt_toolbox` 2.0.10 works fine.  The change from 2.0.10 to 3.0.0 was a major rewrite which replaced the custom event loops that they had written with `asyncio`.

The current version of `IPython` that ships with Sage is perfectly happy using `prompt_toolbox` 2.0.10.  We know of no downside to reverting to that version.  The upside is that Tk works normally, which is very important to SnapPy
