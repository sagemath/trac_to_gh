We implement an `EllipticCurveHom` child class `EllipticCurveHom_frobenius` encapsulating purely inseparable *Frobenius isogenies*. As every isogeny decomposes into a separable and a purely inseparable part, we can (together with `EllipticCurveHom_composite`) now express any isogeny between two elliptic curves in Sage.

One immediate application (also implemented in the patch) is that separable isogenies of degree divisible by the characteristic now have a working `.dual()` method. Other than that, changes to the existing codebase are kept minimal.

This is one of the items on the "isogeny wish-list" #7368. It is also an important step towards implementing endomorphism rings later; cf. comment:3:ticket:32826.

This is indeed a less well-known Pythonism: `else` after `for` means "if we did not `break` out of the loop". It can often be used in situations where you'd have to use a flag boolean ("`found`", "`done`") in other languages.

Done, for curves over finite fields. Good idea! (`.frobenius()` already exists, by the way, and returns a quadratic integer.)
