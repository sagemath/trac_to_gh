We implement an `EllipticCurveHom` child class `EllipticCurveHom_frobenius` encapsulating purely inseparable *Frobenius isogenies*. As every isogeny decomposes into a separable and a purely inseparable part, we can (together with `EllipticCurveHom_composite`) now express any isogeny between two elliptic curves in Sage.

One immediate application (also implemented in the patch) is that separable isogenies of degree divisible by the characteristic now have a working `.dual()` method. Other than that, changes to the existing codebase are kept minimal.

This is one of the items on the "isogeny wish-list" #7368. It is also an important step towards implementing endomorphism rings later; cf. comment:3:ticket:32826.

1. In `find_post_isomorphism()` the 'else' on the line after the break looks wrong, is this a syntax error?  Apologies if my python is inadequate.

2. (apologies) As in #32826 `scaling_factor()` returns an integer (0 or 1 here), and should more properly be coerced into the base field.

3. Good to have the method `frobenius_isogeny()` added to the generic elliptic curve class.  Should we also have a mthod `frobenius_endomorphism()` or just `frobenius()` as a special case too?

This is indeed a less well-known Pythonism: `else` after `for` means "if we did not `break` out of the loop". It can often be used in situations where you'd have to use a flag boolean ("`found`", "`done`") in other languages.

Done, for curves over finite fields. Good idea! (`.frobenius()` already exists, by the way, and returns a quadratic integer.)
