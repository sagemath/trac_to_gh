Python has `int.bit_length()`, but Sage has `Integer.nbits()`.

In this patch, we add `Integer.bit_length()` for compatibility with `int`.

Among other things, this change should make it easier to switch from Python to Sage mid-development, which currently requires replacing all calls to `.bit_length()` or adding casts to `int`.

This helps with
