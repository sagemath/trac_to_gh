CC:  @orlitzky

For some double dense matrices that are not positive definite, Sage incorrectly claims that they are:

    {{{
    sage: A = matrix(CDF, [This is the Trac macro *1+I* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1+I-macro))
    sage: A.is_positive_definite()  # should be False
    True
    sage: A.is_positive_semidefinite()  # correct
    False
    }}}

Clearly, `A` is not even Hermitian. The implementation relies on testing whether a Cholesky decomposition exists or not, but `.cholesky()` gives an incorrect result for this matrix

    {{{
    sage: A.cholesky()
    [1.0]
    }}}

while for most other matrices this would raise an error.

The [SciPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.cholesky.html) is not entirely clear about this, but it seems that SciPy assumes that the matrix is already Hermitian positive-definite and thus only considers half the matrix (see [SciPy issues 2116](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/2116#issuecomment-990487066) and [15012](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/15012)).

This ticket adds a check whether the matrix is Hermitian before computing the Cholesky decomposition, which resolves the problem. The default algorithm for `is_hermitian` is changed from "orthonormal" to "naive".

My first thought was that we should be able to delete `cholesky()` and `is_positive_definite()` in the subclass to obtain something possibly slower, but that actually works. There are two small problems though.

First, the generic `cholesky()` doesn't work on the trivial matrix, breaking one doctest (#33107). This is an easy fix.

Second, the subclass implementation of `is_hermitian()` used by the superclass's `is_cholesky()` doesn't work out-of-the box. For example,

```
sage: M = matrix(RDF,[[ 1,  1,    1,     1,     1],                 
....:                 [ 1,  5,   31,   121,   341],                 
....:                 [ 1, 31,  341,  1555,  4681],                 
....:                 [ 1,121, 1555,  7381, 22621],                 
....:                 [ 1,341, 4681, 22621, 69905]])
M.is_hermitian(algorithm='orthonormal') # the default
False
```

while

```
sage: M.is_hermitian(algorithm='orthonormal', tol=1e-10)
True
```

or

```
sage: M.is_hermitian(algorithm='naive')
True
```

We'd have to either tweak the default tolerance there, or again maybe just delete the subclass method. The "naive" algorithm now defers to a superclass implementation where the default tolerance works.

Rather than remove the subclass `is_hermitian()`, I've only switched its default to the "naive" algorithm. (But note that I don't think it's any more naive than "orthonormal"). Afterwards, eliminating `cholesky()` and `is_positive_definite()` from the subclass allows the superclass methods to return the correct result.

The superclass `cholesky()` and `is_*definite()` methods support both exact and inexact rings in a numerically stable way (caveat: `is_hermitian()` itself is not yet reliable, that's #33053) via `block_ldlt()`. For inexact rings, positive-definite and positive-semidefinite are indeed basically the same up to machine precision, but the tests use `> 0` and `>= 0`.

Unless you strongly prefer otherwise, I tend towards staying with using Scipy for the Cholesky decomposition.

I am not completely sure about theses changes. Square roots do not always exist in the same field, such as cyclotomic fields for which `sqrt` returns a result in `SR`. Granted, this probably did not work before either, as comparisons are broken in number fields (#20028).

For finite fields, the [documentation](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/226937dfa9b8b335e873c3c65a796ae1b0924ff2/src/sage/rings/finite_rings/element_givaro.pyx#L1314-L1316) advises against relying on comparisons as well.

It might be better to explicitly check whether `d` is equal to zero when the tolerance is zero.

This lurking doubt is what kept me from setting it back to needs_review right away. A priori we could square both sides to avoid roots, but I still have some questions. For the moment, a lot of this stuff is broken in corner cases anyway, so I don't feel too bad about making incremental but imperfect improvements so long as they don't hurt any existing use cases.

But for finite fields I think you're right, and I vaguely remember coming to the same conclusion. If the fields are exact, the tolerance should be zero unless you override it, and it's only by accident that the comparison works but it does work. If a tolerance is given, though, I'm not even sure what the user could expect to happen.
