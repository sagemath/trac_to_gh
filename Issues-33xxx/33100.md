```
For some double dense matrices that are not positive definite, Sage incorrectly claims that they are:

    ```
    sage: A = matrix(CDF, [[1+I]])
    sage: A.is_positive_definite()  # should be False
    True
    sage: A.is_positive_semidefinite()  # correct
    False
    ```

Clearly, `A` is not even Hermitian. The implementation relies on testing whether a Cholesky decomposition exists or not, but `.cholesky()` gives an incorrect result for this matrix

    ```
    sage: A.cholesky()
    [1.0]
    ```

while for most other matrices this would raise an error.

The [SciPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.cholesky.html) is not entirely clear about this, but it seems that SciPy assumes that the matrix is already Hermitian positive-definite and thus only considers half the matrix (see [SciPy issues 2116](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/2116#issuecomment-990487066) and [15012](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/15012)).

This ticket adds a check whether the matrix is Hermitian before computing the Cholesky decomposition, which resolves the problem. The default algorithm for `is_hermitian` is changed from "orthonormal" to "naive".

This also fails for larger matrices, such as these linear combinations of positive definite matrices (for many seeds):

```
sage: set_random_seed(0)
sage: random_pd_matrix = lambda n: (B := matrix.random(CDF, n)) * B.H
sage: r = 2  # 2 or larger
sage: n = 3  # 1 or larger
sage: As = [random_pd_matrix(n) for j in range(r)]
sage: C = random_pd_matrix(r)
sage: A = sum(sum(C[i,j] for i in range(r)) * As[j] for j in range(r))
sage: A.is_positive_definite()  # should usually be False

My first thought was that we should be able to delete `cholesky()` and `is_positive_definite()` in the subclass to obtain something possibly slower, but that actually works. There are two small problems though.

First, the generic `cholesky()` doesn't work on the trivial matrix, breaking one doctest (#33107). This is an easy fix.

Second, the subclass implementation of `is_hermitian()` used by the superclass's `is_cholesky()` doesn't work out-of-the box. For example,

```
sage: M = matrix(RDF,[[ 1,  1,    1,     1,     1],                 
....:                 [ 1,  5,   31,   121,   341],                 
....:                 [ 1, 31,  341,  1555,  4681],                 
....:                 [ 1,121, 1555,  7381, 22621],                 
....:                 [ 1,341, 4681, 22621, 69905]])
M.is_hermitian(algorithm='orthonormal') # the default
False
```

while

```
sage: M.is_hermitian(algorithm='orthonormal', tol=1e-10)
True
```

or

```
sage: M.is_hermitian(algorithm='naive')
True
```

We'd have to either tweak the default tolerance there, or again maybe just delete the subclass method. The "naive" algorithm now defers to a superclass implementation where the default tolerance works.

I am a bit hesitant to replace a Scipy implementation by a pure Sage implementation. Upstream has confirmed [here](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/2116#issuecomment-1003690573) that `scipy.linalg.cholesky` essentially first constructs a Hermitian matrix by only considering the given triangular information of the matrix, ignoring the other half.

I haven't checked but scipy is almost certainly faster even though I did my best to make it fast in sage. On the other hand, it's nice not to have copy & pasted the entire method's documentation.

> This would make `is_positive_definite` work as intended by the implementation. Though, it would in most cases produce the same result as `is_positive_semidefinite`, as a Cholesky decomposition can exist for semidefinite matrices, but for matrices that are actually singular this can easily fail. Is there an intended difference between these methods? Perhaps debatable, but from a usage point of view I would expect something like
> - `is_positive_definite` = all eigenvalues strictly positive (or `> tolerance`)
> - `is_positive_semidefinite` = all eigenvalues `> -tolerance`
> (implemented in a numerically sane way).

The superclass `cholesky()` and `is_*definite()` methods support both exact and inexact rings in a numerically stable way (caveat: `is_hermitian()` itself is not yet reliable, that's #33053) via `block_ldlt()`. For inexact rings, positive-definite and positive-semidefinite are indeed basically the same up to machine precision, but the tests use `> 0` and `>= 0`.

Unless you strongly prefer otherwise, I tend towards staying with using Scipy for the Cholesky decomposition.

For some reason, I did not receive an email notification for comment 11. Also, this does not seem so useful without knowing which of the three dozen tickets causes a merge conflict, so I have to wait for the new beta anyway. It would be more helpful if the CI identifies merge conflicts between positively reviewed tickets, so that one can resolve conflicts before it even gets any attention by the release manager.

I am not completely sure about theses changes. Square roots do not always exist in the same field, such as cyclotomic fields for which `sqrt` returns a result in `SR`. Granted, this probably did not work before either, as comparisons are broken in number fields (#20028).

For finite fields, the [documentation](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/226937dfa9b8b335e873c3c65a796ae1b0924ff2/src/sage/rings/finite_rings/element_givaro.pyx#L1314-L1316) advises against relying on comparisons as well. Though, technically they should work in our case, i.e. if the integer representation of a finite field element is compared to a tolerance of 0.

It might be better to explicitly check whether `d` is equal to zero when the tolerance is zero.
