Some care for algebras catalog at

- https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/algebras/catalog.html

Namely:

1. Add `tensor_algebra` to the documentation, under free algebras.
2. Remove stray `’` from quantum Clifford in algebras catalog.
3. Give correct module or class for alternating central extension.
