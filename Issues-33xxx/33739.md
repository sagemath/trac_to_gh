The current solution to prebuild the gitpod docker image using github actions does not work nicely, since prebuilds triggered shortly after a new release still use the old gitpod image (and it may take up to a few days until the new image is available). This is especially notable for the `develop` branch, which is the default entry point if you want to start a new branch on gitpod.

In this ticket, we migrate the gitpod config to use the conda environment, which is now generally stable enough for serious development (e.g. almost all tests pass). As a positive side effect, the gitpod config simplifies and startup times are considerably reduced.

As the documentation says -

 (including all Python packages) are provided by conda. [...] this will invalidate the 
 use of any Sage-the-distribution commands such as ``sage -i``. Do not use them."

When done, I agree that switching gitpod to conda is a good idea. 

Also consider that both the conda stuff and the gitpod stuff are new -- for onboarding current developers, right now I think it's better if gitpod shows them something that is more familiar.

How would devcontainer help here? Gitpod doesn't support them yet and its not clear yet when they will and in which form; the linked github issue reads more like that the are considering this as a alternative syntax for their gitpod.yml file and not that they would offer prebuilds for all defined devcontainers.

Even with a conda-based gitpod, you can simply deactivate the conda environment and run `configure && make`. This is pretty much a disposable devcontainer without prebuild.

The advantage would be that you can run whatever commands you want without worrying how it affects the rest of your system / the main installation of sage.

Anyway, I still think that package updates are only a small subset of all tickets and making them temporarily slightly less convenient to test with gitpod is a price worth paying if gitpod gets more useful for the rest of the tickets. Moreover, as you mention, gitpod support is new so developers can easily go back to whatever they were using before to test package updates until further improvements like #33671 are implemented.

It would be nice if this ticket could be merged before the sagedays so that I don't have to wait 5mins during my talk until the workspace started.
