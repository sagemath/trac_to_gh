The magic `%matplotlib widget`, which provides interactive Matplotlib display via the package [ipympl](https://github.com/matplotlib/ipympl) introduced in #32069, is inoperative in the scope of `%display latex`: 
in a Jupyter notebook the cell

```
%display latex
%matplotlib widget
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4])
plt.ylabel('some numbers')
plt.show()
```
results in the raw output

```

instead of the interactive Matplotlib window. Replacing `%display latex` by `%display plain` makes the cell work fine.
See also the test notebook below.  

This is problematic for Jupyterlab, where the magic `%matplotlib notebook` is not supported and must be replaced by `%matplotlib widget`.

I hit presumably the same problem this morning in class with
students that wanted to build widgets in Sage.

# How to reproduce

```
%display latex
import ipywidgets
ipywidgets.IntSlider()
```
outputs a string representation instead of the slider:

```
𝙸𝚗𝚝𝚂𝚕𝚒𝚍𝚎𝚛(𝚟𝚊𝚕𝚞𝚎=𝟶)
```

# Proposed fix

Sage's formatter has a list of "Python native types"
that should be left alone during display. This list contains
`interactive`, the type of objects produced by ``@`interact`. This
could be generalized to any jupyter widget (type `ipywigets.Widget`),
which should include the widgets produced by ipyml.

# Temporary workaround

Apply the proposed fix by monkey patching:

```
sage.repl.display.formatter.IPYTHON_NATIVE_TYPES += (ipywidgets.Widget,)
```

Actually, this specific addition is not even necessary: as you pointed out

```
import ipywidgets
sage.repl.display.formatter.IPYTHON_NATIVE_TYPES += (ipywidgets.Widget,)
```
is more generic and suffices to fix the issue with `ipympl`.

Great. So the next step is to implement the fix directly in Sage.

I might not be able to do it in the next days, so anyone feel free

I have no idea, either. But if the test does not test the patch, then I think it is of no use.

On the other hand, any change in the output system may cause unexpected side effects which are detected only by human eyes. It seems that the best we can do is to check a good many examples with the patch. There is another ticket #11362 that needs the same scrutiny.

Here it is : [test_display.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/egourgoulhon/SageMathTest/blob/master/Notebooks/test_display.ipynb).
Note that it lies in a git repository, so feel free to amend it by sending a pull request to [SageMathTest](https://github.com/egourgoulhon/SageMathTest). 

It would be nice to have this ticket merged in Sage 9.6. IMHO, it is ready to go. Simply maybe the test mentioned in[comment:11](#comment%3A11) could be removed, given that the actual test is the "human-eyes" one, e.g. via the above notebook.
