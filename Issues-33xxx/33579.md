I'm not sure it's the right way to do it and I don't understand why some doctests have to be modified...

Also, we have some doctest errors in `src/sage/tests/books/computational-mathematics-with-sagemath/graphtheory_doctest.py` that we will have to fix in the `graphtheory.tex` (I don't know where it is yet).
