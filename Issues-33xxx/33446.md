# Issue 33446: To determine `GAP_SO` sage.env looks for `libgap.so` but it should look for `libgap.so*`

installed. Indeed, the symlink `/usr/lib/libgap.so -> libgap.so.0.0.0` is shipped in `gap-devel` which is not needed to run sagemath at all.

This is because the implementation of the function `sage.env._get_shared_lib_path()` will look for `libgap.so` instead of `libgap.so*`. The fix is trivial:

```

                 search_directories.append(Path(SAGE_LOCAL) / 'lib')
```

Note that this function is only used once in `sage.env` to set `GAP_SO`.

Without the fix above my `GAP_SO` is set to `None` and I get failures like

```

I don't understand why libgap needs to be `dlopen()`, since it is already linked in. The relevant tickets for that hack are #26930 and [#22626 comment:424](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/22626#comment:424), but it's not clear to me how to reproduce the claimed failure without the hack.

In any case if there are multiple versions of the shared library installed, nothing guarantees that the correct one is loaded. It seems like a "more correct" way to find the shared library that is actually already loaded would be based on something like:

```
sage: sage.libs.gap.libgap.__loader__.path
'/opt/sage/sage-git/develop/pkgs/sagemath-standard/build/lib.linux-x86_64-3.10/sage/libs/gap/libgap.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so'
sage: os.system("ldd %s | grep libgap" % sage.libs.gap.libgap.__loader__.path)
	libgap.so.0 => /usr/lib/libgap.so.0 (0x00007fd15418f000)
0
```
I'm not sure how portable is `ldd` (an alternative is `objdump -p` but that requires binutils which is not otherwise required to run sagemath).

One possibility is to skip the hack altogether when `GAP_SO` is unset. That seems to work ok, but I'm not quite convinced. The hack is either needed or not needed, and making it depend on some circumstantial detail (e.g. whether `gap-devel` is installed in the system or not) seems wrong.

I understand the problem, but the libtool version number is an implementation detail here. The user-facing library is `libgap.so`. While it's technically true that you can use gap itself without `libgap.so` because the symlink is followed at link-time and "libgap.so.0.0.0" is recorded into whatever you're linking... if the GAP package is meant to provide `libgap` in a usable way, it doesn't.

There is some subtler distinction to be made here, but my point is that the distro package in question isn't usable by anyone who wants to *build* software that links to libgap. I think that should be fixed, independent of this issue. And then as a side effect, this problem just happens to disappear.

Given that most major distros have at least one developer with a presence here... if there's a solution that's better for everyone and requires only a minor tweak to a distro package rather than piling more hacks onto what's already a hack within sage, I think we should be thankful for our good luck.

In the end, the only "correct" way to proceed is to figure out the actual soname that the gap extension module in sagemath was linked with, namely:

```
$ objdump -p /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/libs/gap/libgap.so | grep NEEDED.*libgap
  NEEDED               libgap.so.0
```
This is telling you that you must look for `libgap.so.0`, not for `libgap.so` since that (a) may not be installed (b) may point to a different version of the library.

The path to the extension module itself can be had with

```
sage: sage.libs.gap.libgap.__loader__.path
'/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/libs/gap/libgap.so'
```
This should be portable, but `objdump` may not be available at runtime (part of binutils). Using `ldd` may be better:

```
$ ldd /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/libs/gap/libgap.so | grep libgap
	libgap.so.0 => /usr/lib/libgap.so.0 (0x00007f964dd21000)
```

Of course it would be much better to just avoid using `dlopen()`, assuming the bug in gap leading to this ugly hack has been fixed upstream (see https://github.com/markuspf/gap/issues/1 for the explanation).

Playing the devil's advocate there.\n\nSure, that's what linking does; in the case of dynamic linking this is done by recording the \"soname\" of the library in the \"needed\" section. If we must use `dlopen()` we should strive to match the semantics of the dynamic linker for consistency (both in terms of using the same soname and the same search paths).\n\nIn particular, the soname is the precise granularity of the \"lock on a specific version\" that should be used. For example, if a new version of gap changes `libgap.so.0.0.0` to `libgap.so.0.1.0` but the soname stays `libgap.so.0` that would be an indication that the new library is backwards compatible and it shouldn't be necessary to rebuild sagemath. If the symlink is fully resolved at build time and `GAP_SO` is hardcoded to `libgap.so.0.0.0` this will break.\n\nAgain, it'd be much easier to avoid using `dlopen()` altogether. That depends on whether https://github.com/markuspf/gap/issues/1 is fixed. I don't have gap with compiled packages to test (a compiled package would have some *.so file that should have `libgap.so.0` in the needed section -- the bug is that it doesn't).",

Replying to [@kiwifb](#comment:24):
> If we are so worried about mixing up versions because of potential incompatibility, surely we should lock on a specific version of the library in the first place? Playing the devil's advocate there.

Sure, that's what linking does; in the case of dynamic linking this is done by recording the "soname" of the library in the "needed" section. If we must use `dlopen()` we should strive to match the semantics of the dynamic linker for consistency (both in terms of using the same soname and the same search paths).

In particular, the soname is the precise granularity of the "lock on a specific version" that should be used. For example, if a new version of gap changes `libgap.so.0.0.0` to `libgap.so.0.1.0` but the soname stays `libgap.so.0` that would be an indication that the new library is backwards compatible and it shouldn't be necessary to rebuild sagemath. If the symlink is fully resolved at build time and `GAP_SO` is hardcoded to `libgap.so.0.0.0` this will break.

Again, it'd be much easier to avoid using `dlopen()` altogether. That depends on whether https://github.com/markuspf/gap/issues/1 is fixed. I don't have gap with compiled packages to test (a compiled package would have some *.so file that should have `libgap.so.0` in the needed section -- the bug is that it doesn't).

Here's how to reproduce (in sagemath-9.5) the original bug for which the `dlopen()` hack is needed:

1. build sage 9.5 from scratch, and also build optional package `gap_packages`:

```
$ ./configure --disable-doc
...
$ make -j36 build
...
$ make -j36 gap_packages
...
```

2. set `GAP_SO = ""` before using `libgap`, this disables "the hack":

```
$ ./sage
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SageMath version 9.5, Release Date: 2022-01-30                     │

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
sage: sage.env.GAP_SO = ""    # This disables the hack
sage: libgap.LoadPackage("io")
#W dlopen() error: /home/tornaria/src/sage/sage-9.5/local/share/gap/pkg/io-4.7.0/bin/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-default64-kv7/io.so: undefined symbol: ChangedBags
Panic in src/modules.c:893: Failed to load needed dynamic module /home/tornaria/src/sage/sage-9.5/local/share/gap/pkg/io-4.7.0/bin/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-default64-kv7/io.so, error code 1
```
As explained in https://github.com/markuspf/gap/issues/1 this is because the gap compiled package (io.so) is missing a needed libgap.so.0:

```
$ ldd local/lib/gap/pkg/io-4.7.0/bin/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-default64-kv7/io.so
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffe2595c000)
        libc.so.6 => /usr/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007f8d7bf19000)
        /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f8d7c102000)
```
The problem is that in fact `io.so` uses some symbols that are exported in `libgap.so.0` without adding that to its needed section. The hack is to reload `libgap.so.0` with `RTLD_GLOBAL` so that all the symbols in `libgap.so.0` are placed in the global symbol table where `io.so` can have them.

If we don't disable "the hack" then the io.so package can be loaded ok:

```
$ ./sage 
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SageMath version 9.5, Release Date: 2022-01-30                     │

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
sage: libgap.LoadPackage("io")
true
```

This looks to me a real bug in libgap which should be fixed upstream... As explained in the github issue above, when running `gap` as a program (instead of a library) the problem doesn't arise since `gap` the program contains the whole of `libgap` (instead of being dynamically linked) so that all the required symbols are already in the global symbol table.

It occurred to me that since the gap extension modules in sage already link to "the correct" `libgap` using the dynamic linker, using `dlopen()` on one of these extension modules would be a workaround that avoid the need for `GAP_SO` altogether. Indeed:

     if handle is NULL:

```

With this patch loading gap packages works without the need for `GAP_SO`:

```

sage: print(sage.env.GAP_SO)
None
sage: libgap.LoadPackage("io")
true
sage:
```

Explanation:
- `__loader__.path` here is a shortcut for `sage.libs.gap.util.__loader__.path` which contains the full path to the `sage.libs.gap.util` extension module (should be something like `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.10/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/libs/gap/util.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so` for a normal install of sage, may be `/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/libs/gap/util.so` for a system install of sage).
- apply "the hack" (reload using `dlopen()` with `RTLD_GLOBAL`) to this extension module instead of `GAP_SO`.
- since the extension module is linked to "the correct" libgap (via NEEDED section, etc) this will also reload libgap in the global symbol table.

Notes:
- the error message should be reworked (or else, it's probably safe to get rid of)
- there is another user of `GAP_SO` in `sage.interfaces.gap_workspace`, where it is used to link the workspace save name to the actual libgap -- I'm not sure why is that important (see [#31404 comment:40](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31404#comment:40) and a801e6d). I should point out that since in principle `GAP_SO` will always be `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libgap.so.0.0.0` for a normal sage install, there's really not much of a difference in using `SAGE_LOCAL` instead. I don't understand the need for this in the workspace name, it traces back to 40e41cd2118b from 2007.
- maybe the same trick works for singular and we can get rid of `LIBSINGULAR_PATH` as well.

I replaced the previous patch by two commits to do what I said before: one for gap, one for singular.

For me everything seems to be working fine after this on glibc. I will later test on musl (I assume all glibc systems should be similar, but musl may be different). Can someone test in macos, and maybe cygwin? (although "the hack" for singular is disabled in cygwin, why? it's not for gap).

If this works we can then remove `LIBSINGULAR_PATH` and `GAP_SO` from `sage.env` and `singular/spkg-configure.m4`.

Is it the case that all symbols are global on cygwin? If so there is no need to `dlopen(RTLD_GLOBAL)` at all, neither for singular nor for gap.

OTOH, I understand this is skipped on cygwin because figuring out the singular soname is difficult. Since this is not a problem now, it may as well be done unconditionally.

I think reverting [a801e6d](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/a801e6d) should be ok, i.e. back to hashing SAGE_LOCAL.

Background:
- the hash of SAGE_ROOT (later changed to SAGE_LOCAL) in the workspace filename was introduced by wstein in [40e41cd](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/40e41cd2118b4b581fbdc14ef68c53c828c14262) and [76b1b00](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/76b1b000e86aa99dc29a5a6bf84151a567be0d68) in 2007.
- I think the intent is that if one has different installations of sage, they don't mix up the gap workspace (which IIUC is only for caching purposes), I guess in case different versions of sage use the gap workspace in different/incompatible ways.
- Using GAP_SO is almost equivalent to using SAGE_LOCAL for bundled gap (GAP_SO = SAGE_LOCAL + "lib/libgap.so.0.0.0"), but it may be worse for system gap (pending #29644) in the sense that all different installations of sage will have the same GAP_SO
- If the intent of [a801e6d](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/a801e6d) is catching changes in the version of gap, well it seems upstream doesn't change the library version often (it's stuck in 0.0.0). Moreover, sage.libs.gap.saved_workspace has a different way to track changes in gap, namely by looking at the timestamp of files in the gap root directory it may decide that gap has changed and the workspace needs to be reset. Anyway that check doesn't seem completely ok but if there's any issue with that it should be addressed there and not with the library version that doesn't really change.
- It may be wise to ask wstein about his motivation for this, just in case.

About the rationale for hash(SAGE_LOCAL) wstein told me:

It just seems unlikely they would be backward and forward compatible between potentially wildly different versions of Gap.   Different Sage installs could easily have very different versions of Gap in them.

I also asked him "if I use two different versions of sage which use the same gap, wouldn't there be a problem if they share the same gap workspace?" to which he said:
> I think it would be OK because the relevant version of gap is the same, but I'm not sure either.

To be safe, maybe combine KERNEL_VERSION and GAP_ARCHITECTURE from above together with SAGE_LOCAL. Perhaps add sage.env.HOSTNAME to the filename.

No, that's not the mechanism. Singular uses a different mechanism on the Cygwin platform to provide its modules. Everything is already linked into the library libSingular.

On the Cygwin platform, all symbols must be resolved at link time. See #30814 (`--no-undefined`)

I don't know what GAP does and whether anyone has even successfully used `gap_packages` on the Cygwin platform.

In the last commit I change theh workspace filename to be computed as follows:

```
    data = SAGE_LOCAL
    sysinfo = os.path.join(GAP_ROOT_DIR, "sysinfo.gap")
    if os.path.exists(sysinfo):
        data += subprocess.getoutput(f'. {sysinfo} && echo ":$GAP_VERSION:GAParch"')
    h = hashlib.sha1(data.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
    return os.path.join(dir, '%s-%s-%s-%s' % (system, name, HOSTNAME, h))
```

I realized it's NOT reasonable to run gap code as suggested above, since it would double the initialization time for sage (gap is slow to start).

It turns out that the gap root should contain a file `sysinfo.gap` which can be sourced from shell and contains gap version, etc. so I just did that.

I doubt there will be a way to eliminate the need for `GAP_ROOT_DIR` but that is matter for #29644.

I rebased everything on 9.8.beta1.

I am still unsure what to do about `gap_workspace_file()` and whether the last commit is ok.

I think it would be better to use stuff from `KERNEL_INFO()` as mentioned in [comment:40](#comment:40). The problem with that is that `gap_workspace_file()` is called on sage startup and initializing gap is slow. The solution could be to delay calling `gap_workspace_file()` until it is actually used (at which point gap or libgap will be initialized anyway).

For the short run, what is here seems better (with or without the last commit). Right now I still have to patch stuff for void linux since we don't ship `/usr/lib/libgap.so` with runtime packages (and it is a pain since everything will work ok if `gap-devel` happens to be installed, which is the case when building, so the failure tends to be missed).

Replying to [Dima Pasechnik](#comment:55):
> let's get #34391 in first - it's a bit hard to review now.

Sure, but just for the record: the head of #34391 is
- ​29383be	backport GAP PR 5235
and my branch here is linearly rebased on top of that.

I could squash some of the commits together if that makes it easier to review (ec2476b + 4768b99 + 126b0de are part of the same change, in a sense). That would leave 5 clearly defined commits.
