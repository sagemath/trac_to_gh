$ sage
...
Unhandled SIGILL: An illegal instruction occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Illegal instruction
```

This is from primecount, which appends `-mpopcnt` to `CXXFLAGS` even when the CPU does not support it.

Looks like it should work, but can you add a comment to the spkg-install mentioning that e.g. `WITH_POPCNT=OFF` is harmless on gcc when popcnt is available? That way if we ever `git grep gcc` to support other compilers, we find the comment.
