These are three classes of orthogonal polynomials in
the [Askey scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Askey_scheme).
We should provide an implementation based on
their definition as hypergeometric functions.

This ticket provides just a basic implementation with
no particular reason for the normalization choices.

An implementation of the Krawtchouk polynomials appear in `coding/delsarte_bounds.py`. I am cc-ing those people as they might be interested (at least for consistency such as normalization differences and/or possible cross-references). This code is likely slower as it is more general but I haven't checked.
