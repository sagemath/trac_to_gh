Comments welcome!  In particular, it would be wonderful to find more interesting applications.  

In short: given two finite sets `A` and `B`, a statistic `tau: B -> Z`, and a set partition `P` of `A`, the program finds all possible statistics `s: A -> Z` which have the same distribution as `tau` but are constant on the blocks of `P`.

There is still some ongoing work. In particular, we try to implement a cache of solutions, which is checked for counterexamples before asking the solver to produce a counterexample from scratch.

I have found the culprit already - `deepcopy` takes forever:

```
sage: %prun next(bij.solutions_iterator())
         54830 function calls (54618 primitive calls) in 25.558 seconds

   Ordered by: internal time

   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)

   ...
```

A question about the general design: currently there is a helper class `_BijectionistMILP`.  I am not quite sure whether it might be better to merge it into the main class or not.

The idea in creating it was to separate the MILP from the user interface.  More precisely, the methods `Bijectionist.set_*` in the main class are responsible to normalizing and organizing the input, whereas the methods `_BijectionistMILP.add_*_constraint` in the helper class actually turn the input into constraints.

Also, the helper class organizes a cache of solutions, and, whenever a new solution is found, a veto constraint is added to the MILP.  Put differently, the set of solutions in the cache together with the set of solutions in the MILP is always constant.

I think the current solution is OK, but I am open to improvements.

It may help to think about the overall structure of the code by considering whether 1. other enumeration technologies could be supported, or 2. whether some of your code could be generalized. 

1. Alternative techniques for the 0/1 enumeration: lattice point enumeration (`Polyhedron.integral_points()`), SAT (e.g. #33461 cvc5). 

2. Here you enumerate 0/1 solutions by repeatedly solving a MIP with no-good cuts added.

Please excuse, I have yet another question.  I was trying to simplify `evaluate_linear_function`, is there code to check whether a given set of values satisfies a constraint?

Besides, I asked chatGPT.  It answered as follows:

--- begin quote ---

Yes, you can use the MILP class from the `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` module in [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) to check whether a given set of values satisfies a constraint of a MILP.

Here is an example of how you can use the MILP class to check whether a given set of values satisfies a constraint of a MILP:

```
from sage.numerical.mip import MixedIntegerLinearProgram

# Create a new MILP
milp = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()

# Set up variables
x = milp.new_variable(real=True, nonnegative=True)
y = milp.new_variable(real=True, nonnegative=True)

# Set up constraints
milp.add_constraint(x + y <= 1)
milp.add_constraint(x - y >= 0)

# Check whether the given set of values satisfies the constraints
satisfies_constraints = milp.check_feasibility([x: 0.5, y: 0.5])

print(satisfies_constraints)  # prints True
```

Could you show me the definition of check_feasibility?

Certainly! Here is the definition of the `check_feasibility` method of the MILP class from the `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` module in [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath):

```
def check_feasibility(self, values=None, variable_order=None, solver=None):
    """
    Check the feasibility of a given set of values.
    
    INPUT:
    
    - ``values`` -- a dictionary of variable names to values.
    
    - ``variable_order`` -- a list of variable names in the order in which they
      should be presented to the solver. If not specified, the default
      order is used.
    
    - ``solver`` -- the name of the solver to use. If not specified, the
      default solver is used.
    
    OUTPUT:
    
    Returns True if the given set of values satisfies all of the constraints
    of the MILP, and False otherwise.
    
    EXAMPLES:
    
    Check the feasibility of a given set of values::
    
        sage: from sage.numerical.mip import MixedIntegerLinearProgram
        sage: milp = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
        sage: x = milp.new_variable(real=True, nonnegative=True)
        sage: y = milp.new_variable(real=True, nonnegative=True)
        sage: milp.add_constraint(x + y <= 1)
        sage: milp.add_constraint(x - y >= 0)
        sage: milp.check_feasibility([x: 0.5, y: 0.5])
        True
    
    """
    # ...
```

Sorry for the jargon. "Cut" is short for "inequality". What you call a "veto inequality" is commonly called a "no-good cut". 

When you have a solution x1=1, x2=1, x3=0, x4=0,
you are generating an inequality x1+x2 <= 1 in order to cut off this solution, but 
this is only valid because you know that x1+x2+x3+x4 = 2.
The more general form of the no-good cut would be (1-x1)+(1-x2)+x3+x4 >= 1, which is linearly equivalent to your inequality given x1+x2+x3+x4 = 2.

<div id="comment:52" align="right">comment:52</div>

Is it really the case that `LinearConstraint` does not know its variables, other than by integer index, and that, given an index, there is no way to obtain the key?

Explicitly:

```
sage: m = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: x = m.new_variable(indices=["a", "b", "c"])
sage: c = x["a"] + 2*x["b"] >= 3
sage: low, f = next(c.inequalities())
sage: x.items()
dict_items([('a', x_0), ('b', x_1), ('c', x_2)])
sage: f.dict()
{0: 1.0, 1: 2.0}
```
What I'd like to do is to "evaluate" `f`, and I think that this should be a method in `LinearConstraint`, possibly it should be the `subs` method, but I am unsure, because I'd like it to return `True` or `False` if the constraint is satisfied by the given values.

Some more comments on this:
- the steps of `_initialize_new_bmilp` could be merged into `_BijectionistMILP.__init__`
- `_show_bmilp` would make more sense as a method of `_BijectionistMILP` (it breaks the abstraction of `_BijectionistMILP`)
- also `_solution` could be changed to a (public) method of `_BijectionistMILP`; and perhaps there could be a slightly more high-level function so that various Bijectionist methods do not have to repeat the "try ... solve ... except MIPSolverException ... else solution" pattern

The default implementation of `integral_points` is not very good for this use case.
But after `sage -i pynormaliz`, you can do 

```
sage: bmilp = bij._initialize_new_bmilp()
sage: %time p = bmilp.milp.polyhedron(base_ring=QQ, backend='normaliz')
CPU times: user 110 ms, sys: 3.31 ms, total: 113 ms
Wall time: 112 ms
sage: %time p = bmilp.milp.polyhedron(base_ring=QQ, backend='normaliz').integral_points()
CPU times: user 317 ms, sys: 35.3 ms, total: 352 ms
Wall time: 380 ms
```
In this example (perfect formulation), it only adds overhead.

It would be interesting to investigate bijectionist examples in which the IP solver actually has to do something nontrivial.

I have now completed most of your suggestions.  The remaining ones are:

* perhaps there could be a slightly more high-level function [replacing `_BijectionistMILP.solution`] so that various Bijectionist methods do not have to repeat the `try ... solve ... except MIPSolverException ... else solution` pattern 

* I would also suggest to introduce a method in `_BijectionistMILP` that returns the variable `_x[p, z]` so that you can remove the direct use of this attribute from the Bijectionist class.

I am not completely sure how exactly I should go about these.  I am still not convinced that it is a good idea to have the helper class at all.  The distinction between "temporary constraints", which are built in the main class and passed to `_BijectionistMILP.solve` and "permanent constraints", which are built by `_BijectionistMILP` itself, doesn't look completely right to me.

Also, it seems a bit strange that `_BijectionistMILP` calls methods of the main class, `_preprocess_intertwining_relations` and `_compute_possible_block_values`.  Maybe these should be moved to the helper class also?  

On a quite different level, I am pretty sure that the logic of `_forced_constant_blocks` can be simplified.  Apart from the main routine, note that at the very end we do `self.set_constant_blocks`, which invalidates the MILP and therefore all solutions in the cache.

Yet another thing, which is truly a detail: the method `_is_solution` really should be a method of `LinearConstraint`.

In summary, there is still a lot of work that could be done, but I am not sure whether the right time for this is now.

No, I have no idea what's going on, because we have

            raise ValueError("The constraint's index i must satisfy 0 <= i < number_of_constraints")

Instead of `type(...) is list`, you can use `isinstance(..., collections.abc.Iterable)` - https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections-abstract-base-classes

Also after each the `elif` blocks, there should probably be an `else` block that raises an error.

            def add_solution(solutions, solution):
                for p, value in solution.items():
                    if p not in solutions:
                        solutions[p] = set()
                    solutions[p].add(value)

            [...]

            solutions = {}
            add_solution(solutions, solution)
```
This can be simplified using `solutions = defaultdict(set)`

I think it would make sense to rework it so that you only make copies and add constraints, rather than trying to remove constraints. This would probably simplify the logic of the code (helping to get rid of the notion of "temporary constraints").

And it also makes sense from the viewpoint of the polyhedral enumeration method: Some polyhedral computation backends (including Normaliz) have some support for adding constraints (although this is not exposed yet in Sage's Polyhedron classes)

Well, currently removing is *much* faster, even after the patch in #21003.

The difference in code is quite local - it only affects the `_BijectionistMILP.solve` method.

So, if possible I'd rather concentrate on the design and, if this is reasonable, get it into sage in the hope that some interesting use cases pop up.  I am using it in my day to day research, but of course, that's a rather biased view.

Do you mean to combine `solve` and `solution` into something like the following?

```
def solution(self, on_blocks, temporary_constraints, new_solution):
```
I agree that this makes sense.

I don't see how to eliminate `solution_index` entirely (other than making it Boolean).  There are three (slightly) differen clients:

1. get any (initial) solution
2. get a solution with some additional, temporary, constraints
3. get a new solution

The last version is needed in the `solutions_iterator`.  It differs from 1., because it may be quite hard to find a new solution, but easy to get just any.

I could also offer two different methods, `solution` and `new_solution`, but this would split the code in a very artificial way - `solution` may need to call `new_solution` with temporary constraints.

Why would this get rid of `solution_index`?

Apart from that, I repeat that it is not at all clear to me whether there should be one class or two classes, or, more generally, which methods should be in which class.

The general idea so far was, that the `Bijectionist.set`-methods only normalize the data, the `_BijectionistMILP` class sets up the constraints, and the other methods in `Bijectionist` retrieve solutions (of various kinds) from the `_BijectionistMILP` class.

It seems desirable that after retrieving certain kinds of solutions (e.g., `constant_blocks(optimal=True)`, the MILP should be rewritten.  However, I don't know in which cases this makes sense.  For example, currently this is not done for `possible_values(optimal=True)`, because I was unable to find a situation where this makes sense.  I also suspect that this might also depend a lot on the solver and how we use it.

In any case, maybe we should be more radical and move even more stuff into `_BijectionistMILP` - i.e., make the `Bijectionist` mainly a wrapper for methods from the `_BijectionistMILP` class?

One further remark: the method `Bijectionist.statistics_fibers` is probably one of the most useful methods, and does not involve any MILP at all.  It is important that this is lightweight.

Asking the model to provide an iterator for solutions is a better interface than asking it to provide the n-th solution if iterating through the solutions is all you need.

Althout I do not understand how this answers my question, I assume it might be better to push down the implementations of `solutions_iterator`, `minimal_subdistributions_iterator`, `minimal_subdistribution_blocks_iterator`, `possible_values` and `constant_blocks`.

Do you agree, and would this be a step towards a positive review?

I think it is better to think about `_BijectionistMILP` as a class that manages one family of MIP models - the one set up by its `__init__` method and possibly additional ("temporary") constraints. The class translates between the natural presentation of solutions and the technical presentation (encoding) that is used by the MIP model.

The method `minimal_subdistributions_iterator` uses a different, unrelated MIP model. It should not be managed by the same class. If you want, you can create a separate class for it.

Likewise for `minimal_subdistributions_blocks_iterator`.

We have a cache of solutions.

The iterator is supposed to yield from this cache, and only if it is at the end of the cache, generate new solutions.  However, other methods may also request that solutions - with special properties - are added to the cache.

It is not so interesting anymore, since the problem has been solved, but you could look at the "benchmark example" for larger N, perhaps 7 or 8 (with `minimal_subdistributions_blocks_iterator`).  For N=6 the output is just 18 lines, and takes about 40 seconds on my laptop.  In this case, just 104 solutions of the original problem are generated (and almost all the computation goes into the milp set up in line 2075).

+        evaluate = lambda f: sum(coeff if index == -1 else
+                                 coeff * values[index_block_value_dict[index]]
+                                 for index, coeff in f.dict().items())
```
should be a nested `def` instead. 

Since the linter is currently broken, I'd recommend to run `./sage -tox -- src/sage/combinat/bijectionist.py` and fix any reported issues

Thank you!  `./sage -tox -- src/sage/combinat/bijectionist.py` does not emit any warnings on my machine.

On the combinatorics side, there is still the issue with the name of `set_pseudo_inverse_relation`, which is currently as silly as can be, but I don't know any better and did not yet receive an answer on https://mathoverflow.net/q/437261.
