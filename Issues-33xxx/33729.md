This

```
Zn=IntegerModRing(6)
Zn
```
gives `Ring of integers modulo 6`. But after `%display latex`, it gives

```
\Boldùëç/6\Boldùëç
```
This is caused by the changes in #33475 merged to sage 9.6.beta6.

Strange. It works well with me both with 9.6rc0 (on my desktop) and 9.5 (on Cocalc).

With 9.6rc0, what do you get from `print(html(Zn))`? I get

```
<html>\(\displaystyle \newcommand{\ZZ}{\Bold{Z}}\ZZ/6\ZZ\)</html>
```

```
\Boldùëç/6\Boldùëç

and `print(html(Zn))` shows

```
<html>\(\displaystyle \newcommand{\ZZ}{\Bold{Z}}\ZZ/6\ZZ\)</html>

with sage 9.6rc0. On the other hand, `ZZ` displays correctly and `print(html(ZZ))` shows

I don't know what happened with me before...
