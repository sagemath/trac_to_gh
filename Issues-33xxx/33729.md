This

```
Zn=IntegerModRing(6)
Zn
```
gives `Ring of integers modulo 6`. But after `%display latex`, it gives

```
\Boldùëç/6\Boldùëç
```
This is caused by the changes in #33475 merged to sage 9.6.beta6.

Strange. It works well with me both with 9.6rc0 (on my desktop) and 9.5 (on Cocalc).

With 9.6rc0, what do you get from `print(html(Zn))`? I get

```
<html>\(\displaystyle \newcommand{\ZZ}{\Bold{Z}}\ZZ/6\ZZ\)</html>

I did experiments again, and now I can confirm that `Zn` shows

```
\Boldùëç/6\Boldùëç
```
and `print(html(Zn))` shows

```
<html>\(\displaystyle \newcommand{\ZZ}{\Bold{Z}}\ZZ/6\ZZ\)</html>

with sage 9.6rc0. On the other hand, `ZZ` displays correctly and `print(html(ZZ))` shows

```

```

I don't know what happened with me before...

To reviewer: 

#33475 changed the way to get html(mathjax) output from the latex string of an object. It appends sage-defined macros that only appear in the latex string. But some macros use macros themselves. Hence the definitions of the latter macros are not included in the html output, causing the broken display. 

The patch redefines the code to add macro definitions recursively.
