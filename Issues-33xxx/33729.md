This

```
Zn=IntegerModRing(6)
Zn
```
gives `Ring of integers modulo 6`. But after `%display latex`, it gives

```
\Boldùëç/6\Boldùëç
```
This is caused by the changes in #33475 merged to sage 9.6.beta6.

<a id='comment:1'></a>Strange. It works well with me both with 9.6rc0 (on my desktop) and 9.5 (on Cocalc).

With 9.6rc0, what do you get from `print(html(Zn))`? I get

```
<html>\(\displaystyle \newcommand{\ZZ}{\Bold{Z}}\ZZ/6\ZZ\)</html>
