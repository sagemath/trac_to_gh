Use `parent(a)` rather than `a.parent()`
to accommodate floats, ints, etc.

This fixes yet another issue with conversions
from symbolic expression to balls,
reported by Markus Wageringel at #32871.

In Sage 9.5.beta7:

```
sage: a = acos(float(1/4) * sqrt(int(5)))
sage: CBF(a)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute 'parent'
```

With the fix in this ticket:

```
sage: CBF(acos(float(1/4) * sqrt(int(5))))
[0.97759655064526...]
```
