`EllipticCurve_number_field` has a `.division_field()` method to compute the smallest field of definition of `E[ℓ]` for primes `ℓ`.

This patch generalizes the `.division_field()` method to finite fields, where the same algorithm works with minor adaptions.

The only nontrivial changes are in this commit: https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=731011c1599e5bc3fd7e27438d9bd3e6d63bdda7
