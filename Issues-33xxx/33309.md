Sage documentation (website) is currently buggy in many ways.

I tried to fix various defects I noticed, including

- links in navigation bar
- index page, which is now in single column
- sage logo link always goes to the sagemath homepage
- `class` names now look ragged right
- long `Bases` for classes now horizontally scrolled 
- updated `sage` theme based on the latest `classic` theme of Sphinx
- renamed `sage` theme to `sage-classic` theme (in anticipation of alternative themes)
- remove unnecessary `sageref` theme; only use `sage` theme
- remove obsolete `python2.inv` hyperlinks database
- added a new `index.html` which is installed right into the root directory `SAGE_DOC`.
- adjusted colors to increase contrast among elements
- documentation access from jupyter notebook (this undoes #33206)
- search box works (turned off Thebe)

As noted in the last item above, I turned off Thebe here. Work on reviving Thebe will continue in #33320 (perhaps very slowly).

To cleanly build the new documentation, try

```
$ make doc-uninstall && make doc-html && make doc-pdf
```

I agree that the sage theme looks old. But perhaps it has merits in that it is almost the basic theme officially provided by Sphinx.

Replacing the same theme with a theme not based on the basic theme would be a work on another level. Currently Sage doc build is entangled with the structure of the basic theme. So definitely it is not to be done here.

Eventually it would be good that we could choose at build time among alternative themes.

This is because Sphinx does not see maths in the page and not include MathJax (to save loading time). My solution was to add <code>:math:\`.\`</code> somewhere in the page. It seem this has to be done for the afflicted pages individually. So this is not to be done here.

In anticipation of an alternative theme (perhaps based on `furo`) that may replace or live side by side with the current `sage` theme, we can rename the `sage` theme to `sage-classic` theme (since it is customized from the `classic` theme) in this ticket. Then later we may add `sage-furo` theme in another ticket. Okay?

Probably on another ticket, we should also fix `src/doc/common/update-python-inv.sh` to not use Python 2 anymore.

Would it be convenient to have a small index page at the root? The index page may contain the page listing all sage documentation, like

https://doc.sagemath.org/index.html

Really, we may use the source file of that page. Where is it?

I created the root `index.html` file based on the source file of https://doc.sagemath.org/index.html. But unlike the original, our root `index.html` file is a simple static html file edited by hand.

Here from the above created link all the html and pdf language links do not work, i.e. for example the `English` html link gives

```
doc/html/en is not a file

I don't understand. Did you build the doc using the latest commit? Or copy pasted from the above diff?

For me, for example, The "English" link lists files in `html/en` as it is supposed to do.

For a new branch `git trac fetch 33309` and then `git merge FETCH_HEAD`. To build `make doc-clean doc-uninstall` and then `make doc-pdf`.

I'm not an expert on this but I think for this to work from the notebook there needs to be an `index.html` file under each  language that contains links to docs for that language. Things work locally but not from the notebook.

I didn't think about it at the time but one could keep the language names on the `local/share/doc/sage/index.html` page but remove there link capabilities. The language names do not need to be links since everything else appears on the `index.html`.

This ticket might be the first one to encounter with the new policy introduced recently. Namely, the ticket authors now have responsibility of resolving conflicts with the branch of the release manager. This seems so from the generated comment reporting the merge conflict above.

There's no new policy; whenever the release manager encountered a merge conflict, the ticket was set back to "needs_work".

What is new is that the updated release manager scripts now provide some information regarding the conflict. Ticket authors can choose whether to address it when this comes in, or when the next beta becomes available.

I was aware of the update in the release manager scripts. 

I thought that previously, the merge conflict notices that I received from the release manager were always against the latest new beta, not against with the release manager's current branch that I don't have access to. But apparently I thought wrong.

If the author chooses to address it right away, is there an easy way to find out which ticket in the long list of the tickets has merge conflict with the present ticket? For me, it was tedious work to find this out, without access to the release manager's branch.
