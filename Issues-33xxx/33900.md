Previously, the generic discrete log function wouldn't ever use Pollard's rho. From what I can tell, no generic Pohlig-Hellman implementation existed which used Pollard's rho.

Additionally, discrete log functions did not seem to properly use the custom operation arguments.

Thanks for the contribution!

One first comment: The `use_rho` keyword argument should be replaced by an `algorithm` argument (with options `"bsgs"`/`"rho"` and a reasonable default choice among these), as is standard practice throughout most of the Sage library. This makes sure the interface doesn't get awkward if someone wants to add another algorithm option later.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:11'>Comment 11:</a>\nThanks. Some more comments:\n\n- There's a spurious whitespace change in `build/bin/sage-bootstrap-python`.\n- Your `ValueError(\"unkown algorithm\")` contains a typo (\"unkown\" -> \"unknown\").\n- That same `ValueError` is immediately caught by the function and results in an incorrect \"no discrete log\" error.\n- The logic here:\n\n```python\n    mult = op if op is not None else [add, mul][operation in multiplication_names]\n    power = [mul, pow][operation in multiplication_names]\n    if(op is not None):\n        power = lambda x, y: multiple(x, y, operation=operation, identity=identity, inverse=inverse, op=op)\n    if ord is None:\n        if operation in multiplication_names:\n            mult = mul\n            power = pow\n            try:\n                ord = base.multiplicative_order()\n            except Exception:\n                ord = base.order()\n        elif operation in addition_names:\n            mult = add\n            power = mul\n```\nis weird. First, it should probably throw an error if `operation` is neither in `addition_names` nor in `multiplication_names`. Second, if `operation` is given but `ord` is not, this sets both `mult` and `power` twice (to the same value). Third, coding style: `if(foo):` should be `if foo:` in Python.

Thanks. Some more comments:

- There's a spurious whitespace change in `build/bin/sage-bootstrap-python`.
- Your `ValueError("unkown algorithm")` contains a typo ("unkown" -> "unknown").
- That same `ValueError` is immediately caught by the function and results in an incorrect "no discrete log" error.
- The logic here:

```python
    mult = op if op is not None else [add, mul][operation in multiplication_names]
    power = [mul, pow][operation in multiplication_names]
    if(op is not None):
        power = lambda x, y: multiple(x, y, operation=operation, identity=identity, inverse=inverse, op=op)
    if ord is None:
        if operation in multiplication_names:
            mult = mul
            power = pow
            try:
                ord = base.multiplicative_order()
            except Exception:
                ord = base.order()
        elif operation in addition_names:
            mult = add
            power = mul
```
is weird. First, it should probably throw an error if `operation` is neither in `addition_names` nor in `multiplication_names`. Second, if `operation` is given but `ord` is not, this sets both `mult` and `power` twice (to the same value). Third, coding style: `if(foo):` should be `if foo:` in Python. Fourth, you use an `if` to set `power`, but the ternary `x if y else z` to set `mult`; this can be streamlined into a single `if`.

- This should probably say "in *the* group":

```diff
+    - ``op()`` - function of 2 arguments ``x``, ``y`` returning ``x*y`` in group
```

Sorry for the long silence. What's still missing are tests for the new `algorithm` flag: I guess you can just copy some of the existing tests and show that they also work if you pass `algorithm='rho'`.

Once that's done, I think this can be merged — while there are still plenty of things I would change in that file, it's certainly better than before.

I'm not sure either what's the preferred way of dealing with this, but I think setting it back to "needs work" for now won't hurt.
(Adding changes to a ticket that is in "positive review" state is discouraged because it makes it difficult to tell which version of the branch gets merged in the end.)

What's the bug you found? Does it break things that used to work previously?

it has to do with the stop early CRT optimization.

`CRT_list(l, [pi**ri for pi, ri in f[:len(l)]])`

Since we stop before computing the latter part of `l`, we need to cut off the moduli early as well. The problem is that `l` is initialized with its full length, so this list slicing doesn't do anything. If this part of code got hit then some of the CRT relations would be wrong (unless 0 was the correct result for all remaining factors). The solution is simple, just slice `l` at the number of factors that have been checked.

Since this optimization wasn't in there before, this does break something that used to work.

Here's an example that still fails:

```sage
discrete_log(Mod(0,4), Mod(2,4), 4, operation='+', algorithm='lambda')
```

From a quick glance it looks like the upper bounds passed to `discrete_log_lambda` might be off by one.

You may want to add the following test to the function to catch things like this in the future:

I think this change probably should be made, because the prior behavior of failing is certainly incorrect.\n\nthe lambda implementation, however, isn't the only thing mistreating the bound inclusivity/exclusivity. with that change made, `discrete_log(Mod(0,4), Mod(2,4), 4, operation='+', algorithm='lambda')` returns 2. this is valid, but not the smallest. this doesn't happen with bsgs because bsgs is guaranteed to find the smallest log in the range. one solution is to mod by pi after getting a result from lambda, but the far cleaner solution is to subtract 1 from temp_bound so that a tighter but still correct bound is passed. these are the changes I'm pushing now.",

<a id='comment:32'>Comment 32:</a>
there seems to be a bug in the lambda algorithm.

notice that the second pass through lambda is the one which fails to find a logarithm. the correct logarithm for that case is 0, and the bounds passed are (0, 2). the logarithm 0 should be found within this range, but it is not. this is incorrect behavior.

the reason for this (I think) is that the pollard lambda algorithm requires inclusive bounds to be sent, but the implementation checks that `c-d<ub` (note the strict comparison) before returning. when this comparison is changed to not be strict, 2 is returned. this is a correct logarithm, albeit not the smallest. I think this change probably should be made, because the prior behavior of failing is certainly incorrect.

the lambda implementation, however, isn't the only thing mistreating the bound inclusivity/exclusivity. with that change made, `discrete_log(Mod(0,4), Mod(2,4), 4, operation='+', algorithm='lambda')` returns 2. this is valid, but not the smallest. this doesn't happen with bsgs because bsgs is guaranteed to find the smallest log in the range. one solution is to mod by pi after getting a result from lambda, but the far cleaner solution is to subtract 1 from temp_bound so that a tighter but still correct bound is passed. these are the changes I'm pushing now.

Looks good, thank you for all the work.

Now we just need to avoid the doctest failures when `lambda` fails randomly. Maybe like this?

You may also want to consider adding yourself to the list of authors for the `discrete_log` function.
