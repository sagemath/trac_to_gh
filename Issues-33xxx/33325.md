CC:  @kwankyu @vbraun @dimpase @jhpalmieri

In Sage 9.5,

```
sage: %time s = display(1)
1
CPU times: user 677 ms, sys: 31.1 ms, total: 708 ms
Wall time: 708 ms
```

In other words, the first object you display in a Sage session takes almost a second.  This is new since 9.4 (I don't have 9.5 betas to check against).

Did Sage startup time decrease accordingly?

Recent changes in lazy imports might cause such a shift.

I played around with `strace` for a bit and the delay does seem to be caused by module imports. Indeed, looking at `sys.modules` supports this hypothesis:

```sage
sage: ms1 = set(sys.modules.keys())
sage: 5  # slow
5
sage: ms2 = set(sys.modules.keys())
sage: sorted({m.split('.')[0] for m in ms2 - ms1})
['PIL',
 '_elementtree',
 'cffi',
 'cycler',
 'dateutil',
 'defusedxml',
 'kiwisolver',
 'matplotlib',
 'mpl_toolkits',
 'numpy',
 'packaging',
 'pyexpat',
 'pyparsing',
 'secrets',
 'xml']
```

I don't think there's a good reason why displaying a simple object should have to load all these modules, so this does seem to qualify as a defect.

What's also kind of strange is that `5` is slow, but `print(5)` is fast.
