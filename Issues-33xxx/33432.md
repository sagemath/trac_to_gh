Mean, median and mode are now deprecated by #29662. E.g.:

```
>median([1,2,3])
2
:1: DeprecationWarning: sage.stats.basic_stats.median is deprecated; use numpy.median or numpy.nanmedian instead
See https://trac.sagemath.org/29662 for details.
```

But these basic functions should have some default functionality. It seems strange to not have a top-level "mean" or "median" function, given all of the other esoteric top-level functions.

The idea is to provide `mean` and `median` commands with functionality at least of the deprecated commands.

Really? It is already complicated enough to teach sagemath. To my mind having an extra level of noise is not helping. `mean` and `median` are ought to be elementary functions, likely to be presented in the first course. If these functions are to be kept the warning is more harmful than useful.

I am in favour of removing the warnings for `mean`, `median` (and possibly `variance` and `std`) and keep these functions roughly as they are. If the input data is a `numpy` array the code calls the correct numpy method.

Yes.

See also [this comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/29662#comment:7); it's unfortunate that it sounds like it might be too hard to overload those e.g. mean to work with Sage integers if/when Python 3.8+ becomes default.

That by itself does not sound like a good plan. There's still the disservice to learners: A Sage-specific dead end with limited functionality and no perspective.

How about this:

- In the short term, transform `sage.stats.basic_stats` to a module that provides the same API as the built-in `statistics` module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html).

- In the long term, work with the Python community so that the built-in `statistics` module can handle collections with a mix of types, including Sage's numbers and other objects.

But someone would have to work on it.

This is hitting #28234

The dilemma remains
- make `numerator`/`denominator` attributes instead of methods to be compatible with Python `numbers.Rational`
- convince Python dev that `numerator()`/`denominator()` should be equally supported on the python side (which has already been tried by Jeroen in the past)
- continue being orthogonal to Python

Yes, I know, this is something to address for the "long term plan".

But it does not block work for the "short term plan".

So the plan is to also import the other functions from the `sage.stats.statisics` module into the global namespace after the deprecation period?

Nothing is fixed yet. We could already pull all the contents of `sage.stats.statistics` into the global namespace but `mode` (whose specification conflicts with `stats.basic_stats.mode`). The deprecations have to stay because of the change of behaviour
- `mode` -> `multimode` (`mode` becomes something else)
- `std` -> `stdev` and `pstdev` (depending on the value of `bias`)
- `variance` -> `variance` and `pvariance` (depending on the value of `bias`)

To my mind, I think it is better to have them as `statistics.mean`, `statistics.median`, etc rather than in the global namespace. But that is a personal taste.

The original idea of this ticket is to have the basic stats command readily available from the global namespace.
