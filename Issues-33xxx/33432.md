Mean, median and mode are now deprecated by #29662. E.g.:

```
>median([1,2,3])
2
:1: DeprecationWarning: sage.stats.basic_stats.median is deprecated; use numpy.median or numpy.nanmedian instead
See https://trac.sagemath.org/29662 for details.
```

But these basic functions should have some default functionality. It seems strange to not have a top-level "mean" or "median" function, given all of the other esoteric top-level functions.

The idea is to provide `mean` and `median` commands with functionality at least of the deprecated commands.

Really? It is already complicated enough to teach sagemath. To my mind having an extra level of noise is not helping. `mean` and `median` are ought to be elementary functions, likely to be presented in the first course. If these functions are to be kept the warning is more harmful than useful.

I am in favour of removing the warnings for `mean`, `median` (and possibly `variance` and `std`) and keep these functions roughly as they are. If the input data is a `numpy` array the code calls the correct numpy method.

Yes.

See also [this comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/29662#comment:7); it's unfortunate that it sounds like it might be too hard to overload those e.g. mean to work with Sage integers if/when Python 3.8+ becomes default.

Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A14):
> I am in favour of removing the warnings for `mean`, `median` (and possibly `variance` and `std`) and keep these functions roughly as they are.

That by itself does not sound like a good plan. There's still the disservice to learners: A Sage-specific dead end with limited functionality and no perspective.

How about this:

- In the short term, transform `sage.stats.basic_stats` to a module that provides the same API as the built-in `statistics` module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html).

- In the long term, work with the Python community so that the built-in `statistics` module can handle collections with a mix of types, including Sage's numbers and other objects.

But someone would have to work on it.

The dilemma remains
- make `numerator`/`denominator` attributes instead of methods to be compatible with Python `numbers.Rational`
- convince Python dev that `numerator()`/`denominator()` should be equally supported on the python side (which has already been tried by Jeroen in the past)
- continue being orthogonal to Python

Nothing is fixed yet. We could already pull all the contents of `sage.stats.statistics` into the global namespace but `mode` (whose specification conflicts with `stats.basic_stats.mode`). The deprecations have to stay because of the change of behaviour
- `mode` -> `multimode` (`mode` becomes something else)
- `std` -> `stdev` and `pstdev` (depending on the value of `bias`)
- `variance` -> `variance` and `pvariance` (depending on the value of `bias`)

To my mind, I think it is better to have them as `statistics.mean`, `statistics.median`, etc rather than in the global namespace. But that is a personal taste.
