When preparing a portability report such as https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/GOGWk66zaCQ/m/dBQww8WNAAAJ, I have found that the output of `tox.yml` has gotten too big to be comfortably inspected in one go. 
So we split out everything macOS into a separate workflow.

Preparation for #33062 and #32570


Depends on #34017

Moreover, with a bit of refactoring there doesn't seem to general obstacles why you cannot have the same matrix running across different os.

I feel like it would be helpful to have a general big picture for how to structure the workflows instead of moving them back and forth in the coming months.
