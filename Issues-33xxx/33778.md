I'm not sure what the goal of this ticket is. (1) Stop distributing `sagetex` with Sage? (2) Advertise `texsurgery` in our documentation instead of `sagetex`? (3) Is there any reason to distribute `texsurgery` with Sage?

Parts of `texsurgery` seem a little clunkier: the command-line version works like

```
texsurgery input_file.tex -o output_file.tex
```
and it's a little annoying to have to create a second TeX file. Can it all be automated using `latexmk`, the way `sagetex` can?

Maybe this ticket should do (2), or at least advertise `texsurgery` in addition to `sagetex`. Maybe also (3), if (3) is a good idea. Then a later ticket could remove `sagetex` as a standard package.

Since it is pip installable, do we really need to add it? 

`sage -pip install texsurgery` should just work, right?

Suggestions for improvement are more than welcome.

`latexmk` automation would be great: a version of https://mirrors.rit.edu/CTAN/support/latexmk/example_rcfiles/pythontex-latexmkrc (see also https://ctan.org/tex-archive/support/latexmk/example_rcfiles). Being able to use a single command `latexmk FILE` is very handy, and it's not clear to me how to do this with `texsurgery`.

> Maybe this ticket should do (2), or at least advertise `texsurgery` in addition to `sagetex`. Maybe also (3), if (3) is a good idea. Then a later ticket could remove `sagetex` as a standard package.

Advertising in addition seems fine.  Certainly something that supports multiple kernels in a single document (including R, Julia?) would be pretty cool.  As optional package, seems reasonable.

Possible issues with anything beyond that, collated here for convenience, not because this ticket is necessarily about deprecating `sagetex`:
* There seem to be a fairly large number of people who use `sagetex` (based on help requests as well as its direct support in !TeXShop), so there would probably need to be some kind of migration tool if we were to dump it for some reason.  
* It's also not clear whether it supports easy graphics generation; there is an allusion to graphics, but the documentation seems to still be pretty rudimentary (after all, still not at release 1.0).  If we recommend it above `sagetex` sometime, it would be reasonable to ask for essentially the same ease of use.
* Does !TeXShop support this?  I can't find anything in a quick search.

Ideally, one would write LaTeX macros (or a `sagetex` document class) which would take input with our SageTeX macros and use `texsurgery` behind the curtains.
