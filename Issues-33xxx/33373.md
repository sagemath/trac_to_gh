When evaluating a univariate polynomial, it correctly takes the parent of the input into account:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(2^4)
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(k)
sage: f = R(1)
sage: S.<y> = PolynomialRing(k)
sage: f(y).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Finite Field in a of size 2^4
```
Multivariate polynomials do not:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(2^4)
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(k, 1)
sage: f = R(1)
sage: S.<y> = PolynomialRing(k, 1)
sage: f(y).parent()
Finite Field in a of size 2^4
```
