```
Example context:
- `sys.prefix = /usr` (used for system python packages)
- sagelib is in a different location

Say `$SAGE_LIB` contains the sage python library and `$SAGE_BIN` contains the scripts. I can run this sagelib by setting

```
$ export PATH=$SAGE_BIN:$PATH
$ export PYTHONPATH=$SAGE_LIB
```
which will pick this sagelib (overriding a system sagelib if installed, both in scripts and python packages).

However, there are a few issues with this, since:
a. `sage-env` uses `sage-venv-config` to `SAGE_VENV` to `sys.prefix`
b. there are a few places where it is assumed that the sage scripts live in `SAGE_VENV/bin`, thus breaking stuff.
c. in particular `sage-env` itself prepends `SAGE_VENV/bin` to `PATH`.

Problem 1: If I don't have any system sage installed in `/usr/bin/sage`. This causes a doctest failure (#33624, very easy fix).

Problem 2: If I have a system sage installed in `/usr/bin/sage` but it is a different version than the one I'm trying to run. This causes trouble because after `sage-env` prepends PATH with `SAGE_VENV/bin` the `sage` script in `SAGE_BIN` will be overrided (for example, doctesting `src/sage/doctest/test.py` causes trouble).

Other problems? Maybe (untested)
a. #33627 - `sage.doctest.control` uses `SAGE_VENV/bin/sage-gdb-commands` so it won't work
b. `sage.features` looks for binaries in `SAGE_VENV/bin` 
c. `sage.repl.ipython_kernel.install` uses `SAGE_VENV/bin/sage` when configuring jupyter kernel so it seems it will end up running the system sage.

<a id='comment:1'></a>For problem 2 (`sage-env` messes PATH), this could be solved by setting `SAGE_VENV=` However, the way this is set in `sage-venv-config` makes it impossible.

If the line `from sys import config as SAGE_VENV` is moved before `from sage_conf import *`, then the value of `SAGE_VENV` could be overrided there.

I'm not sure that's really useful but it's harmless if unused.

Hmmm... not really. It seems to be a list of **source files**:

 PackagePath('bin/sage-eval'),

 PackagePath('bin/sage-grep')]
```
This is in my system install of sagemath, which was installed using `--install-scripts=/usr/lib/sagemath/bin`, but there's no info.

I assume importlib.metadata obtains the info from `/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sagemath_standard-9.5-py3.10.egg-info/` but a quick `grep -r` shows that there's nothing in there that reveals the `/usr/lib/sagemath/bin` path.

One easy way to obtain the path to the scripts directory would be as `dirname $SELF` in the main `sage` script. At least for setting `PATH` that would be better than using `$SAGE_VENV/bin` as is currently done.

However, there doesn't seem to be any way to make this work when using sage as a python module. Unless this is saved somewhere in the sage package or in the sagemath_standard egg-info at install time.

TIL that, since there's no indication anywhere that `--install-scripts` is legacy/deprecated/unsupported:

```
$ python setup.py install --help
...
  --install-scripts   installation directory for Python scripts
...
```
What about `--exec-prefix`, is that also deprecated? (btw, is `--exec-prefix` supported in a "normal" installation of sage-the-distribution using `./configure`, etc.?)

The main reason I'm using `--install-scripts` is because sagelib installs a lot of scripts which don't seem necessary in PATH. I prefer to "hide" them and just have one symlink to the main `sage` script. In a "normal" installation of sage this is not an issue because everything is already "hidden" in SAGE_ROOT and the only thing exposed is the symlink to `sage`.

Maybe these non-user scripts can be placed in a different location. I don't know if there's a standard location for this purpose. Other packages that install "hidden" binaries, e.g. git installs a bunch of binaries in `/usr/libexec/git-core/`, maxima installs binaries in `/usr/lib/maxima/VERSION/...`, etc.

Would it be outrageous to place them at `.../sage/ext_data/script/` or something like that? The advantage is that they would be tied together with the corresponding python modules.

All of `setup.py install` is deprecated

No, this is not passed on to any of the packages that sage-the-distribution installs.

The option is there because of the (unused) `build/make/Makefile-auto.am`.

Yes, at least some of these have a "libexec" flavor.

> I don't know if there's a standard location for this purpose. 


I'm not aware of one in Python packaging.

`ext_data` is also on its way out (see #31306), but yes, some of this can be moved to package_data somewhere.

See #33627 for a step in this direction
