We change the `bootstrap` scripts so that they invoke `build/bin/sage-package` directly instead of going through the `SAGE_ROOT/sage` script.

This is faster and also more robust because it separates build phases better by eliminating the (unnecessary) use of `configure`-generated files such as `src/bin/sage-src-env-config`.

We also move the generation of `src/doc/en/reference/repl/options.txt` (by calling `sage -advanced`) from bootstrap time to `src/doc/Makefile`. The information displayed there depends on what packages are installed, so running it at bootstrap time was not correct.
