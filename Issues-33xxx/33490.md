See #33309 for reference. I'm sure this worked at one time. The documentation link from the jupyter notebook is http://localhost:8888/kernelspecs/sagemath/doc/html/en/index.html. At the top of this page there is

```
This is documentation for Sage 9.6.beta4. Documentations in other languages are available `here`.
``` 
where `here` points to `<a href="../../index.html">here</a>` which cannot now be accessed. If `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/index.html` is loaded in a browser then the `here` link is fine. The issue arises when accessing the documentation from the jupyter notebook.

You are right it does now work here. I'm investigation since the link also was not working on sage-on-gentoo. The sage-on-gentoo issue has been corrected. I did nothing to vanilla but maybe there was something with the sage-on-gentoo install that affected the vanilla result. I hopefully will resolve this later today.

No this can't be related to the sage-on-gentoo issue. See https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/683 for reference to document I'm not fantasizing about this. I can't imagine what would have caused this.

Sometimes browser cache causes a problem.
