You are right it does now work here. I'm investigation since the link also was not working on sage-on-gentoo. The sage-on-gentoo issue has been corrected. I did nothing to vanilla but maybe there was something with the sage-on-gentoo install that affected the vanilla result. I hopefully will resolve this later today.
