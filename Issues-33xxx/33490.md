You are right it does now work here. I'm investigation since the link also was not working on sage-on-gentoo. The sage-on-gentoo issue has been corrected. I did nothing to vanilla but maybe there was something with the sage-on-gentoo install that affected the vanilla result. I hopefully will resolve this later today.

No this can't be related to the sage-on-gentoo issue. See https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/683 for reference to document I'm not fantasizing about this. I can't imagine what would have caused this.
