This breaks `ubuntu-trusty` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/4588276245?check_suite_focus=true) and `ubuntu-xenial` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/4588276320?check_suite_focus=true)

```
  [numpy-1.21.5]         raise RuntimeError(
  [numpy-1.21.5]     RuntimeError: Broken toolchain: cannot link a simple C++ program. note: A compiler with support for C++11 language features is required.
  [numpy-1.21.5]     Building wheel for numpy (pyproject.toml): finished with status 'error'
```

So this update won't make it into Sage 9.5.
