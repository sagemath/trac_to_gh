As an overarching issue, I don't understand why so many regular expressions are defined at the top level in `parsing.py`. For example, `optional_regex` is used just once in the file, so why not define it and `re.compile` it right before it's used? I tried moving that definition inside the function `parse_optional_tags` and did some timing with `./sage -tp src/sage/misc`: there was no difference from before the change to after.

Anyway, for this ticket, should we move `glpk_simplex_warning_regex` etc. to the method `do_fixup`? Again, I see no changes in the timing, although I have only run very limited tests.
