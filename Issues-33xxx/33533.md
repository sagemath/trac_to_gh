The update to 6.4.x (https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html) brings some improvements to webpdf exports.

6.4.x (and main as of 2022-03) still supports python 3.7, as needed for Sage 9.6

There is a new dependency, `beautifulsoup4`. We convert the existing pip package to a standard normal package.
- https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/blob/main/setup.py#L214


The new package [Pyppeteer](https://github.com/pyppeteer/pyppeteer) is needed for [webpdf exports](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#webpdf) of Jupyter notebooks.

pyppeteer has a number of new dependencies, so for now we only add it as a pip package.
