On Sage-9.5 I build Sage like this and it worked on everybody else's computers (under ubuntu 20.04 on x86_64):

```
export SAGE_FAT_BINARY="yes"
export SAGE_INSTALL_GCC="no"
cd sage
make configure
./configure
make
```

See https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc-docker/blob/master/scripts/install_sage.sh

I had thousands of downloads and zero complaints.

With Sage-9.6, the binaries are broken (yet again), so I must continue to ship sage-9.5 to my users of cocalc-docker until this is fixed.

Support for SAGE_FAT_BINARY is a critical piece of functionality for Sage, which [appears 22 times in the codebase](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/search?q=sage_fat_binary).

Evidently, [I created SAGE_FAT_BINARY in the first place 13 years ago](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/commit/80bda10cfc3612a5fc570dd8b6d50de553f44183), and I think it's a key piece of Sage's functionality.

I'm also now also a "binary-providing downstream developer" and need this to work in order to provide binaries.
