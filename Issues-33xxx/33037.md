Portions of namespace packages can be installed in separate locations. 

Hence, the variable `sage.env.SAGE_LIB` is no longer meaningful.

Instead, we should make use of the `__path__` attribute of packages, https://python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/import.html#module-path, which in the case of namespace packages is an iterable.

- Use of `SAGE_LIB` in `src/sage/misc/lazy_import_cache.py` can possibly be removed after #33308

- #33407 `sage -t --all-installed`
- #33821 Remove use of `SAGE_LIB` in `sage.misc`
- #33137 `sage.env.sage_include_directories`: Don't use `distutils` and `SAGE_LIB`

`SAGE_EXTCODE` should be replaced by using `importlib.resources` (more precisely, the backport package `importlib-resources`). Version 5.9.0 can do `as_file` with directories (https://importlib-resources.readthedocs.io/en/latest/history.html#v5-9-0)


Depends on #31306

SAGE_EXTCODE = var("SAGE_EXTCODE", join(SAGE_LIB, "sage", "ext_data"))
