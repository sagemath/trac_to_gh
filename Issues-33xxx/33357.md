```
We have

```
sage: SP = SetPartitions(10, [4,3,2,1])
sage: SP.random_element()
{{1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}, {3, 6}, {9}, {10}}
```
This should not be the case. We provide a random sampling that appears to be fairly efficient and uniform.

We also improve the efficiently of the `__contains__` test and allow unsorted inputs for the block sizes.

I thought about this for a bit too. I don't see any harm in it, and it will likely improve the usability (or at least remove a surprise for a more casual user). I couldn't quite think of a reasonable scenario when passing things out of order would be considered a typo-type bug (if I have understood your comment correctly on sage-devel).
