`virtualenv` was updated in #32482, but apparently it was forgotten to add some of its dependencies. 

This only matters on systems without `tox`.

We upgrade `virtualenv` to the latest version, which only needs one extra package, `platformdirs`, and one upgrade of a dependency, `filelock`.

We use https://github.com/platformdirs/platformdirs/blob/main/CHANGES.rst#platformdirs-251-2022-02-19; the latest version changes the build system to `hatchling`, which we don't have yet.
