Implement the solid angle measure (the plane angle) of a two-dimensional cone, using the dot-product (trigonometry) formula. 

For example, the solid angle of the first orthant `solid_angle_simplicial_2d([[0,1],[1,0]])`
is 1/4.

Later we will add methods for three-dimensional and higher-dimensional cones.

If the input is in a symbolic ring, like `sqrt(18)` is, then the output should be in the same symbolic ring, I think, not the Symbolic Constants Subring.

Symbolic Constants Subring is the right choice when the inputs in an exact ring.

<a id='comment:30'></a>The parent of the result should only depend on the parent of the input, not the value of the input. So because `solid_angle_simplicial_2d(matrix([[0, sqrt(18)], [0, -sqrt(pi)]])` is the 0 of Symbolic Constants Subring, also `solid_angle_simplicial_2d(matrix([[0, sqrt(18)], [1, -sqrt(pi)]])` should return a value of Symbolic Constants Subring.
