It is very nice to have this feature in Sage; it is something that has been missing for a long time. Sorry for taking so long to get to reviewing it. I have some issues with the overall design that I would like to discuss:

- I think we should do the main computations lazily; that is only when the user asks for them such as computing the length of the resolution. This is a general Sage philosophy: a `Parent` should be quick to create (of course, this is not necessarily universal).

- Why are these classes in Cython files? The only thing that uses Cython is the `to_sage_resolution()`, which could go in the Singular interface file.

Some more trivial points:

- Use `_repr_` instead of `__repr__` as the former allows a user to use `rename()` on the object.
- I would have `FreeResolution_generic` inherit from `UniqueRepresentation` because we don't want to have to do the computations twice for the same ideal.

The `_latex_`, `_ascii_art_`, `_unicode_art_` can then use the ones from `chain_complex()` with the current one being something like `pp()`.

No. Just thank you for attention.  

> - I think we should do the main computations lazily; that is only when the user asks for them such as computing the length of the resolution. 

As you see, the gist of the code is to convert the resolution object computed by Singular to a Sage object as fast as possible and the Sage object contains detailed information (degrees(multi degrees) of generators of component modules and the length) about the resolution. By my experiments, the resolution computation is as fast as Macaulay2.

Then what do you mean by doing the computation lazily? For instance, the length is immediately available after the conversion. And I don't see anything to do lazily in this conversion.

#33953 is dependent on this ticket and requires fast resolution computation.

Indeed. I want to keep that in Cython, but moved to the interface file. I feel that is the more appropriate place for it.

This is what I mean: Do not ask Singular to do the computation until it is required by something the user wants to do. Now this can be improved by making the `_repr_()` not needing to compute the resolution.

A followup ticket would be to make the API for this play nicely with FP graded modules. I would likely want an object for those resolutions, but that will take a little bit of work to handle the potentially infinite length. I can likely modify what I did for the Hochschild complex for that.

Based on that, I would want to convert this to a subclass of `CategoryObject` instead of `SageObject` and have it live in the category of `ChainComplexes`.

What do you think?

> This is what I mean: Do not ask Singular to do the computation until it is required by something the user wants to do. Now this can be improved by making the `_repr_()` not needing to compute the resolution.

The lazy computation looks good to me.  

> Based on that, I would want to convert this to a subclass of `CategoryObject` instead of `SageObject` and have it live in the category of `ChainComplexes`. This shouldn't change much, but it does allow for the possibility of implementing maps or functors on free resolutions (mainly this would allow for computation of (left) derived functors). What do you think?

Okay. Feel free to modify the code for your needs, till the code pass the original doctests and run as fast as before.

Bikeshedding (nor do I really care that much): I am not sure I agree with calling it `generic` as it really doesn't work unless subclasses implement certain aspects. While instances can be created, I don't think that qualifies it to be generic.

That was not my takeaway from that discussion; nobody wanted to make a policy. Yet, I don't care too much about this file to insist.

Thank you for testing.

> I don't know if the difference in timings is statistically significant. Anyway, it seems negligible.

Using the numbers you gave, it less than 1% slower by comparing the means. So if this is something that is going to be called very frequently or in a tight loop, then we might want to care about it. Although I am fairly certain it will become even smaller on larger examples.

If everything is good with you, then you can set a positive review and I will try to review #33953.

Perhaps I learned somewhere that an abstract class defines interfaces, and a subclass provides implementations. A generic class provides common operations...

There isn't universal definitions of this IIRC. My understanding of Sage is a generic class is one that can do most functionality on its own, but lacks some specific features that subclasses can do. Consequently, anything that requires a subclass to implement even partial functionality should be considered an abstract class. Well, it is possible that the `FreeResolution_generic` will eventually become more of a generic class.

```
