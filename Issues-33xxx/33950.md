No. Just thank you for attention.  

> - I think we should do the main computations lazily; that is only when the user asks for them such as computing the length of the resolution. 

As you see, the gist of the code is to convert the resolution object computed by Singular to a Sage object as fast as possible and the Sage object contains detailed information (degrees(multi degrees) of generators of component modules and the length) about the resolution. By my experiments, the resolution computation is as fast as Macaulay2.

Then what do you mean by doing the computation lazily? For instance, the length is immediately available after the conversion. And I don't see anything to do lazily in this conversion.

#33953 is dependent on this ticket and requires fast resolution computation.

This is what I mean: Do not ask Singular to do the computation until it is required by something the user wants to do. Now this can be improved by making the `_repr_()` not needing to compute the resolution.

I was hoping to get to this today, but something unexpected came up.

The speed of the functions is not affected by being in the same Cython file. Now there will be some slight slowdown for converting the resolution class to a Python file (versus Cython), but since that is all of the boilerplate code that is called infrequently to only once (e.g., the `__getitem__`), this should be insignificant (i.e., nearly all of the time is spent computing the resolution). However, having it be a Python class will make maintenance and extensions easier in the long term.

Is there some tests I should use that are particularly good for timing purposes?

Okay.

Perhaps one or two tests are somewhere in my files. After you are done with your work, I can run the tests and report the result.

I made minor fixes in docstrings.

- The base class `FreeResolution_generic` seems generic rather than abstract.
- I prefer a spaced list than a tight list in INPUT section. From the discussion in sage-devel, I learned that I should respect whichever style an author uses. So I reverted my own change of an AUTHOR section.

Otherwise it looks good to me.

For performance, I tested with #33953. I got

Before your patch,

```

I don't know if the difference in timings is statistically significant. Anyway, it seems negligible.

Bikeshedding (nor do I really care that much): I am not sure I agree with calling it `generic` as it really doesn't work unless subclasses implement certain aspects. While instances can be created, I don't think that qualifies it to be generic.

> - I prefer a spaced list than a tight list in INPUT section. From the discussion in sage-devel, I learned that I should respect whichever style an author uses. So I reverted my own change of an AUTHOR section.

That was not my takeaway from that discussion; nobody wanted to make a policy. Yet, I don't care too much about this file to insist.

Thank you for testing.

> I don't know if the difference in timings is statistically significant. Anyway, it seems negligible.

Using the numbers you gave, it less than 1% slower by comparing the means. So if this is something that is going to be called very frequently or in a tight loop, then we might want to care about it. Although I am fairly certain it will become even smaller on larger examples.

If everything is good with you, then you can set a positive review and I will try to review #33953.

There isn't universal definitions of this IIRC. My understanding of Sage is a generic class is one that can do most functionality on its own, but lacks some specific features that subclasses can do. Consequently, anything that requires a subclass to implement even partial functionality should be considered an abstract class. Well, it is possible that the `FreeResolution_generic` will eventually become more of a generic class. I feel that calling it a generic class is slightly misleading, but I don't think it is so important here.

You either need to update `build/pkgs/sage_docbuild/src/sage_docbuild/conf.py` with the unicode symbol

```
    \DeclareUnicodeCharacter{2295}{\ensuremath{\oplus}}
```
or use ⨁ (2A01) instead of ⊕ (2295).

Thanks. This ⨁ (2A01) looks too big on my terminal.
