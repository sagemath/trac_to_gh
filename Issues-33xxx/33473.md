This retroactively affects sage-9.5, meaning sage-9.5 used to build ok in my system but now that system numpy has been upgraded to 1.22 it breaks. This is using the standard tarball, unpatched, as long as system python is used and numpy 1.22 happens to be installed in the system when sage is build.

NOTE: this is NOT trying to use system numpy. Sage builds and installs its own numpy (1.21) but headers for the system numpy (1.22) get incorrectly mixed up when building sagelib.


The symptom is that any sage module that uses `cimport numpy` will fail to load, making sage almost unusable, e.g.:

```
sage: import sage.rings.polynomial.real_roots
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: numpy.ndarray size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject
```

Background:
- numpy 1.21 and numpy 1.22 are ABI incompatible (ndarray changed size)
- building sagelib needs to know location of include files:
  - for python: since I'm using system python, this is a system include dir, here `/usr/include/python3.10`
  - for numpy: since numpy is bundled with sage, this is a dir in the venv, here `/home/tornaria/src/sage/sage-9.5/local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.10/lib/python3.10/site-packages/numpy/core/include`
- my system numpy (1.22) has its own headers installed in `/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/numpy/core/include` but there's also a symlink `/usr/include/python3.10/numpy -> ../../lib/python3.10/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy`.
- in the CC command line the python include location (in the system) is before the numpy include location (in the venv)
- since the system python contains the system numpy, all numpy headers will be included from system and not from the venv, triggering the incompatibility.

NOTE: the symlink `/usr/include/python3.10/numpy` is not shipped by numpy itself, but it seems some distros add it. I'm using void linux, which has it, but at least debian also has it (see https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/amd64/python3-numpy/filelist)

The solution should be changing the order of the include locations so that the numpy location comes before the python location.

It seems scipy may also be affected by this:

```
$ grep -l 'usr.*numpy.*\.h' logs/pkgs/*
logs/pkgs/sagelib-9.6.beta3.log
logs/pkgs/scipy-1.7.3.log

Indeed

```

we see that scipy also uses some incorrect headers (the warning is unrelated).

<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

For sagelib, the includes are determined by

```
sage: sage.env.sage_include_directories()
['/home/tornaria/src/sage/sage-9.6.beta3/local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.10/lib/python3.10/site-packages',
 '/usr/include/python3.10',
 '/home/tornaria/src/sage/sage-9.6.beta3/local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.10/lib/python3.10/site-packages/numpy/core/include']
```

I think modifying this function so that the numpy include location comes before the system python include location should fix the issue.

As for scipy, it seems the issue happens in module `scipy.spatial` as in:

```
sage: import scipy.spatial
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: numpy.ndarray size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject

Thanks.

I've reported this as a possible bug in the `numpy` package in void linux (https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/issues/36062), to try to get an opinion on the distro side.

We could try to get the scipy patch upstreamed.

BTW, I think eventually `distutils.sysconfig.get_python_inc()` should be changed to `sysconfig.get_config_var("INCLUDEPY")` since `distutils` is deprecated but `sysconfig` doesn't have a function `get_python_inc()`.

For the record:
- numpy maintainer in void linux acknowledged this as a package bug and it's already fixed (https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/issues/36062)
- debian already had a bug for this filed in october 2021, maintainer is not sure this is a bug, I've added an explanation of how this is expected to break sage 9.5 at some point (atm debian unstable has numpy-1.21, but 1.22 is already in experimental and that's the cue to break sage 9.5) https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=998084#17
- indeed it seems setuptools adds the python include location to the compiler command line, in fact with the following comment in setuptools/_distutils/command/build_ext.py:

```
        # Put the Python "system" include dir at the end, so that
        # any local include dirs take precedence.
```
