Hello all,

I am creating this ticket to add a new S-box to the S-boxes package. More precisely, I aim at adding the S-box of a new block cipher named WARP to `src/sage/crypto/sboxes.py`.

The lookup table of this S-box, which is the same as `Midori_Sb0`'s S-box, is as follows:

``
[0xc,0xa,0xd,0x3,0xe,0xb,0xf,0x7,0x8,0x9,0x1,0x5,0x0,0x2,0x4,0x6]
``

Keywords: **S-box**

Author: **Hosein Hadipour**

Component: **PLEASE CHANGE**

Replying to [@hadipourh](#comment:2):

To this end, it is sufficient to add the following command in `src/sage/crypto/sboxes.py`, e.g., between lines 1574-1575:

```
WARP = Midori_Sb0
```

Moreover, modify line 95 as follows:

```
- Midori_Sb0 (MANTIS, CRAFT, WARP), Midori_Sb1 ([BBISHAR2015]_)
```
