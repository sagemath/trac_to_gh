```
In `graphs/graphs.py`, the degeneracy of a graph is defined in terms of its
k-cores. The documentation says

```
   The *degeneracy* of a graph `G`, usually denoted `\delta^*(G)`, is the
   smallest integer `k` such that the graph `G` can be reduced to the
   empty graph by iteratively removing vertices of degree `\leq k`.
   Equivalently, `\delta^*(G)=k` if `k` is the smallest integer such that
   the `k`-core of `G` is empty.
```
The last statement is incorrect.
According to the definitions, the degeneracy of a graph is `k-1` (not `k`) if
`k` is the smallest integer such that the `k`-core of `G` is empty.

This ticket corrects that.

Thanks for fixing this.  Please make two additional minor edits:
1. I think the line is now more than 80 characters, so the line break should be before "that", instead of after.

2. Please change `\delta^*(G)=k-1` to `\delta^*(G) = k - 1`.  (With this additional space, I think the line break will need to come before "such".)

It will be good to get this minor documentation error corrected, and I can't see how it could possibly affect any doctests, so I hope this will make it into 9.6.
