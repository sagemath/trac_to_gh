```
In `graphs/graphs.py`, the degeneracy of a graph is defined in terms of its
k-cores. The documentation says

```
   The *degeneracy* of a graph `G`, usually denoted `\delta^*(G)`, is the
   smallest integer `k` such that the graph `G` can be reduced to the
   empty graph by iteratively removing vertices of degree `\leq k`.
   Equivalently, `\delta^*(G)=k` if `k` is the smallest integer such that
   the `k`-core of `G` is empty.
```
The last statement is incorrect.
According to the definitions, the degeneracy of a graph is `k-1` (not `k`) if
`k` is the smallest integer such that the `k`-core of `G` is empty.

This ticket corrects that.
