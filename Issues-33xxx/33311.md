Yes, this is the problem. I had forgotten about that. It's been a bit. For some reason, my local `ntl` install is not the one that installs the .pc file. It would be nice to get this completely fixed. Sorry for the noise.

NTL installs one library, libntl, that doesn't conflict with any other software. It's in the library search path (`-lntl`) whether installed on the system or via SPKG.

So AFAIK, the only reason we guess `NTL_LIBDIR` in the first place is for homebrew users who forget to source their homebrew config and then try to use the C compiler in a broken environment. It continues to waste everyone's time and should just be deleted.
