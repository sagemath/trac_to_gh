Also,

```
$ grep \/\/\/ pkgs/sage-conf/sage_conf.py

NTL_INCDIR = "///usr/include"

which I think should be

```

<a id='comment:8'>**Comment 8:**</a>
NTL installs one library, libntl, that doesn't conflict with any other software. It's in the library search path (`-lntl`) whether installed on the system or via SPKG.

So AFAIK, the only reason we guess `NTL_LIBDIR` in the first place is for homebrew users who forget to source their homebrew config and then try to use the C compiler in a broken environment. It continues to waste everyone's time and should just be deleted.
