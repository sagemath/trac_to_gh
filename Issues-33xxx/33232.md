It is a standard format for test reporting, supported by major tools; for example:
- https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/output.html#creating-junitxml-format-files

To write:
- https://pypi.org/project/junit-xml/

To read:
- https://junitparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Why we want it:

1) Make patchbot failure reporting useful when base already has some failures
