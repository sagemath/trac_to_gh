Currently, point addition for elliptic curves is only defined in `EllipticCurvePoint_field` and its children. This patch implements point arithmetic for `EllipticCurvePoint`, while also keeping the specialized (faster) implementation for fields. This is useful for symbolic computations, such as the ones that show up in a basic version of Schoof's algorithm (where we compute in a polynomial ring modulo the ideal generated by a division polynomial and the curve equation).

Another implication of this is that we can remove part of the "temporary" hack for elliptic-curve points over ℤ/n that was introduced in #1975.

where the first two are just python while the 3rd is simpler and mathematically equivalent.

However, are you sure that the z-coordinate will always be 1 for nonzero points over non-fields?  I will keep reading...

Another simplification:  after the preceding check, if x1==x2 then also y1==y2 (unless you do not want me to assume that quadratics over non-fields have no more than 2 roots, in which case my previous suggestion may not be valid either):

```
    if x1==x2:
       num = 3*x1*x1 + 2*a2*x1 + a4 - a1*y1
       den = 2*y1 + a1*x1 + a3
    else:
       num = y1-y2
       den = x1-x2
   try:
      m = num/den
   except ZeroDivisionError:
              R = E.base_ring()
              if R.is_finite():
                  N = R.characteristic()
                  N1 = N.gcd(Integer(den))
                  N2 = N//N1
                  raise ZeroDivisionError("Inverse of %s does not exist (characteristic = %s = %s*%s)" % (den, N, N1, N2))
              else:
                   raise ZeroDivisionError("Inverse of %s does not exist" % (den))
```

Apart from these (which I know don't have much to do with your chenges) I think this looks good.  Can you add at least one test to show that what used to work (over Z/NZ say) still does, and also something which used not to work but now does?

I've included Alex' version of the Bosma-Lenstra formulas to compute point additions over fairly general rings. One thing I'm not quite sure about is how to combine the results of the two formulas in case neither gives a valid projective point — in the current code, this is done by brute-forcing random linear combinations, but there must be a more algebraic way. (It's fairly straightforward for Bézout rings.)

Thanks for your comments.

- Indeed, some quick experiments suggest a ≈10× slowdown. Perhaps we should try to adapt the standard formulas to quotients of Euclidean domains? This would cover both of your examples, and more.

- Getting the `ZeroDivisionError` back should be achievable by explicitly constructing an `EllipticCurvePoint_field(E, ...)` rather than using `E.point(...)`. The standard `ZeroDivisionError` error message is slightly less well-adjusted to the ECM use case, but it does contain the relevant non-unit so you can still easily factor the modulus from the exception string.

<a id='comment:16'>Comment 16:</a>
Since I was asked, I'll comment.  Two points:

1. I myself have no need to ever try to define elliptic curves over general rings.  The reason I put in the hack which pretended that elliptic curves over `\ZZ/N` were elliptic curves over fields, was to enable a simple-minded ECM to work for teaching purposes, making sure that the error message produced, when zero-divisors were encountered, displayed the nontrivial factor of `N`.  And I did this after a complaint by Ken Ribet (eminent mathematician and AMS President 2017-2018) that the Sage code he used to teach exactly this to undergraduates at Berkeley no longer worked.  It's a very good thing to have such people promoting Sage.


I think it could work to have some parameter to the elliptic curve constructor like `assume_base_ring_is_field`, which by default is `False`, but which could be set to `True` for this precise purpose -- with some doctests to show exactly how this could be used for such a simple ECM implementation.  In (just about) all other situations, the default would do the mathematically correct thing.

2.  Secondly, it is **unacceptable** to have a 10* slowdown for point operations over fields!  The vast majority of point operations would be over fields.  Surely the thing to do would be to put in the generic stuff introduced here for `EllipticCurvePoint`, while keeping the old field-only code (or whatever is fastest over fields) for the class `EllipticCurvePoint_field`?

Thanks for clarifying (and I know that I could also have looked at the code, but it is good to have this stated explicitly on the ticket).

This deals with my second point, at least!

Two plugin issues:

* There's a pyflakes error: `src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_generic.py:56:1 'sage.rings.abc' imported but unused`
* The `add` function in `addition_formulas_ring.py` needs doctests.

There's also a doctest failure:

I had a shot at adapting the standard formulas to quotients of Euclidean domains.

Performance comparison for a single point addition modulo `2^127-1`:

```
field-specific code:  625 loops, best of 3: 21.8 μs per loop
Euclidean quotients:  625 loops, best of 3: 37.8 μs per loop
generic formulas:     625 loops, best of 3: 123 μs per loop
```

I think we don't need to add another hack to the `EllipticCurve` constructor for this because `Zmod` already has one that does the trick:

```sage
sage: R = Zmod(13 * 17, is_field=True)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(R, [1,0])
sage: P = E.lift_x(4)
sage: 123*P
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ZeroDivisionError: inverse of Mod(34, 221) does not exist
```

That's nice, however:

```sage
sage: E = EllipticCurve(Zmod(35, is_field=True), [5,1])
sage: E.base_field()
...
AttributeError: 'EllipticCurve_generic_with_category' object has no attribute 'base_field'
```
in fact

```sage
sage: parent(E)
<class 'sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_generic.EllipticCurve_generic_with_category'>
```
so it would still need "the hack" (broken as of 9.6 and fixed in #34681).
Compare to

```sage
sage: parent(EllipticCurve(Zmod(7, is_field=True), [5,1]))
<class 'sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_finite_field.EllipticCurve_finite_field_with_category'>
```

Actually:

```sage
sage: Zmod(35, is_field=True).is_field()
False
```
so, what's the effect of `is_field=True`?

Also, this is potentially dangerous:

```sage
sage: Zmod(35, is_field=True) is Zmod(35, is_field=False)
True
```

This means the example above works after clearing the cache:

```sage
sage: Zmod._cache.clear()
sage: E = EllipticCurve(Zmod(35, is_field=True), [5,1])
sage: E.base_field()
Ring of integers modulo 35
```

But then one might get a scary error message

```sage
sage: Zmod(35).is_field(proof=True)
...
ValueError: THIS SAGE SESSION MIGHT BE SERIOUSLY COMPROMISED!
The order 35 is not prime, but this ring has been put
into the category of fields. This may already have consequences
in other parts of Sage. Either it was a mistake of the user,
or a probabilistic primality test has failed.
In the latter case, please inform the developers.
