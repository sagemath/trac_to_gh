(split out from #33213)

We have historically massaged TMPDIR and TMP when interfacing with ECL to ensure that SAGE_TMP was used consistently for temporary
files. Simply removing this code seems to do the trick, since ECL
wants to use the system location by default.

The fallback within ECL is a little naive, to `/tmp` if `TMPDIR` is unset. But I think that should work on all of our supported platforms, and the GH actions didn't turn up any problems.

If not we could pass in `tempfile.gettempdir()` from python instead.
