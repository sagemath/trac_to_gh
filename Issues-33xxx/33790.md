(split out from #33213)

We have historically massaged TMPDIR and TMP when interfacing with ECL to ensure that SAGE_TMP was used consistently for temporary
files. Simply removing this code seems to do the trick, since ECL
wants to use the system location by default.


Depends on #33829

The fallback within ECL is a little naive, to `/tmp` if `TMPDIR` is unset. But I think that should work on all of our supported platforms, and the GH actions didn't turn up any problems.

If not we could pass in `tempfile.gettempdir()` from python instead.
