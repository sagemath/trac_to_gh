These warnings occur at the wrong verbosity level since they're expected to happen. Fedora would probably accept this patch?

Ok, you can mark it positive review whenever the patchbot passes. The workaround is right. It would just be nicer if we didn't have to spend the cycles grepping the warning out on every system.

I think the patch is acceptable to upstream if we ever get a new sympow version, and has the benefit of eliminating the false warning in case anyone ever tries to use standalone sympow on fedora.
