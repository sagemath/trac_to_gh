Inspired by the discussion in #30362, [comment:77](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/30362#comment:77), we change the `Manifold` constructor so that once can omit the `structure` parameter when parameters such as `diff_degree` or `metric_name` are given:

```
        sage: M = Manifold(3, 'M', diff_degree=0); M
        3-dimensional topological manifold M
        sage: M = Manifold(3, 'M', diff_degree=2); M
        3-dimensional differentiable manifold M
        sage: M = Manifold(3, 'M', metric_name='g'); M
        3-dimensional Riemannian manifold M
```

I'd rather suggest to look into having certain keyword arguments trigger a choice of structure.

```
sage: Manifold(2, 'M', diff_degree=7)
ValueError: diff_degree = 7 is not compatible with a smooth structure
```
Instead, this could perhaps imply `structure='differentiable'`.

```
sage: Manifold(2, 'M', metric_name='g')
2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```
Instead, this should probably select `structure='Riemannian'`.

It would also be good if users could pass a `category` keyword to select the structure. In this direction, also for example the Riemannian structure is not yet reflected in the categories:

```
sage: E = EuclideanSpace(2)
sage: E.category()
Join of Category of smooth manifolds over Real Field with 53 bits of precision and Category of connected manifolds over Real Field with 53 bits of precision and Category of complete metric spaces
```
This is something that we should extend along the way.

Can you elaborate on 1, please?

As for 2, do you have an example where the structure design makes things easier opposed to categories?

I see the point in 3.

Nevertheless, we should rethink the design in some way. We have Riemannian manifolds, which are represented by the class `PseudoRiemannianManifold` and carry the structure `RiemannianStructure`. With #30362 we get new structures, namely Poisson/symplectic structures. But now, a manifold can have a Riemannian structure *and* a symplectic structure. Which base class do we use? Which structure? Do we want to combine structures? If so, how? I just see that the category framework already comes with the benefit of joint categories. It might be easier to use that preexisting architecture.

If you have a manifold `M` with structure `S`, and you realize that it should have structure `T`. This becomes a very simple change of swapping `S` for `T`. In particular, you want to change the smoothness. (Admittedly, I don't think we have a good hook for doing this.)

> As for 2, do you have an example where the structure design makes things easier opposed to categories?

You want information preserved for manifolds over `CC` and over `RR`. These will lie in different categories. It also gets around not having a clear specification of `RR` (e.g., no dependency on precision or the particular implementation). It is also better to identify information with attributes rather than methods (e.g., the chart class) for speed and readability.

Don't conflate structures and base classes. They are different and serve different roles. Don't try and force a square peg into a round hole. Right now there is not a combinatorial explosion of cases, so we don't need to use a backhoe when all we need is a shovel either. If you need a combined structure, then make a combined structure.

Well, that is my point. Base classes and structures *are* different, and yet we have a Riemannian manifold base class *and* structure.

Though I'd prefer categories; if we stay with the structure design, I'd feel more comfortable if we'd implement joins of structures. This is far more flexible and robust for future structures. It's getting harder to change the architecture when the "combinatorial explosion of cases" is already too high.

That is a fallacy as good OOP design means you do not care about how the backend is implemented. This sounds like the engineer's paradox: spend 30% more time making something 10% faster.

My remark originally was that I find `TopologicalManifold('M')` easier to write and remember than `Manifold('M', structure='topological')`. What about exposing the different classes in `mainfold/all`?
At least for a start the initialization code such as
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/manifolds/manifold.py#L2960-L2970
should go in the corresponding constructor of `Topological(Sub)Manifold` in my opinion so that `Manifold` is really only choosing the proper class to initialize based on the parameters provided. Then one can choose if one prefers to import TopologicalManifold and uses it directly, or is the Manifold constructor.

I cannot really contribute to the category vs structure discussion as I'm not familiar enough with the category framework. (If someone wants to enlighten me: what are the practical consequences of viewing `\C` as a complex manifold vs as a real manifold?)
From a mathematical perspective, the 'structure' is often easy to define whereas the relevant category may depend on the applications one has in mind (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_category).

> My remark originally was that I find `TopologicalManifold('M')` easier to write and remember than `Manifold('M', structure='topological')`. What about exposing the different classes in `mainfold/all`?

> should go in the corresponding constructor of `Topological(Sub)Manifold` in my opinion so that `Manifold` is really only choosing the proper class to initialize based on the parameters provided. Then one can choose if one prefers to import TopologicalManifold and uses it directly, or is the Manifold constructor.

I am **very** strong -1 on adding a bunch of things that pollute the global namespace when there is a generic concept (here a "manifold") and a global entry point. Not only does it create more imports at startup (even if done lazily, it still means more objects), more maintenance if names change, and more documentation fragmentation (it makes it much easier to decide where to put, e.g., construction information). (If you find it easier, then you can add it to your `init.sage` file.) We also cannot fully move that code to the initialization because at that point it is too late to decide whether or not we are a submanifold (or decide our structure). The safety checks could be moved if desired.

The dispatching based on `ambient` could of course also be done in a `__classcall__` method, but I haven't made this change on the branch.

Fair enough!
