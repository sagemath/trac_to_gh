Inspired by the discussion in #30362, [[comment:77](#comment%3A77)](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/30362#comment:77), we change the `Manifold` constructor so that once can omit the `structure` parameter when parameters such as `diff_degree` or `metric_name` are given:

```
        sage: M = Manifold(3, 'M', diff_degree=0); M
        3-dimensional topological manifold M
        sage: M = Manifold(3, 'M', diff_degree=2); M
        3-dimensional differentiable manifold M
        sage: M = Manifold(3, 'M', metric_name='g'); M
        3-dimensional Riemannian manifold M
```

I'd rather suggest to look into having certain keyword arguments trigger a choice of structure.

```
sage: Manifold(2, 'M', diff_degree=7)
ValueError: diff_degree = 7 is not compatible with a smooth structure
```
Instead, this could perhaps imply `structure='differentiable'`.

```
sage: Manifold(2, 'M', metric_name='g')
2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```
Instead, this should probably select `structure='Riemannian'`.

It would also be good if users could pass a `category` keyword to select the structure. In this direction, also for example the Riemannian structure is not yet reflected in the categories:

```
sage: E = EuclideanSpace(2)
sage: E.category()
Join of Category of smooth manifolds over Real Field with 53 bits of precision and Category of connected manifolds over Real Field with 53 bits of precision and Category of complete metric spaces
```
This is something that we should extend along the way.

Can you elaborate on 1, please?

As for 2, do you have an example where the structure design makes things easier opposed to categories?

I see the point in 3.

Nevertheless, we should rethink the design in some way. We have Riemannian manifolds, which are represented by the class `PseudoRiemannianManifold` and carry the structure `RiemannianStructure`. With #30362 we get new structures, namely Poisson/symplectic structures. But now, a manifold can have a Riemannian structure *and* a symplectic structure. Which base class do we use? Which structure? Do we want to combine structures? If so, how? I just see that the category framework already comes with the benefit of joint categories. It might be easier to use that preexisting architecture.

If you have a manifold `M` with structure `S`, and you realize that it should have structure `T`. This becomes a very simple change of swapping `S` for `T`. In particular, you want to change the smoothness. (Admittedly, I don't think we have a good hook for doing this.)

> As for 2, do you have an example where the structure design makes things easier opposed to categories?

You want information preserved for manifolds over `CC` and over `RR`. These will lie in different categories. It also gets around not having a clear specification of `RR` (e.g., no dependency on precision or the particular implementation). It is also better to identify information with attributes rather than methods (e.g., the chart class) for speed and readability.

Don't conflate structures and base classes. They are different and serve different roles. Don't try and force a square peg into a round hole. Right now there is not a combinatorial explosion of cases, so we don't need to use a backhoe when all we need is a shovel either. If you need a combined structure, then make a combined structure.

That's a good argument. I think, though, this can easily be circumvented by using a category base class that is not build upon a "base ring" structure.

Well, that is my point. Base classes and structures *are* different, and yet we have a Riemannian manifold base class *and* structure.

Because categories are strongly tied to the creation of the object (and its elements) as it creates a dynamic subclass. In fact, strictly speaking, the differentiable structure of a manifold  can give different objects in the category of differentiable manifolds (although we have actually pushed this data into the manifold itself).

Categories carry mathematical information. You cannot separate the base ring.

> Well, that is my point. Base classes and structures *are* different, and yet we have a Riemannian manifold base class *and* structure.

You cannot get around having a base class when you want extra methods, at least without a performance penalty or monkey-patching. However, it can have a range of structures attached to it.

> Though I'd prefer categories; if we stay with the structure design, I'd feel more comfortable if we'd implement joins of structures. This is far more flexible and robust for future structures. It's getting harder to change the architecture when the "combinatorial explosion of cases" is already too high.

That is a fallacy as good OOP design means you do not care about how the backend is implemented. This sounds like the engineer's paradox: spend 30% more time making something 10% faster.

I am **very** strong -1 on adding a bunch of things that pollute the global namespace when there is a generic concept (here a "manifold") and a global entry point. Not only does it create more imports at startup (even if done lazily, it still means more objects), more maintenance if names change, and more documentation fragmentation (it makes it much easier to decide where to put, e.g., construction information). (If you find it easier, then you can add it to your `init.sage` file.) We also cannot fully move that code to the initialization because at that point it is too late to decide whether or not we are a submanifold (or decide our structure). The safety checks could be moved if desired.

> I am **very** strong -1 on adding a bunch of things that pollute the global namespace when there is a generic concept (here a "manifold") and a global entry point. Not only does it create more imports at startup (even if done lazily, it still means more objects), more maintenance if names change, and more documentation fragmentation (it makes it much easier to decide where to put, e.g., construction information). (If you find it easier, then you can add it to your `init.sage` file.) We also cannot fully move that code to the initialization because at that point it is too late to decide whether or not we are a submanifold (or decide our structure). The safety checks could be moved if desired.

I fully agree with all the above points.

Fair enough!
