In preparation for an upgrade of `jupyter_jsmol` and jupyter component packages (#33530), we make the `jupyter_packaging` package standard. As the latest version of `jupyter_packaging` now uses `hatchling` as its build backend, we add it and its dependencies as standard packages and upgrade related packages.

There should be no user-visible change.
