I am running Debian stable (bullseye), with all packages from `SAGE_ROOT/src/doc/en/installation/debian*.txt` installed. However, the `./configure` complains that some of them should be installed, otherwise the corresponding spkgs will be installed (while they are not required).

#33904 is an instance of this error (which i noticed because building polymake eats a lot of ressources).

The logs are attached. The `configure.log` file contains the output of running the `./configure` script.

The 25 packages for which the mechanism does not work are:

- 4ti2
- cddlib
- coxeter3
- ecl
- eclib
- fplll
- giac
- gp2c
- igraph
- info
- lcalc
- libsemigroups
- linbox
- lrcalc
- pari
- pari_elldata
- pari_galdata
- pari_galpol
- pari_nftables
- pari_seadata
- pari_seadata_small
- #33904: polymake
- primecount
- qhull
- singular

And the hint is wrong.

No, it's correct and carefully phrased:

```
    hint: installing the following system packages, if not
    already present, is recommended and may avoid having to
    build them (though some may have to be built anyway):
```
What you are observing is why it says "MAY AVOID", not "WILL AVOID".

OK, i will try to deal with that.

Then, what would be the procedure to decide whether the distro package is broken or the `spkg-configure.m4` script misses something (when `build/pkgs/spkg/spkg-configure.m4` and `build/pkgs/spkg/distros/distro.txt` are conflicting) ?

The debian.txt files capture many versions of Debian, not just debian-stable - also debian-testing and ubuntu-... and linuxmint-... etc. 

If you are testing on debian-stable, it is to be expected that many packages are just outdated and not suitable for our needs.

If you look at the logs for all Debian variants and it turns out that none of the packages work for us, then we may want to remove the debian.txt file.

There is another related issue: some packages have a `distro/debian.txt` file and no `spkg-configure.m4` file: `gap, lie, maxima, rubiks`, so that the semantics of those files is unclear to me.

Great question.

In part, these files have been added in preparation for spkg-configure.m4 that is in development somewhere. See #27330 for a list of tickets.

`sage -info` (which also creates the documentation at https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/spkg/gap.html#equivalent-system-packages) shows these packages and then points out "these system packages will not be used for building Sage". This is an entry point for developers.

Optional packages such as `rubiks` are also discovered at runtime via `Feature`s. 

And finally, in our portability CI, we have a configuration called `-maximal` that installs these system packages despite having no `spkg-configure.m4`. (If you have Docker installed, you can type `tox -e docker-debian-bullseye-maximal` to run this.) This is useful for testing that the existence of these system packages does not leak in and break our build.
