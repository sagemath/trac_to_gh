All docker-based tests are broken in 9.5.beta9 - https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/runs/1617032864

`pkgs/` and `src/*.m4` must be `ADD`ed to the container already for the `bootstrap` phase so that files such as `pkgs/sagemath-standard/setup.cfg` are generated correctly.
 
This will fix this failures seen in https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/4602240946
