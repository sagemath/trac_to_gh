Matplotlib used to have a global dictionary of color maps. By now, it is considered internal API and does not contain newer color maps anymore, so some of them cannot be used in Sage:

```
sage: density_plot(x, (-1,1), (-1,1), cmap='turbo')
/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/repl/rich_output/display_manager.py:608: RichReprWarning: Exception in _rich_repr_ while displaying object:
Color map turbo not known (type import matplotlib.cm; matplotlib.cm.datad.keys() for valid names)
```

This branch obtains the colormaps from `matplotlib.colormaps` instead of `matplotlib.cm`.

I have removed the module-wide `cm` variable as I do not see a purpose of it. The code is more than 10 years old, so it is probably not related to modularization. My best guess is that it has to do with lazy imports in Python 2.

In the long run, we can also consider removing Sage's `Colormaps` collection and replace it by Matplotlib functionality, since Matplotlib already has support for registering new color maps.
