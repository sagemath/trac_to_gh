We create Python packages at https://github.com/sagemath/database_stein_watkins 
that serve as the new upstream.

The actual files will be accessed via `importlib.resources`; actually the backport package `importlib-resources`, because Python 3.8 does not have [files and as_file](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/importlib.resources.html#importlib.resources.files). Also we need the added [support for package resources in namespace packages](https://github.com/python/importlib_resources/pull/196): the distributions [database-stein-watkins-mini](https://pypi.org/project/database-stein-watkins-mini/20070827/) and [database-stein-watkins-huge](https://pypi.org/project/database-stein-watkins-huge/#description) both share the namespace `database_stein_watkins`.

Currently [database-stein-watkins-huge](https://pypi.org/project/database-stein-watkins-huge/#description) is only a placeholder. Whether we can publish the huge package to PyPI will depend on whether the size limit request at https://github.com/pypa/pypi-support/issues/1946 is successful.

We use [hatchling](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/build/) as the build system. It supports [PEP 660 editable wheels](https://peps.python.org/pep-0660/) and namespace packages. (`flit_core` is not suitable - it does not have support for resources in namespace packages.)
