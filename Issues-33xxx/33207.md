The help for configure claims:

```
$ ./configure --help
...
  --disable-rpath         do not hardcode runtime library paths
...
```

However, this doesn't seem to do anything; binaries still get rpaths:

```
$ objdump -p /usr/lib/sage-9.5.rc3/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/libs/gap/libgap.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so  | grep RPATH
  RPATH                /usr/lib/sage-9.5.rc3/local/lib
```
Since I'm using every library from system, that directory is empty and the rpath is useless.

I was able to disable rpaths as follows:

```

Can this be fixed adding conditionals to those two blocks so they are disabled when `--disable-rpath` was given to configure?

Would it make sense to implement it though?

I'm thinking of a variable `SAGE_DISABLE_RPATH` which if set would skip the two blocks removed in my patch above. Then we could add some magic to `configure.ac` so that `--disable-rpath` would set this variable, but I guess the variable is more useful so it can be used when only installing sagelib as a python module in `/usr`. I guess the other way is to left `SAGE_LOCAL` unset, but I'm not sure if that would work, would it?

Yes, in distribution packaging, `SAGE_LOCAL` is best left unset.
