As reported in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-packaging/c/1G_3JiIcbvY, `sage/doctest/forker.py` is leaking pipes to the point that it is reaching the file handle limit. 

It was eventually fixed with a patch here:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=986527#111

We apply the same patch in this ticket.

Could you put the patch on a branch please?

I do frequently see "Too many open files" errors when running parallel tests on macOS.
