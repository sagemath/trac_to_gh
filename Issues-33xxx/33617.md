(split out from #33549, similar to #33612)

In this way we suppress generating the documentation of this undocumented function. https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/modules/sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_module.html#sage.modules.fg_pid.fgp_module.test_morphism_0

While at it, we improve the markup of the documentation.

<a id='comment:4'></a>For this one, I think we should move this to a method of the corresponding morphism class so we can test it on instances by `TestSuite(phi).run()`. Thus, the doctest would become

```diff
-sage: set_random_seed(s); v = [fgp.test_morphism_0(1) for _ in range(30)]
+sage: set_random_seed(s)
+sage: for _ in range(30):
+....:     phi = random_fgp_morphism_m(1)
+....:     phi.test_morphism_0()
```
This would also mean a bit other internal changes to the method, but then it can be applied more broadly. It would also be good to have a better name for this test too. Maybe `_test_consistency()`?
