(split out from #33549, similar to #33612)

In this way we suppress generating the documentation of this undocumented function. https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/modules/sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_module.html#sage.modules.fg_pid.fgp_module.test_morphism_0

While at it, we improve the markup of the documentation.
