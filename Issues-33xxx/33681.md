```
sage: P = polytopes.cube()
sage: Polyhedron(P.vertices(), rays=[[4,5,6], [-4,-5,-6]], base_ring=ZZ)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```

Normaliz works fine though:

```
sage: Polyhedron(P.vertices(), rays=[[4,5,6], [-4,-5,-6]], base_ring=ZZ, backend='normaliz')
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 6 vertices and 1 line
```

The problem is that the `ppl_polyhedron` picks no integral coordinates for the "vertices" for some reason.
