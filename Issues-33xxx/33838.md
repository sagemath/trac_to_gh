Recently some changes in the build tools for PEP517 python packages in Gentoo lead to `python setup.py build` not being executed in favor of `python setup.py build_ext` see https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/693 and https://bugs.gentoo.org/842534

The Gentoo maintainer reasoning for removing `build` is that it is normally a meta target whose sole purpose is to start other phases like `build_ext`. The over-ridding of the `build` command in sage is an increasingly uncommon practice apparently. 

The `build` target does only one thing, run `run_autogen` to generate some cython code and `build` is explicitly only called by the sage build system when it is configured without `--enable-editable`[https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/build/pkgs/sagelib/spkg-install#L55](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/build/pkgs/sagelib/spkg-install#L55). In builds with that option enabled, autogeneration is called from `setup.py` [https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/setup.py#L78](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/setup.py#L78) and `build` is not called explicitly.

We take the opportunity to simplify the build system further and reduce the differences editable and non-editable build by either fully moving the autogeneration in `setup.py`.


(An alternative would have been to move it to `build_ext` the strategy I followed as a quick fix in https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/sci-mathematics/sage_setup/files/sage_setup-9.6-no_build.patch)

I was replying a bit more tongue in check to your first post when the second one came :)

I agree about going with the setup.py solution and thought of my problem as an opportunity to simplify things and minimise difference between editable/non-editable. There are obviously issues there and autogen is one of them.

```

Yes, it will be a nice simplification to get rid of the `sage_build` class.

I don't think we have a need for the autogen stuff to be called in several distribution packages, so nothing is gained from having it in a reusable class.
