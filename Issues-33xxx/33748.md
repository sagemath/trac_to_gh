This comes up rather frequently:

```sage
sage: F.<i> = GF(431^2, modulus=x^2+1)
sage: a = F.random_element()  # some computation
sage: coeffs = a.polynomial().padded_list(2)  # cumbersome!
```

For number fields, we do have a shorthand:

```sage
sage: K.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: b = K.random_element()  # some computation
sage: coeffs = b.list()
```


This patch adds a `.__getitem__()` method to the class `FinitePolyExtElement`, which makes `a[i]` and `list(a)` and `tuple(a)` work as expected.

For compatibility with number-field elements, we also add `.list()`, which should behave identically to calling `list()` on the element.

While it is not in the built documentation, if this ever gets moved into something public, the ``n`th` will fail.
