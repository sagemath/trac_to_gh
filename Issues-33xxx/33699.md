Attempt to compute `discrete_log(M,M)` for a matrix `M` over a finite field results in one of two errors:

> ValueError: No discrete log of ... found to base ...

or

> TypeError: mutable matrices are unhashable

depending on the given matrix `M`.

```
F = GF(9,'z')
F.inject_variables()
S = MatrixSpace(F, 2, 2)

M = Matrix(F, [[z + 2,2*z],[2,z]]) # leads to "ValueError: No discrete log of ... found to base ..."
#M = Matrix(F, [[2,2*z],[2*z + 1,2*z + 1]]) # leads to "TypeError: mutable matrices are unhashable"

r = discrete_log(M,M,ord=S.cardinality()-1) # expect r = 1
```

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

There is more than one issue, so more than one ticket may be needed.

The first matrix `M = Matrix(F, [[z + 2,2*z],[2,z]])` reveals a bug in the code. The documentation says that `ord` needs to be a multiple of the order of `base`, but I think the code actually assumes that it is *equal* to `base.order()`. (More precisely, I think the algorithm requires that `ord/base.order()` is relatively prime to `base.order()`, but `ord/base.order()` does not actually need to be `1`.) This bug in the code should be fixed (perhaps by searching through the factors of `ord` to find the order of `base.order()`).

```
sage: F = GF(9,'z')
sage: F.inject_variables()
Defining z
sage: M = Matrix(F, [[z + 2,2*z],[2,z]])
sage: M^8  # the multiplicative order of M is 8
[1 0]
[0 1]
sage: discrete_log(M, M, ord=8)  # this works
1
sage: discrete_log(M, M, ord=16)  # this does not work
    ...
ValueError: no discrete log of [z + 2   2*z]
[    2     z] found to base [z + 2   2*z]
[    2     z]
```

The second example in the ticket description is user error, because `S.cardinality()-1` is not a valid value for `ord`:

```
sage: S = MatrixSpace(F, 2, 2)
sage: M = Matrix(F, [[2,2*z],[2*z + 1,2*z + 1]])
sage: M^(S.cardinality() - 1)  # this needs to be the identity matrix, but it's not
[  z + 1       1]
[2*z + 2 2*z + 1]
```
However, this example does reveal two problems in the code:
1. The function should give a better error message when the value of `ord` is invalid.
2. The algorithm assumes that elements of the group are hashable (because it uses a dictionary), but this is not specified in the documentation. Either this requirement needs to be documented (and a better error message issued), or an implementation needs to be provided for the unhashable case.

Another possible issue is the use of `except Exception` in the code. Should there be a more specific list of exceptions?
