Finite fields have `.fetch_int()` to decode integers into finite-field elements by reinterpreting the base-`p` representation as a polynomial:

```sage
sage: F.<t> = GF(7^10)
sage: el = F.fetch_int(2424); el
t^4 + 3*t + 2
```

However, the inverse operation is a bit cumbersome:

```sage
sage: el.polynomial().change_ring(ZZ)(el.parent().characteristic())
2424
```

In this patch, we add an inverse to `.fetch_int()`, named `.to_integer()` in resemblance with the Python method `int.to_bytes()`.

For symmetry, we then rename `.fetch_int()` to `.from_integer()`: I, for one, could never remember if `.fetch_int()` refers to "fetching an element from an int" or "fetching this element into an int", so I think the new name makes a lot more sense.

Also, some code cleanup and optimization while we're at it.

<a id='comment:3'></a>I just found out that #31605 already tracks this issue and that binary finite fields have `.integer_representation()`.

This leaves us with three options for naming these methods:
1. `.fetch_int()` / `.integer_representation()`    [backwards compatible]
2. `.from_integer()` / `.integer_representation()` [one deprecation]
3. `.from_integer()` / `.to_integer()`             [two deprecations]

Personally I'm still in favor of (3) because the others lack symmetry. Opinions?

The only reason I would see not to would be consistency
with other software.

Do Magma, Maple, Mathematica have similar functions,
and if so how they are named?

I could not find one for Magma and Maple. Mathematica has `ToElementCode` and `FromElementCode`

I think Sage is the leading software in this regard. No worry for consistency.

+1 to option 3.
