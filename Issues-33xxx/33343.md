Sage has the function `EllipticCurve_from_cubic` which takes a nonsingular homogenous ternary cubic and computes the transformation putting it in Weierstrass form. However, for some reason it frequently returns Weierstrass forms with enormous coefficients:

```
sage: R.<x, y, z> = QQ[]
sage: F = y^3 - (2*x^3 + x*z^2 + z^3)
sage: phi = EllipticCurve_from_cubic(F, P=[0,1,1])
sage: phi
Scheme morphism:
  From: Projective Plane Curve over Rational Field defined by -2*x^3 + y^3 - x*z^2 - z^3
  To:   Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + 1590141618/30747905533*x*y + 297833158584669774263758848/29070105931314312808600877054437*y = x^3 + 210711951019685583/945433694666292014089*x^2 over Rational Field
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (x : y : z) to
        (1911591485495/255680712*x^2 - 3730939254391/85226904*x*y + 32488353016/507303*y^2 + 1862858955971/42613452*x*z - 580149161/4536*y*z + 1814126426447/28408968*z^2 : -35778701485/501891768*x^2 + 66363957893/167297256*x*y - 549152744/995817*y^2 - 33133115773/83648628*x*z + 9806299/8904*y*z - 578571641/1052184*z^2 : -548492564741779486954733529329/22928010543173296415232*x^2 + 548492564741779486954733529329/3821335090528882735872*x*y - 548492564741779486954733529329/2547556727019255157248*y^2 - 548492564741779486954733529329/3821335090528882735872*x*z + 548492564741779486954733529329/1273778363509627578624*y*z - 548492564741779486954733529329/2547556727019255157248*z^2)
```
The target Weierstrass-form curve has a much nicer description:

```
sage: phi.codomain().minimal_model()
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - 29 over Rational Field
```
but it's actually a bit fiddly getting the isomorphism onto the minimal model, since Sage doesn't know how to compose general scheme morphisms with elliptic curve `WeierstrassIsomorphism` objects. 

This should be streamlined by having `EllipticCurve_from_cubic` and the related `EllipticCurve_from_curve` return globally minimal models where those make sense, or semi-minimal models over general number fields.
