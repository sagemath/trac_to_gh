Now with the simplifications from #33786, #33787, were it not for the "relocate-once" code (which is only needed for Volker's binary packaging), we could just replace `SAGE_ROOT/sage` by a symlink to `src/bin/sage` (and add a fallback to determine `SAGE_ROOT` from `$SELF` there).

https://github.com/sagemath/binary-pkg (if anyone still wants to use it) 
could just replace the symlink by the custom script that runs relocate-once.

Not sure if this is really an improvement, but it's a simplification of sorts.
