While doctesting `src/sage/repl/ipython_kernel/install.py`:
    
```
DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence '\s'
```
    
The solution is to make the regex a raw string.

Upstream: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/6253

We update to the latest in the 6.4.x series, 6.4.10, which contains the fix.
