Another item that I think needs to be fixed: in the `resolution` method:

```
            sage: E.<x,y> = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ)
            sage: triv = FPModule(E, [0], [[x], [y]]) # trivial module
            sage: triv.resolution(3)
            [Free module morphism:
               From: Free graded left module on 1 generator over The exterior algebra of rank 2 over Rational Field
               To:   Finitely presented left module on 1 generator and 2 relations over The exterior algebra of rank 2 over Rational Field
               Defn: g[0] |--> g[0],
             Free module morphism:
               From: Free graded left module on 2 generators over The exterior algebra of rank 2 over Rational Field
               To:   Free graded left module on 1 generator over The exterior algebra of rank 2 over Rational Field
               Defn: g[1, 0] |--> x*g[0]
                     g[1, 1] |--> y*g[0],
```
The first map here is not a "Free module morphism" because its codomain is not free.

I thought about this, and I made a deliberate choice here (one which the code was actually already doing, it just didn't show up explicitly in the doctests). Having it be a free module homomorphism I think is the correct thing to do because we can take advantage of the fact the domain is a free module. I don't think I changed the doc for `FreeGradedModuleMorphism`, which only says that the codomain must be a graded module. So the output mentioned in [comment:2](#comment%3A2) is correct IMO. For the code as it is now, there is no need to make a distinction based on the codomain AFAICS.

Why are you testing `degree()` in `FPModuleElement.coefficients()`? Was this meant to be in `degree()`?

```diff
     - ``check`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); if ``True``, check
-      that the morphism is well-defined.
+      that the morphism is well-defined
```

This is more of an optimization, but it might be better to use `self.codomain().linear_combination()` in `__call__` instead of

```
        value = sum((c * v for c, v in zip(x.coefficients(), self._values)),
                    self.codomain().zero())
```
If the `FPModule` class does not implement it, we should add it for compatibility.

I am also thinking if we should store `_values` for a `FreeMorphism` as a `dict`, then we could use `x.monomial_coefficients(copy=False)` to only get the non-zero entries. This would also make it order independent. Although then we get into issues of sparse-vs-dense implementations.

Note that `coefficients()` for the free module now has a different behavior than for `CFM` and from the category as it contains `0` entries. (Something I missed previously.) I think this should be changed and within the code we should use `dense_coefficient_list()` (with possibly passing the fixed order where necessary). In particular, I consider this to be a bug.

It was a test of the change in the `coefficients` method (removing the sorting), but it might make more sense in `degree`.

Done, and also got rid of an extra blank line there, too.

It's already implemented, so I used it.

I haven't done this. Things are working without it, but we could make this change. We could do the same for coefficients for elements.

I changed the name to `dense_coefficient_list`.

Right now all of the examples are effectively acting like dense modules or are small rank. This would be a more invasive change, so I would postpone it for later unless you have a strong desire for it.

I'm probably doing something stupid, but I can't figure out how to do that:

```python
sage: from sage.modules.fp_graded.free_module import FreeGradedModule
sage: A = SteenrodAlgebra()
sage: M = FreeGradedModule(A, (0, 2))
sage: a = M.an_element()
sage: super(FiniteDimensionalModulesWithBasis, a.parent())
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<ipython-input-68-e3772131b543> in <module>
----> 1 super(FiniteDimensionalModulesWithBasis, a.parent())

TypeError: super(type, obj): obj must be an instance or subtype of type

sage: super(FiniteDimensionalModulesWithBasis.element_class, a)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

----> 1 super(FiniteDimensionalModulesWithBasis.element_class, a)

TypeError: super() argument 1 must be type, not lazy_attribute
```
I've tried a few other variations, but no luck so far.
