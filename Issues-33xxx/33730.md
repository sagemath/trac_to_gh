The function `desolve_rk4` in `calculus/desolvers.py` uses `str(ivar)` to convert initial values to strings, while the function `desolve_system_rk4` in the same file uses `ivar._maxima_().str(). When using `desolve_system_rk4` in an `@interact` with sliders, the values generated by the sliders seem to be regular floats, and do not have `_maxima_()` attribute, which causes an error.  Solving a single equation using `desolve_rk4` inside an `@interact` works fine.

A workaround is to wrap initial values generated by sliders in `RR()` when using `desolve_system_rk4`, but that is ugly and inconsistent, since there is no need to do that when using `desolve_rk4`. 

Component: **numerical**
