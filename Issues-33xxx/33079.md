Fails here. Something may be wrong with my Cygwin.

Before getting Python 3.9 there, Sage would build
using system Python 3.8.12.

It now deems system Python 3.9 unusable, and build
its own Python lacking an ssl module.

Neither #33055 (fix build of python3 spkg on Conda)
nor #33066 (openssl 3.0.1) help.

Logs for failed build of Sage 9.5.beta9 + #33078:
