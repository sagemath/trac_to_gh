It appears that https://www.wolfram.com/engine/
is basically a Mathematica terminal engine freely available for personal use.
One has to create a script renaming `wolframengine` to `math`.
Put it in your PATH
(or just in the file `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/math` - it would be wiped by `make distclean` though). I tried having

```
$ cat local/bin/math
#!/bin/sh
/usr/bin/env wolframscript $@
```
and 

```
$ chmod 755 local/bin/math
```
and then all 142 tests in `$ ./sage -tp --optional=debian,pip,sage,sage_spkg,mathematica src/sage/interfaces/mathematica.py`
pass on Linux and on macOS. Not tested on Windows.

What is the full path to `wolframscript` ? Is it `/usr/local/bin/wolframscript` ?
