<a id='comment:1'></a>This is not specific to gitpod. I am experiencing it too. It seem to have been introduced in beta6. 

I guess that the following happens. plot_directive extension writes its own css files into _static directory for each sphinx project. In our case, _static is a symlink to ../static directory, which is shared with all projects. Hence when plot_directive attempts to write again, _static (or ../static) directory already has the files, which triggers "File exists" error.

What I don't understand why this mechanism was no problem before, but now it is...

This may be wrong. In another build, I see those errors back even with python 3.10.3. I am utterly confused.

Is this a documentation building from scratch?

OK, then I do not have this issue. From the `develop` branch w/o this ticket and after successfully building the documentation:

```
$ ./sage --docbuild tutorial html
[tutorial ] Merging environment/index files...
[tutorial ] ... done (0 todos, 23 index, 17 citations, 0 modules)
[tutorial ] no targets are out of date.

Build finished. The built documents can be found in /local/sage-git/sage/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/tutorial
```
and

```
$ ./sage --docbuild reference html

[reference] The HTML pages are in local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference.

```

I only see the `issue` if the documentation is not built first.

-(not sure if these issues are specific to gitpod)

-To reproduce:
-- Go to https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/tree/develop (or if that works https://gitpod.io#snapshot/d3ce0749-4d92-44ff-bb06-04626d4e3b2c, in which case you don't need to wait for the build)
-- Wait until the build of sagelib completes (takes about 30mins)
-- Run above commands

<a id='comment:21'></a>I should have tested it with

```
make doc-clean; make doc-uninstall; make
```
in the first place, since the first issue I mentioned earlier is fixed by it.

Running this command on `develop` leads to the issues with `_static`, and with this branch these issues are fixed. Thus, lets get this in.
