This is not specific to gitpod. I am experiencing it too. It seem to have been introduced in beta6. 

I guess that the following happens. plot_directive extension writes its own css files into _static directory for each sphinx project. In our case, _static is a symlink to ../static directory, which is shared with all projects. Hence when plot_directive attempts to write again, _static (or ../static) directory already has the files, which triggers "File exists" error.

What I don't understand why this mechanism was no problem before, but now it is...

Are

```

and

```
$ ./sage --docbuild reference html
```
supposed to fail after a normal `sagelib-9.6.beta6` build without doing anything else? If so, I don't see this here. Everything works.

In beta6, python3 was upgraded:

If you build sage with python 3.10.3, there are no more those errors. So this might be some incompatibility in python system library and packages...

This may be wrong. In another build, I see those errors back even with python 3.10.3. I am utterly confused.

I don't want to get off topic, but since we're talking about symlinks, without this branch a fresh build of the `html` docs gives errors like

```
[reference] Handler <function `_copy_css_`file at 0x7f6177a57880> for event 'build-finished' threw an exception (exception: [Errno 17] File exists: '/local/sage-git/sage/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/references/_static')
```
There are 156 of these errors and the referenced `_static` files are symlinks to an actual `_static` folder, i.e.

```
/local/sage-git/sage/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/references/_static -> ../_static

Not related to this issue but I'm unable to start a new `SageMath` jupyter notebook. Before opening a new issue I wanted to make sure others are seeing this.

```
./sage -n jupyter
```
select `New -> [SageMath](SageMath) 9.6.beta6` and nothing happens. In the terminal

```
[I 12:39:27.730 NotebookApp] Creating new notebook in

with nothing else.

No. You must successfully build the docoumentation from scratch first, which means

```
make doc-clean; make doc-uninstall; make

Is this a documentation building from scratch?

OK, then I do not have this issue. From the `develop` branch w/o this ticket and after successfully building the documentation:

```
$ ./sage --docbuild tutorial html
[tutorial ] Merging environment/index files...
[tutorial ] ... done (0 todos, 23 index, 17 citations, 0 modules)
[tutorial ] no targets are out of date.
[tutorial ] The HTML pages are in local/share/doc/sage/html/en/tutorial.
Build finished. The built documents can be found in /local/sage-git/sage/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/tutorial
```
and

```
$ ./sage --docbuild reference html
[reference] no targets are out of date.
[reference] The HTML pages are in local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/references.

[spkg     ] The HTML pages are in local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/spkg.

...

[reference] no targets are out of date.
[reference] The HTML pages are in local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference.
Build finished. The built documents can be found in /local/sage-git/sage/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference
```

I only see the `issue` if the documentation is not built first.

I should have tested it with

```
make doc-clean; make doc-uninstall; make
```
in the first place, since the first issue I mentioned earlier is fixed by it.

Running this command on `develop` leads to the issues with `_static`, and with this branch these issues are fixed. Thus, lets get this in.

If the documentation has not been built, then (for example) `./sage --docbuild tutorial html` fails. I think this used to work, but I'm not sure and if it did, I don't know how long ago. Is there a ticket for this issue?
