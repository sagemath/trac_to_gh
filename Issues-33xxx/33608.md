This is not specific to gitpod. I am experiencing it too. It seem to have been introduced in beta6. 

I guess that the following happens. plot_directive extension writes its own css files into _static directory for each sphinx project. In our case, _static is a symlink to ../static directory, which is shared with all projects. Hence when plot_directive attempts to write again, _static (or ../static) directory already has the files, which triggers "File exists" error.

What I don't understand why this mechanism was no problem before, but now it is...

Are

```
$ ./sage --docbuild tutorial html
```
and

```
$ ./sage --docbuild reference html
```
supposed to fail after a normal `sagelib-9.6.beta6` build without doing anything else? If so, I don't see this here. Everything works.

I don't want to get off topic, but since we're talking about symlinks, without this branch a fresh build of the `html` docs gives errors like

```
[reference] Handler <function _copy_css_file at 0x7f6177a57880> for event 'build-finished' threw an exception (exception: [Errno 17] File exists: '/local/sage-git/sage/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/references/_static')
```
There are 156 of these errors and the referenced `_static` files are symlinks to an actual `_static` folder, i.e.

```
/local/sage-git/sage/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/references/_static -> ../_static
```

No. You must successfully build the docoumentation from scratch first, which means

Is this a documentation building from scratch?

OK, then I do not have this issue. From the `develop` branch w/o this ticket and after successfully building the documentation:

```
$ ./sage --docbuild tutorial html
[tutorial ] Merging environment/index files...
[tutorial ] ... done (0 todos, 23 index, 17 citations, 0 modules)

and

```
$ ./sage --docbuild reference html

[reference] The HTML pages are in local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference.
Build finished. The built documents can be found in /local/sage-git/sage/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference
```

I only see the `issue` if the documentation is not built first.

I should have tested it with

```
make doc-clean; make doc-uninstall; make
```

Running this command on `develop` leads to the issues with `_static`, and with this branch these issues are fixed. Thus, lets get this in.

If the documentation has not been built, then (for example) `./sage --docbuild tutorial html` fails. I think this used to work, but I'm not sure and if it did, I don't know how long ago. Is there a ticket for this issue?
