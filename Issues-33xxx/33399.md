```
In Sage 9.6.beta2, we have

```
sage: from sage.manifolds.utilities import ExpressionNice
sage: u, v = var('u v')
sage: f = function('F')(u + v)
sage: f
F(u + v)
sage: ExpressionNice(diff(f, u))
d(F)/d(u + v)
```
So far, so good, but

```
sage: f = function('F')(u - v)
sage: ExpressionNice(diff(f, u))
d(F)/du - v
```
This bug has been reported in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-support/c/fbE0APqThEk

With the fix introduced in this ticket, the last output is now

```
d(F)/d(u - v)
```

You are right; I should have said *basic* Python, instead of *standard* Python. My concern was actually the CPU performance: it's always better to avoid an import, isn't it? (unless of course the function you import does the job more efficiently).
