Implement the solid angle measure (the plane angle) of a two-dimensional cone, using the dot-product (trigonometry) formula. 

We do not assume nor compute the minimal description of the cone.
When the input contains more than two vectors as generators of the cone, we decompose the cone into simplicial cones. The helper function `simplicial_subcones_decomposition` will be re-used in higher dimension cases.

For example, the solid angle of the upper half plane (generated by three rays, hence not simplicial) `solid_angle_2d([[1,0],[0,1],[-1,0]])` is 1/2.

Do you have an application for non-algebraic irrational input?

If yes, then yes, one would have to either avoid Polyhedron or extend Polyhedron so it can handle well-behaved symbolic elements. After all, this error:

```
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[[1], [sqrt(2)]], base_ring=SR, backend='field')
ValueError: the 'field' backend for polyhedron cannot be used with non-exact fields
```
is artificial - it's there to protect users from weird stuff that can happen.

If no, then maybe this generality is not worth working on?

<a id='comment:22'></a>You are right, I don't have an application where the input is non-algebraic irrationals. 

I agree that symbolics facility (`var` and `solve`) should be avoid.

However, I thought that checking the special cases of half space and whole space is straightforward enough, which make the use of Polyhedron and the conversion to AA seem overkill. It's just some if else statements, and with that, the input `A = matrix([[sqrt(2),0],[0,1]])` can work. In my option, it's unusual to input `matrix(AA, [[sqrt(2),0],[0,1]])`. 

Also, if we convert the inputs matrix to over AA, what would be the right type of the output? Do we always have AA as output type, never the Symbolic ring or Symbolic Constants Subring?

I still don't see how to convert `AA(sqrt(2))` (interval AA number) back to `sqrt(2)` as output, if the input was in the symbolic ring.

<a id='comment:32'></a>I don't really have use cases in 2D, 2D angles are trivial...

It feels weird that if a Calculus student wants to compute the angle between ray (1, 0) and ray (0, sqrt(3)), they must have normaliz installed. 

My thought is not to use Polyhedron in 2d, but just check for the two special cases.

Alternatively, we can use `P = Polyhedron(rays=A.rows(), base_ring=AA)` which doesn't call normaliz. But then, I don't know how to convert the AA result back to symbolic.
