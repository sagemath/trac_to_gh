The following example will hang:

```
sage: k = GF(2^60)
sage: R.<x> = k[]
sage: f = (x - k.random_element()) * (x - k.random_element())
sage: f.any_root()
```
while this will quickly succeed:

```
sage: f.roots(multiplicities=False)[0]
```

The core of the `any_root` implementation is the following (from [poylnomial_element.pyx](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx#n1889)):

```
if q % 2 == 0:
    while True:
        T = R.random_element(2*degree-1)
        if T == 0:
            continue
        T = T.monic()
        C = T
        for i in range(degree-1):
            C = T + pow(C,q,self)
        h = self.gcd(C)
        hd = h.degree()
        if hd != 0 and hd != self.degree():
            if 2*hd <= self.degree():
                return h.any_root(ring, -degree, True)
            else:
                return (self//h).any_root(ring, -degree, True)
```
In the example above, `degree=1` (since we're looking for roots in the base ring), and thus we're just randomly choosing a `T` and seeing if it has nontrivial gcd with the input.  So we're just randomly guessing in large characteristic 2 fields, which of course takes a long time.  

Sage's implementation follows the description of the Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm in Cohen's Intro to Computational Algebraic Number Theory (Alg. 3.4.8) for example, but that exposition is focused on the case that the base ring is a prime field (GF(2) here).  In order to handle other characteristic 2 finite fields you need to do more work: see the [original paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-new-algorithm-for-factoring-polynomials-over-Cantor-Zassenhaus/ba9d15ca143d2fefe150169243f855c151aa1fb0) or [this preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.5322.pdf).

Two possible solutions: either implement the algorithm properly, or fall back to just using `f.roots(multiplicities=False)[0]` in this case.
