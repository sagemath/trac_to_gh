Use coverage.py to generate coverage results for the sage source code based on the test execution. In contrast to sage's na√Øve coverage tool, this not only looks for the existence of doctests for a method but actually measures which lines are actually executed by the tests.

These coverage results are then uploaded to codecov, where one can inspect the results. See https://codecov.io/gh/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/tree/ec045eb0168b937e35375e803979975df4aa6564/src/sage for the current coverage. Codecov also displays the coverage of changed files, so that one can easily check if changes are indeed covered by tests. An example would be https://codecov.io/gh/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/ec045eb0168b937e35375e803979975df4aa6564 but there are of course no changes in python files in this ticket, so it shows nothing interesting.

I added `git` to `-recommended`, see #33296, #33277, but we're not building the image yet. We could replace `-standard` but `-recommended`. Probably best after #33062.

You don't need `sudo`, you are running as `root`.

In contrast to sage's na\u00efve coverage tool, this not only looks for the existence of doctests for a method but actually measures which lines are actually executed by the tests.\n+\n+These coverage results are then uploaded to codecov, where one can inspect the results. See https://codecov.io/gh/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/tree/ec045eb0168b937e35375e803979975df4aa6564/src/sage for the current coverage. Codecov also displays the coverage of changed files, so that one can easily check if changes are indeed covered by tests.

+Use coverage.py to generate coverage results for the sage source code based on the test execution. In contrast to sage's na√Øve coverage tool, this not only looks for the existence of doctests for a method but actually measures which lines are actually executed by the tests.
+
+These coverage results are then uploaded to codecov, where one can inspect the results. See https://codecov.io/gh/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/tree/ec045eb0168b937e35375e803979975df4aa6564/src/sage for the current coverage.
