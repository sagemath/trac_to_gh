In this ticket we add some improvements for slow doctests in files that used to take more than 200s for --long. Also mark some tests as long so the file runs fast in not long mode.

- isogeny_small_degree: the worst part is already fixed by 33293.
- function_field: save 100s by tuning down number of repetitions.
- doctests/test: this one spawns `sage-runtests` a lot of times to test, by tuning the cmdline this takes 1s less for each without compromising the test. Also improve the time it takes to test `die_timeout` by making it adjustable on the cmdline.

<a id='comment:7'></a>I'm sorry Volker, this was totally my fault.

I forgot to `git add` one line. It turns out it's not enough to add the default for `die_timeout` in the argument parser in `src/bin/sage-runtests`. It also has to be added in `sage.doctest.control.DocTestDefaults()` since doctests run tests without going through `sage-runtests`.

When I pushed this I was trapped by #33473 which broke doctesting in all my boxes so I wasn't running full doctests, and I missed this, my bad.

I took the chance to tune up the die_timeout since I discovered that when pytest is installed, running `sage-runtest` (as done in `sage/doctests/test.py`) takes a ~3s overhead which breaks one doctest under the smaller die_timeout (we sleep 2s and test the process is still alive, but the 3s overhead means it's indeed dead), this would be unnecessary if #33531 is merged.
