The user should be able to change the display of the variables in the localisation.

Something like:

```sage
sage: P.<X, Y> = QQ[]
sage: L.<x, y> = P.localization(X - Y)
```

where the generators would display as `X, Y `in `P` and as `x, y` in `L`. 

Furthermore some minor style fixes mentioned in [comment 16](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/33463#comment:16) of #33463 should be realized.

Depends on #33463

The issue described here is open concerning the fraction field, too:
  

```sage
sage: P.<X, Y> = QQ[]
sage: F.<x,y> = P.fraction_field()
sage: x
X
```


I think we should have a similar behavior there as well. What do you think? Should I open another ticket for this? Shall I open another ticket for that?

I am not convinced we should change it for the fraction field since it is just writing the original integral domain as fractions essentially in a formal sense. A key distinction between here is there is a unique fraction field but there are many (typically infinite) localizations. It would likely allowing writing elements in `QQ` different than elements in `ZZ`.

I agree as it's not an entirely new option. It is an already existing option to declare separate variables. But currently these are displayed as the original ones. So we would change the existing behavior of a core functionality.
