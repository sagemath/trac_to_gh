- Added gitpod badge to trac tickets:
  Image `https://img.shields.io/badge/-Gitpod-908a85?logo=gitpod`
  Link `https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/tree/<branch>`
- #33450 Improve vs code config
- #33589 Gitpod: track remote trac branch
- #33739 Migrate gitpod to conda
- #33613 Gitpod: Install git-trac-command
- #34255 docker 

- Prebuild of `develop` branch is not available (probably because the prebuild of the develop branch still uses the old docker image)

- #32753 Prefer Linux package manager over linuxbrew (or remove linuxbrew from the Docker image)

- in the terminal, viewing graphics silently does nothing

```
sage: polytopes.cube().show()
Launched html viewer for Graphics3d Object
sage: polytopes.regular_polygon(5).show()
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 7 graphics primitives
```

- The scipy folks have some good documentation and configuration (​https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/contributor/quickstart_gitpod.html), perhaps we can lift something from there.

- Link to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks

- Link to https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/browser-settings

- Remove popup notifications:
  - "Snooty language server is not installed or out of date."

- Extensions for:
  - Cython
  - autoconf

- #33354: Prebuild documentation in a way that incremental docbuilds are fast (ticket:33103#comment:101); perhaps best done after #29868 (`pip`-installable packages `sagemath-doc-html` etc.)

- Add instruction on how to display build docs:
  - `python3 -m http.server --directory ./local/share/doc/sage/html/ 8001`
  - https://www.gitpod.io/docs/languages/html and https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-ports
  - Should we start this sever automatically and display the build docs in a vscode browser tab?
