We get

```
sage: Matrix(SR, [[1, 1]]).solve_left(vector(SR, [2, 3]))                                                                                                    
(2)
```
which is wrong. This works for matrices over `QQ` as we can see by

```
sage: Matrix([[1, 1]]).solve_left(vector([2, 3]))

Thank you for your patch and for doing this so fast. This looks almost good to me.
1. I've added a small easy patch myself to handle subrings of the symbolic ring as well. 
2. I commented on the examples where no check is performed, so that it clearly states that the result is wrong in this case.

Everything else is fine for me. Patchbot not yet done. Please cross-review my changes.
