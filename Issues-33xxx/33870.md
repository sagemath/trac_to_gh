But "dummy package" is a package type. 

More seriously it seems that the last two lines are also auto-generated, and not suitable for a dummy package. 

```
...
nix:

$ nix-env --install sage
void:

$ sudo xbps-install  sagemath
See https://repology.org/project/sagemath/versions

However, these system packages will not be used for building Sage 
because spkg-configure.m4 has not been written for this package; see trac ticket #27330
```

So these dummy packages really should be treated separately. But for this, later.

There is a typo:

```
See <../reference/spkg/index.html>`_ for the names of packages ...
```
Missing apostrophe?
