We use a heap to replace a loop searching for the vertex with smallest index and count 0 with a pop operation. The change is safe as it does not modify the order in which vertices are considered. This way, the generator is no longer quadratic.

Before (with #33579)

```
sage: %time T = graphs.RandomTree(10, seed=0)
CPU times: user 380 µs, sys: 84 µs, total: 464 µs
Wall time: 448 µs
sage: %time T = graphs.RandomTree(100, seed=0)
CPU times: user 1.44 ms, sys: 118 µs, total: 1.56 ms
Wall time: 1.57 ms
sage: %time T = graphs.RandomTree(1000, seed=0)
CPU times: user 46.1 ms, sys: 2.34 ms, total: 48.5 ms
Wall time: 47.1 ms
sage: %time T = graphs.RandomTree(10000, seed=0)
CPU times: user 2.75 s, sys: 14.8 ms, total: 2.77 s
Wall time: 2.78 s
```
After

```
