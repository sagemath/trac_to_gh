What's given in `src/bin/sage-notebook` in this regard:

```
      sage -n default port=1234
      sage -n -- port=1234      # equivalent
      sage -n port=1234         # ERROR: invalid notebook name
```
is obsolete and wrong. Correct syntax is

```
      sage -n --port=1234
```

As reported on https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/eZmwAUhAI6s/m/sSP-QmdrCQAJ
(the option name is `--port`, as expected)
