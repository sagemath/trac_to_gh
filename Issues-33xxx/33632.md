Keywords: FindStat

It may be desirable to compute the generating functions of the first few levels only, when computation of the statistic is very expensive.  This ticket adds an appropriate parameter:

```
sage: st = findstat("graphs", lambda G: G.size(), max_values=100)
sage: st.generating_functions(max_values=18)
{1: 1,
 2: q + 1,
 3: q^3 + q^2 + q + 1,
 4: q^6 + q^5 + 2*q^4 + 3*q^3 + 2*q^2 + q + 1}
```
