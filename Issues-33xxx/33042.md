The linbox team has recently released new versions of their packages: givaro-4.2.0, fflas-ffpack-2.5.0, linbox-1.7.0, which some cutting-edge distributions are already shipping: https://repology.org/project/givaro/versions

Unfortunately our spkg-configure for `givaro` only checks a lower version bound, not an upper bound. We do not have an `spkg-configure` for `linbox` - that's #29631; so we try to build an old `linbox` with a new `givaro`, which fails (upstream does not support this).
Hence these new, incompatible releases retroactively break released Sage versions.

This leads to build errors in our `linbox` spkg, such as  
- https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/seTJ79k33Ac/m/wr4kbNAhDQAJ
- https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/3b_sh9htMg0/m/ft4DZsmpCwAJ

A workaround for users of released versions of Sage is to use `./configure --without-system-givaro`.
