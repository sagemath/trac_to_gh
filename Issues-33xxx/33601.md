As discussed in #33309#comment:28, we add Furo (https://pradyunsg.me/furo/) as a possible theme for the documentation.
After gaining some experience with it, the goal would be to make it the default theme for sage's docs.

To test, run

```
make furo
make doc-clean; make doc-uninstall; make
```

To go back to the classic sage theme, uninstall furo using `./sage -pip uninstall furo`.

Known issues (to be fixed as follow-ups/upstream):
- Reference manual index page and many sub-pagaes don't have a table of contents on the left https://516dfe85b21eafae4f042320e5dcf61ad14fe780--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/reference/
- Index page is missing/not working https://516dfe85b21eafae4f042320e5dcf61ad14fe780--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/
- sage logo in the side bar should link to the top of the Sage manuals

There are still some problems with the reference and tutorial (something with static directories that are not found, any help appreciated), but the developer doc seems to work fine already. Feedback welcome!

Question: Is it correct that one has to add each dependency in the dependency tree as a sage package?

Yes if you make `furo` a "normal" package as in your current branch.
You can avoid it by making it a "pip" package instead.

Okay thanks. From the docs it was not clear to me when to choice pip packages over normal ones. I made furo now a pip package and it seems to work. 

I've also activated for the doc build github action, so it be visible there in a couple of hours.

This seems to force furo theme when the optional furo package is installed.

Wouldn't it be possible to make it such that `sage --doc-build --theme=furo` works so that we can choose either `furo` or `classic` (default `classic` yet)?

I'm not sure if this complexity is needed. We can just expand the scope of the ticket to make furo the new theme (hence furo will have to be a standard package). People can already look at the product thanks to Tobias's deployment script - there's no need for people to try it out by compiling it themselves. 

So I'd suggest to just announce it for discussion on sage-devel to gauge people's opinion on it and then to make a decision.

I think this is not possible at the moment. Furo always links to [root_doc](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-root_doc), which is also responsible for the toctree shown in the sidebar and thus cannot easily be changed. I'll open an feature request at furo.

Before furo could replace the current sage-classic theme completely, it should have all functions of the current theme. At present, it has problems in navigating through all sage documentation through the sidebar (that takes the function of the top navigation bar of sage-classic) and the logo. There are other problems and more may be found later. 

I guess these problems would be difficult to solve without customizing the furo theme for sage. If so (and the license permits), then we should have `src/doc/common/themes/sage-furo` along with the current `sage-classic`. Then it is only natural that we have a configuration option to choose a theme among them. Eventually, when we are comfortable with the new theme, we can change the default theme.

Furo is open source so we can easily contribute features that we need so that also other developers could profit from it. In this way, we also don't create issues with maintaining customized theme templates and keeping them up-to-date with upstream changes.

I think the `--theme=furo` switch would make sense if we intend to support multiple themes in the future (or for a longer time), but as it currently looks like furo is mostly compatible with our needs and thus can be the default for the github action as of 9.7 and then go live with 9.8 (or 9.7 depending on the state) in my opinion.
