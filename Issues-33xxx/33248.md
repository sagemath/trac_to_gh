Doctesting `src/sage/features/interfaces.py`
fails for me with a timeout.

```
sage: from sage.features.interfaces import Mathematica
sage: Mathematica().is_present()
```

In this ticket we mark the example
`# not tested` to skip it in doctests.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Mathematica is installed on that machine
but requires a password or token to start.

Running `math` in a shell session goes:

```
$ math
Mathematica 12.1.1 Kernel for Linux x86 (64-bit)
Copyright 1988-2020 Wolfram Research, Inc.

Mathematica 12.1.1 Kernel cannot find a valid password.

For automatic Web Activation enter your activation key
(enter return to skip Web Activation):
```

This is likely what makes the feature detection hang.
