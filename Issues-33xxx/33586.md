`polyhedral_complex` creates a geometric polyhedral complex corresponding to the triangulation.

`boundary_simplicial_complex` and `boundary_polyhedral_complex` are combinations of `boundary` (which gives a set of simplices) with `simplicial_complex` (which gives an abstract simplicial complex) and `polyhedral_complex`, respectively
