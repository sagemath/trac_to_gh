```diff
+        - ``ncpus`` - (default: ``None``) If not ``None``, a positive integer
```

The second `-` is missing (this line appears at least 2 times).

There is also no `;` after `)`, but this whole situation is difficult, as the `INPUT` block is written in full sentences. So maybe just leave it like this.
