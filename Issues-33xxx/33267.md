```
sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['a', 'b', 'c'])
sage: %timeit F._sum_of_monomials(['a','b','b'])
2.12 µs ± 16 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
sage: %timeit F.sum_of_terms([('a',2), ('c',3)])
1.38 µs ± 26.9 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)
```
versus before

```
sage: %timeit F._sum_of_monomials(['a','b','b'])
8.11 µs ± 21.6 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
sage: %timeit F.sum_of_terms([('a',2), ('c',3)])
5.1 µs ± 20.5 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
```
So we get ~4x speedup on these small examples. Likely this will improve the speed across a number of methods as these two methods are used somewhat frequently.

This bit,

```python
    for index, coeff in index_coeff_pairs:
        if index in result:
            result[index] += coeff
        else:
            result[index] = coeff
    return remove_zeros(result)
```

makes several passes through `result` looking for `index`. Given that we're going to remove the zeros at the end anyway, would it be any faster to initialize the `result` with zeros, so that we can add unconditionally? Or to try `result[index] += coeff` and only do `result[index] = coeff` if a `KeyError` is thrown?

Initializing zeros would only be better in cases that are highly dense, which is fairly rare IMO. Suppose we are working in the exterior algebra of rank `n`, which has dimension 2<sup>n</sup>. If we simply want to work with 20 terms for a computation (not an unlikely scenario in rank 10). Then we have to fill all 1024 possible entries of this dict, which we then afterwards have to check for 0 (iterating over everything, which is not so good for a `dict`) and filter most of those out.

Now I did think about catching the `KeyError`, but I am assuming the most likely scenario is most of the terms are unique and `index` is not in the `dict. In small scale testing:

```
sage: def t1():
....:     d = {}
....:     try:
....:         d[5] += 1
....:     except KeyError:
....:         d[5] = 1
....:         
sage: def t2():
....:     d = {}
....:     if 5 in d:
....:         d[5] += 1
....:     else:
....:         d[5] = 1
....:         
sage: %timeit t1()
729 ns ± 0.982 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)
sage: %timeit t2()
478 ns ± 20.7 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)
```
If I instead replace `5` with `ind = (1,2,3)`, I get

```
sage: %timeit t1()
929 ns ± 7.51 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)
sage: %timeit t2()
656 ns ± 1.84 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)
```
This is why I settled on this.

Something I have thought a bit about is having a sparse and dense version of `CFM` (and bring its implementation much closer `FreeModule`). However, that would likely be a major project. Perhaps I should propose that as a GSoC project... So the dense case would become useful for those that want it (or "small" dimensional algebras). That's for later though.

Ok, it does what it says. I've been testing it on my own CFM code with no problems.

One more nitpick: in `sum_of_terms`, you mention that the argument can be any iterable, but

```python
cpdef dict sum_of_monomials(monomials, scalar):
    r"""
    Return the pointwise addition of ``monomials``.

    INPUT:

    - ``monomials`` -- a list of indices representing the monomials
```

only mentions a list. I think an iterable would work there too? Not a big deal.

I also spent some time trying to figure out how to remove the double-loop from `remove_zeros()`. The best I could come up with is to use a dict comprehension like `{ index: D[index] for index in D if D[index] }`, but that creates a new dict so it's not guaranteed to be any faster.

I fixed it. Since it is a trivial change, I am allowing myself to set this back to a positive review. Feel free to revert if you disagree.

That would be bad when there are very few zeros, but say the `dict` is really big. I feel that is a more common scenario than having a lot of zeros, and a list is cheaper to create I believe. There will always be a scenario that behaves badly for whichever implementation unfortunately. So IMO we just have to chose the one which seems least likely to occur.
