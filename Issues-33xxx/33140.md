Filtering by `$targets_pattern` is broken, so the jobs for  experimental packages do too much work.

see for example https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/4752780943?check_suite_focus=true, which was supposed to only build packages starting with `0-g`, but `TARGETS_OPTIONAL=scipoptsuite modular_decomposition awali gdb deformation cocoalib surf gambit libtheora lie gap3 valgrind qepcad`.

We also update some `tox.ini` settings for macos.
