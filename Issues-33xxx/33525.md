That doctest will not pass in the current implementation (and I am not sure it should) as `B = Z[‘t’]` and `R._poly_ring == Z[‘T’]`, where `Z = Integers(125)` and we do not allow coercion between polynomial rings with different variable names IIRC. I don’t see an equivalent doctest in the old code. Why should this doctest work? I would have expected it to be from `Z`.

Some comments for possible optimizations for general modernization (feel free to push them to a followup ticket, which I can do):

- In `_mul_`, it will never be the case that the first check is true by the coercion framework. I also believe the `todo` with the recast is also a no-op and can be removed once the cast is done in the parent.
- If a matrix is hard-coded and then an inverse taken, why don’t we just hard-code the inverse?
- `__repr__` to `_repr_` in the parent.
- `gens()` should return a tuple and it can be cached. Although, IIRC, this is taken care of automatically if `gen()` is implemented instead. (It’s better to use `zero()` and `one()` there as well.)
- Why not make `create_element()` an alias of `_element_constructor_()`?
- `@cached_method` the `one()`.
- I know I would appreciate having those long output lines broken over multiple lines, but that is very cosmetic.
- Cythonize the element.
- Use `_poly_ring` instead of `poly_ring()` in the element `__init__` check.
- I don’ think we need the Python2 compatibility `__nonzero__ = __bool__` alias.
- Indentation levels on various `INPUT:` bullet points.

Concerning the coercion test, it seems strange to me that the variable "T" is hardcoded.

About your suggestions, I did what I could. Maybe one can keep the rest for another ticket.
