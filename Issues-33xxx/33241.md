As described in 
https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#contexts-and-start-methods
the default start method of multiprocessing is `spawn` on macOS since Python 3.8, while it is still `fork` for Linux. This yields a error when using parallel computations on macOS systems, as reported in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-support/c/CXGpoAppCDw/m/AYK3y1QvBQAJ.

A workaround is to run

```
import multiprocessing as mp
mp.set_start_method('fork')
```
or possibly `mp.set_start_method('fork', force=True)` (cf. https://groups.google.com/g/sage-support/c/CXGpoAppCDw/m/CN9q93YPAgAJ).
