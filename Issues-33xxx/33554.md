We ensure that method `sage.graphs.graph_coloring.all_graph_colorings` returns only colorings using the prescribed number of colors (if any), and so that method `sage.graphs.graph_coloring. first_coloring` returns a coloring using at least `n` colors, where `n` is a lower bound on the number of colors to use.

---
dear developers,

there is a typo in the documentation of sage.graphs.graph_coloring.first_coloring.
It says
"Given a graph, and optionally a natural number n, returns the first coloring we find with at least n colors"
but it should be "with at most n colors" as otherwise it would not make sence / would be trivial (e.g. one could color each vertex with its own color).

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/graph_coloring.html#sage.graphs.graph_coloring.first_coloring

best regards,
Manfred Scheucher

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

The description of the method is correct.

Here `n` is **not** the number of vertices of the graph but a number of colors.

The method tries first to find a coloring with `n` colors. If no such coloring is found, it tries to find a coloring with `n+1` colors and so on.

edit: I don't know. something appears to be fishy, either with the documentation or the implementation. If you run

```
graph_coloring.first_coloring(graphs.PathGraph(3),3)
```
i.e., coloring the path on 3 vertices with "at least" n=3 colors, one obtains

```
[[0, 2], [1]]
```
but this only involves 2 colors. so this does not make sense.

<div id="comment:5" align="right">Comment 5</div>

This method has been introduced in #1311 and is used only in `sage.graphs.graph.coloring` to get an optimal coloring. 
Parameter `n` is used as a lower bound on the number of colors. 

We can:
- clarify the documentation to make it clear that it is a lower bound
- fix method `all_graph_colorings` to ensure that it returns (or count) only colorings with at least `n` colors.

Do you agree ?
