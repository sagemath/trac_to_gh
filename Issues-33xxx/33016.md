This function leaks in via `sage.interfaces.all`.

Since it is being used in doctest, we import it properly through `sage.repl.all`.

I have used this function only for testing. But it seems people use get_display_manager to set display preferences in jupyter. It would be inconvenient if it should be imported first from an obscure place.
