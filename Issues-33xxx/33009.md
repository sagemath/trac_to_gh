This also cleans some code duplication introduced in #27689, as obtaining the dual of a combinatorial polyhedron is fast:

```
sage: %time P = polytopes.hypercube(7)
CPU times: user 31.4 ms, sys: 182 µs, total: 31.6 ms
Wall time: 29.7 ms
sage: %time P.polar()
CPU times: user 25 ms, sys: 7.85 ms, total: 32.8 ms
Wall time: 31.6 ms
A 7-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^7 defined as the convex hull of 14 vertices
sage: C = P.combinatorial_polyhedron()
sage: %time C.polar()
CPU times: user 57 µs, sys: 0 ns, total: 57 µs
Wall time: 58.4 µs
A 7-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron with 128 facets
```
