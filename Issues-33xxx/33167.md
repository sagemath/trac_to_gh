## ------------------------------------------------------- ##
## Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG lrslib... ##
## ------------------------------------------------------- ##
configure:30190: checking whether any of gmp flint is installed as or will be installed as SPKG
configure:30194: result: yes; install lrslib as well
configure:30296: no suitable system package found for SPKG lrslib
```

---

In this ticket, we add to the `is_functional` method a check corresponding to the check made in `build/pkgs/lrslib/spkg-configure.m4` so that if `lrslib` is not picked up by sagemath at configuration/build time, then it is not picked up by sagemath at runtime or during doctests.

This is not the case, I am afraid. I get the same output:

```
sage: from sage.features.lrs import Lrs
sage: Lrs().is_present()
FeatureTestResult('lrslib', True)
sage: Lrs().is_functional()
FeatureTestResult('lrslib', True)
```
My system lrslib seems to be mostly functional, as all the doctests apart from #33101 pass. But it is rejected by the .m4 file because of the dependency on flint – my Sage builds its own flint, so would also build its own lrslib.

This is probably a mistake in the `spkg-configure.m4` for lrslib. If all we do is run the executables from lrslib, we don't care if they're linked to a mismatched version of flint/gmp.

Yes, this seems to be the case. I have removed the check for gmp/flint from the .m4 file. Now it works as I would expect – this is the relevant output of configure:

```
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG lrslib...
checking for lrsnash... lrsnash
checking whether lrsnash can handle the new input format... yes
configure: will use system package and not install SPKG lrslib
```
This is the first time I have edited an .m4 file, so I hope I did not break anything.

Besides that, I have removed a `print` call from the `is_functional` check which was probably not intended in the first place.

It looks like you deleted the `DEPCHECK` line and its matching `])`, and then un-indented the stuff between? That should be right.

m4 and the `./configure` script are all "stringly typed," so really the only way we have of testing is to run `./configure` in every configuration and watch the output.

Yes, exactly.

For another data point, I have tested this by replacing the lrsnash binary by a non-functional one, which also leads to the intended result:

```
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG lrslib...
checking for lrsnash... lrsnash
checking whether lrsnash can handle the new input format... no
configure: no suitable system package found for SPKG lrslib
```

Yeah, just about anything can go wrong. Another example:

```
sage: from sage.features.imagemagick import ImageMagick
sage: ImageMagick().is_functional()
...
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'convert'
```

Or with a dangling symlink from graphicsmagick,

```
...
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'convert'
```

These aren't normal scenarios, but if there's no way to disable the check, the test suite can't crash whenever e.g. someone installs a broken tool in `/usr/local/bin`.
