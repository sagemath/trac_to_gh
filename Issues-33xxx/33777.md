Sage's CHomP interface is out of date: the executables now have different names and may use a different syntax. Also, CHomP has not been updated recently — the most recent changes at https://github.com/marciogameiro/CHomP (see also http://chomp.rutgers.edu/software.html) are 5 years ago — and it doesn't build on OS X. I'm not sure about other platforms. It used to be the case that CHomP was necessary for certain calculations, such as finding generators of homology groups, but Sage can now do all of that on its own. So let's deprecate the CHomP interface to Sage.

<a id='comment:8'></a>An update with the `lite` version of `CHomP` and two simplicial complexes: `K = simplicial_complexes.NotIConnectedGraphs(6,2)` and `TxT`, the product of a torus with itself:

- Sage:

```
sage: %time TxT.homology()
CPU times: user 4min 9s, sys: 6.15 s, total: 4min 15s
Wall time: 5min 20s
{0: 0, 1: Z x Z x Z x Z, 2: Z^6, 3: Z x Z x Z x Z, 4: Z}

sage: %time K.homology()
CPU times: user 5.2 s, sys: 105 ms, total: 5.3 s
Wall time: 8.67 s
{0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: Z^24, 8: 0, 9: 0, 10: 0}
```

- CHomP (after exporting the complexes to text files `blah.simp`):

```
% time ./build/bin/chomp-simplicial ~/Desktop/TxT.simp
Betti Numbers: 1 4 6 4 1 
./build/bin/chomp-simplicial ~/Desktop/TxT.simp  0.14s user 0.00s system 95% cpu 0.146 total

% time ./build/bin/chomp-simplicial ~/Desktop/K.simp 
Betti Numbers: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 24 0 0 0 
./build/bin/chomp-simplicial ~/Desktop/K.simp  474.19s user 13.71s system 84% cpu 9:35.93 total
```
So the timing is not consistent: `TxT` is much slower in Sage, `K` is much slower in `CHomP`.

Maybe one can build CHomP on macOS with "real" gcc/g++, not with Clang.
Anyway, it's written in an old dialect of C++ it sees, so its future is not looking good.

The \"lite\" version works, at least on OS X, but has limited functionality: it builds executables for simplicial complexes and cubical complexes, but not chain complexes. The simplicial complex stuff works, but I don't understand the cubical part. There is limited documentation: the only thing I can find is the `README.md` at https://github.com/shaunharker/CHomP. (See also https://github.com/shaunharker/CHomP/issues/6.) As a result, I don't understand the provided examples. The README says \"File format: a list of new-line separated d-tuples, where d is the dimension of the cubical complex, and the tuples represent d-dimensional cubes which will be added to the complex (along with all of their faces)\".

<a id='comment:13'></a>Here is the situation: CHomP is currently broken. The "lite" version works, at least on OS X, but has limited functionality: it builds executables for simplicial complexes and cubical complexes, but not chain complexes. The simplicial complex stuff works, but I don't understand the cubical part. There is limited documentation: the only thing I can find is the `README.md` at https://github.com/shaunharker/CHomP. (See also https://github.com/shaunharker/CHomP/issues/6.) As a result, I don't understand the provided examples. The README says "File format: a list of new-line separated d-tuples, where d is the dimension of the cubical complex, and the tuples represent d-dimensional cubes which will be added to the complex (along with all of their faces)". I propose that either I am missing something or this just makes no sense.

```
Example: (Annulus-like shape made out of squares)

(0, 1)
(0, 2)
(1, 0)
(1, 2)
(2, 0)
(2, 1)
(2, 2)
```
So maybe `(0,1)` represents a square (2-dimensional cube) with lower left corner at `(0,1)`? But then how do you construct a mix of cubes of different dimensions? Or how do you construct the cubical complex which consists of just the four faces of a square?

I think we have a few choices:

1. Try to figure out what `chomp-cubical` is supposed to do. I am not really interested in doing this.

2. Implement a pared-down version of the `CHomP` interface just for `chomp-simplicial`, removing everything else (since it just doesn't work).

3. Deprecate/remove the interface completely. Note that the end of the `README.md` file says "I do not have much time to spend on maintenance of this project unfortunately."

4. I suppose someone could take over maintenance of the project. That is not in my wheelhouse.

Opinions?
