it's a relatively frequent complaint that e.g. on WSL our notebook does not work by default, due to issues with file access, see e.g. https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_core/issues/191

we add the config parameter that avoids, by default, temporary files.

I guess these are ways to do the same thing - one can (if it works)  to use a url like `file://` as opposed to `https://` - and the latter seems to be more robust.
