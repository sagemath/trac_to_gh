Most of the CI infrastructure runs already on Github actions. For a full migration from the patchbot to github actions, the following checks need to be migrated:
- Build and run doctests: Done.
- commit_messages: Not needed. Git doesn't allow empty messages.
- coverage: replaced by codecov #33355
- deprecation_number: if the code contains a deprecation warning, the ticket number in the deprecation should match the actual ticket number. **Not yet implemented in Github Actions.**
- python3: looks for some patterns in a python or rst file.
    - `xrange` (not valid in python3)
    - `.iterkeys`, `.itervalues`, `.iteritems` (not valid in python3)
    - `basestring` (not valid in python3)
    - `__nonzero__`  (not valid in python3)
  No need to implement in Github Actions.
- python3_pyx: looks for some patterns in a cython file
    - `import six` and `from six import` 
  Done via relint #30467
- pyflakes: replaced by pyright #33456, refs #30415
- pycodestyle: Done
- blocks: checks for the blocks:
    - correct syntax is `.. SEEALSO::` (done via relint #30467)
    - `TESTS` and `EXAMPLES` should be plural, `NOTE` singular (done via relint #30467)
    - no `::` after `INPUT` and `OUTPUT` blocks (done via relint #30467)
    - no `::` after `REFERENCE` blocks (done via relint #30467)
    - no ` :` at the end of lines (seems discarded in #30467)
    - no `Returns` at the start of lines (seems discarded in #30467)
- triple_colon: looks for the presence of triple colons `:::` or `: ::`. Done via relint #30467.
- trac_links: looks for the presence of badly formatted trac roles `:trac:`, missing the initial colon. Done via relint #30467.
- startup_time: measures the time to startup sage (the time to the prompt). **Not yet implemented in Github Actions.**
- startup_modules: the number of modules imported at startup. **Not yet implemented in Github Actions.**
- docbuild: Done
- git_rev_list: No need to implement in Github Actions.

Above list should be merged into https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/patchbot/plugins

<a id='comment:27'></a>A typical example of `git_rev_list`:

It just shows the information about the changed files and new commits that you can get from git by comparing the base tree and the ticket tree. Not very useful.
