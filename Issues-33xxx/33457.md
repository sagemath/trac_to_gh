Most of the CI infrastructure runs already on Github actions. For a full migration from the patchbot to github actions, the following checks need to be migrated:
- Build and run doctests: Done.
- commit_messages: Not needed. Git doesn't allow empty messages.
- coverage: replaced by codecov #33355
- deprecation_number: if the code contains a deprecation warning, the ticket number in the deprecation should match the actual ticket number. **Not yet implemented in Github Actions.**
- python3: looks for some patterns in a python or rst file.
    - `xrange` (not valid in python3)
    - `.iterkeys`, `.itervalues`, `.iteritems` (not valid in python3)
    - `basestring` (not valid in python3)
    - `__nonzero__`  (not valid in python3)
  No need to implement in Github Actions.
- python3_pyx: looks for some patterns in a cython file
    - `import six` and `from six import` 
  Done via relint #30467
- pyflakes: replaced by pyright #33456, refs #30415
- pycodestyle: Done
- blocks: checks for the blocks:
    - correct syntax is `.. SEEALSO::` (done via relint #30467)
    - `TESTS` and `EXAMPLES` should be plural, `NOTE` singular (done via relint #30467)
    - no `::` after `INPUT` and `OUTPUT` blocks (done via relint #30467)
    - no `::` after `REFERENCE` blocks (done via relint #30467)
    - no ` :` at the end of lines (seems discarded in #30467)
    - no `Returns` at the start of lines (seems discarded in #30467)
- triple_colon: looks for the presence of triple colons `:::` or `: ::`. Done via relint #30467.
- trac_links: looks for the presence of badly formatted trac roles `:trac:`, missing the initial colon. Done via relint #30467.
- startup_time: measures the time to startup sage (the time to the prompt). **Not yet implemented in Github Actions.**
- startup_modules: the number of modules imported at startup. **Not yet implemented in Github Actions.**
- docbuild: Done
- git_rev_list: No need to implement in Github Actions.

Above list should be merged into https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/patchbot/plugins

A typical example of `git_rev_list`:

https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/31892/Darwin/Darwin%20Kernel%20Version%2021.2.0:%20Sun%20Nov%2028%2020:28:54%20PST%202021;%20root:xnu-8019.61.5~1/RELEASE_X86_64/x86_64/21.2.0/steenrod/2022-08-08%2005:08:06?plugin=git_rev_list&diff=/log/0/Darwin/Darwin%20Kernel%20Version%2021.2.0%3A%20Sun%20Nov%2028%2020%3A28%3A54%20PST%202021%3B%20root%3Axnu-8019.61.5~1/RELEASE_X86_64/x86_64/21.2.0/steenrod/2022-08-16%2020%3A34%3A40&ticket=31892&base=9.7.beta8

It just shows the information about the changed files and new commits that you can get from git by comparing the base tree and the ticket tree. Not very useful.
