I don't think this needs both `# random` and `...`, otherwise LGTM:

well, random is necessary for the first line of the doctest, I think (but maybe not). The dots cut out some non-essential part of the output, which contain no information. But sure, I could put that part back.

I'm not picky about it, but my view of the `# random` tag is that it allows you to show the user non-deterministic examples with the understanding that "you'll see something that looks like this, but maybe not exactly this."

It's hard to maintain (nothing fails if the output changes), but I don't have a better idea for the `EXAMPLES` block.
