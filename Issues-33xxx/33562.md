H.weighted(True)
H.weighted_adjacency_matrix()
```
should give something useful, but instead is an inexplicable error message

```
TypeError: NoneType takes no arguments
```
This happens whether or not this graph is said to be weighted.  There should be an error catch for a useful message.

sure, but we're talking about the adjacency matrix with the edge labels put at their respective places.
