should give something useful, but instead is an inexplicable error message

```

This happens whether or not this graph is said to be weighted.  There should be an error catch for a useful message.

It's not the only undesirable behavior of methods using `weighted`.

```

OK, rebased over the latest beta. Looks good.

By the way, edge weights are allowed to be ring elements, e.g. `SR`, or polynomial rings. So it's OK as far as I am concerned - but of course doing any kind of e.g. shortest path computation (anything that assumes that weights are comparable with `<`) on such graphs makes little sense.
