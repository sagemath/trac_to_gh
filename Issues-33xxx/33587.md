```
Parts of our documentation (`README.md`, `src/doc/en/faq/faq-usage.rst`) recommend to use `export MAKE="make -j4 -l5.5"` or similar.

Other parts of the documentation recommend to add `V=0` to a `make` command line.

If one combines both, putting `V=0` inside the environment variable `MAKE`, one gets mysterious errors such as `/bin/sh: `@`cd: command not found`.

The same error also occurs when using `export V=0` (as recommended in README.md) and then running `./sage -b`.

<a id='comment:5'></a>
Slightly differently, after

```
export MAKE="make -j16"
export V=0
```
The command `./sage -br` fails with the same error:

```
/bin/sh: @cd: command not found
```
Unsetting `V` eliminates the problem.

This is on [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) 9.6.rc1.
