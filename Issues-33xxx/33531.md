- Later in #31103 some code was added at the end of `src/bin/sage-runtests` to run pytest (see [719e442](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/719e442e5d3a3eaadab28bc835b68d46a4a2d12d))
- This code is broken in many ways, some that have been fixed (#32892) and some that have not (#31924, also #31924#comment:23)
- The bug in #31924 is a PITA and the only way to avoid it is to patch out the code that runs pytest in `sage-runtests
- Result is: if pytest is not installed, we get an annoying warning that induces to install it, but if pytest is installed then doctesting is broken (as in we get scary warnings at the end and a non-zero exit code, on top of a 3s overhead)

My proposal:
- add a feature flag "pytest" and make running pytest conditional to that
- do NOT add pytest to the default flags until all issues are fixed and it is known to work ok (at the very least #31924 should be fixed)

In fact pytest should only run when there's some file `*_test.py` in the list of files, and only in those files. I think DC already traversed the filesystem in search of files, so instead of having pytest traverse the filesystem again, just filter the list of files that DC obtained for `*_test.py` and run pytest just on those and only if there's some.

Even if/after pytest integration is fixed, there are advantages to place it behind a feature flag so there's an easy way to run doctests skipping pytest (just add `--optional=sage` or whatever else one wants to test, leaving out `pytest`)

And here's the commit, ready for review.

Once pytest is working reliably, `"pytest"` can be added to the list of default features in `_get_optional_defaults()` so it's run by default. In any case using e.g. `--optional=sage` will skip running pytest.

The long term goal is to use pytest also for run the doctests (completely removing sage's custom doctest runner). So I don't like to introduce switches that differentiate between doctests and "pytests".

The error that occurs while testing the all module should be fixed with #30748 (ready for review for months).

Maybe pytest is installed because it's needed for another purpose. In my case, sage uses system python packages and pytest was installed in the system for whatever reason. I don't even remember, but it's kind of surprising (and annoying) that doctesting breaks because of that.

My proposal is to make the choice to run pytest explicit rather than implicit because one just happens to have pytest installed, at least while you are developing it.

If/when that happens, this will be easy to re evaluate.

> The error that occurs while testing the all module should be fixed with #30748 (ready for review for months).


That's just one random example. Doctesting  any files is broken, since the logic in sage-runtests will always call pytest with all given arguments rather than only the files that need to be run by pytest.

It looks to me independent. That ticket doesn't seem to touch the logic in sage-runtests.

But these are not "little issues", they actually break `sage -t` unless I patch out the code that runs pytest at the end of `sage-runtests`. Worse: this will go unnoticed if one works in a box where pytest is not installed, only to break when working in a box where pytest happens to be installed.

It's absolutely crucial that one can pass individual files to `sage -t`. When one asks it to doctest a file that is NOT using pytest, it should NOT call pytest at all.

> Thus, I'm not a big fan of hiding pytest behind two switches.

All I'm asking is for ONE switch to run pytest. I suggested that it defaults to OFF while all the "little issues" are ironed out, and that it could default to ON later.

Also:
a. running pytest on a file with no pytests adds a completely unnecessary 3s overhead.
b. running pytest on a directory scans the whole tree again, but DC has already scanned the tree.
c. e.g. doctesting sage.doctest.test ranges between "broken" and "takes 2x time" when pytest is installed.

If the current standing is that `*_test.py` files go through pytest, the rest of files go through DC, can't you get the list of files from DC, filter out the ones ending in `_test.py` and just pass those to pytest?

I'm running with undef `SAGE_ROOT` which makes `SAGE_SRC=SAGE_LIB` (normally the python site-packages).

After #33521, this means pytest is never run, so the issue is gone 👍️.

OTOH, if I actually set `SAGE_SRC` to point to the actual sage source, pytest breaks with the following error:

```
pluggy._manager.PluginValidationError: Plugin '/home/tornaria/src/sage/sage-git/src/conftest.py' for hook 'pytest_collect_file'
hookimpl definition: pytest_collect_file(file_path: 'Path', parent: 'pytest.File') -> 'pytest.Collector | None'
Argument(s) {'file_path'} are declared in the hookimpl but can not be found in the hookspec
```
This may be because pytest is too old in void linux (6.2.5, instead of 7.x).

If I comment out the definition of `pytest_collect_file` in `src/conftest.py` then it works with an exception I document below.

However, I couldn't help but notice that pytest will use a single thread to run, which is a HUGE regression if tests start migrating from the sage doctest framework to pytest !!! Right now running pytest through all these 9 files takes 80s, while the doctest step in --long --all mode takes just 312s wall time (using 36 threads).

---

Out of all the files `*_test.py` in sage source tree (9 files), the only one that fails to pytest is `sage/structure/sage_object_test.py` which gives me the following error:

```
=================================================================================== ERRORS ===================================================================================
____________________________________________________________ ERROR collecting sage/structure/sage_object_test.py _____________________________________________________________
ImportError while importing test module '/home/tornaria/src/sage/sage-git/src/sage/structure/sage_object_test.py'.
Hint: make sure your test modules/packages have valid Python names.
Traceback:

    from .sage_object import SageObject
E   ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package
========================================================================== short test summary info ===========================================================================
```
This goes away if I change the import to be absolute (`sage.structure.sage_object`), but then no items are collected from this file, I'm not sure that's expected.

I have added a comment to #33546 and opened #33783.

Maybe Tobias could comment on the pytest version needed?

Rather, that we can close this ticket since #33521 made the issue go away, there's nothing left to merge here, and you picked up the other issues in new tickets (thanks).

I don't think I can actually close the ticket though. Can you?

Yes, that's what positive review with the milestone "sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix" indicates. It's not really necessary to remove the branch; it won't be accidentally merged.
