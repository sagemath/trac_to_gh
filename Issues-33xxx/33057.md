The `Q.solve_integer(n)` method of a binary quadratic form finds `x` and `y` such that `Q(x,y) == n` (if they exist), but the doctest erroneously checks whether `Q(x,y) == 0`.

(This error was found by a patchbot testing ticket #30999.)

I also noticed and fixed this in #33026, but since that ticket also contains some more non-trivial changes it seems the best way to proceed is to apply this small patch first.
