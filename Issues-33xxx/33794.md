My guess is that it is not machine dependent but order dependent on the doctests: Something is getting cached with an `int` Instead of an integer, which makes its way into that part of the code. While it doesn’t hurt to do this, it might cover up a slightly deeper problem with not converting inputs to the proper parent (it might also be possible to make this, say, an element of `QQ` instead).

Anyways, for now, green bot => positive review.

Well, since I cannot reproduce the original error, I can only say that this definitely should fix it. Tests pass for me, so I am going to set a positive review.

comment:7: Strange. Perhaps it is related to the number of cores somehow? That would be surprising to me. Do you get the failure when running it more locally, say, on this file or with the folder specifically?

For what it's worth, `__getitem__` barely gets used. I changed the line `__getitem__ = vector_presentation` to

```python
    def __getitem__(self, n, verbose=False):
        print('hello')
        return self.vector_presentation(n, verbose)
```
and there was only one doctest failure when I tested `modules/fp_graded/`:

```
File "src/sage/modules/fp_graded/module.py", line 826, in sage.modules.fp_graded.module.FPModule.vector_presentation
Failed example:

Got:

That makes it seem like it is some kind of caching issue with an `int` getting leaked in somehow through some other code path. Anyways, not serious enough to warrant a deep dive into the code to find it IMO.

>  Python does lookups differently for special methods, and `misc/cachefunc.pyx` has to handle them separately because of this (https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/misc/cachefunc.pyx?h=develop&id=0b4860129e0f686594667be1ad3a3e1073478a56#n3092); I worry that the `__getitem__ = vector_presentation` line bypasses the check done by the decorator.


I don’t think it bypasses it, but this is easy to verify similar to John’s test in [comment:10](#comment%3A10).

> I know nothing about the surrounding code, so I don't know how plausible the above theory is. In any case, I will try removing the `@cached_method` decorator for those two methods and see if it helps on NixOS CI.


I don’t think that is relevant to the bugs at hand as I cannot see any relation. There could potentially be a separate issue with the caching not being done as it should, but that is a performance issue and not a true bug IMO.
