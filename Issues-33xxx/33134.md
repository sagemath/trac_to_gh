Yes, this is the only failing test for me.

I'm not sure what's the purpose of this example/test. It seems to me the simplest thing is to tag it as "# not tested - requires singular >=4.2.1p2".

I'm getting the same as you. I couldn't help but notice that the difference is a multiple of `2^32`. In fact the coefficients we get from singular are just the truncation to `int32_t` of the ones we get from sage.

May be a bug in singular?

We should find what we believe to be the correct answer and record it there.

> Once the bug is fixed in #33178, the test will be brought back with the correct answer and a meaningful explanation.


From my experience, I would be skeptical of it reappearing. This doctest is testing something, but the answer doesn't necessarily reflect that. If we don't trust at least one way of generating the "answer," then the other algorithm should have big warnings attached to it. One other option if we don't trust any output is to add some more information to the discussion before the doctest to warn the user IMO.
