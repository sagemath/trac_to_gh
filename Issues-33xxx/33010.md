Comes with a cmake-based build system now (albeit with no install target), so the autotoolization patches shouldn't be needed. Not sure about the other patches included in the fork, but in case any of them is still needed we might consider to keep them here rather than in an outside fork for transparency.

Needs changes in sagelib for the new `canonical_form` and `find_automorphisms` API.

<a id='comment:17'></a>The latest commit reimplements the old `find_automorphisms` API in a separate header. With this branch Sage builds fine and all tests in `sage.graphs.bliss` pass.

This is a band-aid solution and I don't expect it to be merged as it is, but at least it can be useful for distros that ship an updated bliss until someone looks into porting the cython code properly.

Also, this segfaults when bliss is built with GMP support (which is not the case in Sage), but that might be an upstream issue.

Indeed, the following segfaults when bliss is compiled with GMP:

```
#include <bliss/graph.hh>

int main() {
  bliss::Graph *g = new bliss::Graph(2);
  bliss::Stats s;
  g->canonical_form(s);
  return 0;
}
```
Unfortunately they don't seem to have a bug tracker.
