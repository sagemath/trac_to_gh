In #31559, the Parent-Element framework was implemented for the class `ModularFormsRing`. However, there are still some inconsistencies in the code. For example:

```
sage: M = ModularFormsRing(Gamma0(11), Zmod(5))
sage: A = M.gen_forms(); A
[1 + 12*q^2 + 12*q^3 + 12*q^4 + 12*q^5 + O(q^6),
q - 2*q^2 - q^3 + 2*q^4 + q^5 + O(q^6),
q - 9*q^4 - 10*q^5 + O(q^6)]
sage: A[0].parent()
Modular Forms space of dimension 2 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(11) of weight 2 over Rational Field
```
Notice that the parent of the list element is not a modular form **ring** element and that its base ring is different from the parent.

Instead, I believe that, for better conformity, it would be preferable if the returned forms were instances of `GradedModularFormElement` (the element class of `ModularFormsRing`).

The goal of this ticket is to implement this behavior:

```
sage: A = ModularFormsRing(Gamma0(11), Zmod(5)).gen_forms(); A
[1 + 2*q^2 + 2*q^3 + 2*q^4 + 2*q^5 + O(q^6),
q + 3*q^2 + 4*q^3 + 2*q^4 + q^5 + O(q^6),
q + q^4 + O(q^6)]
sage: A[0].parent()
Ring of Modular Forms for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(11) over Ring of integers modulo 5
```

It might make the code cleaner (and potentially a bit faster because you can use some internal data) to have an `F.change_ring()` method.

Thank you.

Are you also planning on adding a `change_ring()` method to the elements?

Also, little doc tweak:

```diff
-        - ``base_ring`` - a base ring, which should be `\QQ`, `\ZZ`, or the
-        integers mod `p` for some prime `p`.
+        - ``base_ring`` -- a base ring, which should be `\QQ`, `\ZZ`, or the
+          integers mod `p` for some prime `p`
```

Finally, no I'm not going to implement it in this ticket. I just noticed that it isn't yet implemented for modular forms spaces elements. I think that this should be done first in an other ticket. I will open one shortly.

Following a suggestion by Vincent Delecroix:  On [SageMath](SageMath) 9.7.beta3 built for Apple Silicon,
this

```
sage: hecke_series(5, 7, 10000, 5, modformsring=True) # long time (3.4s)
```
(a test taken from ```src/sage/modular/overconvergent/hecke_series.py```)
never returns.

I attach the results of interrupting on macOS 11.6.7 and macOS 12.4.

This did not happen on [SageMath](SageMath) 9.7.beta2.
