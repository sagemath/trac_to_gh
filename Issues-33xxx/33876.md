In #31559, the Parent-Element framework was implemented for the class `ModularFormsRing`. However, there are still some inconsistencies in the code. For example:

```
sage: M = ModularFormsRing(Gamma0(11), Zmod(5))
sage: A = M.gen_forms(); A
[1 + 12*q^2 + 12*q^3 + 12*q^4 + 12*q^5 + O(q^6),
q - 2*q^2 - q^3 + 2*q^4 + q^5 + O(q^6),
q - 9*q^4 - 10*q^5 + O(q^6)]
sage: A[0].parent()
Modular Forms space of dimension 2 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(11) of weight 2 over Rational Field
```
Notice that the parent of the list element is not a modular form **ring** element and that its base ring is different from the parent.

Instead, I believe that, for better conformity, it would be preferable if the returned forms were instances of `GradedModularFormElement` (the element class of `ModularFormsRing`).

The goal of this ticket is to implement this behavior:

```
sage: A = ModularFormsRing(Gamma0(11), Zmod(5)).gen_forms(); A
[1 + 2*q^2 + 2*q^3 + 2*q^4 + 2*q^5 + O(q^6),
q + 3*q^2 + 4*q^3 + 2*q^4 + q^5 + O(q^6),
q + q^4 + O(q^6)]
sage: A[0].parent()
Ring of Modular Forms for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(11) over Ring of integers modulo 5
```

Two little quibbles:

- `Returns` -> `Return`
- Add spaces here as (IMO) it looks better

  ```diff
               [1 + 2*q^2 + 2*q^3 + 2*q^4 + 2*q^5 + O(q^6),
  -            q + 3*q^2 + 4*q^3 + 2*q^4 + q^5 + O(q^6),

In fact, a graded modular form `F` is basically only a dictionnary `{f1 : k1, ..., fn : kn}` where `fi` is a modular form of weight `ki` (for some fixed congruence subgroup and fixed base ring). In other words, we are only varying the weights. So I guess it should be possible to implement a change ring method. I will try something.",

Thanks I will fix this grammar mistake and it indeed looks better.


> I am guessing you cannot assume anything about the different parents of `F` as that ranges over all of the inputs. It might make the code cleaner (and potentially a bit faster because you can use some internal data) to have an `F.change_ring()` method. Although this is not necessary to do here unless you want to do it.

I think it would be possible to implement the method `F.change_ring()` for a graded modular form `F`. In fact, a graded modular form `F` is basically only a dictionnary `{f1 : k1, ..., fn : kn}` where `fi` is a modular form of weight `ki` (for some fixed congruence subgroup and fixed base ring). In other words, we are only varying the weights. So I guess it should be possible to implement a change ring method. I will try something.

Thank you.

Are you also planning on adding a `change_ring()` method to the elements?

Also, little doc tweak:

```diff
-        - ``base_ring`` - a base ring, which should be `\QQ`, `\ZZ`, or the
-        integers mod `p` for some prime `p`.
+        - ``base_ring`` -- a base ring, which should be `\QQ`, `\ZZ`, or the
