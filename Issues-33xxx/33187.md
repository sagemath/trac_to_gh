`fedora-36` (rawhide) just started to use GCC 12, which we reject. (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/4860062925)

On this ticket we change the `spkg-configure.m4` scripts to allow gcc/gfortran 12.
We also add GCC 4.9.x (but not 4.8.x) to the reject list; this compiler was the reason to drop support for `debian-jessie` in #32947.
