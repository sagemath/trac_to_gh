Orders in number fields are currently not unique parents:

```
sage: K.<i> = NumberField(x^2 + 1)
sage: OK = K.order(i)
sage: OK is loads(dumps(OK))
False
sage: K.maximal_order([2, 3]) is K.maximal_order([3, 2])
False
sage: K.maximal_order([2]) is K.maximal_order([2, 2])
False
sage: K.maximal_order([2]) is K.maximal_order([-2])
False
```

Also, maximality of orders is sometimes wrong:

```
sage: OK = K.maximal_order()
sage: (OK & OK).is_maximal()
False
sage: OK = K.maximal_order(2)
sage: OK == K.maximal_order()
True
sage: OK.is_maximal()
False
```

---

Here, we try to do a better job about making orders unique parents by using a unique factory.

Also, we normalize the primes at which we maximize and do not use them anymore to identify the order.

Finally, we keep a more granular cache of maximality assumptions in each order which fixes the above bugs. We still support the old behavior but issue a deprecation warning. Eventually, when creating an order that is maximal at some primes, the default will be `assume_maximal=None`, i.e., we make no assumptions about maximality at other primes.
