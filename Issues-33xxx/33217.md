Reduction modulo ideals in quotient rings does not return unique minimal representatives.

In this example, the ideal `J` in the quotient ring `Q = R/I` contains the element `t^2 - z^2`, so `reduce` should return `0`.

```
sage: R.<T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z> = PolynomialRing(QQ, order='lex')
sage: I = R.ideal([T^2+U^2-1, V^2+W^2-1, X^2+Y^2+Z^2-1])
sage: Q.<t,u,v,w,x,y,z> = R.quotient(I)
sage: J = Q.ideal([u*v-x, u*w-y, t-z])
sage: J.reduce(t^2 - z^2)  # should be 0
w^2*z^2 - w^2 + y^2
sage: J.reduce(t^2 - z^2).lift() in I  # reduction is not unique mod I, i.e. result is not even mathematically unique in Q
False
```
These results do not agree with the documentation:

```
sage: J.reduce?
   ...
   Reduce an element modulo the reduced Groebner basis for this ideal.
   This returns 0 if and only if the element is in this ideal. In any
   case, this reduction is unique up to monomial orders.
   ...
```

The expected behavior would be the same as lifting the ideal `J` to the cover ring `R`, perform reduction there (in terms of the ideal generated by `I` and the lifted generators of `J`) and map the result back to `Q` (by e.g. Thm. 9.19 in [https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/references/index.html#bw1993 [BW1993]]):

```
sage: Q(Q.cover().inverse_image(J).reduce((t^2 - z^2).lift()))  # correct
0
```

Possibly related: #27508, #32291

<a id='comment:3'></a>The equivalent computation in Singular works correctly:

```

> ideal I = t^2+u^2-1, v^2+w^2-1, x^2+y^2+z^2-1;
> qring Q = std(I);
> ideal J = u*v-x, u*w-y, t-z;
> reduce(t^2 - z^2, std(J));
0
```

Also, Singular returns the same Gröbner basis for `J` as Sage does:

```
> std(J);
_[1]=w2z2-w2+y2
_[2]=vy-wx
_[3]=vwz2-vw+xy
_[4]=vwx+w2y-y
_[5]=u-vx-wy
_[6]=t-z
```

```
sage: J.groebner_basis()
[t - z, u - v*x - w*y, v*w*x + w^2*y - y, v*w*z^2 - v*w + x*y, v*y - w*x, w^2*z^2 - w^2 + y^2]
```
So perhaps Gröbner bases in quotient rings can be meaningful, but the implementation of `reduce` in Sage does not handle this case correctly.

<a id='comment:5'></a>The result of `J.groebner_basis()` in the quotient ring is indeed meaningful in the sense that, *when combined with `I.groebner_basis()`* (and only then) one obtains a Gröbner basis of `J` lifted to the cover ring `R`.

More precisely: If `J0`, `I` are ideals in `R` (such that `J = (J0+I)/I`) and if `G0`, `H` are Gröbner bases of `J0+I`, `I`, then in particular the union `G0 ∪ H` is a Gröbner basis of `J0+I`. Therefore, also the union `G ∪ H` is a (possibly non-reduced) Gröbner basis of `J0+I`, where `G` is defined as the reduction of `G0` modulo `I` (as returned by `J.groebner_basis()`).

This is also what Singular does via `kNF` > [kNF2](https://github.com/Singular/Singular/blob/572022cd0bd2d93d436a2d2ed8c5b2c7e3f4f4f1/kernel/GBEngine/kstd2.cc#L3738) > [initS](https://github.com/Singular/Singular/blob/7be1d21a7379ce28be9574c8b6e13800001a7653/kernel/GBEngine/kutil.cc#L7908).

I have fixed this for the `reduce` method of multivariate polynomial ideals in quotient rings. For the `reduce` method of generic quotient ring elements (which does not claim to return minimal results), I have just added a warning about this to the documentation.

You are right. It is better to move this to a subclass. I will try to implement it. Something similar is done in #33237 right now, but probably there is no overlap with multivariate polynomial rings.

> Are there any other methods that will need similar changes (such as `groebner_basis()`)? I don't think so from a quick look, but perhaps you know better.


The `groebner_basis` method works for rings backed by Singular. The more obscure cases like rings over large finite fields or the polydict implementation result in an error:

```
sage: R.<T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z> = PolynomialRing(GF(2147483659), order='lex')
sage: Q.<t,u,v,w,x,y,z> = R.quotient(R.ideal([T^2+U^2-1, V^2+W^2-1, X^2+Y^2+Z^2-1]))
verbose 0 (3837: multi_polynomial_ideal.py, groebner_basis) Warning: falling back to very slow toy implementation.
sage: J = Q.ideal([u*v-x, u*w-y, t-z])
sage: J.groebner_basis()
...
AttributeError: 'QuotientRing_generic_with_category' object has no attribute 'monomial_pairwise_prime'
```
Though, this might be a problem of the quotient ring class rather than the ideal.

No, `J0+I` is actually what I meant, since it is the preimage of `J`, when `J0` is defined as the ideal generated by representatives of generators of `J`. Then `G0 ∪ H` is a Gröbner basis as it is a super set of the Gröbner basis `G0` of `J0+I`.

`J.groebner_basis()` computes the Gröbner basis in terms of `J0+I`, not just `J0` – otherwise it would indeed be a problem.

My understanding is it is because someone (in the future I think, not yet) could have loaded/installed the quotient rings but not the polynomial rings. This removes it as a compile-time dependency IIRC.

Does anyone else have any other comments? I am ready to set this to a positive review (once the patchbot gets around to it).
