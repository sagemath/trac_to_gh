The documentation refers to various source files:

```
$ git grep -E "SAGE_ROOT/(build|src|pkgs)" src/doc
...
src/doc/en/developer/doctesting.rst:  * ``SAGE_ROOT/src/doc/en``
src/doc/en/developer/doctesting.rst:  * ``SAGE_ROOT/src/doc/fr``
src/doc/en/developer/packaging.rst:available packages are the subdirectories of ``SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/``.
src/doc/en/developer/packaging.rst:``SAGE_ROOT/build/bin/sage-spkg``. This script is typically invoked by
src/doc/en/developer/packaging.rst:of each individual package in ``SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs``. In section
...
```
We create a new extlink format for it in `src/sage/misc/sagedoc.py`, 

```
:sage_root:`src/doc/en`
```
which creates links to the corresponding file in https://github.com/sagemath/sage
