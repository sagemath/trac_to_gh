Currently, valuations cannot be computed for non-integral extensions:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 1/3)
sage: K.valuation(2)
2-adic valuation
sage: K.valuation(3)
ValueError
```

To implement this, we should teach the PadicValuationFactory to work with non-monic/non-integral polynomials. Likely, we need another factory layer that normalizes the defining polynomial (e.g., by substituting x with x/p) and then returns (if needed) a MappedValuation. A general solution that also works for function fields would be nice here.
