The "short summary" is only meant to quickly see what files have failing tests, the full error messages are collected under the "Errors" section that is printed before. 

Note that in contrast to sages reporter, pytest doesn't print the errors directly when the tests are executed but collects them and only prints them at the end. See https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#create-your-first-test for an example.
