The "short summary" is only meant to quickly see what files have failing tests, the full error messages are collected under the "Errors" section that is printed before. 

Note that in contrast to sages reporter, pytest doesn't print the errors directly when the tests are executed but collects them and only prints them at the end. See https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#create-your-first-test for an example.

I'm not sure what screen you use, but on my wide-screen laptop I get about 150 chars in the github log per line, so I would say something like 120 should be the max.
