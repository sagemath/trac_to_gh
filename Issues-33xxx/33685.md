`Triangulation` already has a method `normal_cone`, which computes the normal cone of the GKZ polytope that exposes the triangulation.

What is missing is a method to compute regular triangulations, given an element of the normal cone (a weight/lifting vector), computes the regular triangulation (or more generally, subdivision) of the point configuration / polyhedron. 

We implement this as a generalization of `PolyhedralComplex.subdivide`, which will work when it `is_convex`. 

Methods for `Polyhedron`, `PointConfiguration`, and `RationalPolyhedralCone` can then be implemented by delegating to this method.

<a id='comment:25'></a>It is very confusing that “triangulation” is called although often times it is just a subdivision.

Does the function “is regular subdivision” test whether other is a subdivision of self, or the reverse?

I notice that this requirement is specified in the method `as_triangulation`. But then, inside `is_regular_subdivision`, `self.as_triangulation` is called with `check=False`, which doesn't make sense to me.

<a id='comment:29'></a>Example: 
points = [(0,0), (0,2), (2,2), (2,0), (1,3)]. 

`other` is the polyhedral complex whose maximal cells are [the square with the first 4 points as its vertices, the triangle with the last three points as its vertices]

`self` is the polyhedral complex whose maximal cells are [triangle (pt0, pt1, pt4), triangle (pt0, pt4, pt3), triangle (pt1, pt2, pt4)]

`self` is a regular subdivision of points, but not a subdivision of `other`.
