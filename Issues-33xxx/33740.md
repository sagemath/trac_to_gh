We add a conda enviroment that is meant for development, i.e. includes tools that one probably needs while working on sage development such as linters, ssh (for contributing to trac) etc.

Moreover, we extract the conda-related things from `docs/bootstrap` to a new `bootstrap-conda` script in order to simplify the conda workflow (see updated documentation).

Also `jupyter_sphinx` should really be added by adding a `distros/` file, not ad hoc like this.

The issue is not so much to generate the file but how it is used. Running bootstrap requires a few dependencies which however are only specified in the environment file. So its a classical chicken-egg problem. 

Currently this is resolved by requiring the developers to first create a conda env with the necessary tools for `bootstrap`, and then later update the env with all dependencies from the env file. With my proposal the overhead occurs only when dependencies are changed (which then requires to commit the changed env file). Overall this should be less work and more convenient.

> I agree, not a good idea to treat this file different from all other of our files that are generated at bootstrap time. 


The dev environment is special in this respect, since its the only file that you would possibly like to use before the bootstrap.

Mhh, having a conda environment just for the bootstrap would also work. But then one still has to run `conda create sage-dev -f bootstrap-conda-dev.yml`, `bootstrap` and `conda sage-dev update -f environment.yml`.

Having one conda environment config containing all necessary tools for bootstrap, compiling and running sage as well as a few additional dev tools is the most convenient, don't you think so?

I thought that `./bootstrap` recognises whether we're on conda, or not.
If so, it can invoke `bootstrap-conda`+`conda create`.

Otherwise, I'd like to see `./bootstrap` getting an optional argument, `conda`,
to do the calling of `bootstrap-conda`+`conda create` and then proceeding.

Not a good idea. The output of `bootstrap` must not depend on the system configuration. It is packed into the sdist.

With `sh` the script is not working, so I took `bash` as in `doc/bootstrap`. If that needs to be changed, I need help as its beyond my basic shell script knowledge.

It finds things of the form

```
possible bashism in ./bootstrap-conda line 25 (should be VAR="${VAR}foo"):
                    SYSTEM_PACKAGES+=" $PKG_SYSTEM_PACKAGES"
```
I would say the `+=` construction is more readable.

but why do you think that `/bin/bash` is available everwhere? E.g. on macOS it is probably not the case.

It fails. I don't think the two pip command lines can be combined. 

Because of `--no-build-isolation`, the Sage library (`src`) cannot advertise its build dependency, so `pip` cannot possibly know in which order it has to install stuff.

Build isolation shouldn't be an issue since this only decides if pip tries to create a temporary venv or reuses the existing one for the build env, but not what build dependencies to be installed. Could it be that there is some misconfig of the build dependencies?

Anyway, I've reverted this part and would leave it to a new ticket.

Normally the user doesn't need to change the name, and if he does its easy to find on the conda docs how to do this. Thus I don't really see a point in adding an arg that is the same as the default value.

 We add a conda enviroment that is meant for development, i.e. includes tools that one probably needs while working on sage development such as linters, ssh (for contributing to trac) etc.
 
-Moreover, we extract the conda-related things from `docs/bootstrap` to a new `bootstrap-conda` script in order to simplify the conda workflow as follows:
-- install mamba/conda
-- git checkout
-- bootstrap-conda
-- mamba create -n sage-dev -f src/environment-dev.yml
