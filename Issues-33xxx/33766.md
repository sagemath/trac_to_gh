Travis noticed this in #23443#comment:6 :

```
sage: X = SchubertPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: it = iter(X.basis())
sage: [it.next() for _ in range(10)]
[X[],
 X[1],
 X[1, 2],
 X[2, 1],
 X[1, 2, 3],
 X[1, 3, 2],
 X[2, 1, 3],
 X[2, 3, 1],
 X[3, 1, 2],
 X[3, 2, 1]]
```

For the purpose of Schubert polynomials, permutations like [1, 2] and [1, 2, 3] should be considered the same, as the basis is really indexed by finitary permutations of the positive integers (so a fixed point at the end of the one-line notation might just as well be not there).

Unlike other issues spotted in #23443, this one is not fixed yet. I'm not sure how important it is, though.
