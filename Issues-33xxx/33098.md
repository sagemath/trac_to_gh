- The first commit includes all standard packages that can be currently used from system, as well as linbox and maxima which have standing tickets to add (#29631 and #32867 respectively)

- The second commit includes all python packages that can be used from system after #29665

- the remaining commits include additional packages that may be useful in the future.

I haven't paid much attention to tox yet, but there is #33084 and I'll try to look at that. My template for building sage on void knows which dependencies to install so it's not like we need it; this is more to help someone wanting to build from source on void so the suggestion on which packages to install is correct and complete.

We have https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/34030 which is building and testing sage; it is using all the packages I added in the first commit (including linbox and maxima via patches taken from #29631 and #32867)

All tests pass in our standard architectures (x86_64, x86_64-musl and i686) using all possible system packages with system python 3.10 (using #30766) and assorted patches needed for doctests to pass (right now github shows a failure on i686 but that's just the timeout reported in #33091; I added a patch to solve that but I didn't push yet to gh).

Of the remaining tickets, only the second one should have any effect and only after patching with #29665 (which is my next goal as I want to try to ship sage 9.5 for void using system packages as much as possible).

Anyway, I don't really know how tox uses these package lists, so I may be missing something...
