In #30040 we have improved the face iterator for simple/simplicial polytopes, but have not applied this to our heuristic, whether we should find edges/ridges in dual/non-dual mode.

This is noticeable for edges of the permutahedron (and theoretically also for other edges of simple polytopes) and does not make a difference otherwise.

Before:

```
sage: C = polytopes.hypercube(12).combinatorial_polyhedron()
sage: %time _ = C.edges()
CPU times: user 86.1 ms, sys: 9 µs, total: 86.1 ms
Wall time: 86 ms
sage: %time _ = C.ridges()
CPU times: user 617 µs, sys: 3 µs, total: 620 µs
Wall time: 622 µs
sage: C = polytopes.cyclic_polytope(6, 20).combinatorial_polyhedron()
sage: %time _ = C.edges()
CPU times: user 114 µs, sys: 0 ns, total: 114 µs
Wall time: 117 µs
sage: %time _ = C.ridges()
CPU times: user 1.09 ms, sys: 5 µs, total: 1.09 ms
Wall time: 1.1 ms
sage: C = polytopes.permutahedron(7).combinatorial_polyhedron()
sage: %time _ = C.edges()
CPU times: user 16.1 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 16.1 s
Wall time: 16.1 s
sage: %time _ = C.ridges()
CPU times: user 2.35 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 2.35 ms
Wall time: 2.36 ms
```

After:

```
sage: C = polytopes.hypercube(12).combinatorial_polyhedron()
sage: %time _ = C.edges()
CPU times: user 39.5 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 39.5 ms
Wall time: 39.4 ms
sage:  %time _ = C.ridges()
CPU times: user 725 µs, sys: 60 µs, total: 785 µs
Wall time: 791 µs
sage: C = polytopes.cyclic_polytope(6, 20).combinatorial_polyhedron()
sage: %time _ = C.edges()
CPU times: user 154 µs, sys: 12 µs, total: 166 µs
Wall time: 168 µs
sage: %time _ = C.ridges()
CPU times: user 1.16 ms, sys: 95 µs, total: 1.25 ms
Wall time: 1.26 ms
sage: C = polytopes.permutahedron(7).combinatorial_polyhedron()
sage: %time _ = C.edges()
CPU times: user 63.2 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 63.2 ms
Wall time: 63.2 ms
sage: %time _ = C.ridges()
CPU times: user 4.56 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 4.56 ms
Wall time: 4.57 ms
```

The heuristic isn't perfect, but if it fails, you can now select a better algorithm:

```
sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(7) 
sage: P1 = P.stack(next(P.face_generator(1)))
sage: %time P1.vertex_adjacency_matrix()
CPU times: user 20.6 s, sys: 7.96 ms, total: 20.6 s
Wall time: 20.6 s
5041 x 5041 dense matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
sage: P1 = P.stack(next(P.face_generator(1)))
sage: %time P1.vertex_adjacency_matrix(algorithm='primal')
CPU times: user 206 ms, sys: 16 ms, total: 222 ms
Wall time: 222 ms
5041 x 5041 dense matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
```

Maybe irrelevant to this ticket, but are there better criteria than n_Vrepresentation > (n_facets)<sup>2</sup>  (or n_Vrepresentation<sup>2</sup> < n_facets) in which cases one knows that the primal (or the dual) algorithm is faster?

"Wild estimates" plus special treatment for simple/simplicial polytopes does not seem optimal to me. 

If we don't know a better criterion, does it make sense to leave the choice to the user, as an optional input?

I think it is a good idea to expose the primal/dual or automatic options. I really don't know, when the algorithm is faster which way. Like I know for fixed polyhedra, but I have no clue in general. It is surprising how the primal algorithm even to generate edges is much better than the dual algorithm in many cases.

What do you think is better:
- a keyword `algorithm`, with options `'primal'`, `'dual'` or `None` or
- a kewword `dual` with options `True`, `False` and `None`?

At the moment the `Polyhedron_base` method `face_generator` already exposes the keyword dual. But if this is not intuitive we should maybe switch to `algorithm=` instead.

`is_simple()` is not cached (but could be). It has complexity of the incidence matrix, which is worse than the other checks, which are pretty much constant at this stuff needs to be computed anyway.

Maybe it makes sense to cache `is_simple`:

```
sage: C = polytopes.hypercube(12).combinatorial_polyhedron()
sage: %timeit C.is_simple()
24.5 µs ± 1.72 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
sage: %time C.f_vector()
CPU times: user 253 ms, sys: 11.7 ms, total: 265 ms
Wall time: 187 ms
(1, 4096, 24576, 67584, 112640, 126720, 101376, 59136, 25344, 7920, 1760, 264, 24, 1)
```

As for the complexity of the primal and dual algorithm (for edges):

- The dual algorithm takes about `n_Vrepresentation ** 3 * n_facets`.
- The primal algorithm in in the non-simple case takes `sum(f_vector) * n_facets ** 2 * n_Vrepresentation`.
- The primal algorithm in in the simple case takes `sum(f_vector) * n_facets * n_Vrepresentation`.

To estimate `sum(f_vector)` one can use the upper bound theorem. I came up with something in the complexity of `dimension * binomial(min(n_facets, n_Vrepresentation), dimension // 2)`.

One could use those things to get a better estimate, but I don't know if this would be any good. Exposing the algorithm might be the better choice here.

Thank you for providing the complexity details! The formulas look very neat. I think it would be nice to use them in the code, especially when `_f_vector` was cached, because otherwise the users are unlikely to know such things.

I like the keyword `dual` with options `True`, `False` and `None`.  

+1 for caching `is_simple` and `is_simplicial`.

```

Note that the primal algorithm appears to be much better than our estimate. The reason is that the farther we go into the tree, the better the actual runtime will differ from the worst case scenario.

I also find the runtimes quite counter-intuitive. It seems that obtaining the f-vector of a simple/simplicial polytope with this iterator is much better than using the h-vector method.

On the internal function, having it be an `int` is much faster than a `string` for checking cases. You can also change that without any deprecation.

Thank you for the timings. I don't really have any intuition for what should be faster. So I won't be much help and will simply defer to your (and Yuan's) judgement.

In #33646 I propose to use the keyword `algorithm` and `face_generator` over `face_iter`, but without deprecation.

The problem with exponential size is the following: Given a polytope as finite intersection of closed halfspaces. The number of vertices can be expected to be exponential with respect to the number of facets.

However, if you have a non-simple and non-simplicial polytope things might be a lot different. Those polytopes are less-generic but certainly more interesting.

Are the vertices and facets of a `CombinatorialPolyhedron` always stored in a fixed order? 
I vaguely recall that there was an ordering problem for the representations of a `Polyhedron` with different backends. I'm not sure if this is relevant here.

The order of Vrepresentation and Hrepresentation is taken from the input and is then fixed.
What is happening here is that the default algorithm for the edges changed and then this changed the order edges.
