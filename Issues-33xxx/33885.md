<a id='comment:1'></a>Some additional info:

In `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/py-modindex.html`, `sage.combinat` is a link that points back to the main `Combinatorics` webpage. 

In `local/share/doc/sage/latex/en/reference/combinat/combinat.idx` the first two lines are

```
\indexentry{module@\spxentry{module}!sage.combinat@\spxentry{sage.combinat}|hyperpage}{1}
\indexentry{sage.combinat@\spxentry{sage.combinat}!module@\spxentry{module}|hyperpage}{1}
```
which seems to be a correct location but that location did not make it into `local/share/doc/sage/pdf/en/reference/combinat/combinat.pdf`.
