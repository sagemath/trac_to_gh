(from #33125)

#32759 slightly broke `sage -b`: It silently rebuilds sagelib and then reports "Nothing to do".

This behavior comes from `build/make/install`, which first calls `make -q sagelib` with output suppressed. But `-q` handling got broken by #32759, as explained in #33125.

We fix it here.

No, I think MAKE does not pass on the jobserver pipe unless `+` is in use.

True, but the `--jobserver-auth` flag gets added to `MAKEFLAGS` as soon as you run "make". So for example in the hack I suggested in #33125, running `MAKEFLAGS="$(MAKEFLAGS)" ./install` essentially passes the pipe to the subprocess, just like using `+` in the command would have. I think the same thing should work here.

However, while it seems a bit overcomplicated, I think it would be better to do what the documentation says and add a MAKEFLAGS check at the top of any scripts that we intend to both (1) be invoked by make and (2) to invoke make themselves. That way using those scripts requires no special knowledge or consideration; they'll always just do the right thing.

Passing the flag does not pass the pipe.

What do you think about adding that `MAKEFLAGS` check to the scripts that (re)invoke \"make\" themselves?\n\nIf you think it's a good idea but don't want to deal with it right now, I'd be satisfied to open an enhancement ticket and merge this to solve the immediate problem. Maybe with the one caveat that we should replace `+` with `$(PLUS)` in the other no-deps rule as well, so that things like `make -n doc-html` don't try to build anything.",

Ohhkay, I see the problem. What do you think about adding that `MAKEFLAGS` check to the scripts that (re)invoke "make" themselves?

If you think it's a good idea but don't want to deal with it right now, I'd be satisfied to open an enhancement ticket and merge this to solve the immediate problem. Maybe with the one caveat that we should replace `+` with `$(PLUS)` in the other no-deps rule as well, so that things like `make -n doc-html` don't try to build anything.
