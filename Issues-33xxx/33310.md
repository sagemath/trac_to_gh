Saving RealBalls (and analogously ComplexBalls) is currently not supported (tested on SageMath/9.4):

```
sage: tmp = RBF(pi)
sage: save(tmp,"test")
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.real_arb.RealBall' object has no attribute '__dict__'
```
One current workaround (though not very satisfying) is to convert the elements to RealIntervalFields before saving them.

Keywords: **arb, RealBallField**

Component: **pickling**
