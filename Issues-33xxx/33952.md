The code can be very slow and presumably use a lot of memory as in the following case, where for me Sage eventually crashes. 

```
F.<s5> = QQ.extension(polygen(QQ)^2-5, embedding=2)
K.<x> = FunctionField(F)
_.<Y> = K[]
f = -20*x^6 + (45*s5 + 75)*x^4*Y + 68*x^3*Y^2 + (-180*s5 - 400)*x^3*Y + (189*s5 + 441)*x^2*Y^2 + (45*s5 + 75)*x*Y^3 - 20*Y^4 + (-63*s5 - 141)*x*Y^2 + (-180*s5 - 400)*Y^3 + (144*s5 + 322)*Y^2
L.<y> = K.extension(f)
L.basis_of_holomorphic_differentials()
```
This example comes from a genuine use case I have wanted differentials for, and Maple can do the corresponding calculation in less than a second. Perhaps add a warning or a note about this in the documentation, otherwise the code looks good.

The above failure is not directly related with the code here. So it seems inappropriate to add a warning or note to the new method.

Meanwhile, I narrowed it down to this singular code (which computes the integral basis of the infinite maximal order of the example function field):

```
LIB "normal.lib";
ring S = (0,s5),(x,y),dp;
minpoly = s5^2 - 5;
ideal i = x^18+(9*s5+20)*y*x^15+(-9/4*s5-15/4)*y*x^14+(-36/5*s5-161/10)*y^2*x^12+(63/20*s5+141/20)*y^2*x^11+(-189/20*s5-441/20)*y^2*x^10-17/5*y^2*x^9+(9*s5+20)*y^3*x^6+(-9/4*s5-15/4)*y^3*x^5+y^4;
normal(i);
```

which takes forever.

The ideal is fine and the algorithm works well. However, due to
coefficient swell in char 0 it takes long.
You can control the computational progress by setting `option(prot);`
before the computation (the manual explains the symbols).

I did the computation in a large finite char and then it took 31 sec
(on my MacBook Air M1). The protocol gives you an impression of the
large number of Groebner basis computations. Here is my input

```
option(prot);
LIB "normal.lib";
ring S = (32003,s5),(x,y),dp;
minpoly = s5^2 - 5;
ideal i = x^18+(9*s5+20)*y*x^15+(-9/4*s5-15/4)*y*x^14+(-36/5*s5-161/10)*y^2*x^12+(63/20*s5+141/20)*y^2*x^11+(-189/20*s5-441/20)*y^2*x^10-17/5*y^2*x^9+(9*s5+20)*y^3*x^6+(-9/4*s5-15/4)*y^3*x^5+y^4;
int t=timer;
list nor = normal(i);
timer-t;   //shows the time in sec
nor;
```
I stopped the computation in char 0 after 5 h but the protocol shows
that it works correctly. However the total time to finish is
unpredictable.
