Change `iteritems` to `items` in two py files where `iteritems` makes no sense with python3.

Also in one pyx file. Note that in pyx files, with python3, `items` is the same as `iteritems`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33726

What do you mean? You only replaced `iteritems` with `items` (of python3).

Well, I suspect that this part of the code is never doctested. In python3, dictionaries no longer have an iteritems method.

The only thing that still have an iteritems method are sage own's weak dictionaries. We should switch this method's name to items, but not in this ticket.
