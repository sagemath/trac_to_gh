Change `iteritems` to `items` in two py files where `iteritems` makes no sense with python3.

Also in one pyx file. Note that in pyx files, with python3, `items` is the same as `iteritems`.

The only thing that still have an iteritems method are sage own's weak dictionaries. We should switch this method's name to items, but not in this ticket.
