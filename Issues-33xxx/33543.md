I'm interested is doing this project as part of GSoC 2022 and this ticket is for discussions about it.
 
The goal of this project is to implement an algorithm for finding edge disjoint spanning trees in digraphs using the algorithm: Harold N. Gabow: A Matroid Approach to Finding Edge Connectivity and Packing Arborescences. J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 50(2): 259-273 (1995) â€‹https://doi.org/10.1006/jcss.1995.1022

I'm currently trying to get a feel of the work involved. Here are some comments and questions. Please correct any wrong assumptions:
- dcoudert already has a Cython implementation ([#32169 comment:40](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/32169#comment:40)) of computing the edge connectivity of a digraph, but it lacks comments and doctests. Since this work has already been done, there's no need to implement the Round Robin algorithm for edge connectivity stated in Gabow's paper, right? So we can just move on to adding the missing comments and doctests?  
- Continuing from where dcoudert stopped, work on the second part of the paper about extracting the k-edge-disjoint spanning trees.
- There currently exists an ILP approach for edge-disjoint spanning trees in Sage. Will this be removed or kept for comparison purposes?
- The description on the GSoC ideas page (https://wiki.sagemath.org/GSoC/2022) says "The goal of this project is to implement combinatorial algorithms". Since "algorithms" is in plural, does this mean I'll have to find/implement other algorithms apart from Gabow's? 
- Is there anything else about this project I should know?

Welcome to Sagemath.

I don't think this is the best place to comment the project (email ?), but let me give some answers:
- I will open a ticket as soon as I can with the code I have, and yes, it's best to start from it to develop the second part of the paper (it uses it)
- the ILP formulations will remain for comparison purposes
- Other algorithms can certainly be developed if times allows.
