We implement a sage compatible version of the [Python statistics module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html) in `stats/statistics.py`. In particular, it will provide the `mean` and `median` functions that were recently deprecated for removal in #29662. See also #33432.

That makes no sense - the point of the module is to be compatible not with numpy but with the built-in statistics module.

Yes, because the signature is `mean(data)`, not `mean(data, /)`, users are allowed to call it as `mean(data=...)`.

I don't like the conversion afterwards so much. The mean of a list of integers is a floating point in numpy.

```
sage: data = [1,2,7,-11,15,23]
sage: statistics.mean(data)
37/6
sage: import sage.stats.statistics as statistics
sage: import numpy
sage: statistics.mean(numpy.array(data))
6.166666666666667
```
Maybe I should just remove these numpy shortcuts and simply document how to use the proper numpy methods in the documentation only?

Please don't. [comment:30](#comment%3A30) has to be sorted out first.

Also, I would like to mitigate the warnings in `basic_stats`. Currently, the only deprecated behaviour of `mean(v)` are when either
- it calls the underlying `v.mean()` method of the object
- ot when the input data `v` is empty.
In all other cases, we can suppress the deprecation. And similarly for all other functions in `basic_stats`.
