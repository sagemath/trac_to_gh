```
     We define the mean of the empty list to be the (symbolic) NaN,
     following the convention of MATLAB, Scipy, and R.
 
-    This function is deprecated.  Use ``numpy.mean`` or ``numpy.nanmean``
-    instead.
+    This function is deprecated.  Use ``sage.stats.statistics.mean`` instead. The
+    differences with this function are
+
+    - the code does not try to call ``v.mean()``
+    - raises an error on empty input
```

Stuff like this -- please don't remove cross-references to numpy.

I don't like the conversion afterwards so much. The mean of a list of integers is a floating point in numpy.

```
sage: data = [1,2,7,-11,15,23]
sage: statistics.mean(data)
37/6
sage: import sage.stats.statistics as statistics
sage: import numpy
sage: statistics.mean(numpy.array(data))
6.166666666666667
```
Maybe I should just remove these numpy shortcuts and simply document how to use the proper numpy methods in the documentation only?

Please don't. [This is the Trac macro *comment:30* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#comment:30-macro) has to be sorted out first.

Also, I would like to mitigate the warnings in `basic_stats`. Currently, the only deprecated behaviour of `mean(v)` are when either
- it calls the underlying `v.mean()` method of the object
- ot when the input data `v` is empty.
In all other cases, we can suppress the deprecation. And similarly for all other functions in `basic_stats`.
