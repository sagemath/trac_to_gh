This is the same as `-standard` plus the system packages provided by the `_recommended` dummy script package, thus suitable for testing `doc-pdf`.

`tox.ini` now also allows to pass `EXTRA_SAGE_PACKAGES` as an environment variable.

Later we can switch the Linux portability workflow to use `-recommended` instead of `-standard`. 

(split out from #33222)
