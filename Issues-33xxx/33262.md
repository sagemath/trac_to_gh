The `SAGE_ROOT/logs` directory is never cleaned up and can grow very large over time.

We append the Sage version number to it, e.g., `SAGE_ROOT/logs-9.6` (and create a symlink from `SAGE_ROOT/logs` for convenience). Upon first use, `make` moves the old `logs` directory out of the way so that the symlink can be created.

Users can then delete old log directories without having to worry that they lose information that is relevant for reporting bugs.

The location of the log file can also be overridden using an environment variable `SAGE_ROOT_LOGS`. This is useful for `tox` and devcontainer runs, whose logs are best kept separate from local direct builds.

Also, we change the handling of `config.log`, previously set up as a symlink into `logs/pkgs/`. We often get reports about build problems with a `config.log` attached that just shows "... already installed as an SPKG", so we cannot see what caused the SPKG to be installed in the first place. We fix this problem by appending the current contents of `config.log` (whenever it has changed) to `logs/pkgs/config.log`.

This is a good point, but I think it is also clearly visible in the first lines of output in the log:
