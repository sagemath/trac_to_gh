Prerequisites for building on many platforms
are listed at

- https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/spkg/_prereq.html

The empty homebrew section is not dealt with properly
and appears mixed with the next section, nix.

<a id='comment:3'></a>This is definitely better. Possible further improvements:

- adjust the display name of each distro,
  with proper capitalisation. Already done
  for Debian and for Fedora, could be done
  for Arch Linux, Cygwin, FreeBSD, etc.
- when the section is empty, add a sentence
  such as "The base distribution has all
  the necessary packages for building Sage."
- add a "copy" button near each command
  that copies the command (without prompt)
  to the clipboard; that would probably
  involve some JavaScript
- cosmetic adjustment: remove double spaces

Not necessarily for this ticket though.
