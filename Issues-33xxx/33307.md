are listed at

This is definitely better. Possible further improvements:

- adjust the display name of each distro,
  with proper capitalisation. Already done
  for Debian and for Fedora, could be done
  for Arch Linux, Cygwin, FreeBSD, etc.
- when the section is empty, add a sentence
  such as "The base distribution has all
  the necessary packages for building Sage."
- add a "copy" button near each command
  that copies the command (without prompt)
  to the clipboard; that would probably
  involve some JavaScript
- cosmetic adjustment: remove double spaces

Not necessarily for this ticket though.
