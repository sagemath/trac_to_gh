The original database does not provide a value for the `braid_notation` of the unknot. Thus this value has been set individually in the interface, but unfortunately this value corresponds to a disjoint union of two unknots. This bug remained unnoticed because the construction of a link from a braid in Sage erases all additional unknots.
