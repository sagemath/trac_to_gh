The output of `matching` displays edges in reverse order in 2.7, which break tests. To fix it, we make the output of `matching` and `Edgesview`, which also fixes some other issues, such as:

```
sage: G=graphs.CompleteGraph(4)
sage: m=G.matching(); m
[(1, 2, None), (0, 3, None)]
sage: (3, 0, None) in m
False
```

Also, `networkx.node_clique_number` now outputs a `collections.defaultdict` object, so we explicitly cast it to `dict` for backwards compatibility.

You should
-  specify the input format to `Graph` to reduce the overhead of building the graph before returning the result.

```diff
-                return EdgesView(Graph([(u, v, L[frozenset((u, v))]) for u, v in d]))
+                return EdgesView(Graph([(u, v, L[frozenset((u, v))]) for u, v in d], format='list_of_edges'))
```
- update the documentation to clarify that the output is now a `EdgesView`
- modify a doctest to show that the result is of type `EdgesView`, for instance like

```diff
-            sage: sorted(g.matching(use_edge_labels=True))
-            [(0, 3, 3), (1, 2, 6)]
+            sage: m = g.matching(use_edge_labels=True)
+            sage: type(m)
+            <class 'sage.graphs.views.EdgesView'>
+            sage: sorted(m)
+            [(0, 3, 3), (1, 2, 6)]
```
