This actually came to light when a Dockerfile failed:

```
FROM sagemath/sagemath:9.3
USER root
RUN apt-get update
```

fails with a "GPG error: http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hirsute-security InRelease: gpgv, gpgv2 or gpgv1 required for verification, but neither seems installed" error

I tried all the images before I uploaded them, so either something has changed in docker since then or there's something specific about your setup here.
