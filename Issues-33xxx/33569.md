While this is undeniably faster, this seems to be much worse in memory. The current code just needs all of the multiedges and the local information around a vertex I believe. However, the proposed code requires essentially making a copy of the graph as it needs to hold all of the edges in memory (plus a second copy for all of the keys of the `dict`). Granted, the current code is too slow to be useful on such large graphs, so this probably is the thing we want to do. I am wondering if we can get a more memory efficient implementation.

One thing that could be done to make this even faster would be to use the `if f in edges:` check as

```python
        edges = {}
        multi_edges = set()
        for e in self.edge_iterator(labels=labels):
            f = edge_id(e[0], e[1])
            if f in edges:
                multi_edges.add(f)
                edges[f].append(e)
            else:
                edges[f] = [e]
        multi_edges = sum(edges[f] for f in multi_edges, [])
```
This would save an iteration over all of the edges of the graph.

I have pushed an alternative implementation of method `multiple_edges`. It uses less memory and is slightly slower than the previous proposal, but this is acceptable. However, I had to distinguish cases.
