The placement of the minus sign when factoring multivariate polynomials over `QQ` lost consistency at some point between Sage 9.2 and 9.4.

Define a multivariate polynomial ring:

```
sage: R.<ax,bx,ay,by,Az,Bz,Ai,Bi> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 8, order='invlex')
sage: R
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in ax, bx, ay, by, Az, Bz, Ai, Bi over Rational Field
```

Then, in Sage 9.2:

```
sage: R((-2 * (bx - ax)) ^ 1).factor()
(2) * (-bx + ax)
sage: R((-2 * (bx - ax)) ^ 2).factor()
(4) * (-bx + ax)^2
sage: R((-2 * (bx - ax)) ^ 3).factor()
(8) * (-bx + ax)^3
```
while in Sage 9.4 or Sage 9.5:

```
sage: R((-2 * (bx - ax)) ^ 1).factor()
(-2) * (bx - ax)
sage: R((-2 * (bx - ax)) ^ 2).factor()
(4) * (-bx + ax)^2
sage: R((-2 * (bx - ax)) ^ 3).factor()
(8) * (-bx + ax)^3
```

This broke our code in

- https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1068#discussion_r796515727

It would be good to output a canonical form. A natural choice seems to make the leading coefficient of each factor positive. 

It may then also be good to document that the factors will be primitive.

The `invlex` monomial ordering is not the culprit: the inconsistency also occurs with `lex` (see one comment down at the GitHub link).
