This code from #29024

```
    os.environ["SINGULAR_BIN_DIR"] = dirname(which("Singular"))
```
assumes that `Singular` is in PATH

This causes errors when users attempt to use sagelib outside of the environment set up by `sage-env`.

The `SAGE_LOCAL` location will be prepended to `PATH` during `./configure` though, so that's the time to write it down. Then later the location is known regardless of what `PATH` contains.

<a id='comment:19'></a>How does one test this? I tried the way given in the link, but it ends up as follows:

```
ima@hilbert /mnt/opt/Sage $ ./sage-dev/sage -python3 -m venv --system-site-packages venv
dima@hilbert /mnt/opt/Sage $ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) dima@hilbert /mnt/opt/Sage $ python3
Python 3.9.10 (main, Mar  4 2022, 14:46:20) 
[GCC 11.2.1 20211127] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from sage.all import *
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sage'
>>> 
```

Am I doing something wrong?
