Sorry for not getting it right the first time. However, the good news is that #33147 apparently made this at least 50× faster on some machines!

I think this is demonstrating that it isn't really a robust doctest. Although I am not sure I know of a better way forward. I am not 100% convinced we need this doctest either as we don't test interruptability in many other parts of Sage. Well, this works for now.
