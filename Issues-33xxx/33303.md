Typing `\alpha` and pressing the TAB key gives `α`,
and likewise for other greek letters.

Currently this fails for `Mu`, `Nu`, `omicron`, `Omicron`.

This "LaTeX and unicode completion" feature
is provided by IPython:

- https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/generated/IPython.core.completer.html

so it works both in the Sage REPL and in a Jupyter sheet,
whether in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Reported upstream to IPython as

- [IPython issue 13514](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/13514)
