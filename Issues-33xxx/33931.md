As part of #32957, let's deprecate `sage.misc.viewer` in favor of (a) for images, a version that uses Sage's `Features` and (b) for web browsing, the Python library `webbrowser`.

<a id='comment:2'></a>I tested this by running these commands in Sage from the command line and in the notebook:

```
C = graphs.CubeGraph(8)
C.plot(vertex_labels=False, vertex_size=0, graph_border=True).show()

view(4)
view(4, viewer='pdf')

from sage.misc.latex_standalone import Standalone
s = Standalone('hello world')
s.pdf()
s.png()
s.svg()  # fails on my machine: missing feature

browse_sage_doc._open('reference')

I did this with the develop branch, with this branch, and with a more radical branch in which I completely deleted `sage.misc.viewer` and its entry in the reference manual. It looked like the same behavior in all of these cases. This was all on OS X, I encourage more testing on more platforms.

On Ubuntu 20.04, all of the above work. The behavior of `s.pdf()`, `s.png()` and `s.svg()` changed as it now open in the browser at url like `file:////tmp/tmp0jvfbjec/tikz_u5t2ot7z.pdf`. It is fine with me.

Looking at this ticket again, I don't think I am confident anymore to give a positive review. Deprecating `viewer` in favor of webbrowser changes a behavior in sage that exists since 15 years. In particular, on my Ubuntu, viewer is an equivalent for the more general `xdg-open`:

```
sage: from sage.misc.viewer import viewer
sage: viewer('pdf')
'xdg-open'
```

Also, the current state which exists for years allows the user to specify its preferated viewer:

```
sage: from sage.misc.viewer import viewer, _viewer_prefs
sage: viewer.pdf_viewer('evince')
sage: _viewer_prefs
{'pdf_viewer': 'evince'}
```

So, the current branch might be a step backward for many long time users which have old written code. Personnaly, I am afraid the current change will break something on a platform I am not familiar with like Windows or OS X, which I can't test.

Finally, is the motivation for the current branch only to get rid of `have_program`? If so, I would suggest to create a feature for `xdg-open` and use webbrowser in the lines where `firefox`, etc. is involved.

Ok, I remember now. Maybe we can start by replacing occurences of `have_program` by some usage of `webbrowser`.

Also, in the documentation of [webbrowser.open](https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html#webbrowser.open), I see:

*"Note that on some platforms, trying to open a filename using this function, may work and start the operating system’s associated program. However, this is neither supported nor portable."*

However, I don't know if this comment refers to `r'file:///path/to/file'` or only `r'path/to/file'`.
