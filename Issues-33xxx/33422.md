The following application of sage.rings.valuation.inductive_valuation.py's method `equivalence_decomposition` produces an assertion error, see [https://github.com/MCLF/mclf/issues/109](https://github.com/MCLF/mclf/issues/109).

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: v_7 = QQ.valuation(7)
sage: v0 = GaussValuation(R, v_7)
sage: v1 = v0.augmentation(x, 3/2)
sage: v2 = v1.augmentation(x^2-686, 7/2)
sage: f = x^4 - 8001504*x^2 - 592815428352
sage: v2.equivalence_decomposition(f)
```

The error comes from the assertion 

```
assert self.is_equivalent(ret.prod(), f)
```
where the input *f* does not agree with the product of the factorization computed. Its unit part is wrong, *2* instead of *1*.

The problem is as follows. The polynomial *f* gets reduced to *x<sup>2</sup>+1*, whose lift *x<sup>4</sup> - 343/2*x<sup>2</sup> + 1294139* is the only key in the factorization. To take care of its unit part, we add `equivalence_unit(-7, reciprocal=True)` to the unit. But this isn't actually the unit implicit in `lift_to_key`. There, we use the augmented valuation v_2's method `_Q()`. What this comes down to is adding `equivalence_unit(-7/2, reciprocal=True)^2` to the unit. 

In this example, this does not work: `equivalence_unit(-7, reciprocal=True)` and `equivalence_unit(-7/2, reciprocal=True)^2` are not equivalent, they differ by a factor of *2*.

Explanation of the change:

The method described in `lift_to_key` lifts an irreducible factor of the reduction and then essentially multiplies it with the polynomial called \phi_k<sup>{\tau\sharp}</sup> by MacLane. `equivalence_decomposition` just wants to keep track of this change in unit by multiplying with an element of appropriate valuation, but that's not the right choice in general. Instead we can just multiply with the right power of the reciprocal \phi_k<sup>{\tau\flat}</sup> (which has its own method in Sage, `_Q_reciprocal`).
