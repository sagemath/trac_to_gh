When running sage in Jupyter notebook, 

```
sage: ascii_art(list(Partitions(5)))
<repr(<sage.typeset.ascii_art.AsciiArt at 0x7f8f358aa250>) failed: OSError: [Errno 25] Inappropriate ioctl for device>
```

This is because the `_terminal_width()` method does not work with Jupiter.

According to the comment, the author of the code, Volker, only considered terminal and IPython. So the `try/except` code is only for those two cases.

There is no reason to suspect that this change will make the situation with other user interfaces worse or better... In any case, it could be dealt with in other tickets if reported by users of those interfaces.

I think this fix is an API change. We have no control over what fake
ttys Sage users are using.
What earlier returned False might now lead to an error.
So if you want to remove that try/except, you must deprecate it first.

IMHO I'd better have try/except retained (your fix applied in the body of try)
