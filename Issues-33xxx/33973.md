We change the function `sage.misc.sagedoc.process_dollars` so it issues a deprecation warning when dollar signs are used for math markup. 

This is to provide a gentle transition for user packages that use  the Sage docbuilding machinery.

<a id='comment:1'></a>A reminder: we need to change the developer's guide, coding_basics.rst:

```
In Sage's documentation LaTeX code is allowed and is marked with **backticks or
dollar signs**:

    ```x^2 + y^2 = 1``` and ``$x^2 + y^2 = 1$`` both yield `x^2 + y^2 = 1`.

```
and an example a few lines later.
