In the documentation for [implicit 3d plots](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plot3d/sage/plot/plot3d/implicit_plot3d.html) we see some pretty cool colormap examples.  However, there is a warning:

```
Warning This kind of coloring using a colormap can be visualized using Jmol, Tachyon (option viewer='tachyon') and Canvas3D (option viewer='canvas3d' in the notebook).
```
As far as I can tell, this also works with the default threejs as well, so this should be updated.
