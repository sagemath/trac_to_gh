It gives some outdated advice regarding "all.py"

it should point to https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging_sage_library.html#dependencies-and-distribution-packages 

Also we add some material from https://wiki.sagemath.org/import (and delete it there, and also delete outdated material there).
