Starting with v61, setuptools (experimentally) support pyproject.toml for configuration, see https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/1688. Moreover, setup.cfg will eventually be deprecated so it's a good idea to migrate from cfg to toml.

Migration can be done mostly automatically using https://ini2toml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html:

```
  (cd pkgs/sage-conf && ini2toml setup.cfg > pyproject.toml && git rm -f setup.cfg && git add pyproject.toml)

  (cd pkgs/sagemath-objects && (echo && echo '[project]' && ini2toml -p setup.cfg setup.cfg.m4 | sed "1,/[[]project/d;s/\"esys/esys/;s/install-requires /install-requires-toml /;s/ *\\\\\\\\\"/\')/;/conf-unix/d;" ) >> pyproject.toml.m4 && git rm -f setup.cfg.m4)
```
(the conversion of the m4 files loses some install-requires and needs to be fixed up manually.)

This is also preparation for #34630 (migration from setuptools to meson-python)
