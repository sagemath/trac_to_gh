Currently the Cholesky decomposition of a symbolic matrix is only implemented if the entries are essentially constant (like `pi`). This is extended to now allow arbitrary symbolic expressions.

Changes in particular are:
- Implement `conjugate` of real intervals, just returning the original interval. The implementation of the Cholesky decomposition checks for `is_Hermitian` which calls `conjugate`. With this change, symmetric real matrices are now correctly recognized as being Hermitian.
- Use `is_positive` check in `is_square` to check if an expression is positive and thus we can take the square root of it. I'm unsure about this change since the documentation of `is_square` doesn't really say under which conditions it should return true. For example, `-1` is the square of `i`, so should `is_square` return `true` in this case?

The added test currently fails since `is_positive` for `-conjugate(a_2)^2/a_1 + (conjugate(a_2)^2 + 1)/a_1` returns false although this is just `1/a_1` and `a_1` is assumed to be positive. Is there a way to convince `is_positive` to perform simplifications like this?
