It seems to me the most precise answer possible is the one given by pari 2.13.4. It all boils down to

```
? (x+O(x^8))^2
%1 = x^2 + O(x^9)
```
which was already giving that answer in 2.13.3.

Since the taylor expansion of `cosh(x)` starts with `1 + 1/2*x^2 + ...` this is really correct.

Indeed, even in 2.13.3:

```
? subst(cosh(x), x, x+O(x^8))
%2 = 1 + 1/2*x^2 + 1/24*x^4 + 1/720*x^6 + 1/40320*x^8 + O(x^9)
```

A more explicit alternative could be to use something like:

```
sage: pari('x+O(x^8)').cosh() + pari('O(x^8)')
1 + 1/2*x^2 + 1/24*x^4 + 1/720*x^6 + O(x^8)
```

If you want to explicitly truncate a power series to `O(x^8)`, you add `pari(O(x^8))` to it. That was my 
suggestion above:

```
sage: pari('x+O(x^8)').cosh() + pari('O(x^8)')
1 + 1/2*x^2 + 1/24*x^4 + 1/720*x^6 + O(x^8)
```

Note also that

```
sage: A = pari('1 + 1/2*x^2 + 1/24*x^4 + 1/720*x^6 + 1/40320*x^8 + O(x^9)')
sage: B = pari('1 + 1/2*x^2 + 1/24*x^4 + 1/720*x^6 + O(x^8)')
sage: A == B
True
```
So really, the two answers are "the same" in a sense.

In pari, the explicit goal is to give the most precise answer that is possible, in that sense the former behaviour was a "bug" (in fact, `cos(x+O(x^8))` was already giving an `O(x^9)` answer, so the bug was particular to cosh).

In fact in sage the same is (sometimes) true:

```
sage: x = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ, 'x').0
sage: x + O(x^8)
x + O(x^8)
sage: (x + O(x^8))^2
x^2 + O(x^9)
```

However

```
sage: cosh(x+O(x^8))
1 + 1/2*x^2 + 1/24*x^4 + 1/720*x^6 + O(x^8)
sage: cos(x+O(x^8))
1 - 1/2*x^2 + 1/24*x^4 - 1/720*x^6 + O(x^8)
```
