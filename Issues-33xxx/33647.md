Failed example:

Expected:

Got:

It seems to me the most precise answer possible is the one given by pari 2.13.4. It all boils down to

```
? (x+O(x^8))^2
%1 = x^2 + O(x^9)
```
which was already giving that answer in 2.13.3.

Since the taylor expansion of `cosh(x)` starts with `1 + 1/2*x^2 + ...` this is really correct.

Indeed, even in 2.13.3:

```
? subst(cosh(x), x, x+O(x^8))
%2 = 1 + 1/2*x^2 + 1/24*x^4 + 1/720*x^6 + 1/40320*x^8 + O(x^9)
```

A more explicit alternative could be to use something like:

```
sage: pari('x+O(x^8)').cosh() + pari('O(x^8)')
1 + 1/2*x^2 + 1/24*x^4 + 1/720*x^6 + O(x^8)
```

As long as you don't define your power series as an element of a fixed-precision ring, pari has no way to know which answer you expect, and giving the best possible approximation is a valid (and, from my point of view, preferable) option.

In any case, this test is explicitly testing the pari interface. From sage we have two options, IMO: we accept whatever answer pari gives (as long as it is correct), or we stop testing the pari interface altogether. Any further discussion about which answer is more appropriate belongs upstream.

If you want to explicitly truncate a power series to `O(x^8)`, you add `pari(O(x^8))` to it. That was my 
suggestion above:

```
sage: pari('x+O(x^8)').cosh() + pari('O(x^8)')
1 + 1/2*x^2 + 1/24*x^4 + 1/720*x^6 + O(x^8)
```

Note also that

```
sage: A = pari('1 + 1/2*x^2 + 1/24*x^4 + 1/720*x^6 + 1/40320*x^8 + O(x^9)')
sage: B = pari('1 + 1/2*x^2 + 1/24*x^4 + 1/720*x^6 + O(x^8)')
sage: A == B
True
```
So really, the two answers are "the same" in a sense.

In pari, the explicit goal is to give the most precise answer that is possible, in that sense the former behaviour was a "bug" (in fact, `cos(x+O(x^8))` was already giving an `O(x^9)` answer, so the bug was particular to cosh).

In fact in sage the same is (sometimes) true:

```
sage: x = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ, 'x').0
sage: x + O(x^8)
x + O(x^8)
sage: (x + O(x^8))^2
x^2 + O(x^9)
```

However

```
sage: cosh(x+O(x^8))
1 + 1/2*x^2 + 1/24*x^4 + 1/720*x^6 + O(x^8)
sage: cos(x+O(x^8))
1 - 1/2*x^2 + 1/24*x^4 - 1/720*x^6 + O(x^8)
```
