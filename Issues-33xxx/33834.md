    "body": "One doctest continuously fails in the build workflow. I couldn't reproduce the error locally, but hopefully it goes away by slightly increasing the timeout from 1sec to 1.5sec.\n\nWe also extend the doctest to provide a bit more debug information, and to actually test parallel processing by using two roots and thus two threads.\n\nLocal debug output:\n\n```\nFile \"sage/parallel/map_reduce.py\", line 1148, in

One doctest continuously fails in the build workflow. I couldn't reproduce the error locally, but hopefully it goes away by slightly increasing the timeout from 1sec to 1.5sec.

We also extend the doctest to provide a bit more debug information, and to actually test parallel processing by using two roots and thus two threads.

Local debug output:

 One doctest continuously fails in the build workflow. I couldn't reproduce the error locally, but hopefully it goes away by slightly increasing the timeout from 1sec to 1.5sec.
