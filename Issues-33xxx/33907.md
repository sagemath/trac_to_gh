I've been getting this very frequently when running tests under heavy CPU load. This happens on Sage 9.5 too.

I've just got the exact same issue when building/doctesting the sagemath void package on github actions. Happened with x86_64 and i686 (but not with x86_64-musl).

Not copying the log since it is identical.

Edit: in case it is relevant, we use singular 4.3.1p2 from system.

Here's a way to reproduce it:

```
sage: for i in range(1_000_000):
....:     singular._eval_line('for(int i=1;i<=3;i++){i=1;};', wait_for_prompt=False)
....:     if not singular.interrupt(tries=1, timeout=1e-6):
....:         print(f"FAIL in step {i} ")
....:         break
....:     _ = singular('2+3')
....: 
^[[A''
Singular crashed -- automatically restarting.
''
Singular crashed -- automatically restarting.
''
Singular crashed -- automatically restarting.
''
Singular crashed -- automatically restarting.
''
Singular crashed -- automatically restarting.
''
Singular crashed -- automatically restarting.
''
Singular crashed -- automatically restarting.
''
FAIL in step 7 
```

The "Singular crashed" output is expected.

As reported, this fails more if there is a heavy load, and I think using `tries=1` and `timeout=1e-6` also helps it. For the heavy load, right now I am running `sage -tp 8 --all --long` (8 core / 8 thread box)

A comment before the doctest says:

```
        For reasons which are currently not understood, the ``interrupt``
        test usually returns immediately, but sometimes it takes a very
        long time on the same system. ::
```
I guess "takes a very long time" sometimes is more than the default `timeout=2.0` seconds repeated more than the default `tries=5` times in a row.

This essentially reverts 85f65bf and a10d19d from trac #31846.
It turns out this was originaly written for #30945, but that issue was
fixed by upgrading cysignals.
    
Singular really needs a custom `_send_interrupt()` method, because the
default one will quit singular. Moreover, this handles two quirks of
singular:
    
- a small delay before sending `chr(3)` works around a bug in singular.
- sometimes one needs to send `;` a few times after interrupt to get
  back a prompt.
    
The original author of the custom `_send_interrupt()` is Jeroen Demeyer
in commit 17d23e9 (trac #10476). I changed the timeout for a smaller
one, and rewrote the doctest to call `interrupt()` explicitly instead of
using `alarm()` which introduces more noise.
