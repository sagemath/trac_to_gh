<a id='comment:6'></a>With respect to the documentation. Anything after a `::` must be indented. The correct syntax for a `TESTS` or `EXAMPLES` block starting with a sentence is

```
        TESTS:

        Here is an example of a quotient ring which is not an integral
        domain, even though the base ring is integral and the modulus is
        irreducible::

            sage: B = ZZ.extension(x^2 - 5, 'a')
```

Instead of `if IntegralDomains() in self.categories()` you might want to do `if self in IntegralDomains()`.

The test `if self.base_ring() in GcdDomains` would better be `if self.base_ring() in GcdDomains()`. I am surprised that it works the way you wrote it (as `GcdDomains` is a class).

When `proof=False` I am not sure that the shortcut `NotImplementedError => False` is desirable

```
            except NotImplementedError:
                if proof:
                    raise
                else:
                    ret = False
```
You indeed catch the `raise NotImplementedError` that could be raised few lines above but also any `NotImplementedError` that would come from `irr = self.modulus().is_irreducible()`.

Ok, I can do that, though one small comment: I believe in most cases this will mean that `is_integral_domain` will go into an infinite loop alternating with `IntegralDomains().__contains__` until an exception is raised and the `__contains__` method returns `False`. But maybe this is ok?

Yes, in retrospect I am also surprised - I'll change this.

It's true that there are two sources where the `NotImplementedError` could come from, but I think in both cases there is nothing we can do mathematically - to confirm that we are an integral domain, the only path leading to `True` right now is that we can verify that `self.modulus()` is irreducible AND that the base ring is a GCD. If you know another sufficient condition, I am happy to include it.

In fact the previous method `PolynomialQuotientRing.is_field`, which I tried to emulate, specifically uses such a `try: ... except NotImplementedError` to catch a missing implementation of `is_irreducible`.

The method `self in IntegralDomains()` ought to be a faster equivalent of `IntegralDomains() in self.categories()`... which is not the case. Could you simply add a comment in the code? There is a note at the end of the documentation of `IntegralDomains.__contains__` mentionning that this method should disappear (in favour of the generic one being equivalent to `IntegralDomains() in self.categories()`).

I think my misunderstanding comes from the weird semantic of the keyword `proof=True`/`proof=False`. I thought that `proof=False` meant "the answer assumes some standard conjecture such as the generalized Riemann hypothesis" (as in https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/structure/sage/structure/proof/proof.html). What your `proof=False` means is rather "do not raise NotImplementedError but return False instead".

You might want to use what the generic `__contains__` does

```
self.category().is_subcategory(IntegralDomains())
```
(see `sage/categories/category.py`).

<a id='comment:14'></a>In the documentation of `Ring.is_integral_domain` it says

```
   Return "True" if this ring is an integral domain.

   INPUT:

   * "proof" -- (default: "True") Determines what to do in unknown
     cases

   ALGORITHM:

   If the parameter "proof" is set to "True", the returned value is
   correct but the method might throw an error.  Otherwise, if it is
   set to "False", the method returns "True" if it can establish that
   self is an integral domain and "False" otherwise.
```
My impression is: if the primality tests have a nonzero chance of returning a false positive, then the implementation in `Zmod(n)` is not strictly speaking conforming to this specification in `Ring.is_integral_domain`.
