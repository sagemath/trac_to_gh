Well it depends on a python package named psutils because it mimics that functionality, but the python package in question do not require the C package psutil.

https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil https://pypi.org/project/psutil/

So the plot twist is that we can really dump the old "psutil" package in favor of something designed to be more cross platform from the start.

Well, I know when I'm beaten. It looks like ipykernel is making the same mistakes that sage did; (a) reckless introduction of dependencies to obtain (b) meaningless memory metrics.

I don't have the energy to fight it, I'm going outside.

After some fresh air, we can try to get a simple patch into `psutil` that minimally supports Cygwin by just returning a meaningless positive constant.

(The last attempt to get Cygwin support into `psutil` was trying to get a highly intrusive megapatch in.)
