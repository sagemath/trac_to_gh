Well it depends on a python package named psutils because it mimics that functionality, but the python package in question do not require the C package psutil.

https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil https://pypi.org/project/psutil/

So the plot twist is that we can really dump the old "psutil" package in favor of something designed to be more cross platform from the start.
