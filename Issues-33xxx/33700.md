(split out from #33687)

We move the section on creating SSH keys from the section on Trac to a later section, as creating tickets and participating in discussions on tickets does not require SSH keys.

This is also preparation for #33687 (gitlab workflow).


Depends on #33648

I deleted it because this information is also on the front page of Trac (https://trac.sagemath.org/#legacy-account-request).

I've just edited https://wiki.sagemath.org/#About_this_wiki to also be clearer about this.

The big problem with mentioning the legacy account requests is that no one actually tends to them. (I requested one in January for a special purpose and have not received a reply.)
