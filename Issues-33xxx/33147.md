Currently, Sage uses the generic action of `ZZ` on additive groups to compute scalar multiplications for elliptic curves. This is significantly slower than PARI's specialized `ellmul()` function:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(65537), [1,2,3,4,5])
sage: P = E.random_point()
sage: %timeit 12345*P
241 µs ± 3.31 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
sage: %timeit pari.ellmul(E,P,12345)
47.4 µs ± 645 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
```

This patch adds the use of `ellmul()` for elliptic curves over finite fields. The speedup is very significant for all sizes I've tried (between ~10 and ~1000 bits), ranging from 4× to 8×.

The dependency is by no means essential, but it was convenient since #32786 already adds the `_acted_upon_` method.

Depends on #32786

I am not sure how good it is to rely on upstream caching here:

```
        card = getattr(E, "_order", None)  # get cached order of the curve
        self._order = Integer(E.pari_curve().ellorder(self, card))
        if card is None:
            # ellcard() is essentially free at this point because
            # the curve order was cached by PARI during ellorder().
            E._order = Integer(E.pari_curve().ellcard())
        return self._order
```
Would it be simple to just used the result to set the cache yourself?

It might be better to first check for the attribute here

```
if isinstance(R, FiniteField) and self.__base_ring.is_subring(R) and hasattr(self, '_order'):
```
as I believe the `hasattr` check should be faster (and fail more often). Although this is a very mild suggestion since I don't know what to expect from this code usage in the wild.
