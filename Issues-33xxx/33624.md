```
In my setup `SAGE_VENV` is left unset so it defaults to `sys.prefix = '/usr'`; in this way, sage uses system python packages (and everything works).

However, the `sage` binary is not necessarily installed as `/usr/bin/sage`. For example:
- I build just sagelib from source, so that the sage python packages are placed in `.../pkgs/sagemath-standard/build/lib.linux-x86_64-3.10/` and the sage scripts are placed in `.../pkgs/sagemath-standard/build/scripts-3.10/`. I want to use and doctest this sagelib without installing (which can be done easily by setting PATH and PYTHONPATH to those directories).
 
Now `/usr/bin/sage` may or may not exist (depends on whether I have the system sagemath installed -- this is never true in github CI where the void linux package for sagemath is built and tested in a clean container)

In any case, the directory where the actual `sage` script is located can be obtained as `os.path.dirname(sys.argv[0])` (this will normally be the same as `SAGE_VENV/bin`).

Executing stuff out of the `build/...` directories is not a supported operation.
This is an internal directory of the setuptools build system of the Sage library and is not user-facing.

That's quite unfortunate, since it works very smoothly.

In any case, all the issues here and in #33625 would be the same if sagelib is installed to a custom directory (i.e. not `/usr`) while using `/usr` for system python packages.

PS: in void templates we try to run all tests and checks from upstream as much as possible. However, the standard way is to build and then check from build directory, this is done before packaging. There are no good ways to check packages after installation, I've seen that if a package requires installation to check the void maintainers tend to just disable the check step.

Note that this is not Sage-specific.
Python packaging has deprecated the whole user-facing interface of setuptools.
The process is to build a wheel, to install the wheel (possibly in a virtual env) and to test it there.

I know, but it does work ok in sagelib right now and it would be a pity to loose it.

Still, it seems not quite right to use `sys.prefix` to know the directory where the sage scripts are installed. The `sage` script goes to lengths in order to figure out this directory, let's just use that.

In our void package we use `--install-scripts=/usr/lib/sagemath/bin` for the sage scripts, with `/usr/bin/sage` being a symlink. I'm actually thinking of using `/usr/lib/sagemath/VERSION/bin` so that different versions of sagemath can coexist in the same system.

As I said, all these issues are orthogonal to installing/not installing. Currently my workaround is to delete `sage-venv-config` so that `SAGE_VENV` is left unset (which I can't do in `sage_conf` as explained in #33625). And I still have to apply the patch in this ticket.

`have_program` is on its way out. See #32957. We can replace these nonsense doctests for presence of the `sage` binary by something else on that ticket.

> `have_program` is on its way out. See #32957. We can replace these nonsense doctests for presence of the `sage` binary by something else on that ticket.

I redid the patch with that in mind. Now we test `have_program("sh", "/bin")` and `have_program('there_is_not_a_program_with_this_name', "/bin")`.

Since sage ships some scripts with `/bin/sh` in the shebang, I think we can assume `/bin/sh` to always exist.
