Pyrights recent versions introduced some memory overflow issues, see https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/issues/3239. This broke our github workflow that runs for every ticket.

In fact, we have two runs of pyright on `develop` that only differ in the (automatic) upgrade 232 > 233, see
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/5710759985?check_suite_focus=true (works)
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/5710763334?check_suite_focus=true (fails).

In this ticket, we fix the pyright the last working version 232.
