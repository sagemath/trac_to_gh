Currently, the `.discrete_log()` method for `AdditiveAbelianGroupWrapper`s contains several unnecessary calls to `.order()` for the underlying group elements. In some cases (e.g., elliptic curves over large finite fields), these calls incur significant overhead. We eliminate them and also apply some smaller performance tweaks while we're at it (such as using the exponent instead of the order and `isqrt` instead of `sqrt`).

Example:

```sage
sage: p = 4*prod(primes(3,117))-1
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(p^2),[1,0])
sage: A = E.abelian_group()
sage: %timeit A.discrete_log(E.random_point())
```

Result before this patch:

```
22.6 s ± 765 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```

Result after this patch:

```
3.74 s ± 78.2 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```

<a id='comment:4'></a>I think the list comprehension is faster (in python) than using `map` with a `lambda` function.

I would make `_discrete_log_pgroup` into its own function rather than a ``@`staticmethod`. This can make it easier if you decide you want to Cythonize it too.
