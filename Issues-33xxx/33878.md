This is needed for python 3.11 support (#33842) and to make cypari compatible with current pari version

https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/jqmr6bDjDrk/m/XE2GlB_GBgAJ

Necessary follow ups:
- make cypari thread safe: see [cypari2 #116](https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/116)
- remove optional build time dependency of cysignals on pari: see [cypari2 #130](https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/130)

The new commit contains the recent changes.

The test release contains basically the following:
- https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/103 (requires cython 0.29.20, which videlec does not like: https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/103#issuecomment-1133564219;

  an alternative approach without raised cython requirement could be https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/115)
- https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/109 (videlec doesn't like this approach much and rather wants `cypari2` to push to some signal handling stack of cysignals)
- https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/116 (doesn't work for python 3.6 yet).
