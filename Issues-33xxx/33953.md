Add `graph()`, `projective_degrees()` and `degree()` methods to projective morphisms (rational maps). 

Projective morphisms in Sage represent rational maps. That is, the domain of the definition of the morphism could be a dense subset of its domain.

<a id='comment:14'></a>There seems to be some real doctest failures reported by the patchbot:

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=28903988791302297014049808319140034392 src/sage/schemes/projective/projective_morphism.py  # 1 doctest failed
```
which I can reproduce. The others

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=28903988791302297014049808319140034392 src/sage/homology/graded_resolution.py  # 1 doctest failed

```
I cannot.

Here are my comments:

Since `projective_degrees()` potentially is an expensive computation, I would cache the result (which would also mean it returns a `tuple`).

Perhaps we should call `morphism()` instead `as_morphim()` to indicate that it is an equivalent but different type of object?
