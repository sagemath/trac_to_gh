<div id="comment:0"></div>

Follow-up to #33449, in particular to fix
tikz output in `geometry/polyhedron`.

This fixes

- a typo: `produce` -> `produced`
- the hardcoded Sage version in a doctest

In `src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base6.py`:

```diff
-    %% This TikZ-picture was produce with Sagemath version 9.6.beta3
+    %% This TikZ-picture was produced with Sagemath version ...
```
