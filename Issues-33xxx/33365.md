We add missing interface to `nauty-genbg`, a generator of bipartite graphs.

Nauty's genbg was already compiled and accessible but the interface was missing.

Please notice that `graph6` format does not bear bipartition information, and the bipartition produced by `BipartiteGraph()` may be different from the requested one (via parameters `n1` and `n2`), especially for non-connected ones, where multiple bipartitions may exist. I believe `genbg` produces the graph under assumption that left and right partite sets are formed by vertices `(0..n1-1)` and `(n1..n1+n2-1)`, respectively. This needs to be enforced for the resulting graphs like:

```
         G = BipartiteGraph(s[:-1], format='graph6', partition=(set(0..n1-1),set(n1..n1+n2-1)))

```

I did not test this, but I hope the idea is clear.

I agree that it is not that elegant, but it seems to work. If issues arise down the road, we can fix them then.

Whether or not you include my above nitpick, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Yes, that’s right: code formatting is ````.

Those kind of things were included in the doc though. Anyways, not so important.
