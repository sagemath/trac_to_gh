Nauty's genbg was already compiled and accessible but the interface was missing.

I see that the resulting graphs are created via 

```
         G = BipartiteGraph(s[:-1], format='graph6')

```

Please notice that `graph6` format does not bear bipartition information, and the bipartition produced by `BipartiteGraph()` may be different from the requested one (via parameters `n1` and `n2`), especially for non-connected ones, where multiple bipartitions may exist. I believe `genbg` produces the graph under assumption that left and right partite sets are formed by vertices `(0..n1-1)` and `(n1..n1+n2-1)`, respectively. This needs to be enforced for the resulting graphs like:

```
         G = BipartiteGraph(s[:-1], format='graph6', partition=(set(0..n1-1),set(n1..n1+n2-1)))

```

I did not test this, but I hope the idea is clear.

You are right. Not easy when `n1` and `n2` are somewhere in the `options` string...

I'm not particularly proud of my solution of parsing the auxiliary output, but it's working for as long as the user don't pass option -q (which suppress the auxiliary output).

More of a nitpick: I think `(-s, -a)` and, e.g., `">M"` should be code-formatted.

I agree that it is not that elegant, but it seems to work. If issues arise down the road, we can fix them then.

Whether or not you include my above nitpick, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

I'm not sure to understand what you asked for... I changed to `(``-s``, ``-a``)`.

I prefer to avoid mentioning `">M"`. It can effectively be used to count graphs, but it's not documented and does not even appear in the source code of `genbg`.

Please notice that `nauty-genbg` has the following restrictions on `n1` and `n2`:

```
$ nauty-genbg 5 28
>E genbg: must have n1=1..24, n1+n2=1..32

Should these restrictions be checked by the interface and an appropriate error be raised?
