I think it should be enough to update FPLLL to fix this, no? I can cut a new release (for both).

Thanks. On Debian 11 BKZ.DEFAULT_STRATEGY is not full path, it's just `default.json`. So the path has to be prepended.
In some other cases it's full path, so either nothing should be prepended, or it can be done as in the patch.
