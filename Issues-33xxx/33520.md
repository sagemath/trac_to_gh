Best practice is to only set a upper limit for versions that are known to cause incompatibilities. For example, have a look at:

Note also our release cadence (https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours) is on the order of months to half a year.

Which means when an incompatibility arises, we are not able to react quickly, and we will be months with broken dependencies.

That conversely means that people cannot upgrade networkx for a very long time although there might be no or only minor incompatibilities.

Big -1 from my side on upper limits that don't satisfy one of the criteria outlined in the linked articles.

All those "requirements" are only indications for pip to manage dependencies on its own. If you are not using pip to manage your package (say apt, emerge, pacman...) those requirements are only indication for you as a packager, you can ignore them.

I usually pay attention to lower bounds, but the upper one is checked by running the testsuite if there is one, and comparing the result with the highest version that fits the upper limit.

I tend to agree that higher limits are bets about future development - unless you happen to have inside knowledge about upcoming breakage.

Yes, input from you and other packagers of cutting-edge distributions can inform us about upper bounds that we need to set in `install-requires.txt` if we are not immediately able to adjust tests and code.

In addition to our experience with the upgrades of these packages over the years, 
what is relevant is the policy of the package regarding deprecations - for scipy that's  https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/core-dev/index.html#deprecations

scipy used the MAJOR.MINOR.MICRO versioning, and the policy https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/core-dev/index.html#version-numbering advises that "Minor versions are typically released twice a year and can contain new features, deprecations and bug-fixes." (Micro version steps cannot make new deprecations.)

So such deprecation warnings are routinely introduced twice a year with the release of a new MINOR versions. 

Sage users/developers traditionally value spotless doctest runs (see typical sage-devel posts); the conservative policy of excluding an increase of the MINOR version (`scipy<1.9`, as per this ticket - as our current version is 1.7.x and compatibility with 1.8.x has been taken care of in #33336) protects against such deprecation warnings. 

Of course, it would be valid to argue that this is too conservative. A more relaxed policy would consider that within 6 months a hard incompatibility can only be introduced when the next MINOR version is released; so this would justify setting `scipy<1.10`.

But what is the right policy is for the Sage community to decide and cannot be resolved by a generic appeal to (selected) authority.

Moreover, they actually are arguments for why these upper bounds are not a good idea:
> Note that setting an upper bound on NumPy may affect the ability of your library to be installed alongside other, newer packages.

And

Infinity?

The numpy docs explicitly have a frequent release cycle as a requirement for an upper version limit. The reason for this is also explained in the the second link cited above:

> This means every single major release of every dependency you cap immediately requires you to make a new release or everyone using your library can no longer use the latest version of those libraries. If “make a new release quickly” from above bothered you; well, now you have to make it on every version bump of every pinned dependency.

And sage at it current dev speed cannot guarantee such quick releases. 

For example, what if scipy 1.9 contains an urgent hotfix? Then users of sage + scipy cannot upgrade their scipy for a few months just because we were guessing that scipy 1.9 might break a couple of doctests.

That's an extreme position which puts 0 emphasis on stability.

> For example, what if scipy 1.9 contains an urgent hotfix? 

First of all, scipy has just only started the 1.8 series and will continue making 1.8.x fixes.

Replying to [@mkoeppe](#comment%3A28):
> I'll prepare a version based on the deprecation policies linked to in [comment:14](#comment%3A14) to [comment:16](#comment%3A16)

Thanks!

Note that just because something is deprecated (and later removed) doesn't mean that sage is affected by it. Thus one doesn't have to strictly follow the deprecation timeline, although it makes sense to take them as orientation.

Thanks for the changes.

Shouldn't it be `< 1.12` for scipy? Some feature might be deprecated in `1.9`, then it stays deprecated for half a year (= 2 minor releases, i.e. 1.10 and 1.11) before it is potentially removed in `1.12`.

Moreover, I think it would be a good idea to distill our discussion and add a remark to the dev docs that upper bounds should be used carefully and need to be documented.
