(from #33546)

When running doctests via `sage --pytest` (added in #33546), there are many failed tests due to some issues with assumptions and/or symbolic  variables and/or deprecation warnings.
To see examples of these failures, run pytest on

```
src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/examples/sphere.py
src/sage/manifolds/utilities.py
src/sage/manifolds/chart.py
```

UPDATE - deprecation warnings are OK, thanks to `92bbf1d` in comment:10

Note `Captured stderr call` - this does not arise with the unchanged `tox.ini`.

Perhaps the problem is in the way warning level is set in `deprecation()`, I don't know.

<a id='comment:8'></a>With vanilla python pytest still needs a bit of monkey-patching of the warning system, namely, `warnings.showwarning`.
Note that Sage does it too, but in a trickier way.

```python
# c.py
import warnings
dowarn = warnings.showwarning
def showwarn(message, category, filename, lineno, file=None, line=None):
    import sys
    dowarn(message, category, filename, lineno, sys.stdout, line)

warnings.showwarning = showwarn # use stdout instead of stderr


class tst:
    """
    >>> len(tst.__subclasses__()) >= 0
    True
    >>> import warnings
    >>> warnings.warn("foo")
    <doctest ...: UserWarning: foo
      warnings.warn("foo")
    """
    pass
```

at least the above works:

```
$ pytest --doctest-modules -p no:warnings c.py
========================================== test session starts ===========================================
platform linux -- Python 3.9.2, pytest-7.1.3, pluggy-0.13.0

=========================================== 1 passed in 0.03s ============================================
```

It's still not clear how to fix Sage's pytesting: I tried a similar hack with
showwarning in `src/sage/doctest/forker.py`, with the one in comment:7, to no avail...

These are recognized in https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/misc/package_dir.py#L132\n(As Tobias pointed out in previous discussions, using such marker files was rejected during the PEP 420 design discussion; but our source tree already had these files, so we repurposed them for discovery.)\n\nSo a sage-specific solution could be to monkey-patch https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/src/_pytest/_py/path.py so that it understands the Sage source layout. \n\nFor upstream pytest, perhaps an intermediate goal could be to have a documented hook that makes this monkey-patching easier.",

<a id='comment:26'></a>The problem with PEP 420 implicit namespace packages for pytest and similar source discovery is that there is no clear way to find the root of a source tree.

In Sage, there is a solution for that -- we have marker files `all.py` and `all__*.py` that distinguish namespace packages from non-package directories. These are recognized in https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/misc/package_dir.py#L132
(As Tobias pointed out in previous discussions, using such marker files was rejected during the PEP 420 design discussion; but our source tree already had these files, so we repurposed them for discovery.)

So a sage-specific solution could be to monkey-patch https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/src/_pytest/_py/path.py so that it understands the Sage source layout. 

For upstream pytest, perhaps an intermediate goal could be to have a documented hook that makes this monkey-patching easier.

please see the reply to https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10569#issuecomment-1344122839, basically, upstream says monkey-patching this will break, soon.

On https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10569 let us further discuss with the upstream how we can go forward here.
