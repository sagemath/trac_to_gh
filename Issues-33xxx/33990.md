Currently the `Subset_s.an_element()` method returns a different result from the `Subset_s._an_element_()` method. The proposed fix is to move the current implementation of `an_element` to `_an_element_` and let the parent framework take care of the rest.

```
sage: from sage.combinat.subset import Subsets_s
sage: Subsets_s([1,2,3])._an_element_()
{}
sage: Subsets_s([1,2,3]).an_element()
{1, 2}
