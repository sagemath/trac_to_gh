(split out from #30207)

https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#installation-in-a-multiuser-environment should be updated:

- Don't edit the script
- Just symlink to the `sage` script in venv

We also add a link from the README to an optional step described only in the installation manual.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Replying to [comment:6 jhpalmieri]:
> (b) Should the suggestion be to make a symlink to `SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage`?


No. `SAGE_ROOT/sage` uses `src/bin/sage` to allow for uses in unconfigured source trees.

After a build of Sage, using the installed version is more canonical.
