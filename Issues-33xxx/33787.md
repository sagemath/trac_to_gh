(split out from #30207)

https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#installation-in-a-multiuser-environment should be updated:

- Don't edit the script
- Just symlink to the `sage` script in venv

We also add a link from the README to an optional step described only in the installation manual.

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
The suggestion to use

```sh
$ sudo ln -s $(sage -sh -c 'ls $SAGE_ROOT/venv/bin/sage') /usr/local/bin
```
is not consistent with the top-level `sage` script, which has

```sh
if [ -x "$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage" ]; then
    exec "$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage" "$@"
elif [ -x "$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage" ]; then # if in a stripped binary
    # Note in this case we assume that SAGE_LOCAL is the "local" subdirectory
    exec "$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage" "$@"
else
    echo >&2 "$0: no Sage installation found in \$SAGE_ROOT=$SAGE_ROOT"
    exit 1
fi
```
(a) Should the Sage script look in `venv/bin` rather than `local/bin`? (b) Should the suggestion be to make a symlink to `SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage`?

"stripped binary" might refer to what `make micro_release` creates. I have never used, but I think it is in use in the user-facing Docker containers somehow. It deletes a lot of stuff, but it does leave `src/bin` around.

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A6):
> (b) Should the suggestion be to make a symlink to `SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage`?

No. `SAGE_ROOT/sage` uses `src/bin/sage` to allow for uses in unconfigured source trees.

After a build of Sage, using the installed version is more canonical.

<a id='comment:15'>Comment 15:</a>
How can you run

```
sudo ln -s $(sage -sh -c 'ls $SAGE_ROOT/venv/bin/sage') /usr/local/bin
```
is `sage` isn't already in your path?
