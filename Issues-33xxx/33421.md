Needed after #32993, which enriched the documentation
with pictures of elliptic curve plots.

The code for drawing those uses labels from Cremona's
elliptic curve database.

In a fresh clone, `make -j1` builds `sagemath_doc_html`
before `elliptic_curves`, and fails.

The error message somewhat misleadingly suggests to install
the full elliptic curves database provided by the
`database_cremona_ellcurve` optional spkg,
when only the mini Cremona database provided by the
`elliptic_curves` standard spkg is in fact needed.

Since `elliptic_curves` is standard, hinting at
installing `database_cremona_ellcurve` when an
elliptic curve cannot be found by label is understandable.

Thus adding the missing new dependency on `elliptic_curves`
to `sagemath_doc_html` is all that is needed here.

Is this, building the doc before the sage library, normal?

No, `sagemath_doc_html` depends on `sagelib` which depends on `eclib`.

Should `elliptic_curves` be added to `sagelib`'s or `eclib`'s dependencies?
