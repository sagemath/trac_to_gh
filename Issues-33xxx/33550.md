As analyzed in [#33531 comment:9](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/33531#comment:9), this is due to pytest running on the temporary file `my_script.sage` and failing with

```

```

In other words, pytest doesn't know how to analyze `.sage` files. We fix this by letting pytest know that `.sage` files are essentially normal python files after they run through the preparser (this is accomplished by implementing an importlib.Loader for `.sage` files, which is then used by pytest).

Sadly, this doesn't completely fix the issue and the above test in cmdline still fails. However, the error is now

```

```
which comes from some issues of pytesting files outside of the sage source directory. In fact, running `sage -t` on a copy of the offending file somewhere in `/src` works.
