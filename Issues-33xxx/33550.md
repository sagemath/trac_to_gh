As analyzed inticket: ticket:33531#comment:9#comment:33531, this is due to pytest running on the temporary file `my_script.sage` and failing with

```

In other words, pytest doesn't know how to analyze `.sage` files. We fix this by letting pytest know that `.sage` files are essentially normal python files after they run through the preparser (this is accomplished by implementing an importlib.Loader for `.sage` files, which is then used by pytest).

Sadly, this doesn't completely fix the issue and the above test in cmdline still fails. However, the error is now

```
ERROR: not found: /home/tobias/.sage/temp/DESKTOP-MRB66LP/15784/dir_5qrixjen/my_script.sage
(no name '/home/tobias/.sage/temp/DESKTOP-MRB66LP/15784/dir_5qrixjen/my_script.sage' in any of [])
```
which comes from some issues of pytesting files outside of the sage source directory. In fact, running `sage -t` on a copy of the offending file somewhere in `/src` works.

Thanks for the pointer. The code of this ticket could indeed be helpful for #27074. What would be a good place to put the added importlib loader so that the can easily be reused in #27074?

This actually looks very nice and perhaps the classes `SageSourceFinder`, `SageSourceLoader` could find a place somewhere in `sage.repl`? (Modularization context: #29941)

The actual activation (`sys.meta_path.append(SageSourceFinder())`) would stay where it is, in conftest.py

Don't you think that goes way beyond the scope of this ticket and would need proper documentation and more testing?

Good point, but note that we don't actually have any `.sage` files in our test suite. 

What you are trying to solve is a failure from testing the behavior of the Sage doctester on user files. And for this the metapath manipulation seems to be an overkill.
