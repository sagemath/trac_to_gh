This should work (as long as it accepts negative values, which there is nothing wrong with it, it is just an empty set), but it results in an overflow error:

```
sage: Partitions(-5)
Partitions of the integer -5
sage: _.cardinality()
```

That is for the default using `flint`, but `gap` is wrong:

```
sage: Pm5.cardinality(algorithm='gap')
1
sage: Pm5.cardinality(algorithm='pari')
0
```
This is needed for doctests on #30680.

I would rather think that most combinatorial objects return a `ValueError`:
see `DyckWords(-2)`, `BinaryTrees(-2)`, `Posets(-2)`,  `Tableaux(-2)` and `TamariIntervalPosets(-2)`.

`AlternatingSignMatrices(-2)` returns an `ArithmeticError`.

But `Compositions(-2)`, `SuperPartitions(-2)` and `Permutations(-2)`"work".

If you prefer, returning the empty set would be another solution. Do we have such an object ?

Perhaps it would be better for these to raise a `ValueError` to be consistent with other objects. However, we would also need to make sure that this continues to work:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: list(s.basis(-2))
[]
```

We do not seem to have a singular `EmptySet` object, just `EmptySetError`.

This looks simple and these things work:

```
sage: P = Partitions(-3)
sage: P.cardinality()
0
sage: list(P)
[]
sage: for a in P: print(a)
sage:
```
I'm somewhat agnostic about whether `Partitions(-3)` should raise an error or return an empty set. It feels somewhat different in flavor than `Posets(-3)` because it doesn't make sense to ask for a poset with `-3` elements, while you could ask for all partitions of the number `-3` — there just aren't any. But I don't have strong feelings either way.

For the sake of (e.g.) the Euler pentagonal number theorem, it makes the most sense to return the empty set. Otherwise, the sum needs to be broken up at some nasty bounds.

An interesting comparison point:

```
sage: Pm = Permutations(-3)
sage: [x for x in Pm]    
[[]]
sage: Pm.cardinality()
ValueError: factorial -- must be nonnegative
```
So there are bugs there that can be handled on another ticket.
