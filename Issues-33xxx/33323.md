This should work (as long as it accepts negative values, which there is nothing wrong with it, it is just an empty set), but it results in an overflow error:

```
sage: Partitions(-5)
Partitions of the integer -5
sage: _.cardinality()
```

```

sage: Pm5.cardinality(algorithm='pari')

This is needed for doctests on #30680.

<a id='comment:2'></a>I would rather think that most combinatorial objects return a `ValueError`:
see `DyckWords(-2)`, `BinaryTrees(-2)`, `Posets(-2)`,  `Tableaux(-2)` and `TamariIntervalPosets(-2)`.

`AlternatingSignMatrices(-2)` returns an `ArithmeticError`.

But `Compositions(-2)`, `SuperPartitions(-2)` and `Permutations(-2)`"work".

If you prefer, returning the empty set would be another solution. Do we have such an object ?

I'm somewhat agnostic about whether `Partitions(-3)` should raise an error or return an empty set. It feels somewhat different in flavor than `Posets(-3)` because it doesn't make sense to ask for a poset with `-3` elements, while you could ask for all partitions of the number `-3` — there just aren't any. But I don't have strong feelings either way.
