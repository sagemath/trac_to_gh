I was trying to calculate the finite differences of http://oeis.org/A000127 as follows:


```sage
C.<x> = CFiniteSequences(QQ)
S = C.guess([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 57, 99, 163, 256, 386, 562, 794, 1093])
X = C(x)

S[0:10]         # [ 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 57, 99, 163, 256 ]
(X*S)[0:10]     # [ 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 31, 57, 99 ]
(S - X*S)[0:10] # [ 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 26, 42, 64, 93, 130 ]

f(n) = (S - X*S).closed_form()
[f(n) for n in range(10)] # [ 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 26, 42, 64, 93 ]
```

For some reason, the slice operator is skipping `S[5] = 15` and yielding `26` instead. Here is the sequence in recurrence form:


```sage
T = C.from_recurrence([-1,4,-6,4],[1,1,2,4,8])
T == S - X*S # True
4 * T[4] - 6 * T[3] + 4 * T[2] - T[1] == T[5] # 15 == 26
```

It seems to have something to do with the fact that there are more than 4 initial terms. The "natural" sequence starts `0,1,2,4,8`

```sage
(S - X*S - S[0])[0:10] # [ 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 26, 42, 64, 93 ]
```

I believe I've tracked down the problem.


```python
# determine start values (may be different from _get_item_ values)
alen = max(self._deg, num.degree() + 1)
R = LaurentSeriesRing(br, parent.variable_name(), default_prec=alen)
rem = num % den
if den != 1:
    self._a = R(num / den).list()
    self._aa = R(rem / den).list()[:self._deg]  # needed for _get_item_
else:
    self._a = num.list()
if len(self._a) < alen:
    self._a.extend([0] * (alen - len(self._a)))
```

In the initializer, `R(rem / den).list()` starts at the first non-zero coefficient. For the example above `C.from_recurrence([1,1],[1,1,1])` has `rem = x` and the extra 0 isn't accounted for in the list. This is necessary for `self._aa` in order to get the correct answers.

I will see if I can write a patch.

Each commit addresses a separate bug. The first bug is that `R(rem / den).list()` needs to include the initial zeroes from the Taylor series. This causes the test

```sage
sage: s = C.from_recurrence([1,1],[1,1,1])
sage: s[0:5]
[1, 1, 1, 2, 3]
```

to fail.

The second bug is that when we are using `self._aa` it is because we are computing from degree 0 and this needs to be addressed by resetting the offset to 0. This causes the tests

```sage
sage: s = C(x^2 * (1 - x)^-2); s[0:10]
[0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
sage: s = C(x^3 * (1 - x)^-2); s[0:10]
[0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

to fail.
