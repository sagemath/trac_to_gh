The dominant part of the runtime in the creation of general extensions is sometimes finding a root of the defining polynomial in the backend extension.  There are various well-known methods for doing this that Sage does not have implementations for: Hensel lifting in the p-adic case (it's available for rational polynomials), Panayi's root finding algorithm, single factor lifting.  We should implement some of these and profile to improve the runtime for root finding.

Depends on #28466
