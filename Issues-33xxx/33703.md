This is done in Java, but the concepts are clear to me. I am planning to implement mutex locks in Cython and use them in a similar manner.

Do you think this will work?

The lock part is pretty much clear to me. What is not clear to me is the following:

- What happens at the merge.

Thank you for these resources. I will go through them properly. As for the parts that are not clear, I was planning to modify the already present `boruvka` function in `SAGE_ROOT/src/graphs/spanning_tree.pyx` to use mutex locks and multithreading. Thus the vertex and merging will be as done in that algorithm, unless I feel there is need for changing that.

Yes, if you have different sage version, then this is how you have to do it. Of course, you can create an appropriate symlink to your sage to simplify things.

This will only build what changed during the last build. So if you only modify `spanning_tree.pyx`, it builds this and everything that depends on it.

It might be best to think about some reasonable benchmarks first and then do changes.
If you are going to use random graphs, you can reproduce them with the help of `graph6_string`.

A little starter for C++:

```
sage: cython('''
....: # distutils: language=c++
....: from libcpp.vector cimport vector
....: cdef vector[int] foo
....: ''')
```

If we are going to do it parallel, I would really recommend rethinking the data structures. What is `merge` going to do.
E.g. the whole business of caching seems to be to complicated during the algorithm.
All we need to have is a map between the vertices and `range(n)`.
Then our vertices have index `size_t` and we could do something like:

```
sage: cython('''
....: # distutils: language=c++
....: from libcpp.vector cimport vector
....: cdef struct edge:
....:     size_t vertex1
....:     size_t vertex2
....:     size_t weight
....: cdef vector[edge] edges = vector[edge]()
....: ''')
```

However, if you change branches, then more files might be touched. An initial build always takes time, but once you only change that one file, it won't take that long.

I am not sure how `std::set` can be used as a `DisjointSet`. Can you explain?

<a id='comment:22'></a>What do you mean by `DisjointSet`. What is this? What does this class do.

Is the purpose of `DisjointSet` to map each vertex to the current adjacency list?

There is no need to implement a `C++` class in cython. We can just import it using `cdef extern from "myclass.cpp":` Then it will just compile the corrsponding part.

I think I almost got it. Before we proceed, I'm asking you to provide examples of graphs. Otherwise this whole thing is pointless. If the current algorithms work fine for all graphs, then we shouldn't worry about it.

A `DisjointSet` is as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure. It will support operations
* `makeset(i)`: It will make a new node with value `i`, parent as itself and rank 0
* `findset(i)`: It will find the root of its tree
* `union(i, j)`: It will merge two disjoint forests of which `i` and `j` are vertices of respectively, into a single tree.
