... instead of separate logs `ptest.log`, `ptestalllong.log`, etc.

Before the test run, the actual command line (`sage -t`) is now shown in the log.

We also deprecate `make testoptional` etc., which are identical to the targets without `optional`.

We also modify the targets `test-nodoc` etc. so that they skip all tests that depend on the documentation.
