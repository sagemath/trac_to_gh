https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer, which is used by screenshotting tools such as https://github.com/marketplace/actions/screenshots-ci-action

This will allow us to drop the dependency of the docbuild (html and pdf) on Jmol (#31027) and improve the quality of the output.

It sounds a silly question, but why saving static images from 3d graphics in the documentation is an issue?

I meant why we should save static images in the first place. In interactive use of the documentation, threejs provides a menu to save png image.

Of course for the HTML doc I do prefer embedding the notebook (#33507).
But for PDF we probably don't have a better option.

In #33507, I take a simple approach to provide static images for pdf documentation. 

I think that seeking for an automatic way to produce static images from live images would not be worth the efforts. One of the reasons is that taking a good-looking static image needs human intervention anyway.
