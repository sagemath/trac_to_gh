This change could have a number of unintended consequences with code in the wild. It essentially is doing some of the job via `_coerce_map_via`. I would aim to remove all of the `_coerce_try` as there are only 5 of them with the corresponding checks using `_coerce_map_via`. Technically, this is a more strict behavior because `_coerce_try` does

```
R => S -> T
```
where `=>` is a coercion and `->` is a conversion, and `_coerce_map_via` is seeing if we can do

```
R => S => T
```
Although from what I can see, the `S -> T` always has a coercion map. If we instead do the replacement I am suggesting, then there should be no behavior change and we are one step closer to fully removing the old parent/coercion system.

Thank you. However, I don’t think these code paths are not doctested because your change returns a map, whereas before they returned an element, and the inputs do not seem to match what the documentation of `_coerce_map_via` says.

We also will want to deprecate `_coerce_try` formally too.

I am curious why you have a deprecation in `parent_base.pyx` rather than replacing it with the equivalent code?

```diff
-return self._coerce_try(x,(self._base))
+return self(self._base._coerce_(x))
```
That class is there currently for backwards compatibility for the parents not yet fully to the new coercion system. I think this will take care of those deprecation messages.

I think you can also simplify this in `polynomial_quotient_ring.py`:

```diff
-return self._coerce_map_via([self.polynomial_ring()], P)(x)
+return self.coerce(self.polynomial_ring().coerce(x))
```
