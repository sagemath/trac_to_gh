<a id='comment:7'></a>Thank you. However, I don’t think these code paths are not doctested because your change returns a map, whereas before they returned an element, and the inputs do not seem to match what the documentation of `_coerce_map_via` says.

We also will want to deprecate `_coerce_try` formally too.

That class is there currently for backwards compatibility for the parents not yet fully to the new coercion system. I think this will take care of those deprecation messages.

I think you can also simplify this in `polynomial_quotient_ring.py`:
