The aime of this ticket is to fix the following issues:

```sage
sage: L = ZZ.localization(5)
sage: o = L(0)
sage: o.is_unit()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
```


```sage
sage: R = ZZ.localization(5)
sage: S = R.localization(~5)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```

```sage
sage: Lau.<u, v> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: LauL = Lau.localization(u+1)
sage: LauL(~u)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError:
```

In addition a method `factor` is added.

Can you also add this to the docstring (copied from the polynomial factorization):

```
   Return the factorization of this polynomial.

   INPUT:

   - ``proof`` -- ignored
```
and a `proof=None` default argument (for compatibility, although not every `factor()` implementation seems to support it)?

Addendum: You can also leave off the `INPUT:` too if you want since it is ignored.

Yes, you are right, Travis! But, I think instead of ignoring it it could by useful to pass the keyword to the `factor` method over the base ring in case it is given explicitely.

I wish one could change the display of the variables in the localisation.

Something like:

```
sage: P.<X, Y> = QQ[]
sage: L.<x, y> = P.localization(X - Y)
```
where the generators would display as `X`, `Y` in `P`
and as `x`, `y` in `L`.

That could be another ticket.

One could remove a pair of parentheses here:

```diff
-        fac = [(P(f), e) for (f, e) in F]
+        fac = [(P(f), e) for f, e in F]
```
but leaving them is fine too and even emphasizes
the transformation.

The shorter name `extra_units` might shorten
some lines with respect to `additional_units`.

One could split this line:

```diff
-            additional_units = [au for au in additional_units if ~au not in base_ring._additional_units]  # :trac:`33463`
+            additional_units = [u for u in additional_units
+                                if ~u not in base_ring._additional_units]
```

These are all minor points. No need to revert positive review.
