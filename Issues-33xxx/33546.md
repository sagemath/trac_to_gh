As suggested in #33232#comment:1, `./sage --pytest` now uses pytest to discover and run doctests.

To test, run `./sage --pytest src/sage/manifolds/`. This results in 

```
48 failed, 1416 passed, 7 warnings
```
With many of the failed tests being due to some issues with assumptions and/or symbolic  variables and/or deprecation warnings.
To see examples of these failures, run pytest on

```
src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/examples/sphere.py
src/sage/manifolds/utilities.py
src/sage/manifolds/chart.py
```

We also add tests that verify that `sage --pytest` (and `sage -t`) correctly complain about failing doctests.

Follow-ups:
- #33826 Fix these issues
- #33825 Use `pytest-parallel` or `pytest-xdist` to run pytest in parallel
- #33827 Also run doctests defined in cython files using https://github.com/lgpage/pytest-cython

Cannot agree more. Plus using standard tools increases synergy effects, for example IDEs have special support for pytest but not for sage's custom test runner. Also new developers might have heard of and used pytest before, but have to learn sage's test runner conventions (eg command line args).

That's right.

> But as far as I'm aware there are no extensive tests of sage with concurrency


Yes, we shouldn't test this -- there is a lot of global state and no attempts in Sage library whatsoever to support threading on the Python level.

> multiple threads sharing the same state (i.e. pytest-parallel). 


Looks like `pytest-parallel` can do both (https://pypi.org/project/pytest-parallel/). We would only use `--workers`, not `--tests-per-worker`.

But `sage -t` also runs pytest, so now there will be failures in `sage -t`.

Correct?

The idea is that pytest only looks for doctests if `--doctest-modules` is specified. We do this only for `sage -pytest` but not in `sage -t`. However, this check got lost in one of the git merges so thanks for noticing it!

@@ -1,3 +1,25 @@
+As suggested in #33232#comment:1, `./sage --pytest` now uses pytest to discover and run doctests.
+
+To test, run `./sage --pytest src/sage/manifolds/`. This results in 
+
+```
+48 failed, 1416 passed, 7 warnings
+```
+With many of the failed tests being due to some issues with assumptions and/or symbolic  variables and/or deprecation warnings.
+To see examples of these failures, run pytest on
+
+```
+src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/examples/sphere.py
+src/sage/manifolds/utilities.py
+src/sage/manifolds/chart.py
+```
+
+We also add tests that verify that `sage --pytest` (and `sage -t`) correctly complain about failing doctests.
+
+Follow-ups:
+- #33826 Fix these issues
+- #33825 Use `pytest-parallel` or `pytest-xdist` to run pytest in parallel
+- #33827 Also run doctests defined in cython files using https://github.com/lgpage/pytest-cython
