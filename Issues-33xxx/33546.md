As suggested in #33232#comment:1, `./sage --pytest` now uses pytest to discover and run doctests.

To test, run `./sage --pytest src/sage/manifolds/`. This results in 

```
48 failed, 1416 passed, 7 warnings
```
With many of the failed tests being due to some issues with assumptions and/or symbolic  variables and/or deprecation warnings.
To see examples of these failures, run pytest on

```
src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/examples/sphere.py
src/sage/manifolds/utilities.py
src/sage/manifolds/chart.py
```

We also add tests that verify that `sage --pytest` (and `sage -t`) correctly complain about failing doctests.

Follow-ups:
- #33826 Fix these issues
- #33825 Use `pytest-parallel` or `pytest-xdist` to run pytest in parallel
- #33827 Also run doctests defined in cython files using https://github.com/lgpage/pytest-cython

In principle this seems to work now. To test, run `./sage --pytest src/test_doctest.py`. Feedback welcome.

Any idea why the import of `Integer` is necessary in `test_doctest.py` and how to do this on a global level? How is this done for `sage -t`?

That's right.

> But as far as I'm aware there are no extensive tests of sage with concurrency


Yes, we shouldn't test this -- there is a lot of global state and no attempts in Sage library whatsoever to support threading on the Python level.

> multiple threads sharing the same state (i.e. pytest-parallel). 


Looks like `pytest-parallel` can do both (https://pypi.org/project/pytest-parallel/). We would only use `--workers`, not `--tests-per-worker`.

pytest now runs doctests, and you say that there will be failures.

But `sage -t` also runs pytest, so now there will be failures in `sage -t`.

Correct?

The idea is that pytest only looks for doctests if `--doctest-modules` is specified. We do this only for `sage -pytest` but not in `sage -t`. However, this check got lost in one of the git merges so thanks for noticing it!
