I see. But in this case, the default is an empty dict and there actually occurs no pop to the default. On the other hand, the condition check on the second line is more complicated than the original. So we lose a tiny bit while fixing nothing. No?

<a id='comment:8'></a>
indeed. But in my opinion, it is a safe idea to never ever modify the default argument.

The idea is to fix the warning issued by "lgtm":

https://lgtm.com/projects/g/sagemath/sage/alerts/?mode=tree&severity=error&ruleFocus=4840097

One could argue that the case of "empty dict" and "pop" needs no correction, but it seems to me that one can fix this little issue, despite its trivial nature.

Okay. I guess the tiny bit lost is really tiny, and we get cleaner code instead.
