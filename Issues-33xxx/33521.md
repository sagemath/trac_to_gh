pytest assumes the directory containing the code to be tested is writable. This is not currently the case on sage-on-distro were most of the time testing is done after installing on the system.

Here is a typical result

```
============================= test session starts ==============================
platform linux -- Python 3.10.2, pytest-7.0.1, pluggy-1.0.0
rootdir: /usr
plugins: hypothesis-6.38.0
collected 0 items

=============================== warnings summary ===============================
../../usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/_pytest/cacheprovider.py:433
  /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/_pytest/cacheprovider.py:433: PytestCacheWarning: could not create cache path /usr/.pytest_cache/v/cache/nodeids
    config.cache.set("cache/nodeids", sorted(self.cached_nodeids))

../../usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/_pytest/stepwise.py:52
  /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/_pytest/stepwise.py:52: PytestCacheWarning: could not create cache path /usr/.pytest_cache/v/cache/stepwise
    session.config.cache.set(STEPWISE_CACHE_DIR, [])

-- Docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/capture-warnings.html
```
pytest can be started with some option to change the location of the cache directory `-o cache_dir=...`. pytest is currently called from `sage-runtest` and this is where we may want to apply any changes.

Can you please try running pytest with `--rootdir SAGE_SRC` and/or `-c SAGE_SRC/tox.ini`.
