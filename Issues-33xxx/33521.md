pytest assumes the directory containing the code to be tested is writable. This is not currently the case on sage-on-distro were most of the time testing is done after installing on the system.

Here is a typical result

```
============================= test session starts ==============================
platform linux -- Python 3.10.2, pytest-7.0.1, pluggy-1.0.0

plugins: hypothesis-6.38.0

```
pytest can be started with some option to change the location of the cache directory `-o cache_dir=...`. pytest is currently called from `sage-runtest` and this is where we may want to apply any changes.

Can you please try running pytest with `--rootdir SAGE_SRC` and/or `-c SAGE_SRC/tox.ini`.
