(addressing slabbe's questions from [#33092 comment:23](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/33092#comment:23))

Some questions arise with respect to `is_present()`,
`is_functional()` and `require()`:

- why does `Feature.require()` not check
  that `is_functional()` is `True`?
- should `is_present()` always return `False`
  when `is_functional` returns `False` (while
  the method names suggest `is_present` could
  be `True` while `is_functional` is `False`)?

Choices made in this ticket:

- only `is_present()` should be called from outside
- it always checks that `is_functional()` returns True
- the `require()` method only calls `is_present()`

A further step, not done in this ticket, would be,
as suggested in [comment:14](#comment%3A14), to rename `is_functional`
to `_is_functional`, since only `is_present` is supposed
to be used from outside.

I believe that the original idea was to use this in the build process of [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath). This influence some of the choices we made back then. If I understand correctly, that's not what we are planning to do anymore.

Anyway, `require` calls `is_present` which calls `is_functional`. At least that's the idea. As far as I recall, `is_functional` is just meant as a hook that you can override to add an additional check while relying on the generic `is_present` check. It should maybe be renamed to `_is_functional` to make this more obvious.

So, `is_present` means: is the feature present and functional.

Similarly, `require` means: require this feature to be present in the above sense.

I believe that the task here is to improve the documentation of these methods if that is not sufficiently clear.

I'd propose to rename `is_present` to `is_present_and_functional` and `is_functional` to `_is_functional`. I agree that it's confusing.

Yes, that is a bug in `JoinFeature`. (Copied over from the `Latte` feature from which it was created.)

Well, the full context of that line is `FeatureNotPresentError: imagemagick is not available.` When I read this and I try to interpret it, I understand that the command `convert` was simply not found on the machine. This is not the information that we want to give. The situation we have here is more tricky. The `convert` is available, the problem is that it does not work well. And here we should not say to the user "here is how to install convert" as we do currently.

Or, maybe, I am wrong on the meaning of the word `feature` or the word `present`? For you, what is the definition of a feature?

Thanks for the answers. I agree to keep it simple and binary YES/NO. I do not have use cases for more levels of presence.

I allow myself to ask whether `is_present()` is still the good yes/no question we want to ask with the current design? Maybe a better name for it exists? Possibly `is_present_and_functional()` as suggested earlier? or something else?

I agree that my main point boils down to give good information to the user when `require()` fails.
