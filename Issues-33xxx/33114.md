(addressing slabbe's questions from ticket:33092#comment:23)

Some questions arise with respect to `is_present()`,
`is_functional()` and `require()`:

- why does `Feature.require()` not check
  that `is_functional()` is `True`?
- should `is_present()` always return `False`
  when `is_functional` returns `False` (while
  the method names suggest `is_present` could
  be `True` while `is_functional` is `False`)?

Choices made in this ticket:

- only `is_present()` should be called from outside
- it always checks that `is_functional()` returns True
- the `require()` method only calls `is_present()`

A further step, not done in this ticket, would be,
as suggested in [comment:14](#comment%3A14), to rename `is_functional`
to `_is_functional`, since only `is_present` is supposed
to be used from outside.

So, `is_present` means: is the feature present and functional.

Similarly, `require` means: require this feature to be present in the above sense.

I believe that the task here is to improve the documentation of these methods if that is not sufficiently clear.

Ok, this is how I understood the feature code up to today, but the meaning of `is_present` vs `is_functional` always perturbed me.

When we speak with someone verbally, it is possible that we observe for example as in #33092 that imagemagick is "installed" on a machine, thus the convert command "is present", but it "is not functional" because it can't handle PNG files for instance. In real life, it happens that a feature is present but not functional. This is why the current design is weird a little (but probably easy to fix, for example by adding a new method `is_present_and_functional()` that would be used by `require()` and in the sagemath library.)

What I realised today in ticket:33092#comment:20 is that JoinFeature currently does not follow the same behavior with respect to `is_present` vs `is_functional`. Instead, it follows what we would be saying logically: a feature may be present but not functional.

I'd propose to rename `is_present` to `is_present_and_functional` and `is_functional` to `_is_functional`. I agree that it's confusing.

-Maybe changes needs to be done with respect to `is_present()`, `is_functional()` and `require()`. In particular, I have the following questions for @mkoeppe:
-- why `Feature.require()` does not check that `is_functional()` is True?
-- should `is_present()` always return False when `is_functional` return False (even if the vocabulary that is used should logically allow it)?
+Some questions arise with respect to `is_present()`,
+`is_functional()` and `require()`:
+
+- why does `Feature.require()` not check
+  that `is_functional()` is `True`?
+- should `is_present()` always return `False`
+  when `is_functional` returns `False` (while
+  the method names suggest `is_present` could
+  be `True` while `is_functional` is `False`)?
 
 Choices made in this ticket:
 
-- only `is_present()` should be called from outside, it always checks that `is_functional()` returns True.
-- `require()` method only calls `is_present()`
-- A next step further not done in this ticket is, as suggested in [comment:14](#comment%3A14), to rename `is_functional` to `_is_functional` since only is_present is supposed to be used from outside. 
+- only `is_present()` should be called from outside
+- it always checks that `is_functional()` returns True
+- the `require()` method only calls `is_present()`
 
+A further step, not done in this ticket, would be,
+as suggested in [comment:14](#comment%3A14), to rename `is_functional`
+to `_is_functional`, since only `is_present` is supposed
+to be used from outside.
