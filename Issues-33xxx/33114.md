(addressing slabbe's questions from [#33092 comment:23](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/33092#comment:23))

Some questions arise with respect to `is_present()`,
`is_functional()` and `require()`:

- why does `Feature.require()` not check
  that `is_functional()` is `True`?
- should `is_present()` always return `False`
  when `is_functional` returns `False` (while
  the method names suggest `is_present` could
  be `True` while `is_functional` is `False`)?

Choices made in this ticket:

- only `is_present()` should be called from outside
- it always checks that `is_functional()` returns True
- the `require()` method only calls `is_present()`

A further step, not done in this ticket, would be,
as suggested in [comment:14](#comment%3A14), to rename `is_functional`
to `_is_functional`, since only `is_present` is supposed
to be used from outside.

So, `is_present` means: is the feature present and functional.

Similarly, `require` means: require this feature to be present in the above sense.

I believe that the task here is to improve the documentation of these methods if that is not sufficiently clear.

I'd propose to rename `is_present` to `is_present_and_functional` and `is_functional` to `_is_functional`. I agree that it's confusing.

Thanks for the answers. I agree to keep it simple and binary YES/NO. I do not have use cases for more levels of presence.

I allow myself to ask whether `is_present()` is still the good yes/no question we want to ask with the current design? Maybe a better name for it exists? Possibly `is_present_and_functional()` as suggested earlier? or something else?

I agree that my main point boils down to give good information to the user when `require()` fails.

-- why `Feature.require()` does not check that `is_functional()` is True?
