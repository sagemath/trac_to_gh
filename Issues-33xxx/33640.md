As reported on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/Ca661TP_3Ug/m/f2lZtUXLAwAJ), sage fails to factor expressions that expand to something very easy, such as `x^2` or `0`. Instead, it returns the original expression.

```
sage: ((x + 1)^2 - 2*x - 1).factor()  # bad (should be x^2)
(x + 1)^2 - 2*x - 1
sage: ((x + 1)^2 - x^2 - 2*x - 1).factor()  # bad (should be 0)
(x + 1)^2 - x^2 - 2*x - 1
sage: ((x + 2)^2 - 2*x - 3).factor()  # good
(x + 1)^2
```

Keywords: **factor, polynomial**

Maybe a silly question, but I notice that `symbolic.expression.Expression.factor()` says "If you are factoring a polynomial with rational coefficients (and dontfactor is empty) the factorization is done using Singular
instead of Maxima, so the following is very fast instead of dreadfully slow".
I'm just wondering, if it concerns a polynomial, why not using `Polynomial` instead?

```
sage: P
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field
sage: p
0
sage: p = (x-y)^2*(y-z)*(z-x) + (y-z)^2*(z-x)*(x-y) + (z-x)^2*(x-y)*(y-z)
sage: P.<x,y,z>=QQ[]
sage: p = (x-y)^2*(y-z)*(z-x) + (y-z)^2*(z-x)*(x-y) + (z-x)^2*(x-y)*(y-z)
sage: p
0
sage: q = (x + 1)^2 - 2*x - 1
sage: q
x^2
sage: r = (x + 1)^2 - x^2 - 2*x - 1
sage: r
0
sage: s = (x + 2)^2 - 2*x - 3
sage: s
x^2 + 2*x + 1
sage: s.factor()
(x + 1)^2

I think the point of checking the boolean value is that if a polynomial is irreducible, then it should be returned unchanged, instead of expanded. However, this doesn't seem to work:

```
sage: ((x + 1)^100 + 2).factor()
x^100 + 100*x^99 + 4950*x^98 + 161700*x^97 + 3921225*x^96 + <lots more terms>
```
It would be better to return `(x + 1)^100 + 2`. If the user wants to expand this expression, they can apply `expand`.
