As reported on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/Ca661TP_3Ug/m/f2lZtUXLAwAJ), sage fails to factor expressions that expand to something very easy, such as `x^2` or `0`. Instead, it returns the original expression.

```
sage: ((x + 1)^2 - 2*x - 1).factor()  # bad (should be x^2)
(x + 1)^2 - 2*x - 1
sage: ((x + 1)^2 - x^2 - 2*x - 1).factor()  # bad (should be 0)
(x + 1)^2 - x^2 - 2*x - 1
sage: ((x + 2)^2 - 2*x - 3).factor()  # good
(x + 1)^2
```

Here is a tentative diagnosis from a quick look at the code. It seems that sagemath expands the expression into a polynomial (a linear combination of powers of `x`) before trying to factor it.  If the expansion has only a single term (a constant times a power of `x`), then nothing needs to be done, since this expansion is already factored.

Maybe a silly question, but I notice that `symbolic.expression.Expression.factor()` says "If you are factoring a polynomial with rational coefficients (and dontfactor is empty) the factorization is done using Singular
instead of Maxima, so the following is very fast instead of dreadfully slow".
I'm just wondering, if it concerns a polynomial, why not using `Polynomial` instead?

```
sage: P
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field
sage: p
0
sage: p = (x-y)^2*(y-z)*(z-x) + (y-z)^2*(z-x)*(x-y) + (z-x)^2*(x-y)*(y-z)
sage: P.<x,y,z>=QQ[]
sage: p = (x-y)^2*(y-z)*(z-x) + (y-z)^2*(z-x)*(x-y) + (z-x)^2*(x-y)*(y-z)
sage: p
0
sage: q = (x + 1)^2 - 2*x - 1
sage: q
x^2
sage: r = (x + 1)^2 - x^2 - 2*x - 1
sage: r
0
sage: s = (x + 2)^2 - 2*x - 3
sage: s
x^2 + 2*x + 1
sage: s.factor()
(x + 1)^2

This works. I spent a while trying to determine if there was a good reason the function to return false if ginac determines that the numerator and denominator are "trivial" (as was morally done before), but I really can't find one.

I note that the boolean result of the changed function is also used in gamma_normalization, but this change seems to work well with that too.

I think the point of checking the boolean value is that if a polynomial is irreducible, then it should be returned unchanged, instead of expanded. However, this doesn't seem to work:

```
sage: ((x + 1)^100 + 2).factor()
x^100 + 100*x^99 + 4950*x^98 + 161700*x^97 + 3921225*x^96 + <lots more terms>
```
It would be better to return `(x + 1)^100 + 2`. If the user wants to expand this expression, they can apply `expand`.
