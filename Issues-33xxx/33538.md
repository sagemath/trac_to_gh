Doctesting this file in is made more robust, and distro friendly by allowing and making `SAGE_DOC` to be a random temporary directory at the start of the doctesting of the file.

To allow `SAGE_DOC` to be set randomly for doctesting we cannot let it be imported globally in the whole file. Functions that uses it need to import it explicitly. 


Depends on #33141
