Doctesting this file in is made more robust, and distro friendly by allowing and making `SAGE_DOC` to be a random temporary directory at the start of the doctesting of the file.

To allow `SAGE_DOC` to be set randomly for doctesting we cannot let it be imported globally in the whole file. Functions that uses it need to import it explicitly.

Having thought about it more, I think it's too fragile to have doctests depend on whether `SAGE_DOC` is defined before the relevant `import` statements. Let's leave the branch as it is — I don't have any better ideas for how to fix this.

Tests pass on Sage built from scratch, and I trust that they fix problems, or at least don't cause any new ones, for distros.
