After #33507, the jupyter kernel `sagemath` gets invoked during the docbuild.
This can lead to a new class of errors as seen in [#33507 comment:75](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/33507#comment:75) and [#33507 comment:86](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/33507#comment:86)

We fix it by setting `JUPYTER_DATA_DIR` and `JUPYTER_PATH` during the docbuild so that a random broken user configuration of Jupyter in `~/.jupyter` does not break the docbuild.

Dima had the same issue with `./sage -n`. So we should not focus on the docbuild.

Well, `sage -n` is for running Jupyter, so I'd think it's correct to use the user's configuration - so it's the user's problem if their personal configuration in `~/.jupyter` is overriding our kernel.

But for the build process we should do better.

I see.

Then it looks good to me. Now I am simulating the failing situation to see that the branch works as expected. 

Meanwhile let me note that #33320 (which supersedes #33507) circumvents this bug since it does not run jupyter to build the live doc.

This

```
export JUPYTER_DATA_DIR=/doesnotexist  
```
worked. But as I see it, this is still not a safe solution. It does prevent from using default directories, but still `.sage/local/etc/jupyter` shadows our kernel. Fortunately that directory does not exist either, in my case. 

A safe solution would be to add the real path to our kernel at the front...

Thus 

```
export JUPYTER_DATA_DIR=???os.path.join(SAGE_VENV, "share", "jupyter")???
```

This is rather cumbersome though...

For the record in sage-on-gentoo where I split sage_setup, sage, sage_docbuild and sage-doc in 9.5 and beyond I patch the makefile for build the documentation. But it also relies on sage to be already installed and in place on the system.

I think we are at a point where ditching `./sage --docbuild` in favor of what I am currently doing in vanilla sage is not only possible but probably inevitable in the short term.
