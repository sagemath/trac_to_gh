After #33507, the jupyter kernel `sagemath` gets invoked during the docbuild.
This can lead to a new class of errors as seen in #33507#comment:75 and #33507#comment:86

We fix it by setting `JUPYTER_DATA_DIR` and `JUPYTER_PATH` during the docbuild so that a random broken user configuration of Jupyter in `~/.jupyter` does not break the docbuild.

See https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/use/jupyter-directories.html#configuration-files

Dima had the same issue with `./sage -n`. So we should not focus on the docbuild.

I see.

Then it looks good to me. Now I am simulating the failing situation to see that the branch works as expected. 

Meanwhile let me note that #33320 (which supersedes #33507) circumvents this bug since it does not run jupyter to build the live doc.

Thus

```

This is rather cumbersome though...

I don't think it's necessary to set it to the location of our jupyter installation because that is always active.

Where would that directory be coming from?

I don't know... I don't have it anymore since I deleted the `.sage` directory for experiments. It didn't have kernel definitions in it, and didn't cause a problem.

For the record in sage-on-gentoo where I split sage_setup, sage, sage_docbuild and sage-doc in 9.5 and beyond I patch the makefile for build the documentation. But it also relies on sage to be already installed and in place on the system.
https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/sci-mathematics/sage-doc/files/sage-doc-9.6-makefile_and_parallel.patch

I think we are at a point where ditching `./sage --docbuild` in favor of what I am currently doing in vanilla sage is not only possible but probably inevitable in the short term.
