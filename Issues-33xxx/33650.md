After #33507, the jupyter kernel `sagemath` gets invoked during the docbuild.
This can lead to a new class of errors as seen in #33507#comment:75 and #33507#comment:86

We fix it by setting `JUPYTER_DATA_DIR` and `JUPYTER_PATH` during the docbuild so that a random broken user configuration of Jupyter in `~/.jupyter` does not break the docbuild.

See https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/use/jupyter-directories.html#configuration-files

I see.

Then it looks good to me. Now I am simulating the failing situation to see that the branch works as expected. 

Meanwhile let me note that #33320 (which supersedes #33507) circumvents this bug since it does not run jupyter to build the live doc.

Thus

export JUPYTER_DATA_DIR=???os.path.join(SAGE_VENV, "share", "jupyter")???
```

This is rather cumbersome though...
