Add VS code launch config that allows running and debugging doctests in an active file. To test (should work on gitpod as well):
- Open some python file
- Go to "Run & Debug" tab by clicking the play symbol with the little bug on it on the very left (or Ctrl + Shift + D)
- Next to the green play button at the top, select "Sage: Test" from the dropdown, then click the play button.

I think this is not easily possible as I have to specify a python script as the "program".

Do you think that's generally helpful? Some of the python files contain quite some tests, so the output may be quite overwhelming.

Everything is already run in the debugger and things like "break on error" can be configured there.

The debug statement doesn't play nicely with vscode debugger (it breaks in the console but not in the vs code debugger).

I can set env variables (using `env`) but don't know how to append things. As #30818 is also making good process I don't thing this is very important.
