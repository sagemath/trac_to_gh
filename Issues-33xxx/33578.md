Add VS code launch config that allows running and debugging doctests in an active file. To test (should work on gitpod as well):
- Open some python file
- Go to "Run & Debug" tab by clicking the play symbol with the little bug on it on the very left (or Ctrl + Shift + D)
- Next to the green play button at the top, select "Sage: Test" from the dropdown, then click the play button.
