Add VS code launch config that allows running and debugging doctests in an active file. To test (should work on gitpod as well):
- Open some python file
- Go to "Run & Debug" tab by clicking the play symbol with the little bug on it on the very left (or Ctrl + Shift + D)
- Next to the green play button at the top, select "Sage: Test" from the dropdown, then click the play button.

Do you think that's generally helpful? Some of the python files contain quite some tests, so the output may be quite overwhelming.

The debug statement doesn't play nicely with vscode debugger (it breaks in the console but not in the vs code debugger).
