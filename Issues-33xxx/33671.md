https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers

We add two new sections in the developer's guide:
https://47f8b984ef964a5aa34147393fbdc32e0dde88ad--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/developer/portability_testing.html#using-our-pre-built-docker-images-published-on-ghcr-io

We also set up devcontainer configurations for the CoCalc and  computop/sage Docker images, as well as downstream distribution packaging of Sage.

- https://github.com/3-manifolds/sagedocker/issues/2

Tested `devcontainer.json` of

- `portability-ubuntu-jammy-standard`: builds well; runs well
- `develop-docker-computop`: builds well; runs well
- `downstream-docker-cocalc`: builds well; runs well (except machines with the issue #32434)
- `downstream-docker-computop`: builds well; runs well 
- `downstream-archlinux-latest`: builds well; runs well
- `downstream-conda-forge-latest`: builds well; runs well


Follow-ups:

- #34363 Installation guide: Document installation on Windows via devcontainer
- #34286 Cookiecutter for Sage user projects with devcontainer
- #34403 GitHub Codespaces - may also be able to test it by starting a codespace at https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=public%2Fbuild%2Fdevcontainer&repo=302607352&machine=standardLinux32gb&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json
- `downstream-*` for more distributions (generate with `tox` from the info in `tox.ini, use `_sagemath` package)
- `develop-conda-forge-src-environment-dev` (https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/conda.html#using-conda-to-provide-all-dependencies-for-the-sage-library-experimental, similar to our gitpod configuration)
- Restore `portability-debian-buster-i386-standard` and fix it
- Restore `develop-docker-cocalc` (was: builds well (after increasing disk image space on the Docker daemon); fails to run)
- Restore - `portability-centos-7-devtoolset-gcc_11-standard` (was: builds well; fails to run (exactly the same on WSL))
- Restore `downstream-docker-sagemath` (after #34242)
- add github workflows that verify that sage is at least compiling in these containers. That should be relatively straightforward using https://github.com/devcontainers/ci
- improve `portability-Dockerfile` as explained in [comment:299](#comment:299)

They are now added to this virtual develop package, which is meant for "useful stuff for developers". But these two packages are needed by vscode and thus should *only* be mentioned in the corresponding dockerfile, and not in the virtual develop package.

I don't want to go back to maintaining separate Dockerfiles for the various distributions.

There is no need for a new package, just put it in a switch/if statement for the different systems in the devcontainer dockerfile.

It's not like these packages are mysterious VS Code-specific requirements. gpg is a typical dev tool that people use for signing commits, and ssh is also what trac users need to push.

Actually, from my use of repology for finding the gpgconf it seems that Debian is the only distro family that has it as a separate package. So one could consider to also package the full gpg in the case of Debian. That's a possible refinement.

Since the idea of the dev container is to provide a container for the development, I think this should be the main and default config. If someone temporarily wants to investigate some issues using one of the other images, then its okay to have an uncommited change dangling around. I would also suggest you open an issue at the vscode repo to support multiple devcontainers.

If you have the remote container extension installed, then its fair to assume you may also want to use it. 

By the way, please remove the extension from the recommended list. I think its to situational to recommend to everyone.

Attachment: **[codespaces.jpg](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket33671/codespaces.jpg)**

It's still not working on github's workspaces (see attached screenshot). The default config (which is used if you use the direct link without manual config) just starts github's default (= almost empty) workspace, and thus is not useful for sage development. Moreover, only a few of the added dev containers are actually appearing in the dropdown menu (maybe some parsing issues?).

Codespaces are now included in the educational program of github, so you might be able to test it yourself.

Moreover, some of the container names are a bit confusing (e.g. `sagemath-sagemath`). Could this be improved? In either case, I would welcome if each one is shortly explained in the docs.

I don't remember. I am testing again with your patch.

As far as I understand from the above message and your comment "`// libgmp.a is broken and leads to a build failure of ecm.`", it seems a genuine problem of the combination of the cocalc image and the devel branch. No? If yes, then should we fix the problem in the `devcontainer.json`? The purpose of the dev container is to reveal such a problem. No?

Yes, this is broken in the CoCalc Docker image. But rebuilding Sage on top of the CoCalc Docker image is not exactly a documented use case of that Docker image, as far as I know. (For that matter, I also don't know if the CoCalc service supports or documents doing Sage development.)

And it just did! So now we don't need it to continue revealing the same problem. Hence the workaround, which allows us to catch other problems that we don't know about yet.

Do we need the middle part `-docker-`? They are all based on docker images. I don't understand what meaning the middle part conveys...

The ones with "docker" in it are pre-made Docker images that include Sage.
The others are Docker images of minimal distribution installations, and we are then testing the downstream package providing Sage.

This distinction should be (and is already, perhaps) explained in the documentation for "cocalc", "computop", and "sagemath", and already conveyed by the fact that "cocalc", "computop", and "sagemath" are not os names. I think "docker" in the name does not explain anything, and redundant. But I would not insist if you decide to keep them.

<div id="comment:188" align="right">comment:188</div>

The handling of multiple devcontainer definition files is discussed in the following issues:
- https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/1165
- https://github.com/devcontainers/spec/issues/6
- https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/3279

Summary: the implementation that Github's codespaces uses is the defacto standard, and vscode is expected to follow suit in the future (however, without a clear timeline).

Thus, in order to be future proof, I would say we should have a default devcontainer file that vscode and github codespaces uses if no other devcontainer is specified. vscode users then have the option to either change that default devcontainer config or use the devcontainer cli (https://github.com/devcontainers/cli). This would also reduce the step necessary for using devcontainers for actual development.

Moreover, I suggest you add github workflows that verify that sage is at least compiling in these containers. That should be relatively straightforward using https://github.com/devcontainers/ci

Do those with "fails to run" fail with you too?

If so, I suggest to create a separate ticket for a branch that contains only those devcontainers.json that "builds well; runs well", and keep this ticket to fix other failing devcontainers.json.

It would also be good to include in the manual how and where to start sage for each dev containers. For example, in `downstream-docker-computop`, it is `/sage/sage`.

This symbolic link is from your computer's file system, I think. I'll add a command to the devcontainer script to remove this confusing symlink.

> [root@d05614ceb461 sage-dev]# /usr/loacl/sage/sage

Overall that location `/usr/local/sage` is not present on archlinux (also there's a typo  loacl -> local)

It should just work by typing `sage` (that's `/usr/bin/sage`), but I'll check again now.

Yes, we should mention how to launch the downstream sage in the documentation

I've just removed them here on the branch. Easy to revert on follow-up tickets that fix it.

It seems that a devcontainer.json might not build if the source tree is in a "dirty state", like just after building another devcontainer.json. It seems `./bootstrap` in the source tree fixes this.

I don't know if this should be documented...

Is this on your Mac? Can you reproduce it with just `docker run -it sagemathinc/cocalc bash` from the command line? 

In the container where Sage crashes, could you run `cat /proc/cpuinfo`?

The problem is that Github codespaces will just use Github's default image (which does not work with sage) if there is no default devcontainer config.

Yes. I could not run it on windows. It takes too long(or hangs?) while it downloads docker image files.

With `root@bd6485e9bc61:/usr/local/sage# ./sage`, I get the same failure.

The main build should happen in the `onCreateCommand` or `updateContentCommand` and not in `postCreateCommand` and definitely not in `postStartCommand` (which is meant for something like starting a dev server). This is a general recommendation, but particular relevant for prebuilds:

  When a prebuild configuration workflow runs, [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) creates a temporary codespace, performing setup operations up to and including any onCreateCommand and updateContentCommand commands in the devcontainer.json file. No postCreateCommand commands are run during the creation of a prebuild. For more information about these commands, see the devcontainer.json reference in the VS Code documentation. A snapshot of the generated container is then taken and stored.

This should also help with the strange behavior when restarting vscode, which shouldn't rebuild but only restart the container.

The new `downstream-docker-cocalc/devcontainer.json` works well.

I cm curious why `updateContentCommand` but not `postCreateCommand` should be used.

error is confusing.  The problem is actually that it conflicts with the `sage` executable in the root. If I delete this file, the container builds successful. But then there are more issues:\n\n```\n./sage\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/workspaces/sagetrac-mirror/src/bin/sage-ipython\", line 9, in <module>\n    from sage.misc.banner import banner\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sage'\n```\nI have to run `make build` manually, although this should be part of the creation cmd, right? According to the log it is run, but doesn't detect any changes. Could it be that the docker container contains the sage code which confuses make/devcontainer?\n\nDon't you have the same issues with vscode locally?\n\nFull creation log:\n\n```\n2022-08-21

```
The "out of space" error is confusing.  The problem is actually that it conflicts with the `sage` executable in the root. If I delete this file, the container builds successful. But then there are more issues:

```
./sage
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/workspaces/sagetrac-mirror/src/bin/sage-ipython", line 9, in <module>
    from sage.misc.banner import banner
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sage'
```
I have to run `make build` manually, although this should be part of the creation cmd, right? According to the log it is run, but doesn't detect any changes. Could it be that the docker container contains the sage code which confuses make/devcontainer?

Don't you have the same issues with vscode locally?

Replying to [@tobiasdiez](#comment:286):
> There is only one portability config as of now.

But we document what users can do - namely make new configs by editing.
The Dockerfile is designed that it does not have to be modified. 
So it would be a bad practice if we have to tell the user to make a copy.

> Its still not completely working:

Tobias, again -- the work on Codespaces should please go to a follow-up ticket. You said you don't have time to work on it. And it's not actionable for us.

The present ticket has a clear scope, has been thoroughly tested and documented.

Sorry Matthias, but the original version of the code was working well with codespaces. I'm happy you further worked on it, but it's not fair that you introduce issues with codespaces and then say "I don't care, lets fix them in a follow up ticket". And this is not for the sake of codespaces, but as I said above microsoft treats the codespaces as the defacto standard; so if its not working there then vscode will likely break in the future as well (and it will not work with other providers, such as devcontainer cli and gitpod).

So what about deleting the portability dockerfile completely, and simply specifying the image in the devcontainer? Since the dockerfile is simply forwarding to the github image anyway, this should suffice and be quicker. Moreover, can we use a different "target" that doesn't include the sage source code?

Finally, the names of the "post" scripts need to be changed and the docs changed to reflect the recent changes of "onCreateCommand" etc.

> So what about deleting the portability dockerfile completely

It's there as preparation for the following improvement (which is waiting for #29536):
- always pull FROM the build stage `-with-system-packages`
- then COPY the Sage SAGE_LOCAL (but not the old Sage source tree) from the requested build stage such as the default `-with-targets`
This creates a smaller version of the container image.
