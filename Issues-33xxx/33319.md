Example:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(2147483659^2)[]
sage: x.resultant(y)
# [...]
TypeError: Singular error:
   ? Wrong or unknown ground field specification
   ? cannot make ring
   ? error occurred in or before STDIN line 14: `ring sage8=(2147483659,z2),(x, y),dp;`
   ? expected ring-expression. type 'help ring;'
```

Reason: `can_convert_to_singular()` only checks that the characteristic is small for *prime* fields, but Singular equally can't handle finite extension fields of large characteristic.

On the other hand, Singular *can* handle arbitrarily large `IntegerModRing`s (including prime finite fields) using the `(integer,modulus)` syntax.

Indeed, they were subtly indicating a missing `)` in one of the Singular commands. :-)


> I am not sure I entirely like moving something from Cython that could be called a lot to a Python function. I understand it would be easier to maintain, but I am not sure it is worth the potential speed tradeoff since this is a fairly important part of Sage. This isn't a strong opinion, but it is something to consider.


I agree, but I couldn't think of any situation where this code would be a performance bottleneck: The biggest part of the time is spent on waiting for the Singular interface anyway, and do users really construct tons of polynomial rings in a tight loop?

Some benchmarking shows that the new branch is indeed a tiny bit slower than before:

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x,y,z', implementation='singular')
sage: %timeit R._singular_init_()
```
...reports ~400µs on this branch, compared to ~390µs before. I don't really think this matters, but if you prefer I can try to move the function back to the cythonized file (ideally while keeping only a single copy).

I am glad it helped.

Ah, I thought it was for polynomials, not the rings. I agree with you fully and you can disregard my comment.

If the bot comes back green, then it is a positive review.

Patchbot is morally green (though I'm not sure what's up with the one failure — it appears to be somewhat consistent, but is probably unrelated to these changes?).

I applied two more small tweaks to hopefully make the patchbot plugins happy too.
