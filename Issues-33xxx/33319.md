Example:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(2147483659^2)[]
sage: x.resultant(y)
# [...]
TypeError: Singular error:
   ? Wrong or unknown ground field specification
   ? cannot make ring
   ? error occurred in or before STDIN line 14: `ring sage8=(2147483659,z2),(x, y),dp;`
   ? expected ring-expression. type 'help ring;'
```

Reason: `can_convert_to_singular()` only checks that the characteristic is small for *prime* fields, but Singular equally can't handle finite extension fields of large characteristic.

On the other hand, Singular *can* handle arbitrarily large `IntegerModRing`s (including prime finite fields) using the `(integer,modulus)` syntax.

I am not sure I entirely like moving something from Cython that could be called a lot to a Python function. I understand it would be easier to maintain, but I am not sure it is worth the potential speed tradeoff since this is a fairly important part of Sage. This isn't a strong opinion, but it is something to consider.

There are a number of doctest failures. Most appear to be trivial, but they might be subtly indicating something. The adding of the fallback warnings might need some justification.

Indeed, they were subtly indicating a missing `)` in one of the Singular commands. :-)


> I am not sure I entirely like moving something from Cython that could be called a lot to a Python function. I understand it would be easier to maintain, but I am not sure it is worth the potential speed tradeoff since this is a fairly important part of Sage. This isn't a strong opinion, but it is something to consider.

I agree, but I couldn't think of any situation where this code would be a performance bottleneck: The biggest part of the time is spent on waiting for the Singular interface anyway, and do users really construct tons of polynomial rings in a tight loop?

Some benchmarking shows that the new branch is indeed a tiny bit slower than before:

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x,y,z', implementation='singular')
sage: %timeit R._singular_init_()
```
...reports ~400µs on this branch, compared to ~390µs before. I don't really think this matters, but if you prefer I can try to move the function back to the cythonized file (ideally while keeping only a single copy).

Patchbot is morally green (though I'm not sure what's up with the one failure — it appears to be somewhat consistent, but is probably unrelated to these changes?).

I applied two more small tweaks to hopefully make the patchbot plugins happy too.
