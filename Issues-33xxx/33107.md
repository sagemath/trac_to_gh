```
sage: A = matrix(QQ,[])
sage: A.cholesky()
...
IndexError: matrix index out of range
```

If we simply return `A` itself in this case, the definition of the decomposition is satisfied.

sage: matrix(QQ, [[1]]).cholesky().is_immutable()
True
```

Usually, `.cholesky()` returns an immutable matrix. Should we do that in the 0Ã—0 case as well, for consistency? For example, the subdivisions could be mutated, otherwise.
