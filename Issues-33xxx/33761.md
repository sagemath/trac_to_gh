For some reason, the `plot` method is not working with the convention. For example:

```
sage: Tableaux.options.convention="english"
sage: SemistandardTableau([[1,2],[2,3]]).pp()
  1  2
  2  3
sage: SemistandardTableau([[1,2],[2,3]]).plot()
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 10 graphics primitives
sage: Tableaux.options.convention="french"
sage: SemistandardTableau([[1,2],[2,3]]).pp()
  2  3
  1  2
sage: SemistandardTableau([[1,2],[2,3]]).plot()
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 10 graphics primitives
```

The pretty print works properly, but if you look at the graphics, both give English notation.
