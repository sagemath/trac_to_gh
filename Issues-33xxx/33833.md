In #33601, the furo theme has been introduced for the documentation. The aim of this ticket is to make it the standard theme. Before it happens, the remaining issues need to be fixed:

- Index page in double columns look awful -- fixed in #34265
- sage logo in the side bar should link to the top of the Sage manuals - fixed in #34252
- no link to the doc root - fixed in #34267
- search page not working - fixed in #34252
- "ERROR: Adding a table of contents in Furo-based documentation is unnecessary" - https://73e5aa3fbbec2d751a47064c14479fc0d55c3de9--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/installation/source.html#installation-in-a-multiuser-environment - fixed in #34262

To support this ticket, the standard Furo package was accepted by the voting done in

- https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/VTU_I-ecPlA

along with subsidiary votings in 

- https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/eRh16v5Mz0c
- https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/rhPECxe128o

Other possible improvements:

- Install sphinx-hoverxref, sphinx-notfound-page (see setuptools documentation, which also uses furo - https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/history.html#documentation-changes)

Would you pinpoint to a precise place from the documentation (following the Build Documentation badge)? I could not find one.

I think we should tweak Furo's styles only if the styling is an obvious defect (meaning "look bad to anyone") and is specifically about Sage. If the defect is a general one, the change request should go to the furo project itself.

there's ample space around `EXAMPLES:` but the lines `rational_maps()` and `Return ...` are stuck together.

The official Furo examples look the same. I'm surprised noone else seems to find the spacing offensive.

Anyway, it's nitpicking, and indeed not our problem.

I see. The space between "EXAMPLES:" and "sage: ..." is the sum of the space around "EXAMPLES" and the space (margin + border) around "sage: ...". The reason that we see the added sum of the space seems that the background of "sage: ..." is hard to tell from the page background because of similarity of colors. It seems worse in dark mode than in light mode.

If I increase of the contrast between the backgrounds slightly, then it shows

Is this better?

> Anyway, it's nitpicking, and indeed not our problem.


As we have lots of example code, we may regard this as our problem.

Could you please upload pictures as attachments to the ticket, rather than linking to imgur (which shows a lot of ugly spam if you click on the image)?

Once you attached `jJR0poB.png` (there is a tab for this near the top part of the ticket page), you can do `![](jJR0poB.png)`, to the same effect of displaying the image inline.
