This is only a tiny contribution to the review, since i did not check the code. Here are some typos:

- "Sierpiński" : the accent is over the `n`, not the `s`
- "pervertex"

Also, the motivation for such a construction seems to be geometrical. So, if the vertices of a graph have planar positions, then so should its generalized Sierpiński image. For example, with the house graph of the poster:

```
graphs.HouseGraph().plot()
```

but

```
graphs.GeneralizedSierpinskiGraph(graphs.HouseGraph(),2).plot()
```

Oh, it seems that the trac text editor and the gitweb moved the accent, see https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/diff?id2=5fb2a6ea44400e469caee82748cf863ca0c5f724&id=30623b43ac501d96a5899c7f01ebd76c30a234b9 (8 occurrences).
