Which parameters have you used ? It's impossible for me to guess from your message.

Have you read and followed the description of the method ?

Can you clarify what you expect ?


The code in this ticket strictly follows the definition given in the paper by Gravier, Kovse and Parreau, and we can get all the examples given in the papers about generalized Sierpinski graphs. For your parameters, we get:

```
sage: G = GeneralizedSierpinskiGraph(graphs.CompleteGraph(4), 2)
sage: print(G.vertices())
[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]
sage: print(G.edges(labels=False))
[((0, 0), (0, 1)), ((0, 0), (0, 2)), ((0, 0), (0, 3)), ((0, 1), (0, 2)), ((0, 1), (0, 3)), ((0, 1), (1, 0)), ((0, 2), (0, 3)), ((0, 2), (2, 0)), ((0, 3), (3, 0)), ((1, 0), (1, 1)), ((1, 0), (1, 2)), ((1, 0), (1, 3)), ((1, 1), (1, 2)), ((1, 1), (1, 3)), ((1, 2), (1, 3)), ((1, 2), (2, 1)), ((1, 3), (3, 1)), ((2, 0), (2, 1)), ((2, 0), (2, 2)), ((2, 0), (2, 3)), ((2, 1), (2, 2)), ((2, 1), (2, 3)), ((2, 2), (2, 3)), ((2, 3), (3, 2)), ((3, 0), (3, 1)), ((3, 0), (3, 2)), ((3, 0), (3, 3)), ((3, 1), (3, 2)), ((3, 1), (3, 3)), ((3, 2), (3, 3))]

This is only a tiny contribution to the review, since i did not check the code. Here are some typos:

- "Sierpiński" : the accent is over the `n`, not the `s`
- "pervertex"

Also, the motivation for such a construction seems to be geometrical. So, if the vertices of a graph have planar positions, then so should its generalized Sierpiński image. For example, with the house graph of the poster:

```
graphs.HouseGraph().plot()
```

but

```
graphs.GeneralizedSierpinskiGraph(graphs.HouseGraph(),2).plot()
```

Oh, it seems that the trac text editor and the gitweb moved the accent, see https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/compare/5fb2a6ea44400e469caee82748cf863ca0c5f724...30623b43ac501d96a5899c7f01ebd76c30a234b9 (8 occurrences).

If you have a graph of depth 3, any vertex comes from 3 vertices (i,j,k), one for each depth. You can set the position of that vertex to `pos(i) + K*pos(j) + K^2*pos(k)` where K > 1 is some stretching factor, that could be set by the user or its default value could be computed as, say, twice the geometrical diameter of the graph.
