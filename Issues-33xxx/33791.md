We refactor `ci-cygwin-standard.yml` using the new reusable workflow `cygwin.yml` (see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows for this new GH Actions feature). 

We also remove `ci-cygwin-minimal.yml`; this configuration has not run successfully for a long time, and there is no expectation that it will be fixed.

The workflow includes optional steps that are useful for upstream CIs. First uses:
