sage: R.<X, Y, Z> = QQ[]
sage: I = R.ideal([X^2*Y^3, X*Z])
sage: I.hilbert_polynomial()
-t - 5
```
The Hilbert polynomial, by definition, has to take non-negative integer values at all sufficiently large integers t, so this computation can't possibly be right. The correct answer is ` t + 5 `, which is what one gets with the ` algorithm='singular' ` option.

Inspecting the code, it looks like the denominator of the Hilbert series is getting normalised wrongly in some cases.

Sorry for hijacking this ticket. I made a few modifications to the patch so that

(1) we do not assume `denom[0]` can be only `-1`.

(2) the code is a bit more efficient.

Before your patch

```
sage: R.<X, Y, Z> = QQ[]
sage: I = R.ideal([X^2*Y^3, X*Z])
sage: I.hilbert_polynomial() 
sage: I.hilbert_polynomial()
-t - 5
sage: timeit('I.hilbert_polynomial()')
625 loops, best of 3: 409 μs per loop
sage: timeit('I.hilbert_polynomial()')
625 loops, best of 3: 416 μs per loop
```
After your patch

```
sage: R.<X, Y, Z> = QQ[]
sage: I = R.ideal([X^2*Y^3, X*Z])
sage: I.hilbert_polynomial()
t + 5
sage: timeit('I.hilbert_polynomial()')
625 loops, best of 3: 299 μs per loop
sage: timeit('I.hilbert_polynomial()')
625 loops, best of 3: 298 μs per loop
```
After my modifications

```
sage: R.<X, Y, Z> = QQ[]
sage: I = R.ideal([X^2*Y^3, X*Z])
sage: I.hilbert_polynomial()
t + 5
sage: timeit('I.hilbert_polynomial()')
625 loops, best of 3: 230 μs per loop
sage: timeit('I.hilbert_polynomial()')
625 loops, best of 3: 235 μs per loop
```

I am positive to the patch.
