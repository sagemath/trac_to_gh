(from #29536)

This is like `_recommended` (from #29557), but for development tools.

Define a script package representing "useful stuff for Sage developers to have on a Docker image":

- include the stuff added in #33740 to `environment-dev.yml`
- include what is needed on VS Code devcontainers - #33671

We also use this package to define packages that would appear as "packages that developers should install" in 
https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#linux-recommended-installation; 
the new version from this ticket can be seen in https://c96c7c5813bd70d7b2d8d51135d57cc6acba18ad--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/installation/source.html#system-specific-requirements

We also simplify the `bootstrap-conda` script and make it a bit faster.

The environment files are only one way that this information is provided to the user. Other ways are through the command-lines shown at the end of `./configure`, and in the formatted documentation https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/spkg/index.html

That's why it is better to separate the data from the code that processes data.
