The documentation of `power_mod()` in `sage/arith/misc.py` currently says:

    Return the `n`-th power of `a` modulo the integer `m`.

But the function actually works in any ring where `%` is defined! Let's change the documentation to reflect this.

Also, some code tweaks while we're at it.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Please fix the following:

```diff
     if not n:
-        if not a:
-            raise ArithmeticError("0^0 is undefined.")
         return a.parent().one()
```

See the many previous zero-to-the-zero tickets:

- https://trac.sagemath.org/query?order=id&desc=1&summary=~0%5E0

Therefore,

- `power_mod(0, 0, 5)` should return `1`, not raise an error

I also think

- `a % 0` should return `a`, not raise an error

but maybe that belongs in a separate ticket.

<a id='comment:8'></a>There is one last instance of raising an error for `0^0`.

It is in `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_template.pxi`.

Do you know how to deal with it?
Or maybe that is also for a separate ticket.
