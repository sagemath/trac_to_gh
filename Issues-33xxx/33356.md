This seems like a new problem I have not seen before. If already known or reported, please delete this ticket.

fyi, I also asked about it here

https://ask.sagemath.org/question/61120/latex-command-makes-sage-95-coredump-any-workaround/ 

This seems to happen on some output and so far see it happen when trying to convert maxima output to Latex on some results. But could also when using other algorithms. I need to check more. Here is an example


```

Doing the same, but using "fricas" instead of "maxima" shows no issues and the latex is generated with no problem. This is on Arch Linux running inside Virtual box.

It doesn't work for me on OS X, either. I see:

```
sage: s = latex(anti)

and then it hangs. If I hit ctrl-C to interrupt it, it kicks me out to the shell, not to the Sage prompt. This is with Sage 9.6.beta1.

I'm guessing that's it's a giac bug, trying to convert a symbolic expression to LaTeX.

Testing on Ubuntu 20.04 (`CoCalc`) reproduces the bug on 9.4, but not on 9.3.  With 9.3, it takes about 15 seconds to produce the latex.  On 9.4, it usually crashed, but once it ran for more than 5 minutes until I stopped it, with memory usage over 4GB.

Here's what I think is happening. If you look at `anti`, you will see it is an expression that contains an unevaluated integral, and this integral is *much* worse than the one we started with. Calling `latex(anti)` means "evaluate/simplify `anti`, and then return latex code of the result". So `sagemath` tries to evaluate the integral. In 9.3 (and earlier), `sagemath` realizes this is hopeless, and produces latex that includes an unevaluated integral.  In 9.4 (and later), `giac` (or some other backend) does not give up, so keeps trying to evaluate the integral until it runs out of memory.

To more-or-less confirm this diagnosis, I asked `sagemath` to evaluate the unevaluated integral.  In 9.3, it returns after about 15 seconds, with essentially the same integral that we started with.  In 9.4, it hangs or crashes.

I don't know what we should do to fix this.

Yes, this is a problem if latex() command tries to evaluate the math it is trying to convert to Latex. In this case I will modify my code to avoid calling latex() on result which contains integrate in it to bypass this problem.

But does not sagemath has a way to prevent evaluation?  For example, in Mathematica one can do the following


```
TeXForm[HoldForm[Integrate[Sin[x], x]]]

   \int \sin (x) \, dx
```

The command `HoldForm` tells it not to evaluate what is inside.  Without this, it will evaluate first. 


```
TeXForm[Integrate[Sin[x], x]]

    -\cos (x)

```

To prevent evaluation of an integral, use the keyword argument `hold=True`:

```
sage: integral(sin(x), x)
-cos(x)
sage: integral(sin(x), x, hold=True)
integrate(sin(x), x)
sage: latex(integral(sin(x), x, hold=True))
\int \sin\left(x\right)\,{d x}
```

It should also be possible to use a `hold context`, but that doesn't seem to work for the complicated integral, though I don't know why.

There should be a way to tell sage not to evaluate any expression regardless what it is. 

Similar to Mathematica's `Hold` commands.   But for now, I will bypass calling `latex()` in sage on any result that contains `integrate` in it.  This is much easier solution for me at this moment.
