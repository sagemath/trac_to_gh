Currently, calling `residue_field()` on a prime ideal can be very slow in number fields of large degree:

```
sage: K.<a> = QQ.extension(x^301 - 3)
sage: p = K.prime_above(2)
sage: %time p.residue_field()
CPU times: user 1min 5s, sys: 5.5 ms, total: 1min 5s
Wall time: 50.5 s
Residue field of Fractional ideal (2, a - 1)
```

However, the residue field can be computed quickly by other methods:

```
sage: %time v = K.valuation(p)
CPU times: user 186 ms, sys: 5.96 ms, total: 192 ms
Wall time: 211 ms
sage: %time v.residue_field()
CPU times: user 699 µs, sys: 3 µs, total: 702 µs
Wall time: 708 µs
Finite Field of size 2
```

We should try to expose these methods, e.g., by exposing them through an `algorithm` keyword.

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
Note that setting

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^301 - 3, maximize_at_primes=[2])
```

does not make a difference here.
