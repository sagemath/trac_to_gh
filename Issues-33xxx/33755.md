I see

```
Run brew install tox
==> Downloading https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/core/six/manifests/1.16.0_2-1
curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 503 
Error: tox: Failed to download resource "six_bottle_manifest"
Download failed: https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/core/six/manifests/1.16.0_2-1
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

Trying to open this URL in browser gives

```
{"errors":[{"code":"UNAUTHORIZED","message":"authentication required"}]}
```

By the way, there is also something wrong with "Build and Test" in the badge in the ticket description.
