CC:  @antonio-rojas @dimpase

From #33135.

- `src/sage/env.py` uses `distutils.sysconfig.get_python_inc()` which is deprecated, it has no replacement in sysconfig.

 Suggestion from fbissey: "we could use sysconfig.get_config_var('INCLUDEPY') which should give the same value." #33135#comment:7

We also remove the use of `SAGE_LIB` in preparation of namespace packages.

This is the last use of `distutils` in the Sage library, except for uses in `src/sage/features/__init__.py` and `src/sage/misc/cython.py`, which are merely fallbacks when `setuptools` is not present.

 Comment from arojas: "I don't see any code in sagelib or cython that would emit this. Is this still needed at all?"

Follow-up: Once these uses of distutils are removed, their modules can be removed from the regex in the call to filterwarnings introduced by #33135.

Part of 
- Meta-ticket #31295: Replace imports from deprecated `distutils`
- Meta-ticket #33037: Remove use of `SAGE_LIB` and `SAGE_EXTCODE` variables

Toi, tu vas encore te faire taper sur les doigts parce que tu parle Français sur un système où l'Anglais est la "lingua Franca" (je sais, c'est bizarre d'écrire ça).

Otherwise, I am not too fussed about removing that block. I cannot see a test showing what it is supposed to catch and how. Antonio says it is a dead code path and there is clearly no proof otherwise anywhere.

Nevertheless, I have put `sysconfig.get_config_var('INCLUDEPY')` back in: `sage.misc.cython.cython` appends some directories to the result of `sage_include_directories()`, so let's not provoke some subtle changes in the order of looking up libraries when users use the runtime Cython.
