`sage -t --optional='sage,!FEATURE'` will disable autodetection of `FEATURE`.

Useful for checking sequences of `# optional - FEATURE` annotations in particular when `FEATURE` is standard in Sage, for example `sage.misc.cython` (#33029):

```
./sage -t --optional='sage,!sage.misc.cython' src/sage/misc/inherit_comparison.pyx  
```


Also, `sage -t --optional='sage,optional,!FEATURE'` will remove it from the list of optional features supplied by the package list and disable auto-detection. 

For example, when the optional SPKG `bliss` is installed, `--optional='sage,optional'` would expand to a list including `bliss`. By using `--optional='sage,optional,!bliss'`, it can be removed.

It worked for years until you added runtime detection that overrides it. Now you want to add a third layer of complexity without fixing the previous two.

I posted one possible solution recently on the mailing list and another ticket. Another (inevitable, eventually) option is to add a `./configure` script to whatever modularized component of sage requires bliss, and to copy `AC_ARG_ENABLE([bliss])` there. Then the "feature" that detects it from the other components becomes simply e.g. `import sage.whatever.BLISS`. There is already precedent for having setup.py run `sh ./configure` to keep that component pip-installable.

Sage has never had a mechanism to disable the use of optional features by the Sage library. 

The only thing that has changed is what the doctester tests. The present ticket gives you the tool that you need if you have problems with an optional package in your distribution packaging.

Conditionalizing tests on the presence of features is a key idea of the modularization, and we'll make it work with pytest too. Skipping tests based on predicates is a standard feature of all test frameworks. 

#33546 implements the Sage doctest discovery in pytest. It continues to use code from `sage.doctest`, so I see no issue in making `# optional` annotations work, but I don't know the details.

I think it's a good idea to have a negation possibility here. Maybe the following needs a clarification in the help-string:

In a positive list of features you don't need to type `'` and maybe a lot of people use it in this way. But if you want to exclude a feature using this new functionality you must type them or use `\!` instead of `!`. 


BTW: If you have installed some optional feature `xyz` on your system and forgot a `# optional - xyz` or `xyz.is_present()` somewhere in your change of code then this new doctest option will not bring this to your attention. That was what I hoped when I've first seen this ticket. Do you know, how this can be achieved without uninstalling the package?


Further: I really don't know the intention of the log-message `Features detected for doctesting`. My observation is that this messages shows nothing even though optional tests were performed. At least this is irritating. Example:


```
Using --optional=!database_knotinfo,sage

Doctesting 1 file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 5.6 seconds
    cpu time: 5.5 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 5.5 seconds
Features detected for doctesting:
```

Together with 30 optional doctests, the log-message shows the same result:

```
Using --optional=database_knotinfo,sage
Features to be detected: 4ti2,benzene,bliss,buckygen,conway_polynomials,csdp,database_cremona_ellcurve,database_cremona_mini_ellcurve,database_jones_numfield,database_knotinfo,dvipng,gfan,graphviz,imagemagick,jupymake,kenzo,latte_int,lrslib,mcqd,meataxe,msolve,nauty,palp,pandoc,pdf2svg,pdftocairo,phitigra,plantri,polytopes_db,polytopes_db_4d,pynormaliz,python_igraph,rubiks,sage.combinat,sage.geometry.polyhedron,sage.graphs,sage.groups,sage.plot,sage.rings.number_field,sage.rings.padics,sage.rings.real_double,sage.symbolic,sage_numerical_backends_coin,sagemath_doc_html,sphinx,tdlib
Doctesting 1 file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 8.1 seconds
    cpu time: 7.9 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 7.9 seconds
Features detected for doctesting:
```

This seems to be due to:

```sage
sage: from sage.doctest.external import AvailableSoftware
sage: S = AvailableSoftware()
sage: S._indices['database_knotinfo']
10
sage: S._seen[10]
0
```

But this can be changed by performing a `__contains__` test:

```sage
sage: 'database_knotinfo' in S
True
sage: S._seen[10]
1
```

So it looks as if such a test is missing somewhere.

The line `Features detected for doctesting:` only reports the dynamically detected features, a subset of what is listed as `Features to be detected:`.
The statically known ones (from `--optional`) are not reported there.

This works as designed, but if you have a suggestion how it should be changed, we can change it.

The doctests marked `# optional - xyz` *are* disabled using `--optional="!xyz"` -- as your test above with `--optional=!database_knotinfo,sage` verified.

There is no mechanism to disable the actual feature in the Sage runtime. What `xyz.is_present()` does is not affected by the present ticket.

Perhaps I have in mind a new option `sage -t --hide=FEATURES` which would imply `--optional='!FEATURE1,!FEATURE2,..'`. Is there something against having such an additional option? I think that could be realized via a boolean `_hidden` in class `Feature`, which default is `False` and would be switched to `True` in case of this option.

Sorry for using undefined terminology. 

When you use `sage -t --optional=sage,FEATURE`, then FEATURE is "statically known".

When you use `sage -t --optional=sage,optional` and SPKG is the name of a normal package that is installed, then SPKG is "statically known".

Other features, by default those enumerated by `sage.features.all.all_features` except for those enumerated by `sage.doctest.external.external_software`, are subject to detection the first time that their name appears as an `# optional - FEATURE` annotation. (This is done by `sage.doctest.parsing.SageDocTestParser`.)

Yes, I think something like this could make sense if there's a strong enough use case for it. It would probably be best to provide this mechanism also for non-doctest situations. So this would be a separate ticket. 

Thanks for reviewing!

The use case I'm thinking of is the following: If you have installed an optional package `xyz` and run a test on your changes, say

```
sage -t src/sage/....py
```

then it might happen that you get `All tests passed!` here. But after

```
make xyz-clean
```

the same invocation of `sage -t` could find failures. Probably we will get more situations like that as modularization goes ahead. Surely, the patchbots will detect these. But it will be more convenient if you can detect these failures easily on your own system. I don't know how difficult it would be to fake the absence of an optional package in general. But in all cases where the `Features` functionality is used consequently, it should be doable.

Of course! After my vacation (that is in a couple of weeks) I will try to figure out how this could be done.
