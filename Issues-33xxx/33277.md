From #32956#comment:7

`src/doc/bootstrap` currently hardcodes the "recommended" packages.

We replace this by using the new file `build/pkgs/_recommended/dependencies`

The new file can then also be used for provisioning system packages for the new `recommended` factor (added in #33222).

We also add `git` as a recommended package.
