```

This bug was introduced by the fix for #31340.

Analysis:
- the way `global_dummy_Integer` is created (as the result of 1-1) results on `_mp_alloc = 2`.
- the second branch of `fast_tp_new()` creates a new Integer for the pool in the following way:
  1. allocate space for the python object `new` using `PyObject_Malloc`.
  2. copy `global_dummy_Integer` to the newly allocated Integer `new`.
  3. allocate one limb for `_mp_d` using `check_malloc()`, since these cannot be shared.
- At this point the newly created Integer has `_mp_alloc = 2` but only 1 limb allocated in `_mp_d` -- the second limb contains a canary which shouldn't be modified.
- `mpz_fac_ui` for the value 27 uses both limbs, destroying the canary; later it needs to `realloc(_mp_d)` to 3 limbs causing the segfault.

Note that the bug doesn't seem to manifest itself in glibc or musl 1.1, probably because their allocators don't use canaries and they never allocate less than 16 bytes even if one requests only 8 bytes (1 limb).

Possible solutions:

1. in `fast_tp_new()` allocate `_mp_alloc` limbs rather than just one.
 
2. create `global_dummy_Integer` in a way such that `_mp_alloc = 1`. Add an assert so we know when this assumption is broken.

3. revert #31340 so that `global_dummy_Integer` is allocated with `_mp_alloc = 0`, add an assert so we know when this assumption is broken, and *do not* allocate anything in `fast_tp_new()`

The first solution seems more robust but there's a penalty to be paid because it will need to dereference `global_dummy_Integer.value._mp_alloc` and multiply by that (even though we know it is a fixed constant)

The second and third solutions are similar, but I like 3 better because it avoids an early allocation (maybe the integer will stay as 0 and this allocation will never be needed; maybe we are working with larger integers so we avoid to malloc 1 limb just to realloc to more limbs next).

Note the third solution will *not* work with mpir, but I guess that's ok since mpir is no longer supported.

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

From the commit message:

```
    Reallocate the global dummy Integer to one limb.
    
    This is a better fix for #31340 (memory leak when the global dummy
    Integer is not allocated) and it fixes #33081 (segfault when global
    dummy Integer has more than one limb allocated, detected by malloc
    canaries in musl libc 1.2.2)
    
    Also add a function _check_global_dummy_Integer() whose only purpose is
    to doctest that the global dummy Integer satisfies all the assumptions.
```

I went with solution 2 which is doing precisely what sagemath has been doing for ages (before gmp lazy init).

However, I still think it may be worth doing 3 to avoid allocating memory for 0 which is a very common number. This is tricky to benchmark since the integer pool hides the allocation overhead so one has to disable the pool (just change the value of `integer_pool_size` from 100 to 0).

With the pool disabled, a tight loop allocating 100k integers is 3 times faster with lazy allocation (1.5ns vs 5ns) but I don't know a real life example where this makes a difference so I'll leave it as is.

Note void linux currently uses musl 1.1.24, which doesn't have malloc canaries afaik. I do regularly test sagemath on void musl 1.1.24. See https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/34030 for CI, last time it run 9.5.beta8 and it passes with some patches, e.g. #33047. I'll update to beta9 soon.

It should be possible to have a docker image for void linux running musl 1.2.2 if that's useful. In fact upgrading musl to 1.2.2 shouldn't be a problem on 64 bit (the issue with musl 1.2 is that time_t changed on 32 bit archs so the world needs to be recompiled to upgrade)

Alpine has musl 1.2.2.

Maybe it's possible to use some malloc with canaries and/or other checks even on glibc so memory allocation issues like this one would be catched early.

We have void in `tox.ini`, so it would only need to be added to the GH Actions platforms.

For alpine, I have opened #33083.
