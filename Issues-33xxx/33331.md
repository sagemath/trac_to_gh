- Make sure conda installs only python packages that are satisfying the version constraints specified in `install_requires`. Notably, ptyprocess, iniconfig, sphinx, pytest, rpy2 are currently reinstalled by pip. Also add `--no-dependencies` to `pip install` in the conda ci workflow.

Conda is installing rpy2 v3.4.5, while sagelib install requires specify <3.4,>=3.3. Thus pip will download an older version. I think it should be enough to specify the same upper constraint (for the few python packages that have one) in the distros/conda.txt.

I noticed it downgrades the openssl version from 3.0.0 to 1.1.1l.
Can that be fixed?

Oops, I had not used that branch.
Using it, only `openssl` gets downgraded,

- whether using `src/environment.yml`
- or using  `src/environment-optional.yml`

This is on macOS 11.6.5 Big Sur.
