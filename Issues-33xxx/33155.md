As reported in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/gTNMEVbzb6M/m/2lXjD6tFAgAJ:

Installation of pplpy fails:

```
ERROR: pplpy-0.8.6-cp39-cp39-macosx_11_0_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform." 
```
(`wheel` uses this tag based on the inspection of the deployment targets of the built dynamic libraries - this is done in https://github.com/pypa/wheel/blob/main/src/wheel/macosx_libfile.py)

The wheel tagged such then does not pass the compatibility test because of:
https://github.com/pypa/packaging/issues/497


Ingredients of this bug:
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/platform.html#macos-platform
- https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/main/src/pip/_vendor/packaging/tags.py (vendored version of `packaging`)
