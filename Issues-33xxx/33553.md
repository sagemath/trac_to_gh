In the current README (https://gitlab.com/sagemath/sage/-/blob/develop/README.md), in the `Instructions to Build from Source` section, it says at step 3 to:

```
3. [Git] If you cloned the Sage repository using git, bootstrap the
source tree using:

$ make configure
```

On a bare debian linux version, the above fails becaue of the absence of `m4`.

The installation of `m4` is suggested only at step 5:

```
5. [Linux, Cygwin] Install the required minimal build prerequisites.


Compilers: gcc, gfortran, g++ (a recent enough matching
set of these three will avoid building Sage-specific compilers).
See the Installation Manual for a discussion of suitable compilers.


Build tools: GNU make, GNU m4, perl (including
ExtUtils::MakeMaker), ranlib, git, tar, bc.


Python 3.4 or later, or Python 2.7, a full installation including
urllib; but ideally version 3.7.x, 3.8.x, or 3.9.x, which will
avoid having to build Sage's own copy of Python 3.
```
