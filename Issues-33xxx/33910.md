as reported on sage-devel: https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/dhfHU_kZb6o/m/5-8m1v9hAQAJ

To reproduce (on Linux); after the Sage build is done, run

```
make jupyterlab_widgets
make build
```
and observe that `make build` triggers recompilation of `sagelib`.
(this is with #31017)

Without #31017, already the 1st `make` call leads to recompilation of `sagelib`.

From the viewpoint of our Makefile, the package `sagelib` is always rebuilt (this is done by the entry `FORCE` in `build/pkgs/sagelib/dependencies`).

I am guessing what is being reported here is that all or many extension modules of sagelib are getting recompiled (but not re-Cythonized). Correct?

perhaps. I'm struggling to reproduce this without `make distclean`, but clearly a lot is being rebuild, hundreds of files in `sagelib`. This seems to be unnecessary, in this case for sure.
