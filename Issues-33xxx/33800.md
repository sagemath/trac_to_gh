We rename the GH Actions workflow `sdist.yml` to `dist.yml` and add wheel-building for the distributions **sagemath-objects** and **sagemath-categories** for macOS (Intel) and Linux (x86_64, i686) using **cibuildwheel**.

The necessary libraries are built using the Sage distribution.

Example run: https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/2522295930

Follow-ups:
- After #33812 (Refactor distributions **sagemath-{objects,categories}**), make the built wheel for sagemath-objects available for the wheel building of sagemath-categories
- Possibly use `--prefix=$(pwd)/wheelhouse/local-ARCH --with-sage-venv` so that `SAGE_LOCAL` gets copied in/out of the container
