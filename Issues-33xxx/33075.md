```
We add constant field extensions of function fields, which can compute conorms of places and divisors.

Along the way, we 

(1) add `is_effective`, `numerator`, `denominator` methods to divisors;

(2) fix some methods to return Integer values rather than `int`;

(3) fix minor inconveniences.

Extension of function fields. Yes, of course.

> Perhaps we can simplify the implementation by not having this extension class (which otherwise just differs by the base ring, correct?), but instead having the `conorm_*` take an extra argument for a subfield of the base field. 


`conorm_*` methods use the data `self._embedF` that is computed in the initialization method. If we do not have this extension class `ConstantFieldExtension`, then `conorm_*` methods will take more time to compute the return value. This is inefficient because they are supposed to be invoked many times for a fixed extension (in the code for Jacobians of function fields I am developing).

> This would mean less work to get this data, and we wouldn't have to find a name for a field extension by the field of constants (constant field extension is also awkward to me as a non-expert in this area).


The name "constant field extension" is standard in the theory of function fields. And there are other "* extensions" like "Artin-Shreier", "Kummer", ..., which could be implemented in future in the same module `function_fields.extensions`.
