[OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization) is fast and portable software for combinatorial optimization, developed at Google in C++, that can be used from C++, Python, C#, or Java.

Instruction to install OR-Tools for Python:

- https://developers.google.com/optimization/install#python
- https://developers.google.com/optimization/install/python/source_linux

Relevant third-party instructions:
- https://developers.google.com/optimization/install/python/source_mac#scip
- https://developers.google.com/optimization/install/python/source_linux#gurobi
- https://developers.google.com/optimization/install/python/source_linux (instead of editing the Makefile as indicated, we should check whether it is enough to set this as environment variables)





`or-tools` has a [linear_solver](https://github.com/google/or-tools/tree/stable/ortools/linear_solver) wrapper, supporting CLP, CBC, GLPK, Gurobi, SCIP, XPRESS. 
- [Issue to add HiGHS solver](https://github.com/google/or-tools/issues/3116)

If a more detailed simplex interface was added, we could replace the Sage-specific interfaces [sage.numerical.backends.glpk](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/numerical/backends/glpk_backend.pyx) etc. with a general or-tools backend.
- [linear_solver: Add methods getBInvARow, getBInvRow, getBInvACol, getBInvCol](https://github.com/google/or-tools/issues/3205) (closed as "wontfix")

Depends on #31098
