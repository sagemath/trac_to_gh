Our build displays several warnings like

> warning: sage/libs/ntl/ntl_ZZ.pyx:274:23: local variable 'ans' referenced before assignment


for variables that are passed by reference to a C function that overwrites them (meaning that there is no real bug). Here we fix a few easy ones by initializing the variable.

I think so. The first time it's used (*if* it's used) is when it's passed by reference to,

```python
Z_pX_min_val_coeff(minval, mini, self.x, pZZ.x)
```

According to `ntlwrap_impl.h`, that function overwrites both `minval` and `mini`. I've updated that one commit and rebased it onto 9.6-beta2.
