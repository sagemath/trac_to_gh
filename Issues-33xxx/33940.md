<a id='comment:12'></a>This is an improvement, though the conversion remains very fragile.

One thing I don't like is that the conversion  is based purely on the textual representation of the Maple expression and does not differentiate between global and local Maple symbols. For example, `maple("(proc() local zeta; return zeta; end)()(2)").sage()` yields π²/6 although the Maple `zeta` we are converting is not the one bound to the zeta function. I do understand that fixing this is beyond the scope of this ticket, but I also believe that we should make the interface more robust before trying to extend it too much.

Can you explain why you needed to do this

```
         BuiltinFunction.__init__(self, 'hurwitz_zeta', nargs=2,
                                  conversions=dict(mathematica='HurwitzZeta',
-                                                  maple='Zeta',
+                                                  # maple='Zeta', conflict with zeta here
                                                   sympy='zeta'),
                                  latex_name=r'\zeta')

```
?

Yes, I agree.

Maple actually has a C API that would make it easier to have a robust interface. But yes, that would require a bit of work, and it is not clear to me if we can use it without having Maple as a build-time dependency for the corresponding binary modules.
