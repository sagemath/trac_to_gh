Configure mathjax in sphinx config, and not in a javascript file. In this way, we can get ride of the custom theme option `mathjax_macros`, which is not understood by other themes. This is preparation to support the furo theme, see #33601.

We also upgrade Mathjax to v3. The configs were migrated using 
 https://mathjax.github.io/MathJax-demos-web/convert-configuration/convert-configuration.html
with the following manual changes:
- Remove processEscapes since this now defaults to true in v3 anyway.
- Remove ignoreHtmlClass/processHtmlClass since they are set to the default values.
- Remove noerrors extension, which hides error messages. Normally, there shouldn't be any errors and, if there are, its probably good to have them displayed very prominently so that reviewers can discover these issues. But I don't feel very strongly about this change. Reference: https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/extensions/noerrors.html

One of the "references within" is #25833 for the upgrade to 3.x. 
It would be important to know whether [#25833 comment:9](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/25833#comment:9) is still current, and whether it is relevant for our use of Sphinx.

That feature (not compatible with latex) of mathjax2 would be relevant only in online use of mathjax, such as in jupyter notebook. 

As far as I know, that "automatic line breaking" is not used in our documentation. If there is any, then that is something to be fixed.

For us, there is no reason not to upgrade to mathjax3.

You converted single quotes to double quotes. Single quotes are conventionally used for strings containing code (not plain English). You should not change them without compelling reasons.

I must say it's not a rule. But single quotes are commonly used for code strings.

Leaving single-quoted strings as they are will contribute overall homogeneity of the sage code base.

Sadly there is not much of a homogeneity. For example, latex-macros.py contains

```python
    args = "("
    for x in sample_args:
        count += 1
        args += str(x) + ','
    args += ')'
```

Anyway, I've reverted these changes.

My commit contains minor edits. I removed the comment to 'sphinx.ext.mathjax', which seems unnecessary only cluttering code.

Otherwise all looks good to me. But as Matthias points out, this ticket needs to ship MathJax3 for offline users.

I noticed a glitch in `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/index.html`:

A question: 

mathjax2 config `theme_mathjax_macros` is missing in the new mathjax3 config. Is this never used in sage documentation?

Isn't the pdf enough for offline documentation? And if you really need the html docs offline, you can also save them from the browser.

We can of course download the js file from the cdn and ship it, but that would make the experience for other people less nice since you don't get all the advantages that a central cdn gives you.

I've used the config migration tool https://mathjax.github.io/MathJax-demos-web/convert-configuration/convert-configuration.html, which then output these config options. They might be implicitly defined in the old `config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full`, or it just might be bug in the migration tool.

The default is aimed at sage users with lowest resources.

I think we need to provide `./configure --online-doc` option so that everyone can choose what he/she wants. Developers would of course have internet resource usually, but sometimes not (on airplane :). Personally I would prefer offline-doc.

No. We already have `SAGE_DOCBUILD_OPTS` environment variable. So we can

```
export SAGE_DOCBUILD_OPTS="--use-cdns"
```
before `make`.
