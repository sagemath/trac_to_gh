I don't think this change can break anyone's installation if that was done using the old instructions ("system-wide install"):
- the first variant, using symlinks, still works (we just don't advertise it any more)

- in the second variant, using a copy of the script, there's no problem because users were instructed to make the change (setting SAGE_ROOT) in the copy, not in the original. Their old copy will continue to work. If they attempt to copy and make the change again, they will see that there is no longer a place that prompts them to make the change.
