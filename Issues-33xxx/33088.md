In this ticket:
- (from #33426#comment:18) The link on the index page still goes to the wiki, which should be probably changed now that the relevant instructions are migrated. ​https://516701dbc7dd9738fb9d77ee3ac210c3919c8cb3--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/installation/index.html
- (follow up from #29784) Also should explain `configure --enable-editable` (https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.3#Editable_.28.22in-place.22.2C_.22develop.22.29_installs_of_the_Sage_library)
- The "install from source" chapter of the installation manual could be changed so that it points to README.md from the very beginning 

See also: 
- #33553 README Build from Source: m4 (step 5) is needed to run `make configure` (step 3)
- #33426 add more details on conda-based installations of Sage
- #31342 Extend documentation on how to set up the virtual environment
- #33648 Update/reorder git instructions in Developer's Guide
- #33649 Developer's Guide: Update reviewer's check list from wiki
- #30484 Documentation/configuration for Sage on Windows using Visual Studio (vscode) with a WSL remote
- #33662 Installation guide: Change "install from source" chapter so that it only provides extra detail in the same order as README.md

+- (from #33426#comment:18) The link on the index page still goes to the wiki, which should be probably changed now that the relevant instructions are migrated. ​https://516701dbc7dd9738fb9d77ee3ac210c3919c8cb3--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/installation/index.html

+To do, follow up from #29784:
+
+Also the reviewer's checklist https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/reviewer_checklist.html
+should be updated using material from https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReviewChecklist  and that wiki page replaced by a link to the manual.
+
+It could also explain when make ends in  Error building Sage, what to do next
+
+It might be also helpful to add the steps from ​https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25206#comment:63 to the documentation.
+
+The "install from source" chapter of the installation manual could be changed so that it points to README.md from the very beginning and only provides additional detail in the same order as the README.md

+In the developer guide, move "git the hard way" earlier and present "git-trac" only as an additional convenience.
