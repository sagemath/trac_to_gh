In this ticket:
- (from [#33426 comment:18](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/33426#comment:18)) The link on the index page still goes to the wiki, which should be probably changed now that the relevant instructions are migrated. ​https://516701dbc7dd9738fb9d77ee3ac210c3919c8cb3--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/installation/index.html
- (follow up from #29784) Also should explain `configure --enable-editable` (https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.3#Editable_.28.22in-place.22.2C_.22develop.22.29_installs_of_the_Sage_library)
- The "install from source" chapter of the installation manual could be changed so that it points to README.md from the very beginning 

See also: 
- #33553 README Build from Source: m4 (step 5) is needed to run `make configure` (step 3)
- #33426 add more details on conda-based installations of Sage
- #31342 Extend documentation on how to set up the virtual environment
- #33648 Update/reorder git instructions in Developer's Guide
- #33649 Developer's Guide: Update reviewer's check list from wiki
- #30484 Documentation/configuration for Sage on Windows using Visual Studio (vscode) with a WSL remote
- #33662 Installation guide: Change "install from source" chapter so that it only provides extra detail in the same order as README.md

Depends on #33426

-It could also explain when make ends in  Error building Sage, what to do next
