As noticed in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/2rNGCYg82rE/m/plZsnDN7EgAJ, Sage's spherical harmonics do not include the [Condon-Shortley phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics#Condon%E2%80%93Shortley_phase), which makes them differ by a factor (-1)<sup>m</sup> from Wikipedia, SymPy, SciPy and Mathematica spherical harmonics:

```
sage: theta, phi = var('theta phi')
sage: spherical_harmonic(1, 1, theta, phi)
1/4*sqrt(3)*sqrt(2)*sqrt(sin(theta)^2)*e^(I*phi)/sqrt(pi)
sage: from sympy import Ynm
sage: Ynm(1, 1, theta, phi).expand(func=True) # notice the sign difference 
-sqrt(6)*exp(I*phi)*sin(theta)/(4*sqrt(pi))
```

```
sage: n(spherical_harmonic(1, 1, pi/2, pi))
-0.345494149471335
sage: from scipy.special import sph_harm  # NB: theta and phi swapped in sph_harm 
sage: sph_harm(1, 1, n(pi), n(pi/2))  # notice the sign difference with Sage's result
(0.3454941494713355-4.231083042742082e-17j)
```
Furthermore, the computation of derivatives of spherical harmonics is based on a formula which assumes the Condon-Shortley phase! This makes it totally buggy:

```
sage: l, m, theta, phi = var('l m theta phi')
sage: Ylm = spherical_harmonic(l, m, theta, phi)
sage: DYlm = diff(Ylm, theta)
sage: DYlm
m*cot(theta)*spherical_harmonic(l, m, theta, phi)
 + sqrt((l + m + 1)*(l - m))*e^(-I*phi)*spherical_harmonic(l, m + 1, theta, phi)
sage: DYlm.subs({l: 1, m: 0})
1/2*sqrt(3)*sqrt(sin(theta)^2)/sqrt(pi)
sage: diff(spherical_harmonic(1, 0, theta, phi), theta) # sign opposite to above!
-1/2*sqrt(3)*sin(theta)/sqrt(pi)
```

Adding the Condon-Shortley phase in the definition of spherical harmonics would make them standard, thereby avoiding many confusions (especially with Wikipedia, SymPy and SciPy) and would fix the derivative computation.

Some things seem to be indented by 3 spaces,

Can you check indentation throughout?
In particular `.. MATH::` blocks.

Other than that, good to go.
Or that can be a separate ticket.
