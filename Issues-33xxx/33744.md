It appears there is a bug computing the bases and circuits of a `MatroidUnion`.

```
sage: k, h, n = 4, 3, 5
sage: M1 = matroids.Uniform(k-1, h)
sage: M2 = Matroid(bases = [frozenset({3}),frozenset({4})])
sage: M = M1.union(M2); M
Matroid of rank 4 on 5 elements as matroid union of 
Matroid of rank 3 on 3 elements with circuit-closures
{}
Matroid of rank 1 on 2 elements with 2 bases
