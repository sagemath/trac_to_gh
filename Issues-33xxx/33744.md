It appears there is a bug computing the bases and circuits of a `MatroidUnion`.

```
sage: k, h, n = 4, 3, 5
sage: M1 = matroids.Uniform(k-1, h)
sage: M2 = Matroid(bases = [frozenset({3}),frozenset({4})])
sage: M = M1.union(M2); M
Matroid of rank 4 on 5 elements as matroid union of 
Matroid of rank 3 on 3 elements with circuit-closures
{}
Matroid of rank 1 on 2 elements with 2 bases
sage: M.bases()
sage: M.bases()

However, if I were to make the change in the way you suggest, the place I see to change is on line 2645 of `matroids.pyx`. The `.basis()` and `.circuit()` methods still work for matroids that are not instances of `MatroidUnion`, so changing them seems to touch more things than necessary. By comparison the `CircuitClosureMatroid._rank(X)` method assumes `X` is a `frozenset`, but then calls `CircuitClosureMatroid._max_independent()`, which casts to a `set` anyway.
