The basis `L = J.interreduced_basis()` in the following example is incorrect. In particular, the variety of the ideal `J` contains a point (x, y) = (2, 0), which is missing in the variety of ideal of `L`. Also, the equality `R.ideal(L) == J` does not hold.

```

sage: J = R.ideal([x + 2, 2 * x, y])
sage: L = J.interreduced_basis()
sage: L
