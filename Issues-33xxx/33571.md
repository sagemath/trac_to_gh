```
The [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) documentation is outdated in some places as of [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) v9.6.beta4. 

For example, on https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_in_python.html
the `Pi` class is mentioned to be from the file `SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/functions/constants.py`, while on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS machine running [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) v9.6.beta4, it is at `SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/symbolic/constants.py`.

Similar errors in documentation exist in several places throughout https://doc.sagemath.com which should be updated to reflect the file structure of the latest release of [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath).

one does not need a new remote branch, just do `git push` with "force" (`-f`) to the old one.

```
git push trac HEAD:u/gh-adarsh-kishore786/documentation_is_outdated_in_some_places -f

it's a bit late, but let me point out a correct way to get rid of a file that was once checked in, from all commits. The following can be found in https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History (which has all the details and examples)

```
Removing a File from Every Commit

This occurs fairly commonly.
Someone accidentally commits a huge binary file with a thoughtless git add ., 
and you want to remove it everywhere. []
filter-branch is the tool you probably want to use to scrub your entire history. 
To remove a file named passwords.txt from your entire history,
you can use the --tree-filter option to filter-branch:

$ git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f passwords.txt' HEAD
```

hmm, no, sorry, it looks as if, indeed, as warned, it created a huge changeset. :-(

I've put on the correct branch you created for the other ticket instead:

Positive review.
