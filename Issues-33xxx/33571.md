```
The [SageMath](SageMath) documentation is outdated in some places as of [SageMath](SageMath) v9.6.beta4. 

For example, on https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_in_python.html
the `Pi` class is mentioned to be from the file `SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/functions/constants.py`, while on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS machine running [SageMath](SageMath) v9.6.beta4, it is at `SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/symbolic/constants.py`.

Similar errors in documentation exist in several places throughout https://doc.sagemath.com which should be updated to reflect the file structure of the latest release of [SageMath](SageMath).

No, simply create a new branch from some Sage 9.6.beta6 (or earlier beta), implement your changes, commit them and push the new branch to trac (with a new name), then replace the name of the branch in the `Branch` field of the ticket.

one does not need a new remote branch, just do `git push` with "force" (`-f`) to the old one.

```
git push trac HEAD:u/gh-adarsh-kishore786/documentation_is_outdated_in_some_places -f

```
Removing a File from Every Commit

This occurs fairly commonly.
Someone accidentally commits a huge binary file with a thoughtless git add ., 
and you want to remove it everywhere. []
filter-branch is the tool you probably want to use to scrub your entire history. 
To remove a file named passwords.txt from your entire history,
you can use the --tree-filter option to filter-branch:

$ git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f passwords.txt' HEAD
```
