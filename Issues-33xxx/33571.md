```
The [SageMath](SageMath) documentation is outdated in some places as of [SageMath](SageMath) v9.6.beta4. 

For example, on https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_in_python.html
the `Pi` class is mentioned to be from the file `SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/functions/constants.py`, while on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS machine running [SageMath](SageMath) v9.6.beta4, it is at `SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/symbolic/constants.py`.

Similar errors in documentation exist in several places throughout https://doc.sagemath.com which should be updated to reflect the file structure of the latest release of [SageMath](SageMath).

Maybe I am abusing by setting the ticket to "positive review". Did you plan to add something to it? The usual workflow is that the author sets the ticket to "needs review" state when it is ready from his point of view. If you would like to add something, please set the ticket to "needs work" state.

one does not need a new remote branch, just do `git push` with "force" (`-f`) to the old one.

```
Removing a File from Every Commit

This occurs fairly commonly.
Someone accidentally commits a huge binary file with a thoughtless git add ., 
and you want to remove it everywhere. []
filter-branch is the tool you probably want to use to scrub your entire history. 
To remove a file named passwords.txt from your entire history,
you can use the --tree-filter option to filter-branch:

$ git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f passwords.txt' HEAD
```

yes, assuming you're on the branch that you pushed to the remote `u/gh-adarsh-kishore786/documentation_is_outdated_in_some_places` (i.e. it should be the `HEAD`)

hmm, no, sorry, it looks as if, indeed, as warned, it created a huge changeset. :-(

I've put on the correct branch you created for the other ticket instead:
`u/gh-adarsh-kishore786/correct_wrong_paths_in_the_developer_s_guide` - it's good.

Positive review.
