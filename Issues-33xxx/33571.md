```
The [SageMath](SageMath) documentation is outdated in some places as of [SageMath](SageMath) v9.6.beta4. 

For example, on https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_in_python.html
the `Pi` class is mentioned to be from the file `SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/functions/constants.py`, while on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS machine running [SageMath](SageMath) v9.6.beta4, it is at `SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/symbolic/constants.py`.

Similar errors in documentation exist in several places throughout https://doc.sagemath.com which should be updated to reflect the file structure of the latest release of [SageMath](SageMath).

OK, but note that it is perfectly fine to have tickets that perform small fixes, like this one in its current state (2 lines in the source code). For instance, the ticket title could be narrowed to something like "Correct wrong paths in the developer's guide" and get positive review to be effective in Sage 9.6. Otherwise, it might remain open for a long time and the developer's guide will still have the errors you have spotted.

one does not need a new remote branch, just do `git push` with "force" (`-f`) to the old one.

```
git push trac HEAD:u/gh-adarsh-kishore786/documentation_is_outdated_in_some_places -f

it's a bit late, but let me point out a correct way to get rid of a file that was once checked in, from all commits. The following can be found in https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History (which has all the details and examples)

```
Removing a File from Every Commit

This occurs fairly commonly.
Someone accidentally commits a huge binary file with a thoughtless git add ., 
and you want to remove it everywhere. []
filter-branch is the tool you probably want to use to scrub your entire history. 
To remove a file named passwords.txt from your entire history,
you can use the --tree-filter option to filter-branch:

$ git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f passwords.txt' HEAD
```

yes, assuming you're on the branch that you pushed to the remote `u/gh-adarsh-kishore786/documentation_is_outdated_in_some_places` (i.e. it should be the `HEAD`)

hmm, no, sorry, it looks as if, indeed, as warned, it created a huge changeset. :-(

I've put on the correct branch you created for the other ticket instead:
`u/gh-adarsh-kishore786/correct_wrong_paths_in_the_developer_s_guide` - it's good.

Positive review.
