While updating the sagemath Debian package I noticed that when running the doctests for the installed sagemath package I get many failing tests such as the one below if library development files are not installed (in the example libm4ri-dev is not installed). The sagemath packages should not depend on lib*-dev packages, but sagemath is looking for pkgconfig files which are in these packages. Could this check for pkgconfig files in the test suite be avoided?

<a id='comment:1'></a>Run-time use of compilers is a feature of some parts of the Sage library - in this case `sage.misc.cython.cython`. These tests necessarily depend on dev headers (and the compilers!).

We should conditionalize these doctests on a `Feature`.
