```
If the new option `--baseline-stats-path PATH_TO_JSON_FILE` is given, read failure information from there.

Tests that already are marked as `failed` there will be specially marked as baseline failures in the doctest report.

If there are only baseline failures, no new failures, then `sage -t` will exit with status code 0.

Follow-ups:
- Record and handle more detailed failure info (failure counts?) in the json file. 
- #33232: `sage -t`: Write report in JUnitXML format
- use in patchbot: https://github.com/sagemath/sage-patchbot/issues/154
- #33222: use in new integration workflow

I don't really like the idea but it's probably a necessary evil. We're the only project where it can take a month to get trivial bug fixes into the development branch that's used for testing all of the other branches.

And (for example) sage-9.5 was released with a number of broken tests having fixes waiting to be merged.

I wish we could address **that** problem, but will settle for this one.

> This is an interesting idea. We can have a record of known failures in distros, in gentoo failing a test suite can prevent install. But with this, we could reduce it to really unexpected failures.

Note that currently the failures are recorded on the granularity of files, but it would be easy to make it more fine-grained to support this use case better.

I could imagine that could be better than carrying distro patches that patch out doctests

Definitely. On the other hand, things have moved considerably in the last couple of years. Most distros doctests failures these days are from some version mis-match of dependencies or some corner case that should be fixed. I had a brief period of zero doctest failures in sage-on-gentoo and I am hoping to get there again in 9.6.

Looking at my own patches, there is very little about doctest fixing/suppressing left, and the one that are, are about sage's packaging system.

As it turns out, I will soon be moving from testing sage after install to testing as part of the building process. Testing after install should still be doable but I will be moving my focus to the part of the building process. It automatically does all the version of python I intend to support while testing after install has a number of steps involved.

So, I now have the choice of patching everything to get to zero doctests failures or this ticket. A funny thing is that I may need to patch the sage sources for #33141 when the patch really should belong to their individual packages. 

There is also the problem of the regular transient failure(s) that only occur when doctesting in parallel and disappear once tested on their own - a long running and recurring issue, for which I only have this ticket to get out of.

I am not about building a test case to check on that :) But I had come to that conclusion about the naming, you don't import `__init__.py` files, they get read when you import the parent module. At least that's how I thought of it.

```
I probably will avoid running the test suite that way in the future. But I now can do automated testing in a venv (which is why a lot of stuff is prefixed with `/var/tmp/portage/sci-mathematics/sage-9999/work/sage-9999/src-python3_10/install`, that's the venv root), I ran the above test with `--installed` on the venv rather than with `--all` on the source - which is what I will focus on in the future. Everything in that test should have been caught by the provided baseline file but for some reason the stuff in the venv is not.
