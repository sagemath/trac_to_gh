If the new option `--baseline-stats-path PATH_TO_JSON_FILE` is given, read failure information from there.

Tests that already are marked as `failed` there will be specially marked as baseline failures in the doctest report.

If there are only baseline failures, no new failures, then `sage -t` will exit with status code 0.

Follow-ups:
- Record and handle more detailed failure info (failure counts?) in the json file. 
- #33232: `sage -t`: Write report in JUnitXML format
- use in patchbot: https://github.com/sagemath/sage-patchbot/issues/154
- #33222: use in new integration workflow

Note that currently the failures are recorded on the granularity of files, but it would be easy to make it more fine-grained to support this use case better.

On the other hand, things have moved considerably in the last couple of years.

Definitely. On the other hand, things have moved considerably in the last couple of years. Most distros doctests failures these days are from some version mis-match of dependencies or some corner case that should be fixed. I had a brief period of zero doctest failures in sage-on-gentoo and I am hoping to get there again in 9.6.

Looking at my own patches, there is very little about doctest fixing/suppressing left, and the one that are, are about sage's packaging system.

So, I now have the choice of patching everything to get to zero doctests failures or this ticket. A funny thing is that I may need to patch the sage sources for #33141 when the patch really should belong to their individual packages. 

There is also the problem of the regular transient failure(s) that only occur when doctesting in parallel and disappear once tested on their own - a long running and recurring issue, for which I only have this ticket to get out of.

and using this json file to establish the baseline

```
{"sage.env": {"failed": true},"sage.interfaces.gap_workspace": {"failed": true},"sage.plot.plot3d.tachyon": {"failed": true},"sage.tests.startup": {"failed": true},"sage_docbuild.__init__": {"failed": true},"sage_setup.find": {"failed": true},"sage.tests.cmdline": {"failed": true}}
```
How do I correctly deal with `sage_docbuild/__init__.py` since adding `"sage_docbuild.__init__": {"failed": true}` didn't help? Am I missing something obvious?

It may just be what it uses as the name of the module in this case. Pretty sure it does not mark all modules in this package as failed.

I am not about building a test case to check on that :) But I had come to that conclusion about the naming, you don't import `__init__.py` files, they get read when you import the parent module. At least that's how I thought of it.
