Follow-up to #13674 where I've tried to handle the case where sage was configured with `--disable-cvxopt`, but then apparently did some refactoring and never tried it again. This,

```python
except ModuleNotFoundError:
    # Sage can be built with --disable-cvxopt, so we have to            
    # handle the case where cvxopt is not present. The                  
    # superclass method is slow, but no longer raises an                
    # error, so let's try that.                                         
    L = super().cholesky()
```

should clearly have

```python
return super().cholesky()
```

or

```python
L = super().cholesky()
self.cache('cholesky', L)
return L
```

instead.
