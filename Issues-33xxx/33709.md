<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
I think at this point one should discuss, whether the suggested names and approach are good.

- The decorator `_modification_method` is a bit complicated, but it might make future methods easier.
E.g. we can easily implement

```
@_modification_method
def intersection(self, other):
    self._add_constraints(other.inequality_generator(), other.equation_generator())
```
  (Actually we need to name this something as `_intersection` and then call `_intersection` from `Polyhedron_base5.intersection`, because this is a modification method.
- Do we want the same methods in `Polyhedron_base` as well. Something like `add_vertex` (which should probably throw and error if called with `inplace=True`).
- What should happen if the base ring is wrong. Are we trying to catch this or not? E.g. what should `P.intersection(Q, inplace=True)` do for a mutable polyhedron `P`.


Use cases:
- If I implement `intersection` as suggested above, I already get a 10 percent improvement when running the benchmarks from #29661.
- 

```
sage: %time P = polytopes.hypercube(10)
CPU times: user 46.8 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 46.8 ms
Wall time: 46.1 ms
sage: %time Q = 2*polytopes.cross_polytope(10)
CPU times: user 102 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 102 ms
Wall time: 101 ms
sage: %time P.intersection(Q)
CPU times: user 6.87 s, sys: 3.95 ms, total: 6.87 s
Wall time: 6.87 s
A 10-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^10 defined as the convex hull of 180 vertices
sage: %time Q.intersection(P)
CPU times: user 6.9 s, sys: 3.97 ms, total: 6.91 s
Wall time: 6.91 s
A 10-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^10 defined as the convex hull of 180 vertices
sage: %time P.add_Hrepresentatives(Q.inequality_generator(), Q.equation_generator())
CPU times: user 3.76 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 3.76 s
Wall time: 3.76 s
A 10-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^10 defined as the convex hull of 180 vertices
sage: %time Q.add_Hrepresentatives(P.inequality_generator(), P.equation_generator())
CPU times: user 114 ms, sys: 7 Âµs, total: 114 ms
Wall time: 113 ms
A 10-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^10 defined as the convex hull of 180 vertices
```
  This will improve intersection and convex hull.
  Note that we only expose something, the backend is already capable of.
  But the advantage would be, that the user does not have to worry about it.
