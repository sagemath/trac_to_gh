(split out from #33213)

Until `tmp_filename` and `tmp_dir` are eliminated from the library, we don't want them cluttering up /tmp. In typical usage, this is easy enough to avoid by using one parent temporary directory to contain all the other temporary files and directories, and then removing that one parent as sage exits.
