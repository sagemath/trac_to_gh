Are we only listing the dependencies that already exist as SPKGs (i.e. skipping iniconfig) because those are the only ones that could be installing simultaneously?

If so, do we have to worry about importlib-metadata with python-3.7?

Replying to [@orlitzky](#comment%3A3):
> Are we only listing the dependencies that already exist as SPKGs (i.e. skipping iniconfig) because those are the only ones that could be installing simultaneously?

Rather, because these are the only ones that we can control via this mechanism.

If there is another SPKG installed via `requirements.txt` that has common dependencies with `pytest`, there could still be a race.

> If so, do we have to worry about importlib-metadata with python-3.7?

Thanks for catching this, I've added it.
