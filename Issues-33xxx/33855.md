```
When --enable-editable is in use, the Jupyter kernel sagemath is not being installed.

Workaround for users:
- Either install without `--enable-editable` first
- Or fix it using: `./sage -python -c 'from sage.repl.ipython_kernel.install import SageKernelSpec; SageKernelSpec.update()'`

---

In this ticket, we fix it by adding a custom `develop` command.

(In follow up ticket #30298, the jupyter kernel (but without the symlink `doc` -- which cannot and should not be stored in a wheel!) will also be added as `data_files` - and thus be available in all types of installations - `setup.py install`, wheel-based, and editable)
