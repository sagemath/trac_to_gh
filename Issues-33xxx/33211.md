In the two below examples, the only difference is that -5 and -3 are switched. The first HOMFLY polynomial is computed very fast, while for the second one Sage just dies and I have to restart it. I tried lots of bigger and more complicated links and HOMFLY always works fine for them, but for some reason the second braid below is problematic.

```
sage: Br = BraidGroup(7)
sage: L1 = Link(Br([3, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 4, -5, -4, -5, -3, -2, -4]))  # works super fast
sage: print(L1.homfly_polynomial())
sage: L2 = Link(Br([3, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 4, -5, -4, -3, -5, -2, -4]))  # hangs forever
sage: print(L2.homfly_polynomial())
1 - M^-2 + L^-2 - 2*L^-2*M^-2 - L^-4*M^-2
ERROR: 'killed'

Communication with the Sage server is failing.

I can't reproduce the error. 

What version of Sage and OS are you using?

Since [SnapPy](https://www.math.uic.edu/t3m/SnapPy/) is installed
on SageCell, perhaps it helps computing HOMFLY there?
