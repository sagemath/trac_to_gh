In #33125 we add special `MAKEFLAGS` parsing to `build/make/Makefile.in` because the alternative would require us to modify `spkg-install` for all script packages. But after #29386, script packages will be handled by sage-spkg, so it makes sense to reconsider moving the `MAKEFLAGS` handling into `sage-spkg`.

This is what the documentation recommends: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/POSIX-Jobserver.html

And while the end result should be the same, handling `MAKEFLAGS` in the script would be a bit more portable and simpler from the caller's perspective.
