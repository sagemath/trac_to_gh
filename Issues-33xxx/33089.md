On i386 some tests lead to errors like "corrupted size vs. prev_size" or "corrupted double-linked list" from glibc. memory_allocator appears in the stack trace.

It was reported in
https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/vo_m79EHAVc/m/fsxF78bGBAAJ

and we also see it with sage 9.4 in Debian:
https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=sagemath&arch=i386&ver=9.4-1&stamp=1640577283&raw=0
