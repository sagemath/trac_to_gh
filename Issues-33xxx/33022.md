In #32973, #32981, and #32995 some improvements to the `--warn-long` feature are discussed. Particularly in #32981, the `second_on_modern_computer()` multiplier is dropped, because as it stands, it often disables the `--warn-long` warnings entirely.

To reinstate the "CPU handicap," we should replace that function with one that performs a fixed amount of work. The amount of CPU time taken to perform that work can then be used as a multiplier to tweak the default `--warn-long` values.

This idea is still not perfect, but it should be better than a constant value, and avoids the problems with using old doctest statistics.
