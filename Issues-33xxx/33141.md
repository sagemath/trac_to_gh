Some doctests in sage_setup and sage_docbuild fail in sage-on-distributions. We can either

* disabled them on distribution with `# optional - sage_spkg` when source need to be available
* fix them when it make sense
* make test of lists more robust by ordering the results when we encounter them

After including #33064, #33085 and 32856, the failing doctests are

<a id='comment:1'></a>The first failing doctest expose some funny things in testing `_cythonised_dir`. The test block is as follow

```
        sage: from sage_setup.find import _cythonized_dir
        sage: from sage.env import SAGE_SRC
        sage: _cythonized_dir(SAGE_SRC)  # optional - build
        PosixPath('...')
        sage: _cythonized_dir(SAGE_SRC, editable_install=False)
        PosixPath('.../build/cythonized')
```
and the code

```
    from importlib import import_module
    from pathlib import Path
    from sage.env import SAGE_ROOT, SAGE_SRC
    if editable_install is None:
        if src_dir is None:
            src_dir = SAGE_SRC
        src_dir = Path(src_dir)
        sage = import_module('sage')
        d = Path(sage.__file__).resolve().parent.parent
        editable_install = d == src_dir.resolve()
    if editable_install:
        # Editable install: Cython generates files in the source tree
        return src_dir
    else:
        return Path(SAGE_ROOT) / "build" / "pkgs" / "sagelib" / "src" / "build" / "cythonized"
```
The test currently marked as `# optional - build` would succeed on distro. Because `editable_install` is found to be `True` in that case and in the case of Gentoo `SAGE_SRC` is `/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages` - which is not an editable location :).

When `editable_install` is set to `False` the code will always fail on distros since `SAGE_ROOT` is normally `None`. 

For the sake of consistency let's just make them both `# optional - build`.

I do agree that it should be done and it will help some tests. It won't help with a few tests that rely on doc sources themselves to be present.

I tried a few approaches to that. None worked in practice. I have tried to change `SAGE_DOC` at the start of test sequence, and it works when I try it manually, but not when the doctest runs. I tried to set `SAGE_DOC` at the start of `sage-runtests` and it equally failed. I have a feeling `sage_conf.py` does override a lot things.
