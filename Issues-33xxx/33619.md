The core of the elliptic-curve isogeny functionality in Sage is from #5976 — almost 13 years old! — and quite a few things in the `EllipticCurveIsogeny` class look somewhat dated by now.

In this patch, we make an effort to clean up `ell_curve_isogeny.py`. Besides plenty of style improvements, the main changes are:

- The documentation used to claim that only normalized, cyclic isogenies are supported. This is false for most of the codebase; these limitations only apply to a few selected algorithms (Kohel's formulas, Starks).

- The `EllipticCurveIsogeny` class contained some unused member variables, and some whose design choices seemed a bit random at times. I've streamlined the fields used to store the data of `EllipticCurveIsogeny`; among other things, this means we can unify the implementation of `.degree()` for all `EllipticCurveHom` children.

- The `degree` parameter for the `isogeny_codomain` method was unused; I've removed it.

- The `split_kernel_polynomial()` function appears to be equivalent to calling `.radical()` on the polynomial, which also seems a little bit faster.

- The `.n()` method only raised a `NotImplementedError`, but simply letting the call fall through to the parent class also fails gracefully. I've thus removed the specialized implementation.

- The `.get_{pre,post}_isomorphism()` methods won't really make sense once the corresponding (already deprecated) setters are removed. I added a remark to that effect.

Thanks for your responses!

In order to alleviate the burden of reviewing this admittedly rather large patch, how about splitting the review load by commits? This could be especially useful as some of the biggest changes are generic code quality improvements which shouldn't require any specific elliptic-curve expertise.

It's also worth noticing that the vast majority of the changes belong to only two commits:
- `472c1629198`, which contains *mostly* style and phrasing tweaks, with the only real difference being in the claims about requiring separable and/or normalized isogenies.
- `5c527009396`, which consists of generic code tweaks.

Of course, none of this is urgent in principle, but it will keep causing merge conflicts with pretty much anything touching this file down the line, so it'd be nice to get it merged sooner rather than later.

Bottom line: If any of you happens to find a moment to look at just one or a few of the commits, please do, and comment here which part you've reviewed.

I'm also adding a few more people to Cc who've recently been active reviewing elliptic-curve tickets.

This all looks good to me (I did read all the changes).  The following suggestions are very minor and only affect docstrings.  Otherwise, positive review (please add more names to the reviewers list too).

I agree with the previous comment but do not feel strongly enough about it to change it myself (as I never have all the other times I have worked on this file!)

"little-endian"?  I don't think saying this helps much.  In Sage, coefficient lists are always such that the i'th entry (indexed from 0 of course) is the coefficient of `x^i`.  Perhaps remove it.

The `_latex` and `_repr` methods for some reason describe themselves as "Sage-specific": surely a redundant thing to do.

The line

```
sage: P, = E.gens()
```
surprised me! I would have written `P = E.gens()[0]`, so I have learnt something, though I am not sure that the version with a comma on the left looks great.

Change of `pre isomorphism` to `pre-isomorphism`: I think the former is better since the latter wrongly suggests there is a mathematical notion pre-isomorphism.  

`__prei_ratl_maps`: Why is this plural? There is one rational map (the isogeny), which consists of several rational functions (rational map components). No?

Perhaps you can write about the `degree` option in a similar format to 

```diff
    - ``codomain`` -- an elliptic curve (default: ``None``).

      - If ``kernel`` is ``None``, ...
 
      - If ``kernel`` is not ``None``, ...
```

These hyphens are not necessary. Not improvements. 

```diff
-    A more complicated example of a characteristic 2 field::
+    A more complicated example of a characteristic-2 field::
```

```diff
-        Function that implements the call-ability of elliptic curve
-        isogenies.
+        Implement evaluation of elliptic-curve isogenies using the
+        function-call syntax.
```

```diff
     def __getitem__(self, i):
         r"""
-        Return one of the rational map components.
+        Return one of the rational-map components.
 
         .. NOTE::
```

I doubt this change is an improvement. The names `E1` and `E2` are consistenly used internally throughout the code while `domain()` and `codomain()` are the method names for a user. With this change, `E*` and `*domain` are mixed in the code. 

```diff
-    __E1 = None  # domain curve
-    __E2 = None  # codomain curve
+    _domain = None
+    _codomain = None
```
The original author protected `__E*` by using double underscores from subclasses. Is it intentional that you use single-underscored names?

"using the unary - operator" is not better?

```diff
     def __neg__(self):
         r"""
-        Function to implement unary negation (-) operator on
-        isogenies. Return a copy of this isogeny that has been
-        negated.
+        Implement negation of isogenies using the unary `-` syntax.
 
         EXAMPLES:
```

I don't see the value of these changes. The latter is hard to read:

```diff
-        a1 = E.a1()
-        a3 = E.a3()
+        a1, a3 = E.a1(), E.a3()
```
Similarly

```diff
-        self.__psi = psi
-        self.__phi = phi
-        self.__omega = omega
+        self.__psi, self.__phi, self.__omega = psi, phi, omega
 
-        self.__v = v
-        self.__w = w
+        self.__v, self.__w = v, w
```

Removing spaces after commas are hardly improvements. 

```diff
-        b2, b4, b6, _ = E.b_invariants()
+        b2,b4,b6,_ = E.b_invariants()
``` 
Similarly here

```diff

It doesn't suggest that to me. I think of it as shorthand for "isomorphism that we pre-compose with". Either way, this part of the functionality is being phased out with the more general composite-morphism class added in #32744. We shouldn't waste much energy on it.

There is also a `.rational_maps()` method, and an `.x_rational_map()` method. It may be considered an abuse of language, but it's in line with terminology used elsewhere in Sage. I don't have strong feelings about it.

All of these are examples of compound modifiers. Hyphenating them or not is fundamentally a question of personal style, but at least to my eyes the version with the hyphen is easier to parse. Your eyes seem to disagree. `:-)` Does "not improvements" mean you think the change makes it *worse* or just *not better*?

I don't think there was any reason for the double underscores. The names
`_domain` and `_codomain` are inherited from the parent class. Previously, `EllipticCurveIsogeny` was duplicating `__E1,__E2` into `_domain,_codomain` each time they changed, an unnecessary complication which does nothing useful while increasing the risk of mistakes.

Right. It was already there.

Your eyes seem to disagree. `:-)` Does "not improvements" mean you think the change makes it *worse* or just *not better*?


It makes it worse "to me", perhaps because it is rare (if not none) in sage source files to see both adjective form ("rational map") and compound modifier ("rational-map") in one place. As you think this is a personal style, I would not insist on it.

Thanks. Done, and also cleaned up the docstrings some more.

I've also prefixed an underscore to `isogeny_determine_algorithm`, as I can't imagine any way in which it could be helpful to users. In fact, I'd personally consider hiding some more of the helper functions in this module, but have resisted the temptation so far.
