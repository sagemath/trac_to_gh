```
The Sage doctester decides whether a Python file is part of a package based on the presence of `__init__.py` files. This is no longer appropriate because PEP 420 implicit namespace packages do not have `__init__.py` files; see #32501.

We implement a new function `sage.misc.package_dir.is_package_or_sage_namespace_package_dir`, which we will also use in #28925.

This change also removes a runtime dependency of the doctester on Cython, see #33029.

<a id='comment:6'></a>A few nitpicks from my side, otherwise looks good (codewise, didn't try it locally).

The explicit bool in https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/compare/develop...u/mkoeppe/prepare_sage_doctest_for_namespace_packages#diff-944be831a2285f89611252d94988abde763acd41fd84353c5b46c01df443dc82L680-L683 can probably be removed (at least according to the comment that had been there).


> sage: d = os.path.dirname(sage.cpython.__file__); d


For readability, I would propose to use `dir` or `directory` instead of the single-letter variable name.
