`gcd( factor(10), factor(15) )` works fine but `gcd( [factor(10), factor(15)] )` returns an error:

```
TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
```

A similar issue is with `lcm` function, although `lcm( [factor(10), factor(15)] )` results in a different error:

```
TypeError: no common canonical parent for objects with parents: 'Integer Ring' and '<class 'sage.structure.factorization_integer.IntegerFactorization'>'
```

Problem is this may be a valid patch from python point of view... but **math might not make any sense**.

I squshed it all into a single commit: https://github.com/sheerluck/sage/commit/faf7d9950ae31e727e366e485c23f86266df07ce

If only there were a way to convert that commit into **Brach** for this ticket... unfortunately, I lack that knowledge.
