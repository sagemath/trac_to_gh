`gcd( factor(10), factor(15) )` works fine but `gcd( [factor(10), factor(15)] )` returns an error:

```
TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
```

A similar issue is with `lcm` function, although `lcm( [factor(10), factor(15)] )` results in a different error:

```
TypeError: no common canonical parent for objects with parents: 'Integer Ring' and '<class 'sage.structure.factorization_integer.IntegerFactorization'>'
```

I need help with

```
TypeError: no common canonical parent for objects '11 * 13 * 19' and '13 * 19 * 113'
  types:
   '<class 'sage.structure.factorization_integer.IntegerFactorization'>' and

  with parents:
   '<class 'sage.structure.factorization_integer.IntegerFactorization'>' and
   '<class 'sage.structure.factorization.Factorization'>'
```
in `canonical_coercion` (coerce.pyx)

I should not just compare `type(x)` and `type(y)` with these types, should I?

Ok, I fixed coerce.pyx

```diff
--- a/src/sage/structure/coerce.pyx
+++ b/src/sage/structure/coerce.pyx
@@ -1390,9 +1390,11 @@ cdef class CoercionModel:
             except Exception:
                 self._record_exception()
 
+        if hasattr(x, "universe") and hasattr(y, "universe"):

```
All tests passed.

Problem is this may be a valid patch from python point of view... but **math might not make any sense**.

I squshed it all into a single commit: https://github.com/sheerluck/sage/commit/faf7d9950ae31e727e366e485c23f86266df07ce

If only there were a way to convert that commit into **Brach** for this ticket... unfortunately, I lack that knowledge.

Please also check that gcd/lcm work for generators like `lcm( factor(i) for i in (1..5) )`.
