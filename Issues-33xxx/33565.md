Apparently a code of conduct for the Sage community was adopted in 2014
- Code of Conduct
  https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/iGxa2F01rFc/m/Y4MMse3MDDsJ
- VOTE: code of conduct - ends Monday at midnight, PST.
  https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/dR3_eyIUyac/m/sh2JdCEkv3IJ
- IMHO having "sage-abuse" publicly readable is a bad idea
  https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/joG6eg56k8A/m/i_sReCt7bdkJ
- Publication of code of conduct?
  https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/luSvYAcCDn0/m/EFyRYnXLp0cJ
- When/by who/how was the "code of conduct" initiated ?
  https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/voyJJG2qNTE/m/9zjGkg-345AJ
- proposed amendment to code of conduct

- sage foundation ???
  https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/sGFOYBeEq-Q/m/0kUY7s9BDAAJ

It is published only on the Sage wiki on a rather confusing page:
- https://wiki.sagemath.org/Community?action=show&redirect=CodeOfConduct

In this ticket, we add it to the main repo as the file `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to match the standard practices in the open source world.
