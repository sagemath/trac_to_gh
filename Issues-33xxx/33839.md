As announced in [ticket:32169#comment:40 32169#comment:40], thanks to the help of Loukas Georgiadis [1] for providing an experimental C code, we implement in Cython the algorithm proposed by Gabow [2] for computing the edge connectivity of directed graphs.

Suggestions for adding more tests and documentation are more than welcome.

The code is quite fast

A few comments for now.

- You introduced a leading space here:

```diff
+ .. [BHS2008] Robert Bradshaw, David Harvey and William
              Stein. strassen_window_multiply_c. strassen.pyx, Sage
              3.0, 2008. http://www.sagemath.org
```

- What is happening here? Is this for a follow up ticket?

```diff
+        sage: GabowEdgeConnectivity(D).edge_disjoint_spanning_trees()
+        Traceback (most recent call last):
+        ...
+        NotImplementedError: this method has not been implemented yet
...
+        sage: GabowEdgeConnectivity(D).edge_connectivity()
+        Traceback (most recent call last):
+        ...
+        ValueError: This method is not known to work on graphs with multiedges. ...
```

- To avoid segmentation faults in case one calls `GabowEdgeConnectivity`

- You can call `MemoryAllocator.calloc`, to skip the following lines:

```diff
+        for i in range(self.max_ec):
+            self.labeled[i] = NULL
+            self.parent_1[i] = NULL
+            self.parent_2[i] = NULL
+            self.parent_edge_id_1[i] = NULL
+            self.parent_edge_id_2[i] = NULL
+            self.depth_1[i] = NULL
+            self.depth_2[i] = NULL
```

- You are raising some errors in methods without exception value, e.g.
  `raise ValueError("did not find the right edge")` in `cdef int fundamental_cycle_step(self, int e_id, int tree)`. This should instead be declared as

```
cdef int fundamental_cycle_step(self, int e_id, int tree) except -1:
```
  (maybe the return value should be explained in the documenation)
  
  Then dependendent methods should get exception values as well.

- The code lacks interrupts. Could you add them with `sig_check` maybe? The nice thing is that `compute_edge_connectivity` is called during `__init__`, so in case of interruption the initialization gets interrupted and we don't have to worry about an inconsistent object, right?
- To my knowledge the following code is redundant:

```diff
+        for i in range(self.n):
+            self.g_out[i].clear()
+            self.g_in[i].clear()
```
  See https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/resize.
  The objects inserted by `resize` are defaults and the default for `vector[int]` is just the empty vector.

1. Method  `edge_disjoint_spanning_trees()` is for a follow up ticket (I hope with a GSoC student)
2. I have changed `allocarray` to `calloc`
3. I'm reluctant to remove `self.g_out[i].clear()`. I agree with you with the specification of the `resize` method, but I already had some issues in a C++ code. If you really think it's safe, I can do the change
4. I tried to add some checked for signals and errors.
   - I think that the `raise ValueError(..)` statements in `fundamental_cycle_step` should never be called unless there is a bug in the code.
   - I added an extra binary variable to ensure that the edge connectivity has effectively been computed. I'm not sure this is needed with all the `sig_check`.

Thank you for this first round of comments.
