<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
An issue is that currently Sage creates an instance of the `FriCAS` interface as part of loading `sage.interfaces.all`. This now fails:

```
  File "/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-gcc11/src/sage/interfaces/fricas.py", line 291, in __init__
    fricas_exe = FriCASExecutable().absolute_filename()
  File "/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-gcc11/src/sage/features/__init__.py", line 615, in absolute_filename
    raise FeatureNotPresentError(self,
sage.features.FeatureNotPresentError: fricas_exe is not available.
Executable 'fricas' not found on PATH.
No equivalent system packages for homebrew are known to Sage.
To install fricas_exe using the Sage package manager, you can try to run:
  !sage -i fricas
No equivalent system packages for pip are known to Sage.
```
