We have optional tests that make use of these packages, for example:

```
sage: a.show(format="webm", iterations=1)  # optional -- ffmpeg
```

```
sage: with open(td + 'wave.gif', 'rb') as f: print(b'!\xf9\x04\x08\x14\x00' in f.read())  # optional -- ImageMagick
```

These tests are run whenever the corresponding "feature" is available, but the feature checks look only for the `convert` and `ffmpeg` programs. Both imagemagick and ffmpeg can be built without support for (say) webm files, making the tests above fail. To avoid spurious failures, the features should test for the necessary file format support, likely in the `is_functional()` method.

I don't think we need to tighten `spkg-configure.m4` -- this does not influence the `ffmpeg` optional tag at all.

These tags are added by runtime `Feature` checks, not via `spkg-configure.m4`

If these doctests are the only ways that we "need" these features, perhaps it would be enough to just mark them as "not tested"?

There are like 79 optional imagemagick doctests and 19 optional ffmpeg doctests:

```
$ git grep "optional -* ImageMagick" | wc
     76     678    7649
$ git grep "optional -* imagemagick" | wc
      3      23     305
$ git grep "optional -* ffmpeg" | wc
     19     151    1895
```

We can mark two of them as "not tested" if they do not work with all versions of ffmpeg/imagemagick. But I still think it is a good thing to test that the remaining `79 + 19 - 2` doctests still work on all versions of ffmpeg.

My opinion is that either we expect doctests to work and we test them or we expect doctests not to work and we do not test them.

I agree, I meant these 2 failing ones only.

Thank you for the log.

I see the error message `convert convert: No decode delegate for this image format (00000000.png).` Can you provide what is the output of `convert -list Format` on this machine? I wonder if the output of such command could be used to check that the feature works in the feature code?

Also I see:

```

```
which does not say much about the error. I think the `check_call(cmd, shell=True)` should be replaced in the method `_gif_from_imagemagick` by something which returns more info when it fails. I did something like that in the ticket #20343 (see method `def pdf`). We could do the same here.

The content of the second column is not the same in my case:

```

* native blob support

```

Most of the doctests are doing a conversion (bunch of pngs) -> gif.

Do you think something based on

```
convert -list Format | grep PNG
```
could be a good test to detect that `convert *.png output.gif` works?

For info, for me it gives this:

```

      MNG* PNG       rw+   Multiple-image Network Graphics (libpng 1.6.37)

Needs review!

Also, I would be curious to see the following outputs with the current branch for your machine:

```
sage: from sage.features.imagemagick import ImageMagick
sage: ImageMagick().is_present()
FeatureTestResult('imagemagick', True)
sage: ImageMagick().is_functional()
FeatureTestResult('imagemagick', True)
sage: ImageMagick().require()
```

Also this allows to run tests on the 5 failings files and list the skipped doctects:

```
sage -tp --long --show-skipped src/sage/combinat/crystals/mv_polytopes.py src/sage/combinat/tiling.py src/sage/combinat/words/paths.py src/sage/plot/animate.py src/sage/plot/plot3d/tachyon.py
```

For comparison, for me, it gives this:

```

I thought it was always the case that `is_present()` returns False when `is_functional()` returns `False`. But the above is a counterexample to this (it is a good thing, because it is more logical like that). I think my thinking was mislead by the way `_is_present` method is coded for the class `Executable` which is not consistent with the other type of features like the one here, see https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/features/__init__.py?h=develop#n442

I think doctests are run for a feature when `is_present()` returns `True` which explains why the feature imagemagick are tested in your case. It should also check that it is functional as well.

Also, `require()` currently only check that `is_present()` returns True. This is the other reason I was thinking that `is_present()` should return `False` if `is_functional()` return False.

Maybe changes needs to be done with respect to `is_present()`, `is_functional()` and `require()`. In particular, I have the following questions for `@`mkoeppe:
- why `Feature.require()` does not check that `is_functional()` is True?
- should `is_present()` always return False when `is_functional` return False (even if the vocabulary that is used should logically allow it)?
But this discussion should be done in another ticket.

I don't think you are cleaning up the temporary files.

Have you considered using `with TemporaryDirectory` instead? See https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.TemporaryDirectory.

This also lets you create a named file in the temporary directory and so you don't need to run with `shell=True` which might be considered a security issue by some.

No, not the ffmpeg ones, obviously =)

I double-checked all of the `# optional - ImageMagick` tests and it looks like the only other format we use is ppm, but imagemagick support for ppm is apparently impossible to disable. So the existing test for a PNG conversion is probably all we need.

Indeed, I am not. Should I?

Well the files are created in the current temporary folder `SAGE_TMP` within `DOT_SAGE` folder using the methods implemented in the misc folder: `from sage.misc.temporary_file import tmp_filename`. This method is already using the `tempfile` module within some temporary directory with some [SageMath](SageMath) salt. It is used all over the place in sage:

```
$ git grep tmp_filename | wc
    264    1325   20892
```

And I don't remember any of its usage to contain any line which deletes the temporary files created (do you know one such place?). The temporary folder and the temporary files for instance all pictures generated by sage during the session gets deleted when sage closes as shown in the example below:

```
sage: SAGE_TMP

These tests are there since the very beginning of Sage. I think the idea is that it is difficult to test that a GIF is correct as we do not want a human to look at them each time. The idea is to only check that some binary string appear in the middle of the created gif file.

So if it is False, my first advice would be to actually look at the animation with your eyes, because possibly they are broken. Are they?

Depends on the answer to the first question.

So long as we're already using imagemagick, something like

```
$ identify -format "%m" /home/mjo/.sage/temp/gantu/29047/dir_b77_l8ae/my_animation.gif
GIFGIFGIFGIFGIFGIFGIFGIFGIF
```

is nice and easy.

I was originally just very confused about the *.png. I don't think you need this. You can just convert the file that you created directly instead, can't you? This will also not interact with other .png files that happen to exist in this directory.

I would really try to get rid of the shell=True, though. Apart from security concerns, shell=True makes things break in all kinds of weird ways in strangely configured environments.

sage: from sage.features.ffmpeg import FFmpeg
sage: FFmpeg().is_present()
FeatureTestResult('ffmpeg', True)
sage: FFmpeg().is_functional()
FeatureTestResult('ffmpeg', True)
sage: FFmpeg().require()
```

`@`mjo: Can you provide the output of the above for your machine?

`@`mjo: Also, can you confirm you also have a infinite loop while testing `sage -t src/sage/features/ffmpeg.py` or maybe you won't have the infinite loop since the feature ffmpeg turns out not to be present and functional. If no infinite loop, you can also report whether `sage -t src/sage/plot/animate.py` looks better.

Looks like it should with the busted ffmpeg:

```
sage: from sage.features.ffmpeg import FFmpeg
sage: FFmpeg().is_present()
FeatureTestResult('ffmpeg', False)
sage: FFmpeg().is_functional()
FeatureTestResult('ffmpeg', False)
sage: FFmpeg().require()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FeatureNotPresentError                    Traceback (most recent call last)
...
```

> `@`mjo: Also, can you confirm you also have a infinite loop while testing `sage -t src/sage/features/ffmpeg.py`


But I also get the infinite loop. Should be a fun mystery since I don't see anything obviously wrong in `ffmpeg.py`.

Actually, could you paste the full output of `FFmpeg().require()`? I have been trying to improve the way the error is printed. In ffmpeg.log, an error is reported, but we can't see what exactly. This should be better now.

Do you have an infinite loop when you run `sage -t src/sage/plot/animate.py` ?

Conversely, the following creates an hang for `sage -t src/sage/features/imagemagick.py`:

Something seems to be wrong in the `parallel_dispatch` method of the `doctest/forker.py` file because using `serial_dispatch` works fine:

```
$ sage -t --serial src/sage/features/ffmpeg.py 
[...]
Doctesting 1 file.
sage -t --random-seed=282697849359684697319918281520742422437 src/sage/features/ffmpeg.py

----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Features detected for doctesting: ffmpeg
```

Note that the `--serial` option is not mentionned in the doc of `sage -t -h`, but it is mentionned in the `dispatch` method in the `forker.py` file.

I still don't know how the ffmpeg.py file produces the infinite loop for `sage -t`.

The documentation of [subprocess.run](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run) says that it *"run the command described by args. Wait for command to complete, then return a CompletedProcess instance."*

Maybe the fact of running the doctests within parallel threads makes it so that the `ffmpeg` command run by `run` does not complete?

There are still some ffmpeg issues. Unlike with imagemagick, we try several different formats with ffmpeg and all need to be supported. For example, having re-enabled whatever I needed to get `is_functional()` to pass,

```

```

I would imagine we need similar checks for 

```
sage: a.show(format="ogg")         # optional -- ffmpeg
sage: a.show(format="mp4")         # optional -- ffmpeg
```

and I'll try to confirm that.

I added all outputs that I can see in the `ffmpeg.log` in which we can see two different kind of commands invoking ffmpeg. Only the format `'.mpg'` is incompatible with `rbg24` parameter.

On my machine, `require()` now takes 1s, but it is cached:

Maybe the current `is_functional()` for ffmpeg is exagerated. Maybe we can simplify and test only few well-chosen formats? If so, which formats do you think?

Or make them choose some at random? But, I guess this is not good as we may want `is_functional` to be consistent and reproducible.

    FeatureTestResult('ffmpeg', False)
**********************************************************************
2 items had failures:
   1 of   3 in sage.features.ffmpeg.FFmpeg
   1 of   3 in sage.features.ffmpeg.FFmpeg.is_functional
    [6 tests, 2 failures, 0.76 s]
```
So `FFmpeg().require()` works well in the sense that it detects that something does not work well with ffmpeg (related to ogg format). But then, this status should imply that doctests with optional tag ffmpeg are **not** run. Related to that, I observe above that the optional tag `ffmpeg` has disappeared:

```
    FFmpeg().is_present()
```
as opposed to

```
    FFmpeg().is_present() # optional -- ffmpeg
```
This may explain that those tests are run while they should not. So why are the optional ffmpeg tags gone?
