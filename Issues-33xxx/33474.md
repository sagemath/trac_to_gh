With these patches, building still fails, at extension building, as it can't find `libmodred.so`.

It is fixed by exporting, before build, `LDFLAGS="-L<SAGE_ROOT>/venv/lib"`,
as that's where `libmodres.so` gets installed.

What's the correct way to fix this?

should be fixed through #30787.
The non-Python package `modular_resolution` should be installed in SAGE_LOCAL.
