As Thebe was not working in our sage documentation, we removed it from sage (see #33309, #33529) and introduced a new tool jupyter-sphinx in #33507.

As we move to the new tool, the ticket

- #24593 "Provide live documentation support in Jupyter using Thebe"

was closed.

Based on the efforts of #24593, the goal of this ticket is to deliver the live documentation using jupyter-sphinx so that every code blocks on every documentation page can be activated.

This ticket patches `jupyter-sphinx` with 
- https://github.com/kwankyu/jupyter-sphinx/compare/upstream...v0.3.2-sage-trac-33320?expand=1

## Preparation before build
Suppress warnings by

```
sage -i debugpy 
sage -pip install soupsieve 
```

Install jupyterlab (for live doc with a local server) 

```
sage -i jupyterlab_widgets
```

## Build

- Default static doc: 

```
make
```

- Live doc with binder server:

```
export SAGE_LIVE_DOC=yes
make
```

- Live doc with local server:
  {{{
  export SAGE_LIVE_DOC=yes
  export SAGE_JUPYTER_SERVER=http://localhost:8889
  export SAGE_JUPYTER_SERVER_TOKEN=secret  # default 
  make
  }}}
  Run
  {{{
  sage --notebook=jupyterlab \
    --ServerApp.token='secret' \
    --ServerApp.allow_origin='null' \
    --ServerApp.disable_check_xsrf=true \
    --ServerApp.port=8889 \
    --ServerApp.open_browser=false 
  }}}
  before browsing the documentation.

If things do not work as expected, removing the existing documentation by

```
make doc-clean doc-uninstall
```
may be necessary before `make`. If this is burdensome, try first

```
sage --docbuild reference_top html
```
which updates static files (javascripts) directory.

## Selective Build

Build static doc

```
make
```
and then build live doc selectively either by

```
sage --docbuild --live-doc prep html
```
or by

```
export SAGE_JUPYTER_SERVER=http://localhost:8889
export SAGE_JUPYTER_SERVER_TOKEN=secret  # default 
sage --docbuild --live-doc prep html
```

## Direct use of `.. JUPYTER-EXECUTE::` is deprecated

As #33507 added jupyter-sphinx extension to Sphinx conf, it provided `.. JUPYTER-EXECUTE::` directive to documentation authors to add executable code blocks. As the present ticket allows to build the live documentation in which all code blocks are executable, direct use of the directive by documentation authors is deprecated. Along with this change, an issue of heavy javascript injections, which slows down documentation pages loading time, is fixed in this ticket.

I thought about reducing live doc building time. But it seems that this should be done on jupyter-sphinx side, or rather by forking it to make our own tailored for sage. In short, this belongs to a wishlist.

As the live doc is optional, it is safe to merge this branch now.

Some questions:

- Should the live docs be built in a different location (for example "html_live") so that it can coexist with the static documentation? Then it would play a role more like the PDF documentation.

- Should building the live docs be an option for `./configure`, and/or a `make` target, like the PDF docs? (Separately, I wonder if options like `SAGE_SKIP_PLOT_DIRECTIVE` should also be controlled by `./configure` arguments.)

So if I understand correctly, both (1) during the documentation build and (2) when viewing the documentation, either (a) binder is used or (b) a local Jupyter is used.

Is it possible to do 1(b) and 2(a)?

I don't understand why. Instead you should do\n\n```\nsage --docbuild prep html\nexport SAGE_JUPYTER_SERVER=http://localhost:8888\nexport SAGE_JUPYTER_SERVER_TOKEN=secret\nsage --docbuild --live-doc prep html\n```\nThis is because sphinx recognizes the changes of the config variable `jupyter_execute_default_kernel` but not of `jupyter_sphinx_thebelab_config`.

When you do 1(b), thebe configuration is baked into the htmls, so you cannot do 2(a).

If you want to do 1(a) for the whole documentation, and do 2(b) for a specific documentation, for instance 'prep', then 

```
export SAGE_JUPYTER_SERVER=http://localhost:8888
export SAGE_JUPYTER_SERVER_TOKEN=secret
sage --docbuild --live-doc prep html
```
should work, but does not. I don't understand why. Instead you should do

```
sage --docbuild prep html
export SAGE_JUPYTER_SERVER=http://localhost:8888
export SAGE_JUPYTER_SERVER_TOKEN=secret
sage --docbuild --live-doc prep html
```
This is because sphinx recognizes the changes of the config variable `jupyter_execute_default_kernel` but not of `jupyter_sphinx_thebelab_config`. Any idea why?

It is because jupyter-sphinx enrolls `jupyter_execute_default_kernel` as a config value of type `env` and `jupyter_sphinx_thebelab_config` as a config value of type `html`.

You mean `make doc-clean; make doc-uninstall; make`? 

The first failure seems not related with this ticket...

> Probably, if possible, the instructions should be refined so that the server app does not fall back to another port but rather gives a hard error.


Done.

I think this is the primary purpose of the documentation -- running the examples as they are. If they want to do variations, they should go to jupyter and copy-paste.

Of course, it is easy to allow user modifications. A couple of configuration changes. But first we have to decide what behavior we want.

> (Also, in doctest blocks with more than one command, it only shows the last result or the first error.)


This is to be done by editing the documentation. We cannot make jupyter-sphinx an AI.

I just found this project:

https://sphinx-thebe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

It may be more suitable for us.

sphinx-thebe translates nodes

```
.. container::
   :class: thebe
   
   1 + 1
```
to html elements that can be activated by thebe.

jupyter-sphinx executes nodes

```
.. jupyter_execute::

   1 + 1
```
by jupyter and insert the output to the built htmls and can also insert html elements that can be activated by thebe.

Presently we are using jupyter-sphinx but suppressing jupyter execution part (somewhat clumsily), which we don't need currently.

There is also a discussion (https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-sphinx/issues/137) about using sphinx-thebe for jupyter-sphinx's thebe part. It is unclear how much this progressed.

So I think that from where we stand, there is no clear benefit of switching to sphinx-thebe.

Using live docs, I realized that many example code blocks in sage documentation are not ready for live run, and frequently needs user's editing before run. Hence I changed my mind, and the last commit makes code blocks editable.
