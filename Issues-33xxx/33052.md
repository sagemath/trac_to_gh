Tested using `tox -e local-conda-forge-macos-minimal` on a system that has homebrew (including `boost`) in `/usr/local`:

```

This failure follows a familiar pattern: Our `configure` script tests for the presence of `boost` but our build system does not tell the `boost`-using package (`brial`) where it is.

I am a bit concerned that something in a standard location like `/usr/local/` is not found. If this is the case, there must be something wrong in `brial`'s own build system.

Since `boost` should be checked by `brial`'s `configure`, this is all the more confusing that things break down during compilation. I'd like to have more of the `brial` build log.

No, I don't think so. On macOS, I would not consider `/usr/local` as a standard location but rather as a "legacy location"; because it is disabled in various contexts by setting the sysroot explicitly to one of the Xcode sysroots.

Note that the only reason that our `configure` script finds Boost is that it explicitly searches some candidate locations which are not on compiler search paths.
