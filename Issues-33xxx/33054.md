Yes, but this branch *already* does,

```
sed "s/-std=c++/-std=gnu++/g"
```

and that could just as easily be

```
sed "s/-std=c++//g"
```

I was also thinking that this ticket was responsible for `-DWITH_POPCNT=OFF`, but it looks like that came from elsewhere. Nevertheless, there's an upstream fix for it that doesn't cause a performance degradation:

  https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount/commit/b5a8286e5d3757bcc4b41c0ea6240f14403c379d

The `CMakeLists.txt` says "POPCNT instruction is very important for performance", so using the upstream patch would be an improvement over the unconditional OFF.

No, this doesn't work because the compiler without the -std flag may not be using a sufficiently new standard.

Yes, #33082.

Nevertheless, there's an upstream fix for it that doesn't cause a performance degradation:

[#33082 comment:4](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/33082#comment:4) explains that our fix also does not lead to performance degradation.
