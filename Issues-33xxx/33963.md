Trac ticket #33962 fixed the sign of `legendre_P(n, 0)` when `n` is an explicit integer. The patch also tried to fix the sign when `n` is a symbolic integer variable, but the patch does not work. Even with the patch, we have:

```
sage: n = var("n")
sage: assume(n, "integer")
sage: assume(n, "even")
sage: legendre_P(n, 0)
2^(-n + 2)*gamma(n)/(n*gamma(1/2*n)^2)
```
This is missing a factor of `(-1)^(n/2)`.

The incorrect value arises because pynac erroneously simplifies the expression `pow(_ex_1, n / _ex2)` to `1`. (The constant `_ex_1` is pynac's name for `-1`.)
The problem seems to be that pynac thinks `n / _ex2` is even: printing `(n / _ex2).info(info_flags::even)` at this point in the code yields `1` (meaning the flag is set).

Keywords: parity, sign error, pynac

<a id='comment:2'></a>The bug is in `case info_flags::even` of pynac's `mul::info` method. A product is even if all of the factors are integers, and at least one of the factors is even. However, one of the factors in a `mul` object is the `overall coefficient`, and the method neglected to check that this coefficient is an integer. 

In the example of the ticket description, pynac represents the expression `n/2` as the product `1/2 * n`, where `1/2` is the overall coefficient. This coefficient is obviously not an integer.
