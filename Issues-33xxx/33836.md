As pointed out in [this sage_devel thread](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/geYKS4uXd5o/m/558F4-VrBQAJ), the Lie algebra method `chevalley_eilenberg_complex()` raises an exception in the following example:

```
sage: g = lie_algebras.sl(QQ,2)
sage: E,F,H = g.basis()
sage: n = g.subalgebra([F,H])
sage: n.chevalley_eilenberg_complex()
Exception raised by child process with pid=15420:

    return cache[k]
KeyError: (None, False, True)

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

I have a little bit of time and I found the source of the bug: the `to_vector()` returns a vector based on the ambient space:

```
sage: n.an_element()
h1
sage: _.to_vector()
(0, 1, 0)
```
We don't want to change this as the (linear algebraic) model for this is a subspace of a vector space:

```
sage: _.parent()
Vector space of degree 3 and dimension 2 over Rational Field
User basis matrix:
[0 1 0]
[0 0 1]
```
So we just need to remove an assumption that the length of the vector equals the dimension of the vector space.

Okay, here is a fix that converts the vector to something of the correct length when working with a submodule. Timings (run with 1 core for more expressive timings):

```
sage: g = lie_algebras.sl(QQ,2)  # 3 dim
sage: %time g.chevalley_eilenberg_complex(ncpus=1)
CPU times: user 16 ms, sys: 12 ms, total: 28 ms
Wall time: 68.4 ms
sage: g = lie_algebras.sp(QQ,4)  # 10 dim
sage: %time g.chevalley_eilenberg_complex(ncpus=1)
CPU times: user 24 ms, sys: 56 ms, total: 80 ms
Wall time: 612 ms
Chain complex with at most 11 nonzero terms over Rational Field
sage: g = lie_algebras.sl(QQ,4)  # 15 dim
sage: %time g.chevalley_eilenberg_complex(ncpus=1)
CPU times: user 35 s, sys: 188 ms, total: 35.1 s
Wall time: 1min 12s
```
versus before

```
sage: g = lie_algebras.sl(QQ,2)  # 3 dim
sage: %time g.chevalley_eilenberg_complex(ncpus=1)
CPU times: user 16 ms, sys: 12 ms, total: 28 ms
Wall time: 67.2 ms
sage: g = lie_algebras.sp(QQ,4)  # 10 dim
sage: %time g.chevalley_eilenberg_complex(ncpus=1)
CPU times: user 36 ms, sys: 48 ms, total: 84 ms
Wall time: 577 ms
sage: g = lie_algebras.sl(QQ,4)  # 15 dim
sage: %time g.chevalley_eilenberg_complex(ncpus=1)
CPU times: user 31.8 s, sys: 124 ms, total: 31.9 s
Wall time: 1min 6s
```
So there is some slowdown likely between 5-10%, but it can't be helped because the code needs to work.

> So there is some slowdown likely between 5-10%,

I'm wondering about that! There is only one `if` condition on a `boolean` in addition (of course in a long `for` loop). Maybe this 5-10% have been caused by some external influences. I repeated your test (on an i7 CPU running under WSL). The first and the last example were even slower without the ticket:

With the ticket:

```sage
sage: g = lie_algebras.sl(QQ,2)  # 3 dim
sage: %time g.chevalley_eilenberg_complex(ncpus=1)
CPU times: user 0 ns, sys: 18.4 ms, total: 18.4 ms
Wall time: 44.5 ms
Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Rational Field
sage: g = lie_algebras.sp(QQ,4)  # 10 dim
sage: %time g.chevalley_eilenberg_complex(ncpus=1)
CPU times: user 50.5 ms, sys: 30.1 ms, total: 80.6 ms
Wall time: 443 ms
Chain complex with at most 11 nonzero terms over Rational Field
sage: g = lie_algebras.sl(QQ,4)  # 15 dim
sage: %time g.chevalley_eilenberg_complex(ncpus=1)
CPU times: user 13.6 s, sys: 88 ms, total: 13.7 s
Wall time: 28.7 s
Chain complex with at most 16 nonzero terms over Rational Field
```


Without the ticket:

```sage
sage: g = lie_algebras.sl(QQ,2)  # 3 dim
sage: %time g.chevalley_eilenberg_complex(ncpus=1)
CPU times: user 11.1 ms, sys: 11.3 ms, total: 22.4 ms
Wall time: 52.8 ms
Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Rational Field
sage: g = lie_algebras.sp(QQ,4)  # 10 dim
sage: %time g.chevalley_eilenberg_complex(ncpus=1)
CPU times: user 58.4 ms, sys: 20.6 ms, total: 79 ms
Wall time: 435 ms
Chain complex with at most 11 nonzero terms over Rational Field
sage: g = lie_algebras.sl(QQ,4)  # 15 dim
sage: %time g.chevalley_eilenberg_complex(ncpus=1)
CPU times: user 13.8 s, sys: 7.25 ms, total: 13.9 s
Wall time: 29 s
Chain complex with at most 16 nonzero terms over Rational Field
```

Anyway, you should add a test showing that the issue is fixed.
