I only have trouble with parallel make of the documentation if I do `make doc-html doc-pdf` in one go. Then yes, there are parallel make issue that are uncovered once it is enabled by #32298. :(

The missing `../../..` is apparently already wrong in the doctree file:

```
[release@zen Sage]$ strings ./local/share/doc/sage/doctrees/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/crystals/mv_polytopes.doctree | grep mv_polytopes-1
.. figure:: ../../../../../../../../local/share/doc/sage/doctrees/en/reference/plot_directive/sage/combinat/crystals/mv_polytopes-1.svg

r../../../../../local/share/doc/sage/doctrees/en/reference/plot_directive/sage/combinat/crystals/mv_polytopes-1.png
```
The docstring with the originial `figure:` has 8, but the actual images only 5 ".."s

I've been building it a couple of times now and sometimes the (incorrect) relative path ends up in the tex file, and sometimes there is only the filename like:

```
\noindent\sphinxincludegraphics[width=300\sphinxpxdimen]{{mv_polytopes-1}.pdf}

The latter works, the former does not.
