I only have trouble with parallel make of the documentation if I do `make doc-html doc-pdf` in one go. Then yes, there are parallel make issue that are uncovered once it is enabled by #32298. :(

I've been building it a couple of times now and sometimes the (incorrect) relative path ends up in the tex file, and sometimes there is only the filename like:

```
\noindent\sphinxincludegraphics[width=300\sphinxpxdimen]{{mv_polytopes-1}.pdf}
```
The latter works, the former does not.
