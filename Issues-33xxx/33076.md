```
make distclean
make doc-pdf

also works for me.

```
$ tail logs/pkgs/sagemath_doc_pdf-none.log 

PDF documents have been created in subdirectories of

  /local/sage-git/sage/local/share/doc/sage/pdf/en/reference

Alternatively, you can open

I only have trouble with parallel make of the documentation if I do `make doc-html doc-pdf` in one go. Then yes, there are parallel make issue that are uncovered once it is enabled by #32298. :(

@vbraun

I noticed from [#32759 comment:124](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/32759#comment:124) that you have

```
[sagemath_doc_pdf-none] LaTeX2e <2020-10-01> patch level 4
[sagemath_doc_pdf-none] L3 programming layer <2021-05-07>
```
while I have

```
LaTeX2e <2020-10-01> patch level 4
L3 programming layer <2021-02-18>
```
Is this of significance?
