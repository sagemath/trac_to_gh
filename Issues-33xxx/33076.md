@vbraun

I noticed from [#32759 comment:124](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/32759#comment:124) that you have

```
[sagemath_doc_pdf-none] LaTeX2e <2020-10-01> patch level 4
[sagemath_doc_pdf-none] L3 programming layer <2021-05-07>
```
while I have

```
LaTeX2e <2020-10-01> patch level 4
L3 programming layer <2021-02-18>
```
Is this of significance?
