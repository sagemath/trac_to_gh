```
Failing example:

```sage
K.<u> = GF(23^4)
L.<v> = K.extension(5)
assert L(u).minpoly() == u.minpoly()
```

This is because `K` uses a Conway polynomial, but `L` doesn't, so the following code in `FiniteField.extension()` is wrong (introduced in #24195):

```python
                if self.is_conway(): # and E is Conway
                    alpha = E.gen()**((E.order()-1)//(self.order()-1))
                else:
                    alpha = self.modulus().any_root(E)
                try: # to register a coercion map (embedding of self to E)
                    E.register_coercion(self.hom([alpha], codomain=E, check=False))
```

The mysterious comment "# and E is Conway" tells us exactly what to do to fix the bug.

Perhaps, when I wrote the comment, I assumed `E` is always Conway since Sage chooses a Conway polynomial by default if the input just specifies the size.  

Apparently, I thought wrong at the time or things have changed and the assumption no longer holds...

Looks good to me.
