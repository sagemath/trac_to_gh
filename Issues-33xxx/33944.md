Now that temporary files are created in the `/tmp` folder (after #33797), the following is now broken in 9.7.beta1:

```
sage: from sage.misc.latex_standalone import Standalone
sage: s = Standalone('Hello World')
sage: s.pdf('a.pdf')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
OSError                                   Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-3-61662d74848f> in <module>
----> 1 s.pdf('a.pdf')

~/GitBox/sage/local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sage/misc/latex_standalone.py in pdf(self, filename, view, program)
    729         if filename:
    730             filename = os.path.abspath(filename)
--> 731             os.rename(temp_filename_pdf, filename)
    732             return filename
    733 

OSError: [Errno 18] Invalid cross-device link: '/tmp/tmpwfvogvku/tikz_15rndaqh.pdf' -> '/home/.../a.pdf'
```

This went unnoticed because everywhere in the doctests the files are created in the temporary folder.
