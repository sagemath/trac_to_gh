As reported in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/81unMG60MyU/m/JdMKMFOSBQAJ

Workaround: `export CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -Wno-error=return-type"` (https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/81unMG60MyU/m/TfBT8KOsBQAJ)

This is caused by strict compiler flags leaking from the opensuse python3 package into user packages via sysconfig/distutils. 
Same mechanism as the failures with misconfigured python3 in #31132 (homebrew), #33078 (cygwin), #32531 (pyenv)
