Giac can give wrong answers because it does not know about assumptions that have been made. For example, the following integrals are incorrect, because giac assumes that the variable `c` is real.

```
sage: c = var("c")
sage: assume(c, "complex")
sage: integrate(real_part(c), (x, 0, 1), algorithm="giac")
c
sage: integrate(imag_part(c), (x, 0, 1), algorithm="giac")
0
```
