nbsphinx allows including jupyter notebooks in toctrees. It seems that we cannot include a single cell of a jupyter notebook as a part of our documentation, which I guess is what we want.

I fixed 'Sage binder env' about a month ago:

https://github.com/sagemath/sage-binder-env

It now uses conda to install Sage which is more maintained than
Sage's docker image.

I have no experience with Thebe. Jupyter-sphinx supports Thebe. But running an interact example cell through jupyter-sphinx only shows `Waiting for kernel...`. Is this supposed to take long? Would the interact work well once the kernel is up?

I see.

In Thebe you can configure which kernel should be used;
see the kernel section in:

https://thebe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_reference.html

I assume that this can be done too through Jupyter-sphinx, though
I don't know the details from the top of my head.

<a id='comment:42'></a>As shown by the examples provided by the branch, static images for pdf documentation can either be provided (1) by `sphinx_plot` (this is the status quo), or (2) by prepared png image files saved from live threejs graphics. 

There are pros and cons of both ways. Though both ways may coexist in sage, I think we should choose one of them as a norm, to guide future efforts to improve the documentation.

Pros of (1): It is the current standard; It does not increase the size of the sage distribution.

Pros of (2): It is of better quality; It is consistent with the live threejs renderings.

Cons of (1) is the negative of pros of (2), and vice versa. In particular, a big con of (2) is that it would increase the size of the sage distribution greatly.

So what do you think?

<a id='comment:65'></a>Just tested it. This is very nice!

+1 for a positive review. 

Just for curiosity: why is #33522 a dependency?

something in these two modules wants to call `'/Users/dima/sage/local/bin/sage'` - 
which is absent, naturally, and probably this leads to absent `environment.pickle` in plot3d.

I presume the message "Notebook execution failed" comes from jupyter-sphinx:

With the link it works. It turns out I have outdated things in `~/Library/Jupyter`, in particular `sagemath/kernel.json` with the obsolete path to `sage` (version 9.4.beta3).

Sorry for noise, it's OK.

I don't understand the precise mechanism. But it seems that jupyter-sphinx just runs a new jupyter notebook with sagemath kernel. Then there is nothing to do with the docbuild.

The source of the problem may be in our jupyter kernel configuration in `repl.ipython_kernel.kernel`.

You mean 

```
[sagemath_doc_html-none] [plot3d   ] Notebook execution failed (exception: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/furutaka/work/sage/sage-9.0-git-bld/local/bin/sage')
```
I suppose.

This looks identical to comment:75 - a stale Jupyter kernel somewhere.
