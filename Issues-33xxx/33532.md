After #33473, the doctest for the function `sage.env.sage_include_directories()` will fail when `SAGE_LIB` doesn't include `site-packages`.

This happens in editable installs (`./configure --enable-editable`):

```
$ ./sage -t src/sage/env.py
sage -t --random-seed=48380190928639724450052674778554752620 src/sage/env.py

Likewise in the nonstandard configuration of running sagelib without installing, from `pkgs/sagemath-standard/build`:

```

> I'm not sure if this should be a supported configuration

Why not? It works like a charm. I build sagelib from a git repo, and run from there. No longer do I waste my time with spkgs (everything needed is installed in my system).

This is also how I build sagemath in void linux so that doctest runs at build time (and also CI on github whenever I push an update).

Maybe I should learn how to run sagelib "in place" so that I don't need to rebuild when editing *.py files -- that would be even better. Still the path won't have `site-packages` so the current issue will still happen. For the distro build, using a clean directory for build (and testing the build) seems more robust.

Here's my shell script, in case someone else finds it useful, I call it `sagelib` and place it in the root of the git checkout:

```
#! /bin/sh

set -e

sage_build() {
    # bootstrap sagelib
    ( cd build/pkgs/sagelib && \
        PATH=../../bin:$PATH \
        ./bootstrap )

    ( cd pkgs/sagemath-standard &&
        PYTHONPATH=../sage-setup \
        SAGE_NUM_THREADS=0 \
        python setup.py build )

    SAGE_SCRIPTS=$(cd pkgs/sagemath-standard/build/scripts* && pwd)
    SAGE_LIB=$(cd pkgs/sagemath-standard/build/lib* && pwd)

    # remove sage-venv-config since it clobbers PATH
    rm $SAGE_SCRIPTS/sage-venv-config

    # override pytest as if not installed
    echo "raise ModuleNotFoundError" > $SAGE_LIB/pytest.py

    # create sage_conf.py
    sed '1,/^exit/d' "$0" > $SAGE_LIB/sage_conf.py
}

if [ "$1" = "build" ]; then
    sage_build
    exit
fi

export PATH=$(cd pkgs/sagemath-standard/build/scripts* && pwd):$PATH
export PYTHONPATH=$(cd pkgs/sagemath-standard/build/lib* && pwd)

sage "$@"

exit $?
# configuration for sage on void linux
CONWAY_POLYNOMIALS_DATA_DIR = "/usr/share/sagemath/conway_polynomials"
GRAPHS_DATA_DIR = "/usr/share/sagemath/graphs"
ELLCURVE_DATA_DIR = "/usr/share/sagemath/ellcurves"
POLYTOPE_DATA_DIR = "/usr/share/sagemath/reflexive_polytopes"
COMBINATORIAL_DESIGN_DATA_DIR = "/usr/share/sagemath/combinatorial_designs"
CREMONA_MINI_DATA_DIR = "/usr/share/sagemath/cremona"
CREMONA_LARGE_DATA_DIR = "/usr/share/sagemath/cremona"
GAP_SO = "libgap.so.0"
```

Just run `./sagelib build` to build, and `./sagelib` to run sage. I can successfully run `./sagelib -t --long --all` with this on a clean checkout of `9.6.beta5` except for the current issue and a few more minor doctest failures (mostly deprecation warnings due to newer python packages).

With a primed ccache and 36 cores building this from scratch takes less time than running `./configure` once.

Your static configuration of these variables ("configuration for sage on void linux ") is exactly what I had in mind when I recommended that downstream packagers provide their own version of `sage_conf.py`, 
which would make these settings persistent instead of relying on a script that sets environment variables.

Before today I was appending all of that to `sage/env.py`, and you already recommended to me that I should provide a `sage_conf` package, and that's also what `pkgs/sage-conf/README.rst` kind of suggest. But I completely misunderstood you: I thought it was a chore to have to build a separate package `sage_conf` using what's in `pkgs/sage-conf`. It wasn't until today that I realized it was a simple matter of writing all that stuff to `sage_conf.py`!!! If that's what you meant, it may be a good idea to give it as a suggestion/example.

Thanks for the quick review.
