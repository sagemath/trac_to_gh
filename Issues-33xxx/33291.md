The SAGE icons are located on the left at the top and bottom of the PDF reference documents index webpage. The webpage from the jupyter notebook is

[http://localhost:8888/kernelspecs/sagemath/doc/pdf/en/reference/index.html](http://localhost:8888/kernelspecs/sagemath/doc/pdf/en/reference/index.html)

The icon links point to

```
grep 'en/index.html' local/share/doc/sage/pdf/en/reference/index.html
    <a href="/local/sage-git/sage/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/index.html"><img src="_static/logo_sagemath_black.svg" height="28" style="vertical-align: middle" title="Sage Logo"></a>
    <a href="/local/sage-git/sage/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/index.html"><img src="_static/logo_sagemath_black.svg" height="28" style="vertical-align: middle" title="Sage Logo"></a>
```
which cannot be accessed from the jupyter notebook.

One solution is to use relative links. The following will do this

```

         html_end_preamble = html.find('<h1>Sage Reference')
         html_bottom = html.rfind('</table>') + len('</table>')
```

A disadvantage of this approach in that if the `index.html` file

```
local/share/doc/sage/pdf/en/reference/index.html
```
is accessed directly (locate file in a browser) then the icon links are broken. If accessed through

```
local/share/doc/sage/html/en/pdf/en/reference/index.html
```
then the icon links work. I'm not sure what best practices are in this case. Or if there is some other way to resolve the issue.
