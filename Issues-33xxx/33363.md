This test,

```
sage: m = random_matrix(ZZ, 100, 100, x=-1000, y=1000, density=.1)  
sage: m.parent()                                                    
Full MatrixSpace of 100 by 100 dense matrices over Integer Ring     
sage: H, U = m.hermite_form(algorithm="flint", transformation=True)  # long time
```

usually finishes immediately, often takes a few minutes, and rarely (if you're unlucky) takes ~25 minutes. Unless the `100` is imporant, we should probably decrease the size of this example down to, say, `10`.

I thought this was due to bad luck with the density, but that's not the case, even with `density=1` this test usually completes quickly.
