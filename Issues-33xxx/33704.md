Python's `divmod()` is only supported for `EuclideanDomainElement`s in Sage, whereas `.quo_rem()` is more universal.

It is worth noting that
- some rings implement `.quo_rem()`, `//`, `%` despite not being Euclidean domains (example: `ZZ['x']`); and
- not even all elements of Euclidean domains are instances of `EuclideanDomainElement` (example: `QQ['x']`).
Therefore, `divmod()` will often not work when it should.

This patch moves `.__divmod__()` up from `EuclideanDomainElement` to `RingElement`, which makes `divmod()` work for more rings. Of course, not all rings have division with remainder implemented, but we can simply let that fail in the callee.
