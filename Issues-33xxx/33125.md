`make -n sagelib` should only print, not run, commands.

Likewise `make -q sagelib` should not run commands. As this is used in `build/make/install` with output suppressed, this sometimes leads to `sage -b` silently doing the rebuild and then reporting "Nothing to do".

Broken for normal packages already in Sage 9.0; broken for script packages by #32759 by using `+` in `build/make/Makefile.in` `*-*-no-deps` rules for script packages.

That `+` appears there is motivated by intended jobserver behavior; but unfortunately it also influences `-n`, `-q`, `-t` handling.

Depends on #33130

Isn't this just because invoking `build/make/install` interrupts the `$MAKE` and `$MAKEFLAGS` magic that normally gets applied to sub-*make*s?

For example, this fixes `make -n sagelib` for me:
