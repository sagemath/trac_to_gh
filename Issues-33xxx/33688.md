The TODO section in SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/graphs/spanning_tree.pyx incorrectly asks for a "version of Kruskal's algorithm using priority queues". 

Doing this does not have significant advantages as discussed in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/flB1dxXDmnc and so it is better to remove this line which can be misleading to potential contriburtors.
