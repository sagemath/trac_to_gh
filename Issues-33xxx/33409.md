In recent years the size of our docker images has increased substantially:

```
8.4: 579MB
...
9.0: 705MB
...
9.3: 891MB
9.4: 976MB
9.5: 1.45GB
```

The biggest jump happened with the 9.5 release. The Dockerfile has not really changed in the meantime but something else seems to make that image much bigger than it used to be.

The ticket will not be merged until it is reviewed. What you can do is:
- build Sage 
- run `du -sh SAGE_ROOT/local/`

- run `make micro_release`
- run `du -sh SAGE_ROOT/local/`

- apply this ticket
- run `make micro_release`
- run `du -sh SAGE_ROOT/local/`

and see if each iteration saves some space from the previous one.

Ok, I reinstalled and recompiled this version of sage:

```
$ sage -v
SageMath version 9.7.beta3, Release Date: 2022-06-19
```
The space taken by local is:

```
$ du -sh local
5,8G	local
```

After installing this ticket, I get:

```
$ make micro_release
$ du -sh local
2,4G	local

To summarize,

**9.7.beta3 without this ticket**:

```
$ sage -v
SageMath version 9.7.beta3, Release Date: 2022-06-19
$ du -sh local/
5,8G	local/
$ make micro_release
$ du -sh local/
3,2G	local/
$ du -sh local/var/lib/sage/*
2,2M	local/var/lib/sage/installed
12K	local/var/lib/sage/scripts
2,0G	local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.10.3
```

**9.7.beta3 + #33409**:

```
$ sage -v
SageMath version 9.7.beta3, Release Date: 2022-06-19
$ du -sh local
5,8G	local
$ make micro_release
$ du -sh local
2,4G	local
$ du -sh local/var/lib/sage/*
2,2M	local/var/lib/sage/installed
12K	local/var/lib/sage/scripts
1,2G	local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.10.3
```

Therefore a gain of 800M was done in the size of `local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.10.3` with the current branch.
