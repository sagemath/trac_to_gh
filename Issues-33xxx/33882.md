The following code demonstrates that despite `IntegerLattice` being defined as a module over `ZZ`, its `.component_vector()` method fails to recognize that a given vector is not in `self` and proceeds with representing it as a linear combination with fractional coefficients. 

```
from sage.modules.free_module_integer import IntegerLattice

L = IntegerLattice([2,2,2])
r = vector(ZZ,[1,1,1])

print(r in L)                             # this is False
print(L.coordinate_vector(r,check=True))  # check should fail, and exception should be raised but it's not
```


On a related note, it is unclear how `L.coordinate_vector(r)` behaves when `r` does belong to `L`. I'd expect it to return a vector with integer components, but given the above behavior it seems that it may return a vector with fractional components anyway. It should stick to the base ring, i.e. `ZZ` in this case, or at least have an option to enforce this.
