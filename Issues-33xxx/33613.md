We have a number of pip-installable optional packages, for which there is no conda package.

Here we add a mechanism to add such packages using a `pip: ` line
in `src/environment-optional.yml` and `src/environment-dev.yml` (#33740). 

We also add lots of `conda.txt` files.

To test, follow the instructions in https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/conda.html#using-conda-to-provide-all-dependencies-for-the-sage-library-experimental
using `src/environment-optional.yml` or `src/environment-dev.yml`

(A use case for the pip line in `src/environment-dev.yml` is #34524: Pip package `git_trac_command`.)
