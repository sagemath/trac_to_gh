phitigra was added as an optional package in #30540.

To launch the editor:

```
sage: e = graph_editor()
sage: e.show()             # the editor widget appears
```

To retrieve the graph:

```
sage: G = e.get_graph()   # G is a copy of the drawn graph, both can be modified independently
```

Could you add in the ticket description what should be done to launch the editor.
I tried in a Jupiter notebook and only got:

```
graph_editor()
<phitigra.graph_editor.GraphEditor object at 0x1755ab820>

Yes, I just added it in the description.

It is slightly different than the previous editor: here we define an editor object, that we have to display (with `.show()`) in order to draw the graph with the mouse. The drawn graph can then be retrieved with the `.get_graph()` method of the editor object.

The call to `graph_editor` could directly show the widget, but then I don't know how we would retrieve the drawn graph.

By the way, I am not done with the changes yet, I only pushed the commit so that  I can work on this from a different computer.

Thanks for working on this!  The old graph editor was really a fantastic resource we loved to show off, and a good replacement  would have been useful even last week for me to advertise.

If there is the possibility of demonstrating/documenting a few (even if not possible to be tested) examples in your coming updates, that would also be great.  It is likely that this would be used by people 

Also, if we could see whether this works properly in the Sage cell server before it's released in a final version (beta is fine), that would be good, so I'm cc:ing Andrey N.

Hi,

The repository of the editor widget ( https://github.com/jfraymond/phitigra ) has a demo notebook (`demo.ipynb`) where some of the examples of use are shown.

Currently it is already possible to try the demo notebook after installing the editor package with `sage -pip`.

During a short period of time it was possible to run it on mybinder https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jfraymond/phitigra/master?filepath=demo.ipynb but for some reason (on the mybinder side?) it stopped working.

There are now some live examples of the widget using the recently introduced ".. JUPYTER-EXECUTE::" sphinx directive (this is the reason why I merged the develop branch). I was not able to completely test them, presumably because the version of sage running them (online?) does not include the current ticket yet. If this is a problem I can revert to a previous commit and add the examples in an other ticket.

That's a good question. I just tested and the documentation does not build in this case :(.

If I guessed correctly from what I experienced in this first encounter with sphinx-jupyter
* there is a non-interactive "preview" of the jupyter part generated when building the doc (this clearly requires the package to exist on the computer building the doc)
* then one can click on the "Make live" button and run the code of the cell on some server somewhere in the cloud (for this to work this server as well should have the package)

As it is an optional package I guess the correct choice here is to remove these live examples, right ?
By the way, how should I proceed with the doctests (that also require the package to be installed)? Is there a way to tell sage to skip the tests in a file if the package is not present, of is it better to mark all the examples and tests with `# not tested`? (Tests are being made in the package anyway).

This is a nice addition to sage. Thanks for working on this.

A few comments:

1. The ticket #33320 would make all code blocks in sage docoumentation runnable. This will in effect deprecate using `.. JUPYTER-EXECUTE::` directly. The ticket needs review too.

2. Please respect the developer's guide: https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files. The file `graph_editor.py` is old, and does not follow the guidelines.

You mean the error in building the reference manual. Right. Currently there is no way to avoid that. As you observed, the vanilla jupyter-sphinx run the code block in the build time, needlessly for us.

With #33320, the patched jupyter-sphinx do no run code blocks in the build time. So there should be no problem. But unfortunately as I just checked, because of a bug in #33320, this ticket merged with #33320 still fails. I would work on this.
