I tried the last few versions of Sage (at least on CoCalc, so ubuntu linux), and get_memory_usage returns total nonsense on them.  Maybe it accounts for some huge amount of virtual memory address spaces that Pari allocates (I don't know).

The "smem -ntk" command (which is I think written in Python) does give perfectly useful memory information about the above Sage process:

```
~$ smem -ntk |grep 32967
33075 2001     grep --color=auto 32967            0   424.0K   456.0K     2.3M

```
so this isn't an unsolvable problem.

I'll update this ticket title to include "not broken".

With WSL widely available and cygwin consistently broken, our effective list of supported platforms is

* linux
* macOS
* other BSD
* WSL

With that in mind, what number should `get_memory_usage()` return? I suppose we could have different notions of "memory usage" on different platforms, so long as it's documented.

Even on linux however there are a number of options (see e.g. the `/proc/[pid]/smaps` section in `man proc`), each of which can be misleading in its own special way. Sage now makes use of system libraries that can be shared with other processes, and modern operating systems will do things like deduplication of pages that make accounting a headache.

There's also the question of subprocesses (like pexpect maxima) that would have to be accounted for separately, if at all.

This doesn't have to be perfect, but I think we should have an idea of what it should do this time around.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:6'></a>\nThanks for supporting bring this back, and taking such a systematic approach.  \n\nFor me personally, I can list some reasons that I use get_memory_usage:\n\n- I allocate something that I think should be \"big\", e.g., a list of primes, and want to get a rough estimate of just how big it actually is.  For this, I would call get_memory_usage before and after the allocation, and I only care about the difference.   This is nice because it avoids a lot of the traps you mention above about system libraries, etc.\n\n- I write a little snippet of code and suspect a blatant memory leak of some sort, e.g., possibly due to some implicit caching in the Sage library.  Running get_memory_usage before and after the computation can provide me with a little bit of additional information about my concerns.\n\n- I want to do a memory intensive big computation on my computer with 16GB of RAM.  I do some smaller cases, interpolate data computed using get_memory_usage before and after each run, and decide that yes, this computation will probably fit in 16GB of RAM.   This is much easier than trying to understand how all the underlying code and libraries work and correctly predict RAM usage.   Again, all I need is deltas.   Often linear algebra algorithms that I use (basis for a lot of modular forms computations) are more worrisome in terms of memory requirements than time requirements (unlike combinatorics, say).\n\nIn Sage there is a common contruction:\n\n```\nt = cputime()\n...\ncputime(t)\n```\n\nwhich outputs the elapsed cputime.  Similar for walltime.   We could support and encourage something similar for get_memory_usage, e.g.,\n\n```\nm = get_memory_usage()\n...\nget_memory_usage(m)\n/// prints change in memory\n```\n\nAcknowledgement: I copied this \"cputime(t)\" approach (which gives the delta) from Magma.",

Thanks for supporting bring this back, and taking such a systematic approach.  

For me personally, I can list some reasons that I use get_memory_usage:

- I allocate something that I think should be "big", e.g., a list of primes, and want to get a rough estimate of just how big it actually is.  For this, I would call get_memory_usage before and after the allocation, and I only care about the difference.   This is nice because it avoids a lot of the traps you mention above about system libraries, etc.

- I write a little snippet of code and suspect a blatant memory leak of some sort, e.g., possibly due to some implicit caching in the Sage library.  Running get_memory_usage before and after the computation can provide me with a little bit of additional information about my concerns.

- I want to do a memory intensive big computation on my computer with 16GB of RAM.  I do some smaller cases, interpolate data computed using get_memory_usage before and after each run, and decide that yes, this computation will probably fit in 16GB of RAM.   This is much easier than trying to understand how all the underlying code and libraries work and correctly predict RAM usage.   Again, all I need is deltas.   Often linear algebra algorithms that I use (basis for a lot of modular forms computations) are more worrisome in terms of memory requirements than time requirements (unlike combinatorics, say).

In Sage there is a common contruction:

```
t = cputime()
...
cputime(t)
```

which outputs the elapsed cputime.  Similar for walltime.   We could support and encourage something similar for get_memory_usage, e.g.,

```
m = get_memory_usage()
...
get_memory_usage(m)
/// prints change in memory
```

Acknowledgement: I copied this "cputime(t)" approach (which gives the delta) from Magma.

Suggestion: how about `memory_usage` instead of `get_memory_usage`?

To everyone's satisfaction we use `cputime` and not `get_cputime`.

For what it is worth, the names we currently use were copied (by me) from Magma, which has:

- GetMemoryUsage
- Cputime
- Walltime

I would provide a link, but the Magma website seems down, or at least what google points at is down.

A few thoughts:

- The IPython magic commands `%time` and `%timeit` work well, I think, and at least some uses of `cputime` could be replaced by those. Could we create an analogous magic command that measured the memory usage of a single command?
- Could we instead or in addition implement something to be used in a Python context manager (a "with" block)?

```
with m as memory():
    do some stuff

then return the change in memory at the end
```
