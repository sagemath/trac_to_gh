# Issue 24864: Slow trivial elliptic_F evaluation

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Evaluation of `elliptic_f(asin((-b<sup>(1/3)*(c+d*x)</sup>(1/3)+(b*c-a*d)<sup>(1/3)*(1+sqrt(3)))/(-b</sup>(1/3)*(c+d*x)<sup>(1/3)+(b*c-a*d)</sup>(1/3)*(1-sqrt(3)))),-7+4*sqrt(3))` by Sage takes surprising 9 sec on a fast system, although no computation should be involved (in==out). Reason is the elliptic eval function tries to prove that `asin...` is nonzero. For the general problem and solution see https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/symbolics/nonzero
