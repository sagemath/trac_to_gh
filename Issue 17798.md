# Issue 17798: Handle more text options

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18035

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2015-03-21 20:35:35

As mentioned in [this question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/26274/how-to-fill-rectangle-around-the-text-or-measure-string/) on ask.sagemath.org we shoud allow more options to text. The attached branch adds:

- `fontstyle`
- `fontweight`
- `background_color`
- `bbox`
- `alpha`

See [http://matplotlib.org/users/text_props.html](http://matplotlib.org/users/text_props.html) for the complete list of options.

Looks good to me. I simply corrected a typo in the documentation of function `text` (bad rendering of `horizontal_alignement`).
