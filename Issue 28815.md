CC:  @dimpase @embray @jdemeyer @kiwifb @isuruf

This is part of #21707 - "Split `sage-env` into 5". 

We set up a new `configure`-generated, to-be-`source`d shell script `build/bin/sage-build-env` to which we move environment variable settings from `src/bin/sage-env[-config]` that are only needed for:

1. Sage-the-distribution while building spkgs,
2. Sage-the-distribution for building sagelib.

The new script sources `src/bin/sage-env`.

We add a command `sage --buildsh`, like `sage --sh` but using the larger environment.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29052
