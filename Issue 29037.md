So installation of Sagemath ( app method) is fairly simple, however while the terminal configures it and patches the file, it all seems to be going smooth. The problem arises when you try and start [SageMath](SageMath) and  it initialises the Jupyter notebook, which should start automatically, except it doesn't, citing that the notebook isn't able to communicate with the server. SageNB gives the same error, so I did a bit of scouting on what could be a possible error.
I also read that this issue is persistent in the Catalina iteration of MacOs. The solution finally came by typing the below ( in the terminal of course)

cd /Applications/SageMath-9.0.app/Contents/Resources/sage ( Redirecting to the sage folder)

./sage
(this activates sage in the terminal with the entry message)
and then you
 quit()

Instantly, the Sage application starts to work.

I am guessing this is the issue with the patching in the Mac, which sage isn't able to achieve. The patch werent able to position themselves with the app correctly by themselves, which is why when we did the thing manually, they were finally set

Hello!
A bit of the update from the time I mentioned this issue, sage Jupiter server started giving me the same issue yesterday, and it couldn't be fixed with the way I described previously. I had to give full disk access to [SageMath](SageMath) in my securities tab.

Any comments??

this should mention the exact version of OS. Is it MacOS 10.15.3? 

Also, do you have the same issues with the most basic binary install:
sage-9.0-OSX_10.15.2-x86_64.tar.bz2

Sorry about that, its 10.15.3. I downloaded the tar and the dmg file, however I moved forward with dmg cause it seemed fairly straightforward for the Mac system.
