Hello,

here is a review patch.

It looks good to me and you can set to positive review if you want.

One suggestion : maybe Y-Delta and Delta-Y transformations can be useful to have as general methods ? in another ticket ?

Good for me ! Thank you very much `:-)`

About making those functions public: I only thought they were too specific to be Graph functions... It's not a huge loss even if somebody rewrites them for they are very easy and short, and well... The graph library already contains more useful stuff which is only available in modules, sooooo... `:-)`

by the way, can you name your branch public/something when you modify somebody else's branch ? This way if I have things to change later we don't keep changing the branch name and we can work on the same.
