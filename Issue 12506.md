Not everybody installs Sage in `/opt/sage-5.0.beta8`:

```
sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/doc/common/builder.py
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/jdemeyer/merger/sage-5.0.beta10/devel/sage-main/doc/common/builder.py", line 606:
    sage: builder.ReferenceBuilder("reference").auto_rest_filename("sage.combinat.partition")
Expected:
    '/opt/sage-5.0.beta8/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/sage/combinat/partition.rst'
Got:
    '/scratch/jdemeyer/merger/sage-5.0.beta10/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/sage/combinat/partition.rst'
**********************************************************************
```
