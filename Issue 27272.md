I discovered that part of the problem I've been having with OpenBLAS is that there is a pretty severe memory leak that gets worse any time an application with OpenBLAS loaded in it forks.

**Upstream issue:** https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/2063

I already have a patch that I'll posting a PR for shortly, and would like to include in Sage.  I'm just testing the patch now with Sage.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27509

If we can still have this one last patch applied for 8.7 that would be ideal, as this is a fairly bad issue.  But it only especially becomes an issue when building and running the tests; probably less so in normal usage where running many subprocesses is slightly less common (except for some areas).  I can possibly apply the patch and build openblas manually if absolute need be.
