# Issue 13455: matrix_mod_pn incorrect for extension fields of padics

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13659

Assignee: roed

`matrix_mod_pn()` for elements in Eisenstein extensions of `Zp` suffers from the same inaccuracy as the one described in #13651.

```
sage: R=Zp(3,3)
sage: S.<a>=R[]
sage: L.<a>=R.extension(a^2-3)
sage: L(3).matrix_mod_pn()
[57  0]
[ 0 57]
```


The attached patch fixes this.
