Currently the `SQLDatabase` object in sage has a number of bugs (adding columns to a database when initializing it, keyword parsing for the `SQLQuery.show` method to name a few). There is also some missing functionality (uniqueness of non-index columns, columns of unspecified types). Also, a lot of code can be refactored/removed.

I've attached 2 patches that depend upon #11640. The is a rewrite of these objects, and moves them to `sage.databases.sql_db` and the second makes the necessary changes to `sage.graphs.graph_database`.
