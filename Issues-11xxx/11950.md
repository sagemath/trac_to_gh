There is a bug in topological_sort for digraphs:

```
sage: D = DiGraph('IR??C?G?OOAOGc@??o')
sage: D.topological_sort()
[0, 1, 4, 9, 6, 7, 5, 8, 3, 2, 1]
```
A correct answer is returned from networkx:

```
sage: D.topological_sort(implementation="NetworkX")
[0, 4, 9, 6, 7, 5, 8, 3, 2, 1]
```

I have no problem for installing the patch and for building the documentation.

I did several trials on several randomly generated DAGs, and the results of D.topological_sort() and D.topological_sort(implementation="NetworkX") are the same. 

I give a positive review.

Thank you.
David.
