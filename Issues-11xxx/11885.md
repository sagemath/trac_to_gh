In multiple places in the Sage library the function `sage.libs.mpmath.utils.call` is called and inputs are passed along with their parents. If the parent of the input doesn't have a `prec` method, an `AttributeError` is raised:

```
sage: import sage.libs.mpmath.all as a
sage: z = float(4)
sage: a.call(a.e1, z)
0.00377935240984891
sage: a.call(a.e1, z, parent=parent(z))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/Users/jonesbe/sage/latest/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/libs/mpmath/utils.so in sage.libs.mpmath.utils.call (sage/libs/mpmath/utils.c:5277)()

AttributeError: type object 'float' has no attribute 'prec'
```

This can be fixed with a simple check in in the `call` code in `sage/libs/mpmath/utils.pyx`.

try:

Good point! I made the change and added a doctest to `call()` to illustrate that the bug is fixed.

The change does give a speedup. The best case I found was running

```
sage: timeit('mputils.call(a.ei, 1.0r, parent=float)')
```

Before the old patch, I was getting about 87 micro seconds. With the new patch, the best time I got was about 60 micro seconds.

I'm not sure whether that's a deterministic result.

But Burcin is right, using `try: ...` is (at least) faster *in case `parent` **does** have a `prec()` method*.
