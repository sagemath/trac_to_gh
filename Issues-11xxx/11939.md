The `ulimit -v` argument does not do anything at all (I have not tested other `ulimit` options), neither locally nor remote.  Both commands

```
notebook(ulimit="-v 1")
```
and

```
notebook(server_pool=["jdemeyer@localhost"], ulimit="-v 1")
```
don't seem to put any limit.

I looked at the code couple of months ago and what it does is baffling. It parses all the parameters and then recombines them and tries to call ulimit. No idea why it does so.

In my opinion, setting ulimit should be an argument to `SAGE_ROOT/sage`, i.e., `SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-sage`. Then ulimit should be set by running `ulimit <along with the options passed without parsing them>` and then Sage or the Sage notebook should be launched. Since Sage or Sage nb will be running in the same shell, it will run with the ulimits that were set.

This is not true for remote notebook workers, so we need something more clever.
