<a id='comment:5'>**Comment 5:**</a>
What version of gcc is this failing with? I assume it is not 4.6.0, but can you confirm that? 

This error message reminds me of ones that existed with R and ECL on Solaris. The ECL bug has been fixed, but not the R bug (#9040), so R will not build 64-bit on Solaris x86 with gcc. The R bug is caused by a shared library being built with position dependent code. There are some conditions that can cause non-PIC code to be generated even when the flag -fPIC is given. 

I would check if -fPIC is being passed first. I had a long battle with the Singular developers to get them to accept that -fPIC should be used on Solaris. I think I'd convinced them on Linux too, but never tried on OS X. It could be that there's no -fPIC flag and it just happens this is ok with -O3 but not with -O2. 

Take a look at 

http://blogs.sun.com/rie/entry/my_relocations_don_t_fit

which discusses this issue. It is a Sun blog aimed at Solaris, but the error message seems remarkably similar. Which makes me think this might be a PIC/non-PIC issue.

Time for bed here - it is 0300 local time!!

Dave, it's clear from reading various posts about this problem that it is an Apple-specific issue, so I doubt the Solaris stuff you linked to is relevant.

Hi,

for Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), one should update to the latest OS version (10.4.11), and use the latest XCode version which is supported by OS X 10.4, this is XCode v2.5 (already some years old). It comes with a "build 5370" Apple version of GCC 4.0.1. (Any later XCode versions are not supported for OS X 10.4, AFAIR.)

I'll give Sage-4.7.rc1 a try on both my OS X 10.4 MacIntel and MacPPC boxes, but the latter will literally need days to give results (it's got a 7440 G4 @ 550MHz CPU).

Georg is correct that no version >2.5 is supported on 10.4.  I also only have build 5367/Xcode 2.4.1, but will see if I can track down Xcode 2.5 later - that might not mean immediately.

There were no complaints on other platforms as far as I know.  However, you can consider the situation with gcc 4.0.x a status-quo: it used to be -O3 before rc0, and it is now again -O3.  Since there were no problems with gcc 4.0.x before rc0, I don't think it is a problem to use -O3 with gcc 4.0.x on all platforms.

I think I said somewhere on the rc1 sage-release list that rc0 failed at the same place in PolyBoRi.  I will try to look into that more (the sed thing) when I'm done with classes today, but until then there isn't much I can do with this, except to ./sage -f it into an alpha5 and check that it builds.   

Maybe I could try to ./sage -f the 'bad' one into my alpha5, check it fails, and then ./sage -f this one into my alpha5, check that it builds.  Would that be sufficient?  I think I *do* have the ability to try that.

Success!  Failed with p8, worked with p9.  I'm now waiting on ./sage -b, but don't anticipate any problems if you didn't have any.  I'll revert the positive review if I do come up with any problems, otherwise it's good to go.

Sorry for the delay, just to let you know:

On my MacPPC system, OS X 10.4.11 with XCode 2.5, with an older G4 CPU with 550 MHz and 768 MB RAM, Sage-4.7.rc2 (with singular 3-1-1-4.p9) builds fine! For some (more or less unrelated) details about polybori, see my comments trac #11331.
