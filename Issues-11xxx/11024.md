The patch and spkg installed OK (on 63-bit ubuntu)  and I am now testing.

* The spkg needs a version number, so use the date (e.g. dokchitser-20110325.spkg)
* There needs to be an SPKG.txt file
* The spkg needs to be under mercurial version control (but *not* the src/ subdirectory).
* The spkg-install looks good!

These are trivialities, but necessary!

Hello,

Just to be clear, I have not yet done anything serious for this ticket.

It seems that the current spkg (as given by the link) needs to be updated, because the file computel5.gp.c contains three calls to the function `gtoser` with a wrong number of arguments.
