The second release candidate is out:

 [...] The main changes since this first release candidate are:
 
- Fixed `--enable-gmp-internals`.
- Handle the special cases in `mpfr_cmp_q()` and `mpfr_cmp_f()` (fixing the problem with the `erange` flag in particular).
- Added `mpfr_buildopt_gmpinternals_p()` function.
- MPFR manual update and minor corrections.

 Here's a second release candidate. As there should not be new platform-specific problems, the final release is delayed by a few days only.

This version of MPFI should work with both versions of MPFR.  However, the old version of MPFI will not work with the new version of MPFI.

I haven't tested it on a 32bit OS.  This was primarily just so we could build flint2 in Sage.

I spoke about mpfi because this ticket is marked as depending on #12171 which is upgrading mpfi. My understanding of the dependency field is that it means that you need #12171 for this ticket. This is silly and should be the other way around.

I think comment 9 has not been written with a clear mind. 

I asked about test on 32bit machine because of this [ https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/13].

as a developer of MPFR I strongly recommend to let MPFR choose the same CC and CFLAGS as GMP
(they are read in gmp.h). Since we do this for MPFR, this greatly improved the portability of
MPFR on different platforms with different compilers, in particuler it solves the ABI=32 vs ABI=64
issues.

> Is the patch for Solaris stuff still needed?


I guess yes, since this was a bug in the Solaris kernel.

Replying to [zimmerma](#comment%3A21):
> Maybe I should first import this spkg then that of MPFI?


Since MPFI depends on MPFR (and MPIR), you have to rebuild MPFI after upgrading one of the latter.

If you have enough time (and/or the machine is fast enough), you can copy new/updated spkgs into `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/` and run

```sh
$ env SAGE_UPGRADING=yes make build
```
afterwards.  That way all dependent packages automatically get rebuilt, which can take some time.

(Unfortunately there are also a couple of stupid transitive dependencies; e.g. ATLAS gets rebuilt if you update readline -- just because ATLAS now has an `spkg-install` file written in Python, and Python depends on readline...  So a lot of rebuilds performed by `make` aren't really necessary.)

<a id='comment:29'></a>
the failures are most likely due to the fact that the `mpfr_urandom` and `mpfr_urandomb`
return identical values on processors with different word size in MPFR 3.1.0
(see http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-3.1.0/#changes).

The bad news is that this will need changing the doctests.

The good news is that we won't need any more different doctests on 32-bit and 64-bit
(assuming the MPIR random generator is independent of the word size).

I've begun the test suite. Here are my failures on a Debian amd64 experimental system (on intel core i7) :

```
The following tests failed:

	sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/modular/modsym/ambient.py # 0 doctests failed
	sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/modular/hecke/hecke_operator.py # 0 doctests failed

	sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py # 2 doctests failed

```
I'll have a look at them tomorrow.

Some of them at least are just changes in random output (e. g. real_mpfr and real_mpfi)

```
Maybe because I did not rebuild Pari spkg?

Apart from running sage -b I just forced rebuild of libfplll before the above make ptest (because of lack of time).

I'll properly rebuild everything tomorrow and rerun the testsuite.

My last failures happen in the same files as what you posted some time ago and are always involving some random function.

As you posted later, this should be because MPFR changed its behavior.

I'll post a patch fixing the doctest, but cannot test it on a 32 bits computer (nor exotic architectures), so I'll leave that to someone else.

The question is whether this change of behavior is actually a problem ?

If someone saved old stuff with a given random seed, or something like that, its results will not be reproducible... I do not really feel concerned about that.

If someone could also test the spkg on sunos, solaris, apple or other exotic oses/cpus combinations, that would be more than welcome.

should I rename new packages with the old name? Or keep the new name?
For example Sage 4.8 contains `mpfi-1.3.4-cvs20071125.p9.spkg`. Should I put
`mpfi-1.5.1.spkg` aside this one, or rename it?

For example the last failing test in real_mpfr used to give

With this ticket and dependencies, I get (on all of my 64 systems)

no, I just meant vanilla 4.8. This was just to make sure that potential failing doctests did not fail before this patch.

Now with #12171 all doctests still pass (with one timeout even with `-long`,
for a test taking more than half an hour).

I'll now try with this spkg.

this is expected. If you add the call to `rstate.c_random()` unconditionally,
then on 64-bit systems you will draw 64 extra random bits when the precision mod 64 is between 1 and 32, whereas on 32-bit systems you will draw only 32 extra random bits.

In fact, since version 3.1.0, MPFR leaves the GMP random generator in the same state,
whatever the number of bits per limb. See changeset 7133 from MPFR, and
http://gmplib.org/list-archives/gmp-devel/2010-September/001642.html. Thus the fix is
simply to remove the "gross hack" at lines 930-942 in real_mpfr.pyx.

From what i saw in randstate, c_random calls gmp_urandomb_ui(self.gmp_state, 31).

So this has different behaviors on the gmp rand internal state on 32 and 64 bits ?

I expected that it didn't, so that adding a call to c_random() even on 64 bits (just to see, I don't plan on integrating it to Sage, removing the hack is indeed the right solution) would produce identical behaviors on 32 and 64 bits, whence my request for you to test it (in fact with the hack and without it, not with a call to c_random added, on 32 bits).

I also had little hope that it could revert the real PNRG to its previous behavior for a given seed (in order not to break existing code, outside Sage source tree I mean).

Anyway, if the mpfr code changed, its completely understandable that the random output changes, even with the same seed, so this is hopeless and not really harmful (to me at least).

Anyway, if you confirm that you get the same values that I get (with no call to c_random at all, ie without the hackish section only running on 32 bits currently), I'll post patches to remove the hack section and correct the doctests.

no it shouldn't. But beware that Sage uses MPIR, not GMP. We should check that MPIR
gives the same behaviour for the random state on 32-bit and 64-bit processors.

The files randbui.c where gmp_urandomb_ui is defined are similar in GMP (5.04) and MPIR (2.1.3.p9 in Sage).

They only call _gmp_rand defined in gmp-impl.h which looks quite similar as well (in fact I saw no diff but did not check completely, there could be some black magic somewhere deep enough).

From what I see in integer_ring.pyx and more specifically in the _randomize_mpz function where c_random is called as well, there is no different sections for 32 and 64 bits, nor different doctest in randstate.pyx (only rgp from Pari does change), so I guess it is not that unsafe to assume that MPIR behaves the same for both.

Jean-Pierre,

the test of `real_mpfr` failed with a Segmentation fault on cicero. However I get
the following with the "gross hack" on cicero (32-bit Pentium 4):

The segfault is from 

```
sage: R = RealField(2147483647)
```
because MPFR contains code like

```
        _srcs  = (_srcprec  + GMP_NUMB_BITS-1)/GMP_NUMB_BITS;         
        _dests = (_destprec + GMP_NUMB_BITS-1)/GMP_NUMB_BITS - _srcs; 
```
This gives an int overflow when `prec=INT_MAX`, and soon after as segfault because the buffer sizes are wrong.

-## Changes from versions 3.0.* to version 3.1.0:
-* The MPFR source has been reorganized.
-* Dropped `ansi2knr` support.
-* TLS support is now detected automatically. If TLS is supported, MPFR is built as thread safe by default. To disable TLS explicitly, configure MPFR with `--disable-thread-safe`.
-* New `--enable-gmp-internals` `configure` option to use GMP's undocumented functions (not from the public API). Note that library versioning is not guaranteed to work if this option is used.

-* Much faster formatted output (`mpfr_printf()`, etc.) with `%Rg` and similar.
-* The `--with-gmp-build` `configure` option can now be used when the GMP source directory and the GMP build directory are different (without having to copy header files manually as before).
-* New functions `mpfr_buildopt_tune_case()`, `mpfr_frexp()`, `mpfr_grandom()` and `mpfr_z_sub()`.
-* New division-by-zero exception (flag) and associated functions.
-* The `mpfr.h` header can be included several times, while still supporting optional functions (see Section "Headers and Libraries" in the manual).
-* Updated tuning parameters.
-* Improved MPFR manual.
-* MPFR tests: `libtool` no longer generates wrapper scripts with `make check` (so that running the tests under `valgrind` or `gdb` is easier).
-* Bug fixes.
- Note: The `mpfr_subnormalize()` implementation up to MPFR 3.0.0 did not change the flags. In particular, it did not follow the generic rule concerning the inexact flag (and no special behavior was specified). The case of the underflow flag was more a lack of specification.

As I commented above, the current package needs to be rebased on #12366.

I'm doing it right now. I'll also fix the MPFI package so everything can finally be merged.

I had a look at your patches and have nothing to say :) So once I upload the new spkg, I guess it will be positive_review.

You mean in randstate.pyx? I guess that Pari RNG does not behaves the  same on 32 and 64 bits. The other tests (MPIR, MPFR, GAP, NTL, Python)  looks the same to me, but i might have missed something.

The spkg at the usual address is updated, if someone could test that the patch now applies on Solaris :)

Looks good. I'm happy to give the spkg a positive review. Nothing changed in `mpn_exp.c` except the file location, so I don't foresee any Solaris issues.

I've implemented Paul's suggestion about the precision limit, which was the only reviewer complaint. So I'll take it that everyone agrees with positive review ;-)

Patches apply cleanly against sage-5.0.alpha4 and alpha5.

Here is a review of `trac_11666_spkg.patch`:
there are small typos in `SPKG.txt`, which were already there before:
`coment` should be `comment`,
`occured` should be `occurred`,
`reccommened` should be `recommended`.

Apart from that, the more important would be to test the modified spkg.

If this was already tested by the buildbot, then I will give a positive review.

The current workflow is positive review -> release manage tests beta on build bot. While the authors should of course test patches, you don't have to test it on every supported machine to give a positive review.

We did test it on 32 and 6-bit machines which is the most likely source of errors. Specifics for other systems were not changed so its likely that it'll continue to work. I'll give the spell-checked SPKG.txt my positive review.
