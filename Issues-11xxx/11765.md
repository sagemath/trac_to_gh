```
Currently, `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` is only **set** to Sage's `pkg-config` directory (`$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/pkgconfig/`) if it is empty (or not set at all).

The patch now also prepends Sage's directory otherwise, such that Sage's `.pc` files will be picked up first.

The previous behaviour could obviously break the build if `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` was already set in the "global" environment, i.e. outside the Sage environment.

PKG_CONFIG_PATH is not defined on Gentoo full stop. Prefix or regular. So this may break sage in subtle ways. R-2.10.1 as shipped in sage may break in the build stage because it is not compatible with png-1.5.

I will elevate this to blocker and rebase it ASAP. Jeroen can decide whether it should be shipped in 4.7.2.
