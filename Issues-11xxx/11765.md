Currently, `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` is only **set** to Sage's `pkg-config` directory (`$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/pkgconfig/`) if it is empty (or not set at all).

The patch now also prepends Sage's directory otherwise, such that Sage's `.pc` files will be picked up first.

The previous behaviour could obviously break the build if `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` was already set in the "global" environment, i.e. outside the Sage environment.

I will elevate this to blocker and rebase it ASAP. Jeroen can decide whether it should be shipped in 4.7.2.
