According to private conversation with Francois Bissey, #9976 has introduced a problem that makes it impossible start sage-4.7.1 on Gentoo. That's pretty serious, and so this ticket is a blocker.

The problem is that sage_wraps reads the sources of to-be-wrapped functions and methods. The sources are stored as an attribute to the wrapper, which, on the one hand, is a waste of memory. Worse: Reading the Cython sources is impossible for sage-on-gentoo. Therefore, sage can't start.

My patch introduces some lightweight classes, that simply store a reference to an object (e.g., the to-be-wrapped function) and return the sources or source lines or the argument list *only when called*.

Attachment: **[trac11734_sage_wraps_no_sourceread.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11734/trac11734_sage_wraps_no_sourceread.patch.gz)**

The patch should solve the problem with prematurely reading sources on gentoo. However, I can not test it, myself. Francois, can you verify it?

**__Benefits__**

__Startuptime__

The startuptime did slightly improve (but perhaps that is not significant):

Without patch

```
$ ./sage -startuptime
== Tree ==
sage.all: 1.132 (None)
...
```
With patch

```
$ ./sage -startuptime
== Tree ==
sage.all: 1.045 (None)
```

__Memory__

The memory consumption improved as well:

Without patch:

```
sage: get_memory_usage()
861.2890625
```
With patch:

```
sage: get_memory_usage()
861.234375
```

__Bugfix__

Not reading the sources when a function is wrapped has an additional benefit: If one interactively defines a lambda function and wraps it, then the source is not available. Hence, the following example (that is a new doctest) used to fail:

```
        sage: def square(f):
        ...     @sage_wraps(f)
        ...     def new_f(x):
        ...         return f(x)*f(x)
        ...     return new_f
        ... 
        sage: f = lambda x:x^2
        sage: g = square(f)
        sage: g(3)
        81
```
Without the patch, the last line fails with a mysterious attribute error (the user would certainly have not easily been able to track the problem down).

If I remember correctly, I once tried that approach. The line `argspec = sage_getargspec(wrapped)` was introduced for a reason (something went wrong), but I can't remember what it was.

Did you run full tests with your patch?

> Btw. On my install of sage-4.7.2alpha2 the doctest described in *Bugfix* does not fail.

Really? Strange. It failed for me both with sage-4.7.2.alpha1 and with sage-4.6.2.

The tests in sage/misc pass with your patch, and the example from my post above (the "bugfix") works as well.

If all tests pass, then you patch should be preferred.

It turned out that I am not to blame for the "argspec = sage_getargspec(wrapped)". The first author of #9976 had introduced an alternative approach to provide the argument list when building the documentation -- and I think what we have here is an artefact of that approach.

Since it was about documentation: Could you please build the documentation with your patch (I will only be able to do so tomorrow) and look whether the list of arguments of functions and methods created with `@`sage_wraps are correct in the reference manual? See, for example, the interreduced_basis method of multivariate polynomial ideals.

You mean, it would definitely fix the Gentoo problem?

> I think Simon has not made clear the fact that my original report was about the sage on gentoo distribution.

The ticket description states "introduced a problem that makes it impossible start sage-4.7.1 on Gentoo." I thought that it *is* clear enough.

> It still meant that sage was looking at some cython files before starting up, which can't be good for the startup time. 

Yep. Actually I have tested (by inserting print statements in the functions that read the sources for auto-inspection) that no file is read at startup, with the patch.

Concerning documentation: It looks very nice!

Just for testing, I had inserted a function with a complicated argument list, and put it under the `@`singular_standard_options decorator:

```
@singular_standard_options
def MyTestFunc(bla, blubb, bar={'bla':{1:2}}, foo=None, **kwds):
    """
    This is just a test
    """
    return
```
It is shown in the reference manual exactly as it should.

In addition, the doc tests pass, the startup time seems to slightly improve (perhaps not significantly), and the memory consumption decreases a little.

I hope I understood correctly that it will fix the problem on gentoo.

In general, if a bug is fixed, it should be demonstrated by a new doc test. The example that I gave above *does* fail (at least for me) without the patch. So, I think it should be included. If nobody beats me to it, I'd provide that example in a referee patch.

Also I don't know the real name of saraedum. So, please insert the name in the Author field.

Apart from that, it is a positive review.

There is the "sage -startuptime" script. It prints a lot of data, but the time for importing sage.all is most important, as much as I understood.

Without the patch, I get with sage-4.7.2.alpha2:

```
== Slowest (including children) ==
1.242 sage.all (None)
```
With the patch, I get:
## Slowest (including children)
1.133 sage.all (None)
}}}

However, these times are a little flaky. So, I don't know if we can call it significant if the difference is 10%.

Concerning the additional test: It is a bit strange. It turned out that it *does* fail when I execute it on command line, but it does *not* fail (even without your patch) when it is a doc test. Apparently, in a doc test, Sage is able to find the function definition, which is impossible on the command line.

Btw. I use dumbbench and a *silenced* version of startuptime to make sure that I'm not only seeing random speedups.

The speedup is actually a little bit mysterious. It occurs once you remove a few *sage_wraps* decorators. Apparently python's *inspect.ArgSpec* does something smart once it gets called very often (to speed up things?) which results in a slowdown in our case.

You removed a few sage_wraps for a test? 

Actually I find the speedup not mysterious. The 10% are just with your patch, i.e., I did not additionally remove sage_wraps. And the reason for the speedup is clear: Python's `inspect.getargspec` is insufficient for Sage. It can not deal with Cython functions, and of course it can not understand the special wrappers in Sage:

```
sage: import inspect
sage: cython('cpdef f(a,b,c=None): pass')
sage: inspect.getargspec(f)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    801         func = func.im_func
    802     if not isfunction(func):
--> 803         raise TypeError('arg is not a Python function')
    804     args, varargs, varkw = getargs(func.func_code)
    805     return ArgSpec(args, varargs, varkw, func.func_defaults)

TypeError: arg is not a Python function
```
and similarly

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: I = P*[x,y]
sage: inspect.getargspec(I.interreduced_basis)
ArgSpec(args=[], varargs='args', keywords='kwds', defaults=None)
sage: inspect.getargspec(I.groebner_basis)

    804     args, varargs, varkw = getargs(func.func_code)
    805     return ArgSpec(args, varargs, varkw, func.func_defaults)

TypeError: arg is not a Python function
```
while the Sage autoinspection finds

```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getargspec
sage: sage_getargspec(I.interreduced_basis)
ArgSpec(args=['self'], varargs=None, keywords=None, defaults=None)
sage: sage_getargspec(I.groebner_basis)
ArgSpec(args=['self', 'algorithm', 'deg_bound', 'mult_bound', 'prot'], varargs='args', keywords='kwds', defaults=('', None, None, False))
```

In the most difficult cases, `sage_getargspec` actually needs to read the source (using `sage_getsourcelines`) and analyse the function definition. That's why inspect.getargspec is faster (yet a lot less powerful) than sage.misc.sageinspect.sage_getargspec.

I've attached a `*.proper.patch`, which is identical except that I removed the "garbage" before "`# HG changeset patch`", i.e., I deleted the first line "`exporting patch:`", since Jeroen's current merger rejects such patches.

For now, please make sure all your patches start with "`# HG changeset patch`", i.e., have it on the first line without any preceding messages or whatever.

I've relaxed that in *my version* of the merger, but Jeroen and maybe others are likely to use his more restrictive one.
