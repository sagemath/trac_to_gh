As title. ImageMagick should be called with `-dispose Background`, because when you create an animation, Sage first creates a bunch of frames, then uses ImageMagick to make an animated GIF out of them. If the frames are not all the same size, then ImageMagick determines the minimum size for the final GIF in which it is possible to accommodate all the frames. The default behavior is to simply draw frame `n` over frame `n-1` without erasing frame `n-1`. When frame `n`'s image is smaller than frame `n-1`'s image, however, you get garbage in frame `n` outside the borders of the original image used to create frame `n`.

Before:

After:

![](http://i.imgur.com/DpjS2.gif)

The above image was produced by the following code:

```python
t = var('t')

def frame(theta):
    r = 2
    x = r*(t - sin(t))
    y = r*(1 - cos(t))

    plot = parametric_plot((x, y), (t,0,theta), rgbcolor=hue(0.6))
    krug = circle((2*theta, r), r)
    tocka = point((r*(theta - sin(theta)), r*(1 - cos(theta))), pointsize=30, color='red')
    return plot+krug+tocka;

animacija = animate([frame(x) for x in srange(0.1, 5*pi, 0.1)])

animacija.show(delay=10, iterations=0)
```

(Thanks to user `v-v` on Freenode.)

Credit to user `v-v` on freenode. This produces the image shown above on Sage 4.7 (for example on sagenb.org). My local alpha2 (old, I know...) does something kind of alarming... I'll test with the latest dev version once I get it built.

The "something kind of alarming" appears to be caused by #11170 - the GIF blows up in filesize by a factor of 50 and the aspect ratio is destroyed. I'll cross-post to that ticket...

As for Safari, no idea. I'll look into it.

```python

works too, but the parentheses in the patch force a line continuation.

When this was discussed on sage-devel (please don't ask me to find the thread again), somebody suggested that having a uniform format

```
Trac #54321: change foo to bar
```
could be useful for scripts.  I would find a version of "hg blame" with ticket numbers quite interesting.  If somebody would implement this, then the standard-format ticket numbers would certainly be useful.
