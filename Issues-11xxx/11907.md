All of the versions of the tutorial (en, fr, de, ru) [reference a file](http://sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/programming.html#creating-compiled-code) in the directory `SAGE_ROOT/examples`.  Since this directory is being removed (see #7494), this part of the tutorial needs to be rewritten.  Is the referenced file (`factorial.spyx`) outdated, or is it worth keeping?  If worth keeping, the easiest thing to do would be to move it somewhere else.  Where?

(By the way, if the file is worth keeping, the doctests don't work: they give syntax errors. I don't think you can doctest using the "time" command.  So they should perhaps be marked as `# not tested`.  Also, the "TODO" note seems outdated and should probably be removed.)

How about moving a cleaned-up version to `data/extcode/` if we really need it?

Looks pretty outdated btw.  Do we really need an example *file*, or could we just include parts of it inline into the documentation?

Tagging the `sage: time n = ...` examples "`# not tested`" solves the problem.

("`# random`" wouldn't work, since that *does* execute the code, but `[%]time` is an **I**Python feature.  Feel free to change the doctest framework to run some files with `ipython`, e.g. in case they contain such directives... ;P )

Or instead use `sage: timeit("...") # random runtime`, but that looks ugly for an example, and of course takes longer.
