```
Currently (sage-4.7.2.alpha2) one can not interactively get the source code of the parent or element classes of a category:

```
sage: C.parent_class??
Type:           DynamicMetaclass
Base Class:     <class 'sage.structure.dynamic_class.DynamicMetaclass'>
String Form:    <class 'sage.categories.rings.Rings.parent_class'>
Namespace:      Interactive
File:           /mnt/local/king/SAGE/sage-4.7.2.alpha1/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/categories/rings.py
Source:
class DynamicMetaclass(type):
    """
    A metaclass implementing an appropriate reduce-by-construction method
    """

    def __reduce__(self):
        """
        See sage.structure.dynamic_class.dynamic_class? for non trivial tests.

        TESTS::

...
```

As one can see, it gets the source file right, but can not find the class definition in it.

I tried to track it down.

* For a dynamic metaclass, we want to obtain the documentation and source of the base class (resp. the class that is passed too the dynamic metaclass by the `doccls` argument).
* The module is correctly provided, and thus Python's inspect module is able to find the source file.
* If it is a class then Python's inspect module tries to find something like `"class "+cls.__name__+":"` in the sources (they use a more sophisticated regular expression).
* The base class is `Rings().ParentMethods`. Unfortunately, it is defined by `class ParentMethods`, but the name is differently:

 ```
 sage: Rings().ParentMethods.__name__
 'Rings.ParentMethods'
 ```

I do not suggest to change the name: If the name is just `'ParentMethods'` then Python's inspect module would always find the first occurence of that name, which is bad if one module defines several categories.

Instead, I suggest to create a new function in `sage.misc.sageinspect` that recursively finds the sources for classes whose sources can't be found by other methods and whose name contains a dot:

The function that I plan to write does not start with the whole source file of `sage.categories.rings`, but it starts with the sources of `sage.categories.rings.Rings` and then searches `class ParentMethods` (with the regular expression from the inspect module) only in that small part of the full source file.

I think "getting sources" belongs to the component "misc", even though the problem is  relevant for not getting confused by the category framework. Thus, cc to Nicolas...

The patch works exactly as it is announced in the ticket description. One can now (on top of sage-4.7.2.alpha2) do:

```
sage: C = Rings()
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getsource
sage: print sage_getsource(C.parent_class)  #indirect doctest
class ParentMethods:
    def is_field(self):
        raise NotImplementedError
<BLANKLINE>
    def bracket(self, x, y):
...
```

Unfortunately,

```
sage: P = JackPolynomialsP(QQ); P.rename("JackP")
sage: P.element_class??
```
does not work yet. So, the search for definitions should also include the `__base__` attribute of a class.

I just found one thing that doesn't work, yet.

With

```
sage: C = Rings()
sage: HC = C.hom_category()
```
neither `HC??` nor `edit(HC,'vim')` do what one would wish.

Definitely +1 on the feature! Thanks! 

I had a quick look at the implementation, and it sounds reasonable, though I do not yet have an opinion yet. Any sageinspect expert around?

Hi Florent,

Thank you for pointing to the other ticket! #9107 seems quite mysterious to me. Clearly, in the example exposed there, my way to get to the sources would fail. Of course, the current way would fail even more...

??

According to the comments in the patch, it would *not* solve the problem addressed here:

```
Now sage_getsourcelines works similarly for old and new style classes:

sage: sage_getsourcelines(Sets.ParentMethods)
sage: sage_getsourcelines(Sets.Algebras)

Still both fail, because inspect.getsourcelines (in fact
inspect.findsource) fails on nested classes which have been renamed
with NestedClassMetaclass:
...
```
The point is that both *do* work with my patch:

```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getsourcelines
sage: for x in sage_getsourcelines(Sets.Algebras)[0]:             
....:     print x,
....:     
    class Algebras(AlgebrasCategory):

        def extra_super_categories(self):
            """
            EXAMPLES::

                sage: Sets().Algebras(QQ).extra_super_categories()

I think what I need is:

* A parent class whose metaclass is a sub-class of `NestedClassMetaclass` (such as `UniqueRepresentation`)
* ... so that the `Element` attribute is given as a nested class.

These two properties hold for the `JackPolynomials` example.

What I could do is to create a minimal example in the doc tests. Unfortunately, I need a source file to make it work -- hence, such a doc test needs to use the cython(...) function and hence needs a compiler.

I did create a couple of examples of that type in other patches that got merged, but some people said it is bad practice to have examples that rely on a compiler.

So, what do you think? Shall I use the compiler, or perhaps create a new class in the Sage library just for the purpose of testing?

OK, done, ready for review!

Not that the coverage script complains. But I think the coverage script has a bug, since it reports:

```
simon@linux-sqwp:~/SAGE/debug/sage-5.5.rc0/devel/sage> ../../sage -coverage sage/misc/sageinspect.py
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage/misc/sageinspect.py
ERROR: Please add a `TestSuite(s).run()` doctest.
SCORE sage/misc/sageinspect.py: 60% (26 of 43)

Missing documentation:
         * foo(x, a=')"', b={not (2+1==3):
         * __init__(self):
         * tokeneater(self, type, token, srow_scol, erow_ecol, line):
         * foo(x, a=')"', b={(2+1):
         * foo(x, a='\')"', b={not (2+1==3):
         * dummy' + _grep_first_pair_of_parentheses(source) + ':\n return' try: return _sage_getargspec_from_ast(proxy) except SyntaxError: # To fix trac #10860. See #11913 for more information. return None elif isinstance(obj,functools.partial):
         * test_funct(x,y):
         * create_set_partition_function(letter, k):
         * __cinit__(self):
         * object pyobject(self):
         * __init__(self, ring, gens, coerce=True):
         * test1(a, b=2):
         * test3(b, # 12 a=2):
         * __init__(self, x=None, base=0):
         * test1(a, b=2):
         * test3(b, # 12 a=2):


Missing doctests:
         * _getblock(lines):


Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):
         * dummy' + source[beg:] + '\n return' return tuple(_sage_getargspec_from_ast(proxy)) except Exception: try: # Try to parse just the arguments as a Python argspec. proxy = 'def dummy' + _grep_first_pair_of_parentheses(source) + ':\n return' return tuple(_sage_getargspec_from_ast(proxy)) except Exception: raise ValueError, "Could not parse cython argspec" def sage_getfile(obj):
```

First bug: It expects a `TestSuite.run()` test, but there is no class defined for which this would make sense.

Second bug: The `dummy' + source[beg:] + '\n return' return tuple(_sage_getargspec_from_ast(proxy))...` thingy.

Looks good to me.

The coverage script is going crazy. But the correct fix would be to replace the regex cludge with a python lexer/parser. Definitely material for another ticket...
