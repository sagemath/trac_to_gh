I'd rename the function (as it creates a temporary *directory*), and not use a global variable for the "return value".

The function could either take the variable name as its parameter (such that `sage_make_tmp_dir DIR` assigns the directory name to `DIR`), or just "echo" the result (as `mktemp` already does), such that one writes `DIR=sage_make_tmp_dir` or whatever.

<code>DIR=\`sage_make_tmp_dir\`</code> of course.

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

Here's a version in which the function echoes the path of the temp dir.

This works best with the patch from #11924: without applying the patch there, the parent directory of the temporary .sage directory gets polluted with pickle cache files.

<div id="comment:8" align="right">comment:8</div>

The following seems to be portable:

```
mktemp -d ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/dotsageXXXXXX
```
so I would use this instead of `sage_mktempdir`.

`sage-sage` needs to be replaced by `sage`.

Finally, why not simply run

```
./sage --norc </dev/null >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
```
in `spkg-install`?

Okay, found it.  "sage" refers to the shell function

```
sage() {
    sage_setup
    sage-ipython "$@" -i
}
```
We should probably rename this function to `run_sage` or so...

In the mean time, replace `$SAGE_ROOT/sage "$@"` by

```
command sage "$@"
```

Help of command:

```
command: command [-pVv] command [arg ...]
    Execute a simple command or display information about commands.

    Runs COMMAND with ARGS suppressing  shell function lookup, or display
    information about the specified COMMANDs.  Can be used to invoke commands
    on disk when a function with the same name exists.

    Options:
      -p        use a default value for PATH that is guaranteed to find all of
        the standard utilities
      -v        print a description of COMMAND similar to the `type' builtin
      -V        print a more verbose description of each COMMAND

    Exit Status:
    Returns exit status of COMMAND, or failure if COMMAND is not found.

It would be nice to also have `--nosagerc`, and let `--nodotsage` by default *not* bypass `[$DOT_SAGE/]sagerc` (if it exists; of course no directory should be created if it doesn't).

Unfortunately, this doesn't quite work properly since `DOT_SAGE` is changed *after* reading `sage-env`.  The following variables still refer to `$HOME/.sage`:

```
jdemeyer@arcanis:/usr/local/src/sage-5.0.beta13$ ./sage --nodotsage --sh -c env | fgrep "$HOME/.sage"
MPLCONFIGDIR=/home/jdemeyer/.sage//matplotlib-1.1.0

SAGE_TESTDIR=/home/jdemeyer/.sage//tmp
```

I suggest moving the `--nodotsage` check before the sourcing of `sage-env`.

Just one more issue: now that you don't source `sage-env`, the `command sage` looks for `sage` in the **system** `PATH`.  I suggest to replace

```
command sage "$@"
```
by

```
command "$0" "$@"
```
If you make this change, you can give this ticket positive review.

Furthermore, I would like to point out that `$HOME/.sage/matplotlib-1.1.0` is still created by `sage-env` when building Sage.  But that shouldn't stop this ticket.

For the Sage patch, what about:

except KeyError:
    pass

I don't see a reason to create a directory when the environment variable doesn't exist.
