<a id='comment:8'></a>The following seems to be portable:

```
mktemp -d ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/dotsageXXXXXX
```
so I would use this instead of `sage_mktempdir`.

`sage-sage` needs to be replaced by `sage`.

Finally, why not simply run

```
./sage --norc </dev/null >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
```
in `spkg-install`?

I don't see how calling `sage` could be different from calling `$SAGE_ROOT/sage`, are you sure the former doesn't work (I haven't tried).

<a id='comment:17'></a>Okay, found it.  "sage" refers to the shell function

```
sage() {
    sage_setup
    sage-ipython "$@" -i
}
```
We should probably rename this function to `run_sage` or so...

In the mean time, replace `$SAGE_ROOT/sage "$`@`"` by

```
command sage "$@"
```

Help of command:

```
command: command [-pVv] command [arg ...]
    Execute a simple command or display information about commands.

    Runs COMMAND with ARGS suppressing  shell function lookup, or display
    information about the specified COMMANDs.  Can be used to invoke commands
    on disk when a function with the same name exists.

    Options:
      -p        use a default value for PATH that is guaranteed to find all of
        the standard utilities
      -v        print a description of COMMAND similar to the `type' builtin
      -V        print a more verbose description of each COMMAND

    Exit Status:
    Returns exit status of COMMAND, or failure if COMMAND is not found.
```
