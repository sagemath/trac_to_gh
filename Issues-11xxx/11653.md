When trying to solve a simple ODE whose rhs contains a function, Sage fails to interpret the Maxima output if this contains integration limits.

## A minimal example

```
sage: x=var('x') # independent variable
sage: v=function('v', x) # dependent variable
```
if we now define a custom square pulse function

```python
def pulse(tonset, tdur, amp):
    """
    returns a square pulse as a function of x, f(x) 
    the pulse is defined as follows:  
    t onset -- start of pulse  
    tdur   -- duration of pulse  
    amp    -- amplitude of pulse 
    """

    f(x)= amp*(sign(x-tonset)/2-sign(x-tonset-tdur)/2)
    return f
```
now we create a pulse function

```
sage: mypulse = pulse(tonset=5, tdur=5, amp=2)
```
and define differential equation

```
sage: dvdx = diff(v, x)-x -mypulse == 0 # mypulse(x) is function
```
To get the evolution of v we can use **desolve**

```
myvolt = desolve(de=dvdx, ivar=x, dvar=v, ics=[0,0])
```
The error message is:

```python
TypeError: 
unable to make sense of Maxima expression 
'v(x)=-(2*(at(integrate(signum(x-5)-signum(x-13),x),[x=0,v(x)=0]))-2*int\egrate(signum(x-5)-signum(x-13),x)-x^2)/2' 
in Sage
```

desolve_laplace leads to similar error:

```
sage: desolve(de=dvdx, ivar=x, dvar=v, ics=[0,0])
```

```python
TypeError: 
unable to make sense of Maxima expression 
'ilt(((laplace(signum(x-5),x,?g2733)-laplace(signum(x-13),x,?g2733)+v(0)\ )*?g2733^2+1)/?g2733^3,?g2733,x)' 
in Sage
```

According to Nils Bruin, the problem is that Maxima 'at' function. As described in Ticket #385, this can be a problem with the implementation of 'at' for SR.

## Expressions that work
And adding the **sign** function to the differential function does not affect the solution.

```
sage: dvdx = diff(v, x)-v -sign(x) == 0 
sage: desolve(de=dvdx, ivar=x, dvar=v) 
sage: (c + integrate(e^(-x)*sgn(x), x))*e^x
```

However, adding initial conditions produces an output that Sage is not able to evaluate

```
sage: desolve(de = dvdx, ivar=x, dvar=v, ics=[0,0])
```

The output is:

```python
TypeError: 
unable to make sense of Maxima expression 
'v(x)=e^x*integrate(e^-x*signum(x),x)-e^x*(at(integrate(e^-x*signum(x),x),[x=0,v(x)=0]))'
 in Sage

```

I guess Sage is not able to interpret the integrations limits prompted by Maxima (e.g [t=0,v(t)=0]).

+TypeError: unable to make sense of Maxima expression 'v(x)=e^x*integrate(e^-x*signum(x),x)-e^x*(at(integrate(e^-x*signum(x),x),[x=0,v(x)=0]))' in Sage
+
+```
+
+I guess Sage is not able to interpret the integrations limits prompted by Maxima (e.g [t=0,v(t)=0]).
