I'll have to wait until the sage server are fully back on, m4ri tarball seem to be stored there. That or I clone m4ri tip from bitbucket, which may be an idea since I already to that for polybori.

No effects from that change BUT I was passing

```
SHLINKFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} -dynamiclib"
```
to scons which suppressed the flags you set. From the look of things I think it should be good now on OS X. If you had the flag appended instead of just set it may have worked earlier, not sure how you are supposed to do that in scons....

I've added now a (cumulative) patch:
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11575/polybori-0.8.0alpha.p3.patch.gz
It includes both previous ones as well as the treatment of c++ classes, that so not have a default constructor. (The latter should better to be handled by cython directly, so I'll report that issue there.)

The spkg was also updated (dummy default constructors dropped):
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/polybori-0.8-alpha.p3.spkg

The sources are in sync with the original repository now. If this version is fine for everybody, I'll bundle the first release candidate for polybori 0.8 soon.

Note, that there are some todos due (see above).

PS: I'm taking ownership of this ticket again.

Meanwhile, we bundled PolyBoRi 0.8-rc1 upstream.

Here is also the updated spkg:
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/polybori-0.8-rc.p0.spkg
and the Sage patch for interfacing with PolyBoRi 0.8-rc1:
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11575/polybori-0.8-rc.p0.patch.gz

I rebased on the most recent version of the spkg from #11261 (still not official).

OK I pulled the trunk again with my ebuild and after a few changes to accommodate for your last commit (lib/lib64 issue not really essential for sage as far as I can see) it installed fine on linux-amd64.

Trying on OS X (10.5.8) turned something interesting which may explain some of the difficulties with dynamic linking on OS X.

```

I am guessing the culprit line is this one

Because you already have "-Llibpolybori" you shouldn't need "libpolybori/libpolybori.dylib" you should just plain link with "-lpolybori".

Look at this document:
[http://blog.onesadcookie.com/2008/01/installname-magic.html](http://blog.onesadcookie.com/2008/01/installname-magic.html)
The solution adopted in portage in a OS X prefix is to make the install_name absolute which is why at the moment a sage-prefix on OS X is not relocatable. Now what the QA tool of portage is telling us is that libpolybori_groebner.dylib is linked to libpolybori/libpolybori.dylib as in the library contains the name and the path of the library. And we of course don't want that.

Try the following command:

```
otool -L libpolybori_groebner.dylib
```
The result here is as follow:

```
otool -L libpolybori_groebner.dylib 
libpolybori_groebner.dylib:

you can notice libpolybori/libpolybori.dylib on its lonesome.

I manager to install gentoo-prefix on an old ppc to debug things further.
The most current polybori builds nicely on that prefix, but I can now reproduce issue mentioned here: https://bitbucket.org/brickenstein/polybori/issue/1/non-aligned-pointer-being-freed-on-os-x when using wither ipbori or  invoking ipython with the following manual commands:
Python 2.7.2 (default, Aug 22 2011, 13:36:51)

Invoking plain python doesn't cause any trouble:

```
Python 2.7.2 (default, Aug 22 2011, 13:36:51)

>>> import sys

>>> from polybori.frontend import *
>>> x(1)*x(1)
x(1)
```

So maybe an ipython issue?

I am getting a bus error with ipython and the latest trunk (with some manual massaging to get what looks like correct libraries) and no error with pure python that's indeed very strange. The backtrace I put on bitbucket was pointing to polybori but there may be more to it.

Looking back in this thread what happened to -Wl,-undefined -Wl,dynamic_lookup for OS X? I suspect that would do the trick we are after. I looked at what libtool does in the case of m4ri:

```
gcc -dynamiclib -Wl,-undefined -Wl,dynamic_lookup -o .libs/libm4ri-0.0.20100701.dylib  .libs/brilliantrussian.o .libs/misc.o .libs/packedmatrix.o .libs/grayflex.o .libs/strassen.o .libs/permutation.o .libs/trsm.o .libs/pls.o .libs/solve.o .libs/pls_mmpf.o .libs/echelonform.o    -mmmx -msse -msse2 -msse3   -install_name  /Users/frb15/Desktop/sage-4.7.1/local/lib/libm4ri-0.0.20100701.dylib  -Wl,-single_module
```
This is from a vanilla (ie not gentoo based) build log. I detect relocation problems on OS X.

You mean site-package/polybori/dynamic/Pypolibori.{so,bundle}, I believe bundle is for frameworks in OS X, sage doesn't build python as a framework I believe (unless the build system default to it). 

In any case I don't think so. 

One would think that -flat_namespace and -undefined dynamic_lookup are equivalent but may be they aren't.

Alexander, could you also include (at least) the following:

```diff

diff --git a/patches/SConstruct b/patches/SConstruct
--- a/patches/SConstruct
+++ b/patches/SConstruct
@@ -545,6 +545,8 @@
     env.Append(CPPDEFINES=["BSD"])
 
 env.Append(LIBPATH=[CuddPath()])
+if os.environ.has_key("LD_LIBRARY_PATH"):
+    env.Append(LIBPATH=os.environ["LD_LIBRARY_PATH"].split(os.pathsep))
 
 cudd_resources = glob(CuddPath('util/*.c'))
 
```

Otherwise the build breaks with "non-standard" compiler setups since PolyBoRi (or `SConstruct`) invalidates any setting of (e.g.) `LDFLAGS`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `LIBRARY_PATH`, i.e., removes them from the environment.

The diff is against PolyBoRi 0.7.1.p6.

LD_LIBRARY_PATH is exported to the SCons-enviroment and it works for me. I'll check whether something has hanged in recent SCons versions.

The PolyBoRi spkg currently uses the following environment variables:
`CC CXX SAGESOFLAGS PYTHONHOME SAGE_LOCAL`

It would be a two liner to support more. Here's what I frequently use:
`CFLAGS CXXFLAGS CPPFLAGS LDFLAGS` 
Do we need more?

*Adding* the latter list to the former should be sufficient. Maybe also add `LD_RUN_PATH`, which is used only if no `-rpath` parameters are present when linking, and (in general) perhaps `ABI` and `CPP` itself.

Other platforms (i.e., operating systems) use different flavours of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` etc. though, but I don't care much atm... ;-)

But it's a good point anyway. As far as I understand gcc's manual it should be enough to import `LIBRARY_PATH` into the build environment to avoid your work around.

[In principle belongs to #11906:]

IIRC that didn't help, because *the linker* doesn't use `LIBRARY_PATH` but `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

The problem was that it couldn't find [an appropriate] `libgcc[_s]`; all other paths are compiled into GCC (which used to be in `specs`). So `LDFLAGS` would also have helped (if they were used in the link commands).

A work-around is to create symbolic links (in directories where they do not really belong), but since PolyBoRi is the only package that shows this behaviour (or error), I fixed the spkg rather than doing that, which I'd also have to do for a couple of different GCC installations.

`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` should be used for runtime search, not at link time. 

Even though `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` may be effective at link time as (unwanted?) side effect, I think the missing LDFLAGS caused your problems. (Since `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` had been imported before.)

Ok, replacing `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` with `LIBRARY_PATH` in my patch above (and setting that to a path along which `libgcc*` can be found) also works.

But I also noticed other things (when doing `./sage -f ...`):

```
...
Checking for C header file gd.h... yes
Checking for C library gd... no
...
Checking for C library m4ri... no
Checking for C header file gd.h... yes
Checking for C library gd... no
Symlinking to M4RI/m4ri ...
...
```
(Haven't tracked that further down, but it's strange, provided `$SAGE_LOCAL/[lib/]` **is** used there, since both libraries are present.)




Also, `spkg-install` (I think) shouldn't delete previous versions until the build succeeded.

Try to use the (inlined) patch from #11906. It directly reconstructs the original environment. Even though it will not utilize LDFLAGS yet.

Also `ld` uses it, to look up libraries others depend on; `libstdc++` has `libgcc_s` in its `DT_NEEDED` tags.

If PolyBoRi itself would (directly) need it, its path would have to be in either `LDFLAGS` or `LIBRARY_PATH`.

Are you sure? Does your setup really work without invoking `make`?

I mean, does plain

```
g++ -o helloworld helloworld.cc
```
succeed for a C++ helloworld.cc like the following?

```
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;

I just realized that you work around is active *after* configuring. So trying to link against gd and m4ri fails, becuase the compiler is still broken at that point.

You may add your work around to `patches/custom.py` (which is executed earlier) as follows:

```
if os.environ.has_key("LD_LIBRARY_PATH"): 
  LIBPATH += os.environ["LD_LIBRARY_PATH"].split(os.pathsep)
```

Since (I now remember that) `g++` *always* adds `-lgcc_s` (also `gcc` when called with `-x c++`), even

```
$ echo "int main(void){return 0;}" > foo.c
$ g++ -x c++ foo.c -o foo
```
requires `libgcc_s.so` to be found, e.g. by setting `LIBRARY_PATH` (unless one uses `-static-libgcc`, since that's located in other directories).

(I have to set *`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`* anyway, such that the runtime linker finds `libgmp` etc., which are used by `gcc` and `g++`.  But that's not sufficient to compile an executable like the above as C++.  So apparently PolyBoRi, or SConstruct, doesn't really invalidate `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` -- otherwise the compiler wouldn't have worked at all -- but `LIBRARY_PATH`, and with my current settings it doesn't matter whether I put the former or the latter into SCons's `LIBPATH`, since *both* contain the directory where `libgcc_s` lives.  IIRC I first tried adding things to where the "`getenv`" dictionary is set up, which didn't work, but I don't recall exactly.)

Well, that's funny:

```

  |

/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgcc_s

```

It's not immediately clear what triggers `libgcc_s` to apparently get pulled in there, since `libgd` doesn't need it (according to `ldd`), and it's plain C, compiled with `gcc` rather than `g++`.

FWIW, *both* adding

```
(`LIBRARY_PATH`, not `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`) in `patches/custom.py` as well as changing `patches/SConstruct` to

```python

# todo: Are these settings sane in any case?
getenv = dict()

for key in ['PATH', 'HOME', 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH', 'LIBRARY_PATH'] :
    try:
        getenv[key] = os.environ[key]
    except KeyError:
        pass
```
*independently* work for me, i.e., in both cases the build succeeds, and the GD and M4RI libraries are found by "Configure".




Btw., it would be safer (and save a little space) to remove the M4RI source tree from the PolyBoRi *spkg*.

Good idea!

Something seems to have gone wrong with the rebased patch:

I
* took a fresh 4.7.2, 
* installed polybori-0.8.0.p1.spkg and
* applied [attachment:polybori-0.8.0.p1.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11575/polybori-0.8.0.p1.patch)

This gave me a few hunks and one conflict in PolynomialConstruct which I fixed. While it now compiles I get these failures:

```
File "/opt/sage-4.7.2-polybori-0.8/devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx", line 3859:

    Traceback (most recent call last):

    AttributeError: ('sage.rings.polynomial.pbori.BooleanPolynomialRing' object has no attribute '_element_constructor_', <built-in function unpickle_BooleanPolynomial0>, (Boolean PolynomialRing in a, b, c, d, ([[2], [{{a}, {b}}, {{b}}]], Boolean PolynomialRing in a, b, c, d)))

```

So something went wrong and Alexander's element_constructor fixes didn't make it into this patch?
