```
sage: K = pAdicField(11, 5)
sage: x = polygen(K)
sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(x^5 + 1)
sage: C.weierstrass_points?
...
       in the suport of the divisor of $y$
```
Here, `suport` should be `support`.

Sorry, Paul, I have to, since the patch to be applied is not mentioned in the ticket's description, which is good practice, and also necessary for at least some bots or release tools which partially automate the process. (In case there are multiple patches which have to be applied, they should be listed in the order in which they have to be applied.)

---

To potentially new contributors / Sage developers:

It isn't bad to choose filenames that at least partially reflect what a patch does, or to which component / defect etc. it belongs; also, using the comment field of attachments isn't bad, e.g. to note to which repository a patch has to be applied, which version of Sage it was based on, and maybe also *there* what a patch does, etc.

As Paul *did*, the filenames of patches should start with `trac_<ticket number>` (or, less often used, `trac<ticket number>`), and the commit message should contain (best start with) the ticket number on its *first* line, e.g. `#11798 ...` or `Trac 11798: ...` or the like.

P.S.: Some might consider this redundant (at least in cases where there's only one patch, and which has to be applied to the "default" repository, i.e., the one of the Sage libary), but a little redundancy is good to avoid errors when automating things.

If there are multiple patches attached to a ticket, listing them (or just the single proper one to be applied) in the correct order in the ticket's description is IMHO mandatory, since humans would also like to immediately have this information (as opposed to reading and reasoning about potentially many comments on the ticket).

Also, the URLs of new / updated spkgs provided by a ticket should always be part of the ticket's description.
