MPIR fails to build on **32-bit** operating systems running on **64-bit** processors if `CFLAGS` contain `-m32` and `ABI` is **not** set.

The simple solution is to set `ABI=32` in this case, which the new spkg now does (on Linux, where the issue occurred). It also sets `ABI=64` if the operating system supports it, and `ABI` isn't already set, and prints according messages.

Would be nice if one of you could review this.

For testing, it should be sufficient to (try to) install the spkg with an arbitrary Sage version (of course installed on some 32-bit Linux running on a 64-bit processor):

```sh
$ unset ABI # We want to test that the spkg works *without* setting it.
$ env SAGE_CHECK=yes ./sage -i http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/mpir-2.1.3.p5.spkg
```

After that, you should reinstall the original MPIR spkg from your Sage installation (with `./sage -f spkg/standard/mpir-<version>.spkg`) in case you used a Sage version prior to Sage 4.7.2.alpha3 (into which the MPIR 2.1.3.p4 spkg from #8664, the first 2.x version in Sage, was merged).

(No need to uninstall it from Sage 4.7.2.alpha3 or if you happen to have already installed the MPIR 2.1.3.p4 spkg, the GMP-ECM 6.3.p2 spkg and the necessary patches from their tickets.)

You can of course in addition test the spkg on other (64-bit) platforms as well... :-)

Thanks!

Oh, one more thing:

I cannot test whether the GMP-ECM and MPFR spkgs have the same problem (since they use GMP's / MPIR's `CFLAGS`), i.e., also fail on such systems if `ABI` isn't set.

If you find the time, you could also check this by unsetting `ABI` and reinstalling them (with `./sage -f ...`).

The new mpir spkg installs here on my 32-bit OS with 64-bit processor with ABI unset.

```
The MPIR test suite passed successfully.
Now cleaning up tmp files.
Making Sage/Python scripts relocatable...
Making script relocatable
Finished installing mpir-2.1.3.p5.spkg
```
It also installed on an amd64 to which I have access. The ECM and MPFR spkgs reinstalled correctly with ABI unset on both the 32-bit and amd64 machines. A positive review here.

I'd factor out `-m32` though, i.e., use `$CFLAG32` in the second attempt and add

```sh
if [[ -z $CFLAG32 ]]; then
    CFLAG32=-m32
fi
```
or

```sh
: ${CFLAG32=-m32} # doesn't invalidate an empty setting ("")
```
or the like (at the top level), such that porting people can adapt it to whatever they need.

**Positive review**, although the comment

referred to *building*, not *running* a 64-bit executable, and the Changelog entry mentions `-m32` and `-m64` rather than `CFLAG32` and `CFLAG64`.

I think it is actually **more** correct to refer to *building and running* rather than just *building*.

> the Changelog entry mentions `-m32` and `-m64` rather than `CFLAG32` and `CFLAG64`.

Fixed this.

For what it's worth, this fails to build on the skynet machine silius. I get the same error message with p5 and p6:

```

  CFLAGS:

Ooops, I was pretty sure I also tested it there.  The p4 builds just fine.

I'll prepare a follow-up spkg...
