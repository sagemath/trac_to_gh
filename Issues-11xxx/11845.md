Since sage pickles are supposed to be highly portable, we should probably not enable the feature by default, but the feature can be extremely useful when, for instance, distributing jobs across multiple worker nodes.

Some work is needed to work properly with closures, so having a debugged and well-maintained interface for pickling python functions is desirable. I have no idea whether it would be appropriate to stuff somewhere in the sage library, so for now this ticket can serve as a repository.
