We propose implementing a `period` method for quadratic irrational elements of the field of continued fractions. 

See the post at [http://ask.sagemath.org/question/545/continued-fraction-expansion-of-quadratic](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/545/continued-fraction-expansion-of-quadratic) for an algorithm.

Depends on #14567

**Assignee:** @loefflerd

**CC:**  @kcrisman

**Keywords:** continued fraction, arithmetic

**Reviewer:** Benjamin Jones, Vincent Delecroix

Well, an algorithm isn't a patch :)  but this is a promising start.  

**However**, one would want to make sure there was a way to check whether this was actually a quadratic surd before using this method.  I think that the poster's comment about the [Maple documentation](http://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/Maple/view.aspx?path=numtheory/cfrac) for this could provide some helpful thoughts, though I don't think we'd want to slavishly follow the syntax or anything, especially as we have the field of continued fractions to help us out.

One more random thought; is it possible to hack out the code from GAP for this in some way, so as not to reinvent the wheel?

I intend to provide a patch, I just thought I'd get the ball rolling. Maybe I should have waited to file the ticket, though. I'll be on vacation until June 6.

I'm not familiar with the term "surd", but I guess that means an algebraic number, or maybe just an n-th root?

No, always file a ticket - then others know about it, and so forth.  Many, many, *many* tickets are filed that don't have patches for a long time, but do have ideas.

[See here](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/QuadraticSurd.html), for example. It's an old term for (quadratic) irrationals, more or less.  You see it a lot in books written before about 1960, esp. number theory ones.

Hi,

This is a long standing ticket and I guess nobody is working on it anymore. I will close it as a duplicate as soon as #14567 is finished. Any comment or contribution welcome!
