Well, an algorithm isn't a patch :)  but this is a promising start.  

**However**, one would want to make sure there was a way to check whether this was actually a quadratic surd before using this method.

One more random thought; is it possible to hack out the code from GAP for this in some way, so as not to reinvent the wheel?

I intend to provide a patch, I just thought I'd get the ball rolling. Maybe I should have waited to file the ticket, though. I'll be on vacation until June 6.

I'm not familiar with the term "surd", but I guess that means an algebraic number, or maybe just an n-th root?

No, always file a ticket - then others know about it, and so forth.  Many, many, *many* tickets are filed that don't have patches for a long time, but do have ideas.

[See here](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/QuadraticSurd.html), for example. It's an old term for (quadratic) irrationals, more or less.  You see it a lot in books written before about 1960, esp. number theory ones.

Hi,

This is a long standing ticket and I guess nobody is working on it anymore. I will close it as a duplicate as soon as #14567 is finished. Any comment or contribution welcome!
