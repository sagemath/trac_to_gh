```
The one who was aiming at the *Useless Use of `cat` Award* ![1] unfortunately did some wrong escaping, so we currently get for example:

```sh
$ ./sage --version
| Sage Version 4.7.2.alpha3-pre7-without-examples, Release Date: 2011-09-28 |
* Warning: this is a prerelease version, and it may be unstable.     *
```

Also, I don't think the second line should be printed, hence the new version also case-sensitively "greps" for `Version`, such that we get:

```sh
$ ./sage --version
Sage Version 4.7.2.alpha3-pre7-without-examples, Release Date: 2011-09-28
```

I disagree with makeing here the change

```
if [ "$1" = '-v' -o "$1" = '-version' -o "$1" = '--version' ]; then 
```
to

```
case "$1" in
    -v|-version|--version)
```

I don't disagree with the change itself, just with the fact that
1. you do it on this ticket
2. only for this command line option

If you want to make this change, please do it on a *different* ticket and then for *all* command-line options.

I don't have a strong feeling about this, but I think your criticism would be more valid if the script sage-sage were a model of consistency and good style; then altering the style of one part would be a bad idea.  But I don't think it is such a model.

> If you want to make this change, please do it on a different ticket and then for all command-line options.

I think that we should work on #21 (using a real argument parser and starting to enforce double-hyphens for long options).  That ticket needs a lot of work — I'm not sure I like my original approach there, so I may try to rewrite it some day — but rather than patching style issues in sage-sage, it would be better to put the effort elsewhere.
