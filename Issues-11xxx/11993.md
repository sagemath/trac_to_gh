The one who was aiming at the *Useless Use of `cat` Award* ![1] unfortunately did some wrong escaping, so we currently get for example:

```sh
$ ./sage --version
* Warning: this is a prerelease version, and it may be unstable.     *
```
| Sage Version 4.7.2.alpha3-pre7-without-examples, Release Date: 2011-09-28 |
Also, I don't think the second line should be printed, hence the new version also case-sensitively "greps" for `Version`, such that we get:

```sh
$ ./sage --version
Sage Version 4.7.2.alpha3-pre7-without-examples, Release Date: 2011-09-28
```

I don't have a strong feeling about this, but I think your criticism would be more valid if the script sage-sage were a model of consistency and good style; then altering the style of one part would be a bad idea.  But I don't think it is such a model.

> If you want to make this change, please do it on a different ticket and then for all command-line options.


I think that we should work on #21 (using a real argument parser and starting to enforce double-hyphens for long options).  That ticket needs a lot of work — I'm not sure I like my original approach there, so I may try to rewrite it some day — but rather than patching style issues in sage-sage, it would be better to put the effort elsewhere.

Actually, I do think it has a consistent bad style.

At least let's not make it less consistent.

Here is a v2 patch, changing only the command itself, not the option parsing.
