```
The following test from `sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py` (introduced by #10334) sometimes gives different output, see #11427:

```
sage: G = PermutationGroup([(1,2,3), (2,3)]) 
sage: H = PermutationGroup([(1,2,4), (1,4)]) 
sage: G.isomorphism_to(H)
Permutation group morphism: 
  From: Permutation Group with generators [(2,3), (1,2,3)] 
  To:   Permutation Group with generators [(1,2,4), (1,4)] 
  Defn: [(2,3), (1,2,3)] -> [(2,4), (1,2,4)] 
```

In this ticket, I simply allow random output for the right hand side of `Defn:`.

Why does it include the doctest twice?  I think the following would be better:

```

sage: G = PermutationGroup([(1,2,3), (2,3)]) 
sage: H = PermutationGroup([(1,2,4), (1,4)]) 
sage: phi = G.isomorphism_to(H); phi

sage: phi(G).is_isomorphic(H)

Indeed we have a first test marked random followed by the same test with less randomness. I would be OK with just the second test as well since only the part in "..." varies depending on what's installed.
