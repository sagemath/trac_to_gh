The patch adds a new support class in `list_clone.pyx` for lists with a normalization methods. The normalization method is called both after creation and clone/modification. This will be needed for rooted trees.

I also take the opportunity of cleaning up the bad usage of `assert` in
the examples and replaced them by `if ... : raise ValueError`.

<a id='comment:8'></a>Hello Florent,

I rebased the patch on 5.8 but then sage fails to compile with the following messages.

```
sage/structure/list_clone.pyx:1826:10: Overriding final methods is not allowed

sage/structure/list_clone.pyx:1826:10: Only final types can have final Python (def/cpdef) methods
```

It seems that the problem is with the `__exit__` method.
