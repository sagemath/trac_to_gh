The new PolyBoRi spkg (#10797) and the new cython spkg (#10493) add the files `PolyGUI` and `cygdb` to SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/.  The attached patch adds those files to the .hgignore file.

I'm marking this as a blocker because we should distribute a clean repo when we release Sage, but it should be pretty easy to review...

<a id='comment:2'></a>
Works fine. Before the patch:

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.7.alpha3/local/bin$ hg status
? PolyGUI
? cygdb
```

but the patch corrects it.
