Applies fine t. 4.7.alpha4 and all tests pass.  But I am a little concerned that with the patch, a log file is created whether or not the user wants one.  This differs from the standard pexpect convention that a log file may be requested but is not created by default.

Would it work to move the logfile parameter to the init function, with default None, and have that function start up the interpreter?

Let me just point out that `gp` (from PARI/GP) always logs by default (but this might be a bad thing too).

Not sure, because the Dokchitser stuff is often initialized indirectly.

I could live with the following:

```
logfile = None
# For debugging
#logfile = os.path.join(DOT_SAGE, 'dokchitser.log')
g = sage.interfaces.gp.Gp(script_subdirectory='dokchitser', logfile=logfile)
```

I had not noticed that gp always produces a logfile!  I would vote to remove that and make it optional.

I prefer your "debugging" option.  This may well need revisiting after we have put in the new-style Dokchitser interface as worked on by Henri Cohen and me and Martin Raum recently -- I ost track of where that got to.

The best solution would be to have some kind of global "logging" option, similar to the "proof" option that we have currently in Sage.  However, this is certainly a more complex solution and not high on my priority list.
