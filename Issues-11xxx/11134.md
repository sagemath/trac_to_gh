Would it work to move the logfile parameter to the init function, with default None, and have that function start up the interpreter?

Let me just point out that `gp` (from PARI/GP) always logs by default (but this might be a bad thing too).

Not sure, because the Dokchitser stuff is often initialized indirectly.

I could live with the following:

```
logfile = None
# For debugging
#logfile = os.path.join(DOT_SAGE, 'dokchitser.log')
g = sage.interfaces.gp.Gp(script_subdirectory='dokchitser', logfile=logfile)
```

I prefer your "debugging" option.  This may well need revisiting after we have put in the new-style Dokchitser interface as worked on by Henri Cohen and me and Martin Raum recently -- I ost track of where that got to.
