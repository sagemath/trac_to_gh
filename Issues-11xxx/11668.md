```
sage: version()
'Sage Version 4.7, Release Date: 2011-05-23'
sage: var('a b', domain='real');
sage: A = abs((a+i*b))^2
sage: A
abs(a + I*b)^2
sage: imag(A)
0
sage: A.simplify_full()
a^2 + 2*I*a*b - b^2
sage: imag(A.simplify_full())
2*a*b
```

The last result is clearly wrong. abs() is real by definition. simplify_full() doesn't handle abs() correctly.

The exact place is 

```
sage: A.simplify_radical()
a^2 + 2*I*a*b - b^2
```
This is how `radcan` in Maxima does this over the real domain, which `simplify_radical` temporarily makes us in.  

I'm not sure what the best thing to do here is.  Two ideas:
* Change so that we stay in `domain:complex` in Maxima, sort of missing the point of `simplify_radical`
* Give lots of warnings not to trust simplification because (like most simplification) it is not always true, but useful.  (Sort of like how `\sqrt{x^2}\neq x` but sometimes it's useful to simplify it that way.)

I do not think we pass the domain information from the (Pynac) variables in any case, or if that would be very easy to do.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

This has been fixed by #12780.

```
sage: var('a b')
(a, b)
sage: A = abs((a+i*b))^2
sage: A.simplify_radical()
abs(a + I*b)^2
sage: imag(A)
0
sage: imag(A.simplify_full())
0
```
Patch probably coming up.  This would also be dealt with by #12737, but that is orthogonal to having fixed the domain issues.
