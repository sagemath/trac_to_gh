Ok, this looks good, and is the proper way to deal with this.   All tests pass.  

Should we add Jason as an author due to his work at #8624?   Up to him, probably.

That should be a little bit better.

Jason should get author credit too. I unfortunately didn't realize there was a patch at #8624, since it's closed: fixed, until after I had created my patch. Once I saw his, I went back and added some of his doctests to mine.

If he *doesn't* get author credit, then it looks like I just stole everything =)

abs_integrate can't do easy things like integrate(abs(cos(x)),x) right.

```
(%i8) integrate(abs(cos(x)),x);

(%o8) 2*((1/2-sin(x)/((cos(x)+1)*(sin(x)^2/(cos(x)+1)^2+1)))
        *signum(sin(x)/(cos(x)+1)-1)
        +1)*signum(sin(x)/(cos(x)+1)+1)
```
and the resulting expression is wrong, as it is 1 at 0, and not 0. As a result, we get `integrate(abs(cos(x)),x,0,pi)==-1`.
Needless to say, same happens in Sage:

```
sage: integrate(abs(cos(x)),(x,0,pi))
-1
```
This is with maxima 5.26, as well as with 5.29, see #13364.
