This is the followup to #8624, as suggested in #10434.

We want to do more integrals!  There are lots at the patch at #8624 which it would be great to add.

That should be a little bit better.

Jason should get author credit too. I unfortunately didn't realize there was a patch at #8624, since it's closed: fixed, until after I had created my patch. Once I saw his, I went back and added some of his doctests to mine.

If he *doesn't* get author credit, then it looks like I just stole everything =)

```
and the resulting expression is wrong, as it is 1 at 0, and not 0. As a result, we get `integrate(abs(cos(x)),x,0,pi)==-1`.
Needless to say, same happens in Sage:

```
sage: integrate(abs(cos(x)),(x,0,pi))
-1
```
This is with maxima 5.26, as well as with 5.29, see #13364.
