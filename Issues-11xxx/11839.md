The documentation for Expression.collect() has examples, but doesn't actually tell you what it's supposed to do.

I think that this is pretty good overall, but the random test is a little weak, because they are very small polys.  Check out a few!

Instead, 

```
sage: base = QQ['y']
sage: polynomials = base['x']
sage: f = SR(polynomials.random_element(8)); g = f.expand().collect(x); print f; print g; bool(f == g)
```
gives us a more robust one.  Can you think of even more crazy ones?  We could do arbitrarily wacky ones... but at least this show the collect in action; the current test rarely does, as far as I can tell.

I left it kind of simple because I've seen expression equality fail on some "easy" cases. A result of `bool(f == g) == False` just means "I couldn't prove that `f == g`".

In that regard the test is only correct if it's going to generate very simple (i.e. comparable) expressions. We could go higher than the default of degree 2 probably, but I didn't feel like spending too much time thinking about it, either.

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

I was worried about things like,

```
sage: bool(1/3*sqrt(2/5) == 2/3*sqrt(1/10))
False
```

and the fact that the relevant Ginac code calls expand:

```
// correct for lost fractional arguments and return
return x + (*this - x).expand();
```

but I think I've convinced myself that this won't matter because we'll be expanding zero in that last statement.

Patch has been updated.

The patchbot and myself gets some small fuzz, however I don't know offhand which patch this needs to be rebased off:

```
patching file sage/symbolic/expression.pyx
Hunk #1 succeeded at 5115 with fuzz 1 (offset 274 lines).
now at: sage-trac_11839.patch
```
Also could you please remove all trailing whitespace and remove the dollar signs `$` (the single backticks <code>\`</code> takes it into math mode). Otherwise looks good.
