sage-4.7.2.alpha2 on an Intel 64-bit Gentoo Linux system:

```
sage: pari.setrand(0)
  ***   incorrect type in setrand.
  ***   Error in the PARI system. End of program.
```

The error message can vary, but it always causes Sage to quit/crash.

Patch looks good and applies fine to 4.7.2.alpha2, tests pass -- the horrible crash no longer occurs.

I did *not* test this with 4.7.2.alpha2+#11130.
