The algdep function chokes when the input is a vanilla Python complex number.   There is explicit code in algdep to handle this case, but it tries to convert the input to a Sage ComplexField element by a nonexistent method.    Really, the traceback says it all:

```
sage: z = complex("1+2j")
sage: z
(1+2j)
sage: type(z)
<type 'complex'>
sage: algdep(z, 4)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

/Users/dunfield/Dropbox/knot-genus/Genus-Comp/<ipython console> in <module>()

/pkgs/sage-4.6/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/rings/arith.pyc in algdep(z, degree, known_bits, use_bits, known_digits, use_digits, height_bound, proof)
    190         z = sage.rings.real_mpfr.RR(z)
    191     elif isinstance(z, complex):
--> 192         z = sage.rings.complex_field.CC(z)
    193 
    194     if isinstance(z, (sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber,

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'CC'
```

This could be fixed simply by changing line 192 to 

```
z = sage.rings.complex_field.ComplexField()(z)
```
but I'm not sure if this the canonical way to do things, and hence didn't submit a patch.
