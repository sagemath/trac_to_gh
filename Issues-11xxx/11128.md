As pointed out by Alessandro De Luca on [sage-combinat-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/browse_thread/thread/b6477d86e57b5e44), there is a bug in the `conjugate_position` method for finite words:

```
sage: w = Word([0,0,1,0,2,1])
sage: [w.conjugate(i).conjugate_position(w) for i in range(6)]
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, None]
```

Allessandro also said:

```
This bug has consequences on other functions in the combinatorics on
words package: for instance, you get

sage: Word('abaa').is_conjugate_with(Word('aaba'))
True

sage: Word('aaba').is_conjugate_with(Word('abaa'))
False 
```

Hi, Sébastien !

I took a look at your patch and everything seems fine. All tests passed when the patch is applied on top of sage-4.6.2. However, there is a small error displayed by Sphinx when building the documentation. I fixed it in my review patch.

To me, this is a positive review as soon as Sébastien approves my first one-character patch!

Alexandre

Here is one example of speed improvement :

```
sage: w = Word([0..20])
sage: z = Word([7..20] + [0..6])
```

BEFORE:

```
sage: %timeit w.is_conjugate_with(z)
125 loops, best of 3: 2.2 ms per loop
```

AFTER:

```
sage: %timeit w.is_conjugate_with(z)
625 loops, best of 3: 99 µs per loop
sage: 2.2 / 0.099
22.2222222222222
```

Thanks for the review and the doc fix. I checked, and I get no warning now during the documentation build after applying your patch.
