Assignee: jason, was

Keywords: animate convert ffmpeg

In ticket #11170, code was added so that if ffmpeg is present, it gets used by default to produce animated gifs.  These can be much larger than the ones produced by 'convert', plus there may be other problems with ffmpeg.  The attached patch makes 'convert' the default again.

I've never used GraphicsMagick, but I'll take a look some time.  It would be nice to include it, if it's that small.  Does it need libjpeg or anything else like that?

This looks good. Two notes:

* You can't pass `use_ffmpeg=True` when using `.save()`. If it's easy to do, can `.save()` pass that onto `.gif()`? Or at least change the docstring in `.save()` to tell users to go directly to `.gif()` if they want to use ffmpeg.

* Somehow, the `delay` parameter is now a string:

```
sage: a.gif('bar2.gif', use_ffmpeg=True)

Calling `.ffmpeg()` without the patch here works fine.
