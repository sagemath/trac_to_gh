FareySymbol is a **fast** implementation of the **KFarey** package for Sage.

The major changes done by me:

* created an object oriented coherent class interface

* implemented a C++ module with pyx interface

FareySymbol allows the calculation of properties of a general arithmetic subgroup.  The use with the congruence subgroups Gamma0, Gamma1, GammaH is trivial. For a group not implemented in Sage, the "user" has to define a class with a `__contains__(self, M)` attribute which returns `True` or `False` depending on `M` being in the group or not.

The calculation of the generators, coset representation and genus of Gamma(32) takes 62.5 seconds on my laptop. Try this with Magma ... .

```
sage: time FareySymbol(Gamma(32))
FareySymbol(Congruence Subgroup Gamma(32))
Time: CPU 62.50 s, Wall: 62.52 s
```

<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

That is great work! Not so many issues that I found; And really this is code of awesome readability.

The first major issue is the missing GPL header farey.cpp.

I will do the rest per line and file:
farey.cpp:
l.13 missing #include <algorithm>   Did this really compile for you? That seems impossible.
l.114 reverse the order of name and group (for consistency only).
l.127 this is bad. Compare with l.114.  The easiest will be to change the latter.
l.147 change to = a[i]/b[i] - a[i-1]/b[i-1], since operator/ already constructs a new instance and hence it would be a wast to call the copy constructor.
l.150 this is asking for trouble on Sun and other platforms. It would hurt to use int i, will it?
l.154 add break; hereafter to make it a tiny bit faster.
l.187 and l.188 use A = ... and B = ..., since again the copy constructor is not needed.
l.203 like l.187f
l.225 why don't you use throw like in l.260?
l.264 move this directly behind the alternate version of paring_matrix, that is, l.247, to improve readability.
l.290 and l.291 define one_half(1,2) and use this here.
l.297 use one_half(1,2), which is a bit faster.
l.314 again this is calling for trouble on Sun. Use int k?
l.324 missing initialization c(paring.size(), 0);.
l.426 delete this assertion?
l.428 it is a shame that the compiler doesn't catch this, but again Sun won't like this.
l.512 I'm not sure at all, but should this be NO, because already 1 represents a paired fraction? In that case you can remove the FREE label from the enum.

farey_symbols.pyx:
l.5 the syntax is:

```
AUTHORS:

- Hartmut Monien (08 - 2011)
```
l.7 read C++.
l.46 Why to use the underscore at the end of the line?
l.50 Read `G`, because it is a mathematical symbol.
l.61, l.191, l.214, and l.267 use Sequence(..., cr = True) to make the output more readable.
l.103 use _repr_.
l.109 sage: repr(FareySymbol(Gamma0(23)))
l.128, l.139, l.151, l.187, l.224, and l.281 missing full stop.

farey_symbol.h: You don't need this, but I think it would be best to use it to replace l.21ff in farey.cpp.

sl2z.hpp:
l.25 and l.26 protected? otherwise it makes no sense to declare all the functions above as friend.

Tests:
The tests are currently not sufficient to cover all cases the code treats. This the difference occures in farey.cpp,l.189ff, it would be sufficient to add tests like FareySymbol(G). Please add tests for SL2Z, Gamma1(4) and GammaH(11, [2,7]) or any equivalent set of test cases.

I need to double check this agains Magma, and I will do this tomorrow. It would also be good to see, whether everything works fine on the Sun test cluster. I hope the patch bot will pick this up soon.

I have implemented the changes by Martin Raum - including the C++ version of GammaH.  I have added a number of doctests for SL2Z, Gamma1 and GammaH. 

The only undocumented feature is the possibility to define arbitrary subgroups of SL2Z by a helper class. I include an example "noncongruence_example.sage". How can that be doctested?

Otherwise the patch should be ready to go.

I will have a look at this soon.

Concerning the example class, I would change the description to something like "Simple example how to implement noncongruence groups for the FareySymbol class."

Testing shouldn't be too difficult. In the class doc, test whether you can initialize the FareySymbols and whether you can, say, compute the coset representatives.  For all other methods just call it and verify the output. Definitely, by now, all functions that get into Sage need to be tested completely.

<div id="comment:23" align="right">comment:23</div>

Since many things have changed in 4.7.2 I have decided to lump everything in one new patch.

**FareySymbol** has been checked for special cases (not implemented in the KFarey package) including the unique index two subgroup. It now handles gracefully subgroups which contain SL2Z([-1, 1, -1, 0]). 

The drawing of the fundamental domain has been changed slightly. The coloring of the pairing has been changed to include the first and last side.

The current algorithm for calculating the FareySymbol is O(n!^2) where n is the index of the subgroup which is the general case. This could be improved to O(n) for Gamma0, Gamma1 and Gamma as Georg Weber pointed out. The current algorithm runs for about a second to calculate all properties of the FareySymbol for Gamma(16) with index 1536. This is probably satisfactory at the moment (and still much faster than Magma). 

The documentation has been corrected.

I tried installing `trac-11709_farey_symbol-sage-4.8.patch` this on the latest Sage beta (5.0.beta6), which brought up a couple of minor issues:

(1) There was a conflict in sage/modular/all.py (easily fixable, caused by #11601 merged in 5.0.beta1). Other than that, the patch applies OK. 

(2) Building gave a curious warning:

<div id="comment:26" align="right">comment:26</div>

This bothers me a bit:

```
sage: all([x in Gamma1(4) for x in FareySymbol(Gamma1(4)).generators()])
False
```
If G is odd, the generators that get returned are arbitrary liftings of generators of the projective image of G, so they won't generally be in G.

Also, I don't like this:

```
sage: FareySymbol(Gamma0(4)).generators()
[[1 1]
[0 1], [ 3 -1]
[ 4 -1]]
```
These elements do *not* generate Gamma0(4); they generate an index 2 odd subgroup of Gamma0(4) (which one can check is congruence of level 8, using the functions added by ticket #11601).

I'd like to request the following changes:

- Make sure the "generators" are really in G when G is odd.

- If G is even and has no torsion, pad the list of generators with -1. Otherwise, make sure representatives of the torsion generators are chosen so the subgroup they generate contains -1. 

- I'd also suggest we rewire the "generators" method of the top-level arithmetic subgroup class to use Hartmut's new code by default, with the old code as an optional fall-back. 

- While we're at it, it would be nice to have a "farey_symbol" method of arithmetic subgroups as an alternative to the constructor function.

Wait a minute, here's a bug.

```
sage: G = ArithmeticSubgroup_Permutation(S2="(1,2,3,4)",S3="(1,3)(2,4)")
sage: gens = FareySymbol(G).generators(); [x.matrix() for x in gens]
[
[1 2]  [ 0 -1]  [ 1 -1]
[0 1], [ 1 -1], [ 1  0]
]
sage: gens[0] in G
False
```

This has the disastrous consequence that ` G.is_congruence() ` returns False, even though G is actually congruence (of level 4).

For some reason, the mechanism that checks whether the potential generator is actually in the group, and if not flips its sign, doesn't seem to be working for this particular group G. It seems to work for all the other ones I've tried though. Hartmut: any thoughts?
