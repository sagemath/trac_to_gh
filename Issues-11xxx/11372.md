This could seriously confuse a person:

The point that simon_two_descent finds is a torsion point.  But for some reason E then thinks it has rank 0!  Even though simon_two_descent's first output was 1, and in fact E has rank 1.  This is pretty scary.

**Related:** #11005 (Update Simon's GP scripts and convert to use via gp2c)
