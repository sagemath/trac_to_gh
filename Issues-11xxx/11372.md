The point that simon_two_descent finds is a torsion point.  But for some reason E then thinks it has rank 0!  Even though simon_two_descent's first output was 1, and in fact E has rank 1.  This is pretty scary.

Looks great, and all tests pass. 

Could someone else go to the stopgap ticket (#12695) and mark that it's no longer needed?
