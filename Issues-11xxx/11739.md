It's nice to have a way to add a new vertex no matter what the graph is. That is the purpose of executing add_vertex() without parameters: to add a vertex numbered with the least nonnegative integer not already in the graph.

But the problem is that it doesn't return the number, so you can't add edges to it. Therefore add_vertex() w/o params currently is only useful for adding isolated vertices.

I like this patch. I will run the doctests. However, shouldn't we do the same for `add_vertices` for consistency?

```
sage: G=Graph()
sage: G.add_vertex()
0
sage: G.add_vertices([None])
```

Note the following strange thing:

```
sage: G=Graph()
sage: G.add_vertices([None,0])
sage: G.vertices()
[0]
```
thus we added only one vertex.

It should be like

```
OUTPUT:

foo if bla, bar otherwise.  If this is a long line, it
should be wrapped.
```

I agree, but those are very old, probably from before we had standards.

That could be useful, but there is this problem: what to do if there are no None-labeled vertices in the input? Returning an empty list is consistent, but in most cases, where the feature won't be used, this looks just weird and None would be much better:

```
sage: G.add_vertices([1, 3])
[]
```

Good point. I guess it makes better sense to add named vertices first.
