Hello, 

```
------- ----------- 
P = polygon([[1,2], [5,6], [5,0]], fill = False, color='red') 
P 
------- ----------- 
```
still fills the polygon, is there another way to turn off color fill. 
Thanks. 
-Giri

The fix is to add

```
         z = int(options.pop('zorder', 1))
         p.set_alpha(a)
+        f = options.pop('fill', True)
+        p.set_fill(f)
         c = to_mpl_color(options['rgbcolor'])
         p.set_edgecolor(c)
```
in `Polygon._render_on_subplot` in sage/plot/polygon.py.


Notice that this means to actually *get* such a polygon, you would need to set the thickness.  Is that a bug?  We do intentionally have the thickness 0 in the ``@`options`.

```
sage: P = polygon([[1,2], [5,6], [5,0]], fill = False, thickness=1) ; P
sage: P = polygon([[1,2], [5,6], [5,0]], fill = False) ; P
```

Might be worth looking at this file a little more too.  There are lots of interesting mpl options like hash one could set, and there is at least one typo:

```

    EXAMPLES:
        
    Note this should normally be used indirectly via ``circle``::
        
        sage: from sage.plot.polygon import Polygon   
```
which I thought had another ticket, but maybe it doesn't...
