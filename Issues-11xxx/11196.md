Currently one can only compute the maximal height of a Dyck word. The patch add computing the sequence of heights and also comparing two Dyck words. 

Since I needed it, I also added two function to compute a Dyck word from its heights sequence and to compute a minimal Dyck word knowing a lower bound for the heights.

Even if it is actually a class ?

I think so since it's more of a shortcut instead of defining a HeightPoset outside of the class and then having a `height_poset` method which returns an object of that type.

Hi Mike, 

I just uploaded a new patch which address your comment. It also add a two new function related to heights. 

How did you manage to replace my patch ? I got an error saying that I don't have the right to remove yours. Maybe its because you are a trac admin.
