<div id="comment:0"></div>

The center of the cube is affected by the argument size :

```
sage: c = cube(center=(10,10,10), size=0.5)              
sage: c.bounding_box()                            
((4.75, 4.75, 4.75), (5.25, 5.25, 5.25))          
```

The intended behavior is that the center is independant of the size:

```
sage: c = cube((10,10,10), size=0.5)              
sage: c.bounding_box()  
((9.75, 9.75, 9.75), (10.25, 10.25, 10.25))  
```
