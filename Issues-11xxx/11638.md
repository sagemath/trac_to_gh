This was my first patch, so I just didn't know where to put things. The *best* thing to do would be get #12094 and #11483 reviewed so that more of these will work. Then we could stick them in the appropriate TESTS block.

Does that mean #12094 is ready for review?

Yes! Fixed. The subtleties of trac had not yet had time to sink in when I made that patch. There's no option to open a ticket as anything other than new, so it never occurred to me.
