Does that mean #12094 is ready for review?

Yes! Fixed. The subtleties of trac had not yet had time to sink in when I made that patch. There's no option to open a ticket as anything other than new, so it never occurred to me.

<a id='comment:10'></a>Random update: The test for #11594 is no longer needed, it went in another ticket.

#11591 test case still fails.

#11590 test case still fails.

#11238 no longer needed, it went in with the fix.

Just keeping track of known failures so that they can be checked from time to time.
