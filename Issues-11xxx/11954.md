Various functions in cython.py have no documentation. The attached patch improves this. Note that after apply the patch, `sage --coverage cython.py` does not report 100%, because some multiline strings are interpreted as undocumented functions/classes/methods by the coverage script.  Also, the function `cython` has no doctests.  Suggests for that?

This also adds cython.py to the reference manual.

Apply trac_11954-cython-doc.patch, trac_11954-review.patch

Here's a new patch which makes various cosmetic changes to the Sphinx formatting. I wasn't sure what the mysterious `"sagobject_name"` was supposed to mean in the docstring of the cython lambda function and the doctests weren't too helpful on that point; I'm guessing it's a typo for `sage.object_name`.

If you're happy with my reviewer patch, that's a positive review.

I'm mostly happy with the reviewer patch -- thanks for your work on this, it looks much better now. However, I don't like line 314:

```
'``Compiling <filename>...``'
```
The quotes don't look good after running Sphinx. Maybe it should be <code>\`\`'Compiling <filename>...'\`\`</code>? Or maybe the single quotes should be dropped? Or drop the double back quotes instead?
