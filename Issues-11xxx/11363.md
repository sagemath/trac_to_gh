As soon as this ticket is fixed, then Ticket #10361 can also be closed (as this ticket supersedes that one by upgrading to an even newer setuptools, and fixing the Twisted/OSX issue).

At least, I can't find setuptools 0.6.16 on the setuptools web page [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools), but I do see it on the distribute page [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute).  This needs to be documented in the SPKG.txt file: update both the description and the web page.

On the bright side, on my OS X box at least, it doesn't seem to suffer from the same problem as reported on #10361.

<a id='comment:19'>Comment 19:</a>
I think it's not a bad idea to look at previous tickets dealing with an spkg when updating it.

In this case #10361 (updating setuptools to 0.6c11), which got positively reviewed and merged, but later unmerged again due to an issue with `twisted` on MacOS X.

The changes made there, namely
* making `spkg-install` executable,
* adding a *Special Update / Build Instructions* section to `SPKG.txt` (with a note on deleting the Windows binaries),
* removing mabs from the spkg maintainer list (I'm not sure if that's still desired),
* substituting `#!/bin/sh` by `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, and, last but not least
* adding error checks to `spkg-install` (though now in addition patches are applied from it)
are all missing in the new spkg here.

Btw, the patch [attachment: setuptools-update.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11363/setuptools-update.patch.gz) (for review purposes) doesn't really reflect the changes made to (Sage's part of) the spkg, which is perhaps minor here, but still a bit confusing.

If someone is lazy (like me), he might review (more or less) just the spkg diff on trac as is, assuming it reflects the current state of the spkg, such that mistakes or unintended changes made later may sneak in.
