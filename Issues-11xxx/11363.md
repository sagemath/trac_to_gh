<a id='comment:14'></a>Right. I should have paid more attention you are right. I will update SPKG.txt with the needed info. I will post again when it is available so you can decide if it can be switched back to positive review.

<a id='comment:19'></a>I think it's not a bad idea to look at previous tickets dealing with an spkg when updating it.

In this case #10361 (updating setuptools to 0.6c11), which got positively reviewed and merged, but later unmerged again due to an issue with `twisted` on MacOS X.

The changes made there, namely
* making `spkg-install` executable,
* adding a *Special Update / Build Instructions* section to `SPKG.txt` (with a note on deleting the Windows binaries),
* removing mabs from the spkg maintainer list (I'm not sure if that's still desired),
* substituting `#!/bin/sh` by `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, and, last but not least
* adding error checks to `spkg-install` (though now in addition patches are applied from it)
are all missing in the new spkg here.

Btw, the patch [attachment:setuptools-update.patch] (for review purposes) doesn't really reflect the changes made to (Sage's part of) the spkg, which is perhaps minor here, but still a bit confusing.

Well, there are reviewers, too, and in fact some people who commented here were aware of that ticket.

Yes, especially if you're searching for things like R... 8-)

If someone is lazy (like me), he might review (more or less) just the spkg diff on trac as is, assuming it reflects the current state of the spkg, such that mistakes or unintended changes made later may sneak in.
