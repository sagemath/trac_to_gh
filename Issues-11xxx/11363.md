As far as I can tell, the spkg here is not really setuptools, but a fork of it called "distribute".  At least, I can't find setuptools 0.6.16 on the setuptools web page [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools), but I do see it on the distribute page [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute).  This needs to be documented in the SPKG.txt file: update both the description and the web page.

On the bright side, on my OS X box at least, it doesn't seem to suffer from the same problem as reported on #10361.

I think it's not a bad idea to look at previous tickets dealing with an spkg when updating it.

In this case #10361 (updating setuptools to 0.6c11), which got positively reviewed and merged, but later unmerged again due to an issue with `twisted` on MacOS X.

The changes made there, namely
* making `spkg-install` executable,
* adding a *Special Update / Build Instructions* section to `SPKG.txt` (with a note on deleting the Windows binaries),
* removing mabs from the spkg maintainer list (I'm not sure if that's still desired),
* substituting `#!/bin/sh` by `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, and, last but not least
* adding error checks to `spkg-install` (though now in addition patches are applied from it)
are all missing in the new spkg here.

Btw, the patch [attachment: setuptools-update.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11363/setuptools-update.patch.gz) (for review purposes) doesn't really reflect the changes made to (Sage's part of) the spkg, which is perhaps minor here, but still a bit confusing.
