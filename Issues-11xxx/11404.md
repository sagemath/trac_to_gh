For testing purposes it would be very convenient if one could update/upgrade from a local directory. This is currently not possible because urllib has no concept of a directory listing to get the list of updated spkgs. The attached patch fixes this.

Apply trac_11404_upgrade_from_directory.patch to the sage_scripts repository.

This seems to work with either `sage -upgrade /full/path/to/sage` or `sage -upgrade file:///full/path...`.  It doesn't work with relative paths.  Should I expect it to?

I also think this behavior should be documented somewhere, like in the help messages in sage-sage and at the comments at the top of sage-update.

By the way, there is a typo in the docstring for `spkg_list_local_directory`: change `spgk` to `spkg`.

Finally, I agree that this would be a very useful addition to Sage.  I've wanted Sage to have this capability myself.
