Cygwin fails on the new file introduced in #9180.  We need 

```
libraries = ['gmp']
```
in that extension in `module_list.py` for this to build properly.

My pleasure - it was nice to find something I could actually fix for once!    Thanks to Mike having shown me the way at Days 31 on a similar ticket.
