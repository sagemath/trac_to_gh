When testing on sage-4.8.alpha3, I get this (presumably from #11367):

```


sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py"

The following tests failed:


	sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py"
Total time for all tests: 63.6 seconds

```

Other than that, the code looks good.  The MemoryErrors look interesting, though.  I don't think it's from this patch, but do you have any idea what it could be from?

I have installed the patch with sage 5.0-beta4.

It is working correctly, but I also have a problem with the tests. This is a rounding problem. You should ensure that unweighted connectivity returns an integer.
