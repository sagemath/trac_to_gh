The following only displays documentation for power series ring.

```
sage: PS = ZZ[['x']]
sage: PS??
Type:           PowerSeriesRing_domain
Base Class:     <class 'sage.rings.power_series_ring.PowerSeriesRing_domain'>
String Form:    Power Series Ring in x over Integer Ring
Namespace:      Interactive
File:           /mnt/local/king/SAGE/broken/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/rings/power_series_ring.py
Definition:     PS(self, f, prec=+Infinity, check=True)
Source:
class PowerSeriesRing_domain(PowerSeriesRing_generic, integral_domain.IntegralDomain):
      passConstructor Docstring:
       Initializes a power series ring.
    
       INPUT:
...
```

Hence, the source code

```
class PowerSeriesRing_domain(PowerSeriesRing_generic, integral_domain.IntegralDomain):
      pass
```
is shown, but it is not followed by a line break. That's ugly and difficult to read

<a id='comment:1'></a>Burcin, are you sure that the source is not shown? The source actually is

```
class PowerSeriesRing_domain(PowerSeriesRing_generic, integral_domain.IntegralDomain):
      pass
```

The only problem is that there may be no line break after the "pass", the doc string is appended immediately.
