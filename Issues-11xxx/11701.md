Mercurial was recently upgraded at #10594.  It was mentioned there that it has self-tests.  We should enable those to be checked with `SAGE_CHECK` and an spkg-check script.

The overall design w.r.t. `SAGE_CHECK` and `spkg-check` is a bit suboptimal. The only spkg where we unconditionally run the test suite from `spkg-install` I'm currently aware of is MPFR; there might be very few others, since we changed that in a couple of spkgs a while ago.
