Mercurial was recently upgraded at #10594.  It was mentioned there that it has self-tests.  We should enable those to be checked with `SAGE_CHECK` and an spkg-check script.

Depends on #10594

The overall design w.r.t. `SAGE_CHECK` and `spkg-check` is a bit suboptimal. The only spkg where we unconditionally run the test suite from `spkg-install` I'm currently aware of is MPFR; there might be very few others, since we changed that in a couple of spkgs a while ago.

From the src directory, I ran "make" and then "time make tests".  On an OS X box:

```
# Ran 407 tests, 35 skipped, 32 failed.
make: *** [tests] Error 1

real	22m55.609s
user	10m16.167s
sys	8m57.330s
```
On sage.math:

```
# Ran 407 tests, 25 skipped, 2 failed.
make: *** [tests] Error 1

real	13m28.549s
user	7m48.570s

```
