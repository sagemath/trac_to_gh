It seems that you agreed in a different ticket (#9562) that this class doesn't need to be in the reference manual? Hence, returning to **needs review**. Feel free to change it back, though.

Meanwhile I managed to revert to the original state, and can confirm that, with vanilla sage-4.7.1.rc2 on 32-bit solaris, the segfault above does not occur.

I will now try to do things in the order you suggested: In fact, originally I had installed polybori, then m4ri, then the m4ri patch, and then sage -b (without touching decl.pxd).

But how can the new polybori spkg be merged if apparently it depends on the new m4ri?

The tests took 84373.7 seconds on mark, and there were a couple of timeouts. However, there was no failure. The segfault that I reported above vanished by installing everything in the right order. On my computer, all tests pass.

Moreover, it is a prerequisite for working with M4RIE (#9562), which I think is a very important contribution - currently, matrices over GF(2<sup>e</sup>) are painfully slow in Sage.

I think it is ok that the matrices over GF(2) do not have their own section in the reference manual, since there seems that all non-underscore methods are already present for general matrices.

Hence, it is a positive review.

If we want to support more compilers I was thinking about dumping the CFLAGS to disk in M4RI which third party tools then can re-use. I was thinking of using the pkg-config.rc file which one can then either use via pkg-config or parse oneself.

> I can confirm that passing `-msse2` fixes the issue. I guess I'll have to find a way to save the flags (to disc?) such that third parties (PolyBoRi, Sage) can re-use them? Any suggestions on how to do that?

Take a look at GMP's / MPIR's `gmp.h` and the various libs (like e.g. MPFR) that use it:

```sh
$ egrep -B1 "__GMP_(CC|CFLAGS)" /usr/include/gmp.h
/* Define CC and CFLAGS which were used to build this version of GMP */
#define __GMP_CC "gcc -std=gnu99"
#define __GMP_CFLAGS "-march=native -g -O3"
```

I for example use (slightly OT):

```sh
# We eventually use / add these settings (or parts of them) to "our" CFLAGS,
# e.g. "-march=..." or "-mcpu=..." and "-mtune=..." to let gcc generate better,
# processor-specific code, since ECM doesn't use them if we set our own:
gmp_cc_pat='/^[ 	]*#[ 	]*define[ 	]\+__GMP_CC[ 	]\+/s/.*"\([^"]*\)"/\1/p'
gmp_cflags_pat='/^[ 	]*#[ 	]*define[ 	]\+__GMP_CFLAGS[ 	]\+/s/.*"\([^"]*\)"/\1/p'

gmp_cc=`sed -n -e "$gmp_cc_pat" "$SAGE_LOCAL"/include/gmp.h`
gmp_cflags=`sed -n -e "$gmp_cflags_pat" "$SAGE_LOCAL"/include/gmp.h`

system_gmp_h=""
for incdir in /usr/include /usr/local/include; do
    if [ -f $incdir/gmp.h ]; then
        system_gmp_h=$incdir/gmp.h
    fi
done
if [ -n "$system_gmp_h" ]; then
    system_gmp_cc=`sed -n -e "$gmp_cc_pat" $system_gmp_h`
    system_gmp_cflags=`sed -n -e "$gmp_cflags_pat" $system_gmp_h`
fi

...

    else
        # 'native' not supported, see if GMP / MPIR provides us some CPU type:
        for opt in $gmp_cflags; do
            case $opt in
                -march=*|-mcpu=*|-mtune*)
                    echo "Found CPU parameter in gmp.h: $opt"
                    cpu_params="$cpu_params $opt"
                    ;;
                 # perhaps add other options, too (e.g. for different compilers)
                 *) other_gmp_cflags="$other_gmp_cflags $opt"
            esac
        done
    fi
    # Only add them if CFLAGS do not already contain similar:
    if [ -n "$cpu_params" ] &&
        ! (echo "$CFLAGS" | egrep -- '-march=|-mcpu=|-mtune=' >/dev/null);
    then
        echo "Using additional host-specific CFLAGS: $cpu_params"
        CFLAGS="$cpu_params $CFLAGS"
    fi
    if [ -n "$other_gmp_cflags" ]; then
        echo "Not using other CFLAGS provided by gmp.h: $other_gmp_cflags"
    fi
...
```

Putting at least the *necessary* flags into `libm4ri.pc` is of course another, non-exclusive option, and even on systems that lack `pkg-config`, you could use the `.pc` file by adding a few lines of shell, Python or whatever code.


You can also test whether adding `-msse2` (if using SSE2 is desired) is necessary at all, or supported (for simplicity, here `gcc`-specific):

```sh
# Test whether '-msse2' is supported at all:
if $CC -msse2 -c -x c /dev/null -o /dev/null &>/dev/null; then
    # Ok, supported. Do we need it?
    # [Should perhaps check whether __SSE2__ is really non-zero.]
    if ($CC -E -dM -x c /dev/null | grep -w __SSE2__) &>/dev/null; then
        # Fine, we don't need to pass any options to enable SSE2.
        required_cflag=""
    else
        required_cflag="-msse2"
    fi
    # Check whether the flag conflicts with others, perhaps specified by the user:
    if $CC $CFLAGS $required_cflag -c -x c /dev/null -o /dev/null &>/dev/null; then
        # Ok, compatible and sufficient.
    else
        # Conflicting flags, issue error message or try something else...
    fi
else
    # Not supported, perhaps disable use of SSE2.
fi
```
(The same tests can easily be performed from Python as well, e.g. in [Sage's] `setup.py` or `module_list.py`. You could also steal macros from autotools.)

I'd do both, and resort to the SCons method in case no (suitable) parameters are available.

I'd do both, but preferably use the header method. Using the `.pc` file is limited and to some extent dangerous, since `pkg-config` files lack (by default) a compiler command entry such that the flags may be invalid or insufficient for the actual compiler used. 

(Note that some people even put flags into `CC` rather than `CFLAGS`, and different installed GCC versions might default to different architectures as well.)

You could either define other variables there, to get parsed / interpreted "manually", or simply put exactly the same lines you put into your header file into the `.pc` file, since incidentally any `#define` in a `.pc` file happens to be just a comment. :-)

(You'll have to use e.g. `grep` to extract them though, rather than `pkg-config`.)

Shouldn't the modules also depend on `SAGE_LOCAL + "/include/m4ri/m4ri_config.h"`? (You should use `SAGE_INC` there, too, btw. ;-) )

This should be done in a more general or automatic way, i.e., `m4ri_extra_compile_args` (and probably `-std=c99`) should be added in `setup.py` for every module that links against `libm4ri`.

(I'm adding similar for dependencies, e.g. at #8664, and other stuff, in order to make `module_list.py` more modular and less error-prone.)

P.S.: SSE2 is a superset of SSE, just as `-msse2` implies `-msse`.

The patch doesn't yet check whether adding these flags is sufficient. Haven't looked at your M4RI code, but if you add something like

```C
#if defined(__M4RI_HAVE_SSE2) && __M4RI_HAVE_SSE2
#   if !defined(__SSE2__) || !__SSE2__
#       error Your current compiler and / or CFLAGS setting doesn't allow SSE2 code. Please change that or these to the setting(s) you used when compiling M4RI.

#endif
```

But **I've** to again rebase my patch from #8664 on yours... :D

P.S.: Some good and bad news for #9958 coming soon...

Indeed, I mothballed SAGE_DEBIAN ! I didn't notice you had a patch touching that area in #8664, it took too long to merge that one really. It has to go in.

I am bracing myself for #9958, you know we already ship sage-on-gentoo with python-2.7 and it works well (#11339 excluded) on x86/amd64 linux and OS X in a prefix. But we are getting off-track.

Hi,

so how's this for a strategy:

* we do the fixes (or something similar) that Alexander and I proposed for PolyBoRi and !Sage respectively now
* I provide (in a new ticket) an updated M4RI which exports its !CLFAGS both in the headers and in the .rc file and also checks for __SSE2__ to fail gracefully.
* We then update !Sage & PolyBoRi again to use these !CFLAGS?

Attachment: **[trac_11574_m4ri_sse2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11574/trac_11574_m4ri_sse2.patch.gz)**

The updated patch *should* allow the Sage build to go through. Testing on cicero now. I also added some `depends` fields as suggested by Leif.
