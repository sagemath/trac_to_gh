In #11574 it was noticed that M4RI does not provide sufficient information to allow third party software to choose the appropriate compiler flags to link against it. While a work around is provided in #11574, it is not as clean as it could be. That is, M4RI should export the flags that were used to when building it, which can then be re-used by third party code.

This would introduce new potential hardcoding issues. (It shouldn't hurt if the directory later -- after moving Sage -- does no longer exist, but it could break the installation if it does, and the headers there are meanwhile incompatible.)

You could post-process the file in M4RI's `spkg-install`.

Do you also add `__M4RI_CC`? (Haven't looked at the spkg yet.)

Oh, I see M4RI doesn't honor `CPPFLAGS`, but it also doesn't use any of Sage's headers AFAIK, so you could simply remove `-I...` from `CFLAGS` (unless `configure` does weird things).

<a id='comment:8'></a>Why does this still need review?

And isn't "exporting" the compiler flags meanwhile fully fixed by #11574? (Except for perhaps a `.pc` file.)

The description should get updated...




Or is this spkg / ticket meanwhile obsolete, superseded by the one from #11574?

I actually first thought I had merged the wrong spkg.
