In #11574 it was noticed that M4RI does not provide sufficient information to allow third party software to choose the appropriate compiler flags to link against it. While a work around is provided in #11574, it is not as clean as it could be. That is, M4RI should export the flags that were used to when building it, which can then be re-used by third party code.

Here's how the output looks like on bsd.math:

```c
#define __M4RI_CFLAGS                   " -mmmx -msse -msse2 -msse3   -I/Users/malb/sage-4.7.2.alpha2/local/include -g -fPIC -Wall -pedantic -O2"
```

I'm not sure we want the "-I/Users/..." part in there though. But we set CFLAGS in spkg-install so I'm not sure how to avoid it.

This would introduce new potential hardcoding issues. (It shouldn't hurt if the directory later -- after moving Sage -- does no longer exist, but it could break the installation if it does, and the headers there are meanwhile incompatible.)

You could post-process the file in M4RI's `spkg-install`.

Do you also add `__M4RI_CC`? (Haven't looked at the spkg yet.)

Why does this still need review?

And isn't "exporting" the compiler flags meanwhile fully fixed by #11574? (Except for perhaps a `.pc` file.)

The description should get updated...




Or is this spkg / ticket meanwhile obsolete, superseded by the one from #11574?

I actually first thought I had merged the wrong spkg.
