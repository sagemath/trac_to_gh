The closure of the torus orbit associated to a cone of the fan is again a toric variety. This patch implements a method `toric_variety.orbit_closure(cone)` to construct this toric variety.

Um, I don't really understand the documentation of the first (private) function. Could you please expand/rewrite it a bit?-) In particular the INPUT section is a bit confusing given that there are two parameters and one of them is already called cone.

As a possible optimization

```
return ToricVariety(Fan(cones))
```
can be replaced with

```
return ToricVariety(Fan(discard_faces(cones), check=False))
```
where `discard_faces` is added to the fan module by #11200.

**Attachment:** [trac_11385_reviewer.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11385/trac_11385_reviewer.patch)

Ideally the toric variety of the orbit closure should come with the canonical embedding, even though it does not come from a fan morphism. So I think it would be better to have the restriction directly in the toric variety class.

The attached patch contains bits of code that move us closer to supporting quotient lattices, so I propose to add them - I wrote them while making the commented code work. It still does not work for cones, so I agree to leave the rest of necessary changes for the future. I also changed the docstrings quite a bit, hopefully for the best ;-)

If you are OK with the new stuff, please switch to positive review.
