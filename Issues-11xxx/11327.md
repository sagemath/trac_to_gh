New branch sorts out the use of uni- versus multi-variate polynomials systematically, and makes a lot of minor improvements and simplifications and improves many docstrings.  The specific errors originally reported here (see below) and at #16779 are fixed.


In sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_curve_isogeny (of sage 4.6.2) the routine two_torsion_part() invokes a gcd on two polynomials.  When the polynomials belong to a multivariate ring, an error occurs.  Perhaps this is because the gcd routine in sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_element has been commented out (because it uses Singular?!).

Converting psi (and perhaps psi2) to univariate polynomials within two_torsion_part() before taking the gcd seems to work, but there seems to be other code in the module which uses a multivariate ring when a univariate ring would suffice (e.g. in __init_from_kernel_polynomial).

I discovered this error when trying to create a dual isogeny (for an elliptic curve over Q(t)).  The original isogeny was a cyclic 2-isogeny and thus the dual should also be a cyclic 2-isogeny.  Without giving more details on how I created the curve, let me simply report the error message which results when I call isogeny.dual():
