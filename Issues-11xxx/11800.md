```
The function that lists the points on a hyperelliptic curve assumes that the point [0, 1, 0] is always valid. This is wrong and creates the following bug:

```
sage: R.<x> = GF(7)[]
sage: H = HyperellipticCurve(3*x^2 + 5*x + 1)
sage: H.points()
...
TypeError: Coordinates [0, 1, 0] do not define a point on Hyperelliptic Curve over Finite Field of size 7 defined by y^2 = 3*x^2 + 5*x + 1
```

This appears to be the better option, since changing the points method seems perfectly safe and banning conics is controversial (at least to some degree).\n\nThe problem when f is of degree 1 and h=0 (or more generally h=constant) stems from issues in the homogenization of `y^2+h*y-f` in the init method of HyperellipticCurve_generic. I will try to deal with these issues, probably opening a new ticket.",

Ok thanks, I will watch out for consistency with #11930. 

I will start working on the points method so that it allows conics, that is the case where (0:1:0) does not lie on the curve. This appears to be the better option, since changing the points method seems perfectly safe and banning conics is controversial (at least to some degree).

The problem when f is of degree 1 and h=0 (or more generally h=constant) stems from issues in the homogenization of `y^2+h*y-f` in the init method of HyperellipticCurve_generic. I will try to deal with these issues, probably opening a new ticket.

Points at infinity are counted incorrectly for degree 2 by this patch.

```
sage: C = Conic(GF(7), [1, 0, 0, -1, 0, 1])
sage: R.<x> = GF(7)[]
sage: H = HyperellipticCurve(x^2+1)
sage: C
Projective Conic Curve over Finite Field of size 7 defined by x^2 - y^2 + z^2
sage: H
Hyperelliptic Curve over Finite Field of size 7 defined by y^2 = x^2 + 1
sage: C.is_smooth()
True
sage: H.points()
[(0 : 6 : 1), (0 : 1 : 1), (1 : 4 : 1), (1 : 3 : 1), (6 : 4 : 1), (6 : 3 : 1)]
sage: H([1,1,0])
(1 : 1 : 0)
sage: H([1,-1,0])
(6 : 1 : 0)
```
Here C and H represent the same curve. It is a smooth conic over a finite field of order 7, hence has 8 rational points, but only 6 are found.

In general, if H has degree 2, there are 0 or 2 rational points at infinity (as in my previous comment). Since H has degree < 4, the plane model equals the smooth model, so these points can be represented and returned correctly in Sage.

In the present patch, the points() method returns all the rational points on the plane projective model, including those on the line at infinity.

I agree that when the projective plane model is singular (the typical case) we really want the points() method to spit out points on a smooth model. Maybe the issue should be raised in a separate ticket. A comment on the matter by David Kohel:

The approach of Magma is to use weighted projective space which allows one to represent two points at infinity (when the degree of `f + h^2/4` is even). In this case one gets two points at infinity rather than one (singular when g > 0).
