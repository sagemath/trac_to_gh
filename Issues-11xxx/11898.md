```
With sage-4.7.2.alpha3, executing the command

```
./sage -t -verbose "devel/sage/sage/misc/hg.py"
```
makes the doctest process start up `less`.

Probably caused by #11142 but see also #11121 and #10594.

That's strange.  I don't know the differences between verbose testing and regular that would cause this.

The attached patch fixes the problem for me, but it would also be nice to actually understand what's going on.

Another option would be a patch like this (in the `pager` function):

```diff
diff --git a/sage/misc/hg.py b/sage/misc/hg.py
--- a/sage/misc/hg.py
+++ b/sage/misc/hg.py
@@ -112,7 +112,8 @@ def pager():
         '--config pager.pager=cat'

-    if embedded():
+    from sage.plot.plot import DOCTEST_MODE
+    if embedded() or DOCTEST_MODE:
         return '--config pager.pager=cat'
     else:
         return '--config pager.pager="LESS=\'R\' less"'
```
This would require changing the doctests for the `pager` function, and those doctests wouldn't be as helpful.
