With sage-4.7.2.alpha3, executing the command

```
./sage -t -verbose "devel/sage/sage/misc/hg.py"
```
makes the doctest process start up `less`.

Probably caused by #11142 but see also #11121 and #10594.

The attached patch fixes the problem for me, but it would also be nice to actually understand what's going on.

Another option would be a patch like this (in the `pager` function):

```diff
diff --git a/sage/misc/hg.py b/sage/misc/hg.py
--- a/sage/misc/hg.py
+++ b/sage/misc/hg.py
@@ -112,7 +112,8 @@ def pager():
         '--config pager.pager=cat'
         sage: sage.server.support.EMBEDDED_MODE=False
     """
-    if embedded():
+    from sage.plot.plot import DOCTEST_MODE
+    if embedded() or DOCTEST_MODE:
         return '--config pager.pager=cat'
     else:
         return '--config pager.pager="LESS=\'R\' less"'
```
This would require changing the doctests for the `pager` function, and those doctests wouldn't be as helpful.
