What should be done with:

```
cdef mpz_t denom
mpz_init_set_si(denom, 1)
```
This code is correct but gives a `local variable 'denom' referenced before assignment` warning.
(there are many of these in `sage/matrix/misc.pyx` for example)

If there is an easy way to fix this, then we should do this.  I'm saying we should fix every single warning but if it is possible to declare `mpz_t` such that there are no warnings, we should certainly do this.

Sorry to be late to the party. I get an error building the optional mpc extension in 4.8.alpha2 and I suspect cython-0.15.1 is the problem

```
sage/rings/complex_mpc.c: In function '__pyx_pf_4sage_5rings_11complex_mpc_15MPComplexNumber_16__float__':
sage/rings/complex_mpc.c:9720:48: error: cast specifies array type
```
I am guessing the complex_mpc.pyx code needs to be updated but I don't really know how.
