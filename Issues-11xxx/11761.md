This code is correct but gives a `local variable 'denom' referenced before assignment` warning.

If there is an easy way to fix this, then we should do this.  I'm saying we should fix every single warning but if it is possible to declare `mpz_t` such that there are no warnings, we should certainly do this.

> Spkg updated with executable bit set commit.

Looks you forgot to update the spkg, it is exactly the same as before (last modified on 1 november):

```
$ ls -l /home/robertwb/cython/spkg/cython-0.15.1.spkg
-rw-r--r-- 1 robertwb robertwb 1420704 2011-11-01 06:57 /home/robertwb/cython/spkg/cython-0.15.1.spkg
```

Never mind, I will make the change.
