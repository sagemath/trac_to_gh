I've fixed the executable bit on spkg-install and added the tests to the spkg. (I remember someone complaining way back that they were too big, but I don't think it's an issue and we've regularly shipped them before, and it's easier to just have them there.) The spkg at the above link has been refreshed. 

The warnings are primarily due to the fact that `mpz_t` et al are declared as `void*` rather than arrays of size 1. http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/2a2abbcad325/sage/libs/gmp/types.pxd#l1 Once this is fixed the warnings should go away (and they are correct with respect to the current declarations). All the other warnings I've noticed are correct too, I simply haven't had the time to fix/update Sage's code.

Your review patch looks fine. You obviously looked at this, is the window closed for 4.7.2?

If there is an easy way to fix this, then we should do this.  I'm saying we should fix every single warning but if it is possible to declare `mpz_t` such that there are no warnings, we should certainly do this.

> I've fixed the executable bit on spkg-install and added the tests to the spkg.

One more thing: changing permissions is a change which should be committed.  So could you please do a `hg commit` and re-upload the spkg?  Otherwise, the package and patch looks good.

Looks you forgot to update the spkg, it is exactly the same as before (last modified on 1 november):

```
$ ls -l /home/robertwb/cython/spkg/cython-0.15.1.spkg
-rw-r--r-- 1 robertwb robertwb 1420704 2011-11-01 06:57 /home/robertwb/cython/spkg/cython-0.15.1.spkg
```

Never mind, I will make the change.
