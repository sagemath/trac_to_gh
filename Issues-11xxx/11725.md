Random elements of QQbar default to the method implemented for the integers.  This patch creates algebraic numbers via roots of random polynomials with integer coefficients.

Implementation notes:
1.  Degree 2 is the default so that some complex numbers are generated.
2.  Might create constant polynomials, so a monic term (of random degree) may be added.
3.  Could be some efficiencies to be gained by not creating all the roots and choosing just one, but this should be a good start.
4.  Real goal was random vectors over `QQbar`.  A doctest demonstrates how control of the integer coefficients can be passed from `random_vector()` to the `QQbar.random_element()` to `ZZ.random_element()`.

Seems mostly fine to me. It would be easy to get bogged down as to what the default behaviour of `QQbar.random_element()` should be, but as implemented here this seems a reasonable first step. I did a test and found that with default parameters `QQbar.random_element()` returns zero about 15% of the time, nonzero real numbers about 60% of the time, and nonzero imaginary numbers about 7% of the time:

```
sage: L = []
sage: for j in range(5000):
....:     L.append(QQbar.random_element())
....:     
sage: RDF(L.count(0))/len(L)
0.133
sage: C = [r.imag() == 0 and r != 0 for r in L]
sage: RDF(C.count(True))/len(C)
0.6194
sage: D = [r.real() == 0 and r != 0 for r in L]
sage: RDF(D.count(True))/len(D)
0.066
```

The doctests all work and illustrate the new behaviour well. I fixed a few spelling errors, one grammatical error and added extra info in one other place:

```
- ``poly_degree`` - default: 2 - degree of the random 
   polynomial over the integers that the algebraic number 
   is a root of.
```
becomes

```
- ``poly_degree`` - default: 2 - degree of the random                                                     
    polynomial over the integers of which the returned                                                      
    algebraic number is a root.
```
And

```
For example if we do not include zero as a possible 
coefficient, there will never be a zero constant term, and 
thus never a zero root. ::
```
becomes

```
For example, current default behaviour of this method                                      
returns zero about 15% of the time; if we do not include zero as a                                        
possible coefficient, there will never be a zero constant term, and                                       
thus never a zero root. ::
```

I've uploaded the updated patch. These are trivial changes, but I suppose this should be re-reviewed before it can be given a positive review.

I also get two Sphinx warnings for `qqbar.py`; as far as I can see (regarding the line numbers) these originate *from another patch*:

```
.../sage-4.7.2.alpha3-pre2/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/rings/qqbar.py:docstring of sage.rings.qqbar:476: (WARNING/2) Literal block expected; none found.

```

Would be nice if *you* could fix these *here* as well though; my "patch queue" for `qqbar.py` is:

```

So apparently one of the two others (#10981, #9138) causes them, but you could (or should) base your patch(es) on these anyway.
