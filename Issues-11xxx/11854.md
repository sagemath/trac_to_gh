Same problem as #11611 but for `QQ` instead of `ZZ`, the hash of an element depends on previous garbage on the PARI stack.  This is because the conversion QQ->PARI is not done properly.

sage: hash(pari(QQ(1)))

The code looks excellent and this is an extremely important patch.    (An English expert may point out that "For internal use only, this directly uses the PARI stack." is a run-on sentence, and should be "For internal use only; this directly uses the PARI stack.")

Also all tests pass, so positive review.
