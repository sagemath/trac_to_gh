Same problem as #11611 but for `QQ` instead of `ZZ`, the hash of an element depends on previous garbage on the PARI stack.  This is because the conversion QQ->PARI is not done properly.

```
sage: foo = pari(2^(32*1024));
sage: hash(pari(QQ(1)))

sage: foo = pari(0xDEADBEEF * (2^(32*1024)-1)//(2^32 - 1));
sage: hash(pari(QQ(1)))
