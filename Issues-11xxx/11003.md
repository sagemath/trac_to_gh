Currently, one can do:

```
    sage: class foo(object):
    ...       bar = LazyImport('sage.bar', 'bar')
    sage: foo.bar
    bar
```

and this works (assuming sage.bar.bar exists of course). As a
syntactic sugar, it would be nice to have lazy_import work as well, if
possible with the automatic back-insertion of the object into the
class after the actual import occurred:

```
    sage: class foo(object):
    ...       lazy_import('sage.bar', 'bar')
    sage: type(foo.bar)
    <type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
    sage: foo.bar
    bar
    sage: type(foo.bar)
    <type 'bar_type>
```

Thanks Mike!

What's the rationale for not always walking through the whole mro?

I would suggest to replace ``walk_owner_namespaces=False* by ``owner=None*.

Otherwise, this looks overall looks good. I have no clue at this point about the f_globals vs f_locals point though.

Cheers,
                       Nicolas

Sorry, I should have been more explicit. It's about the using `owner.__bases__' rather than ``owner.__mro__''.

Hi!

Replying to [@mwhansen](#comment%3A9):
> Robert Bradshaw is here, and we're going to discuss the `f_globals` to `f_locals` change.

What was the result of this discussion?

Shall we get this patch in?

Cheers,
                          Nicolas
