The Polyhedron class is, so far, free-standing with some sort of coercion for the base ring tacked manually. This ticket strives to add parents for polyhedra and make the base ring coercion work more naturally. 

There will be 3 supported base rings:
* ZZ (meaning that the polyhedron is a lattice polytope, that is, both H- and V-representation are defined over ZZ)
* QQ
* RDF

Apply:
* [attachment:trac_11763-polyhedra_coercion_folded.3.patch]
* [attachment:trac_11763_fix_associahedron.patch]
* [attachment:trac_11763_lazy_import.patch]

This changes the behavior of the .vertices() method, returning "sage.geometry.polyhedron.representation.Vertex" objects instead of simple lists of coordinates.  This breaks some code of mine, so I think there should be a deprecation warning before introducing this.  I don't really like the behavior, but I see that .vertices_list() does return a list of lists of coordinates.

Well, no, there is quite a bit of my code that does not work fine, and I am not talking about artificial test cases.  Here is a shortened example of something this patch breaks:

I've changed the `cmp()` doctest to use `abs(cmp())` to avoid dependence on arbitrary memory positions.

Folding patches is considered harmful since it destroys history without any benefit.

A method always returns information about `self`, you could add "... of self" to every docstring.

I agree that using lazy imports would be good. I'll give it a whirl.

Hey Volker,

It seems that if `V` does not want to take a `ray`, we should not force it.

We prohibit coercion, conversion is certainly possible, and here `V` is the spanned vector space anyway. But I've also hit many times a situation when a standard constructor in Sage would not take generators as input, which is probably what has happened here.
