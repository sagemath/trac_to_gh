The Polyhedron class is, so far, free-standing with some sort of coercion for the base ring tacked manually. This ticket strives to add parents for polyhedra and make the base ring coercion work more naturally. 

There will be 3 supported base rings:
* ZZ (meaning that the polyhedron is a lattice polytope, that is, both H- and V-representation are defined over ZZ)
* QQ
* RDF

Apply:
* [attachment:trac_11763-polyhedra_coercion_folded.3.patch]
* [attachment:trac_11763_fix_associahedron.patch]
* [attachment:trac_11763_lazy_import.patch]

Fix comparison of H/V-representation objects:

```
sage: triangle = Polyhedron([(0,0), (1,0), (0,1)])
sage: ieq = triangle.inequality_generator().next()
sage: ieq == copy(ieq)
False
```
Now returns ``True``, as it should.

Well, no, there is quite a bit of my code that does not work fine, and I am not talking about artificial test cases.  Here is a shortened example of something this patch breaks:

```
c = polytopes.n_cube(3)
v = c.vertices()[0]
point(v)
```
This now gives a "TypeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object does not support indexing".

I've changed the `cmp()` doctest to use `abs(cmp())` to avoid dependence on arbitrary memory positions.

Folding patches is considered harmful since it destroys history without any benefit.

A method always returns information about `self`, you could add "... of self" to every docstring.

I just was wondering what was the particular use case - found this bit because of the fuzz with another patch. I don't mind it, although changing what `V.__call__` accepts seems a more pleasant solution ;-)

Wasn't that one of our design decisions, that the ToricLattice should forbid conversion between the lattice and its dual?

We prohibit coercion, conversion is certainly possible, and here `V` is the spanned vector space anyway. But I've also hit many times a situation when a standard constructor in Sage would not take generators as input, which is probably what has happened here.
