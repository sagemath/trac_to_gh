The Polyhedron class is, so far, free-standing with some sort of coercion for the base ring tacked manually. This ticket strives to add parents for polyhedra and make the base ring coercion work more naturally. 

There will be 3 supported base rings:
* ZZ (meaning that the polyhedron is a lattice polytope, that is, both H- and V-representation are defined over ZZ)
* QQ
* RDF

Apply:
* [attachment:trac_11763-polyhedra_coercion_folded.3.patch]
* [attachment:trac_11763_fix_associahedron.patch]
* [attachment:trac_11763_lazy_import.patch]

<a id='comment:13'></a>Well, no, there is quite a bit of my code that does not work fine, and I am not talking about artificial test cases.  Here is a shortened example of something this patch breaks:

```
c = polytopes.n_cube(3)
v = c.vertices()[0]
point(v)
```
This now gives a "TypeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object does not support indexing".

<a id='comment:27'></a>Attachment [trac_11763-polyhedra_coercion_folded.2.2.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket11763/trac_11763-polyhedra_coercion_folded.2.2.patch) by @vbraun created at 2012-05-04 18:02:17

I've changed the `cmp()` doctest to use `abs(cmp())` to avoid dependence on arbitrary memory positions.

Folding patches is considered harmful since it destroys history without any benefit.

A method always returns information about `self`, you could add "... of self" to every docstring.

Wasn't that one of our design decisions, that the ToricLattice should forbid conversion between the lattice and its dual?
