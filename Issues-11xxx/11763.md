The Polyhedron class is, so far, free-standing with some sort of coercion for the base ring tacked manually. This ticket strives to add parents for polyhedra and make the base ring coercion work more naturally. 

There will be 3 supported base rings:
* ZZ (meaning that the polyhedron is a lattice polytope, that is, both H- and V-representation are defined over ZZ)
* QQ
* RDF

<a id='comment:27'>Comment 27:</a>
Attachment: **[trac_11763-polyhedra_coercion_folded.2.2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11763/trac_11763-polyhedra_coercion_folded.2.2.patch.gz)**

I've changed the `cmp()` doctest to use `abs(cmp())` to avoid dependence on arbitrary memory positions.

Folding patches is considered harmful since it destroys history without any benefit.

A method always returns information about `self`, you could add "... of self" to every docstring.

Hey Volker,

It seems that if `V` does not want to take a `ray`, we should not force it.

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A61):
> Wasn't that one of our design decisions, that the ToricLattice should forbid conversion between the lattice and its dual? 

We prohibit coercion, conversion is certainly possible, and here `V` is the spanned vector space anyway. But I've also hit many times a situation when a standard constructor in Sage would not take generators as input, which is probably what has happened here.
