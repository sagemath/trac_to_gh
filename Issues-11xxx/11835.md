I assume I can close the duplicates #11833 and #11834.




The commit message isn't very meaningful, and should contain the ticket number, i.e. start with either "`#11835`" or "`Trac 11835:`".

Also, the filenames of patches attached to tickets should start with e.g. "`trac_11835-`", i.e., also have the ticket number in it.




In case your code is already ready to get reviewed, please also change the ticket's status to "needs review".

1.  the `polynomial` method should take a set of names as an argument:

```
def polynomial(self,names='x,y,z'):
    """..."""
    x,y,z = polygens(ZZ,names)
    return self._a * ...
```
1.  the methods `_automorphisms_reduced` and `_border` are written rather opaquely -- why do they do what you claim?  Please include a reference, a proof, or something to indicate why they work.
2.  typos / spelling errors: Auxiliar -> Auxillary, Ups->Oops, "it's discriminant"->"its discriminant", symmetrys->symmetries, "doesn't divides"->"doesn't divide"
