> Should one really open a ticket for something like this?


In principle yes, since otherwise they're likely to stay forever.

In this case, I'm pretty sure I've already corrected it in a not-yet-published version (a reviewer patch I have to provide for another ticket), but haven't found the time to finish it.

Once you start looking for typos, wrong formatting and inconsistencies (or meanwhile obsolete information), you're likely to not get to an end, unfortunately... ;-)

I've attached a `*.proper.patch`, which is identical except that I removed the "garbage" before "`# HG changeset patch`", i.e., I deleted the first line "`exporting patch:`", since Jeroen's current merger rejects such patches.

For now, please make sure all your patches start with "`# HG changeset patch`", i.e., have it on the first line without any preceding messages or whatever.

I've relaxed that in *my version* of the merger, but Jeroen and maybe others are likely to use his more restrictive one.
