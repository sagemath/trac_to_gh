We have

```
sage: G = CubeGroup()
sage: G.order()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'CubeGroup' object has no attribute '_gap_string'
sage: G.sylow_subgroup(3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'CubeGroup' object has no attribute '_gap_string'
```

However, these things are all easily computable in Sage:

```
sage: G2 = PermutationGroup(G.gens())
sage: G2.order()
43252003274489856000
sage: G2.sylow_subgroup(3)
Permutation Group with generators [(24,30,43)(32,48,38), ...
```

Yes, that works. You should elide the commented-out lines and the "Stored in the ``self._gap_string`` attribute" comment is also incorrect and should probably just be omitted. 

I'm still curious as to why this is a group and has a ._group attribute, but that's probably for another ticket.

Helloooooo !!!

I guess this patch is more a "group theory" patch than "graph theory", but it is not so complicated anyway. And I checked what I needed to know on [1] `:-)`

Positive review to this patch ! 

By the way, I wondered about something. A colleague of mine is working on graph automorphisms, and it seems our library on this aspect is pretty poor. Can we do anything else than just "forward instructions to GAP" ? It seems Sage's a long way to be a good alternative to their code.. Perhaps it is not meant to be, however... I'd be glad to have an layman's opinion on that though `:-)`

Hmmmmmmm `O_o`

I just checked the definition of "layman", just to be sure, and it looks like it is not exactly what I meant. What I meant was "I would be glad to have the opinion of somebody actually working with both Sage and GAP".

Sorry if my last sentence could be read as insulting, it really was not the intent `^^;`

Helloooooooooo !!

Well, this is very far from being a code I fully understand, but as the modifications are superficial I just had to check that "if what was there before made sense, then what this patch changes makes sense too" `:-D`

It looks good, though I have two comments :
* Why don't the `__str__` and `__repr__` method return the same string ? `O_o`
* You added a `check` argument to `parse` which is not documented.
