The following used to fail:

```
sage: x??
Error getting source: could not find class definition
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: P??
Error getting source: could not find class definition
sage: I??
Error getting source: could not find class definition
```

Similarly, the edit command did not work in these case.

With my patch, all that works. Moreover, both sage.misc.edit_module and sage.misc.sageinspect are put into the reference manual.

Note that this may be related with #11287: `sage.misc.sage_getfile` and `sage_getsourcelines` could be a reliable tool to get information on how and from where to import a given object. Therefore Cc to the participants of that ticket.

Moreover, Cc to #9976. Reason:

Depends on #9976

<a id='comment:4'></a>I found one more case where source code inspection failed: the (lib)singular_standard_options wrapper.

With the new patch, we have

```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: I = P*[x,y]
sage: edit(I.interreduced_basis,'vim')
    ...
    @singular_standard_options
    @libsingular_standard_options
    def interreduced_basis(self):
        r"""
        If this ideal is spanned by `(f_1, ..., f_n)` this method
        returns `(g_1, ..., g_s)` such that:
        
        - `(f_1,...,f_n) = (g_1,...,g_s)`
        
        - `LT(g_i) != LT(g_j)` for all `i != j`
   ...
```
which would previously just show the code of the wrapper, not of the wrapped method.

I wonder why the patchbot complains. In particular, why does the patchbot mention my patch from trac ticket #11115 - it shouldn't be a dependency, or should it? Let's see.

For now:

Depends on #9976

<a id='comment:16'></a>Perhaps it would be worth while to follow a more conceptual approach.

Currently, `singular_standard_options` and `magma_standard_options` applied to a method `func` simply return a function `wrapper`, that does not know about `func` (except its doc string, but I think that's a bad idea as well since copying that string costs time).

But there is the `sage_wraps` factory, and I think I should try to use it!

The second patch has now been updated.

The problem seems solved: I touched all files in sage/rings/polynomial, did `sage -b` and then built the documentation without problem.

Moreover, I fixed some syntax error in the documentation, and I've put sage.misc.decorators into the reference manual.

So, it is needing review again!

By `type`, I mean the type `type`, such as here:

```
sage: 1.__class__
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: 1.__class__.__class__
<type 'type'>
```

The idea of the code lines in question is as follows:

Let `obj` be the object whose source lines we want to determine. It is not necessarily true that the correct source lines for `obj` coincide with the source lines of its class (notorious counter example: decorated methods). Therefore, we need to try harder.

- First, it is attempted to get the position of the source code from what `inspect.getdoc` returns (lines 1400-1401)

- Second (if "first" fails), the same is attempted with what `_sage_getdoc_unformatted` returns (lines 1403-1404). For a reason that I don't understand, one can not replace the first step by the second step: The comment that I inserted states that a mysterious import error would occur at startup.

- Third (if "second" fails as well), it is tested whether the inspect module can provide the source lines of the object `obj` (line 1407).

- Last resort (if "third" fails), we replace `obj` by `obj.__class__`. That is not desired for decorated methods, but these are supposed to provide the source lines in a different way, so that one of the first three methods should succeed. I think as  a last resort it is ok... (line 1410).

There is one obvious problem with the "last resort". If the source lines of `obj.__class__` can not be found (e.g., if `obj.__class__` is defined in an spkg, not in the Sage library) then as a last resort one would try to get  `obj.__class__.__class__`, but that is the type `type` (see example above), which is defined in the Python spkg and can thus not be found. Infinite recursion.

In order to avoid the infinite recursion, an error is raised if `obj.__class__` is the type `type`, which is, in particular, the case if `obj` is not a class instance but a class.

I hope that answers your question...

A concrete example (using the meataxe wrapper from my cohomology spkg):

```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getsourcelines
sage: from pGroupCohomology.mtx import MTX
sage: M = MTX(5,[[1,2],[3,4]])
sage: sage_getsourcelines(M)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IOError                                   Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/king/<ipython console> in <module>()

/mnt/local/king/SAGE/sage-4.7.rc2/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/misc/sageinspect.pyc in sage_getsourcelines(obj, is_binary)
   1407         if pos is None:
   1408             try:
-> 1409                 return inspect.getsourcelines(obj)
   1410             except IOError:
   1411                 if obj.__class__ != type:

/mnt/local/king/SAGE/sage-4.7.rc2/local/lib/python/inspect.pyc in getsourcelines(object)
    676     original source file the first line of code was found.  An IOError is
    677     raised if the source code cannot be retrieved."""
--> 678     lines, lnum = findsource(object)
    679
    680     if ismodule(object): return lines, 0

/mnt/local/king/SAGE/sage-4.7.rc2/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/ultraTB.pyc in findsource(object)
    175             return lines, candidates[0][1]
    176         else:
--> 177             raise IOError('could not find class definition')
    178
    179     if ismethod(object):

IOError: could not find class definition
```

Since `M` can not provide its source lines, the source lines of `M.__class__` (i.e., of `MTX`) are sought.

Since the source lines of `MTX` can not be found (with the first three methods), the inspect module raises a `IOError`. It is caught, but reraised, since `MTX.__class__` is the type `type` and hence an infinite recursion must be prevented.

My personal opinion on applying patches with fuzz is that I allow patches with fuzz 1 but not with fuzz 2.  I have seen at least two cases where a "fuzz 2" patch was actually wrongly merged (I don't remember which tickets).

<a id='comment:35'></a>That's odd!

I applied the patches from #11251, then #11287. Then I had fuzz 2 for one of the patches from #9976 (but they are already merged in 4.7.1.alpha0), and then the patches from here applied *cleanly* and *without fuzz*.

So, it seems that I should get the latest rc or alpha version of sage, and try again.
