This patch implements an optional `seconds=True` keyword argument to return the number of seconds as a floating-point number instead of printing something on the screen:

```
sage: t = timeit("print 'Hi'", seconds=True)
sage: t
6.7710876464843747e-07
```
This makes it much easier to make plots for timing information.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

Looks good overall.

A few comments:

- line 42 in sage_timeit.py: "blah"?

- line 99: "evaluate" should be capitalized.

- should sage_timeit_class.pyx be in the reference manual?

- in sage_timeit_class.pyx, do you understand the parenthetical remark in "The preparser is on by default (if it is on)"?  Do you have ideas about how to clarify it?

I'm attaching a referee patch to address the first three of these.

I thought about adding `sage_timeit_class.pyx` to the manual but decided against it. Its just some Cython nuts and bolts for the Python `timeit` command. But then I don't have a strong opinion on it.

As for the "(if it is on)", I think it refers to the possibility to turn the preparser off in the Sage session via `preparser(False)`.

Hey, this is a nice ticket.  

I don't want to hold it up, but I am wondering whether you think it would be worth having a new ticket to include an example of what you mean by "This makes it much easier to make plots for timing information."?    If this is now in the reference manual, then having a common use case - perhaps even toward the top of the module, or in `timeit?`, could be useful.

Anyway, just a thought if you have an easy `# random` example, not here, of course.
