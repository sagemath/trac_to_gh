Hello Christian !

As there is still no sign from the patchbot (and yeah, I like to read what's happening in the graph backends) I began to review this patch....

I've got two questions though :

- The first one is about line 1597... It begins with an "else" after a "for" loop, and I really don't understand how it compiles or what it means `O_o`
- I edited several areas of the code to "cache" the label of a vertex which was called several times... I can not do that for the (tricky) iterators appearing just afterwards 

```
	    return iter([tuple(sorted(
            (vertex_label(v_int, self.vertex_ints, self.vertex_labels, self._cg),
	     vertex_label(u_int, self.vertex_ints, self.vertex_labels, self._cg)
            )))
               	for v_int in vertices
	            for u_int in self._cg.out_neighbors(v_int)
	                if u_int >= v_int or u_int not in vertices
                            for l_int in self._cg.all_arcs(v_int, u_int)])
```
       do you think it's woth doing ? In which case I would copy the code from the lines above thise one, and remove the label-related tests.... `:-)`

- There is a ``self.edge_labels.pop(ll_int)`` in ``set_edge_label`` but not in `del_arc_unsafe`... Is there any reason ? `:-)`

Have fuuuuuuuuuun !

It should be in `del_edge` if anywhere. Probably I just forgot to delete the edge label from the translation dictionary.

Your referee patch looks good to me, although you may post another one after reading these comments....

Hello again !

> http://docs.python.org/release/1.5/tut/node23.html

Okokokok ! Got it ! Tricky python `:-)`

I rephrase this paragraph so that it now tests whether the label is None before... As -- if I make no mistake -- the id 0 never appears in the dictionary, being always identified with None, and so it's useless to read the whole list of labels.

> Since those iterators construct a list anyway, there is no real reason for them to be written that way, but I didn't want to touch more code than necessary.

Well, in the end I edited them. I tried to pay attention, and the doctests still pass, which is also a good sign ! If you can summon the energy to re-check it... `:-)`

> It should be in `del_edge` if anywhere. Probably I just forgot to delete the edge label from the translation dictionary.

I added them !

> Your referee patch looks good to me, although you may post another one after reading these comments....

And here it is... I also tried the following on the Sage without uour patches applied :

```
sage: def test():
....:     for u,v in g.edges(labels = False):
....:         g.delete_edge(u,v)
....:         g.add_edge(u,v)
sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(200)
sage: %timeit test()
5 loops, best of 3: 538 ms per loop
```

With the patches applied 

```
5 loops, best of 3: 495 ms per loop
```

Well.. Not much, but better this way `:-)`

Salut,

to me, the patch and the review patch look fine! Thanks for the work.

One minor thing:

The code for iterator_edges, iterator_in_edges, and iterator_out_edges looks like most of it is redundant. Also, I don't understand why the multiple edges are not important in iterator_edges but is checked in both others.

Best, Christian
