sage: G.edge_label(0,1)[0] += 1
sage: G.edges()
[(0, 1, [8]), (0, 2, [8])]
```

depends on #11182.

Hello Christian !

As there is still no sign from the patchbot (and yeah, I like to read what's happening in the graph backends) I began to review this patch....

I've got two questions though :

- The first one is about line 1597... It begins with an "else" after a "for" loop, and I really don't understand how it compiles or what it means `O_o`
- I edited several areas of the code to "cache" the label of a vertex which was called several times... I can not do that for the (tricky) iterators appearing just afterwards 

```
	    return iter([tuple(sorted(
            (vertex_label(v_int, self.vertex_ints, self.vertex_labels, self._cg),
	     vertex_label(u_int, self.vertex_ints, self.vertex_labels, self._cg)
            )))
               	for v_int in vertices
	            for u_int in self._cg.out_neighbors(v_int)
	                if u_int >= v_int or u_int not in vertices
                            for l_int in self._cg.all_arcs(v_int, u_int)])
```
       do you think it's woth doing ? In which case I would copy the code from the lines above thise one, and remove the label-related tests.... `:-)`

- There is a ``self.edge_labels.pop(ll_int)`` in ``set_edge_label`` but not in `del_arc_unsafe`... Is there any reason ? `:-)`

Have fuuuuuuuuuun !

Since those iterators construct a list anyway, there is no real reason for them to be written that way, but I didn't want to touch more code than necessary.

It should be in `del_edge` if anywhere. Probably I just forgot to delete the edge label from the translation dictionary.

Your referee patch looks good to me, although you may post another one after reading these comments....

Thanks!

Hello again !

> http://docs.python.org/release/1.5/tut/node23.html

Okokokok ! Got it ! Tricky python `:-)`

I rephrase this paragraph so that it now tests whether the label is None before... As -- if I make no mistake -- the id 0 never appears in the dictionary, being always identified with None, and so it's useless to read the whole list of labels.

> Since those iterators construct a list anyway, there is no real reason for them to be written that way, but I didn't want to touch more code than necessary.

Well, in the end I edited them. I tried to pay attention, and the doctests still pass, which is also a good sign ! If you can summon the energy to re-check it... `:-)`

> It should be in `del_edge` if anywhere. Probably I just forgot to delete the edge label from the translation dictionary.

I added them !

> Your referee patch looks good to me, although you may post another one after reading these comments....

And here it is... I also tried the following on the Sage without uour patches applied :

```
sage: def test():
....:     for u,v in g.edges(labels = False):
....:         g.delete_edge(u,v)
....:         g.add_edge(u,v)
sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(200)
sage: %timeit test()
5 loops, best of 3: 538 ms per loop
```

With the patches applied 

```
5 loops, best of 3: 495 ms per loop
```

Well.. Not much, but better this way `:-)`

Salut,

to me, the patch and the review patch look fine! Thanks for the work.

One minor thing:

The code for iterator_edges, iterator_in_edges, and iterator_out_edges looks like most of it is redundant. Also, I don't understand why the multiple edges are not important in iterator_edges but is checked in both others.

Best, Christian

Nathann,

Thanks for your work on this. I'll have a look tomorrow.

The particular block of code in question was written by Jason Grout, I think. It might be to be consistent with the NetworkX backends. Also, I think he was trying to write code to eventually be replaced by something which did yield, once Cython supported it. It certainly doesn't do any harm as it is.

I was just looking at it as Nathann did some changes in there. But I am totally fine with just leaving it as it is...
