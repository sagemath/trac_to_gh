Increasing it to 50 seconds is fine with me; But I doubt it that its sufficient on some NFS-connected machines where Sage startup can take forever. The default for doctests to time out is 360 seconds according to http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html

But either way is better than 10 seconds.

360 is for a *whole file* I believe, while the 50 seconds is for one test.  So increasing the timeout for *test_executable()* much more will not help because you will run into the whole-file timeout anyway.
