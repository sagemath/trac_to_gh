This ticket aims to extend capability of the class `ArithmeticSubgroup_Permutation` in `sage.modular.arithgroup_perm`. This is now possible to deal with any subgroup of `SL(2,Z)` and many new methods are available (in particular equality of subgroups, conjugacy problem, ...)

I reimplement the method `todd_coxeter` of `sage.modular.arithgroup.arithgroup_generic` to be faster and with more output.

I also created a test file for arithmetic subgroup.

See details and documentation in the patch.

There was a dependancy problem with #10335 which is now in the description.

I'm not a native speaker and it's not easy to find where the errors are. In the new version I will post in few minutes, I have tried to be attentive to the language.

Could you be more precise ? In the new version, I expanded some of the documentations (especially the canonical labels).

OK, I downloaded #10335 and its prerequisites and it works fine now. 

Algorithm comments: 

- For permutation subgroups, almost all calculations are done with a relabelled version, but this is generated anew every time! I'd suggest:

  - having a flag that remembers whether the group is already canonically labelled,

  - when that's not the case, caching the canonically labelled version.

- At line 1019 of `arithgroup.py`, if check is True, won't this cause the check code to be run *twice*?

Corrections to docstrings:

In `arithgroup_generic.py`:

- The docstring for the todd_coxeter method is a bit vague: I'd suggest that you specify a bit more precisely what the lists `l` and `s` mean. "The action of the parabolic elements" is misleading; you mean the action of the specific parabolic element ` [[1, 1],[0,1]] `.

- It is disrespectful to Todd and Coxeter to write their names in lowercase, as you do in the docstring for `as_permutation_group` -- better to write "This uses Todd-Coxeter enumeration".

In `arithgroup_perm.py`:

- "point of vue" --> "point of view" in the module docstring (as I pointed out above)

- Again in that docstring, you make it sound like all four of L, R, S2 and S3 are needed to generate the modular group -- explain that the "three couples which are of main interest" are of interest because each pair of elements generates the whole group.

- The "todo" list will look bizzarre: some LaTeX formatting is needed for the second item

- Line 328: "generator" --> "generators"

- Line 630 "numerotation" --> "numbering"

- 640: "defines" --> "define", "renumerote" --> "renumber" (the nonexistent word "numerote" appears twice more in the next few lines)

- 744: "Returns the smallest label among rooted label" -- do you seriously expect that anyone will have the foggiest clue what this means?

- 749: "canonic" --> "canonical". This occurs all over the place. Fix them all.

- 810: needs more explanation of what the argument j0 does.

- 812: "renumerotation" --> "renumbering" again.

- 908: "does not permutes" --> "does not permute"

- 947: "at the first times" --> "at the first time"

That's as far as I've got so far -- other duties call.

Totally right. I choose to add an attribute _canonical_label_group when the group with canonical renumbering has been computed.

I don't think so. The function `__call__` is called only once, the `__contains__` method does not call the constructor and the `__init__` method of ArithmeticSubgroupElement does not care about wheter or not the element is in the subgroup "parent" given as argument.

I made the corrections.

There is an amusingly subtle bug here.

At line 769, the code sets the attribute `_canonical_labelel_group`, which is clearly a typo. This means that a subsequent hasattr check for `_canonical_label_group` returns False, leading to the following:

```
sage: S2 = "(1,2)(3,4)(5,6)"
sage: S3 = "(1,3,5)(2,4,6)"
sage: G = ArithmeticSubgroup_Permutation(S2=S2,S3=S3)
sage: H = G.relabel(inplace=False)
sage: G.has_canonical_labels()
False
```

I don't think this is what you intended, is it?

The reason I said it's complicated is that naming the method `"has_canonical_labels"` is slightly misleading. I would have assumed that `"G.has_canonical_labels() == True"` means that the labels G is using are the canonical ones. Although it's not what you intended, the typo has meant that the function is now *almost* doing what I feel the name suggests it should do! ("Almost" because it might return False in some cases even if the labels actually are the canonical ones.)

I would advocate correcting the typo at line 769 but also changing the `has_canonical_labels` function so it does what I said, i.e. so returns True if and only if `self._canonical_rooted_labels() == range(self.index())`, with a docstring to match.

You're right, of course; sorry.

Hopefully, you find that crazy bug! Thanks! I had a supplementary doctest for this method.

I removed the function has_canonical_labels which is not useful at all.

Here's a patch. The problem was the use of a python set type: you can certainly enumerate sets, but you shouldn't expect the enumeration order to be consistent! I changed the code slightly to use lists, combining two loops into one.

Hang on, this isn't good:

This is because ` sage.modular.arithgroup.arithgroup_perm.ArithmeticSubgroup_Permutation` was a class before and is now a factory function, so Python doesn't know how to unpickle pickled objects of that class.
