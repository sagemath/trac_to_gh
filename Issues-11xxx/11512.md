In notebook SAGE tries to evaluate ? even if it appears after the # sign (provided that there are something in front of # to be evaluated)

For example,

2+2 # is this easy ?

gives 

No object '' currently defined.

but just 

\# is this easy ?

is okay.

Upstream: **Reported upstream. Developers acknowledge bug.**
