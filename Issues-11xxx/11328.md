From [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/530/cannot-convert-int-to-sageringsintegerinteger):

```
sage: m = matrix([[int(1),int(1)],[int(1),int(1)]])
sage: m.insert_row(1,[int(1),int(1)])
---------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
```
Also, `insert_row` is only even defined for dense integer matrices.  If someone fixes both, great; otherwise that would be good for another ticket.

<a id='comment:2'></a>It is strange that only the integer matrices support the `insert_row()` command, as the following grep shows:

```
...rc0.11080/devel/sage-mainÂ» grep ' insert_row(' sage/matrix/**/*.py*
sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx:    def insert_row(self, Py_ssize_t index, row):

I would have expected this to be a method available to all dense matrices at least. Is it because of the requirement of typing in cython that this is not implemented for other dense matrices?

Another thing that puzzles me is that the method does not change the original matrix at all! With an integer matrix `m` being called as `m.insert_row(...)`, I would expect that `m` itself will get modified after the operation. This will be consistent with some other python functions such as lists:

```
sage: l = range(2)
sage: l.insert(0,3)
sage: l
[3, 0, 1]
```
