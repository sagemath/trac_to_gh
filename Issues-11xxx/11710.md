Attaching `config.log` in this case wouldn't be bad.

But as you mentioned, the package is fairly old anyway, which doesn't necessarily mean a newer version will install seamlessly. Did you already try that?

Yes, I tried installing a newer version.  It did not go well, and
I have abandoned the effort for now.  (Other things are demanding my attention.)  Perhaps someone else will have better luck!

To review #12335 I need to install the spkg `macaulay2-1.1-r7221.p0` into sage-5.0 but when I try I get:

```

Error: the autoconf program is not installed on your system.

/bin/sh: autoconf: not found
Please install or update autoconf: the version () should be at least 2.59.
```

It's mentioned in the error message that one can try:

```
make get-autoconf
```

but going to a sage shell and into the spkg src and running this command fails:

```

Is autoconf installed on your system? If not, does Sage include its own autoconf?

These may be dumb questions, but I can get past the autoconf, maybe because it's on my system. It breaks for me elsewhere.

I am trying to build M2 1.4 from source - it would be way better to upgrade spkg. My diary:
* I've installed autoconf on my system since it does not seem like Sage includes it in any way.
* bison and flex are available as experimental packages (why not optional?) and installed fine for me.
* I have MAKE="make -j2" and configure complains that make is not GNU, changing it to just "make" works fine.
* Next it complains about libcurses and libncurses. I have libncurses installed, but it is necessary to install development versions. I've done that.
* Now development version of libxml2...
* config finished without errors, make does not work:
 {{{

Here is an spkg that tries to build (building 4ti2 and gfan is prohibited):

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/novoselt/macaulay2-1.4-r12617.spkg

It crashes with implicit-function-declaration after several minutes into the build.

I am also experimenting with the trunk version of version 1.5, but so far I had to enable downloading extra files, these extra files are huge (27Mb for normaliz), and the build is taking forever (although it is likely to succeed - it seems to process documentation now).

I had complaints about libxml2 and yacc. I installed bison for yacc. Right now it's still building, but I'm guessing (fingers crossed) that I have everything I need.

You can try to run "sage -M2" to get M2 prompt and see if it works (worked for me showing version 1.4.0.1). Also I see it in "sage -i" - the list of installed packages. Maybe to see it in optional ones it has to be registered somehow.

For a positive review you need to check that it follows guidelines here:
http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_spkgs.html
and perhaps there are also specific guidelines for checking them. In any case this is not ready for review yet ;-)

Note also that if you just want to use M2 with Sage, you can install M2 on its own and if it is in your PATH, Sage interface should work. At least I made it work reliably with version 1.3.1 a couple years ago: #7897.

One automatic thing to try is (in Sage root)

novoselt@tx2-lmde ~/sage-5.1.beta0 $ ./sage -t -long -optional devel/sage/sage/interfaces/macaulay2.py 
sage -t -long -optional "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/macaulay2.py"

4 items had failures:

***Test Failed*** 4 failures.
For whitespace errors, see the file /home/novoselt/.sage//tmp/macaulay2_19614.py
	 [12.5 s]
```
Which shows that things still work quite well - only the last test is not quite clear without looking at the code (and there are 144 failures without M2 available, so there are quite a few tests in that module).

If you have a separate M2 installed, be careful during review tests - if you don't have a working installation inside of Sage the system-wide will be used silently and without any difference. So it may seem that spkg is working when it does not.

On an unrelated note, it is peculiar how 1 was not in `{}` before but `{2}` was in pmatrix code. New way is more consistent and easier to read by a human, I'd like to change Sage latexing in the same way to make manual modifications of results easier...
