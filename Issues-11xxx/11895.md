Only fixed modulus p-adic numbers should be hashable, all others can not implement a reasonable hash function. Currently some of them do which can cause horrible bugs:

```
sage: @cached_function
....: def is_one(x):
....:     return x==1

sage: R = Zp(3, 70)
sage: is_one(R(1,1))
True
sage: is_one(R(2^64))
True
sage: R(2^64)
1 + 2*3 + 2*3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 + 2*3^5 + 3^7 + 2*3^8 + 3^10 + 2*3^11 + 2*3^13 + 3^14 + 2*3^16 + 3^18 + 3^19 + 2*3^20 + 3^21 + 3^23 + 2*3^25 + 3^26 + 2*3^27 + 2*3^28 + 3^29 + 2*3^30 + 2*3^31 + 2*3^34 + 2*3^35 + 2*3^36 + 3^37 + 3^38 + 3^39 + 3^40 + O(3^70)
```

The problem here is that `==` has been changed so that two numbers are equal if they are equal to the least common precision. In this example, the two elements are equal to precision one and they have the same hash value (at least on my machine).

The proposal of this ticket is to make p-adics unhashable (but cacheable through #16316). The modifications required for this to work are almost always related to functions which implemented manual caching through dictionaries. The long list of dependencies is mostly about rewriting constructor functions to go through `UniqueFactory` or `CachedRepresentation` which gets unhashable elements right as of #16317. (I believe that these changes are valuable refactorings anyway.)

I can imagine that some people will not like such a change. What are the alternatives?

* Keep it the way it is. (I do not think that this is a good idea. If you do intensive p-adic computations then the birthday paradox will eventually hit you.)
* Mark p-adics in a special way so their `==` is not used by `cached_method` and friends. (Not an option, because p-adics may be wrapped inside other objects which will still use their operator `==`.)
* Change `==` for p-adics to say whether two numbers are "really" equal. (Bad idea. Say you are in a p-adic field. Some algorithm wants to know whether `x` is invertible and says `x==0`. Now this will be false for most `p`-adic zeros.)
* Make `__hash__` return a constant. (This would work but will give horrible performance.)

Can you clean up the formatting of the docstrings a bit? There's a general convention that long lines in docstrings (except doctests!) should be wrapped at 80 columns and trailing whitespace removed. Other than that this looks fine to me.

Three remarks:
- It looks like the hash maximally only contain about 3 decimal digits of information. That's way too small! Hash table lookups are based on having `O(1)` elements in the bins. To give you an idea of how small the constant in the `O(1)` should be: Python's dictionaries make sure that the average bin size in 0.7 (smaller than 1). You're fighting the birthday paradox here, so don't underestimate the likelyhood of collisions. Anyway, when using more than 1000 elements in a dictionary, the proposed hash will let dictionaries just degrade to a linear search, but with way larger memory overhead.
- It may seem that having hashes depend on precision (which isn't taken into account in equality testing!) is a mild condition, but it's not. If you have a large matrix or other aggregate element, you can easily end up with some small precision elements in there. This will lead to very confusing situation where a dict lookup doesn't find your key, but you know you have a key that's equal to a stored one. Of course, if you're relying on equality in p-adic computations you've already lost ...
- Caching functions on equality of arguments is a very bad idea with the p-adics. If I construct a known invertible matrix to too low a precision, I'll get determinant 0. If subsequently I construct the same matrix to higher precision, a cached determinant function would recognize the argument as equal to one he'd seem before (because equality is only to lowest common precision) and would just give me the 0 back. 

Properties 2 and 3 conspire to hide the problem a bit:

```
sage: @cached_function
....: def DISC(f):
....:         return discriminant(f)
....: 
sage: K=Qp(2,500)
sage: P.<x>=K[]
sage: f=(1+O(2^200))*x^2-(2^200+O(2^200))
sage: DISC(f)
0
sage: g=(1+O(2^300))*x^2-(2^200+O(2^300))
sage: DISC(g)
2^202 + O(2^302)
sage: 
sage: hash(f), hash(g)
(15360174650385708, 15377766836429868)
sage: f == g
True
```
so the entry under f isn't found when looking up g because they end up being stored in different bins, so the difference in hash is enough to distinguish them. As soon as the dictionary gets resized in a way that lets those two hashes end up in the same bin, it'll be a toss-up which answer you get back from either `DISC(f)` or `DISC(g)`. Oh course, by then it will be very painful to track down what happened.

To show that functions that depend on more of their arguments than just equality should not be cached:

```
sage: a=3
sage: b=GF(5)(3)
sage: @cached_function
....: def test(a):
....:         return a^2
....: 
sage: [test(a),test(b)]
[9, 9]
sage: test.clear_cache()
sage: [test(b),test(a)]
[4, 4]
```

Would there be something wrong with adding a `_cache_key()` to `SageObject` which per default returns `self`. Only if the element is not hashable (but should be cacheable) it could return something that is actually a unique key for this element â€” something like `self.dumps()` maybe.

I gave it a try (see attached patch). The only doctests that fail seem to be a few places where `self.dumps()` doesn't work and one problem in `sage/modular/overconvergent/weightspace.py`.

For example, the following code raises a TypeError:\n+Only fixed modulus p-adic numbers should be hashable, all others can not implement a reasonable hash function. Currently some of them do which can cause horrible bugs:\n \n ```\n-sage: K.<a>=Qq(3^2)\n-sage: M=Matrix(K,1,1,1)\n-sage: print M\n+sage: @cached_function\n+....: def is_one(x):\n+....:     return x==1\n+\n+sage: R = Zp(3, 70)\n+sage: is_one(R(1,1))\n+True\n+sage: is_one(R(2^64))\n+True\n+sage: R(2^64)\n+1 + 2*3 + 2*3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 + 2*3^5 + 3^7 + 2*3^8 + 3^10 + 2*3^11 + 2*3^13 + 3^14 + 2*3^16 + 3^18 + 3^19 + 2*3^20 + 3^21 + 3^23 + 2*3^25 + 3^26 + 2*3^27 + 2*3^28 + 3^29 + 2*3^30 + 2*3^31 + 2*3^34 + 2*3^35 + 2*3^36 + 3^37 + 3^38 + 3^39 + 3^40 + O(3^70)\n ```\n \n+The problem here is that `==` has been changed so that two numbers are equal if they are equal to the least common precision. In this example, the two elements are equal to precision one and they have the same hash value (at least on my machine).\n+\n+The proposal of this ticket is to make p-adics unhashable (but cacheable through #16316). The modifications required for this to work are almost always related to functions which implemented manual caching through dictionaries. The long list of dependencies is mostly about rewriting constructor functions to go through `UniqueFactory` or `CachedRepresentation` which gets unhashable elements right as of #16317. (I believe that these changes are valuable refactorings anyway.)\n+\n+I can imagine that some people will not like such a change. What are the alternatives?\n+\n+* Keep it the way it is. (I do not think that this is a good idea. If you do intensive p-adic computations then the birthday paradox will eventually hit you.)\n+* Mark p-adics in a special way so their `==` is not used by `cached_method` and friends. (Not an option, because p-adics may be wrapped inside other objects which will still use their operator `==`.)\n+* Change `==` for p-adics to say whether two numbers are \"really\" equal. (Bad idea. Say you are in a p-adic field. Some algorithm wants to know whether `x` is invertible and says `x==0`. Now this will be false for most `p`-adic zeros.)\n+* Make `__hash__` return a constant. (This would work but will give horrible performance.)\n+* \u2026?\n``````\n",

-Extensions of p-adic numbers seem to be unhashable, and this becomes a problem when used in cached methods. For example, the following code raises a TypeError:
+Only fixed modulus p-adic numbers should be hashable, all others can not implement a reasonable hash function. Currently some of them do which can cause horrible bugs:
 
 ```
-sage: K.<a>=Qq(3^2)
-sage: M=Matrix(K,1,1,1)
-sage: print M
+sage: @cached_function
+....: def is_one(x):
+....:     return x==1
+
+sage: R = Zp(3, 70)
+sage: is_one(R(1,1))
+True
+sage: is_one(R(2^64))
+True
+sage: R(2^64)
+1 + 2*3 + 2*3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 + 2*3^5 + 3^7 + 2*3^8 + 3^10 + 2*3^11 + 2*3^13 + 3^14 + 2*3^16 + 3^18 + 3^19 + 2*3^20 + 3^21 + 3^23 + 2*3^25 + 3^26 + 2*3^27 + 2*3^28 + 3^29 + 2*3^30 + 2*3^31 + 2*3^34 + 2*3^35 + 2*3^36 + 3^37 + 3^38 + 3^39 + 3^40 + O(3^70)
 ```
 
+The problem here is that `==` has been changed so that two numbers are equal if they are equal to the least common precision. In this example, the two elements are equal to precision one and they have the same hash value (at least on my machine).
+
+The proposal of this ticket is to make p-adics unhashable (but cacheable through #16316). The modifications required for this to work are almost always related to functions which implemented manual caching through dictionaries. The long list of dependencies is mostly about rewriting constructor functions to go through `UniqueFactory` or `CachedRepresentation` which gets unhashable elements right as of #16317. (I believe that these changes are valuable refactorings anyway.)
+
+I can imagine that some people will not like such a change. What are the alternatives?
+
+* Keep it the way it is. (I do not think that this is a good idea. If you do intensive p-adic computations then the birthday paradox will eventually hit you.)
+* Mark p-adics in a special way so their `==` is not used by `cached_method` and friends. (Not an option, because p-adics may be wrapped inside other objects which will still use their operator `==`.)
+* Change `==` for p-adics to say whether two numbers are "really" equal. (Bad idea. Say you are in a p-adic field. Some algorithm wants to know whether `x` is invertible and says `x==0`. Now this will be false for most `p`-adic zeros.)
+* Make `__hash__` return a constant. (This would work but will give horrible performance.)
+* â€¦?

Ok, I hadn't thought about that. But IMHO thats more of an issue with having two separate and competing ways of specifying precision, one in the parent and one in the element:

```
sage: O(3).parent()(3)
3 + O(3^21)
```

I don't have a good answer right now either, but it once again shows the importance of this issue. We need to fix our failure to adhere to Python's convention about comparison and hashes.

Is it really about competing ways? I guess this happens because it is possible to specify precision in the element at all.
