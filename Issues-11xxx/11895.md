Only fixed modulus p-adic numbers should be hashable, all others can not implement a reasonable hash function. Currently some of them do which can cause horrible bugs:

```
sage: @cached_function
....: def is_one(x):
....:     return x==1

sage: R = Zp(3, 70)
sage: is_one(R(1,1))
True
sage: is_one(R(2^64))
True
sage: R(2^64)
1 + 2*3 + 2*3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 + 2*3^5 + 3^7 + 2*3^8 + 3^10 + 2*3^11 + 2*3^13 + 3^14 + 2*3^16 + 3^18 + 3^19 + 2*3^20 + 3^21 + 3^23 + 2*3^25 + 3^26 + 2*3^27 + 2*3^28 + 3^29 + 2*3^30 + 2*3^31 + 2*3^34 + 2*3^35 + 2*3^36 + 3^37 + 3^38 + 3^39 + 3^40 + O(3^70)
```

The problem here is that `==` has been changed so that two numbers are equal if they are equal to the least common precision. In this example, the two elements are equal to precision one and they have the same hash value (at least on my machine).

The proposal of this ticket is to make p-adics unhashable (but cacheable through #16316). The modifications required for this to work are almost always related to functions which implemented manual caching through dictionaries. The long list of dependencies is mostly about rewriting constructor functions to go through `UniqueFactory` or `CachedRepresentation` which gets unhashable elements right as of #16317. (I believe that these changes are valuable refactorings anyway.)

I can imagine that some people will not like such a change. What are the alternatives?

* Keep it the way it is. (I do not think that this is a good idea. If you do intensive p-adic computations then the birthday paradox will eventually hit you.)
* Mark p-adics in a special way so their `==` is not used by `cached_method` and friends. (Not an option, because p-adics may be wrapped inside other objects which will still use their operator `==`.)
* Change `==` for p-adics to say whether two numbers are "really" equal. (Bad idea. Say you are in a p-adic field. Some algorithm wants to know whether `x` is invertible and says `x==0`. Now this will be false for most `p`-adic zeros.)
* Make `__hash__` return a constant. (This would work but will give horrible performance.)

<a id='comment:6'></a>Three remarks:

This will lead to very confusing situation where a dict lookup doesn't find your key, but you know you have a key that's equal to a stored one.

- Caching functions on equality of arguments is a very bad idea with the p-adics. If I construct a known invertible matrix to too low a precision, I'll get determinant 0. If subsequently I construct the same matrix to higher precision, a cached determinant function would recognize the argument as equal to one he'd seem before (because equality is only to lowest common precision) and would just give me the 0 back. 

Properties 2 and 3 conspire to hide the problem a bit:

```
sage: @cached_function
....: def DISC(f):
....:         return discriminant(f)
....: 
sage: K=Qp(2,500)
sage: P.<x>=K[]
sage: f=(1+O(2^200))*x^2-(2^200+O(2^200))
sage: DISC(f)
0
sage: g=(1+O(2^300))*x^2-(2^200+O(2^300))
sage: DISC(g)
2^202 + O(2^302)
sage: 
sage: hash(f), hash(g)
(15360174650385708, 15377766836429868)
sage: f == g
True
```
so the entry under f isn't found when looking up g because they end up being stored in different bins, so the difference in hash is enough to distinguish them. As soon as the dictionary gets resized in a way that lets those two hashes end up in the same bin, it'll be a toss-up which answer you get back from either `DISC(f)` or `DISC(g)`. Oh course, by then it will be very painful to track down what happened.

To show that functions that depend on more of their arguments than just equality should not be cached:

```
sage: a=3
sage: b=GF(5)(3)
sage: @cached_function
....: def test(a):
....:         return a^2
....: 
sage: [test(a),test(b)]
[9, 9]
sage: test.clear_cache()
sage: [test(b),test(a)]
[4, 4]
```

> I'm not sure I understand. Say you are in Qp with 2 digits of precision. Then 0 coerces to `O(p^2)`. Setting `x=O(p)` gives `x != 0` when including precisions in the comparison.


Ok, I hadn't thought about that. But IMHO thats more of an issue with having two separate and competing ways of specifying precision, one in the parent and one in the element:

```
sage: O(3).parent()(3)
3 + O(3^21)
```

I don't have a good answer right now either, but it once again shows the importance of this issue. We need to fix our failure to adhere to Python's convention about comparison and hashes.

Is it really about competing ways? I guess this happens because it is possible to specify precision in the element at all.

The problem is that sometimes you want `a==b` to mean, `a` is essentially the same as `b`, say in an algorithm that doese `while(x!=0)`, and sometimes to you want it to mean `a` is indistinguishable from `b`. The latter is maybe what you want in dictionary lookups.
