```
For zero-column matrices, LLL crashes:

```
sage: matrix(ZZ,0,2).LLL()
^C^C^C^C^C
```
Its particularly annoying that keyboard interrupt does not work.


Really, the issue is that fpLLL can't handle zero-row matrices and apparently corrupts the stack:

```
sage: from sage.libs.fplll.fplll import FP_LLL
sage: A = matrix(ZZ, 0, 2)
sage: fp = FP_LLL(A)
sage: fp.fast()
^C^C^C^C
```

The attached patch short-circuits LLL for degenerate matrices and will make fpLLL raise a `ValueError` if the matrix has zero rows.

Interesting.  On sage-4.7.1.alpha3, I actually get:

```
sage: matrix(ZZ,0,2).LLL()
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.
