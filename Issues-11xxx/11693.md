The edge is being added twice which clearly causes a problem.  It gets taken care of in the case that `multiedges=False`, or if the edges are labelled, though I'm still not sure why the edges are added twice there as well.

What about just testing "v == u" immediately before "data[v].append(u)" ?

The problem with multiedges is that the problem is not well defined. What should be done when the input is :

* (1, 2), (2, 1)
* (1, 2), (1, 2)
* (1, 2, None), (1, 2, None)
* (1, 2, 'a'), (2, 1, 'a')
* (1, 2, 'a'), (2, 1, 'b')

And the same with dictionaries...

* { 1 : [2], 2 : [1] }
* { 1 : [2,2]}
* ...

That would solve the loop case, but then there is no way to specify only one edge in a multiedge graph.  Right now if you add `(1,2)` as an edge there will be two edges between 1 and 2. If you add `(1,2),(2,1)` there will be four and so on.  Try the examples from the doctest in the patch and you'll see what I mean.

I think these should all add two edges with the possible exceptions of those which have the same label i.e. `(1, 2, None), (1, 2, None)` and `(1, 2, 'a'), (2, 1, 'a')`.

This is a little more tricky, but the second should definitely add 2 edges, and I suppose the first should add 2 as well, though it's fuzzier to me.

I agree some of this is perhaps non-intuitive and I'm open to be convinced, but I think adding twice as many edges is not good.  :-)

Well, I agree that this patch should be merged, but I really think that these parameters are a mess. If I were to use it myself I think I would use add_edge instead of using the constructor as it looks mostly unreliable (surprising behaviour on some inputs) `:-/`

The patch is good to go, though ! `:-)`
