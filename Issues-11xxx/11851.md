Are these errors important?  The installation proceeds, apparently successfully, after this.

Second, would it be better to have three separate spkgs, one each for pybtex, PyYAML, and pyparsing?

Third, should the file `patches/pybtex-doc_tree.patch.org` be deleted?  I see a reference to it in SPKG.txt, but why do we need it?  It might be better just to give the link to the original patch and then say that it has been rebased.  Rebasing is the only change, right?

PyYAML Supports libYAML for speed reasons only, so you can ignore these messages. But I removed libYAML support from the SPKG (I will update the link soon), so that nobody gets confused.

sagenb also includes its dependencies. It would be too much trouble to maintain three different SPKGs.

We don't know, if the link will change or will be unavailable some day. Burcin thought, it would probably be safer like this.

This installed correctly, even though I disabled internet access while installing it. So that's good.

Regarding SPKG.txt: surely Python is a dependency. You should make this explicit, so that if/when this becomes a standard package, people where it goes in the makefile `spkg/standard/deps`. Also, I would add a little bit to the description; for example,

+Pybtex is a drop-in replacement for BibTeX written in Python. That is,

 We use the bazaar trunk because it is less buggy and more feature-rich.
 The latest version is available through this command:

When I ran this on a file, I got this error message:

but maybe I don't have things configured correctly...

It might be a good idea to write an spkg-check script, which does nothing if `nose` is not installed, but runs self-tests if it is. This is not very important right now, but if you have a chance...

Thanks for checking, updated the spkg with your suggestions.

What exactly did you do? I cannot reproduce the error.

I don't think that is possible. Maybe when nose becomes an [optional package](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9921). But at the moment, when nose is installed on the system, sage can run the `nosetests` command, but python won't find nose:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/nosetests", line 5, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
  File "/home/niels/mfo/sage-5.0/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/distribute-0.6.16-py2.7.egg/pkg_resources.py", line 2672, in <module>
    working_set.require(__requires__)
  File "/home/niels/mfo/sage-5.0/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/distribute-0.6.16-py2.7.egg/pkg_resources.py", line 655, in require
    needed = self.resolve(parse_requirements(requirements))
  File "/home/niels/mfo/sage-5.0/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/distribute-0.6.16-py2.7.egg/pkg_resources.py", line 553, in resolve
    raise DistributionNotFound(req)
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: nose==1.1.2
```
That error occurs when running `nosetests` in `sage -sh` or `spkg-check` with nose installed on my system.

Thanks, didn't know about that.

Regarding nose, I was thinking of something like this in spkg-check:

```sh
if [ -x "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/nosetests" ]; then
    # RUN TESTS HERE.
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then  # REPLACE WITH SUITABLE CHECK THAT TESTS PASSED.
        echo >&2 "Error running tests."
        exit 1
    fi
else
    echo "Not running tests since nose is not installed."
fi
```
Or you could replace the first line with a test for the suitable library in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python/site-packages`, say by running a little python script.
