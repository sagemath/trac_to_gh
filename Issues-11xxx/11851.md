Should be a standard spkg later, so that the [citation system](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/3317) can use it.

libyaml is not found or a compiler error: forcing --without-libyaml

 specify the option --include-dirs or uncomment and
 modify the parameter include_dirs in setup.cfg)
zip_safe flag not set; analyzing archive contents...
Adding PyYAML 3.10 to easy-install.pth file

Are these errors important?  The installation proceeds, apparently successfully, after this.

Second, would it be better to have three separate spkgs, one each for pybtex, PyYAML, and pyparsing?

Third, should the file `patches/pybtex-doc_tree.patch.org` be deleted?  I see a reference to it in SPKG.txt, but why do we need it?  It might be better just to give the link to the original patch and then say that it has been rebased.  Rebasing is the only change, right?

PyYAML Supports libYAML for speed reasons only, so you can ignore these messages. But I removed libYAML support from the SPKG (I will update the link soon), so that nobody gets confused.

sagenb also includes its dependencies. It would be too much trouble to maintain three different SPKGs.

We don't know, if the link will change or will be unavailable some day. Burcin thought, it would probably be safer like this.

What exactly did you do? I cannot reproduce the error.

> It might be a good idea to write an spkg-check script, which does nothing if `nose` is not installed, but runs self-tests if it is. This is not very important right now, but if you have a chance...

I don't think that is possible. Maybe when nose becomes an [optional package](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9921). But at the moment, when nose is installed on the system, sage can run the `nosetests` command, but python won't find nose:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/nosetests", line 5, in <module>

```
That error occurs when running `nosetests` in `sage -sh` or `spkg-check` with nose installed on my system.

Regarding nose, I was thinking of something like this in spkg-check:

```sh
if [ -x "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/nosetests" ]; then
    # RUN TESTS HERE.
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then  # REPLACE WITH SUITABLE CHECK THAT TESTS PASSED.
        echo >&2 "Error running tests."

Yes, that looks good now. Regarding spkg-install, you don't really need to create and delete the directory `tmp`: I think you can just unzip and build !PyYAML-3.10.zip in place:

But this is not very important; it works either way.

So if you upgrade the spkg to use your new version of SPKG.txt, you can switch this to "positive review".
