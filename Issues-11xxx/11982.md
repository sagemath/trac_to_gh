The following used to work in sage 4.4.4

```
P2.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
d=7
C=Curve(x^3 + y^3 - d*z^3)
E=EllipticCurve([0,-432*d^2])
transformation=[(36*d*z-y)/(72*d),(36*d*z+y)/(72*d),x/(12*d)] 
phi = E.hom(transformation,C) #this used to work 
```

```
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
