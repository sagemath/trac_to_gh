```
The global_height function for elements of number fields gives incorrect results. Here is an example:

```
sage: K.<s> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: s.global_height()
0.346573590279973
sage: (1/s).global_height()
0.693147180559945
```

This is incorrect since s and 1/s should have the same height. I'm running Sage 4.7 on Mac OS X 10.6.8.

I believe the reason for the error is explained in the author's comments in the code for this function:

"The absolute logarithmic height of this number field element; that is, the sum of the local heights at all finite and infinite places, with the contributions from the infinite places scaled by the degree to make the result independent of the parent field."

However, it is both the arch. and non-arch. contributions that need to be scaled by the degree.

A doctest is some test contained in the documentation of a function. Just do:

```
sage: K.<s> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: s.global_height?
```
You should now see documentation on how to use the global height. The examples like:

```
          sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
          sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^4+3*x^2-17)
          sage: b = a/2
          sage: b.global_height()
          2.869222240687...
          sage: b.global_height(prec=200)
          2.8692222406879748488543678846959454765968722137813736080066
```

If you have problems building Sage ask questions on sage-devel, not here.

Read the developers' guide for instructions on how to write doctests and make patches, etc.  And I suggest that you don't post a patch until you have tested it which you obviously cannot do until you have your own development build up and running.
