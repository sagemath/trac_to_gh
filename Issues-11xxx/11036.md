Currently `solve_mod(x^2==41, 100)` breaks this down into solving modulus `2^2 and 5^2`, but it doesn't do further reductions, so it actually loops over 4 and 25 possibilities directly.  This works well for small exponents:

```
sage: time solve_mod(x^2 == 41, 10^2) 
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s Wall time: 0.01 s 
[(29,), (21,), (79,), (71,)] 
```

but performs poorly on larger ones, even if the primes involved are small:

```
sage: time solve_mod(x^2 == 41, 10^6)
CPU times: user 0.86 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.87 s Wall time: 0.99 s 
[(703821,), (452429,), (47571,), (796179,), (203821,), (952429,), (547571,), (296179,)]
```

Agreed that this is a place we need better work.  It's been fairly low priority, as you can see.  Ideas?  Hensel's Lemma?

This patch doesn't attempt to do anything sophisticated, it simply reaches for the low-hanging fruit:

(1) It modifies solve_mod_enumerate so that if the modulus is `5^100`, instead of iterating over `5^100` possibilities, it finds solutions mod 5, then uses those to find solutions mod `5^2`, etc. 

(2) It modifies solve_mod to short-circuit in some cases.

(3) It also makes an unrelated change: currently solve_mod(x==1, 1) returns [()], but should probably return [(0,)].

The change has little effect for small moduli but wins easily on anything nontrivial:

```
#OLD 
sage: time solve_mod(x^2==41, 10^7)
CPU times: user 4.21 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 4.27 s
Wall time: 4.33 s
[(3703821,), (1452429,), (3547571,), (1296179,), (8703821,), (6452429,), (8547571,), (6296179,)]
```

```
# NEW 
sage: time solve_mod(x^2==41, 10^7)
CPU times: user 0.04 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.04 s
Wall time: 0.04 s
[(3703821,), (1452429,), (3547571,), (1296179,), (8703821,), (6452429,), (8547571,), (6296179,)]
```

It still behaves very badly for large primes, but a lot better than the current approach on powers of small primes.  This
includes my use case of powers of 10-- there was an OEIS sequence I was extending which I had to do manually because solve_mod was too slow, and it irritated me that Mma could do it quickly..

Beyond the doctests I've tested it for small-coefficient univariate polynomials of order <= 5 with modulus <= 12, and for lots of random multivariate polynomials.  Tests were against a four-line brute force solver.  Probably I've missed something, though, so more tests would be appreciated!

I did a rebase but also have managed to mess up my 4.7.1.rc[01] builds while testing other tickets, so no guarantees...

The code seems to assume that the expressions is a polynomial (in one or more variables), so there should definitely be a more efficient way to do the enumeration of solutions modulo prime powers -- this should be a linear (algebra mod p) problem once the solutions mod p are known, right?
