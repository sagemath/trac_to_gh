Currently `solve_mod(x^2==41, 100)` breaks this down into solving modulus `2^2 and 5^2`, but it doesn't do further reductions, so it actually loops over 4 and 25 possibilities directly.  This works well for small exponents:

```
sage: time solve_mod(x^2 == 41, 10^2) 
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s Wall time: 0.01 s 
[(29,), (21,), (79,), (71,)] 
```

but performs poorly on larger ones, even if the primes involved are small:

```
sage: time solve_mod(x^2 == 41, 10^6)
CPU times: user 0.86 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.87 s Wall time: 0.99 s 
[(703821,), (452429,), (47571,), (796179,), (203821,), (952429,), (547571,), (296179,)]
```

This patch doesn't attempt to do anything sophisticated, it simply reaches for the low-hanging fruit:

(1) It modifies solve_mod_enumerate so that if the modulus is `5^100`, instead of iterating over `5^100` possibilities, it finds solutions mod 5, then uses those to find solutions mod `5^2`, etc. 

(2) It modifies solve_mod to short-circuit in some cases.

(3) It also makes an unrelated change: currently solve_mod(x==1, 1) returns [()], but should probably return [(0,)].

The change has little effect for small moduli but wins easily on anything nontrivial:

```
#OLD 
sage: time solve_mod(x^2==41, 10^7)
CPU times: user 4.21 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 4.27 s
Wall time: 4.33 s
[(3703821,), (1452429,), (3547571,), (1296179,), (8703821,), (6452429,), (8547571,), (6296179,)]
```

```
# NEW 
sage: time solve_mod(x^2==41, 10^7)
CPU times: user 0.04 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.04 s
Wall time: 0.04 s
[(3703821,), (1452429,), (3547571,), (1296179,), (8703821,), (6452429,), (8547571,), (6296179,)]
```

It still behaves very badly for large primes, but a lot better than the current approach on powers of small primes.  This
includes my use case of powers of 10-- there was an OEIS sequence I was extending which I had to do manually because solve_mod was too slow, and it irritated me that Mma could do it quickly..

Beyond the doctests I've tested it for small-coefficient univariate polynomials of order <= 5 with modulus <= 12, and for lots of random multivariate polynomials.  Tests were against a four-line brute force solver.  Probably I've missed something, though, so more tests would be appreciated!

I did a rebase but also have managed to mess up my 4.7.1.rc[01] builds while testing other tickets, so no guarantees...

The code seems to assume that the expressions is a polynomial (in one or more variables), so there should definitely be a more efficient way to do the enumeration of solutions modulo prime powers -- this should be a linear (algebra mod p) problem once the solutions mod p are known, right?
