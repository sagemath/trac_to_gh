`sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/gal_reps.py` has code to compute a splitting field, but that clearly does not belong to elliptic curves. This is used to compute the division field. We should use the new `splitting_field()` function from #2217 to implement this. We should make it work also over number fields.

Depends on #2217

I can easily do number fields, very general fields would be harder.

At least I could add it as a comment in the code.\n\nProof.   For all P in E[p] and all Galois autos sigma (of K-bar over K) we have sigma(P)=+/-P since x(sigma(P))=sigma(x(P))=x(P).  Let P1, P2 be a basis for E[p].  For each sigma we have sigma(P1)=+/-P1 and sigma(P2)=+/-P2 and the signs are the *same* otherwise sigma(P1+P2) could not equal either +(P1+P2) or -(P1+P2).  So the image of sigma in the mod p Galois representation is either the identity or minus the identity.  In the first case, sigma fixes all points in E[p], in the second case it negates all of them.  So if the Galois rep is not trivial, its image has order 2 and its kernel cuts out a quadratic extension, say L/K.  In the latter case the non-trivial element sigma of Gal(L/K) maps to -1 which means that sigma(P)=-P for *all* P in E[p].\n\nI don't know a reference!",

> > I know that this is not yet marked as ready for review, but I did look at the code anyway.  One minor remark:  after adjoining all the x-coordinates of the p-division points, *either* you have the full division field already, i.e. you have all the y-coordinates, *or* you have none, i.e. you have none of the y-coordinates.  This could be used, possibly, to simplify that last part of the division field code.  But it is not clear to me that there is a quicker way of determining that final quadratic extension than picking any of the x-coordinates of a p-division point and solving for y.

> Not that I don't believe you, but do you have a reference for this? At least I could add it as a comment in the code.

Proof.   For all P in E[p] and all Galois autos sigma (of K-bar over K) we have sigma(P)=+/-P since x(sigma(P))=sigma(x(P))=x(P).  Let P1, P2 be a basis for E[p].  For each sigma we have sigma(P1)=+/-P1 and sigma(P2)=+/-P2 and the signs are the *same* otherwise sigma(P1+P2) could not equal either +(P1+P2) or -(P1+P2).  So the image of sigma in the mod p Galois representation is either the identity or minus the identity.  In the first case, sigma fixes all points in E[p], in the second case it negates all of them.  So if the Galois rep is not trivial, its image has order 2 and its kernel cuts out a quadratic extension, say L/K.  In the latter case the non-trivial element sigma of Gal(L/K) maps to -1 which means that sigma(P)=-P for *all* P in E[p].

I don't know a reference!

I was expecting to be able to pull the new commit on top of the old one, but that failed (merge conflict I think).  I just deleted the branch I had and made a new one.

Thanks for the new example, which do exactly what I wanted.  I read through the code again, and like it, and tested all of Sage with this commit as well as some of my own examples.
