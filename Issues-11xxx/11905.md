`sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/gal_reps.py` has code to compute a splitting field, but that clearly does not belong to elliptic curves. This is used to compute the division field. We should use the new `splitting_field()` function from #2217 to implement this. We should make it work also over number fields.

I can easily do number fields, very general fields would be harder.

This could be used, possibly, to simplify that last part of the division field code.

So if the Galois rep is not trivial, its image has order 2 and its kernel cuts out a quadratic extension, say L/K.  In the latter case the non-trivial element sigma of Gal(L/K) maps to -1 which means that sigma(P)=-P for *all* P in E[p].
