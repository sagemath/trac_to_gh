`sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/gal_reps.py` has code to compute a splitting field, but that clearly does not belong to elliptic curves. This is used to compute the division field. We should use the new `splitting_field()` function from #2217 to implement this. We should make it work also over number fields.

I can easily do number fields, very general fields would be harder.

I was expecting to be able to pull the new commit on top of the old one, but that failed (merge conflict I think).  I just deleted the branch I had and made a new one.

Thanks for the new example, which do exactly what I wanted.  I read through the code again, and like it, and tested all of Sage with this commit as well as some of my own examples.
