On various 64-bit x86_64 Linux machines (for example, the Skynet machine eno), sage-4.7.alpha5 built with gcc-4.6.0 fails various tests with a timeout:

```
sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/graphs/graph_generators.py # Time out
sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/graphs/graph_coloring.py # Time out
sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/graphs/graph.py # Time out
sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/graphs/cliquer.pyx # Time out
```

The problem can be seen by executing the following command, which should take milliseconds but simply hangs instead:

```
sage: clique_number(Graph({0:[1,2,3], 1:[2], 3:[0,1]}))
```

New spkg adding flag `-fno-ivopts`: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/cliquer-1.2.p9.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/cliquer-1.2.p9.spkg)

Fixed upstream: [http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48774](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48774)

For other gcc 4.6.0 specific problems see #11216.

The following code triggers the problem (code does not return):

```
sage: g = graphs.BidiakisCube();
sage: g.clique_number()
```

If cliquer-1.2.p7.spkg is rebuilt with -O1 rather than -O2, then
the problem goes away.

Apologies for not mentioning this.  I see the problem on 
skynet:eno (x86_64-Linux-core2).  I have not checked to see
if the problem exists on other architectures.
