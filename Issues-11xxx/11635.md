In #11547, we added copying of several needed dlls on Cygwin.  However, in the meantime NTL had a fairly major update (#5731).

From version 5.5, NTL provides a new build system using libtool (although libtool itself is not provided!) to generate shared libraries.
On Cygwin, libtool properly install the shared library as cygntl-?.dll in the bin directory and the import file as libntl.dll.a in the lib directory, together with a libtool file libntl.la and a static version of the library as libntl.a.

In particular, this ensures that the shared version is linked with by default because ld/gcc/g++ find the .dll.a file in the lib directory (which points to the dll file in the bin directory) before the .a file.

Moreover, only moving the previously built libntl.dll to libntl.dll.a was not a solution.
Indeed, the built file hardcoded its own build-time name into itself (as a DT_SONAME on linux), so that libraries linked to it (before or after renaming, does not matter) would in fact search for a file with the build time name... and fail.

This spkg vastly simplifies the old spkg-install, uses the (slightly patched) upstream build system and includes its own version of libtool (or rather the tools needed to generate it on the fly).

No guarantees on whether this works, or even is necessary (!) but I strongly suspect both.  You'll know it works if you do everything at #6743, including this, and then Sage has a segfault on startup.

In case there is any doubt that this is Cygwin-only:

                # can build even if gmp is not built locally
                # i.e., even if using a system-wide gmp.
                # (though it has to be in /usr/lib, which is
                # where it is for cygwin).
                ln  -s /usr/lib/*gmp* .
                ln  -s libgmp.dll.a libgmp.a
            fi 
        else
   	    ln -s "$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libgmp.a" .
        fi
	$MAKE libntl.dll
        if [ ! -f libntl.dll ]; then
            echo "Error creating ntl shared library."
            exit 1
        fi
	cp libntl.dll "$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libntl.dll.a"
	cp libntl.dll "$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libntl.dll"

	cp libntl.dll "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/libntl.dll"
        if [ ! -f "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/libntl.dll.a" ]; then
            exit 1   # CRUCIAL that we have the dynamic link library
        fi

Interestingly, the most recent alpha I tested all the Cygwin stuff on a few weeks ago already had NTL 5.5.2!  

```
$ ls spkg/installed
<snip>
ntl-5.5.2
<snip>
```
and it seemed to work fine (in the sense that it got to the Pari segfault when initializing).

That doesn't mean that later in the process things wouldn't happen, but at least for now this ticket can be lower priority, if it's needed at all, since we have to figure out how to get past that error first.

Oh, and no longer 'needs info', because #12104 shows that it's needed to start Sage.

Why does one need copies in local/bin ?
And why does one need to copy rather than to create a symbolic link?

No idea!  I just copied models from other spkgs.  Feel free to only copy and/or make links where actually appropriate.  I have never claimed to be anything close to an expert; I've only focused on getting it to work by following other spkgs I've seen.

Just for posterity (addressing the comments at #12104, perhaps?), here is the rationale for naming it dll.a, from #9050.

```
This is so that Cygwin will find the shared library before it finds the static library; otherwise, there are lots of segfaults in Sage under Cygwin

that means that only in the cases when both static and dynamic libraries are built, this is needed.
IMHO there are not so many such cases among Sage spkg's.

IMHO, this is, at best, a bad hack. In principle, *.dll.a files are import libraries for *.dll libaries, 
used by the linker to like against *.dll (i.e. dynamic libraries).

```

It's probably OK to have "real" (i.e.  dynamic libs, not misnamed dll.a or other files) .dlls in local/bin/, and bad to have them in local/lib/. At least that's what a Cygwin-aware libtool will be doing.

I think the better solution would be to use the libtool build system the latest version of NTL propose.

Anyway, I found it quite strange that csage.dll wants a file called libntl.dll although only a file called libntl.dll.a was available at link time.
Maybe there is a kind of DT_SONAME hidden in the NTL shared library.

There is indeed a linbntl.dll string within the shared library, so that may be it.
Try
strings libntl.dll | grep libntl.dll

Anyway, using libtool should solves our problem.
At least I have previously built NTL properly with that on Cygwin and Linux.
Let's hope it does not break on other systems.

It could be that some of your already build dlls are still linked with libntl.dll (which should still be inexistant if you did not copy it by hand earlier).
You can check that by cygchecking some of them, sage/rings/... should be good culprits or sage/libs/ntl....
So you should rebuild all these broken dlls.
Unfortunately I'm not sure yet how to easily automagically make them rebuild (as sage -b will not).
I'm currently seeing if touching sage/libs/ntl/decl.pxi is enough to trigger that rebuild.
Some spkg depending on NTL may be broken as well...

The easiest solution would be to rebuild from scratch...

The spkg does not build. It ends up with rather weird message:

```

```

And indeed, my gcc is 4.5.3, and I have stuff in `/usr/lib/gcc/i686-pc-cygwin/4.5.3/`, but no

By the way, touching decl.pxi in sage/libs/ntl and then running "sage -b" seems to have fixed my install.
At least Sage starts now without import errors.

not for me - I still needed to copy SAGELOCAL/bin/libntl.dll.a to SAGELOCAL/bin/libntl.dll to get past import errors.

Then, the usual fork() problems on startup, and rebaseall does not help. I am afraid we're back to the root of the problem. I'll try to rebuild from scratch one more time, but this doesn't look good.

I also rebuild some spkg, at least flint, don't remember exactly which ones, could you check every dll? Writing such a script would be less time consuming than rebuilding Sage from scratch (and I did not have to rebase by the way).
It would be really strange that some files still link to libntl.dll with a fresh instlal, as there is definitely no reference to such a file name with the new spkg, nor in other pieces of Sage.

Once again, I think that the problem before was just that there was some kind of DT_SONAME (which usually point to a "real" filename to use for a library at runtime) in the library buid by NTL.
As the library was originally build as libntl.dll, this DT_SONAME was set to libntl.dll, so even though the library was rename to libntl.dll.a after installing and so was found before the static archive when we link to NTL, at runtime the pieces of Sage linked to it would look to libntl.dll.

With the new spkg libntl.dll never sees the light of day, so there is no reason something else thinks it has ever existed, or will.

And yes unfortunately, libtool is used on every platform, not only on Cygwin, the good point is that we use the upstream NTL build system rather than the one that was made only for Sage by Sage devs before it was more or less integrated with the help of the same people to NTL itself (although with a dependency on libtool).
Nevertheless, libtool should only be 4 text files, so I'm looking for a way to integrate it to the spkg right now.
Another solution is to continue with the Sage patched build system and add a proper linking line for Cygwin.

This might be due to the fact that I tried to follow your instruction to rebase everything in SAGEROOT rather than in SAGELOCAL, i.e. in SAGEROOT/local/, as I did before.

To rebuild all spkgs that depend on NTL you can do

```sh
$ touch spkg/installed/ntl-*  # Of course not needed if you just (re)built it
$ env SAGE_UPGRADING=yes make build
```

You *may* still have to run `./sage -ba-force` afterwards; not sure whether `module_list.py` really covers all dependencies (on NTL in this case, but probably indirect dependencies as well).

Should still be faster than rebuilding all from scratch... ;-)

 In #11547, we added copying of several needed dlls on Cygwin.  However, in the meantime NTL had a fairly major update (#5731).
 
-Based on this, this ticket splits off the NTL change from #11547 so that that ticket can get merged.  
+From version 5.5, NTL provides a new build system using libtool (although libtool itself is not provided!) to generate shared libraries.
+On Cygwin, libtool properly install the shared library as cygntl-?.dll in the bin directory and the import file as libntl.dll.a in the lib directory, together with a libtool file libntl.la and a static version of the library as libntl.a.
 
-Spkg at [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/ntl-5.5.2.p0.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/ntl-5.5.2.p0.spkg).
+In particular, this ensures that the shared version is linked with by default because ld/gcc/g++ find the .dll.a file in the lib directory (which points to the dll file in the bin directory) before the .a file.
 
-Here is the previous diff - presumably we would do the same thing if we can confirm it is still necessary, which is almost certainly the case.
+Moreover, only moving the previously built libntl.dll to libntl.dll.a was not a solution.
+Indeed, the built file hardcoded its own build-time name into itself (as a DT_SONAME on linux), so that libraries linked to it (before or after renaming, does not matter) would in fact search for a file with the build time name... and fail.

<div id="comment:53" align="right">comment:53</div>

I'll give it another try:
Since version 5.5, NTL officially supports building a shared version of the library, but this require a system-wide installation of libtool(... be also aware that no other parts of autotools are used or required, there are only calls to "libtool -mode=link ..." in the Makefile, which is generated by a custom configure script):
see http://www.shoup.net/ntl/doc/tour-unix.html#shared

The Sage spkg was crafted before that new build system, and build shared libraries by patching the NTL old build system and defining custom targets.

The problem is that on Cygwin this patched build system installs a shared libntl.dll and static libntl.a and the .a files gets picked up by default by the linker when -lntl is passed, whereas we would want the .dll file to be picked.
A previous proposed workaround was to copy libntl.dll.a to libntl.dll.a (.dll.a corresponds to import files and are picked up before .a files by the linker) but that's more of a hack than a real fix.

So we have to solution:
- continue with our patched build system and modify the cygwin target to build a proper import file and install it with the shared .dll and static .a files
- use NTL libtool based build system, but that requires to be able to include the needed piece to generate libtool (not libtoolize), that is ltmain.sh, install-sh, config.guess and config.sub as mentioned at http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Distributing.html#Distributing (or to make a system-wide libtool a Sage dependency, which looks to be a bad idea).
IIRC to use libtoolize to generate these 4 files would need some skeleton autotools project (i.e. a nearly empty configure.ac or Makefile.am and IIRC that's how I generated the four libtool files, just putting the strict minimal set of autotools macros in one of these two files).

There is no need for soft links and/or copying files and/or renaming them.

Using libtool, the upstream build system install the following files on Cygwin:
* lib/libntl.la (libtool magical file)
* lib/libntl.dll.a (import file for the dynamic library)
* lib/libntl.a (static archive)
* bin/cygntl.dll (dynamic library)
(some -<version> are surely missing here)

When using -lntl, ld will find first libntl.dll.a and in the end link to the dynamic library cygntl.dll.
The only difference with linking directly to cygntl.dll (let's say by specifying its path rather than just -lntl) is that the linking will be a slower, but that's not really an issue, everything is already so slow on Cygwin, I don't think the difference is noticeable.

On other systems the difference in file installed are minimal and will surely go unnoticed and the shared library will still gets picked up first.
