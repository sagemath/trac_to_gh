```
for univariate polynomials we have the class `Polynomial`:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: isinstance(x+1, Polynomial)
True
```
However for multivariate polynomials we have to write:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: isinstance(x+y, sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial.MPolynomial)
True
```
I suggest `MPolynomial` is defined as an alias for
`sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial.MPolynomial` so that we can simply write:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: isinstance(x+y, MPolynomial)
True
```

I think this needs to be discussed on [sage-devel]. Many people are pushing for less stuff in the global namespace so we cannot just add stuff without asking first.

Martin, feel free to forward to sage-devel, since I am not subscribed.

On the other hand for coherence one could replace `Polynomial`
by `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring.Polynomial`.
