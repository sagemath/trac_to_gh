Here it is ! It cost me several nights along with my first evening in Belgium, but it works ! `;-)`

This patch implements a new interface between Sage and Gurobi (http://www.gurobi.com)

YEAH !

(and now I'm going out ! `:-D`)

It's great that this powerful solver (for which one can get a free academic license) can now be used from inside Sage.
