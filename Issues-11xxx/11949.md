Here it is ! It cost me several nights along with my first evening in Belgium, but it works ! `;-)`

This patch implements a new interface between Sage and Gurobi (http://www.gurobi.com)

YEAH !

I tried this patch in 4.8.alpha0 for many examples, for which I previously used the Coin-cbc solver or the standalone versions of scip and gurobi via the mps-export of the linear program.

It's great that this powerful solver (for which one can get a free academic license) can now be used from inside Sage.
