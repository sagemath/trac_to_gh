That example works fine on most platforms; according to the buildbot, t2, mark and mark2 are the only exceptions.

Oleksander and Hannes from the Singular team replied. Apparently, there should be tables in the folder `SAGE_ROOT/local/share/singular/gftables` (or perhaps in `SAGE_ROOT/local/LIB/gftables`).

In my Sage installation on mark, there is a gftables directory, but it only contains a table for the field of size 10201.

I am not sure whether the tables should already be created when Singular is built, or only when a field of a particular size is first created (I asked the Singular team a few minues ago).

According to the Singular manual, Singular allows all field sizes below `2^16`. Looking at the gftables directory of my installation on my linux computer, clearly there are less tables than field sizes. So, I guess that the tables are only created when needed.

But why is Singular not able to? It seems that `SINGULARPATH` is available:

```
sage: [(s,v) for s,v in os.environ.iteritems() if 'SINGULAR' in s]
[('SINGULAR_EXECUTABLE', '/home/simonking/SAGE/sage-4.7.1.rc1mark/local/bin/Singular'), ('SINGULARPATH', '/home/simonking/SAGE/sage-4.7.1.rc1mark/local/share/singular')]

In other words: If one constructs a polynomial ring over a finite non-prime field and converts it into Singular, then the missing file in the gftables-folder is created!

In other words: If nothing else helps then one could construct *while Sage is built* a polynomial ring over any finite non-prime field of size less than `2^16` and convert it into Singular. In that way, all gftables would be created.

That still does not explain why the field tables are not created (or copied?) in the first place, but it could be a work around.

Hi Martin,

perhaps you know about missing "gftables" in Singular.

For working with finite non-prime fields, Singular needs certain files in a folder gftables. However, these files are missing when Sage is built on Solaris.

Problem: When Singular tries to create a polynomial ring over a finite field and the table for that field is missing, then it raises an error, but it does *not* simply compute that table -- at least not on Solaris.

However, when one has a polynomial ring over the same finite field in Sage (using libsingular) and converts it into Singular then the field table magically appears.

Questions to Martin: Did you do anything special in the Singular conversion method of libsingular polynomial rings? That's to say, do you catch errors mentioning gftables? Is there a command to create a gftable?

Actually, it is even better: The missing table is not only created when a libsingular ring is converted into Singular, but already when that ring is *created*. Proof:

I emptied the gftables folder and started Sage. Then:

```
sage: singular.eval('ring r1 = (9,x),(a,b,c,d,e,f),(M((1,2,3,0)),wp(2,3),lp)')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: Singular error:
   ? cannot open `gftables/9`
   ? cannot make ring
   ? error occurred in or before STDIN line 25: `ring r1 = (9,x),(a,b,c,d,e,f),(M((1,2,3,0)),wp(2,3),lp);`
```
Hence, Singular does not create the table by itself.

However, creating a ring in libsingular means that the table shows up and can be used:

```
sage: R.<a,b,c,d,e,f> = GF(9,'x')[]
sage: singular.eval('ring r1 = (9,x),(a,b,c,d,e,f),(M((1,2,3,0)),wp(2,3),lp)')
'ring r1 = (9,x),(a,b,c,d,e,f),(M((1,2,3,0)),wp(2,3),lp);'
```

So, question to Martin: How does libsingular make sure that a field table is present?

<a id='comment:6'></a>
Now I am really puzzled. On Singular trac, Hannes stated: "No, gftables are parts of the sources and will be copied during installation, but usually not computed (the program for that, a part of factory, will not be build during a standard compilation and installation)."

That gives rise to two questions:

1. Why are the tables not copied to the appropriate directory on Solaris?

2. How can libsingular create the missing tables?

Any clue?

I am also modifying the "reported upstream" part of the ticket. I think that meanwhile it is clear that the problem is not an upstream problem.

From the singular installation log on mark2:

```
./mkinstalldirs /home/palmieri/mark2/sage-4.7.1.rc1/local/share/singular/gftables

make[3]: Leaving directory `/home/palmieri/mark2/sage-4.7.1.rc1/spkg/build/singular-3-1-1-4.p9/src/Singular'
```
I wonder if the script `install-sh` is the problem.

I.e., they're all (precomputed) in our upstream tree, and should get copied by some BSD `install` program, cf. my reply on sage-release.

Usually autotools-enabled packages ship with some default / fallback `install` shell script in case the system lacks one, and so does Singular:

```sh
$ find /home/leif/Sage/spkgs/singular-3-1-1-4.p9/ -name install-sh
/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/singular-3-1-1-4.p9/src/libfac/install-sh
/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/singular-3-1-1-4.p9/src/install-sh
/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/singular-3-1-1-4.p9/src/Singular/install-sh
/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/singular-3-1-1-4.p9/src/kernel/install-sh
/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/singular-3-1-1-4.p9/src/factory/bin/install-sh
/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/singular-3-1-1-4.p9/src/omalloc/install-sh
/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/singular-3-1-1-4.p9/install-sh
```

`spkg/logs/singular-*.log` should show which `install` actually got used:

```
checking for a BSD compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
```
(on my Linux box)

So maybe the one found on Solaris / mark etc. is broken, but `configure` doesn't notice that. It might just install the *first* file passed to it, which would explain why just `10201` (the first in *lexicographical* order) is present there, as the relevant command used by Singular is

```sh
/usr/bin/install -c -m 644 `pwd`/LIB/gftables/* <SAGE_ROOT>/local/share/singular/gftables/
```
(Notice the wildcard, which is expanded by the shell.)

Furthermore, `gftables/*` is the only such instance; all other files are installed by something like

```sh
for f in whatever/*; do
    install -c [...] $f
done
```
so IMHO this **is** an upstream problem, since they should either use the latter for `gftables/*` as well, or make sure the `install` program they use supports multiple files at once.

... actually together with a patch!

If  Singular accepts the patch, then it will (hopefully) be part of the next Singular release. When? Singular releases take place usually every 6 months. The last was in April. So, it will hopefully be in October.

Then, the upstream fix will be included in Sage. When? Currently, Sage has Singular-3-1-1, which was released in March, 2010. So, the upstream fix will be in Sage, optimistically, in early 2012.

Hence, I'd appreciate if we could find a temporary solution in Sage. Two approaches:

1. Since libsingular is able to create the missing files, we could append a section to the Sage install script that creates a libsingular ring over any finite non-prime field of order less than `2^16`.

2. We could patch the current Singular spkg.

Probably, the second solution is better.

Haven't yet looked for other (Sage) Singular tickets, so we might already have some dealing with our current version, or even one which upgrades to a newer upstream release.

In any case, we can of course apply the same patch in the next Singular spkg.

So far I've found #10903 (new, for upgrading Singular) and a 3-1-1-4.p10 spkg (#11550), already merged into the inofficial / not yet announced Sage 4.7.2.alpha0 (among about a dozen other open tickets related to Singular).

So I could provide a p11 fixing this based on that p10.

I don't know if you plan to make further changes (to the Sage library I guess) on this ticket; if so, I can open a new ticket for the spkg. Just let me know.

P.S.: What's up with the apparently missing `help.cnf`? (Cf. #11519)

Hannes confirmed it's a Singular bug, "fixed in revision 14360".

I don't know which Singular version this revision corresponds to though.

It probably doesn't matter which: The version in Sage is strongly outdated. Singular 3-1-3 is out since April, but Sage is still using one year old Singular 3-1-1.

Anyway. My guess is that the fix will be part of Singular-3-1-4. In any case, we probably ought to take care of it NOW.

I've just attached a copy of the patch I submitted upstream.

Note that we already patch `src/Singular/Makefile.in` (with `patches/Singular-Makefile.in.patch`), so the two patches should be merged into one.

(We currently copy a patched file anyway.)

No, that's just upstream style I didn't change because I submitted the (same) patch there in the first place. ;-)

I don't know why you didn't just take the replacement files I attached, but for the record: It's not an upstream patch, but a patch I submitted upstream, i.e. I'm the author. ;-)

If you merge this (and #11663) into Sage 4.7.1, I think we should also fix the trivial missing `help.cnf` which we have to also "manually" copy with `cp -p` in `spkg-install`'s `install_docs()`; just add

```sh
    cp -p "$SRC/Singular/LIB/help.cnf" "$SAGE_LOCAL/share/singular/"
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Error copying help configuration file"
        exit 1
    fi
```

Well, you shouldn't rebase too early. We meanwhile have enough chaos anyway, multiplied by the fact that we still don't get trac notifications.

I gave #11663 positive review to be able to quickly base my new Singular spkg on yours after you had rebased that on Jeroen's. I asked multiple times where we can fix what or in which order.

It doesn't make sense to me to include (merge) one trivial patch, but not the other one. Permissions can btw. also trivially be fixed by the one who provides an installation, while it is harder to afterwards install some files located somewhere inside spkgs.

I do agree with leif about the rebasing: simply wait until the dust settles over this ticket (i.e. when I gets merged), then rebase.

I have changed the spkg just to change the wording in `SPKG.txt` to:

```
### singular-3-1-1-4.p12 (Leif Leonhardy, Jeroen Demeyer, 10 August 2011)
 * Trac #11645: Fix installation of gftables on Solaris
   by applying a patch to Singular/Makefile.in
```
I also add a doctest.  Both the spkg and doctest need review.

The problem is rather unrelated to Solaris, it's just that the machines happened to have no BSD `install` installed such that one of those (broken) `install` scripts shipped with Singular got used.

I'd also add to *Special Update/Build Instructions* that this is said to be fixed in later stable releases (but not necessarily the next one we'll upgrade to).

(Currently the patches aren't documented well; the whole spkg needs work on some follow-up.)

This is what I did to test, on the skynet machine mark (which is solaris and which did expose the bug). And, concerning Leif's hint:

```
$ command -v install
-bash: command: install: not found
```

1. I removed the contents of `SAGE_ROOT/local/share/singular/gftables`

2. I installed [the new spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/singular-3-1-1-4.p12.spkg). Now, gftables is filled with all files that are expected. So, that problem seems solved.

3. I applied [attachment:11645_doctest.patch] and did `sage -br`. Then, I tried `singular.eval('ring r = (25,x),(a,b,c,d,e,f),dp')`, which worked fine and would have failed without gftables.

4. `sage -t sage/interfaces/singular.py` worked fine.

5. I opened the spkg, verified that the changelog is present in `SPKG.txt` and that `hg status` does not complain. It was all fine.

Since the Singular code did not change (only the gftables files were copied), I think it is enough for a positive review.

Please verify whether I correctly filled the "Author(s)" field!

__Caveat__

I am currently running `sage -t sage/rings/`, which takes painfully long on mark. The tests of the first 25 files passed, but of course if some test fails in the next few hours then I'll complain.
