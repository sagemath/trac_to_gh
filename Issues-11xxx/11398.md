Could we change the format of the release changelogs to html, and have the list of ticket numbers include a link to the trac website? (Because I've noticed that there's some nice code in the trac tickets.)

I'm referring to this bit of the changelog.

```
Closed tickets:

#9723: Sage will not start on 64-bit Solaris 10 - M4RI issue ?? [Reviewed by David Kirkby]
#5841: reenable interface/lisp.py doctests [Reviewed by Karl-Dieter Crisman]
#9710: Assumptions not passed to differential equation solver [Reviewed by Karl-Dieter Crisman]
#9752: sorting of number field elements is broken [Reviewed by William Stein]
```

I'm thinking that the #9723, etc. could be turned into hyperlinks.
