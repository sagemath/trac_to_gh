The notebook help says the syntax for save is 

```
save obj1 obj2
```
I don't think that's right.  As one should expect without parentheses, you get a syntax error!

Maybe we should also add 

```
    A = matrix([[2,3],[3,4]])
    save(A,os.path.expanduser('~/')+'test')
```
as an option as well?  This would be nice for people to see.
