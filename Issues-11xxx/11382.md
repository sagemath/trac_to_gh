A lot of unnecessary and redundant check were performed with a preliminary version of #10998. See a more precise
analyze on
[this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/browse_thread/thread/545480705ce92eaa) of sage-combinat-devel

```
sage: P = cutting_poset(WeylGroup(['A',3]))
sage: P.cardinality()
24
```
Before:

```
sage: %timeit P.subposet(P.list()[1:])
5 loops, best of 3: 214 ms per loop
```
After:

```
sage: %timeit P.subposet(P.list()[1:])
25 loops, best of 3: 24.8 ms per loop
```
Here is another timing for a bigger poset:

```
sage: P = cutting_poset(WeylGroup(['A',4]))
sage: P.cardinality()
120
```
Before:

```
sage: %timeit P.subposet(P.list()[1:])
5 loops, best of 3: 28.8 s per loop
```
After:

```
sage: %timeit P.subposet(P.list()[1:])
5 loops, best of 3: 597 ms per loop
```

This is basically fixed in the final version of #10998 (run on a
slightly slower machine than for the above timings):

```
sage: %timeit P.subposet(P.list()[1:])
5 loops, best of 3: 801 ms per loop
```

The attached patch optimizes it a tiny bit further and adds doctests:

```
sage: %timeit P.subposet(P.list()[1:])
5 loops, best of 3: 688 ms per loop
```
