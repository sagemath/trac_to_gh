Simplicial complexes were lacking a method to test Cohen-Macaulayness.

In order to implement this method, some other methods are improved, namely a hash function is implemented, and _enlarge_subcomplex has become faster.

For convinience, I also added a face_iterator.

Remark: the new line

```
int_facets = set( a.set().intersection(f_set) for a in new_facets ) 
```

in _enalarge_subcomplex improved speed for computing the homology by 65% (in the example I looked at -- needs to be verified). This method still has the potential to be speeded a lot, and it is responsible for a lot cpu time when computing the homology.

I also added a second version using parallel tests on multiple cpus.

<a id='comment:3'></a>I'm sorry, I forgot about this ticket.

Overall, I think this looks pretty good.  Some comments and questions:

- I had to rebase this against 4.7.2.alpha2.
- why have both `is_cohen_macaulay` and `is_cohen_macaulay_parallel`?  When would you ever want to use the first one?  With ncpus=1, the parallel one is about as fast as the first, so should we get rid of the first one?
- on the other hand, when I run the parallel version with ncpus=1, I sometimes see an error:

```
Exception OSError: (10, 'No child processes') in <generator object __call__ at 0x10d20ee10> ignored
```
 and then the computation proceeds.  Should we try to catch this and hide it?  Can we do that if it says "ignored"?
- in my testing (`timeit('simplicial_complexes.NotIConnectedGraphs(5,2).homology()')`), I saw no change in the time required to do homology computations from the old version to the new one, but if you have other ideas for speeding things up, please implement them.
- the method `face_iterator` has no documentation.

I don't know if this was ready for review, but I'm attaching a new version of the patch which makes some of these changes: it renames `is_cohen_macaulay` to `_is_cohen_macaulay_serial` (so it's hidden), renames the parallel version to `is_cohen_macaulay`.  I wonder if we should set ncpus to be 2 by default instead of 1?  I'll try testing on a machine with just one cpu to see what effect that has.

Thanks for looking at it again, I hope we can get it into sage soon, as it was pretty much done. The only reason why I stopped working was that I thought I can still speed things up, but I never found the time to do so. I vote for leaving it as it is for now, and if someone (maybe me) needs a faster version, we get back to it.

that was just a left-over, as I first implemented is_cohen_macaulay and then started to play with the parallel version.

>  - on the other hand, when I run the parallel version with ncpus=1, I sometimes see an error:
 
> {{{

If I remember right, this happens not only for 1 cpu, but if a negative answer is returned without waiting the other parallel sessions to be finished. I agree that we should catch that error!

See my comment at the beginning.

>  - the method `face_iterator` has no documentation.


I will add it!

I tried to catch it, but it it already caught somewhere inside the decorator, so I don't know how to suppress the output, do you?

Feel free to update the patch if you see a way to do it!

Hey Christian and John,

This did not apply against #12587, so I did the very minor rebase in my review patch (it contains the entire patch; sorry if I overstepped here). I also made some minor docstring changes: some formatting and moved the note about the exception in a `.. NOTE::` block. If you agree with the changes, feel free to set this to positive review.

Thanks for your work on this, I plan on putting this to good use,

Travis
