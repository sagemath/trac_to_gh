This patch adds the feature of transforming words to tableaux from the English reading order. I checked that all tests pass in the combinat folder. If buildbot agrees that all tests pass, this is a positive review.

Hi Hugh, Anne!

Thanks for the code and the review. +1 on the new option if you have a
use case for it.

However, please change the interface to something like:

```
    sage: from_shape_and_word(shape, word, order="french")    # The default
    sage: from_shape_and_word(shape, word, order="english")
```

This is more expressive than:

```
    sage: from_shape_and_word(shape, word, False)
```

and will allow for later adding other reading orders (like
columnwise). Besides, that's consistent with what we had (or will
eventually have) for trees (order = "infix", "prefix").

As for the implementation, one can avoid duplicating the core code
using:

    if french:
        shape = reversed(shape)
    for l in shape:
        res.append( list(w[j:j+l]) )
        j += l
    if french:
        res.reverse()

Notes:
- I got rid of the shape[i] at the occasion
- I did not test it!

Last point: did you check how this commuted with Jason's patch?

Cheers,
			Nicolas

Thanks, Nicolas for the suggestions! I uploaded the new version and set it back to positive review.

Yes, on the sage-combinat queue I updated Jason's tableaux category patch and it commutes with Hugh's patch.

Best,

Anne
