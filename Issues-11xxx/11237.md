#11159 corrected a large number of errors in the section on installing Sage from source code. It possibly introduced the odd error too, though I think #11159 was a significant improvement. (I might be a little biased in that opinion, as I wrote most of it!)

However, in my own opinion, the whole section could be written a bit more clearly. One obvious step is to separate the sections about building Sage on different platforms, as the mix of information on OS X, Linux and Solaris is a bit confusing. I would suggest different sections for: 

* Linux
* OS X
* Solaris/OpenSolaris
* Cygwin (unsupported, but some hints for those trying)
* AIX (unsupported, but some hints for those trying)
* HP-UX (unsupported, but some hints for those trying)

The last two would be very short, but would help someone trying on those platforms. 

Also, the preferred commands for installing necessary software on the a number of different Linux distributions. I think we should cover the common ones in a bit more detail. 

The commands to be typed at the Sage prompt are prefixed with:

```
sage:
```

but those to be typed at the shell command line are not prefixed with anything, and could perhaps best be prefixed with:

```
$
```

Those that need root access should start with:

```
# 
```

Any comments on any of these points, or generally how to improve the *Install from Source Code* section of the *Sage Installation Guide* would be useful.

I like the idea of having different sections for different platforms.  If merging #11232 means that a suitable version of "patch" needs to be preinstalled on Cygwin, we should mention that in the Cygwin section here.
