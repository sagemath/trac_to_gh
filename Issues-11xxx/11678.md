I installed sage-4.7 in a directory as **~/tmp/Downloadz/sage/sage-4.7** and I could run sage by doing **cd ~/tmp/Downloadz/sage/sage-4.7; ./sage -n**

A day ago, I decided to move the directory into a more permanent location (from ~/tmp :)) and moved the whole folder by **mv ~/tmp/Downloadz/sage/sage-4.7 ~/Installations/.**. Now, on trying to run sage, I get the following errors:

First, for the notebook:

Did you notice a message

```
The Sage install tree may have moved

Changing various hardcoded paths

Do not interrupt this.
```
when you first started `./sage` in the new directory (`~/Installations/sage-4.7/`)?




I'm not sure if (or rather doubt that) Sage will fully work in the presence of another system-wide Sage installation, i.e., if another (different) `sage` is in your `PATH`.

The latter *might* be the problem.

P.S.: If it's just the `.pyc` files, you may cure your installation by simply removing them; they'll get recompiled the next time Python executes their respective `.py` files.

(I of course don't consider this a solution to the general problem, but it also would be helpful to know whether there are further files which still contain the old location *and* hinder Sage from starting up without the symbolic link from its original location. AFAIK there'll always remain some "harmless" `RPATH`s in shared libraries pointing to the old location.)

Sorry, I don't clearly remember what was the output at the very first run of sage.

Deleting the .pyc files doesn't work. I get the same error as I got earlier. If I have the symlink, then it does work fine, irrespective of the system wide sage installation. I know that it uses the sage (at least the notebook) from the directory ~/Installations, since I am running the rkirov-flask notebook in that directory. But you are right, there might be other things which are getting mixed up. I will simply try recompiling the local sage installation again.

Leif: I think the issue is the flask notebook.  With the "classic" notebook, I don't seem to have this problem, and the spkg-install file tries to make the path relative, but when I tried the [installation instructions](http://code.google.com/r/rkirov-flask/) for the flask notebook, I got an absolute path for the notebook (referring to "rkirov-flask" instead of "sagenb"), and it renders my Sage installation non-relocateable.

 The Sage install tree may have moved

Well, you can retry by simply renaming the `$SAGE_ROOT` directory. ;-)

You could just rename your system-wide `sage` command, in `/usr/bin/` or `/usr/local/bin/` I guess. (`command -v sage` should show which one is used when you're outside the separate Sage installation.)

In SageNB, we use

```sh
python setup.py develop --egg-path ../../../../devel/sagenb
```
but that apparently doesn't always work, so I hacked SageNB's `spkg-dist` which creates its `spkg-install`:

```sh
...
cd "$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python/site-packages"
...
if ! grep sagenb easy-install.pth >/dev/null; then
    # Ugly work-around, we haven't found the real cause yet (see #10176):
    echo "No sagenb path found in 'easy-install.pth'"'!'
    echo "Adding relative sagenb path to 'easy-install.pth'..."
    sed -e '$ i \../../../../devel/sagenb' easy-install.pth > easy-install.pth.$$
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo >&2 "Error adding relative sagenb path to 'easy-install.pth'."
        exit 1
    fi
else
    echo "Making sagenb path in 'easy-install.pth' relative..."
    sed 's/^.*sagenb.*$/..\/..\/..\/..\/devel\/sagenb/' easy-install.pth > easy-install.pth.$$
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo >&2 "Error patching 'easy-install.pth' to have relative path to SageNB."
        exit 1
    fi
fi
...
# The following fails only on wrong file permissions etc.:
mv -f easy-install.pth.$$ easy-install.pth
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo >&2 "Error overwriting original 'easy-install.pth'."
    exit 1
fi
...
```

(IIRC the trouble with *a completely missing* `sagenb` path was caused by having `SAGE_PATH` set to "`.`", but I'm not sure.)

Yeah, but Rado could add a script (or just a note on that) to the project page.

---

For the record:

The `--egg-path ...` was actually introduced at #10097, and only affects the `sagenb.egg-link` file, therefore Mitesh added replacing the absolute path in `easy-install.pth` by a relative one.

#10176 and #10192 (the latter patching `sage-spkg`, and still needing review) dealt with a completely missing `sagenb` entry in `easy-install.pth`, due to `SAGE_PATH="."` (and removed `ln -snf`, see below).

Note that the `-n` option of `ln -snf` isn't defined by POSIX, and -- worse -- shows different behaviour on GNU/Linux and Solaris, so we must not use it. I'd also change the `rkirov-flask` installation instructions, though currently explicitly for Linux, accordingly.
