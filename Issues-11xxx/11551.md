In both Windows XP and Window 7 it is now possible (again) to build Sage on Cygwin.  However, Sage has a segmentation fault in Pari upon startup.  

This happens in initalizing the Pynac i (`init_pynac_I` in sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx), but the final thing is that the mpfr number 1.00000000000 causes the segfault upon running the `._pari_()` method.  Suggestions as to why that would be - and a potential fix - are welcome.

hmm, you should be able to just copy the thing with your mouse and paste...

Well, building on Cygwin is not exactly straightforward, and (at least for me) extremely time-consuming, so I wanted to make sure I had as bleeding-edge of code as possible to catch potential problems.   I find it unlikely that patches or spkgs will currently be backed out just because they break Cygwin, though if that is not true, that would make this job *much* easier and I would be very grateful.

Luckily, Mike Hansen already had this error (almost assuredly the same one) in 4.7.alpha3 - see [this sage-devel thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/3fb9d33037670185).

I'd love to try a better terminal - William also had suggested one at Sage Days 31 - but I've only been really using Cygwin for maybe a week, and so I wouldn't even know how to ask Cygwin to use a different shell.   Cut-and-paste does not work, as far as I've been able to tell.

I put in print statements at every conceivable place.  Here is as far as it gets:

```
    def _pari_(self):
<snip comments/docs>
        sig_on()
        if mpfr_nan_p(self.value) or mpfr_inf_p(self.value):
            raise ValueError, 'Cannot convert NaN or infinity to Pari float'

        # wordsize for PARI
        cdef unsigned long wordsize = sizeof(long)*8

        cdef int prec
        prec = (<RealField_class>self._parent).__prec

        # We round up the precision to the nearest multiple of wordsize.
        cdef int rounded_prec
        rounded_prec = (self.prec() + wordsize - 1) & ~(wordsize - 1)

        # Yes, assigning to self works fine, even in Pyrex.
        if rounded_prec > prec:
            self = RealField(rounded_prec)(self)

        cdef mpz_t mantissa
        cdef mp_exp_t exponent
        cdef GEN pari_float

        if mpfr_zero_p(self.value):
            pari_float = real_0_bit(-rounded_prec)
        else:
            # Now we can extract the mantissa, and it will be normalized
            # (the most significant bit of the most significant word will be 1).
            mpz_init(mantissa)
            exponent = mpfr_get_z_exp(mantissa, self.value)
 
WE GET HERE AND NO FURTHER
           
            # Create a PARI REAL
            pari_float = cgetr(2 + rounded_prec / wordsize)
            mpz_export(&pari_float[2], NULL, 1, wordsize/8, 0, 0, mantissa)
            mpz_clear(mantissa)
            setexpo(pari_float, exponent + rounded_prec - 1)
            setsigne(pari_float, mpfr_sgn(self.value))
        
        cdef PariInstance P
        P = sage.libs.pari.all.pari
        return P.new_gen(pari_float)
```
Since 

```

    # level1.h (incomplete!)
    
    GEN     cgetg_copy(long lx, GEN x)
    GEN     cgetg(long x, long y)
    GEN     cgeti(long x)
    GEN     cgetr(long x)
    long    itos(GEN x)
    GEN     real_0_bit(long bitprec)
    GEN     stoi(long s)
```
so `cgetr` is indeed from level1.h, which is where the `sage -gdb` backtrace ends up before raising the interrupt.   What would get that to have problems?

Also attaching screenshot of the traceback.

A little further "print"-ing revealed that that cgetr is the problem.   By the way, `2 + rounded_prec / wordsize = 2 + 64/32 = 4`.

What does 

```
cgetr (x=(value optimized out))
```
mean?  Does this mean that the Pari float will always have the same precision no matter what?

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x343a8ad5 in pari_err () from /home/.../sage-4.7.1.alpha3/devel/sage/sage-main/build/sage/rings/real_mpfr.dll
```
> I couldn't get anything out of it that I hadn't seen before.

First "result" (i.e., I don't know yet why `pari_error()` is called at all, but see below):

Debugging this *bottom-up*, according to your nice screen shot the segfault originates from:

```C
static void
err_init(void)
{
  /* make sure pari_err msg starts at the beginning of line */
  if (!pari_last_was_newline()) pari_putc('\n');
  pariOut->flush(); /***** THIS SEGFAULTS *****/
  pariErr->flush();
  pariOut = pariErr;
  term_color(c_ERR);
}
```

So obviously `pariOut` (and most probably also `pariErr`) aren't properly initialized at that point. (Note that line 885 in the vanilla PARI sources is the assignment statement, but we patch `src/src/language/init.c` such that we get an offset of +2 lines.)

PARI error number 14 is "`errpile`" (i.e. heap / [PARI] stack error), which is most probably raised for the same reason, namely because the PARI stack apparently isn't [yet] initialized when `cgetr()` gets called.

For the moment, it's up to someone else to donate his/her 2 ct or more... ;-)

I have no idea why `real_mpfr`[`.pyx`] shouldn't initialize [the] PARI [library] (i.e., the `pari_instance` variable defined in `sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx`), but you (Karl-Dieter) could verify it gets initialized by putting some print statement(s) into `PariInstance`'s `__init__()`, preferably (also) around `pari_init_opts()`, to make sure the latter really gets called, because of

```python
        if bot:
            return  # pari already initialized.
```

There are a few things that might be relevant here:

* Cython doesn't support C `enum` constants (here e.g. `INIT_DFTm`), therefore one has to declare them as `cdef extern int`s, but I don't think that's the problem here.

* `bot` is a very bad name for a global variable (of a *library*!), i.e. some other library / module might use the same for a different purpose, such that the one supposed to be PARI's may actually already have some non-zero value despite PARI not yet being initialized. (The early-`return` check in `PariInstance`'s `__init__()` worsens that to some extent, though other problems would certainly arise later in that case.)

It's not far enough along to try these, but here's something naive.

```
        cdef GEN pari_float
<snip>
        else:
<snip>
            # Create a PARI REAL
            pari_float = cgetr(2 + rounded_prec / wordsize)
 <snip>
        cdef PariInstance P
        P = sage.libs.pari.all.pari
        return P.new_gen(pari_float)
```
So it looks like the GEN gets defined before the PariInstance - is that a problem for some reason?  Again, this is totally naive, and probably wrong since this works everywhere else.

I don't know how you managed that ;-) but you should be able to just reinstall the "old" PARI (2.4.3.alpha.p7) at least (assuming you also have a Sage branch without #11130's patches applied, though these only change doctests IIRC).

If you think something may get mixed up with a previous installation, you can also

```sh
$ rm -rf $SAGE_ROOT/local/include/pari/
$ rm $SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/libpari*
$ rm $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/{libpari,gp}*
```
before reinstalling the PARI package.
(And perhaps also run `./sage -ba-force` after you've reinstalled it.)

No idea what the `#0` and `#1` refer to... 




> So it looks like the GEN gets defined before the PariInstance - is that a problem for some reason?

No. The weird trailer just explicitly uses the one and only global "`PariInstance`" `pari_instance` alias `P` alias `sage.libs.pari.gen.pari` alias `sage.libs.pari.all.pari` (which should get initialized as soon as you import from that module (`sage.libs.pari.gen`), which is done far above in `real_mpfr.pyx`), because `new_gen()` is only available as a member function (or "method") of an instance, for whatever reason.

Attachment: **[Pari-2.5.0Segfault.png](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11551/Pari-2.5.0Segfault.png)**

Latest screenshot shows that the upgrade of Pari in #11130 causes a slightly different segfault backtrace, but still along the same lines of what Leif is suggesting and nearly the same as before.

```
  if (x > (avma-bot) / sizeof(long)) pari_err(errpile);
```
is line 86 in level1.h, unless there are patches in Sage, and with the same two-line offset the `#0` error in the backtrace is the same as above.  What I find interesting is that this time it doesn't mention `real_mpfr` or `cgetr`, though I assume that is still where the problem is.

Okay, inserting appropriate print statements gives

```
Got to first line of PariInsstance init
Got beyond 'if bot' of PariInstance init instead
Got beyond 'pari_init_opts'
Got here
Got to just before pari_float
```
which can be interpreted as
* Pari was initialized
* the 'if bot' was NOT taken
* and `pari_init_opts` was apparently called
* then we got to the complex number line
* then we got to the `real_mpfr` line with the `cgetr`
* and we didn't make it past that, as usual.

So apparently `bot` was not yet set, contrary to your hypothesis, but there is still something weird going on with the stack.  The rest of the lines in the `_init_` don't look that innocent either; if one of them failed or allocated something null would it raise an error?  (Like the `pari_free` line or the `pariOut` lines?)

`bot == 0` is certainly very bad and is surely the cause of the segfault.  It would be great if you could figure out why `bot` is set to zero.

Hmm, okay.  So here is what I discovered so far: 
* The PariInstance init is called well before the Pynac initialization.
* In the PariInstance init, the actual deep copy is called three times, and all is well.
* I am able to insert a statement like 

```
print "bot is now", bot
```
   in `real_mpfr.pyx`.
* I am **not** allowed to do this in other files where PariInstance is imported, such as `matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx`.  On the very reasonable grounds that 

```
undeclared name not builtin:bot
```

Well!  So why the heck is `real_mpfr.pyx` allowing me to insert this print statement in the first place?   It seems like this is why bot is causing problems - it shouldn't even be defined.  Nowhere else in that file is bot used, other than in my print statements, as far as I could tell.

Anyway, in integer.pyx, Cython doesn't complain about this, and to my surprise bot is already 0 there!

Let's look at the relevant order in sage/all.py:

```
<snip>
from sage.libs.all       import *  # here is where Pari gets imported, and hence the PariInstance

from sage.rings.all      import * # here is where integer.pyx presumably is initialized and bot is already zero
from sage.matrix.all     import *

# This must come before Calculus -- it initializes the Pynac library.
import sage.symbolic.pynac # here is where the symptom turned up while initializing the square root of -1
```

I'll try to look into this a little more now, otherwise more tomorrow.

Okay, here is what happens in a normal Sage build (OS X, Sage 4.7):

```

----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.7, Release Date: 2011-05-23                         |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Going to import from functional # this is in sage/misc/all.py
Going to import CDF # this is is sage/misc/functional.py, near the top
0 # bot starts at 0
4338077696 # bot becomes this
In integer.pyx, bot is  4338077696 # it's still correct at this point
Top of complex_double # Now we actually reach complex_double!
Middle of complex_double
Bottom of complex_double
End Going to import CDF
End Going to import from functional
```

So somehow Pari is initialized, bot is created, and then other stuff happens including doing integer.pyx **all before we actually get to the top of `complex_double`**, even though we are importing from `complex_double`!

I think this is because the C file generated by Cython imports a lot of stuff ahead of translating the things that actually happen from `complex_double.pyx`.  But at this point I'm out of my depth.  

Can someone look in `complex_double.c` to see where Pari would first be initialized (and then where integer.pyx/integer.c would be invoked, precisely ONCE)?    For instance, close to the top there is 

```

#include "pari/paricfg.h"
#include "pari/pari.h"
#include "pari/paripriv.h"
#include "stdsage.h"
#include "interrupt.h"
#include "complex.h"
#include "ntl_wrap.h"
#include "ZZ_pylong.h"
```
but I have no idea whether that is relevant.  There is also more than one place where I see

```
* cdef class PariInstance(sage.structure.parent_base.ParentWithBase):             # <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
```
in things coming from other files which are imported, I guess.  The stretch around 1430 seems most likely

```

/* "sage/libs/pari/gen.pxd":20

You're "allowed" to print `bot` in some of the Cython files because they include `.../pari/decl.pxi` which declares it, e.g.:

```sh
$ grep "pari/decl" devel/sage/sage/rings/*
devel/sage/sage/rings/complex_double.pxd:include '../libs/pari/decl.pxi'
devel/sage/sage/rings/factorint.pyx:include "../libs/pari/decl.pxi"

devel/sage/sage/rings/rational.pyx:include "../libs/pari/decl.pxi"
devel/sage/sage/rings/real_mpfr.pxd:include '../libs/pari/decl.pxi'
```

The value of `bot` (the lower / start address of PARI's stack) seems quite large, both on Cygwin and MacOS X.

`init_stack()` has some flaws, but these shouldn't be the cause of your problem.

The assignments to `pariOut` etc. and the `pari_free()` call are harmless; they don't allocate anything and cannot fail.

You can try to start `sage` with `-min` (bypassing a lot of imports), do

```
sage: from sage.libs.pari import *
```
and play with the PARI library, to see if that works.

Btw., `complex_number.pyx` doesn't import `sage.libs.pari`[`.all`] although it uses it.

Sorry, not of much help I guess.

Doesn't bypass enough imports - I get the same.  In fact, it even initializes I (and hence segfaults).

True.  Nonetheless, I get the following sequence:
   1. sage/all.py imports misc
   2. sage/misc/all.py imports some stuff from functional.py
   3. In order to import that stuff, functional.py must be loaded, I guess (according to Python doc)
   4. One of the things imported in functional.py is `from complex_double import CDF`
   5. This is the exact line that causes the bot to become 0 in Cygwin

    2. Then, still within that line in functional.py, apparently integer.pyx is also called (for the first time?) and in Cygwin bot becomes 0 again
    3. But nowhere in `complex_double.pyx` is there something I can print to identify where this happens.  Presumably it's in the various cimport statements there, which apparently come earlier in the C file than the import stuff and anything else, like print statements.  
   6. By the time we leave this line in functional.py, all the damage is done.

Does that help?  I just have no idea how all this happens in `complex_double.c`, yet importing CDF from that in misc/functional.py **is** where the `bot=0` happens, for sure.

Just curious, do you run Cygwin on a 32-bit Windows / machine?

Also, `bot==0` isn't sufficient to cause the stack overflow, since `(avma-0) / sizeof(long)` should certainly be larger than `x` in `new_chunk(size_t x)` (unless `avma` is that large that it is interpreted as a negative number), so apparently `avma` gets corrupted as well (as `bot` and `pariOut` appear to).

But it would perhaps be helpful to print `bot`, `top` and `avma` after `init_stack()` has been called (in `gen.pyx`).

Maybe we should just fix the buggy `init_stack()`, though that doesn't explain why `bot` gets zero (and perhaps `sage_pariOut` also corrupted). I also wonder why this doesn't cause problems on other systems.

Testing this (which isn't directly related to PARI) would be important, too, since according to MSDN `longjmp`ing from a signal handler (which we do) doesn't work on Windows. I don't know if Cygwin works around that somehow.

Yes, I saw that comment, but I'm still fixing the old builds to try to test this.  `./sage -ba-force` takes a long time on a VM, and I don't want to comment out "I" and "qqbar" on the newest build where I have all the print statements to try to fix this bug.

However, that said, I don't recall that being one of the files that caused problems when I tested before (with no maximalib/ECLlib and no I or qqbar).

Well, I guess it's 64-bit but not 64-bit

```
  64-bit Kernel and Extensions:	No
```
So the processor is 64-bit, but not the kernel (whatever that difference is), and I don't have 64-bit on.  In any case, the Parallels is running XP, and I checked and it is definitely a 32-bit version of XP.

I assume `top` and `avma` are 2121924616 + 16000000 = 2137924616, or `bot` is 2105924616; otherwise this would be the first error.

Nice.

Certainly, since `x` there is the number of atomic PARI items (`long`s) to allocate on / put onto the stack.

Random?  But why is it so reliable then, and on different computers/versions of Windows?    (Unless the importing of randstate did it, but I don't think that's what you meant, and I don't think this has `avma` or `bot` or `top`.)

---
The real problem is that I can't dump values of these variables while the pyx files are being imported, because editing the pyx file `complex_double` won't do that until after they are all imported.  And I can't dump them from places where they aren't defined - precious few, really.    

Really needing that import hook thingie.

The bug in #11116 only happens on one arch, and potentially with only a few versions of Sage.
Maybe it's the same here.
You were unlucky enough to try out a particular version of Sage on a particular machine where the problems of initialization order lead to a segfault.
But a innocent looking chenge since anywhere in the Sage library might have made the problem disappear.

It's true.  At the same time, it wasn't just me - Mike Hansen had this traceback well over a year ago.  It is possible it was only ever on XP, who knows.

AFAIR, I saw this on my 32-bit Win7, too. IMHO, it's a Cygwin improvement that is to credit.

By the way, I have strange problems with my new 64-bit Win7, Sage install does not get past bzip2. Or is bzip2 supposed to come from Cygwin natively? Perhaps the toolchain is broken?

I use the latest Cygwin. Does it still need a manual fix in that libtool or autoconf or what was that?

I don't know... the problem was that updating from the gcc4 default package (4.3.stg) to the 4.5.stg "forgot" to update some pathes in configuration files in the postinst script.
The latest 4.5 package seems to be from october 2011, so I doubt the problem has been fixed.

I've encountered exactly this issue trying to import sage, which I finally got to build after a number of other fixes (not all of which I've posted patches for yet).

Since this ticket has already been closed and is quite long, should I open a new one?  Or just reopen this one?  It appears to be the exact same issue--I'm getting a segfault at the line

```
pari_float = cgetr(2 + rounded_prec / wordsize)
```
in real_mpfr.pyx.
