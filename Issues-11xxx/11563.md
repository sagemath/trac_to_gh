#10333 implements an interface to lrcalc, using an optional spkg.
According to the vote on http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/2e7114375f6f88a5/, there is a consensus on making lrcalc a standard spkg, after a one release probation period in order to follow the official rule.

1. **spkg**: add [attachment: lrcalc-1.1.6beta1.spkg](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11563/lrcalc-1.1.6beta1.spkg.gz) as standard spkg.
2. **apply** [attachment: trac_11563-lrcalc_standard_package-nt.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11563/trac_11563-lrcalc_standard_package-nt.patch.gz) to the Sage library.
3. **apply** [attachment: trac_11563-lrcalc-sageroot-nt.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11563/trac_11563-lrcalc-sageroot-nt.patch.gz) to `SAGE_ROOT`.

You should use `$MAKE` instead of `make` in `spkg-install` and `spkg-check`.

Some of the files in the spkg are not world-readable.  Please fix this with

```
chmod ugo+rX -R src
```

Finally: adding a new **standard** package should always be discussed on the sage-devel mailing list.

I think that in SPKG.txt, at the top it should just say "lrcalc" rather than "lrcalc 1.1.6 beta p0": the version number should just be in the ChangeLog (for ease of updating later). I took the liberty of creating a new spkg (committed in your name, Nicolas). I'm also attaching a patch showing the changes.

Jeroen: if you feel like it, feel free to do such trivial rebases directly; it probably will take you less time than going through this whole process.

Thank to John, I could login on hawk and investigate. It turned out to be a C-level name conflict with a function called `hash_insert`. I used a macro to rename that function in the lrcalc sources. 

I also used the occasion to add examples of fusion and quantum calculations in the README and testsuite.

I bumped lrcalc's version accordingly. Anders: please finish up version 1.1.6 from there!

The updated spkg also only installs the lrcalc libraries and headers, not the binaries. Thanks John for pointing this out!

See the attached diff for the changes.

Quick review would be most appreciated to get this in 5.2!!!

Thanks,
                                   Nicolas

Since the binaries are no longer installed, the test suite for the package fails (that is, running `sage -i -c lrcalc...`):

Otherwise, all tests passed for me on hawk also, and on OS X 10.7. I think that since this had a positive review before, if you can fix spkg-check so self-tests pass, then it should get a positive review.

Oops, fixed (I was calling mult incorrectly in the new tests). Thanks for catching this! Updated spkg and diff attached.

Thanks for the super quick review :-)

Is there some prevision of an official release of lrcalc 1.1.6?
I would like to package it in fedora, and believe the sagemath spkg is not mean't to be the upstream tarball. It should be good enough if upstream can make the 1.1.6beta tarball available.
But it has plenty of time as I deferred my fedora sagemath package to after fedora 18.
