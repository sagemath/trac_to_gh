It seems that with sage 4.8, this workaround doesn't work anymore.
I attached the output I get when building on i686 without the above workaround.

This is what I get when trying to compile with the workaround:

```
mkdir -p spkg/installed
touch spkg/installed/ppl-0.11.2.p0

I think that the following post (for OpenSuse 12.1) mentions exactly the same underlying problem:

 http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/a7017c8f3b0a16c0

It seems that from Sage 4.8 on, the ppl (Parma Polyhedra Library) got interfaced by the Sage core. So the "workaround" to not build the ppl spkg at all ("touch spkg/installed/ppl-0.11.2.p0") simply won't work for Sage 4.8 and later (since the respective headers are needed)!

As long as the ppl library included in Sage and the ppl library of the host OS do not differ too much (they seem to be "close enough" right now in the known cases Arch Linx, OpenSuse 11.4 - 12.1), one probably could use a different workaround:

a) *do* build the ppl spkg (in order to get the header files in place)

b) after that (just waiting for the "breakage" might be sufficient), replace the library binary ("libppl.so.9.0.0" or so) under $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/ with a symlink to the host OS'es libppl.

For some "correct" solution, one would either have to update the ppl spkg to install a newer version of ppl, to match the one of the host OS(es) --- somewhat a "moving target" (we might end up with having to provide several different versions of ppl in the spkg).

Or provide the technical foundation so that the libraries brought with Sage do not (i.e. no longer) interfere with libraries on the host OS (the ticket #10572 describes one of several ways to do so).


Cheers,

Georg

I don't know if this is a known thing, but one of Arch Linux users (going by name Snowball on AUR, the Arch Linux User Repository) posted a working solution for ppl problem on i686, and it is quite a simple change to ppl spkg:

```
sed -i 's/--enable-interfaces=c++/--enable-interfaces="c++ c"/' ppl-0.11.2.p0/spkg-install
```

I tested this in i686 VM of Arch Linux and can confirm that with this change to ppl spkg it works (right now Sage 4.8 still builds, but it got past pycrypto where it failed before). Unfortunately right now I don't have time to post an updated spkg, but I decided to let others know about it anyway.

The difference between spkg in #12672 and spkg I posted in [comment:7](#comment%3A7) (that contains fix used by Arch Linux package, i.e. is tested in production environment) is only "make install" vs "make install-strip", so I'd say yes - both spkgs fixes this and #12672 - but both would have issues with m4 on OS X.
