As far as I am concerned this needs *no more work* on this ticket, but I'll delay marking it positive review until the same is possible at #11005.  Still, it certainly gets "needs review" on that basis.

A reasonable assumption, but...for a while now I have used Sage's Pari and NTL builds rather than building them myself independently, so I cannot yet confirm.  (However, eclib's use of Pari is minimal, it's only for integer factorization.)

I am also preparing a new version of eclib, so I will combine these two tasks, though I don't have any time for this this week.

I checked (using bash's history) that I had remembered to hg qpush each patch.

Well the gp executable is linked against libpari and there is a danger that the old one will be used when linking if you are not careful enough. It should be ok in principle but the precaution of removing previous libpari is a good one.

Both *should<sup>TM</sup>* be possible, at least unless the build succeeds but the actual installation fails at some point, in which case the former method should still work.

> > The fact that this doesn't work is not good - shouldn't we only copy things over/delete things after the build has successfully completed?


That's what we do.

Things are a little different on Cygwin, since *the Sage Cygwin developers* ;-) copy the DLL also to `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin` such that `gp` will find its *shared* library also there.

PARI (2.4.3) **pre**pends its build path (with `-L`) when using `-lpari`, except for when it links `gp`[`-2.4`] "in place", but this happens *after* the new shared library (`.so*`, `*.dll` on Cygwin) has been copied and new symbolic links have been created. The new *static* library is built and copied later though, but that shouldn't matter unless `gp` is statically linked on Cygwin, which shouldn't be the case.

If despite that something weird happens, this is IMHO limited to Cygwin; you may attach your spkg install logs (`$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/logs/pari-*.log`) such that we can check this.

We also didn't have problems with upgrading **to** 2.4.3 btw., except that initially some dependencies of Sage's extension modules were missing such that those didn't get rebuilt in the first place (and used the old ones with a different version they had been linked to earlier).

The strange thing is that the traceback you get seems totally unrelated to PARI.

I know, it is mad.  After this happened with my 4.7.1.rc1 yesterday I wanted to review something else, so I did that using my 4.7.1.rc0 which was untouched, and found the exact same errors arising whenever I tried "sage -t".  This is on a machine I have been using for Sage development and testing for a year, on which no-one but me installs stuff.

Here are some possibly relevant environment variables (not changed recently):

SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD=yes
SHELL=/bin/bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/usr/local/lib:/home/jec/sage-current/local/lib

The reason for the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is that I use Sage's built libraries for other work (libntl and libpari);  but seeting that to just /usr/local/lib made no difference anyway.

That is not set:

```
jec@fermat%env | grep SAGE
SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD=yes
```

make testlong was no better, neither is testing a single file (e.g. ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/rings/infinity.py).  Sage does start up properly.

Looking at the actual error message (why not?) I see that it complains that the line 

```
from sage.all_cmdline import *;
```
which is presumably included in the testing framework, causes sage.all_cmdline.py to be imported, and then in line 24 of that file the line 24:

```
   raise ValueError, msg
```
raises the error, with the message coming from a few lines above where there is a try/except block containing

```
    from sage.all import *
    from sage.calculus.predefined import x
    preparser(on=True)
```
and this is causing some kind of circular import.

Anyway, by 4.7 build which I have been using for weeks, and which passed all the tests when I built it, now gives rise to exactly the same problem.  So this is nothing to do with any of the code on this ticket, but instead something weird that has happened with my Sage installations.

Here's an idea: I have several background jobs running sage;  is it possible that this is the problem?  They will also be writing to ~/.sage.  I'll try again when they have finished.

John, your patch changes the *functionality* of the `simon_two_descent()` function by adding a new option ``store_gens``.  I have two problems with this:

1. I think a ticket related to upgrading PARI is not the correct place to make such a change (or at least, it should be justified why).
2. I don't like how `store_gens` changes the output of the function.  The name op this option does not imply that the output would be changed.  I can agree that you store the saturated points (as before), but why also *return* the saturated points?  This is a real functional change.

John, it would be great if you could review the remaining patches here.  They get positive_review from me, but since they contain a mixture of code of you and of me, you should also look at them.

That's correct.  These two tickets need to be merged together, one will not work without the other.  leif wants to change #11321 such that it does not depend on this ticket, but I think that's unnecessary.

needs_review on that ticket applies to everything.  I created the .p8, leif raised some concerns about the .p8 and is proposing a .p9 but it doesn't materialize.

> Or are we going to wait for a p9 spkg at #11321, in which case we would probably need to test everything here over again?

As far as I'm concerned, we can merge the .p8 as it is but it still needs_review.  I don't believe leif's concerns are serious enough that they should prevent the spkg from being merged.
