After (1) Building a fresh 4.7.alpha5 from scratch, (2) installing the spkg lined here with "sage -f", (3) applying the patch here to the sage library and (4) running "sage -b", I find that the Sage build will not start up properly:

```

so I cannot test anything.

ell_rational_field.py: only one failure, looks completely trivial but will be left until #11005 to be fixed.

ell_number_field.py: one failure, even more trivial:  the final output is exactly the same as it was but the verbose output is a little different, so this can be easily cleaned up at #11005.

As far as I am concerned this needs *no more work* on this ticket, but I'll delay marking it positive review until the same is possible at #11005.  Still, it certainly gets "needs review" on that basis.

+8. #10240 (pari-2.4.3.svn-12577.p9 incorrectly checks for the shared library on Cygwin).  We simply use the spkg patch from that ticket.
 
 However, since adding more and more patches to PARI is becoming unmaintainable, we simply should move to a more recent svn revision instead of revision 12623 (pari-2.4.3).  We plan to update to **svn revision 13153**.

I have added a new patch (which affects 4 files in sage/rings) after which all doctests pass on both 32- and 64-bit, apart from the simon-related ones.

That means that it is time to check #11005 on top of all this.

A reasonable assumption, but...for a while now I have used Sage's Pari and NTL builds rather than building them myself independently, so I cannot yet confirm.  (However, eclib's use of Pari is minimal, it's only for integer factorization.)

I am also preparing a new version of eclib, so I will combine these two tasks, though I don't have any time for this this week.

So is the "Needs work" just because this ticket is dependent on #11005?  I am planning to look now at the doctest failures relating to the Simon scripts and fix them, so that this ticket can then be closed, and the additional work needed on #11005 can depend on this.

Before I set about applying everything and testing, which I will do, can you tell me which Sage version I should be patching against?  I have 4.7.1.rc1, is that the best?  Or plain 4.7?

sage-4.7.1.rc1 for sure.

Well the gp executable is linked against libpari and there is a danger that the old one will be used when linking if you are not careful enough. It should be ok in principle but the precaution of removing previous libpari is a good one.

(The `.alpha`**`.p5`** though had a bug which caused the install script not to exit with an error if `make` failed. Also, on Cygwin `make -k` (\"keep going\") was used, but that shouldn't matter here, and has been removed in the 2.5.0 spkgs.)\n\n> > In principle, one should be able to `./sage -f` a new version, have something break, and then be able to `./sage -f` the original version and have everything fine.

It should be ok in principle but the precaution of removing previous libpari is a good one.\n\nThings are a little different on Cygwin, since *the Sage Cygwin developers* ;-) copy the DLL also to `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin` such that `gp` will find its *shared* library also there.\n\nPARI (2.4.3) **pre**pends its build path (with `-L`) when using `-lpari`, except for when it links `gp`[`-2.4`] \"in place\", but this happens *after* the new shared library (`.so*`, `*.dll` on Cygwin) has been copied and new symbolic links have been created.

The PARI spkg doesn't delete anything of previous installs in advance. (The `.alpha`**`.p5`** though had a bug which caused the install script not to exit with an error if `make` failed. Also, on Cygwin `make -k` ("keep going") was used, but that shouldn't matter here, and has been removed in the 2.5.0 spkgs.)

Both *should<sup>TM</sup>* be possible, at least unless the build succeeds but the actual installation fails at some point, in which case the former method should still work.

That's what we do.

Things are a little different on Cygwin, since *the Sage Cygwin developers* ;-) copy the DLL also to `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin` such that `gp` will find its *shared* library also there.

PARI (2.4.3) **pre**pends its build path (with `-L`) when using `-lpari`, except for when it links `gp`[`-2.4`] "in place", but this happens *after* the new shared library (`.so*`, `*.dll` on Cygwin) has been copied and new symbolic links have been created. The new *static* library is built and copied later though, but that shouldn't matter unless `gp` is statically linked on Cygwin, which shouldn't be the case.

If despite that something weird happens, this is IMHO limited to Cygwin; you may attach your spkg install logs (`$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/logs/pari-*.log`) such that we can check this.

We also didn't have problems with upgrading **to** 2.4.3 btw., except that initially some dependencies of Sage's extension modules were missing such that those didn't get rebuilt in the first place (and used the old ones with a different version they had been linked to earlier).

I know, it is mad.  After this happened with my 4.7.1.rc1 yesterday I wanted to review something else, so I did that using my 4.7.1.rc0 which was untouched, and found the exact same errors arising whenever I tried "sage -t".  This is on a machine I have been using for Sage development and testing for a year, on which no-one but me installs stuff.

Here are some possibly relevant environment variables (not changed recently):

SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD=yes
SHELL=/bin/bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/usr/local/lib:/home/jec/sage-current/local/lib

The reason for the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is that I use Sage's built libraries for other work (libntl and libpari);  but seeting that to just /usr/local/lib made no difference anyway.

That is not set:

```
jec@fermat%env | grep SAGE
SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD=yes
```

make testlong was no better, neither is testing a single file (e.g. ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/rings/infinity.py).  Sage does start up properly.

Looking at the actual error message (why not?) I see that it complains that the line 

```
from sage.all_cmdline import *;
```
which is presumably included in the testing framework, causes sage.all_cmdline.py to be imported, and then in line 24 of that file the line 24:

```
   raise ValueError, msg
```
raises the error, with the message coming from a few lines above where there is a try/except block containing

```
    from sage.all import *
    from sage.calculus.predefined import x
    preparser(on=True)
```
and this is causing some kind of circular import.

Anyway, by 4.7 build which I have been using for weeks, and which passed all the tests when I built it, now gives rise to exactly the same problem.  So this is nothing to do with any of the code on this ticket, but instead something weird that has happened with my Sage installations.

Here's an idea: I have several background jobs running sage;  is it possible that this is the problem?  They will also be writing to ~/.sage.  I'll try again when they have finished.

John, your patch changes the *functionality* of the `simon_two_descent()` function by adding a new option ``store_gens``.  I have two problems with this:

1. I think a ticket related to upgrading PARI is not the correct place to make such a change (or at least, it should be justified why).
2. I don't like how `store_gens` changes the output of the function.  The name op this option does not imply that the output would be changed.  I can agree that you store the saturated points (as before), but why also *return* the saturated points?  This is a real functional change.

The patch was created for PARI version 2.4.4 but by now there is version 2.5.0.  So in fact both numbers are correct.  Since 2.4.4 is the first affected version, I say we use that version number.

I'm puzzled because these two tickets are listed as prerequisites for each other, and yet this one is at "positive review" and the other at "needs review". Is the proposal to close this ticket and merge the lcalc 1.23.p8 spkg from #11321, but not the two subsequent patches on that ticket, and the "needs review" there applies to the subsequent patches? Or are we going to wait for a p9 spkg at #11321, in which case we would probably need to test everything here over again?

That's correct.  These two tickets need to be merged together, one will not work without the other.  leif wants to change #11321 such that it does not depend on this ticket, but I think that's unnecessary.

needs_review on that ticket applies to everything.  I created the .p8, leif raised some concerns about the .p8 and is proposing a .p9 but it doesn't materialize.

> Or are we going to wait for a p9 spkg at #11321, in which case we would probably need to test everything here over again?

As far as I'm concerned, we can merge the .p8 as it is but it still needs_review.  I don't believe leif's concerns are serious enough that they should prevent the spkg from being merged.

I'm trying to apply all the spkgs and patches in this ticket so I can review #11948, but I can't build the Sage library. With everything applied, I get, after `./sage -b`:

```

If I just rerun `./sage -b` (surely that will fix it, right? :), I get
