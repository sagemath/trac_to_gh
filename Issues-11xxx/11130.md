After (1) Building a fresh 4.7.alpha5 from scratch, (2) installing the spkg lined here with "sage -f", (3) applying the patch here to the sage library and (4) running "sage -b", I find that the Sage build will not start up properly:

```

so I cannot test anything.  

Did I do something wrong?

ell_rational_field.py: only one failure, looks completely trivial but will be left until #11005 to be fixed.

ell_number_field.py: one failure, even more trivial:  the final output is exactly the same as it was but the verbose output is a little different, so this can be easily cleaned up at #11005.

As far as I am concerned this needs *no more work* on this ticket, but I'll delay marking it positive review until the same is possible at #11005.  Still, it certainly gets "needs review" on that basis.

I have added a new patch (which affects 4 files in sage/rings) after which all doctests pass on both 32- and 64-bit, apart from the simon-related ones.

That means that it is time to check #11005 on top of all this.

A reasonable assumption, but...for a while now I have used Sage's Pari and NTL builds rather than building them myself independently, so I cannot yet confirm.  (However, eclib's use of Pari is minimal, it's only for integer factorization.)

I am also preparing a new version of eclib, so I will combine these two tasks, though I don't have any time for this this week.

So is the "Needs work" just because this ticket is dependent on #11005?  I am planning to look now at the doctest failures relating to the Simon scripts and fix them, so that this ticket can then be closed, and the additional work needed on #11005 can depend on this.

The spkg does not build on Mac OS X because of an upstream bug.  There is a fix in PARI svn revision 13318 which I should add to this spkg.

Starting with a clean 4.7.1.rc1 (I think) I successfully applied both spkgs (using SAGE_CHECK=yes) and 5 patches to sagelib and 1 to data/extcode, and did sage -ba.

Sage now starts up OK but I'm having a lot of problems with any more testing.  For example, moving into devel/sage and doing "../../sage -tp 20 ./sage"  results in very many errors, looks like in every file, like this:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/jec/.sage//tmp/facade_sets.py", line 2, in <module>
    from sage.all_cmdline import *; 
  File "/home/jec/sage-4.7.1.rc1/local/lib/python/site-packages/sage/all_cmdline.py", line 24, in <module>
    raise ValueError, msg
ValueError: Attempted relative import in non-package
```
I checked (using bash's history) that I had remembered to hg qpush each patch.

Does this make any sense? I suppose I could rebuild 4.7.1.rc1 from scratch.

Well the gp executable is linked against libpari and there is a danger that the old one will be used when linking if you are not careful enough. It should be ok in principle but the precaution of removing previous libpari is a good one.

Both *should<sup>TM</sup>* be possible, at least unless the build succeeds but the actual installation fails at some point, in which case the former method should still work.

That's what we do.

Things are a little different on Cygwin, since *the Sage Cygwin developers* ;-) copy the DLL also to `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin` such that `gp` will find its *shared* library also there.

PARI (2.4.3) **pre**pends its build path (with `-L`) when using `-lpari`, except for when it links `gp`[`-2.4`] "in place", but this happens *after* the new shared library (`.so*`, `*.dll` on Cygwin) has been copied and new symbolic links have been created. The new *static* library is built and copied later though, but that shouldn't matter unless `gp` is statically linked on Cygwin, which shouldn't be the case.

If despite that something weird happens, this is IMHO limited to Cygwin; you may attach your spkg install logs (`$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/logs/pari-*.log`) such that we can check this.

We also didn't have problems with upgrading **to** 2.4.3 btw., except that initially some dependencies of Sage's extension modules were missing such that those didn't get rebuilt in the first place (and used the old ones with a different version they had been linked to earlier).

I know, it is mad.  After this happened with my 4.7.1.rc1 yesterday I wanted to review something else, so I did that using my 4.7.1.rc0 which was untouched, and found the exact same errors arising whenever I tried "sage -t".  This is on a machine I have been using for Sage development and testing for a year, on which no-one but me installs stuff.

Here are some possibly relevant environment variables (not changed recently):

SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD=yes
SHELL=/bin/bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/usr/local/lib:/home/jec/sage-current/local/lib

The reason for the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is that I use Sage's built libraries for other work (libntl and libpari);  but seeting that to just /usr/local/lib made no difference anyway.

Same happens with just `./sage -t ...` or `make test[long]`, i.e. non-parallel?

We had strange errors with `ptest[long]` or `./sage -tp N ...` when `SAGE_PATH` was set (even to the empty string).

That is not set:

```
jec@fermat%env | grep SAGE
SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD=yes
```

make testlong was no better, neither is testing a single file (e.g. ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/rings/infinity.py).  Sage does start up properly.

Looking at the actual error message (why not?) I see that it complains that the line 

```
from sage.all_cmdline import *;
```
which is presumably included in the testing framework, causes sage.all_cmdline.py to be imported, and then in line 24 of that file the line 24:

```
   raise ValueError, msg
```
raises the error, with the message coming from a few lines above where there is a try/except block containing

```
    from sage.all import *
    from sage.calculus.predefined import x
    preparser(on=True)
```
and this is causing some kind of circular import.

Anyway, by 4.7 build which I have been using for weeks, and which passed all the tests when I built it, now gives rise to exactly the same problem.  So this is nothing to do with any of the code on this ticket, but instead something weird that has happened with my Sage installations.

Here's an idea: I have several background jobs running sage;  is it possible that this is the problem?  They will also be writing to ~/.sage.  I'll try again when they have finished.

Yes, all the version I have start and run fine, but none of them cab run any tests.  I have never seen this before, but it's something to do with my setup (and several sage jobs running in the background on the same machine) so we should probably not fill up more of this ticket with it -- as long as someone else can do some testing!

John, your patch changes the *functionality* of the `simon_two_descent()` function by adding a new option ``store_gens``.  I have two problems with this:

1. I think a ticket related to upgrading PARI is not the correct place to make such a change (or at least, it should be justified why).
2. I don't like how `store_gens` changes the output of the function.  The name op this option does not imply that the output would be changed.  I can agree that you store the saturated points (as before), but why also *return* the saturated points?  This is a real functional change.

OK, so with a freshly built 4.7.2.alpha2, I successfully installed both new spkgs and all patches, and rebuilt Sage using -ba.  Now doing a full test.

Question:  in the extcode patch we refer to version 2.4.4 -- should that be 2.5.0?

The patch was created for PARI version 2.4.4 but by now there is version 2.5.0.  So in fact both numbers are correct.  Since 2.4.4 is the first affected version, I say we use that version number.

Yes, it is.

That's correct.  These two tickets need to be merged together, one will not work without the other.  leif wants to change #11321 such that it does not depend on this ticket, but I think that's unnecessary.

> Is the proposal to close this ticket and merge the lcalc 1.23.p8 spkg from #11321, but not the two subsequent patches on that ticket, and the "needs review" there applies to the subsequent patches?

needs_review on that ticket applies to everything.  I created the .p8, leif raised some concerns about the .p8 and is proposing a .p9 but it doesn't materialize.

> Or are we going to wait for a p9 spkg at #11321, in which case we would probably need to test everything here over again?

As far as I'm concerned, we can merge the .p8 as it is but it still needs_review.  I don't believe leif's concerns are serious enough that they should prevent the spkg from being merged.

I guess in this case, it does not really matter.  I went for a minimal change.

If I just rerun `./sage -b` (surely that will fix it, right? :), I get
