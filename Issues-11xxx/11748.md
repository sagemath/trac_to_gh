Ask Karl-Dieter; he really likes to create them. ;-)

  *"Files prefixed with `._` contain all of the metadata for their un-prefixed partner that the native volume format cannot contain in a single file."*

You could at least cc: someone you are being snarky to on a ticket.  I do my best to get rid of such things, but I do not have Linux, and Mac is extremely aggressive at creating them.

War doch nicht böse gemeint.  Ausserdem war das zu dem Zeitpunkt, als du selbst den Finder dafür verflucht hast, dass er deine spkgs kontaminiert (die daraufhin zurückgewiesen wurden).

Wenn du die besagten Dateinamen googlest, findest du auch jede Menge Apple-Fans, die von dem schwer zu vermeidenden Verhalten des Finders begeistert sind...

Eben**dt**.

For the record:

```sh
$ find . -name .DS_Store -o -name ._.DS_Store -exec rm {} \;
```
(Or replace "`.`" by the base directory or directories from where you want to recursively remove all such files.)

Weiss man manchmal nicht, aber jetzt sehe ich, das war schon vor Monate, 'tschuldigung.

> Wenn du die besagten Dateinamen googlest, findest du auch jede Menge Apple-Fans, die von dem schwer zu vermeidenden Verhalten des Finders begeistert sind...


Haha!

```sh
$ find . -name .DS_Store -o -name ._.DS_Store -exec rm {} \;
```
Which of course I will not remember :)  By the way, what is the deal with the `._.DS_Store` files?  They seem to disappear when I remove the regular ones.  I read what you said above, so I guess they just magically disappear when their "parent" files are gone?  Hope so. 

Sorry for hijacking the ticket.
