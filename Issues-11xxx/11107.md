I discovered this after trying to debug a Linux installation.

The bzip2 package (in particular the file `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/bzip2-1.0.5-install`) handles SAGE64 in a different way to the all other packages. It has:

```
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" -a "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
   echo "Building 64 bit OSX release"
   CFLAGS="-O2 -g -m64 " && export CFLAGS
fi

if [ `uname` = "SunOS" -a "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
   echo "Building 64 bit Solaris release"
   CFLAGS="-O2 -g -m64 " && export CFLAGS
fi
```

Faster, more flexible and more portable would be:

```
if [ "x$CFLAG64" = x ] ; then
   CFLAG64=-m64
fi

if [ "x$SAGE64" = xyes ]; then
   echo "Building a 64 bit version of bzip2"
   CFLAGS="-O2 -g $CFLAG64 $CFLAGS"
   export CFLAGS
fi
```

This would
* Be consistent with all other packages. 
* Work on any platform, which might be useful on some like AIX
* Could help debug some Linux issues if Linux is building 32-bit. (I found this useful to help someone on sage-support)
* Avoids two calls to `uname` 
* Allows any flag to be used for building 64-bit executable, not just the one use by Sun/Oracle compilers and GCC. Commercial compilers for both AIX and HP-UX use different flags. 
* Would allow any flags set by the user in CFLAGS to override those here. However, currently setting CFLAGS globally in Sage can not be considered a good idea, but that's a more general bug and well outside the scope of this ticket.
