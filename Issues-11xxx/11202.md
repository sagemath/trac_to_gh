Mathematica has an `InverseFunction` function:

http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/InverseFunction.html

Sage can accomplish this via the `roots` method, as described on AskSage: http://ask.sagemath.org/question/502/can-sage-compute-the-inverse-of-a-function

However, there is no "convenience" method to find inverses of symbolic expressions. Since `roots` itself just calls Maxima's `solve`, it should be relatively straightforward to implement an `inverse` method in the same fashion. This should also be able to find the inverse of vector functions (`n`-dimensional input, `n`-dimensional output).

I've taken a look at your patch (haven't tried it yet). It looks like good work! Here's some feedback:

```
if not with_respect_to: 
  raise TypeError('You must specify with respect to which \ 
	variable to take the inverse.') 
```
I would test for

```
if with_respect_to == None or not with_respect_to.is_symbol():
```
I also think that a `ValueError` is more appropriate than a `TypeError`.

Also, it would be a nice enhancement if something like this would work:

```
sage: f(x) = log(x)
sage: f
x |--> log(x)
sage: inverse(f)
x |--> exp(x)
```
(or does it?)

Is there a good reason that:

```python
sage: y = var('y')
sage: log(x).inverse(y)
```
should return `[y == exp(x)]` rather than `[x == exp(y)]`? I find the latter much more intuitive.

The tests should also cover some cases where errors are raised.

More trivially, there are some violated conventions in the docstring:

- extra indentation and `-` instead of `--` in the `INPUT:` section
- formatting of `OUTPUT:` section
