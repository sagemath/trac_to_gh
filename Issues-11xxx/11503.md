In an effort to remove Jmol from the notebook in the Flask notebook it is being moved to SAGE_LOCAL/share. This is based on the logic that the notebook can run without Jmol, but Sage cannot run without either the notebook or Jmol even when using just the command line.

To achieve this relocation of Jmol:

1. install the **spkg** [http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/gutow/jmol-12.2.21.p0.spkg](http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/gutow/jmol-12.2.21.p0.spkg)

2. **Apply** [attachment:trac-11503-jmol-spkg.2.patch] to the **sage root** repository.

3. **Apply** [attachment:trac-11503-jmol-commandline.patch] to the sage repository (fixes jmol on the command line)

The necessary patch for sagenb has already been merged with the master sagenb branch: https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/28

Assignee: @gutow

CC:  rado @kiwifb @strogdon

Keywords: sd31 Jmol flask

Reviewer: Dan Drake, Jason Grout, Punarbasu Purkayastha

Author: Jonathan Gutow

Merged: sage-5.2.beta0

Dependencies: #11080, #11078, #11874

Resolution: fixed

Several comments: 

- There are some backup files present: SPKG.txt~ and spkg-install~.  
- As I noted on #11496, you should copy the jmol shell script to SAGE_LOCAL/bin as part of spkg-install.
- It would be helpful if you could prepare the mercurial repository with the version of hg installed with Sage.  When I use the version included with Sage (which is the only version on my computer), I get

```
$ hg status
abort: requirement 'dotencode' not supported!
```
 so I can't check the state of the repo without installing a new version of hg.

  * Not sure if I can manage to successfully backtrack on the Hg repository format.  In order to work with the flask-notebook on my machine, I found I needed a system install of Hg and I got the latest.  Is this going to be a hold up?  Hg has been a real pain compared to the other version control systems I've  used.  Can somebody point out how to do the backtrack cleanly and quickly.  If it takes me a couple of hours to untangle Hg that's more time than it will take me to fix the rest of the .spkg problems and more time than I have for this project at the moment.



Replying to [jhpalmieri](#comment%3A8):

I upgraded my version of mercurial so I can look at the repo, and I hope that the version included with Sage will be upgraded soon, too (see #10594).  Oh, and now I see that I can open this repo with the old version.  Anyway, there are some uncommitted files:

I'm looking this over, and I have some more minor nits to pick with spkg-install. Here's an idiom I see a couple times:

```
TEMPDIR=something
cd "$TEMPDIR"
do some stuff
...
```
Two things bother me about that: (1) you call it `TEMPDIR`, which implies to me that it's a temporary directory used for some scratch work, but you're talking about an existing directory with important files in it. (2) You never use the `TEMPDIR` variable, except in the `cd` command...so why not just `cd` to the directory?

Also, I think it's more readable to just put the paths into commands, rather than `cd`ing around. I would prefer to see

```
cp $SAGE_FOO/dir/file.txt $SAGE_BAR/dir/dir2/
```
rather than

```
cd $SAGE_FOO/dir
cp file.txt $SAGE_BAR/dir/dir2/
```
It makes it easier to read the script, since you don't have to remember what the working directory is. Also, you sometimes change directories inside an if-then-else, so the working directory depends on what happened there!

Finally, at the end of `spkg-install`, you have "PACKAGE NAME" instead of Jmol!

Attachment [trac11503.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket11503/trac11503.patch) by @dandrake created at 2012-01-11 07:13:09

I've looked over the spkg, and modulo my fixes to `spkg-install`, I can give it a positive review. My changes are in attachment:trac11503.patch and I have a spkg with those changes at http://sagenb.kaist.ac.kr/~drake/Jmol-12.0.45.p3.spkg. It's identical to Jonathan's version except for the changes in attachment:trac11503.patch.

Jason, you volunteered to look it over, but that shouldn't stop anyone else. :)

Dan's changes look good to me (obviously much more experience writing these scripts than I have:)) I suggest we try Dan's .spkg for the review and have changed the description to reflect this.
