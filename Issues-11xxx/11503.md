In an effort to remove Jmol from the notebook in the Flask notebook it is being moved to SAGE_LOCAL/share. This is based on the logic that the notebook can run without Jmol, but Sage cannot run without either the notebook or Jmol even when using just the command line.

To achieve this relocation of Jmol:

1. install the **spkg** [http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/gutow/jmol-12.2.21.p0.spkg](http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/gutow/jmol-12.2.21.p0.spkg)

2. **Apply** [attachment: trac-11503-jmol-spkg.2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11503/trac-11503-jmol-spkg.2.patch.gz) to the **sage root** repository.

3. **Apply** [attachment: trac-11503-jmol-commandline.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11503/trac-11503-jmol-commandline.patch.gz) to the sage repository (fixes jmol on the command line)

The necessary patch for sagenb has already been merged with the master sagenb branch: https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/28

Depends on #11080
Depends on #11078
Depends on #11874

Several comments: 

- There are some backup files present: SPKG.txt~ and spkg-install~.  
- As I noted on #11496, you should copy the jmol shell script to SAGE_LOCAL/bin as part of spkg-install.
- It would be helpful if you could prepare the mercurial repository with the version of hg installed with Sage.  When I use the version included with Sage (which is the only version on my computer), I get

```
$ hg status
abort: requirement 'dotencode' not supported!
```
 so I can't check the state of the repo without installing a new version of hg.

* Hmm...didn't notice the backup files. Â I'll look into that...
  * I could add the Jmol script to the jmol .spkg. Â The one that is in there is the generic install not the one for SAGE...It seems reasonable that it should not be tracked by SAGE...I will add the SAGE version as a patch to the .spkg. Â Once I get this done, I believeÂ #11496Â should be closed, as it will no longer apply...let me know who to notify about that.
  * Not sure if I can manage to successfully backtrack on the Hg repository format. Â In order to work with the flask-notebook on my machine, I found I needed a system install of Hg and I got the latest. Â Is this going to be a hold up? Â Hg has been a real pain compared to the other version control systems I've Â used. Â Can somebody point out how to do the backtrack cleanly and quickly. Â If it takes me a couple of hours to untangle Hg that's more time than it will take me to fix the rest of the .spkg problems and more time than I have for this project at the moment.

I upgraded my version of mercurial so I can look at the repo, and I hope that the version included with Sage will be upgraded soon, too (see #10594).  Oh, and now I see that I can open this repo with the old version.  Anyway, there are some uncommitted files:

```
$ hg status
? patches/Jmol.js.patch
? patches/jmol.patch
```
(So you should run "hg add" and then commit again.)

The file spkg-install needs some work.  In particular, any variable which refers to a path should be quoted, in case there are spaces in it.  (Right now, we don't support having spaces in the path where Sage is, but when it's easy to allow, we should.)  I think this should do it:

The below is done. Â Try downloading the spkg again after 3 PM CDT.

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment:12):

> I upgraded my version of mercurial so I can look at the repo, and I hope that the version included with Sage will be upgraded soon, too (see #10594).  Oh, and now I see that I can open this repo with the old version.  Anyway, there are some uncommitted files: ` $ hg status ? patches/Jmol.js.patch ? patches/jmol.patch ` (So you should run "hg add" and then commit again.) The file spkg-install needs some work.  In particular, any variable which refers to a path should be quoted, in case there are spaces in it.  (Right now, we don't support having spaces in the path where Sage is, but when it's easy to allow, we should.)

I'm looking this over, and I have some more minor nits to pick with spkg-install. Here's an idiom I see a couple times:

```
TEMPDIR=something
cd "$TEMPDIR"
do some stuff
...
```
Two things bother me about that: (1) you call it `TEMPDIR`, which implies to me that it's a temporary directory used for some scratch work, but you're talking about an existing directory with important files in it. (2) You never use the `TEMPDIR` variable, except in the `cd` command...so why not just `cd` to the directory?

Also, I think it's more readable to just put the paths into commands, rather than `cd`ing around. I would prefer to see

```
cp $SAGE_FOO/dir/file.txt $SAGE_BAR/dir/dir2/
```
rather than

```
cd $SAGE_FOO/dir
cp file.txt $SAGE_BAR/dir/dir2/
```
It makes it easier to read the script, since you don't have to remember what the working directory is. Also, you sometimes change directories inside an if-then-else, so the working directory depends on what happened there!

Finally, at the end of `spkg-install`, you have "PACKAGE NAME" instead of Jmol!
