In an effort to remove Jmol from the notebook in the Flask notebook it is being moved to SAGE_LOCAL/share. This is based on the logic that the notebook can run without Jmol, but Sage cannot run without either the notebook or Jmol even when using just the command line.

To achieve this relocation of Jmol:

1. install the **spkg** [http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/gutow/jmol-12.2.21.p0.spkg](http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/gutow/jmol-12.2.21.p0.spkg)

2. **Apply** [attachment:trac-11503-jmol-spkg.2.patch] to the **sage root** repository.

3. **Apply** [attachment:trac-11503-jmol-commandline.patch] to the sage repository (fixes jmol on the command line)

The necessary patch for sagenb has already been merged with the master sagenb branch: https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/28

Assignee: @gutow

CC:  rado @kiwifb @strogdon

  * Not sure if I can manage to successfully backtrack on the Hg repository format.  In order to work with the flask-notebook on my machine, I found I needed a system install of Hg and I got the latest.  Is this going to be a hold up?  Hg has been a real pain compared to the other version control systems I've  used.  Can somebody point out how to do the backtrack cleanly and quickly.  If it takes me a couple of hours to untangle Hg that's more time than it will take me to fix the rest of the .spkg problems and more time than I have for this project at the moment.

It makes it easier to read the script, since you don't have to remember what the working directory is. Also, you sometimes change directories inside an if-then-else, so the working directory depends on what happened there!

Finally, at the end of `spkg-install`, you have "PACKAGE NAME" instead of Jmol!
