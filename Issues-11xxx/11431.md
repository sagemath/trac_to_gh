On [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/f35e6064434dacdc), Francisco Botana complained about some shortcomings of the conversion from Singular (pexpect interface) to Sage.

I think the conversions provided by this patch are quite thorough. 

First of all, the patch provides a conversion of base rings, even with minpoly, with complicated block, matrix and weighted orders (note that one needs #11316) and even quotient rings:

```
sage: singular.eval('ring r1 = (9,x),(a,b,c,d,e,f),(M((1,2,3,0)),wp(2,3),lp)')
'ring r1 = (9,x),(a,b,c,d,e,f),(M((1,2,3,0)),wp(2,3),lp);'
sage: R = singular('r1').sage_basering()
sage: R
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b, c, d, e, f over Finite Field in x of size 3^2
sage: R.term_order()
Block term order with blocks:
(Matrix term order with matrix
[1 2]
[3 0],
 Weighted degree reverse lexicographic term order with weights (2, 3),
 Lexicographic term order of length 2)

sage: singular.eval('ring r3 = (3,z),(a,b,c),dp')
'ring r3 = (3,z),(a,b,c),dp;'
sage: singular.eval('minpoly = 1+z+z2+z3+z4')
'minpoly = 1+z+z2+z3+z4;'
sage: singular('r3').sage_basering()
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b, c over Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in z over Finite Field of size 3 with modulus z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1

sage: singular.eval('ring r5 = (9,a), (x,y,z),lp') 
'ring r5 = (9,a), (x,y,z),lp;'
sage: Q = singular('std(ideal(x^2,x+y^2+z^3))', type='qring')
sage: Q.sage_basering()
Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Finite Field in a of size 3^2 by the ideal (y^4 - y^2*z^3 + z^6, x + y^2 + z^3)
```

By consequence, it is now straight forward to convert polynomials or ideals to sage:

```
sage: singular.eval('ring R = integer, (x,y,z),lp') 
'// ** You are using coefficient rings which are not fields...'
sage: I = singular.ideal(['x^2','y*z','z+x']) 
sage: I.sage()  # indirect doctest
Ideal (x^2, y*z, x + z) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Integer Ring

# Note that conversion of a Singular string to a Sage string was missing
sage: singular('ringlist(basering)').sage()
[['integer'], ['x', 'y', 'z'], [['lp', (1, 1, 1)], ['C', (0)]], Ideal (0) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Integer Ring]

sage: singular.eval('ring r10 = (9,a), (x,y,z),lp')
'ring r10 = (9,a), (x,y,z),lp;'
sage: Q = singular('std(ideal(x^2,x+y^2+z^3))', type='qring')
sage: Q.sage()
Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Finite Field in a of size 3^2 by the ideal (y^4 - y^2*z^3 + z^6, x + y^2 + z^3)
sage: singular('x^2+y').sage()
x^2 + y
sage: singular('x^2+y').sage().parent()
Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Finite Field in a of size 3^2 by the ideal (y^4 - y^2*z^3 + z^6, x + y^2 + z^3)
```

So far, the method `sage()` has not been mentioned at all in the documentation of `sage.interfaces.singular`! Therefore I added a second patch, providing some use cases of `.sage()` in the short tutorial of `sage.interfaces.singular`.

The examples that are visible in the html version of the documentation still do not cover all features (quotient rings etc.), but I guess if a user knows about the existence of `sage()` (s)he will guess its correct usage.

Hi Martin!

Replying to [@malb](#comment%3A3):
> * can we rename `sage_basering` to `sage_global_ring`. In Sage `base_ring` has a special meaning which is not meant in your patch. I think global ring captures it.

Sounds fine to me. Obviously I took the name `sage_basering` from Singular, but you are right that it might be confusing for people who know the notion `base ring` only from Sage.

> * don't real fields also have a precision in Singular?

Right, that should be taken care of as well.

> * Can you also fix "If it is provided, then you *must* take care OFF it."?

Why "off"? With two f?

Wouldn't it be correct English to say "If it is provided, then you must take care that it matches the current ring in Singular"? (i.e., I forgot the "that" in my patch)

> * shouldn't `TermOrder_from_Singular` be lower-case since it's a function? Or were you aiming for upper-case because it's a constructor?

I made it upper case because it returns a `TermOrder` (that is how the class is called). But actually I was ignorant to the convention that functions are lower-case. So I'll change it.

> * In "Invalid termorder in Singular" shouldn't it be term order, i.e. with a space?

Yep!

**Attachment:** [trac11431_singular_sage_documentation.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11431/trac11431_singular_sage_documentation.patch)

I've put my changes into the second patch, so, please replace that when you test it.

*Names*: I changed `sage_basering` into `sage_global_ring` and `TermOrder_from_Singular` into `termorder_from_singular`.

*Precision*: Singular does not tell the precision of a real field in `charstr()`, it does so only for complex fields. But the precision both of real and complex fields is part of `ringlist()`. So, both in the real and the complex case, I take the precision from there, not from `charstr()`.

*Grammar*: It is now "Invalid term order" (not "termorder") and "If it is provided, then you have to make sure that it matches..." (not "If it is provided, then you *must* take care it matches...")

*Tests*: Of course I added a test showing that the precision of real fields is taken care of. And it turned out that one doctest needed a fix, because when I created it I used a different term order (so that the same polynomial was printed in a different way).

That is very strange. I can not imagine that my patch introduced that bug: It changes the conversion from Singular to Sage, but it should not change Singular itself (and what you get in your example is an error from Singular, not from the interface).

Hence, I wonder whether my patch has *introduced* or *uncovered* that bug.

Can you test on marks and t2 with unpatched Sage whether the line

```
sage: singular.eval('ring r1 = (9,x),(a,b,c,d,e,f),(M((1,2,3,0)),wp(2,3),lp)')
```
fails?

I was able to build sage-4.7.1.rc1 on mark (which is supposed to be identical with mark2). It turns out that the bug was not *introduced* but *revealed* by my patch.

With the freshly built Sage-on-mark, I get

```
sage: singular.eval('ring r1 = (9,x),(a,b,c,d,e,f),(M((1,2,3,0)),wp(2,3),lp)')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/simonking/SAGE/sage-4.7.1.rc1mark/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/interfaces/singular.pyc in eval(self, x, allow_semicolon, strip, **kwds)
    548
    549         if s.find("error") != -1 or s.find("Segment fault") != -1:
--> 550             raise RuntimeError, 'Singular error:\n%s'%s
    551
    552         if get_verbose() > 0:

RuntimeError: Singular error:
   ? cannot open `gftables/9`
   ? cannot make ring
   ? error occurred in or before STDIN line 25: `ring r1 = (9,x),(a,b,c,d,e,f),(M((1,2,3,0)),wp(2,3),lp);`
   ? expected ring-expression. type 'help ring;'
```

The question is: How shall we proceed? Removing that particular test would be a shame, since it shows that my patch can manage to parse pretty complicated stuff. Perhaps it is  possible to simplify it, so that it is still complicated, but works on mark and t2.

In either case, I will report on sage-solaris, and probably will file a bug report to the Singular team as well.

**Attachment:** [trac11431_solaris_workaround.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11431/trac11431_solaris_workaround.patch)

I provided a third patch that uses - as a workaround - the fact that libsingular is able to create missing gftables files.

On Singular trac, Hannes said "No, gftables are parts of the sources and will be copied during installation, but usually not computed (the program for that, a part of factory, will not be build during a standard compilation and installation). 

So, I wonder why the files aren't copied on Solaris and how libsingular is able to create them. But I think the third patch (that isn't tested, yet) should suffice to make the doc tests of the first two patches work on solaris.

Back to "needs review" - I hope that someone can doctest on Solaris.

Note that #11645 also fixes the problem with the new doc test.

So, if someone would like to review my patches, I see two ways to make things work:

Either

1. get #11645 and [and [attachment:trac11431_singular_sage_documentation.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11431/a3c4803dcf8574e4a3bfad29fdfabf07.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11431/3539405a7167a700879e8b046f03ef44.patch))

What's the status of this ticket now?  Since #11645 has been merged in sage-4.7.1, we can assume that as prerequisite.  Which patches should be applied then?

If somebody can give these patches a "tentative positive review" (without testing on Solaris), I can test them on the buildbot machines, including Solaris.
