The following does not work (as seen on #10140):

**Apply**
1. [attachment:trac_10140_sublattice_intersection.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11396/trac_10140_sublattice_intersection.patch)

The patch buildbot fails to understand this syntax and will try to apply all attached patches instead.

I've added a new comment with a new "Apply" line to #10140 and it did reset the patch list. But the last patch on the "Apply" line is not being picked up, and I can't figure out why.
