```
In the notebook, looking at the source of some methods ends with a Traceback and then the notebook keeps being busy until I interrupt the computation.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open notebook (tested on sage-4.7.2.alpha2 and alpha3)

2. create matrix, e.g. (without the sage:)

```
sage: m = random_matrix(ZZ,100);  m
```

3. look at source of the `determinant()` method:

```
sage: m.determinant??
```

It seems like the source formatter gets confused by the traceback in the method's docstring. See attached screenshot for illustration.

The traceback is hidden by the method "format_exception" in sage.server.notebook.cell. That function is called by the method `parse_html`, if the cell is not interactive (line 1500 of sage.server.notebook.cell).

Strange. I modified the function, such that some protocol output is put into a file when it is called. But apparently it is NOT called when requesting the source of an object.

Is there code for the notebook that can not be found with search_src?

That is really an awkward situation. I would try to fix the problem using trac. But I would certainly not learn how to use github just for fixing a notebook problem: After all, I am hardly using the notebook, myself.

> At one point, I also thought I had opened a sagenb ticket saying that they needed to synchronize with the newest version of Sage's sageinspect, but I couldn't find that one.

Sagenb ticket meaning that it is a github thingy? Or is it here?

I think, if there is new stuff in devel/sagenb/sagenb/misc and in devel/sagenb/sagenb/interfaces, then it should be moved to devel/sage/sage/misc and devel/sage/sage/interfaces. Afterwards, devel/sagenb/sagenb/misc and devel/sagenb/sagenb/interfaces should be deleted and the stuff from the sage repository should be used instead.

In other words, I think that synchronisation is the wrong approach, since synchronisation would preserve the duplication of code.

Code that is found elsewhere in sage or even new code that is likely to be useful elsewhere in sage does not belong to devel/sagenb/sagenb/ and should be (re-)moved.

sageinspect.py is designed to inspect *__Sage__* source code. It first tries to use python's inspect module to do the job, but when it fails (and this is likely the case in Cython code) then it tries to find the source files - and these source files are searched for *in the devel/sage/sage repository*.

Hence, if what you say is true, then the notebook should not use sageinspect.py at all.

I'm not sure mine is a perfect solution, but it basically works. I still see the "Traceback", but nothing hangs. If I click to the left of the docstring, it shows the rest of the source.

Edit: maybe what I mean to say is this: I think my changes are beneficial and should be merged anyway. Then we can tinker with how the notebook displays source code involving Tracebacks afterwards.
