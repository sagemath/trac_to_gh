Previously, there were some problems with the unit convert function, namely that variables were not allowed. The following now works:

```
sage: sage.symbolic.units.convert(50 * x * units.area.square_meter, units.area.acre)
(1953125/158080329*x)*acre
```

As well, previously units were sometimes "mixed" with the returned symbolic (see http://ask.sagemath.org/question/641/radian-degree-conversion). Now, the following works:

```
sage: sage.symbolic.units.convert(cos(50) * units.angles.radian, units.angles.degree)
(180*cos(50)/pi)*degree
```
