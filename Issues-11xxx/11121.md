As above. See some discussion at [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/f5a9c012f6299a9e).

This would involve making the Mercurial spkg install an hgrc at $SAGE_LOCAL/etc/mercurial/hgrc as well as adding lines to .hg/hgrc in the major repositories in the sage distribution (`.`, `data/extcode`, `devel/sage/`, `devel/sagenb/`, and `local/bin/`). I exclude `examples` and `spkg/base` because they are scheduled to be gotten rid of (#7494 and #11073 respectively).

`$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin` is the Sage scripts repo, so it's fine to patch it.  Or maybe I don't understand your complaint.

Kini, do you also want to patch the Sage root repo?  Its spkg-install file is `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/root-spkg-install`.

I guess it seems that enabling these extensions reflects the opinions of a few people, and it might be safer to just implement a few important changes (like git=true).  Anyway, here are some of my questions and opinions:

```
[trusted] 
users = $USER     is this necessary?  what happens if we leave this out?

[diff] 
git = true        seems like a good idea

[extensions] 
color =           innocuous
graphlog =        innocuous, but should it be "hgext.graphlog="?  That's what the docs say.
mq =              useful, keep it
pager =           see my comments below.
progress =        innocuous
purge =           should this be "hgext.purge="?  provides a potentially useful, but potentially dangerous, command
rebase =          seems okay, but I've never used it
record =          "hgext.record="?
relink =          seems okay, but never used it
transplant =      seems okay, but never used it
```
Regarding "pager": first, should we follow the [Mercurial suggestions](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/PagerExtension) and do

```
[pager]
pager = LESS='FSRX' less
```
Second, if we use the pager extension, will it interfere with Sage functions like `hg_sage.diff()`?  These are defined in SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/misc/hg.py, and they call a pager already, a different one depending on whether working from the command-line or in the notebook.

<a id='comment:19'></a>Actually, let me revise one comment: the "color" extension is not innocuous: when it's enabled, the output from "hg_sage.status()" in the notebook has stray characters, presumably coming from the ASCII color-changing codes.  It looks like this:

```
Getting status of modified or unknown files:
cd "/Applications/sage/devel/sage" && hg status
[0;34;1mM sage/algebras/steenrod_algebra_bases.py[0m
```
The last line should be

```
M sage/algebras/steenrod_algebra_bases.py
```
On the other hand, with the color extension enabled, the output looks good from the command line.  So if we want to use color, we should have separate hgrc files, one for the notebook and one for the command-line. 

I'm a little suspicious of enabling some of the others of these in the notebook, for example "progress".  On the bright side, enabling "pager" doesn't seem to have any detrimental effect in the notebook.

* The suggestions for parameters to `less` given on the Mercurial wiki are also a matter of personal preference. By default, `less` doesn't leave anything in the terminal after it exits (it restores whatever was on the screen before you called it), but the `X` option disables this behavior. The `F` option also disables this behavior, in a sense, by acting like `cat` when the screen is large enough to take the entire output. The `S` option truncates long lines instead of wrapping them. The `R` option (which is in my patch) displays (ANSI) terminal color codes. My preference is still to just keep `R` of these four, but whoever wrote the Mercurial wiki article disagrees. It's not really possible to be that objective about this, I think...

I'll go take a look at #11142.

I'm confused.  So does that mean that now anyone without a .hgrc file will automatically have all this?  

In that case, I agree that maybe just the things that are necessary should be fixed, and the rest left optional but well documented in the devel manual.

<a id='comment:39'></a>Since the file SAGE_LOCAL/etc/mercurial/hgrc sets "git=true", do we also need to set it for each repository individually?  That is, do we need all of these patches, or just the one present in the new spkg in #10594?

So if someone doesn't have this set, then what would 

```
hg_sage.log()
```
do?  I tremble to think of the brand-new developer, who is not sure how to set up hg as an alias, trying this and being deluged by thousands of changes... At any rate, hg_sage.[tab] things should continue behaving as they have in this respect, using either 'more' or 'less' as the default (I don't know which it is, though).

As this falls into the category of surprising (if not annoying) "features", I'd say `sage-clone` should then copy it over.

Do I read correctly that the things remaining to review are 
* the patch to the root repo
* the patch to the sage-clone script
And that we only want to have these have `git=True`, and not enable queues or add a username or anything like that?  It doesn't look like it appends to anything - I thought, based on the above, that this file is created at that time.

I'll vouch for that (is that allowed?)

Looks good to me too, but again, I am a co-author on this ticket.

Well, when you make a clone, a new .hgrc file is written, saying something like

```
[paths]
default = .../devel/sage
```
I'm not sure of the purpose of this, but I thought we should append to it, not overwrite it.
