John Cremona tells me that: "All data for elliptic curves of conductors from 130k to 200k is at
http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/data/ and also as a tar
file at http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/ecdata-2011-10-26.tgz 
-- not to mention at http://code.google.com/p/ecdata/ !"

The goal of this ticket is to:

(1) Create a new drop-in-replacement sqlite database that has the data up to level 10000, which will be included standard with Sage.

(2) Create a new sqlite database that has the data up to level 200000, which will be an optional spkg.

This is complicated because the current packages in Sage use ZODB.  Also, Cremona's database format has changed somewhat. 

There is now a patch that depends upon #11642 (which depends upon #11640).

You can find updated elliptic_curve and database_cremona_ellcurve spkgs at [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/cremona-database/](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/cremona-database/).

<a id='comment:5'></a>I have a few questions.  Also since I do not know SQLITE and do not have the time to learn it just for this, the code will need to be reviewed by someone else.

There are two spkgs at the link, and one patch on this ticket.  Please can you explain how they are related?  Is one of the spkgs intended to be part of the standard Sage distribution so that every copy of Sage has the mini-database, as is the case now?

Secondly, you warn that the database takes some time to create.  Is this once-only time which you had to spend in creating the database which is part of the spkg, or is it time which must be spent by anyone installing the large optional spkg?

To test this, I assume that the following steps are necessary; please correct me if I am wrong.

1. apply patches at #11642

Lastly:  I expect that at regular intervals over the next few months I will be releasing updates to the database (for example, the range 170k=180k is about 70% done already).

The elliptic_curve spkg is included every copy of sage, and includes both the mini-database, as well as a very small database of curves William finds interesting. The database_cremona_ellcurve spkg includes (most of) the data from allcurves, allgens, allbsd, and degphi for every curve that you have listed.\n \n> Secondly, you warn that the database takes some time to create.  Is this once-only time which you had to spend in creating the database which is part of the spkg, or is it time which must be spent by anyone installing the large optional spkg?\n\n\nCurrently the spkgs simply install pre-built SQL databases, so currently this is a once-only thing.

The only thing to be aware of is that #11642 depends on #11640 (which is just a small patch), and that there are optional doctests you should run in step 7.\n\n> Lastly:  I expect that at regular intervals over the next few months I will be releasing updates to the database (for example, the range 170k=180k is about 70% done already).

The former:\n\n```\nrm SAGE_ROOT/data/cremona/cremona.db\nSAGE_ROOT/sage\nsage: sage.databases.cremona.build('cremona','/path/to/ecdata.tgz')\n```\nthe later should be (although I haven't tested it):\n\n```\nmake a directory that only contains the new files\nSAGE_ROOT/sage\nsage: cData = sage.databases.cremona.LargeCremonaDatabase('cremona',False)\nsage: cData._init_from_ftpdata('/path/to/said/directory')\n```\nThat said, I've marked myself as the maintainer of the database_cremona_ellcurve spkg, so I'll try to keep it up to date (of course it would help if you let me know when you update your tables of course (: ).",

The patch updates sage.databases.cremona to wrap the new SQLite databases. It provides about the same functionality as the old ZODB (there are some slight modifications to actually reflect the documentation, which wasn't respected before -- specifically the mini-database only has data from allcurves).

> Is one of the spkgs intended to be part of the standard Sage distribution so that every copy of Sage has the mini-database, as is the case now?  And is the other one a replacement for the optional large database?


Correct. The elliptic_curve spkg is included every copy of sage, and includes both the mini-database, as well as a very small database of curves William finds interesting. The database_cremona_ellcurve spkg includes (most of) the data from allcurves, allgens, allbsd, and degphi for every curve that you have listed.
 
> Secondly, you warn that the database takes some time to create.  Is this once-only time which you had to spend in creating the database which is part of the spkg, or is it time which must be spent by anyone installing the large optional spkg?


Currently the spkgs simply install pre-built SQL databases, so currently this is a once-only thing. That said, on my home system it only takes ~4mins to create the database from scratch.

> To test this, I assume that the following steps are necessary; please correct me if I am wrong.
1. apply patches at #11642
2. apply the patch here (trac_11587.patch)
3. sage -b
4. sage -i http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/cremona-database/elliptic_curves-0.2.spkg
5. sage -b, test everything works
6. sage -i http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/cremona-database/database_cremona_ellcurve-20110801.spkg
7. sage -b, test everything still works

Yes, that looks correct. The only thing to be aware of is that #11642 depends on #11640 (which is just a small patch), and that there are optional doctests you should run in step 7.

> Lastly:  I expect that at regular intervals over the next few months I will be releasing updates to the database (for example, the range 170k=180k is about 70% done already).  Please leave rather clear instructions for what to do for future updates;  in particular, will it be neceaary to rebuild everything, or just to read in the new files (e.g. *.170000-179999 next time)?


Currently there is simple script to rebuild everything, but (in theory) it is also possible to simply add the new files. The former:

```
rm SAGE_ROOT/data/cremona/cremona.db
SAGE_ROOT/sage
sage: sage.databases.cremona.build('cremona','/path/to/ecdata.tgz')
```
the later should be (although I haven't tested it):

```
make a directory that only contains the new files
SAGE_ROOT/sage
sage: cData = sage.databases.cremona.LargeCremonaDatabase('cremona',False)
sage: cData._init_from_ftpdata('/path/to/said/directory')
```
That said, I've marked myself as the maintainer of the database_cremona_ellcurve spkg, so I'll try to keep it up to date (of course it would help if you let me know when you update your tables of course (: ).

Optional is optional; I'm not aware of any size demands or restrictions there...

True, but I realized when updating the spkg that creating the database from text files more closely follows the spkg design of building libraries from source.

Currently the spkg includes basically a single file -- a prebuilt database. This is primarily because it is much faster to have the package copy the file, rather than build the database from scratch (I was going to use time it takes to create it on sage.math as an example, but I got too impatient to let it finish).

There is still a bit of hard-wired code: a bit in the documentation, the build script, and an error message. It is possible to remove all of these references, the only reason I didn't when working on this patch was because I wanted to get sage up to speed. It is a simple fix, although if we decide remove the build scripts from the sage library to the spkg instead, we might as well do this at the same time.

Thanks for the explanation.  I agree that it is good to have the database file itself in the package and not the raw data, as long as it (the spkg) also has instructions on how to (re)create this from my raw data.  And a note of the precise things to be changed when the range is extended would also be a good idea, even if that's only a couple of places.

Why not open a follow-up (blocker) ticket for fixing that?

It has always been rather a nuisance that the small default database differs from the large one not only in having fewer curves but in having less information about them (specifically, omits the known rank and generators).  I don't want to delay this ticket longer than necessary (and apologise for the positive review which missed this glitch) but propose a follow-up which includes all known data for the small database too.

Then we should also remove [http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/database_cremona_ellcurve-20110915.spkg](http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/database_cremona_ellcurve-20110915.spkg) again, since it is in the new format (which only the alpha3 supports); either when alpha4 is officially released, or right before the final 4.7.2 gets out.

It shouldn't be hard to change its `spkg-install` to just install the previous version (hard-coded URL, e.g. by recursively calling `sage -i ...` or `sage-spkg`) if the Sage version present doesn't support the new format, which is reasonable for the future anyway (i.e., when this ticket gets remerged).

I fully agree, but unfortunately it's relatively easy to "unmerge" this ticket, and it's in general not up to the *release manager* to fix such things (that go beyond simple rebasing, fixing noise, permissions or commit messages etc., which IMHO at least partially already is a *voluntary* service).

<a id='comment:65'></a>Doing a full test after installing the new optional database (onto 4.8.alpha4) I find one doctest failure in devel/sage/doc/en/bordeaux_2008/elliptic_curves.rst:

```

since that curve is now in the database and the listed generators are different.  I suggest instead 

```
