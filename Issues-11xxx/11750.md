The problem 

sage: CRT([32r,2r,2r],[60r,90r,150r]) ... AttributeError?: 'int' object has no attribute 'lcm'

can easily be fixed by changing

m = m.lcm(moduli[i]) to

m = lcm(m,moduli[i])

in Maarten's patch. Perhaps, Maarten can issue an update on his patch.

Ok, although I would have written something like
  *"But **if some of the moduli have non-trivial common divisors** there is not always a solution:"*
(otherwise *non coprime* should have a hyphen in it, but that's IMHO a minor issue).

So **positive review** from me. (Feel free to revert this in case you disagree or want to change the patch again.)

P.S.:

I left the ticket as "needs review" since I expected some response from any of the author(s) or other reviewers (i.e., their opinion). Since it was still needing review anyway, I didn't set it to "needs info".

If I had been 100% sure about "comprime" being a typo, I would have set it to "needs work" of course (and changed the ticket's title myself). Adding an explanatory sentence to the new example was just a suggestion, of IMO minor importance.

P.P.S.: Jeroen requested us to use unique (i.e. full) names in the "Author(s)" and "Reviewer(s)" fields, so I changed Luis' according to his wiki list entry.

Here is my review:

1) The patch is correct. 
2) when I ran ./sage --testall --long it complained about cmdline.py
   sage -t --long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/tests/cmdline.py"
   there are 4 failures. But I suspect they have nothing to do with this patch.
3) ./sage -coverage devel/sage-test/sage/rings/arith.py produces

It scores a 100% but should we worry about the "ERROR" above?

Anyway, I leave it as positive_review. And I hope someone can educate me on item 2) and 3) above. Thanks.

Perhaps add on what system / platform you tested, and with which version of Sage.

Also, it wouldn't be bad to know *how* the tests actually failed. ;-)

`make testlong` passed all tests on Ubuntu 10.04.3 x86_64 (Core2, gcc 4.5.1) with Sage 4.7.2.alpha2.

Unfortunately, on my local machine I've already applied the patch to the main branch.
The output of 
sage -t --long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/tests/cmdline.py
is attached above

On the other hand, on my dept server the same test passed before applying the patch.
However, when I try to apply the patch, it complains

RuntimeError: Refusing to do operation since you still have unrecorded changes. 
You must check in all changes in your working repository first.

Hum... I don't know how to handle that.
N.B. We have tried using the flask notebook but then decided not using it on the server, so that maybe the cause of the error above.

Sorry for stating and unrelated problem (to this patch) but that's what I encountered during the test.

You can do the following to unapply the patch:

```sh
~/Sage/sage-4.7.2.alpha1/devel/sage$ hg log | head -15
changeset:   15994:b0440a76e01f
tag:         tip

summary:     Added tag 4.7.2.alpha1 for changeset aee2c735d079
```
Take the revision number (currently 5 digits) of the changeset right before you applied the patch, and then do

```sh
~/Sage/sage-4.7.2.alpha1/devel/sage$ hg update -r <number> # 15993 in this case
...
~/Sage/sage-4.7.2.alpha1/devel/sage$ ../../sage -b # rebuild the Sage library
...
```
Then you can rerun tests without the patch.

Try e.g. `hg help update` for further options.

Okay

1) On my department server sage -t --long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/tests/cmdline.py
passes with or without the patch being applied.

2) On my local machine the same test fails in both cases.

So we don't need to worry for this patch (although I appreciate for any suggestion on how to fix that on my own machine).

I give my **positive review** to the patch.
