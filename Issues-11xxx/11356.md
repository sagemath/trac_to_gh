Everything I read about companion matrices and rational canonical form (Frobenius form) uses the "right" version.  It is the natural thing to use when you put your basis vectors into a matrix as columns, as is done with QR, Jordan form, and maybe others.

So I think "right" is the right default (pun intended), but "bottom" (and "top" and "left") are available for folks constructing less natural objects.

Yes, and my point is that since we follow the magma convention of putting basis vectors in rows, do we need to be consistent with their convention of format='bottom'?
And yes, I've also always seen it with format='right' as well.

Perhaps you should add a little suggestion for converting a symbolic polynomial to the kind of list this function needs; something like:

```
sage: x = var('x'); sympoly = x^3 + 2*x + 5
sage: parent(sympoly)
Symbolic Ring
sage: coefflist = [sympoly(x=0)] + [sympoly.coeff(x^k) for k in [1..sympoly.degree(x)]]; coefflist
[5, 2, 0, 1]
sage: companion_matrix(coefflist)
...whatever...
```

(One might be tempted to use `.coeffs(x)`, but that leaves out zero coefficients.)

If you feed `companion_matrix` the empty list, it complains about an `IndexError`. I'd rather see it:

* return the empty matrix, or
* change line 2839 to `if n == 0 or or not poly[n] == 1:` so that the `ValueError` actually gets raised.

Returning the empty matrix seems about right, but I can imagine people having strong opinions about the zero polynomial not being monic. I don't know about the conventions in this corner case, so do whatever seems best.

Thanks, Dan.

Seems like an input list of `[1]` should be a monic polynomial that creates an empty matrix.  Code does that before latest patch and a test of this has been added in the v4 patch.

So I made an input empty list fail in the v4 patch and added a test.  In this case, `n = -1`, so various existing array references will fail, thus requiring its own error message.  I tried to build an "empty polynomial" from an empty list, but just got the zero polynomial.  So I think an empty list is the only danger, thus the error message reads this way.
