Everything I read about companion matrices and rational canonical form (Frobenius form) uses the "right" version.  It is the natural thing to use when you put your basis vectors into a matrix as columns, as is done with QR, Jordan form, and maybe others.

So I think "right" is the right default (pun intended), but "bottom" (and "top" and "left") are available for folks constructing less natural objects.

Yes, and my point is that since we follow the magma convention of putting basis vectors in rows, do we need to be consistent with their convention of format='bottom'?
And yes, I've also always seen it with format='right' as well.

And my point is that "follow the convention" is stronger than the reality.  I like to say Sage has a "preference" for rows.

Besides the overwhelming use of "right" in the literature.  I would rather not look oddball to newcomers, just to be consistent with a language with a miniscule audience.

Must've forgotten an `hg qrefresh`.  Sorry for the hassle.

Replaced the v3 patch with one that should be different than v2.  Thanks for the catch.

Thanks, Dan.

Seems like an input list of `[1]` should be a monic polynomial that creates an empty matrix.  Code does that before latest patch and a test of this has been added in the v4 patch.

So I made an input empty list fail in the v4 patch and added a test.  In this case, `n = -1`, so various existing array references will fail, thus requiring its own error message.  I tried to build an "empty polynomial" from an empty list, but just got the zero polynomial.  So I think an empty list is the only danger, thus the error message reads this way.
