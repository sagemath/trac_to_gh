Everything I read about companion matrices and rational canonical form (Frobenius form) uses the "right" version.  It is the natural thing to use when you put your basis vectors into a matrix as columns, as is done with QR, Jordan form, and maybe others.

So I think "right" is the right default (pun intended), but "bottom" (and "top" and "left") are available for folks constructing less natural objects.

Yes, and my point is that since we follow the magma convention of putting basis vectors in rows, do we need to be consistent with their convention of format='bottom'?
And yes, I've also always seen it with format='right' as well.

And my point is that "follow the convention" is stronger than the reality.  I like to say Sage has a "preference" for rows.  The RDF/CDF decompositions return basis vectors in columns, Jordan form returns basis vectors in columns and I'm sure I can find more.  So, if I can get a basis to convert to rational canonical form, then "right" will be the correct choice.  I think this is a place where consistency for other decompositions is to be preferred. 

Besides the overwhelming use of "right" in the literature.  I would rather not look oddball to newcomers, just to be consistent with a language with a miniscule audience.

Perhaps you should add a little suggestion for converting a symbolic polynomial to the kind of list this function needs; something like:

```
sage: x = var('x'); sympoly = x^3 + 2*x + 5
sage: parent(sympoly)
Symbolic Ring
sage: coefflist = [sympoly(x=0)] + [sympoly.coeff(x^k) for k in [1..sympoly.degree(x)]]; coefflist
[5, 2, 0, 1]
sage: companion_matrix(coefflist)
...whatever...
```

Must've forgotten an `hg qrefresh`.  Sorry for the hassle.

Replaced the v3 patch with one that should be different than v2.  Thanks for the catch.

Returning the empty matrix seems about right, but I can imagine people having strong opinions about the zero polynomial not being monic. I don't know about the conventions in this corner case, so do whatever seems best.

Thanks, Dan.

Seems like an input list of `[1]` should be a monic polynomial that creates an empty matrix.  Code does that before latest patch and a test of this has been added in the v4 patch.

So I made an input empty list fail in the v4 patch and added a test.  In this case, `n = -1`, so various existing array references will fail, thus requiring its own error message.  I tried to build an "empty polynomial" from an empty list, but just got the zero polynomial.  So I think an empty list is the only danger, thus the error message reads this way.
