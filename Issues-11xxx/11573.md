In cryptography, the ElGamal encryption system is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm for public-key cryptography which is based on the Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange. It was described by Taher Elgamal in 1984. ElGamal encryption is used in the free GNU Privacy Guard software, recent versions of PGP, and other cryptosystems.

I've started working on a basic implementation of this based on "Handbook of Applied Cryptography" - Menezes et al.

I'm intending to implement the generic version or ElGamal over a group G, where the default implementation will let G = F_p where p is a prime with approximately 128 bits of security.

So I attached my implementation of the ElGamal algorithm. I would appreciate it if someone would have a look through it. Hopefully there wont be any issues.

Thanks,

Many of the methods lack doctests. Most of the methods that are not doctested are quite trivial, still they should have doctets.
