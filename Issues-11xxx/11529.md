From looking at the code and the `normalize()` doctest, that is right (i.e., they are not ordered/planer trees). I think we need to expand the documentation before this can get into Sage.

+1 from me to removing this terminology (at least for now since Cayley trees aren't implemented).

<a id='comment:25'></a>Hello,

concerning the ranker, I do not care about the possible non-deterministic aspect. There is no clear canonical way to generate and number all rooted trees, so there is no best choice.

concerning the methods of `LabelledRootedTrees`, well, there is no `LabelledRootedTrees_all`. And I do not think one need that for now.

At some point later, it would be good to have classes for labelled rooted trees with labels in a fixed set. So far, all possible labels are allowed. This is needed for operads.

It is true that the content of this ticket is rather minimalistic. But it is enough for #15635, which is my main motivation.

Why not remove the "resu = t" line and just return t? I'm wondering because I'm not sure if my understanding of the clone context manager is correct.

<a id='comment:70'></a>ok, I have got rid of ranker, so that the order is now deterministic.

Maybe it will be slow, but speed can be taken care later on.

I have tried to use cached_method for the sort_key function, but it does not interact well with the ClonableTree setup.

The patchbot should be happy, let us see.

<a id='comment:95'></a>Hello Florent. Glad to see you back.

To finish this ticket, I had to get rid of the dependency to #10194.
If I could suggest something, that would be to take care of #10194. It would certainly
help several people, that have based many of their tickets on that one.
