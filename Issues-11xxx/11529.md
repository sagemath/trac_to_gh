These are (rooted) trees modulo permutation of children, right? I'm asking because I don't see much of a documentation here.

(Let me add that I have never seen them called "Cayley trees" in my life. This notation contradicts http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethe_lattice and http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CayleyTree.html .)

From looking at the code and the `normalize()` doctest, that is right (i.e., they are not ordered/planer trees). I think we need to expand the documentation before this can get into Sage.

+1 from me to removing this terminology (at least for now since Cayley trees aren't implemented).

OK. Are you sure `on_fly` is a good idea? It behaves nondeterministically:

```

Is this what we want? And does it behave well in regard to the other features of our tree classes, such as the `clone` context manager?

If we just want a comparison method for normalization, we can compare two trees "lexicographically" by number of children, number of children of the leftmost child, etc.. If we want an actual ranker, then this is not enough...

Also, the doc of `LabelledRootedTrees` says that this class is a parent stub to be inherited from by classes of labelled rooted trees with specific properties; but the `unlabelled_trees` and `cardinality` methods look like they are specific to the class of *all* labelled rooted trees. Shouldn't they go into `LabelledRootedTrees_all`?

Hello,

concerning the ranker, I do not care about the possible non-deterministic aspect. There is no clear canonical way to generate and number all rooted trees, so there is no best choice.

concerning the methods of `LabelledRootedTrees`, well, there is no `LabelledRootedTrees_all`. And I do not think one need that for now.

At some point later, it would be good to have classes for labelled rooted trees with labels in a fixed set. So far, all possible labels are allowed. This is needed for operads.

It is true that the content of this ticket is rather minimalistic. But it is enough for #15635, which is my main motivation.

Is this:

```
        tst = (children.__class__ is self.__class__
               and children.parent() == parent)
        if not tst:
            children = [self.__class__(parent, x) for x in children]
```
supposed to catch the case of `children` being a rooted tree? Because I'm not sure I understand the logic. `childen` is a list; maybe you want `x.__class__ for x in children` instead of `children.__class__`?

Also, as usual, I don't understand the classcall metaclass magic, so I am just reading past it.

That is making sure that the children are also rooted subtrees of the same parent (you can think of it like a linked list, but instead of a separate class for nodes, it links to a smaller list).

ok, I have got rid of ranker, so that the order is now deterministic.

Maybe it will be slow, but speed can be taken care later on.

I have tried to use cached_method for the sort_key function, but it does not interact well with the ClonableTree setup.

The patchbot should be happy, let us see.

I am not sure I see the point on warning about issues that look not very likely to be met  in the near future. But if you want to add them, I will not resist.

My aim now is to have this ticket in, as soon as possible, so that I can start to work on

Hello Florent. Glad to see you back.

To finish this ticket, I had to get rid of the dependency to #10194.
If I could suggest something, that would be to take care of #10194. It would certainly
help several people, that have based many of their tickets on that one.
