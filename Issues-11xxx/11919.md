There is a problem in symbolic function pickling:

```
sage: x = var('x'); f = function('f',x) ; s = dumps(f) ; loads(s)
RuntimeError: unknown function 'f' in archive
```

The error was not present in Sage 4.7 but it is in newer versions.
It was suggested (http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/b439844f2fa0b675) that it is related to Pynac.
Pynac was updated to 0.2.2 (sage-4.7.1.alpha1) and then to 0.2.3 
(sage-4.7.1.alpha4) according to sage 4.7.1 changelog.

**Keywords:** pynac, pickling

**Reviewer:** Nils Bruin, Burcin Erocal

**Author:** Michael Orlitzky

I hit this independently using deepcopy(). In sage-4.7:

```
sage: f = function('f',x)
sage: deepcopy(f)
f(x)
```

and in 4.8.alpha5:

```
sage: f = function('f',x)

Did you remember to run `sage -b` after applying the patch?

I don't remember which version I created the patch against... Does it at least apply cleanly against 4.8?

It was not an accident. The python_func flag stored in pynac is not a bool any more. It is a bitmask that marks which custom functions are implemented in Python. The rest, if they exist are C++ functions.

> Positive review!


This patch doesn't fix the problem. It might actually lead to crashes, since pynac will look for a python function to call for evaluation, differentiation, etc. if some bits in `python_func` are set.

The correct fix will be to get pynac to create a new dummy symbolic function at the point where it raises an error with "unknown function 'f' in archive." Relevant code can be found in `ginac/function.{h,cpp}` in pynac sources.
