This ticket creates a file

```
sage/graphs/isgci.py
```

That is an interface between Sage and the Graph Classes database ISGCI[1]. With this interface, the XML content of the database can be read using dictionaries and lists (much easier to work with), and some operations are implemented like the comparison (relatively to inclusion) of graph classes.

There will be more work needed on this new feature, for instance the implementation of an easy way to query the database.

The database used by this patch is installed in Sage through the "graphs" spkg, which this ticket updates.

When this patch will be merged into Sage, it is likely that users that do not update their version of Sage will progressively then be working with an outdated version of the database, as the version will be the one used the day they downloaded their copy of Sage. To avoid that, this patch implements a function lets the users update their local copy when necessary.

I tried to make the documentation clear enough about all that is currently possible with ISGCI.

Hi Nathann!

I have just been trough the patch, and am overall happy with it! I noticed a couple typos, which I'll fix in a little patch.

Just one thing. Instead of:

```
    global classes, class_digraph 
    _load_ISGCI_if_not_loaded() 
```
what about using some idiom like:

```
    classes = igsci.classes()
    class_diagraph = igsci.class_digraph()
```

where `classes` would be a cached method (or cached function depending on whether igsci is a module or an object) whose first step would be to load the database; similarly `class_digraph` would be a cached method calling `igsci.classes()`, and then building the digraph, and so on.

Two other little suggestions:
- class_digraph -> inclusion_digraph?
- classs -> cls (it seems to be the standard shorthand to workaround the reserved keyword)

Ahahaah ! Of course, let us do it "the sage-combinat way". It would be nice to have isgci inherit from UniqueRepresentant, and add some decorations inside of it `:-)`

I am waiting for your typo patch and I will change that if you did not do it already `:-)`

I also need to see how cachedmethod is written, just to breathe easier `:-)`

Please go ahead if you feel like it; I won't have my reviewer's patch before tonight.

It's super optimized and in Cython since #11115, thanks to Simon.

I hope this won't conflict too much, since I did quite a few documentation changes after all. Feel free to take or drop all my suggestions in the attached reviewer's patch. I left also a couple TODO's; again mostly suggestions.

Cheers,
                        Nicolas

Helloooooo Nicolas !

Well, I updated the GraphClasses class so that it now has classes() and inclusion_digraph() methods, and finally noticed that all the other functions (_load_ISGCI_[...]) or update_ISGCI) and all that stuff would be much better as methods of GraphClasses as it is now unique.

Hence I will upload many patches to this ticket : 
* the first one will contain the modifications I mentionned
* The second will *ONLY* move the methods in the file
* The third one will modify them so that they will work (because they will demand a ``self`` argument for instances, and other things).

I hope the review will not be too hard `:-)`

This TODO appears in the part of the code that loads "the most recent" version of the database. Why would you want to only load the user's version instead of the most recent one ? I thought that this way all users may benefit from a global update...

About returning to the user the exception raised by a wrong access to a file I did not know what to do exactly.

Hi Nathann,

I just went back through the patches (I folded them on the Sage-Combinat queue: trac_11880-isgci-all_in_one-nc.patch). I added a reviewer patch adding a bit of doc, and using the shorter syntax for links, and using further cached methods.

It's basically good enough to go, up to little details:

- doc coverage:
  {{{
  zephyr-~s>sage -coverage graphs/isgci.py 
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  graphs/isgci.py
  SCORE graphs/isgci.py: 64% (11 of 17)

  Missing documentation:
  	 * __init__(self, name, gc_id):
 	 * __le__(self, other):
	 * __ge__(self, other):
	 * __eq__(self, other):
	 * __lt__(self, other):

  Missing doctests:
	 * __hash__(self):
  }}}

- I am not sure about the name of the method ``show`` since for other Sage objects, this opens a plot.

- I have not retested _download_db and friends

Then I made the mistake twice, as the MixedIntegerLinearProgram object also have a .show() method that does not plot anything. Though you are right, perhaps the name "show" is not descriptive enough... What would you think of graph_classes.Chordal.description() to obtain the same information ? `:-)`

I have not modified them. Actually, since I reinstalled Sage since the last time I worked on this patch I obtained an error the first time I ran isgci, and I fixed it by running graph_classes.update_db() `:-)`

Yeah, ok, you can remove that TODO.

> About returning to the user the exception raised by a wrong access to a file I did not know what to do exactly. There is nothing wrong going on if the user cannot write to the system-wide database, so this exception is still caught.


Maybe the error message could be included when printing:

```
            print "Could not save save database in "+SAGE_ROOT+'/data/graphs/'
```

If this is "permission denied", the user won't be surprised. If it's something else, it can be useful for the user (e.g. the sysadmin) to know about it.

Helloooooooo !!! 

What about this updated patch ? "show" becomes "description", and there is an error message printed when something fails while the files are being created. I added "aerhyaerharyhare" to SAGE_ROOT on my computer and it produced :

```
sage: graph_classes.update_db()                    
Database downloaded
XML file converted into Python dictionaries
Could not save save database in /home/ncohen/.Sage/data/graphs/ (No such file or directory)
Now attempting to save the files to /home/ncohen/.sage/db
Database saved to .sobj files in /home/ncohen/.sage/db
sage: 
```
> But I did ...

Oh, you did not test *your* modifications ! Then I did it -- they were safe anyway -- and I learned that this `@`cache_method decoration added a ``clear_cache`` function `:-p`

... sometimes I really miss `C` `:-P`

Cool!

Looking at
http://docs.python.org/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.EnvironmentError,
you probably want to use:

```
           print "Could not save database in "+SAGE_ROOT+"/data/graphs/ ("+v.strerror+")" 
```

instead of:

```
           try: 
               code, msg = v 
               print "Could not save save database in "+SAGE_ROOT+"/data/graphs/ ("+str(msg)+")" 
           except: 
               print "Could not save save database in "+SAGE_ROOT+"/data/graphs/" 
```

(mind also the `save save`)

That done, you can fold all the patches together, and set a positive
review on my behalf.

Helloooooooo Jeroen !!!

First, I'm sorry about this file, I really had no idea it was actually created by a spkg `^^;`

Here is what we deal with : there is on http://www.graphclasses.org/ a database of graph classes that is maintained by H.N. de Ridder and that this patches makes available in Sage. This database is relatively large and I thought that it would be a mess to update it with Sage patches very often, so this patch actually creates a "update_db" function that downloads the database on the author's website (they know us, they know what we do, they put their database there in XML format just for this purpose), parses it, and updates the local copy. It is also a way to ensure that the parsing code is also part of Sage `^^;`

How do you think we should do that ? "The spkg way of doing things" would mean that the user has no way to update his own local database if necessary and I would be glad to keep that inside of Sage. This being said, we can totally change the directory into which these informations are stored. We can also store them inside of a .py file if you prefer, which we could overwrite when necessary...

Got it ! It will be done. Where do you think we should keep this file ? Really in the library, i.e. in the devel/graph/ folder ? Or should we keep it elsewhere ?

If so, perhaps we should forget about overwriting the file when the database is updated, and only (as we do now) create a local copy for the user, stored in his SAGE_DOT folder.

I think the file should really become part of the Sage library, so yes in `sage/graphs`.

I also think that the updating should never be automatic, there should always be a ticket for "updating the Graphs Classes database" if you want to update the official version in Sage.  Of course, a user might update *his own copy* at will.

Thanks Jeroen for your feedback,

And sorry for my slow answer.

Having the database file in the Sage sources is all fine for me: then
everything is in the same repository :-) Even if it brings a bit of
overhead, I also see the relevance of having a ticket for each upgrade
of the database in the vanilla Sage sources: after all, changing that
database is susceptible to change the behavior of Sage, and we want to
keep track of that.

On the other hand I am not sure about the format. To make an overview,
I see three possible options:

(1) The original XML file taken directly from graphclasses.org

(2) A pickle of the Sage object built automatically from (1)
    (as in the current implementation)

(3) A python file constructing programmatically that Sage object,
    built automatically from (1)
    (requires new code, unless Python has some alternative pickling
    module that produce Python code)

Some pros and cons for those formats are:

(a) When loading (2) or (3) into Sage, arbitrary code can be
executed. Thus, a malicious file could cause a security risk.
    On the other hand, loading the XML file is reasonably safe
    (assuming the parser does no stupid things like 'eval').

(b) (2) is not human readable, and therefore can't really be refereed
    directly.

(c) (1) and (3) are *big*; even if technically they are human
    readable, in practice it is not possible to referee them directly.

(d) A basic assumption is that we can trust graphclasses.org for
correctness. Therefore, for refereeing (1), it is sufficient to
    check the XML file for consistency with that on graphclasses.org
(e.g. by a md5 sum).

(e) (2) and (3) would be built automatically automatically from (1),
    using code from Sage. If we trust (1) as well as code in Sage,
    then I see no reason not to trust (2) and (3).

(f) Loading (1) into Sage requires non trivial parsing of the XML
file. This could be unacceptably slow redoing it each time Sage is
    started and the database accessed.

(g) It might be questionable to include pure data files within the
    Sage sources. Or maybe not. In any cases, (3) is not really
    different from a data file.

In view of this, I really see no advantage for enforcing the database
to be encoded as python code, and it has the disadvantage of requiring
more code to translate the XML file to Python code. There thus remains
to choose between XML or a pickle.

Nathann: how much time does it take to load the XML file into Sage?

In case (f) would apply and one would insist on distributing only the
XML file (human readable + easy to check), what about having a cache?
Namely, the first time the user loads in the XML file, it could
pickled and stored in the user directory for later reuse.

Cheers,
                            Nicolas

Hi Nathann!

Thanks for the updated patch!

Replying to [ncohen](#comment%3A34):
> This new patch lets us store the database as a XML file (it takes something like a second or so to parse it on my computer, which is not thaaaaat unbearable)


I went through the new patch, and it looks good. Just too minor things:

Please update the doctest for _parse_db:

```
        EXAMPLE::

            sage: graph_classes._parse_db() # Not tested -- requires internet
```
since this method now takes an argument. Passing the name of the XML
file included in the spkg should do the job. Besides, this does not
require internet.

Also rewrite:

```
        - ``xml_file`` (filename) -- the XML file containing the data from ISGCI
```
as

```
        - ``xml_file`` -- the name of an XML file containing the data from ISGCI
```

For the record: all tests passed on 5.0.beta10 with the spkg installed.

Cheers,
                       Nicolas

Well, for some reason the tests did not pass on my machine, and it was to be expected... Some things are being displayed as they are listed by a dictionary .items() method, and of course today the ordering was different. As these are not critical functions anyway I wrapped them with a call to "sorted", and updated the docstrings. I also set some of them to "not tested" for the same reason, as well as for a "shortest path" in the inclusion digraph which had no reason to be unique (and changed since the last time on my machine).

Great.

Please use "#random# rather than "# not tested", and maybe add a test
like:

    sage: map(graph_classes.get_class, p)
    [perfect graphs, ... bipartite graphs]

Then you can set a positive review on my behalf.
