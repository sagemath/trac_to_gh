Hi David,

This will be a nice contribution!  

One suggestion after a quick look.  *Really* long output in code blocks can be broken at any white-space character without breaking doctests (and you can add whitespace to existing whitespace).

So sometimes you can break, and line-up output to be a bit more readable, rather than spilling over the margin in PDF versions, or having to use a very long horizontal scrollbar in HTML versions.  Experiment with one instance before doing a lot of tedious editing, to see what works and how.

Nothing to apologize for.

Although they'll meanwhile be added in case they're missing *when a ticket gets merged into a release*, commit messages should IMHO still contain the trac ticket number, i.e. *start* with e.g. either "`#11682 ...`" or "`Trac 11682: ...`", or at least reference the ticket on the first line ("*brief one-line description* `(#11682)`").




I think the indices to collections of rather unrelated documents (like *Thematic Tutorials*) are kept in alphabetical order, so `sandpile` should unfortunately be the *last*. ;-)

I realize the topics should be in alphatical order.  The issue here is that the file is called "sandpile.rst" and the title of the resulting html page is "Abelian sandpile model".  So if you do a html docbuild, the topics actually will be in alphabetical order.

Not an issue if you update your patch anyway. (You can check *Replace existing file of the same name* or whatever it is called when you re-attach a new version of the patch.)

You can also just edit the patch you exported with Mercurial (since it is a plain text file) with any editor and re-upload it (with the same filename, see above).

Nobody will mind if you decide to attach a new version of your patch *with a different filename*, e.g. `trac_11682_sandpile_doc.v2.patch`, but the previous, obsolete one doesn't contain the ticket number in its commit message.

If there are different [versions of] patches or other files (to *not* be applied) attached to the ticket, the ticket's description should state which files have to actually be applied, and if necessary, in which order. (You could also attach a second patch *to be applied on top of your previous one*, in which case you should change the commit message of the first as mentioned above.)

The third version of the patch, trac_11682_sandpile_doc.v3.patch does the following:

1. Adds the file sandpile.rst, 
2. Changes index.rst to include a reference to sandpile.rst. (Note that in index.rst, 'sandpile' does not appear in alphabetical order, but in the actual index.html that is produced, the corresponding title is 'Abelian sandpile model', which is in alphabetical order.)
3. Adds a subdirectory, media/sandpile, containing png image files for sandpile.rst. 

To test the patch, I created a fresh clone of sage-main, applied the patch

    trac_11682_sandpile_doc.v3.patch

and ran 'sage -docbuild thematic_tutorials html' and 'sage -docbuild thematic_tutorials pdf'.  The resulting html and pdf files and the index for the thematic tutorials were all as expected.  I reran 

    sage -t -verbose -long --optional <PATH_TO_SAGE_BRANCH>/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/sandpile.rst 

and again the tests all passed.

[The problem with v2 of the patch was that mercurial was not allowing me to add png files.  (I needed to add appropriate lines to my .hgrc).]

Hmm...  I am not having that problem (Ubuntu 10.10, Sage Version 4.7, Release Date: 2011-05-23).

About spanning trees: are you thinking of adding them, using a bijection between them and elements of the sandpile group?

actually, I need it for directed graphs, in view of https://oeis.org/draft/A027362;
 the only reference in literature on sandpiles for directed graphs I know is in a recent paper by Lionel Levine --- and no explicit bijection is given there. It seems one has to roll his own here, no?

Hi David,

This is very nice and all seems to be working pretty well as far as patches and images and all that.

I have one doctest failure (same command twice, then a follow-on command fails).  I'm using 4.7.1.alpha4.  It could be I am behind?  Has this changed?  Which version are you testing on?

```
File "/sage/sage-4.7.1.alpha4/devel/sage-main/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/sandpile.rst", line 4189:
    sage: eff = D.effective_div()
Exception raised:

        return self.__dict__[name]
    KeyError: '_linear_system'
```

Same thing at line 4360.


Some comments on formatting, etc, in no particular order.

1.  Other tutorials have a main title (in the index of tutorials) that is capitalized, so maybe yours should be also.

2.  Maybe "is in the works" could read as "will appear as"?

3.  Installing 4ti2.  Does it really need the patch level and all?  I thought it was smarter and `sage -i 4ti2` would grab the newest spkg?

4.  URL references to other parts of the documentation should perhaps be relative links, not full-blown `http://` style.  Sage should not presume an internet connection, and indeed, many may view the documentation locally, especially if coming to it from within the notebook.  So

```
http://sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/graphs/graph_generators.html 
```

could become

```
../reference/sage/graphs/graph_generators.html
```

There are also ways to link to documentation for classes, modules, functions, etc with syntax such as

```
:mod:`sage.graphs.graph_generators`
```

which might even work better (ask if you need help with this).

5.  SandpileConfig, !^ operator: needs a double-colon for the examples, they are not being rendered verbatim.

6.  Do you want triple-dashes to make full-width horizontal rules in your lists of methods?  I'm just getting a short stubby thing, maybe you need more dashes?

7.  Are Sage code examples in the "python blocks" being tested?  (Break one and see.)  I don't know - I've never used this construct in writing documentation.  Doesn't matter either way, I think.

Rob: thanks for the comments!  

I have addressed them all (see specifics below).  I doctested the current
version (v4) with the --optional and -long and all tests passed.

NOTE: First apply trac_11682_sandpile_doc.v3.patch, then
trac_11682_sandpile_doc.v4.patch on top of that.  Also, v4 and v4.2 are identical.  I just tried to remove a comma from the description and ended up with two copies.

Thanks,

The problem here is that you do not have 4ti2 installed and I forgot to put to
include '# optional 4ti2' next to these examples.  I have added '# optional
4ti2' in these two places in v4.

(I am testing on version 4.7.1 now.)

Fixed.

Fixed (I removed the reference entirely for the time being).

I just tested this again.  The command 'sage -i 4ti2' attempts to install the
wrong version of 4ti2 and crashes, whereas 'sage -i 4ti2.p0' works fine.  I sent
a note to sage-devel about this.

I am getting em-dashes from '---' in the rst file.  I don't understand why you
are not getting longer dashes.

I ascertained that the python blocks were *not* being tested.  So I checked
each manually, found several problems (due to out-of-date syntax), and fixed
them.  I do not want to have the blocks labeled as 'EXAMPLES'.  I putua warning
at the top of sandpile.rst that these blocks need to be tested by hand.

> I ascertained that the python blocks were *not* being tested. So I checked each manually, found several problems (due to out-of-date syntax), and fixed them. I do not want to have the blocks labeled as 'EXAMPLES'. I putua warning at the top of sandpile.rst that these blocks need to be tested by hand.


This code **must** be tested automatically.

To do this, you don't have to label them as `EXAMPLES`, you just need to delimit them with a double colon, say like this:

```
(The triple dots are to denote continuation lines.)  I would also suggest that you put `.. linkall` near the top of the file to tell Sage to link all of the examples when doctesting, since you define `S` in one block and then use it in the next one.

When I made changes like the above, I got a bunch of doctest failures, e.g.

Thanks for the useful comments!

I have moved all of the sage examples that were in python code-blocks so that
they are doctest-able.  Running the doctests made me aware of several
significant problems, which I fixed.  When I now run sage -t --verbose -long
--optional on sandpile.rst, all tests pass.

The current patch, trac_11682_sandpile_doc.v5.patch, replaces all the others,
i.e, it should not be applied on top of any of the previous patches.

David,

I think this is looking real good.  It'll be a very nice contribution.

And despite my earlier (unconsidered) ambivalence, the Python blocks really should be doctested, or they will eventually become useless (and an embarassment).  So I'm glad John P brought it up and that you have those reworked.

Just one technical problem.  The six image files are not available. I don't see a "sandpile" subdirectory in `doc/en/thematic_tutorials/media/` after applying the patch, and from the sizes of your patches, it looks like a healthy number of bytes are AWOL.

How about manufacturing a patch with **just** the images?  That'll be really easy to check as a patch on top of the "v5" patch.  I'll presume you've done this once and can do it again, but feel free to ask for guidance.  With this done, this should move to positive review.

Thanks for this substantial contribution.

Rob

> For the record, there's [a (not that) new 4ti2 spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/release/sage-4.7.2.alpha3-prerelease/4ti2-1.3.2.p1.spkg) which will be "included" in Sage 4.7.2.alpha3. (It's still an *optional* package; cf. #8217.)


FWIW, passes all (long, optional) doctests in `sage/sandpiles/` and `doc/en/thematic_tutorials/sandpile.rst` with the newer 4ti2 spkg and the Sage 4.7.2.alpha3 prerelease as well.
