These two classes share a lot of code. Have you though about a way to avoid this duplication?

- If input parameters are of the wrong type, it's usual to raise a `TypeError`. It's good to raise errors that obey conventions, because that helps writing appropriate `try ... except` clauses when needed.
- assert statements can be optimized away if `python -O` is selected, so they are only suitable to assert conditions that are supposed to hold anyway (and raise an early error if they don't, to help debugging)

You can't delete a patch: only accounts with admin privileges can do that.

However, you can direct the patchbot to which patches to apply.

Hey Christian,

We made some changes. We deleted combinatorial_statistics since we will do that in another patch. For now, let's concentrate on combinatorial_maps.

Some changes:

- we changed the __repr__ method
- we added decorators to combinatorial maps (permutations, partitions, etc.)
- we updated doctests to use the implemented combinatorial maps

But we have some questions:

- I've littered the file combinatorial_maps.py with TODOs. Take a look at them. Most are documentation issues, or things I don't understand.
- another question: why doesn't the following work?

```
        sage: from sage.misc.combinatorial_map import combinatorial_maps_in_class
        sage: p = Permutation([1,3,2,4])
        sage: cmaps = combinatorial_maps_in_class(p)
        sage: cmaps[0](p)
```
- should this file be in `sage.combinat.misc` or `sage.combinat.combinatorial_maps` instead of `sage.misc`?

Should I delete all patches on the ticket, and you again add those we want to keep?

> Hey Christian, We made some changes. We deleted combinatorial_statistics since we will do that in another patch. For now, let's concentrate on combinatorial_maps.


Alright.

Some changes: - we changed the __ repr__  method - we added decorators to combinatorial maps (permutations, partitions, etc.) - we updated doctests to use the implemented combinatorial maps

good - but I guess we are creating tons of conflicts in the queue if trac_11641_concrete_combinatorial_maps_cb.patch gets merged into main sage (though I guess we should do it anyway).

> But we have some questions: - I've littered the file combinatorial_maps.py with TODOs. Take a look at them.

We want to call this function as in

```
sage: p.inverse()
```
so

```
sage: cmaps[0]()
```
returns p.whatevercmapsof0is(). Does that make sense to you?

- should this file be in `sage.combinat.misc`  or `sage.combinat.combinatorial_maps`  instead of `sage.misc` ?

Adding it to `sage.combinat.misc` or `sage.combinat.combinatorial_maps` sounds good to me; I basically copied the behaviour of some other decorator that happend to be in `sage.misc`.

That line that begins with "Apply:" is for the patchbot.

It has to happen eventually. We'll rebase the queue, if necessary.

Using this reasoning, shouldn't the following work then? I am using Permutation_class instead of an instance of a permutation to grab the combinatorial maps:

```
sage: p = Permutation([1,3,2,4])
sage: Permutation_class = type(p)
sage: cmaps = combinatorial_maps_in_class(Permutation_class)
sage: cmaps[0](p)
```
Note that this also returns an error:

```
sage: cmaps[0]()
```

Okay, we should move it.

Did you get a chance to take a look at the TODOs in the file? There are some places that need doctests and others that need documentation, and I don't know how to do it.

<a id='comment:19'></a>Hi,

I looked at the patches and have the following preliminary comments (I haven't uploaded any changes, since it doesn't seem to be right currently):

- I deleted the files we don't need (I do have permission as well).

- trac_11641_concrete_combinatorial_maps_cb.patch is full of things we should not take care of (all the removed whitespaces) - in particular this doesn't let me apply the patch on 5.2 (and we are on holidays so I cannot download and compile 5.3.beta2).

- Examples in Franco's review do depend on trac_11641_concrete_combinatorial_maps_cb.patch, so I think the concrete maps should come right after the decorator.

- I deleted the combinatorial_statistics from my patch (and its deletion from Franco's), and then moved the decorator to sage.combinat.combinatorial_map.

- All the concrete maps I implemented in the past months are missing in the patch (e.g. the one sending area-bounce to dinv-area,and also all other maps for Dyck words).

- I looked at the TODO's in Franco's review. As I said, I simply copied another decorator, so I can't really answer all the questions (e.g. I don't know what this "f=None" is used for).

agreed, but we have to keep in mind to prepare another trac ticket for the remaining stuff (where we shouldn't forget any of the implemented methods!).

I went through all of them and added a review-review, please have a look!
