5) In the first doc string "defined a map between two combinatorial objects." defined should be defines.

These two classes share a lot of code. Have you though about a way to avoid this duplication?

- If input parameters are of the wrong type, it's usual to raise a `TypeError`. It's good to raise errors that obey conventions, because that helps writing appropriate `try ... except` clauses when needed.
- assert statements can be optimized away if `python -O` is selected, so they are only suitable to assert conditions that are supposed to hold anyway (and raise an early error if they don't, to help debugging)

You can't delete a patch: only accounts with admin privileges can do that.

However, you can direct the patchbot to which patches to apply.

Hey Christian,

We made some changes. We deleted combinatorial_statistics since we will do that in another patch. For now, let's concentrate on combinatorial_maps.

Some changes:

- we changed the `__repr__` method
- we added decorators to combinatorial maps (permutations, partitions, etc.)
- we updated doctests to use the implemented combinatorial maps

But we have some questions:

- I've littered the file combinatorial_maps.py with TODOs. Take a look at them. Most are documentation issues, or things I don't understand.
- another question: why doesn't the following work?

```
        sage: from sage.misc.combinatorial_map import combinatorial_maps_in_class
        sage: p = Permutation([1,3,2,4])
        sage: cmaps = combinatorial_maps_in_class(p)
        sage: cmaps[0](p)
```
- should this file be in `sage.combinat.misc` or `sage.combinat.combinatorial_maps` instead of `sage.misc`?

Alright.

Some changes: - we changed the __ repr__  method - we added decorators to combinatorial maps (permutations, partitions, etc.) - we updated doctests to use the implemented combinatorial maps

good - but I guess we are creating tons of conflicts in the queue if trac_11641_concrete_combinatorial_maps_cb.patch gets merged into main sage (though I guess we should do it anyway).

We want to call this function as in

```
sage: p.inverse()
```
so

```
sage: cmaps[0]()
```
returns p.whatevercmapsof0is(). Does that make sense to you?

- should this file be in `sage.combinat.misc`  or `sage.combinat.combinatorial_maps`  instead of `sage.misc` ?

Adding it to `sage.combinat.misc` or `sage.combinat.combinatorial_maps` sounds good to me; I basically copied the behaviour of some other decorator that happend to be in `sage.misc`.

That line that begins with "Apply:" is for the patchbot.

It has to happen eventually. We'll rebase the queue, if necessary.

Using this reasoning, shouldn't the following work then? I am using Permutation_class instead of an instance of a permutation to grab the combinatorial maps:

```
sage: p = Permutation([1,3,2,4])
sage: Permutation_class = type(p)
sage: cmaps = combinatorial_maps_in_class(Permutation_class)
sage: cmaps[0](p)
```
Note that this also returns an error:

```
sage: cmaps[0]()
```

Okay, we should move it.

Did you get a chance to take a look at the TODOs in the file? There are some places that need doctests and others that need documentation, and I don't know how to do it.

Hi,

I looked at the patches and have the following preliminary comments (I haven't uploaded any changes, since it doesn't seem to be right currently):

- I deleted the files we don't need (I do have permission as well).

- trac_11641_concrete_combinatorial_maps_cb.patch is full of things we should not take care of (all the removed whitespaces) - in particular this doesn't let me apply the patch on 5.2 (and we are on holidays so I cannot download and compile 5.3.beta2).

- Examples in Franco's review do depend on trac_11641_concrete_combinatorial_maps_cb.patch, so I think the concrete maps should come right after the decorator.

- I deleted the combinatorial_statistics from my patch (and its deletion from Franco's), and then moved the decorator to sage.combinat.combinatorial_map.

- All the concrete maps I implemented in the past months are missing in the patch (e.g. the one sending area-bounce to dinv-area,and also all other maps for Dyck words).

- I looked at the TODO's in Franco's review. As I said, I simply copied another decorator, so I can't really answer all the questions (e.g. I don't know what this "f=None" is used for). If you haven't done it earlier, I will look more closely at it after next week when we are back from holidays - or if we have a rainy day in between, like today :-) .

Perfect.

I didn't include all of our work from combinat because a lot of it was missing proper documentation. Our thought was, lets get this working with what's already in sage, and then adding all the maps you've created are very simple patches. I did include a few combinatorial maps, as long as the documentation was there and it was self contained, though it's possible I missed one or two.

> - I looked at the TODO's in Franco's review. As I said, I simply copied another decorator, so I can't really answer all the questions (e.g. I don't know what this "f=None" is used for). If you haven't done it earlier, I will look more closely at it after next week when we are back from holidays - or if we have a rainy day in between, like today :-) .

Enjoy the holidays. Tell Anke and Jara I say hello.

I shrinked the patch to the stuff we want - I hope I didn't mess anything, please recheck and modify if you find anything.

done.

agreed, but we have to keep in mind to prepare another trac ticket for the remaining stuff (where we shouldn't forget any of the implemented methods!).

I went through all of them and added a review-review, please have a look!

I now wonder what the patchpot says...

Everything seems to be fine now -- would be great if one of you (Chris / Franco) could have another look and see if we should take care of anything else, or give a positive review.

I am now building 5.3.rc0. Should I then get the patches in the combinat queue or did you already do that?

Hi,

before this gets again forgotten - what is left here? I remember that I added another review patch and wanted to get your new remarks or final positive review.

I added Mike since he wants to get everything in the patch "concrete_combinatorial_maps" within dyck_words merged with stuff of him to get a medium size patch on Dyck paths done soon.

Best, Christian

This isn't really necessary, but can as well be done in some other patch. I would actually prefer this patch to make it into Sage, so we can use the decorator in other patches; but if you want to spend the time to add the decorators to some more maps, please go ahead...

Thanks, Christian
