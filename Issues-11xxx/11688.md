Currently some properties of graded modules are implemented in graded algebras. It is necessary to put them in their proper place.

One precise reason is that one can then use these properties for operads. One would like to have something like that:

```
sage: PL=PreLieOperad(QQ)
sage: a=PL.one()
sage: a.is_homogeneous()
True
sage: a.homogeneous_component(2)
0
```

For this, one needs the "homogeneous_component" method for elements and not for modules. Maybe "restrict_degree" would be more adequate, like for power series.

This ticket also provide a simple example of graded module (over partitions).
