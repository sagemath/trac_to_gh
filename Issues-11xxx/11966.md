(The home base for this ticket is the Lion ticket #11881.)

See the discussion at #11884.  To fix this we may need to slightly modify the Maxima spkg, at least for now.

**New spkg:** [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/maxima-5.23.2.p2.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/maxima-5.23.2.p2.spkg)

**md5sum:** `f87e697e9497ccf69a91ae77c9b5a591`

### maxima-5.23.2.p2 (Leif Leonhardy, November 3rd 2011)
* Trac #11966: Modification so that Sage will build on Lion.
  Actually the new patch isn't specific to MacOS X 10.7 / Lion,
  but necessary when building with the new ECL version from git
  (ecl-11.1.2.git.20111030.spkg, see #11884).
* Reviewer changes: Clean up `spkg-install`.

### maxima-5.23.2.p1 (William Stein, 31 October 2011)
* Trac #11966: Modification so that Sage will build on Lion.

I realize that Sage doesn't start yet (#11967).  But can you try

```
./sage -maxima
```
and see if the Maxima standalone binary works fine?  If not, we have problems, but presumably it will.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Segmentation fault

The following tests failed:

```

I think that's most probably "just" due to ECL (or Boehm GC?), i.e. #11884, so I could otherwise give this ticket a positive review... ;-)

Anyway, someone would have to look at my reviewer changes.

Btw., there's an `spkg-dist` script apparently nobody used recently (I added a comment on that to `SPKG.txt`), which deletes the following (and creates dummy `Makefile.in`s):

Oooops, one should perhaps run `./sage -b` after installing a new ECL spkg... B)

```sh
$ ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima*
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima.py"        
	 [25.7 s]
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima_abstract.py"
	 [38.4 s]
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py"    
	 [5.2 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
```

By the way, the new ECL + patched Maxima spkgs work with both the boehm_gc-7.2.alpha6.p0 (from #11883) and the boehm_gc-7.1.p7 spkg.




> Anyway, someone would have to look at my reviewer changes.

That still applies.




> Btw., there's an `spkg-dist` script apparently nobody used recently (I added a comment on that to `SPKG.txt`), which deletes the following (and creates dummy `Makefile.in`s):


```sh
$ du -sch /home/leif/Sage/spkgs/maxima-5.23.2.p2/src/doc/info/{es,pt}*

If nobody objects, I can make a stripped spkg with these files removed (and `SPKG.txt` updated accordingly).

The relevant languages are Portuguese (Portugal and Brazil) and Spanish:

`ptestlong` also passed on Solaris SPARC, with Sage 4.7.2.alpha3.
