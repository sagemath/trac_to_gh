(The home base for this ticket is the Lion ticket #11881.)

See the discussion at #11884.  To fix this we may need to slightly modify the Maxima spkg, at least for now.

**New spkg:** [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/maxima-5.23.2.p2.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/maxima-5.23.2.p2.spkg)

**md5sum:** `f87e697e9497ccf69a91ae77c9b5a591`

### maxima-5.23.2.p2 (Leif Leonhardy, November 3rd 2011)
* Trac #11966: Modification so that Sage will build on Lion.
  Actually the new patch isn't specific to MacOS X 10.7 / Lion,
  but necessary when building with the new ECL version from git
  (ecl-11.1.2.git.20111030.spkg, see #11884).
* Reviewer changes: Clean up `spkg-install`.

### maxima-5.23.2.p1 (William Stein, 31 October 2011)
* Trac #11966: Modification so that Sage will build on Lion.

Good question, which I wondered about.    It seems to work on other platforms, and logically it makes sense to me that it should be the right thing to do.    However, I'm not very knowledgable about the subtleties of lisp compilation.

Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.

I think that's most probably "just" due to ECL (or Boehm GC?), i.e. #11884, so I could otherwise give this ticket a positive review... ;-)

Anyway, someone would have to look at my reviewer changes.

Btw., there's an `spkg-dist` script apparently nobody used recently (I added a comment on that to `SPKG.txt`), which deletes the following (and creates dummy `Makefile.in`s):

Oooops, one should perhaps run `./sage -b` after installing a new ECL spkg... B)

```sh
$ ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima*
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima.py"        
	 [25.7 s]
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima_abstract.py"
	 [38.4 s]
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py"    
	 [5.2 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
```

By the way, the new ECL + patched Maxima spkgs work with both the boehm_gc-7.2.alpha6.p0 (from #11883) and the boehm_gc-7.1.p7 spkg.




> Anyway, someone would have to look at my reviewer changes.


That still applies.

If nobody objects, I can make a stripped spkg with these files removed (and `SPKG.txt` updated accordingly).

The relevant languages are Portuguese (Portugal and Brazil) and Spanish:

```python

def cmd(x):
    print x
    if os.system(x):
        print "(Failed.)"

for X in ['es', 'es.utf8', 'pt', 'pt.utf8', 'pt_BR', 'pt_BR.utf8']:
    cmd('rm -rf "src/doc/info/%s/"*'%X)
    open('src/doc/info/%s/Makefile.in'%X,'w').write('all:\n\tls\n\n')

Weird.  After building Sage 4.7.2 (final) from scratch with the two spkgs, all tests (`ptestlong`) passed.

`ptestlong` also passed on Solaris SPARC, with Sage 4.7.2.alpha3.
