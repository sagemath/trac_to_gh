In Sage 4.7, when calling the function

pari('qfminim(%s,2,0)'%(A._pari_()))

with certain matrix, I get the following:

```

I am using Sage Version 4.7, Release Date: 2011-05-23.

I tried the worksheet you attached and it doesn't work for me. I also tried the sage -gp (I didn't know about it before) and it also fails, so I change my opinion on it being a problem with interfaces...

When asked about pari version (in sage -gp) I get 2.4.3... I am running Linux kernel 2.6.39, and compiled Sage from source on a 32bit machine, if that is of any use.

Is there any other info that might be relevant?

Thank you,

marc.

Maybe the Linux distribution you are using, the processor type (`cat /proc/cpuinfo`) / architecture (`uname -a`) and last but not least the version of GCC (`gcc -v`).

If you haven't yet run Sage's test suite, you could at least run a subset of it:

```sh
/home/float/sage$ ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/libs/pari/
...
/home/float/sage$ ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/interfaces/gp.py
...
```
(Both together should *at most* take a few minutes on a slow machine; the second one doesn't make much sense if the error also occurs in plain PARI/GP as you said.)

Probably more important, as this seems to be an upstream bug, you can run *PARI's* test suite, which unfortunately requires rebuilding PARI, and hence will take much more time (up to 30 minutes I think, depending on your machine):

```sh
/home/float/sage$ env SAGE_CHECK=yes ./sage -f -s pari-2.4.3.alpha.p5 2>&1 | tee pari-test.log
```
(This reinstalls the package unless PARI's test suite fails, and logs the output to `pari-test.log`. If you end up with a broken Sage installation because the test suite didn't pass, you can reinstall it by almost the same command, simply omitting the `env SAGE_CHECK=yes` and optionally `-s`, i.e. `./sage -f pari-2.4.3.alpha.p5`.)

I have run all tests you suggested and everything seems ok. I have also tried to run the code in another machine that has Sage installed (that is an Intel Xeon with 8 cores, so quite different to my '06 laptop). That one is running Sage 4.6.2 (2011-02-25). And got the same error.

Here is the data about my laptop (in which it is easiest for me to experiment):

Don't think so. The other machine is my math department. What I know about it is that everything is compiled from scratch (so no distro), gcc is 4.2.4. My guess is that Sage has been built with the default options, but I can't confirm at this moment.

Yes, I did.

Also, I have tried on a third machine with same results. Do you have access to other Sage installs on different types of machines? It might be that it only affects precompiled versions and 32 bit ones?

I am running out of ideas, but since two Sage installs in different math departments (and in different continents, for that matter) give the same error, it shouldn't be hard to find other installations with the same problem...

How does the error look like there? (Sage may somewhat obscure PARI's error message when you use PARI from the Sage prompt, `sage:`.)




> Also, I have tried on a third machine with same results. Do you have access to other Sage installs on different types of machines? It might be that it only affects precompiled versions and 32 bit ones?


Did you also build your *working* PARI/GP versions from scratch / source?




> I am running out of ideas, but since two Sage installs in different math departments (and in different continents, for that matter) give the same error, it shouldn't be hard to find other installations with the same problem...


I'll try to find some where I can reproduce this...

Did you make any changes in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/` (i.e. create symbolic links to system libraries as replacements for Sage's versions, e.g. `libreadline*`)?

`readline` is currently my top candidate, as we already had quite a lot of trouble with it and in fact do use the system's version (without user intervention) instead of building Sage's one on some platforms (including ArchLinux and openSUSE), also depending on the version found.

You could
* take a look at your `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/logs/readline*` to see if just a symbolic link was created (or the system version got *copied*) by Sage,
* look for symbolic links in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/` that point **outside** the Sage tree, i.e. start with `/lib/...`, `/usr/lib/...` or alike.

Yes. For the stable version I used the PKGBUILDs from the ArchUserRepo, which grabs the code and build it. For the devel version, I downloaded myself the source from the PARI website and compiled it.

When I compiled it in my machine I there was an issue with libppl. I followed some advice from the web and linked it to my system version.

OK, apart from libppl (which points to the system version), the readline lib seems to be also copied from my system. This library has been updated afterwards (ArchLinus is rolling release, right?). I have just trying copying again the library from my system over there, but I still get the same error.

I noticed in the log file you mentioned this error at the end of the file. Hopefully it's harmless...

I could reproduce the error on Ubuntu 9.04 x86 (Pentium4 Prescott) with Sage 4.7, both from the Sage prompt and in GP (`sage -gp`), which raises the question if the Sage version running on the Xeon was perhaps also built as a 32-bit application.

#11130 seems far from ready to get merged, and it will be based on svn revision 13228, such that this PARI bug fix (from svn 12825) will be included anyway.

Until we have a working PARI 2.5.0.whatever, I think we should still add a few fixes to our more stable 2.4.3 series, to get merged in reasonable time.

---

P.S.: I've tested the p8 here on Ubuntu 9.04 x86 (Pentium4 Prescott) and Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64 (Core2), Sage 4.7 and 4.7.1.alpha2 respectively, running PARI's test suite as well as a full `ptestlong` on both.

As far as I can see, there've also been no follow-up reports regarding this change (of January 14th) on the PARI site.

-### pari-2.4.3.alpha.p8 (Leif Leonhardy, July 17th, 2011)
-* #11604: Apply patch for PARI bug 1154 (src/basemath/lll.c only,
-  from svn-12825). This fixes "rare" errors in ZM_lll_norms() that
-  apparently only occur on 32-bit systems, and don't show up in
-  any doctest nor PARI's test suite.
-
+This is fixed by #11130, this ticket simply adds a doctest.
