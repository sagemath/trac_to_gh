In 4.7.1:

```
sage: polar_plot(1/sin(1.001*theta),(theta, pi/12,pi/2))

Downloads/sage-4.7.1/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.pyc in print_png(self, filename_or_obj, *args, **kwargs)
    443             filename_or_obj = file(filename_or_obj, 'wb')
    444         _png.write_png(renderer._renderer.buffer_rgba(0, 0),
    445                        renderer.width, renderer.height,
--> 446                        filename_or_obj, self.figure.dpi)
    447         renderer.dpi = original_dpi

RuntimeError: Error building image
```
but this works

```
sage: polar_plot(1/sin(1.01*theta),(theta, pi/12,pi/2))
```
though it looks terrible, see attached pictures.

This no longer causes an error in 4.7.2, but the picture is still terrible.

Hat tip to Bill Page at [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/862/polar_plot1sinthetatheta-pi12-pi2) for noticing the error.

My guess is the automatic aspect ratio 1 is the problem, but that's just a guess.

Totes!  I just meant that I suspect this is causing it, so we'd have to do some kind of workaround.  

Actually, the "right" answer is to not allow such crazy axis behavior where the labels squash each other - maybe some kind of minimum figsize that keeps them looking ok - but I don't know if that would be easy to do at all.
