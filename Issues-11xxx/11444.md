On a related note, there seems to be exactly one set of doctests which even require this package optionally.  I'm surprised that numerical/backends/ and the graph stuff doesn't. I'm cc:ing Nathann about this.  After all, hopefully optional tests are at least *sometimes* run for major releases...

And when I run them, I get

That doesn't explain this doctest, though I have to admit I rarely run optional doctests because they usually involve programs I don't have.

Is there no way to generate a "canonical" answer from both packages? (Does that even make sense mathematically? I'm not familiar with the gale ryser theorem.) If not, I agree with Nathann.

Not that I know. When I write doctests using LP, I try to find examples for which the solution is unique, but there are many matrices solving the gale-ryser proble (ryser's algorithm even lets one enumerate them), and the solvers have no reason to return one rather than the other. Adding a fake objective functions to make the answer unique on the same problem would touch the running time just to make the doctests easier to write, which clearly isn't a good idea :-D

Does he have the same hardware? I know it builds on x86_64 with Phenom, and x86_32 Pentium something-or-other (I have an OLD computer at home :-)) and some other machine at work. i think the problem is whether it builds on the specific hardware listed.

Should that test be "optional - CPLEX"?

If all we care about is building on eno with gcc 4.7, this works fine. Here's info on eno: http://wiki.sagemath.org/skynet#Eno

As regards John's comment, this is exactly the place where the problem is reported.

I've reported the typo to the appropriate person, so this is good to go.
