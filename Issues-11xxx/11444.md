On a related note, there seems to be exactly one set of doctests which even require this package optionally.  I'm surprised that numerical/backends/ and the graph stuff doesn't. I'm cc:ing Nathann about this.  After all, hopefully optional tests are at least *sometimes* run for major releases...

And when I run them, I get

Hellooooooo !!!

Well, this doctest has been written before GLPK got installed as a standard spkg. Since then, a function using LP needs not be optional anymore. On the other hand, if you have CBC or CPLEX installed, the LP will be solved with them instead of GLPK. The truth is this #optional keyword could be removed. The only occurrences of "#optional CBC" should appear in the file numerical/backends/coin_backend.pyx

Interesting!  So maybe we should open another ticket to fix that.

That doesn't explain this doctest, though I have to admit I rarely run optional doctests because they usually involve programs I don't have.

Is there no way to generate a "canonical" answer from both packages? (Does that even make sense mathematically? I'm not familiar with the gale ryser theorem.) If not, I agree with Nathann.

Not that I know. When I write doctests using LP, I try to find examples for which the solution is unique, but there are many matrices solving the gale-ryser proble (ryser's algorithm even lets one enumerate them), and the solvers have no reason to return one rather than the other. Adding a fake objective functions to make the answer unique on the same problem would touch the running time just to make the doctests easier to write, which clearly isn't a good idea :-D

Does he have the same hardware? I know it builds on x86_64 with Phenom, and x86_32 Pentium something-or-other (I have an OLD computer at home :-)) and some other machine at work. i think the problem is whether it builds on the specific hardware listed.

Should that test be "optional - CPLEX"?

If all we care about is building on eno with gcc 4.7, this works fine. Here's info on eno: http://wiki.sagemath.org/skynet#Eno

As regards John's comment, this is exactly the place where the problem is reported.

I've reported the typo to the appropriate person, so this is good to go.
