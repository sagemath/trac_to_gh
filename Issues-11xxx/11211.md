```
The code for making an elliptic curve p-adic L-series in schemes/elliptic_curves/padic_lseries.py starts like this:

```
    def __init__(self, E, p, use_eclib=False, normalize='L_ratio'):
        r"""
        INPUT:

        -  ``E`` - an elliptic curve
        -  ``p`` - a prime of good reduction
        -  ``use_eclib`` - bool (default:True); whether or not to use
           John Cremona's ``eclib`` for the computation of modular
           symbols
```

Note that claim that use_eclib defaults to True and the fact that it doesn't. 

Since eclib is supposed to be correct, and is much faster, it should be the default as claimed in the docstring.  The fix should be a patch that changes the one `__init__` line.

<a id='comment:5'></a>I get zillions of errors in padic_lseries.py with this patch.  (31 in fact).

They all seem to be either

```
File "/home/jec/sage-4.7.alpha4/devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padics.py", iled example:
    sig_on_count()
Expected:
    0
Got:
    1
```
or

```
        def __reduce__(self):
      File "rational.pyx", line 484, in sage.rings.rational.Rational.__set_value (sage/rings/rational.c:7320)
        elif isinstance(x, tuple) and len(x) == 2:
      File "/home/jec/sage-current/local/lib/python/site-packages/sage/modular/cusps.py", line 512, in _rational_
        raise TypeError, "cusp %s is not a rational number"%self
    TypeError: cusp Infinity is not a rational number
```

Also in padics.py I get similar sig_on_count errors, and also 

```

File "/home/jec/sage-4.7.alpha4/devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padics.py", line 138:
    sage: P(0)
Expected:
    3 + 3^2 + 2*3^4 + 2*3^5 + O(3^6)
Got:
    2 + 3 + 3^2 + 2*3^3 + 2*3^5 + 3^6 + O(3^7)
```
which looks not so trivial.

I'll leave this as "needs review" and hope that Chris will also take a look.

No problem, I was just being optimistic.  I'm sure I can work out what is going on, since the problems arise only when eclib is used!

<a id='comment:15'></a>I confirm the failure on 32-bit computers with Sage 4.7.1, where the patch applies smoothly.

However there are already some tests that are known to fail on 32-bit, for example
in `lib/cremona/newforms.pyx`:

```
            sage: from sage.libs.cremona.newforms import ECModularSymbol
            sage: E = EllipticCurve('858k2')
            sage: ECModularSymbol(E)
            Traceback (most recent call last):                     # 32-bit
            ...                                                    # 32-bit
            OverflowError: long int too large to convert to int    # 32-bit
```
Should we mark the tests which are failing on 32-bit in the same way?

Paul

```
# 32-bit (see :trac: `11211`)
```
the fact that those tests don't work on 32-bit has nothing to do with this ticket, right?
I would expect that ticket number to refer to a ticket saying "make sure these tests pass even on 32-bit systems".

<a id='comment:23'></a>One other small but important comment (possibly for a different ticket, but I felt I should mention it): do not put Python code inside `sig_on()`, espcially not if that Python code can raise exceptions. In particular, the following 3 lines (possibly more) should be outside the `sig_on()` block:

```
r = Cusp(r) 
d = r.denominator() 
n = r.numerator() 
```

The consequences of this can be severe:

```
sage: from sage.libs.cremona.newforms import ECModularSymbol
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a')
sage: M = ECModularSymbol(E)
sage: M("garbage")
...
TypeError: unable to convert garbage to a rational
sage: pari("1/0")
...
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Sage will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

I also recommend that the line `M("garbage")` should become a doctest.
