These two files are actually **copied** by `spkg-install`:

```sh

install_docs()
{
    cp $SHARED/singular.hlp $SAGE_LOCAL/share/singular/
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Error installing documentation while copying singular.hlp"
        exit 1
    fi
    cp $SHARED/singular.idx $SAGE_LOCAL/share/singular/
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Error installing documentation while copying singular.idx"
        exit 1
    fi
}
```
So it's not really an upstream issue.

This doesn't work (i.e., doesn't solve the issue), since `cp` is required (by POSIX) to respect the `umask` unless `-p` is used (which we don't, see above).

Also, `janet.{cc,h}` are still executable in the upstream sources, and at least for me all headers still get installed with `-rwxr-xr-x`.

While you're at it (`spkg-install`), I think you should also add copying the `help.cnf` file (which is as noted missing in our "manual" installations).

Actually, the problem with `singular.{hlp,idx}` is not my `umask`, but that the files already existed (and don't get deleted prior to reinstallation), so their permissions didn't get changed.

Anyway, using `cp -p` would solve this.

It is an upstream issue because the files have permission 0600 in the source tree, so they are copied to permission 0600 (both with and without -p).

The installation of the headers as executable files is an upstream problem.  I have not really pinned it down, but the Singular install scripts are full of `chmod`s.

Anyway, I have a new spkg up at [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/singular-3-1-1-4.p11.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/singular-3-1-1-4.p11.spkg) using `cp -p` for the help files and removing an existing `chmod` hack.  I also made some file non-executable.

I do not want to make further changes here which are unrelated to the ticket.  I agree with some of the points you make, but not for this ticket.

FWIW, I've attached replacement files for `patches/Singular-Makefile.in` and `patches/Singular-Makefile.in.patch` to #11645, i.e. a cumulative patch to `src/Singular/Makefile.in` and the corresponding pre-patched file (which currently gets copied over into the upstream source tree).

Otherwise **positive review** for the *current* p11, as it now fixes the permissions issue (i.e., files not readable by "others"), though I think we should fix this in a more general way. (We'll have to check and probably change the upstream sources again on any upstream upgrade.)

Revert the status to "needs review" in case you want to fix #11645 *here*, too (by simply replacing the two files in `patches/` as mentioned above, and of course updating `SPKG.txt`.)
