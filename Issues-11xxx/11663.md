These two files are actually **copied** by `spkg-install`:

```sh

install_docs()
{
    cp $SHARED/singular.hlp $SAGE_LOCAL/share/singular/
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Error installing documentation while copying singular.hlp"
        exit 1
    fi
    cp $SHARED/singular.idx $SAGE_LOCAL/share/singular/
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Error installing documentation while copying singular.idx"
        exit 1
    fi
}
```
So it's not really an upstream issue.

This doesn't work (i.e., doesn't solve the issue), since `cp` is required (by POSIX) to respect the `umask` unless `-p` is used (which we don't, see above).

Also, `janet.{cc,h}` are still executable in the upstream sources, and at least for me all headers still get installed with `-rwxr-xr-x`.

While you're at it (`spkg-install`), I think you should also add copying the `help.cnf` file (which is as noted missing in our "manual" installations).

Actually, the problem with `singular.{hlp,idx}` is not my `umask`, but that the files already existed (and don't get deleted prior to reinstallation), so their permissions didn't get changed.

It is an upstream issue because the files have permission 0600 in the source tree, so they are copied to permission 0600 (both with and without -p).

The installation of the headers as executable files is an upstream problem.  I have not really pinned it down, but the Singular install scripts are full of `chmod`s.

Anyway, I have a new spkg up at [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/singular-3-1-1-4.p11.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/singular-3-1-1-4.p11.spkg) using `cp -p` for the help files and removing an existing `chmod` hack.  I also made some file non-executable.

I do not want to make further changes here which are unrelated to the ticket.  I agree with some of the points you make, but not for this ticket.

However, I can also quickly provide a new Singular spkg based on Karl-Dieter's (p12 then), based on yours, meanwhile p11. :)

FWIW, I've attached replacement files for `patches/Singular-Makefile.in` and `patches/Singular-Makefile.in.patch` to #11645, i.e. a cumulative patch to `src/Singular/Makefile.in` and the corresponding pre-patched file (which currently gets copied over into the upstream source tree).

Otherwise **positive review** for the *current* p11, as it now fixes the permissions issue (i.e., files not readable by "others"), though I think we should fix this in a more general way. (We'll have to check and probably change the upstream sources again on any upstream upgrade.)

Revert the status to "needs review" in case you want to fix #11645 *here*, too (by simply replacing the two files in `patches/` as mentioned above, and of course updating `SPKG.txt`.)
