See the attached PDF for an example of a class that has no `_latex_`. All commands are repeated twice, one with Sage-4.7 and the second one with the patch applied. In both cases typeset checkbox on the top of the worksheet was tuned on.

Also, I invite you to try

```
RubiksCube()
```
in the notebook with typeset mode on before and after the patch - such situations are precisely the ones that I wanted to solve (they are so bad, that printout does not reflect them accurately).

It is possible that user classes will not have customized latex method and there are some standard classes that use their string representation. If this representation includes multiple lines, the result in most cases is not very good and sometimes quite horrible, making it unpleasant to use the notebook in typeset mode. The patch aims to fix this situation and clean up latex module along the way.

The major change is in `sage.latex.str_function`. Also `sage.latex.JSMath.eval` is simplified a bit and does not alter the code almost at all anymore. The rest are mostly doctest adjustments and some code clean-up and simplifications which happened while I was going through it to understand how it works.

Overall, this looks pretty good, but it could use some work.  Here are some comments.

- in html.py, the comments "We work around a limitation of jsmath (it can't typeset '\texttt')::" should be deleted, since those doctests don't involve texttt anymore.  (Do we even need to do the replacement `s.replace('\\texttt','\\hbox')` now, or can that code be deleted?)

- in latex.py, for bool_function and None_function, "\mathrm{%s}" is preferable to "{\rm %s}".  Actually, I think we can just return "\mathrm{%s}" always, regardless of notebook vs. command line distinctions.  Do you know why we had two versions for bool_function before?  It looks okay to me without the mbox...

- a few typos and rewordings:

- another comment about the old code: I think that the output from dict_function looks better with no extra space after the colon, so I would suggest the following, but take a look yourself and see what you think:

```
- Also, in JSMath().eval, if x is already a LaTeX expression, then x=str(x) doesn't do anything, and neither does x=latex(x), so I think we can simplify it more:

```diff

- Finally, the output in one of the doctests,

```

```
 looks like bad latex: the "&lt;" inside of the \verb environment shouldn't be typeset correctly, but it actually seems to work.  I wonder why...

When we switch to MathJax (#9774), we'll have to redo some of this.

Thanks for the comments!

I don't know why there are differences for different modes, this is the first time I am working with these modules. I agree that the fewer are differences the better and will also remove the extra space.

Here is the reason for extra string conversion:

```
sage: s = "asdf fs"
sage: l = latex(s)
sage: print l
sage: print latex(l)
sage: print latex(str(l))
\verb|asdf|\phantom{x}\verb|fs|
\verb|asdf|\phantom{x}\verb|fs|
\verb"\verb|asdf|\phantom{x}\verb|fs|"
```
As I understand, the idea is that when user types `latex(x)` in the notebook, then (s)he wants to see the actual LaTeX code. So it will be wrapped the second time and displayed.

Regarding `&lt;` - it is not produced in normal LaTeX but can happen only in jsMath. For some reason it parses `<` even inside verb and the old solution was to insert extra spaces (which somehow prevents it from this mistake), but this alters the output and looks especially bad on typesetting things like `>=`. Replacing it with HTML code seems to work, I don't know why and I don't really care - once it is fixed upstream, we will see a doctest break and can remove this workaround. (Hopefully we can also get rid of phantoms eventually, but in MathJax the problem was still present two weeks ago. I don't think it is possible to write a doctest that will detect fixing the spacing issue upstream.)

I happened to take a look at the ticket, so I saw the new patch; mine is based on that one.

The documentation for regular expressions in Python is [here](http://docs.python.org/library/re.html).  In the code

```
if s.find('\\verb') != -1: 
    import re 
    s = re.sub("\\\\verb(.)(.*?)\\1", "\\2", s) 
    s = s.replace("\\phantom{x}", " ") 
```
the second and third lines are the ones involving regular expressions.  Line 3 is a search-and-replace command: it searches the argument s for a pattern `\verb` followed by a single character (that's the `.`), and putting that character in parentheses allows you to refer to it later as `\1`.  Then there are any number of characters (that's the `.*?`, also enclosed in parentheses, so you can refer to it later as `\2`), followed by whatever the first character was (that's the `\\1`).  It replaces all of this with the string in the second set of parentheses, `\2`.

There is one subtlety in this: the standard way to refer to any string of characters is `.*`, but the problem here is that in a string like

```
\verb|a|, \verb|b|
```
if we used `.*`, then the string \2 would match "a|, \verb|b" -- everything between the first "|" and the last "|": by default, regular expression matches use the longest match possible.  Using `.*?` instead of `.*` tells it to match the shortest string possible instead, so it does two replacements: first \2 matches "a", and then it matches "b", turning this into

```
a, b
```
