Multiplying two ordinary matrices using numpy segfaults `sage`. Using a standard Python install, this does not happen.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Run sage
2. Run the following code:

```python
import numpy as np
ms = np.load('matrices.npy')
np.dot(ms[0],ms[1])
```

Observe that Sage segfaults.

The actual segfault notification is: 

```
/PersonalStorage/Development/tools/sage/local/lib/libcsage.so(print_backtrace+0x31)[0x7f39008bd817]
/PersonalStorage/Development/tools/sage/local/lib/libcsage.so(sigdie+0x14)[0x7f39008bd849]

/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0(+0xfc60)[0x7f39068d2c60]
/PersonalStorage/Development/tools/sage/local/lib/libatlas.so(+0x6b70d)[0x7f38fa76b70d]

----
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage. This
probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You
might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.
```

Running this code outside of Sage, in another python interpreter (with numpy 1.5.1) does not exhibit this fault.

For my work, this is debilitating; and I hope to publish a paper using these results soon.

Thanks for your report. For the record, these are two 512x512 matrices.

Works for me with Sage 4.7.1.rc0, Ubuntu 10.04.3 x86_64; I'll try Sage 4.7 later.

Did you compile Sage from source? If not, please do so, as we at least currently cannot guarantee what ATLAS produces works on all processors, i.e., we unfortunately had a couple of issues (segfaults) with ATLAS and large matrices in **binary** Sage distributions; these issues vanished when using a version of Sage built on the affected machines.


P.S.: Please use the wiki markup (`{{{ ... }}}`) for Sage code and screen output examples.

FWIW, I do get exactly the same error *with the binary distribution* of Sage 4.7 (`sage-4.7-linux-64bit-ubuntu_10.04.1_lts-x86_64-Linux.tar.lzma`) on Ubuntu 10.04.3 x86_64 (Core2, Penryn):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.

I **don't** get an error with Sage 4.7.rc2 (which is almost identical to the final version released) *built from source* on the same machine.

Note that Sage will generally also run faster if it was built on the machine (more precisely, a machine with the same or similar type of processor) it is running on.

@nexttime: Thank you for neatening the bug report. I did not know the wiki syntax to format it; though I admit I should have looked it up.

To be more precise, though it looks as if you are able to reproduce my issues already, and so it is not required:

```
$ uname -a
Linux themadhatter-desktop 3.0.0-8-generic #10-Ubuntu SMP Fri Aug 5 23:54:15 UTC 2011 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

I can reproduce this in a fresh install of sage-4.7 from a binary installation; but also on an install of sage-4.6.2 . I have not tested on other installations.

I suppose the remedy appears to be to compile it manually; and so I'll do that. You don't need me to say that this is suboptimal though ;).

Thank you for your quick responses :).

I think they differ enough to consider this a non-architecture related bug... But I'm no expert on these things.

With your machines, building Sage from source shouldn't take long, but I noticed you have a Linux 3.0 kernel installed, which might cause problems with Python (not the kernel, just the number[!], cf. #11619).

So if you have a chance, I would build it on a machine with a similar processor but a 2.x kernel (and preferably the same Linux distribution), and then move / tar-untar the installation (or "bdist" it in case you're familiar with that).

I think this ATLAS compilation bug has something to do with https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9385 .

If need be, I am happy to provide ssh access to one of my machines so that you can poke through what's going on.

You might have to disable CPU throttling, i.e. "power save mode". Also, ATLAS 3.8.3 doesn't know good parameters for more recent processors (like those of the Core i7 family), such that it tries more things on these, making the build take much longer.

I'd also strongly suggest to use the new ATLAS spkg from #10226 (which provides ATLAS 3.8.**4** and also much better build options, please see the ticket for details).

Unfortunately this spkg won't even get into Sage 4.7.1 (to be released Monday I think, as we just released rc2).

To use that spkg, simply copy it into `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/`; Sage will automatically pick up the most recent one.

> If need be, I am happy to provide ssh access to one of my machines so that you can poke through what's going on.

Might be an option, but it's perhaps easier if you first try the above, since disabling the power save mode AFAIK requires root privileges (at least on some systems)... ;-)

P.S.: I guess you'll already know, but you can build Sage in parallel by doing:

```sh
export SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD=yes
export MAKE="make -j4" # build with 4 jobs (threads)
make
```
Depending on your machine (number of cores and amount of RAM), you can also use larger numbers, i.e. more jobs.

On my Core2 quad, building Sage (from scratch) that way takes about 27 + 18 minutes (code + documentation; the latter unfortunately doesn't make use of more than one core, which is subject to change soon).




To watch ATLAS's progress, you can open another terminal window and do

```sh
tail -f $SAGE_ROOT/install.log | grep STAGE
```
after starting `make`. (Actually you can also start it earlier; `tail -f` won't terminate by itself, i.e., you'll have to terminate it by pressing Control-C anyway.)

FWIW, I don't get the segfault when running the example with Valgrind (3.6.1; 3.5.0 raises a `SIGILL` because it doesn't know some instructions) and the binary distribution of Sage 4.7 (built on / for Ubuntu 10.04.1 x86_64), apparently because Valgrind replaces `malloc()` and `free()` etc.:

I now really wonder whether the segfault would occur on redhawk (the machine the binary distribution was built on) itself, and what GCC version it uses...

It's clearly the shared ATLAS library of the binary distribution; if I replace it with a "native" one (built on my machine, with Sage 4.7.1.rc2, i.e. from the ATLAS 3.8.3.p16 spkg; GCC 4.5.1), the segfault also doesn't occur.

I think it would be solved by adding -ldl to the end of the compiler command; I'm just not sure where to do that in the Sage automated install.

Any ideas?

Replying to [mister.wardrop](#comment%3A27):

Whoops, we already had some trouble with Singular (including race conditions in parallel builds) and fixed a lot, but I've never seen this before.

`configure` should notice whether `-ldl` is necessary (on Linux always AFAIK), and add that.

If you're not going to touch the Singular spkg itself, adding `-ldl` to `LDFLAGS` could help (and shouldn't hurt otherwise, though a bit odd), but I don't know whether it'll be added in the right position to solve the problem.

You can try:

```sh
env LDFLAGS=-ldl ./sage -i spkg/standard/singular-*
# and if that worked, continue with
make
```

P.S.: Are you building Sage 4.7 or a later devel release (4.7.1.*)?

P.P.S.:

My `spkg/logs/singular-3-1-1-4.p9.log` shows

```
checking for dlopen in -ldl... yes

and apparently it is added in a lot of linker commands.

It isn't clear from your screen dump which `make` target actually failed.

Okay... so before you responded, I had dropped down to a sage subshell and added "-ldl" to the LDFLAGS environment variable; and tried a manual ./spkg-install . This worked; and the build completed; and so I returned to the automatic build; only to find that it had not registered that the spkg install had been completed. So I tried to do it your way; and it worked fine.

Do you want me to give you the build log of the failed build?

I am building the official sage 4.7 release :).

You could attach it (just the Singular one), though it will now contain at least one failed and one successful build; hope it isn't too large. (Otherwise you could cut it where the successful build starts, or upload it elsewhere.)

I wouldn't try that... ;-)

Debian changed the locations of libraries, so that might be the cause.

Ah, trouble to come (with newer Debian derivatives I guess):

`-ldl` is there, just the order of libraries is wrong, as `-ldl` is passed **before** `-lkernel` is.

You'd have to edit its `makefile`:

```sh
cd /tmp
tar xjf $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/symmetrica-2.0.p5.spkg
vi symmetrica-2.0.p5/src/makefile # move the -lm to the end of the line
                                  # (or just comment the line out, `test` isn't needed).
tar cjf $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/symmetrica-2.0.p5.spkg symmetrica-2.0.p5/
cd $SAGE_ROOT
```
The rerun `make`.

P.S.: You can also drop into `#sagemath` on `irc.freenode.net`.
