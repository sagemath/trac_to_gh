I added a patch which rewrites `_slider01` and seems to fix the bug. It has commented out print statements, which need to be removed. I left them in though, since they are easy to remove. My patch passes docstring tests. I also aded the tests that check that the original bug report found.

Hellooooo !!!

I've been trying to apply your patch with all the possible orderings, but I can't get it to pass `^^;`

Among other things there is a "fixedcol" variable in your .3 patch that I don'tsee appearing in the original file, nor in my patch nor in your .2 `^^;`

Hello !

David and I talked about it over emails, but even though the patch fixes the bug there is now a large difference in speed between the two algorithms.

Using the test function defined in the docstring, it gives :

```
sage: %timeit test_algorithm("ryser", 10, 20)
5 loops, best of 3: 2.25 s per loop
sage: %timeit test_algorithm("gale", 10, 20)
5 loops, best of 3: 29.2 ms per loop
```

It is probable that this implementation could be greatly improved, at least by rewriting it in Cython, but as it could take some time and as this already comes from a nasty bug that has been noticed in the Graph library, perhaps the best is to have a quick fix for now.

With this patch, the default algorithm is moved to "gale", and I also edited a part of the docstring which did not make sense anymore, now that GLPK is by default included in Sage.

If you can review my patch, or if you found a wonderful way to get its former speed's back in between... `:-)`

In principle, your patch is good. It reads fine. However, when you change the default,
the output can change, at least in cases when there is some symmetry in one or both of the partitions. In this case, I am getting some new docstring failures. Can you please check those and fix them too?

Sorry for the delay.

The reviewer's patch applies (on top of the previous patch) fine on 4.7.1.rc1.
It passes all tests. I read through the patch itself which is mostly docstring fixes but also implements the trivial case of the 0 matrix (which a corresponding added doctest).

Thanks Nathann!
