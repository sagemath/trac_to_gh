```
var('c', domain='complex')
var('x', domain='real')
C = c * exp(-x^2)
print (C)
    c*e^(-x^2)

print (C.imag())
    e^(-x^2)*imag_part(c)

print (C.imag().simplify_full()) 
    0
```

Related to two-year old bug #6862. It seems, variables declared as 'complex', are assumed real in maxima. This is fixed by using sage's assume command

```
assume(c, 'complex')
print (C.imag().simplify_full()) 
```
gives the correct result.
