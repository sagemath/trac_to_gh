In the code below, `a5` and `b5` are PARI integers equal to 5 but they have different hashes:

```

```

This bug was discovered for ideals having different hashes.

The problem is with the initialization of integers in `new_gen_from_mpz_t()`.  The attached patch fixes various instances of bad PARI object initialization.

I read the patch, which is mostly about rewriting Cython code against the PARI library in a way that looks much cleaner and makes sense.  I don't quite understand precisely what it is about the code here that fixes the bug though. 

All tests pass, and the new code looks and reads well.

As William, I read the ticket description and the patch and I don't understand what is really the cause of the issue and why the patch fixes it.

I'd encourage Jeroen to add a comment explaining this bit and, if possible, to split the patch in two parts: a "fix the issue" part and a "cleanup" part (in the order that is most convenient).

I'm also wondering if the hash of a pari integer should match the hash of the corresponding sage or python integers. That is carefully considered in the sage integers/rationals, etc. The principle is that two values that are equivalent (for the purposes of equality comparision) should have the same hash to avoid nastiness in using the values as dictionary keys. The same would be true for some other pari types.
