In the code below, `a5` and `b5` are PARI integers equal to 5 but they have different hashes:

```
sage: pariK=pari("nfinit(x^2-x-1)"); b5 = pari(5); b5.debug(); a5 = pari(5); a5.debug(); print a5.__hash__(), b5.__hash__()

-1729382256910270461 -8646911284551352317
```

This bug was discovered for ideals having different hashes.

The problem is with the initialization of integers in `new_gen_from_mpz_t()`.  The attached patch fixes various instances of bad PARI object initialization.

I read the patch, which is mostly about rewriting Cython code against the PARI library in a way that looks much cleaner and makes sense.  I don't quite understand precisely what it is about the code here that fixes the bug though. 

All tests pass, and the new code looks and reads well.

As William, I read the ticket description and the patch and I don't understand what is really the cause of the issue and why the patch fixes it.

I'd encourage Jeroen to add a comment explaining this bit and, if possible, to split the patch in two parts: a "fix the issue" part and a "cleanup" part (in the order that is most convenient).

I'm also wondering if the hash of a pari integer should match the hash of the corresponding sage or python integers.
