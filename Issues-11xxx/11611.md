Keywords: pari cgetg integer ideal hnf

In the code below, `a5` and `b5` are PARI integers equal to 5 but they have different hashes:

```
sage: pariK=pari("nfinit(x^2-x-1)"); b5 = pari(5); b5.debug(); a5 = pari(5); a5.debug(); print a5.__hash__(), b5.__hash__()
[&=00000000049437b0] INT(lg=3):0200000000000003 (+,lgefint=3):4000000000000003 0000000000000005

-1729382256910270461 -8646911284551352317
```

This bug was discovered for ideals having different hashes.

The problem is with the initialization of integers in `new_gen_from_mpz_t()`.  The attached patch fixes various instances of bad PARI object initialization.
