In the code below, `a5` and `b5` are PARI integers equal to 5 but they have different hashes:

```
sage: pariK=pari("nfinit(x^2-x-1)"); b5 = pari(5); b5.debug(); a5 = pari(5); a5.debug(); print a5.__hash__(), b5.__hash__()

```

This bug was discovered for ideals having different hashes.

The problem is with the initialization of integers in `new_gen_from_mpz_t()`.  The attached patch fixes various instances of bad PARI object initialization.
