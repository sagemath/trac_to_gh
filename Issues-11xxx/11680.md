Right now, the following file `foo.pyx` cannot be just loaded into Sage:

```
from sage.rings.rational cimport Rational
from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_rational_flint cimport Polynomial_rational_flint
from sage.libs.flint.fmpq_poly cimport (fmpq_poly_get_coeff_mpq, fmpq_poly_set_coeff_mpq,
                                        fmpq_poly_length)

def evaluate_at_power_of_gen(Polynomial_rational_flint f, unsigned long n):
    assert n >= 1
    cdef Polynomial_rational_flint res = f._new()
    cdef unsigned long k
    cdef Rational z = Rational(0)
    for k in range(fmpq_poly_length(f.__poly)):
        fmpq_poly_get_coeff_mpq(z.value, f.__poly, k)
        fmpq_poly_set_coeff_mpq(res.__poly, n*k, z.value)
    return res
```

The main reason is that there is no way to tell Sage (i.e., the file `cython.py`) that the code needs to have the extra compile flag:

```
              extra_compile_args = ['-std=c99'],
```

Currently `devel/sage/sage/misc/cython.py` supports "clang", "clib", and "cinclude" pragmas.  But none of these let us add an `extra_compile_arg` or use C99.

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
So what do you propose?

Since `c99` is actually also *a program* (and could be considered a language of its own), I'd suggest to both support

```python
#clang c99
```
**and** some other way to specify "flags" or compile-time options, perhaps also to the linker.

AFAIK there's currently not even a way to specify `cython` options in a `.pyx` file.

Allowing / using strings that get passed literally to the compiler driver (and perhaps also directly to the linker) is very flexible, but the Cython files may of course get less portable (which is perhaps a minor issue for the Sage library, at least at the moment).

---

What Cython needs, too, is some kind of conditional compilation (Ã  la `#ifdef` etc.) anyway... ;-)

Do you need or imagine any other "generic" options (other than for compiling as C99 code) which you'd rather like to specify "non-verbatim", i.e., without using  a string to be directly passed to e.g. `gcc`?

In addition to

```python
#clang C99
```
I could imagine having

```python
#coptions keyword1 keyword2 keyword3
```
which are then mapped to the appropriate flags and passed to their respective component (`cython`, the C or C++ compiler, or the linker).

This should be quite flexible, since changes to the flags effectively used (e.g for different compilers or compiler versions) would be limited to `sage.misc.cython*`.




I don't know if we'd in addition need something like

```python
#cpragma "CFLAGS" "-D_XPG6 --some-very-rare-and-specific-options another_argument"
#cpragma "LDFLAGS" "-L/unusual/location"
```
etc.

We could even extend this to conditionals (e.g. depending on the operating system):

Will give it a try...

Hmmm, the naming isn't very clear.

I'd use some plural form for `cfile`, i.e. `cfiles`, or something else, e.g. `csources`, which clearly indicates that these are additional, "arbitrary" source files to also be compiled into the extension module.

`cargs` is similarly ambiguous, as the `c` refers to Cython, not C, but the "args" are passed to the C or C++ compiler rather than to `cython` itself.

(I admit that `clib` and `cinclude` could perhaps have better names, or at least the plural form, as well; especially for the latter it isn't clear that its parameters are or can be actually *search paths*.)




For compiling C99, I still prefer having `#clang C99` (case-insensitive for all languages btw.).

P.S.: Now I'm happy *I* didn't also work on this yesterday... ;-)

Replying to [@nexttime](#comment%3A8):
> Hmmm, the naming isn't very clear.

Agreed.

> I'd use some plural form for `cfile`, i.e. `cfiles`, or something else, e.g. `csources`, which clearly indicates that these are additional, "arbitrary" source files to also be compiled into the extension module.

Those weren't added in this ticket.

> `cargs` is similarly ambiguous, as the `c` refers to Cython, not C, but the "args" are passed to the C or C++ compiler rather than to `cython` itself.

Yep, the whole cprefix thingy is ambiguous. Perhaps there should be another ticket where the whole system is overhauled?

> (I admit that `clib` and `cinclude` could perhaps have better names, or at least the plural form, as well; especially for the latter it isn't clear that its parameters are or can be actually *search paths*.)

These weren't added in this ticket.

> For compiling C99, I still prefer having `#clang C99` (case-insensitive for all languages btw.).

I have no preference either way. GCC treats it as an option. Hence, I think it's okay to have it as part of `cargs`.

> P.S.: Now I'm happy *I* didn't also work on this yesterday... ;-)

But you could work on a more general ticket tomorrow ;-)

Revisiting this, I don't think the `TESTS` dictionary and the `import_test()` function should be part of the module itself at all, as they provide no functionality. (I actually reviewed an earlier version of the patch.)

They should either be part of *the docstring* as an -- of course longer -- example, or somewhere in `sage/tests/`.




W.r.t. the temporary files:

I think it is a more general problem that Cython apparently puts temporary files into the current working directory, just mangling the original path, and, secondly, not deleting them afterwards.

I'm pretty sure I've seen similar files sporadically occurring without ever getting deleted in previous releases (i.e., e.g. last year).

P.S.: But John's suggestion is IMHO -- perhaps as a temporary fix only -- ok here (in that it should fix the issue in an easy way), since using `sage.server.support.cython_import()` *for this purpose* is simply an abuse of that function... ;-)

Maybe we should also use `create_local_c_file=False`; I guess that also suppresses the HTML counterpart.

FWIW, the following fixes the issue for me, **without** changing the current working directory:

```diff
diff --git a/sage/misc/cython.py b/sage/misc/cython.py
--- a/sage/misc/cython.py
+++ b/sage/misc/cython.py
@@ -627,7 +627,8 @@
     file = tmp_filename() + ".pyx"
     open(file,'w').write(code)
     from sage.server.support import cython_import
-    return cython_import(file)
+    # return cython_import(file, create_local_c_file=False, annotate=False)
+    return cython_import(file, create_local_c_file=False)
 
 
 TESTS = {
```

The line I've commented out does **not** work, since `cython_import()` doesn't propagate the `annotate` keyword to `sage.misc.cython.cython()` (i.e., it doesn't take such a keyword argument), which is perhaps a bug by itself.

However, using just `create_local_c_file=False` is sufficient.

We definitely want `create_local_c_file=False`, not just `annotate=False`, because there are c files being created as well.  I've created #11887 to deal with this.

I meant *both* of course, but disabling the former apparently also disables the latter.
