This may as well be made to work:

```
sage: EllipticCurve(u'389a')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/wstein/db/shark2011/<ipython console> in <module>()

/usr/local/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/constructor.pyc in EllipticCurve(x, y, j)
    312 
    313     if not isinstance(x,list):
--> 314         raise TypeError, "invalid input to EllipticCurve constructor"
    315 
    316     x = Sequence(x)

TypeError: invalid input to EllipticCurve constructor
```

Probably need an "isinstance(x, (str, unicode)):" somewhere.
