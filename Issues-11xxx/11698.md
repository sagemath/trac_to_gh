In the [part about docbuilding](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/sage_manuals.html#building), there is a small typo.

```
as explained below. Use the following command to obtain more documentation for the sage -docbuild script:

sage -docbuild -help
```
should have either `--help`, `-h`, or `--help-all` (the latter does something different, though still useful - maybe both should be documented).  The current thing does the same as `-h` but gives a Sphinx warning about the unknown option `e`.

Hmmm, so far only looked at the patch:

I would consistently use double dashs for all long options, i.e. `--docbuild`, since many people consider long options with a single dash deprecated, so we IMHO shouldn't encourage people to use the "old" form.

The quoted strings `"html"`, `"pdf"` etc. should IMHO be typeset as code, i.e. <code>``html``</code>, <code>``pdf``</code> and the like.

I'd say *"for the options to `sage --docbuild`"* rather than *"for the `sage -docbuild` script"*.

[I'm aware or, more precisely, pretty sure that there are many further instances of the above in the Developer's Guide; I'd be happy with just changing them in the currently affected file, `sage_manuals.rst`.]




We should also somehow make sure the typos (if present) get fixed in the translations, though apparently there are no direct translations of this document / file, at least not in the current release.

IIRC a Russian translation is ready to get merged, and a not-that-ready German one rottens somewhere... ;-)

See, now you are asking me to change things that were not broken, presumably.  I just fixed the specific typos involved with help.

> The quoted strings `"html"`, `"pdf"` etc. should IMHO be typeset as code, i.e. <code>``html``</code>, <code>``pdf``</code> and the like.


I thought about that, but again, it was a bigger change than I wanted to make.

That seems ok.

> [I'm aware or, more precisely, pretty sure that there are many further instances of the above in the Developer's Guide; I'd be happy with just changing them in the currently affected file, `sage_manuals.rst`.]


I would ask for a different ticket to fix all those things consistently.  I had time to make this patch, but not that bigger patch you are talking about (I'd rather review someone else's patches on other tickets).

> IIRC a Russian translation is ready to get merged, and a not-that-ready German one rottens somewhere... ;-)

Hmm, I didn't know that.

It looks ok, but I'm not able to check that it applies currently.    All the extra changes are ones that Leif suggested, and everything else is still correct from my patch.    

So I'll move this to positive review, but only because the release manager is the one who wrote it, one who is *very* diligent in checking whether things apply :)

By the way, why are we considering `-option` deprecated in favor of `--option`?  This is the sort of thing that definitely seems arbitrary, especially if both of them work...

This is essentially a standard set by GNU. For example, `ls --help` will work but `ls -help` will be interpreted as `ls -h -e -l -p`. But even GNU has exceptions, for example GCC has all single-dash options.

Because long options with a single dash are odd in that they prevent us from using e.g. `sage -tlvp 4 ...` instead of `sage -tp 4 -long -verbose ...`.

Sage really wasn't designed very well regarding that.  (Worse, also the order matters; you e.g. cannot use `-s -i` instead of `-i -s`, nor `-is` or `-si`, and `-ba-force` is not an alternate form of `-b -a -f` or `--build --all --force`.)

Actually it's a Unix convention, from the very beginning, that you can specify `-aBc` as well as `-a -B -c` (having the same meaning).  Then the alternate long options (*always* with a double dash) came, although today a few do not even have a corresponding short form.

Regarding GCC, that to some extent depends on the interpretation; for example the various `-f`, `-m` and `-W` options can be considered taking (mandatory) arguments which immediately follow the (single letter) option, without a separator.  On the other hand, there are options like `-ansi`, `-pipe`, `-print-search-dirs`, `--target-help` and `--version`, where the former three of course *are* long options with only a single dash (and none of them take a parameter).
