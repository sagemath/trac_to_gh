The main point of this ticket was to add `FanMorphism.is_fibration` method, but along the way injectivity, surjectivity, and splitting were added as well.

I have also added several related methods and adjusted containment/embedding methods of fans to accommodate sublattices and make their behaviour more uniform: now cone containment check is an attempt to embed the given cone into the fan.

I have also started using ``@`cached_method` decorator since it is convenient and its speed and documentation issues should be resolved in the near future. Note, however, that some methods of fans still should use manual cache since they need to preprocess arguments first.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Hi Volker,

I fixed the mistake you have found and wrote `is_surjective`.

While I am at it, I also started writing `is_injective`, but it is a bit trickier: we want the lattice map to have index one in the saturation of its image (in Sage, conveniently, `self.matrix().index_in_saturation() == 1`) and for every (primitive) cone `tau` mapped to `sigma` the dimension of `tau` must be the same as the dimension of the intersection of `sigma` with the image lattice of the lattice map. To make this easier and potentially simplify life in the future with computing fibers of generic fan/toric morphisms, I am thinking of adding the following methods:

1. `image_lattice` to be the sublattice generated by the image of the domain lattice.
2. `image_fan` to be the intersection of the codomain fan with the image lattice.
3. `image_restriction` to be the fan morphism from the original domain fan to the newly defined image fan.

Question: how should we name these methods? It seems to me that `image_lattice` fits nicely with `kernel_lattice`, but two others may be quite confusing/misleading, i.e. `image_fan` may refer to the image of the domain fan in the image lattice. One possible solution is not to implement such a method at all as it may be accessed via

```
phi.image_restriction().codomain_fan()
```
Any thoughts on this and the name for the `image_restriction` map?

<a id='comment:9'></a>Since our naming theme is to use `method()` for the inherited method on vector spaces and `method_fan()` for the induced function of the fan, how about `restrict_domain_fan()` and `restrict_codomain_fan()`. The restriction to the image would then be

phi.restrict_codomain_fan( phi.image_fan() )

For the restriction of the vector space map you have to use this construction as well, I think; as far as I can tell there is no method that restricts to the image in one go.

Also, I don't think `image_fan()` is overly confusing. After all, the fan is a collection of cones over `\QQ`.

For injectivity you need to check that the index of each domain cone is one (Def 2.1.7 in HLY). Are you going to override the `FanMorphism.index()` method? I would have thought that this is a logical place to put this functionality.

<a id='comment:10'></a>Yes, `phi.index(sigma)` is the way to go, I think, but having these indices equal to 1 is not enough (and they are all 1 if the linear map has index one in its image saturation). We also need "relative stars" to be trivial, so that in the notation of Proposition 2.1.4 in HLY `\tld{O}_\sigma` is a 1-to-1 cover and `F_\sigma^c` is a singleton.

Going back to names, I will try to be more careful in the future with checking inherited methods, but it seems to me now that
* `kernel_lattice` should be removed since `kernel` computes exactly the same thing using generic code.
* `image_lattice` should not be implemented since `phi.image().saturation()` does what I want and plane `image()` is also of interest in the toric setting. (Currently, saturation will not return a toric sublattice, but it is easy to fix.)

For the factoring of the fan morphism `phi: Sigma ---> Sigma'` we (always) have the following sequence of fan maps:

```
Sigma0 --0--> Sigma --1--> Sigma1 --2--> Sigma2 --3--> Sigma'
```
where `Sigma0` is the kernel fan, `Sigma1` is `phi(Sigma)` living in `phi(N_RR) \cap N'`, and `Sigma2` is `phi(N_RR) \cap Sigma'`. Map 1 is easy to construct as

```
FanMorphism(phi.matrix(), phi.domain_fan(), phi.image().saturation())
```
Maps 2 and 3 are basically given by identity matrix but there is currently no "one line way" to construct `Sigma2` which I want to add. Now what I was referring to, is that both `Sigma1` and `Sigma2` are natural candidates to be called `image_fan` since they are fans in the image of `phi` and perhaps `Sigma1` is more natural since it is literally the image fan of `Sigma` under `phi`.

Since "general" restrictions of `phi` to other fans can be easily done using `FanMorphism` constructor directly, I am not sure there is any need in adding special methods to restrict (co)domain to a provided fan. So I think I am in favor of adding only, say, `restrict_to_image()` with no arguments which will be the composition of maps 1 and 2 in the diagram. The main job of this function will be, of course, efficient construction of `Sigma2` and once it is done all maps of the sequence can be easily constructed if needed.

Summary of the proposal:
1. remove `kernel_lattice` and use inherited `kernel` instead;
2. tweak `saturation` to make `phi.image().saturation()` to return a toric sublattice;
3. add `restrict_to_image` returning the map `Sigma ---> Sigma2`;
4. let `phi.index(sigma)` take a cone as an argument and return its index in the sense of HLY.

Sounds good?
