<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

The patch applies and builds fine.  I learned a lot from reading the tutorial after testing that!

One thing does not work as advertised, I think:  using logstart.  I could not load unless I gave the logfile a suffix such as .sage or .py, note that the stored commands are preparsed before being stored.  But when the file is loaded in another session I do not see this

```
Loading log file <setup> one line at a time...
    Finished replaying log file <setup>
```
but rather this

```

sage: load "setup.py"
Activating auto-logging. Current session state plus future input saved.
Filename       : setup.py
Mode           : backup
Output logging : False
Raw input log  : False
Timestamping   : False
State          : active
```
which does load the stuff *but also overwrites the file setup.py*!!!

So I'm giving this  a positive review but want the other thing fixed before we forget all about it.

In response to kcrisman's comment on sage-devel, I added a little bit about commands run in the background not being preparsed.  Could you do another review on that?  I'm posting a new patch ("...v2.patch") and another patch showing the difference, for easy reference.

This never made it into the translations of the tutorial - German, French, or Russian. I don't know if they existed at the time in any case, but I've opened #14051 for this.  I don't know if the newer translations not yet in I reference their have this stuff or not.
