[Mpmath](http://mpmath.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/build/functions/expintegrals.html#erfinv) has an inverse erf.  [Maxima](http://www.ma.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2009/017196.html) now has an inverse erf.  We need it too.

It should be both symbolic and evaluated.  !Function_Erf could be used as a model.  Make sure to add it to the conversion list in sage.symbolic.pynac!  (Which should be elsewhere in any case...)

See [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/549/evaluating-inverse-erf) for background.  

Defect because Sage can't make sense of a Maxima result:

```
sage: var('z,t')
(z, t)
sage: PDF = exp(-x^2 /2)/sqrt(2*pi)
sage: integralExpr = integrate(PDF,x,z,oo).subs(z==log(t))
sage: y = solve(integralExpr==z,t)[0].rhs().subs(z==1/4)    
sage: y
e^(sqrt(2)*inverse_erf(1/2))
sage: inverse_erf?
Object `inverse_erf` not found.
```
