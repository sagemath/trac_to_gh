The following happens at least since sage-4.6.2 and was detected in #4539 by a new doctest:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: y^2^30
y^1073741824
sage: P.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: y^2^30
0
```

According to Hans, the maximal exponent of a variable in a monomial does depend on the number of variables in the ring. There is no function that returns that maximal exponent, but it is stored in the `bitmask` attribute of a ring. The Singular interpreter actually only tests whether the *total* degree is below what is provided by bitmask; in theory, *any* exponent (not only the totall degree) can go up to that bound.

Here is the corresponding code in Singular's `iparith.cc`:

```
static BOOLEAN jjTIMES_P(leftv res, leftv u, leftv v)
{
  poly a;
  poly b;
  int dummy;
  if (v->next==NULL)
  {
    a=(poly)u->CopyD(POLY_CMD); // works also for VECTOR_CMD
    if (u->next==NULL)
    {
      b=(poly)v->CopyD(POLY_CMD); // works also for VECTOR_CMD
      if ((a!=NULL) && (b!=NULL)
      && (pTotaldegree(a)+pTotaldegree(b)>si_max((long)rVar(currRing),(long)currRing->bitmask)))
      {
        Werror("OVERFLOW in mult(d=%ld, d=%ld, max=%ld)",
          pTotaldegree(a),pTotaldegree(b),currRing->bitmask);
        pDelete(&a);
        pDelete(&b);
        return TRUE;
...
```

The attached patch seems to solve the problem. It wraps the attribute `bitmask` of Singular's rings. Moreover, it detects exponent overflow in the same way as Singular does (see ticket description). `rVar` is in fact a macro that simply returns the `ring->N` attribute.

With the patch, I get (as a new doctest):

```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: y^2^30
y^1073741824
sage: P.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: y^2^30
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
OverflowError: Exponent overflow (1073741824).
```

I did not run the doc tests yet, but I think a reviewer can already have a look on it.

I wonder, though, whether the speed will be fine: I use the `max` function with the arguments being an unsigned long and a long. I can only hope that it is fast enough in Cython.

I did some tests with Cython functions either testing whether (for cdefined a,b,c) we have `a>max(b,c)` or `a>b and a>c`. The execution time was about the same. So, the patch should be fine as it is (modulo doctests, of course).

Very tricky. Singular correctly computes `x<sup>2</sup>30*x<sup>2</sup>30`, but it does not print it correctly, because when printing the exponent then it is converted in a different format:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: (x^2^30*x^2^30)
x^-2147483648
sage: (x^2^30*x^2^30).degree()
2147483648
```
So, *internally* the degree is correct.

Even more tricky: In the case of `x<sup>2</sup>31`, Singular believes that the result is zero. The `degree()` method first tests whether it is (believed to be) zero, and acts accordingly:

```
sage: (x^2^31).degree()
-1
sage: (x^2^31)
0
```

That happens when I remove the max_exponent_size. I suppose I shouldd revert that removal...

<div id="comment:5" align="right">Comment 5</div>

The latest patch version checks *both* whether the exponent exceeds max_exponent_size (which avoids some bugs that occur in Singular) *and* whether it is illegal in Singular (which avoids the bugs in Sage that led to the creation of this ticket).

We now have

```
        sage: x^2^30*x^2^30
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        OverflowError: Exponent overflow (2147483648).
```

I wonder whether the test, that became more expensive, led to an inacceptable speed regression. That should be investigated.

The tests in sage/rings/polynomial pass for me. I don't know about the rest. Needs review!

Here are some timings.

With the patch:

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: p = x+y
sage: %timeit q=p^20
625 loops, best of 3: 6.93 µs per loop
sage: p = x+y+z
sage: %timeit q=p^25
625 loops, best of 3: 418 µs per loop
sage: %timeit q=x^2^10
625 loops, best of 3: 2.1 µs per loop
```

Without the patch:

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: p = x+y
sage: %timeit q=p^20
625 loops, best of 3: 7.08 µs per loop
sage: p = x+y+z
sage: %timeit q=p^25
625 loops, best of 3: 419 µs per loop
sage: %timeit q=x^2^10
625 loops, best of 3: 2.14 µs per loop
```

These are only few data points, but they seem to show that the overhead is sufficiently small.

Alexander found (while reviewing #4539) that the patch from here results in two doctest errors on 32-bit machines (reasonable, since an overflow error will occur earlier on 32 bit than on 64 bit).

He provided a fix at #4539, but actually I think it should be included here. What do people think?

What ticket are you referring to by "this"? If "this" is #4539: #4539 depends on #11068, which depends on #11115. But if "this" is #11856 then I don't see a dependency. What do you mean? Is there fuzz when applying my or your patch? Does it not work without #11115?

The first patch has been rebased on top of #11339. The patch from #11339 did some cosmetic changes, such as replacing `p_Delete(&p,r)` by `p_Delete(&p, r)`. Therefore, one of the hunks from the first patch here did not apply.

Since it is a very simple editorial change, without changing the code, I am directly reinstating the positive review.

Attachment: **[trac11856_exponent_overflow.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11856/trac11856_exponent_overflow.patch.gz)**

It seems that I should not have rebased my ticket wrt #11339, but wrt #10903 (which in turn has #11339 as a dependency).

Namely, #11339 only works *together* with #10903.

Solution: Both #11339 and #10903 have a positive review. Hence, it is fine to make #10903 (and thus #11339 by transitivity) a dependency.

Running doctests now, again.
