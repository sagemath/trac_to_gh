The problem occurs in sage-4.7.1.alpha0.  So some change between sage-4.7 and sage-4.7.alpha0 is causing this problem.

I think this is due to the instruction `load(to_poly_solver)` that is in `init_code` in `sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py`.
The problem arises earlier in the initialization of maxima. The following is an excerpt of the instructions sent to ecl upon maxima_lib initialization, pasted into the ecl REPL:

```
That's a hardcoded path! Luckily there is an override. If you do a

```
export MAXIMA_PREFIX = $SAGE_ROOT/local
```
before starting sage, the problem goes away. So this should go somewhere in the start-up of sage.

The original patch didn't initially import cleanly in sage_scripts. So I regenerated it in, the new version is in git format as well.

Mariah can you test it?

This seems to fix the problem as far as I can tell, but would it be better to check whether `MAXIMA_PREFIX` is set first?  Something like this:

```
if [ -z "$MAXIMA_PREFIX" ]; then
    MAXIMA_PREFIX="$SAGE_ROOT/local" && export MAXIMA_PREFIX
fi
```
Is it possible that people will be (successfully) using their own installation of maxima?

We could also use `"$SAGE_LOCAL"` instead of `"$SAGE_ROOT/local"`; I'm not sure whether stylistically we should have any preference.

I considered that, but with the maxima.fas on libecl.so setup loaded inside sage's main process, people do not have the choice which installation of sage they run. Allowing sage's maxima work with a maxima library from a different install is risky at best (I don't know what exactly maxima gets from there at runtime) That's why I unconditionally set the variable.

If people want to run their own maxima via a pexpect interface, they can do so by setting the environment variable in a script wrapping the executable.
