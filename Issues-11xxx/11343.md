Please see below for what TinyMCE cells look like if you have an `@` in your username.  This is since at least 4.6, see [this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-notebook/browse_thread/thread/f0ceaa24700f4059).

I'm making this critical, because it removes major piece of functionality.  At the **very least**, we'll need to change the login page to remove the @ availability!!!

Re-enabling this is #11470.

From #8995, a dup of this: 


See the thread by Dennis Watson here:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_frm/thread/2acd499a566efce1

In particular, some tinymce javascript files were trying to download from a URL that included the username, like:

http://sagenb.org/home/usernamewith@/javascript/tiny_mce/langs/en.js

a) cannot repeat this with rkirov's flask version of nb and twisted-11 installed.

We really should not be releasing \"real\" releases of Sage that admins are using for nb servers without fixing at least the documentation.   I don't know what the current status is.  I don't think that the documentation fix was merged in sagenb, despite a number of pesters.  \n\nIs there a specific server I can test this on, Dima?   If there is a sense that flask will be merged soon AND this fixes it, great.    If not...  \n\nAlso, did you try it with several browsers?  I don't think it's browser-dependent but it's worth checking.\n\nI'm going to mark #8995 as the dup, just because this has more discussion and a patch, though I don't know if it still applies to sagenb.",

Fair enough, but WHEN will the upgrades happen? We really should not be releasing "real" releases of Sage that admins are using for nb servers without fixing at least the documentation.   I don't know what the current status is.  I don't think that the documentation fix was merged in sagenb, despite a number of pesters.  

Is there a specific server I can test this on, Dima?   If there is a sense that flask will be merged soon AND this fixes it, great.    If not...  

Also, did you try it with several browsers?  I don't think it's browser-dependent but it's worth checking.

I'm going to mark #8995 as the dup, just because this has more discussion and a patch, though I don't know if it still applies to sagenb.

I'm looking into it now. You can try meanwhile using test.sagenb.org, which runs twisted 11.
I'll open a ticket for upgrading twisted to version 11 real soon...

It works fine in opera even without the patch. But @ should not have been allowed in usernames anyway because of this message that I got while creating the username:

I created a fresh /tmp/a.sagenb directory and ran sage -n on that directory. The bug is there in opera-11.51 with sage-4.7.1, amd64 Gentoo Linux. Sorry for all the noise I created earlier.

I believe my ~/.sage directory was being written to by both sage-4.7 (with rkirov-flask notebook) and sage-4.7.1 (with old notebook) and so I wasn't seeing this bug earlier.

I cannot reproduce this on Opera 11.51, Build 1087, on Mac OS X 10.6.8 on flack notebook with the new tiny_mce 3.4.5.
Could you please try getting the tiny_mce upgrade from here:
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/tiny_mce-3.4.5.tar.bz
replace your `SAGE_ROOT/devel/....../sagenb/data/tiny_mce/` with the contents of this
archive, and try again?
