Please see below for what TinyMCE cells look like if you have an ``@`` in your username.  This is since at least 4.6, see [this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-notebook/browse_thread/thread/f0ceaa24700f4059).

I'm making this critical, because it removes major piece of functionality.  At the **very least**, we'll need to change the login page to remove the `@` availability!!!

Re-enabling this is #11470.

From #8995, a dup of this: 


See the thread by Dennis Watson here:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_frm/thread/2acd499a566efce1

In particular, some tinymce javascript files were trying to download from a URL that included the username, like:

http://sagenb.org/home/usernamewith`@`/javascript/tiny_mce/langs/en.js

I'm looking into it now. You can try meanwhile using test.sagenb.org, which runs twisted 11.
I'll open a ticket for upgrading twisted to version 11 real soon...
The initial spkg and a patch to have it running on Rado's flack notebook is already on 
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/
and

I tried with stock  Firefox, and Chrome on MacOSX 10.6.8...
I cannot reproduce it; please state the browser, OS, (and medication ;-))  you are on.

I can reproduce it with the stock Safari on the said platform (this also is not working with the updated version of tiny-mce, locally). 

Oh well, we all but banned IE from using the nb, we should ban other closed-source browsers. I seldom use Safari nowadays. Safari sucks. So is IE. Don't use them for serious business.

It works fine in opera even without the patch. But `@` should not have been allowed in usernames anyway because of this message that I got while creating the username:

*The username must start with a letter and be between 4 and 32 characters long. It can only consist of letters, numbers, underscores, and one dot (.).*

I cannot reproduce this on Opera 11.51, Build 1087, on Mac OS X 10.6.8 on flack notebook with the new tiny_mce 3.4.5.
Could you please try getting the tiny_mce upgrade from here:
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/tiny_mce-3.4.5.tar.bz
replace your `SAGE_ROOT/devel/....../sagenb/data/tiny_mce/` with the contents of this
archive, and try again?
