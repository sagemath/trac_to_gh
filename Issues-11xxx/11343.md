Please see below for what TinyMCE cells look like if you have an `@` in your username.  This is since at least 4.6, see [this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-notebook/browse_thread/thread/f0ceaa24700f4059).

I'm making this critical, because it removes major piece of functionality.  At the **very least**, we'll need to change the login page to remove the @ availability!!!

Re-enabling this is #11470.

From #8995, a dup of this: 


See the thread by Dennis Watson here:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_frm/thread/2acd499a566efce1

In particular, some tinymce javascript files were trying to download from a URL that included the username, like:

http://sagenb.org/home/usernamewith@/javascript/tiny_mce/langs/en.js

I'm looking into it now. You can try meanwhile using test.sagenb.org, which runs twisted 11.
I'll open a ticket for upgrading twisted to version 11 real soon...
The initial spkg and a patch to have it running on Rado's flack notebook is already on 
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/
and
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/patches/

no, I didn't.

I tried with stock  Firefox, and Chrome on MacOSX 10.6.8...
I cannot reproduce it; please state the browser, OS, (and medication ;-))  you are on.

I can reproduce it with the stock Safari on the said platform (this also is not working with the updated version of tiny-mce, locally). 

Oh well, we all but banned IE from using the nb, we should ban other closed-source browsers. I seldom use Safari nowadays. Safari sucks. So is IE. Don't use them for serious business.

I cannot reproduce this on Opera 11.51, Build 1087, on Mac OS X 10.6.8 on flack notebook with the new tiny_mce 3.4.5.
Could you please try getting the tiny_mce upgrade from here:
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/tiny_mce-3.4.5.tar.bz
replace your `SAGE_ROOT/devel/....../sagenb/data/tiny_mce/` with the contents of this

Which is precisely what [attachment:trac_11343-fix_at_symbol.patch] does.  I just checked and it still applies cleanly...  I just feel this is better than waiting eternally for the flask or TinyMCE update.

I really disagree that it's major and not blocker.   Sage doesn't work properly, and saying "use another browser" is going to keep on being said until we have zero browsers that support it.  If ppurka finds it doesn't work with FF or Opera with the new TinyMCE, and it doesn't work on Safari, and we already suggest (though nowhere official!!!) that IE is gone... should we be sending people to lynx?

So critical.  But if someone just reviews this patch, it fixes the problem, and that is better.  Plus it lights a fire under the flask/sagenb people to finish things off so we don't mess with things any more.
