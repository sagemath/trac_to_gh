Since we have the very nice fan morphism class, we should use it to define toric morphisms of toric varieties.

A big part of the patch is porting the scheme morphisms / hom sets to new-style parents and coercion. Categories should be better, too. Fixes #7946 and #6810 as a side effect.

The first two patches bring some sanity to the scheme morphisms. The 3rd patch changes names of methods/classes to something more reasonable and adds documentation. The 4th patch actually adds toric morphisms defined by polynomials or fan morphisms.

We should. I have been using the following code so far:

```
def toric_morphism_list(phi, X, Y):
    r"""
    Given a fan morphism phi from X.fan() -> Y.fan(), return the list representation of the corresponding toric morphism.
    """
    x = [SR.var(x_i, domain="positive") for x_i in X.coordinate_ring().variable_names()]
    result = [1] * Y.fan().nrays()
    for rho, x_rho in zip(X.fan(1), x):
        sigma_prime = phi.image_cone(rho)
        degrees = sigma_prime.ray_matrix() \ phi(rho.ray(0))
        for i, d in zip(sigma_prime.ambient_ray_indices(), degrees):
            result[i] *= x_rho^d
    return result

def toric_morphism_dictionary(phi, X, Y):
    r"""
    Given a fan morphism phi from X.fan() -> Y.fan(), return the dictionary representation of the corresponding toric morphism.
    """
    x = [SR.var(x_i, domain="positive") for x_i in X.coordinate_ring().variable_names()]
    y = [SR.var(y_i, domain="positive") for y_i in Y.coordinate_ring().variable_names()]
    result = dict((y_i, 1) for y_i in y)
    for rho, x_rho in zip(X.fan(1), x):
        sigma_prime = phi.image_cone(rho)
        degrees = sigma_prime.ray_matrix() \ phi(rho.ray(0))
        for i, d in zip(sigma_prime.ambient_ray_indices(), degrees):
            result[y[i]] *= x_rho^d
    return result
```
Using the dictionary representation it is quite easy to compute pullbacks, the problem here is that the underlying map of total coordinate rings is not a ring homomorphism, since it is likely to involve roots. The following paper may be useful for "correct and general" implementation:

 Since we have the very nice fan morphism class, we should use it to define toric morphisms of toric varieties.
 
-A big part of the patch is porting the scheme morphisms / hom sets to new-style parents and coercion. Categories should be better, too. Fixes #7946 as a side effect.
+A big part of the patch is porting the scheme morphisms / hom sets to new-style parents and coercion. Categories should be better, too. Fixes #7946 and #6810 as a side effect.
 
 The first two patches bring some sanity to the scheme morphisms. The 3rd patch changes names of methods/classes to something more reasonable and adds documentation. The 4th patch actually adds toric morphisms defined by polynomials or fan morphisms.

For the last patch:

1. In `schemes.rst` extra trailing spaces are added to one line (which I think was recently prohibited ;-)) and `toric_morphism` is added twice - probably it should be only once?
2. In `scheme.py` it adds `cached_method`, but it was already imported, so this hunk should not be there.
3. In `toric_homset.py`: I think that generic description should not be duplicated in the module docstring. On the other hand AUTHOURS, EXAMPLES and license sections should be added.
4. `__init__` in the beginning does not have a docstring at all. It would be nice also to add some clarifying comment what exactly is achieved by `register_conversion` there (although maybe I am supposed to know that?...)
5. In the example of `_element_constructor_` can we please not use `Hom` as the name for `dP8.Hom(P2)`? `Hom` is a top-level function and overwriting it is a bit confusing, especially since the example is quite long. How about just `H` instead?
6. In `_repr_defn` of toric morphism lines like "Defined by sending the Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N to Rational polyhedral fan in 1-d lattice N." are constructed.

Hi there,

It's cool to see thinks moving forward and the doc getting better. However
communication between developers could be better too. In this ticket, there is
a big chunk fixing the doc of `sage/structure/factory.pyx`. In my ticket,
improving `classcall` and `UniqueRepresentation`, I also discovered
that `sage/structure/factory.pyx` wasn't in the doc and that its doc was
broken. I didn't find any ticket that seems to fix it so I decided to go ahead
and spend on hour improving it... For nothing except creating a conflict.

Next time, please make such unrelated doctest improvements in a separate
ticket, and advertise them on trac!

Thanks,

Grumpy Florent
