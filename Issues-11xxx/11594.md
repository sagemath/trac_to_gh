Actual result:

```
sage: integrate(abs(x^2 - 1), x, -2, 2)
integrate(abs(x^2 - 1), x, -2, 2)
```

Expected result:

```
sage: integrate(x^2 - 1, x, -2, -1) + integrate(1 - x^2, x, -1, 1) + integrate(x^2 - 1, x, 1, 2)
4
```

If it's helpful, we can change the limits of integration to avoid the roots. This seems to appease the integrate function:

```
sage: integrate(x^2, x, -1, 1)
2/3
```

Depends on #11483

Not at all. I appreciate any effort in this direction. Please make sure that these are not duplicates of already existing tickets though. We started making a list of symbolics tickets on [this page](../wiki/symbolics). It should make it easier to check the new tickets (also #11591 and #11590) against existing ones.

I am at a conference right now and don't have much time for this.

Note that the patch attached to #8624 loads the `abs_integrate` package in maxima which might help with some of these issues involving `abs()`. Unfortunately that patch won't apply any more, since the maxima interface changed quite a bit during the switch to use libECL.

See #11483 for where that issue is currently standing.

I think that the OP meant the following (Maxima) in the last line:

```

(%i2) integrate(abs(x^2-1),x,-1,1);
                                       4
(%o2)                                  -
                                       3
```

This would indeed be fixed by the `abs_integrate` package.

```

(%i3) load(abs_integrate);
STYLE-WARNING: redefining SIMP-ISREAL-P in DEFUN
(%o3) /Users/.../maxima-5.24.0/share/contrib/integrat\

(%i4) integrate(abs(x^2-1),x,-2,2);
(%o4)                                  4
```
