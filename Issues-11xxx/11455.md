Apparently the Magma interface for number field elements doesn't work the way I thought it would:

```
sage: L.<s> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: m = magma(s)
sage: m.sage()
NameError: name 's' is not defined
```

```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: m = magma(i).sage(); m
I
sage: m.parent()
Symbolic Ring
sage: K(m)
TypeError: <type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```
Fraction fields are a problem too:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: y=x^2/x; y.parent()
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: m = magma(y)
sage: m.sage()
NameError: name 'x' is not defined
sage: (m.Numerator().sage()/m.Denominator().sage())
x
```

Replying to [@mstreng](#comment%3A6):
> Something is wrong

Here's the reason:

```
sage: K = QuadraticField(-1, 'i')
sage: L = NumberField(x^2+1, 'i')
sage: magma(K.gen()).sage() in K
False
sage: magma(K.gen()).sage() in L
True
sage: magma(L.gen()).sage() in K
False
sage: magma(L.gen()).sage() in L
True
sage: magma(L.gen()).sage() == magma(K.gen()).sage()
True
```
A field loses its embeddings when converted to Magma and back. A new patch is coming up.
