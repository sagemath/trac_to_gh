In `sage.rings.complex_number.ComplexNumber.__pow__??`

```

def __pow__(self, right, modulus):

    try:
        return (self.log()*right).exp()
    except TypeError:
        pass
```
makes it so that 

```
float(5)^(0.5+14.1347251*i)
```
doesn't work.  

This means plotting even `mpmath.li` for complex values with a lambda function won't work nicely.  

Depends on #24247

From a decade ago?

I am not sure.  I *think* I had attempted something like this directly, rather than parametrically.

```
import mpmath
parametric_plot((lambda t: mpmath.ei(log(20)*(0.5+i*RR(t))).real, lambda t: mpmath.ei(log(20)*(0.5+i*RR(t))).imag), (0,14.1), rgbcolor=hue(0.7), plot_points=300) + point((mpmath.ei(log(20)*(0.5+i*14.1)).real, mpmath.ei(log(20)*(0.5+i*14.1)).imag), color='red',size=20)
```
where I used that on this domain the log integral is the exp integral of the log and somehow that avoided the problem.

But I can't remember what exactly I tried that failed, because presumably I discarded it.  Sorry!

Should line 1695 `isinstance(right, (int, long, Integer))` be changed to `isinstance(right, (int, Integer))`, for python 3, or should it be left as is for backwards compatibility?

It's not hurting anything by being there, so I would say leave it since it is not related to this ticket. It might also matter for 16-bit machines since this is Cython code (I'm not 100% sure of this however).

LGTM.
