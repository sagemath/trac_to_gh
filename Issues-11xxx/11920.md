See #11226 and [http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48823](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48823).

For sympow, we need to use the compiler option `-ffp-contract=on`, `-mno-fused-madd` or `-ffloat-store` (if the compiler supports it).

Sympow should also create its datafiles, see #5155.

**spkg**: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/sympow-1.018.1.p11.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/sympow-1.018.1.p11.spkg)

With GCC versions prior to 4.6, you might have to specify e.g. `-fno-fused-madd` instead on some platforms, so you could also check whether that's supported and use it in case it is.

[Although it's not immediately clear to me whether that's desirable at all; with (fused) multiply-accumulate, the results are *more* accurate than without.  They'll of course frequently differ slightly from what you get *with* strict IEEE 754 compliance.]




`spkg-install`  should use `$MAKE` instead of `make`.

`$SAGE_LOCAL` should be quoted in the generated script.

There are a few typos in the comments, e.g. *"default mode of operat**ion**"* and   *"prec**is**ion"* (instead of *"precion"*).

FWIW, both with the p9 (with `-O3`, and **without** `-mno-fused-madd`, which is AFAIK the default) and with the p10 (with `-mno-fused-madd`) all (long) tests in

 `sage/lfunctions/sympow.py`

pass.  So you should probably change your check to detect whether the doubles are 64-bit / have a 53-bit mantissa.


Only the optional ones fail (differently); one has to compute extra data (with PARI/GP) for these anyway.  With the p10 I get:

New spkg, builds correctly on `silius`, both with gcc 4.6.1 and with gcc 4.3.4.  Needs review.

The new spkg does give harmless deprecation warnings on newer gcc versions.  Should I add the flag `-Wno-deprecated`?

Why?  Because upstream died and nobody is going to fix the code?

Well, in addition to the platforms where Sympow previously *caused* trouble (those with [optional] non-standard floating-point and/or MAC/FMA instructions), the new spkg should also (still) work on more common platforms, so testing it on the latter doesn't hurt either.

Perhaps you could give more details w.r.t. the processor and your Ubuntu version; GCC 4.3.3 smells like Ubuntu 9.04.  Otherwise -- if your time allows -- you could run a full test (`ptestlong`) with a recent Sage version and the new spkg here.

According to `deps`, only the Sage library depends on Sympow, so you don't have to rebuild any other spkgs.  (You could do a `./sage -ba-force` after installing the new spkg, but this shouldn't be necessary.)




I don't think there's anything we (at least me) could or should ask Mark, but Jeroen will know better.

Doesn't really surprise me... ;-)


At least target `all` (which is the real root of the dependency graph) depends on Sympow, and the Sage library *does use* the Sympow executable, so could or *should*<sup>TM</sup> depend on it (although there's no need to rebuild the library upon a change/update of Sympow, but `sage -b` usually doesn't do much anyway).

True, no package depends on Sympow and the Sage library doesn't depend on Sympow in the sense that building it (`./sage -b`) doesn't need Sympow.  But of course, the Sage runtime needs Sympow.

At first glance looks ok, modulo some cosmetic inconsistencies and the like (in `spkg-install`):

* Indentation
* "Sympow" vs. "sympow" vs. "SYMPOW"; `SPKG.txt` (mostly) uses the latter.
* Not all error messages are redirected to stderr.
* Some error messages don't start with "`Error`" (and don't contain the word elsewhere).
* Superfluous `if [ -d $FOO ]; then rm -rf $FOO; fi` (instead of just `rm -rf $FOO`) etc.
* The viral trailing semicolon in

```sh
   echo "SAGE_LOCAL undefined ... exiting";
```
* A few typos (either *"[fused] multiply-a**d**d instructions"* or *"multiply-and**-add**..."* -- also without a hyphen before *"instructions"*; *"almost surely on a**n** x86 system"*, ...?)

A little more relevant:

* To go triple safe, you could add `-fno-fast-math` to your `FLAG` list.
* `$SCRIPT` (which contains `$SAGE_LOCAL`) should be quoted near the end of `spkg-install`; perhaps also `$file`, which in contrast just depends on Sympow['s data file names], not a user setting.
* The generated script should perhaps test `$SAGE_LOCAL` to give a meaningful error message in case it is undefined.
* `if [ ! -f "$TARGET/sympow" ] ...` could be `if [ ! -x "$TARGET/sympow" ] ...`.




I cannot (re)test this much; will probably do on cleo, perhaps silius, and some "unaffected" systems; interesting would also be newer Intel CPUs with AVX, although the early Sandy Bridges (for example) do not support multiply-accumulate IIRC.

I also haven't looked at the new C code recently, assuming it hasn't changed since I last did (a few month ago).

```

I think older GCCs (>= 4.0.1 or 4.2.1) should be supported as well, especially on platforms like this.  Haven't tracked down what exactly goes wrong...




Ooops, just noticed John C. infected me: Ignore the prompt / directory name -- it's of course GCC **4.1.2**, not 4.2.1.  Do we want to support this version (on Itanium)?

No.

I think libquadmath does something different from SYMPOW's "quad double".  libquadmath implements [Quadruple precision numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadruple_precision) (113 bits) whereas SYMPOW's quad double implements something like 4*53 = 212 bits of precision.

Anyway, I don't think it's that troublesome, once you understand that it needs IEEE-compliants doubles.

Thanks for the review!
