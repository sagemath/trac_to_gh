This patch provides an implementation of the subword complex:

Fix a Coxeter system (W,S). Let Q = be a finite word in S and pi in W.

The subword complex Delta(Q,pi) is then defined to be the simplicial complex with vertices being {0,...,n-1}, (n = len(Q), one vertex for each letter in Q) and with facets given by all (indices of) subwords Q' of Q for which Q\Q' is a reduced expression for pi.

```
    sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['A',2],index_set=[1,2])
    sage: w = W.from_reduced_word([1,2,1])
    sage: C = SubwordComplex([2,1,2,1,2],w); C
    Subword complex of type ['A', 2] for Q = [2, 1, 2, 1, 2] and pi = 121
    sage: C.facets()
    {(1, 2), (3, 4), (0, 4), (2, 3), (0, 1)}
```

**Keywords:** subword complex, simplicial complex

Replying to [@fchapoton](#comment%3A6):

Okay, I must confess that I tend to not finish implementations once the patch does what I want it to do...

The dependencies of this patch must (unfortunately) inherit as well the dependencies of #11122. This is to say that this patch actually relies on many things implemented in #11187.

I would be very, very glad if anyone would finally start reviewing the universal cyclotomic field, #8327 on which #11187 depends (I would first need to rebase it, and make sure that the trac version is updated to the newest version on the combinat queue).

Cheers, Christian

Hello Christian, do you really think that this ticket depends on #11187 ?

I am tempted to ressurect this one, without waiting for the famous category-and-axiom ticket.

With not so much work, I managed to get a branch with only 19 failures.

I am removing the dependencies to #11187, #15456 as I think they are not really needed.

There are still 16 failing doctests. Work in progress.

Dear Frederic,

Thanks for your work on that -- I am super busy with other stuff, hopefully this will get better in about 4 weeks from now.

I am not sure if I/we should keep the construction for positive genus:
- Mathematically, this has not been considered before,

- it is not quite the right generalization of subword complexes as defined by Knutson-Miller. In particular, such complexes do not need to be vertex-decomposable or shellable.

- we have a proper generalization which will have similar combinatorics and will capture the needed behaviour for positive genus

- our paper in which I introduce these things is still on hold and we will need at least another 3-6 months before getting this into a state to make it publicly available

I should be able to quickly look at your branch during the weekend to clean things up a bit. Or do you prefer to work things out yourself?

Cheers, Christian

Hello Christian,

I would be happy to see you come back here. The code is not very easy to understand by me alone.

The remaining issues (15 doctests) seem to be related to a strange use of roots, where Weyl group elements seem to be supposed to act on the indices of roots in the list of roots. And they do not, of course.

I will not do anything more on the ticket until next week.

Hi,

> I would be happy to see you come back here. The code is not very easy to understand by me alone.

I spend some time today trying to get Sage working properly again, but I failed so far. I guess I need someone helping me to work properly with git...

* I upgraded Sage using http://wiki.sagemath.org/TentativeConventions#Get_the_latest_official_development_version_of_Sage, but I got an error ```error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status```, so this is my first problem

I don't know how to resolve that now (and I also don't know if I tried to upgrade to the newest development version or the latest stable version).

> The remaining issues (15 doctests) seem to be related to a strange use of roots, where Weyl group elements seem to be supposed to act on the indices of roots in the list of roots. And they do not, of course.

I use the CHEVIE implementation of finite reflection groups which are implemented as permutation groups on indices of roots. This speed things drastically, but it is not reall mathematically clean. Moreover, I just looked at the code, and

* I also pushed many non-features that are there only for my research (and for which I cannot prove what I want to prove)
* Many features only make sense for finite Coxeter groups, so such checks are still to be implemented.

Hello Frederic,

I now spent some time playing with the patch.

My main concern is: I can re-implement things to work with any implementation of Coxeter groups (i.e., with the current implementations of Weyl groups and Coxeter groups). BUT: this will slow down things drastically!

So we either leave this ticket open and wait for my CHEVIE version of Coxeter groups, 
#11187 (I am not too positive that these will make it into Sage this year though), or we get rid of the speedy implementations and have a slow version to play in very low ranks that can be used soon.

Cheers, Christian

I have made a new branch, by disentangling u/vpilaud/ticket/11010 from #11187 (but sadly still depending on #11187).

It seems that all my previous work on this ticket was lost. I do not appreciate.

Sorry for having been a little rude. I was tired and angry yesterday evening.

It remains that I have done twice the same clean-up work. I think it was
because the branch by Vincent was not based on my previous branch.

I would really like if this ticket would no longer depend on #11187, which has
no hope to enter sage as long as it depends on gap3.

You said once that it could be possible, but with a high speed penalty. Maybe this is nevertheless the way to go.

<a id='comment:36'>**Comment 36:**</a>
As far as I can see, just one thing is needed:

- `reflections()` (technically `nr_reflections()`, but we can just do `len(self.reflections())`)

We can construct this easily enough by conjugation of simple reflections:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['A',2])
sage: S = W.simple_reflections()
sage: I = W.index_set()
sage: R = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet(S, lambda x: [S[i]*x*S[i] for i in I if not x.has_descent(i)], structure="graded")
sage: list(R)
[
[-1  1]  [ 1  0]  [ 0 -1]
[ 0  1], [ 1 -1], [-1  0]
]
sage: all(x.absolute_length() for x in R)
True
```

The `apply_simple_reflection` is already a part of Sage for Coxeter groups.

Aside - This probably deserves to be in the category of finite Coxeter groups, but there is some slight conflict with this

```
sage: W = WeylGroup(['A',2], prefix='s')
sage: W.reflections()
Finite family {s1*s2*s1: (1, 0, -1), s1: (1, -1, 0), s2: (0, 1, -1)}
```
(Trying to do this on the Weyl group on the root system seems to run forever and `ctrl-C` out results in a nasty error message.)

Ok, guys. We are **almost there**. Most of the things are working and hopefully not too slow. I have worked hard for two days, so please react !

Just 2 small remaining problems (unless the bot reveals some others):

* the "plot" code is broken, maybe we can remove that for the moment ? unless somebody wants to repair it ?
* the "root_polytope" method is not documented, any objection to its removal ? unless you can provide a working example ?

cheers,

Frederic

Okay, things seem to work, great!

* Root polytope: all this patch was basically parked on trac for my own research. And this method is stuff for which nothing is proven so far, so it should not be part of the ticket anymore.

* Plot: what do you have in mind outside of types A and B?

* Here are a few timings:

  This patch:

```
sage: W = WeylGroup(['A',6])
sage: c = list(W.index_set()); Q = c + W.w0.coxeter_sorting_word(c)
sage: %time S = SubwordComplex(Q,W.w0)
CPU times: user 23.6 s, sys: 36 ms, total: 23.6 s
Wall time: 23.6 s
sage: len(S)
429
```
  The same patch based on the Coxeter group implementation:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['A',6])                                    
sage: c = list(W.index_set()); Q = c + W.w0.coxeter_sorting_word(c)
sage: %time S = SubwordComplex(Q,W.w0)                             
CPU times: user 0.41 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.41 s
Wall time: 0.41 s
sage: len(S)                                                       
429
```

I think one should put a large **Warning** about

`To be used only with Coxeter groups in the implementation='reflection'`

In fact, it is not only slow but mostly broken with Weyl groups.

Side remark : it seems that one cannot use the quadratic fields Q(sqrt2) for type B
and Q(sqrt5) for type H. To be fixed in another ticket, maybe.

Oh yes, the doctests were written for `implementation='reflection'` so it does not show that it is broken for Weyl groups.

I will have a quick look whether I can fix that!

New branch, where I have added a warning.

Do you really want this to work for Weyl groups ?

You can build roots for Weyl groups just as I did for the Coxeter groups, using a reduced word for w0. But it will not be enough..

You can use the (relatively recent) Coxeter matrices and types:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['C',4])
sage: T = W.coxeter_matrix().coxeter_type(); T
Coxeter type of ['C', 4]
```
The current implementation for Coxeter types essentially wraps the Cartan types, so there is a "different" type for B and C. (This was done because there was a lot of information that could be pulled from the Cartan type, as there is a lot of hard-coded data, and I didn't want to have to try and decide on a naming scheme. I fully take the blame for the hacks involved.)

However, the information you're after is inside the wrapped type:

```
sage: T.cartan_type()
['B', 4]
sage: T.cartan_type().type()
'B'
sage: T.cartan_type().rank()
4
```

I am rather confused now:
* First Sage start

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['B',4])
sage: W.coxeter_matrix().coxeter_type()
Coxeter type of ['B', 4]
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['C',4])
sage: W.coxeter_matrix().coxeter_type()
Coxeter type of ['B', 4]
```
* Second Sage start

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['C',4])
sage: W.coxeter_matrix().coxeter_type()
Coxeter type of ['C', 4]
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['B',4])
sage: W.coxeter_matrix().coxeter_type()
Coxeter type of ['C', 4]
```
In particular, the root systems `W.roots()` are not correct in the two second calls of `CoxeterGroup`.

Also, the plotting now assumes that the first index is the type B/C special one. This is, it is expected that

```
sage: s0 = W.simple_reflection(W.index-set()[0])
sage: s1 = W.simple_reflection(W.index-set()[1])
sage: (s0*s1).order()
4
```
I doubt that this is correct in the current implementation of `Coxeter groups` where the last index is expected to be special. If so, I will add some magic to figure out the proper labelling...
