In the following calculation, Sage4.6.2 returns the opposite of the right result :

```
sage: var('a t')
(a, t)
sage: assume(a>0)
sage: assume(x>0)
sage: f = integrate(log(1+a/(x * t)^2), t, 1, oo)
sage: f
(sqrt(a)*x*log((x^2 + a)/x^2) - 2*a*arctan(sqrt(a)/x))/(sqrt(a)*x)
sage: f.subs(x=1, a=7).n()
-4.32025625668262
```

For information, Sage 4.6 gives the right result :

```
sage: var('a t')
(a, t)
sage: assume(a>0)
sage: assume(x>0)
sage: f = integrate(log(1+a/(x * t)^2), t, 1, oo)
sage: f
pi*sqrt(a)/x - (x*log((x2 + a)/x2) + 2*sqrt(a)*arctan(x/sqrt(a)))/x
sage: f.subs(x=1, a=7).n()
4.32025625668262
```

For information, Maple9 gives this :

```
> assume(a>0): assume(x>0):
> f := int(ln(1+a/(x * t)^2), t=1..infinity):
> lprint(f);
(2*ln(x)*x-2*a^(1/2)*arctan(x/a^(1/2))-ln(x^2+a)*x+a^(1/2)*Pi)/x

I can confirm this in Maxima 5.24.0:

```

Looks like a different branch of log is being used.  Also for comparison, here is what GSL says:

```
sage: numerical_integral(log(1+7/(x^2)),1,oo)
(4.3202562566855764, 2.2384237933839469e-07)
```
We should file something with the Maxima tracker.
