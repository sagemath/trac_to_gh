This patch implements reflection groups to work with finite (crystallographic, real, complex) reflection groups. It is based on the GAP3 package **chevie** which is now an experimental package, see #20107.

```
sage: W = ReflectionGroup(['A',2],5,23); W
Reducible complex reflection group of rank 7 and type A2 x ST5 x H3
sage: W.irreducible_components()
[Irreducible real reflection group of rank 2 and type A2,
 Irreducible complex reflection group of rank 2 and type ST5,
 Irreducible real reflection group of rank 3 and type H3]
```

I always made some minor changes on this patch locally - I would actually only start working on this patch after you guys are finished with #10963. If you want to actively work on this patch, ping me again, and we can discuss what is still needed to finilize this patch.

No, I don't. But I have a local old version of Sage containing that code and quite a bit more, so I wonder if I should/will try to organize it a bit and put it up here.

Do you need any from that code in particular (in which case I am more tempted to work on that), or is that just a general question?

<a id='comment:49'></a>After discussion with Christian, the iterator of a complex reflection group is a lot faster. What we did was to keep `._reduced_word` as a list, and only transform it into an actual word when needed (i.e., in the `.reduced_word()` method).

Before:

```
sage: G = ComplexReflectionGroup([2,1,4])
sage: %timeit L = list(G); G._elements=None
The slowest run took 6.02 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1 loops, best of 3: 66.4 ms per loop
```
After:

```
sage: G = ComplexReflectionGroup([2,1,4])
sage: %timeit L = list(G); G._elements=None
The slowest run took 66.44 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1 loops, best of 3: 5.56 ms per loop

<a id='comment:53'></a>Hi Christian,

This is not how the tests work:

```python
                def _test_well_generated(self, **options):
                    tester = self._tester(**options)
                    return self.is_well_generated()
```
Instead, do

```python
                def _test_well_generated(self, **options):
                    tester = self._tester(**options)
                    tester.assert_(self.is_well_generated())
```
or something similar.

<a id='comment:86'></a>Hello Christian,
thanks for your hard work on this ticket. I have only had a quick look, so trivial remarks:
* not yet 100% coverage, I think (I have seen a few methods without examples)
* `TODO::` should be `.. TODO::`
* Could you please replace `Returns` by `Return` everywhere.
* Sometime the first line of the doc is made of two sentences. Please separate them as:

```
Return something.

Something is very very important.
```
* Please try to keep the lines 80 characters long.
* Bad alignement of EXAMPLES:: in `distinguished_reflection`, `distinguished_reflections`
* missing optional in `sage: W = CoxeterGroup(["A",4], implementation="chevie")`

And you should aim to have a green light from the patchbot. So far, this has **never** been the case.

I am aware of the stuff to do in the documentation, but before getting there (or, at least, in parallel, I'll fix your complaints now), I try to get the overall setting right (this includes the category framework, the interaction with other reflection group classes, and the dependence of chevie).

I'd like to get it green, but it has not run in 5 days, and I can only fix stuff the patchbot complaints about if I see its results regularly after uploading a new commit sequence (a patchbot that doesn't run soon after uploading doesn't really help during a coding sprint)...

<a id='comment:93'></a>I have Gap3/Chevie installed now.

It's probably easier (and a lot faster) to run

`./sage -t ./src/sage/combinat/root_system/reflection_group_complex.py` ,

and if things are crashing and you need to see where, then do

`./sage -t --verbose ./src/sage/combinat/root_system/reflection_group_complex.py` .

Patchbots are good for finding merge conflicts with new betas and seeing if you unintentionally broke other parts of Sage, but at this point I think it's sufficient to only test the one file you're changing with this ticket.

Every test (except for the creation of the category of complex reflection groups) handle with reflection groups (no surprise), and even initializing such a group requires `chevie`.

But within finite time, I will work on making some core functionalities work without having `chevie` installed.

> They would be run if the Sage optional package `chevie` is installed. However, such a package does not exist.


Is that a problem? Should there be a possibility of installing `chevie` as an optional package? I update the description of this ticket to explain how to get chevie installed in a system. See #8906 for old stuff about that.

I wouldn't think this is superhard to make an optional package as discussed at #8906.

This computation is currently done purely in my code, and it's not related to `chevie`. The iterator comes from `_iterator_tracking_words` so let's see what happens there.

Related here, and indeed also to your question on `long_element`, observe that currently

```
sage: W = ReflectionGroup(23); W
Irreducible complex reflection group of rank 3 and type H3
sage: W.category()
Join of Category of finite permutation groups and Category of irreducible finite coxeter groups
sage: W = ReflectionGroup(['H',3]); W
Irreducible real reflection group of rank 3 and type H3
sage: W.category()
Join of Category of finite permutation groups and Category of irreducible finite coxeter groups
```

Since the iter algorithm for coxeter groups is slightly smarter (it takes into account that the weak order is graded), the two iter functions are different.

But:

* both iter functions are supposed to return the same iteration through the group
* both iter functions should always return the elements in the very same order (in contrary to what we see on my vs on your machine)

I found a bug (having a `set` rather than a `list` in one spot), so let's see if this is fixed with my next push in a few minutes after all tests pass here.

> Unrelated, but I also can't get the long_element() method to work.


The reason is, that you constructed the real group as a complex group, so the long element for `ReflectionGroup(['H',3])` works while it currently doesn't work for `ReflectionGroup(23)`. I do have to fix that and be more careful constructing the right class instance.

This will have the more serious use case I know of (the code in the generic Coxeter groups iterator, e.g., via `CoxeterGroup`, has not had any serious optimization attempts AFAIK).

Our current test cases are B<sub>6</sub> (~0.5s) and E<sub>7</sub> (~1m).

One of the thoughts I'm bouncing around is doing a full C/C++ version using arrays, and then using Cython (mainly `PermutationGroupElement`) as a transfer layer to Sage/GAP. In which case it probably should be split off as a little specialized spkg.

That is quite an impressive speedup. I know a little bit about build systems (and its on my todo to learn more for fixing up coxeter3/LiE too), but, e.g., Jeroen or François are good people to ask. Although if you need GCC 5.x, then we will need to do some changes to Sage. Yet, I think moving to GCC 5.x is something that we want and are going to do soon...

<a id='comment:9'></a>For the record: as discussed last night, the first goal would be to separate the category stuff into its own ticket (`@`tscim is working on this), and then to get the present version well documented, tested, and finished. Only after this work is done, we will start improving stuff and add functionality.

To this end, we have to:
* get the category stuff right
* test properly that reducible groups work as desired
* test properly that the labelling system of simples/hyperplanes/reflections works properly
* test that the assumptions on how we obtain the data from chevie is correct (one example here is that the code tries to get n simple reflections, N* distinguished reflections, and then the remaining (N-N*) other reflections when listing all reflections. This has to be rechecked, but there are plenty of more similar examples.

My guess is because Cython is smart enough to translate

```python
for i in range(n)
```
into

```c
for(i=0; i<n; ++i)
```
whereas for the other, it is iterating over some object (which, a priori, may not even be iterable). In more detail, Cython doesn't even know that it is iterating over a list, just that `self.noncom` is. Try:

```python
        nc = self.noncom[first]
        for i in nc:
```
or the variant

```python
        nc = self.noncom[first]
        k = len(nc)
        for dummy in range(k):
            i = nc[dummy]
```
where you have `cdef list nc` and `cdef int dummy, k` (although I suspect the former of these is faster).

This doesn't make sense. If anything `reduced_word()` will throw an error if `_reduced_word` was done by the `lazy_attribute`. The iterator overwrites (the lazy attribute) `_reduced_word` if the word comes from there, so it does not get computed twice. Otherwise it was a user created word and will never be identical (not just equals) to an element created from the iterator.

This is what I would do. Although we might be better off just doing our own implementation using a list (which we mutate) and starting with `self.domain()`.

How much additional code would it take to make it work on both sides, allowing the user to do `ReflectionGroup(..., action="right")`?

I was afraid you'd ask that. in my eyes: too much. The elements are considered as permutations, words, and matrices at the same time (and there are even two types of words, in simples and in all reflections, and the simple words have wired properties in the non-real case), making options would pollute the code just soo much, I think, and would introduce so many possible mistakes. I prefer to have clean and fast code, that is hopefully getting better than chevie, eventually. Once that is achieved, I am getting in favour with adding another layer of user friendliness.

Fair enough: let's focus on getting things to work.

One thing though is that a lot of features are completely symmetric
(e.g. the reverse of a word is a word). The only spot where things
differ is when there is an explicit action. In my experience when
implementing representations of semigroups, it was often possible to
abstracted everything out by manipulating elements in the code as
functions whenever there is an action involved (sorry, I know, this is
a big vague).

Of course, a prerequisite for implementing this seamlessly is that
permutation groups themselves would allow for both left and right
actions.

Cheers,
                                        Nicolas
