I modified ComplexPlot to be more flexible and modular. The __init__ method now takes rgb_data instead of z_values as input. This permits users to decide how they want to represent their complex data. Adjustments have been made to both RiemannMap.plot_colored and complex_plot.

I also removed the now-redundant ColorPlot from riemann.pyx.

Will we need to introduce a deprecation period for the change to initializing with `complex_to_rgb(z_values)`, since the keyword has changed?

Also, what is the situation with the `complex_to_rgb` functions?  By that I mean to ask how many of them there are, and why there is a separate one in riemann.pyx.

With respect to #10945, please also make sure that the (better) docs you had for ColorPlot are transferred to ComplexPlot; we definitely wouldn't want to lose them!

To be more precise about `complex_to_rgb`, there should probably only be one of them, it should probably be in the complex plot place as importing it once (or cimporting?) shouldn't cause any noticeable slowdown (though you may want to check that), and there is no reason *not* to use the efficiencies you have introduced in that final version :)

Hmm, I just seem to remember that you had added some detail for ColorPlot that wasn't in the ComplexPlot documentation.  If they are identical, then I must have been wrong.  If not, might as well add it, since it helps!  Or helped me.

A few thoughts:
* In the first example you move up your definition of `f` and `fprime`.  But then you define them again.  The definitions of `f` and `fprime` in the second example can probably be omitted, right?
* Good catch on the `hf`s that should have been `fprime`s.
* I think that the change to ComplexPlot is a good one, except it is now no longer a complex plot!  Now it really is a 'color plot', by initialization!  So it allows users how to decide how to represent their data, as you say - but complex or otherwise.  Maybe you should make the ColorPlot the main method, and then let a ComplexPlot be the initialization of this with zvalues instead of the color array.
* I understand the two different `mag_to_lightness` functions.  I still don't understand the difference between the two `complex_to_rgb` functions.  What is it?

So 'needs info', at least.  These are all meta-issues in some way.  The details seem fine!  (Haven't actually applied or run tests, as I'm currently doing so with a different big job - but I have few doubts on that score.)

Replying to [evanandel](#comment%3A11):
>  * Those redefinitions could be omitted, but I generally think that it makes it more readable for each example section to define its functions unless it's very time or space consuming. If that violates a sage convention though, it can certainly be changed.
 
Ok.
>  * It may make more sense to put ColorPlot as the main method. If that is the case, however, then it seems like color plot should be given its own module (it certainly doesn't belong in complex_plot) and then perhaps complex_plot() should move elsewhere since it's not apparent that it needs a whole module for just a couple functions. If that is the case though, that seems like a refactoring decision that is above my (hypothetical) pay grade. If it turns out to be complicated, it might be better just to let this patch go through and deal with that question separately.
 
Well, that's true.

Yes.

So I'll try to review this, and then finish #11273.

It turns out those test failures were because riemann's complex_to_rgb is cdefed and therefore not importable for outside modules. I fixed that changing it to a cpdef. 

I'm not sure if I just didn't catch those failures before, or if something changed to make it a problem. Regardless, it should work now.
