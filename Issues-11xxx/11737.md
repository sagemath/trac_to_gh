This is in Maxima.  In the latest:

```

(%i1) integrate(sin(x^2)/(x^2),x,1,inf);

defint: integral is divergent.
```
It used to just return the integral.

```

(%i1) integrate(sin(x^2)/(x^2),x,1,inf);
                                 inf
                                /         2
                                [    sin(x )
(%o1)                           I    ------- dx
                                ]       2
                                /      x
                                 1
```

I think this integral should converge, right?  By the p-test (well, with absolute values) for p=2?  And `numerical_integral` agrees with your thing.  This is probably a bug in Maxima, I'll put it there.
