```
sage: N(integrate(sin(x^2)/(x^2), x, 1, infinity))
[...]
ValueError: Integral is divergent.
```
This worked fine until v4.5.3, fails from v4.6.1 onward.
The expected output (with Maxima 5.29.1) is:

```
0.285736646322858
```

Depends on #13364

Upstream: **Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.**

Component: **calculus**

This is in Maxima.  In the latest:

```

(%i1) integrate(sin(x^2)/(x^2),x,1,inf);

defint: integral is divergent.
```
It used to just return the integral.

```

(%i1) integrate(sin(x^2)/(x^2),x,1,inf);
                                 inf
                                /         2
                                [    sin(x )
(%o1)                           I    ------- dx
                                ]       2
                                /      x
                                 1
```

I think this integral should converge, right?  By the p-test (well, with absolute values) for p=2?  And `numerical_integral` agrees with your thing.  This is probably a bug in Maxima, I'll put it there.
