The Developer's Guide, in the section "Doctesting the Sage Library", in the subsection "Beyond the Sage Library", has the following sentence: "The doctesting scripts of a Sage installation currently have limited support for doctesting of modules outside of *that* Sage library."

I believe it should read "...outside of the Sage library".
