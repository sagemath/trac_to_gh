Currently sage rejects to produce the global minimal Weierstrass equation when the class number is not 1. For instance, this produces an error:

``` 
sage: K.<t> = QuadraticField(-5)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K, [0,-1,1,-10,-20])
sage: E.global_minimal_model()
```      

Keywords: **global minimal model**
