Currently sage rejects to produce the global minimal Weierstrass equation when the class number is not 1. For instance, this produces an error:

``` 
sage: K.<t> = QuadraticField(-5)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K, [0,-1,1,-10,-20])
sage: E.global_minimal_model()
```

I know.  It has long been on my to-do list to implement a test for existence of a minimal model and give it if it exists.  I convinced myself that this would be easy....
