Right now example code has to be in \begin{verbatim}/\end{verbatim} blocks.  However, lstlisting looks much better.  With this patch one can write latex documents and have "sage -t" work on them, if they use one or the other type of blocks.

It's probably not optimal -- it would be better to maybe make this customizable or something.  I don't know.
