"caching" patch rearranges the code to do (what I think is) the minimum possible to determine the pivoting strategy, and *then* goes to check the cache.  It fixes the problems with the old 'auto' strategy parameter.

Original version of this code used things like "add_multiple_of_row()".  It proved faster to use the "unsafe" methods down in the heart of the nested loops.
