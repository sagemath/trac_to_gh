This is an optimized implementation of the LU decomposition.  It runs at about twice the speed of the generic echelon form routine (as theory predicts), so with backsubstitution it might be the basis for a faster solver for systems of linear equations over certain fields.

You also might want to try to use add_multiple_of_row to make the implementation either faster or more readable. Not sure whether you have already considered this, but it could be worth a try.

"caching" patch rearranges the code to do (what I think is) the minimum possible to determine the pivoting strategy, and *then* goes to check the cache.  It fixes the problems with the old 'auto' strategy parameter.

Original version of this code used things like "add_multiple_of_row()".  It proved faster to use the "unsafe" methods down in the heart of the nested loops.
