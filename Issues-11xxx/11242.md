I found this build failure with sage 4.6.2 on Ubuntu 11.04 64bit beta2. I believe it affects all sage versions, all arches, on Ubuntu 11.04 and higher.

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/593b9a4124f5075d

Report upstream: Ubuntu already patch their python as I propose to patch the sage python with one line to build the crypt module with -lcrypt. Upstream python does not build on Ubuntu without this patch, and this one line suffices. Upstream python says this is because Ubuntu 11.04 introduced some multiarch support. More details in the google thread and the python bug referred to in that thread.

changelog

This needs testing on other releases, distros, and OSes. If it breaks building on other systems a specific check for Ubuntu can be added with [ "x`lsb_release -d`" == "xDescription: Ubuntu 11.04" (after 1 May 2011 when this release is out). Then the patch can only be applied for that specific version of Ubuntu. 

This spkg can be tested with sage -f python-2.6.4.p10.spkg.
Revert with cd SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard; sage -f python-2.6.4.p9.spkg.

The error is obvious -- both in the python install log and when starting sage import crypt fails.

**Assignee:** GeorgSWeber

**Keywords:** python crypt natty

**Reviewer:** Jan Groenewald, Leif Leonhardy

**Upstream:** None of the above - read trac for reasoning.
