Apparently the fix is to

```
Add "#include <time.h>" to src/Singular/Minor.h the in the Singular spkg 
```
I think this fix is due to Mike Hansen, cf. http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/wiki/CygwinPort?version=56

I have no idea whether the upstream has moved on this.

It's true that this Cygwin doesn't (yet) have ncurses, though it has libncurses.  But I don't remember this ever being a prerequisite for Sage, and am hesitant to insert it without knowing whether this is actually an upstream bug.  My Macs build Singular fine and don't even have this (one has ncurses-config).  They do both have libncurses, but then again so does this Cygwin!

Now I see that at #6743 and #7005 apparently Singular did at one point need libncurses-devel.  I don't know whether my XP has that or not.

Another possibly related ticket is #10235.

Are you sure that unconditional 

```
#include <time.h>
```
would work everywhere?

I would rather do 

```
#ifdef CYGWIN
#include <time.h>
#endif
```

I just realized this whole discussion about variables is a red herring.  In the spkg-install, we have

```
    if [ "$UNAME" = "CYGWIN" ]; then
        # Fine to make this patch on any system, because it is code that is onl$
        cp patches/sing_win.cc src/Singular/
        cp patches/IntegerProgramming-Makefile.in src/IntegerProgramming/Makefi$
        cp patches/Minor.h src/Singular/
    fi
```
which includes our patch.

Compare the relevant part of the diff:

```diff
diff -r 0825382212aa spkg-install
a	 b	 
114	114	        # Fine to make this patch on any system, because it is code that is only compiled on Windows. 
115	115	        cp patches/sing_win.cc src/Singular/ 
116	116	        cp patches/IntegerProgramming-Makefile.in src/IntegerProgramming/Makefile.in 
 	117	        cp patches/Minor.h src/Singular/ 
117	118	    fi 
118	119	 
119	120	    # parallel build patches 
```
so I see why it was confusing!  But even with the comment (legacy comment, not mine), this is still all just included on Cygwin.

It's possible.  The reason Minor.h required this is because the command `time` is used in Minor.cc

```
void MinorValue::SetRankingStrategy (const int rankingStrategy)
{
  g_rankingStrategy = rankingStrategy;
  if (g_rankingStrategy == 6)
  {
    /* initialize the random generator with system time */
    srand ( time(NULL) );
  }
}
```

by reading
http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/WINDOWS/index_all.html
one gets an impression that Singular 3.1.1 is running under Cygwin just fine, as it is a Cygwin package.
So I don't see much need to report anything.

We have a witness, Your Honor... :-)

I don't know how to access the Cygwin sources 3.1.1 for the "native Cygwin" Singular; indeed, http://cygwin.com/packages/singular-base/ lists only 3.1.2 and 3.1.3.
I think the point of talking to Singular people about 3.1.1 is moot.

When Sage is upgraded to the next Singular release, it's certainly makes sense to investigate, and perhaps even use the "native" Singular rather than the one supplied by Sage.

Several, in fact.  And at any rate time is used in the relevant place.

Yes, this probably belongs wherever Volker is attaching his spkg in earlier comments.   Perhaps this isn't an issue with newer Singular, but no need to try to upgrade Singular just to fix this.

Note that Jeroen has meanwhile created **a new, different p10 based on the p9**, since #11663 was marked a blocker for 4.7.**1** (and your p10 had previously been merged into some 4.7.2 alpha).

So you should create a new **p11** for *this ticket*, based on Jeroen's p10.

This spkg also resolve #10235, should be an easy review there.

Is there anything else that needs to be done to review this one?  The changes are exactly the same, except I added a comment about #10235.

Unfortunately Jeroen's p10 needs work again, as it doesn't fix the issue as is.

See comment there.

Well, just make sure it doesn't revert anything else, e.g. changes made in the p10, but see above.

But as soon as Jeroen's spkg has positive review, you should be able to just apply your patch on top of Jeroen's p10 to create your p11.

`.hgtags` is a plain text file, i.e. you can simply edit it.

You usually just do `hg tag <name>` when you've finished a new patch level (revision), otherwise you can use `hg tag -r <revision number> <name>` to tag an older changeset / revision afterwards. `hg help tag` shows further options.

Hmm, I thought it was more mysterious than that.  So it's just an arbitrary way to mark stopping points, not really anything else.  Interesting that these have to be committed.

Well, `.hgtags` is (or should be) under revision control, but `hg tag ...` automatically commits.

The tags just create aliases for revision numbers or changesets, i.e. you can then for example do

```sh
hg diff -r singular-3-1-1-4.p9 -r singular-3-1-1-4.p12
```
to get the (cumulative) changes between these two spkgs / patch levels.

Thanks.  Before, I didn't know enough HG to care about this, but now it seems useful. 

But perhaps this is OT for this ticket :)
