Ahem, what if Sage doesn't start?  Then we get no date...

So you could either do something like

```sh
echo "[`date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`]" \
     "`sage --version | sed -n -e '/Version/s/^[ |]\+//;s/[ |]\+$//p'`." \
    | tee -a "$SAGE_ROOT"/start.log

spkg/pipestatus "sage -c \"print 'Yes, Sage starts.'\" 2>&1" "tee -a '$SAGE_ROOT'/start.log"
```
or, directly,

```sh
echo "[`date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`]" \
     "`sed -n -e '/Version/s/^[ |]\+//;/Version/s/[ |]\+$//p' "$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin/sage-banner`." \
    | tee -a "$SAGE_ROOT"/start.log

spkg/pipestatus "sage -c \"print 'Yes, Sage starts.'\" 2>&1" "tee -a '$SAGE_ROOT'/start.log"
```
(`sage --version` is currently broken w.r.t. the removal, so you could actually move the `sed` command to `sage-sage`.)

or use `sage --python -c 'your favourite Python code'` for printing the date and Sage's version (**without** importing `sage.*`).

Oops, of course you're right.  Here's a new patch, using python instead of sage for the date and version.  (Note that the file sage/version.py is extremely simple, so if Python functions, we should be able to import it.)

It is, but note that also `sage/__init__.py` is executed when you import `sage.version`.

This is not a problem right now, but may become one if Sage's import mechanics change (which is work in progress).  You could perhaps modify `PYTHONPATH` and `import version`, but I haven't tried that yet<sup>*</sup>.  Maybe run Sage's Python directly then (instead of `./sage --python ...`).

<sup>*</sup> `PYTHONPATH="devel/sage/sage" local/bin/python -c 'import version; ...'` should work, both from within and outside a Sage environment.

Actually only depends on *one part* (the one to `sage-starts`) *of one patch* ([attachment:ticket:11926:11926_sage_starts.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11991/6aaea3b0e76c498bc2103bf783c2f816.patch)) at #11926.

`sage-starts` could by the way be more robust, i.e., it shouldn't print the following if the current working directory just happens to not be `$SAGE_ROOT`, and `SAGE_ROOT` isn't set.

```sh
$ bin/sage-starts 

Testing that Sage starts...
[2011-11-05 23:15:43] 
bin/sage-starts: line 14: spkg/pipestatus: No such file or directory
Sage failed to start up.
Please email sage-devel (http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel)
explaining the problem and send the log file
  /home/leif/Sage/sage-4.7.2-gcc-4.5.1/local/start.log
Describe your computer, operating system, etc.
```

(Also note the logfile's name / location.  The log just contains the time stamp, and left-over files are likely to pollute repositories; only the root repository ignores `*.log` files.  I'm not saying that this is something a user will typically run into [unless e.g. he/she includes `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin` into his/her `PATH`, which apparently some do, although they clearly shouldn't<sup>*</sup>], but one shouldn't print a message that encourages people to submit useless error reports.)




Otherwise **positive review**, since that's not really related to the purpose of this ticket.  Feel free to fix it here (or elsewhere) though.


---

<sup>*</sup> We may add this to the Installation Guide (that one shouldn't put `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/` into `PATH`), but IMHO most scripts there should do the "usual" sanity check, i.e. for example test whether `SAGE_LOCAL` is defined, since most (or at least many) depend on the Sage environment being already set up.

I had exactly the same in mind, although I would just print: *"This script has to be run from the SAGE_ROOT directory or with SAGE_ROOT properly set."*

I won't mind if you add your suggestion to your patch.  You could prepend <code>\`pwd\`/</code> to `spkg/pipestatus` (in the message) and perhaps then put that filename on a line by its own.
