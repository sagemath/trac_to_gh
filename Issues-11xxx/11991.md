The message printed by sage-starts should record the time and the version of Sage, especially since the output is now logged.

Ahem, what if Sage doesn't start?  Then we get no date...

So you could either do something like

```sh
echo "[`date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`]" \
     "`sage --version | sed -n -e '/Version/s/^[ |]\+//;s/[ |]\+$//p'`." \
    | tee -a "$SAGE_ROOT"/start.log

spkg/pipestatus "sage -c \"print 'Yes, Sage starts.'\" 2>&1" "tee -a '$SAGE_ROOT'/start.log"
```
or, directly,

```sh
echo "[`date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`]" \
     "`sed -n -e '/Version/s/^[ |]\+//;/Version/s/[ |]\+$//p' "$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin/sage-banner`." \
    | tee -a "$SAGE_ROOT"/start.log

spkg/pipestatus "sage -c \"print 'Yes, Sage starts.'\" 2>&1" "tee -a '$SAGE_ROOT'/start.log"
```
(`sage --version` is currently broken w.r.t. the removal, so you could actually move the `sed` command to `sage-sage`.)

or use `sage --python -c 'your favourite Python code'` for printing the date and Sage's version (**without** importing `sage.*`).

It is, but note that also `sage/__init__.py` is executed when you import `sage.version`.

This is not a problem right now, but may become one if Sage's import mechanics change (which is work in progress).  You could perhaps modify `PYTHONPATH` and `import version`, but I haven't tried that yet<sup>*</sup>.  Maybe run Sage's Python directly then (instead of `./sage --python ...`).

<sup>*</sup> `PYTHONPATH="devel/sage/sage" local/bin/python -c 'import version; ...'` should work, both from within and outside a Sage environment.

Actually only depends on *one part* (the one to `sage-starts`) *of one patch* ([attachment:ticket:11926:11926_sage_starts.patch]) at #11926.

`sage-starts` could by the way be more robust, i.e., it shouldn't print the following if the current working directory just happens to not be `$SAGE_ROOT`, and `SAGE_ROOT` isn't set.

```sh
$ bin/sage-starts 

Testing that Sage starts...

bin/sage-starts: line 14: spkg/pipestatus: No such file or directory
Sage failed to start up.
Please email sage-devel (http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel)
explaining the problem and send the log file
  /home/leif/Sage/sage-4.7.2-gcc-4.5.1/local/start.log
Describe your computer, operating system, etc.
```

(Also note the logfile's name / location.  The log just contains the time stamp, and left-over files are likely to pollute repositories; only the root repository ignores `*.log` files.  I'm not saying that this is something a user will typically run into [unless e.g. he/she includes `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin` into his/her `PATH`, which apparently some do, although they clearly shouldn't<sup>*</sup>], but one shouldn't print a message that encourages people to submit useless error reports.)




Otherwise **positive review**, since that's not really related to the purpose of this ticket.  Feel free to fix it here (or elsewhere) though.


---

<sup>*</sup> We may add this to the Installation Guide (that one shouldn't put `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/` into `PATH`), but IMHO most scripts there should do the "usual" sanity check, i.e. for example test whether `SAGE_LOCAL` is defined, since most (or at least many) depend on the Sage environment being already set up.

I had exactly the same in mind, although I would just print: *"This script has to be run from the SAGE_ROOT directory or with SAGE_ROOT properly set."*

I won't mind if you add your suggestion to your patch.  You could prepend ``pwd`/` to `spkg/pipestatus` (in the message) and perhaps then put that filename on a line by its own.
