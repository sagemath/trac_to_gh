With [attachment:11685.patch], that example fails as follows:

```

The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1140, 0))

PariError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

```

I think it *should* be possible to use the value of a pari element for the creation of a pari element. Hence, either we use the first patch, or the second patch needs work.

Perhaps, one could merge the two patches and use Johan's algorithm together with Jeroen's examples?

I think that the fact that your example works for the first patch is an unintentional side-effect and not really an intended feature.  I believe my code is much more clear and simple.

Intended or not doesn't matter. It is a feature, I think.

> I believe that I am fixing much more than what the ticket requires, ...


Indeed it does, namely:

```
sage: k.<x> = GF(3^11)
sage: k([ k(0),k(1) ]) 
x 
sage: k([0,1/2]) 
2 
sage: R.<y> = PolynomialRing(k) 
sage: k([ R(0),R(1) ]) 
x
```

It a strength of your patch that the examples above work (they wouldn't, with the other patch).

Do you see a way to make *both* work?

I wouldn't say that your patch is simpler, because you first convert into a list of prime field elements and then convert into pari; a double conversion, so it seems to me, tends to be fragile.

I mean, the only problem with `k([k([0])._FiniteField_ext_pariElement__value])` in your patch is the fact that the pari value (which, after all, is zero) can not be converted into the zero of a finite field. There could be a work around, such as

```
value = [GFp(c) for c in value if c else GFp.zero_element()] 
```

Concerning speed, one should test whether `k([])` is the only case in which your patch is slower. Since you have a special case for `k([])` anyway, it would be perfectly fine to have a short-cut, such as

```
if not value:  # or value==[], if that's faster
    self.__value = (pari(0) * parent._pari_one()).Mod(parent._pari_modulus()) 
```

There is a `prime_subfield()` method, and you are perfectly right that it ought to be a cached method. Hopefully someone finally manages to review #11115: It would make cached methods *very* fast.

"Breaking down into two simpler steps" makes sense. But one should keep in mind that it will now be *two* steps that could break. And if you measure simplicity in lines of code: Both patches have six lines of code in the section we are now talking about (if I did not miscount).

Perhaps we should clarify what we want to do with a list.

Let K be a finite field that is not a prime field. To the very least, we want: If L is a list of elements of the prime subfield k of K then K(L) should first interprete L as the list of coefficients of a polynomial, and interprete the polynomial as an element of K.

Ideally, we also want to allow in L objects that can be converted into k, even though their parent is not k in the first place. We seem to disagree on how that conversion is best done.

 1) The first patch seems to argue that, ultimately, we want to put stuff into pari, and so we should start to put it into pari as soon as possible, and do all further conversions there: We can put a list of field elements into pari, and we can easily convert things like pari(K(0)) into an element of pari(k).

 2) The second patch seems to argue that we are Sage programmers, and thus the conversion should follow Sage standards, not pari standards. Thus, k is a finite prime field in Sage, and we only accept things that can be converted into that prime field. Apparently, an element of pari(K) that happens to belong to pari(k) fails to convert into k, sadly.

I think that both approaches are equally simple, and both approaches make sense.

So, I suggest to decide based on (a) speed and (b) generality. (b) could be problematic, since at the moment we have examples that only work with the first patch and examples that only work with the second patch.

According to Johan, things are already quite slow, so, speed should really matter most.

By the way, I'd prefer fast code with many features, if I can pick only two out of three...

1) That option and the code was completely undocumented and the purpose is not clear.

2) The logic seems backward: executing more code when *not* checking?

3) The ``check`` code changes the functionality of the function, which is usually not desired.  To me checking should be something read-only, checking for invalid input and throwing exceptions.  But not modifying the input.

4) the ``check`` code is related to the handling of zero inputs which is anyway handled separately in the code below.

<a id='comment:33'></a>First of all, note that the option `check==False` is used, as you can see by studying the arithmetic operations on finite field elements. And it is clearly beneficial! For example:

Without patches, I get

```
sage: K.<a> = GF(5^9)
sage: b = 4*a^7 + 2*a^5 + 4*a^4 + 4*a^3 + 3*a^2 + 3*a
sage: %timeit b+3  # here, you will find that "check=False".
625 loops, best of 3: 30.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit copy(b)
625 loops, best of 3: 14.3 µs per loop
```
With your patch, it takes 42 µs resp. 25.9 µs per loop.

25-30% difference is relevant. Thus, I'd prefer to keep the "check=False" code.

Moreover, I can still not understand your rationale for removing the code:

Replying to [comment:32 jdemeyer]:
> 1) That option and the code was completely undocumented and the purpose is not clear.


If code is not documented then it should be documented, not removed.

The purpose is very clear: Provide better speed by avoiding any tests (or conversions, in this case). I think it is fairly common to have that option in Sage, of course for internal use only.

The price to pay for the speed is that one needs to provide very specific input: It must be pari.

> 2) The logic seems backward: executing more code when *not* checking?


You can't be serious.

If one has `check=False` then one just has

```
        if not check:
            if not value:  # see comment below about this workaround
                self.__value = pari(0).Mod(parent._pari_modulus())*parent._pari_one()
            else:
                self.__value = value
            return
```
and nothing more: Note the "return" in the last line.

> 3) The ``check`` code changes the functionality of the function, which is usually not desired.


It is quite usual that the check option does change the behaviour of the function, in the sense that a very specific input is expected, and it is not tested whether the user really got it right.

Here, check=False means that the input must be an element in the pari interface. Only since "zero" is a special case (see comments in the code), you have the test "if not value". As a side effect, the input `[]` or `None` or `False` would result in a zero element as well.

>  To me checking should be something read-only, checking for invalid input and throwing exceptions.  But not modifying the input.


Sometimes you have two separate options `check` and `coerce`. Here, indeed, checking means that the input is also converted, when necessary. `convert_to_pari` might be a better name than `check`.

But since it is for internal use anyway, I see not much reason to change the name.

> 4) the ``check`` code is related to the handling of zero inputs which is anyway handled separately in the code below.


No. The check code simply provides a short cut for pari input. Only since pari is inconsistent in the way how different types of zero are dealt with, a special case is needed.

I suggest to use your patch without removing the `if check:` part. Can you please update it? And since the arguments of the `__init__` method are not documented at all, I suggest that I create a referee patch that fixes the documentation.

The tests pass, hence, it was not necessary to have a special case for zero if `value_from_pari==True`.

I have attached a referee patch, that documents the arguments and adds a few examples. I hope my words are clear and concise enough, as the possible input can be very different.

Do you mean "sage-4.7.2.alpha1" (not 4.6.2 but 4.7.2)?

> Hunk #2 succeeded at 3081 with fuzz 2 (offset 2525 lines).
> Hunk #4 succeeded at 610 with fuzz 2 (offset -24 lines).


If I remember correctly, fuzz 2 will not be accepted by the release manager, because it is not improbable that the patch was applied in the wrong location - in particular when the offset is a couple of thousand lines.
