On #11553, mmarco gives an example that can be distilled to:

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'a')
sage: x = vector(R, [1, 0])
sage: y = vector(R, [0, 1])
sage: z = vector(R, [0,-1])
sage: A = (R^2).span([x, y])
sage: B = (R^2).span([x, z])
sage: A == B
False
sage: A.is_submodule(B)
True
sage: B.is_submodule(A)
True
```

Root cause looks like an assumption that echelon form (Hermite form) over PIDs is unique, which may be insurmountable in general.

```
sage: S = matrix([x, y])
sage: S._echelon_form_PID()[1]
[1 0]
[0 1]
sage: T = matrix([x, z])
sage: T._echelon_form_PID()[1]
[ 1  0]
[ 0 -1]
```

This also affects the ordering of free modules via the `__cmp__` method.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

One suggestion for a fix:

(a) make comparisons raise a NotImplementedError for rings that are not fields and not ZZ - though I have not checked to see how important an ordering on free modules is.

(b) use a pair of calls to `.is_submodule()` to test equality.

I don't plan to pursue this one much further, but could review a fix.
