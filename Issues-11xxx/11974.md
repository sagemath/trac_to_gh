Amazingly, this even speeds things up.

```
# old
sage: timeit('[h(1,2) for h in T.to_cartesian(operator.mul)]')
625 loops, best of 3: 968 µs per loop
# new
sage: timeit('[h(1,2) for h in T.to_cartesian(operator.mul)]')
625 loops, best of 3: 939 µs per loop
```
Good work, sorry it took so long to get to reviewing this.

Annoyingly, all these doctests are not visible in the built docs because the entire *class* is an underscore!
