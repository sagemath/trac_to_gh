Keywords: load attach traceback

When debugging code that is loaded into or attached to a Sage session from a .sage file,
the tracebacks are not very informative: they refer to <string> instead
of to the file name, and give no line numbers or code snippets. This
makes it hard to find out where the error is.

The patch fixes this for attach, but not for load (because of efficiency reasons).

Apply [attachment:11812.3.patch]

---

Example:

Suppose I have some files loaded with "load" or "attach", and one of them is a .sage file with

```
class Bar():
     def function_with_common_name(self):
         # lots of lines of code
         1/0
         # lots of lines of code

# other classes that also have functions named function_with_common_name

def foo():
     # lots of lines of code
     a = Bar()
     a.function_with_common_name()
     # lots of lines of code
```

Now I do

```
sage: foo()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/marco/<ipython console> in <module>()

/home/marco/<string> in foo()

/home/marco/<string> in function_with_common_name(self)

/usr/local/sage/sage-4.6.2/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/structure/element.so
in sage.structure.element.RingElement.__div__
(sage/structure/element.c:11981)()

/usr/local/sage/sage-4.6.2/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/rings/integer.so
in sage.rings.integer.Integer._div_ (sage/rings/integer.c:11944)()

/usr/local/sage/sage-4.6.2/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/rings/integer_ring.so
in sage.rings.integer_ring.IntegerRing_class._div
(sage/rings/integer_ring.c:5142)()

ZeroDivisionError: Rational division by zero
```

Then to find the bug using this traceback, I would need to search my
files to find all functions named "function_with_common_name" that are
called from functions named "foo" for a line that could cause a division
by zero...

Judging from the patchbot results, it doesn't seem to work after all.

What exactly does spawn('sage') do? It always started a Sage session of the same Sage version and the same Sage installation when I tried it out (it was not in the PATH, but it was in the working directory). Maybe it doesn't work on all machines or it depends on the working directory?

Any idea of how to do these tests so that they succeed with patch and fail without?

A few minor issues:

* `if preparse_to_file == None:` should be `if preparse_to_file `**`is`**` None:`.

* There's some mark-up missing in the docstrings (also in parts you didn't add).
 
* In docstrings, Python identifiers (constants, function and variable names etc.) and the like should be enclosed in double backticks (```name```, which means Courier / typewriter font); ``name`` in contrast yields typesetting in *math* mode.




I'm not sure what your problem with doctests involving tracebacks exactly was; we have a couple of such tests (not needing to call `sage` or use the `PExpect` interface); they just look slightly different to what you get in a real Sage session.

You can also use continuation lines in examples and doctests by the way, but again they're (currently still) a bit different such that you cannot directly paste them from a Sage session, i.e., you have to use the Python form instead of Sage's (cf. #10458).

>  * `if preparse_to_file == None:` should be `if preparse_to_file `**`is`**` None:`.

Thanks, all corrected (I think).

>  * In docstrings, Python identifiers (constants, function and variable names etc.) and the like should be enclosed in double backticks (```name```, which means Courier / typewriter font); ``name`` in contrast yields typesetting in *math* mode.


Not sure what you mean: I don't see where in this docstring single backticks are or should be used. I did add some double backticks though.


> I'm not sure what your problem with doctests involving tracebacks exactly was; we have a couple of such tests (not needing to call `sage` or use the `PExpect` interface); they just look slightly different to what you get in a real Sage session.


The problem with the doctest is that I couldn't create a test that really checks whether #11812 was fixed:

* The content of the traceback in the example `sage: attach('myfile.sage')` on line 1573 of [attachment:trac_11812-traceback_attach.patch] is ignored in doctests according to [this link](http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html#what-about-exceptions). And indeed, that example passes the doctests even with #11812 not applied.

* The test with pexpect in that attachment seemed to work on my computer, but doesn't really, according to [patchbot](http://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/11812/linux/ubuntu/hardy/sage.math.washington.edu/2011-09-22%2008:56:39%20-0700). The problem is that I don't quite understand which sage installation is used in this test.

So I had to remove the test. As the example isn't tested anyway, I decided to keep things simple by removing that as well and adding a few explanatory comments to the code.

What exactly are these "efficiency reasons"? Are people really executing `load` or `attach` in tight loops? I think that one should **always** have good tracebacks, so I would always use temporary files.

With a temporary file, there is a good traceback, but working with files can be slow. When precompiling in memory, it is faster, but that is not implemented in a way that yields good tracebacks.

> Are people really executing `load` or `attach` in tight loops?


I can't imagine that anyone would do that.

> I think that one should **always** have good tracebacks, so I would always use temporary files.


I completely agree. However, it seemed during the original discussion that I was the only one who always wanted good tracebacks. And someone made the switch to memory on purpose, for efficiency reasons.

I am thinking about #71 and it *might* be possible to have a traceback for a preparsed-in-memory file by re-preparsing the file when showing the traceback. I still have to check if that actually works.

> And someone made the switch to memory on purpose

Indeed.

> for efficiency reasons.

That's not clear to me, maybe it was just to simplify the code?

Sounds good.

Anyway, to get good tracebacks by default also for load, all you need to do is change

```
load_debug_mode = False 
attach_debug_mode = True 
```
both to `True` in sage/misc/preparser.py, except that the name `debug_mode` is a bit confusing when it is the default.

> maybe it was just to simplify the code?


Simplifying and improving the code was indeed the purpose of #7514, where the switch to memory was made. The efficiency reason for the switch to memory was suggested to me by various people, not including the author of #7514.
