The attached patch, taken from a [discussion on ask.sagemath.org](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/521/why-remove_face-uses-alexander-duality), speeds up `remove_face` for large simplicial complexes.  For smaller ones, it is comparable, perhaps a little slower, but the speed-up for large ones is significant.

Before the patch:

```
sage: S = range(1,8)
sage: timeit('Z = SimplicialComplex(S, [S]); Z.remove_face([1,2,3])')
625 loops, best of 3: 767 µs per loop

sage: timeit('SimplicialComplex(10,[[0,1,2,3,4,5,6],[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[0,1,2,4,5,6,7],[0,1,2,3,5,6,7],[0,1,2,3,4,5,7]]).remove_face(Simplex([1,2,5]))')
5 loops, best of 3: 42.2 ms per loop
```
After the patch:

```
sage: S = range(1,8)
sage: timeit('Z = SimplicialComplex(S, [S]); Z.remove_face([1,2,3])')
625 loops, best of 3: 835 µs per loop

sage: timeit('SimplicialComplex(10,[[0,1,2,3,4,5,6],[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[0,1,2,4,5,6,7],[0,1,2,3,5,6,7],[0,1,2,3,4,5,7]]).remove_face2(Simplex([1,2,5]))')
125 loops, best of 3: 1.79 ms per loop
```
The original idea (from ask.sagemath.org) is by "EmersonL", and John Palmieri modified it and wrote the actual patch.
