I don't know if `SciPy` has a random element, or it is that platform dependent.\n\nThis decomposition is not unique (mathematically).  I cannot determine if `SciPy` is suppose to return the same result across platforms.  I'll dig deeper.\n\nIn any event, your three examples all seem correct, in that the diagonals of T all have the eigenvalues of the matrix.  Run in Sage, the doctests should have checked all the key properties (unitary, upper-triangular, decomposition).\n\nDid you check Mathematica's result for unitary and decomposition?\n\nRob",

Definitely!  That is disturbing.  I don't know if `SciPy` has a random element, or it is that platform dependent.

This decomposition is not unique (mathematically).  I cannot determine if `SciPy` is suppose to return the same result across platforms.  I'll dig deeper.

In any event, your three examples all seem correct, in that the diagonals of T all have the eigenvalues of the matrix.  Run in Sage, the doctests should have checked all the key properties (unitary, upper-triangular, decomposition).

Did you check Mathematica's result for unitary and decomposition?

v2 patch adjusts the tests to not rely on exact values in the unitary matrix, nor above the diagonal in the upper-triangular matrix.  It adds a few more checks on the diagonal entries, which are the eigenvalues of the matrix.  There are also a couple of new checks on the 2-norm of the similar matrices, one for the real case and one for the complex case.

This passes tests on my desktop (Ubuntu, i7-2600) and on sage.math.

Jason - would you mind testing this on a Mac before we turn it loose?

Thanks, John and Dave.

I'm more concerned about #10837, so if you see those variable results, please let me know about that.

John - I have an account on Skynet, so I should do some testing there, I see.  Do you have any pointers to etiquette/practices there?  Do I build in my home directory?  Should I "nice" things or limit the number of cores?

Thanks, Jeroen.  No problems here.

I'd misunderstood and thought #10837 was in as well, so this helped clear that up for me.

I just need to get into the habit of testing on a wider variety of platforms if I'm going to tackle these numerical procedures.  sage.math, of course, but I should add `SkyNet` to my repertoire also.

Sorry for the trouble - I should have realized these -0.0 entries were a bad sign.

As always, thanks for all your careful work as release manager.

Ignore the request, John. I think I have found my way.  Maybe.

Well, it looks like this was just carelessness on my part, and not any kind of platform-variability problem.  On other doctests, which seem to pass for the various testers, I have code like

```
sage: T = T.zero_at(1.0e-12).change_ring(RDF)
sage: T.round(6)
```

The first line was missing on this one problem test - the doctest patch just adds in such a line.  Likely a cut/paste when there should have been a copy/paste.

With the new patch, this passes tests on my 64-bit Ubuntu machine and on sage.math.  I'm in the process of testing on `SkyNet/cleo`.  I'm confident this fix should be OK, but "once burned, twice shy."

This is ready for review, but I'd like to have the cleo result before it gets flipped to positive review.

I couldn't get Sage past building PARI on cleo, and this seems to be a problem with a few tickets floating around, and I didn't see a quick fix (ie one I could understand).  So I'm going to abandon that and let the buildbots do any further checks.  As mentioned, i'm pretty confident about this fixing the problem, across platforms.

It's a one-line patch, and this decomposition will be *really* useful for lots of checks (like Hermitian, unitary, etc), so this is ready to go for a review.

Hi Rob,

I think it's going to have to be more than a one-line patch, maybe three or four lines: in addition to adding the call to `zero_at`, the matrix entries in the doctest which are currently `-0.0` need to be changed to `0.0`, don't they?

Aargh!  Yes, of course.  I think I was doctesting the wrong file since I've had my head into matrix2.pyx heavily the past few days.

Hi John,

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A34):
> *ping* any ideas?

Hi Jeroen.  Thanks for the interest.

Ideas?  Lots:

(a) Doctesting this numerical stuff is hard.

(b) We should not be relying on Apple's vector libraries.

(c) Organizing Sage Days 31 has me distracted.

But seriously,

(i) I've thinking about taking on eigenvalues and eigenvectors, generally.  There is a lot of inconsistency floating around.  Ordering eigenvalues would be one thing to tackle.  Which is the real reason I have not moved on this one.

(ii) Doctest in question is about verifying the 2x2 blocks along the diagonal of the real Schur decomposition.  It would probably be better to not force the eigenvalues of the 2x2 blocks to match the usual Sage output, and instead just sort the "plain" eigenvalues to match the sorted list from the 2x2 blocks.  That would be an easy fix.

(iii) The ordering of eigenvalues under "old" OS X might need to be investigated separately and fixed up.  On Linux and Sage 4.7 I get:

```
sage: A = matrix(RDF, 4, 4, [[1, 0, -3, -1],
...                          [4, -16, -7, 0],
...                          [1, 21, 1, -2],
...                          [26, -1, -2, 1]])
sage: A.eigenvalues()
[-0.789826456477 + 2.33693044103*I, -0.789826456477 - 2.33693044103*I, -5.71017354352 + 8.38264062467*I, -5.71017354352 - 8.38264062467*I]
```

which is different from what you are reporting on OS X 10.4 PPC.  Probably happening at the `NumPy` level or further down.

I'll likely make the change mentioned above in a few days, perhaps while at Sage Days.  On vacation at the moment.

Rob

Okay, I have looked at [attachment: trac_11027-schur-decomposition-doctest-v2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11027/trac_11027-schur-decomposition-doctest-v2.patch.gz) and it makes sense.  In fact, the new patch is cleaner than the old one.  Since the main patch is already positively reviewed, this gives... positive_review!
