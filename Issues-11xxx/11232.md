On Windows 7 an executable named patch.exe will not run (UAC prevents this), unless
it is accompanied by patch.exe.manifest.
See
http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2009-03/msg00010.html

So we just should not build it there, and use the Cygwin's patch instead. 
I hope Cygwin's native 2.5.8 patch is good enough.

The modified patch spkg is here:

[http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/patch-2.5.9.p2.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/patch-2.5.9.p2.spkg)

(tested on Linux and on Win 7 with and without patch installed)

The test is not working. I changed it a little, so it worked on Solaris instead of Cygwin. My changes are:

```
if [ "x$UNAME" = xSunOS ] ; then
   if ! patch --version | grep >/dev/null 'patch '; then
      echo "On Cygwin you must have patch installed"
      echo "via the Cygwin setup.exe program"
      exit 1
   fi
   exit 0
fi
```

then I created a script called 'patch', which just echos "foo"

```
drkirkby@laptop:~/patch-2.5.9.p1$ patch
foo
```

Now when I run spkg-install, it does not detect I don't have a usable 'patch; command:

```
drkirkby@laptop:~/patch-2.5.9.p1$ ./spkg-install
SAGE_LOCAL undefined ... exiting
Maybe run 'sage -sh'?
drkirkby@laptop:~/patch-2.5.9.p1$ 
```

There's no message I need to install patch. 

I'm not sure exactly what you are trying to achieve here - this is not the way I would write a test. But the exit code of grep should be 0 in the case of a match and non-zero for the case of no match or an error. 

I would also suggest putting the test to see if 'SAGE_ROOT' is set at the top, as it is with every other package. 

A better place to check for the existence of 'patch' is actually in the prereq script, as we should let users know as soon as possible if their system needs extra things installed.

OK, I've updated the spkg-install in the spkg (same location) to do the test on the existence of SAGE_ROOT first.

The logic of the CYGWIN-specific test is that it runs 'patch --version' and exits with 1 if the output
does not contain 'patch '; otherwise, it exits with 0.
This test is shamelessly stolen from the bottom of spkg-install, where it tests for the version (I only removed the version part).

If Cygwin needs *patch* installed this should be checked early on. We test that a Fortran compiler exists well before we start to use it. Why should *patch* be any different? 

Exiting on Cygwin is sensible if there' no need to install *patch*, but testing if the program exists should in my opinion be done much earlier on. I believe the way to do that is probably to use `AC_CHECK_PROG` in the 'prereq' part of Sage. 

Also note running *patch* with no arguments will leave it there sitting for input. 

Would it not be better to install *patch.exe.manifest* from 

http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2009-03/msg00010.html

? Then we could install *patch* the same way as any other program, and know it behaves the same, as we have the same version. 

Something along the lines of 

```
if [ "x$UNAME" = xCYGWIN ] ; then
  cp patches/patch.exe.manifest "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin"
fi
```

Can you attach a Mercurial patch for review purposes, so we can see what you are trying to do. The ticket is much more informative if it has the changes attached.

It seems to me the method proposed here is far from optimal.

I wasted few hours yesterday trying this path. It is NOT merely copying an extra file somewhere. One has to use a Microsoft installer to cook up this "security exception", or an equivalent convoluted procedure requiring editing the registry and god knows what else (reading MS documentation on this stuff makes your head spin...)

why should patch be different from Atlas? I went the way it was done for Atlas.
OK, there is an inconsistency in design here, as you point out,

well, yes, it would. Hence there is an argument...

if you untar the spkg file and do 

```
hg diff -r3:6
```

you will see the difference. Do we need to post perfectly reproducible things like this here?

Because the ATLAS method is incorrect. That's a good enough reason for me. Two wrongs don't make a right. 

The ATLAS spkg-install happens to be very poor in many respects. It is a very small Python script that calls a large bash script. I don't think we should use ATLAS as a model. 

> I went the way it was done for Atlas.


Numerous tests for programs are performed - gcc, g++, gfortran, m4, bash. There's a test for the maths library too. All these checks for prerequisites are done at the start. Just because one package happens to do it the wrong way, does not mean we should copy that.

If it's minor and fixable is should be fixed. I don't think its a good idea to let a build progress any further than necessary if it is obvious it is going to fail.

Well 99% of people do attach patches, which makes review a lot easier. It also leaves a record for others to see what is proposed and why specific solutions were rejected. 

Anyway, I'm not happy with this approach to solving an issue with *patch*, when it's clear there are better ways that don't copy a method that's clearly flawed. I'm not going to put it back to "needs_work" again, as clearly you feel differently. You might find another reviewer who is happy with this method.

Yes, it is possible to do that. But normally one would type "make" and let it do the work. If you manually install items in an abnormal order, you should either know what you are doing or expect a failed installation.

Well, it's just crazy we have an old optional package with the same name is a current one in Sage. But that's an entirely different issue. I have created a ticket for that - #11247. 

If someone wants to screw up their Sage build it is not hard (I've done it myself), but we should try to prevent it as much as possible. Hence checking they have the right perquisites should be done at the start of the build process.

One reasonable option is to check if the file '`/usr/bin/patch`' exists on Cygwin. Checking if the file exists does not need it to be executed, so I assume that Windows 7 will not object. 

Although I've not tested this, adding something like these 4 lines

```
if [ "x`uname | sed 's/WIN.\+/WIN/'`" = xCYGWIN ] && [ ! -f /usr/bin/patch ] ; then
   echo "On Cygwin one must 'patch' on Cygwin fist. Do it by ..."
   exit 1
fi
```

to the script `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/prereq-0.8-install` would allow one to check if patch is installed early on, before we start building .spkg's. 

The steps to that would be something like:

* Add the above 4 lines to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/prereq-0.8-install`
* Change the 10<sup>th</sup> line of `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/prereq-0.8-install` to be '`TARGET=prereq-0.9`'
* Rename `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/prereq-0.8-install` to `spkg/base/prereq-0.9-install`
* extract the tar file prereq-0.8.tar
* rename the directory {{$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/prereq-0.8}}} to {{$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/prereq-0.9}}}
* Create the tar file  {{$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/prereq-0.9.tar}}} by just taring up {{$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/prereq-0.9}}}
* Remove {{$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/prereq-0.8.tar}}} (that file is not under revision control). 

If that was done, there would be an early test for 'patch'.

In that case, patch-2.5.9.p1.spkg would just need to exit with an exit code of 0 on Cygwin.

Does that sound sensible? I don't think its as good as building patch, but might be easier to implement. 

As John says, the documentation would need to document this, but that can be added on another ticket. 

As long as the updated .spkg and the changes to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/prereq-0.9-install` were merged together, I think that is a reasonable compromise. 

Whatever changes are made, please attach a patch to the ticket so we can see what is being done. 

Dave

I cannot resist quoting my own comment above:

* It is NOT merely copying an extra file somewhere. One has to use a Microsoft installer to cook up this "security exception", or an equivalent convoluted procedure requiring editing the registry and god knows what else (reading MS documentation on this stuff makes your head spin...)

In short, I don't see a point, as one can just use `patch` from `cygwin` instead.

It was not enough when I tried this; it might depend upon the Windows version (enterprise/business/home/leisure/recreation :-)), type of account, position of the planets, servicepack level, etc etc etc. 
I don't think we need to reinvent the wheel by not using what Cygwin provides. 

It could also be that if you have one patch.exe installed somewhere, and try to install another one, then you are in trouble...
