The octahedron and the icosahedron are of course (closed) polyhedra. The problem is, I guess, that the `dual()` function which creates them is not checking enclosedness and passing it on when generating the dual object.

Marking this ticket as "graphics" since it involves stuff in `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/plot/plot3d/`.
