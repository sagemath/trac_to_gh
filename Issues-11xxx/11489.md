The html `<iframe>` tag is a quick way to embed a web page into Sage.  A new python function `iframe(url)` would make it easier (and cleaner) to bring existing web pages into a Sage notebook.  This started as a way to bring GeoGebra worksheets into Sage, but in fact it could be used for other web based software.
