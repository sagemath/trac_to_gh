The html `<iframe>` tag is a quick way to embed a web page into Sage.  A new python function `iframe(url)` would make it easier (and cleaner) to bring existing web pages into a Sage notebook.  This started as a way to bring GeoGebra worksheets into Sage, but in fact it could be used for other web based software.

I'm not sure it was really necessary to combine the patches, but OK :) Thanks for the review! For future reference, you should generally use the more complete "git format" patches - put this in your `~/.hgrc` to enable them:
