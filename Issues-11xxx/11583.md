As mentioned in https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/6I3BD32YZWI
the standard sagetex example included in sage depends on tkz-berge which can be hard to get it working correctly. This might scare of sagetex users while tkz-berge is only needed for the graph (with vertices and edges) part of sage. The new version of the example .tex disables this part of the example by default with some notice on how to enable it.

I know how to fix this problem, but self-tests still fail if various `.sty` files are missing, as they are on sage.math:

Then you'll need to look over the most recent two revisions to the spkg repository (inside the spkg). 

Finally, install the spkg with SAGE_CHECK=yes and make sure it works.
