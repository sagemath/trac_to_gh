As mentioned in https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/6I3BD32YZWI
the standard sagetex example included in sage depends on tkz-berge which can be hard to get it working correctly. This might scare of sagetex users while tkz-berge is only needed for the graph (with vertices and edges) part of sage. The new version of the example .tex disables this part of the example by default with some notice on how to enable it.

A related, but not completely identical problem: self-tests fail for the sagetex package.  If I set SAGE_CHECK=yes and then do `sage -f sagetex...`, I get a message like

```
/Applications/sage_builds/sage/local/bin/sage-preparse: File 'example.sage' is missing
python: can't open file 'example.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
Error running Sage on example.sage!
```
I know how to fix this problem, but self-tests still fail if various `.sty` files are missing, as they are on sage.math:

```
! LaTeX Error: File `ifxetex.sty' not found.

Type X to quit or <RETURN> to proceed,
or enter new name. (Default extension: sty)

Enter file name: 
! Emergency stop.
<read *> 
```
I think the following patch fixes the first problem, but not the second:

I have an updated spkg that should fix both the file extension and `tkz-berge`/TikZ problems: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/drake/code/sage/st/sagetex-2.3.1.p1.spkg. 

To fully review, you'll need to look at some revisions to the source code; start with rev 3cc4e629401e "remove \sageplot default of .75\textwidth; make the user decide": https://bitbucket.org/ddrake/sagetex/changesets and look over all the revs to the tip. (A bunch are simple one-liners; don't be discouraged.)

Then you'll need to look over the most recent two revisions to the spkg repository (inside the spkg). 

Finally, install the spkg with SAGE_CHECK=yes and make sure it works.

Looks good to me.  Passes doctests on several different machines where it failed before, some of which have recent TeX distributions, some of which have old TeX distributions, and some of which are missing TeX altogether.

The only part of the change log that I don't completely understand (because I don't know LaTeX style files very well) is [this one](https://bitbucket.org/ddrake/sagetex/changeset/3840ae05d2a7), but I tried putting some Sage code in a labeled math environment, like align, and it worked fine.
