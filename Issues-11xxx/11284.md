This branch adds documentation to `FinitePoset.show` and `FinitePoset.plot`. It also lets one use a parameter of `plot` when calling `show`.

It also removes the `show` and `plot` methods from `HasseDiagram`: those two functions were never used anywhere as `FinitePoset.plot` calls `DiGraph.plot` directly. They also accepted parameters that were never used in the code.

As `HasseDiagram` is a internal class (not meant for users) no deprecation was added.

Nathann

P.S.: while it seems that the code removes arguments from show and plot it is not the case: these arguments are handled as they should by the subcall to the graph plot function.

Relating to this: Where is default pink color defined? For example

```
G=DiGraph({0:[1]})
G.show(vertex_colors='pink')
G.show(vertex_colors={'#ff00ff':[0]})
```

shows kind of a bug: color of element 1 changes from pink to blue when setting color of 0 to red.

Examples to `show()` could be something like

```
P.show(vertex_colors={'red':P.maximal_elements()})
```

or

```
for c in P.maximal_chains():
    P.show(vertex_colors={'red':c})
```

Where P would be suitable poset.

I still don't see how the user can find `figsize`-option. And IMO it is one of most important --- it is good to make smaller with poset of ~7 elements, almost necessary to make bigger with poset of 15 elements.

`cover_labels` put labels over the line, not near the line --- but this is place for another ticket.

Maybe `element_labels` could have explanation saying that it must be injective. And that `cover_labels` may be non-injective.

Hmm... how about some nice example of colors? Poset with top element and color by mÃ¶bius function from top to element? Or a lattice where deleting some elements would make it non-lattice and those drawn as red? But there is no easy way to make graphics in documentation, so maybe no.

Thinking... Any opinions from others?

True. Actually, it can be found in the doc of Poset.show which mentions the doc of Graphics.show, where it appears. Not exactly as trivial as it should.

> `cover_labels` put labels over the line, not near the line --- but this is place for another ticket.


For this kind of stuff, I would say that people will try and see for themselves. The drawing is better than a long explanation `:-P`

Of changing the code to support non-injective labellings ! That is the most proper way to solve it.

> Hmm... how about some nice example of colors? Poset with top element and color by mÃ¶bius function from top to element? Or a lattice where deleting some elements would make it non-lattice and those drawn as red? But there is no easy way to make graphics in documentation, so maybe no.


You can still add an example, even if the code figure does not appear... It may change someday `:-)`

?? `P._hasse_diagram.show?` does not show it. I think that user must do at least two jumps to find it.

Yoooooo !

Oops right sorry `:-D`

In this case, however, you should also see a mention of `Graphics.show`:
