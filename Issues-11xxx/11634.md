Replying to [@sagetrac-mhampton](#comment%3A11):
> OK, I got it working now.  Clearly PPL is much faster on some of my test examples, wow.

Oh yeah, working with toric varieties got much better once most basic operations were switched to PPL!

I am also the offending reviewer on #11429, dropping off the radar half-way. Will try to remedy it shortly, without forgetting #11599.

I'm a little confused by the above numerical noise issue.  After changing so that the patch would apply, the doctest failed.  If I switch it to 

```
            sage: filled_poly.axes_width()
            0.8...
```
then it works.  I'm not sure if the "0.800..." makes sense on some other system or not.

Apart from that I think this all looks good.  There is one other doctest failure in integral_points.pyx resulting from the Python switch to 2.7, line 688 needs to be changed to

```
        OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long
```
instead of

```
        OverflowError: long int too large to convert to int
```

With those changes I would be happy to give a positive review.

I haven't looked at #11429 and #12159 by themselves, but it would be nice to get this ticket into sage-5.0.  I don't have a lot of time in the coming weeks but if Andrey can't review those I would try to check them out too.
