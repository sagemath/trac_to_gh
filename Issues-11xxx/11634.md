Oh yeah, working with toric varieties got much better once most basic operations were switched to PPL!

I am also the offending reviewer on #11429, dropping off the radar half-way. Will try to remedy it shortly, without forgetting #11599.

If I switch it to \n\n```\n            sage: filled_poly.axes_width()\n            0.8...\n```\nthen it works.  I'm not sure if the \"0.800...\" makes sense on some other system or not.\n\nApart from that I think this all looks good.  There is one other doctest failure in integral_points.pyx resulting from the Python switch to 2.7, line 688 needs to be changed to\n\n```\n        OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long\n```\ninstead of\n\n```\n        OverflowError: long int too large to convert to int\n```\n\nWith those changes I would be happy to give a positive review.\n\nI haven't looked at #11429 and #12159 by themselves, but it would be nice to get this ticket into sage-5.0.

I'm a little confused by the above numerical noise issue.  After changing so that the patch would apply, the doctest failed.  If I switch it to 

```
            sage: filled_poly.axes_width()
            0.8...
```
then it works.  I'm not sure if the "0.800..." makes sense on some other system or not.

Apart from that I think this all looks good.  There is one other doctest failure in integral_points.pyx resulting from the Python switch to 2.7, line 688 needs to be changed to

```
        OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long
```
instead of

```
        OverflowError: long int too large to convert to int
```

With those changes I would be happy to give a positive review.

I haven't looked at #11429 and #12159 by themselves, but it would be nice to get this ticket into sage-5.0.  I don't have a lot of time in the coming weeks but if Andrey can't review those I would try to check them out too.
