The Lucas sequence modulo an integer n is given by `V_k = PV_{k-1} - Q V_{k-2} mod n` with `V_0 = 2 and V_1 = P`. This is not implemented in Sage. There are algorithms `fast_lucas` and `slow_lucas` that compute this sequence only for the special case `Q=1`.

```
sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod import fast_lucas
sage: [fast_lucas(i, Mod(8,11)) for i in range(15)]

Add the patches for function `lucas(k,p,q,n)` which generates Lucas sequence V_k mod n (k >= 0) defined by `V_k = PV_{k-1} - QV_{k-2} with V_0 = 2 and V_1 = P`.

Tests::

```
        sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod import lucas
        sage: p = randint(0,100000)
        sage: q = randint(0,100000)
        sage: n = randint(0,100)
        sage: all([lucas(k,p,q,n)[0] == Mod(lucas_number2(k,p,q),n)
        ...        for k in Integers(20)])
        True
```

```
        sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod import lucas
        sage: p = randint(0,100000)
        sage: q = randint(0,100000)
        sage: n = randint(0,100)
        sage: k = randint(0,100)
        sage: lucas(k,p,q,n) == [Mod(lucas_number2(k,p,q),n),Mod(q^(int(k/2)),n)]
        True
```

Examples::

```
        sage: [lucas(k,4,5,11)[0] for k in range(30)]
        [2, 4, 6, 4, 8, 1, 8, 5, 2, 5, 10, 4, 10, 9, 8, 9, 7, 5, 7, 3, 10, 3, 6, 9, 6, 1, 7, 1, 2, 3]

        sage: lucas(20,4,5,11)
        [10, 1]
```

The code looks ok to me.

Not sure that we should keep both the code in fast_lucas just for the case Q=1 and lucas function for the generic case.

Of course the specialized version for Q=1 is faster, so it might be a reason to keep it, even if I'm more inclined not to.

I provided two "reviewer" patches and if Robert has any preference, let him decide.

Well I know absolutely nothing about Lucas number, so I do not know how useful this is when `Q=1` `O_o`

This being said, it looks like there are two `lucas_*` functions in combinat 

```
sage: sage.combinat.combinat.lucas_number1
<function sage.combinat.combinat.lucas_number1>
sage: sage.combinat.combinat.lucas_number2
<function sage.combinat.combinat.lucas_number2>
```
And all lucas functions should probably be linked toward each other (with `.. seealso::` sections) if not implemented at the same place. If they do not do the same job already.

Perhaps it would even be better to change the current `lucas_*` functions so that one can compute the numbers themselves, or modulo something depending on the input.

Then again, having `slow_lucas`, `fast_lucas` and `lucas` definitely looks too much. Couldn't all three implementations be available in the same function ? With a flag to decide which one should be used ? All the code could be in the same function by the way..

And well. Given that this code is 2yo, perhaps an email should be sent to sage-devel to find guys who know what this code does and review it. 2years is a long time `^^;`

Here's a branch version of this (no rebasing was required) and I fixed up some docstring formatting and deprecated `slow_lucas()` (see below).

Currently in Sage, `slow_lucas` uses the recursive definition which works for arbitrary integers, whereas the fast `Q=1` and general both only work in modular arithmetic? Although from the code, there doesn't seem to be anything that explicitly uses `n`, so I would (naively) think that this could work for general integers. I haven't tested this; please correct me if I'm wrong. Also I vote to keep the specialized `Q=1` implementation since it is faster.

I've deprecated `slow_lucas` since the more general `BinaryRecurrenceSequence` is faster:

```
sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod import slow_lucas
sage: %timeit L = [slow_lucas(k,1,-1) for k in range(20)]
10 loops, best of 3: 16.4 ms per loop
sage: %timeit L = [slow_lucas(k,1,-1) for k in range(20)]
10 loops, best of 3: 16 ms per loop

sage: %timeit B = BinaryRecurrenceSequence(1, 1, 2, 1)
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.67 us per loop
sage: B = BinaryRecurrenceSequence(1, 1, 2, 1)
sage: %timeit LB = [B(k) for k in range(20)]
1 loops, best of 3: 15.1 ms per loop
sage: %timeit LB = [B(k) for k in range(20)] # There's caching going on
100 loops, best of 3: 7.7 ms per loop
```

Best,

Travis

Thanks for the gitification.

I'm mostly happy with the code.
And with Travis changes.
Let's keep the two fast functions and deprecate the slow one.
I just think we should rename the fast_lucas function to something like lucas_q1.

> Maybe Paul would be interested and he surely knows what this is about.


sorry with the change to git I am unable to figure out what is the diff with respect to Sage 6.0.
Thus I can only give general comments:

1) it makes no sense to have a `slow_lucas` and a `fast_lucas` function. The philosophy in Sage is to use `algorithm='recurrence'` or `algorithm='matrix_exponentiation'` instead (for example).

2) I don't see why the case Q<>1 could not be implemented either by the recurrence or the matrix
exponentiation.

3) instead of separate functions for ZZ and IntegerModRing(n), it would be nicer to have a single function with an option `ring=ZZ` (default) and `ring=IntegerModRing(15)`.

This ticket mostly provides a fast and general implementation.

In trac, you can click on the branch (and wait until all time ends) and see the diff wrt the current beta version (which is the `develop` branch). You can also view the diff from the commits by `git diff <sha1_commit1> <sha1_commit2>`, for example: `git diff ​7c11ef2	​d8c854c` should give you everything that was changed in this ticket.

Best,
