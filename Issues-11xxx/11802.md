The Lucas sequence modulo an integer n is given by `V_k = PV_{k-1} - Q V_{k-2} mod n` with `V_0 = 2 and V_1 = P`. This is not implemented in Sage. There are algorithms `fast_lucas` and `slow_lucas` that compute this sequence only for the special case `Q=1`.

```
sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod import fast_lucas
sage: [fast_lucas(i, Mod(8,11)) for i in range(15)]
[2, 8, 7, 4, 3, 9, 3, 4, 7, 8, 2, 8, 7, 4, 3]
```

```
sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod import slow_lucas
sage: [slow_lucas(i, Mod(8,11)) for i in range(15)]
[2, 8, 7, 4, 3, 9, 3, 4, 7, 8, 2, 8, 7, 4, 3]

Add the patches for function `lucas(k,p,q,n)` which generates Lucas sequence V_k mod n (k >= 0) defined by `V_k = PV_{k-1} - QV_{k-2} with V_0 = 2 and V_1 = P`.

Tests::

```
        sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod import lucas
        sage: p = randint(0,100000)
        sage: q = randint(0,100000)
        sage: n = randint(0,100)
        sage: all([lucas(k,p,q,n)[0] == Mod(lucas_number2(k,p,q),n)
        ...        for k in Integers(20)])
        True
```

```
        sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod import lucas
        sage: p = randint(0,100000)
        sage: q = randint(0,100000)
        sage: n = randint(0,100)
        sage: k = randint(0,100)
        sage: lucas(k,p,q,n) == [Mod(lucas_number2(k,p,q),n),Mod(q^(int(k/2)),n)]
        True
```

Examples::

```
        sage: [lucas(k,4,5,11)[0] for k in range(30)]
        [2, 4, 6, 4, 8, 1, 8, 5, 2, 5, 10, 4, 10, 9, 8, 9, 7, 5, 7, 3, 10, 3, 6, 9, 6, 1, 7, 1, 2, 3]

        sage: lucas(20,4,5,11)
        [10, 1]
```

The code looks ok to me.

Not sure that we should keep both the code in fast_lucas just for the case Q=1 and lucas function for the generic case.

Of course the specialized version for Q=1 is faster, so it might be a reason to keep it, even if I'm more inclined not to.

I provided two "reviewer" patches and if Robert has any preference, let him decide.

If they do not do the same job already.\n\nPerhaps it would even be better to change the current `lucas_*` functions so that one can compute the numbers themselves, or modulo something depending on the input.\n\nThen again, having `slow_lucas`, `fast_lucas` and `lucas` definitely looks too much. Couldn't all three implementations be available in the same function ? With a flag to decide which one should be used ? All the code could be in the same function by the way..\n\nAnd well. Given that this code is 2yo, perhaps an email should be sent to sage-devel to find guys who know what this code does and review it. 2years is a long time `^^;`\n\nNathann",

Well I know absolutely nothing about Lucas number, so I do not know how useful this is when `Q=1` `O_o`

This being said, it looks like there are two `lucas_*` functions in combinat 

```
sage: sage.combinat.combinat.lucas_number1
<function sage.combinat.combinat.lucas_number1>
sage: sage.combinat.combinat.lucas_number2
<function sage.combinat.combinat.lucas_number2>
```
And all lucas functions should probably be linked toward each other (with `.. seealso::` sections) if not implemented at the same place. If they do not do the same job already.

Perhaps it would even be better to change the current `lucas_*` functions so that one can compute the numbers themselves, or modulo something depending on the input.

Then again, having `slow_lucas`, `fast_lucas` and `lucas` definitely looks too much. Couldn't all three implementations be available in the same function ? With a flag to decide which one should be used ? All the code could be in the same function by the way..

And well. Given that this code is 2yo, perhaps an email should be sent to sage-devel to find guys who know what this code does and review it. 2years is a long time `^^;`

<div id="comment:10" align="right">comment:10</div>

Here's a branch version of this (no rebasing was required) and I fixed up some docstring formatting and deprecated `slow_lucas()` (see below).

Currently in Sage, `slow_lucas` uses the recursive definition which works for arbitrary integers, whereas the fast `Q=1` and general both only work in modular arithmetic? Although from the code, there doesn't seem to be anything that explicitly uses `n`, so I would (naively) think that this could work for general integers. I haven't tested this; please correct me if I'm wrong. Also I vote to keep the specialized `Q=1` implementation since it is faster.

I've deprecated `slow_lucas` since the more general `BinaryRecurrenceSequence` is faster:

```
sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod import slow_lucas
sage: %timeit L = [slow_lucas(k,1,-1) for k in range(20)]
10 loops, best of 3: 16.4 ms per loop
sage: %timeit L = [slow_lucas(k,1,-1) for k in range(20)]
10 loops, best of 3: 16 ms per loop

sage: %timeit B = BinaryRecurrenceSequence(1, 1, 2, 1)
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.67 us per loop
sage: B = BinaryRecurrenceSequence(1, 1, 2, 1)
sage: %timeit LB = [B(k) for k in range(20)]
1 loops, best of 3: 15.1 ms per loop
sage: %timeit LB = [B(k) for k in range(20)] # There's caching going on
100 loops, best of 3: 7.7 ms per loop
```

Best,

Travis

Thanks for the gitification.

I'm mostly happy with the code.
And with Travis changes.
Let's keep the two fast functions and deprecate the slow one.
I just think we should rename the fast_lucas function to something like lucas_q1.

sorry with the change to git I am unable to figure out what is the diff with respect to Sage 6.0.
Thus I can only give general comments:

1) it makes no sense to have a `slow_lucas` and a `fast_lucas` function. The philosophy in Sage is to use `algorithm='recurrence'` or `algorithm='matrix_exponentiation'` instead (for example).

2) I don't see why the case Q<>1 could not be implemented either by the recurrence or the matrix
exponentiation.

3) instead of separate functions for ZZ and IntegerModRing(n), it would be nicer to have a single function with an option `ring=ZZ` (default) and `ring=IntegerModRing(15)`.
