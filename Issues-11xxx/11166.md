`base_field` became `base_ring`...  it is very funny this bug never made things go bad.

```
sage: from sage.modules.free_module import FreeModule_generic_field
sage: FreeModule_generic_field(QQ, 5, 5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NameError: global name 'base_ring' is not defined
```

And in the code:

```
class FreeModule_generic_field(FreeModule_generic_pid):
    ...
    def `__init__`(self, base_field, dimension, degree, sparse=False):
        ...
        FreeModule_generic_pid.__init__(self, base_ring, dimension, degree, sparse=sparse)
```

As the creation is done with a factory, this bug is invisible from the user. But, if you want to build your own `FreeModule` over a field with category and some other stuff, calling the `__init__` of this class make me fall on the bug.

Will see what the builbot will say...

This fixed :

This looks all ready to go.  Passes long tests on 4.7.1.alpha4.  So positive review.

Quite amazing this didn't crop up sooner!

I think both patches need their commit string edited, I am going to put up corrected versions.
