[This problem was mentioned to me by Thorsten Kleinjung.]

Consider a file `b.sage` containing a single line `sigma = 111...111` with 200000 ones, and another file `c.sage` with
400000 ones. Then with Sage 4.7:

```
sage: t=cputime()
sage: load b.sage
sage: cputime(t)
1.7999999999999998
sage: t=cputime()
sage: load c.sage
sage: cputime(t)
6.7800000000000011
```

Magma V2.17-7 reads the 400000-digit integer in about 80ms, i.e.,
about 85 times faster than Sage. I consider this as a defect.

I think it's python's string-to-int routine, which we hit because preparsing transforms

If instead we do
"100" :-> "Integer('100')" we don't observe the slowdown:

- fix python's string-to-int to run in O(input size)
- change the preparser to generate Integer('100') instead of Integer(1000)
Option number one has the biggest benefit because that has a chance of improving python for everyone.

Have you already identified Python's bad code?

Most probably the easiest (or quickest) way to fix this, though we have different source files for the preparser code (IIRC) which always have to be kept in sync, which is odd as well. (And the preparser is subject to other changes, too.)

I did not know Python doesn't support base-1 representation...

Do we have direct conversion routines Python long <-> `mpz_t` / `mpn_t`?

If we only changed `Integer(N)` to `Integer("N")`, "raw" integers wouldn't benefit, which have other advantages.

Yes, that is what I thought as well. However even in GMP/MPIR they only think it's worth switching algorithm for 4000+ digits. I would not expect Python maintainers to be very interested in optimizing for such a rare situation.

There is a much easier workaround, though: Write your integers base 2,4,8,16 (or even 32). The 16 is probably most straightforward, because literals are automatically recognised when prefixed by "0x". It's a much more efficient way of storing integers and a 4000 digit number is going to be meaningless to the human eye anyway. This is really *much* faster:

```
sage: for j in range(10):
....:        s = "0x"+'1'*(100000*2^j)
....:        t = cputime()
....:        si = eval(s)
....:        cputime(t)
0.0019989999999978636
0.0020000000000095497
0.0019999999999953388
0.0049989999999979773
0.012997999999996068
0.025995999999992137
0.05199300000001017
0.099985000000003765
0.19696999999999321
0.38994000000000995
```
So my proposal: Document that if people want to store long numbers, they should do so in hex. Mention that "Integer(<string>)" is asymptotically faster that "int(<string>)" and that the preparser turns "<literal>" into something equivalent to "Integer(int(<string>))".

No serious computer algebra package would *require* users to write inputs\n> in hexadecimal.\n\n\nI didn't mean the documentation addition as a joke and I didn't mean it as a requirement. Just a tip to get better performance, and that tip will apply even if we can get reading decimal integer representations faster.\n\nIt's the Python routine that is less-than-optimal here. If we can fix that and get it accepted upstream: Great! However, CPython is meant to be general purpose, so doesn't want good MPint performance at all cost (otherwise they would have moved to GMP already), so our patch would have to be clean and concise as well.\n\nPatching Python with something that won't be accepted upstream is probably worse than the disease. Projects like sage-on-gentoo etc. are definitely not going to be happy with it.\n\nI realized we cannot change the preparser to do \"100\":->\"Integer('100')\" in general. Currently, the \"100\" in \"Integer(100)\" gets converted to an integer constant *at compile time*. Quoting it would trigger a string-to-int conversion *at run time*. `preparse_file` alleviates this somewhat by pushing constant definitions outside of loops, but the principle remains. \n\nThe workaround for the example in the report at the moment is:\n\n```\nsigma=Integer(file('b.sage').read()[7:])\n```\nIn the presence of Python's suboptimal behaviour, \"load\" simply optimizes for a different use-case (by preferring to translate via Python's \"int\").

I didn't mean the documentation addition as a joke and I didn't mean it as a requirement. Just a tip to get better performance, and that tip will apply even if we can get reading decimal integer representations faster.

It's the Python routine that is less-than-optimal here. If we can fix that and get it accepted upstream: Great! However, CPython is meant to be general purpose, so doesn't want good MPint performance at all cost (otherwise they would have moved to GMP already), so our patch would have to be clean and concise as well.

Patching Python with something that won't be accepted upstream is probably worse than the disease. Projects like sage-on-gentoo etc. are definitely not going to be happy with it.

I realized we cannot change the preparser to do "100":->"Integer('100')" in general. Currently, the "100" in "Integer(100)" gets converted to an integer constant *at compile time*. Quoting it would trigger a string-to-int conversion *at run time*. `preparse_file` alleviates this somewhat by pushing constant definitions outside of loops, but the principle remains. 

The workaround for the example in the report at the moment is:

```
sigma=Integer(file('b.sage').read()[7:])
```
In the presence of Python's suboptimal behaviour, "load" simply optimizes for a different use-case (by preferring to translate via Python's "int"). Actually, that is a wrong optimization! "load <file>.sage" never leads to a ".pyc" file, so "compile" and "run" time are never separate.

So perhaps
`sage.misc.preparser.preparse_file` needs a third state for "numeric_literals" which makes integer constants convert via strings? This option would be safe if preparse/compile/run are guaranteed to only occur together. Some experiments would quickly show if this should be done to all integer literals or just those of certain minimum length. I wouldn't dare to touch the preparser but someone else might.
