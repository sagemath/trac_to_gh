One of the best fractals for actually finding out *new* things is looking at [Newton basins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_fractal) - see [David Joyce's beautiful generator](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/newton/newtongen.html), for instance.

This is not yet in Sage.   It should be, and isn't that hard to get a rough mockup by modifying the complex plot code.

Here is how I envision one using the current file.
* Download the raw file.
* Cut and paste the entire file into one notebook cell.
* Prepend the line `%cython` to the cell.
* Evaluate.
* Have fun!

With this code, the next picture attached gives at least something recognizable after a few minutes.  It needs MUCH more efficient use of Cython, primarily; the algorithm is right, as far as I can tell, except maybe the counter can be ditched or needs to be improved.

The [attachment:cubicbasin.png picture] is of the fractal associated with `(x^2-1)(x-I)`. The code is

```
basin_plot([-1,i,1],(-3,3),(-3,3),plot_points=100,figsize=7)
```
Note that the documentation in the spyx file is all wrong.  This is VERY rough, as noted above. 

Feedback welcome!

If you evaluate the contents of your spyx file in a %cython cell in the notebook, you will find two links just below the cell. The first contains the c-file created from the cython code. The second is the annotated version of the code. 

I suggest to look at the annotated code. The lines of the cython code are individually coloured in different shades of yellow. If a line is very dark then the single cython line corresponds to *many* c-lines. By clicking on the line number, you can see how each line is translated into c.

You will find that your code is mostly dark yellow. If you want to make it fast, the lines that are most frequently executed should be white.

Another tool: Use %prun on your functions (but it could be that it will only work on the command line - I tried in the notebook, but it didn't work). It will show you the internal Python function calls that took the most time (I think it can not show you calls to Cython functions). So, %prun may give you an idea what part of your code needs work most urgently.

Using 

```
sage: %prun basin_plot([-1,i,1],(-3,3),(-3,3),plot_points=100,figsize=7)
```
on the command line, where I had replaces `2/3` by `2./3` in the code, I found:

Simon,

Thanks for the prun tip - I had forgotten about that.  I'm certainly aware of the yellow html :) but unfortunately it was nearly ALL yellow and I'm not sure how to effectively Cythonize much of it, hence my email to sage-devel/edu.  

Just adding cdefs is, in my experience, a recipe for disaster.

Also interesting about the prun.  This is mostly just taken from the complex plot stuff, but prunning (?) that shows just a couple calls to complex intervals.  I assume it is mostly happening in the `which_root`, maybe `if abs(varia-root)<2/3`.  I don't like all the calls to `isinstance` and the polynomial ring consructors, either.    Someone who understands how `fast_callable` constructs things better might be able to help, too :(

Thank you!

Replying to [kcrisman](#comment%3A4):

That's true. One first needs to have a good guess what yellow code is most frequently executed. %prun might indicate where the problem is hidden, and the annotation indicates how to get rid of it.
 
> Also interesting about the prun.  This is mostly just taken from the complex plot stuff, but prunning (?) that shows just a couple calls to complex intervals.  I assume it is mostly happening in the `which_root`, maybe `if abs(varia-root)<2/3`.


It makes sense to try that separately. I.e., %prun one call to `which_root`.

>  I don't like all the calls to `isinstance` and the polynomial ring consructors, either.


Yes. They are irritating. I am rather sure that `isinstance` is called in things like `sage.rings.ring.is_Ring` or so.

>    Someone who understands how `fast_callable` constructs things better might be able to help, 


Sorry, `fast_callable` is a mystery to me.

Here are some more detailed remarks on the code:

* In `which_root`, the expression `abs(varia-root)` seems to be rather expensive. If you know the type of `varia` and `root` and if you know how `abs` is computed for that type, you may help the compiler. See below: Indeed that seems to be part of the problem.
* Since `which_root` is frequently called, it would make sense to improve the inner loop:

 ```
 cdef int counter
 for counter from 0<=counter<20:
     varia = newtf(varia)
     ...
 ```
* Again, since `which_root is frequently called, it would make sense to reveal that `roots` is a list (could be done in the argument line of `basin_plot`).
* I just tested that one gets

 ```
 AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'variables'
 ```
 when trying to create `f1` as a fast callable. I don't know how that can be worked around.
* The strange calls to complex interval field and so on really occur when you do `varia-root`. This is because varia is a complex double, but root (depending on the input) may be a symbolic expression. In the application, you have

 ```
 sage: roots = [-1,i,1]
 sage: prefunc = prod([(x-root) for root in roots])
 sage: newtf = fast_callable(newt(prefunc), domain=CDF, expect_one_var=True)
 sage: varia = newtf(roots[1])
 sage: root = roots[1]
 sage: type(varia)

 ```

So, it would make sense to first convert the given roots to complex doubles. If that isn't good enough, one may even cdef them as such. And, in addition, cythonise the innermost loop. I'll soon test if it helps...

I just attached [attachment:newton_basins_more_cython.spyx], which improves the timing by a factor of almost 100:

With the original version of the code together with the `2./3`, I get

```
sage: %time basin_plot([-1,i,1],(-3,3),(-3,3),plot_points=100,figsize=7)
CPU times: user 13.70 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 13.70 s
Wall time: 13.74 s
```

With the code that I just attached, I get

```
sage: %time basin_plot([-1,i,1],(-3,3),(-3,3),plot_points=100,figsize=7)
CPU times: user 0.15 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.15 s
Wall time: 0.15 s
```

How is that done?

Apparently, the optimization should mainly take place in `which_root`. Since it is not possible to turn it into a fast_callable, I cythonised it instead. More precisely, I introduced a cdef'd class `RootFinder`, that carries all relevant data (the list of roots, the function newtf and also the cutoff 2/3) as a cdef'd attribute.

Originally, the function f1 is a lambda function (slow!) that calls the Python function `which_root` (slow!) by providing two arguments, where the first argument is always the same (redundant!). I replaced it by the method `Finder.which_root`, where `Finder` is an appropriate instance of `RootFinder`.

Inside `which_root`, further improvements happened:
* First of all, the list of roots is transformed into a list of complex doubles (because, in your original example, the complex unit `i` is a symbolic expression, not a complex double, which was responsible for the slowness).
* Moreover, Cython is informed that the list of roots is a list, and that both the root and "varia" are complex doubles.
* We know that all our complex doubles have the same parent. Hence, we avoid the parental tests that are part of `__sub__` and call `_sub_` instead (single underscore).
* Since the `counter` loop is rather tight, `counter` is declared as an int.

Okay, now I have something very naive with iterations.  Picture (same code) [attachment:WithIterations.png here] and code [attachment:newton_basins_with_iterations.spyx here]. 

Caveats:
* I am pretty sure that the lightness thing could be improved - there are infinitely many functions to pick from, and messing with the one from `complex_plot` didn't help in my first tries.
* The way the alpha is used is almost assuredly inefficient.  Ideally we would have a 'master list' of the roots and then one would search for one of the n times 20 combinations of root and iteration level, and assign a color to that from the 'master list' (dictionary?) instead of multiplying by alpha 3 times for every single point!
* Probably the way I just slapped in a tuple for the new output of the `which_root` is inefficient too - presumably one could at least define the type coming out of it, if not find some better way to represent it.
* The exact (blue) circle in the picture, which is not flush with the second iteration ellipse, probably indicates that the way the iterations are determined is too aggressive/not aggressive enough (not sure which).

But it does work, and even looks somewhat decent.  Can't compete with Java yet, but it would be really nice to have this in Sage.

I have attached [attachment:newton_basins_with_iterations_and_double.spyx.txt]. I am sorry that I have not been aware of Windows' automatic name extension (I don't usually write texts under windows), and also I hope that it did not use any fancy format.

Also I just noticed that the first line of the file contains %cython - of course that needs to be removed if you want to attach it.

Anyway. The trick is to define `self.cutoff = 4./9`, and to use a temporary `cdef ComplexDoubleElement diff = varia._sub_(root)`, so that `(diff._complex.dat[0]**2 + diff._complex.dat[1]**2) < self.cutoff` is fairly cheap.

Here are the data on sagenb:

```
%time
basin_plot([-1,1,3],(-.2,.1),(-.1,.1),plot_points=1000,figsize=7)
CPU time: 15.59 s,  Wall time: 15.60 s
```
The same computation with the first "iteration" code takes `CPU time: 24.15 s,  Wall time: 24.17 s`.

I found this ticket when googling for Sage functionality to plot Newton basins. I guess this ticket has been abandoned, but just in case it's useful to anyone else that finds this, I've just attached [attachment:newton_basins_with_iterations_and_double.spyx] which updates this (mainly by adding / changing the imported modules) so that it works with my [SageMath](SageMath) 8.2 (in the jupyter notebook on Mac OS X 10.13.4).

Indeed. Even after reading the attachment that I supplied, I don't recognise that I wrote it. So, total amnesia.

What would be the plan?

The fact that the attachment is a .spyx file means that it used to be an experimental piece of code that people could play with by attaching it. In order to create a proper branch, it would be needed to find a folder in sage/src/ where the code could fit. And so far I am not sure where it could belong.

It could perhaps be classified as "educational". But do we have a dedicated folder for educational stuff?

However, what I meant by asking you was whether you had already reviewed some of the code in said .spyx file.  If not, that is fine, just checking.
