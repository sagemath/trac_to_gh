Sage should allow the use of degrees as well as radians. This could work by bringing the degree unit into the main namespace, and modifying trigonometric functions to convert from degrees to radians before evaluating, such that

```
sage: n(sin(90 * degree))
```

would return 1.

As well, perhaps there could be a global setting that assumed degrees instead of radians.
