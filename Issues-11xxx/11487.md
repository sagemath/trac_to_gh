I added "graphs/graph_plot.py" to the reference manual, and fixed many syntax errors (particularly bulleted lists). 



However, one error persists when building the documentation, and I have been unable to fix it.

 `<autodoc>:0: ERROR: Unexpected indentation.`

I added the line break, and the documentation now builds without error. 

First, apply


`trac_11487_graphPlotReferenceAddition.patch`


and then apply


`trac_11487_linebreakInsertionFix.patch`

John, thank you for finding that problem!
