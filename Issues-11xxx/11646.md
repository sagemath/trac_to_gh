Assignee: @aghitza

I am working on implementing significance arithmetic in Sage (i.e., maintaining significant digits under arithmetic operations). This can be accomplished through a special structure which, upon instantiation, determines the amount of sig. figs and coerces into a RealField.

For example,

```
sage: SF('787') * SF('3.0')
2.4e3
```

Shouldn't the result display as something like `2.4 * 10^3` (`2.4e3`) or `24 * 10^2` (`24e2`)?

Yes, that's correct. I will fix it.

Check out python's `decimal` module. It might already provide what you are looking for.

Not quite. It does not preserve significant figures in multiplication; 1.30 * 1.20 gives 1.5600.

That is a surprising implementation choice. It looks like the precision is again just part of the context, not of a particular number.
