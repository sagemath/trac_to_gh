I am working on implementing significance arithmetic in Sage (i.e., maintaining significant digits under arithmetic operations). This can be accomplished through a special structure which, upon instantiation, determines the amount of sig. figs and coerces into a RealField.

For example,

```
sage: SF('787') * SF('3.0')
2.4e3
```

Check out python's `decimal` module. It might already provide what you are looking for.
