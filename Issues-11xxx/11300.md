That is a very good remark !

If yes this can be corrected by changing `default=0` to
`default=Integer(0)`.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Hello Jason. I'm curious: did you compare timings of using the try-except statement:

```
 	768	        try: 
 	769	            return self[i] 
 	770	        except IndexError: 
 	771	            return default
```
with an if statement, like this one:

```
    if i < len(self._list):
        return self._list[i]
    else: 
        return default
```
I would guess that try-except statements are slower, but I have not tried it.
