The one issue with this is the following:

```
sage: p = Partition([4,3])
sage: type(p.get_part(0))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: type(p.get_part(10))
<type 'int'>
```

Is there a use case for a changeable default value?

That is a very good remark !

If yes this can be corrected by changing `default=0` to
`default=Integer(0)`.

I've changed the default value to Integer(0). I don't have a specific use case for another value, but it seems like it might come in handy. Do you have a reason you think it's a bad idea? I could probably be convinced to get rid of it.

Hello Jason. I'm curious: did you compare timings of using the try-except statement:

```
 	768	        try: 
 	769	            return self[i] 
 	770	        except IndexError: 
 	771	            return default
```
with an if statement, like this one:

```
    if i < len(self._list):
        return self._list[i]
    else: 
        return default
```
I would guess that try-except statements are slower, but I have not tried it.

I tried it and you're right--'if' is significantly faster. I've replaced the patch.
