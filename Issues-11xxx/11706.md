**New spkg: http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/tachyon-0.98.9.p5.spkg** (based on the p4 from #11504)

**md5sum:** `72fa42f730cc7d65c53ab80970a5d35a  tachyon-0.98.9.p5.spkg`


### tachyon-0.98.9.p5 (William Stein and Leif Leonhardy, August 19th 2011)
* #11706: Make package build on 64-bit PPC Linux, too (by using the `linux-ppc`
  `make` target, which works for ppc64 as well).
* Check exit codes of `cp`, especially in the last case where the built
  Tachyon executable gets installed. Also use `cp -p` (and `-f`) there, to
  avoid permission issues in multi-user environments.
* Quote all instances of `$UNAME`.
* Copy / install `tachyon.exe` (instead of `tachyon`) on Cygwin.
* Make `spkg-install` executable.
* Fix all file permissions (see Special Update/Build Instructions).
* Fix mark-up of headings of changelog entries.
* Minor cosmetic clean-up.

I cannot test whether the spkg actually builds on that platform, otherwise positive review for the spkg (i.e., it's "clean" and the change doesn't affect any other platform).

Although I'd change the following comment in `spkg-install`:

```sh
        *) # e.g. ppc64
```

(And the subsequent `if [ "$UNAME" = ... ]; then ...` aren't very nice. I'd use `case "$UNAME" in ...` or at least `elif ...` instead, as mentioned on earlier tickets.)

P.S., for the record:

This:

```sh
   ...
   cp compile/*/tachyon "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin"
   exit 0
```
should also be

```sh
   ...
   cp compile/*/tachyon "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin"
   exit $?
```
An appropriate error message in case `cp` failed would be better. The exit codes of other `cp` commands aren't checked either.

(This has been in before of course.)

I agree with Leif that this needs work for fixing the comment about ppc64, which apparently does now work :)   I don't know about the "please complain on sage-devel" comment, either; that could be more precise.  

I do think that the "not very nice" things Leif mentioned can be left to another ticket, though.

1. I agree with kcrisman that those other changes Leif mentions should be on another ticket.  

2. "(and might I note for a rather more important platform than PPC Linux)."   Not to minimize the importance of a Windows port, but there is nobody providing any financial support for porting Sage to Cygwin.  There is very substantial financial support coming from the folks that want a PPC Linux port -- it is thus "rather more important".

Replying to [kcrisman](#comment%3A5):
> I do think that the "not very nice" things Leif mentioned can be left to another ticket, though.


Agreed, with the exception of the `exit 0` regardless of whether the installation (the final `cp`) succeeded or not.

I guess the spkg needs work for Darwin, too, (on a follow-up) anyway, because of

```sh
if [ $UNAME = "Darwin" ]; then
    #make macosx-thr
    # The threaded version of the 0.98 beta doesn't work on OS X.
    if [ "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
        echo "Building 64 bit MaxOSX"
        $MAKE macosx-64
    else
        $MAKE macosx
    fi
    finished
fi
```
(The mentioned beta version is of years ago. I also did not know *MaxOSX*.)

Haven't looked at #11504 yet; will try to review it [as is] if I find the time... ;)

If it helps make the decision, I already fixed the "MaxOSX" issue :) though not the "0.98 beta" issue :(

New p5 spkg based on Karl-Dieter's p4 from #11504 is up (see ticket's descriptions).

Took a bit longer because I had to check and fix another Cygwin issue.


I've only fixed the [IMHO] most important issues (and also cleaned up a little), but added TODOs for and comments on the remaining things, to be done on follow-up tickets.
