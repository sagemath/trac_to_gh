sage raises an error when trying to count the number of points of a subscheme of an affine scheme.

See, for instance:


```

sage: A=AffineSpace(F,2)
sage: I=R.ideal(x^2-y^2-1)
sage: S=A.subscheme(I)
sage: S.count_points(2)

The patch makes sense, it fixes a bug in the method points() of the class SchemeHomset_affine_coordinates. 

Note: the same typo (Z instead of ZZ) seems to occur in the method points() of the class SchemeHomset_projective_coordinates_ring, which is not implemented yet.

Apply trac_11526_final.patch

Tested against sage-4.8.alpha3 and doctests pass.

[attachment:trac_11526_final.patch] is identical to [trac_11526_bugfix_with_docstring.2.patch] except for the commit message which I replaced with something that makes hopefully more sense to somebody who does not know this ticket. 

We still don't have a docstring for SchemeHomset?_projective_coordinates_ring.points() but I guess that is acceptable since there wasn't any before and it's not implemented anyway.

I'm unsure if "Reviewers" should only mention the person who clicked "positive review" or everybody who was part of the review process. Anyway, I added some authors and reviewers, I hope nobody minds.

Btw. davideklund, your name is not in the AccountNamesMappedtoRealNames on the trac wiki start page.

I fixed this long ago in #11599 which also contains some other important additions IMHO. I think it would be more productive if somebody could review #11599.
