There is no easy way to re-enable the warning after it has been shown once. A typical use case is that you have a mistake in your fan data and you want to fix it. The fact that the warning for duplicate cones is only shown once in the Sage session is very annoying.

Hi Volker, sorry for the delay - travel/jetlag/work ;-)

Discarding faces and repeated cones is quite natural when they come from some construction and I have already wished a few times that it would be possible to drop them without using `check=True` option which does much more work. In fact, that's the reason why there is a function `discard_faces`. So I propose this patch which adds a `discard_faces=False` keyword which works independently of `check`. I have also fixed the code and documentation pieces that were relying on the old behaviour, I don't get now any errors for tests in geometry or schemes directories.
