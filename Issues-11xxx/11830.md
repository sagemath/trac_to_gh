Using sage-4.7.2.alpha2 and the hg shipped with Sage, I cannot push the patch `trac_11820_undo_4777.patch` of ticket #11820 because the username contains utf-8 non-ASCII characters:

```
$ hg qpush
applying trac_11820_undo_4777.patch
transaction abort!
rollback completed
cleaning up working directory...done
abort: decoding near 'AndrÃ© Apitzsc': 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 4: ordinal not in range(128)!
```

A solution is to set `HGENCODING=utf8` in `sage-env`.

Oh yes, this seems to catch all situations where we could run into this.

(We would have had to change the Sage library's `hg_*` commands as well if we only changed e.g. `sage-sage`.)

Will test this later.




P.S:: The commit message lacks a ticket number... ;-)

Perhaps my bad, I'm not aware of such an agreement, but I strongly object.




> Ticket numbers are added automatically by my merger script.


As I already said elsewhere, this ignores the fact that there's sometimes a tiny period of time between when a patch gets attached to a ticket and when it gets merged into a release (and this release published).




> This simplifies the work of the release manager, who no longer has to complain about missing ticket numbers.


Well, he/she doesn't have to; reviewers IMHO should. Same for *filenames* of patches *not* containing the ticket number.

(Btw., also the patchbot could complain about things like these, including missing or misspelled author and reviewer names on a ticket.)




> It also ensures a common formatting for the ticket number: the commit message always starts with "Trac #${TICKET_NUMBER}: " which might be useful for scripts.


That's just a matter of how smart the scripts are, including the merge scripts themselves.

Besides that I don't like that long form; I also noticed that a couple of commit messages get this prepended despite already containing the ticket number, or even starting with it (which they IMHO always should, since a commit message might reference other tickets as well).

If you want a *unique* form (which I'd consider unnecessary because scripts can easily recognize different, preferably nevertheless standardized variants), at least ticket numbers shouldn't get duplicated in the commit messages.

And why is this a problem?

It was suggested by other people and I implemented it, see [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-devel/9anAEvYpmp4/3PJ67hvJA_YJ](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-devel/9anAEvYpmp4/3PJ67hvJA_YJ)

I certainly see more advantages than disadvantages to this so I would like to keep this convention.  I you want to discuss it further, it should probably be done on `sage-devel`.
