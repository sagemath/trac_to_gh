When compiling with gcc, PolyBoRi generates position independent code because of the compiler flag -fPIC. It does this on Solaris, and I expect Linux and OS X too. 

However, on Solaris PolyBoRi also generates the compiler flag "`-KPIC`" which is the flag used by Sun (now Oracle) compilers to generate position independent code. GCC has always ignored this flag. However, the latest gcc does not, and considers this an error. 

```
g++ -o Cudd/obj/cuddObj.pic.o -c -O3 -Wno-long-long -Wreturn-type -g -fPIC -ftemplate-depth-100 -O3 -Wno-long-long -Wreturn-type -g -fPIC -KPIC -DNDEBUG -DHAVE_GD -DHAVE_TR1_UNORDERED_MAP -DPACKED -DHAVE_M4RI -DHAVE_GD -DHAVE_IEEE_754 -DBSD -I/export/home/drkirkby/sage-new-gcc/sage-4.7.alpha2/local/include -I/export/home/drkirkby/sage-new-gcc/sage-4.7.alpha2/local/include/python2.6 -Ipolybori/include -ICudd/obj -ICudd/util -ICudd/cudd -ICudd/mtr -ICudd/st -ICudd/epd Cudd/obj/cuddObj.cc
g++: error: unrecognized option '-KPIC'
scons: *** [Cudd/obj/cuddObj.pic.o] Error 1
scons: building terminated because of errors.
Error building PolyBoRi.
```

I found this on OpenSolaris, but I'm 99% sure the same would happen on Solaris, since I know the option "`-KPIC`" has always been there on both systems. 

I'm cc'ing the PolyBoRi developers.

gcc on t2.math works fine. William did break it, but I fixed ages ago. t2.math is regularly used to build Sage with the buildbot. It was last built successufully on 20<sup>th</sup> March - only 10 days ago. 

http://build.sagemath.org/sage/buildslaves/t2-1

I just put a note in `/etc/motd` to add this to ones `$HOME/.profile`

```
. /usr/local/bin/t2-setup
```

However, there is currently no gcc-4.6.0 on there, but it should be possible to see if the patch removes the -KPIC option. 

Do you want an account on my Sun Ultra 27? That runs OpenSolaris, not Solaris and is x86 not SPARC.

Although there are some differences, most things are the same. The advantage of that machine is that it is much faster than t2.math. You can build Sage and run all the long doctests in little over an hour if the machine is idle.
