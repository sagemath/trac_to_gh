In order to get a current CPLEX to work with Sage, I had to add one more symbolic link to `SAGE_ROOT/local/include/` than the directions at http://www.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/linear_programming.html#installing-cplex indicated:

```
ln -s /path/to/include/cpxconst.h .
```

Without this, `sage -b` complained about that file missing.  With this new symbolic link, `sage -b` succeeds and I can solve an example problem with cplex.

So the docs probably should be updated.

I have been using CPLEX for (almost) years and I never met that. `O_o`

Which kind of version of it do you use ? `O_o`

Hello,

I'm able to install correctly the patch on sage-5.0.beta9, and it is very useful when you want to use cplex 12.4.

It took me some time to understand that I add to type `sage -docbuild thematic_tutorials html` for building the doc.

Thanks for the patch!

David.
