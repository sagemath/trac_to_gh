So what do you expect the result types to be?

IMHO the fact that `3r^3` yields a Python `int` is pretty correct; with negative exponents the interpretation is less straightforward.

I'd interpret `int(x)^(-any)` as `(int(1)/int(x))^(any)`, so the result should be `float` if `any` is positive.

in all other operations (see the ticket description), 
the Sage type takes the precedence over Python. I certainly don't mind `int(3)^int(3)` being int though.
in fact, with the patch applied, the behaviour is as follows:

```
sage: type(int(3)^3)
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: type(int(3)^int(3))
<type 'int'>
sage: type(int(3)^int(-3))
<type 'float'>
sage: type(int(3)^-3)
<type 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'> 
```

this is the behaviour that is much less confusing.

Exponentiation is different, i.e., the *type* of the exponent doesn't matter at all, only its value.

Why should one?




> in fact, with the patch applied, the behaviour is as follows:


```
 ...
 sage: type(int(3)^3)
 <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
 ...
```
which is simply wrong, because `3r^3` is `3r * 3r * 3r`, so the type of the result should be the *base's* type (unless the result is not an integer, in which case Python's rules should apply, leading to a `float` result.)

The following is equally wrong for the same reason. (**This** is a bug.)

Less confusing to whom? Honestly, every school child should know the difference.

Ok, one could argue that `3r * 3` could be interpreted as `3r + 3r + 3r` as well (leading to result type `int` rather than `Integer`), but this would break commutativity.


Worth a discussion on sage-devel... (quite curious of the opinions :P )

 sage: type(int(3)^-3)
 <type 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'> 
```

I meant `type(int(3)^QQ(-3))` not being `float` is a bug (currently in Sage).

We furthermore currently have:

```
sage: type(int(3)^QQ(-3))
<type 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>
sage: type(int(3)^ZZ(-3))
<type 'float'>
```
which is obviously inconsistent, where IMHO the latter *is* correct, but not the former.

(Nevertheless, I *know* mathematicians tend to care less about types... ;-) )

I agree with leif. I think any in "int(3)^any" should be converted to an integer n (or -n), and then int(3)^any equals int(3) multiplied n times with itself (or numerical inverse of int(3) multiplied n times with itself). Thus int(3)^any is of type float always. If any cannot be converted to an integer, then an exception should be raised.

Thus int(3)^3, int(3)^QQ(3), int(3)^ZZ(3), int(3)^CC(3) all results in Pythonic integer 27. int(3)^-3, int(3)^QQ(-3), int(3)^ZZ(-3), int(3)^CC(-3) all results in Pythonic float 0.037037037037037028. 

By the way, I think there is nothing wrong with this

```
sage: p(x)=x^-3
sage: p(int(3))
1/27
```
because int(3) is converted to a Sage expression first. See

```
sage: q(x)=x
sage: type(q(int(3)))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```

So I think this ticket and the patch is misdirected.

What do you mean by "numerical inverse", and why you think this is the right precedence for operations? Leif here gives arguments based on algebraic properties, so it should be, for algebraic consistency that he cares about so much, that `int(3)<sup>-3==int(1)/int(3)</sup>3`, but this is

What makes you think I meant Python's broken `/` operator on `int`s? As I said on sage-devel, the behaviour of that operator on `int`s is useless since there's explicit truncating integer division already, namely `//`.

> I advocate the rule that a binary operation involving a Sage integer and a Python int should always produce a Sage type, as this is the case with all the other binary operations.


The notion of "binary operations" has no meaning in this context, as the desired behaviour w.r.t. result types should depend on the definition of the function, especially its commonly used signature, not its arity.

For exponentiation, the *type* of the exponent is irrelevant, only its *value* matters to deduce the type of the result of the operation, just like for shift operations (which of course aren't commutative either).

Or would you say `type( value << shift )` should depend on the type of `shift`?

This might perhaps look "consistent" from a syntactical point of view, but simply isn't sound, i.e. doesn't make any sense in the semantic domain.  

> To me, your and Leif's arguments read as "I prefer the status quo to making Sage a more consistent system".


Definitely not, since there are a lot of inconsistencies already which should IMHO be fixed, but not in the way you propose.

well, being an algebraist by training and active in this research area for over 20 years, I tend to think that I know how to distinguish a binary operation from something else. And in my (not so in this case) humble opinion I think that exponentiation is a binary operation in this case.

it can, potentially; e.g. when shifting is not understood in a narrow context of binary words.

are dazed and confused by this inconsistency, among others. And I am merely trying to make Sage easier to use for them on this ticket.

The right direction for beginners is to let them know the difference between `int(3)` and `3` (Sage Integer) and that `3` behaves more mathematically than `int(3)` which suffers from numerical treatment.
