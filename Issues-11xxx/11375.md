Craig Citro sent me some much faster code.  See attached patch.  He says "i need to just yank the testing stuff in that patch and
it's probably ready to submit.

interestingly/sadly the tests i ran had that code spending ~15-20% of
its time computing the coefficients, and ~80-85% converting them and
copying them around multiple times. depending on what you want to do
with it, it's definitely plausible to push it quite a bit more.

i think the current setup is good enough for some stuff, but honestly,
if i ever get a chance to work on some of the stuff i originally wrote
that code for ... i'm probably just going to rewrite it in C/C++ and
link directly against gmp/zn_poly. ;)"

LGTM! Too bad my name won't appear in the hg repo for this code anymore. ;)

I'm really glad to see that you did #12265; I didn't want to figure out the right way to get that in order (the FLINT QQX stuff was still in flux when I wrote this patch IIRC), but it's what kept me from actually pushing any harder to get it in.

Do you happen to have some timing comparisons for the actual coefficient computation vs. the whole eisenstein_series_qexp call? I'm curious how low the overhead is now.

The Py_GET_ITEM is indeed gross, but a necessary evil.

I'll update the author of the patch right now to have both our names on it.   That's easy with queues, of course.

I kept thinking of a way to do what *we* need for #11375, then thinking of a better way, then a better way, then a better way, etc., (where better means it will be more generally helpful to code).  I ended up settling on a pretty good solution, I think.   But I deleted a lot of code on the way there!


> Do you happen to have some timing comparisons for the actual coefficient computation vs. the whole eisenstein_series_qexp call? I'm curious how low the overhead is now.
> 


Yes, here is an example:

```
sage: from sage.modular.modform.eis_series_cython import Ek_ZZ
sage: time v = Ek_ZZ(4,10^6)                  
Time: CPU 1.08 s, Wall: 1.08 s
sage: time f = eisenstein_series_qexp(4, 10^6)                
Time: CPU 1.32 s, Wall: 1.33 s
```
Before it would take 1 second to compute the v, then over 4 seconds to make the power series!

I think it...

1. looks better to indent in the original source (since the rendered Sphinx list is indented), 
2. looks identical in the rendered Sphinx output whether or not it is indented,
3. is not an error to indent; in fact, there isn't even a warning when you indent, as far as I can tell (unless they are being suppressed somehow?). 

When double-checking the above, I added eis_series_cython to the reference manual.  I've updated this patch based on adding it.

Replying to [comment:10 was]:
>   2. looks identical in the rendered Sphinx output whether or not it is indented,
  
This is not true, the rendered output is indented more.

>   3. is not an error to indent; in fact, there isn't even a warning when you indent, as far as I can tell (unless they are being suppressed somehow?).
  
True, it's not an error.  It just produces more indent.

Anyway, with the latest patch the documentation formatting is as it should be, so positive_review on that part.  I'll leave it to Craig Citro to review the rest of the patch.

LGTM on the power series bit ... glad the tests caught it. :)
