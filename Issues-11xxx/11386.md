Hi!

I won't have the time to review this; so I hope someone will take this on! Just a comment: it would be nice to include a definition of bracelets, and in particular how they relate and differ from necklaces (with appropriate .. seealso::).

Thanks,

Cheers,
                             Nicolas

Hellooooo !!

Some remarks :

* This patch needs some documentatin. It would be nice to have a definition of what bracelets are at the top of the document, and an explanation of what the methods do. 
* You also put tests in some of them, but all the methods should have at least one. 
* The GenB and CheckRev methods should also be renamed "the Sage way", that is lower case with underscores. It would theoretically be gen_b and check_rev but these names are not very explicit either. That actually is not a very bad problem for GenB as it is (I believe) the name commonly used in the litterature. It seems this method is for internal use only (it is called by `__iter__`) and so it would be nice to make it a private method (that is rename it to _gen_b for instance) if the user is not meant to call it directly. 
* I have no idea what checkrev does `^^;`

By the way: are there any chances to factor out some code between necklaces and bracelets? Both algorithms are from Sawada and, if I recall correctly, of the same flavor.

When natural, this is nice from a duplication point of view, but also for "Sage as a library of algorithm": the reader sees right away that there is really a single algorithm.
