Sage builds fully 64-bit on Solaris 10 (SPARC).

On 64-bit OpenSolaris or Solaris 10, the stats package R fails to build. Since R is an external program, one can just touch `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/installed/r-$versions` and get an almost complete Sage. 

However, this 64-bit Sage crashes at startup with OpenSolaris on x86, as discussed at:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/efc864c79fed92df?hl=en

(one would expect similar on Solaris 10 x86 and probably SPARC too).

A backtrace with gdb on a Sun Ultra 27 running OpenSolaris 06/2009 shows:

Burcin writes on sage-devel

''
It seems that cones.py looks for posets.py, which needs the graphs
module, which initializes the graph_editor. The graph editor tries to
see if it's in the notebook or the command line, but sagenb imports SR
and Expression from sage.symbolic.all (line 563 of
sagenb/misc/support.py). This tries to initialize the functions
(integrate in this case) before pynac is initialized...''

''We need a better solution for making sure modules are initialized
properly before anything is imported from them. I thought putting an
__init__.py file in sage/symbolic/ with "import pynac" would solve the
problem. However, it seems that python just ignores that file.
''

This is one of the very few issues preventing a complete 64-bit build on Solaris/OpenSolaris, so it would be nice to crack this one.

Just to confirm, creating a 64-bit *hello world* program with *gcc* and using 'ldd' to find what libraries are linked. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~$ gcc -m64 test.c
drkirkby@hawk:~$ ldd a.out
	libc.so.1 =>	 /lib/64/libc.so.1
	libm.so.2 =>	 /lib/64/libm.so.2
drkirkby@hawk:~$ 
```

so only the Sun libraries are being used. 

I'm hoping Robert or Bucin can come up with a reliable fix for this at the Python level. At least I know that will solve the problem on OpenSolaris. 

As with many things, if the behavior is not defined, one can get mysterious and not necessarily reproducible bugs. It sounds like there are a couple of things which are not defined fully.

Ingredients to the Linux/libc issue as far as I know them:
1. Dynloading of a library with dependencies, so that multiple so files are loaded in response to a single dlopen call. The gtk python module is a likely candidate here.
2. One of the deps must use the initial-exec flavour of thread-local variables. The proprietary nvidia OpenGL drivers (libnvidia-tls.so) do this. Iirc a line mentioning "R_X86_64_TPOFF64" in the output from "objdump -R" is a good indication for this.
3. Another of the deps (from the same dlopen call) must be the place where things will later go wrong. In our case that was the C++ library, libstdc++, shipped with gcc.
4. The latter dep must make use of its thread local vars (of local-dynamic flavour). In our case that was the C++ exception handling mechanism. So if no exception gets thrown, we won't encounter the issue here.

I'd agree to both. So you can either fix the exception handling mechanism, or avoid the exception being thrown. Either one makes the problem vanish, although the other half of the problem might well resurface somewhere else later on.

Is there a chance of linking that OpenSolaris backtrace to actual code lines from the Sun C library, to see what's happening there?

   It seems that cones.py looks for posets.py, which needs the graphs module, which initializes the graph_editor.

This can be done by 
* putting the import statement closer to the place where the object is needed in the source as opposed to the top of the file, or
* using Robert's LazyImport

Note that quite a while ago, I wrote a script (`sage-test-import` in `local/bin`) to test for these problems. It imports each module in the Sage library individually, and checks if we got any errors. It would be a significant achievement if we can get a release to pass this test. This would go a long way towards making Sage more modular.

[attachment:trac_11116-fix_imports.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11116/trac_11116-fix_imports.patch) is a first attempt to clear up the circular dependencies. However, it still doesn't fix this problem.

Whatever I do, it seems that the initialization for `libpynac.so` is not run by the time modules in `sage.functions` are loaded. Is there a trick to make sure the library is initialized sooner?

I added Volker to the CC list, since he mentioned exactly this problem while working on pynac at SD31. :)

Having spent the whole day yesterday worrying about import ordering, I must say that we have way too many circular imports. This is also an issue because we currently call Cython with `--disable-function-redefinition` that changes the import ordering for cython files to an old and obsolete behavior. But Sage relies on it, otherwise many of its circular imports break.

It would be the wrong approach to require module X to load before module Y, this will just cause maintenance headaches down the road. Really, the problem is that module initializers do too much too early. If you start up Sage under a debugger then there are lots of non-trivial computations done in module initializers. Do we really need to construct some degree-20 polynomials every time Sage starts up? I don't think so. I would deposit that 
* Module initializers should never require anything outside of their own module. 
* If there is the slightest doubt, make your initializer lazy.

To my mind, the problem here in this ticket is that the `sage.symbolic.integration.integral` module instantiates its `IndefiniteIntegral` class, 

```
indefinite_integral = IndefiniteIntegral()
```
which in turn calls into pynac to register itself. Really there is no reason for this to be immediate, and it opens a can of worms about initialization order.

One could try to kludge around this and make `sage.symbolic.function.Function.__init__` delay the function registration with pynac until pynac is ready, or initialize pynac explicitly. But then somebody will find a way to not only initialize a pynac function, but also use it inside a module initalizer in a nontrivial way, and it would crash again.

If this sort of stupidity is occurring, it is no wonder there are complaints of Sage starting slowly. For some people Sage is taking minutes to start. 

If I am understanding you correctly, it seems this problem I noticed on OpenSolaris is just a symptom of a more serious implementation issue, which is the result of a lack of thought in the design of Sage.

I think thats unrelated and essentially due to harddrives or NFS. The CPU can still run circles around any filesystem access.

Well compared to the C++ static initializer hell this is a piece of cake ;-). We have the tools to easily make initializers lazy, we just need to use them.

#11043 doesn't touch symbolic stuff so I doubt it'll do anything.
