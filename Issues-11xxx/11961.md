I had no problem when installing the patch. The doc is also correctly generated.

All tests I have performed are consistent: both algorithms return the same boolean value. The certificate are not the same when several certificates are possible.

Algorithm B is a bit slower than algorithm A.

As I already said for patch #11735, significant running time improvements are possible for these linear time algorithms, but at least we have some algorithms ;)

Thank you Nathann.

Thank you for the review ! `:-)`

> Algorithm B is a bit slower than algorithm A.


Yep. That's why it is good to have both `:-)`

> As I already said for patch #11735, significant running time improvements are possible for these linear time algorithms, but at least we have some algorithms ;)


These codes are really standard. It would really be a shame not to implement them properly in C/C++ at some point.
