Keywords: Makefile pipestatus

Using `&&` inside commands for pipestatus does not work.  Therefore, in the top-level Makefile, we should move `$(TESTPRELIMS)` out of `$(PIPE)`.

For example, if `sage-starts` fails, one would get

```
$ make ptestlong
[...]
spkg/pipestatus ". local/bin/sage-env && sage-starts && ./sage -tp 0  -sagenb -long devel/sage/doc/common devel/sage/doc/de devel/sage/doc/en devel/sage/doc/fr devel/sage/doc/ru devel/sage/sage 2>&1" "tee -a ptestlong.log"

Testing that Sage starts...
Traceback (most recent call last):

spkg/pipestatus: line 44: [: -ne: unary operator expected
make: *** [ptestlong] Error 1
```

Note the penultimate line.

The attached patch also:
1. removes `sage-starts` from `sage -tp`, because running `make ptest` or `make ptestlong` already runs `sage-starts`.
2. runs `./sage -b` in the `make build` rule.  This ensures that the Sage library is up-to-date when testing or building documentation.
3. adds `make testalllong` and `make ptestalllong` for completeness.
4. generally cleans up the `Makefile`.

**Apply**:
1. [attachment:11969_testprelims.patch] to **SAGE_ROOT**
2. [attachment:11969_scripts.patch] to **scripts**

I noticed that `make ptestlong` actually runs `sage-starts` **twice**: once from the `Makefile` and once from `sage-sage`.

I propose **not** to run `sage-starts` when the user explicitly runs

```
$ ./sage -tp [...]
```
but to run `sage-starts` only when the user does

```
$ make ptestlong
```

The rationale is that `sage -tp` is often done with one or few files and then the overhead of `sage-starts` might be significant.  However, for a `make ptestlong` run, running `sage-starts` once does not really impact the testing time.

No, the problem is that you might get this:

```
A mysterious error (perhaps a memory error?) occurred, which may have crashed doctest.
```
And you get it from a race condition, where multiple processes are simultaneously trying to create the same subdirectories of .sage.  So it doesn't occur when you do "sage -t", only "sage -tp".

How is this solved by running `sage-starts`?  I would assume that a user doing `./sage -tp` has already ran Sage at least once.  And it also seems that #11926 should solve precisely this problem (except in the rare case where the changed code has to do with creating directories in the Sage startup).

But IMHO, if there are race conditions in creating directories (in `$DOT_SAGE/`), the race conditions should get fixed instead of using dumb work-arounds that are hardly ever necessary.

Note that e.g. only `sage-ptest` supports `SAGE_TEST_ITER`.

This doesn't help if `$DOT_SAGE` differs, e.g. because the user changed the variable's setting, or it's just a different user that runs Sage [for the first time maybe, or deleted his previous `.sage`, or there are new directories to create].

You could look at #7103, as I mentioned above, and to #7079, to which #7103 refers.

See #11972.  I think the patch there should also take care of the race conditions when creating DOT_SAGE and its various subdirectories, which seemed to be the problem with #7103.  One way to test: remove the sage-starts code from the doctesting routines and set DOT_SAGE to a non-existing directory and run "sage -tp ...".  Repeat many times and see if you ever get "mysterious errors".  Then apply the patch at #11972 and see if that fixes it.

If this fixes it, then I'm willing to make #11972 a prerequisite for this ticket and remove the execution of sage-starts from sage-sage.  But I'm not willing to remove sage-starts unless we're pretty sure that we haven't reintroduced a possible bug in doctesting.
