Using `&&` inside commands for pipestatus does not work.  Therefore, in the top-level Makefile, we should move `$(TESTPRELIMS)` out of `$(PIPE)`.

For example, if `sage-starts` fails, one would get

```
$ make ptestlong
[...]
spkg/pipestatus ". local/bin/sage-env && sage-starts && ./sage -tp 0  -sagenb -long devel/sage/doc/common devel/sage/doc/de devel/sage/doc/en devel/sage/doc/fr devel/sage/doc/ru devel/sage/sage 2>&1" "tee -a ptestlong.log"

Testing that Sage starts...

```

Note the penultimate line.

The attached patch also:
1. removes `sage-starts` from `sage -tp`, because running `make ptest` or `make ptestlong` already runs `sage-starts`.
2. runs `./sage -b` in the `make build` rule.  This ensures that the Sage library is up-to-date when testing or building documentation.
3. adds `make testalllong` and `make ptestalllong` for completeness.
4. generally cleans up the `Makefile`.

I noticed that `make ptestlong` actually runs `sage-starts` **twice**: once from the `Makefile` and once from `sage-sage`.

I propose **not** to run `sage-starts` when the user explicitly runs

```
$ ./sage -tp [...]
```
but to run `sage-starts` only when the user does

```
$ make ptestlong
```

The rationale is that `sage -tp` is often done with one or few files and then the overhead of `sage-starts` might be significant.  However, for a `make ptestlong` run, running `sage-starts` once does not really impact the testing time.

No, the problem is that you might get this:

```
A mysterious error (perhaps a memory error?) occurred, which may have crashed doctest.
```
And you get it from a race condition, where multiple processes are simultaneously trying to create the same subdirectories of .sage.  So it doesn't occur when you do "sage -t", only "sage -tp".

How is this solved by running `sage-starts`?  I would assume that a user doing `./sage -tp` has already ran Sage at least once.

Sorry, hadn't read John's comments before my last post.

But IMHO, if there are race conditions in creating directories (in `$DOT_SAGE/`), the race conditions should get fixed instead of using dumb work-arounds that are hardly ever necessary.

This doesn't help if `$DOT_SAGE` differs, e.g. because the user changed the variable's setting, or it's just a different user that runs Sage [for the first time maybe, or deleted his previous `.sage`, or there are new directories to create].

You could look at #7103, as I mentioned above, and to #7079, to which #7103 refers.

See #11972.  I think the patch there should also take care of the race conditions when creating DOT_SAGE and its various subdirectories, which seemed to be the problem with #7103.  One way to test: remove the sage-starts code from the doctesting routines and set DOT_SAGE to a non-existing directory and run "sage -tp ...".  Repeat many times and see if you ever get "mysterious errors".  Then apply the patch at #11972 and see if that fixes it.

If this fixes it, then I'm willing to make #11972 a prerequisite for this ticket and remove the execution of sage-starts from sage-sage.  But I'm not willing to remove sage-starts unless we're pretty sure that we haven't reintroduced a possible bug in doctesting.
