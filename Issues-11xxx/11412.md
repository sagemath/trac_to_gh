the Partition(core=????,quotient=???) construction is broken in some very specific cases, even after applying #11165. For instance, after patching with #11165:

```
sage: Partition(core=[2,1],quotient=([],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]))
[4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
sage: Partition(core=[3,2,1],quotient=([],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]))
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (3247, 0))

works in the first case, fails in the second. the code is also badly documented. patch coming shortly.
