When you are running a long computation, you are probably putting your sage program in a `script.sage` file and then run `sage script.sage` in a screen'ed terminal. In that case, `sage-cleaner` is not run. So if you use `@`parallel, each fork creates a new subdirectory `$DOT_SAGE/temp/hostname/pid` that is not being cleaned up. This can easily reach a limit of the file system, for example ext2/ext3 are limited to 2<sup>15</sup>  subdirectories per directory.

A typical error message then looks like

```
[Errno 31] Too many links: '/home/vbraun/.sage//temp/hostname/26457/'
```

When you are doctesting this, the sage-cleaner was already started by the doctesting process. In a single-threaded doctest you could kill the sage-cleaner and check that it is being restarted, but with parallel testing that would just be a race condition.

Right, I was just coming to the same conclusion, although I'm not sure where sage-cleaner is actually started when you run "sage -t FILE".

In any case, it looks difficult, or at least annoying, to test this from within Sage's doctesting framework.
