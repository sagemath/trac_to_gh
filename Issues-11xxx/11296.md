The sage-combinat install script fails if there is no username provided to hg while attempting to qpush an empty patch.

To fix this, the install script should provide a default username so that the installation goes through.

More details: [http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/browse_thread/thread/b97b59a5f490f0e9?hl=en](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/browse_thread/thread/b97b59a5f490f0e9?hl=en)

The patch needs to be applied in the `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin` repository.
