```

another problem is absence of double inclusion guard in /usr/include/fenv.h, 
which causes other troubles (see below). This is in fact a Cygwin bug uncovered here (cf. below), which should be fixed in the next Cygwin update. Meanwhile, you could edit your /usr/include/fenv.h.

Upstream patches fixing the issues here are in the spkg below.  This is separate from Cygwin fixing their problems, of course, so hopefully once both have new stable releases we'll really be in good shape, but this package should be sufficient on both XP and Windows 7.

See instead #11884.

Would make sense. Is upstream aware of this? Also, was there any issue with ecl-10.4.1?
I may have a look at making yet again another ecl-11.1.1 spkg when I have a bit of time.

no, this redefines a bunch of stuff and does not compile as a result.

oops, please ignore this. Adding the include to libraries.d fixes this particular problem.

indeed, it's just that /usr/include/fenv.h is not protected from double inclusion.
Adding 

```
#define _FENV_H_
```
into its first lines fixes the problem, and ecl builds!
I'll notify upstream (cygwin) on this.
If this is not fixed in cygwin itself, then it's of course trivial to fix in the ecl code.

Replying to [@dimpase](#comment%3A7):
they were quick:

http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2011-04/msg00336.html

so the fenv.h problem will be fixed in the coming release; meanwhile feel free to edit the system header :)

Here's what's needed for positive review, I think.

* Make an spkg with that change, that includes information to deprecate for newer Cygwin (or that has a switch for different versions with a patching in the old case).
* Testing the spkg on XP.

What is the way to fix this in ECL itself, given that a new Cygwin is not currently available?

Ooopsie! There's a few .DS_Store files from OS X in the sources. I'll remove these in my .p4 but it would be good if they were gone from this one in case #11708 doesn't move in 4.7.2.

```
tar tf ecl-11.1.1.p3.tar  | grep Store
ecl-11.1.1.p3/src/._.DS_Store
ecl-11.1.1.p3/src/src/h/._.DS_Store

Perhaps also take into account [comment:ticket:11708:54 this comment]. :P

Karl-Dieter: which `tar` program did you use to create the spkg?  There are two strange things:

1. When extracting with GNU tar, I get

```
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.dev'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.ino'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.nlink'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.dev'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.ino'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.nlink'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.dev'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.ino'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.nlink'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.dev'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.ino'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.nlink'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.dev'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.ino'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.nlink'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.dev'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.ino'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.nlink'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.dev'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.ino'
tar: Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `SCHILY.nlink'
```

2. The entries in the tar file are sorted in a weird way, for example the contents of `src/examples/` comes way later than the directory `src/examples/`.  This has consequences for the modification time of the extracted directories.  Adding the option `--delay-directory-restore` when extracting solves the issue.

I am *not* at all saying the spkg needs to be changed, I am mainly curious.  And it also made me aware of the option `--delay-directory-restore` of GNU tar.

Jeroen, are you 100% sure you used GNU tar? Such things are known to appear when you run an old BSD tar (like one you have on old MacOSX)

Thanks for the link and it is **exactly** the issue I was talking about.  I think you misunderstood my question: I was talking about *extracting* with GNU tar.  So, presumably, Karl-Dieter used BSD tar to *create* the archive.  This is not a big issue, just something that I was unaware of.

Is this a problem I'll need to deal with?  As far as I know, I created this on a modern Mac, but it's still BSD:

```
%man tar
BSDTAR(1)                 BSD General Commands Manual                BSDTAR(1)

NAME
     tar -- manipulate tape archives

SYNOPSIS
     tar [bundled-flags <args>] [<file> | <pattern> ...]
     tar {-c} [options] [files | directories]
     tar {-r | -u} -f archive-file [options] [files | directories]
     tar {-t | -x} [options] [patterns]

DESCRIPTION
     tar creates and manipulates streaming archive files.  This implementation
     can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar, ar, and ISO 9660 cdrom images
     and can create tar, pax, cpio, ar, and shar archives.
```
It's a lot more tedious for me to make tars on sage.math.  Presumably I'm not the only person to make spkgs on Mac, though, and I do use `sage -pkg` to do them - I only use `tar` to unpack things, in general.

No, it's a problem **I** have to deal with :-)  In all seriousness, it's not really a problem, I just need to be aware of this and use the `--delay-directory-restore` option to extract spkgs.
