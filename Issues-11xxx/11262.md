Desired functionality: the change in the plot (or whatever one is manipulating) to happen *as* (not after) one moves, say, a slider, without any noticeable lag.

The current `@`interact implementation contacts the server and recalculates the output whenever a variable changes. The result is a noticeable lag between moving a slider and the update in a plot. Caching the plots helps partially, but the time it takes to contact the server and to generate the image is very noticeable.

An alternative approach (which does not have to *replace* the current one) is to precalculate all possible outputs and to send them to the notebook in advance.

For example, each frame of a plot can be saved as an image file on the server, then the notebook can load all images in some hidden place, and when the user moves a JavaScript slider, the images will be ready in the browser's cache - without any interaction with the server. A proof of concept: http://nt.sagenb.org/home/pub/36/ .

I have taken the liberty to focus this ticket on a very specific way of obtaining the desired functionality because I don't see any other options. If there are, please edit accordingly. Also, I am not familiar with the trac system, but if I am expected to monitor this ticket and answer questions and make changes, could somebody else volunteer to do this? I don't yet know if I will have the time to look at this ticket often in the near future.

I'm going to close this as "wontfix" because I'm not convinced that it's a good idea to do this and because Sage is now focused on the Jupyter notebook. If you feel like you still need the feature, it should be reported to ipywidgets instead.
