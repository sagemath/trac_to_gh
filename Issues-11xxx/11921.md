From [this thread on sage-support](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/t/592e98fcece39df1):

```
Hi, 
Sage uses a dictionary to translate Sage function names to SymPy ones 
when they are different. 
Signal function is called "sgn" in Sage and "sign" in Sympy but the 
respective translation is not in the dictionary, and a error is issued 
if one tries to do something like: 
   x = var('x'); sgn(x)._sympy_() 
To fix it, it is just a matter of adding 
                "sgn": "sign", 
to the dictionary. 
Such dictionary is called "translation_table" and it is inside 
function "composition" from class "SympyConverter" of file "sage/ 
symbolic/expression_conversions.py". 
I would like to know how can I submit a patch, or ask someone to do 
it, and if it is necessary to include something in a unit test (like I 
did for Sympy for the inverse translation). 
?

The conversions should be specified with the `conversions` argument to the `BuiltinFunction` constructor. Having the conversion near the function definition is easier to maintain than that table.

In this case, the constructor for sage.functions.generalized.FunctionSignum should be changed to include `'sympy': 'sign'` in the `conversions` argument.

However, `x = var('x'); sgn(x)._sympy_()` still fails.

I like everything here, good simplification and clarification of all this.  

I'd like a different example, though!  

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.function import SymbolicFunction 
sage: f = SymbolicFunction('f', conversions=dict(sympy='ff'))
sage: f(x)
f(x)
sage: f(x)._sympy_()
<snip>
ValueError: Function FallingFactorial expects 2 argument(s), got 1.
```
Well!  That was a surprise.

So I'm adding a reviewer patch that just swaps `g` for `f` and then documents the less surprising error that sympy has no `gg` function.
