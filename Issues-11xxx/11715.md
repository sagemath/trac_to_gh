I thought the previous error message for `set_row()` about lists of entries being the wrong length was a bit vague, since it just referenced "v", which does not even need to be a vector.

So while changing that I upgaded the documentation and error-checking for both `set_row()` and `set_column()`.  Attempting to use the `set_unsafe()` method resulted in a boatload of errors, so I backed off from that.

Well, here is the punishment for these good deeds.

Namely, if we're going to upgrade this documentation, we should probably also upgrade it to have tests for other things.  Before there was no excuse, but now we should just do it all.

```
sage: A = matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]]); A
[1 2]
[3 4]
sage: A.set_row(1,[.1,3])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<snip>
TypeError: Attempt to coerce non-integral RealNumber to Integer
```
Etc.  

We should catch such errors and return a slightly more informative error message, just as we do with the wrong length list or wrong index, e.g. `TypeError: new row must have all elements in original ring.`  Unless we want to allow this and do an implicit `change_ring`?  Probably we should have an error message like in the doc for `A.set_col_to_multiple_of_col?`.

Minor comment - `TESTS:` needs two colons.

I've added error handling for TypeErrors that gives a more useful exception, suggesting that change_ring be used on the matrix first if the user wishes to set a row or column with elements from another ring.

```
sage: A = matrix(2, [1, 2, 3, 4])
sage: A.set_row(0, [1/3, 1]); A
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Cannot set row with Rational Field elements over Integer Ring, use change_ring first.
