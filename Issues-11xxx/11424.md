Currently, Sage fails to build Integer from Unicode

```
sage: Integer(u'1')
TypeError Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unable to coerce <type 'unicode'> to an integer
```

The two lines patch attached to this ticket, allow such feature

```
sage: Integer(u'1')
1
sage: Integer(u'0X13')
19
```

Keywords: **Integer, unicode**

Component: **basic arithmetic**
