Hello !!!

Here is a small patch adding 3 lines of comments to your code, so that other will understand it faster than I did `:-)`

If that's fine with you, you can set the ticket to "positive review" !

Hi Nathann,

Thanks for your review! The comments were welcome indeed :-) 
I rephrased them just a bit, and folded your patch into yours.

No comment on sage-devel, so I guess noone cares.

Cheers,
                               Nicolas
