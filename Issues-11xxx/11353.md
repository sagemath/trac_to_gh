It would be very useful if the Bitset and FrozenBitset had complement operators that returned a new bitset that was the complement:

```
sage: list(~FrozenBitset([0,1],capacity=3))
[2]
```

There already is a fast bitset_complement cython function, so I think it's a matter of just wrapping it.

Attachment: **[trac_11353_complement_of_frozenbitset.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11353/trac_11353_complement_of_frozenbitset.patch.gz)**

The attached file adds the complement operation to FrozenBitset, and so to Bitset, and binds it to tilde. 

I needed it, so I did it.
