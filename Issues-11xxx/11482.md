```
R.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, default_prec=10)
a = -1 + 0*t
b = 2 + 0*t
h=a.solve_linear_de(b=b,f0=3,prec=10)
```

This works... but is not exactly very obvious to find!  Also, the syntax is crazily different from other desolvers.  

Let's make a high level one for this.

Perhaps a top level `desolve_series()` function?

I don't think we need even more specialized top-level functions... However, a top-level `desolve` with options to obtain symbolic, series and numeric solutions could be nice to have.
