I've attached a reviewer patch fixing the error message and also some other (unrelated) parts of the documentation.

P.S.: trac doesn't send a notification if you only attach or update a patch, so it's usually better to also add a comment such that others will notice your update.

Does it? Apparently haven't tried, i.e., tested it / made the patch against alpha2.

If so, I can of course rebase it; I was actually considering it for late inclusion into the alpha3 since it is a trivial (or harmless) fix.

Updated my reviewer patch.

Jeroen, are you going to / do you want to review this?

Otherwise I'll just set it back to "positive review"... ;-) (Did a full `ptestlong` to catch all places where the changed exception messages are used.)

Jeroen, we have **lots** of such patches.

You **must not** set (e.g.) `LC_ALL=C`, but use e.g. `en_US.utf-8` when applying patches.

I'd consider that a Mercurial bug btw.

Allright, the command that made it work for me was

```
$ LANG=en_US.UTF-8 hg qpush
```
Note that `$LANG` is set by default on some systems (e.g. sage.math.washington.edu).
