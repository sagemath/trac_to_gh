Assignee: jason, mpatel, was

Keywords: sd32

The attached patch removes *pkg_resources* from being loaded on sage startup:

```
$ ./sage --startuptime|grep pkg_resources
                  pkg_resources: 0.029
```

The patch improves the situation from

```
$ dumbbench -- ./sage --startuptime
Ran 22 iterations (2 outliers).
Rounded run time per iteration: 9.433e-01 +/- 7.2e-03 (0.8%)
```

to

```
$ dumbbench -- ./sage --startuptime
Ran 23 iterations (3 outliers).
Rounded run time per iteration: 8.903e-01 +/- 8.3e-03 (0.9%)
```
