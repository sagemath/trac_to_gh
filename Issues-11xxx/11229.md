Maybe the case of degree 1 isogenies has not been tested properly.

You can use E.isomorphism_to(Eshort) instead in this case.  The Weierstrass isomorphisms were implemented long before isogenies, and have a completely different type (though obviously one should be able to create a degree 1 isogeny from an isomorphism, and vice versa).

Hi John,

The only reason why I used a degree 1 isogeny in the example was to keep the example simple; it goes wrong in more general cases as well.

But I've already found in the code where it goes wrong.  I will upload a patch shortly.

Johan

Excellent!

I think there was a similar bug recently reported for isogenies -- could you look for that to see if your patch corrects that too?  I don't remember the number.

Too  bad.

I have no time now but will review at some point, unless someone else gets there first.
