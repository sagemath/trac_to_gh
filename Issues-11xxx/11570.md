I found a little spelling mistake in sage/plot/circle.py (patch attached).
You might think, that this bug is non-sense, but I actually bumped over it and wondered, why the circle was not filled, although I just copied exactly, what the documentation said.

This is my first ticket and it is a little test (for me, that I get to know the procedure of contributing to sage).
I might submit something bigger later on.

Only apply: trac_1157_fill_spelling.patch

Keywords: plot, circle, documentation

Resolution: fixed

Author: Niels Ranosch

Reviewer: Maarten Derickx

Merged: sage-4.7.1.rc0

The change you made in the patch itself looks good. It was indeed a silly mistake in the documentation.

There are only one thing left to do to make the patch correct. It's missing a commit message.

I don't know how you made the patch, but you should add a commit message which at least includes the ticket number and a short description of the patch for example:

#11570 fix circle plot fill documentation 

The commit message is shortly discribed in point 6 of
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#submitting-a-change

or if you used queues

No, the ticket is okay now. 

If you have multiple files attached to a ticket, you should make it clear in the ticket description so the release manager knows which patches to apply (I did it for you so you don't need to).

b.t.w. you don't need to add people who reacted to the ticket in the cc, they wil automatically get the mail because there is a link between trac accounts and e-mail adresses.
