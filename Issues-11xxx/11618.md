```
As pointed out in a post on sage-support:

```
var('x')
g(x)=0
print solve(g(x)==0,x)
print solve(g(x)==0,x,solution_dict=True) 
```
gives

```
[x == r1]
{x: r1}
```
It should be `[{x: r1}]` to be consistent.

Depends on #8553

A doctest for a similar case got deleted by a reviewer, which still works though:

```
sage: solve([x+y==6, x-y==4], x, y, solution_dict=-1)
[{y: 1, x: 5}]
```
And also the following works as expected:

```
sage: solve([x==0],x,solution_dict=True)
[{x: 0}]
```

I've updated the patch to directly construct the solution dictionary.
