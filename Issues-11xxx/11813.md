Many sites are running transparent web proxies. Which should be fine, but I and Simon King both recently ran into a bug where and attempt to download a patch from trac resulted in an old version of the patch. Needless to say, this is very dangerous for development.

To reproduce, you need to have a transparent proxy in front of you, and then
1. Upload a patch to trac
2. Download the patch (the proxy will cache it)
3. Upload a new version of the patch under the same name
4. Download the patch again - under some circumstances the old version of the patch is served by the (not so) transparent proxy.

This just happened to me with `trac11115-cached_cython.patch`. If I download it from boxen (without proxy), I receive the following http headers:

```

HTTP provides the ETag header to control cache freshness. The proxy (squid/2.7.STABLE9) should have checked with the trac server to see if the cached ETag `W/"anonymous/Thu, 26 May 2011 07:16:22 GMT/False"` is still up-to-date. If the resource were still up to date the trac server would reply `HTTP 304 Not Modified`, but since the ETag changed the trac server should reply with the new version of the patch. I don't have access to the server logs so I can't say what happened for sure, but something is broken.

A workaround is to set the `Pragma: no-cache` in the client query (i.e. use `wget --no-cache`), but then its easy to forget that.

Irrespective of who is precisely at fault, we should configure the trac server to never allow caching of the patches since their integrity is crucial for us and client-side caching doesn't really buy us much. For that, I propose to configure Apache to add the following to the headers for all resources under `/sage_trac/raw_attachment`:

```
Cache-Control: no-cache
Expires: Thu, 1 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT
```
hitting both the HTTP/1.0 and 1.1 cache control mechanisms.

Well, if you name it such...

You can put it into `~/.wgetrc`.

Hmmm, I cannot tell how large the impact *on the machine running trac* will be, but in general I think that's a bad idea.

I don't think it will be large at the moment *for ordinary users*, as most patches are [hopefully] small, but note that this also inhibits the use of `-N` (`--timestamping`), which is more [or also] crucial to the *client side*, especially for bots (or if you have a very slow, or expensive / volume-taxed connection).

Thinking more about it, I'm not so sure whether this would be a problem *with `wget`* (provided `Last-modified` is kept as is), but I rather doubt that other programs will be as "smart", i.e., first checking the modification time if a file is not to be cached anyway.

Ordinary users don't download patches from trac on a regular basis, thats why I don't think there is any bandwidth issue. The problem with the `~/.wgetrc` bandaid is that you often don't know whether you are behind a transparent proxy. Sage developers regularly work away from their home institutions / in coffee shops, and who knows what is being cached.

> Ordinary users don't download patches from trac on a regular basis, thats why I don't think there is any bandwidth issue. The problem with the `~/.wgetrc` bandaid is that you often don't know whether you are behind a transparent proxy.


Well, humans are more likely to read the comments on a ticket, so they actually *see* that a patch was re-uploaded / modified (though they perhaps don't look at the file modification times of the downloaded files, which one IMHO should do).

But the purpose of `~/.wgetrc` in this case would be to *always* disable caching (by default), such that it wouldn't matter whether you're behind a proxy or not (provided the proxy isn't broken and doesn't refuse to bypass caching).

You're right, that's of course too much to demand, compared to the minimal effort it takes to continually install a recent version of Sage with all necessary prerequisite patches etc. on every computer one might take with oneself.

So it is safe to read the comments; I didn't say anything else. Bots usually don't do that, which was my point.

Well, you should notice when a patch (which you know of it was) recently re-uploaded on trac suddenly has a modification time of months ago, and in case you have any doubt, you can easily view the HTML version, which also shows the *current* changeset header, and compare it to what you actually downloaded or have on your disk.




Hopefully this will be fixed by Edgewall, although -- despite the discussion on sage-devel -- we still have the more than two years old 0.11.5 version.

This is the correct solution--it's what you do when you have a URI whose content may change. I don't think it'll be a severe issue for developers to hit trac itself rather than transparent proxies and it's a worthy price to pay for always getting the correct version. The raw patch is certainly cheaper on the server and connection than the html version. 

Currently, there's only one patchbot and it's running locally, so no transparent proxy that I'm aware of :).
