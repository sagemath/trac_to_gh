As the summary says.

The home base for this ticket is the Lion ticket #11881.

There are no claims that this fixes Maxima building (see #11966 for that); the only claim is that this new package builds and ecl runs standalone.

**spkg**: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/ecl-11.1.2.cvs20111120.p0.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/ecl-11.1.2.cvs20111120.p0.spkg) (also contains the fixes for Cygwin, see #11119)

This package, and Maxima built with it, works on:
1. OS X 10.4 PPC
2. OS X 10.6
3. OS X 10.7
4. sage.math.washington.edu

The CVS version from 2011-11-08 fails on OS X 10.4 PPC, [reported upstream](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3437863&group_id=30035&atid=398053).

Depends on #11966

**CC:**  @mwhansen @nexttime

**Keywords:** ecl spkg upgrade update lion darwin 11

**Author:** Dmitrii Pasechnik, Mike Hansen, Karl-Dieter Crisman, William Stein, John Palmieri, Jeroen Demeyer

**Reviewer:** Karl-Dieter Crisman, Reg Burgess, Fran√ßois Bissey, Leif Leonhardy, John Palmieri

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.

**Merged:** sage-4.8.alpha3

I got this to build by pulling from their latest repository:

```
git clone git://ecls.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/ecls/ecl
```
Then I dropped this as "src" into the old ecl spkg.  Should I make an official spkg this way?  It would feel safer to just extract the changes that we need, but I'm not sure I have time to look into that right now.

(My build hasn't reached maxima yet, either, so I don't know if ecl will really work or not.)

No, maxima didn't build:

```
An error occurred during initialization:
In C:BUILDER, when building file
 binary-ecl/maxima
tried to link together files that contained split binary data.
Unfortunately this is currently not possible. To avoid this
recompile the files setting C::*COMPILE-IN-CONSTANTS* to T.
List of offending files:
```
and then a long list of files follows.  Suggestions?

On the other hand, the binary "ecl" starts and executes some basic lisp operations correctly.  So do we need to modify the maxima spkg?

```

An error occurred during initialization:

```

There seems to be additional crap (or redundant things) in the upstream tree.

You should have noticed that even the compressed spkg is now almost twice as large.




What Karl-Dieter said is most probably because **the exit codes of `patch` aren't checked**:

```sh
###############################################################
# apply patch for the problem acknowledged upstream in
# http://www.mail-archive.com/ecls-list@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00671.html
# The patch itself comes from the following commit:

This needs work, and I don't know how to fix it.  On sage.math, I took a vanilla Sage 4.7.2 and dropped in either my spkg or William's, along with the maxima spkg from #11966, and I built from scratch. The build succeeded, but doctesting hangs on various files.  For example:

```
$ ./sage -t --verbose devel/sage/doc/en/tutorial/tour_rings.rst

...
Trying:
    pi in RR###line 124:_sage_    >>> pi in RR
Expecting:
    True

Condition of type: SIMPLE-TYPE-ERROR
In function MAKE-FOREIGN-DATA-FROM-ARRAY, the value of argument is
        "\"3.141592653589793 = %pi\""
which is not of expected type BASE-STRING
Available restarts:

1. (USE-VALUE) Supply a new value of type BASE-STRING.

Top level.
> 
```
At this point, ecl stops to ask for user input, and since doctesting is noninteractive, it waits until the test times out.  For what it's worth, I tried a build which was 4.7.2 plus the maxima spkg from #11966, and all tests passed.  So the problem looks like it's ecl, not maxima, but I'm not positive about this.

From the web page [http://ecls.sourceforge.net/ecl/Strings.html](http://ecls.sourceforge.net/ecl/Strings.html), it looks like a "base-string" is just an alias for "string", and I don't know why the quoted object isn't a string.  Is it the backslashes?

I don't know much about Sage's interactions with ecl and maxima, so I don't have any ideas about how to fix this.  The file `devel/sage/sage/interfaces/lisp.py` passes tests.  `interfaces/maxima.py` passes, but `interfaces/maxima_lib.py` and `interfaces/maxima_abstract.py` hang with the same kind of error (when run verbosely).

By the way, I deleted the directory src/src/libffi directory, and this gives a warning during configuration:

I wonder if we should configure using `--with-dffi=no` on all platforms?  Or perhaps I shouldn't delete the directory.  In William's package:

```
$ du -s -h src
44M	src
$ du -s -h src/src/libffi/
7.2M	src/src/libffi/
```
So it takes a fair amount of room...

`libffi` is installed on many systems, so we certainly shouldn't disable it.

Much more worth is (also) removing the `gmp` directory, which at the moment makes up half of the tarball; see #9493.  One should at least add a `TODO`, since people apparently tend to not look at other related tickets.




If you configure with `--enable-unicode=no` (you could also use `--disable-unicode` btw.), you can completely remove the following two directories (not just their contents):

```
src/contrib/encodings/
src/contrib/unicode/
```




If the patches are applied from `src/`, they should be applied (i.e., be appliable) with `-p1` for consistency.

I also get

```
patching file src/c/ffi/libraries.d
Hunk #1 succeeded at 70 with fuzz 2 (offset 1 line).
```




`spkg-install` in whole needs some clean-up, for example all error messages should go to `stderr`.  If `MAKEFLAGS` are a problem on MacOS X, they should be unset on MacOS X, not by default (and the comment is btw. wrong or unrelated).

Ceterum censeo we should upgrage trac.

If you hesitate to patch `configure` to remove / modify the calls of some redundant scripts in `src/src/gmp/`, you can delete everything there except `install-sh` and `{config,configfsf}.*`.

We should also configure with `--with-gmp="$SAGE_LOCAL"` (or `--with-gmp-prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL"`, haven't tested that yet).

FWIW, #9493 had a comment on that one must not configure with `--enable-unicode` if these directories are deleted (in the *Special Update/Build Instructions* section).




Since Sage also ships and builds the Boehm GC, we could most probably delete even more.

Okay, I'm posting a new spkg.  Differences between the previous one and this one are recorded in the "delta" patch.

> libffi is installed on many systems, so we certainly shouldn't disable it.

Okay, I'm not disabling it, so if it's present on the system, it will be used.  I'm still removing the directory.

> Much more worth is (also) removing the gmp directory

It's now (mostly) gone as per your suggestion.  See SPKG.txt.

> If the patches are applied from src/, they should be applied (i.e., be appliable) with -p1 for consistency.

Okay.

> `Hunk #1 succeeded at 70 with fuzz 2 (offset 1 line).`

Fixed

> spkg-install in whole needs some clean-up

I've done some clean-up.

> We should also configure with --with-gmp="$SAGE_LOCAL" (or --with-gmp-prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL", haven't tested that yet).

Done.

> Since Sage also ships and builds the Boehm GC, we could most probably delete even more.

I'm not touching this part, except to add a "To do" to the SPKG.txt file.

If this is merged, can we close #9493?

---

I took this spkg and the maxima spkg from #11966 and built Sage from scratch.  It built successfully on the following systems:

- sage.math
- hawk (David Kirkby's OpenSolaris machine)
- skynet machines eno, silius, taurus

Doctests passed on all of these except for silius, which has always had other issues.

This spkg by itself builds on an OS X Lion laptop, at which point `sage --lisp` seems to work, but other parts of the Sage build have problems.

I'm still in the middle of builds on other machines.

**Attachment:** [trac_11884-ecl.delta.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11884/trac_11884-ecl.delta.patch.gz)

Ok, delta patch looks sane (modulo some uppercase/lowercase inconsistency in `SPKG.txt`).

For most directories (except `gmp`), *"Remove the contents of ..."* should read *"Remove the directory ..."* (with `rm -rf ...`).




*Someone<sup>TM</sup>* should report the unconditional use of `install-sh` etc. from "optional" components' subdirectories upstream...

Also, there should be a way to force the use of a "system" Boehm GC (in our case, Sage's) on Darwin as well; haven't checked whether that changed in recent releases though.  (We could open a follow-up for that, and submit a patch upstream in case this is still necessary.)

I've tried all four combinations.

Works:
* Old ECL + Old Maxima

Doesn't build, error as noted on #11996:
* New ECL + New Maxima

Builds Maxima but doesn't create the library version properly:
* New ECL + Old Maxima

Currently trying, but seems pointless:
* Old ECL + New Maxima
