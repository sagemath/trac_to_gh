```
I have found the following behaviour:

```
sage: import sage.combinat.q_analogues as qa
sage: qa.q_binomial(2,-1)
1/(q^2 + q + 1)
sage: binomial(2,-1)
0
sage: qa.q_binomial(2,3)
1/(q^2 + q + 1)
sage: binomial(2,3)
0
```
I think these q-binomials should rather be zero. The q-binomial is based on the q-factorial, where one finds the following behaviour

```
sage: [qa.q_factorial(-i) for i in range(6)]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

This seems to be rather wrong, as the factorial itself is infinite for negative integers.

The patch restricts the q-factorial to nonnegative arguments and defines q-binomials outside of the correct range to be zero.

Hi Frédéric,

When you write a patch which fixes a bug, you should add a doctest checking
that the bug is indeed fixed, together with the ticket number.

I wrote a small review patch which does that. Your patch is Ok with me but
someone must review mine. If you can do that and if my modification are Ok,
you can put a positive review on that one !

This seems to be ok, except the q_binomial procedure, where I have some concern.

I think that, like the usual binomial coefficients, there is a natural extension of the q-binomial coefficients to the case (n,k) with negative k.

```
sage: binomial(-5,3) 
-35
```

Either one has to find this extension somewhere in the litterature, or we should leave the negative n case as NotImplemented. 

Well, I do not know. Maybe what you did is a correct temporary solution.

A quick search on the web didn't gave me anything. So I have the impression
that this negative extension is not quite standard. Anyway, I corrected the
error messages.
