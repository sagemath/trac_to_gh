OK, with the changed instructions and this explicit instruction set, I get a running sage-4.8.alpha4.  The notebook launches and everything I tried other than 3-D plotting worked in the notebook.  3-D plotting does not work because Jmol seems to be gone.  Is #11503 supposed to be included as well? That would install the new Jmol in the $SAGE_ROOT/local/shared directory rather than in the sagenb/data directory.  I note that there is no sagenb/data/jmol directory in the notebook created by this ticket, while there is in the old 4.8.alpha4 notebook.

I think it's almost there.

Jonathan: the problem was that my spkg-making sagenb install had a symbolic link to jmol, rather than the actual directory, and the symbolic link was not followed when making the spkg.

I've updated the 0.9.0 spkg (tagged as 0.9.0.rc2 in the repository google code).  Can you try again?  I just tried installing in a clean 4.8.alpha4, and 3d plots worked fine.

Thanks, Jason

I checked that all this appears to work on MacOSX 10.6 just fine, including Jmol and text fields with LaTeX.

I do not like that this build does not incorporate the [sass update](http://code.google.com/r/timdumol-flask-sagenb/source/detail?r=e06b3a6bfa47b2b0cf1c85fb43e25b61478ca7e2) by Tim Dumol in Sept. 2011
Without it, hacking the CSS stuff won't be possible on some platforms, at least not on MacOSX 10.6.

Is it possible to merge this, and the related [readme update](http://code.google.com/r/timdumol-flask-sagenb/source/detail?r=3fdcf40d679311a3cf7a00fd2323175e509b39af), into the sagenb spkg?

These are changes in the  generated CSS files.
The only changes in main.css are in the comments; these certainly can be ignored.

There are few other changes in the other css, called test_report.css.
(I don't even know if this file is used at all, is it?)
But these changes are indeed very, very minor, like a different way to encode the colour, or a change of a constant from 2.0em to 2em. I worked a bit with these modified CSS files, no issues noted. IMHO it is totally safe to update.

 I cc this to Tim Dumol, just in case.

The changes made were all automated, via the `sass-convert` tool made by the developers of SASS/SCSS themselves, with the exception of the moving of the Accounts page scss to a separate partial, which was a cut-paste into a new file; thus, there shouldn't be any regressions.

REFEREE REMARKS 1:

* The spkg is not in the proper format.  However, this is complicated to fix, and will be fixed in a *future* ticket: #12268

* `notebook(secure=True)` is currently totally broken, due to the twisted spkg not supporting our tls extension, since I guess the patch didn't get applied.  This needs to get fixed.

* All doctests pass.
 
* Rado has done some work on trying to get Selenium testing to work (the main issue just being installing everything on the same computer!).   The Selenium tests need to get run (and any issues fixed) before we make the release. 

* Jason has simplified and streamlined the notebook developer instructions in response to discussions with Rado and I.

upon reading the thread here started by jason-sage (we know this guy, don't we)
http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2010-October/022989.html
they basically say that one needs to do

```
"ssl:443:sslmethod=TLSv1_METHOD"
```
somewhere in the configs.

Pushed sagenb patch to github: https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/commit/e930db178c468c488f86465cbc51c3ef4df83b70

This takes care of the blocker problem of not being able to use secure=True for HTTPS (SSL) Flask-based Sage Notebook server.  It strips out all reference to GnuTLS and relies on PyOpenSSL.

For a few more details, GnuTLS support in Twisted was going to be pretty hard to get, and maintaining a sage-specific patch not a great proposition.  William also suggested that GnuTLS support be removed.

What is more likely to need changes is the script `sage-is-running-on-port.sh` which uses the contents of `~/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/twistd.pid` and `~/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/twistedconf.tac` to return the port the server is running on.

<div id="comment:93" align="right">comment:93</div>

Applying this to sage-4.8, I ran into one major problem. And I suggest some other minor changes:

1. There is a leftover file `apply-hg.py` that comes up when running `hg status`:

```
...ons/sage-4.8/devel/sagenb> hg status
*** failed to import extension hggit: No module named hggit
! util/apply-hg.py
```

2. It is not possible to login as user or admin. The notebook returns with a "Wrong password" message. I tried to look at user_manager to see if the problem is there but it isn't there. It's only from the web interface that the problem arises. There are two aspects of this: i) I can login with the password of a new user once I create a new user and use the randomly generated password given by Sage. ii) As soon as I change the randomly generated password to my own password using the web interface, I am unable to log in anymore.

3. Using user_manager.py, I can see that the passwords are correctly retrieved and verified. So, I am unsure where exactly the problem is. Here is an excerpt:

```
sage: nb = Notebook('/home/punarbasu/tmp/a.sagenb') 
sage: um = nb.user_manager()
sage: um.valid_login_names()             
['admin', u'test']
sage: um.check_password('admin', 'admin')          
True
sage: um.check_password('test', 'test')  
True
sage: 
```

4. [Minor change] In `devel/sagenb/sagenb/notebook/run_notebook.py` the following two changes should be made:

(1) This will be fixed in the next version of the spkg.

(2)-(3): I couldn't replicate this.  Can you give a precise sequence of steps to replicate this?  Here's what I did to test it: 

1. Log in as admin
2. Create a new user under the Settings | Manage Users
3. Log out and then log in as the new user
4. Change the user's password
5. Log in again with the new password

Everything seemed to work fine.

I guess it's about upgrading from an existing flask nb installation, from some time ago, and on Sage 4.7.2.

No error messages are output to the terminal. I can consistently reproduce this on two Linux systems. One is an Ubuntu-11.10 and the other is a Gentoo system. Both 64bits.

sagenb spkg requires openssl and openssl-dev.  After adding openssl-dev to my system the spkg installs fine.  If I missed this dependency sorry.  If not it needs to be clear somewhere.

Thanks to kini we have the answer to this. It seems the error is triggered only when the password length is less than 6 characters. This means that the min password length of 6 is hard-coded in some file. The new git revisions of the nb which has set the variable `min_password_length` to 6 effectively masks the problem without fixing it.

Patching the sage-on-gentoo flask notebook is not the solution. Test failures should not occur no matter what python modules, or indeed other programs, the user has installed into Sage's directory.

But there's actually a new failure, on 5.0.beta4:

```
sage -t  misc/sageinspect.py
**********************************************************************
File "/home/fs/src/sagenb/sagenb/misc/sageinspect.py", line 653:
    sage: sage_getargspec(Poset)

    (['data', 'element_labels', 'cover_relations'], None, None, (None, None, False))
Got:
    (['data', 'element_labels', 'cover_relations', 'category', 'facade', 'key'], None, None, (None, None, False, None, None, None))
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of   7 in __main__.example_16
***Test Failed*** 1 failures.
```

I presume this is caused by #10998.

The problem is as follows. In the json module, we have

```
If ``indent`` is a non-negative integer, then JSON array elements and
object members will be pretty-printed with that indent level. An indent
level of 0 will only insert newlines. ``None`` is the most compact
representation.
```

On the other hand, in the simple_json module, we have

```
If ``indent`` is a string, then JSON array elements and object members
will be pretty-printed with a newline followed by that string repeated
for each level of nesting. ``None`` (the default) selects the most compact
representation without any newlines. For backwards compatibility with
versions of simplejson earlier than 2.1.0, an integer is also accepted
and is converted to a string with that many spaces.
```

Sage integers do not trigger the following lines in simple_json (simplejson/encoder.py:173):

```python
        if isinstance(indent, (int, long)):
            indent = ' ' * indent
        self.indent = indent
```

Unfortunately it doesn't seem like the json module supports this new string form of the indent argument, which is why it works with our code - it just does `' ' * indent` without caring that it's a Sage integer. Apparently the json module is just an old version of the simplejson module which is bundled with Python, so it will get the new string-based indent parameter eventually, but for now we'll either have to require an up-to-date simplejson for the new notebook, or remember/detect which of the two modules we imported and call the function accordingly.

Yes, it contains Twisted 12. Yes, they might complain... feel free to create your own spkg with Twisted 11 instead - I might have messed something up anyway :)

Update to new jmol patch for `SAGE_ROOT`.

---
Also, after applying the changes from #11874, #11503 and this ticket, the doctest of `devel/sagenb-main/sagenb` passes. 

After these changes however, there is a problem with typesetting maths and I get this notice on evaluation of **every** cell, whether it is plot or maths.

`Error typesetting mathematics.`

And sure enough, something as simple as `view(2+2)` shows the latex code instead of the maths. jsmath is loaded and the button is present on the right hand corner.

UPDATE: I have same problem with sagenb from github with mathjax instead of jsmath. Seems like something is broken in sage and not sagenb.

I think one should provide a recipe for preparing a sage distribution with all these patches applied to be built from scratch, rather than patching an already built distribution. (Assuming one has hg (or a previous version of Sage) installed system-wide).
That is, most of these patches are to be applied to sage-??? spkg.

It makes more sense this way, as the changes are so extensive that it's time-consuming, and more error-prone, I think, to apply these to an already built installation of Sage.

The installation starts with many warnings.

I now tried the pyopenssl spkg, but this hasn't helped either...

Why? I imagine building openssl from source is not such a big deal.

As well, why can't you ask your sysadmin to install openssl headers?

Does the optional openssl spkg contain the necessary sources? Then the openssl spkg should be modified such that the development headers are installed.

Then, I think it would be helpful if the installation script of sagenb-0.9.0.spkg would check for the presence of the headers, and would print a clear message, if there are missing. Such as:

```

   **     ./sage -i openssl                                      **

I think this is a **trivial** dependency. Every modern Linux distro has openssl, and OSX's Xcode comes with openssl preinstalled. I don't see a need to jump hoops just in order to overcome a non-problem.

Sure. My computer has openssl as well. But it has not the *development* headers.

These are many headers, and they come from the openssl spkg. But apparently the development headers are still not there.

In other words, since about two hours I try to find out where I could get the development headers from, without being root. So, it is indeed a nontrivial dependency.

OK, so openssl headers need to be listed as a dependency for building Sage from source.
It is trivial in the sense that installing these headers is trivial (for a root).
While I understand that sysadmins might be slow, or picky (at the place I did my PhD at, the sysadmin only replied to emails which had "BEER" mentioned in the subject---I'm not kidding!), I cannot imagine this being hard to overcome...

Looks like a bug in openssl spkg (or in whatever place that need to compile openssl-related stuff).

Hi Keshav,

I was just about to point to the same text.

I don't know about licensing, but I think I was told that an optional spkg is fine for non-GPL packages.

I see in spkg-install that the `pyOpenSSL` package is installed via `easy_install --allow-hosts=None pyOpenSSL-0.12.tar.gz`. Isn't there a way to tell easy_install what include directory to use?

some optional packages have licenses which are incompatible with GPL, so this should not be a problem, if überhaupt we can distribute openssl...

Worth a try, I'd say!

And why should there be a new pyOpenSSL spkg? I think one should instead modify spkg-install in the sagenb spkg (using C_INCLUDE_PATH), so that the pyOpenSSL sub-package (which is different from the pyOpenSSL spkg) is correctly installed.

If the attempt to build it takes not too much time, then it is ok to simply wait if installation of pyOpenSSL works or not.

By the way, meanwhile building sage-5.1.notebook has finished. I can not do make test, but that's a problem fixed elsewhere (#12568, I think).

What I did to build it boils down to the following:

* Patch sagenb's spkg-install by adding `export C_INCLUDE_PATH="$SAGE_ROOT"/local/include` as the second line. *Note that the sagenb spkg has plenty of uncommitted changes* - that needs to be fixed before release. Also note that my fix may be too simplistic. It is just a proof of concept.
* make, and wait until it fails
* ./sage -i openssl
* make

Now I am adding the patch from #12568 and try make test.

<div id="comment:247" align="right">comment:247</div>

Above, I had claimed that pkg-config did not recognise the headers installed by the optional openssl spkg. I stand corrected, since inside a sage shell I get

```
(sage-sh) king@mpc622:sage-5.1.notebook$ pkg-config --cflags openssl
-I/mnt/local/king/SAGE/experiment/notebook/sage-5.1.notebook/local/include  
```

So, testing for the presence of openssl using pkg-config *during configuration* (i.e., before starting the installation) makes sense.

If it is true that sagenb would - in principle - also work without openssl, I agree with ppurka that we could easily avoid openssl to become de-facto standard:

* Make sure that sagenb spkg installs and the notebook basically works, even if openssl is not installed. Of course, the notebook will then lack some features.
* If one tries to use the openid and https features, then a runtime error should be raised, with a clear error message along the lines

 ```
 Install openssl with development headers. If they are not available for
 your operating system, you could install the optional openssl Sage package.
 This is possible, e.g., with the command
    install_package("openssl")
 during a Sage session.
 Then, re-install the Sage notebook package, e.g., by
    install_package("sagenb", forced=True)
 during a Sage session.
 ```

Would that be enough, actually? Or would a recompilation of Sage be needed after re-installation of sagenb?

a Linux binary distro doesn't come with gcc and make either, you'd have to install it. Nothing prevents you from installing openssh-dev at this moment, too.

It is not mentioned that one is supposed to type Ctrl-c in order to return to Sage's command line version.

I think there was a recent thread on sage-support (or sage-devel?)  started by a user who was confused about that point.

William stated that there used to be a clearer instruction when starting the notebook. Hence, I believe that this ticket is a good occasion to make the notebook instructions clearer.

I've got a systems I can set up without OpenSSL to test.  However, I won't be able to do it until I finish with exams and grading (roughly May 12).  If we still need this part reviewed at that time, someone should remind me and I will do it.

I think it would be better to merge this ticket at the earliest. It has come to a stage (after so many months!) where it is finally satisfactory.

The scalability problems can be addressed in a later ticket since the problems are evident only when there are thousands of accounts. From an end-user point of view, the speedup won't be very evident. So, mathjax + uwsgi can be the target of the next big nb ticket.

After looking at #12229 fairly carefully, I believe that it should remain a blocker for whatever Sage release the new notebook goes in, but not for this actual ticket.  The instructions are so generic and even currently inaccurate, that it would be counterproductive to keep that from allowing people to *test* this ticket in an early beta of some Sage version.

I know you all know I wouldn't say this lightly ;-) so as long as nobody has a problem with #12229 having that new status
* Blocker for ... Sage 5.2, I think Jeroen was estimating?
* No longer a prereq for this ticket being merged
then let's get this in.

Isn't OpenSSL part of the OS X operating system?

If and only if it is not already supplied on the system.

I guess it is, but [perhaps not for much longer](http://ludovicrousseau.blogspot.com/2011/08/mac-os-x-lion-and-openssl.html).

Okay, sounds good, but this needs to be in SPKG.txt, in clear enough terms so someone like me reading it knows not to try to install the optional openssl spkg on OS X, rather than trying `sage -i openssl` and then worrying when it doesn't build.

Hi everybody,

I just post this comment to tell you that my machine (core 2 duo with Ubuntu 12.04 32 bits installation) asked to install uuid-dev package when installing sagecell-0.9.0.spkg After the good apt-get install, it works now fine with the 5.0

```
...
checking for sem_init in -lrt... yes
checking for uuid_generate in -luuid... no
configure: error: cannot link with -luuid, install uuid-dev.
Error configuring zeromq.
```
The Sage Cell Server works now fine on my machine. On the same machine, I didn't manage to install the sage-5.2.alpha0 which didn't compiled.

Thanks for this nice work. As all this go too far for my computer skills, i can just test your work but no more...

Hmm, but these all refer to 5.0 and 5.0.1.

Since jdemeyer said:

> Normally such things should be added to $CPPFLAGS, not $CFLAGS.

so the two changes are from him, and jhpalmieri said: 
> This seems to allow compilation on hawk and on mark, and compilation still works on OS X Lion and sage.math.

so the review of that is from him, I don't quite understand why that isn't enough for positive review.  I assume that the CPPFLAGS version was also actually tested, correct?

The current version of the spkg has this in it, so this sounds good enough.

Of course there is this in the SPKG.txt, and presumably other misleading stuff.  Does it matter?

```
== Changelog ==
     
 * For an accurate log of changes, run "hg log" in src/sagenb.
```   

> I wonder if we'll reach 300 comments before this ticket is merged...

I guess so, Jason :)

I misread it.  The line I quote indeed is correct, but there is no top-level hg repository, unlike every other (well, every other recently updated) spkg.

```
$ cd Downloads/sagenb-0.9.0/
$ hg st
abort: There is no Mercurial repository here (.hg not found)!
$ ls -a
.		..		SPKG.txt	spkg-install	src

I see, these things are actually under revision control in src/sagenb as well.  Sorry for the noise.  Great work, all.

Can you confirm if the [patch above](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11080/trac_11080-user_registration.patch.gz) does the job? Then we don't need to prolong the release of 5.2. You can apply it to devel/sagenb by the following command

```
....beta1.11080/devel/sagenb» patch --dry-run -p1 -i /path/to/trac_11080-user_registration.patch
patching file sagenb/notebook/run_notebook.py
....beta1.11080/devel/sagenb» patch -p1 -i /path/to/trac_11080-user_registration.patch
patching file sagenb/notebook/run_notebook.py
```
If the first command returns success, then proceed with the second command.

EDIT: Taken from `git diff 0.9.0 0.10.1` in the sagenb directory. I haven't checked exactly which commit introduced this change.
