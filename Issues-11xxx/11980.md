}
```
The following is not implemented (but can be done for hyperelliptic curves):

```
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(9,'a'))
sage: H = HyperellipticCurve(x^5+x^2+1)
sage: H.count_points(5)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: Point counting only implemented for schemes over prime fields
```
Also, having a `count_points` for all cases, the Frobenius polynomial can be calculated. At the moment, this is calculated via `frobenius_matrix`, which is not always available:

```
sage: R.<t> = PolynomialRing(GF(8, 'a'))
sage: H = HyperellipticCurve(t^5 + t + 2, t + 1)
sage: H.frobenius_polynomial()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: only implemented for curves y^2 = f(x)
```

Further, the zeta function can be calculated easily when the Frobenius polynomial is known.

Use git branch.

In case f has even degree, the points at infinity are counted incorrectly by this patch. To get the correct characteristic polynomial of Frobenius, we must consider the smooth model of the curve. This is what you get when you desingularize at infinity. This smooth curve has 0, 1 or 2 points at infinity defined over the base field, so instead of just with 1, the count must start with 0, 1 or 2. (The count will not always agree with the count from the base class, as the base class thinks about the singular curve. See also #11800.)

In case `H : y^2 = f(x)` with degree(f) > 2, there are three cases:

* degree(f) is odd: there is a unique point at infinity over the base field (a rational Weierstrass point at infinity)
* degree(f) is even and its leading coefficient is a square: there are two points at infinity defined over the base field
* degree(f) is even and its leading coefficient is not a square: there is no point at infinity defined over the base field (there are two points over a quadratic extension, and they are conjugate to each other)

A similar list of cases can be written down in greater generality (including characteristic 2).

Alternative to get the patch in quickly: raise an error if the curve is not of the form `y^2 = f(x)` with f of odd degree > 2.

Ok, so Ive finished #15148, and after looking at what was I suggested here, I think what has to be done here, on top of #15148:
* we should add the zeta_function method,
* enhance the naive point counting I introduced in #15148 with some ideas from this ticket, namely replace my use of the extension method of finite fields by that of embeddings of a subfield into a super field using the Hom functor and the embedding it computes.

IIRC there is no deep mathematics introduced here.

Just need to use jacobi symbols to know how many ordinates go with an abscissa (0,1 or 2), the number of points at infinity (as here IIRC we're really computing the number of points on the desingularization of the curve).

The zeta funciton thing is just a very simple toy addition.
