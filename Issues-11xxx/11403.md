```
sage: R.<t> = Zq(8,2,'fixed-mod')
sage: 1/(t+t^2)
...
Unhandled SIGABRT: An abort() occurred in Sage.
```

Note that `t + t^2` is invertible:

```
sage: R.<t> = Zq(8,2,'fixed-mod')
sage: u = (t+1) + 2*t^2; u
(t + 1) + t^2*2 + O(2^2)
sage: u * (t + t^2)
1 + O(2^2)
```

Part of the issue is a missing `sig_on()`/`sig_off()`.
