Due to fussier linkers, Singular will not build on the current version of Ubuntu Oneiric (11.10). This was reported at [https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/aL8b9phz3Xc/discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/aL8b9phz3Xc/discussion):

```
(Cf. also [comment:ticket:11674:27] ff.)

The fix is to flip the order of `-ldl` and `-lkernel`, or append a second `-ldl` in the linking steps.

This may already be fixed upstream (cf. #10903); if so, this ticket should be closed. If not, [the Sage/Singular Days (SD34)](http://wiki.sagemath.org/days34) would be the perfect time to fix it.

According to Hannes, this is now **fixed in svn revision 14381**, i.e., not yet in any stable upstream release, so we should incorporate at least that patch into some new Singular spkg.

Fixed spkg to be found at #10903.


Depends on #10903

Making this a **blocker**, since IMHO at least a work-around should be in the **final Sage 4.7.2**, likely to be released [right] before the final Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot).

If we don't get a new Singular spkg fixing this from SD34, we should provide an spkg just adding `-ldl` to `LDFLAGS` (on Linux only), or applying the upstream fix from the svn. (Haven't tried the latter yet; should IMHO work, despite the age of our current Singular version.)
