Sorry for the patch bomb. I thought it would be a good idea to clean up the formatting, like consistently line-wrapping up to 76 characters. I can make another patch without the line re-wrapping noise if that is desirable.

Keshav, your changes look great, but I dumped a lot of crap on top of it...

Oh, I thought my reviewing your original patch was considered reviewing. Does the concept of reviewing apply to whole tickets, rather than patches, in which case I obviously can't review myself? :-)

Welcome to the fold, then :) I'm certainly no policy maker around here, but I think people should feel free to roll up their sleeves and fix code without worrying about diff noise. We're using version control systems which should be able to handle that kind of stuff easily anyway, unlike a decade ago, say...
