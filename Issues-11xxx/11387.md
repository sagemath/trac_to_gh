Sorry for the patch bomb. I thought it would be a good idea to clean up the formatting, like consistently line-wrapping up to 76 characters. I can make another patch without the line re-wrapping noise if that is desirable.

Keshav, your changes look great, but I dumped a lot of crap on top of it...

Thanks for the encouragement! I'm new to Sage development (and open-source development, for that matter). :-) I'm not quite sure where the line is between "beneficial but massive cleanup that no one had bothered to do" versus "lots of differencing noise that makes patches hard to review." In other words, I couldn't decide whether my patch was "scope creeping" beyond the original intent of the ticket.

I knew about 79 characters for code, but I didn't know about 72 for documentation. I naively used the series of hyphens on line 12, which is 76 characters long, as my guide... I will come back with a new patch.

Oh, I thought my reviewing your original patch was considered reviewing. Does the concept of reviewing apply to whole tickets, rather than patches, in which case I obviously can't review myself? :-)
