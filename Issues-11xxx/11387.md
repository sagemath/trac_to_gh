Sorry for the patch bomb. I thought it would be a good idea to clean up the formatting, like consistently line-wrapping up to 76 characters. I can make another patch without the line re-wrapping noise if that is desirable.

Keshav, your changes look great, but I dumped a lot of crap on top of it...

Oh, I thought my reviewing your original patch was considered reviewing. Does the concept of reviewing apply to whole tickets, rather than patches, in which case I obviously can't review myself? :-)
