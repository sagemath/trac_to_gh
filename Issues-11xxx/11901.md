This is a follow-up to #7852 (and #11897).

As [reported on sage-release](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/msg/e885e53316c6880f), some doctests in Sage 4.7.2.alpha3 still failed on a PowerPC running MacOS X 10.4 due to numerical noise (or slightly different behaviour, giving correct but varying results).

The patch here further increases the threshold for noisy zero terms of polynomials slightly.
