This patch adds two developper tools in sage.misc.dev_tools:

- An interface to the graphical profiler ```runsnake```.
  See e.g. the attached image which shows a graphical profile 
  of listing all the elements of SymmetricGroup(3), and highlights
  the current GAP interface issue with select on certain linux 
  kernels. See also #11291.

- A function import_statements:

```
        sage: import_statements(WeylGroup, lazy_attribute)
        from sage.combinat.root_system.weyl_group import WeylGroup
        from sage.misc.lazy_attribute import lazy_attribute

        sage: import_statements(WeylGroup, lazy_attribute, lazy=True)
        from sage.misc.lazy_import import lazy_import
        lazy_import('sage.combinat.root_system.weyl_group', 'WeylGroup')
        lazy_import('sage.misc.lazy_attribute', 'lazy_attribute')
```

To achieve this, it also extracts a function get_main_globals out of inject_variables.

Applying the patch (toward the combinat queue), runsnake works well on my machine in sage. (I had to remove my old runsnake function in .sage/init.sage and re-install RunSankeRun vis easy-install).

<a id='comment:5'></a>**Runsnake**

Can you give at least a slight hint how to use runsnake? I used easy_install inside a Sage shell, but apparently something (wxPython?) is missing. I thought easy_install is supposed to take care of dependencies.

Also, I think you should give examples how to use the profiler from within Sage. From runsnake's documentation, I guess one does something like

```
sage: import cProfile
sage: cProfile.run'L=[singular(i)==gap(i)==i+1 for i in range(2000)]'
cProfile.run     cProfile.runctx  
sage: cProfile.runctx('L=[singular(i)==gap(i)==i+1 for i in range(2000)]', globals(),locals(), filename="OpenGLContext.profile" )
```
but what afterwards?

Does one need to leave Sage, start a Sage shell, and then open `OpenGLContext.profile` by `runsnake OpenGLContext.profile`? (That step did not work for me, it seems I need to get wx) 

Can one use it without leaving Sage?

**import_statements**

That tool seems useful. I doubt, however, that it is robust enough. I see that you ask for the `__module__` attribute. It is not always present, at least for methods or for extension classes that forgot to initialise the category:

```
sage: from sage.structure.element import Element
sage: Element.parent.__module__
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

/mnt/local/king/SAGE/sage-4.7.alpha5/<ipython console> in <module>()

AttributeError: 'method_descriptor' object has no attribute '__module__'
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: P.__module__
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

/mnt/local/king/SAGE/broken/devel/sage-main/<ipython console> in <module>()

/mnt/local/king/SAGE/broken/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/structure/parent.so in sage.structure.parent.Parent.__getattr__ (sage/structure/parent.c:5618)()

/mnt/local/king/SAGE/broken/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/structure/parent.so in sage.structure.parent.raise_attribute_error (sage/structure/parent.c:2636)()

AttributeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomialRing_libsingular' object has no attribute '__module__'
```

Worse, the `__module__` attribute can be misleading. Unfortunately, it is particularly misleading if you initialise the category of a parent:

```
sage: P._is_category_initialized()
False
sage: P._init_category_(Algebras(QQ))
sage: P.__module__
'sage.categories.algebras'
sage: import_statements(P)
from sage.categories.category import CommutativeAlgebras.parent_class
```
That import statement yields a syntax error.

Also, I recall that sometimes the `__module__` attribute is `None` (but I can't remember a typical example).

I would recommend to use the tools from sage.misc.sageinspect, but only after applying #9976, which considerably extends the capabilities of finding source files (here: sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx), from which one can deduce the import statement.

I am not sure if this is enough to make it "needs work", though.

Cheers,
Simon

<a id='comment:6'></a>Hello! I just posted a reviewer's patch that addresses some documentation
issues. The docstrings for the Profiler module needed to be fixed so that they
rendered correctly in the reference manual.

Note that this patch depends on #11251, since you are using the new todo
directive that is implemented in that ticket.

I am willing to give this a positive review, provided my changes are
acceptable.

Let me try to address Simon's comments:

Replying to [comment:5 SimonKing]:
> **Runsnake**
> 
> Can you give at least a slight hint how to use runsnake? 


There is an example on how to use it provided in the
documentation:

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: runsnake("list(SymmetricGroup(3))")     # optional - requires runsnake
```
The expected behaviour is that a window pops up (see the screenshot).

> Does one need to leave Sage, start a Sage shell, and then open `OpenGLContext.profile` by `runsnake OpenGLContext.profile`? (That step did not work for me, it seems I need to get wx) 
> 
> Can one use it without leaving Sage?


Yes. One needs only run the function in the example above. This function
initializes the profiler and (doing essentially what you wrote above),
and then launches runsnake.

> **import_statements**
> 
> That tool seems useful.


Agreed. It looks very nice.

> Worse, the `__module__` attribute can be misleading. Unfortunately, it is particularly misleading if you initialise the category of a parent:


This issue is documented in a "todo" block, but this todo block does not
appear in the command-line view of the documentation. So that's probably why
you didn't see it (it does appear if you ask for source
`import_statements??`). This is not a problem with this ticket though, but
with the todo directive; see #11251.

> I would recommend to use the tools from sage.misc.sageinspect, but only after applying #9976, which considerably extends the capabilities of finding source files (here: sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx), from which one can deduce the import statement.


Perhaps this might be a good idea and can address the issue that the
`__module__` attribute is not always present. I'll leave it to Nicolas to
comment on this.

Positive review on your review patch, assuming the buildbot goes green.

If you know how to improve this on top of your head, please go ahead!
Otherwise, I'll vote for just pushing this as is, and fix it later. It
is annoying if this method is not robust, but not dangerous, and we
want to let it be used to get feedback.

<a id='comment:9'></a>I thought that the improvements to sageinspect from #9976 would make things robust enough, so that sage_getfile could be used to extract the information on where to import stuff from.

But with or without #9976, we have

```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: P??
Error getting source: could not find class definition
...
Docstring [source file open failed]:
    File: sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx (starting
    at line 229)
    
       Construct a multivariate polynomial ring subject to the following
       conditions:
    
       INPUT:
    
       * ``base_ring`` - base ring (must be either GF(q), ZZ, ZZ/nZZ,
            QQ or absolute number field)
    
       * ``n`` - number of variables (must be at least 1)
    
       * ``names`` - names of ring variables, may be string of list/tuple
    
       * ``order`` - term order (default: ``degrevlex``)
```

The "Error getting source: could not find class definition" is annoying. Note that the doc string above gives the correct location and line number! So, sage.misc._extract_embedded_position should be able to do the job, but it isn't.

I think improving the introspection further should be on a different ticket, on top of #9976.

<a id='comment:10'></a>I just opened #11298 (ready for review).

With it, we obtain:

```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getsourcelines, sage_getfile
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: P._init_category_(Algebras(QQ))
sage: P.__module__

<a id='comment:11'></a>## Ubuntu/Debian `RunSnakeRun` install

Along with a few missteps, this is what I needed to do to have `RunSnakeRun` on an Ubuntu Lucid system.  Presumably this will work for other Debian-based distributions.

wxPython

Follow instructions at:

http://wiki.wxpython.org/InstallingOnUbuntuOrDebian

Python easy_install setup program, pstats profiling module, `RunSnakeRun` itself

```
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-profiler

OK, but my personal problem is that I am not root for the computer in my office. So, installing an Ubuntu package seems non-trivial to me.

I tried installing wxpython from sources and also tried the experimental wxpython spkg. In both cases, the problem was that gtk+ has not been found, although it is globally installed. The sysadmin tries to help me, but I don't know if it will work eventually.

<a id='comment:18'></a>Hi, I pushed a review concerning two minor things I ran into:

on the sage command line, spaces do not cause trouble, but the profiler doesn't like them:

```
sage: runsnake(' 3')
...
IndentationError: unexpected indent (<string>, line 1)
```

Now, spaces are deleted (or does anyone see problems occurring from that?).

The second is that sage accepts "^", while python doesn't, so these are replaced by "**".

```
sage: runsnake('QQ(3)^2')
...
RuntimeError: Use ** for exponentiation, not '^', which means xor
in Python, and has the wrong precedence.
```

You can fold the changes if you like, or remove them otherwise...

Btw: the patch doesn't apply on a plain 4.6.2.

Best, Christian

The problem is that the Sage shell sets PYTHONPATH and PYTHONLIB. You may try to work around this by using

```
     python -E runsnake ...
```

which tells Python to ignore those variables. The runsnake command inside Sage does just that, for precisely that reason.

I gave it a try, and have some comments.

1. The patch does not apply cleanly on top of sage-4.7.rc1; in the file `doc/en/reference/misc.rst` there is a conflict because of `classgraph`. So your patch needs a very trivial rebase.

2. I checked and it seems that wxPython is already installed on two different Mac OS X systems I tested. Is this a standard python library on Mac OSX? So there might be no need to install it.

3. Just running runsnake does not work:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/runsnake", line 8, in <module>
    load_entry_point('RunSnakeRun==2.0.1', 'gui_scripts', 'runsnake')()
  File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/RunSnakeRun-2.0.1-py2.6.egg/runsnakerun/macshim.py", line 7, in macshim
    env={"VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT":"yes"}
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/subprocess.py", line 444, in call
    return Popen(*popenargs, **kwargs).wait()
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/subprocess.py", line 595, in __init__
    errread, errwrite)
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/subprocess.py", line 1106, in _execute_child
    raise child_exception
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```
So I started poking around in `macshim.py`. It seems the problem is with the env dictionary

```
    env={"VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT":"yes"}
```
The documentation for the subprocess module says that env must provide any variables required for the program to execute. This includes the path; so one either needs to provide the path to runsnake32 as an environment variable, or just give the complete path to runsnake32. Here is a modified version of `macshim.py` that works for me:

```
def macshim():
    """Shim to run 32-bit on 64-bit mac as a sub-process"""
    import subprocess, sys
    subprocess.call([
        sys.argv[0]+'32'
    ]+sys.argv[1:],
        env={"VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT":"yes"}
    )
```

It depends on #11108 which is already merged in 4.7.1. I added this in the dependency list.

Ah, it seems like the script gets installed in: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/runsnakerun

Could you try to run it?

My best guess is that for some reason python2.7 is not considered as the default Python install on your machine, and thus python scripts are not installed in the general /usr/local/bin.

Cheers,
				Nicolas
