The following does not work

```
sage: K.<t> = NumberField(x^5-9*x^4+22*x-71)
sage: v = K.ideal(2, t^3 - 8*t^2 - 7*t - 3)
sage: c = K.class_group()(v)
sage: c.order()
```

giving a type-error. While it should give back 3.

The problem was sorted out in #11234, which was merged in sage-4.7.1.alpha0.   So I think this ticket can be closed as a duplicate.
