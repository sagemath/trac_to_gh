-x + y > 0 and x - y > 0  are treated the same in Sage.  

```python
sage: version()
'Sage Version 4.6.2, Release Date: 2011-02-25'

sage: (-x +y < 0) in [x -y < 0] 
True 

Set([-x +y >= 0,x -y >= 0]) 
{-x + y >= 0} 
```

and they have the same Hash

```python
sage: var('x,y') 
(x, y) 
sage: hash(-x + y > 0 )
1221566266
sage: hash(-x + y >= 0 )
1221566266
sage: hash(x - y >= 0 )
1221566266
sage: hash(-y + x >= 0 )
1221566266
sage: hash(x - y > 0 )
1221566266
```

It seems to me that Sage treats `>`, `>=`, and `==` the same (see #7660). If this is true then it's a serious problem and needs to be addressed.

I don't know how to apply this patch though  - if you can walk me through it then I can test.  

But in the mean time, what are the result for these commands ?   If the results are different than the defected version above and as expected then probably the patch is correct.  

sage: (-x +y < 0) in [x -y < 0] 

Set([-x +y >= 0,x -y >= 0]) 

sage: var('x,y') 
(x, y) 
sage: hash(-x + y > 0 )
sage: hash(-x + y >= 0 )
sage: hash(x - y >= 0 )
sage: hash(-y + x >= 0 )
sage: hash(x - y > 0 )

Sage is really large as it is. While I'd be really interested to have this capability in Sage, I don't know how many others would want it in the standard distribution. The first step is to start with an optional package/prototype. We can see where it goes from there. :)

Which prover are you thinking of? What would this let us do in Sage? Perhaps you should write a message to sage-devel about this.

So all the above examples of whether if exp1 == exp2  should be easily answered with SMT.

sage: assume(a)
sage: assumptions()
[x - 2 <= 0, x - 1 <= 0]
```
Before, the second assumption didn't obtain, because currently

```

sage: c = (x-2<=0)
sage: L = [c]
sage: L
[x - 2 <= 0]
sage: a = (x-1<=0)
sage: a in L
True
```
which is not good.  See [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/H-QcXkNCajM).

<a id='comment:40'></a>The code itself seems fine right now, thanks for such fast action and especially for actual comments in the code!  

Did you do any timing runs on previously-working comparisons?  I agree that it would be good for someone who knows to comment on whether there is some obvious optimization missing.  For instance, lines 1241ff. would be nicer if it so happened there was a "operator.opposite()" function which reversed `<=` and `>=` (though someone else might want them to be complements, `<=` and `>`).    Similarly for the rhs/lhs comparisons.

Keshav, do you mind putting in a test in your patch for 

```
sage: (x-1<0) in [x-2<0]
False
```
just to test for the comment:33 issue?  While we wait for someone more knowledgeable... but as I said it does seem good to go.

<a id='comment:44'></a>Hmm, this is a big slowdown in at least one case.

```
# old
sage: timeit("(x < y) != (y > x)")
625 loops, best of 3: 2.76 µs per loop
# new
sage: timeit("(x < y) != (y > x)")
625 loops, best of 3: 13.3 µs per loop
```
It looks like it's fairly constantly adding this.  Here, in the much slower checking of a list

```
# old
sage: timeit("(x - 1 < 0) in [x - 2 < 0]")
625 loops, best of 3: 104 µs per loop
# new
sage: timeit("(x - 1 < 0) in [x - 2 < 0]")
625 loops, best of 3: 116 µs per loop
```
Here's another one.

```
# old
sage: timeit("(y > y) != (y > y) ")
625 loops, best of 3: 2.24 µs per loop
# new
sage: timeit("(y > y) != (y > y) ")

True 
sage: (-x + y == 0) == (0 == -x + y) 
True 
sage: (x < y) == (y > x)

False 
sage: (-x + y == 0) == (0 == -x + y)

sage: (x < y) == (y > x)

```

The main reason why I report this in the first place is because of this error in which multiplying by -1 does not switch the sign.  I think they are related but not sure.  

```
sage: -1 * (x<5)

Personally I don't see why `x * (y < z)` should even be simplified to anything other than `x * (y < z)`. `y < z` is a mathematical object which does not live in a space which has a multiplication operation - it lives in the space of logical predicates. But that is something to address in a different ticket. Testing the title of this ticket:

```
sage: Set([-x + y > 0, -y + x >= 0, x - y > 0])    
{-x + y > 0, x - y >= 0, x - y > 0}
sage: len(_)   
3
```

So the patches do at least address and solve the issue in the ticket's name.

This is #7660. It would be quite easy to remove the `if is_a_relational(left._gobj)` checks in `_add_, `_mul_`, etc. in `sage/symbolic/expression.pyx` to revert back to GiNaC behavior.
