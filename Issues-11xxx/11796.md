There is an inconsistency between functions `nbits()`, `bits()` and `digits(base=2)` when applied to zero:

```
sage: 0.nbits()
1
sage: 0.ndigits(base=2)
0
sage: 0.bits()
[]
sage: 0.digits(base=2)
[]

I checked all doctests with Sage 4.7.1 and they all still pass. Strangely the value of nbits for
0 was never tested nor apparently used.

Marion,

this is strange, since on my laptop (Core 2 Duo) with Sage 4.7.1 those 5 long doctests pass.

Please can you try again those 5 doctests? Just run for example

```
sage -t -long databases/database.py}}} in the right directory.
Did they pass without the patch?

Ok, on my Sage without the patch all these 5 doctests failed too (I did not check the tests on the version I downloaded first...)
I will investigate further where the problem comes from.

Marion, you can also try on a computer where all doctests pass before the patch, and open a

The problem was already mentioned in #10596.
But there `ndigits()` was changed to return 1 instead of 0.

So, whose solution is *correct* and why?

I cannot apply the patches from #10596 to Sage 4.7:

```
sage: hg_sage.import_patch("/tmp/trac_10596.patch")
cd "/usr/local/sage/devel/sage" && hg status
cd "/usr/local/sage/devel/sage" && hg status
cd "/usr/local/sage/devel/sage" && hg import   "/tmp/trac_10596.patch"
applying /tmp/trac_10596.patch
patching file sage/rings/integer.pyx
Hunk #4 succeeded at 566 with fuzz 2 (offset -34 lines).
Hunk #69 FAILED at 5248
1 out of 80 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/rings/integer.pyx.rej
```

What is inconsistent is that we should have `0.nbits() == len(0.bits()) == 0.ndigits(base=2) == len(0.digits(base=2))`, which currently does not hold.

Now if `0.nbits()` is 1, then `0.bits()` should be `[0]`.
I would prefer to return 0 and [] respectively, but first solve the inconsistency.
