Not loading *sagenb.misc.misc* on normal sage startup speeds up sage startup:

```
$ dumbbench -- ./sage --startuptime
Ran 25 iterations (4 outliers).
Rounded run time per iteration: 9.80e-01 +/- 1.3e-02 (1.3%)
```

vs.

```
dumbbench -- ./sage --startuptime
Ran 21 iterations (1 outliers).
Rounded run time per iteration: 9.38e-01 +/- 1.5e-02 (1.6%)
```

Replying to [@saraedum](#comment%3A9):
> the sagenb.misc.misc import is faster in the latest alpha and it's harder to get rid of it now, so I guess it's not worth it anymore.

Are you referring to alpha2 or the [alpha3 prerelease](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/release/sage-4.7.2.alpha3-prerelease/)?

Anyway, I can close this ticket if you give it "positive review" in the sense that it is invalid / fixed / no longer worth doing.
