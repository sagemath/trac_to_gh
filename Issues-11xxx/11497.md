Here's a new one: Cygwin fails on Twisted.  Note that this has been observed once, on an XP virtual machine.  Not on all XP instances, weirdly.

The error looks like errors linking `_pmap_set` and `_pmap_unset`.

The internet (e.g. [this patch](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/attachment/ticket/1820/runner-setup-2.patch)) says that the problem is in twisted/runner/topfiles/setup.py.

The fix is to add the rpc library like in the [original fix](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/1820) to that Twisted ticket.

Welcome back!

Yes, this was only ever an XP problem, as far as I know.

If you can verify this spkg doesn't cause problems on Win 7, then I think that would be enough to positively review and merge. You are right that XP is less and less important in the long run, of course.

Almost certainly not - the devels on the link above seemed not to care too much - the last change was 18 months ago, and they didn't want to do anything without a Cygwin slave.  I can try to see whether the new package applies sometime tonight, but I doubt that it's in upstream.  And of course this was only ever on XP.

Still, if you can apply this without too much trouble on yours, with a patch applied only in case of Cygwin, I think that would be a good idea.

After testing on the newest Cygwin on XP, I think this issue may have been an older Cygwin issue, not an XP issue per se.  I have no problems building the current p2, the p3 on this ticket, or Twisted 11 on #11874.  Setting to sage-invalid, keeping Reg as a reviewer for checking this worked on Vista and Dima for checking on Win 7 this wasn't necessary.
