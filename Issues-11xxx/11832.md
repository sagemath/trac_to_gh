Profile functions for the Steenrod algebra, especially at odd primes, are a little buggy: 

```
sage: P3 = SteenrodAlgebra(p=3, profile=(lambda n: Infinity, lambda n: 1))
sage: P3._has_nontrivial_profile()
False
```
This should be `True`.

```
sage: P3._profile
((+Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity), (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1))
```
All of the "Infinity"s should be omitted.

```
sage: SteenrodAlgebra(p=3, profile=((3,2,1), lambda n: 1))
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'NoneType' and 'int'
```
This error shouldn't happen.

These bugs are in the function `steenrod_algebra_misc.normalize_profile_function` and in the method `_has_nontrivial_profile` in `steenrod_algebra.SteenrodAlgebra_generic`.  The attached patch fixes these, and it also speeds up `steenrod_algebra_misc.is_valid_profile:

```
sage: sage: from sage.algebras.steenrod.steenrod_algebra_misc import is_valid_profile, normalize_profile
sage: pro = normalize_profile(lambda n: n)
sage: timeit('is_valid_profile(pro[0], pro[1], p=2)') # before
5 loops, best of 3: 334 ms per loop

sage: timeit('is_valid_profile(pro[0], pro[1], p=2)') # after
125 loops, best of 3: 3.99 ms per loop
```

I don't know what a "profile" is, and maybe no other Sage developers do.  But the code looks good and works.   I think it makes sense to just trust our resident algebraic topologist in this case.
