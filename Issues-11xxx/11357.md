Version 1.15 of GSL was released on 5th May this year, so this ticket updates from 1.14 to 1.15. 

Apart from fixing some GSL bugs, my own changes to build this on AIX have been accepted upstream, so this package will now build on AIX. This means #10000 can be closed when this is merged.

I'm just in the process of building sage-4.7.rc4, but have dropped in the new gsl package. I'll then doctest this. The patch looks fine to me, but I'll double check it. It's 2230 here, so I may or may not do this before I go to bed. I don't take too long on this machine (about an 60-90 minutes to build Sage and run all the long doctests), but I'm feeling a bit tired. Will probably hit the bed soon. 

Let me know if you think my package is ok. If so, and I'm happy with your patch, I'll mark us both as reviewers and set it to positive review.

So far it looks good, I installed it on my x86 box and rebuild an earlier sage-4.7,
I am not too hot about tests on that machine anymore (minimum 4 hours, long test 6 to 7) but I'll do a full test on OSX 10.5.8 later today.

If you are happy with my GSL package, then this can be set to positive review.
