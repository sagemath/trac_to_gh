As noted below, this turned out to just be an issue of increasing the precision in the pari function call. The attached patch fixes the problem:

This seems to be problem in the pari function call, or possibly a bug in pari. I have [emailed](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-dev-1209/msg00042.html) the pari development group to ask them about it. 

This failure appears much earlier than the example above suggests:

```
sage: PartitionTuples(17,2).cardinality()
...
TypeError: unable to convert x (=  ***   at top-level: polcoeff(1/eta(x)^2,
  ***                 ^--------------------
  *** polcoeff: non existent component in truecoeff.) to an integer
```

If you run pari natively you get the error more quickly:

```
Desktop: sage -gp
GP/PARI CALCULATOR Version 2.5.2 (development git-b703ee3)
i386 running darwin (x86-64/GMP-5.0.2 kernel) 64-bit version

Type ? for help, \q to quit.

parisize = 8000000, primelimit = 500509
? polcoeff(1/eta(x)^2, 16, x)
%1 = 5822
? polcoeff(1/eta(x)^2, 17, x)
  ***   at top-level: polcoeff(1/eta(x)^2,
  ***                 ^--------------------
  *** polcoeff: non existent component in truecoeff.
  ***   Break loop: type 'break' to go back to GP
```

This is a little surprising as the number of 2-tuples of partitions adding to 17 is 8470, which isn't that big.

I had a reply from Karim Belabas (UMR 5251) on pari-dev and it is just a matter of increasing the precision:

```
(08:12) gp > 1/eta(x)^2
%1 = 1 + 2*x + 5*x^2 + 10*x^3 + 20*x^4 + 36*x^5 + 65*x^6 + 110*x^7 + 185*x^8 + 300*x^9 + 481*x^10 + 752*x^11 + 1165*x^12 + 1770*x^13 + 2665*x^14 + 3956*x^15 + 5822*x^16 + O(x^17)

The series precision is too low, so the 17-th coefficient is unknown. Use

  1/eta(x + O(x^101))

if you want to access its 100-th coefficient (for instance).

Cheers,

    K.B.
```

I'll upload a patch shortly.

Looks good, just do an automatic trac link <code>:trac:\`11476\`</code> in the doc.

Thanks.

PS - Its somewhat entertaining to me to compute these huge numbers:

```
sage: PartitionTuples(162,120).cardinality()
414170543784152902405501503878656556915420510510717572175693806227335527665907778197451415072951
