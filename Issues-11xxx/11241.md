```
sage: Q = QuadraticForm(ZZ, 2, [1,1,1])
sage: F = Q.theta_series_degree_2(20)  
sage: map(type, F.values())            
[<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>, <type 'int'>, <type 'int'>, <type 'int'>, <type 'int'>, <type 'int'>, <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>, <type 'int'>]
```

For consistency, all the returned coefficients should be in ZZ.
