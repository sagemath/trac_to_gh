Multivariate power series are implemented at #1956.  This ticket calls for a minor change to big_oh so that it can be used for multivariate power series:

```
sage: T.<a,b> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ,2)
sage: f = 1 + a + b + a*b + T.O(5)
sage: f + O(a,b)^2
1 + a + b + O(a, b)^2
```
Without this ticket, `O()` accepts only a single argument.

Depends on #1956
