The following fails

```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: S = R.fraction_field()
sage: S(pari((x+y)/y))
TypeError: no canonical coercion from Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field to Rational Field
```
However, if you replace (x+y)/y with x+y, it works (in other words, polynomials work but rational functions don't).

The problem seems to be this:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: a=pari((x+y)/y); a
1/y*x + 1
sage: a.numerator()
1/y*x + 1
sage: a.denominator()
1
```
Note that the following does work:

```
sage: b=pari((x+y)/x); b
(x + y)/x
sage: b.numerator()
x + y
sage: b.denominator()
x
```
Note also that the PARI types are different:

```
sage: a.type()
't_POL'
sage: b.type()
't_RFRAC'
```
This difference arises because PARI treats multivariate polynomials as iterated univariate polynomials.  To PARI, *a* lives in **Q**(*y*)[*x*], and *b* in Frac(**Q**[*y*][*x*]).

The solution is probably to convert PARI elements of type `t_POL` coefficientwise into *S*.
