Also `s/Striping/Stripping/` once... ;-)

`spkg/build/` should also be deleted (if present).

There are some static libraries in subdirectories, too, and we should also delete libtool's `.la` files. Strip `.dylib`s on Mac OS X? DLLs and `.exe`s on Cygwin?

Also, this should be added to the Developer's Guide, perhaps also the Sage Installation Guide.

The stripping has issues as it is currently implemented: `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libpython2.6.so` is installed read-only, which makes `make micro-release` fail:

```
[sage@sage sage]$ ll local/lib/libpython2.6.so.1.0 
-r-xr-xr-x. 1 sage sage 4459077 Nov  7 15:17 local/lib/libpython2.6.so.1.0
[sage@sage sage]$ strip local/lib/libpython2.6.so.1.0 
strip: unable to copy file 'local/lib/libpython2.6.so.1.0'; reason: Permission denied
[sage@sage sage]$ strip local/lib/libpython2.6.so
strip: unable to copy file 'local/lib/libpython2.6.so'; reason: Permission denied
```
If I change the permissions manually then I can strip it, of course, but then the Python script `sage-micro_release` segfaults while stripping `libpython2.6.so`. You must not modify the library that your script is depending on while running.

What about: make a writeable copy of libpython2.6.so, strip the copy, move the copy to the original; the latter should be done in the proper kamikaze way (the script should go down with a smile, not with a segfault) --- perhaps passing control to a shell script and then exit...

I get this error if I execute make micro_release of sage 4.7.2 on a fresh debian_live install:

root@meow:/media/sda6/sage-4.7.2# make micro_release
. local/bin/sage-env && local/bin/sage-micro_release
Stripping .so files in local/lib
strip "/media/sda6/sage-4.7.2/local/lib/libz.so"
Bus error
Error executing command.  Failed with exit status 34560.
make: *** [micro_release] Error 1

I don't know if this may help with anything, but these are the strip commands on the whole sage tree I already successfully used (executed in $SAGE_HOME):

# Step 1) for executables
 find . | xargs file | grep "executable" | grep ELF | cut -f 1 -d : |
xargs strip --strip-unneeded 2> /dev/null
# Step 2) for shared libraries
 find . | xargs file | grep "shared object" | grep ELF | cut -f 1 -d : | xargs strip --strip-unneeded 2> /dev/null

Comparison:
Step 1 got -50 MB
Step 2 got -250 MB

In the sage-micro_relase script stripping is performed only for selected libraries with 'strip "%s"'%filename (.i.e without the flag --strip-unneeded. This can lead to problems for libraries - I *think* the --strip-unneeded flag is recommended).

On my sage-4.8 and 5.0.beta* "make micro_release" might fail for two reasons:
- segfault while trying to strip libpython
- permission error while trying to strip system atlas libraries.
