There are two way to get the list of the elements of a `FiniteEnumeratedSet`:

```
     list(FSet)
     FSet.list()
```
The first case uses `FSet.__iter__` which is slow in many practical case, for example because of deep `yield` recursion...

After a discussion with Nicolas, We decided the following: In the second case,
we assume that there is a need for speed and therefore we take chance to cache
the list. Here is an example of speedup (needs conbinat patches installed):

```
sage: %timeit list(BinaryTrees(5))
25 loops, best of 3: 24.7 ms per loop
sage: %timeit BinaryTrees(5).list()
625 loops, best of 3: 6.7 µs per loop
```
