The attached patch solves an issue with jmol finding the right .jmol.zip file in the new flask notebook.  This patch should only be applied *after* the notebook is moved to a flask notebook.

The patch should replace the following line in `sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx`

```
f.write('set defaultdirectory "%s"\n' % archive_name)
```
with

```
import sagenb
f.write('set defaultdirectory "cells/%s/%s"\n' % (sagenb.notebook.interact.SAGE_CELL_ID, archive_name))
```

I updated the patch with the changes from #11503.  With the flask notebook, sphere() works both from the command line and from the notebook.

I'm setting as needs review to have one other person double-check this patch works as intended, though I guess I might qualify as the only needed reviewer.  Basically, what I did here was just rebase the patch at #11503.
