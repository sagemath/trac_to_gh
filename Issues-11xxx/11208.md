```
Having no arrows in an arrow plot (i.e., vector field that is a slope field) now causes warnings from matplotlib.

```
y = var('y') 
g = 1 
P=plot_slope_field(g,(x,3,4),(y,-1,1)) 
P 
<two sets of warnings> 
```
DSM has a diagnosis at [this sage-support thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/49471ab062fcb8e9)

```
P=plot_slope_field(g,(x,3,4),(y,-1,1),headlength=1e-8) 
works for me.  FYI, it's the following few lines in Quiver._h_arrows at fault: 
        minsh = self.minshaft * self.headlength 
        [....] 
        shrink = length/minsh 
        X0 = shrink * X0[np.newaxis,:] 
        Y0 = shrink * Y0[np.newaxis,:] 
Probably we should change the defaults and/or (if it's not done 
already) ask our matplotlib friends to special-case 0 for no 
arrowheads.
```
So maybe this should be reported upstream?  See also #2922, which is also about the mpl quivers.

Depends on #10489

Attachment: **[trac_11208_avoid_headless_quiver_warning_v2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11208/trac_11208_avoid_headless_quiver_warning_v2.patch.gz)**

Dropped a message on matplotlib-devel; at least one dev thought special-casing zero was a good idea, so I'll work up a matplotlib patch if I get some time.  Not much pressure to do it on our end now, though.  [PS @kcrisman -- not only was I in the midst, I was typing things like 'hg export tip' as you were writing that..]

Great, make sure to post a link to the discussion on matplotlib-devel.  This applies to beta7 and fixes something we REALLY should have fixed a long time ago.

By the way, it turns out we now have this nice `:trac:` thing for documentation... not needed here, but just fyi for next time, I just found out about five minutes ago.
