Sage behaves unexpectedly when returning a numerical approximation to one digit:

```
sage: n(3.4, digits=1)
3.4
```

This should return 3.

Here is the code:

```
    if prec is None:
        if digits is None:
            prec = 53
        else:
            prec = int((digits+1) * 3.32192) + 1
    try:
        return x._numerical_approx(prec)
```
I think the idea is to give *at least* one correct digit.  It is a numerical approximation, after all, not a truncation.  What would you expect from this? 

```
sage: n(3.7,digits=1)
```
My first instinct, thus, is that this is not a bug, though more details are welcome.

I would expect 4. from that, similar to

```
sage: n(37.7,digits=2)
38.
```

Considering that for any number other than one (except very large ones, see http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10164), the number of digits in the returned number is equal to the digits argument, I think it is an unexpected result. It can be trivially fixed by adding a special case when the argument is one.

Don't expect exact results for decimal arithmetic. The underlying type is base 2. The fact that n allows "digits" to be specified in terms of decimal digits is for convenience only. When you specifying digits=1 you are really asking for ln(10)/ln(2)=3.3219 binary digits. Naturally, the system can't give you exactly what you ask for. In fact the system refuses to give you less than 53 binary digits, because there is no gain in keeping track of less. This translates to almost 16 decimal digits.

If you want decimal arithmetic rather than binary arithmetic (there is a difference when you're working with floats!), use a package that gives you that. See the `decimal` module that comes standard with python. It allows accurately setting the precision with which to do arithmetic.

Sage's "RealNumber" is trying to approximate the real numbers in behaviour. It is not concerned with managing low precisions very accurately.

I think it's acceptable that digits=1 shows some strange behavior. I believe it should at least be documented, so I wrote a patch at #12120 to do so. Btw. should we assert that digits is not 0? Otherwise this should be added at #12120 as well.
