This thread on numpy-discussion points to a nice way to construct a surface from a point cloud.  

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.numeric.general/44470

This is potentially useful, maybe as an option to implicit_plot3d to do a better job of getting a surface?

**Assignee:** @jasongrout, @williamstein

**Status:** new
