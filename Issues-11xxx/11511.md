Assignee: @JohnCremona

CC:  fschulze

Keywords: startup, initialization, sd32, sd35

The import of sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_curve_isogeny.py (which happens on every startup of sage) takes a relatively big amount of time

```
$ time ./sage -startuptime|grep ell_curve_isogeny:
          ell_curve_isogeny: 0.133 (ell_field)

real    0m0.994s
user    0m0.810s
sys     0m0.154s
```
Lazily computing the constants in this file helps a lot (see the attached patch):

```
$ time ./sage -startuptime|grep ell_curve_isogeny:
          ell_curve_isogeny: 0.001 (ell_field)

real    0m0.849s
user    0m0.672s
sys     0m0.164s
```
**Apply:**

1. [attachment:trac_11683_ell_curve_isogeny_speedup_combined.patch]
2. [attachment:trac_11683_review.patch]

to the sage repository.

You're right. I turned the comments describing how to compute the precomputed things into docstrings. Unfortunately they don't seem to work anymore. The line

```
sage: Psi5 = sum([X**i * f.coefficient({x:i})(X,t) for i in range(3)]).monic()
```
fails with

```
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular' object has no attribute 'monic'
```

Can this be fixed easily?

Sorry for the delay.  I'll document this better and make sure that the current documentation and description of the precomputation fits the existing code -- there are some choice to be made.  Meanwhile, here's a small amount of explanatory theory:

For l=2,3,5,7,13, the curve `X_0(l)` has genus zero, so its function field is pure transcendental.  The Fricke Module, denoted t, is a generator of the function field such that t=0 and t=oo lie above j=oo; the normalization here is completely classical, and the situation is fully defined by giving j as a degree l+1 rational function in t, which is what the Fricke_module dict in the code does (though not for l=2 which is simpler and handled entirely separately).

Next one writes down a "universal elliptic curve with l-isogeny", say `E_t`, as a curve over Q(t) with j-invariant j (viewed as an element of Q(t)).  This is not unique!  I have used different choices in the past and this needs sorting out since the later formulas depend on the choice.

Once the model for `E_t` is chosen, Psi is the monic factor of degree (l-1)/2 of the l-division polynomial of `E_t` which defined the isogeny, and which is used in the isogeny code.

I am writing this up -- there's an old preprint of me and Mark Watkins which never got finished, and now there's more delay since with my student Kimi I am extending all this to the cases where `X_0(l)` is hyperelliptic.

Just a remark, it seems sage improved quite a bit on the underlying computation. It is quite a bit faster than 13 hours (that is what the docstring says) already:

```
sage: time a,b=Psi(13, use_stored=True),Psi(13, use_stored=False)
Time: CPU 178.47 s, Wall: 178.51 s
sage: a==b

[the docstring said "10" hours of course]

We fixed a few typos. Looking at the changes to `isogenies_prime_degree_genus_0()` we're wondering if this actually adds any new functionality/fixes a problem? If so, shouldn't there be a doctest for it?

You may be right, but it's a docstring not a textbook or thesis...we are currently finishing similar (though more complicated) code for all the cases where X_0(l) is hyperelliptic, and also getting these genus 0 cases to apply in characteristics 2 and 3, so there will be a lot more to say then (at which point we'll move this code into a separate file too).
