On sage-4.7: In the following example, the degree with respect to *p* should be 1 and the degree with respect to *q* should be 2.

```
sage: R.<p,q,t> = ZZ[]
sage: poly = p+q^2+t^3
sage: poly = poly.polynomial(t)[0]
sage: poly
q^2 + p
sage: poly.degree(p)
1
sage: poly.degree(q)
1
```

The issue can be easily worked around:

```
sage: poly.degree(poly.parent(q))
2
```

I was going to referee this, but instead ended up improving the documentation (a lot) and rewriting the logic a bit.    saraedum can you referee the new patch?

<a id='comment:5'>Comment 5:</a>
all doctests pass on top of sage-4.8.alpha6 on x64, however:

```
sage: R.<p,q,t> = ZZ[]
sage: poly = p+q^2+t^3
sage: poly = poly.polynomial(t)[0]
sage: poly.degree(p)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: argument must canonically coerce to parent
```
I don't understand since the documentation says:

```
sage: poly.degree?
...
Definition:     poly.degree(self, x=None, std_grading=False)
...
       Return the maximal degree of this polynomial in "x", where "x" must
       be one of the generators for the parent of this polynomial.
```
Indeed `p` is one of those generators:

```
sage: p in poly.parent().gens()
True
```
Thus either the code or the documentation has to be fixed.

I tried to make the `INPUT` section a little more precise. But I believe that writing that `x` `'is'` a generator and not only that `x` `'=='` a generator would be overdoing it.

Is it acceptable for you this way?

I don't know. However the following in the description seems wrong:

```
sage: poly.degree(poly.parent(q))
1
```
since I get `2` with Sage 5.1.

David, for the **variables** p and q, there is a trivial conversion...

Anyway the issue raised in comment [comment:5] is still there:

```
sage: poly.degree?
...
       Return the maximal degree of this polynomial in "x", where "x" must
       be one of the generators for the parent of this polynomial.
sage: poly.parent().gens()
(p, q)
sage: poly.degree(p)
...
TypeError: argument must canonically coerce to parent
```
According to the documentation, this should work.

Probably you did not have the latest patch applied. With the latest patch I get:

```
   * "x" - (default: "None") a multivariate polynomial which is (or
     coerces to) a generator of the parent of self. If "x" is "None",
     return the total degree, which is the maximum degree of any
     monomial. Note that a matrix term ordering alters the grading of
     the generators of the ring; see the tests below.  To avoid this
     behavior, use either "exponents()" for the exponents themselves,
     or the optional argument "std_grading=False".
```

all tests pass on top of Sage 6.0 (except one which seems unrelated).
Thus a positive review for me.
