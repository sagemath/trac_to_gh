I tried one simple example "by hand" that actually *uses* lcalc, and was not pleased by what happened:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a')
sage: L = E.lseries()
sage: L.zeros(10)
  ***   Warning: new stack size = 1030944 (0.983 Mbytes).
[0.000000000, 5.00317001, 6.87039122, 8.01433081, 9.93309835, 10.7751382, 11.7573247, 12.9583864, 15.6038579, 16.1920174]
sage: L.zeros(10)
  ***   Warning: new stack size = 1030944 (0.983 Mbytes).
[0.000000000, 5.00317001, 6.87039122, 8.01433081, 9.93309835, 10.7751382, 11.7573247, 12.9583864, 15.6038579, 16.1920174]
```
Basically, every time you use lcalc to do anything with elliptic curve L-series, you get some mysterious warning (of course, really output from PARI).   However, the problem has been in released Sage for a long time.    It was in sage-4.7.

I got this on mod during a doctests (somewhat random failure):

```
