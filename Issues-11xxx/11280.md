Currently, XCode 4 (namely, version 4.0.1) produces a Sage executable that crashes on startup. Here we patch prereqs to guard against it.
Please see http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/54e9c5216ad6451f for more details.

This patch also takes care of #8566.

The patch should be applied in SAGEROOT/spkg/base, using hg import
In same directory, one should place 
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/patches/prereq-0.9.tar
(and remove prereq-0.8.tar; prereq-0.9/ is an exact copy of prereq-0.8/, only 
renamed)

PS. If you want to test this in existing Sage installation, you can start 
../../sage -sh in SAGEROOT/spkg/base, untar prereq-0.9.tar, and start ./prereq-0.9-install

With XCode 2.4:

```
$ xcodebuild -version
Component versions: DevToolsCore-757.0; DevToolsSupport-733.0
```
so in the patch $XCODE_VERS (and $XCODE_VERS_MAJOR) end up being empty.  A more reliable way to check for the version might be what Macports is doing - essentially that's

```
$ defaults read /Developer/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/version CFBundleShortVersionString

One can, I suppose, just do

```
if [ $XCODE_VERS_MAJOR = "" ]; then
   XCODE_VERS_MAJOR="2"
fi
```

OK, you can't build Sage with XCode 2, anyway, right?
So this also should be checked and the installation should exit, isn't it?

Well, technically in this case we might even be seeing XCode 1, but I suppose that that check will do in practice - at least if your check works with even the oldest XCode 3.x versions.

The last time I tried, it worked, but that was almost a year ago (Sage 4.4.3).  I haven't tried since then, but I'll see if I manage to do so within the next couple of days.

If this Xcode version checking is performed, then the version of prereq needs to be incremented to 0.9, otherwise we are going to have different code with the same version number. That means creating a new tar file (prereq-0.8.tar), and changing the TARGET at the top of prereq-0.9-install to:

```
TARGET=prereq-0.9
```

Also, I think the bit of code following:

```
    if [ $XCODE_VERS_MAJOR -gt 2 ]; then
        echo "You are using XCode version " $XCODE_VERS
        echo "WARNING: You are strongly advised to install Apple's latest XCode 3,"
        echo "unless you already have it. You can download this from "
        echo "http://developer.apple.com/xcode/"
    fi
```

should make it clear **not** to install Xcode 4. Although the message says to use the latest Xcode 3, someone reading it is likely to interpret that as to just upgrade. 

Also, why use the -e option to sed? That's for when you want to specify the name of a script. If you put the script inline, as you have done here, the -e can be removed.

Yes, I was.

Agreed, but it can still be removed. It's pointless having it.

Well, I don't follow the 0.9 vs 0.8 question. I really have no idea what you are talking about, in this respect.
Please explain if I need to adjust the patch.

I'll fix the point that "latest" must mean "latest, but not Xcode 4", that's easy.

Dima,

The way Sage checks it's prerequisites is not my idea of a good way, but this is how it works:

* There's an executable shell script `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/prereq-0.8-install` 
* There's a tar file in `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/prereq-0.8.tar`
* When `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/prereq-0.8-install` executes, it extracts the contents of  `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/prereq-0.8.tar`. That tar file has a "`configure`" script generated by autoconf. The "`configure`" script  then executes and does some other tests that are not in the `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/prereq-0.8-install`. 

You are editing a script (currently prereq-0.8-install). Once edited, the version number of that script needs to be incremented, like one does whenever one makes changes to software. The most obvious name in this case would appear to be rename that script to prereq-0.9-install. (Since it under revision control, that needs to be done in Mercurial)

The top of the script has a name hard-coded. That will need the obvious edit. 

i.e. change

```
TARGET=prereq-0.8
```
to

```
TARGET=prereq-0.9
```

The script opens a tar file - if you look down lower you can see the line:

```
tar mxvf "../base/$TARGET.tar"
```

So when you change the TARGET, the script will try to open a tar with a different name. 

So basically

```
$ tar xf prereq-0.8.tar
$ mv prereq-0.8 prereq-0.9
$ tar cf prereq-0.9.tar prereq-0.9
$ rm prereq-0.8.tar
```
Then make your changes to the script prereq-0.8-install, rename it to prereq-0.9-install, then use Mercurial to rename the prereq-0.8-install script. I don't know how to do that, though I suspect it is something like

```
$ hg rename prereq-0.8-install prereq-0.9-install
```

but you will need to check that. You don't need to rename the tar file in Mercurial as that's listed in .hgignore. 

So basically you need to ensure that 
* The script has its version incremented - 0.9 is fine by me.
* The TARGET at the top of the script needs to have the version changed too. 
* A tar file needs to be created which also has 0.9 in the name. 


BTW, if you want to close another bug (#8566) you can delete the character "m" from the line

```
tar mxvf "../base/$TARGET.tar"
```

as that has caused portability issues for a minimal Linux system (slitaz linux), and serves no useful purpose in Sage. 

It's an unusual process this script. I did not design it, and I don't like it. (Personally I would have used autoconf at the top level to create a "`configure`" script, which itself creates "`Makefile`". Then we could work like 50% of the open-source UNIX programs around which all use autoconf/automake, rather than be in the other 50% which each have their own unique ways.

XCode 2.4.1 worked just fine up through 4.7.alpha5 (and probably the problems I'm having with rc1 are unrelated to XCode/gcc), and 2.5 is the last one available for OS X 10.4.  I think that this needs to be changed to indicate that.

Dave, 

I followed your explanations and created a patch that replaces the current prereq-0.8-install with the
new prereq-0.9-install.
I however did not understand whether I am also supposed to post the updated tar file.

I also cannot figure out how to make the patch respect executable permissions of prereq-0.9-install.

Wow that was a lot more than I was expecting - nice.

Question:

```
if [ $XCODE_VERS_MAJOR -gt 2 ]; then 
        echo "You are using XCode version " $XCODE_VERS 
        echo "WARNING: You are strongly advised to install Apple's latest XCode 3," 
        echo "unless you already have it. You can download this from " 
        echo "http://developer.apple.com/xcode/" 
        echo "Sage will NOT work with XCode 4!" 
```
Are you trying to trip this warning for !XCode 3 as well, just as a warning to anyone who is potentially interested in upgrading, or to someone who doesn't have the latest 3.x?  I assume this is the case, just checking.

Yes, you do. Since it will be quite large, its probably best if you just provide a link to it. 

Then a reviewer should be able to drop the new tar file in place, delete the old tar file and apply the patch. 

> I also cannot figure out how to make the patch respect executable permissions of prereq-0.9-install.

From what I later read, you have sorted that out. 

I suggest you provide a link to the tar file and then mark this for review. I don't have OS X myself, but I can look through the changes.
