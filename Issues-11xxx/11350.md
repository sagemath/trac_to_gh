If I am not mistaken, a fraction field of an integral domain R is finite if and only if R is finite. Hence, we should not have a `NotImplementedError` but the following:

```
            sage: Frac(QQ['a','b','c']).is_finite()
            False
```

Thanks for pinging. I am now trying to find a good replacement for that test.

The problem is: We need an object that has a "list" method (after all, the comments for the test state that `F.list()` would run forever), and we need one that does not know whether it is finite or not.

So, we can not use fraction fields, since they know whether they are finite. And we can't use, e.g., quotient rings of multivariate polynomial rings, since they do not support iteration.

Do you have any idea what one could use instead?

I just noticed that there is a typo in `_list_from_iterator_cached`: It says

```
        try:
            if not self.is_finite():
                raise ValueError('since it is infinite, cannot list %s' % self )
        except AttributeError, NotImplementedError:
            pass
```
but should of course say

```
        try:
            if not self.is_finite():
                raise ValueError('since it is infinite, cannot list %s' % self )
        except (AttributeError, NotImplementedError):
            pass
```

But even if I change this, I have a hard time coming up with an example that illustrates `X.list()` running forever.

I actually don't quite understand the purpose of the current example in `structure/parent.pyx` because (without the patch) one gets:

```
sage: R.<t> = QQ[]
sage: F = FractionField(R)
sage: list(F)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)

/usr/local/src/sage-4.7.1.alpha3/<ipython console> in <module>()

/usr/local/src/sage-4.7.1.alpha3/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/rings/ring.so in sage.rings.ring.Ring.__iter__ (sage/rings/ring.c:1820)()

NotImplementedError: object does not support iteration
sage: F.list()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)

/usr/local/src/sage-4.7.1.alpha3/<ipython console> in <module>()

/usr/local/src/sage-4.7.1.alpha3/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/structure/parent.so in sage.structure.parent.Parent._list_from_iterator_cached (sage/structure/parent.c:7943)()

NotImplementedError:
```

So it seems that even the current test doesn't do what is claimed.

I have added a second patch.

The present test actually tests for the *presence* of a bug (namely an object not knowing whether it is finite, although it should know better). In addition, as Jeroen confirms, the test does not do what the comments promise.

Therefore, I removed the test.

In addition, I fixed the bug mentioned above (the missing brackets aroung `except AttributeError, NotImplementedError:`). I can not give an example of an *iterable* object that does not know whether it is finite. But still, I am able to show that I fixed the bug, because the resulting error message shows that iteration was attempted.

Moreover, I added a note at a more prominent part of the docstring. It says that, even though `X.list()` is often better than `list(X)`, it will often be the case that `for x in X` is better than `for x in X.list()`.

Back to "needs review".

However

```

::

    sage: ...

is correct. The double colon indicates that a code block follows, but it does not appear as a character.

After applying the patch, just do

```
sage: R.<t,p> = QQ[]
sage: R.list?
```
