Hello everybody !

This algorithm implements some methods to compute the vertex separation of a digraph and the pathwidth of a digraph for *small* graphs (less than 32 vertices)

It should be followed by many others dealing with process number an alternative methods to compute the same parameters

Yet another well-documented patch for Sage's library.

I put the files in the graph_decompositions folder, which is also the one used by rank-decompositions in patch #11754

Now needs a review ! `:-)`

Hello Jason !

Well, there is actually not much bit-counting going on. :-)

I have to count bits very often in integers, hence the corresponding function in the code, but most of the code is really graph theoretical. I would have been glad to use bitsets (and I often do these days in Sage patches), but the code was just faster when I stored a small integer for each object, and not just a bit. So I'm using char * instead of bitsets :-)

Thouh I'm a very, very good fan of bitsets in general. I just love this thing :-)

Just a few more comments about the Cython:  "for 1<= i< n" is a backwards-compatible syntax, but I would think that the recommended syntax these days is "for i in range(n)" (see http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/language_basics.html#integer-for-loops)

I see that you import the bitset functions, but I guess you never use them in fast_digraph.pyx.  The popcount function was what I was referring to when I said that it would be useful in the bitset.pxi class.


P.S. I would *love* to have in-line commenting on patches, like on googlecode, github, or bitbucket!

Very nice patch Nathann !

I have some comments / improvements propositions that could be discussed

1) You should first use a mapping function from vertex labels to integer, and do the reverse mapping at the end. This is to solve the following problem:

```
sage: D=digraphs.DeBruijn(2,3)
sage: D.edges()
[('000', '000', '0'), ('000', '001', '1'), ('001', '010', '0'), ('001', '011', '1'), ('010', '100', '0'), ('010', '101', '1'), ('011', '110', '0'), ('011', '111', '1'), ('100', '000', '0'), ('100', '001', '1'), ('101', '010', '0'), ('101', '011', '1'), ('110', '100', '0'), ('110', '101', '1'), ('111', '110', '0'), ('111', '111', '1')]
sage: vs.vertex_separation(D)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

TypeError: an integer is required
sage: 

```
2) The MemoryError message is not displayed.  Your code is:

```
raise MemoryError("Memory allocation failed. Is there enough memory around ?") 
```
and I see

```
sage: D=digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(31,.3)

4) You could rename your function for instance vertex_separation_32, and then add a frontend function called vertex_separation calling vertex_separation_32. The goal is to have a more generic function allowing to add other implementations / methods for the vertex separation...

Hello !!!

* God I hate those translations. At least with the MILP code you don't have to deal with it `:-P`
* Yeah ! It means that ``sage_malloc`` actually checks it for me. Good to know ! I removed my test :-D
* Done !
* Well, that's the job of the next patch, isn't it ? We'll have plenty of time to write this function when we will know what it contains, that'll be soon enough to write its documentation, its tests for all different algorithms, checking automatically that they are consistent, etc... `:-)`

Patch updated !

I followed precisely your instructions: create a new branch from a clean branch (original 4.7.2 distribution), then apply the patch on this new branch, test it, and build the doc, (try to) chack it, and finally return to original branch before erasing temporary branch. Believe me, on my macbook air, it takes quit a long time since it recompiles a lot of stuff each time (don't know why).

I will try as soon as I can on another computer.


By the way, another typo line 223 "reulting" -> "resulting" ;-)

```
223	    reulting in a corresponding path decomposition.
