ONLY TO BE APPLIED IF YOU USE THE FLASK NOTEBOOK WITH THE NEW JMOL .SPKG (#11503). BOTH ARE REQUIRED.

With the change to the Flask notebook jmol is moving to the directory SAGE_LOCAL/share.  This requires  changes to the script that launches Jmol from the command line.  Attached is a [trac_11496_add_jmol_script.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11496/trac_11496_add_jmol_script.patch.gz) that adds the updated file to the hg repository for the local/bin directory.  Don't know why it wasn't tracked in the past.

NOTE: If you get errors upon trying to apply this patch.  Simply replace the jmol script file with the contents of this patch.  There seem to be issues depending upon whether your installation is tracking this file or not.  It should be added to the Hg repository in the next release.

I'm not quite sure how to respond.  As of 4.7 (the last official release) that script was not included in the mercurial repository.  Am I expected to modify my patches to keep up with test releases?  

That said, If you are setting up to use the Flask notebook and the new release of Jmol, you need to have the version in my patch not the one that points to sagenb/data/jmol as that directory no longer exists.

I suggest patching by hand.

I believe this is a good idea.  As soon as I've changed the .spkg (see #11503) this ticket should be closed.
