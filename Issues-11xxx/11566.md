Sage does not contain cryptography based on Quasigroups. It is based on string transformations with Quasigroups.This offers multi-level encryption.Please refer Danilo Gligorosoki's "Multivariate Quadratic Quasigroups based Cryptography,American Conference on Applied Mathematics,Harvard University,2009."

Component: **cryptography**

Keywords: **Quasigroups, Latin squares, block cipher, stream cipher, hash function, pseudo random number generator, embedded systems, embed- ding quasigroups, hierarchies of trusted levels of communication**
