matplotlib is insanely awesome.

Love this.

Did you report the possible bug upstream?  Of course it wasn't even there before to be seen (in the doc).  This does fix the problem.

Interesting that you say it answer the PREP question (which it does) - I would have just told someone to use points(list) rather than line(list).  But this is still good to add to the doc in plot.py, which is all most people will look at.

This looks great - positive review.
