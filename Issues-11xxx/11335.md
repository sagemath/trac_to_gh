This patch adds a class `Vector_symbolic_dense` to `sage.modules`, whose functionality at this stage consists solely of providing a `simplify_full` method.  The need for such functionality came up in the review of #10132 (metric surfaces in 3D), where symbolic vectors with complicated entries show up, and explicitly calling `simplify_full` all the time would be cumbersome (see also #10552).

The modifications implemented by this patch are the following: 
* Adds the class `Vector_symbolic_dense`;
* Adds functionality to the `element_class` function in `sage.modules.free_module` to use this class;
* Changes some doctests in `free_module_element.py` (because `vector([1, 2, pi])` is now a symbolic vector rather than an element of a generic free module).

Eventually, this class could be expanded along the lines of `sage.matrix.matrix_symbolic_dense`.
