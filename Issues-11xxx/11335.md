This patch adds a class `Vector_symbolic_dense` to `sage.modules`, whose functionality at this stage consists solely of providing a `simplify_full` method.  The need for such functionality came up in the review of #10132 (metric surfaces in 3D), where symbolic vectors with complicated entries show up, and explicitly calling `simplify_full` all the time would be cumbersome (see also #10552).

The modifications implemented by this patch are the following: 
* Adds the class `Vector_symbolic_dense`;
* Adds functionality to the `element_class` function in `sage.modules.free_module` to use this class;
* Changes some doctests in `free_module_element.py` (because `vector([1, 2, pi])` is now a symbolic vector rather than an element of a generic free module).

Eventually, this class could be expanded along the lines of `sage.matrix.matrix_symbolic_dense`.

The commit message of the patch should not be one very long line.  Please wrap it into multiple lines but try to make sure that the first line makes sense by itself (this is what `hg log` shows).

Joris, in the future it would be better to have the ticket number in the filename, for two reasons:
1. it improves greppability.
2. it ensures that no two patches from different tickets have the same filename.
