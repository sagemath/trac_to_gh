Currently

```
sage: from sage.misc.misc import deprecated_function_alias
sage: a = deprecated_function_alias(sqrt, "Version ?")
sage: a(5)
...
DeprecationWarning: (Since Version ?) a is deprecated. Please use sqrt instead.
sqrt(5)
```

which is misleading because the user would expect to find `sqrt` in the same module as `a`.

With this patch

```
sage: from sage.misc.misc import deprecated_function_alias
sage: a = deprecated_function_alias(sqrt, "Version ?")
sage: a(5)
...
DeprecationWarning: (Since Version ?) a is deprecated. Please use sage.functions.other.sqrt instead.
sqrt(5)
```

There's no change in deprecating methods.

Looks good.  Passes long tests on 4.7.1.alpha3.  I've cc'ed Florent Hivert in case he wants to add anything.  I've also added an "Apply" section to the description for the release manager.

Two minor formatting items need attention.


Line 2287: `Trac #11585::`

You need a blank line after the double-colon to make the verbatim text format properly.

You can test documentation via  `sage -docbuild reference html` after a fresh build (`sage -b`) and then viewing the resulting HTML file.


Line 2299:

```
if module is None: module_name = '__main__'
else: module_name = module.__name__
```

should be formatted as

```
if module is None:
    module_name = '__main__'
else:
    module_name = module.__name__
```

See http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html

which references:  http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

(look shortly after "Compound statements")

Luca,

Looks good - thanks for the improvement.

I am going to switch this to positive review, but Florent Hivert should feel free to get in on this just in case he sees something.

Ouch! This single line is responsible for it:

```
module = inspect.getmodule(inspect.stack()[1][0])
```

In fact, there's about 40 calls to `deprecated_function_alias` in 4.7.1.rc2; on my laptop:

```
sage: import inspect
sage: timeit('inspect.stack()[1][0]')
25 loops, best of 3: 18.4 ms per loop
```

The fact is, I don't know how to obtain the name of the module where the call to `deprecated_function_alias` happened without inspecting the stack. Any ideas?

I don't have to investigate further now but I think you don't need the full stack but only the top of it. Using 

```
inspect.getframeinfo(sys._getframe(1),1)
```
should be much faster...

<a id='comment:15'>Comment 15:</a>
Here is what I think is a good solution `inspect.currentframe(1)` does the
same as `inspect.stack()[1][0]` only 400 time faster:

```
sage: import inspect
sage: inspect.getmodule(inspect.stack()[1][0]) == inspect.getmodule(inspect.currentframe(1))
True
sage: timeit('inspect.getmodule(inspect.stack()[1][0])')
25 loops, best of 3: 15.6 ms per loop
sage: timeit('inspect.getmodule(inspect.currentframe(1))')
625 loops, best of 3: 40.7 µs per loop
```
I'm updating the patch accordingly.

Unfortunately, the problem is not with the stack:

Before any patch:

```
sage.all: 0.987 (None)
```
After the rc1 patch

```
sage.all: 1.805 (None)
```
After the rc2 patch

```
sage.all: 1.692 (None)
```
It's better but still too much.
