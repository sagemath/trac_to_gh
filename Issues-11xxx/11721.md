If you call `rows()` for a matrix and supply a bad argument, it just goes on its way.

```
sage: A = matrix(QQ, 2, range(4))
sage: A.rows(1)
[(0, 1), (2, 3)]
```

Same for columns.

A request for a Jordan block of negative size just goes on its way.

```
sage: jordan_block(6.2, -8)
[]
```

Also - some general clean-up while I was in the area.
