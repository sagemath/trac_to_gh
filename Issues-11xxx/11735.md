As reported by Jan on sage-devel [1], the current implementation of is_chordal is incorrect. Given a vertex v adjacent to x and y (x and y being non-adjacent), a shortest path between x and y in G-v does not necessarily avoid the neighbors of v. Clearly.
Well, with this patch the shortest path is computed in the graph G with v and all its neighbors removed with the exception of x and y, so that it can not happen again.

Besides, as it is almost free to check that the certificate is indeed a hole, this patch adds a test just in case `:-)`

As this patch is already written (and readily updated to be applied on top of #11738), I think it best to merge it into Sage as soon as possible. It (apparently) fixes the bug reported by Jan, but most importantly ensures that the answer returned is indeed *valid*, so that no erroneous answer could be returned as previously.

Of course, this version of the implementation will have to be patched as soon as possible using Jan's code, in order to match a proven algorithm (or until I can come up with a proof that the current implementation is correct, or find a paper that does if I actually found it somewhere).

I'll do that *asap*, but I still think it better to merge this patch in the meantime, if only to be sure no bad answer is ever returned (God I hate that).

```

sage: L = [(3*i, (3*i+1) % NN) for i in xrange(N)] + [(3*i, (3*i+2)%NN) for i in xrange(N)] + [((3*i+1)%NN, (3*i+2)%NN) for i in xrange(N)]

sage: G.add_edge(0,15)
sage: G.is_chordal()
True
sage: G.add_edge(0,25)
sage: G.is_chordal()

Well, this graph clearly contains a long hole (induced cycle). Sage can find it too, with the "certificate" flag :

```
sage: G.is_chordal(certificate = True)
(False, Subgraph of (): Graph on 50 vertices)
sage: G.is_chordal(certificate = True)[1].show()
```

I mean, a graph is chordal if it contains an induced long cycle, and if you build a cycle of triangles it will of course contain a large induced cycle : the triangles offer no protection against that (just take two vertices that are very far away from each other, and compute a shortest path between them. As any shortest path, this path is induced, and the same way you can obtain an induced cycle).

You're right Nathann. I should not try a patch after a long day of work...

I did new tests this morning and the algorithm works fine.
I have no compilation error.
The doc is OK and includes the test of the patch (I don't if it's usual to let the patch number in the doc, but it has no consequences).

So I'm positive with this patch.

Thank you Nathann.



I hope someone will later be able to improve the running time of the algorithm. Current implementation is quite slow for an O(m) algorithm compared to other (nicely impleted) algorithms with higher complexity 

```
sage: G = graphs.RandomInterval(1000)
sage: G.num_edges()
319501
sage:  %time G.is_chordal()
CPU times: user 24.83 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 24.87 s
Wall time: 24.95 s
True
sage: %time G.diameter()
CPU times: user 1.59 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 1.59 s
Wall time: 1.59 s

```

Yep `:-/`

Thanks for the review, though ! `;-)`
