When a doctest gets the dreaded **Unhandled SIGSEGV...**, the doctest script doesn't know how to handle this if the killed process is the child of `/bin/sh`, not `/bin/sh` itself.  Newer versions of `bash` automatically do `execve()` instead of `fork()` when there is only one command to run, so the problem does not appear then.  The fix is to always `exec` or even better, not using a shell at all.  Consider [attachment:sigdie.py].  Running this on forking shells gives:

```
sage -t  "/home/jdemeyer/sigdie.py"
/home/jdemeyer/sage/sage-4.7.alpha5/local/lib/libcsage.so(print_backtrace+0x31)[0x7f66bf2dd415]
[...]
/lib/libpython2.6.so.1.0(Py_Main+0xb4e)[0x7f66c2aa4e7e]
/lib/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xf4)[0x7f66c1da11c4]
python[0x400619]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Segmentation fault

         [2.8 s]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


        sage -t  "/home/jdemeyer/sigdie.py"
Total time for all tests: 2.9 seconds
```
when it should give:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/testdoctest/sigdie.py"
The doctested process was killed by signal 11
         [6.3 s]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/testdoctest/sigdie.py" # Killed/crashed
Total time for all tests: 6.4 seconds
```

Another sympton is that a doctest TIME OUT kills the wrong process: it kills the shell, not the actual Python command.
