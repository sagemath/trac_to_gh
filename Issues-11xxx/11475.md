I have rewritten the `prime_pi` method from scratch, it is much cleaner and less hacky this time (as I have learned more about coding), however it is still based on the same algorithm as before (no LMO yet, although I intend to take a stab at it later this year). This was developed in parallel with a method to count primes in residue classes (ticket forthcoming).

The overhead for small input `>= 2` is rather large in the current `prime_pi`, this has been dramatically improved:

New:

```
sage: timeit('prime_pi(100)')
625 loops, best of 3: 475 ns per loop
sage: timeit('prime_pi(10000)')
625 loops, best of 3: 483 ns per loop
```
Old:

```
sage: timeit('prime_pi(100)')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.71 µs per loop
sage: timeit('prime_pi(10000)')
625 loops, best of 3: 5.56 µs per loop
```

There is also a ~5x speedup (conservatively) for larger input:

New:

```
sage: timeit('prime_pi(10**8)')
625 loops, best of 3: 530 µs per loop
sage: timeit('prime_pi(10**10)')
5 loops, best of 3: 27.1 ms per loop
sage: time prime_pi(10**12)
37607912018
Time: CPU 1.53 s, Wall: 1.53 s
```
Old:

```
sage: timeit('prime_pi(10**8)')
125 loops, best of 3: 3.66 ms per loop
sage: timeit('prime_pi(10**10)')
5 loops, best of 3: 161 ms per loop
sage: time prime_pi(10**12)
37607912018
Time: CPU 8.65 s, Wall: 8.64 s
```

The user can also give a second argument to use additional memory for a potential speedup. All primes less than the second argument are used in computing pi(x). For example:

```
sage: time prime_pi(10**12, 10**8)
37607912018
Time: CPU 0.92 s, Wall: 0.92 s
sage: time prime_pi(10**12, 10**8)    # pari's prime table is now cached
37607912018
Time: CPU 0.58 s, Wall: 0.58 s
```

An earlier version of this implementation started to fail to give correct output on 64-bit systems somewhere between `9.5*10**15` and `9.75*10**15`, for issues that I had previously been unable to determine, so I had initially limited input to be `< 2**49`, which I am fairly confident is safe, as I have done a fair bit of testing in this range trying to debug this issue (despite it taking hours per call). I would appreciate testing on 32-bit platforms.

A lot of the speed of this algorithm relies on the `__cached_count` method, which is essentially a binary search (with a simple adjustment in the beginning that takes advantage of the density of the primes). This is the fastest type of binary search I know of, but if anyone knows of a way to speed it up, it could have a significant effect.

The other big contributor to the speed is the `__smallPi` table, which stores the values of pi(x) for `x < 2**16`. This is used in the same manner as  `__cached_count`, but is of course much faster.

Finally, I have introduced the `legendres_formula` method, which takes two arguments, `x` and `a`, and returns the number of positive integers not larger than `x` that are not divisible by any -- i.e. co-prime to each -- of the first `a` primes. This function is core to all combinatorial methods for computing the prime counting function, so I figured that I would make this publicly accessible now that I have clean code.

Something like this should give you a 10% speedup for big inputs. 

```
        if p < 200:
            pos = p>>2
            size = 5
        else:
            size = self.__numPrimes>>1
            # Use the expected density of primes for expected inputs to make an
            # educated guess
            if p>>3 < size:
                size = p>>3
            pos = size
```


(beware to make sure there are enough primes cached for small inputs)

Replying to [@nexttime](#comment%3A2):
> The [link(s)](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/papers/abelian_prime_counting/main.pdf) to [your paper](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/senior_thesis/main.pdf) is (currently) dead. (I wouldn't call it 'main' btw. ;-) )

Sorry about that, I was planning on moving the folder, but I forgot to. I'll fix that tonight.

Replying to [@sagetrac-ylchapuy](#comment%3A4):
> Something like this should give you a 10% speedup for big inputs. 

Thanks, I'll try it out tonight, and update the description and patch if it proves fruitful.

Andrew, do you have some examples of wrong prime counts (beyond 2<sup>49</sup>), and if so, on what kind of systems does one experience them?

While the old implementation was said to fail on (at least some) 32-bit systems for large inputs, the new one in contrast fails on 64-bit systems?

(More or less just curious; perhaps I'll *one day*<sup>TM</sup> try to track this down, depending on the affected system(s) as well.)

 This doesn't cost very much memory, since everything is stored as 32-bit ints, but `prime_range` is currently built on top of pari, which poses a number of problems, but the primary concern is that it is a memory hog when sieving to a large upper bound (important for plotting purposes).

Btw, I have a large collection of correct prime counts here, so if eventually the sysloads drop, I'll by myself check some results against your new implementation.

Anyway, anybody feel free to compute more values above our current limit and post them here, whether correct or not. :-)

An update:

v4: added a table of `prime_pi` values that can be stored in a byte -- using this with the `__cached_primes` method gave a giant speedup. Since the sum at the beginning of `__phi` (and `__phi32`) differs from `16*(x/77)` by a small factor that only depends on `x%2310`, so adding a table with these factors results in another large speedup. These tables take a total of ~4kB.

v5: the tables introduced a significant initialization time for `prime_pi`, and William asked me to fix this, so `prime_pi` (and legendres_formula) only initialize these tables on an initial call -- so initialization time is now ~650ns:

```
sage: timeit('sage.functions.prime_pi.PrimePi()')
625 loops, best of 3: 627 ns per loop
```

Both Yann and I have tested `9.75*10^15` again and got the correct result, I also did `10^16`. We both ran it on 64-bit GNU/Linux systems. So the issue I was encountering may have been due to boundary issues with the `__cached_primes` method (which have been rewritten over the course of the patches). I kept the limit in since I haven't yet tested this thoroughly.

I've so far only tested a little (on 64-bit Linux; dead old 32-bit box still building Sage), but already found one wrong result **with patch v3**:

```
  502000000000000  15296923904889   # 11475v3
  502000000000000  15296922045596   # correct result, (at least) double-checked
```

Note that 502*10<sup>12</sup> is *below* 2<sup>49</sup> (562.949.953.421.312).

As my machines are still busy, you could perhaps check if the newer version(s) give the correct result.

Besides a couple of other values on individual machines, I've successfully computed pi(2<sup>k</sup>) for k=0...53 and pi(10<sup>k</sup>) for k=0...16 on each of three different machines (two of them 32-bit; all with patch *version 6*).

Some computations are still in progress, but so far I could also verify the results of `prime_pi(2**54)` and `prime_pi(2**55)` (on at least one machine). I've also played a little with "`legendres_formula()`".

Yes, I also think we can or should drop any "artificial" limit now, though I must admit I haven't really looked at the code yet...

Ah, I see, you already removed the restriction in patch v8 (and also added warnings w.r.t. seemingly "endless" computations, which I also wanted to suggest).

There's a small typo in `__call__()`'s docstring (the `2**32` should read `2**64`):

```
        This implementation uses unsigned 64-bit ints and thus does not
        support `x >= 2**32`::
            
            sage: prime_pi(2^64)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            NotImplementedError: computation of prime_pi for x >= 2^64 is not implemented
```

Also, there's a mixture of both kinds of exponentiation operators (`^` and `**`) throughout the [doc]strings; I'm not sure if we shouldn't use just one notation.

Which machines have you had issues with? Everything I have tested with v8 has worked (this includes x86 and x86_64 linux, 64bit Snow Leopard, and Sparc Solaris 10).

Makes sense to me, if no one has an objection to the idea, I'll make the change.

Sounds good to me.

Oh, I didn't get any wrong results; I just meant I've also tested `prime_pi(x)` with some "random" values (besides the mentioned powers of 2 and ten), but not systematically on all machines (all Linux boxes; Pentium4 Northwood, P4 Prescott and Core2).

 A lot of the speed of this algorithm relies on the `__cached_count` method, which is essentially a binary search (with a simple adjustment in the beginning that takes advantage of the density of the primes). This is the fastest type of binary search I know of, but if anyone knows of a way to speed it up, it could have a significant effect. (Thanks to Yann for his suggestion)

I am posting a patch that should fix the bugs that were present for the past few versions (primarily, calling it with a relatively small `x` in comparison to `a` would give an extremely wrong answer due to overflow issues).

The patch also makes all documentation use `^`, there are no longer any instances of `**`.

The patch also touches up on `__phi` and `__phi32` -- cleaning up code, adding a few comments, and makes a simple optimization to reduce boolean checks for small `x` values (~10% speedup for large input).

I'm hoping this will be the final patch for this ticket, so that I don't go into the double digits for version numbers :-).

The new version comes in the right moment as the slow 32-bit machine just finished computing `prime_pi(2^57)` (successfully; still with v6 though). No separate timings, but pi(2<sup>54</sup>) ... pi(2<sup>57</sup>) took 7.5 days in total. :-)

At first glance, there are only a few typos:

* There's a superfluous `+` in the computation of `self.__tabS[i]` (continuation line).
* The 2<sup>49</sup> remains renitent:

```
    cdef uint64_t __pi(self, uint64_t x) except -1: 
        r""" 
        Returns :math:`\pi(x)` and assumes :math:`self.__maxSieve < x < 2^{49}` 
        """ 
```
* `s/`number of primes`/`number of positive integers`/`:

```
    cdef uint64_t __phi(self, uint64_t x, uint64_t i): 
        r""" 
        Legendre's formula: returns the number of primes :math:`\leq` ``x`` 
        that are not divisible by the first ``i`` primes 
        """

So far passed all [long] tests on Ubuntu 7.10 x86 (Sage 4.7) and Ubuntu 9.04 x86_64 (Sage 4.7.1.alpha3; patch to `module_list.py` applies with 1 line offset).

That's of course a bit funny (I don't mind):

```
sage: legendre_phi(2^63,0)
computation of legendre_phi for large x can take minutes, hours, or days depending on the size of x
computation of legendre_phi for x >= 10^15 has not been thoroughly tested, be cautious of the result
9223372036854775808
sage: 
```
We may also add "*or weeks*", but the current version is faster than the previous ones and **much** faster than the current version in Sage of course (not to mention its odd limitation).

There are opportunities for further improvements (e.g. copying the whole list of primes when we need more; perhaps some more comments / documentation), but these can IMHO be left to follow-up tickets.

In principle positive review from me (minus the typos), just hesitating to give it at this point without having studied the code more thoroughly.

Of course, I wrote the method as a wrapper for __phi, so I was mainly thinking of what I needed to call that method. I can easily remove this bound.

When fixing the above issue, I can fix this. This same issue will appear for very large `x` for `prime_pi`, this can be blamed on PARI -- it stores the primes inefficiently and will use ~17GB for a sieve up to `2**32-1` (my code should use ~1GB at this size). I can implement a custom sieve if it this poses much of an issue (eventually though something needs to be done to fix `prime_range`).

Ouch. (Or should it read 1.7 GB, with ~8 bytes per prime? Otherwise there would be a real hardware limit - max. 2 or 4 GB address space - on 32-bit machines and OSs I haven't yet met during the tests.)

I thought the huge memory consumption was mostly the fault of `prime_range()` (and Python), and to some extent of having up to three or four lists or arrays of primes at the same time (PARI + Python + perhaps two Cython arrays while copying).

Would using Python ints (`py_ints=True` parameter to `prime_range()`) alleviate the situation in any way?

One could also request the primes in chunks rather than the whole interval at once, or implement some generator class or function that calls PARI.

Using `sage_realloc()` would also reduce the (peak) physical memory requirement.

Hmmm. I thought we could avoid using `prime_range()` *later*, on a follow-up, e.g. by directly accessing PARI from Cython. But feel free to implement or use some other sieve / function.

At least potentially freezing the machine (which IMHO is an OS problem) isn't very user-friendly, especially in educational software I think...

That might have been the case with older PARI versions; if I do

```
sage: time pari.init_primes(2^32)
Time: CPU 13.42 s, Wall: 18.47 s
```
the whole process just occupies about 283 MB (89 MB thereof basic Sage). And yes, all have been computed, as one can "verify" with e.g. the time it takes to get some primes around the current "end":

```
sage: prime_range(2^32,2^32+100) # immediate answer if init_primes(2^32) has been called in advance
[4294967311, 4294967357, 4294967371, 4294967377, 4294967387, 4294967389]
```

The fatal things are commands like this:

```
sage: prime_range(2^30)[-1]
```
which turns the relative prime offsets stored by PARI (hardly more than one byte per prime on average) into a list of boxed integers.

How long has sage had `sage_realloc`? I could have sworn that it didn't exist a year ago.

I have am working on v10, which will primarily change the `__sieve` function to directly access PARI and use `sage_realloc`. I have this working on 64-bit linux right now:

```
sage: get_memory_usage()
844.1484375
sage: time legendre_phi(1000,10^8)
1
Time: CPU 22.55 s, Wall: 22.54 s
sage: get_memory_usage()
1406.78515625
```

Obviously I haven't made all the changes that I need to with `legendre_phi`, however it removes the potentially insane memory issues with using `prime_range`. Worst case scenario for storage now:

```
sage: time legendre_phi(1000, 203280221)
1
Time: CPU 46.85 s, Wall: 46.86 s
sage: get_memory_usage()

Been busy, but I finally managed to get another patch (after running into quite a number of issues). This has some pretty significant changes -- specifically to `legendre_phi` and `__sieve`.

`legendre_phi` now has keyboard interrupt support :). Also, it removes the limit to `a` as well as make some other improvements to speed for various special cases.

`__sieve` was rewritten to remove the use of `prime_range` and now works directly through PARI. Also `sage_realloc` was added (I wasn't aware that sage had `realloc`, I could have sworn that I tried using it before with no luck).

<div id="comment:53" align="right">comment:53</div>

I've added a reviewer patch to Andrew's version 10:

* PARI's `diffptr` is `uint8_t*` (actually `unsigned char*` or `byteptr`); using `uint_fast8_t*` there would fail on any machine on which `sizeof(uint8_t) != sizeof(uint_fast8_t)`.
* Use the more portable `ptrdiff_t` for "`__diffptrOff`" (which will then also be smaller on 32-bit machines).
* Change order of libraries in `module_list.py`, as PARI also depends on GMP, to support dumber linkers (necessary for at least Cygwin I guess).
* `stdint.h` is C99, so add the corresponding compiler flag.

The superfluous `+` is still in, missed to fix that in my reviewer patch.

I haven't yet really looked at the rest of the new code (i.e., v10), only performed the standard tests (`-long`) on both Ubuntu 9.04 x86 and x86_64 (Sage 4.7 and Sage 4.7.1.alpha4, respectively), which passed (seemingly slightly faster, but I may be wrong ;-) ).

The `module_list.py` part of Andrew's v10 patch applies to Sage 4.7.1.alpha4, too, but with an offset of -26 lines, so should perhaps be rebased.

(Unfortunately my second 32-bit machine apparently died, on which I mainly tested `prime_pi()` for larger values previously.)

So how the prime list is created and managed was bothering me. Specifically, its initiation code uses a bit of a hack to figure out whether or not it was called by init_tables and also uses `pari(n).primepi()`, which without #11741 can be quite buggy for larger n; it can consume a rather large amount of memory if the user gives a large input; and the user does not have any option on how big it is.

So I've completely rewritten the initiation method, it now recursively calls the pi method to determine the length of the prime list. I've also completely I've removed the caching part of the code, since we can quickly copy the primes over from pari's list, and instead added an optional second argument that allows the user to use additional memory if so desired. I've also tweaked the size of the smallPi list to give another significant speedup (roughly 50% faster than the last patch), as well as made a couple of simplifications in phi32.

Beyond those changes, I've refactored a lot of code, replaced cython code with python for the non-critical sections in order to improve readability, reverted the plot method to something very close to its original state (since we are no longer caching), and folded in Leif's reviewer patch. The code is now 552 lines versus the previous 625.

According to the patchbot logs there are some issues with documentation formatting:

```
docstring of sage.functions.prime_pi.legendre_phi:39: WARNING: Duplicate explicit target name: "rao2011".
docstring of sage.functions.prime_pi.partial_sieve_function:39: WARNING: Duplicate explicit target name: "rao2011".

```

This is basically because there should be only one copy of the bibliography entry in the file, rather than having it afresh in every docstring that cites it.

Also, shouldn't the class PrimePi derive from sage.symbolic.function.BuiltinFunction, rather from the base Object class?

Do either of these cause a segfault?:

```python
sage: prime_pi(2**15)
3512
sage: prime_pi(2**10-1)
172
```
Those are the only two calls made to `prime_pi` made by that doctest.
