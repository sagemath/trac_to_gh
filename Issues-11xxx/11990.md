Look at the following code:

```
sage: m = var('m')
sage: sum(m, m, 0, oo)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Computation failed since Maxima requested additional
constraints; using the 'assume' command before summation *may* help
(example of legal syntax is 'assume(m>0)', see `assume?` for more 
details)
Is  m  positive or zero?
```
But inside the sum, it should be clear what `m` is. Using one of or both of the commands

```
sage: assume(m>=0) 
sage: assume(m, 'integer')
```
does not change the result. Execution of 

```
sage: maxima.sum(m, m, 0, oo)
```
results in the same (except that a `TypeError` is thrown).

A different behaviour brings the following example

```
sage: m = var('m')
sage: sum(2^m, m, 0, oo)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Sum is divergent.
```
Whereas

```
sage: maxima.sum(2^m, m, 0, oo)
inf
```

Upon further reflection, what are we seeking for in the second example (which has absolutely nothing to do with #11987, since it really does diverge, my apologies!)?    I think that Sage just agrees to raise errors for divergent integrals and sums, not infinity, so the behavior is correct from that point of view.

Otherwise this is another example of #3732, unfortunately.

I don't see what the expected behavior here is. Do you want `sum()` to return `infinity` instead of raising a `ValueError` with the message `Sum is divergent.`?

Note that if you state that the variable is positive, the first example also raises an error:

```
sage: n = var('n')
sage: assume(n>0)
sage: sum(n, n, 0, infinity)
...
ValueError: Sum is divergent.

If we know that a sum diverge monotonically to infinity, then the output should say that, i.e. should be `oo`. 

The reason I open the ticket is, that all sums above have the same behavior, but the output is always different, which should not be.

And, I don't see (from a user point of view) any reason, that in 

```
sum(m, m, 0, oo)
``` 
Sage asks "Is  m  positive or zero?" and in 

```
sum(2^m, m, 0, oo)
``` 
not.

Well, `maxima.sum` is not really applicable, because that is a Maxima element.  That's sort of like complaining that mpmath returns `mpf` numbers - you aren't asking for a Sage element.  So it still sort of reverts to the big question.

Right, as I said in [comment:1](#comment%3A1), there are lots of things like this in Maxima (extra interactions).  We can report it upstream, but it may be that the algorithm they use just has to ask this. 

It sounds like you're motivated on this one, and certainly it would be great to get the right error and not the question.

```

(%i6) load(simplify_sum);
(%o6) /Users/.../sage-5.2/local/share/maxima/5.26.0/share/c\
ontrib/solve_rec/simplify_sum.mac
(%i7) simplify_sum(sum(m,m,0,inf));
Is  m  positive, negative, or zero?
(%i3) assume(m>0);
(%o3)                               [m > 0]
(%i4) simplify_sum(sum(m,m,0,inf));

sum: sum is divergent.
#0: simplify_sum(expr='sum(m,m,0,inf))
 -- an error. To debug this try: debugmode(true);
```
You could ask about this on the Maxima list or report it on their tracker!  Incidentally,

```

sage: var('m')
m
sage: assume(m>0)
sage: sum(m,m,0,oo)

ValueError: Sum is divergent.
```
so something must have changed in the meantime.

> > The reason I open the ticket is, that all sums above have the same behavior, but the output is always different, which should not be.

> Well, `maxima.sum` is not really applicable, because that is a Maxima element.  That's sort of like complaining that mpmath returns `mpf` numbers - you aren't asking for a Sage element.  So it still sort of reverts to the big question.

Exactly. The behavior of the `sum()` function in Sage is consistent. `maxima.sum()` is just a wrapper to call Maxima. That is also consistent with Maxima behavior.

The expression `sum(m, m, 0, oo)` is divergent if `m != 0` and `0` if `m=0`. So the best we can do without the assumption Maxima is asking for is to leave it unevaluated.

On the question of shall we raise an error or return `oo`: Leaving aside the problem that it is usually not that easy to decide which type of infinity to return, I would like to get an error as soon as a divergent sum is encountered. If this expression was part of a larger one, and we decide that its divergent after a substitution, there isn't much point in carrying on evaluating the expression.

In Sage there is one exception to this rule, we return different types of infinity from special functions if you hit a pole. For example `gamma(-1) -> Infinity`. This is compatible with MMA, although it contradicts Maple or GiNaC. This allows us to do `(1/gamma(n)).subs(n=-1) -> 0` instead of raising an error. Compared to what goes on when evaluating `sum()`, `gamma()` is a fundamental operation. This convenience to avoid special casing potential poles of `gamma()` is well worth the bug hunting after a complex expression ends up evaluating to `oo`.


Since we already have a ticket about handling interactive prompts from Maxima, I suggest we close this ticket.

Well, I don't know about this.  In some sense, this should be a "dummy variable" in which case the sum is clearly 0+1+2+... but for consistency perhaps this is okay in our case.  Otherwise I do agree with dkrenn that `sum(2^m, m, 0, oo)` should also be asking a question.  But this would be an upstream issue, more or less.
> On the question of shall we raise an error or return `oo`: Leaving aside the problem that it is usually not that easy to decide which type of infinity to return, I would like to get an error as soon as a divergent sum is encountered. If this expression was part of a larger one, and we decide that its divergent after a substitution, there isn't much point in carrying on evaluating the expression.

I guess I would be interested in whether Maxima considers the discrepancy between `sum(2^m, m, 0, oo)` and `sum(m, m, 0, oo)` behavior is a bug.  After all, `m` should really be a dummy variable!  I've actually sent an email and so request to not close this ticket, since this is a (slightly) different issue than the overall issue of Maxima giving interactive prompts.  After all, Maxima's `integrate(m,m,0,inf)` doesn't ask such a question, but says it's divergent.
