There are some serious problems at present with the code for S-class groups.  They only emerge when the class groups isÂ non-cyclic.  For example,

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(-105)
sage: C = K.class_group(); C
Class group of order 8 with structure C2 x C2 x C2 of Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 105
sage: S = (K.ideal(11, a + 7),)
sage: K.S_class_group(S)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
IndexError: Argument length (= 3) must be 2.
```
This problem arises when the class group and the S-class group have differing numbers of generators.  It arises essentially because generators of S-class groups are created as `FractionalIdealClass` elements rather than `SFractionalIdealClass` elements.

But there is a more serious problem.  The Pari data for the S-class group which we failed to construct above can be obtained as

```
sage: SC_data = K._S_class_group_and_units(S)[1]; SC_data
[(Fractional ideal (10, a + 5), 2, 10), (Fractional ideal (6, a + 3), 2, 6)]
```
so that if

```
sage: P, Q = [u[0] for u in SC_data]
```
the S-classes of the ideals `P` and `Q` (each of order 2) generate the S-class group.  However,

```
sage: P._S_ideal_class_log(S)
[0, 0]
```
which cannot be correct.

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
The patch rectifies the defects.  It also incorporates enhancements for both class groups and S-class groups.

In particular:

The computation of S-class groups is made faster when the ideals in S are all principal.

The computation of ideal_class_logs is speeded up by setting a pari flag.

The code for S-class groups is made more compatible with that for class groups.

Looks good to me, and applies fine to 4.7.1.alpha1 and all tests pass.

I've added rlm to the CC list since I think he implemented this originally, and hope he'll take a look too.

As Robert doesn't seem to reply, do you want to give this a positive review, or have someone else review it too?
