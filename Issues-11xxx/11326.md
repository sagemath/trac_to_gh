I've made a new spkg

http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/atlas-3.8.3.p18.spkg

that should respect `$CC`. It passes `--cc=$CC -C xc $CC -C gc $CC -C ic $CC -C dm $CC -C sm $SS -C dk $CC -C sk $CC` to the ATLAS configure script and afterwards fixes up `GOODGCC` in `Make.inc`. Note that ATLAS sets `GOODGCC = gcc $CC` if `$CC` does not start with `gcc`.

I'm currently compiling it, but since `Make.inc` is generated correctly I'm fairly positive that this should work.
