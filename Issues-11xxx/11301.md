Shouldn't we rename `up_list` to something more meaningful ? What about `young_lattice_successors` ?

Ah, this is what `up_list` is about! I had no clue before that
(from the name).

+1 for renaming (with deprecation of `up_list`), either in this
patch or a followup.

For the name, for consistency with other spots (like
`bruhat_upper_covers`), we should use a name like
`young_upper_covers` or `young_lattice_upper_covers`.

You may want to raise a discussion on sage-combinat-devel to choose
between the two.

Cheers,
					Nicolas
