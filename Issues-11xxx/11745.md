<div id="comment:9" align="right">Comment 9</div>

I give a positive review. In fact it is enough to test the single (attached) file, since it does not change any functionality in Sage, it does only add some more doctests.

Nevertheless I did run all doctests (with Sage 5.7) and they all pass.

Paul: as I already said to you by e-mail, be sure to run the test with `--warn-long` and mark any tests taking a long time as `# long time`.

Jeroen, the `--warn-long` option does not seem to work with 5.7 nor 5.8:

```
tarte% ../../../../../sage -t --warn-long recequadiff.py
sage -t --warn-long "devel/sage-11745/sage/tests/french_book/recequadiff.py"


Usage: sage-doctest [same options as sage -t] filenames
         [0.1 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


        sage -t --warn-long "devel/sage-11745/sage/tests/french_book/recequadiff.py"
Total time for all tests: 0.2 seconds
```

Anyway on my machine (which is an Intel Core 2) `numbertheory.py` takes
about 15 seconds, `polynomes.py` about 5 seconds, and `recequadiff.py`
about 13 seconds (without `-long`). Is that reasonable?

since the first files in `tests/french_book` are named `xxx.py`, for coherence it is better to use similar names.
