This file has to be put into `tests/french_book`, probably after changing the name to
`recequadiff.py`. All tests pass with 5.7. I put it as "needs review" so that people can
comment.

I give a positive review. In fact it is enough to test the single (attached) file, since it does not change any functionality in Sage, it does only add some more doctests.

Nevertheless I did run all doctests (with Sage 5.7) and they all pass.

```
