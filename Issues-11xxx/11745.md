use only the attached file `recequadiff_doctest.sage`
This file has to be put into `tests/french_book`, probably after changing the name to
`recequadiff.py`. All tests pass with 5.7. I put it as "needs review" so that people can
comment.

I give a positive review. In fact it is enough to test the single (attached) file, since it does not change any functionality in Sage, it does only add some more doctests.

Nevertheless I did run all doctests (with Sage 5.7) and they all pass.

examples will still run in future versions of Sage.

Jeroen, the `--warn-long` option does not seem to work with 5.7 nor 5.8:

```

Usage: sage-doctest [same options as sage -t] filenames

The following tests failed:

Anyway on my machine (which is an Intel Core 2) `numbertheory.py` takes
about 15 seconds, `polynomes.py` about 5 seconds, and `recequadiff.py`
about 13 seconds (without `-long`). Is that reasonable?
