use only the attached file `recequadiff_doctest.sage`
This file has to be put into `tests/french_book`, probably after changing the name to
`recequadiff.py`. All tests pass with 5.7. I put it as "needs review" so that people can
comment.

<a id='comment:9'>Comment 9:</a>
I give a positive review. In fact it is enough to test the single (attached) file, since it does not change any functionality in Sage, it does only add some more doctests.

Nevertheless I did run all doctests (with Sage 5.7) and they all pass.

Paul: as I already said to you by e-mail, be sure to run the test with `--warn-long` and mark any tests taking a long time as `# long time`.

Jeroen, the `--warn-long` option does not seem to work with 5.7 nor 5.8:

```
tarte% ../../../../../sage -t --warn-long recequadiff.py
sage -t --warn-long "devel/sage-11745/sage/tests/french_book/recequadiff.py"


Usage: sage-doctest [same options as sage -t] filenames
         [0.1 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


        sage -t --warn-long "devel/sage-11745/sage/tests/french_book/recequadiff.py"
Total time for all tests: 0.2 seconds
```

Anyway on my machine (which is an Intel Core 2) `numbertheory.py` takes
about 15 seconds, `polynomes.py` about 5 seconds, and `recequadiff.py`
about 13 seconds (without `-long`). Is that reasonable?

Let me just mention that there is no requirement from me to rename that file. It would have been fine to keep the name `recequadiff_doctest.sage` (maybe that's easier for you?)

since the first files in `tests/french_book` are named `xxx.py`, for coherence it is better to use similar names.

we have a new patch without the executable bit, and with `...` replaced by `....:`,
should be attach it here or in a new ticket?
