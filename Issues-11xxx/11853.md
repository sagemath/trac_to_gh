```
The following consistently fails with sage-4.7.2.alpha2 and also on `www.sagenb.org` (the new flask notebook based on sage-4.7):

0. If running locally, start with `sage -n`

1. Create new worksheet, call it `GFhelp`

2. In the worksheet, evaluate the following and wait for Sage to finish:

```
GF?
```

3. Close the worksheet

4. Reopen the worksheet `GFhelp`

5. Re-execute `GF?` by simply typing `SHIFT-ENTER`.

Now the worksheet totally hangs.

I can reproduce this with on a current flack notebook an Sage 4.7.1, and current flack notebook+twisted 11 on Sage 4.7
(our NTU nutmeg server).

I assume by "execute the following and wait for completion" you mean evaluate, not Tab-complete.
(In the latter case nothing wrong happens).
