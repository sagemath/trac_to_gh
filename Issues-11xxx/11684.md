```
If we have a polynomial over a finite field and we want to obtain its coefficients, then there seems to be a lot of conversion overhead.  It is a lot slower than multiplying such polynomials:

```
sage: K.<a> = GF(5^3)
sage: P = PolynomialRing(K, 'x')
sage: f = P.random_element(100)
sage: timeit('f.list()')
5 loops, best of 3: 115 ms per loop
sage: timeit('f * f')
625 loops, best of 3: 794 Âµs per loop
```

If, on the other hand, we do not use NTL, then we can obtain the coefficient list without any delays, though in that case multiplication is a lot slower:

```
sage: P = PolynomialRing(K, 'x', implementation='not NTL')
sage: f = P(f)
sage: timeit('f.list()')
625 loops, best of 3: 968 ns per loop
sage: timeit('f * f')
25 loops, best of 3: 12.3 ms per loop
```
This performance issue occurs in both 4.7 and 4.7.1.rc1.

**Attachment:** [trac_11684_coefficient_speedup.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11684/trac_11684_coefficient_speedup.patch)

The uploaded patch improves the speed slightly:

```
sage: K.<a> = GF(5^3)
sage: P = PolynomialRing(K, 'x')
sage: f = P.random_element(100)
sage: timeit('f.list()')
125 loops, best of 3: 2.92 ms per loop
```
A real fix would of course be an NTL wrapper for finite fields, which is a huge project that may not get finished soon.

The code of `list()` currently does `[self[i] for i in range(celement_len(&self.x, _parent))]`. You improved the `__getitem__` method.

But still, calling the `__getitem__` method over and over again seems to create a lot of overhead. I am sure that NTL provides a method that returns the list of coefficients. So, why not use that instead?

And if that is impossible, note that most lines of `__getitem__` are concerned with preparatory steps, namely:

```
        cdef ZZ_pE_c c_pE
        cdef cparent _parent

        _parent = get_cparent(self._parent)
        _parent[0].restore()
        c_pE = ZZ_pEX_coeff(self.x, i)

        K = self._parent.base_ring()
```

I am pretty sure that it is possible to do these preparatory steps only *once*. Hence, I suggest to be a bit more "explicit" in the `list()` method, rather than calling `self[i]`.

Of course, in addition to that, one should also keep your improvement of `__getitem__`.

At least the tests in devel/sage/doc pass. Hence, I have already posted my patch. Here are the timings:

```
sage: K.<a> = GF(5^3)
sage: P = PolynomialRing(K, 'x')
sage: f = P.random_element(100)
```

#11685 only:

```
sage: timeit('f.list()')
5 loops, best of 3: 79.9 ms per loop
```

#11685 with your patch:

```
sage: timeit('f.list()')
125 loops, best of 3: 2.36 ms per loop
```

All patches:

```
sage: timeit('f.list()')
125 loops, best of 3: 2.03 ms per loop
```

OK, that's only a gain of 14%. But I had one run where it took 2.42 ms with one patch and 1.98 ms with both patches (that's why I stated 20% in my previous post).

Anyway, does the second patch make sense? I am currently running doc tests, so that probably I can review both #11685 and your patch from here.

I already stated that your patch improves the `__getitem__` method considerably, and I can confirm the resulting speedup in `list()`.

The long doctests of both devel/sage-main/doc and devel/sage-main/sage pass. Hence, I give your patch a positive review.

Of course I can not review my own patch. So, I'd appreciate if you could have a look on it.
