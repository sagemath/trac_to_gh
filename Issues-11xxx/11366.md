See [this documentation](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/sets/set.html#sage.sets.set.Set_object.difference), where the definition for set difference and set intersection is the same. 

The actual doctests are correct, I think, it's just some sloppy copying or something in the definition.  See [enumerated sets](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/sets/set.html#sage.sets.set.Set_object_enumerated.difference) for what seems to be correct.
