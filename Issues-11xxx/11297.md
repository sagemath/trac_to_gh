ECL 11.1.1.p0 spkg does not build on MacOSX PPC (G4) running MacOSX 10.5, and using XCode 3.1.4 (the lastest XCode for this platform).
Symptoms: a crash half-way the build, at the log point

```
;;; About to load cmp/load.lsp 
;;; 
;;; Now we are in shape to do something useful. 
;;; End of bare.lsp
``` 
it can be:

``` 
Internal or unrecoverable error in: 
not a lisp data object 
  [2: No such file or directory] 
```
or

``` 
Detected access to an invalid or protected memory address. 
Available restarts: 
1. (CONTINUE) Ignore signal
``` 
or

``` 
64 is an illegal index to "Variable in COMMON-LISP package: 
The last-but-one top-level forme". 
No restarts available. 
```
or perhaps something else like this. This is apparently due to an ECL bug having to do with altivec instructions.
Configuring with 

```
./configure CFLAGS="-mno-altivec -mabi=no-altivec"
```
makes the ECL build OK. See
https://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/55313fb49133b97/8cbd9ac8826ef685#8cbd9ac8826ef685

for more info on this.

The new spkg is at http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/ecl-11.1.1.p1.spkg

tested OK on MacOSX 10.5 PPC (and on few non-PPC systems just to make sure it's OK).
Needs testing on more MacOSX PPC systems.

**Resolution:** fixed

Looks reasonable. I am not I can cut yet another ecl spkg today. Actually work is peaking up so if someone else wants to pick that up it'd be great.

As I noted in the thread this may need to be followed by the addition of the same CFLAGS when you build sage/libs/ecl.pyx. This can be done with platform specific instructions.

I can review if I cannot cut it.
