ECL 11.1.1.p0 spkg does not build on MacOSX PPC (G4) running MacOSX 10.5, and using XCode 3.1.4 (the lastest XCode for this platform).
Symptoms: a crash half-way the build, at the log point

```
;;; About to load cmp/load.lsp 
;;; 
;;; Now we are in shape to do something useful. 
;;; End of bare.lsp
``` 
it can be:

``` 
Internal or unrecoverable error in: 
not a lisp data object 
  [2: No such file or directory] 
```
or

``` 
Detected access to an invalid or protected memory address. 
Available restarts: 
1. (CONTINUE) Ignore signal
``` 
or

``` 
64 is an illegal index to "Variable in COMMON-LISP package: 
The last-but-one top-level forme". 
No restarts available. 
```
or perhaps something else like this. This is apparently due to an ECL bug having to do with altivec instructions.
Configuring with 

```
./configure CFLAGS="-mno-altivec -mabi=no-altivec"
```
makes the ECL build OK. See
https://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/55313fb49133b97/8cbd9ac8826ef685#8cbd9ac8826ef685

for more info on this.

The new spkg is at http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/ecl-11.1.1.p1.spkg

tested OK on MacOSX 10.5 PPC (and on few non-PPC systems just to make sure it's OK).
Needs testing on more MacOSX PPC systems.

Upstream: **Reported upstream. Little or no feedback.**

Looks reasonable. I am not I can cut yet another ecl spkg today. Actually work is peaking up so if someone else wants to pick that up it'd be great.

As I noted in the thread this may need to be followed by the addition of the same CFLAGS when you build sage/libs/ecl.pyx. This can be done with platform specific instructions.

I can review if I cannot cut it.

Replying to [@kiwifb](#comment%3A8):
 
> There will be a small (but not blocking) matter that I have noticed in your build log. If confirmed it will go in another ticket for 4.7.1. Can you confirm whether or not you are using the sage installed boehm_gc or the ecl internal copy with your new spkg? Like I said in the log you posted the internal copy was used. It is not impossible that fixing the flags also solved that but we should check more widely what happens on computers where bohem_gc is not installed as part of the system.

it might be you saw a log on a stand-alone compilation attempt (which would certainly use the built0in gc). I certainly did not tweak the flags in the spkg that deal with this, so whatever setting is currently in Sage remains.
