We have

sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_givaro import FiniteField_givaro
sage: F9 = FiniteField_givaro(9)
sage: F81 = FiniteField_givaro(81)
sage: F81(F9.gen())
Traceback (most recent call last):

```
so one should implement this. Incidentally I did that, patch follows.

Here comes the patch ;) Conversion is possible in both directions (up and down), see example below.

```
sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_givaro import FiniteField_givaro
sage: F4 = FiniteField_givaro(4,'b')
sage: F16 = FiniteField_givaro(16,'c')
sage: z = F4.gen() + F16.gen(); z
c^2
sage: z.parent()
Finite Field in c of size 2^4
sage: F4(z)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: c^2 is not a sub-field element            
sage: F4(z+F16.gen())
b
```

After this patch:

```
sage: R = ReedSolomonCode(15,3,GF(16,'a'))
sage: R.minimum_distance()                
13
```
Perhaps someone more knowledgeable about conway polynomials and the finite field givaro code can properly review it.

I have just minor comments to make. It will be nice to have statements like

```
raise TypeError, "unable to convert from a finite field with different characteristic"
```
instead written as

```
raise TypeError("unable to convert from a finite field with different characteristic")
```
This will increase the compatibility with python3 (when Sage moves to python3 in the future).

I want to advocate the viewpoint that this feature should only be enabled when a compatible system of finite fields is expressly requested, either using the `conway=True` syntax from #8335 or in the future using an algebraic closure (see #14990).

The fact that elements from `F81` that are actually in `F9` cannot yet be coerced down into `F9` is not addressed by #8335, though.  I guess this ticket is the place to solve that problem.

It is probably better to put this in `FiniteField_base.pyx`, since the feature is in principle implementation-independent.

One thing to think about: in the current patch, the down-conversion involves taking roots in the finite field.  This might be the best way for finite fields that are implemented using Givaro, because it represents elements as powers of a generator of the multiplicative group.  For general finite fields, it could be more efficient to write down the inclusion map as an **F**<sub>*p*</sub>-linear map and to find the unique solution of the corresponding linear system.
