We have

```            
sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_givaro import FiniteField_givaro
sage: F9 = FiniteField_givaro(9)
sage: F81 = FiniteField_givaro(81)
sage: F81(F9.gen())
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError
```
so one should implement this. Incidentally I did that, patch follows.

Here comes the patch ;) Conversion is possible in both directions (up and down), see example below.

```
sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_givaro import FiniteField_givaro
sage: F4 = FiniteField_givaro(4,'b')
sage: F16 = FiniteField_givaro(16,'c')
sage: z = F4.gen() + F16.gen(); z
c^2
sage: z.parent()
Finite Field in c of size 2^4
sage: F4(z)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: c^2 is not a sub-field element            
sage: F4(z+F16.gen())
b
```

After this patch:

```
sage: R = ReedSolomonCode(15,3,GF(16,'a'))
sage: R.minimum_distance()                
13
```
Perhaps someone more knowledgeable about conway polynomials and the finite field givaro code can properly review it.

I have just minor comments to make. It will be nice to have statements like

```
raise TypeError, "unable to convert from a finite field with different characteristic"
```
instead written as

```
raise TypeError("unable to convert from a finite field with different characteristic")
```
This will increase the compatibility with python3 (when Sage moves to python3 in the future).

Some of the stuff here might be more efficient for Givaro than what is provided in #8335, and you also give the opportunity to go down, i.e. from a field to a subfield which is not the case in #8335.

Nonetheless, I think both of these should be handled after #8335 gets merged.
First a general ticket to allow going down, and another one to provide optimized implementations for Givaro finite fields.

Attachment: **[trac_11938-5.11.beta1.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11938/trac_11938-5.11.beta1.patch.gz)**

Rebased the patch on top of #8335, some fixes.
When #8335 gets in, this should as well.

In the meantime, #8335 changed a lot and this patch does not apply anymore.  On the other hand, after #8335, one can now do

```
sage: F9=GF(9,conway=True,prefix='z')      
sage: F81=GF(81,conway=True,prefix='z')    
sage: F81(F9.gen())                    
2*z4^3 + 2*z4^2 + 1
```
I want to advocate the viewpoint that this feature should only be enabled when a compatible system of finite fields is expressly requested, either using the `conway=True` syntax from #8335 or in the future using an algebraic closure (see #14990).

The fact that elements from `F81` that are actually in `F9` cannot yet be coerced down into `F9` is not addressed by #8335, though.  I guess this ticket is the place to solve that problem.

It is probably better to put this in `FiniteField_base.pyx`, since the feature is in principle implementation-independent.

One thing to think about: in the current patch, the down-conversion involves taking roots in the finite field.  This might be the best way for finite fields that are implemented using Givaro, because it represents elements as powers of a generator of the multiplicative group.  For general finite fields, it could be more efficient to write down the inclusion map as an **F**<sub>*p*</sub>-linear map and to find the unique solution of the corresponding linear system.

I just finished reviewing (and slightly extending) #13214.  It seems to me that the problem of mapping finite field elements into subfields is now solved in a more systematic way by #13214.

This is due to the following fact: if you have a coercion map *K* -> *L* and a section of this map, and if *b* is in *L*, typing `K(b)` will try to apply the section to *b*.  Indeed, extending the example in [comment:19](#comment%3A19), one can now type

```
sage: F9=GF(9, conway=True, prefix='z')      
sage: F81=GF(81, conway=True, prefix='z')    
sage: F81(F9.gen())                    
2*z4^3 + 2*z4^2 + 1
sage: F9(F81.gen()^10)
z2
```
Am I correct that #13214 (if positively reviewed) supersedes this ticket?
