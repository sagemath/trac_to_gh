Apparently the same problem from #7335 is back.

The fix should be the same, apparently.

New spkg: [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/tachyon-0.98.9.p4.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/tachyon-0.98.9.p4.spkg)

(Now superseded by the [also] positively reviewed p5 from #11706, which is based on the p4 here, but among other things removes the garbage files contained in the p4, created by MacOS X's Finder.)

Karl-Dieter (or anybody else), are you sure that

```sh

```
works on Cygwin, too?

Shouldn't there be an `.exe` extension on Cygwin / Windows?

Mike confirmed (currently without being able to verify / test that) that it should be `tachyon`**`.exe`** on Cygwin, so I changed the code to:

```sh
    ...
    if [ "$UNAME" = CYGWIN ]; then
        binary_name=tachyon.exe
    else
        binary_name=tachyon
    fi
    # The '*' is a place-holder for the arch just built (e.g. 'win32' for
    # Cygwin, other directories won't exist):
    cp -p -f src/compile/*/"${binary_name}" "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin"
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Error installing Tachyon Ray Tracer binary (\"${binary_name}\")."
        exit 1
    fi
    ...
```

Note that this change is only in the p5 spkg for #11706 (based on the p4 here) I'll upload in a few minutes...

It would be nice if someone could now test the new p5 from #11706 (which is up now) on Cygwin as well, then I can give *this ticket* a positive review. :)

Thank you for catching those stupid `DS*` files; it's almost impossible to get Mac not to put them in sometimes.\n\nWhat is particularly weird is that the package installs fine, so spkg-install must have been usable, at least!  Maybe the permissions were \"good enough\"...\n\nAs to the .exe, that doesn't seem to have been present before, so maybe Cygwin was able to use it after all?  (Or maybe it just never worked and no one noticed!)\n\nSince the current goal is to get Sage to build, then start, I hadn't even been able to check whether Tachyon worked.  I did once run doctests on a functioning Sage on Cygwin, but I don't think it had a problem with Tachyon stuff.  I'll try that when looking at #11706.",

Wow, this is really frustrating.  I really thought I had gotten all the cruft out of these.  Thank you for catching those stupid `DS*` files; it's almost impossible to get Mac not to put them in sometimes.

What is particularly weird is that the package installs fine, so spkg-install must have been usable, at least!  Maybe the permissions were "good enough"...

As to the .exe, that doesn't seem to have been present before, so maybe Cygwin was able to use it after all?  (Or maybe it just never worked and no one noticed!)

Since the current goal is to get Sage to build, then start, I hadn't even been able to check whether Tachyon worked.  I did once run doctests on a functioning Sage on Cygwin, but I don't think it had a problem with Tachyon stuff.  I'll try that when looking at #11706.

You can install it with the `-s` option (`./sage -f -s ...`) and afterwards look into the subdirectory `src/compile/win32/` of the Tachyon build directory (the latter given in the message *"You can safely delete ..."*).

And now I still don't know what weird magic Cygwin apparently applies (either the shell or `cp`) that *both* spkgs seem to install the `.exe` file.

Do you have a single `tachyon.exe` in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/` or do you have both, one with and another without the extension?

Just for you, I restarted my virtual machine, waited a long time, and then reinstalled (`-f -s`) the p4 spkg, which does not have the exe.  The directory in question has libtachyon, libtachyon.a, and tachyon.exe.  

*And* I tried copying that tachyon.exe file by using `cp path/to/tachyon path/to/home/` and it worked.

It's possible that Cygwin/Windows treats exe's as folders, like Mac and .app's...

Hope that satisfies your curiosity!

Just the one with exe.

I don't see the point in making a new spkg when several other issues that needed addressing are taken care of in #11706.    If that ticket languishes I will do this, though.
