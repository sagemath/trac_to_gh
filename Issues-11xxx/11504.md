Apparently the same problem from #7335 is back.

The fix should be the same, apparently.

New spkg: [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/tachyon-0.98.9.p4.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/tachyon-0.98.9.p4.spkg)

(Now superseded by the [also] positively reviewed p5 from #11706, which is based on the p4 here, but among other things removes the garbage files contained in the p4, created by MacOS X's Finder.)

Karl-Dieter (or anybody else), are you sure that

works on Cygwin, too?

Shouldn't there be an `.exe` extension on Cygwin / Windows?

<div id="comment:13" align="right">Comment 13</div>

Mike confirmed (currently without being able to verify / test that) that it should be `tachyon`**`.exe`** on Cygwin, so I changed the code to:

```sh
    ...
    if [ "$UNAME" = CYGWIN ]; then
        binary_name=tachyon.exe
    else
        binary_name=tachyon
    fi
    # The '*' is a place-holder for the arch just built (e.g. 'win32' for
    # Cygwin, other directories won't exist):
    cp -p -f src/compile/*/"${binary_name}" "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin"
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Error installing Tachyon Ray Tracer binary (\"${binary_name}\")."
        exit 1
    fi
    ...
```

Note that this change is only in the p5 spkg for #11706 (based on the p4 here) I'll upload in a few minutes...

It would be nice if someone could now test the new p5 from #11706 (which is up now) on Cygwin as well, then I can give *this ticket* a positive review. :)

The spkg was said to *build*, not Tachyon to work... ;-)

(The installation of the executable might have actually failed without anybody noticing that, because the exit code of `cp` wasn't checked and, worse, an unconditional `exit 0` followed. The p5 spkg should still be checked on Cygwin w.r.t. this.)

And now I still don't know what weird magic Cygwin apparently applies (either the shell or `cp`) that *both* spkgs seem to install the `.exe` file.

Do you have a single `tachyon.exe` in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/` or do you have both, one with and another without the extension?

Just for you, I restarted my virtual machine, waited a long time, and then reinstalled (`-f -s`) the p4 spkg, which does not have the exe.  The directory in question has libtachyon, libtachyon.a, and tachyon.exe.  

*And* I tried copying that tachyon.exe file by using `cp path/to/tachyon path/to/home/` and it worked.

It's possible that Cygwin/Windows treats exe's as folders, like Mac and .app's...

Hope that satisfies your curiosity!

Just the one with exe.

I don't see the point in making a new spkg when several other issues that needed addressing are taken care of in #11706.    If that ticket languishes I will do this, though.
