Apparently the same problem from #7335 is back.

The fix should be the same, apparently.

New spkg: [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/tachyon-0.98.9.p4.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/tachyon-0.98.9.p4.spkg)

(Now superseded by the [also] positively reviewed p5 from #11706, which is based on the p4 here, but among other things removes the garbage files contained in the p4, created by MacOS X's Finder.)

Karl-Dieter (or anybody else), are you sure that

```sh

works on Cygwin, too?

Shouldn't there be an `.exe` extension on Cygwin / Windows?

Mike confirmed (currently without being able to verify / test that) that it should be `tachyon`**`.exe`** on Cygwin, so I changed the code to:

```sh
    ...
    if [ "$UNAME" = CYGWIN ]; then
        binary_name=tachyon.exe
    else
        binary_name=tachyon
    fi
    # The '*' is a place-holder for the arch just built (e.g. 'win32' for
    # Cygwin, other directories won't exist):
    cp -p -f src/compile/*/"${binary_name}" "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin"
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Error installing Tachyon Ray Tracer binary (\"${binary_name}\")."
        exit 1
    fi
    ...
```

Note that this change is only in the p5 spkg for #11706 (based on the p4 here) I'll upload in a few minutes...

The spkg was said to *build*, not Tachyon to work... ;-)

(The installation of the executable might have actually failed without anybody noticing that, because the exit code of `cp` wasn't checked and, worse, an unconditional `exit 0` followed. The p5 spkg should still be checked on Cygwin w.r.t. this.)

My guess is that Cygwin "knows" that it's supposed to be .exe as an ending and behaves accordingly?   In any case, the picture is proof, as well as the result of `ls local/bin/tachyo[tab]`.

I'll try installing the spkg at #11706 and make sure that still works.  Shouldn't take long to deal with, I hope.

And now I still don't know what weird magic Cygwin apparently applies (either the shell or `cp`) that *both* spkgs seem to install the `.exe` file.

Do you have a single `tachyon.exe` in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/` or do you have both, one with and another without the extension?

Just for you, I restarted my virtual machine, waited a long time, and then reinstalled (`-f -s`) the p4 spkg, which does not have the exe.  The directory in question has libtachyon, libtachyon.a, and tachyon.exe.  

*And* I tried copying that tachyon.exe file by using `cp path/to/tachyon path/to/home/` and it worked.

It's possible that Cygwin/Windows treats exe's as folders, like Mac and .app's...

Hope that satisfies your curiosity!

Just the one with exe.

I don't see the point in making a new spkg when several other issues that needed addressing are taken care of in #11706.    If that ticket languishes I will do this, though.

Now it does have, so I consider this a minor issue which doesn't have to be fixed here, too.

Therefore setting this ticket back to positive review, as I made #11706 formally depend on this one.
