We currently use a lambda construction in the plot documentation for showing how to get around `x^(1/3)` giving complex numbers for negative input.  

Mike Jackson of Grove City College had a better idea, which his faculty use with Mathematica.

```
plot(sign(x)*abs(x)^(1/3),-1,1)
```

Let's put this in the documentation!
