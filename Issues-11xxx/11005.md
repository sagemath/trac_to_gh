[See #15608 for a list of open simon_two_descent tickets]

Denis Simon has new versions of his scripts (see [http://www.math.unicaen.fr/~simon/](http://www.math.unicaen.fr/~simon/)), these should be updated (see `src/ext/pari/simon`).

<div id="comment:32" align="right">comment:32</div>

This branch updates Denis Simon's GP scripts to versions 06/04/2011 (`ell.gp`) resp. 13/01/2014 (`ellQ.gp`, `ellcommon.gp` [new], `qfsolve.gp`, `resultant3.gp`).  The scripts themselves were copied unchanged from Simon's website (`http://www.math.unicaen.fr/~simon/`).

Summary of the other changes:
- change `Qfsolve` and `Qfparam` to `qfsolve` and `qfparam`
- remove one doctest in `gp_simon.py` that is also in `ell_rational_field.py`
- remove `# random output` in `ell_number_field.py`; if necessary we can add `set_random_seed(0)` before that, but I got the same output every time
- doctest fixes due to changed test output
- minor documentation fixes

Of course the real work in this ticket was done (indirectly) by Denis Simon, and I just made the necessary fixes to the Sage library, but it seems to me that the "Author" field is normally used for ticket authors rather than authors of any "upstream" code; do correct me if I'm wrong.

Jeroen has opened #15809 for the `gp2c` conversion; hopefully John and Martin's hard work can somehow be transplanted there!

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment:39):
> Why the dependency on #15483?

Because #15483 is the obvious fix for the problem from [comment:36](#comment:36).
> Now both these tickets depend on eachother. I would prefer to fix #11005 first (using `# 32-bit`/`# 64-bit`) and then do #15483 on top of this.

I thought Git was supposed to make things like this easy.  I knew that I made the two tickets depend on each other, of course, and agree that circular dependencies are *in abstracto* not very nice.  However, in this case, what looks like a circular dependency is just a way of saying that the tickets should be merged together; the structure of the Git branches is still linear and easy to understand.  Moreover, Git will automatically give the same result independently of the ordering in which the two branches are merged.  I don't feel like spending any time on making each of the two tickets pass doctests separately.

I also realise you don't like the patch at #15483, so I will make a bit more propaganda for it.
