From the patch:

```
If the number fields ``x.parent()`` and ``self`` have an 
embedding in the same field, then those embeddings are used to 
determine the correct conversion.  If no such compatible 
embeddings are given, then some possible conversion of ``x`` 
into ``self`` is given.  This means a non-canonical element of 
``self`` with the same minimal polynomial as ``x``.
```
Is that second bit absolutely necessary? I think this is horrible. Throwing an error would be much preferable. With this, it would be possible to have two fields K and L, elements a,b in K and have
`L(a+b)` not equal to `L(a)+L(b)`. That looks like something that is going to be a perpetual source of problems and hard-to-find bugs.

In the case of my example above, there is a preferred embedding of L into K, but your patch does not find it.

In general, even if there really is no preferred embedding of L into K, then just choosing one will still lead to trouble, as you'll get non-commuting diagrams of embeddings. Instead of just choosing an embedding, I strongly think you must raise an error (but other people may say warning, as David did on sage-nt). This could be discussed on the mailing list.

My patch does not find it because Sage does not *store* it, see #11876.

So may I paraphrase your proposal as follows:
If the element *x* to be converted is not in `QQ` and the fields have no compatible embeddings, then `raise ValueError`?
