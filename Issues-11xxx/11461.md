<div id="comment:0"></div>

The `@parallel` decorator currently cannot be used with methods that implicitly prepend their arguments with a class instance, because `@parallel` requires that the first argument be a list (or iterable) of arguments to pass to the function.

More details can be found at this [asksage question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/585/can-i-use-parallel-for-classinstance-methods).

I wish I could tell buildbot not to apply [attachment: parallel.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11461/parallel.patch.gz) -- I put it here only to share what I've learned about how `@parallel` works:  The object that gets passed to `Parallel` is no longer a method, but only a plain function.  Here's how I'm testing this:  

First, the following goes in a separate file

```
@parallel
def func(n):
    sleep(.2)
    return prime_pi(n)

class PTest(SageObject):
    attr = 'red'
    def meth0(self,n):
        return n
    @parallel
    def meth1(self,n):
        "long and complicated class method"
        sleep(.5)
        return [prime_pi(n),self.attr]

N = PTest()
M = [1000,2000,3000,4000,5000]
L = [(N,x) for x in [1000,2000,3000,4000,5000]]
```

Then I apply the patch and do this:

```
sage: N.meth1(100)
args: (<class '__main__.PTest'>, 100)
branch 2.5.1
...
NotImplementedError: this branch not finished

sage: func(100)
args: (100,)
branch 2.5.1
...
NotImplementedError: this branch not finished
```

So the function and method are being treated the same by `Parallel`.  None of the ideas for detecting the difference: `.__self__`, `ismethod`, or `isfunction` seem to work.  So I guess this means something earlier in the application of `@parallel` needs to be fixed.

Formatting things:
* This needs very minor rebasing with respect to #11467.   
* It should also have at least one example in the ParallelFunction class definition (there should be a docstring) so that something shows up in the reference manual.
* The end of the ``__call__`` docstring seems to have the triple quote misindented.
* `except AtrributeError:` this isn't really a formatting error, but just an error.  There should be a doctest for this?
* `anqd` is not a word

It looks good, though.  I don't feel quite comfortable enough with the parallel stuff to review it completely, but if the doctests work then this makes sense, and the getdoc etc. certainly is right.

I'm cc:ing Niles in because he originally asked about this, so hopefully he can positively review the rest.
