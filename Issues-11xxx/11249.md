Currently the following can happen in the notebook.

```
Here is what happens.  Somehow it first is given a temp name like .Rplot001.png-0TJi, which shows up as a link, and then you click on the link and nothing useful happens.  But then I go to 

cd .sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/home/admin/106/cells/38/ 

(or whatever cell you are in) and I see

ls
Rplot001.png

and that is a normal plot.  So somehow the temp name is funky when displayed.
```

This should be fixed so that the link is to a real file.  Somehow there is something added to the filename.  

This is related to, but not the same as #8868, which is about making R graphics always work; this is about making them work *better* when they already work.

Ah, I finally tracked it down.  In sagenb/notebook/cell.py:

```
    def files_html(self, out):
        """
        Returns HTML to display the files in this compute cell's
        directory.

        INPUT:

          ..., use the format ``'cell://bar cell://foo ...'``

        OUTPUT:

Well, but it's not far away...

```

And I think I know where that extra thing comes from.  R must create a brief temp file, which is found by the notebook cell in files_html() in sagenb/notebook/cell.py:

```

            else:
                link_text = str(F)
                if len(link_text) > 40:
                    link_text = link_text[:10] + '...' + link_text[-20:]
                files.append('<a target="_new" href="%s" class="file_link">%s</a>'%(url, link_text))
```

And this only happens every other time I re-evaluate the cell... Aha!  So that means the old file is being moved to a temporary site, and that is being caught.  But it quickly is eaten up before I can catch it. Wanna bet?  But I haven't been able to catch it, not even with
