Currently the following can happen in the notebook.

```
Here is what happens.  Somehow it first is given a temp name like .Rplot001.png-0TJi, which shows up as a link, and then you click on the link and nothing useful happens.  But then I go to 

cd .sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/home/admin/106/cells/38/ 

(or whatever cell you are in) and I see

ls
Rplot001.png

and that is a normal plot.  So somehow the temp name is funky when displayed.
```

This should be fixed so that the link is to a real file.  Somehow there is something added to the filename.  

This is related to, but not the same as #8868, which is about making R graphics always work; this is about making them work *better* when they already work.
