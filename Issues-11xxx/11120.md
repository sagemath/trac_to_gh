Depends on #10594, which already incorporates the patch to the Mercurial spkg (trac_11120-re-fix-trac_4434.mercurial-spkg.patch) attached here.

---
In Mercurial versions earlier than 1.0, a script called `hgmerge` was installed to the system when you installed mercurial. This script called whatever 3-way merge programs you had installed in order to manually intervene in Mercurial's merging process when it couldn't figure out how to resolve a conflict.

This was deprecated in version 1.0, and now Mercurial calls 3-way merge programs directly instead of relying on an `hgmerge` script. In order to make this work properly, one should set the proper configuration variables to help Mercurial find any installed 3-way merge programs.

There is a file, `contrib/mergetools.rc`, in the Mercurial source distribution which provides exactly these configuration variables, though the upstream installer script does not actually install it anywhere.

The problem reported at trac #4434 was caused, I guess, by the fact that `hgmerge` was deprecated and we sage people didn't notice, so the patch there simply caused our distribution of Mercurial to continue using `hgmerge`. The patch also did this only on the OS X platform, though as far as I can tell the same fundamental problem actually appears on Linux as well (see comments below).

A better way to fix the problem on trac #4434, and fix it for Linux too, would be to use the `contrib/mergetools.rc` file as it was designed to be used.

hmm, how does one check that removing hgmerge does not break things?
reading #4434 says it's about a 3-way graphical thing, of which I am clueless...

As we talked about in person, I guess the way to test it would be to try using `sage -hg` to merge files which cannot be automatically merged. I created [this minimal example of such a repository and such a file](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/keshav/temp/hgmerge-test/), which you then pulled and tried out, using `sage -hg` with `$SAGE_ROOT/bin/hgmerge` removed. This worked just as well as it works on my Linux machine:

```

0 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 1 files unresolved

```

Note that this is not really an *error* - it's just the lack of a default merge program being installed. Could it be possible that the problem that occasioned #4474 is present on Linux as well?

There is actually a sort of "merge tool autodect script" (actually just some configuration entries making mercurial smarter about where to find a range of common merging tools) which is provided but not installed by the upstream distribution of Mercurial, and which lies in the file `src/contrib/mergetools.rc` within the spkg's root directory. Putting this in `$SAGE_LOCAL/etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/` should cause merge program problems to go away. I'll write a patch...

Yes, you're right, it depends on #11121 (specifically on the patch there which applies to the mercurial spkg). Sorry, I'll make that more prominent in the ticket description. As for the error actually copying the file, it's actually because the filename is wrong. It still needs to be called `mergetools.rc` (or at least something`.rc`) in order to work, but in the vanilla Mercurial source distribution it is actually called `contrib/mergetools.hgrc` for some reason. It needs to be renamed during the copy over. I think I had renamed it in my sandbox by mistake at some point when trying to fiddle with it to test different diff viewers - stupid oversight on my part. I'll fix it. Sorry for the inconvenience.

would be good to state clearly in the ticket description  which patches should be applied, and which should not be applied.
I.e, is trac_11120-re-fix-trac_4434.mercurial-spkg.patch needed?
