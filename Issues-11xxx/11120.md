Depends on #10594, which already incorporates the patch to the Mercurial spkg (trac_11120-re-fix-trac_4434.mercurial-spkg.patch) attached here.

---
In Mercurial versions earlier than 1.0, a script called `hgmerge` was installed to the system when you installed mercurial. This script called whatever 3-way merge programs you had installed in order to manually intervene in Mercurial's merging process when it couldn't figure out how to resolve a conflict.

This was deprecated in version 1.0, and now Mercurial calls 3-way merge programs directly instead of relying on an `hgmerge` script. In order to make this work properly, one should set the proper configuration variables to help Mercurial find any installed 3-way merge programs.

There is a file, `contrib/mergetools.rc`, in the Mercurial source distribution which provides exactly these configuration variables, though the upstream installer script does not actually install it anywhere.

The problem reported at trac #4434 was caused, I guess, by the fact that `hgmerge` was deprecated and we sage people didn't notice, so the patch there simply caused our distribution of Mercurial to continue using `hgmerge`. The patch also did this only on the OS X platform, though as far as I can tell the same fundamental problem actually appears on Linux as well (see comments below).

A better way to fix the problem on trac #4434, and fix it for Linux too, would be to use the `contrib/mergetools.rc` file as it was designed to be used.

There is actually a sort of "merge tool autodect script" (actually just some configuration entries making mercurial smarter about where to find a range of common merging tools) which is provided but not installed by the upstream distribution of Mercurial, and which lies in the file `src/contrib/mergetools.rc` within the spkg's root directory.
