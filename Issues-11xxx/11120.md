Depends on #10594, which already incorporates the patch to the Mercurial spkg (trac_11120-re-fix-trac_4434.mercurial-spkg.patch) attached here.

In Mercurial versions earlier than 1.0, a script called `hgmerge` was installed to the system when you installed mercurial. This script called whatever 3-way merge programs you had installed in order to manually intervene in Mercurial's merging process when it couldn't figure out how to resolve a conflict.

This was deprecated in version 1.0, and now Mercurial calls 3-way merge programs directly instead of relying on an `hgmerge` script. In order to make this work properly, one should set the proper configuration variables to help Mercurial find any installed 3-way merge programs.

There is a file, `contrib/mergetools.rc`, in the Mercurial source distribution which provides exactly these configuration variables, though the upstream installer script does not actually install it anywhere.

The problem reported at trac #4434 was caused, I guess, by the fact that `hgmerge` was deprecated and we sage people didn't notice, so the patch there simply caused our distribution of Mercurial to continue using `hgmerge`. The patch also did this only on the OS X platform, though as far as I can tell the same fundamental problem actually appears on Linux as well (see comments below).

A better way to fix the problem on trac #4434, and fix it for Linux too, would be to use the `contrib/mergetools.rc` file as it was designed to be used.

As we talked about in person, I guess the way to test it would be to try using `sage -hg` to merge files which cannot be automatically merged. I created [this minimal example of such a repository and such a file](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/keshav/temp/hgmerge-test/), which you then pulled and tried out, using `sage -hg` with `$SAGE_ROOT/bin/hgmerge` removed. This worked just as well as it works on my Linux machine:

```
keshav@esterhazy ~/temp/hgmerge-test $ sage -hg log --style=compact

  One

keshav@esterhazy ~/temp/hgmerge-test $ sage -hg merge
merging somefile
warning: conflicts during merge.
merging somefile failed!
0 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 1 files unresolved
use 'hg resolve' to retry unresolved file merges or 'hg update -C' to abandon
keshav@esterhazy ~/temp/hgmerge-test $ 
```

Note that this is not really an *error* - it's just the lack of a default merge program being installed. Could it be possible that the problem that occasioned #4474 is present on Linux as well?

There is actually a sort of "merge tool autodect script" (actually just some configuration entries making mercurial smarter about where to find a range of common merging tools) which is provided but not installed by the upstream distribution of Mercurial, and which lies in the file `src/contrib/mergetools.rc` within the spkg's root directory. Putting this in `$SAGE_LOCAL/etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/` should cause merge program problems to go away. I'll write a patch...

 In Mercurial versions earlier than 1.0, a script called `hgmerge` was installed to the system when you installed mercurial. This script called whatever 3-way merge programs you had installed in order to manually intervene in Mercurial's merging process when it couldn't figure out how to resolve a conflict.

`hgmerge` remaining in SAGE_LOCAL/bin is not a problem; `mergetools.rc` overrides it. I guess the best way to test this is to try to replicate #4434 with the new spkg installed - it should be impossible.

By the way, I guess I should also eradicate `sage -hgmerge` - I'll submit a patch (not to the Mercurial spkg but to Sage) in a bit.
