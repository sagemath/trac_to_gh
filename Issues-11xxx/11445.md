```
The following happens

```
sage: var("x")
x
sage: integrate(abs(x - 1) + abs(x + 1) - 2*abs(x), (x,-Infinity,Infinity))
0
sage: integrate(abs(x - 1) + abs(x + 1) - 2*abs(x),(x,-Infinity,10))
2
```
The second answer is the correct one, of course...

This also happens in Maxima.

```

Maxima 5.24.0 http://maxima.sourceforge.net
using Lisp SBCL 1.0.24
Distributed under the GNU Public License. See the file COPYING.
Dedicated to the memory of William Schelter.
The function bug_report() provides bug reporting information.
(%i1) integrate(abs(x - 1) + abs(x + 1) - 2*abs(x),x,minf,10);
(%o1)                                  2
(%i2) integrate(abs(x - 1) + abs(x + 1) - 2*abs(x),x,minf,inf);
(%o2)                                  0
```
I don't know that I would call this "very simple", though, as integrating absolute value things is somewhat tricky when done symbolically.

I honestly went through the same thought process. At first, I thought, "I'll put it with the Maxima stuff because it was a Maxima bug." But then I thought, what if we ever drop Maxima completely?

It's also where you're sent if you look up the code with `integrate?` or `integrate??`, so to stay true to the report on the ticket, I put it there.

If the reporter had done,

```
f = abs(x - 1) + abs(x + 1) - 2*abs(x)
f.integral(...)
```

I probably would have stuck it in symbolics. It's no big deal to move it, in any case.
