```
The following happens

```
sage: var("x")
x
sage: integrate(abs(x - 1) + abs(x + 1) - 2*abs(x), (x,-Infinity,Infinity))
0
sage: integrate(abs(x - 1) + abs(x + 1) - 2*abs(x),(x,-Infinity,10))
2
```
The second answer is the correct one, of course...

This also happens in Maxima.

```

Maxima 5.24.0 http://maxima.sourceforge.net
using Lisp SBCL 1.0.24
Distributed under the GNU Public License. See the file COPYING.
Dedicated to the memory of William Schelter.
The function bug_report() provides bug reporting information.
(%i1) integrate(abs(x - 1) + abs(x + 1) - 2*abs(x),x,minf,10);
(%o1)                                  2
(%i2) integrate(abs(x - 1) + abs(x + 1) - 2*abs(x),x,minf,inf);
(%o2)                                  0
```
I don't know that I would call this "very simple", though, as integrating absolute value things is somewhat tricky when done symbolically.

Or what do you think?  The problem is that we have no canonical location for integral stuff.  `integrate?` is a wasteland, though it points to better sources of doc.

I honestly went through the same thought process. At first, I thought, "I'll put it with the Maxima stuff because it was a Maxima bug." But then I thought, what if we ever drop Maxima completely? This isn't a *Maxima* test: this tests that our integration works. Whatever we would replace Maxima with should also pass this test!

Then, I had to decide whether to put it in functional.py or under symbolics. I settled on this because it's what gets called first when the user calls `integrate()`. It's also where you're sent if you look up the code with `integrate?` or `integrate??`, so to stay true to the report on the ticket, I put it there.

If the reporter had done,

```
f = abs(x - 1) + abs(x + 1) - 2*abs(x)
f.integral(...)
```

I probably would have stuck it in symbolics. It's no big deal to move it, in any case.
