```
The problem is the following code in `sage.libs.singular.ring.singular_ring_new`:

```python
    elif PY_TYPE_CHECK(base_ring, FiniteField_generic):
        if base_ring.characteristic() <= 2147483629:
            characteristic = -base_ring.characteristic() # note the negative characteristic
        else:
            raise TypeError, "characteristic must be <= 2147483629."
        # TODO: This is lazy, it should only call Singular stuff not MPolynomial stuff
        k = MPolynomialRing_libsingular(base_ring.prime_subfield(), 1, base_ring.variable_name(), 'lex')
        minpoly = base_ring.polynomial()(k.gen())
        is_extension = True

    elif PY_TYPE_CHECK(base_ring, NumberField) and base_ring.is_absolute():
        characteristic = 1
        k = MPolynomialRing_libsingular(RationalField(), 1, base_ring.variable_name(), 'lex')
        minpoly = base_ring.polynomial()(k.gen())
        is_extension = True
```

Hence, a multivariate libsingular polynomial ring is constructed without using the (cached) polynomial ring constructor. The comment should rather not be "This is lazy,..." but "This is dangerous, it should only call polynomial ring constructor stuff, not MPolynomial stuff".

I am trying to find an example in unpatched Sage where this is actually a problem. However, while working at #10667, the non-unique parents led to several hundred doctest errors in elliptic curves.

Depends on #11339

I did not run tests yet, and I am not able to provide a doc test that shows that the bug is fixed. But it turns out that the patch that I just attached solves the problem I met while working at #10667, and thus I change it into "needs review".

The problem was as follows. Let `K.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)`.

* During initialisation of `K['x','y','z']`, by one of the patches in my patch chain, there is also an initialisation of a coercion from the base ring.
* The construction of the coercion results in a call to `_singular_ring_new`. It constructs a non-unique libsingular version of `QQ[K.variable_name()]`. 
* The construction of `QQ[K.variable_name()]` also involves the registration of a coerce map from `QQ` to `QQ[K.variable_name()]`.
* Now, one constructs `K['x','y']`. Again, `_singular_ring_new` is called. Again, it creates a *__new__* version of `QQ[K.variable_name()]`, and again it tries to register the coercion. But the coercion is already contained in the global coercion cache. Error.

The `TypeError` would not be raised by `PolynomialRing`. 

I was thinking about future developments. Imaging that someone plays with the polynomial ring constructor, such that a completely different class of polynomial rings would be returned. In that case, the attempt to assign the ring to the cdef variable k of type `MPolynomialRing_libsingular` would result in a `TypeError`.

I fixed another bug caused by a rogue creation of a polynomial ring: It was in the numerator() method of libsingular polynomials.

The patch, that I updated a few seconds ago, contains a new doctest:

```
        sage: P.<foo,bar> = ZZ[]
        sage: Q.<foo,bar> = QQ[]
        sage: f = Q.random_element()
        sage: f.numerator().parent() is P
        True
```
The last answer was `False` in unpatched sage.

Yes, on second thought, it seems reasonable to not catch the type error.
