The problem is the following code in `sage.libs.singular.ring.singular_ring_new`:

```python
    elif PY_TYPE_CHECK(base_ring, FiniteField_generic):
        if base_ring.characteristic() <= 2147483629:
            characteristic = -base_ring.characteristic() # note the negative characteristic
        else:
            raise TypeError, "characteristic must be <= 2147483629."
        # TODO: This is lazy, it should only call Singular stuff not MPolynomial stuff
        k = MPolynomialRing_libsingular(base_ring.prime_subfield(), 1, base_ring.variable_name(), 'lex')
        minpoly = base_ring.polynomial()(k.gen())
        is_extension = True

    elif PY_TYPE_CHECK(base_ring, NumberField) and base_ring.is_absolute():
        characteristic = 1
        k = MPolynomialRing_libsingular(RationalField(), 1, base_ring.variable_name(), 'lex')
        minpoly = base_ring.polynomial()(k.gen())
        is_extension = True
```

Hence, a multivariate libsingular polynomial ring is constructed without using the (cached) polynomial ring constructor. The comment should rather not be "This is lazy,..." but "This is dangerous, it should only call polynomial ring constructor stuff, not MPolynomial stuff".

I am trying to find an example in unpatched Sage where this is actually a problem. However, while working at #10667, the non-unique parents led to several hundred doctest errors in elliptic curves.

The `TypeError` would not be raised by `PolynomialRing`. 

I was thinking about future developments. Imaging that someone plays with the polynomial ring constructor, such that a completely different class of polynomial rings would be returned. In that case, the attempt to assign the ring to the cdef variable k of type `MPolynomialRing_libsingular` would result in a `TypeError`.

I fixed another bug caused by a rogue creation of a polynomial ring: It was in the numerator() method of libsingular polynomials.

The patch, that I updated a few seconds ago, contains a new doctest:

```
        sage: P.<foo,bar> = ZZ[]
        sage: Q.<foo,bar> = QQ[]
        sage: f = Q.random_element()
        sage: f.numerator().parent() is P
        True
```
The last answer was `False` in unpatched sage.

Sorry, I saw your answer only now.

Yes, on second thought, it seems reasonable to not catch the type error.

I am sorry that our messages crossed (I have updated my patch, it now contains a second fix and one doctest). I will remove catching the type error in a minute.
