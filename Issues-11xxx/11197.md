Following on some concerns brought up about dependencies in building spkg docs, as implemented in #10823, here is a ticket for reimplementing #10823 so that docs are built after the full Sage build.  In this way, spkg docs are built when the normal Sage docs are built, and we don't have any worries about having python or sphinx or other dependencies installed.

From Dan's message to sage-devel:

> How about, in addition to spkg-install and spkg-check, we have spkg-install-docs? We would move the logic that checks the SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS variable to the build/install script, which would run the script if the env var is set. This would also allow the build process to determine if a spkg has documentation that can be built, using something roughly like tar jtf foo.spkg | grep spkg-install-docs


> As a data point, doing that for all spkgs in 4.7.alpha4 (except the Sage library, which we handle separately) takes about 70 seconds on a mildly-loaded sagenb.kaist.ac.kr, which is an 8-core Xeon machine.

Here's a patch for the Sage root repo (the file spkg/install).  This should perhaps be considered a first draft, because there are a few issues/questions.

- Right now, it records a log for the docbuilding in spkg/logs/numpy-1.5.1.p0-docs.log, for example, instead of just appending to the already existing spkg/logs/numpy-1.5.1.p0.log.  It's easy enough to switch it around.  Opinions?

- Right now, it stores a placeholder file in spkg/installed if the docs seem to have been built correctly.  (Since after building each spkg, we delete the directory where it was built (spkg/build/numpy-...), we can't just rely on 'make' recognizing that it's already been installed, I think.)  Is this the right way to do it?

A few things which I think belong on other tickets or which I don't know how to solve:

- With the approach here, running "sage -i ..." or "sage -f ..." won't install the docs.  Should we add something to the sage-spkg script which tries to build the docs if SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS is "yes", but fails gracefully if it can't?

Are you talking about the docs directory containing the documentation?  That directory is part of the upstream source, so shouldn't be in the spkg repository.  However, as of a week or two ago, that docs directory has been merged into the main Cython source tree, so future versions of the spkg will not have that docs directory.

I mean that if I unpack cython-0.14.1.p2.spkg, cd into the directory and type "hg status", I see

```
? SPKG.txt.orig
? doc/.hgignore
? doc/Makefile
? doc/README
? doc/TODO
? doc/_static/cython-logo-light.png
? doc/_static/cythonlogo.png
? doc/_static/favicon.ico
? doc/_templates/layout.html
? doc/conf.py
? doc/examples/tutorial/fib1/fib.pyx
? doc/examples/tutorial/fib1/setup.py
? doc/examples/tutorial/great_circle/c1.pyx
? doc/examples/tutorial/great_circle/c2.pyx
? doc/examples/tutorial/great_circle/p1.py
? doc/examples/tutorial/primes/primes.py
? doc/examples/tutorial/primes/primes.pyx
? doc/examples/tutorial/primes/setup.py
? doc/index.rst
? doc/sphinxext/cython_highlighting.py
? doc/sphinxext/ipython_console_highlighting.py
? doc/todo.txt
? doc/welcome.rst
```
So I guess those need to be added to .hginore, or the whole doc directory needs to added, or if everything in there has since been moved to src, we only need to get rid of SPKG.txt.orig.

Replying to [ticket:11197 jason]:
> Following on some concerns brought up about dependencies in building spkg docs, as implemented in #10823


What are these "concerns"? Can these "concerns" be fixed in a simpler way than adding more complexities to the Sage build procedure?

I think the situation is:
- we want to be able to install documentation for any of the various packages that provide it, but
- building the documentation may have different prerequisites (e.g., Sphinx) than building the package itself.
It sounds like the plan in this ticket was to build documentation for the packages at the same time as building the regular Sage documentation.
