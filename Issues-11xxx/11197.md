Following on some concerns brought up about dependencies in building spkg docs, as implemented in #10823, here is a ticket for reimplementing #10823 so that docs are built after the full Sage build.  In this way, spkg docs are built when the normal Sage docs are built, and we don't have any worries about having python or sphinx or other dependencies installed.

From Dan's message to sage-devel:

> How about, in addition to spkg-install and spkg-check, we have spkg-install-docs? We would move the logic that checks the SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS variable to the build/install script, which would run the script if the env var is set. This would also allow the build process to determine if a spkg has documentation that can be built, using something roughly like tar jtf foo.spkg | grep spkg-install-docs

> As a data point, doing that for all spkgs in 4.7.alpha4 (except the Sage library, which we handle separately) takes about 70 seconds on a mildly-loaded sagenb.kaist.ac.kr, which is an 8-core Xeon machine.

<div id="comment:6" align="right">comment:6</div>

Here's a patch for the Sage root repo (the file spkg/install).  This should perhaps be considered a first draft, because there are a few issues/questions.

- Right now, it records a log for the docbuilding in spkg/logs/numpy-1.5.1.p0-docs.log, for example, instead of just appending to the already existing spkg/logs/numpy-1.5.1.p0.log.  It's easy enough to switch it around.  Opinions?

- Right now, it stores a placeholder file in spkg/installed if the docs seem to have been built correctly.  (Since after building each spkg, we delete the directory where it was built (spkg/build/numpy-...), we can't just rely on 'make' recognizing that it's already been installed, I think.)  Is this the right way to do it?

A few things which I think belong on other tickets or which I don't know how to solve:

- With the approach here, running "sage -i ..." or "sage -f ..." won't install the docs.  Should we add something to the sage-spkg script which tries to build the docs if SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS is "yes", but fails gracefully if it can't?  Or only build the docs in sage-spkg if we can tell that the Sage library has already been installed, or some other criterion like this?  This may end up with some code duplication, or separating out the doc-building stuff into a separate script (and then gets us entangled in the base repo vs. scripts repo debate...).

- I noticed that the most recent cython spkg (the one in 4.7.alpha4) has files for building the docs, at least some of which weren't added to the Mercurial repository.  I haven't checked the other spkgs for this sort of issue, but someone should...

Are you talking about the docs directory containing the documentation?  That directory is part of the upstream source, so shouldn't be in the spkg repository.  However, as of a week or two ago, that docs directory has been merged into the main Cython source tree, so future versions of the spkg will not have that docs directory.

I mean that if I unpack cython-0.14.1.p2.spkg, cd into the directory and type "hg status", I see

```
? SPKG.txt.orig
? doc/.hgignore
? doc/Makefile
? doc/README
? doc/TODO
? doc/_static/cython-logo-light.png
? doc/_static/cythonlogo.png
? doc/_static/favicon.ico

? doc/index.rst
? doc/sphinxext/cython_highlighting.py
? doc/sphinxext/ipython_console_highlighting.py

```
So I guess those need to be added to .hginore, or the whole doc directory needs to added, or if everything in there has since been moved to src, we only need to get rid of SPKG.txt.orig.

Hmmm, one problem I see is that a couple of spkgs would need a (re)`configure` before e.g. `make install-docs` etc. would work.

Also, many packages provide [alternate] documentation in various formats (man pages, texinfo files, HTML, dvi / PDF etc.), some of which require tools (i.e., prerequisites either provided by the system or Sage), and some even some small build process just to prepare the sources for other tools. So it isn't always clear *what* would be installed [in addition]. Re-unpacking and re-configuring an spkg just to install docs is IMHO also a bit odd, just like keeping the build directories until eventually some tools are available after the normal build has finished.

The easiest way would be to simply include some *pre-built* versions of documentation requiring external tools, and just copy / install them if `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes` or an spkg's `spkg-install-docs` is run. This could at least in some cases increase an spkg's size significantly though.

We could also support some kind of `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=no` (and `=later`) in `spkg-install`, but that still doesn't tell *which kind of* documentation.

(I personally would for example always install man pages by default, if available.)


No matter if we build / install any documents for some spkg (or whether they are available at all in the spkg itself), we could create HTML pages with links to upstream [documentation] if appropriate.

Same could be done for licenses.

Right now, I'm more in favor of adding a target to the Makefile, rather than the environment variable approach.

I don't think the size increase would be acceptable.

Sure, that sounds like a good idea.  Probably for another ticket, once we get this framework set up.  At least, setting up these html pages would seem to require another set of ideas and therefore add another level of complications.

What are these "concerns"? Can these "concerns" be fixed in a simpler way than adding more complexities to the Sage build procedure?

I think the situation is:
- we want to be able to install documentation for any of the various packages that provide it, but
- building the documentation may have different prerequisites (e.g., Sphinx) than building the package itself.
It sounds like the plan in this ticket was to build documentation for the packages at the same time as building the regular Sage documentation.
