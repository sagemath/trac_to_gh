The function `min` and `max` are Python builtins. The name of the corresponding symbolic functions are `min_symbolic` and `max_symbolic` that were implemented in #6949:

```
sage: f(x) = min_symbolic(cos(x), sin(x))
sage: f
x |--> min(cos(x), sin(x))
```

It would be nice to have examples involving them in the function `sage.plot.plot.plot`. Those can be

```
sage: f(x) = min_symbolic(cos(x), sin(x))
sage: f
x |--> min(cos(x), sin(x))
sage: plot(f, (x,-2*pi,2*pi))
```
or/and

```
sage: f1(p) = 2*p + 1
sage: f2(p) = -p + 3
sage: f3(p) = 4*p - 1
sage: f4(p) = 3/2*p
sage: P = plot([f1,f2,f3,f4], (p,0,2), linestyle='--')
sage: P += plot(max_symbolic(f1(p), f2(p), f3(p), f4(p)), (p,0,2), color='red')
sage: P += plot(min_symbolic(f1(p), f2(p), f3(p), f4(p)), (p,0,2), color='green')
sage: P.show()
```

But be careful that the following currently does not work

```
sage: symbolic_min(f1, f2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: ...

Can we just write a very lightweight wrapper around the python min() function which behaves symbolically if given symbolic input, but otherwise is just like the python function?  Similar to how we have a lightweight wrapper around the sum function?

That would also solve this, though I would still insist on having at least one nice example of this in the plot docs. 

I just didn't know if that was possible; maybe sum was a special case.    I guess if it's hard, we should do this first, then open a different ticket for that (which then corrects the plot doc, naturally).  If it's easy, then go ahead and wrap!

Here's another example of what can go wrong, though it's not related to plotting.

```
@interact
def _(M = matrix(RR,[[1,-1],[-1,1]]),auto_update=False):
    f1(p) = (M[1,0] - M[0,0])*p+M[0,0]
    f2(p) = (M[1,1] - M[0,1])*p+M[0,1]
#    sol1 = find_maximum_on_interval(lambda y: min_symbolic(f1(y),f2(y)),0,1)[0]
```
This is commented out because it does the wrong thing.  The minimum it finds is the comparison of f1 and f2 as Python objects or whatever.

Hi there,

I rewrote a bit the description (please check that you agree). Involving the matrix in the example was quite confusing. I might use it for an introduction to Sage development on june 25th 2014.

There is a fundamental difference between the min_sybolic()  and max_symbolic() from the built-in python functions min() and max() function.The Python built-in max() and min() functions don’t work as expected when symbolic expressions are given as arguments. This function delays evaluation until all symbolic arguments are substituted with values.However,when the built-in functions are used to plot the minimum and maximum of functions in a domain, the first parameter inside the min() or max() function gets plotted irrespective of the actual values.Let's consider the following example:


```
f1(x)=sin(x)
f2(x)=cos(x)
f3(x)=x
p=plot([f1,f2,f3],(x,0,2*pi),linestyle='--')
p+=plot(min(f1(x),f2(x),f3(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='red') # f1(x) is plotted through out the domain even though its not                min at every point in the x-axis.
p+=plot(max(f2(x),f1(x),f3(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='green')#f2(x) is plotted through out the domain even though its not                max at every point in the x-axis.
p.show()
```

Considering some polynomial functions:

```
f1(x)=x*x + 4*x + 2
f2(x)=x^2
f3(x)=x
p=plot([f1,f2,f3],(x,0,2*pi),linestyle='--')
p+=plot(min(f3(x),f1(x),f2(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='red') #always the first parameter in the min function gets plotted. 
p+=plot(max(f2(x),f3(x),f2(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='green')#always the first parameter in the max function gets plotted.
p.show()
```

However, min_symbolic() and max_symbolic() are able to deal with variables as well as can be plotted with more than 2 parameters (functions) efficiently. Below are the examples of the same functions that were plotted by built-in min() and max() earlier.


```
f1(x)=sin(x)
f2(x)=cos(x)
f3(x)=x
p=plot([f1,f2,f3],(x,0,2*pi),linestyle='--')
p+=plot(min_symbolic(f1(x),f2(x),f3(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='red') # f1(x) is plotted through out the domain even though its not                min at every point in the x-axis.
p+=plot(max_symbolic(f2(x),f1(x),f3(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='green')#f2(x) is plotted through out the domain even though its not                max at every point in the x-axis.
p.show()
```


```
f1(x)=x*x + 4*x + 2
f2(x)=x^2
f3(x)=x
p=plot([f1,f2,f3],(x,0,2*pi),linestyle='--')
p+=plot(min_symbolic(f3(x),f1(x),f2(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='red') #always the first parameter in the min function gets plotted. 
p+=plot(max_symbolic(f2(x),f3(x),f1(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='green')#always the first parameter in the max function gets plotted.
p.show()
```

- please note there are minor typos with punctuation in the first paragraph (missing white spaces as in "function.The" instead of "function. The"), 

- in the comment `f1(x) is plotted through out the domain even though its not min at every point in the x-axis` it should be `throughout` i think. moreover, what do you think about: `f1(x) is displayed, although it is not the local minimum for every x`, and similarly for the other comments. also i find those comments a bit too long for display, maybe you can transform these into proper sentences before each command, for example:

```
In this example, `f1(x)` is displayed, although it is not the local minimum for every `x`::

ok it is behaving as expected, as discussed [sort:date/sage-devel/4DUsgt670MA/Woa60kKcpXsJ in this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-devel/vdelecroix) and possibly in other places. also related #17700

Hi Asutosh,

i've pushed a new branch (*) with one sphinx example (see the `plot.py` example). could you see if you like the updates + add the missing `.. PLOT::` blocks for the `min_max.py`? 

one lesson: it was tricky to use with sphinx, because it only accepts a subset of the commands that you would normally use in sage. to see examples of this, just have a look at the code examples in `plot.py`. for instance, it is not possible to assign to function calls, but there are other subtle things.

(*) i first tried to git pull the current branch, merge + compile but i miserably failed, three times. that's why your previous commits are not in the branch i pushed. you can try yourself if you want (`make doc-clean && make`) in your current branch; i gave up and started afresh. 

pd: if you need help to work with git other than what is explained in the user's guide let us know!
