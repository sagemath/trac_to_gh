The function `min` and `max` are Python builtins. The name of the corresponding symbolic functions are `min_symbolic` and `max_symbolic` that were implemented in #6949:

```
sage: f(x) = min_symbolic(cos(x), sin(x))
sage: f
x |--> min(cos(x), sin(x))
```

It would be nice to have examples involving them in the function `sage.plot.plot.plot`. Those can be

```
sage: f(x) = min_symbolic(cos(x), sin(x))
sage: f
x |--> min(cos(x), sin(x))
sage: plot(f, (x,-2*pi,2*pi))
```
or/and

```
sage: f1(p) = 2*p + 1
sage: f2(p) = -p + 3
sage: f3(p) = 4*p - 1
sage: f4(p) = 3/2*p
sage: P = plot([f1,f2,f3,f4], (p,0,2), linestyle='--')
sage: P += plot(max_symbolic(f1(p), f2(p), f3(p), f4(p)), (p,0,2), color='red')
sage: P += plot(min_symbolic(f1(p), f2(p), f3(p), f4(p)), (p,0,2), color='green')
sage: P.show()
```

But be careful that the following currently does not work

```
sage: symbolic_min(f1, f2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: ...
```

Can we just write a very lightweight wrapper around the python min() function which behaves symbolically if given symbolic input, but otherwise is just like the python function?  Similar to how we have a lightweight wrapper around the sum function?

Here's another example of what can go wrong, though it's not related to plotting.

```
@interact
def _(M = matrix(RR,[[1,-1],[-1,1]]),auto_update=False):
    f1(p) = (M[1,0] - M[0,0])*p+M[0,0]
    f2(p) = (M[1,1] - M[0,1])*p+M[0,1]
#    sol1 = find_maximum_on_interval(lambda y: min_symbolic(f1(y),f2(y)),0,1)[0]
```
This is commented out because it does the wrong thing.  The minimum it finds is the comparison of f1 and f2 as Python objects or whatever.

Hi there,

I rewrote a bit the description (please check that you agree). Involving the matrix in the example was quite confusing. I might use it for an introduction to Sage development on june 25th 2014.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:7'>Comment 7:</a>\nThere is a fundamental difference between the min_sybolic()  and max_symbolic() from the built-in python functions min() and max() function.The Python built-in max() and min() functions don\u2019t work as expected when symbolic expressions are given as arguments. This function delays evaluation until all symbolic arguments are substituted with values.However,when the built-in functions are used to plot the minimum and maximum of functions in a domain, the first parameter inside the min() or max() function gets plotted irrespective of the actual values.Let's consider the following example:\n\n\n```\nf1(x)=sin(x)\nf2(x)=cos(x)\nf3(x)=x\np=plot([f1,f2,f3],(x,0,2*pi),linestyle='--')\np+=plot(min(f1(x),f2(x),f3(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='red') # f1(x) is plotted through out the domain even though its not                min at every point in the x-axis.\np+=plot(max(f2(x),f1(x),f3(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='green')#f2(x) is plotted through out the domain even though its not                max at every point in the x-axis.\np.show()\n```\n\nConsidering some polynomial functions:\n\n```\nf1(x)=x*x + 4*x + 2\nf2(x)=x^2\nf3(x)=x\np=plot([f1,f2,f3],(x,0,2*pi),linestyle='--')\np+=plot(min(f3(x),f1(x),f2(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='red') #always the first parameter in the min function gets plotted. \np+=plot(max(f2(x),f3(x),f2(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='green')#always the first parameter in the max function gets plotted.\np.show()\n```\n\nHowever, min_symbolic() and max_symbolic() are able to deal with variables as well as can be plotted with more than 2 parameters (functions) efficiently. Below are the examples of the same functions that were plotted by built-in min() and max() earlier.\n\n\n```\nf1(x)=sin(x)\nf2(x)=cos(x)\nf3(x)=x\np=plot([f1,f2,f3],(x,0,2*pi),linestyle='--')\np+=plot(min_symbolic(f1(x),f2(x),f3(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='red') # f1(x) is plotted through out the domain even though its not                min at every point in the x-axis.\np+=plot(max_symbolic(f2(x),f1(x),f3(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='green')#f2(x) is plotted through out the domain even though its not                max at every point in the x-axis.\np.show()\n```\n\n\n```\nf1(x)=x*x + 4*x + 2\nf2(x)=x^2\nf3(x)=x\np=plot([f1,f2,f3],(x,0,2*pi),linestyle='--')\np+=plot(min_symbolic(f3(x),f1(x),f2(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='red') #always the first parameter in the min function gets plotted. \np+=plot(max_symbolic(f2(x),f3(x),f1(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='green')#always the first parameter in the max function gets plotted.\np.show()\n```",

<a id='comment:7'>Comment 7:</a>
There is a fundamental difference between the min_sybolic()  and max_symbolic() from the built-in python functions min() and max() function.The Python built-in max() and min() functions don’t work as expected when symbolic expressions are given as arguments. This function delays evaluation until all symbolic arguments are substituted with values.However,when the built-in functions are used to plot the minimum and maximum of functions in a domain, the first parameter inside the min() or max() function gets plotted irrespective of the actual values.Let's consider the following example:


```
f1(x)=sin(x)
f2(x)=cos(x)
f3(x)=x
p=plot([f1,f2,f3],(x,0,2*pi),linestyle='--')
p+=plot(min(f1(x),f2(x),f3(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='red') # f1(x) is plotted through out the domain even though its not                min at every point in the x-axis.
p+=plot(max(f2(x),f1(x),f3(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='green')#f2(x) is plotted through out the domain even though its not                max at every point in the x-axis.
p.show()
```

Considering some polynomial functions:

```
f1(x)=x*x + 4*x + 2
f2(x)=x^2
f3(x)=x
p=plot([f1,f2,f3],(x,0,2*pi),linestyle='--')
p+=plot(min(f3(x),f1(x),f2(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='red') #always the first parameter in the min function gets plotted. 
p+=plot(max(f2(x),f3(x),f2(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='green')#always the first parameter in the max function gets plotted.
p.show()
```

However, min_symbolic() and max_symbolic() are able to deal with variables as well as can be plotted with more than 2 parameters (functions) efficiently. Below are the examples of the same functions that were plotted by built-in min() and max() earlier.


```
f1(x)=sin(x)
f2(x)=cos(x)
f3(x)=x
p=plot([f1,f2,f3],(x,0,2*pi),linestyle='--')
p+=plot(min_symbolic(f1(x),f2(x),f3(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='red') # f1(x) is plotted through out the domain even though its not                min at every point in the x-axis.
p+=plot(max_symbolic(f2(x),f1(x),f3(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='green')#f2(x) is plotted through out the domain even though its not                max at every point in the x-axis.
p.show()
```


```
f1(x)=x*x + 4*x + 2
f2(x)=x^2
f3(x)=x
p=plot([f1,f2,f3],(x,0,2*pi),linestyle='--')
p+=plot(min_symbolic(f3(x),f1(x),f2(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='red') #always the first parameter in the min function gets plotted. 
p+=plot(max_symbolic(f2(x),f3(x),f1(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='green')#always the first parameter in the max function gets plotted.
p.show()
```

i suppose we can fix this by merging to development branch. if you agree i shall try to update to the latest development version and push the changes.

for the rest, by comparing with other files (eg. `plot.py`) i still have the impression that one would like to have sphinx plots in the context of this ticket, too.

Yes That would be really great to update the latest development

I would add the sphinx documentation where needed. Thanks for the suggestion.

Hi Asutosh,

i've pushed a new branch (*) with one sphinx example (see the `plot.py` example). could you see if you like the updates + add the missing `.. PLOT::` blocks for the `min_max.py`? 

one lesson: it was tricky to use with sphinx, because it only accepts a subset of the commands that you would normally use in sage. to see examples of this, just have a look at the code examples in `plot.py`. for instance, it is not possible to assign to function calls, but there are other subtle things.

(*) i first tried to git pull the current branch, merge + compile but i miserably failed, three times. that's why your previous commits are not in the branch i pushed. you can try yourself if you want (`make doc-clean && make`) in your current branch; i gave up and started afresh. 

pd: if you need help to work with git other than what is explained in the user's guide let us know!

Removing the "beginner" tag from old tickets. Some could be returned to beginner-friendly status by adding a comment about what needs to be done. Some others might be easy for an experienced developer to finish.
