The function `min` and `max` are Python builtins. The name of the corresponding symbolic functions are `min_symbolic` and `max_symbolic` that were implemented in #6949:

```
sage: f(x) = min_symbolic(cos(x), sin(x))
sage: f
x |--> min(cos(x), sin(x))
```

It would be nice to have examples involving them in the function `sage.plot.plot.plot`. Those can be

```
sage: f(x) = min_symbolic(cos(x), sin(x))
sage: f
x |--> min(cos(x), sin(x))
sage: plot(f, (x,-2*pi,2*pi))
```
or/and

```
sage: f1(p) = 2*p + 1
sage: f2(p) = -p + 3
sage: f3(p) = 4*p - 1
sage: f4(p) = 3/2*p
sage: P = plot([f1,f2,f3,f4], (p,0,2), linestyle='--')
sage: P += plot(max_symbolic(f1(p), f2(p), f3(p), f4(p)), (p,0,2), color='red')
sage: P += plot(min_symbolic(f1(p), f2(p), f3(p), f4(p)), (p,0,2), color='green')
sage: P.show()
```

But be careful that the following currently does not work

```
sage: symbolic_min(f1, f2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: ...

Can we just write a very lightweight wrapper around the python min() function which behaves symbolically if given symbolic input, but otherwise is just like the python function?  Similar to how we have a lightweight wrapper around the sum function?

Here's another example of what can go wrong, though it's not related to plotting.

```
@interact

    f1(p) = (M[1,0] - M[0,0])*p+M[0,0]

This is commented out because it does the wrong thing.  The minimum it finds is the comparison of f1 and f2 as Python objects or whatever.

Hi there,

I rewrote a bit the description (please check that you agree). Involving the matrix in the example was quite confusing. I might use it for an introduction to Sage development on june 25th 2014.

There is a fundamental difference between the min_sybolic()  and max_symbolic() from the built-in python functions min() and max() function.The Python built-in max() and min() functions don’t work as expected when symbolic expressions are given as arguments. This function delays evaluation until all symbolic arguments are substituted with values.However,when the built-in functions are used to plot the minimum and maximum of functions in a domain, the first parameter inside the min() or max() function gets plotted irrespective of the actual values.Let's consider the following example:


```
f1(x)=sin(x)
f2(x)=cos(x)
f3(x)=x
p=plot([f1,f2,f3],(x,0,2*pi),linestyle='--')
p+=plot(min(f1(x),f2(x),f3(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='red') # f1(x) is plotted through out the domain even though its not                min at every point in the x-axis.
p+=plot(max(f2(x),f1(x),f3(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='green')#f2(x) is plotted through out the domain even though its not                max at every point in the x-axis.
p.show()
```

Considering some polynomial functions:

```
f1(x)=x*x + 4*x + 2
f2(x)=x^2
f3(x)=x
p=plot([f1,f2,f3],(x,0,2*pi),linestyle='--')
p+=plot(min(f3(x),f1(x),f2(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='red') #always the first parameter in the min function gets plotted. 
p+=plot(max(f2(x),f3(x),f2(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='green')#always the first parameter in the max function gets plotted.
p.show()
```

However, min_symbolic() and max_symbolic() are able to deal with variables as well as can be plotted with more than 2 parameters (functions) efficiently. Below are the examples of the same functions that were plotted by built-in min() and max() earlier.


```
f1(x)=sin(x)
f2(x)=cos(x)
f3(x)=x
p=plot([f1,f2,f3],(x,0,2*pi),linestyle='--')
p+=plot(min_symbolic(f1(x),f2(x),f3(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='red') # f1(x) is plotted through out the domain even though its not                min at every point in the x-axis.
p+=plot(max_symbolic(f2(x),f1(x),f3(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='green')#f2(x) is plotted through out the domain even though its not                max at every point in the x-axis.
p.show()
```


```
f1(x)=x*x + 4*x + 2
f2(x)=x^2
f3(x)=x
p=plot([f1,f2,f3],(x,0,2*pi),linestyle='--')
p+=plot(min_symbolic(f3(x),f1(x),f2(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='red') #always the first parameter in the min function gets plotted. 
p+=plot(max_symbolic(f2(x),f3(x),f1(x)),(x,0,2*pi),color='green')#always the first parameter in the max function gets plotted.
p.show()
```

Hi Asutosh,

i've pushed a new branch (*) with one sphinx example (see the `plot.py` example). could you see if you like the updates + add the missing `.. PLOT::` blocks for the `min_max.py`? 

one lesson: it was tricky to use with sphinx, because it only accepts a subset of the commands that you would normally use in sage. to see examples of this, just have a look at the code examples in `plot.py`. for instance, it is not possible to assign to function calls, but there are other subtle things.

(*) i first tried to git pull the current branch, merge + compile but i miserably failed, three times. that's why your previous commits are not in the branch i pushed. you can try yourself if you want (`make doc-clean && make`) in your current branch; i gave up and started afresh. 

pd: if you need help to work with git other than what is explained in the user's guide let us know!
