As a first step in simplifying the import hierarchy, remove obviously unused imports.

---

The patch below is the result of applying Robert's original patch (which was based on Sage 4.7.1) to the (presumably) final version of Sage 4.7.2.alpha3, ignoring rejects, and with some manual corrections due to afterwards occurring import errors when trying to start up Sage or running `ptestlong`.

The current omissions will be dealt with on follow-up tickets.

> I generated the patch with this code, plus a handful (less than a dozen) manual touch-ups where, e.g., symbols were used in eval() strings but not directly. 

Ok, so it is rather conservative with the exception of `eval()` and friends.

We should perhaps especially inspect those files modified that have a low "coverage"(though I strongly doubt the doctests of others will cover most execution paths...).


I think more sophisticated detection of superfluous imports can be left for follow-up tickets, just like the inclusion of Cython files.

The patch is certainly a big step forwards as is.
