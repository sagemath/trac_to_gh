The view command states that the pdflatex argument is deprecated and that one should use the engine argument instead.

But if one sets engine="pdflatex", it is overwritten, and so one currently needs to use the deprecated pdflatex option.

You should modify the header of your patch : replace

trac_11311: fix view to not overwrite engine="pdflatex"

by

#11311: fix view to not overwrite engine="pdflatex"

Then the buildbot will be more happy.

Question:  when I do

it opens in my pdf viewer, not in my TeX program.  This seems wrong, based on the current doc, but I could be wrong. 

I'm also attaching a rebased patch.

Otherwise, I think it looks good.

As far as opening in a pdf viewer rather than in a TeX program, hasn't that been the behavior for a while?  (Sage basically opens up the file, blah.pdf or blah.dvi, using some sensible default depending on the OS -- see the file misc/viewer.py.

I'm attaching a referee patch which removes the code duplication referred to above.

Karl-Dieter: the program "sage-open", as defined in sage/misc/viewer.py, should be used to open the output file.  Before the patch here, it was called with `output_file` set to "sage.dvi" or something like that.  After the patch, it is called with `output_file` set to "sage.pdf".  So any difference in what program is being used is because this is producing a pdf file, not a dvi file.

I'd like to change this from "needs info" to "positive review".   Is that okay?

I get doctest failures on a system which does not have `latex` installed:

```
sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/misc/latex.py

File "/Users/jdemeyer/sage-4.8.alpha1/devel/sage-main/sage/misc/latex.py", line 1877:

    ValueError: Unsupported LaTeX engine.
Got:

    Latex error
**********************************************************************
File "/Users/jdemeyer/sage-4.8.alpha1/devel/sage-main/sage/misc/latex.py", line 1882:

Got:
    Error: XeLaTeX does not seem to be installed.  Download it from

    Latex error
**********************************************************************
```

Fixing this would mean adding "# optional - latex" to the doctest.

But it also makes me wonder: why check the existence of XeLaTeX when `engine="garbage"`?  This doesn't make much sense to me.

This seems to have been introduced (or expanded, at least) in #8486.

```
    if engine and not have_pdflatex() and not have_xelatex(): 
 	        print "Error: %s does not seem to be installed.  Download it from" % _Latex_prefs._option["engine_name"] 
```
so `engine` is certainly `True` since it's nonempty, and we definitely don't have any of those things.  And it first checks whether one has LaTeX, before it checks the engines.  

Now we have 

```
sage: sage.misc.latex._Latex_prefs._option
{'engine': 'latex', 'matrix_delimiters': ['(', ')'], 'jsmath_avoid': [], 'engine_name': 'LaTeX', 'blackboard_bold': False, 'macros': '', 'vector_delimiters': ['(', ')'], 'preamble': ''}
```
in a regular install.  The question is whether there is anywhere `engine` gets reset...  

Aha!  [Line 1404](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/9e29a3d84c48/sage/misc/latex.py#l1404) (of the current 4.7.2) shows that this is set to `xelatex` and then not reset.   Apparently the doctest framework doesn't clear this, I'm not sure exactly where this all lives.

Solution should be:
* Fix the reset of the engine
* Leave the error message and `# random` it.   Or even include both error messages so that the documentation shows exactly what we expect with and without a working LaTeX installation.

What do you think?

Replying to [kcrisman](#comment%3A22):
> What do you think?

I think we should try to find a solution which leaves all doctests as they are (including the new ones on this ticket): change the code, not the tests.

Maybe the code should be more like:

```
if engine is None:
    engine = "latex"
if (engine=="latex" and not have_latex()) or (engine=="pdflatex" and not have_pdflatex()) or (engine=="xelatex" and not have_xelatex):
    raise RuntimeError,...
```

I just noticed that randomizing the doctests fails sometimes, with errors of the following form:

```
sage -t  --randorder devel/sage/sage/misc/latex.py
...
File "/Users/saliola/Applications/sage-5.0/devel/sage/sage/misc/latex.py", line 221:
    sage: builtin_constant_function(NotImplemented)
Expected:
    '\\mbox{\\rm NotImplemented}'
Got:
    '{\\rm NotImplemented}'
...
```
Since this isn't cause by this patch (in fact, this patch improves things), I created a new ticket #12986 for this.
