Before the patch here, it was called with `output_file` set to "sage.dvi" or something like that.  After the patch, it is called with `output_file` set to "sage.pdf".

Fixing this would mean adding "# optional - latex" to the doctest.

But it also makes me wonder: why check the existence of XeLaTeX when `engine="garbage"`?  This doesn't make much sense to me.

<a id='comment:22'></a>This seems to have been introduced (or expanded, at least) in #8486.

```
    if engine and not have_pdflatex() and not have_xelatex(): 
 	        print "Error: %s does not seem to be installed.  Download it from" % _Latex_prefs._option["engine_name"] 
```
so `engine` is certainly `True` since it's nonempty, and we definitely don't have any of those things.  And it first checks whether one has LaTeX, before it checks the engines.  

Now we have 

```
sage: sage.misc.latex._Latex_prefs._option
{'engine': 'latex', 'matrix_delimiters': ['(', ')'], 'jsmath_avoid': [], 'engine_name': 'LaTeX', 'blackboard_bold': False, 'macros': '', 'vector_delimiters': ['(', ')'], 'preamble': ''}
```
in a regular install.  The question is whether there is anywhere `engine` gets reset...  

Aha!  [Line 1404](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/9e29a3d84c48/sage/misc/latex.py#l1404) (of the current 4.7.2) shows that this is set to `xelatex` and then not reset.   Apparently the doctest framework doesn't clear this, I'm not sure exactly where this all lives.

Solution should be:
* Fix the reset of the engine
* Leave the error message and `# random` it.   Or even include both error messages so that the documentation shows exactly what we expect with and without a working LaTeX installation.

What do you think?

> What do you think?

I think we should try to find a solution which leaves all doctests as they are (including the new ones on this ticket): change the code, not the tests.

Maybe the code should be more like:

```
if engine is None:
    engine = "latex"
if (engine=="latex" and not have_latex()) or (engine=="pdflatex" and not have_pdflatex()) or (engine=="xelatex" and not have_xelatex):
    raise RuntimeError,...
```

<a id='comment:30'></a>I just noticed that randomizing the doctests fails sometimes, with errors of the following form:

```
sage -t  --randorder devel/sage/sage/misc/latex.py
...
File "/Users/saliola/Applications/sage-5.0/devel/sage/sage/misc/latex.py", line 221:
    sage: builtin_constant_function(NotImplemented)
Expected:
    '\\mbox{\\rm NotImplemented}'
Got:
    '{\\rm NotImplemented}'
...
```
Since this isn't cause by this patch (in fact, this patch improves things), I created a new ticket #12986 for this.
