I don't see any good reason why the version number of Sage is used when creating pickles using `sage.structure.sage_object.picklejar`

```
def picklejar(obj, dir=None):
    """
    Create pickled sobj of obj in dir, with name the absolute value of
    the hash of the pickle of obj.  This is used in conjunction with
    sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all.

    To use this to test the whole Sage library right now, set the
    environment variable SAGE_PICKLE_JAR, which will make it so dumps
    will by default call picklejar with the default dir.  Once you do
    that and doctest Sage, you'll find that the SAGE_ROOT/tmp/
    contains a bunch of pickled objects along with corresponding txt
    descriptions of them.  Use the
    sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all to see if they unpickle
    later.

    INPUTS:

    - ``obj`` - a pickleable object

    - ``dir`` - a string or None; if None defaults to
      ``SAGE_ROOT/tmp/pickle_jar-version``
```

I guess one could use `os.stat()` but I don't see a reason to add this complication.  The only thing which matters is that the directory can be **removed** without errors.
