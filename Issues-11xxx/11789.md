I wanted to use couchdb, but it was a real pain to find a way:

http://wiki.sagemath.org/couchdb

We should find a way that it will compile with ssl-support. A lot of other python eggs need this too.

> We should find a way that it will compile with ssl-support. A lot of other python eggs need this too.

I haven't had any problems on Ubuntu (10.04.3 LTS) importing `ssl` (or `_ssl`).

I.e., after installing the (Debian) package `libssl-dev` (which includes the necessary header files, in contrast to `libssl`), then reinstalling our current Python 2.6.4.p11 spkg (with `sage -f ...`, to **f**orce reinstallation), all worked fine.

(Haven't tried to install couchdb into Sage's Python though.)

I agree that the documentation on how to [`easy_`]install Python packages for use with Sage could certainly be better.



 
For SSL, which is (or [should be](http://www.eff.org/press/archives/2011/04/19-0)) ubiquitous, we could do a prerequisite check (although it *currently* isn't required by any part of Sage) *before* building Sage or its Python package, or at least test whether importing `ssl` works after installation, and issue a warning otherwise. (We already test that other crucial Python core packages *are* functional after the build, i.e., can be imported without errors at least, and exit with a more or less appropriate error message in case some don't.)

Unfortunately, running Python's own test suite gives a few (irrelevant) errors on almost any system, also depending on the configuration.

Hmmm, I still cannot reproduce what exactly failed for you.

After reinstalling our **unmodified** Python spkg, with the `libssl-dev` Debian package installed in advance, the following all works for me:

```sh
$ ./sage --sh -c "easy_install http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.6/C/CouchDB/CouchDB-0.8-py2.6.egg#md5=b47f8fe5f0c76d7c45bf8e4805d43de4"

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.
Be sure to exit when you are done and do not do anything
with other copies of Sage!

Bypassing shell configuration files ...

Downloading http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.6/C/CouchDB/CouchDB-0.8-py2.6.egg#md5=b47f8fe5f0c76d7c45bf8e4805d43de4

Processing dependencies for CouchDB==0.8
Finished processing dependencies for CouchDB==0.8
Exited Sage subshell.
```

Then, from Sage:

```
sage: import ssl
sage: import _ssl
sage: import couchdb
sage: from httplib import HTTPSConnection
sage: 
```

So does something else fail in a later stage when using `couchdb`?

(If so, we could include any necessary changes into our standard Python spkg, such that nobody would have to manually make changes to it, unless the build would fail in case e.g. `libssl-dev`, or other prerequisites, weren't available. It should be possible to circumvent the latter though, probably by additional changes.)

Sorry for that.

Feel free to also contribute to e.g. the [Sage Installation Guide](http://sagemath.org/doc/installation/) or the [FAQ](http://sagemath.org/doc/faq/); any improvements are always welcome.

FrankPolte: leif was not saying that you must import ssl and _ssl before importing couchdb. He was just demonstrating that one can import ssl and _ssl, and then demonstrating that one can import couchdb. So his way is not more "python-couchdb-native". I think there was just some weirdness on your system which eventually happened to go away.
