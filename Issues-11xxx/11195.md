This was meant for instructional purposes, but for some exact fields (eg finite fields) it is twice as fast as echelon form when Cythonized, as theory would predict.

So it could be the basis of a fast alternative algorithm for `solve_right` and friends.

Patch is here for safe-keeping, but not ready for review.  It should run just fine, needs caching perhaps, and needs docstring and doctests.
