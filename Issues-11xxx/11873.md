Also: (why) is the code for pAdicExtElement a copy of the code for pAdicGenericElement? Why not remove the abs function for extension elements and move its examples to the generic one?

I changed `if prec is None` to `if not prec`.  Do you prefer this?

Done, moved all code to `padic_generic_element.pyx`
