We already have a script which checks the type of C compiler. I think that can either be used as-is, or with a small modification. The script is:

```
  $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/testcc.sh
```

I think it would be better to call that, rather than create another script. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.7.alpha3$ export CC=ls              # Not a valid C compiler.

<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

I think it would be better if testcc.sh exited with a nonzero status if there were a problem, but I don't know how to do that.  The culprit is the line

```
${CC_LOCAL} -E $TESTFILE | grep '^[A-Z]' | sed 's/ //g'
```
This returns the exit code for the last command in the pipeline, rather than the exit status for "${CC_LOCAL} ...", which is what we care about.

As it stands, though, if I use testcc.sh, I can see whether it outputs anything; if there is no output, there must not be a valid C compiler.

So now that you've pointed it out, I think that testcc.sh is a good tool to check whether the C compiler works, and I've incorporated it into the sage-check-cc script.  That is, sage-check-cc is acting like a front-end to testcc.sh, taking care of printing a warning and caching the appropriate information.

I agree. I'll see if I can modify it. I originally created the script and understood it fully. Leif made some modifications, so now I'm not sure if I understand it fully. But it should be possible to make this exit with a non-zero code if there's not a compiler.

Should a C++ compiler be checked for too? Certainly rebuilding the Sage library needs a C++ compiler, as running: 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.7.alpha3$ ./sage -ba | grep g++ 
```

produces a lot of output. (You need to insert a "y", as the script asks for that, though you can't see it because of the grep statement)

Okay, so when do we need to print an error?

- when running `sage -ba`
- when running `sage -b` if a Cython file has been modified
- when running `sage --cython ...`
- when running `sage --upgrade ...`
- when running `sage -i ...` or `sage -f ...`
- while running sage, when attaching a pyx or spyx file
- while running the sage notebook, when evaluating a `%cython` block 

Anything else?

It seems like it might actually be less intrusive if you print a warning once, the first time Sage is run, than if you raise an error whenever any of these are attempted.  It  also looks more complicated to write a patch to catch all of the possible cases.

But I don't have a strong opinion about this.  I agree with the "minor" priority for this ticket...

I feel like printing a warning once is essentially equivalent to not printing a warning at all.  Very likely, it will go unnoticed.

So my personal feeling for this ticket is "wontfix".  It looks too complicated to do it right, and the gain is marginal.
