<a id='comment:4'></a>I think it would be better if testcc.sh exited with a nonzero status if there were a problem, but I don't know how to do that.  The culprit is the line

```
${CC_LOCAL} -E $TESTFILE | grep '^[A-Z]' | sed 's/ //g'
```
This returns the exit code for the last command in the pipeline, rather than the exit status for "${CC_LOCAL} ...", which is what we care about.

As it stands, though, if I use testcc.sh, I can see whether it outputs anything; if there is no output, there must not be a valid C compiler.

So now that you've pointed it out, I think that testcc.sh is a good tool to check whether the C compiler works, and I've incorporated it into the sage-check-cc script.  That is, sage-check-cc is acting like a front-end to testcc.sh, taking care of printing a warning and caching the appropriate information.

I agree. I'll see if I can modify it. I originally created the script and understood it fully. Leif made some modifications, so now I'm not sure if I understand it fully. But it should be possible to make this exit with a non-zero code if there's not a compiler.

<a id='comment:11'></a>Okay, so when do we need to print an error?

- when running `sage -ba`
- when running `sage -b` if a Cython file has been modified
- when running `sage --cython ...`
- when running `sage --upgrade ...`
- when running `sage -i ...` or `sage -f ...`
- while running sage, when attaching a pyx or spyx file
- while running the sage notebook, when evaluating a `%cython` block 

Anything else?

It seems like it might actually be less intrusive if you print a warning once, the first time Sage is run, than if you raise an error whenever any of these are attempted.  It  also looks more complicated to write a patch to catch all of the possible cases.

But I don't have a strong opinion about this.  I agree with the "minor" priority for this ticket...
