We already have a script which checks the type of C compiler. I think that can either be used as-is, or with a small modification. The script is:

```
  $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/testcc.sh
```

I think it would be better to call that, rather than create another script. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.7.alpha3$ export CC=ls              # Not a valid C compiler.

I think it would be better if testcc.sh exited with a nonzero status if there were a problem, but I don't know how to do that.  The culprit is the line

```
${CC_LOCAL} -E $TESTFILE | grep '^[A-Z]' | sed 's/ //g'
```
This returns the exit code for the last command in the pipeline, rather than the exit status for "${CC_LOCAL} ...", which is what we care about.

As it stands, though, if I use testcc.sh, I can see whether it outputs anything; if there is no output, there must not be a valid C compiler.

So now that you've pointed it out, I think that testcc.sh is a good tool to check whether the C compiler works, and I've incorporated it into the sage-check-cc script.  That is, sage-check-cc is acting like a front-end to testcc.sh, taking care of printing a warning and caching the appropriate information.

I agree. I'll see if I can modify it. I originally created the script and understood it fully. Leif made some modifications, so now I'm not sure if I understand it fully. But it should be possible to make this exit with a non-zero code if there's not a compiler.

Should a C++ compiler be checked for too? Certainly rebuilding the Sage library needs a C++ compiler, as running: 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.7.alpha3$ ./sage -ba | grep g++ 
```

produces a lot of output. (You need to insert a "y", as the script asks for that, though you can't see it because of the grep statement)

```

Okay, so when do we need to print an error?

- when running `sage -ba`
- when running `sage -b` if a Cython file has been modified
- when running `sage --cython ...`
- when running `sage --upgrade ...`
- when running `sage -i ...` or `sage -f ...`
- while running sage, when attaching a pyx or spyx file
- while running the sage notebook, when evaluating a `%cython` block 

Anything else?

It seems like it might actually be less intrusive if you print a warning once, the first time Sage is run, than if you raise an error whenever any of these are attempted.  It  also looks more complicated to write a patch to catch all of the possible cases.

But I don't have a strong opinion about this.  I agree with the "minor" priority for this ticket...

See also #13533.  I feel like these are at cross-purposes, though I can't say exactly why.

I feel like printing a warning once is essentially equivalent to not printing a warning at all.  Very likely, it will go unnoticed.
