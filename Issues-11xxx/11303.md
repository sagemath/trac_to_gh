The help page given by attach? claims:

```
        Type attached_files() for a list of all currently attached files.
        You can remove files from this list to stop them from being watched.
```

This has actually no effect:

```
sage: attach spfact.py
sage: version()
'Sage Version 4.6.2, Release Date: 2011-02-25'
sage: attached_files()
['/home/florent/recherche/kSchur/kshape/sage/spfact.py']
sage: attached_files().pop()
'/home/florent/recherche/kSchur/kshape/sage/spfact.py'
sage: attached_files()
['/home/florent/recherche/kSchur/kshape/sage/spfact.py']
```
