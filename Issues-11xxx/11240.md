In April 2011 I completed the elliptic curve database for the range 130000-140000.  The spkg database_cremona_ellcurve needs to be updated accordingly.  This will need a minor change to the function _init_allgens() in sage/databases/cremona.py since the format of the allgens files has changed (torsion structure and generators are now included).

Update 28 June 2011: as above but to 150000 (and will be 160000 in a week or so).
