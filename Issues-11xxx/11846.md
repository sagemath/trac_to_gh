Hello !!

Dealing with highly regular graphs, I noticed Cliquer sometimes didn't spot regular structures and spent some time that a LP could ignore. This patch adds the formulation to the independent_set method. I believe it was there a looooong time ago `:-)`

The MILP model is correct, the patch is working properly, and the doc is OK.


Remark: The test line 3820 is surprising, but it has the advantage of working both with patch https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/10505 (Round values returned by CPLEX when the variable's type is integer/binary), and without that patch.
