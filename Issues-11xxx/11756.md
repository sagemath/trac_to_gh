I tested this SPKG on cicero and doctests pass.

There was a minor issue:

```
$ hg status
? patches/SConstruct.orig
? patches/SConstruct.rej
```
which I fixed in http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/polybori-0.7.1.p5.spkg.

Alexander, if you agree with this fix then just replace the link in the description of the ticket and we are good to go for a positive review.
