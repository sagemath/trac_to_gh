In python 2.7 deprecation warnings are a developer only feature. Which mean that sage's deprecation warnings are not shown either. A previous patch in #9958 only re-enable deprecation warnings in doctests but not in regular sage sessions.

A previous patch in #9958 only re-enable deprecation warnings in doctests but not in regular sage sessions. Note that warnings issued by sage are also ignored. This ticket is mainly interested in deprecation warnings, pure warnings it appears are not tested at all in sage which will make them difficult to track.
+In python 2.7 deprecation warnings are a developer only feature. Which mean that sage's deprecation warnings are not shown either. A previous patch in #9958 only re-enable deprecation warnings in doctests but not in regular sage sessions.
