In python 2.7 deprecation warnings are a developer only feature. Which mean that sage's deprecation warnings are not shown either. A previous patch in #9958 only re-enable deprecation warnings in doctests but not in regular sage sessions.

There is an issue with

```
sage -t -force_lib "devel/sage-main/sage/combinat/partition.py"
**********************************************************************
File "/usr/share/sage/devel/sage-main/sage/combinat/partition.py", line 2511:
    sage: RestrictedPartitions(5,[3,2,1])
Expected:
    doctest:...: DeprecationWarning: RestrictedPartitions is deprecated; use Partitions with the parts_in keyword instead.
    doctest:...: DeprecationWarning: RestrictedPartitions_nsk is deprecated; use Partitions with the parts_in keyword instead.
    Partitions of 5 restricted to the values [1, 2, 3]
Got:
    doctest:260: DeprecationWarning: RestrictedPartitions_nsk is deprecated; use Partitions with the parts_in keyword instead.
    Partitions of 5 restricted to the values [1, 2, 3] 
```
But clearly I am not sure why the original code should give both a warning and a deprecation warning. Of course my patch only let sage display the later.
