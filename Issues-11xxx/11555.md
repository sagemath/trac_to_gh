Morphisms between free modules are basically represented by matrices.  Here is how they sometimes print:

```
sage: V = ZZ^6
sage: W = ZZ^4
sage: m = matrix(QQ, [[1, 0, 0 ,0], [0]*4, [0]*4, [0]*4, [0]*4, [0]*4])
sage: phi = V.hom(m, W)
sage: rho = phi.restrict_codomain(W.span([W.0]))
sage: rho
Free module morphism defined by the matrix
(not printing 6 x 1 matrix)
Domain: Ambient free module of rank 6 over the principal ideal domain ...
Codomain: Free module of degree 4 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
Echelon ...
```

The cutoff (...) on the domains is totally arbitrary, at 60 characters.

Here is the new output with upcoming patch:

```
Free module morphism defined by the matrix
[1]
[0]
[0]
[0]
[0]
[0]
Domain: Ambient free module of rank 6 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
Codomain: Free module of degree 4 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[1 0 0 0]
```

Passes all long tests for 4.7.1.alpha3

Small chance this will bitrot, relative to some other patches I have up for related files.  I'll try to stay on top of it, but let me know if this causes doctests failures.
