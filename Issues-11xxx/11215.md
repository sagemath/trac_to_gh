This ticket implements a `period(g)` method for cusp forms of weight 2 for `Gamma0(n)`.  It currently accepts only elements `g` in `Gamma0(n)` as input.

```
sage: f = Newforms(15, 2)[0]
sage: g = Gamma0(15)(matrix([[-4, -3], [15, 11]]))
sage: f.period(g)
2.17298044293747e-16 - 1.59624222213178*I
```

In the future we should have functions which allow for pairing of the following:

-cuspidal modular symbols for Gamma0(N) with cusp forms for Gamma0(N)

-cusp forms for Gamma0(N) with cusp forms for Gamma0(N) (Petersson inner product)

As you suggest, it would be alot better to use the fact that f will be an eigenform for the Fricke involution, since that replaces the N in the denominator of the negative exponential with sqrt(N).  The necessary formulas are in the same place....!

Another improvement would be ta take the precision as in put rather than the number of terms, and compute the necessary number of terms.

All this is implemented in eclib, for forms of weight 2, trivial character *and rational Fourier coefficients only* so (not for the first time) I am wishing for an interface to all that additional functionality.  Anyway, here we can be more general since there need be no requirement of rationality.

Here is a new commit, where I tried to make it more readable.

I have also changed the ValueError test, that looked wrong

I have added a comment about M.a() etc

The new commit renames the method to `period`, and adds a `prec` argument and a line of code to deduce a bound on the number of terms of the series from that.  I don't have a reference for this bound; I just computed a slightly rough but hopefully correct one and put the basic idea in a comment.

There are various other changes.  All computations are now done in `RealField(prec)` and the associated `ComplexField`.  The method now also checks its input more carefully.

I guess this does not really qualify as a reviewer patch anymore, but it is probably still OK if one of the existing authors reviews these changes instead of a "disinterested third party".
