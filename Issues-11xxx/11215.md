This ticket implements a `period(g)` method for cusp forms of weight 2 for `Gamma0(n)`.  It currently accepts only elements `g` in `Gamma0(n)` as input.

```
sage: f = Newforms(15, 2)[0]
sage: g = Gamma0(15)(matrix([[-4, -3], [15, 11]]))
sage: f.period(g)
2.17298044293747e-16 - 1.59624222213178*I
```

In the future we should have functions which allow for pairing of the following:

-cuspidal modular symbols for Gamma0(N) with cusp forms for Gamma0(N)

-cusp forms for Gamma0(N) with cusp forms for Gamma0(N) (Petersson inner product)

There are various other changes.  All computations are now done in `RealField(prec)` and the associated `ComplexField`.  The method now also checks its input more carefully.

I guess this does not really qualify as a reviewer patch anymore, but it is probably still OK if one of the existing authors reviews these changes instead of a "disinterested third party".
