The meet and join methods of a lattice should be more robust about their inputs, like the is_lequal method is.

```
sage: P = Posets.IntegerCompositions(4)
sage: L = LatticePoset(P)
sage: L.list()
[[4], [3, 1], [2, 2], [2, 1, 1], [1, 3], [1, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1, 1]]
sage: L.meet([3,1], [1,2,1])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<snip>
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'vertex'
sage: L.is_lequal([3,1], [1,2,1])
