An unfolding or a net of a polyhedron is an arrangement of edge-joined polygons in the plane which can be folded (along edges) to become the faces of the polyhedron. 

There might be an overlap between polygons (this is an open problem).

Sorry, I am traveling right now and its hard to find time for Sage development.  I do have some comments though.  

Not all the functions in your patch have documentation/doctests.  These are mandatory for every function, so they need to be added.

I think it will make sense to merge our efforts.  I haven't completely fixed up my student's effort but I am attaching the current state so you can take a look at what we did.  There are different strengths and weaknesses in our efforts.  Ours can handle tougher problems, but we don't have a function to check for overlaps.

If you haven't looked at the master's thesis of Schlickenrieder (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.28.2631&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
I highly recommend it.  It was based on his work that my student choose to implement the steepest-edge algorithm.

A good test problem is what Schlickenrieder calls "turtles", for example:

```
tpoints = [[i,j,i^2+j^2] for i in srange(-5,6,1) for j in srange(-5,6,1)]
tp = Polyhedron(vertices=tpoints)
```

My status is that I am too busy with other duties to finish this off, although I would really like to.  

The code in my "trac_11564_preliminary_effort.patch" patch is from a student project.  It works, but it could really use some refactoring.

Its possible I would find time to put more effort into this over my winter vacation, but don't count on it.  Otherwise, if no one else works on it I would hope to tackle it in the spring or summer.

As I mentioned before, your code mainly needed full documentation (doctests).  While it would be nice if it could handle some tough cases, for this kind of functionality something is better than nothing so feel free to finish your version up and I should be able to find time to review it.

Here are a few things to fix:

- Is the function `faceorder` used? It doesn't seem so.
- In the description of `faceorder I would say:

```
Return a linear ordering of the edges in a spanning tree for the facet adjacency graph of `poly`.
```

- Many comments are in German: it would be good to have them in English.
- Many OUTPUT and EXAMPLES are missing.
- Many lines contain (likely old) "Versuch". They should be deleted once every works well...
- Class Unfolding needs docstring for the class and its methods
- Some conventions should be checked (spaces around `=` -> ` = ` and such...

I know it is a bit premature for me to give feedback, but it can be used later for a checklist.

I guess also there should be a method in `base.py` called something like `def unfolding(...):` that will return the picture?
