<a id='comment:1'></a>Although this started a long time ago (1979) one version of my C++ code -- for the five Euclidean fields -- was the subject of my attention earlier this month, and is in quite good shape.

There is a second C++ version by my student Jeremy Bygott which should do everything version 1 does and more (all class number 1 fields and any class number 2 fields for which the homology information has been precomputed).  This needs some attention, but has the potential to supersede version 1 for all fields of class numbers 1 and 2.

In addition, I have:  two directories of Magma code, one each for the fields -23 and -31 of class number 3, written by my student Mark Lingham.  I recently used these to provide Hecke eigenvalues for a paper by Pacetti at al.

Also, in Sage already my student Maite Aranes wrote completely general code for handling cusps over number fields (including Gamma_0(N)-equivalence, for example) in sage/modular/cusps_nf.py, and for M-symbols also over arbitrary fields, in sage/modular/modsym/p1list_nf.py.  [Note that these two are literally for arbitrary number fields, not just imaginary quadratic fields.]

I changed the milestone to sage-wishlist!

<a id='comment:3'></a>For the 5 Euclidean fields my C++ code is in good shape and can be found in https://github.com/JohnCremona/bianchi-progs .

For the other class number 1 fields and higher class number fields there is no change (regarding my own code) to what I wrote 5 years ago.

I have no motivation for doing this and do not know what the demand is.  Even for the modular symbol code over Q, a small part of which was wrapped years ago by William and me, there has been essentially no demand for the rest to be made available through Sage.
