Symptoms:

Mildly confusing.  Though not harmful, it violates the intent of the isomorphism-checking code:

```
sage: P = Posets.BooleanLattice(5)
sage: H = P.hasse_diagram()
sage: H.is_isomorphic(H)
/sage/sage-4.7.alpha3/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py:15043: 
DeprecationWarning: (Since Sage Version 4.4 (2010-05)) size is deprecated. 
Please use cardinality instead.
  if self.size() != other.size():
True
```

Wrong, if the diagram is being considered as a digraph:

```
sage: P = Posets.BooleanLattice(5)
sage: H = P.hasse_diagram()
sage: isinstance(H, DiGraph)
True
sage: H.num_edges()
80
sage: H.size()
/sage/sage-4.7.alpha3/local/bin/sage-ipython:1: 
DeprecationWarning: (Since Sage Version 4.4 (2010-05)) size is deprecated. 
Please use cardinality instead.
  #!/usr/bin/env python
32
```

Explanation:

Posets and Hasse diagrams formerly had a `size` method.  In the case of a Hasse diagram, this was overriding the same-named method for digraphs, and the two had different meanings (size of base set for posets, number of edges for a digraph).

`size()` was deprecated for posets and Hasse diagrams (#8735), but a side-effect is the warning is raised for any graph-theory code called for a Hasse diagram which invokes `size()`(as above).

The deprecation was merged 12 months ago.  By the time this might get reviewed and merged, it will most likely have been at least a year since the deprecation was released.

Patch removes the warning.  It adds a test to the cardinality method of a Hasse diagram (should it go somewhere else?) to be sure that `size()` (finally) does the right thing for the underlying digraph.

This looks all good to go (assuming the buildbot goes green)!

Note: this probably will commute with #10998 but we should double check that.
