Everything that I ask for was addressed.  Thanks Anne!  Chris and I were using this code just yesterday and found it super useful.  I double checked that the transpositions were on the correct side :

```
sage: c = Core([11,8,5,5,3,3,1,1,1],4)
sage: c.affine_symmetric_group_action([2,5],transposition=True)
[11, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
which agrees with Example 9.6 of LLMS - Affine Insertion paper
