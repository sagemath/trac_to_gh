```
In Sage-4.7 (on Linux and OS X), we have:

```
sage: '***' in gp.eval('a='+str(range(10^3)))
False
sage: '***' in gp.eval('a='+str(range(10^4)))
False
sage: '***' in gp.eval('a='+str(range(10^5)))
False
sage: '***' in gp.eval('a='+str(range(10^6)))
True
```

The "***" appearing in the output means that an error occurs.  Looking further we find:

```
sage: print gp.eval('a='+str(range(10^6)))
  ***   [...] at: read("/scratch/wstei
  ***             ^--------------------
  ***   in function read: read("/scratch/wstei
...
  *** read: error opening input file: `/scratch/wstein/sage//temp/mod.math.washington.edu/17446//interface//tmp17449'.
```
Shockingly, looking at the file we are reading it we find that it contains:

```
sage: !more /scratch/wstein/sage//temp/mod.math.washington.edu/17446//interface//tmp17449
read("/scratch/wstein/sage//temp/mod.math.washington.edu/17446//interface//tmp17449")
```

So, instead of writing the long string we are supposed to read in, the file contains a single line asking to read in itself!  

NOTE: This bug was originally observed by Zhibin Liang.
