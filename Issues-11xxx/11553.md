Adds three methods to the matrix morphism class:

1.  `is_bijective()`
2.  `is_identity()`
3.  `inverse()`

I did not notice that `__invert__` via ~ was available by using tab-completion, which should explain the last one.

If there is a theme, it is better support for compositions of these morphisms.

**Depends**
1.  #11552

<a id='comment:2'></a>The surjectivity test doesn't work fine over other euclidian domains:


```
sage: R=PolynomialRing(QQ,'x')
sage: A=FreeModule(R,2)
sage: B=FreeModule(R,2)
sage: H=A.hom([B([x^2-1,1]),B([x^2,1])])
sage: H   
Free module morphism defined by the matrix
[x^2 - 1       1]
[    x^2       1]

Codomain: Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain ...
sage: H.image()
Free module of degree 2 and rank 2 over Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
Echelon basis matrix:
[ 1  0]
[ 0 -1]        
sage: H.is_surjective()
False
sage: H.is_injective()
True
sage: H.inverse()

Domain: Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain ...
Codomain: Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain ...
sage: H.is_identity()
False

```


But 


```
sage: F=A.hom([B([x^2-1,1]),B([-x^2,-1])])
sage: F.image()
Free module of degree 2 and rank 2 over Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
Echelon basis matrix:
[1 0]
[0 1]     
sage: F.is_surjective()
True
sage: F.is         
sage: F.is_identity()
False
```


I think the problem is in ticket 11552, it still needs work.

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'a')
sage: x = vector(R, [1, 0])

Thanks for the improvements.  The changes in the review patch look good to me, and pass tests in sage/modules, sage/matrix.  So, as suggested, I've set this to positive review.

4.7.2.alpha1 + #11552 + #10793

Rebased main patch to make v4 patch.  This was a trivial change.

Got bit by the nasty bug that is fixed in #10793, so two doctests needed to have their matrix dimensions reversed (maybe not really transposes *per se*).  This minor change to the code is on the "doctests" patch and should require a (simple) review.
