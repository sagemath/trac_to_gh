I propose to add to the list of simplicial complexes the minimal triangulation of the K3 surface, which has 16 vertices and 288 facets.

```
sage: simplicial_complexes.K3_surface()
Simplicial complex with vertex set (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16) and 288 facets
```

This is can either be defined by storing the data or by recovering it using a group action. What should I prefer ?

This mostly looks good.  I'm attaching a referee patch:

- only import `PermutationGroup` where it's needed, not at the top-level.
- add a sentence to the documentation.
- format the references correctly.

If you're happy with these changes, then the whole ticket can get a positive review.
