Assignee: @jhpalmieri

CC:  sage-combinat

Keywords: simplicial complex

I propose to add to the list of simplicial complexes the minimal triangulation of the K3 surface, which has 16 vertices and 288 facets.

```
sage: simplicial_complexes.K3_surface()
Simplicial complex with vertex set (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16) and 288 facets
```

This is can either be defined by storing the data or by recovering it using a group action. What should I prefer ?

Adding the K3 surface would be great.  Can you describe what's involved for the two approaches (storing the data or using the group action)?  Then I could make a better suggestion about which to use here.

That would be nice! If there is some reasonably easy way to construct the complex from a group action then it should be done that way so that others can learn from the source code. But just listing raw data would be fine with me, too.

This mostly looks good.  I'm attaching a referee patch:

- only import `PermutationGroup` where it's needed, not at the top-level.
- add a sentence to the documentation.
- format the references correctly.

If you're happy with these changes, then the whole ticket can get a positive review.
