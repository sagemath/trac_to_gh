The following integration fails:

```
sage: integrate(sin(x)*sin(x/3)/x^2, x, 0, oo)       
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (554, 0))

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: Integral is divergent.
```
But the integral is not divergent. It seems that `integrate` uses Maxima, but Maxima can compute the correct result:

```
sage: maxima.integrate(sin(x)*sin(x/3)/x^2, x, 0, oo)
%pi/6
```

A very relevant data point is that 

```
sage: maxima_calculus.integrate(sin(x)*sin(x/3)/x^2, x, 0, oo)
    624                 self._name = parent._create(value, name=name)
    625             except (TypeError, KeyboardInterrupt, RuntimeError, ValueError), x:
--> 626                 raise TypeError, x
    627 
    628     def _latex_(self):

TypeError: ECL says: Divergent Integral
```
And that is the "copy" of Maxima we use for integration and other calculus stuff, and that's why the error is returned.

So the problem must be in one of the "extra" things we use for calculus.

---
Here's vanilla Sage Maxima.

```

(%i1) integrate(sin(x)*sin(x/3)/x^2, x, 0,inf);
                                      %pi
(%o1)                                 ---
                                       6
```
And none of the standard things we do to initialize 

```
init_code = ['display2d : false', 'domain : complex', 'keepfloat : true',
            'load(to_poly_solver)', 'load(simplify_sum)']
```
change this.  And that's not the error message with the documented principal value one that *should* diverge.

```
(%i12) integrate(1/x^3,x,-1,3);
Principal Value
(%o12) 4/9
```
Two more data points of no surprise.

```
sage: maxima_eval(([max_integrate],[sr_to_max(SR(a)) for a in [sin(x)*sin(x/3)/x^2, x, 0,oo]]))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError: ECL says: Divergent Integral
sage: ([max_integrate],[sr_to_max(SR(a)) for a in [sin(x)*sin(x/3)/x^2, x, 0,oo]])
([<ECL: $INTEGRATE>], [<ECL: ((MTIMES) ((MEXPT) $X -2) ((%SIN) ((MTIMES) $X ((RAT) 1 3))) ((%SIN) $X))>, <ECL: $X>, <ECL: 0>, <ECL: $INF>])
```
Not sure what is going on here; maybe a missed translation?

Nils, do you think that line 88 in `maxima_lib.py` could conceivably be responsible for these?

```
ecl_eval('(defun principal nil (error "Divergent Integral"))')
```
I don't really understand what's going on with that line.  Otherwise I don't see how we could be getting something different, though.

You can replace it by this to get closer to the behaviour "throw an error if Maxima wants to print "Principal Value" and do not alter the behaviour otherwise:

```
ecl_eval('(defun principal nil (cond ($noprincipal (diverg)) ((not pcprntd) (merror "Divergent Integral"))))')
```
It fixes the example in this report.

However, when you go and take a look in `defint.lisp` there are some very dodgy `(setq pcprintd t)` statements in there. Essentially what they are doing there is suppressing the printing of the "Principal Value" message. I hope those pieces of code have established that taking a principal value integral is indeed undeniably the thing to do ...

I think it's defensible to simply patch maxima_lib with this line. We're depending on maxima for integration anyway, so if their handling leads to errors, we can just point "upstream".

Various uninformed remarks...

So is this even really a principal value situation?  I mean, the `1/x^2` component and then taking each pos. or neg. piece can make the integral from 0 to oo be like an alternating series, in effect...  For what it's worth, W|A doesn't even mention PV, just returns `pi/6`.

There is some interesting numerical instability in integration when you go really far out, not surprising I guess with that crazily oscillating of an integrand.

```

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A8):

> So what happens, are we replacing their handling of principal with ours in certain cases?

See the link to defint.lisp above. You can see the original definition of `principal` there:

```
1096 (defun principal nil
```
definition of a function with an empty argument list

```
1097   (cond
```
this is the main conditional in lisp. It's like a switch statement

```
($noprincipal (diverg))
```
If the variable `$noprincipal` (the $ is a name-mangling convention in Maxima that this is the maxima variable `noprincipal`) has a non-nil value, then call [diverg](http://maxima.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=maxima/maxima;a=blob;f=src/defint.lisp;h=f3d50f01a067ea821884b85f1b290b129fc1b8cb;hb=HEAD#l761) and return its value (it actually doesn't return but throws an exception or raises an error)

```
1098         ((not pcprntd)
```
If pcprntd has a nil (=false) value:

```
1099          (format t "Principal Value~%")
```
Print a message

```
1100          (setq pcprntd t))))
```
and set the variable to `t` to ensure that the message only gets printed once per integral evaluation.

> I wouldn't mind a quick tutorial in what your function (`defun` defines one, right?) actually *does* :)

All that the new version does is replacing the `format` print statement by an error-raising statement. We don't set `pcprntd` because that would not have any effect anyway.

The nasty bits happen in [line 1144](http://maxima.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=maxima/maxima;a=blob;f=src/defint.lisp;h=f3d50f01a067ea821884b85f1b290b129fc1b8cb;hb=HEAD#l1144) and
[line 1157](http://maxima.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=maxima/maxima;a=blob;f=src/defint.lisp;h=f3d50f01a067ea821884b85f1b290b129fc1b8cb;hb=HEAD#l1157) where pcprntd gets set to `t` (note the dynamical scoping here! This is different from what would happen in python. Outside the `let` statement, `pcprntd` reverts to its old value again).

For some reason, Maxima decides to evaluate the integral in this report via a principal value integral somewhere, but apparently the writer of the code is confident that this is the right thing to do and suppresses the printing of the `Principal Value` warning.

With the patch, we accept that if Maxima wasn't going to print the message, things should be safe and no error should be raised.

> So is this even really a principal value situation?  I mean, the `1/x^2` component and then taking each pos. or neg. piece can make the integral from 0 to oo be like an alternating series, in effect...  For what it's worth, W|A doesn't even mention PV, just returns `pi/6`.

The fact that the patch makes a difference shows that maxima *does* do something that triggers calling `principal` and that only happens in
[line 625](http://maxima.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=maxima/maxima;a=blob;f=src/defint.lisp;h=f3d50f01a067ea821884b85f1b290b129fc1b8cb;hb=HEAD#l625) and

Replying to [@nbruin](#comment%3A13):
> I think KDC thinks the patch itself is OK and I think his doctest is good and informative, so I think we can give this a positive review between the two of us. Anybody in favour of more red tape should feel free to revert this, though. 

I'm not yet qualified to understand the original patch, but I too have reviewed the doctest. I confirmed the result in Mathematica, and ran the long test suite after applying both patches.
