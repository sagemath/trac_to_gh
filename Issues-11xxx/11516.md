Karl-Dieter Crisman (at Sage Edu Days 3) points out that the documentation of the zeta method for a modular integer ring is a bit misleading.

```
sage: R = IntegerModRing(11)
sage: R.zeta(5, all=True)
[9, 5, 4, 3]
```
All well and good, but the documentation says:

```
       Return an n-th root of unity in self if there is one, or raise an
       ArithmeticError otherwise.
    
       INPUT:
    
       * ``n`` -- positive integer
    
       * ``all`` -- bool, default: False.  If True, return a list of all
         n-th roots of 1.
```
The point is that "n-th root of 1" should be "primitive n-th root of 1".

<a id='comment:2'></a>It only returns the primitive roots:

```
sage: R = IntegerModRing(13)
sage: R.zeta(4, all=True)
[8, 5]

This is even true in corner cases:

```
sage: R = IntegerModRing(13)
sage: R.zeta(1, all=True)
[1]
sage: R = IntegerModRing(1)
sage: R.zeta(1, all=True)

<a id='comment:9'></a>Checking this again... as of 7.4beta0, the docstring has "primitive" now, but my earlier example is still broken:

```
sage: R = IntegerModRing(8)
sage: R.zeta(2, all=True) # should return [3, 5, 7]
[7]
```
The issue is actually in the generic `zeta` function in `src/sage/rings/ring.pyx`, where this call gets handled. The key extract is:

```
    f = self['x'].cyclotomic_polynomial(n)
    if all:
        return [-P[0] for P, e in f.factor() if P.degree() == 1]
```
which has no hope of returning the right answer if the ring is not an integral domain.

One reasonable option would be to make this function raise an exception if `is_integral_domain` returns False. After all, the concept of a "primitive n-th root of unity" isn't really used when the ring is not a domain.
