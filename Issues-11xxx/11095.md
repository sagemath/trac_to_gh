Besides implementing BMSS, I cleaned a bit `ell_curve_isogeny`, moving the algorithms that do not work in any characteristic to a new module `ell_isogeny_char_zero`. In my view, only the `EllipticCurveIsogeny` class and Vélu/Kohel formulae should remain in ell_curve_isogeny` in the end.

BMSS runs significantly faster than Stark's, and works for slightly larger characteristics, I thus set it as the default choice. I haven't produced any serious benchmarks, but I will if the reviewers ask me to.

I like this a lot, and it is a good idea to start moving stuff out of the huge isogenies file.  I am planning to do the same for the isogenies of small degree code --currently the genus 0 prime degrees 2,3,5,7,13 and the others which can occur over Q.  Kimi Tsukazaki and I are working on extending that to all the ell for which `X_0(ell)^+` has genus 0.

I tested this against 4.7.rc1 and had some doctest failures.  I expect these will be easy to fix.

I realized that my code for BMSS fails when the isogeny has strictly positive valuation at x, which happens for example when the origin is a point of order 2 and the isogeny has odd degree as in the code below

```
sage: from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_isogeny_char_zero import *
sage: E = EllipticCurve([-1,0])
sage: E2 = EllipticCurve([-3^4,0])
sage: E.isogeny(kernel=None, codomain=E2, degree=9)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: The two curves are not linked by a normalized isogeny of degree 9
sage: isogeny_Stark(E,E2,9)
x^8 - 4*x^6 + 10/3*x^4 + 4/3*x^2 + 1/9
sage: isogeny_BMSS(E,E2,9)
x^7 - 4*x^5 + 10/3*x^3 + 4/3*x
```

The fix is easy, I hope I'll have time to send a revised patch next week.

1. I'm confused by the `ValueErrors` raised by `isogeny_kernel`.

```
ValueError, "The two curves are not linked by a normalized isogeny of degree %s"%ell
```

First of all, the comment "or a non-sense polynomial if no such isogeny exists" (line 110) is inconsistent with the documentation of `isogeny_BMSS`. Which of the two is correct?

Second, the test "`ker_poly.degree() != ell-1`" (line 113) implicitly assumes that there is only one possible degree for a normalized isogeny. It would help future developers to have a comment explaining that this is always the case (it is, isn't it?)

Third, why is the test "`not check`" there in the Stark case (line 100)? Could `isogeny_Stark` return non-sense polynomials just like you say `isogeny_BMSS` does? Does a non-sense polynomial always imply that no normalized isogeny exist?

2. The word "separable" seems to be missing from the `ValueErrors`

3. I noticed that (with the default options) the function `isogeny_kernel` will first test if algorithm equals "Stark", "stark", "Starks", or "starks", before detecting that it actually equals "BMSS". It may speed things up by epsilon to put the most-used case first. (this is not the reason for "needs work")

Not if you do not mind replacing the codomain with an isomorphic curve, since composing with a scaling map ([u,r,s,t]=[u,0,0,0]) multiplies the constant by u (or maybe `u^-1`) so u can always be chosen to make the isogeny normalised!

It would help future developers to have a comment explaining that this is always the case (it is, isn't it?)\n\n\nMarco is right: the \"normalized\" requirement is very strong. Indeed if two isogenies are normalized for the same models, then they are solution to the same differential equation with the same initial conditions. In characteristic 0, this means that their power series expansion at infinity is the same, which I think should be enough to prove that there is only one such isogeny.\n\nIn positive characteristic, this means that the power series are equal at least up to the (p-1)/2-th term (which is the limit up to which the BMSS algorithm can compute the solution). I am less sure about unicity in this case, but I am inclined to think that only one isogeny of degree less than p/4 will satisfy the condition (this is true for multiplication-by-m maps, at least).\n\nAs an example, take the multiplication maps by 1 and by p-1 on a curve E: they are both normalized for the models (E,E), which implies that the expansion at infinity of the multiplication-by-(p-1) map is x + O(x^((p-1)/2)).

Replying to [mstreng](#comment%3A13):
> 
> First of all, the comment "or a non-sense polynomial if no such isogeny exists" (line 110) is inconsistent with the documentation of `isogeny_BMSS`. Which of the two is correct?


I fixed the docs to be more explicit on this, hope it is clear now.

> 
> Second, the test "`ker_poly.degree() != ell-1`" (line 113) implicitly assumes that there is only one possible degree for a normalized isogeny. It would help future developers to have a comment explaining that this is always the case (it is, isn't it?)


Marco is right: the "normalized" requirement is very strong. Indeed if two isogenies are normalized for the same models, then they are solution to the same differential equation with the same initial conditions. In characteristic 0, this means that their power series expansion at infinity is the same, which I think should be enough to prove that there is only one such isogeny.

In positive characteristic, this means that the power series are equal at least up to the (p-1)/2-th term (which is the limit up to which the BMSS algorithm can compute the solution). I am less sure about unicity in this case, but I am inclined to think that only one isogeny of degree less than p/4 will satisfy the condition (this is true for multiplication-by-m maps, at least).

As an example, take the multiplication maps by 1 and by p-1 on a curve E: they are both normalized for the models (E,E), which implies that the expansion at infinity of the multiplication-by-(p-1) map is x + O(x^((p-1)/2)). Of course the BMSS algorithm will refuse to compute the second map, because it has degree (p-1)^2 > p/4.

As a final remark, if we know the right (u,r,s,t) we can normalize the models, as John suggests. But, except for the case of scalar multiplication maps, computing such an isomorphisms is very expensive. I'm working on this in another patch.

> Third, why is the test "`not check`" there in the Stark case (line 100)? Could `isogeny_Stark` return non-sense polynomials just like you say `isogeny_BMSS` does? Does a non-sense polynomial always imply that no normalized isogeny exist?


Maybe not, but these algorithms all tend to have some special cases which were not considered in the literature and which yield false answers. So why not test as long as the test comes for free (we have to compute the square root anyway).

> 2. The word "separable" seems to be missing from the `ValueErrors`


The constraints on the degree imply that if such an error is returned, then p does not divide `ell` (otherwise a `ZeroDivisionError` is returned instead), thus no unseparable isogeny of degree `ell` exists either.

> 3. I noticed that (with the default options) the function `isogeny_kernel` will first test if algorithm equals "Stark", "stark", "Starks", or "starks", before detecting that it actually equals "BMSS". It may speed things up by epsilon to put the most-used case first. (this is not the reason for "needs work")

> ps. The patch bot seems to have understood that you only want the second patch.


Yes, but it also used to mention a failure that I was not able to reproduce. It seems to be down now, anyway.

Thanks Peter for resurrecting this old ticket of mine. I have no objections to the file renaming.

Back in 2011 Marco Streng and I bypassed Trac and discussed this ticket via mail. I feel I must make an update to explain why the ticket was set to needs work back then.

Essentially, Marco was unhappy about the documentation for two reasons.

1. It wasn't clear whether Stark's algorithm could fail silently. I just had a look at it. It can. I'm commiting the necessary modifications to the docs.

2. The docstring talks about THE normalized isogeny of degree at most `degree`, but it wasn't immediately clear that this isogeny should be unique. Marco himself gave the proof of unicity. This is explained in the note in the docstring of `isogeny_BMSS`.

I can't find any other issue in my mail logs, so it is good to go for me.

I've been experimenting a bit and it seems to work well.  Would it be possible to make `EllipticCurve.isogeny()` and `EllipticCurveIsogeny` accept `algorithm='bmss'`?  In the following example I wanted to compute a 20-isogeny between two elliptic curves over a quadratic field (knowing a priori that such an isogeny exists).  Trying `E.isogeny()` gives a `NotImplementedError` and it seems that I have to import `isogeny_kernel`:

```
