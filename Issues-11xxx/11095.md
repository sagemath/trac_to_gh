Keywords: cdef public attribute documentation

This ticket seems related with #9976, so, I put the participants from there as Cc.

Assume that a cdefined class, such as `sage.modular.modsym.heilbronn.HeilbronnCremona`, has a `cdef public` attribute, such as `p`. Then, this attribute appears in the docs, even though it is not a method and has no docstring:

```
sage: print sage.modular.modsym.heilbronn.HeilbronnCremona.p.__doc__
None
```

Without #9976, the documentation looks like [here](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/modular/modsym/heilbronn.html#sage.modular.modsym.heilbronn.HeilbronnCremona.p): The attribute p is mentioned without documentation.

With #9976, a generic docstring is shown, which is not very informative:

```
x.__init__(...) initializes x; see x.__class__.__doc__ for signature
```

I suggest to change sage_autodoc.py so that a cdef public attribute is only shown if it has a doc string.

Depends on #9976
