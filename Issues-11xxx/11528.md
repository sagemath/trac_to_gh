I ran all tests and they passed.  I give it a positive review except for a suggested change to is_core that I believe is shorter and faster:

```
def is_core( self, k ):
    return not k in self.hooks()
```
This changes the behavior for k=0 since the original version raises a "ZeroDivisionError: Integer modulo by zero" while this new version simply returns False.

I.e., just the commit message? (It's not clear to what you replied, Nicolas just removed the hint on the repo I previously added, for whatever reason.)

Yup.

The testbot error log was not clear, but hinted that it had not found
the patch on the ticket page. So I removed the comment after the
"Apply ..." in case this was the cause. Apparently the buildbot now
applies the patch (with test failures however). I do not know whether
this is just a coincidence or not.

That was my guess...

So the buildbot deletes some previous logs? The last "apply failed" is from August.

The last statement I recall regarding what the patch-/buildbot inspects was that it doesn't look at the ticket's description at all (but in contrast Jeroen's tools do; just as mine). Haven't kept track on that though.

The doctest errors are quite funny; at least one caused by the buildbot itself, most (or all?) of the others caused by "no space left on device". :D

But it IMHO doesn't make much sense to test patches still against 4.7.1 anyway.

Sorry, I was out of e-mail contact today. Given the last message, I suppose everything was ok and merged? I only changed the very first line of the patch to

#11700: New methods concerning cores in Partitions

by an e-mail request from Nicolas.
