yes, thanks.

Okay, convinced :)

Please let me know which version of Sage you used to make this patch.  Could you try upgrading to [sage-4.7.1.alpha2](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.7.1.alpha2/), export the patch again and let me know whether the issue persists (it should be fixed)?

Hi jdemeyer:

I used Sage 4.7 to make the patch. I took your advice and upgraded to sage-4.7.1.alpha2 and retested the patch. The two erroneous lines disappeared. The new patch is up.

Thanks.
