NP at all.
 
> * I evaluated the annihilating polynomials at ``self`` in the doctest to get 0. Is that what you mean?


yes, thanks.

> * I think 'dependence' is the more conventional math noun: 'algebraic independence' and 'algebraic dependence'.


Okay, convinced :)

> * Yes, it would be better to return the entire elimination ideal (did it now), which is what i meant to do initially but got sidetracked into making a tailored version for my bigger project.


Positive review.

Your patch has two erroneous lines on top:

```
Detected SAGE64 flag
Building Sage on OS X in 64-bit mode
```

Please let me know which version of Sage you used to make this patch.  Could you try upgrading to [sage-4.7.1.alpha2](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.7.1.alpha2/), export the patch again and let me know whether the issue persists (it should be fixed)?

Hi jdemeyer:

I used Sage 4.7 to make the patch. I took your advice and upgraded to sage-4.7.1.alpha2 and retested the patch. The two erroneous lines disappeared. The new patch is up.

Thanks.
