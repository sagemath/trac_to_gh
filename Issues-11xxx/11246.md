flint-1.5.0.p5 does not build on a recent Cygwin (1.7.9)
due to Cygwin having ulong defined as type in 
/usr/include/sys/types.h. This results in

```
gcc -std=c99 -I/home/dima/sage-4.7.alpha5/local/include/ -I/home/dima/sage-4.7.a
lpha5/local/include  -fPIC -funroll-loops   -O2 -c ZmodF_mul.c -o ZmodF_mul.o

nt)
In file included from /usr/include/stdio.h:46,
                 from ZmodF_poly.h:40,
                 from ZmodF_mul.c:34:
/usr/include/sys/types.h:101: error: duplicate `unsigned'
make[2]: *** [ZmodF_mul.o] Error 1
```
note that 
/usr/include/sys/types.h:101
is 

```
typedef unsigned long   ulong;          /* System V compatibility */
```

ulong is a macro in flint, defined in two places, for some reason:
in flint.h and in profiler.h

Cause:

The header inclusion order in ZmodF_mul.c 
does #include ZmodF_poly.h (which includes stdio.h, which in turn 
includes sys/types.h containing the typedef for ulong) 
after ZmodF.h, which includes flint.h containing #define ulong 
Thus the typedef is nuked, and there is no way around it with the 
given header order. 

The 1st bug is in ZmodF_mul.c, which does not need to include ZmodF.h 
at all, 
as it is included in ZmodF_poly.h 

The 2nd bug like this is in mpn_extras.h, where the inclusion of 
flint.h is not needed 
---and this nukes ZmodF_mul-tuning.c 

The 3rd bug like this is in ZmodF_poly.c, which needs to include 
neither flint.h nor memory-manager.h

FLINT_ASSERT is defined in flint.h and flint_heap_alloc is defined in memory-manager.h.

I think the given fix compiles only because the headers are picked up via other inclusions. 

A fix that seems to work for me is to guard the inclusion of system headers as follows:

#undef ulong
#include <stdlib.h>
#define ulong unsigned long

Note that the flint-1.6 release notes say:

* Better Cygwin support

though I don't know if this particular issue is fixed or not. It may be only be an issue with more recent Cygwin than what I tested with.

It would really help if flint did not use "ulong" and switched to using "unsigned long". The use of "ulong" is likely to cause many problems - it is even a reserved word in C#. Just Google "ulong" and you will find other systems using this, so using "ulong" is likely to cause issues.

PS. I must have missed an #include somewhere when I tried this. Taking special precautions before doing an #include<std*.h> appears to be a last resort...

Anyhow, the patch I have here works, and it removes unneeded
duplicate inclusions from the code, rather than adds more lines. What are objections to it?

One would rather rename ulong to Ulong. (or even to oolong :-))

I'd rather ask why a preprocessor macro is used in place of a typedef, which ought to be preferred over #define whenever possible, IMHO.

1.6 suffers from the same issue:
 

```
...

make: *** [ZmodF_mul.o] Error 1

```

to get that far when compiling, I needed to remove quite a bit of
"error: redeclaration of `i' with no linkage" in QS/mp_linear_algebra.c and QS/mp_sieve.c

E.g:

```

QS/mp_linear_algebra.c:329: error: previous declaration of `i' was here
```

the reason for that is rather than writing 

```
 for (unsigned long i = 0; ...
```
which restricts the scope of i to the for loop, you write 

```
 unsigned long i;
 for (i = 0; ...
```
there, in many places. Well, maybe some weird compiler can accept this, but gcc does not...

Interestingly, I was just chewed out on another ticket for having cut some lines in that file down to size!   It's true that the new lines are just a little over that, apparently.

You mean 

```
+for j in `ls patches/*.patch` ; do  
+   patch -p0 < $j 
+done 
```
Do we ever do error checking for these?  Most spkg-install files seem to have just "cp" or "patch".   What should be added?

We do of course check exit codes (or indirectly the success) of `tar` and other commands that can spectacularly fail...

Fortunately, we now use `patch` rather than `cp`, which at least spits out warning or error messages in case upstream and `patches/*` get out of sync (or someone made another mistake), but these messages are easily missed - even by a reviewer, which can lead to all kinds of obscure errors or misbehavior *any time later*, so we should IMHO check `$?` there.

`bash`'s not Python, where we would (hopefully) get a nice, instructive traceback.

> Do we ever do error checking for these?  Most spkg-install files seem to have just "cp" or "patch".   What should be added?


(`cp` will almost always succeed, so that's more or less irrelevant, meaning a different situation.)

From the "proof-of-concept" spkg (Sphinx):

```sh
# Apply patches
cd "$CUR/src"
echo "Patching Sphinx..."
for p in ../patches/*.patch; do
        patch -p1 <$p
        success "Error applying patch $p"
done
```

(The `success` function exits `spkg-install` whenever `$? != 0`.)

It would IMHO also be valid to just accumulate errors and do one check after the loop, e.g.:

```sh
patched_ok=true

for p in patches/*.patch; do
  patch -p0 < "$p" || patched_ok=false  # -p0 is also superfluous btw.
done

if ! $patched_ok; then
  echo >&2 "Error applying the patches to upstream source" # or whatever
  exit 1
fi
```

(Note that doing `ls patches/*.patch` is superfluous and not even robust.)

You can of course at your taste "invert" the logic, i.e. start with `patch_error=false` and set it to `true` in case `patch` returns a non-zero value, then test `if $patch_error; then ...`.

To clear some things up:

- Lines in `SPKG.txt` and commit messages should not be too long.  There is no hard 80 characters limit but more of a subjective "not too long" limit.  In practice I would say <= 120 characters is safe.

The ugly thing with reformatting text is that the diffs usually get hard to read.

I therefore prefer splitting off such changes from *code changes*, to be reviewed separately and independently, since the latter are much more important.

Nevertheless, both kinds of patches can (and IMHO should) live on the same ticket, because documentation tends to get neglected.

I would agree in the case of source code (which you read with your favourite editor), but not documentation that's often just dumped to a terminal (`sage -info ...`, `hg log -v`, or simply `sage: function?`).

Of course one can usually resize the terminal window (perhaps at the expense of redoing the command), but that's quite inconvenient, and there's a reason e.g. newspapers -- and even a lot of blogs -- are typeset as they are: in multiple, rather narrow columns.

Code is somewhat different, also depending on the language and coding style.

Ooops, there's not just a *technical* reason for doing so. That's why I insist on having them in spkg commit messages as well (alternatively, or in addition, the full spkg version).

  Well, I didn't set the ticket to "needs work", though the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced we shouldn't start(?) accepting code that literally sets up traps the next ones touching the spkg can easily step into, with the potential to cause virtually any kind of obscure, hardly backtraceable error or malfunction.

I primarily meant merging tickets with known *newly introduced* flaws or deficiencies, which of course requires some positive review.

(Not fixing old flaws on a ticket is another issue, and heavily depends on the situation, especially the effort to do so, and the cost of delaying other changes already made. Also, spkgs are IMHO different to patches to the rest of Sage.)

No, that Sage on Windows (Cygwin or otherwise) won't happen until we have enough Windows-adept users, but we are unlikely to have many of them until we have a good Sage on Windows that isn't a VM/VB solution, and so on.

The *Patches* section...

I think if you apply them "manually" (i.e. not in a loop, which would be necessary if order matters), there should also be a comment (in `spkg-install`) which issue a specific `patch` commands fixes.

WTF? In whose name, and what will be the commit message?

I'm strongly against "generic" commit messages, even if the tags (with the spkg version / patch level, perhaps ticket number) were complete, i.e. referring to the Changelog. Each Changelog entry is somewhat cumulative, and usually more high-level, while commit messages may be more specific (especially if they consist of more than one line).

So I wouldn't encourage people to not commit their changes.

Also, having multiple commits in the same spkg version is useful (and not uncommon, even by a single developer) if the changes are (perhaps bigger and) rather unrelated.

Then having the last change uncommitted would be a bit inconsistent.

Also, I think `sage -pkg ...` (does *anybody* use that? :-) ) would at least currently reject an spkg with uncommitted changes, which isn't all bad.

IMHO, this discussion just highlights a need to revamp the whole spkg system, for 99% of the standard spkgs, at least.
It would be much better if the whole non-building part of the spkg install is done in a uniform way, by hg, say,
rather than handwritten scripts...

The need for the current spkg system is dictated by the need of some optional parts of Sage, that demand, say, a distribution in an unmodified form. Yet, putting the spkg source under hg is not a modification. Sage can distribute spkg source with the hg tree, and Sage-needed patches as patches to be applied by an spkg-install.

no, that's not true. And in fact sage -pkg should not reject such an spkg, as you want to debug your spkg before committing changes.

The commit message will be the complete `SPKG.txt` entry, so in this case:

```
### flint-1.5.0.p7 (Jeroen Demeyer, 6 July 2011)
 * Trac #11246: remove check for gcc version since we require gcc >= 4.0.1
   for Sage anyway.
 * Use `patch` instead of `cp` for patching the makefile
 * Remove test_gcc_version.sh and the horrible makepatchfiles
 * Check that `patch` succeeded in spkg-install, apply patches at -p1 level
 * Remove obsolete dist/debian directory
```

> Then having the last change uncommitted would be a bit inconsistent.

Well, you can always commit all changes yourself, there is no harm.  I personally prefer not to commit any changes until the spkg is really ready to be shipped.

> Also, I think `sage -pkg ...` would at least currently reject an spkg with uncommitted changes, which isn't all bad.

It does not reject it, it merely notifies the user that there are uncomitted changes.

Well, as I said, I just wouldn't encourage others to proceed like that.

(I know it might sometimes be tedious to undo some changes, but any spkgs advertised on a ticket should IMHO have already all changes committed, at least if it's "needs review". And having multiple, independent patches to an spkg on the ticket for review can be advantageous.)

Can you take into account the (very minor) change for #11547 in that?   The only substantive change is 

```
if [ $UNAME = "CYGWIN" ]; then

I'm btw. still in favour of supporting `~/.sagerc` and perhaps `SAGERC`, not to mention using `SAGE_CC`, `SAGE_CFLAGS` etc. instead of `CC`, `CFLAGS`, since one never knows where the latter come from, meaning if they've intentionally been set [for Sage], and -- more important -- whether they've been set by the user or by some Sage script...)

If I understand you correctly (having the whole upstream tree under revision control), that would heavily increase their sizes.

I'd rather vote for splitting off the whole vanilla source trees (`src/`) and ship them as separate tarballs (perhaps just repackaged with `tar` and `bzip2`), along with cut-down Sage-source only `.spkg` files (preferably with a new extension, say `.spi`).

`sage-spkg` then could take care of the upstream packages, putting their appropriate, corresponding versions into place before calling `spkg-install`, i.e. extracting them into `src/`, such that we would not even have to change anything in the existing `spkg-install` and `spkg-check` files, the Sage part of spkgs.

That way, we could even have a single spkg (or "spi") repository, which would greatly ease working on spkgs and merging changes. Also, this would not only decrease the download size upon upgrades (assuming just Sage's patch level changed, which is often the case), but also the overall traffic when reviewing spkgs, and -- last but not least -- the "new" spkgs, which could then be ordinary Mercurial changesets to simply be applied to the spkg or "spi" repository, could be attached to the tickets and merged like any other changes to Sage, i.e. the library, scripts etc.).

Instead of e.g. `foobar-x.y.z.pN.spkg`, we would have `foobar-x.y.z.tar.bz2` (vanilla upstream), perhaps in `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/upstream`, optionally but preferably a Mercurial repository in `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard` (ignoring `upstream/`), and the stripped-down `foobar-x.y.z.pN.spi` files in `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard`, or even just `foobar-x.y.z.spi` if they are under *central* revision control.

Really? Why? If I look at my current $SAGEROOT/devel/sage/, I have 878Mb, while its .hg is 51Mb. And here the fact that this tree has a long history must be taken into account. A typical spkg tree would be started from a clean history, and keep it for most of the files. So it would be a pretty small increase.

I just ran 'du' command on '$SAGEROOT/devel/sage/', and on '$SAGEROOT/devel/sage/.hg'.

I am not talking about carrying around the whole upstream history, which may or may not be available. If upstream upgrades in a clean patch fashion, then it's easy to import their patches and carry them on. Otherwise we basically would throw the history away, just as we do presently, and start anew.

Either you put `src/` under revision control, or you don't. If you do, then copying a fresh, upgraded upstream tree into `src/`, Mercurial will record the changes relative to the previous version in Sage, whichever that was. And you'd have the same problems with possibly rebasing patches that Sage made to the previous upstream release.

Or did you mean putting `src/` into a *separate* Mercurial repository, to be thrown away upon every upstream upgrade?

I cannot really see an advantage in either way.

I've made a p8 with (only) these changes based on the latest p7 from here and uploaded it onto G**gle code. See #11547 for details in a few minutes; I'll also update #6743 accordingly.
