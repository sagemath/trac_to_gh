This ticket implements a method to compute the hull number of a graph. As it requires to compute many convex hulls, a corresponding hull method is defined too. As computing many hulls is a mess unless you can cache some useful information, these methods are defined inside of a convexity_properties class, which I hope I documented enough `:-)`

If you feel some things are badly named or should be rearranged, please tell me. I thought about this code for a while, and even though it works somehow well I am still not satisfied with it `:-)`

(The file convexity_properties is added to the reference manual, and explains most of what the code does)
