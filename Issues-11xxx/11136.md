The version in sqlite of Sage is 3 years old, so an update is in order. Several recent release have only been bug-fix-releases, so this should be very stable. 

A new .spkg has been placed at

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/sqlite-3.7.5.spkg

Using this, Sage was built from scratch on OpenSolaris 06/2009. All long doctests passed too. But it needs testing on other platforms. 

I've tested this on the following platforms. 
* 32-bit OpenSolaris on x86 (*hawk*) using GCC 4.5.0. Complete build of Sage from the start. All doctests pass. 
* 32-bit Solaris 10 on SPARC (*t2.math*) using gcc 4.5.1 Test of package building only. 
* 64-bit Solaris 10 on SPARC (*t2.math*). GCC 4.5.1. Test of package building only. (64-bit SPARC does not result in a very stable Sage, so many doctest would fail even if sqlite worked perfectly.)  
* 64-bit Ubuntu Linux (*sage.math*) using GCC 4.2.4. Build of package - not complete doc tests, although `devel/sage/sage/graphs/graph_database.py` was tested and passed. 
* OS X 10.6 (*bsd.math*) Build with GCC 4.2.1
