The version in sqlite of Sage is 3 years old, so an update is in order. Several recent release have only been bug-fix-releases, so this should be very stable. 

A new .spkg has been placed at

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/sqlite-3.7.5.spkg

Using this, Sage was built from scratch on OpenSolaris 06/2009. All long doctests passed too. But it needs testing on other platforms. 

I've tested this on the following platforms. 
* 32-bit OpenSolaris on x86 (*hawk*) using GCC 4.5.0. Complete build of Sage from the start. All doctests pass. 
* 32-bit Solaris 10 on SPARC (*t2.math*) using gcc 4.5.1 Test of package building only. 
* 64-bit Solaris 10 on SPARC (*t2.math*). GCC 4.5.1. Test of package building only. (64-bit SPARC does not result in a very stable Sage, so many doctest would fail even if sqlite worked perfectly.)  
* 64-bit Ubuntu Linux (*sage.math*) using GCC 4.2.4. Build of package - not complete doc tests, although `devel/sage/sage/graphs/graph_database.py` was tested and passed. 
* OS X 10.6 (*bsd.math*) Build with GCC 4.2.1

Given this builds on at least the following:

* Operating systems: Linux, OS X, Solaris 10, OpenSolaris & Solaris 11 Express
* CPUs: SPARC and x86
* 32-bit and 64-bit

as well as the fact this version of sqlite has been used on Gentoo Linux for some time, I believe this should be merged.

SPKG.txt has entries:

```
### sqlite-3.6.22  (David Kirkby, March 1st 2010)
### sqlite-3.7.5 (David Kirkby, 6th April 2011)
### sqlite-3.6.19.p0 (Mike Hansen, October 26th, 2009)
```

Suggest order be changed to:

```

### sqlite-3.6.22  (David Kirkby, March 1st 2010)
### sqlite-3.6.19.p0 (Mike Hansen, October 26th, 2009)
```

Tested with 'make testlong' on sage-4.7.alpha3 with sqlite-3.7.5.spkg (built with gcc-4.5.1) on the following skynet
machines:

```
cleo (ia64-Linux-rhel)

eno (x86_64-Linux-core2-fc)
lena (x86_64-Linux-k10-fc)

taurus (x86_64-Linux-nehalem-fc)
sextus2 (x86_64-Linux-netburst-fc)
cicero (x86-Linux-pentium4-fc)
```

All tests passed.

With the change above, I would give this a positive review.
