Hello !

Here is an updated patch, that supports loops. This being said, the custom on Sage's trac server is more to provide a patch yourself if you think a feature you need should be added (and to join the reviewer's patch to the ticket when fitting) `:-p`

to David : I hope you will like this new version. While I was at it, I also looked a bit into random number generation, and ... well.. There was some speedup hidden there too :-)

Can you make the updated version available. So far I still see the "binary" instead of "boolean" line 474 and the "80" line 571.
