```
At [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/d885434ba9c22d66), Jeroen reported a massive regression in elliptic curve computations. The regression was introduced in the transition from sage-4.7.2.alpha2 to sage-4.7.2.alpha3.

It seems that #9138 is responsible, at least for a big part of the regression. With unpatched sage-4.7.2.alpha2, we find

```
sage: E = J0(46).endomorphism_ring()
sage: %time g = E.gens()
CPU times: user 5.54 s, sys: 0.15 s, total: 5.69 s
Wall time: 5.81 s
```
Adding #9138 and its dependency, we obtain

```
sage: E = J0(46).endomorphism_ring()
sage: %time g = E.gens()
CPU times: user 8.72 s, sys: 0.18 s, total: 8.89 s
Wall time: 8.92 s
```

It turns out that much time is wasted for calls to `sage.categories.Category.join` and to `sage.categories.Category.hom_category`.

When caching these two methods, one can reduce the speed difference to something like that (sage-4.7.2.alpha3 plus #11115 plus an experimental patch for the caching):

```
sage: E = J0(46).endomorphism_ring()
sage: %time g = E.gens()
CPU times: user 6.82 s, sys: 0.16 s, total: 6.98 s
Wall time: 7.40 s
```
However, that's still far from good. After caching join and hom_category, there is still too much time spent (according to %prun) for the initialisation of matrix spaces.

It seems that some time is spent for creating a homset, when creating a matrix space. 

In fact, during initialisation, a special map from the basering is created for coercion. That has been introduced in #9138 because otherwise coercion from the base ring to the matrix space is too slow.

However, it might be better to *not* create the coerce map during initialisation. After all, it is a waste of time to create it when eventually it is not used. Perhaps that is what is happening here?

Of course, one wouldn't like to have all the matrix spaces hanging around. But perhaps it is an option to temporarily turn garbage collection off.

However, the computation of `E.gens()` actually requires the construction of many *different* matrix spaces. So, making matrix space creation faster certainly is the best option.

I have attached a preliminary patch, if someone already wants to have a look. I need to do more tests (and run doctests), but up to now it seems that it fixes the regression.

**__Changes for Matrix Spaces__**

Matrix spaces will not make use of the category framework by default. But I introduced a new method that makes them use the category framework after initialisation:

```
            sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ,8)
            sage: TestSuite(MS).run()
            Failure in _test_category:
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            AssertionError: category of self improperly initialized
            ------------------------------------------------------------
            The following tests failed: _test_category
            sage: type(MS)
            <class 'sage.matrix.matrix_space.MatrixSpace_generic'>
            sage: MS.full_category_initialisation()
            sage: TestSuite(MS).run()
            sage: type(MS)
            <class 'sage.matrix.matrix_space.MatrixSpace_generic_with_category'>
```

Minor change: I made `__matrix_class` a lazy attribute.

**__Changes for categories__**

I turn `hom_category` in a cached method - the result is cached anyway, and thus it makes sense to cache as early as possible, in order to reduce the overhead, and in order to benefit from #11115.

I also cache the class method `category_of` in sage.categories.covariant_functorial_construction. According to a commented-out line, caching has been attempted anyway, but since it needs to be a class method, caching has not been possible by simply using a decorator.

**__Vectors__**

I added custom `list()` methods for both integral and rational dense vectors. Here is the speed difference (the timing is with patch attached):

```
sage: v = vector(ZZ,range(100))
sage: %timeit L = v.list()
625 loops, best of 3: 11 ¬µs per loop
# was 17 ¬µs per loop in sage-4.7.2.alpha2
sage: v = vector(QQ,range(100))
sage: %timeit L = v.list()
625 loops, best of 3: 24 ¬µs per loop
# was 27.7 ¬µs per loop in sage-4.7.2.alpha2
```
The difference is small, but one should benefit from it.

**__Doc formatting__**

I corrected some wrong formatting in the documentation of dense integral and rational vectors.

The crucial question: Does it fix the speed regression?

Here are Jeroen's examples from sage-devel.

**__Conclusion__**

#9138 is indeed responsible for all but one regression. The only exception is the test suite for `CrytalOfTableaux`; it has already been argued on sage-devel that it is actually not a regression, since the test suite became much longer by #11183.

The patch from here fixes most regressions. Problematic remain the `EllipticCurve('960d1').prove_BSD()` and the `E.change_ring(GF(p)).abelian_group()` tests.

I managed to implement the new coercion model for libsingular rings, therefore cc to Martin.

One trick to make that work: One should acknowledge that polynomial rings are unique parents (unless one destroys uniqueness on purpose), thus, the hash can be `id(self)` and `__cmp__` can be identity of objects.

What has hash and cmp to do with the new coercion model? There was a custom `__richcmp__` in the code. It somehow managed to trigger a test for the old coercion model. And unfortunately, if replaces `__cmp__` by `_element_constructor_` then the test for the *old* coercion model raises an exception, even though `_element_constructor_` is supposed to be a tool of the *new* model.

I think that in a different ticket, one can build on top of that and replace the current (and always repeated!) coercion tests on elements by tests that are done *once* for the parent of these elements. That would improve the performance.

Perhaps that was not a very clear explanation. Anyway.

With the new coercion, it becomes possible to avoid the construction of a coercion from the base ring during initialisation.

In addition, I am working on a simplification of the choice of category during `PolynomialRing_generic.__init__`. It uses `sage.rings.categories.Category.join`, but could actually directly construct a `JoinCategory`, since all the additional work in `sage.rings.categories.Category.join` is not needed. Since `join()` eats a lot of time in the benchmarks, I am confident that we will see an improvement.

That's the plan, now I have to do tests...

I have attached a second patch, in which I implemented the ideas sketched above. Doc tests need work (I guess some old tests will need to be rewritten).

There is some improvement in the timings, With sage-4.7.2.alpha3 and both patches applied, I get:

```
sage: %time L = EllipticCurve('960d1').prove_BSD()
CPU times: user 5.01 s, sys: 0.06 s, total: 5.07 s
Wall time: 5.22 s
```
Sage-4.7.2.alpha2 took 4.01 s on that example. Thus, with the second patch, we "only" have half of the regression that we had after the first patch, and only one fifth of the regression without both patches.

The other critical example became:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('389a')
sage: %time test(E)
CPU times: user 15.93 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 15.97 s
Wall time: 16.03 s
```
Sage-4.7.2.alpha2 took 16.73 s. Hence, here we actually have a slight improvement, where we previously had a drastic regression.

I need more tests, but I think that I can now hope to "rescue" #9138.

Still, there is too much time spent on the initialisation of polynomial rings. And the reason seems to be the construction of the parent class of the categories.

A polynomial ring over a finite prime field F belongs to the category of Commutative Algebras of F (by #9138). In order to provide the ring with the correct class (`PolynomialRing_dense_mod_p_with_category` in this case), one needs to have the parent class of `CommutativeAlgebras(F)`. But this involves to know the parent classes of F algebras, F vector spaces, F bimodules, F left modules, F right modules, and rings.

During the elliptic curve computation, F varies. Hence, all the base classes need to be computed over and over again.

I wonder whether it is possible to make the parent class of a category *independent* of the base (here: F) of the category. Then, one could avoid the creation of about 5000 dynamic classes during the elliptic curve computation. I guess that's a question to sage-combinat-devel.

How might this work? Perhaps make the parent class of a category a class attribute: `Algebras(F).parent_class` depends on `F`, but `Algebras(F).__class__.parent_class` would be independent of F. Or perhaps one should better introduce a central cache for the parent and element classes, so that `Algebras(F).parent_class` is just a pointer to `parent_class_cache[sage.categories.algebras.Algebras]`.

Or perhaps one should better introduce a central cache for the parent and element classes, so that `Algebras(F).parent_class` is just a pointer to `parent_class_cache[sage.categories.algebras.Algebras]`.\n\n\nActually that was the original intent; see the discussion around line 240 of category.py: two categories sharing the same inheritance diagram for their parent class would actually share that parent class. The implementation was simple: there was a cache on the dynamic class creation. There are two issues though:\n\n- How to pickle such a class: the only solution I found was to pickle it as Algebras(F).parent_class; but this requires to store \"Algebras(F)\" as part of the parent class, which prevents sharing. Better solutions welcome!\n\n- Even if the above is changed, this would still require the creation of the categories Algebras(F) (and super categories) for all F, which could take some time.\n\n- I had had similar issues with the coercion system with MuPAD (the factoring code was creating zillions of fields, which crowded the coercion graph). So I already thought about modeling simultaneously a bunch of parents/categories having the exact same properties as a single template object (say in the coercion graph). But I did not come up with great solutions yet.\n\n- One needs to be a bit carefull, as the inheritance diagram may depend on F. For example, Algebras(F).parent_class derives from VectorSpaces(F).parent_class iff F is a field.\n\n\nOnce again, I am glad you are working on those category optimizations!\n\nAltogether your proposals look very good. I am just unsure about short\ncircuiting \"Category.join\", but I would need to look more in\ndetail. Maybe we would need to add an abstraction layer in\nbetween. Anyway go ahead with whatever works for fixing #11900, and if\nwe find something better, we can do it in a later patch.",

In order to provide the ring with the correct class (`PolynomialRing_dense_mod_p_with_category` in this case), one needs to have the parent class of `CommutativeAlgebras(F)`. But this involves to know the parent classes of F algebras, F vector spaces, F bimodules, F left modules, F right modules, and rings.

Or perhaps one should better introduce a central cache for the parent and element classes, so that `Algebras(F).parent_class` is just a pointer to `parent_class_cache[sage.categories.algebras.Algebras]`.


Actually that was the original intent; see the discussion around line 240 of category.py: two categories sharing the same inheritance diagram for their parent class would actually share that parent class. The implementation was simple: there was a cache on the dynamic class creation. There are two issues though:

- How to pickle such a class: the only solution I found was to pickle it as Algebras(F).parent_class; but this requires to store "Algebras(F)" as part of the parent class, which prevents sharing. Better solutions welcome!

- Even if the above is changed, this would still require the creation of the categories Algebras(F) (and super categories) for all F, which could take some time.

- I had had similar issues with the coercion system with MuPAD (the factoring code was creating zillions of fields, which crowded the coercion graph). So I already thought about modeling simultaneously a bunch of parents/categories having the exact same properties as a single template object (say in the coercion graph). But I did not come up with great solutions yet.

- One needs to be a bit carefull, as the inheritance diagram may depend on F. For example, Algebras(F).parent_class derives from VectorSpaces(F).parent_class iff F is a field.


Once again, I am glad you are working on those category optimizations!

Altogether your proposals look very good. I am just unsure about short
circuiting "Category.join", but I would need to look more in
detail. Maybe we would need to add an abstraction layer in
between. Anyway go ahead with whatever works for fixing #11900, and if
we find something better, we can do it in a later patch.

Which of the two work-arounds do you mean? The caching (so that the cache already happens when calling `Category.join(L)`, not only when creating the `JoinCategory`)? Or the attempt to directly create the `JoinCategory` during creation of a polynomial ring?

I think the latter is justified by having only few cases: It can be `UniqueFactorisationDomain`, `IntegralDomain` or `EuclideanDomain`, and it can be commutative or not. So, one can directly write down the result, rather than calling the `Category.join(...)` mechanism. Of course, one needs to verify that I wrote it down correctly.

This might induce some quite big caching, since a given join may be
created in many different ways (order of arguments, ...). That being
said, maybe that's not so bad. Also, I need to check how this evolves
with the upcoming "more category constructions" patch. Anyway, I guess
we can wait until we actually meet the issue with that cache, if we
do, before removing it again.

The only potential issue is about the order of the categories in the join. Having everything go through Category.join makes it easier to maintain consistency, and make it evolve if needed.

Before I sleep, just a brief report.

It seems to be perfectly alright if one lets parent and element classes rely on the default pickling of dynamic classes. This alone suffices to have

```
  sage: Algebras(GF(3)).parent_class is Algebras(GF(5)).parent_class
  True
  sage: loads(dumps(Algebras(GF(3)).parent_class)) is Algebras(GF(5)).parent_class
  True
  sage: Algebras(GF(3)).parent_class is Algebras(ZZ).parent_class
  False
  sage: Coalgebras(QQ).parent_class is Coalgebras(FractionField(QQ[x])).parent_class
  True 
```
The latter was mentioned as "todo" in category.py

And:

```
sage: %time L = EllipticCurve('960d1').prove_BSD()
CPU times: user 3.85 s, sys: 0.08 s, total: 3.93 s
Wall time: 4.08 s
```

In other words, the regression for `prove_BSD` disappears!

I certainly need to add some doc tests for the new feature, and also it will probably be needed to fix old tests. But I am confident that I can post a new patch tomorrow, that may be enough to fix the regression completely.

I thought that the join does depend on the order of the input categories. If it doesn't, one could always use frozen sets as key, rather than tuples.

OK. If join changes the order of arguments in future versions of Sage, then we should change the five or six hard-coded categories that my patch uses in the initialisation of polynomial rings.

I suggest to add doc tests of the form

```
sage: P.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: P.category() is Category.join([CommutativeAlgebras(ZZ), UniqueFactorizationDomains()])
True
```
(that should be the answer, but with the current patch it is only the join of `Algebras(ZZ)` with `UniqueFactorizationDomains()`. So, that needs to bee fixed as well.

Having such tests would detect incompatible changes in the order of base categories in the join.

In order to keep patches small, my plan is to provide two patches. The first will be an update of the "polynomial categories and coercion" patch. The second shall deal with parent/element classes of categories, which is a separate issue.

**Concerning the "polynomial categories and coercion":**

__Choice of category__

Replying to [SimonKing](#comment%3A37):
> I suggest to add a function somewhere (perhaps in sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ring.py) that takes the category of the base ring and the number of generators as arguments, and returns the appropriate category of the polynomial ring.


That seems to work fine. Since I directly construct a `JoinCategory` rather than calling `Category.join`, it is a little faster, and it is certainly easier to maintain than the current approach.

__Easier detection of ring structures__

Currently, if one wants to test whether a parent is a Euclidean domain, one has to do `P in EuclideanDomains()`, which boils down to `P.category().is_subcategory(EuclideanDomains())`. That implies the construction of all super-categories of `P.category()` and is thus rather slow.

I guess it would be *much* faster to add parent methods that tell whether the ring has a certain structure, and to simply ask `P.is_euclidean_domain()`.

Similar parent methods should exist for `Fields()`, `Rings()`, `CommutativeRings()` and `IntegralDomains()`.

```
        FIXME:

        - make sure that this is compatible with the python algorithm

OK. Is alpha4 "official", or is it currently an alpha-prerelease only?

However, I think that it should be dealt with on a different ticket, since I don't see how it would help here.

I still see much time spent in `all_super_categories`. I just found that `self.all_super_categores()` does *not* start with `C.all_super_categories()` for C in `self.super_categories()`. That is certainly not very efficient, because it is effectively computing `C.all_supercategories()` repeatedly.

Indeed, it can be improved. And then, the benchmark finally becomes

```
sage: %time L = EllipticCurve('960d1').prove_BSD()
CPU times: user 3.60 s, sys: 0.11 s, total: 3.71 s
Wall time: 4.02 s
```

__Conclusion__

I will not change the order of all_super_categories, and I will not unify the parent classes of different categories - that shall be on a separate ticket.

However, I will 
* make libsingular polynomial rings use the new coercion framework, 
* avoid the construction of a coercion from the base ring at initialisation of matrix spaces and polynomial rings,
* create an external function for choosing the category of a polynomial ring, avoiding the overhead of the `join()` method,
* add parent methods that provide a faster way of determining algebraic structures than the classical `P in CommutativeRings()`
* improve the performance of `all_super_categories()`.

I found a pickling bug for libsingular polynomia rings.

First session:

```
sage: P.<foo,bar> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: save(P,'tmp')
```

Second session:

```
sage: Q = load('tmp.sobj')
sage: P.<foo,bar> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: Q is P
False
sage: Q2 = load('tmp.sobj')
sage: Q2 is P
True
sage: Q2 is Q
False
```

Since I am fixing coercion of libsingular polynomial rings anyway, I'll fix the bug here.

I thought that you had optimized the `in` containment to make it as
fast as a method call? Besides, as far as I remember from previous
discussions, we had agreed on the following:

- X in Fields() would return whether X is already known to be a
  field.

- X.is_field() would return whether X *is* a field, possibly
  launching a costly computation if needed, and possibly updating the
  category afterward

Finally, to do dispatching in category code, the preferred idiom would
be X in Fields(). Roughly speaking, operations on an element depend on
its declared parent, operations on a parent depend on its declared
category.

Cheers,
                            Nicolas

Fortunately, in many cases, the categories to be joined are known up to the base ring. Thus, it is possible to write down `JoinCategory` directly.\n* `C.is_subcategory(C2)` is too slow, since `C.all_super_categories()` is too slow.

In my not-yet-posted patch, I make it a little faster by calling `dynamic_class_internal.f` directly, thus, completely avoiding the `cached_function` overhead. `C.parent_class` should only depend on the base ring when absolutely necessary, but that will be dealt with on a different ticket.",

That's #10667 and needs much more work than this. My aim *here* is to try and find a sufficiently good solution, so that #9138 can be rescued.

It could very well be that some of the changes (e.g. the use of `is_ring`) will be reverted by #10667, and replaced with a better solution. But I simply wouldn't like to wait another couple of months for #10667 to be finished - it would be a shame to postpone #9138 (which happens to be a dependency for #10667) such a long time.

You are mistaken. Please look at the `__contains__` method of `Fields()`. It dispatches to `sage.rings.fields.is_Field`, which dispatches to `P.is_field()`.

Besides, in cases where this is a problem, there is a `proof=False` option for is_field. I would accept to argue that `P in Fields()` should be preserved, because of the difficulty of testing field-ness, and because it is not tested so often.

But `P in Rings()` is tested often and is too slow. X in Rings()` takes an awful lot of time and is one of the four main causes for the regression. Bear in mind what `X in Rings()` involves:
* Calling `Rings()`, which will be faster by #11115 (cached methods), but currently is not cheap. Thus, defining `_Rings = Rings()` once in a module and then testing `X in _Rings` is already an improvement.
* Calling `C=X.category()` - that's relatively cheap.
* Calling `C.is_subcategory(_Rings)`, which is cached. However, in the elliptic curves code, `C` takes around 1000 different values, thus, caching really doesn't help here.
* is_subcategory involves constructing `C.all_super_categories()`. Again, 1000 times in the elliptic curves code. Note that this is because of #9138: Before, C would constantly be `CommutativeRings()`, but with #9138, it is `CommutativeAlgebras(F)` for different fields F.

Note that all_super_categories *__alone__* already takes 2 seconds in the `%time L = EllipticCurve('960d1').prove_BSD()` example! That's a third of the total computation time! The `P in C` idiom is to blame for a part of it, and `Category.join` is to blame for the rest.

It is much faster to define and use a parent method `is_ring` in the category of rings. Moreover, the base class `sage.rings.ring.Ring` also has a method `is_ring`, which is even faster than a method inherited from the category. Here is an example:

```
sage: R = Rings()
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ,3)
sage: %timeit MS in R
625 loops, best of 3: 10.2 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit MS.is_ring() # inherited from the category
625 loops, best of 3: 4.3 ¬µs per loop
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(GF(127))
sage: %timeit P.is_ring() # inherited from the base class
625 loops, best of 3: 392 ns per loop
```

On the long run, I would prefer to have fast containers (see #10667), so that one can do 

```python
O = Rings().objects()
for P in {many different parents with different categories]:
    if P in O:
        ...
```
But for now, I'd prefer a fast work-around.

**__Summary__**

The four main causes for the regression from #9138 are:
* `P in Rings()` is too slow (because it calls `is_subcategory`). #10667 will make it fast, on the long run, but for now it is easier and faster to add a parent method `is_ring` that returns True for rings.
* `Category.join` also involves calling `is_subcategory` too often. Fortunately, in many cases, the categories to be joined are known up to the base ring. Thus, it is possible to write down `JoinCategory` directly.
* `C.is_subcategory(C2)` is too slow, since `C.all_super_categories()` is too slow. I provide a faster (but equivalent) algorithm here.
* `C.parent_class` is too slow. In my not-yet-posted patch, I make it a little faster by calling `dynamic_class_internal.f` directly, thus, completely avoiding the `cached_function` overhead. `C.parent_class` should only depend on the base ring when absolutely necessary, but that will be dealt with on a different ticket.

Ok, yes, I am perfectly fine with using is_ring as a temporary measure
in critical and documented spots.

In general, +1 on getting #11900 in quickly even if it is not perfect,
and thanks for all your work on that!

For the long run, I still would strongly argue for aiming at the "X in
Fields()" idiom, if it can be made fast enough. It is more conceptual
and versatile. But let's not waste time on that now, and postpone the
discussion to your visit in Orsay.

I know: I wrote this backward compatibility hack :-)

What I described was the would-be clean plan for the future.

No it isn't. That's why I asked:

```
sage: M = ModulesWithBasis(QQ)
sage: M.base()
Rational Field
sage: P = M.CartesianProducts()
sage: hasattr(P,'base')
False
sage: P.is_subcategory(M)
True
```

Thus, P has no base, but is a sub-category of a category with base.

> However, we might want to someday model the fact that any ring is a ZZ-module (or maybe not).


That would probably just mean that the category of rings gets a base as well, namely ZZ.

Here are some timings. I compare 
 (1) sage-4.7.2.alpha2, 
 (2) sage-4.7.2.alpha3-prerelease and
 (3) sage-4.7.2.alpha3 with the patches from here.

I am restarting before each new test, so that caches created in one test won't influence the other tests.

__Creation of matrix spaces__

(1)

```
sage: def test():
....:     for i in xrange(5000):
....:         MS = MatrixSpace(QQ,i)
....:         
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 0.38 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.38 s
Wall time: 0.38 s
```

(2) The coercion from the base ring is initialised during matrix space initialisation. That involves a lot of category computations and is slow:

```
sage: def test():
....:     for i in xrange(5000):
....:         MS = MatrixSpace(QQ,i)
....:         
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 1.85 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 1.88 s
Wall time: 1.88 s
```

(3) Since matrix spaces are often considered mere containers, not rings or modules, the first patch does no initialisation of the category during initialisation of the matrix space. There is a method that can do the full category initialisation *after* matrix space initialisation.

```
sage: def test():
....:     for i in xrange(5000):
....:         MS = MatrixSpace(QQ,i)
....:         
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 0.26 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.27 s
Wall time: 0.27 s
```

__Creation of finite fields__

(1)

```
sage: def test():
....:     for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         P = GF(p)
....:         
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 0.60 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.60 s
Wall time: 0.61 s
```

(2) It is slower by a factor of more than 10. %prun reveals that most time is spent in `Category.join`.

```
sage: def test():
....:     for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         P = GF(p)
....:         
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 6.59 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 6.60 s
Wall time: 6.62 s
```

(3) The drastic slow-down observed in (2) has not totally vanished, but I hope this is good enough for now:

```
sage: def test():
....:     for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         P = GF(p)
....:         
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 0.82 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.83 s
Wall time: 0.83 s
```

__Creation of polynomial rings__

(1)

```
sage: def test():
....:     for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         P = GF(p)['x']
....:         P = GF(p)['x','y']
....:         
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 2.41 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 2.46 s
Wall time: 2.53 s
```

(2) Since I am creating polynomial rings over finite fields, part of the overhead comes from what we have seen in the previous example. However, there must be an additional slowness, since the creation of finite fields apparently only contributes 6 seconds.

```
sage: def test():
....:     for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         P = GF(p)['x']
....:         P = GF(p)['x','y']
....:         
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 13.15 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 13.20 s
Wall time: 13.27 s
```

(3) Here, it seems that additional improvements are needed: It is still much slower than without #9138.

```
sage: def test():
....:     for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         P = GF(p)['x']
....:         P = GF(p)['x','y']
....:         
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 6.54 s, sys: 0.08 s, total: 6.62 s
Wall time: 6.68 s
```

__is_subcategory using base__

(1) and (2)

```
sage: L = [CommutativeAlgebras(GF(p)) for p in prime_range(10000)]
sage: A = Algebras(GF(5))
sage: %time _ = [B.is_subcategory(A) for B in L]
CPU times: user 0.95 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.96 s
Wall time: 0.96 s
```

(3) I think an early abort strategy taking into account the base rings of categories makes sense.

```
sage: L = [CommutativeAlgebras(GF(p)) for p in prime_range(10000)]
sage: A = Algebras(GF(5))
sage: %time _ = [B.is_subcategory(A) for B in L]
CPU times: user 0.04 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.06 s
Wall time: 0.06 s
```

**__The Elliptic Curve Tests__**

Recall that only two of them remained critical: `L = EllipticCurve('960d1').prove_BSD()` and the `change_ring(...).abelian_group()` test.

__prove_BSD()__
(1)

```
sage: %time L = EllipticCurve('960d1').prove_BSD()
CPU times: user 3.74 s, sys: 0.11 s, total: 3.85 s
Wall time: 5.05 s
```

(2) Given the timings above, this should be almost entirely due to finite field and polynomial ring creation.

```
sage: %time L = EllipticCurve('960d1').prove_BSD()
CPU times: user 9.37 s, sys: 0.16 s, total: 9.53 s
Wall time: 10.89 s
```

(3) I am not totally happy, yet:

```
sage: %time L = EllipticCurve('960d1').prove_BSD()
CPU times: user 5.63 s, sys: 0.10 s, total: 5.72 s
Wall time: 5.87 s
```

__abelian_group()__

(1)

```
sage: def test():
....:     E = EllipticCurve('389a')
....:     for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         if p != 389:
....:             G = E.change_ring(GF(p)).abelian_group()
....:             
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 16.57 s, sys: 0.08 s, total: 16.65 s
Wall time: 16.77 s
```

(2)

```
sage: def test():
....:     E = EllipticCurve('389a')
....:     for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         if p != 389:
....:             G = E.change_ring(GF(p)).abelian_group()
....:             
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 26.87 s, sys: 0.10 s, total: 26.97 s
Wall time: 27.16 s
```

(3)

```
sage: def test():
....:     E = EllipticCurve('389a')
....:     for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         if p != 389:
....:             G = E.change_ring(GF(p)).abelian_group()
....:             
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 19.29 s, sys: 0.08 s, total: 19.37 s
Wall time: 19.54 s
```

I am not totally happy with the performance, yet. But I think it makes sense that someone has a look at the current snap shot of patches.

Here is `%prun test(L)` for the following test of univariate polynomial ring creation:

```
sage: L = [GF(p) for p in prime_range(10000)]
sage: def test(L):
....:     for K in L:
....:         P = K['x']
....:         
```

ARRGH, I am so unbelievably stupid!! I forgot to apply my second patch! All the timings for (3) above were only with the first patch!!!

On the bright side, it shows that my first patch isn't bad at all.

But I think it still makes sense to add the second as well. Here are the timings with both patches.

__Creation of finite fields__

```
sage: def test():
....:     for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         P = GF(p)
....:         
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 0.68 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.70 s
Wall time: 0.71 s
```

__Creation of polynomial rings__

```
sage: def test():
....:     for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         P = GF(p)['x']
....:         P = GF(p)['x','y']
....:         
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 4.32 s, sys: 0.07 s, total: 4.39 s
Wall time: 4.40 s
```

**__The Elliptic Curve Tests__**

__prove_BSD()__

```
sage: %time L = EllipticCurve('960d1').prove_BSD()
CPU times: user 4.20 s, sys: 0.07 s, total: 4.27 s
Wall time: 4.46 s
```

__abelian_group()__

```
sage: def test():
....:     E = EllipticCurve('389a')
....:     for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         if p != 389:
....:             G = E.change_ring(GF(p)).abelian_group()
....:             
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 18.02 s, sys: 0.09 s, total: 18.11 s
Wall time: 18.16 s
```

In conclusion, the original problem has almost vanished.

Note that with both patches applied, the creation of multivariate polynomial rings is faster than the creation of univariate rings:

```
sage: L = [GF(p) for p in prime_range(10000)]
sage: def test():
....:     for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         P = GF(p)['x']
....:         
sage: def test2():
....:     for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         P = GF(p)['x','y']
....:         
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 2.56 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 2.60 s
Wall time: 2.61 s
sage: %time test2()
CPU times: user 1.22 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 1.24 s
Wall time: 1.24 s
```

The computation time with sage-4.6.2 has only been 1.25 s for test() and 0.67 s for test2(). I doubt that a regression in the polynomial ring creation can be avoided, when we really want category support for polynomial rings. However, I'll do my best to improve it.

PS: I would argue as follows.

* Currently, the category of a finite field is `FiniteFields()`, without quotient ring stuff. So, let's be conservative and keep it.
* Currently, `FiniteField_prime_modn` is both initialised as a `FiniteField` and as a `QuotientRing`. With my patch, for saving time, it is just initialised as a `Parent` with the category of finite fields, and then as a quotient ring, which *overrides* that category. 
* That sounds like a vaste of time. Therefore, `QuotientRing.__init__` should only try to determine a "category with quotient stuff in it" when the category has not been initialised before.

Doing so yields the following  timing (which is even a little better then pre-#9138):

```
sage: def test():
....:     for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         P = GF(p)
....:
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 0.49 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.50 s
Wall time: 0.51 s
```

I'll update my patch in a few minutes.

A very pleasant result:

I was running the doc tests in sage/schemes (which seem to be the most critical). With sage-4.7.2.alpha2 (hence, without #9138), I obtain:

```
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 663.5 seconds
```
With sage-4.7.2.alpha3 (hence, with #9138) and the patches from #11911 and here, I obtain

```
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 597.0 seconds
```

In other words: The regression from #9138 apparently turned into a speed-up!

At Jeroen: You mentioned that you would not review it, because you are not so familiar with coercion. However, my own impression is that coercion plays almost no role in my patches (note that "new coercion for polynomial rings" is *not* part of the patches - it will be moved to a different ticket).

I am impressed, but not really surprised! The category code (and related) had not been fine tuned, and Simon is getting ever more an expert at that :-)

New timings using the same test files as before.  Timings are best-out-of-3 wall times.  "baseline" is actually sage-4.7.2.alpha3 minus various patches (#11587, #9138).  "sage-4.7.3.alpha0" is a *preliminary* version of sage-4.7.3.alpha0, including the new PARI (#11130) and MPIR (#8664).

This is **some** slowdown noticable in some tests, but it's not clear whether it is real, as there is quite some variation of runtime with some of these tests.

Hi Jeroen,

I understand your results that cyclomat.sage, elltest2.sage and J0_46_disc.sage are fine, while ellbsd.sage and elltest1.sage remain problematic. 

I did five runs for each of the problematic tests, with sage-4.7.2.alpha2 and sage-4.7.2.alpha3+patches.

**__Conclusion__**

I see a rather small slow-down in the first test, when comparing sage-4.7.2.alpha2 with "baseline+#9138+#11900"; it is smaller than the regression that you observe. 

I can not confirm the slow-down that you observe in the second test: Here, I actually find a slight speed-up.

My setting is different, as I replace "baseline+#9138+#11900" with "sage-4.7.2.alpha3+#11900". Just to be on the safe side, here you see what I was working with:

```

This ticket is related with #11935. There, the time for creation of parent and element classes of categories over different base rings is avoided. With the patches from here and the second of the two patches from #11935 applied to sage-4.7.2.alpha3, I find:

The result with the first patch from #11935 (one has to pick one of the two patches) is similar. That shows how much speed up is still possible with a clever usage of categories. But the methods used there go beyond what I am doing here - that's why I opened a separate ticket.

FWIW: Here is an example that should show that the regression is fixed.

I tested `./sage -t devel/sage/sage/schemes/`. I obtain the following total running times:

* With sage-4.7.3.alpha0: 621.9 seconds
* plus #9138:  665.2 seconds
* plus #11900: 595.4 seconds        

```
sage: (621.9-595.4)/621.9
0.0426113523074449
sage: (621.9-665.2)/621.9
-0.0696253416948063
```
So, the 7% regression from #9138 has been turned into a 4% speed-up.

We discussed this patch quite some with Simon. One of the issue that
came up is whether it was ok to replace the nice idiom `X in Fields()`
(or friends) with `X.is_field()` when time is critical. I consider
that those two idioms have different semantic: `X in Fields()` means:
do we already know that `X` is a ring (that is, X.category() is a
subcategory of has Fields()), whereas X.is_field() may launch an
expensive computation to detect whether X is actually a field or not.

The change was motivated by the fact that, in may important cases, ``X.is_field()``
is much faster than ``X in Fields()``:

```
    sage: R = QQ['x']
    sage: %timeit R.is_field()
    625 loops, best of 3: 442 ns per loop
    sage: %timeit R in Fields()
    625 loops, best of 3: 18 ¬µs per loop
```

However, after experimenting together, we found out that the
difference can most likely be made not so significant.
The patch I just attached is a good step in that direction.
Simon is currently experimenting with an implementation of
Cython methods within Python classes.

Hopefully, with that patch or some variant thereof, the changes ``X in
Fields()`` -> ``X.is_field()`` in trac11900_category_speedup.patch can
be reverted while still solving the original regression.

Cheers,
                          Nicolas

Hi Nicolas, it seems that your "singleton" patch does not contain the pyx file.

By the way, since is_subcategory is used by `__contains__`, I would somehow prefer to not cythonise `__contains__` but cythonise `is_subcategory` instead.

Anyway. Since the change concerns "speedup for category framework", the new stuff shall remain on *this* ticket. Do we agree on that?

Of course, after cythonising is_subcategory, I need to change my patches from #11943 and #11935 as well. In particular #11935 will be tricky, because the idea of "testing subcategories via subclasses of the parent class" will not work if parent classes are shared.

I see your point.

However, one would need to use the subcategory_hook: in `x in
Rings()`, the is_subcategory that is called is that of the category of
x, not of Rings(). So altogether it might be not as fast as when
cythonizing __contains__. Also, since the optimized code for
__contains__ is small, I can live with the tiny code duplication due
to the "manual inlining of is_subcategory" in __contains__.

Definitely.

> Of course, after cythonising is_subcategory, I need to change my patches from #11943 and #11935 as well.

Ah, I see, you are thinking of cythonizing is_subcategories via
parent_class for *all* categories. Hmm, I haven't yet made up my mind
about this. Unless it brings a clear general improvement (and not only
for the specific regression this patch is about), shalle we not postpone

OK.

I don't know if we can do the change for Fields, though. Fields has a special `__contains__` method, and I don't know if #9138 has really been strong enough to make it possible to use the default `__contains__` instead.

Design question:

Apparently you suggest to implement a subclass of Category, so that Rings and Fields and so on inherit form this class rather than from Category. The other approach we discussed was to define cython functions and plug these functions into methods of python classes. I suggest that we do a couple of benchmarks, to see what's fastest.

You write that the Category_singleton uses an optimized class call. It is indeed slightly faster than the usual classcall, as it seems:

```
sage: from sage.categories.category_singleton import Category_singleton 
sage: class MyRingsSingleton(Category_singleton): 
....:     super_categories = Rings.__dict__['super_categories'] 
....:     
sage: MR = MyRingsSingleton()
sage: MR
Category of my rings singleton
sage: %timeit MyRingsSingleton()
625 loops, best of 3: 5.28 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit Rings()
625 loops, best of 3: 6.92 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit MyRingsSingleton()
625 loops, best of 3: 3.39 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit Rings()
625 loops, best of 3: 6.92 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit MyRingsSingleton()
625 loops, best of 3: 3.38 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit Rings()
625 loops, best of 3: 7.02 ¬µs per loop
```

I don't know why the first "timeit" for `MyRingsSingleton` is so match slower than the other two runs.

Yes, that's definitely the intention if we decide to go for this
approach. At this point, it's just an experiment, so I did not bother

:-)

One can expect more progress by:
- cythonizing ConstantFunction
- cythonizing ClassCallMetaclass.__classcall__

This probably should eventually be generalized to a Singleton subclass of UniqueRepresentation.

I changed `Rings(Category)` into `Rings(Category_singleton)` (but then had to remove the `rings_contains` function in the pyx file, by cyclic import).

First, because of your optimisation of the classcall, one has

```
sage: %timeit Rings()
625 loops, best of 3: 3.42 ¬µs per loop
```
Second, one has

```
sage: R = Rings()
sage: P.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: P in R
True
sage: %timeit P in R
625 loops, best of 3: 1.38 ¬µs per loop
```

Using `PyType_IsSubtype` from sage/ext/python_type.pxi, one comes down to 1.08 ¬µs.

You use a lazy class attribute not only for the classcall, but also for the containment test. If one writes the containment test directly as a method (recall: We are here in a cython file!), one has 1.53 ¬µs. So, to my surprise, the lazy class attribute trick works well also for performance!

Using a similar approach for computing the hash works as well. Namely, for a singleton class, it should be fine if the hash of the (single) instance is not id of the instance but id of the class. With the following code

```python
cdef class hash_c(object):
    cdef long n
    def __init__(self, cls):
        self.n = id(cls)
    def __call__(self):
        return self.n

class Category_singleton(Category):
    ...
    @lazy_class_attribute
    def __hash__(cls):
        return hash_c(cls)
```
I obtain

```
sage: %timeit {R:1}
625 loops, best of 3: 695 ns per loop
```
Without that trick, it is 1.46 ¬µs.

Do you mean "combine the four patches into one"? Or are there ideas concerning singleton that we discussed (for *this* ticket; I know that we had further ideas for other tickets) and are not included in the singleton patch yet?

I succeeded to save yet another bit of time: Use the fact that the argument of `__contains__` should be a `CategoryObject`, or it is no object in a category.

Moreover, I found that it is both easier and slightly faster to use `ConstantFunction` for the `__hash__`. 

And finally, I tried to get rid of the custom `__contains__` method of Fields(). It should all use categories by now.

Current timings are:

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ,2)
sage: P.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: RC = Rings()
sage: FC = Fields()
sage: F3 = GF(3)
sage: %timeit Rings()
625 loops, best of 3: 2.04 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit Fields()
625 loops, best of 3: 2.08 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit MS in RC
625 loops, best of 3: 726 ns per loop
sage: %timeit MS in FC
625 loops, best of 3: 793 ns per loop
sage: %timeit F3 in RC
625 loops, best of 3: 667 ns per loop
sage: %timeit F3 in FC
625 loops, best of 3: 671 ns per loop
sage: %timeit {FC:1,RC:2}
625 loops, best of 3: 1.37 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit hash(FC)
625 loops, best of 3: 352 ns per loop
```

The patch still needs work: Documentation needs to be written, and tests need to pass (I didn't try yet). But of course you can already see whether you might like the result.

For the record: With the latest patches, one gets some doctest errors, but they seem managable:

```

        sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/categories/category_singleton.pyx # 1 doctests failed
```

Concerning timings, I find with sage-4.7.2+#9138+the stuff from here the following results for the benchmarks that I posted five weeks ago. By "vanilla sage", I mean sage-4.7.2.alpha2 unpatched (copying the timings from above):

__Creation of Matrix spaces__

It is as with the previous patch versions, hence, faster than vanilla sage sage (0.38 s cpu):

```
sage: def test():
....:     for i in xrange(5000):
....:         MS = MatrixSpace(QQ,i)
....:
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 0.25 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.26 s
Wall time: 0.26 s
```

__Creation of finite fields__

It is faster than with the previous patches. Even better, it is now faster than vanilla sage (0.60 s cpu), which has not been the case with the previous patches:

```
sage: def test():
....:     for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         P = GF(p)
....:
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 0.53 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.53 s
Wall time: 0.53 s
```

__Creation of polynomial rings__

It is slower than vanilla sage (2.41 s cpu), but a bit faster than what I had with the patches 5 weeks ago (4.32 s CPU):

```
sage: def test():
....:     for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         P = GF(p)['x']
....:         P = GF(p)['x','y']
....:
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 3.92 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 3.97 s
Wall time: 3.98 s
```

**__The two critical elliptic curve tests__**

Recall that the following two were most critical and were the reason for creating this ticket:

```
sage: %time L = EllipticCurve('960d1').prove_BSD()
CPU times: user 3.96 s, sys: 0.08 s, total: 4.04 s
Wall time: 4.25 s
```
That's about as fast as vanilla sage (CPU time went up a bit, wall time went down a bit)

```
sage: def test():
....:     E = EllipticCurve('389a')
....:     for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         if p != 389:
....:             G = E.change_ring(GF(p)).abelian_group()
....:
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 16.53 s, sys: 0.14 s, total: 16.67 s
Wall time: 16.72 s
```
Again, that can very well compete with vanilla sage (16.57 s cpu, 16.77 s wall).

**__TODO__**

Instead of `P.is_ring()`, define `_Rings = Rings()` and test `P in _Rings`. Nicolas, please tell whether I forgot further things todo on this ticket.

Some of the errors are due to the fact that still some fields are not initialised as fields. For example: Laurent series rings.

```
sage: P = QQ[['x']]
sage: F = Frac(P)
sage: F.is_field()
True
sage: F.category()
Category of rings
```
So, here is yet another case of a parent whose category should better be properly initialised.

<a id='comment:7'></a>
Most doctest errors are easy to fix. So, let us discuss the errors for polynomial quotient rings.

I guess polynomial quotient rings are the reason why `is_field` and the custom implementation of `sage.categories.fields.Fields.__contains__` (which does call `is_field`) have originally been introduced: It is often a waste of time to test *during initialisation* whether a polyonomial quotient ring is a field or not.

By the way, `is_field` is currently not cached, but of course should be.

So, what shall we do? Perhaps this is one of the cases where we don't want to fully initialise the category during `__init__`?

I would argue as follows:

* If we do `Q in Fields()` for a polynomial quotient ring Q, then currently (that's to say: before my patch) `Q.is_field()` is called. In other words: Currently, `Q in Fields()` does trigger a potentially expensive computation, but that computation is not done during initialisation.
* Our aim is to get rid of the custom `Fields.__contains__`. Since `Q in Fields()` currently triggers a potentially expensive test, it should be OK if this is also done in future.
* When using the default `Category_singleton.__contains__` for `Fields()`, then `Q in Fields()` involves calling `Q.category().parent_class`. Hence, `Q.category()` could be the right spot for triggering the field test.

__Suggestion__

During `__init__`, a polynomial quotient ring should be initialised as an object in the category of commutative algebras (not rings, as it is now). Moreover, polynomial quotient rings should have a custom `category()` method, different from the one inherited from `CategoryObject`.

If `Q.category()` is called, then it shall be tested whether Q is a field. If it is, then the category initialisation is repeated with the correct category.

__Implementation__

For that purpose I'd implement a new method (perhaps called `_refine_category(self, category)`) for category objects: `P._refine_category(C)` will change the original category into its join with `C`.

After using this method, the custom `Q.category()` method would override itself by the usual one. In other words, I imagine something like the following for polynomial quotient rings:

```python
import types
def category(self):
    if self.is_field():
        self._refine_category(Fields())
    cat = CategoryObject.category(self)
    self.category = types.MethodType(CategoryObject.category, self, CategoryObject)
    return cat
```

Hmm. This will be more difficult than I thought: There are lots of `is_field` methods in Sage. Apparently some of them are not cached. It would probably not be feasible to have a custom `category()` method in all cases.

What could one do instead?

I see the following options:

1. We could remove the custom `__contains__` method and restrict ourselves to fixing the case of `PolynomialQuotientRing` in the way I indicated. After all, this is the only case of failing doctests.
2. We could remove the custom `__contains__` method and the category stuff for all parents with an `is_field()` method.
3. We could preserve the custom `__contains__` method of `Fields()`, but ensure that the potentially time-consuming additional tests are cached. Instead of caching all `is_field()` methods (there are quite many), I suggest to use a cache on the function `sage.rings.field.is_Field`. Namely, this is what is really called in the custom `__contains__` method.

I think the first solution is not really a solution. The second is too much for this ticket. The third seems fine to me, though. What do you think?

In more detail: We introduce the `_refine_category()` method to `CategoryObject`. We impose a cache on `sage.rings.field.is_Field`. In `sage.rings.field.is_Field`, we use `_refine_category()` on those rings that were found to be a field.

Since `is_Field` is cached, the `_refine_category()` method will be called at most once, and `sage.categories.fields.Fields.__contains__` will also be faster because of the cache.

What I now did: `Fields.__contains__` uses a helper that compares parent classes (the same that is used by `Category_singleton`). If that fails, then `is_field()` is called. If it turns out to be a field then the category is updated.

Without the singleton patch:

```
sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
sage: Q = P.quotient(x^2+2)
sage: Q in Fields()
True
sage: _Fields = Fields()
sage: %timeit Q in _Fields
625 loops, best of 3: 21.1 ¬µs per loop
sage: isinstance(Q, Fields().parent_class)
False
```
It is so slow, because `Q.category()` gives the wrong answer, thus `is_Field` must be called, hence, `Q.is_field()` is called, and it is not cached.

With my experimental (not yet published) patch, we would get

```
sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
sage: Q = P.quotient(x^2+2)
sage: isinstance(Q, Fields().parent_class)
False
sage: Q in Fields()
True
sage: isinstance(Q, Fields().parent_class)
True
sage: _Fields = Fields()
sage: %timeit Q in _Fields
625 loops, best of 3: 662 ns per loop
```

In other words: In the first place, Q is not initialised as a field. But if `Q in Fields()` returns true (which is because of calling `is_Field`) then the category of Q is refined. Hence, the next time of calling `Q in Fields()` the shortcut of Category_singleton can be used.

What do you think?

There is something wrong with Category_singleton: It cant' be subclassed.

```
sage: class Test(Rings):
....:     pass
....:
sage: T = Test()
sage: T
Category of rings
```

In other words, making `__classcall__` a lazy class attribute won't work, since subclasses need a different `__classcall__`.

Or do you see a mechanism that allows for subclassing?

The problem occurs if one makes `EnumeratedSets` inherit from Category_singleton, since `DeBruijnSequences` subclass enumerated sets.

I still need to thing about the rest. For that issue, maybe Category_singleton should define __classcall_private__ instead of __classcall__ (see ClasscallMetaclass for the difference)?
Hmm, no, that probably won't work since we want to subclass Category_singleton. I assume the wrong thing is that DeBruijnSequences subclasses EnumeratedSets, where the intention probably was to be a subcategory.

Probably.

Another possibility: `Category_singleton.__classcall__` should be a usual class method, but store the unique instance in an attribute (say, `_inst`) of the class - or, to be precise, in the dictionary of the class. Then, we could do something like

```python
class Category_singleton(Category):
    @staticmethod
    def __classcall__(object cls):
        try:
            return (<dict>cls.__dict__)['_inst']
        except KeyError:
            inst = Category.__classcall__(cls)
            cls._inst = inst
            return inst
```

Then, I get

```
sage: from sage.categories.category_singleton import Category_singleton
sage: %timeit S=Category_singleton()
625 loops, best of 3: 2.13 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit S=Singleton()
625 loops, best of 3: 2.07 ¬µs per loop
```

So, the timing seems ok, and it is subclassable:

```
sage: class Test(Singleton): pass
....:
sage: Singleton()
Category of singleton
sage: Test()
Category of test
```

We don't. Subclassing a singleton means that it is not a singleton.

I think a big fat warning in the docs should be enough.

It might be reasonable.

I think we do want that enumerated sets form a singleton. I really don't see why de Bruijn sequences are not simply copying the `_call_` method from the enumerated sets.

Category_singleton() won't pass the TestSuite since it contains abstract methods. I think this is enough.

Especially since the copy can easily be done with something like:

```
class DeBruijnSequences
    ...

    _call_ = EnumeratedSets.__dict__['_call_']
```

Feel free to postpone that (making EnumeratedSets a singleton+fixing de BruijnSequences) to a later patch. Though.

I need to check what exactly is the use case for their _call_ method. Maybe a candidate for CategoryMethods in the long run.

Can it use a method of one class for another class that is not a subclass?

You are right that it should be a use case of category methods (IIRC these are methods that are inherited by subcategories).

Yup: unlike EnumeratedSets._call_, EnumeratedSets.__dict__['_call_']
is the original Python *function*, before it was transformed into a
method of EnumeratedSets. Not the nicest idiom on earth, but the trick
works ...

And here is why it is a mess.

`PolynomialQuotientRingElement` has, of course, a `_mul_` method. But when one defines the element class of a polnyomial quotient ring, then this `_mul_` method is OVERRIDDEN by the category stuff, namely by `_mul_parent`. That must not happen.

The culprit is `__init_extra__` in sage.categories.magmas, which does:

```
        def __init_extra__(self):
            """
                sage: S = Semigroups().example("free")
                sage: S('a') * S('b') # indirect doctest
                'ab'
                sage: S('a').__class__._mul_ == S('a').__class__._mul_parent
                True
            """
            # This should instead register the multiplication to the coercion model
            # But this is not yet implemented in the coercion model
            if (self.product != self.product_from_element_class_mul) and hasattr(self, "element_class") and hasattr(self.element_class, "_mul_parent"):
                self.element_class._mul_ = self.element_class._mul_parent
```

In other words, an EXISTING AND PROBABLY OPTIMIZED _mul_ is overridden by some generic slow stuff. So, I have to find out why this line is executed (it shouldn't).

I have updated my last patch. I added some documentation, including a big fat warning concerning subclasses of subclasses of Category_singleton. In addition, I make sure that using Category_singleton *directly* does not destroy the cache of its subclasses. And I make polynomial quotient rings use categories.

However, it is not "needs review" yet, because I still have to remove the use of `is_ring` and `is_field`, and also I will eventually produce a combined patch.

It is frustrating. I thought it should all be fine by now, but no: Several errors.

It used to work fine before I replaced the use of "is_...". So, now I am wondering: Should one perhaps use a general mechanism for singletons similar to what I do for fields?

That's to say, if one has a category "Category of <name>s", then it should on the one hand provide a method "is_<name>" that constantly returns true, and on the other hand the `__contains__` method should try whether some "is_<name>" method exists for the parent, and act accordingly (thus, refine the category of the parent if the parent turns out to be commutative).

I fixed the "when to override _mul_" logic.

Also, I fixed some instances of a very bad phenomenon: There are many parents that inherit from classes such as `sage.rings.ring.Field` or `sage.rings.ring.CommutativeRing` -- but then they only call `ParentWithGens.__init__`!

For example, consider `CFF.__init__`. Before #9138, we used to have a custom `Field.category()` method, but I think there are only very rare cases in which `CategoryObject.category()` needs to be overridden. Moreover, #9138 made `Field.__init__` initialise the category. But that won't help if we have subclasses of `Field` that are not calling `Field.__init__`. That is so annoying!

According to `search_src('ParentWithGens\.__init__')`, in order to really fix all issues, we'd still have to look at

```
tensor/differential_forms.py:110:        ParentWithGens.__init__(self, SR, \

rings/complex_interval_field.py:144:        ParentWithGens.__init__(self, self._real_field(), ('I',), False, category = Fields())
rings/infinity.py:472:        ParentWithGens.__init__(self, self, names=('oo',), normalize=False)
rings/infinity.py:783:        ParentWithGens.__init__(self, self, names=('oo',), normalize=False)

This should go on a different ticket, that I am opening in a minute. Here, I'll just fix enough of these cases so that doc tests pass.

Meanwhile I wonder whether that change shouldn't better be put on a different ticket. Namely, using the meet instead of the current algorithm (recall: The algorithm used in _category_for_hom was used before, I merely factored it out) actually would change things.

Namely, the meet may return a join category. But the current algorithm for determining the category for a homset will not return a join category, unless the categories of both parents coincide.

Example:

```
sage: Algebras(QQ)._meet_(Category.join([Fields(), ModulesWithBasis(QQ)]))
Join of Category of rings and Category of vector spaces over Rational Field
sage: PA = Parent(category=Algebras(QQ))
sage: PJ = Parent(category=Category.join([Fields(), ModulesWithBasis(QQ)]))
sage: H = Hom(PA,PJ); H
Set of Homomorphisms from <type 'sage.structure.parent.Parent'> to <type 'sage.structure.parent.Parent'>
sage: H.category()
Category of hom sets in Category of rings
sage: H.category().base_category
Category of rings
```

Using the meet would be a non-trivial change that probably has little to do with a speedup. So, better move it to another ticket, isn't it?

I am not so sure. If I remember correctly, factoring out and using cached method on it does provide a speed-up, and so does contribute to the purpose of this ticket.

Thanks for all your work! It sounds good from your description. I'll try to review the patch by the end of this week.

Ah sorry, one more thing I should have though about earlier: all the Finite* categories will be refactored in the upcoming 10963, where will inherit from something else. To avoid a lot of trivial rebasing, do you mind if we postpone their singletonification to that later ticket?

If you agree, let me know if you prefer to strip those hunks out of the patch yourself, or let me do it.

Well, you really did 95% of the work and I would like you to be credited accordingly. If that was a research paper, I would be at best in the acknowledgement section. I suggest instead to:

* Add myself as an author in Category_singleton.pyx (so that I take the blames for what's broken in there) in my reviewer patch.
* Remove myself from the author list for this ticket.

Indeed. There, my only contribution was to add some documentation and raise an error that makes Category_singleton safer to use.

OK. But I thinkt this should really be a reviewer patch. Please make sure that you start with the most recent version of my patch -- the version that already includes most of what you did in the "review-nt" patch.

And I wouldn't mind to have the "`FiniteBla`" stuff be usual categories for now, even though eventually they shall be singletons as well.

I am looking forward to your reviewer patch and will now focus on rebasing #11943 and #11935.

I have been through the patch, and have a *preliminary* reviewer patch which I am about to upload. There are still a couple things I'd like to do before posting my final reviewer patch:

- Avoid introducing new EXAMPLE instead of EXAMPLES

- use check=True/False instead of category_checked=False/True, for consistency with other similar use cases in Sage

  (please argue if you prefer check_category rather than just check)

- Look again at is_Field, and in particular document the behaviour

- Finish removing some duplication in the __init__ method of Ring/...

- Revert the changes to the FiniteCategories (if that's alright with you, this will be done by stripping the combined patch, rather than undoing the changes in the reviewer patch)

- I forgot what we had discussed about CartesianProducts.base: whether we should drop this method for the time being, or keep it.

By the way: I am not keen on calling one() in the initialization, as
calculating one() may be very costly. In general, in our former
experience with MuPAD-Combinat and Sage, creating elements (with
an_element, ...) early in the initialization has been a repeated
source of problems. When it is about sanity check, this can be
postponed to the TestSuite.

However, this ticket contains a lot of urgent and good stuff, and get
soon into Sage, so this comment is for a later ticket.

I created another followup ticket: #12099

Hi!

I am almost done (updated patch attached; please look at what I did for the __init__ in IntegralDomain and subclasses). However, I have a problem: with sage 4.8.alpha2 on Ubuntu Oneiric, with the two patches:

```
9138_flat.patch
trac11900_category_speedup_combined.patch
```
I am getting a lot of segmentation faults that I don't get without those patches. See the attached log (not: it is actually the log with my patch on top, but I am getting at least the same segfault in sage.structure.element without my patch; I'll post an updated log tomorrow morning).

Any clues?

Nicolas, could you try again with sage-4.8.alpha3?

Namely, I get

```
$ ../../sage -t sage/structure/element.pyx                                                    sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/structure/element.pyx"
         [5.4 s]

All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 5.5 seconds
```
with

With the setting described in my previous post, I get

```

The following tests failed:

That seems doable. I will try to solve it, update my patch probably tomorrow (needs to be rebased anyway), and then it will hopefully be solved.

Both our patches need to be change. Namely, I need to rebase mine because of #9562 and you need to modify yours, because it introduces the two errors that I indicated in the previous post.

First error: By my patch, `_value` is a cdef attribute of constant functions, thus, one can not access it in a doc test. Therefore, I had changed the corresponding doctest. But your patch re-introduces that test.

So, please remove the hunk

Argl, I don't manage to compile alpha3 on my laptop. I sent a mail on sage-release, but I have no idea how much time this could be. Sorry, but I am stuck now.

In case you have a bit of spare time, the quickest would be for you to take over. What needs to be done:

- remove the chunk about ConstantFunctions in my reviewer patch
- fold in my reviewer patch in yours
- fix the trivial doctest failure mentionned above
- remove all chunks in the resulting patch about Finite*
- CartesianProducts.base: did not we decide to remove it? I don't remember; do as you feel appropriate
- EXAMPLE:: -> EXAMPLES::
- There might be a couple `base_checked` options left after my patch; change those to the standard check=
- Check that all tests pass

And then a last quick check from met, and that will be good to go!

Cheers!

I don't understand this one. Do you mean, I shall remove doctest stuff such as

```
+        sage: Category.join((Modules(ZZ), FiniteFields()), as_list=True)
+        [Category of modules over Integer Ring, Category of finite fields]

```

or also this:

```
-class FiniteCoxeterGroups(Category):
+class FiniteCoxeterGroups(Category_singleton):
```
and

```
-class FiniteCrystals(Category):
+class FiniteCrystals(Category_singleton):
```
?

I think we said that it should be fine for base_ring at least. But I think we also said that this ticket should work stand-alone, and resulting messy code will be taken care of in #11943 and #11935.

Let's see what breaks when I remove that method.

Sorry, I produced rather many `EXAMPLE::`s.

The doc tests aren't finished, but I observed several errors that are due to not having the `base()` method for Cartesian products.

So, I'd prefer to keep `base()` in, so that it works, and then take care of the problem in a nicer way in #11943 or #11935.

And please, tell me what the problem is with the "Finite*" stuff, and to what extent I have to change things: Only new doctests that use "Finite*", or should I also not use `Category_singleton` on "Finite*"?

Best regards,

Simon

Ok, keep it!

It is *only* about not using `Category_singleton` for Finite* stuff, since those will be refactored soon anyway, so we might as well not create a conflict for nothing.

Thanks!

Attachment [trac11900_category_speedup_combined_Finitesingleton.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket11900/trac11900_category_speedup_combined_Finitesingleton.patch) by @simon-king-jena created at 2011-12-05 15:57:24

I have attached two patches. Both of them combine the ideas of Nicolas and myself. The `base()` method is left in; this shall be taken care of at #11943 (I'll mark it as "todo" there, if it hasn't already been done).

With each patch (plus #9138), all doctests pass when starting with sage-4.8.alpha3. I was of course reading Nicolas' patches before including them, and I give his contribution a positive review.

For the record, I repeated all benchmarks that were discussed here. The main data are obtained with *not* using Category_singleton for Finite*. The timings with using Category_singleton and the timings with sage 4.6.2 are also given, namely in the comments.

```

sage: L = [CommutativeAlgebras(GF(p)) for p in prime_range(10000)]
sage: A = Algebras(GF(5))
sage: %time _ = [B.is_subcategory(A) for B in L]
CPU times: user 0.06 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.06 s

```
sage: v = vector(ZZ,range(100))
sage: %timeit L = v.list()
625 loops, best of 3: 11.7 ¬µs per loop  # 12.1 ¬µs
# 4.6.2: 16.4 ¬µs
sage: v = vector(QQ,range(100))
sage: %timeit L = v.list()
625 loops, best of 3: 23.5 ¬µs per loop  # 23.8 ¬µs
# 4.6.2: 24.5 ¬µs
```

The following is still not good, but I think #11935 will solve that problem:

```
sage: def test():
....:     for p in prime_range(10000):
....:         P = GF(p)['t','x','z']
....:         
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 2.84 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 2.89 s
Wall time: 2.90 s    # 2.97 s
# 4.6.2: 1.22 s
```

Since the timing are not decisive in one direction or the other, I
vote for [attachment:trac11900_category_speedup_combined.patch] which
reduces the risks of conflicts with #10963. I have just been through
all of it, and it is good enough to go.

Positive review! Thanks for all your hard work!

PS for the release manager: I haven't run myself the tests since alpha3 segfaults on my Ubuntu 11.10 box.

PS for Simon: Just a remark for next time: in a patch which is likely to conflict
with other patches lying around on the same topics, please refrain
from doing syntactical improvements (like EXAMPLE -> EXAMPLES) in
chunks where nothing else is changed otherwise. Also, the workaround
for super(Fields).__contains__ in Fields is a code smell. We should
instead find a way to make our Cython __contains__ behave properly
with inheritance. In a future patch!

I posted a comment at #11943: should I wait until #11943 also gets a positive review in order to merge #9138, #11900 and #11943 together?

In any case, I was planning to postpone these tickets to sage-5.0 (which is scheduled to come after sage-4.8).  The sage-4.8 release is getting close to being finished and I prefer not to merge the big tickets #9138 and #11900 at this point.

Hmm, it would have been really helpful to have a clean base to work on
for the bunch of followup patches. That especially since #9138
requires recompiling most of the Sage library, which makes it very
inconvenient to handle in a patch queue.

I forgot to mention one piece of information: we would need to
integrate this in the Sage-Combinat queue, which is used by people of
varying technical strength. So most of them use the Sage-Combinat
script which is not clever enough to not unapply those patches that
haven't changed.

That probably would work. Or just call it an alpha0 to not change the

It doesn't really matter for the project I'm doing for a living: I can always use these "few" patches (namely #9138, #11900, #11115, #11068, #4539, #7797) privately, even if they are not part of the official distribution.

So having it in sage-5.0.alpha0 or .prerelease seems fine to me.

I just had a look at the ``in Rings()`` code. Maybe Cython should be
complaining when trying to assign None to a variable of a given
type. In any cases, testing for None sounds good for the time
being. On the other hand, I am now puzzled by the code just below
(sorry if I missed it before):

```

    except TypeError: # this is for objects that aren't CategoryObjects 
        try: 
	    return PyType_IsSubtype(<type>(x.category().parent_class), self._parent_class_of_category) 
 	except AttributeError: 
 	    return False 
```

If ``x`` is not a category object, does it make sense to call
x.category()?  Shouldn't this just always return False? Otherwise,
there should be an example in the doctests illustrating this.

Cheers,
			Nicolas

I'm not sure. I think the idea is the same as having a point (in C) point to NULL.

I guess that is the same problem that hit me in #11521: There are objects that aren't `CategoryObject` instances. Any integer is an example.

no, sorry, but since #9562 itself requires to apply other patches, this is too complex
for me. I will wait until 4.8 is out, or maybe until 4.8.alpha5 finishes compiling on

Ah, I see; I had not noticed that GR was equiped with a category method specifically in that example (which I probably wrote ...). Then, I would add this to the documentation ``in Rings()``:

```
Currently, an object is considered *in* a category as soon as it has a
category method returning an appropriate value::

    sage: class A:
    ....:     def category(self): return Fields()
    ....:         
    sage: 
    sage: A() in Rings()
    True

This feature will most likely be deprecated in favor of having the
class ``A`` derive from :class:`CategoryObject`.
```

Maybe even ``is`` rather than ``will most likely be``.

Cheers,
                        Nicolas

By "something changed with the hash between 2.6 and 2.7", I did not mean that the value of the hash changed. What I meant was: Has the way of calling the provided `__hash__` method changed?

In the patch, we turn the hash of a Category_singleton into a lazy class attribute:

```
    @lazy_class_attribute 
    def __hash__(cls): 
        return ConstantFunction(id(cls)) 
```

Is there any change between python2.6 and python2.7 that would affect this code?

The following timings are on a different machine than the timings above, but I think they show that the new hash method is pretty good:

```
sage: timeit("Rings()",number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 981 ns per loop
sage: R = Rings()
sage: timeit("hash(R)",number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 107 ns per loop

The tests at least in sage/categories pass, so, I put it back to "needs review"

I have been through the patch, and it looks good to me. Thanks so much Simon for your hard work on this! It goes far beyond the extra mile.

I am running the tests on my machine. I'll set a positive review when it's done. In case I forget to: if in three hours you have not heard from me, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Just one note: I hope nobody had a pile of patches on top of the matrix/vector space code, since the many little doc improvements there (like EXAMPLES: -> EXAMPLES::) will force quite some rebasing. Please make this in a separate ticket next time, or just leave it to whoever is working on those files.

Cheers,
                            Nicolas

It turns out that, for whatever reason, the category of sets is *not* a unique object on OS X, even though it should be cached as the unique instance of a category singleton.

After starting sage on bsd.math, ignore the error and do

```
sage: from sage.categories.sets_cat import Sets
sage: S is Sets()
False
```

Again, I don't see how OS X could be able to break the cache, but it does.

Good catch Simon!

Given that this issue was non trivial to pinpoint, do you see a way to add a doctest to FastHashClass? Say with a small class returning a large hash that would cause the same overflow on OS X?

With that, and assuming that all test pass, I am happy to put back the positive review.

`FastHashable_class._hash` must be explicitly assigned - i.e., one could try to create an example that would crash on machines where the biggest `Py_ssize_t` does not fit into an `int`, by explicitly assigning such value. `CategorySingleton` assigns `id(cls)` to the attribute `_hash` of the unique instance of `cls` - and `Sets` happens to have an address that doesn't fit into an int.

Hooray, `make ptest` works on bsd.math, and now I am starting `make ptestlong`! However, I think the reviewer should run the test suite as well, just to be on the safe side.

Hi Jeroen,

Is it really a problem to have `cython(...)` in doctests? I have used `cython(...)` in the past, for example when testing introspection (namely, cython creates a temporary file, so that introspection is easy).

Standard (non-optional) tests are allowed to depend on gcc.  I don't know if this is written in stone anywhere, but there have been many such standard tests in the past.  They aren't a problem for buildbots, since they always have GCC installed.  

If nothing else, it is very important to test that calling the compiler from Sage does work.

Really?  I thought the opposite is true.

I know there are some doctests marked

```
# optional -- gcc

When I wrote that line, I was ignorant of the difference in performance. Actually I even thought that `del self.__dict__['element_class']` was *slower*, since I expected that the Python interpreter first needs to translate that statement into an attribute lookup that it subsequently has to do anyway.

Meanwhile I know better and wouldn't write it again in that way.
