Testing for surjectivity of a free module homorphism is probably just fine for vector spaces, but seems to be broken for modules.

```
sage: V = ZZ^2
sage: m = matrix(ZZ, [[1,2],[0,2]])
sage: phi = V.hom(m, V)
sage: phi.lift(vector(ZZ, [0, 1]))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    375             t = self.domain().linear_combination_of_basis(C)
    376         except TypeError:

Version 2 patch tests if a morphism is surjective with the `.is_submodule()` method.  Slower, I guess, but a greater chance of being correct.  An example from mmarco has been added to illustrate the non-unique echelon basis for the image.  The necessity of these changes is detailed on #11579 (and perhaps, see #11553).
