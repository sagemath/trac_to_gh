Testing for surjectivity of a free module homorphism is probably just fine for vector spaces, but seems to be broken for modules.

```
sage: V = ZZ^2
sage: m = matrix(ZZ, [[1,2],[0,2]])
sage: phi = V.hom(m, V)
sage: phi.lift(vector(ZZ, [0, 1]))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
