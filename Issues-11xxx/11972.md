It is much better to create directories using

```
try:
    os.makedirs(PATH)
except OSError....
    # ignore errors if PATH already exists, deal with other errors
    ...
```
than

```
if not os.path.isdir(PATH):
    os.makedirs(PATH)
```
Doing it the first way avoids race conditions.  Doing it the second way can lead to security holes, at least in theory.  The attached patch changes many of the directory-creating code in Sage to do it the first way.

If the code does not behave differently in case a directory doesn't yet exist, we can simply call a shell script which does

```sh
for dir in $DIRS; do
    mkdir -p "$dir" || return 1
done
return 0
```
instead of calling `sage-starts` before running any tests, not just `sage-ptest` (`sage -tp ...`, `make ptest*`).

Of course fixing present code isn't bad either; we could actually do both (and prominently document what should be performed whenever new directories -- similar applies to other files -- are created).

This patch is a very good idea.  But wouldn't the following be better:

```
    try:
        os.makedirs(dir)
    except OSError:
        if not os.path.isdir(dir):
            raise
```

Also, it would be nice to have a failing example, for example

```
sage: sage_executable = os.path.join(SAGE_ROOT, 'sage')
sage: sage_makedirs(sage_executable)
Traceback...
```

Working on sage.math, I edited sage-sage, removing "sage-starts" from the "-tp" section.  Then I did

```
$ export DOT_SAGE=/home/palmieri/.sage-temp/
```
(note the stupid ending slash, required until someone reviews #11924 -- it's an easy review).  Then running

```
$ sage -tp 16 devel/sage/sage/homology
```
produced a bunch of errors about creating various subdirectories of `$DOT_SAGE`.  After applying the patch here,

```
$ rm -rf /home/palmieri/.sage-temp/
$ sage -tp 16 devel/sage/sage/homology
```
ran repeatedly without any errors.
