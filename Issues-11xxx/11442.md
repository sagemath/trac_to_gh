thanks. according to Robert Bradshaw (privately), it is due to the fact that it was not anticipated the exact same patch would be run more than once on the same machine, so it goes with the worst result (which in this case it shouldn't). 

this happened because i had the dependencies of dependencies wrong the first time around, so he manually asked the patchbot to restest the exact same patch.
