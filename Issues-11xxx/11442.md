For me, this is positive review, but I would like that the bot says "green" before going on.

Please add your name to the field Author

This is strange indeed that it stays red. Let us try to restart the bot :

Apply trac_11442-plancherel_measure_partition-pod.patch

thanks. according to Robert Bradshaw (privately), it is due to the fact that it was not anticipated the exact same patch would be run more than once on the same machine, so it goes with the worst result (which in this case it shouldn't). 

this happened because i had the dependencies of dependencies wrong the first time around, so he manually asked the patchbot to restest the exact same patch.
