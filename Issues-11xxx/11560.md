Sympy-0.7.0 has been released on the 28th of June 2011. It is interacting much better with sage than previous release. Term ordering has changed compared to previous release. Only one patch (of which upstream sympy is already aware) is needed to make sympy work nicely with sage.
See [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sympy/XgoLZcIaa3U](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sympy/XgoLZcIaa3U) for discussion about the release and the fix needed for sage.

Sympy-0.7.1 has since been released and should include the patch to sympy-0.7.0 included in the previous spkg. Sympy-0.7.1 is our new target.

the README has the following text

```
How to create a SymPy spkg package:

$ ./get-orig-sources

Then rename the sympy-spkg directory to sympy-0.5.13 (choose the correct
version) and execute from the parent directory:

$ sage -pkg sympy-0.5.13
```
which calls

{{{#! /bin/sh
#execute this script from the same directory, where spkg-install is.
#it will remove the src dir (!) and create a new one instead
ver=0.6.4
wget http://sympy.googlecode.com/files/sympy-$ver.tar.gz
tar xzf sympy-$ver.tar.gz
rm -rf src sympy-$ver.tar.gz
mv sympy-$ver src
```
which I guess would still work once "ver" is put to the right value. But there is an old stale file (which the first one I saw) which pulls on hg

{{{#! /bin/sh
# execute this script from the same directory, where spkg-install is.
# it will remove the src dir (!) and create a new one instead from the
# Mercurial sources of SymPy, located in ~/sympy
ver=0.5.15-hg
dir=`pwd`
cd ~/sympy
./setup.py sdist
cp dist/sympy-$ver.tar.gz $dir
cd $dir
tar xzf sympy-$ver.tar.gz
rm -rf src sympy-$ver.tar.gz
mv sympy-$ver src
```
This one will have to go.

It is not in sympy's source. Sage uses special packages called spkg with sources, patches and build instructions. When you update a spkg you start with the old one.

The current spkg for sympy in sage is here:
[http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.7/sage-4.7/spkg/standard/sympy-0.6.4.p0.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.7/sage-4.7/spkg/standard/sympy-0.6.4.p0.spkg) in spite of the .spkg ending it is just a tar.bz2 file and "tar xvfj" will work just fine on it. The source are usually in a src subfolder and the top folder is build/install instructions + documentation. I am almost done with it. I just have to update one of my patches for something I missed:

```
sage -t -long -force_lib "devel/sage-main/sage/symbolic/expression_conversions.py"
**********************************************************************

Expected:
    exp(x**2) - asin(pi + x)/y
Got:

I didn't notice the re-ordering in asin...

Sorry David but I decided to roll a new one of my own rather than giving you the thumb up. There are are a number of things:
* .p0 is not necessary in this case.
* None of the change I had made in 0.7.0 were in yours, that included a bit of cleaning of the scripts included.
* I made the deleting work for for any python2 install rather than just 2.6, so once we get #9958 in, the spkg doesn't have to be updated.
* I wanted to align what's done in sympy with what leif has done with sphinx in #11665, only delete the old sympy when the build is successful.

At install there is a message about two syntax error in the included mpmath. I didn't take action on these as they are also in the logs of mpmath-0.17 and only concern the tests shipped with mpmath and no functionality is affected.

One step further would be to mirror the work I have done in Gentoo and remove the shipped mpmath to use the version already installed in sage. Of course that means we would have to be careful and then upgrade them in sync.

I tested this on sage 4.7.2.a3 and came up with the following failures:

```
The following tests failed:


        sage -t  -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/calculus/test_sympy.py"
        sage -t  -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/functions/trig.py"

Hi David,

(now I have noticed that wdj is your handle). Did you apply the two patches that the description says you have to apply?
