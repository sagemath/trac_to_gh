```
On my computer I get an unhandled NTL error by just doing:

```
sage: K = GF(1<<16,'a'); L = GF(1<<32,'b')
sage: K.Hom(L)[0]

```
See http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/b9714926d491e905 for further description and potential fix.

I'm setting it as blocker as Simon suggested, feel free to change.

There seem to be some initialization problem with NTL and GF2X.

It seems to me that the problem is solved. However, if the original author (Martin Albrecht, I just cc'ed him) has time to look at you patch, it might be better to know his opinion first.
