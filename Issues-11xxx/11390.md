On my computer I get an unhandled NTL error by just doing:

```
sage: K = GF(1<<16,'a'); L = GF(1<<32,'b')
sage: K.Hom(L)[0]

```
See http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/b9714926d491e905 for further description and potential fix.

I'm setting it as blocker as Simon suggested, feel free to change.

There seem to be some initialization problem with NTL and GF2X.
