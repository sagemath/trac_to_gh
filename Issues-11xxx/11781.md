Since mpz_cmp_ui returns 0 if equality holds, wrong 'if' condition was being used to check if Zmod element was in the right characteristic. Fix this in padic_ZZ_pX_CR_element.pyx and padic_ZZ_pX_CA_element.pyx.

Also, enhancement: allow conversion from element of the residue_field of self (this really only affects unramified extensions).

I don't know why the testbot showed failing tests: all tests pass for me locally.

Looks good.  I'm hoping to redo conversion from the residue in a different way later, but in the mean time this approach works.
