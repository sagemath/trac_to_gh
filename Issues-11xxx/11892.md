#4539 provides g-algebras (non-commutative polynomial rings). However, `sage.libs.singular.function.singular_function` doesn't accept them as input.

Here is an example that works with usual polynomial rings

```
sage: from sage.libs.singular.function import singular_function
sage: P.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: std = singular_function('std')
sage: NF = singular_function('NF')
sage: s_id = singular_function('ideal')
sage: NF(P.2^2,std(s_id(P(0))))
// ** _ is no standard basis
z^2
```
The same example fails with a non-commutative polynomial ring:

```
sage: A.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, 3)
sage: H.<x,y,z> = A.g_algebra({z*x:x*z+2*x, z*y:y*z-2*y})
sage: NF(H.2^2,std(s_id(H(0))))
// ** _ is no standard basis
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/mnt/local/king/SAGE/debug/sage-4.7.2.alpha3-prerelease/devel/sage-main/<ipython console> in <module>()

TypeError: Argument 'parent' has incorrect type (expected sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomialRing_libsingular, got sage.rings.polynomial.plural.NCPolynomialRing_plural)
```

Apart from the misleading warning about the ideal otained from std not being a standard basis, I think the second example should work.

Two approaches: Add `sage.rings.polynomial.plural.NCPolynomialRing_plural` as a special case to `sage.libs.singular.function`, or make the non-commutative rings inherit from the commutative (or probably better the other way around), such that isinstance is happy.


Depends on #4539

It seems that the approach "make `NCPolynomialRing_plural` a subclass of `MPolynomialRing_libsingular`" is easy.

However, that change is so small that I tend to include it where I really need it: In #11878. So, this should be closed.

There is a function called `is_sage_wrapper_for_singular_ring` in the plural patch.
The comment says that it's broken (for whatever reason).
Shouldn't it be the right place for this check?

Looking at the code, I don't understand why it doesn't work.

However, I have to think how to organise work. Things to do involve 

* refactoring sage.rings.polynomial.plural (define rings and elements in separate modules).
* deriving `NCPolynomialRing_plural` from `MPolynomialRing_libsingular`. That would suffice to fix this ticket.
* Implement quotients of multivariate polynomial rings and of g-algebras (#11878)

These three "to-do"s are closely linked.

Do I understand correctly that generally it is better to have several smaller tickets, rather than one big ticket?

Sorry, I do not have the time to check anything in detail now.
I was a little bit surprised that the ticket is still open.
I am sure that the functionality worked before.

You can use a common base class, if you want.
But inheriting the noncommutative ring from the commutative seems absolutely the wrong way to go.
Still abstractions like `is_sage_wrapper_for_singular_ring` seem unavoidable to me.
Thank for all your efforts (very appreciated) and my strong opinion without being able to dive into the topic again.

Cheers,
Michael
