```
The logic of "initializing" `.pc` files exactly once is currently broken, which at the moment "only" causes trouble with libpng if `pkg-config` is installed.

The main reason is that `sage-location` doesn't really check whether a `.pc` file already contains a definition of `SAGE_ROOT`, and unconditionally replaces any occurrences of `$SAGE_ROOT` (i.e., its current value) by `${SAGE_ROOT}`, then adding a (in the case of `update_pkgconfig_files()`, *replacing* the first) line defining `SAGE_ROOT` to have the current value.

The specific problem with libpng (see e.g. #11686, which was originally intended to just again fix a *completely unrelated* issue with the matplotlib spkg) arises since it installs *both* a `libpng12.pc` file *and a symbolic link* `libpng.pc`, the latter pointing to the former. `sage-location` now "initializes" all of Sage's `.pc` files, not checking whether a `.pc` file is just a symbolic link to another one, nor checking whether a file already got modified as mentioned above.

Note that the "initialization" doesn't take place *during* a build, but when Sage is started for the first time, also when e.g. running tests, such that problems with modified `.pc` files occur later, when one tries to (re)install some package(s), which includes *upgrading* Sage.

In the long run, `sage-location` shouldn't (have to) deal with `.pc` files at all, but we IMHO need a **quick fix** until we have a better, more general solution to *all* issues with `pkg-config`. (There are a couple of other issues; cf. for example #10202, #9668, #11687, #11681.) Therefore *this* ticket isn't intended to fix any of the other issues.

I could more or less easily also add that, but it wouldn't help much (on e.g. upgrades) since neither `update_pkgconfig_files()` nor `initialize_pkgconfig_files()` is called later, or more precisely, before we run into potential errors due to multiple definitions.

This is **`initialize`**`_pkgconfig_files()`, not `update_...()`.




> Would it be better to delete this first line (containing `SAGE_ROOT=...`) and then proceed with the rest of the code in the loop?  I guess that these files shouldn't have SAGE_ROOT in them already at this point, but just in case?

As mentioned in the description, I was aiming at a *quick* fix which solves *the issue we have*, not at curing arbitrary corrupted `pkg-config` files.

Also, `initialize_pkgconfig_files()` is only called *once* (unless one messes around with Sage's files as noted for testing the patch).

Nevertheless, any *wrong* definition of `SAGE_ROOT` present during `initialize_pkgconfig_files()` will be corrected in the subsequent call to `update_pkgconfig_files()`.




Since `sage-location` won't have to deal with `.pc` files in the long term anyway, it doesn't make sense to implement sophisticated consistency checks and corrections *there*.

Ah, I see. `update_pkgconfig_files()` is *not* called in the *same* invocation of `sage-location` if `initialize_pkgconfig_files()` was called, since `install_moved()` in this case returns `False`.

So we *could* in principle add

Note that (as I already mentioned elsewhere), on a follow-up or one of the other tickets, we have to (re-)initialize `.pc` files whenever a package [providing a `.pc` file] gets (re)installed (preferably at the end of `sage-spkg`, just like `sage-make_relative` is called), since that's very likely to overwrite our "once" modified / initialized `pkg-config` files, until all spkgs fix their own `.pc` files in their `spkg-install` files (or just call a Sage script / shell function that does that for them from there).

This ticket just fixes the worst cases, and especially the one that currently *always* occurs (since more than a year by the way), namely *duplicate definitions* of `SAGE_ROOT` in a `.pc` file.




If sh*t happens during reinstallation of one or more packages, with the patches here, the user will now be able to repair all `pkg-config` files by simply deleting `$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/sage-current-location.txt`, and afterwards running Sage (e.g. just `./sage -c quit`), without having to check and manually edit any `pkg-config` files, which is certainly not perfect, but an improvement.

Regarding the comment

```
Will have weird effects in case SAGE_ROOT_absolute contains other characters having special
meaning in regular expressions. 
```
You could use [re.escape](http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.escape) to deal with this issue.

In `update_pkgconfig_files`, the code

```
# Delete all previous definitions of SAGE_ROOT:
config = def_pat.sub("", config)
```
The `sub` method only replaces one definition, not all of them.  There should be only one at this point anyway, of course.  Perhaps change the comment to reflect this?

Otherwise, the combined patch looks pretty good to me.  I still have to actually test it...

There seems to be no (measurable) difference (10.9--11 vs. 11 ns with `%timeit -c ...`, and the "largest" `.pc` file we have).  I only tested substituting `${SAGE_ROOT}` by `${SAGE_FOO}` though, i.e., on an *already "initialized"* `.pc` file.  Might differ with longer patterns (i.e. paths) to match, and the original file is slightly larger of course.

Yes, but you don't have to ever look at them, do you?  Just pass them on to `re`.

It seems `sub()` is indeed *slower* than `str.replace()` (about 7:4 in CPU time), so it's not worth using it there instead.  Users won't notice any difference anyway I think; I was just curious.
