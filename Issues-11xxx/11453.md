There is a smarter way to implement this I think. When computing something like 
{{
(f*g).residue()
}} 
you really don't want to multiply out both f and g and then take the residue but rather sum over the coefficients which sum to -1. Is there a way to do this and things like this with the preparser?

Here is a better way :

```
        exp=self.exponents()
        if -1 in exp:
            return self.coefficients()[exp.index(-1)]
        else:
            return self.parent().base_ring().zero_element()
```

Maybe one can do even better..

* The description is not very clear:

```
Return the residue of self.

The residue of a Laurent series in `t` is the coefficient of `1/t`.
```
would be more clear

* Please consider instead the shorter code suggested in comment 2 above.

* The example is not good. 

Indeed an_element may at some point change and return something else. 

It would be better to test on an explicit Laurent series, such as 

```
1/t**2+2/t+3+4*t
```

Hey,

You can access arbitrary `i`-th coefficients from a Laurent series `f` by list accessors `f[i]`. So here's what I believe is the best way by calling `self[-1]`.

Best,
