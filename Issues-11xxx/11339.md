# Ref counting for Singular rings

Python makes no guarantees that destructors are called if circular references are involved. This patch implements an extra Python proxy layer that correctly refcounts Singular rings. In contrast to our earlier code, it will release the singular rings once they are no longer in use. This triggers various issues in Sage/libSingular that are dealt with in the follow-up ticket #10903

# Historic discussion

As [described for the Sage on Gentoo project](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/51#issuecomment-1181259), there is a problem in how parts of sage use `__deallocate__` in their Cython code. I've actually traced an instance of [groebner_strategy.pyx](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/361a4ad7d52c/sage/libs/singular/groebner_strategy.pyx#l134) causing segmentation faults under Python 2.7.

What happens is that the garbage collector invokes the [tp_clear](http://docs.python.org/c-api/typeobj.html#tp_clear) function for the object. Its implementation is provided by Cython, and one of its effects is that every python reference will be set to `None`. A bit later on, [tp_dealloc](http://docs.python.org/c-api/typeobj.html#tp_dealloc) is called and invokes the `__deallocate__` method. By that time, `_parent` is `None`, so accessing `_parent._ring` is a bad idea, and in this case it turns out to be null.

Others have had similar problems before. There are [crude workarounds](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4501938/how-can-c-object-lifetimes-be-correctly-managed-in-cython) floating around. I guess a proper solution would be twaking cython to allow custom code in the tp_clear function. In other words, have a "magic" mehod `__clear__` similar to the magic `__deallocate__`. But I'll wait for comments here first, before taking this to cython upstream. Perhaps people with more experience have better solutions to offer. And I won't mind if you decide to take this to Cython devs yourselves.

The documentation is fairly clear, you are only allowed to touch C data structures in `__dealloc__`: http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/special_methods.html#finalization-method-dealloc

Really, this shows the difference between the C++ and the Python object model. In Python, executing constructors/destructors in derived classes is optional and leaves a lot of freedom to the programmer. Because of the garbage collection you can allocate resources wherever you want. By comparison, C++ is very strict and essentially forces you to use RAII. This is why there is no try/finally in C++.

Having said that, it seems like the cleanest solution would be if Cython would also call the Python destructor `__del__` according to the normal Python rules (why `__clear__`?). Then the Python and C++ object model could just peacefully coexist. The lifetime of a cdef class would be

It's what I perceived to be the hg equivalent of a "bzr send": a file which describes a number of hg commits inclusing metadata, so that other hg users can pull from it.
See hg manual for [unbundle](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/hg.1.html#unbundle) and related documentation.

This patch works fine for me too on sage-on-gentoo with python-2.7.1. I have applied this patch to the vanilla sage-4.7.1.alpha2 (python-2.6.4.p10) spkg and all long tests pass. I have also applied the patch along with the patches and required spkgs in ticket¬†#9958¬†to the sage-4.7.1.alpha2 (python-2.7.1) spkg and all the tests that failed without this patch because of segfaults, i.e.

sage -t ¬†-force_lib "devel/sage/sage/schemes/generic/scheme.py"

sage -t ¬†-force_lib "devel/sage/sage/rings/morphism.pyx" ¬† ¬†

sage -t ¬†-force_lib "devel/sage/sage/rings/homset.py"

now pass.

By that time, `_parent` is `None`, so accessing `_parent._ring` is a bad idea, and in this case it turns out to be null.
 
 Others have had similar problems before. There are [crude workarounds](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4501938/how-can-c-object-lifetimes-be-correctly-managed-in-cython) floating around. I guess a proper solution would be twaking cython to allow custom code in the tp_clear function. In other words, have a "magic" mehod `__clear__` similar to the magic `__deallocate__`. But I'll wait for comments here first, before taking this to cython upstream. Perhaps people with more experience have better solutions to offer. And I won't mind if you decide to take this to Cython devs yourselves.

I agree, that's why I titled the patch "workaround" instead of "solution". I can't think of a way to address this in sage alone, though, as in my opinion a proper solution would entail modifications to cython as discussed above.

Can you explain this in more detail? Why does the parent object being immutable help in keeping the pointer valid? Do you mean that the parent cython object doesn't change it's ring member? That is correct, but not enough to make the approach safe: if you don't keep a reference to the parent python object around, python might decide to garbage-collect that first, leading to a call to the singula function rDelete. I guess that function at least frees the memory, so if you are unlucky, some thread will overwrite the memory that ring points to with completely different data.

Does it depend on other patches that are post 4.7.1.alpha2? The feedback so far is that it doesn't work but I noticed there was some work in singular and rings in alpha3 and alpha4. Would it rely on any of these fixes?

I'm not sure there really is a cycle. I had interpreted the situation in such a way that tp_clear will be called for unreachable objects just in case there might be some kind of cycle between them. So there might be no actual cycle involved at all, or it might be with some other member object. One requirement is that the function does cut all cycles, which should work as the parent shouldn't be referring back to the Gr√∂bner strategy. So by keeping the reference in one direction, we satisfy tp_clear and still manage to finalize things. As a bonus, we ensure their finalization in the correct order.

But I might be completely off target with my above understanding. Someone with intricate knowledge of python, its evolution, as well as cython, might know better.

Until then, someone could add breakpoints to see if the finalizer is executed with my patch in place. Don't have the time just now, but might do it myself in a week or so if you remind me.

The Python docs say "The `tp_clear` member function is used to break reference cycles in cyclic garbage detected by the garbage collector.", so there must have been a cycle involving the `GroebnerStrategy` instance.

I looked a bit at the source and we definitely have cycles ideal<->`GroebnerStrategy`. Both refer to the parent ring, and this explains why `tp_clear` was called on `GroebnerStrategy`. I haven't found a place where the parent refers back to the cycle. In this situation Martin's patch should work as we can get rid of the cycle while the parent has positive refcount. It could be that Python 2.7 got smarter and deletes the parent together with the cycle while Python 2.6 first deleted the cycle and only then noticed that nothing else refers to the parent any more. This would explain why Martin's patch works but my attempt of blindly accessing the ring C structure fails on Python 2.7. 

There is a lot of stuff that could conceivably create a larger cycle involving the parent even though I haven't found one. For one, the parent keeps a reference to the "one" element. Even then, I think it is too dangerous to make the hidden assumption that there are no complete cycles involving the parents. Somebody is bound to trip over this sooner or later.

We got this crash in the parent destructor, but look whats in the element destructor:

```
    def __dealloc__(self):
        # TODO: Warn otherwise!
        # for some mysterious reason, various things may be NULL in some cases
        if self._parent is not <ParentWithBase>None and (<MPolynomialRing_libsingular>self._parent)._ring != NULL and self._poly != NULL:
            p_Delete(&self._poly, (<MPolynomialRing_libsingular>self._parent)._ring)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.

```
It should be double checked with a vanilla install in case it just reveals a problem with my libsingular ebuild.

I didn't realize you could do something like

```
sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage-main/sage/crypto/mq/sr.py -gdb
```
handy...

Since we can even add "-verbose" I should add this bit of output:

```

So it looks like the segfault is after the test has completed, probably when sage is quitting as happened to Steve when he tried to run the test while disabling the garbage collection (before we had any patches what so ever).

I've just completed the testsuite after building vanilla sage-4.7.1.alpha2 from scratch. The patches from tickets #11377, #11244, #9958, #11376 and #10764 along with the patches of this ticket were used to create a patched sage-4.7.1.alpha2 spkg before the build. The results are identical to those reported earlier. There are no segfaults and no Killed/crashed tests.

On my sage-on-gentoo install on x86 in prefix there no segfaults; however, I have one Killed/crashed doctest which I didn't have when using the¬†bug11339a patch.

Ah, this might also explain #5949 then.

The API is as follows: `pXXX` does assume the `currRing` to be set, whereas `p_XXX` does not. However, sometimes there are bugs, i.e. you call `p_XXX` and it crashes unless `currRing` is set.

TBH, I don't like this blanket approach, did you run into specific problems? If so, I'd add a check to those functions instead of hiding bugs by forcing the ring.

The updated polynomials patch fixes another place where potentially the wrong singular ring was used, which would explain the data corruption. Please give it a try!

I'm pretty sure that `p_Normalize` requires `currRing` to be set. In the polynomials destructor, I have

```
    ### If you suspect that the poly data was corrupted, then this is a good way to trigger a segfault:
    rChangeCurrRing(self._parent_ring)
    p_Normalize(self._poly, self._parent_ring)
```
This is useful for debugging because `p_Normalize` will touch all coefficients of the polynomial. The destructor is typically called long after the actual computations so it is very likely that the `currRing` has changed by then. If I reverse the order of the two lines, then I get segfaults all over the Sage library. However, because it relies on the finalization order, they are usually in varying places and often disappear if you just paste the doctest into Sage.

The omalloc error gets triggered by fraction field conversions. If you take out some stuff from ell_curve_isogeny.py then you can start up Sage just fine. I'll attach a patch for debugging purposes.

The omalloc errors appear with or without my patches on this ticket, by the way.

i get the failure in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_curve_isogeny.py on my x86 box same backtrace as [comment:35](#comment%3A35) - sage/modular/modform/element.py still seem to play up, it crashes when I run sage -testall but not when I run it individually. Note that I don't parallel testing on that machine. Wait a minute it crashed after I added -long.

```
sage -t -long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/modular/modform/element.py"
The doctested process was killed by signal 8
         [62.7 s]

The following tests failed:


        sage -t -long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/modular/modform/element.py" # Killed/crashed

```
Unfortunately it disappear again when in gdb:

```

Vanilla or sage-on-gentoo (sog) variety? So far for sog I still only have the sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_curve_isogeny.py crash but nothing else on amd64. 

My linux-x86 box is "decommissioned", I'll look on x86 OS X next.

Haven't had time to try vanilla.

The line number is weird, otherwise doesn't Jeroen merge script add stuff to make sure there is proper metadata in the patch?

Note also that we are playing a "wack a mole" game here. You fix things in one place and suddenly you get a new failure in another. So refreshing Volker's patch is just the beginning....

Aside from the segfaults, with the new patches I get the following additional failurers. The failures "seem" to be associated with the patches in that I don't get them when I use Martin's patches.

Still about sageinspect.py, this is stuff added in #11298, did you apply #11734 to your branch?

I was mistaken, sageinspect.py also fails here on x86 [sage-on-gentoo] with the new refcount patches and the patch from¬†#11734.

With the singular SPKG and the patches (both of them) from #10903 I get no segfaults for the long tests on both x86 and amd64. However, there is one test on x86 that usually takes a very long time that now fails. It may be singular-related.

It looks singular related but it doesn't immediately ring a bell. I'd guess some strategically placed `rChangeCurrRing` would fix the issue, but the problem is to find where to put it.

This patch implements an extra Python proxy layer that correctly refcounts Singular rings. In contrast to our earlier code, it will release the singular rings once they are no longer in use. This triggers various issues in Sage/libSingular that are dealt with in the follow-up ticket #10903\n+\n+# Historic discussion\n+\n As [described for the Sage on Gentoo project](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/51#issuecomment-1181259), there is a problem in how parts of sage use `__deallocate__` in their Cython code. I've actually traced an instance of [groebner_strategy.pyx](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/361a4ad7d52c/sage/libs/singular/groebner_strategy.pyx#l134) causing segmentation faults under Python 2.7.\n \n What happens is that the garbage collector invokes the [tp_clear](http://docs.python.org/c-api/typeobj.html#tp_clear) function for the object. Its implementation is provided by Cython, and one of its effects is that every python reference will be set to `None`. A bit later on, [tp_dealloc](http://docs.python.org/c-api/typeobj.html#tp_dealloc) is called and invokes the `__deallocate__` method. By that time, `_parent` is `None`, so accessing `_parent._ring` is a bad idea, and in this case it turns out to be null.\n \n Others have had similar problems before. There are [crude workarounds](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4501938/how-can-c-object-lifetimes-be-correctly-managed-in-cython) floating around. I guess a proper solution would be twaking cython to allow custom code in the tp_clear function. In other words, have a \"magic\" mehod `__clear__` similar to the magic `__deallocate__`.

+# Ref counting for Singular rings
+
+Python makes no guarantees that destructors are called if circular references are involved. This patch implements an extra Python proxy layer that correctly refcounts Singular rings. In contrast to our earlier code, it will release the singular rings once they are no longer in use. This triggers various issues in Sage/libSingular that are dealt with in the follow-up ticket #10903
+
+# Historic discussion
+
 As [described for the Sage on Gentoo project](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/51#issuecomment-1181259), there is a problem in how parts of sage use `__deallocate__` in their Cython code. I've actually traced an instance of [groebner_strategy.pyx](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/361a4ad7d52c/sage/libs/singular/groebner_strategy.pyx#l134) causing segmentation faults under Python 2.7.
 
 What happens is that the garbage collector invokes the [tp_clear](http://docs.python.org/c-api/typeobj.html#tp_clear) function for the object. Its implementation is provided by Cython, and one of its effects is that every python reference will be set to `None`. A bit later on, [tp_dealloc](http://docs.python.org/c-api/typeobj.html#tp_dealloc) is called and invokes the `__deallocate__` method. By that time, `_parent` is `None`, so accessing `_parent._ring` is a bad idea, and in this case it turns out to be null.
 
 Others have had similar problems before. There are [crude workarounds](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4501938/how-can-c-object-lifetimes-be-correctly-managed-in-cython) floating around. I guess a proper solution would be twaking cython to allow custom code in the tp_clear function. In other words, have a "magic" mehod `__clear__` similar to the magic `__deallocate__`. But I'll wait for comments here first, before taking this to cython upstream. Perhaps people with more experience have better solutions to offer. And I won't mind if you decide to take this to Cython devs yourselves.
