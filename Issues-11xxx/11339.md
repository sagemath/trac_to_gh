# Ref counting for Singular rings

Python makes no guarantees that destructors are called if circular references are involved. This patch implements an extra Python proxy layer that correctly refcounts Singular rings. In contrast to our earlier code, it will release the singular rings once they are no longer in use. This triggers various issues in Sage/libSingular that are dealt with in the follow-up ticket #10903

# Historic discussion

As [described for the Sage on Gentoo project](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/51#issuecomment-1181259), there is a problem in how parts of sage use `__deallocate__` in their Cython code. I've actually traced an instance of [groebner_strategy.pyx](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/361a4ad7d52c/sage/libs/singular/groebner_strategy.pyx#l134) causing segmentation faults under Python 2.7.

What happens is that the garbage collector invokes the [tp_clear](http://docs.python.org/c-api/typeobj.html#tp_clear) function for the object. Its implementation is provided by Cython, and one of its effects is that every python reference will be set to `None`. A bit later on, [tp_dealloc](http://docs.python.org/c-api/typeobj.html#tp_dealloc) is called and invokes the `__deallocate__` method. By that time, `_parent` is `None`, so accessing `_parent._ring` is a bad idea, and in this case it turns out to be null.

Others have had similar problems before. There are [crude workarounds](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4501938/how-can-c-object-lifetimes-be-correctly-managed-in-cython) floating around. I guess a proper solution would be twaking cython to allow custom code in the tp_clear function. In other words, have a "magic" mehod `__clear__` similar to the magic `__deallocate__`. But I'll wait for comments here first, before taking this to cython upstream. Perhaps people with more experience have better solutions to offer. And I won't mind if you decide to take this to Cython devs yourselves.

It's what I perceived to be the hg equivalent of a "bzr send": a file which describes a number of hg commits inclusing metadata, so that other hg users can pull from it.
See hg manual for [unbundle](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/hg.1.html#unbundle) and related documentation.

Replying to [@kiwifb](#comment%3A8):

> For the record this works with sage-on-gentoo with python-2.7.1 so as far as I am concerned it works as advertised so far. I can do a review against a vanilla sage using python-2.6 later this week provided that I get the all clear to go back to work (we got a couple more earthquakes down here - the magnitude 6 one was scary but very few people got hurt). What is the "workaround hg bundle" Martin? I can reformat things if needed.

This patch works fine for me too on sage-on-gentoo with python-2.7.1. I have applied this patch to the vanilla sage-4.7.1.alpha2 (python-2.6.4.p10) spkg and all long tests pass. I have also applied the patch along with the patches and required spkgs in ticket¬†#9958¬†to the sage-4.7.1.alpha2 (python-2.7.1) spkg and all the tests that failed without this patch because of segfaults, i.e.

sage -t ¬†-force_lib "devel/sage/sage/schemes/generic/scheme.py"

sage -t ¬†-force_lib "devel/sage/sage/rings/morphism.pyx" ¬† ¬†

sage -t ¬†-force_lib "devel/sage/sage/rings/homset.py"

now pass.

Can you explain this in more detail? Why does the parent object being immutable help in keeping the pointer valid? Do you mean that the parent cython object doesn't change it's ring member? That is correct, but not enough to make the approach safe: if you don't keep a reference to the parent python object around, python might decide to garbage-collect that first, leading to a call to the singula function rDelete. I guess that function at least frees the memory, so if you are unlucky, some thread will overwrite the memory that ring points to with completely different data. Of course, in most cases you'd be lucky, so you wouldn't notice the problem. But unless singular does some reference counting of its own in such a way that a rDelete call on the parent won't have immediate effect, your approach isn't safe.

> The patch should fix the crash, but I don't have a Sage-on-Python-2.7 install to test it. Can somebody give it a try?

Here, the new patch doesn't solve the segfault problems when applied to sage-on-gentoo. In testing vanilla Sage with python-2.7.1 I've been patching the Sage spkg and then building. So my sage-main isn't a pristine sage-4.7.1.alpha2 with python-2.7.1. However the last patch that I've applied is the bug11339a patch. So, I cloned Sage to the patchset just prior to this last patch, apply the new patch and issued 'sage -ba'. The 3 tests listed #comment:11¬†all segfault. Let me know if you think my results are "overly" tainted.

Does it depend on other patches that are post 4.7.1.alpha2? The feedback so far is that it doesn't work but I noticed there was some work in singular and rings in alpha3 and alpha4. Would it rely on any of these fixes?

I'm not sure there really is a cycle. I had interpreted the situation in such a way that tp_clear will be called for unreachable objects just in case there might be some kind of cycle between them. So there might be no actual cycle involved at all, or it might be with some other member object. One requirement is that the function does cut all cycles, which should work as the parent shouldn't be referring back to the Gr√∂bner strategy. So by keeping the reference in one direction, we satisfy tp_clear and still manage to finalize things. As a bonus, we ensure their finalization in the correct order.

But I might be completely off target with my above understanding. Someone with intricate knowledge of python, its evolution, as well as cython, might know better.

Until then, someone could add breakpoints to see if the finalizer is executed with my patch in place. Don't have the time just now, but might do it myself in a week or so if you remind me.

The Python docs say "The `tp_clear` member function is used to break reference cycles in cyclic garbage detected by the garbage collector.", so there must have been a cycle involving the `GroebnerStrategy` instance.

I looked a bit at the source and we definitely have cycles ideal<->`GroebnerStrategy`. Both refer to the parent ring, and this explains why `tp_clear` was called on `GroebnerStrategy`. I haven't found a place where the parent refers back to the cycle. In this situation Martin's patch should work as we can get rid of the cycle while the parent has positive refcount. It could be that Python 2.7 got smarter and deletes the parent together with the cycle while Python 2.6 first deleted the cycle and only then noticed that nothing else refers to the parent any more. This would explain why Martin's patch works but my attempt of blindly accessing the ring C structure fails on Python 2.7. 

There is a lot of stuff that could conceivably create a larger cycle involving the parent even though I haven't found one. For one, the parent keeps a reference to the "one" element. Even then, I think it is too dangerous to make the hidden assumption that there are no complete cycles involving the parents. Somebody is bound to trip over this sooner or later.

I have boldly pushed it to the sage-on-gentoo tree and can report that it works fine with python-2.7.1 there on 4.7.1.alpha2. It solved the problem we had but another doctest crashed that looked completely unrelated until I looked at the backtrace:

```

and here is it says when I add -verbose

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.

```
It should be double checked with a vanilla install in case it just reveals a problem with my libsingular ebuild.

I didn't realize you could do something like

```
sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage-main/sage/crypto/mq/sr.py -gdb
```
handy...

Since we can even add "-verbose" I should add this bit of output:

```
Trying:
    test_consistency(Integer(1))  # long time (80s on sage.math, 2011)###line 3337:_sage_    >>> test_consistency(1)  # long time (80s on sage.math, 2011)
Expecting:
    True

```
So it looks like the segfault is after the test has completed, probably when sage is quitting as happened to Steve when he tried to run the test while disabling the garbage collection (before we had any patches what so ever).

I've just completed the testsuite after building vanilla sage-4.7.1.alpha2 from scratch. The patches from tickets #11377, #11244, #9958, #11376 and #10764 along with the patches of this ticket were used to create a patched sage-4.7.1.alpha2 spkg before the build. The results are identical to those reported earlier. There are no segfaults and no Killed/crashed tests.

On my sage-on-gentoo install on x86 in prefix there no segfaults; however, I have one Killed/crashed doctest which I didn't have when using the¬†bug11339a patch.

Ah, this might also explain #5949 then.

The API is as follows: `pXXX` does assume the `currRing` to be set, whereas `p_XXX` does not. However, sometimes there are bugs, i.e. you call `p_XXX` and it crashes unless `currRing` is set.

> This is why I added the inlined  `_check_ring()` function to each `MPolynomial_libsingular` method to make

TBH, I don't like this blanket approach, did you run into specific problems? If so, I'd add a check to those functions instead of hiding bugs by forcing the ring.

The updated polynomials patch fixes another place where potentially the wrong singular ring was used, which would explain the data corruption. Please give it a try!

I'm pretty sure that `p_Normalize` requires `currRing` to be set. In the polynomials destructor, I have

```
    ### If you suspect that the poly data was corrupted, then this is a good way to trigger a segfault:
    rChangeCurrRing(self._parent_ring)
    p_Normalize(self._poly, self._parent_ring)
```
This is useful for debugging because `p_Normalize` will touch all coefficients of the polynomial. The destructor is typically called long after the actual computations so it is very likely that the `currRing` has changed by then. If I reverse the order of the two lines, then I get segfaults all over the Sage library. However, because it relies on the finalization order, they are usually in varying places and often disappear if you just paste the doctest into Sage.

I built a sage spkg with Singular's polynomials debugging turned on (`PDEBUG=2`) and now Singular spits out tons of memory allocation errors during Sage startup (turns out Sage does some high-degree polynomial computations during startup). Can somebody who understands Singular better comment on whether those are real errors?

Note that its not as easy as turning on `SAGE_DEBUG`; the Singular spkg-install does set a configure option in that case but its not doing anything. I also had to fix up an instance where an `#ifdef PDEBUG` replaced a libSingular function by a macro.

OK back to singular problems. On my OS X (10.5.8 32bits) box I got another test crash:

```
sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage-main/sage/rings/polynomial/toy_buchberger.py
```
and the following backtrace

```

This is with 4.7.1.alpha4. I'll try again on the linux x86 box this weekend (and not lose the logs this time). It may be the last test I run on that box for a while.

Vanilla or sage-on-gentoo (sog) variety? So far for sog I still only have the sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_curve_isogeny.py crash but nothing else on amd64. 

My linux-x86 box is "decommissioned", I'll look on x86 OS X next.

Haven't had time to try vanilla.

Aside from the segfaults, with the new patches I get the following additional failurers. The failures "seem" to be associated with the patches in that I don't get them when I use Martin's patches.

With the singular SPKG and the patches (both of them) from #10903 I get no segfaults for the long tests on both x86 and amd64. However, there is one test on x86 that usually takes a very long time that now fails. It may be singular-related.

It looks singular related but it doesn't immediately ring a bell. I'd guess some strategically placed `rChangeCurrRing` would fix the issue, but the problem is to find where to put it.

+Python makes no guarantees that destructors are called if circular references are involved. This patch implements an extra Python proxy layer that correctly refcounts Singular rings. In contrast to our earlier code, it will release the singular rings once they are no longer in use. This triggers various issues in Sage/libSingular that are dealt with in the follow-up ticket #10903
+
+# Historic discussion
+
 As [described for the Sage on Gentoo project](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/51#issuecomment-1181259), there is a problem in how parts of sage use `__deallocate__` in their Cython code. I've actually traced an instance of [groebner_strategy.pyx](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/361a4ad7d52c/sage/libs/singular/groebner_strategy.pyx#l134) causing segmentation faults under Python 2.7.
 
 What happens is that the garbage collector invokes the [tp_clear](http://docs.python.org/c-api/typeobj.html#tp_clear) function for the object. Its implementation is provided by Cython, and one of its effects is that every python reference will be set to `None`. A bit later on, [tp_dealloc](http://docs.python.org/c-api/typeobj.html#tp_dealloc) is called and invokes the `__deallocate__` method. By that time, `_parent` is `None`, so accessing `_parent._ring` is a bad idea, and in this case it turns out to be null.
 
 Others have had similar problems before. There are [crude workarounds](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4501938/how-can-c-object-lifetimes-be-correctly-managed-in-cython) floating around. I guess a proper solution would be twaking cython to allow custom code in the tp_clear function. In other words, have a "magic" mehod `__clear__` similar to the magic `__deallocate__`.
