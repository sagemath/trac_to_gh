LGTM, pending adding the trac number to the ticket description. 

Why in the world did we define `__x` to do `ctypedef __x pariout_t`?

I know this has a positive review from the omnipotent testbot, but when I apply this to a freshly-rolled 4.7.alpha5 and do a full test I get two failures in sage/misc/sagedoc.py:

```
File "/home/jec/sage-4.7.alpha5.pari/devel/sage-main/sage/misc/sagedoc.py", line 874:
    sage: len(search_doc('tree', interact=False).splitlines()) > 2500  # long time
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
**********************************************************************
File "/home/jec/sage-4.7.alpha5.pari/devel/sage-main/sage/misc/sagedoc.py", line 489:
    sage: 'abvar/homology' in _search_src_or_doc('doc', 'homology', 'variety', interact=False)
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```
I built Sage with "make build" rather than "make", in case that is relevant.  Meanwhile I switched the tag to "needs info" but will continue with this applied and go on to #11130.

Probably it is, because the doctest failures you mention are related to the **documentation**.  So I would guess that `make doc-html` would solve those problems.

I guessed so, so am about to try again after sage -docbuild all html has finished...

As expected, the problem went away.  I suppose it was silly to base the full test on devel/sage and not devel/sage/sage given that I had not built the docs.
