This is the same problem as#11243 for Ubuntu 11.04.

Python was recently updated to build without OpenSSL support on 
 Debian, so I cannot build Sage anymore on my Debian Sid. 
[http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/p/python-defaults/pyt...](http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/p/python-defaults/python-defaults_2.6.6-14/changelog) 
 python2.6 (2.6.6-9) unstable; urgency=low 


* Build without OpenSSL v2 support. Closes: !#613369. 
   * Search headers and libraries in multiarch directories too. LP: 
!#738213.

Applying the same fix as for Ubuntu 11.04 in !#11243 fixes the problem,

so I guess that the spkg should be uploaded once again.

Changing the fix introduced there from :

![...] grep "Ubuntu 11.04"![...]

to :

grep -E "Ubuntu 11.04|Debian GNU/Linux wheezy/sid"

does the trick for me.

The content /etc/issue is similar on Debian Testing (which has the

same python version).

Not sure how universal "grep -E" is.

Thanks for the link, I somehow did not find it and you're completely right.

The solution there is also much smarter.

Hence this ticket should be closed as duplicate/won't fix.

Sorry for the noise.
