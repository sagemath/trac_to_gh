Nicer still.  

Builds, applies, and performs nicely on 4.7.

I'm going to run tests, since it seems the patchbot has not done its thing yet, and then will flip this to positive review.

Do we now have all the Platonic solids embedded properly?

Rob

Hem... We are missing the .... cube :-D

I just wrote the embedding, but I wondered : is it better to append it to this patch, or to create another one ? `:-)`

Writing the cube's embedding is so much less interesting than the dodecahedron's `^^;`

Either way, I guess.  If I don't get to it today, it might sit until Sage Days (which perhaps argues for another ticket?).

Got it.  Cube looks good as well.  Passes long tests, applies to 4,7, etc, etc.

Thanks for filling in these details, or perhaps I should say,
