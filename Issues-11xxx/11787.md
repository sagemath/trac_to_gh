#7570 should have been implemented by doing a len()==0 test, rather than a direct comparison to empty lists/dicts/etc.  That allows things like numpy arrays, etc.

I guess technically, numpy arrays aren't documented as being supported by list_plot, for example, so this might technically be an enhancement.

See http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/fb53b9d908acfb4 for a discussion of this bug.

Added patch to use numpy arrays. I am not happy with having to use len() but I don't know of a better way or non-ugly way to *not* traverse the whole list of input data. Hopefully, the impact to the running time is not too high for large input lists or tuples.

The alternative to checking `len(data) == 0` was something like the following (let's say we are calling `list_plot(data)`):

```python
import collections
if not isinstance(data, collections.Iterable):
    raise TypeError
if isinstance(data, dict) and not data:
    return Graphics()
if not isinstance(data, dict): # check that data is not a dict, to avoid KeyError
    try:
        a = data[0]
    except IndexError: # this means we have an iterable with no items
        return Graphics()
```

If you would like me to patch up with this ugly kludge of a code instead of the simple `len(data) == 0`, then let me know - I will put up a new patch. :)

*EDIT:* forgot to check for dict before `try`.

```

Th erecommended way for lists tuples etc. would have been

```
if not data:
   return Grpahics()
}}

But this does not work with ndarrays. len is O(1) for these types.

Updated the patch to take care of ndarrays of ndarrays, or even lists of ndarrays. The following are the tests on a corei5 `@` 2.5GHz.

There is probably a very minor but insignificant slowdown. The tests of plot.py without this patch takes 220.4s and with this patch takes 223.3s, i.e., 3 seconds more. Given that two more plots are introduced in the doctest, I believe there is no perceptible slowdown to the `list_plot` code.

Yikes! I learn something new everyday. I tried to avoid creating yet another list internally in the function by using `enumerate`. But this is an iterator and it runs through to the end of the list on one of the calls to `line` or `point`. And then if an exception is raised from those functions, then the list appears empty while trying the CC plots.

Indeed line and point can handle ndarrays. But the main problem is to detect when an empty array is passed in. Both those functions can not handle an empty numpy array. All this error checking was just to handle empty arrays :-|

```
sage: line(np.array([]))
...
ValueError: there must be at least 2 points

sage: line([])  # this is fine
sage: point([]) # this is fine

sage: point(np.array([]))
...
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute '_set_extra_kwds'
```

In my opinion, line 377 of sage/plot/point.py should read:

`if not points:`

And line 2848 of heegner should read

`return point([CDF(self.tau())], **kwds)`

or maybe

`return point(list(CDF(self.tau())), **kwds)`

This thing doesn't work with numpy arrays. That's why I am using `len` and that's why I had to write the ugly patch earlier.

The documentation of point2d is clear enough with regard to its input:

```
Point takes either a single tuple of coordinates or a list of tuples.
```
But the way the function is written you can pass it either a list of tuples/list or a tuple of tuples/list, or with this patch a numpy array.

EDIT: I wrote in[comment:19](#comment%3A19) that point2d takes any iterable. This is incorrect. It takes in any list or tuple only.

Unfortunately, neither #8082 nor #4348 adds any documentation about plotting complex numbers directly via points. Plotting them via `plot` or `list_plot` is of course well documented.

<Edited out>

Since the patch here does not break the code which deals with more than one instance of complex numbers, I suggest that we proceed with the patches here and deal with complex numbers in `point` or `line` in #9982. The following *undocumented* behavior is broken with this ticket

```
point(CC(I))
```
but the following works

```
point([CC(I)])
point([CC(I), CC(1)])
```

I updated the numpy patch to take care of complex numbers. It works in the cases where it used to work. See #9982 for the cases where it doesn't work.

Patchbot apply trac_11787-allow_numpy_arrays.2.patch

*Edit:*
1. for reviewing, the diff between the previous and this numpy patch can be [seen here](https://github.com/ppurka/sage-patches/commit/eb0e8ecb81deff15735d656f2c73fc83d3e8c45b).
2. the heegner patch is not needed any more.
