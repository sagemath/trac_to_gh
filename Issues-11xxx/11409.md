The old Sage notebook (as part of the Sage library) has been superseded by the sagenb spkg.  The following files are from the old notebook and should be removed:
* `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/server/introspect.py`
* `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/*`
* `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/server/simple/*`

The following files are duplicated in sagenb but contain some functionality which is not specific to the notebook.  At the moment no effort is made to dis-entangle these (but I have made them more uniform)
* `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/server/misc.py`
* `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/server/support.py`

---

**Apply**:
1. `cd sage/server && hg remove introspect.py notebook simple && hg commit -m "Trac #11409: Remove old notebook files"` # I prefer this shell command to a patch because there are no chances of a merge conflict
2. [attachment: trac_11409-rebased-v2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11409/trac_11409-rebased-v2.patch.gz)
3. [attachment: 11409_doctest.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11409/11409_doctest.patch.gz)

---

After applying the patches, running sdist, and then make from scratch, I get the following results:

```
$ cd $SAGE_ROOT
$ grep -e 'server.simple' -e 'server.notebook' -e 'server.introspect' -R .
Binary file ./devel/sage/.hg/store/data/doc/en/reference/notebook.rst.i matches
Binary file ./devel/sage/.hg/store/data/_m_a_n_i_f_e_s_t.in.i matches
Binary file ./devel/sage/.hg/store/00manifest.d matches
Binary file ./devel/sage-main/.hg/store/data/doc/en/reference/notebook.rst.i matches
Binary file ./devel/sage-main/.hg/store/data/_m_a_n_i_f_e_s_t.in.i matches
Binary file ./devel/sage-main/.hg/store/00manifest.d matches
./local/share/texmf/tex/generic/sagetex/remote-sagetex.dtx:% in \texttt{sage/server/simple/twist.py}.
```

This proves that the deleted files are no longer referenced (expect for a comment in SageTeX, this has been reported to Dan Drake).

How long should we wait then?  sagenb has existed at least since sage-4.2, released 25 october 2009 (almost 2 years ago).  I think that is sufficient time.

To be fair, I don't feel like I can review this in any case; it would have to be someone pretty familiar with the mechanics of the change to sagenb.   But it would be really nice to take care of this, you are right.

From [this sage-notebook thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-notebook/browse_thread/thread/7e2e94cc66d63cbf/78e24a6e39d2e413?show_docid=78e24a6e39d2e413#):

```

More importantly, it would be very useful if when we remove the code 
from devel/sage/sage/server that is needed to migrate, we include an 
error message that says: "Please migrate this Sage notebook server 
install by installing a version of Sage between 4.3 and 4.8, 
inclusive." 
Incidentally, I also plan to support the format of the sage notebook 
server files from 4.3 indefinitely.  It doesn't involve any version 
specific pickles, etc. 
 -- William 
```
So I guess something here about this.

I'm not clear on what is required. Where would this error message appear? During an upgrade, or when running Sage? Or should we just add something to the top-level README file?

I think we should support the following situation:
1. User has old version sage-x.y.z on his own laptop, runs Sage using the notebook interface.
2. His worksheets are stored in `$DOT_SAGE`.
3. He upgrades Sage to version 5.1 (either by `sage -upgrade` or just reinstalling from scratch).
4. He starts up the new notebook.
5. He finds his worksheets are still there.  Maybe some of his old code doesn't work anymore, but at least it should be there.

We should support this for as old versions as possible.
