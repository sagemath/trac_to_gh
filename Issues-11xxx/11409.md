The old Sage notebook (as part of the Sage library) has been superseded by the sagenb spkg.  The following files are from the old notebook and should be removed:
* `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/server/introspect.py`
* `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/*`
* `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/server/simple/*`

The following files are duplicated in sagenb but contain some functionality which is not specific to the notebook.  At the moment no effort is made to dis-entangle these (but I have made them more uniform)
* `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/server/misc.py`
* `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/server/support.py`

---

**Apply**:
1. `cd sage/server && hg remove introspect.py notebook simple && hg commit -m "Trac #11409: Remove old notebook files"` # I prefer this shell command to a patch because there are no chances of a merge conflict
2. [attachment:trac_11409-rebased-v2.patch]
3. [attachment:11409_doctest.patch]

---

After applying the patches, running sdist, and then make from scratch, I get the following results:

```
$ cd $SAGE_ROOT
$ grep -e 'server.simple' -e 'server.notebook' -e 'server.introspect' -R .
Binary file ./devel/sage/.hg/store/data/doc/en/reference/notebook.rst.i matches
Binary file ./devel/sage/.hg/store/data/_m_a_n_i_f_e_s_t.in.i matches
Binary file ./devel/sage/.hg/store/00manifest.d matches
Binary file ./devel/sage-main/.hg/store/data/doc/en/reference/notebook.rst.i matches
Binary file ./devel/sage-main/.hg/store/data/_m_a_n_i_f_e_s_t.in.i matches
Binary file ./devel/sage-main/.hg/store/00manifest.d matches
./local/share/texmf/tex/generic/sagetex/remote-sagetex.dtx:% in \texttt{sage/server/simple/twist.py}.
```

This proves that the deleted files are no longer referenced (expect for a comment in SageTeX, this has been reported to Dan Drake).

How long should we wait then?  sagenb has existed at least since sage-4.2, released 25 october 2009 (almost 2 years ago).  I think that is sufficient time.

<a id='comment:20'></a>From [this sage-notebook thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-notebook/browse_thread/thread/7e2e94cc66d63cbf/78e24a6e39d2e413?show_docid=78e24a6e39d2e413#):

```

More importantly, it would be very useful if when we remove the code 
from devel/sage/sage/server that is needed to migrate, we include an 
error message that says: "Please migrate this Sage notebook server 
install by installing a version of Sage between 4.3 and 4.8, 
inclusive." 
Incidentally, I also plan to support the format of the sage notebook 
server files from 4.3 indefinitely.  It doesn't involve any version 
specific pickles, etc. 
 -- William 
```
So I guess something here about this.
