Given the initial terms of a sequence of numbers (or polynomials or whatever) we want to find a differential or algebraic or functional equation for the generating function or a explicit formula for the individual terms.

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
This can mean several things:

* a guesser of sequences generated by rational polynomials (linear recurrences with constant coefficients), dependent on
  1. the ring of such recurrences
* a guesser of sequences generated by holonomic functions (P-finite sequences, recurrences with coefficients being polynomials in the sequence index n), dependent on
  1. the ring of such recurrences
* guessers for other types of sequences

So this issue depends on several sub-issues.
