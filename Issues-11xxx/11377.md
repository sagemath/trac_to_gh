module_list.py is quite messy in its current state. There are several things that can be done:
1. remove the unused debian bits
2. we have SAGE_LOCAL and SAGE_INC variables but there use iis not uniform
3. we also have numpy_include_dirs, numpy_depends, flint_depends, singular_depends and ginac_depends and most of them are under-used.

In this ticket I remove old debian stuff, use SAGE_INC, SAGE_LOCAL and the other variables in a uniform fashion removing all instances of SAGE_ROOT +/local/... and so on to replace it by the appropriate variable.

```

Would have been nice if you'd cc'ed me ;-) (as I have introduced `SAGE_INC` :-) and always been interested in cleaning the whole mess up, not to mention tickets like #8664, #9914, or the "final" trouble with #4000 ...).

Robert B. originally planned (about 14+ month ago, cf. e.g. #7987) to "automate" most of what's currently hand-coded in `module_list.py` (by Cython pragmas local to the modules' files), so I mostly made changes that affect only small parts.

Btw, I may have missed something, but neither alpha4 (nor alpha3) have yet been announced; the `README.FIRST`s still state

Hi Robert,

sorry I didn't know you had introduced it. I was vaguely aware of the existence of an effort like #7987 but didn't know the ticket or that a ticket was actually open.

I must say my primary aim was the elimination of reference to SAGE_ROOT which is a pain for sage-on-gentoo. And of course once started I had to clean the whole thing, I have been waiting for some time with my clean up patch I can tell you. So I am glad it got reviewed positively and all.

And above all *merged*! Making larger changes to `module_list.py` is some kind of Sisyphean task since many tickets (unrelated to the build system) frequently modify parts of it.

Reducing the need for the latter should IMHO be the next step, as it somewhat thwarts concurrent, modular development and maintainability.

I've more than once spent days to figure out and remove useless dependencies (e.g. on libraries) last year, in some cases just to - not much later - see the effort being more or less in vain...
