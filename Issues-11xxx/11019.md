This is bad:

```python
sage: B.<a,b,c> = BooleanPolynomialRing()
sage: B(0).lex_lead()
terminate called after throwing an instance of 
'polybori::PBoRiGenericError<7u>'
  what():  Illegal operation on zero diagram or (sub-)polynomial.

Btw. I couldn't go for throwing an error because sometimes `gbcore.py` calls lex_lead() on zero. So I opted for returning zero which seems to work.

The patch looks good, so code-review by inspection is positive already, I'll apply it for a technical review.
But `gbcore.py` shouldn't call lex_lead on zero, so maybe you can provide me the corresponding examples off-trac for upstream debugging?
