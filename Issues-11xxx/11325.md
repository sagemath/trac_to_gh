# Issue 11325: Multiple line cells generation in live help broken, lots of samples unusable

In notebook the sample tags like "sage:" and "..." are removed. As far as I tested, in case of notebook, after "sage:" all spaces are removed until next character, and after "..." one space is removed.

In notebooks automatically generated from html help, space after "..." isn't removed, causing unexpected indentation error in all samples that require first and second lines aligned. Best example are all decorated samples, like `@`interact in reference manual. This bug makes all such cells fail by default, which is bad thing for bundled documentation, that's why I set the priority to major, it might be even higher probably.

See topic http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/4d0aabee8ecc4cf1 for first report.

**Assignee:** @jasongrout, @qed777, @williamstein

**Keywords:** IndentationError, live help, beginner sd35.5

**Reviewer:** Jeroen Demeyer, Peter Story

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.
