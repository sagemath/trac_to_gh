This was detected in the following speed regression

In vanilla sage 4.6.2

```
sage: a=Integer(1000)
sage: b=int(1000)
sage: c=[0]
sage: %timeit c*a
625 loops, best of 3: 21.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit c*b
625 loops, best of 3: 5.21 µs per loop
```

In vanilla sage 4.7.rc4

```
sage: a=Integer(1000)
sage: b=int(1000)
sage: c=[0]
sage: %timeit c*a
625 loops, best of 3: 568 µs per loop
sage: %timeit c*b
625 loops, best of 3: 5.13 µs per loop
```

By default the coercion model should not be recording exceptions ocurred in the execution of sage unless explicitely anabling reconding exceptions for debugging support.

Ok, let me understand the code. There is a recording of exceptions that are very convenient for debugging. The problem is that it produces an important performance penalty. This is solved with record_exceptions() that controls the attribute _record_exceptions which is the flag that controls.

Just one thing. Each time that record_exceptions is called, the exception stack cached is cleared so:

```
sage: cm = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()
sage: cm.record_exceptions()
sage: cm._test_exception_stack()
sage: cm.record_exceptions()
sage: cm.exception_stack()
[]            
```

Is this the intended behavior? It is trivially seen from the code but I think it should be documented.
