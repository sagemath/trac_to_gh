This was detected in the following speed regression

In vanilla sage 4.6.2

```
sage: a=Integer(1000)
sage: b=int(1000)
sage: c=[0]
sage: %timeit c*a
625 loops, best of 3: 21.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit c*b
625 loops, best of 3: 5.21 µs per loop
```

In vanilla sage 4.7.rc4

```
sage: a=Integer(1000)
sage: b=int(1000)
sage: c=[0]
sage: %timeit c*a
625 loops, best of 3: 568 µs per loop
sage: %timeit c*b
625 loops, best of 3: 5.13 µs per loop
```

By default the coercion model should not be recording exceptions ocurred in the execution of sage unless explicitely anabling reconding exceptions for debugging support.

Just one thing. Each time that record_exceptions is called, the exception stack cached is cleared so:

```
sage: cm = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()
sage: cm.record_exceptions()
sage: cm._test_exception_stack()
sage: cm.record_exceptions()
sage: cm.exception_stack()
[]            
```

Is this the intended behavior? It is trivially seen from the code but I think it should be documented.
