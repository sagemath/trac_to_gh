This was detected in the following speed regression

In vanilla sage 4.6.2

```
sage: a=Integer(1000)
sage: b=int(1000)
sage: c=[0]
sage: %timeit c*a
625 loops, best of 3: 21.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit c*b
625 loops, best of 3: 5.21 µs per loop
```

In vanilla sage 4.7.rc4

```
sage: a=Integer(1000)
sage: b=int(1000)
sage: c=[0]
sage: %timeit c*a
625 loops, best of 3: 568 µs per loop
sage: %timeit c*b
625 loops, best of 3: 5.13 µs per loop
```

By default the coercion model should not be recording exceptions ocurred in the execution of sage unless explicitely anabling reconding exceptions for debugging support.

Robert, I get a documentation warning, I would guess the docbuilder gets confused by the "\n" in the doctest:

```
docstring of sage.structure.coerce.CoercionModel_cache_maps.record_exceptions:11: (WARNING/2) Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

Ok, let me understand the code. There is a recording of exceptions that are very convenient for debugging. The problem is that it produces an important performance penalty. This is solved with record_exceptions() that controls the attribute _record_exceptions which is the flag that controls.

Just one thing. Each time that record_exceptions is called, the exception stack cached is cleared so:

```
sage: cm = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()
sage: cm.record_exceptions()
sage: cm._test_exception_stack()
sage: cm.record_exceptions()
sage: cm.exception_stack()
[]            
```

Is this the intended behavior? It is trivially seen from the code but I think it should be documented.

Attachment [11388-coercion-speed-referee-patch.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11388/11388-coercion-speed-referee-patch.patch) by @lftabera created at 2011-07-20 14:46:13
