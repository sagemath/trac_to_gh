```
Currently, all viewers default to `$SAGE_BROWSER` if it is set, `$BROWSER` or some other system-specific defaults (like `xdg-open`, if present) otherwise.

The original proposal on this ticket was to support environment variables for what is currently

* `sage.misc.viewer.DVI_VIEWER`,
* `sage.misc.viewer.PDF_VIEWER`, and
* `sage.misc.viewer.PNG_VIEWER`.

I think instead that if the user wants to change the defaults, then that should happen in their init.sage file.  The current patch allows them to add lines like these:

```
from sage.misc.viewer import viewer
viewer.browser('open -a /Applications/Chrome.app')
viewer.png_viewer('display')
viewer.pdf_viewer('acroread')
viewer.dvi_viewer('/usr/bin/xdvi')
```
(or of course to use these interactively from the command line) and then the appropriate program will be used.

On further thought, I think this is a bad idea. These variables are only used within Sage, so rather than environment variables, they should be set in `.sage/init.sage`.  I'm attaching a patch (which needs work: no doctests and not really tested at all), which allows for this sort of behavior:

```
# init.sage file
from sage.misc.viewer import viewer
viewer.pdf_viewer('open -a /Applications/Adobe\ Reader.app')
```
Then if `a` is some Sage object, this opens up Adobe Reader on my Mac:

```
view(a, pdflatex=True)
```
(The attached patch also fixes a few bugs in latex.py so that this actually works.)

Opinions about using init.sage instead of environment variables?

Thank you very much for this patch ! I had actually begun to write a (much worse) version of it, then noticed you had already done the job ! I joined a patch adding unimportant details to yours, and there's one question keeping me from giving a positive review to your patch immediately : why isn't `_viewer_prefs` just a dictionary ?

hi.  fwiw, i downloaded an applied these two patches on my macosx 10.8 system (using fink).  i added the following to my init.sage:

```python
from sage.misc.viewer import viewer
viewer.browser('/sw/bin/w3m')
viewer.dvi_viewer('/sw/bin/xdvi')
viewer.pdf_viewer('/sw/bin/xpdf')
viewer.png_viewer('/sw/bin/display')
```
and ran simple tests.  everything worked just fine.  (i had a separate issue with error reporting for non-existent viewers, but i don't think that's in the scope of this patch.)

*i* would also like the ability to get plot3d to use other than jmol.  i suspect that's also out of scope for this patch.  so, i'm basically happy.  cheers.
