```
The `map_coefficients()` function of a multivariate polynomial ring cannot change the base ring. Sometimes this would be nice, e.g.

```
sage:  R.<r> = GF(9); S.<s> = GF(81)
sage:  h = Hom(R,S)[0]; h
Ring morphism:
  From: Finite Field in r of size 3^2
  To:   Finite Field in s of size 3^4
  Defn: r |--> 2*s^3 + 2*s^2 + 1
sage: T.<X,Y> = R[]   
sage:  f = r*X+Y
sage:  f.map_coefficients(h)  
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: 
```
`NotImplementedError` comes, because `R(2*s^3 + 2*s^2 + 1)` is not possible; it should be `S(2*s^3 + 2*s^2 + 1)`.

Now there is an additional parameter. If given, then the base ring of the polynomial ring is changed. 
Example from above continued:

```
sage: f.map_coefficients(h,S)
(-s^3 - s^2 + 1)*X + Y
```
