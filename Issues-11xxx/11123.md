From [this ask.sagemath](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/479/plot-sqrtsinx) question:

```

----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.6.2, Release Date: 2011-02-25                       |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: plot(sqrt(sin(x)),(0,10))
verbose 0 (4069: plot.py, generate_plot_points) WARNING: When plotting, failed to evaluate function at 74 points.
verbose 0 (4069: plot.py, generate_plot_points) Last error message: ''
```
The picture is attached.  

Ideally, we would want plot to just not connect those pieces.  With just sqrt(x) over -1 to 1, it's not a problem, but this really does look bad.

This should be resolved as duplicate of #13246. This ticket is older, but the other one has discussion and a patch.
