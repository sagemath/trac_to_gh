Nice.  Passes tests in the obvious directories.

Experimentally, the colorbar would appear to have a length equal to the longest side of the plot.  So in one orientation it matches the length of the side, aesthetically pleasing.  But in the other orientation it can be grossly larger than the plot.  Maybe to make sure the gradations do not get totally smooshed together in the colormap along the short edge?  

Anyway, several suggestions:

(a) Document the colorbar defaulting to length of long side.

(b) Use the right combination of max/min on matrix dimensions to provide the right rows:columns ratio to always provide a colorbar the same length as the matrix plot.

(c) Clearly document how to accomplish (b) with an option like `colorbar_options={'shrink':0.2} `.  which seems to be the way to accomplish what I'd like to be easily possible.

(d)  (b) and (c)

(e)  None of the above.

I could contribute to the docstring if you want to go that route.  But it has to be now, not much time for this for many days to come.

Rob

OK, I'll write a documentation-only patch after dinner and we can trade reviews.

Patch adds a doctest showing how to change the size of a colorbar.  The default behavior is not as straightforward as I thought, so it would not have been worth the effort to do this automatically.

There is also some minor cleanup in the documentation, mostly whitespace and line breaks.

With both patches on 4.8.alpha3 this passes all tests and documentation looks fine.  I'm clear on a positive review on Jason's patch.  If my documentation patch looks OK, go ahead and flip this to positive review.

You showed a good solution, though.
