}
```
The following GAP input (say in the notebook)

```
if 4>3 then
Print("You should see me.");
fi;
```
gets changed to 

```
if 4>3 thenPrint("You should see me.");fi;
```
before sending to GAP.  Obviously this fails since `thenPrint` should be two words.

It also doesn't strip comments correctly as can be seen by

```
## here is a comment
if 4>3 then
 Print("here");
fi
```
which returns nothing.

The reason they didn't send it all at once seems to be that the interface doesn't properly handle continuation prompts (it deletes enough characters for the whole prompt). Sending all on one line avoids them... except of course when it doesn't.  In particular something like

```
if true then
```
in the notebook will cause all sorts of unhappiness (3 characters cut off the end of the output) until a cell like 

```
fi
```
is evaluated.  Hopefully this should be fixed now.  We probably shouldn't worry too much about the above case since a similar cell with 

```
if false then
```
will simply cause everything to stop being evaluated until a closing cell is evaluated.  I don't see a way around this, and it should probably be considered user error.

The following tests failed:

The startup.py failure is not important, and the maxima failure seems to remain even when I unapply your patch and rebuild, so I have no idea what's going on with that.
