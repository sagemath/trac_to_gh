```
The following GAP input (say in the notebook)

```
if 4>3 then
Print("You should see me.");
fi;
```
gets changed to 

```
if 4>3 thenPrint("You should see me.");fi;
```
before sending to GAP.  Obviously this fails since `thenPrint` should be two words.

It also doesn't strip comments correctly as can be seen by

```
## here is a comment
if 4>3 then
 Print("here");
fi
```
which returns nothing.

... OK, I ran the test again.

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t -long 4.7.alpha3-main/devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/maxima.py # 4 doctests failed
        sage -t -long 4.7.alpha3-main/devel/sage-main/sage/tests/startup.py # 1 doctests failed
```

The startup.py failure is not important, and the maxima failure seems to remain even when I unapply your patch and rebuild, so I have no idea what's going on with that.
