Throughout Sage, there are a few doctests taking a very long time (more than 30 seconds) but sometimes these can easily be simplified to take less time.  Also add `# long time` where needed.

And on some machines the PExpect interfaces are very slow, or frequently hang...
(There's some ticket by Simon King alleviating this in a couple of cases; don't recall the ticket number right now.)

Slightly related: We should IMHO make it such that the timeouts for doctests (perhaps optionally, or in addition) do not refer to wall but actual CPU time, since often doctests timeout just because they don't get enough CPU when doctesting with (more or less) many threads [and] on an already loaded machine.

In principle I agree, but I don't think that is implementable in a good and portable way.

P.S.: If you want to see *which line* of a doctest takes how long, you can

```sh
$ cd $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin
$ mv ncadoctest.py ncadoctest.py.orig
$ cp -p sage:/home/leif/Sage/scripts/ncadoctest-v0.3.py ncadoctest.py
```
and test the file(s) in verbose mode.

There's no patch worth to get merged yet; I'll *one day*<sup>TM</sup> develop this further and implement this behaviour as a separate option to `sage -t ...`.

Note that with this version of `ncadoctest.py` the output when a doctest fails *in non-verbose mode* also differs.

We could use `setrlimit()` in `sage-doctest.py` (which tests just a single file, i.e., each doctested file has its own instance), or add appropriate code (e.g. setting `SIGALRM`, and checking the consumed CPU time with `getrusage()`) to the generated temporary files with the examples that get run by Python.

This only works for one process, so it will not work well with pexpect interfaces which spawn several child processes.
