There is a lot of very useful stuff here, which could be moved elsewhere otherwise there's a danger that others might re-invent some of the wheels.  I am thinking of the SL2Z and Gamma0N-equivalence functions, and also the approximate-point class which could also be used for ordinary Heegner points, and also for points computed from a complex number modulo a period lattice (so-called elliptic exponential).  This is not a criticism.  And neither is it a review yet -- sorry!

I realize that.  However, I didn't want a patch that would constantly bitrot, and at the same time, have to write way more code than necessary (e.g., if I do Gamma0N, then might as well do Gamma1N, etc.)  I think it would be good for this code to safely go in as a step 1, then in the future have small parts of it (the ones you list above) refactored and extended to more general cases.     I think it will be easier to referee now since it is fairly self contained and well documented (by a short paper).   The alternative might be 10 patches all over Sage with confusing dependencies....

The code isn't quite ready for review, but will be within a day or two.

Here is part 1 of a review which will take a while.

1. Applies fine to 4.8.rc0;  two test failures (numerical noise, 64-bit):

```

Got:
    (-5.44009282066e-15 + 1.0*I, 5.55111512313e-16 + 1.0*I)
```

2. No problems building docs since the new files are not added to the
reference manual!  If they are (now or one day) there may well be
issues with formatting, but I will not check for these now.

3. Testing sl2z_rep_in_fundom(z):

```
sage: z=CDF(110.1,0.0000000001)   
sage: zz,g = sl2z_rep_in_fundom(z)
sage: g.acton(z)                  
-5684.1 + 99999999.6275*I
sage: zz                          
0.341867712408 + 99999999.6769*I
sage: g
[ -56841 6258194]
[     10   -1101]
```

This suggests rounding problems -- which are always a problem with
this algorithm especially when the input point has very small
imaginary part.  (And that does happen in practice!)  My own strategy
here (when Im(z) is very small) is to start by taking a good rational
approximation to Re(z) and first use the SL(2,Z) element taking that
rational to infinity; only then apply this algorithm.

4. Gamma_0(N)-equivalence: very clever idea to check that (1) z1,z2
and (2) Nz1,Nz2 are SL(2,Z)-equivalent!  I am still trying to prove to
myself that this works even when z1,z2 are elliptic, since in this
case the g taking z1 to z2 is not unique (in PSL(2,Z)).  So is it not
possible for both pairs to be SL(2,Z)-equivalent but the matrix in
SL(2,Z) taking Nz1 to Nz2 is not the conjugate by [N,0;0,1] of the one
taking z1 to z2?

5. Typo: 
l.228 "do" --> "due"

-- That's it as far as line 303.

In the comp method for X0NPoint you get an assertion error when the\nlevels are different.  Would it not be better to do something\ndifferent?\n\n3. Your Atkin-Lehner method for X0NPoint is more general than the doc\nsays: it says that q should be a prime power, but it works fine for\nany q|N coprime to N/q (as it should!).\n\n```\nsage: z = CDF(1,1)         \nsage: P = X0NPoint(z,90,30) # N = 90 = 10*9\nsage: P.atkin_lehner(10)                 \n[0.11049724 + 0.00055248619*I]\nsage: P.atkin_lehner(10).atkin_lehner(10)\n[0.10554020 + 0.000013888696*I]\nsage: P.atkin_lehner(10).atkin_lehner(10) == P\nTrue\n```\nSince you'll be editing the INPUT anyway, I suggest adding an example such as this.\n\n4. Function close_points: (1) missing explanation of the search_bound\ninput param. (2) I guess you mean to use this function only for rank1\ncurves?  You only use the first generator.  And it's inefficient to\ncompute n*Q for each n in the range [-k..k] separately, which is\n*precisely* why Iwrote this a few years ago:\n\n```\nsage: multiples?\nFile:           /home/jec/sage-4.8.rc0/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/groups/generic.py\nDocstring:\n       Return an iterator which runs through \"P0+i*P\" for \"i\" in\n       \"range(n)\".\n```\nFor example:\n\n```\nsage: P = EllipticCurve('389a1').gens()[0]\nsage: [Q[0] for Q in multiples(P,11,-5*P)]\n[-22625407/11397376, 47503/16641, 26/361, 10/9, -1, 0, -1, 10/9, 26/361, 47503/16641, -22625407/11397376]\n```\n\n5.

This is John's second review, which he couldn't post because of a DB error.  I'm posting it for him:
                                               
                                             
1. With the second patch, all tests pass except for one (see below) and
the docs build OK.  I have not yet actually looked at the ref-man
pages.  And the new files have 100% coverage.

```
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/chow_heegner.py

        if isinstance(z, (float, int, long)) or z.imag() <= 0:
    TypeError: 'float' object is not callable
```
The problem is that when z has type complex, z.imag is not a function
so z.imag() raises an error.  I don't know what to do: imag(z) works
for CDF and complex, but for complex it returns a complex number!!!

```
sage: imag(CDF(1,1))
1.0
sage: imag(complex(1,1))
(1+0j)
```

2. In the comp method for X0NPoint you get an assertion error when the
levels are different.  Would it not be better to do something
different?

3. Your Atkin-Lehner method for X0NPoint is more general than the doc
says: it says that q should be a prime power, but it works fine for
any q|N coprime to N/q (as it should!).

```
sage: z = CDF(1,1)         
sage: P = X0NPoint(z,90,30) # N = 90 = 10*9
sage: P.atkin_lehner(10)                 
[0.11049724 + 0.00055248619*I]
sage: P.atkin_lehner(10).atkin_lehner(10)
[0.10554020 + 0.000013888696*I]
sage: P.atkin_lehner(10).atkin_lehner(10) == P
True
```
Since you'll be editing the INPUT anyway, I suggest adding an example such as this.

4. Function close_points: (1) missing explanation of the search_bound
input param. (2) I guess you mean to use this function only for rank1
curves?  You only use the first generator.  And it's inefficient to
compute n*Q for each n in the range [-k..k] separately, which is
*precisely* why Iwrote this a few years ago:

```
sage: multiples?
File:           /home/jec/sage-4.8.rc0/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/groups/generic.py
Docstring:
       Return an iterator which runs through "P0+i*P" for "i" in
       "range(n)".
```
For example:

```
sage: P = EllipticCurve('389a1').gens()[0]
sage: [Q[0] for Q in multiples(P,11,-5*P)]
[-22625407/11397376, 47503/16641, 26/361, 10/9, -1, 0, -1, 10/9, 26/361, 47503/16641, -22625407/11397376]
```

5. The last example for the identify function calls point_exact() not
identify()!  And point_exact seems to be a methd of a different class.
Did you mean to say c.numerical_approx().identify()?

6. I checked that EllipticCurve([0,2011]) is still not in the database
(no: it has conductor 1.7 billion).  I won't ask for this example to
be changed to [0,2012] (which has a smaller conductor!).

7. check_optimal:  special case needed for 990h3.  sorry.....

8. "Return the elliptic curve that this is the modular parametrization of." 
should be 
"Return the elliptic curve of which this is the modular parametrization."
(There are some lapses of grammar up with which I will not put!)

The story so far:   patches part2 and part3 address all the points Imade in the frist two parts of my review, with one exception.  As I emailed William independently the test for Gamma0(N)-equivalence of points in the upper half-plane is incorrect and can return True when it should be False, for example:

```
sage: N=5                                 
sage: z1=CDF(-2,1)/5                      
sage: z2=CDF(2,1)/5                       
sage: is_gamma0N_equivalent(z1,z2,5,1e-10)
True
```
This is wrong since (up to sign) the only matrices in SL(2,Z) taking z1 to z2 are
`[[1,0],[-4,1]]` and `[[2,-1],[-3,2]]`, neither of which is in Gamma0(5):

```
sage: g1=SL2Z([1,0,-4,1])
sage: g2=SL2Z([2,-1,-3,2])
sage: abs(g1.acton(z2) -z1)
6.20633538312e-17
sage: abs(g2.acton(z2) -z1)
2.00148302124e-16
```

I'll now continue the review...

The fix looks good to me.  I am testing now (done & fine).  I am slightly worried that the equality tests for i and rho using == would be better done using equality up to some precision?

One could cache the "constants" i, rho and their stabilisers, but it is hardly worth while since it will only be rare that these last lines of code are used in practice.

Lastly, do you need to test for both rho and rhobar given that you have normalised the fund.dom.reps.?  If so, the third of your special cases will not happen.

It is, in a sense, because it happens in `C=ComplexField(prec)`, where prec is the parameter that gets passed in.

> One could cache the "constants" i, rho and their stabilisers, but it is hardly worth while since it will only

Since the precision changes a lot, this might not be worth it, given how much other work happens and how rare this case is. 

> Lastly, do you need to test for both rho and rhobar given that you have normalised the fund.dom.reps.? 


Nope -- very good point. I've removed that. 

Is there anything else you want me to change?

Sorry but I am now confused about what to apply.  Presumably the 5 patches on githhub in the order part1,...,part5, but the last of those still does not address Jeroen's points?

I am really hoping that I can give this another positive review without having to read all except one last patch!  I had completely forgotten that this never made it.  SO as soon as you tag it "needs review" I'll look at it.

Yes.

Yes.

It's not "needs review" yet.  The issues are just some numerical noise, and I'm just updating the patches so people can use them (not so that they can get into sage, just yet).
