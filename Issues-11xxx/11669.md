This ticket depends on #11670.

There are a couple of simple optimizations to quaternion algebras that will help a lot with speed.  For example, before this patch:

```

sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-x-1); Q.<i,j,k> = QuaternionAlgebra(K,-1,-1); z=2*i+3*j+4/3*k+5/8
sage: type(z)
<type 'sage.algebras.quatalg.quaternion_algebra_element.QuaternionAlgebraElement_generic'>
sage: timeit('~z')
625 loops, best of 3: 115 µs per loop
sage: v = [z+i for i in range(1000)]
sage: time k = loads(dumps(v))
Time: CPU 1.80 s, Wall: 1.80 s
sage: timeit('a*z')
625 loops, best of 3: 96.4 µs per loop
```
and after:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-x-1); Q.<i,j,k> = QuaternionAlgebra(K,-1,-1); z=2*i+3*j+4/3*k+5/8
sage: type(z)
<type 'sage.algebras.quatalg.quaternion_algebra_element.QuaternionAlgebraElement_generic'>
sage: timeit('~z')
625 loops, best of 3: 20.6 µs per loop
sage: v = [z+i for i in range(1000)]
sage: time k = loads(dumps(v))
Time: CPU 0.31 s, Wall: 0.31 s
sage: timeit('a*z')
625 loops, best of 3: 4.63 µs per loop
```

The changes in the patch to give this "order of magnitude" speedup are very simple, and will make quaternion arithmetic over all base rings much faster for certain important operation.  The main idea of the patch (after I had tried many things and deleted most of them) is just to add a check parameter to get rid of some coercion that isn't needed, plus adding lmul and rmul methods generically.  That's it.  But it leads to 6-20 times speedups on basic operations of importance to me.
