In the notebook, try this:

First, in an input cell put this and evaluate:

```
G = sphere()   #+ sphere((0,0,1),color='red')
G.show(viewer='canvas3d')
G.show(viewer='tachyon')
```
The above should work fine.  Then remove the # comment in the first line to get

```
G = sphere() + sphere((0,0,1),color='red')
G.show(viewer='canvas3d')
G.show(viewer='tachyon')
```
Notice that the canvas3d output is wrong.   What seems to happen is that if you modify a given input cell, then the canvas3d output *never* gets changed.  This is very confusing.

Possibly related:

just brings up a Jmol thing, and plotting a `line` with this viewer brings up a black box.

I figured out what this is - it's a [cache busting](http://www.developphp.com/page.php?id=275) issue with javascript or something like that in the browser.  We figured out how to deal with this with jsmol, probably something similar should work here - as simple as the usual "?+random digits" trick, perhaps.  May need to happen in the notebook code, though.
