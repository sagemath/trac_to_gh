In the notebook, try this:

First, in an input cell put this and evaluate:

```
G = sphere()   #+ sphere((0,0,1),color='red')
G.show(viewer='canvas3d')
G.show(viewer='tachyon')
```
The above should work fine.  Then remove the # comment in the first line to get

```
G = sphere() + sphere((0,0,1),color='red')
G.show(viewer='canvas3d')
G.show(viewer='tachyon')
```
Notice that the canvas3d output is wrong.   What seems to happen is that if you modify a given input cell, then the canvas3d output *never* gets changed.  This is very confusing.

just brings up a Jmol thing, and plotting a `line` with this viewer brings up a black box.
