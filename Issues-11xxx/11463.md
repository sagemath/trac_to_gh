We've been asked the following question in #10519:

> I thought this might be because amgf.sage is a Sage file and not a Python
> file. So i renamed it amgf.py instead and got syntax errors. What's up with
> that? Do i have to rewrite all my code in Python instead of Sage?

I think this should be a FAQ.

In the patch it says:
"In Python 1 is a machine integer ``int`` (32 or 64 bits depending on your machine) and ``Integer(1)`` is ..."
That's not quite true. Python's "int" type is a bit shorter than the machine word length and they automatically extend to "long" in case of overflow. In Python 3, the only type visible is "int" and whether you have one or the other is an implementation detail.

Note that http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html is a bit misleading: Yes, python int is implemented via C-style "long" but that doesn't imply that maxint is the typical maxint for 64 or 32 bit:

```
>>> import sys
>>> sys.maxint
9223372036854775807
>>> 2**63
9223372036854775808L
```

I am attaching a grammar review patch for the original patch. The modifications I made include:
* Minor grammar corrections;
* Added some commas;
* Replaced a couple of words;
* Set the text width of the raw text file to 70 characters (like the rest of the file).

The en/faq document builds properly in both html and pdf formats.

I am not qualified to review the technical contents of the FAQ.
