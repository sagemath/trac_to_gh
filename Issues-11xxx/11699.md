In https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/p-nrpKUBMm8/LUMAfoXsz-UJ Jason Grout mentioned that it would be convenient if Sage accepted the following Matlab syntax for creating matrices:

```
sage: matrix("1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9")
[1 2 3]
[4 5 6]
[7 8 9]
```

This should be an easy change to the `matrix()` command, and would be very convenient for users, even those with no Matlab background.

In fact, we should support multiple lines here too, like Matlab, so you could do:

```
matrix("""
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
""")
```

To do that, do

```
# if a was the string passed in as the list of elements
a=a.replace(',', ' ').replace(';','\n')
rows = a.split('\n')
# throw away empty rows
rows = [r for r in rows if not r.trim()]
elements=[map(sage_eval, r.split()) for r in rows]
# now continue matrix processing with "elements" as the list of elements
```

At this point, it might be better to use regular expressions.  It's certainly worth a timing test.  Note the following matlab examples:

```
>> a=[1 2 3
4 5 6]

a =

     1     2     3
     4     5     6

>> a=[
1 2 3
4 5 6
]

a =

     1     2     3
     4     5     6

>> a=[  
1 2 3;
4 4 4
]

a =

     1     2     3
     4     4     4

>> a = [
1 2 3; ;
4 5 6]

a =

     1     2     3
     4     5     6

>> a = [;;1 2;;3 4] 

a =

     1     2
     3     4

>> a=[

1 2 3]

 In https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/p-nrpKUBMm8/LUMAfoXsz-UJ Jason Grout mentioned that it would be convenient if Sage accepted the following Matlab syntax for creating matrices:
 
 ```
-sage: a=matrix("1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9")
-sage: a
-matrix([[1, 2, 3],
-         [4, 5, 6],
-         [7, 8, 9]])
+sage: matrix("1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9")
+[1 2 3]
+[4 5 6]
+[7 8 9]
 ```
 
 This should be an easy change to the `matrix()` command, and would be very convenient for users, even those with no Matlab background.
