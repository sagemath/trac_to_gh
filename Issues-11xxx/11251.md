I've identified the problem: the file `sage-4.7/devel/sagenb/sagenb/misc/sphinxify.py` contains a non updated copy of the configuration file
`sage-4.7/devel/sage/doc/common/conf.py`

So if I find out why we don't simply fetch the file, I might fix it very soon.

Sorry for the confusion. My analysis of the problem was wrong. There is a code duplication and the actual file I had to patch is

```
sage-4.7/devel/sage-combinat/doc/en/introspect/conf.py
```
You can double check that it works both under the command line and the notebook. I actually don't really know what this `sphinxify.py` is here.

Introspection works, but isn't perfect.  I think it's good enough for now, but it might be nice to try to figure out what's wrong eventually.  In particular: look at a docstring with a ".. todo" markup in these four ways:

- in the reference manual: it looks great.  "TODO" is in bold, and the whole block has a different background color.
- in the notebook (by typing `sage.combinat.combinat?`, for example): it looks okay.  "TODO" is not in bold, and the block has the same background color as the rest of the docstring.
- from the command line, using `...?`: it looks as good as can be expected, since it's plain text.
- from the command line, using `browse_sage_doc(sage.combinat.combinat)`: it looks pretty good, in between the reference manual and the notebook: "TODO" is in bold, but the background color is white.

I tried modifying sphinxify.py and it didn't seem to have any effect.  If only there were some way to add something like this to a "to do list"...

Maybe I misunderstood the intent, but is there a way to omit the TODOs from "production" documentation?

(I thought they were only for "internal" use, i.e. invisible to an "ordinary" user, as opposed to a developer working on the documentation, similar to `\note{}` of LaTeX's "beamer" class.)

Actually, this wasn't my intend. As an open source project, I don't see the
point in hiding places where sage could be improved. On the contrary, marking
clearly in the documentation: "there is something we want to improve here"
seems to me to be a good practice. This was my main motivation for adding this
extension.

Otherwise said, in my mind those TODOs are more for long term improvement
where we don't know yet what to do and some feedback is needed or where we
don't have yet the manpower to do it, But my point of view is maybe not shared
by the majority of sage developers/users.

Now to answer the technical question, in `doc/common/conf.py` you have

```
# include the todos
todo_include_todos = True
```
Changing it to `False` by hand or depending on an environment variable
should do the job. Still, I'd rather having it to True by default.
