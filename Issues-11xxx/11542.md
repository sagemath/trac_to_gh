In this [sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/97757e7b9f0d3f5b?hl=en) Tom Boothby observed that misc.preparse_file has a habit to replace integers by identifiers that are supposed to be constants. This transformation turns some ungrammatical strings into grammatical ones, such as

```
1=5
```
which gets preparsed to

```
_sage_const_1 = Integer(1)
_sage_const_5 = Integer(5)
_sage_const_1 =_sage_const_5
```
Note that there does not have to be a "=" involved for this to happen:

```
[1^2 for j in range(10) for 1 in [1..2*1] ] 
```
which only differs one keyword from the perfectly legal

```
[1^2 for j in range(10) if 1 in [1..2*1] ] 
```
so it's likely that one has to fully parse the string to detect the problems.

Since the code produced by the normal `preparse` does not suffer from the problem (it transforms the ungrammatical constructs into other ungrammatical ones), one could use its output to test for errors:

```
sage: from ast import parse
sage: def fixed_preparse_file(s):
...       t=preparse(s)
...       try:
...           parse(t)
...           return sage.misc.preparser.preparse_file(s)
...       except:
...           return t
```
some timings on an ungrammatical construct

```
sage: timeit('fixed_preparse_file("[1^2 for j in range(10) for 1 in [1..2*1]]")')
625 loops, best of 3: 309 µs per loop
sage: timeit('sage.misc.preparser.preparse_file("[1^2 for j in range(10) for 1 in [1..2*1]]")')
625 loops, best of 3: 477 µs per loop
sage: timeit('preparse("[1^2 for j in range(10) for 1 in [1..2*1]]")')
625 loops, best of 3: 231 µs per loop
```
On a grammatical one

```
sage: timeit('fixed_preparse_file("[1^2 for j in range(10) if 1 in [1..2*1]]")')
625 loops, best of 3: 840 µs per loop
sage: timeit('sage.misc.preparser.preparse_file("[1^2 for j in range(10) if 1 in [1..2*1]]")')
625 loops, best of 3: 476 µs per loop
```
And, for reference, the output generated

```
sage: fixed_preparse_file("[1^2 for j in range(10) for 1 in [1..2*1]]")
'[Integer(1)**Integer(2) for j in range(Integer(10)) for Integer(1) in (ellipsis_range(Integer(1),Ellipsis,Integer(2)*Integer(1)))]'
sage: fixed_preparse_file("[1^2 for j in range(10) if 1 in [1..2*1]]")
'_sage_const_2 = Integer(2); _sage_const_1 = Integer(1); _sage_const_10 = Integer(10)\n[_sage_const_1 **_sage_const_2  for j in range(_sage_const_10 ) if _sage_const_1  in (ellipsis_range(_sage_const_1 ,Ellipsis,_sage_const_2 *_sage_const_1 ))]'
```
This code simply tries to parse the result of preparse and if that leads to an error, it returns that result (so that the error can be raised in the normal way). If it does parse, it returns the result of preparse_file instead. As you can see from the timings, the preparsing (and the double preparsing doubly so) is more expensive than the parsing.

Another option is to parse all but the literals, and it should then be syntactically valid Python code ("fast" to check), and then throw the literals in there. This might be a better representation to raise syntax errors from as well.

Note that this constant refactoring is an *option* to preparse_file that can be turned off.

Please let me know if you consider my approach of breaking the API unsuitable, and if I should follow proper deprecation procedures instead. If so, getting a clean interface for all of this might require several years: I'd first introduce a keyword argument to `extract_numeric_literals` and deprecate calls without that, then I'd make code always follow the new behavior and deprecate calls with that argument. Two deprecation steps, means two years minimum.

Please also let me know what you thing of *always* placing all assignments into the first line, now that doing so should be possible without trouble from the preparser.

I'll not be able to work on this for the next few weeks, or even respond to input. If someone else wants to take this up and push it through review, be my guest. Otherwise I'll request review at some point next month.

Unfortunately, that's a bad idea. The normal behaviour is that during exception raising, nothing is printed. Only once the exception reaches the REPL top level does the traceback get printed, and in a way that is subject to hooks.

Printing something that belongs in the traceback could get lost (if stdout is not stderr) or reach an inappropriate location (imagine that this routine itself is run inside a try/except where the exception is supposed to be caught).

I think the better solution here is to test if the failure of the "try" body is in the way that warrants the information contained in "print" and then raise an appropriate, new exception with an informative message (possibly with bits extracted from the original exception) and otherwise just raise, without printing new information.

If the "try" body fails in an expected way then the traceback from there shouldn't be relevant, so a fresh exception is OK. Otherwise the exception should appear uncaught.

Replying to [nbruin](#comment%3A17).

Thanks for the feedback. The situation is the following: we see an exception for *any* kind of syntax error, and the exception itself will likely contain code snippets describing its location, but these code snippets are neither for the code the user entered, nor for the code which will eventually get executed, but instead contains some dummy values in place of literals.

Perhaps I should do the following: try to parse the code with the actual values plugged back in, and if that throws, let the exception escape. If not, raise a new exception about there (probably?) being an assignment to a literal. Will write code for that soon.
