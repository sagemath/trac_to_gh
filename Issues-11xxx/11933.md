This patch fixes some doctest failures for the [experimental package](http://www.sagemath.org/packages/experimental/) qepcad and also fixes the formatting of the doctests.

This is only tested on x86_64 Linux (I tried installing on 32-bit i386 Linux but that failed).

As far as I can tell, the nonsubstantive changes are all fine, with the possible exception of the bullet lists toward the end, which could conceivably not be at an appropriate indentation level.  This is not in the reference manual, so I can't check that, but the other changes you made are good, and I assume that the bullets will render properly.

It also failed on Mac OS X 10.6.  

I'll try to test this on sage.math momentarily for the term order changes, then it could go to positive review.
