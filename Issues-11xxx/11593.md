The quotient and the remainder of 0(=self) divided by other is 0 and 0. So self, self is correct.

By the way, I did not care for this patch for a while. It needs to be rebased for the current Sage beta. I can't do it right away. I would appreciate if you do it.

I corrected a bug in _inplace_truncate, which is of only internal use, unlike the truncate method defined just above it. It's correct behaviour is indirectly checked by other methods that use it in various places.
 
On the other hand, the procedure is quite self-explanatory by its name and the short code, and I doubt the value of a documentation for it.

I think the doctest explains it pretty well: it is a conversion from `Q[x]/(x^6 - x^4 - 5*x^2 - 3)` to `Q[x]` which matters.
