In the file `sage/tests/interrupt.pyx` there is a test for a segmentation fault by explicitly dereferencing a NULL pointer.  However, on some systems (Mac OS X 10.4 PPC, Mac OS X 10.4 Intel, and Mac OS X 10.5.8 Intel) this generates a SIGBUS instead of a SIGSEGV.

Updated patch.  Only change is this comment (changed to reflect that various Mac OS X systems have this issue):

```
# Dereference a NULL pointer on purpose. This signals a SIGSEGV on most
# systems, but on older Mac OS X and possibly other systems, this
# signals a SIGBUS instead. In any case, this should give some signal.
