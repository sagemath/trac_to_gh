This patch extends toric ideals to work over bases rings 
that are fraction fields of a polynomial ring.

```
sage: A = matrix([[1,1,1],[0,1,2]])
sage: ToricIdeal(A, names='x', base_ring=FractionField(QQ['t']))
Ideal (-x1^2 + x0*x2) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x0, x1, x2 over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
```
