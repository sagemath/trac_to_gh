I think that using a method is a preferred way to get a property of an object rather than using an attribute, in Sage. So the attribute "blocks" of TermOrder is now a method. Use 

t.blocks()

instead of 

t.blocks

Perhaps this change will require a deprecation warning. I am not sure how to do this for attributes.

Regarding to converting "blocks" to "blocks()", Jason remarks:

To my understanding, we prefer methods to properties because:

1. Methods have docstrings and can be introspected (using question mark)
to obtain the docs.

2. We want to be consistent, as it can be confusing for a user if some
things require parentheses (methods) while others don't (properties).

I really wish we could use properties more, as it is more pythonic and
looks cleaner, but those are two good points above...

   * `pbori.pyx` I didn't fix the patch to apply cleanly, hence was to be expected that this one fails.

So, the only real issue seems to be pickling.

I rebased the patch on 4.7.rc2. pbori.pyx is no longer a problem.

I am not familiar with pickling. As I understand it, the patch modified the data structure of TermOrder objects in such an incompatible way that the old pickled TermOrder objects stored in the "pickle jar" of Sage is no longer properly unpickled. So it is not a bug of the patch but an incompatible change in the data structure that cause the unpickling failures. Please confirm this.

I don't know what to do with this. A quick way to fix this is just to update the "pickle jar" of Sage, and, perhaps, this is up to the release manager, and perhaps a consensus in sage-devel is required. My reference is

I change the status of this ticket to "needs review" to get attention. Is "needs info" the right status?

Your technical description seems right. However, in Sage's convention it is considered a bug if the pickle jar breaks.

This is not what is supposed to happen. The point of the pickle jar is to ensure old objects can be unpickled.

**needs info** or **needs work** are both fine as far as I understand it.

You can start debugging it by calling 

```
sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all("YOUR_SAGE_ROOT/data/extcode/pickle_jar/pickle_jar.tar.bz2")
```

I'll also try to take a look soon-ish.

There was a bug in the matrix order of Sage, which did not allow negative integers in the matrix. This is fixed in the current patch.

> I kept double underscores in the new patch. I don't know why Martin do not like double underscore attributes. Do you think single underscore attributes are generally preferable over double ones? Or is it just for fixing unpickling problem.

As Martin said, double underscore attributes can be a problem in sub-classes. To be precise: We talk about an attribute whose name starts with two underscores but ends with less than two underscores. It is a Python convention that those attributes are private. And in order to emphasize the privacy, Python applies so-called name mangling (easy to google): The attribute name is mangled with the name of the class *for which it was originally defined*.

By consequence, there is a problem for subclasses:

```
sage: class A:
....:     def __init__(self,n):
....:         self.__n = n
....:
sage: class B(A):
....:     def __init__(self,n):
....:         A.__init__(self,n^2)
....:
sage: b = B(5)
sage: b.__n
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/king/<ipython console> in <module>()

AttributeError: B instance has no attribute '__n'
```
So, surprise: `__n` seems gone. But it is there, under a different name:

```
sage: b._A__n
25
```

It is obvious that, under these circumstances, single underscore names are easier to deal with.

Remark: No mangling occurs if the name *ends* with two underscores. That's why all the magical methods `__repr__`, `__add__` etc. can be easily inherited.

<a id='comment:15'>Comment 15:</a>
Concerning unpickling of old pickles, I think the following holds in this case:

The pickling of a `TermOrder` is actually quite simple, standard Python.
It is an object with a `__dict__`, and a new un-initialised instance can be created with `__new__`.

**Example**

First, we obtain an order:

```
sage: P.<x,y>=QQ[]
sage: T = P.term_order()
```

Now, if I am not mistaken, `S=loads(dumps(T))` essentially boils down to
the following.
First, we create a new instance of the class:

```
sage: S = T.__new__(T.__class__)
```
And then, we provide the new instance with a copy of the old
instance's `__dict__`:

```
sage: S.__dict__ = copy(T.__dict__)
```

As a result, we have a copy of T:

```
  sage: S
  Degree reverse lexicographic term order
  sage: S == T
  True
  sage: S is T
  False
```

If I understand correctly, the problem here is that your patch
introduces a new attribute `_weights`, that has a default value for
trivial degree weights. So, if `__dict__` was taken from an old pickle,
then it lacks the key `'_weights'`. Hence, requesting `S._weights` would
fail.

Two solutions were suggested:

1. Introduce a `__getattr__` method, that returns the default weights and puts them into `S.__dict__['_weights']`. That ensures that `S.__getattr__('_weights')` is called at most once: `__getattr__` is only called if an attribute can not be found in the `__dict__` and not as a class attribute.

2. Introduce the default `_weights` as a class attribute. If a term order has non-default weights then they are put into `__dict__` (this is what happens if you do `T._weights = [1,2,3]`). But attributes found in `__dict__` have precedence over class attributes. Hence, the class attribute will only be considered if `_weights` is not in `__dict__`.

It seems to me that in both cases unpickling of old pickles should just work. One should test, though, whether one of the solutions has a speed penalty. I reckon that introducing `__getattr__` may slow things down. How often are attributes of a term order called when you do polynomial arithmetic?

To Simon,

I should say, I also don't like double underscored attributes. I just inherited them from previous authors of the class. 

The unpickling problem is more complicated than what you think. There is a change in not only in the data structure but also in the logic. I made this change in order to deal with block term orders of whatever constituent term orders.

Therefore the solution you suggest is not suitable to solve this problem. Also in my point of view, even if it's possible, it would introduce lots of code into the main body of the TermOrder class, just to solve the unpickling problem of old objects!

I believe using `__setstate__` method is the most simple and natural way to solve the problem. Actually, this is the way the Python documentation, which I quoted in the sage-dev thread, recommends to solve such problems. The documentation also suggest to put the version information into the pickled objects, which I think is a nice way to build the infrastructure that I suggested in the sage-dev thread. Let me expound on this more in the following.

Let's assume pickled objects have "_version" attribute with them. This attribute may be added only just before pickling. Then a developer, who made a big change in the logic and data of the class of the objects, add a translating method for the objects pickled before this change to the class, perhaps with a name like "_translate_for_sage_4_7" or "_upgrade_for_sage_4_7". The translating method is automatically invoked by `__setstate__` method in the SageObject class when unpickling objects before Sage 4.7, perhaps with issuing a warning message to the user. Another developer may add another translating method like "_translate_for_sage_4_8". Then unpickling procedure invoke the two traslating method sequentially so that old objects is translated first for Sage 4.7 then for Sage 4.8. Of course, this is only sketchy and to be elaborated much.

I guess without such an infrastructure, developers will get discouraged to change internals of classes to enhance Sage, because of the inevitable unpickling problem. 

By the way, it is easy to change the double underscored attributes into single underscored ones with `__setstate__` method.

I am sorry if this is the case.\n\nTo sum it up:\n\n1. Concerning data structure: You merely add one attribute with a default value. That's just a trivial change of data structure. Certainly it can not seriously be named a change in logic.\n\n2. Breaking the pickle jar for the sake of the trivial addition of an attribute is a no-go.\n\n3. As much as I see, absolutely *any* unpickling problem can be solved without to change the main code body.\n\n4. Here, the unpickling problem could be solved by replacing your `__setstate__` method with *a single line of code*.\n\n5. There is no need to introduce a `_translate_for_sage_x_y`. It suffices when developers understand how different ways of serialisation in Python and Cython work. Moreover, adding such method to any (existing) class in Sage and for any future version of Sage would be an unacceptable burden upon the developers.\n\nLet me elaborate on some of the points above.\n\nYou said that it is a change of internal data structure and now you even name it a change in logic.

<a id='comment:18'>Comment 18:</a>
Attachment: **[trac_11316.3.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11316/trac_11316.3.patch.gz)**

Before I submit my post: I am very tired, and that may imply that my text became more harsh than I intended it to be. I am sorry if this is the case.

To sum it up:

1. Concerning data structure: You merely add one attribute with a default value. That's just a trivial change of data structure. Certainly it can not seriously be named a change in logic.

2. Breaking the pickle jar for the sake of the trivial addition of an attribute is a no-go.

3. As much as I see, absolutely *any* unpickling problem can be solved without to change the main code body.

4. Here, the unpickling problem could be solved by replacing your `__setstate__` method with *a single line of code*.

5. There is no need to introduce a `_translate_for_sage_x_y`. It suffices when developers understand how different ways of serialisation in Python and Cython work. Moreover, adding such method to any (existing) class in Sage and for any future version of Sage would be an unacceptable burden upon the developers.

Let me elaborate on some of the points above.

You said that it is a change of internal data structure and now you even name it a change in logic. But frankly, the simple addition of one attribute does not even qualify as a change of data structure, IMHO. You did not change the meaning of existing attributes, or did you? That's the point that I already tried to make in my previous posts.

What counts in Python is the question whether an attribute exists and what value it has. Your code works if the new attribute `__weights` exists and has either the value `None` or provides degree weights.

Thus, *any* way of providing the default value `None` for `__weights` when reading an old pickle would be just fine, without changing the main body of your code.

We are discussing three ways of providing the default value: `__setstate__`, `__getattr__` and a class attribute. Since the rest of your code won't change, it should be easy to implement each of the three approaches, and test how they perform.

My guess is that `__getattr__` would slow things down. `__setstate__` (your current solution) will probably be fine, performance-wise, but it is more code than providing a class attribute (which is just *one line of code*!).

But I want to see tests!

> Therefore the solution you suggest is not suitable to solve this problem.

Did you try? I doubt that you did.

> Also in my point of view, even if it's possible, it would introduce lots of code into the main body of the TermOrder class, just to solve the unpickling problem of old objects!

Lots of code???? We are talking about one single line!!

Namely:
Remove the `__setstate__` that you recently added. Instead, insert the line

```
    __weights = None
```
right after the doc string of the class. Then, `__weights` becomes a class attribute, and `None` will be available as the default value that you are using anyway. There will be no change whatsoever in the main code body!

To avoid misunderstanding: The line should *not* be inserted into the `__init__` method. This is since the `__init__` method will not be invoked at unpickling.

Apart from that: I doubt that there is any unpickling problem whose resolution would involve a change in the main body of code.

Namely: There are different ways of pickling. But each relies on well-localised things, for example methods: `__getinitargs__` or `__getstate__` or `__reduce__`; or it relies on the simple fact that Python saves `__dict__` (that's the case in your example).

Unpickling is local as well. It relies on `__init__` or `__setstate__` or an unpickling function.

Hence, the changes needed to solve any unpickling problem are local to these methods, with the only exception of `__dict__`. But this problem can be solved locally as well, as we have seen. QED.

> I believe using `__setstate__` method is the most simple and natural way to solve the problem. 

It is debatable whether a lengthy `__setstate__` method that internally constructs a temporary term order just for getting one default value is simpler and more natural than a single line of code.

> Actually, this is the way the Python documentation, which I quoted in the sage-dev thread, recommends to solve such problems.

That would be the case for more difficult examples. But the addition of one attribute with default value `None` is not difficult.

> The translating method is automatically invoked by `__setstate__` method in the SageObject class when unpickling objects before Sage 4.7, perhaps with issuing a warning message to the user. 

There are different ways of pickling/unpickling. Not all of them involve a `__setstate__` method. And issuing a warning message is not an acceptable option.

> Another developer may add another translating method like "_translate_for_sage_4_8".

You see the induction? 4_7, 4_8, 5_0, 5_1? That's not practical, and also not needed.

> I guess without such an infrastructure, developers will get discouraged to change internals of classes to enhance Sage, because of the inevitable unpickling problem. 

I really think you overestimate the difficulty of unpickling. And it will most certainly discourage developers if they suddenly have to maintain a `_translate_from_` method for any class they ever wrote.

Here is a further way to solve the problem.

I noticed that you use a method `is_weighted_degree_order` for testing whether `__weights` is not None, and you consequently use it (hence, you do not have `if self.__weights is not None`) in other parts of your code. That is good!

If you have an old pickle then `__weights` is not present. Hence, `self.__weights` will result in an attribute error, and this error indicates that you have no weighted degree order.

Hence, the fourth suggestion is to remove `__setstate__`, and to simply rewrite `is_weighted_degree_order` as follows:

```
def is_weighted_degree_order(self):
    try:
        return self.__weights is not None
    except AttributeError:
        self.__weights = None
        return False
```

That's another clean solution. There might be additional changes in your code needed, but I guess these changes would be minor.

I would like to see timings for all four solutions. Namely, it may be that frequent calls to functions like `is_weighted_degree_order` slows down arithmetic.

By the way: I think that the addition of weighted degree orders is no "minor" extension. Therefore I'm bumping up the priority of this ticket.

Hi Kwankyu,

Replying to [@kwankyu](#comment%3A23):
> There is more change in the logic than mere adding one attribute, Simon.

Yep, meanwhile I noticed it (see my previous post), and also I got more sleep.

> Adding just `__weights=None` when unpickling old `TermOrder(``lex(2),degrevlex(3)``) will result in unpickling failure. I hope Martin come up and confirm this.

I can confirm it as well.

I found that adding `_weights=None` and `_blocks=()` made it possible to read old pickles even without `__setstate__`, but then the semantical change of `_name` and `blocks` struck.
 
> The third patch applies cleanly to Sage 4.7 and there is no doctest failure. On my part, the patch is quite satisfactory and the unpickling problem is elegantly solved. :-) So I feel no need to spend more time on this.

I still find it awkward to create a temporary term order in `__setstate__`. However, it works.

> As Burcin suggested, if this patch would be merged to Sage, we have to mention for breaking backward compatibility (by removing `block` attribute) in the release notes.  

In the release notes and also in the documentation.

There would be the possibility to find a different name than `blocks()` in order to avoid a name conflict with an old attribute. But I think `blocks()` is a better name than, e.g., `block_list()`.

So, for now, I have no objections against the third patch version. I'll probably give it a positive review after reading it thoroughly (including the documentation) and running the doctests.

I am checking the documentation, and tried to add some more examples that expose the use of degree weights, and I found one problem.

In the documentation, there is no statement on what values are allowed as degree weights. So, I assume that any real number is allowed (but this should be stated in the docs as well). In particular, negative degree weights should be allowed (this is something that I use in my current project).

So, I tested

```
sage: N.<a,b,c> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 3, order=TermOrder('wdeglex',[-1,2,-3]))
sage: c<a^2<1
True
```
which is correct.

But the conversion to Singular fails:

```
sage: T = N.term_order()
sage: T.singular_str() # this is correct as well
'Wp(-1,2,-3)'
sage: singular(N)

```

I assume that the example *should* work. And in Singular, it *does* work:

```

```

So, I'm putting it as "needs work".

... and the reason for the error is that the the string representation of polynomials does not correctly deal with polynomials of negative degree:

```
sage: str(N.gens())
'(0*a, 0*b, 0*c)'
```
That should be '(a, b, c)'.

Looking at `a._repr_`, I see that in fact Singular is to blame. And indeed, in Singular we have

```
> ring r = 0,(a,b,c),Wp(-1,2,-3);
> b;
0b
> ring r = 0,(a,b,c),Wp(1,2,0);
// ** redefining r **
> b;
0b
```

So, there is a bug in Singular that should be reported upstream.

Nevertheless, I think it should be addressed here, namely by stating in the documentation that the weights have to be positive integral. I can do that in a reviewer patch, if you like.

Singular states in its documentation that [the degrees for wp need to be positive integral](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/latest/sing_743.htm#IDX289). So, they may not acknowledge that it is a bug. But I will try.

Or it can be solved on the side of Sage. Namely, while Singular does not allow the weighted order `wp(1,2,0)`, it *does* allow to provide the `dp` order with an additional weight vector, and this weight vector can contain negative numbers:

```
> ring r = 0,(a,b,c),(a(1,-2,0),dp);
> a,b,c;  // so, printing in Singular is correct
a b c

```

Couldn't we change the method `TermOrder.singular_str()`, such that `(a(...),dp)` is used if there is any non-positive weight?

sage: t = TermOrder('a(1,-2,0),dp',n=3,force=True)
sage: t
a(1,-2,0),dp term order

But this reveals a bug in dealing with the `force` argument in the current patch. So I prepared a fourth patch to fix this bug. I will shortly upload the fourth patch, after doctesting. Then you can experiment.

With the fourth patch, it is still allowed to do

```
sage: N.<a,b,c> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 3, order=TermOrder('wdeglex',[0,-2,3]))
```

There should an error be raised, because negative degrees do not work at all, due to the limitations imposed by Singular:

```
sage: a
0*a
```

Another example:

```
sage: N.<a,b,c> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 3, order=TermOrder('wdeglex',[1.1,2,3]))
sage: a.degree()
1
```
Hence, one may think that the degree is converted to an integer. But in fact the "broken" value of the degree is still hanging around:

```
sage: singular(N)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: Singular error:
   ? no ring active
   ? error occurred in or before STDIN line 27: `ring sage7=0,(a, b, c),Wp(1.10000000000000,2,3);`
   ? expected ring-expression. type 'help ring;'
```

I am not sure what to do in the second case: Raise an error, or silently convert `1.1` to `1`?

I was reading the patch, and it seems ok. Meanwhile I think that `__setstate__` is the best way to solve the unpickling problem for old pickles, given the fact that both name and meaning of several attributes have changed. I can confirm that old pickles can be correctly unpickled, including a block order (the old attribute `blocks` does not override the new method `blocks()`).

Having weighted degree orders is a good thing. There are some limitations inherited from Singular: The degree weights have to be positive integers.

I give a positive review, and add a reviewer patch, which I hope is fine for you.

The reviewer patch adds to the docs that the degree weights must be positive integers, and it lets an error be raised if any weight is non-positive. It is attempted to convert any non-integral weight to an integer. In particular, a weight such as `1.1` will silently be converted into `1`. There are doctests for that behaviour.

Also, I add a comment in the doc of the new method `blocks()`, stating that back in the old days some orders had an attribute of the same name, so that we have a backward incompatible (but apparently not problematic) change.

So, if you don't oppose against my reviewer patch:

Apply trac_11316.4.patch trac11316_reviewer.patch

I have no account on `t2` but I could test on `mark2` instead (but this will take a while, that is a very slow machine).

I am not able to build Sage on `mark2` (GNUTLS fails).  I don't know how the buildbot manages.

Too bad. I am now trying to build on mark -- no idea whether it will work, of course.

One question: Wouldn't it be possible to use the Sage version that was built by the buildbot?

As much as I understand, the ticket here is independent from #11431, right?

It turned out that the Solaris problem pointed out by Jeroen exists in a fresh sage-4.7.1.rc1 installation on mark. In particular, the problem was definitely not introduced by the patch here.
