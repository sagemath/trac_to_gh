```
The pretty_print function currently takes only one argument. This somehow makes it difficult to print multiple things in one line, for instance the following is currently not possible:

```
A = identity_matrix(2); pretty_print("A = ", A)
```
with the output being "A = <the matrix A on the same line>"

I am attaching a patch which allows pretty_print to take in multiple arguments. It is based on some code by _leif @ #sagemath (See http://sagenb.org/home/pub/3111/ ). Also kini @ #sagemath helped in passing the doctests.

The modifications are to 1) the function pretty_print 2) the doctests in pretty_print 3) the doctest in pretty_print_default (whitespace issues)

I would also suggest that if the function is going to accept more than one argument, then the documentation shouldn't say

```
Try to pretty print an object in an intelligent way.
```
but rather something like

```
Try to pretty print the arguments in an intelligent way.
```
The `INPUT` block should be changed, also.

Actually, #11498 fixed a *lot* of latex related output but with it something like the following no longer works: `view('$f(x) = x^2$')`.

It seems to me that the fix for this, if any, will be a lot more invasive and won't be confined to the `pretty_print` function any more.

It is a massive cleanup of the code.\n\n@jhpalmieri there is a way. You can simply do `html('$f(x) = x^2$')`. But it doesn't retain the blue color and it won't work with the `viewer=pdf` setting. So, modifying `view()` and thereabouts (maybe `list_function` or `tuple_function` too) is probably the only way to implement it now, while still retaining these earlier functionality.",

> Are you suggesting to reopen #11498?

No. Please don't reopen #11498. It is a massive cleanup of the code.

@jhpalmieri there is a way. You can simply do `html('$f(x) = x^2$')`. But it doesn't retain the blue color and it won't work with the `viewer=pdf` setting. So, modifying `view()` and thereabouts (maybe `list_function` or `tuple_function` too) is probably the only way to implement it now, while still retaining these earlier functionality.

Updated patch to make it work with Typeset on or off, and also take in multiple arguments. Passes doctests: `../../sage -t -long ./sage/misc`.

The `view()`, `tuple_function()`, `latex()` and `JSMath()` in `devel/sage/sage/misc/latex.py` have been updated to take in an extra argument `combine_all`. The way it works is:

1. if `combine_all` is `True` then the string returned by `tuple_function` does not return a tuple and it instead combines all the elements it receives. It *does not* collapse a tuple inside a tuple.

2. if `combine_all` is `False` (the default) then everything behaves as earlier.

3. `combine_all` is passed as `True` from `pretty_print` whenever it calls the `view()` function.

Updated patch to mathjax based sagenb. Apply [new patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11775/trac_11775-pretty_print_multiple_args_mathjax.patch.gz) only after applying patches from #9774.

Otherwise the old patch should apply just fine.

It passes doctests in `sage/misc` except for the [two (unrelated) failures](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9774#comment:64) stemming from the mathjax patch in #9774 and also these (unrelated) ones:
