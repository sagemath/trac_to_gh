The pretty_print function currently takes only one argument. This somehow makes it difficult to print multiple things in one line, for instance the following is currently not possible:

```
A = identity_matrix(2); pretty_print("A = ", A)
```
with the output being "A = <the matrix A on the same line>"

I am attaching a patch which allows pretty_print to take in multiple arguments. It is based on some code by _leif `@` #sagemath (See http://sagenb.org/home/pub/3111/ ). Also kini `@` #sagemath helped in passing the doctests.

The modifications are to 1) the function pretty_print 2) the doctests in pretty_print 3) the doctest in pretty_print_default (whitespace issues)

Actually, #11498 fixed a *lot* of latex related output but with it something like the following no longer works: `view('$f(x) = x^2$')`.

It seems to me that the fix for this, if any, will be a lot more invasive and won't be confined to the `pretty_print` function any more.

Updated patch to make it work with Typeset on or off, and also take in multiple arguments. Passes doctests: `../../sage -t -long ./sage/misc`.

The `view()`, `tuple_function()`, `latex()` and `JSMath()` in `devel/sage/sage/misc/latex.py` have been updated to take in an extra argument `combine_all`. The way it works is:

1. if `combine_all` is `True` then the string returned by `tuple_function` does not return a tuple and it instead combines all the elements it receives. It *does not* collapse a tuple inside a tuple.

2. if `combine_all` is `False` (the default) then everything behaves as earlier.

3. `combine_all` is passed as `True` from `pretty_print` whenever it calls the `view()` function.

Updated patch to mathjax based sagenb. Apply [attachment:trac_11775-pretty_print_multiple_args_mathjax.patch new patch] only after applying patches from #9774.

Otherwise the old patch should apply just fine.

It passes doctests in `sage/misc` except for the [two (unrelated) failures](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9774#comment:64) stemming from the mathjax patch in #9774 and also these (unrelated) ones:
