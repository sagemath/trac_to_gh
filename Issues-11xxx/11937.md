The doctest in gap_reps.py

```
EllipticCurve([Integer(1),-Integer(1),Integer(1),-Integer(2680),-Integer(50053)]).galois_representation().image_type(Integer(7))    # long time
```
fails by doctest -long when Kash is installed:

```
Expected:
    'The image is a group of order 18.'
Got:
    'The image is a non-abelian group of order 18.'
```
That error is hidden by the doctest command mentioned in #11936, which produces a timeout.

Apply [attachment:trac_11937_gal_reps_doctest_fail_wrong_output.4.patch] to the Sage library.
