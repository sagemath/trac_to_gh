sage: An error occurred while installing maxima-5.23.2.p0
...
```
This happened because `HOME` was set to `/home/leif`, but `/home` wasn't mounted (on the machine I was building on).

The first error message is quite precise, but the failure seems odd.

I have no idea (at the moment) why Maxima tries to access (or at least checks the validity of) `$HOME` at all.

It is very odd indeed. I am expecting that it just check the existence of HOME and doesn't write anything there. We would have sandbox violation while building maxima in Gentoo otherwise (outside of sage that is).

Maybe you don't have `HOME` set there at all?

OTOH Sage always sets `HOME` if it isn't already.

Still weird that the file `cp` wants to copy apparently doesn't get built (or renamed / copied / whatever to the proper one) in this case. We've seen the same error on other(?) occasions already...

I confirm the failure.

In `spkg-install` I changed the following command sequence:

```
#build maxima as a lisp library
#and install it in the ecl library directory

cd src
echo "building Maxima as an ecl library"
mkdir ./lisp-cache 

export HOME=/does/not/exist ### I added this line

ecl \
  -eval '(require `asdf)' \
  -eval '(setf asdf::*user-cache* (truename "./lisp-cache"))' \
  -eval '(load "maxima-build.lisp")' \
  -eval '(asdf:make-build :maxima :type :fasl :move-here ".")' \
  -eval '(quit)' 
```
as a consequence, the call to `asdf:make-build` fails with a complaint about "/" not existing (whereas of course it's "/does" that does not exist, just as in the reported case where the mount point "/home" probably does exist). Apparently, asdf feels the need to resolve the path in "$HOME". asdf is the "make/build" tool for common lisp and is quite complex. Note that `asdf::*user-cache*` normally points to a directory in "$HOME".

There are very few people who grok asdf and fewer who are familiar with ecl's implementation specifics. It might be that asdf has other business in $HOME than just *user-cache* and that this is causing the path resolution request.

You could consider reporting upstream but I'm not sure that the observed behaviour should be considered a bug.

The fact that spkg-install fails on the cp and not on ecl is that I am not sure that a failed build results in an error code from ecl. The present approach is plainly phenomenological: If "maxima.fasb" is present then obviously the build succeeded. If it isn't the copy will fail and trigger an appropriate check-error.

(".fasb" is produced by asdf to not clash with ecl's "native" build system that produces ".fas". The file is the same format and renaming to ".fas" is safe. I think ecl is increasingly embracing asdf as the build-tool of choice)

With `HOME=/does/not/exist`, I get:

```
...

An error occurred during initialization:

 2) we are not allow to access the file, or
 3) the pathname points to a broken symbolic link..
;;; Note:

ecl ... asdf:make-build :maxima ... returned 1
```
(Just added an `echo "... $?"`.)

So certainly the exit code should be checked in `spkg-install`.

It's funny though that first an error message is printed, but apparently *afterwards* an "external command" still gets invoked. Perhaps just the output streams aren't in sync, or asdf does some kind of parallel make. So this *might* be a (minor) bug.




FWIW,

```sh
$ (unset HOME; ./sage -f spkg/standard/maxima-5.23.2.p0.spkg)
```
works.

So we may unset it in `spkg-install`, perhaps only if it really doesn't exist (or isn't readable / `cd`'able; `test -d`, `-r`, `-x`).

```

So I'd say it's a bug that not being able to `stat` `$HOME` is treated as a fatal error.

The truncated error message ("`/ does not exist`") is of course a bug.

Yep. I'm still not sure whether this is due to Maxima or ECL (or asdf).

From ECL's perspective, it is pretty ok, or even desirable, to look for some user files below `$HOME`. Raising a fatal error if this fails is of course not, unless some files from there were really needed.

And the crippled error message (the truncated directory name) remains.

I wonder how much time ECL overall spends re-stating the same files again and again, and in system calls writing strings one by one character... m)

For info I got HOME wrong for root (it is "/" really) and reproduced the problem with maxima-5.25.1 and an external asdf (it is definitely used) on Gentoo. Of course ecl could read configuration in $HOME, I guess I overstated that it shouldn't write.

I am guessing the error is really that ecl cannot enter the directory, it has no problem with the files not existing so it has to be getting to the folder.
