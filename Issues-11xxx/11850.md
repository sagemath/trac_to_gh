I don't think this code

```python
sum(g * self.ring().random_element(degree - g.degree(), *args, **kwds) for g in self.gens()) 
```
returns a uniformly random element up to the given degree.

* one should at least use the Gr√∂bner basis instead of gens()
* even then I don't think this code returns uniformly random elements up to some degree, because of potential cancellations. 

I suggest to do:

```python
f = P.random_element()
f = f - f.reduce(self)
```

which is "as random" as `P.random_element()` because `P = I \oplus P/I`.

In case you are wondering: sampling uniform from an ideal given a set of generators is as hard as computing the GB (at least for dense/zero-dimensional systems):
