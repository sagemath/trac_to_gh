  * #9808 Upgrade to scipy 0.8.
  * Deleted outdated patches
  * spkg install changed by F. Bissey, because g95 makes trouble on OS X.
```

(The merger script is btw. likely to reject the spkg otherwise.)




`spkg-install` isn't executable.

GNU patch should be added to the dependencies.  (See diff above).

```sh
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error patching setup.py"
    exit 1
fi
```
should get removed, since no patch gets applied to `setup.py`.

There are a few typos in the comments, and `spkg-install` lacks the usual sanity check.

(Take whatever you like, or I could upload an updated spkg.)

I'm not sure whether we should only remove an old installation upon a successful build, after `python setup.py build`, but before running `python setup.py install`.
