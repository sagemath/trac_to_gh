Suppose one has a file named aap.sage with the following contents:

```
class Aap(SageObject):
    pass  # Minimum example
```
and a file named noot.sage that looks like:

```
class Noot(Aap):
    pass  # Minimum example
```
Okay, and suppose one attaches both files:

```
sage: attach aap.sage
sage: attach noot.sage
```
After working with both files for a while, one changes something in the class Aap and the file aap.sage becomes:

```
class Aap(SageObject):
    def mies(self):
        print "Wim, zus, Jet!"
```
Now suppose that, *after* this change, one initializes a Noot object:

```
sage: noot = Noot()
```
Then the following gives an error:

```
sage: noot.mies()
...
AttributeError: 'Noot' object has no attribute 'mies'
```
If, instead, one re-attaches the files, everything works fine:

```
sage: attach aap.sage
sage: attach noot.sage
sage: noot = Noot()
sage: noot.mies()
Wim, zus, Jet!
```
Of course, the whole point of attaching files is that one shouldn't have to re-attach them.

Possible solution: make 2 different modes, one in which only changed files are reloaded (speed), and one in which every file is reloaded as soon as one changes (solves your problem).

The new patch I'm writing at #11812 also introduces different modes: one in which sage files are preparsed through memory and one in which they are preparsed through a file. #11812 will have a big overlap with #11925. This means that maybe I could do both tickets at once, but at the very least one ticket should depend on the other to avoid conflicting patches.

Starting from #11812, this would mean extending sage.misc.preparser.load_attach_mode with an option like "reload_all", and to change sage.misc.preparser.modified_attached_files accordingly.

Workaround: end aap.sage with `load noot.sage`

That way, when aap.sage changes and is reloaded, noot.sage is loaded afterwards.
