Suppose one has a file named aap.sage with the following contents:

```
class Aap(SageObject):
    pass  # Minimum example
```
and a file named noot.sage that looks like:

```
class Noot(Aap):
    pass  # Minimum example
```
Okay, and suppose one attaches both files:

```
sage: attach aap.sage
sage: attach noot.sage
```
After working with both files for a while, one changes something in the class Aap and the file aap.sage becomes:

```
class Aap(SageObject):
    def mies(self):
        print "Wim, zus, Jet!"
```
Now suppose that, *after* this change, one initializes a Noot object:

```
sage: noot = Noot()
```
Then the following gives an error:

```
sage: noot.mies()
...
AttributeError: 'Noot' object has no attribute 'mies'
```
If, instead, one re-attaches the files, everything works fine:

```
sage: attach aap.sage
sage: attach noot.sage
sage: noot = Noot()
sage: noot.mies()
Wim, zus, Jet!
```
Of course, the whole point of attaching files is that one shouldn't have to re-attach them.

The new patch I'm writing at #11812 also introduces different modes: one in which sage files are preparsed through memory and one in which they are preparsed through a file. #11812 will have a big overlap with #11925.

Starting from #11812, this would mean extending sage.misc.preparser.load_attach_mode with an option like "reload_all", and to change sage.misc.preparser.modified_attached_files accordingly.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Workaround: end aap.sage with `load noot.sage`

That way, when aap.sage changes and is reloaded, noot.sage is loaded afterwards.
