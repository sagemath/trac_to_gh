You are a brave lady Mariah - any code in SYMPOW is difficult to understand. Bill  Hart described it as "virtually obfuscated". Unfortunately, since it not actually standard C (the Sun compiler wont compile it), it can't be entered into The International Obfuscated C Code Contest

http://www.ioccc.org/

I particualry like SYMPOW's Configure script

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/bad-code/sympow-1.018.1.p7/src/Configure

which starts off

```
#!/bin/sh
```

then later has a test to see if sh exists on the system!

```
SH=`whichexe sh` && echo "#define SH \"$SH\"" >> $CONFIG
if [ -z "$SH" ]; then
  echo "**ERROR**: Could not find sh"; exit 1;
else
  echo "SH = $SH"
fi
```

Good luck Mariah - I don't envy you. 

Dave

Hi Mariah, 

the test in the code 

```
if [ "`uname -m`" = "ia64" ] && [ $CC = "gcc" ]; then 
```

will fail if CC is set to something like /usr/local/bin/gcc. In this case, $CC is not just gcc. 

I would suggest making use of the script `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/testcc.sh`, which actually compiles a bit of code and checks that `__GNU__` is defined. Then use something like the following, which I'm doing from memory and have not tested. 

```
if [ "x$UNAME" = xLinux ] && [ "x`$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/testcc.sh $CC`" = xGCC ] && [ "x`$CC -dumpversion 2>/dev/null`" = x4.6.0 ] ; then  
```

That will
* Ensure the test only gets performed on Linux. We currently have no evidence to assume this will be an issue on HP-UX, which also runs on the Itanium processor. 
* Since the first test uses $UNAME, it should be faster on non-Linux systems, as there is no need to call any external scripts or programs. 
* $CC really is a GNU-like compiler. 

You might want to review #11169 which changes the exit code of the script testcc.sh if it fails. But it wont effect your code here, as you are checking the text output.

Fair enough, so change the test to something like:

```
if [ "x`$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/testcc.sh $CC`" = xGCC ] && [ "x`$CC -dumpversion 2>/dev/null`" = x4.6.0 ] ; then  
```

then we will know it is gcc, even if someone sets the environment variable CC to be {{{/usr/local/bin/gcc}}

This release of gcc seems to have caused a fair number of problems for Sage. I'm not aware of any other gcc "upgrade" which has caused so much trouble.

The trac formatting has screwed that up a bit. The script `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/testcc.sh` checks if !__GNU!__ is defined (I have to put a couple of exclamation marks to escape the formatting, as two underscores causes the text to be underlined).

I simplified the testcase and came up with the following minimal code to demonstrate the problem:

```
extern int printf (__const char *__restrict __format, ...);

double p0 = 2.718281828459045091e+00;
double p1 = 1.445646891729250158e-16;
double q0 = 3.141592653589793116e+00;
double q1 = 1.224646799147353207e-16;

int main()
{
  double x;
  x = p0*q1 + p1*q0 + p0*q0;
  printf("%a\n", x);

  return 0;
}
```

Also, `-fno-expensive-optimizations` solves this problem.

I think that having the workaround for all versions 4.6.x doesn't really hurt. It is certainly a safer alternative than applying the workaround only for gcc 4.6.0. If at some point, this bug is fixed in a later gcc 4.6.x, then we can still change the spkg accordingly.

Never mind this, it will be fixed after positive_review.

I have changed the comment slightly to:

```
        echo "Detected GCC version `$CC -dumpversion` on Itanium. Adding"
        echo "work-around to fix a bug when sympow is compiled with gcc 4.6.0"
