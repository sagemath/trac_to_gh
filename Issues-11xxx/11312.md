My first implementation of the Hilbert basis eventually uses PALP to compute the points in the parallelotope spanned by the rays of a simplicial cone. This can be done much faster with just the Smith normal form of the ray matrix.

This makes it easy to compute the points in the semi-open parallelotope, so the actual number of semigroup generators is sometimes less than the PALP version (which computed the integral points in the closure). As a pleasant side effect, arbitrary dimension cones work now as we are no longer limited to PALP's compile-time bounds.

The speed-up looks impressive! About 20x on trivial examples (no surprise here since we are avoiding system calls to both cdd and PALP), on a "complicated" 6-d example that I picked the new version worked for 15sec and the old one didn't finish before my patience ran out ;-) Am I right that this speed is partially due to taking into account the special structure of the polytopes in which you are computing integral points?

There are, however, issues with non-full-dimensional cones::

```
sage: Cone([(1,1), (-1,1)], check=False).Hilbert_basis()
(N(1, 1), N(-1, 1), N(0, 1))
sage: Cone([(1,1,0), (-1,1,0)], check=False).Hilbert_basis()
(N(1, 1, 0), N(-1, 1, 0))
```
