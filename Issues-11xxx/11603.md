It is impossible to somehow reliably group eigenvectors of a numerical matrix into eigenspaces.  Right now, we just put each eigenvector into an eigenspace of its very own.  Rather than having this misleading output, the relevant functions are deprecated and users are pointed to the eigenmatrix routines, where they can deal with the eigenvectors as they see fit.
