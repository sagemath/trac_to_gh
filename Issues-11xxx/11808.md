```
With the current interface to the MPC library, you cannot add the symbolic `i` and MPC complex numbers:

```
sage: from sage.rings.complex_mpc import MPComplexField
sage: MPC = MPComplexField()
sage: MPC(1) + SR(i)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+':
'Complex Field with 53 bits of precision' and 'Symbolic Ring'
sage: SR(i) + MPC(1)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+':
'Symbolic Ring' and 'Complex Field with 53 bits of precision'
```

This works with "usual" complex numbers:

```
sage: CC(1) + SR(i)
1.00000000000000 + 1.00000000000000*I
```
and with the "number-field" version of `i`
(now the default after #18036):

```
sage: MPC(1) + i
1.00000000000000 + 1.00000000000000*I
```

<a id='comment:7'>**Comment 7:**</a>
Updating ticket description after #18036 was merged in 9.3.beta2.

This, which was failing in the original report, now works:

```
sage: MPC(1) + i
1.00000000000000 + 1.00000000000000*I
```
but this still fails:

```
sage: MPC(1) + SR(i)
```
