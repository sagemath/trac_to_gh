The scaling_term is documented in `Graph.plot?` but in fact does nothing.  Moreover, if passed to to `Graph.show` it returns an error.

I tried to look around on the documentation of matplotlib whether this could have matched one of their former parameters, but it looks like this "scaling_term" is a pure Sage invention. Weird. Neither have I any idea of what it could be transformed into.

We will probably be better without this in the documentation for the moment.
