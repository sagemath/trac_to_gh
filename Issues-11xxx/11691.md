<a id='comment:2'></a>I tried to look around on the documentation of matplotlib whether this could have matched one of their former parameters, but it looks like this "scaling_term" is a pure Sage invention. Weird. Neither have I any idea of what it could be transformed into.

We will probably be better without this in the documentation for the moment.
