I looked into the detex function. To me, it seems a little buggy.

1. "\ldots", "\cdots" are both converted to "...". Hence there is no reason not to convert "\dots" to "..."

2. There is a bug. For example "souldots" is converted to "sou...". That is, if there is a word which contains "ldots" or "cdots", it is shown broken in command line.

With the change for 'dots', I want to watch out not
to convert "The dots and boxes game has been thoroughly studied by
Elwyn Berlekamp in his book" to something nonsensical.
