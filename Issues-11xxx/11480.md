For matrices, `ZigZag` form is a precursor for a computation of the rational canonical form (and interesting in its own right).  Then we get rational form also, a canonical form computable over *any* field, which will make `is_similar()` bullet-proof.

Hi David,

Yes, this was a fun one.  And I plan to stitch it into `.is_similar()` to make that bullet-proof.

I was secretly hoping you were headed to this one after taking care of the companion matrix constructor.  Thanks very much for looking it over and carefully putting it through its paces.

Rob
