The environment variable `SAGE_PORT` 

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html

has to be set on systems such as AIX and HP-UX where Sage is not supported. Currently this is also so on Solaris x86, despite the fact Sage build fine and is fully supported on both OpenSolaris x86 and Solaris 10 x86:

http://wiki.sagemath.org/SupportedPlatforms

As such, the file

`$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/prereq-0.7-install`

needs to be changed to remove this specific test for Solaris on x86. There is also a minor typo with an "x" missing on a line where a test for Solaris 2.6 is performed. 

The new script will be installed as:

`$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/prereq-0.8-install` 

and the old one removed.

## Output on a Solaris x86 system
Here's the output shown with sage-4.7.alpha1 on a Solaris x86 system with the environment variable `SAGE_PORT` not set. 

```
Starting prerequisite check.
Machine: SunOS hawk 5.11 snv_134 i86pc i386 i86pc

Building or using Sage on non-Sparc Solaris is tricky and not supported
at the moment. It is possible, but you should be well aware that
some things do not work. Support for Solaris
on non-SPARC hardware is actively being worked on.

More information can be found about Sage on Solaris
on the Wiki at http://wiki.sagemath.org/solaris

To get past this message, export the variable SAGE_PORT to
something non-empty.

```

Here's the output of sage-4.7.alpha2, which has the changes applied. This time the *prereq* script gets run, without Sage exiting.

## Notes for reviewer
You only need to check the changes between the two scripts - ignore the tar file that the script opens. That is the subject of another ticket #9978. 

When testing, you will need to copy the file `prereq-0.8.tar` attached to #9978 to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/`. 

Both the script and the tar file must have the same version number (0.8). 

## Notes for the release manager
This ticket depends on #9978. This and #9978 must be updated together. Both have positive review. 
 
* The tar file `prereq-0.8.tar`, attached to #9978 should be installed as `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/prereq-0.8.tar`. It is listed in .hgignore,so there's no need to change the repository for this. 
* The tar file `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/prereq-0.7.tar` should be removed. 
* Apply [attachment:trac_11070-base-repo.patch] to the repository in spkg/base.

Hi Dave,

In principle this looks good.  One very minor change to the patch: add a period at the end of

```
echo "Sage is not supported on any version of Solaris earlier than 10" 
```
(You're deleting the following line, which has the period for that sentence.)

More importantly, though, I think that the file prereq-0.8-install should be added to the spkg/base repo, it should be executable, and prereq-0.7-install should be removed from the repo.  (I guess actually you should use hg to rename the 0.7 version to the 0.8 version, and then patch it.)  The .hgignore file should be modified, too, to include the new tar file, and I suppose it doesn't need to mention the old tar file. 

I'm attaching a mercurial patch which does these things, and I've committed it in your name.  Let me know if you have any objections.  Please take a look at the patch, and if you're happy with it, give the ticket a positive review.  (I'm happy with your changes, I just want to make sure you're happy with my implementation of them.)

Thank you John. 

Yes, your changes look fine to me. I was not aware exactly how to use Mercurial to rename the files. But I applied the Mercurial patch you created and it did the right things. 

I still need to get a positive review on the other half if this update of "prereq", which is on ticket #9978. If you have time, perhaps you could take a look at that.
