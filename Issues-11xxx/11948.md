Because the argument is converted to `float` first, the error function `erf()` cannot numerically be evaluated for complex arguments:

```
sage: erf(pi - 1/2*I).n()
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1108, 0))

Thanks for that info; I didn't realize it was the new Pari that made this possible.

I'd say that if someone reviews this, it should go in. #1173 is probably not going to get finished immediately, and we can always switch to mpmath if necessary or convenient or speedy at that time.

Looks good.  I've added a tiny bit of doc, because `erf?` gives something *very* short otherwise now, and fixed some grammar in the place where Jeroen did something I can't figure out with whitespace.   Docs still look fine there, so all seems well.  

Positive review, unless the author finds something he doesn't like about the review patch.

Unfortunately, this causes a nasty problem.

This example in the documentation is fine - comparing mpmath:

```
sage: mpmath.erf(pi-1/2*i)
mpc(real='1.0000111669099367', imag='1.6332655417638451e-6')
```

But anything along the imaginary axis seems to be off by exactly 1:

```
sage: for z in [3,33,333,3333,33333]:
....:     mpmath.erf(i*z); erf(n(z)*i)
....:     
mpc(real='0.0', imag='1629.9946226015657')
1.00000000000000 + 1629.86732385786*I
mpc(real='0.0', imag='1.5128697751040891e+471')
1.00000000000000 + 1.51286977510409e471*I
mpc(real='0.0', imag='5.1260939089106243e+48155')
1.00000000000000 + 5.12609390891062e48155*I
mpc(real='0.0', imag='2.6385510598470926e+4824525')
1.00000000000000 + 2.63855105984709e4824525*I
```
But other values seem ok.

```

    mpmath.erf(1+i*z); erf(1.+n(z)*i)
