The following text currently occurs in `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/graphs/base/c_graph.pyx`:

```python
        # The following is due to a hard to reproduce bug in Cython where except,
        # cpdef, and classes don't play well together:
        print "Not Implemented!"
        # raise NotImplementedError() ... results in:
        # Exception exceptions.NotImplementedError: NotImplementedError() in 'sage.graphs.base.c_graph.CGraph.has_arc' ignored
        # False
```

There is no Cython bug, it's just a matter of properly declaring the `except` value in the `.pxd` file (not just the `.pyx` file). The attached patch further adds `except` values to some other functions where needed.

By the way, the "exception ignored" message appears to be showing up on `stderr` rather than `stdout`.

I had not noticed this patch. Could you rebase it ? There is a merge conflict.

Also it may be in conflict with a `needs_review` patch I just wrote (#17163), but nothing complicated in sight.

My code is equally simple and does exactly the same thing, so why not?
