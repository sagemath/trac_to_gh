The following text currently occurs in `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/graphs/base/c_graph.pyx`:

```python
        # The following is due to a hard to reproduce bug in Cython where except,
        # cpdef, and classes don't play well together:
        print "Not Implemented!"
        # raise NotImplementedError() ... results in:
        # Exception exceptions.NotImplementedError: NotImplementedError() in 'sage.graphs.base.c_graph.CGraph.has_arc' ignored
        # False
```

There is no Cython bug, it's just a matter of properly declaring the `except` value in the `.pxd` file (not just the `.pyx` file). The attached patch further adds `except` values to some other functions where needed.

CCing rlm as he is the most likely to know more about this.

By the way, the "exception ignored" message appears to be showing up on `stderr` rather than `stdout`.

`O_o`

I had not noticed this patch. Could you rebase it ? There is a merge conflict.

Also it may be in conflict with a `needs_review` patch I just wrote (#17163), but nothing complicated in sight.

Throwing the same exception in 2 different places seemed a bit stupid. And it allows to actually test the `add_vertex_unsafe` method.

My code is equally simple and does exactly the same thing, so why not?

How does "except -1" work when the return type is bint ?

Also, won't this cause that some calls which are currently C calls will become Python calls ?

```diff
 cdef class StaticSparseCGraph(CGraph):
     cdef short_digraph g
     cdef short_digraph g_rev
     cdef bint _directed
 
-    cpdef bint has_vertex(self, int n)
-    cdef int add_vertex_unsafe(self, int k)
-    cdef int del_vertex_unsafe(self, int v)
-    cpdef list verts(self)
-    cdef int has_arc_unsafe(self, int u, int v)
-    cpdef bint has_arc(self, int u, int v)
-    cdef int out_neighbors_unsafe(self, int u, int *neighbors, int size) except? -2
-    cpdef list out_neighbors(self, int u)
     cpdef int out_degree(self, int u) except -1
-    cdef int in_neighbors_unsafe(self, int u, int *neighbors, int size) except? -2
-    cpdef list in_neighbors(self, int u)
     cpdef int in_degree(self, int u) except -1

The actual type is a C `int`. The return values mean the following:

* 0 => `False`
* 1 => `True`
* -1 => exception

No, there are already declared in the child class `CGraph`, no point to repeat them.

Okay, then as soon as I am done building the latest beta I will run all tests on your patch, should be done soon.
