*sage.interact.all* imports functions which have controls from *sagenb.notebook.interact* as default parameters. These take some time to initialize. The attached patch improves this situation:

```
$ dumbbench -- ./sage --startuptime
Ran 23 iterations (3 outliers).
Rounded run time per iteration: 1.001e+00 +/- 2.2e-02 (2.2%)
```

vs.

```
$ dumbbench -- ./sage --startuptime
Ran 24 iterations (4 outliers).
Rounded run time per iteration: 9.56e-01 +/- 1.7e-02 (1.8%)
```

I've attached a `*.proper.patch`, which is identical except that I removed the "garbage" before "`# HG changeset patch`", i.e., I deleted the first line "`exporting patch:`", since Jeroen's current merger rejects such patches.

For now, please make sure all your patches start with "`# HG changeset patch`", i.e., have it on the first line without any preceding messages or whatever.

I've relaxed that in *my version* of the merger, but Jeroen and maybe others are likely to use his more restrictive one.

This patch does not apply to the flask notebook trivially, and I'm probably not very qualified to do a rebasing myself. Anyone feel like looking into it? Latest version is at [https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/), a version a few days old is at [http://code.google.com/r/jasongrout-flask-sagenb/](http://code.google.com/r/jasongrout-flask-sagenb/).
