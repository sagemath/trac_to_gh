*sage.interact.all* imports functions which have controls from *sagenb.notebook.interact* as default parameters. These take some time to initialize. The attached patch improves this situation:

```
$ dumbbench -- ./sage --startuptime
Ran 23 iterations (3 outliers).
Rounded run time per iteration: 1.001e+00 +/- 2.2e-02 (2.2%)
```

vs.

```
$ dumbbench -- ./sage --startuptime
Ran 24 iterations (4 outliers).
Rounded run time per iteration: 9.56e-01 +/- 1.7e-02 (1.8%)
```

Attachment: **[trac_11732_sagenb_interact.proper.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11732/trac_11732_sagenb_interact.proper.patch.gz)**

I've attached a `*.proper.patch`, which is identical except that I removed the "garbage" before "`# HG changeset patch`", i.e., I deleted the first line "`exporting patch:`", since Jeroen's current merger rejects such patches.

For now, please make sure all your patches start with "`# HG changeset patch`", i.e., have it on the first line without any preceding messages or whatever.

I've relaxed that in *my version* of the merger, but Jeroen and maybe others are likely to use his more restrictive one.
