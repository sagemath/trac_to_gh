After applying the patches at #12719, I see

```
sage: %bg factor(next_prime(10^30)*next_prime(10^40))
ERROR: Line magic function `%bg` not found.
```
So I guess it is "fixed" in one sense, but not very satisfactorily.

Ah, good point.  In fact, I think %bg isn't implemented yet in IPython.  It's on the list of things to do by IPython developers.
