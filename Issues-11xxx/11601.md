This ticket adds functionality to work with arbitrary congruence subgroups of the modular group (specified by a level N and a subgroup of the finite group ` SL(2, Z / N Z) `). These support all the basic functionality one would expect: computation of index, genus, elliptic points, cusps, etc. There is also a facility to compute the congruence closure of a (possibly noncongruence) subgroup.

Some "rationalisation" is also included: e.g. one can no longer create `Gamma1(1)` or `GammaH(11, [2])`, which previously existed as less-functional duplicates of `SL2Z` and `Gamma0(11)`. (They previously played a role in "remembering" where certain degeneracy maps would go, but they didn't do this very well -- which was the cause of the issue at #10453 -- and the new more robust approach introduced at #10453 means we can get rid of them at last.)

Part of a series of tickets: #10335 - #11422 - #11598 - #10453 - #5048 - this one - #10546.

Apply [attachment: 11601.4.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11601/11601.4.patch.gz) on top of #5048. Once this is merged, #12001 can be closed as fixed.

I'm getting a warning when building the documentation, in `is_CongruenceSubgroup` in congroup_generic.py:

```
    Note that this may be False even if `x` really is a congruence subgroup --
    it tests whether `x` is "obviously" congruence, i.e.~whether it has a
    congruence subgroup datatype. To test whether or not an arithmetic subgroup
    of `SL(2, \ZZ)` is congruence, use the ``is_congruence()` method instead.
```
I guess a quote is missing at the end of is_congruence().
