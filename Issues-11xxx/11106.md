Developers working on the customization of the notebook style for a site installation might wish to easily switch between different styles. The patch offered here adds the following functionality to sage notebook: If the environment variable SAGENB_TEMPLATE_PATH is defined then its value is taken as the location the style files are loaded from. Otherwise they are loaded from a default location as before.

Is there an obvious problem with this?\n\nRado, do you mean a new spkg in addition to the existing \"sagenb\" or will it be inside \"sagenb\"?\n\nThere is no problem with this but I think it is something that you really should think about.  As I mentioned on [http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_frm/thread/758ac9a5106f5d4f](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_frm/thread/758ac9a5106f5d4f), I would like the flask notebook to be *either*\n\n(a) 100% part of Sage, in which case it is simply a set of patches on Trac\nwhich should be merged in the usual way by the Sage release manager.\n\n(b) 0% part of Sage, i.e. a completely separate project with a separate release manager and a separate bug tracker which will give me a complete spkg to be merged into Sage.\n\nI believe that anything between these two extremes would create extra complications.  Currently, option (a) holds for sagenb.\nI would not find it a problem if it starts out as (b) in the development phase but once it's merged it reverts back to (a), i.e. part of Sage.\n\nAlso keep in mind that a few tickets deal mostly with the Sage library but still need patches to sagenb, so maybe (a) would be a slightly better solution.  Recent examples: #9976, #10052.",

Rado, do you mean a new spkg in addition to the existing "sagenb" or will it be inside "sagenb"?

There is no problem with this but I think it is something that you really should think about.  As I mentioned on [http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_frm/thread/758ac9a5106f5d4f](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_frm/thread/758ac9a5106f5d4f), I would like the flask notebook to be *either*

(a) 100% part of Sage, in which case it is simply a set of patches on Trac
which should be merged in the usual way by the Sage release manager.

(b) 0% part of Sage, i.e. a completely separate project with a separate release manager and a separate bug tracker which will give me a complete spkg to be merged into Sage.

I believe that anything between these two extremes would create extra complications.  Currently, option (a) holds for sagenb.
I would not find it a problem if it starts out as (b) in the development phase but once it's merged it reverts back to (a), i.e. part of Sage.
