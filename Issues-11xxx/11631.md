```
sage: C = CuspForms(43,2)
sage: N = C.newforms('a')
sage: f = N[1]
sage: L = f.cuspform_lseries()
Boom!
```

There are two issues:

  (1) the code doesn't work at all when the degree of the form is > 1, which is the main interesting case,

  (2) the name "cuspform_lseries" is bad, since f is already a cuspform, and we use the name "lseries" in all other places (e.g., elliptic curves, abelian varieties), so it is hard to find.  In fact, I didn't even think to look for cuspform_lseries, instead only finding this via lots of grepping and reading source code.

So to fix this issue, I think (1) the bug should get fixed, and (2) the name should be changed (actually *deprecate* the old name as explained in the developers guide and introduce the name lseries).

See also #12015.

The part about deprecating cuspform_lseries() is moved to #16917. 

Depends on #16916

Inspired in the patch at #12015, I added a parameter to `cuspform_lseries()` so one can specify which of the conjugates of the newform to use (defaults to 0). The order is arbitrary as it comes from the `embeddings()` method for `self.base_ring()`.

In the long term #12015 is much more general, but this is a good fix and much easier to review and merge.
