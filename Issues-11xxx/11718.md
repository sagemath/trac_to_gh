**Status update**

LinBox's Sage interface changed and this causes major problems. The attached patch is supposed to address this new interface but I cannot successfully link against `liblinboxsage.so` any more. 

I get

```python
    846                 import matrix_complex_double_dense
    847                 return matrix_complex_double_dense.Matrix_complex_double_dense
--> 848             elif sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod_ring.is_IntegerModRing(R) and R.order() < matrix_modn_dense.MAX_MODULUS:
    849                 if R.order() == 2:
    850                     return matrix_mod2_dense.Matrix_mod2_dense

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'MAX_MODULUS'
```

However, this is not a Python problem. If I remove **everything** from `linbox.pyx` except for

```python
cdef class Foo:
    pass
```

and remove **all** references to LinBox except for one `cimport` of it in `matrix_modn_dense` **and** I empty out `linbox-sage.C` in the LinBox !SPKG except for

```c
#include <iostream>
#include <gmp.h>

#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>
#include <list>

#include "linbox-sage.h"

#include <linbox/util/commentator.h>

#include <linbox/blackbox/sparse.h>

#include "linbox/element/givaro-polynomial.h"

#include <linbox/matrix/blas-matrix.h>
#include <linbox/matrix/sparse.h>
#include <linbox/vector/sparse.h>

#include <linbox/algorithms/blas-domain.h>
#include <linbox/algorithms/echelon-form.h>
#include "linbox/algorithms/gauss.h"
#include "linbox/algorithms/smith-form-adaptive.h"
#include "linbox/ffpack/ffpack.h"
#include <linbox/solutions/rank.h>          
#include <linbox/solutions/det.h>
#include <linbox/solutions/solve.h>

#include "linbox/solutions/methods.h"
#include <linbox/solutions/minpoly.h>
#include "linbox/algorithms/double-det.h"
#include <linbox/integer.h>

#include <linbox/field/gmp-rational.h>
#include <linbox/ring/givaro-polynomial.h>
```

I still get this problem. Hence, I figure it should have something to do with the linking. That is, I assume LinBox overwrites some symbol or corrupts some memory somehow which makes it impossible to link against it from Sage.

However, I am out of ideas and steam. Hence, I'll give up on fixing this for now. 
But I will send an e-mail to the LinBox list.

**PS:** We also get the same `UINT32_MAX` error as #9511 on sage.math
