```
R.<x> = QQ[]
f = x^2 + 3*x + 1
K = Qp(7)
M.<a> = K.extension(f)
M(7).norm()
```
The above outputs `1 + O(7^20)`, which is completely wrong.  The norm should be `7^2 + O(7^20)`, I think -- anyways, it should be divisible by 7. 

The problem is that the actual code for the norm, which ones sees by typing `a.norm??` assumes that the generator for M is in fact a generator for the maximal ideal of the ring of integers.  However, this assumption is just completely false. 

Typing `a.norm???` we see

```
...
    norm_of_uniformizer = (-1)**self.parent().degree() * self.parent().defining_polynomial()[0]
    if self.valuation() == 0:
        return self.parent().ground_ring()(self.unit_part().matrix_mod_pn().det())
    else:
        return self.parent().ground_ring()(self.unit_part().matrix_mod_pn().det()) * norm_of_uniformizer**self.valuation()
```    

The above is wrong as mentioned above.  Moreover, it is nonoptimal in that norm_of_uniformizer is computed but never used in the case when `self.valuation()==0`.

This bug caused some confusion when computing with p-adic L-series for a research paper...

Replying to [@loefflerd](#comment%3A6):
> Isn't this what we have a milestone "sage-pending" for?

I personally don't use "sage-pending" for *that* situation, since my script does dependency checking, so won't attempt to merge it, but considers it for inclusion, i.e., I'll see that it has positive review, and all of its dependencies with their state.

My interpretation (or use) of "sage-pending" is to postpone tickets for *other* reasons, so I currently only see that they're postponed, and don't consider them further.

I thought this was the original intent, to have some "formal" way to plan which tickets get merged when during management of a specific release, also since we don't have milestones for devel releases.
