This sucks:

```
malb@road:~ $ env | grep "SHELL="                                                                                                                                
SHELL=/bin/zsh
malb@road:~ $ sage -sh
...

Bypassing shell configuration files ...

SAGE_ROOT=/home/malb/Sage/current\n(sage subshell) \h:\W \u$ 
```

i.e., the prompt is all wrong, compared to:

```
malb@road:/opt/sage-4.7.2.alpha3-prerelease/local/bin $ /opt/sage-4.7.2.alpha3-prerelease/sage -sh

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.
Be sure to exit when you are done and do not do anything
with other copies of Sage!

Bypassing shell configuration files ...

SAGE_ROOT=/opt/sage-4.7.2.alpha3-prerelease
(sage subshell) road:/opt/sage-4.7.2.alpha3-prerelease/local/bin malb$ 
```

The attached patch fixes this.

**Apply** [attachment:trac11866_proper_zsh_prompt.patch] to the scripts repository, not the normal Sage repository.

Resolution: fixed

I think that since it seems to work, and since we came up with the same change completely independently, this can be given a positive review.

Oh, thanks!

I'll take a look.
