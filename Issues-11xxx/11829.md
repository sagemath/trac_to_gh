As far as I know, Sage calls Singular for multivariate factorization over finite fields. Currently Singular is limited to primes less than
2^29:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(previous_prime(2^29))[]
sage: factor(x+y+1,proof=False)
x + y + 1
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(next_prime(2^29))[]
sage: factor(x+y+1,proof=False)
...
NotImplementedError: Factorization of multivariate polynomials over prime fields with characteristic > 2^29 is not implemented.
```
However for larger primes we get:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(previous_prime(2^31))[]
sage: factor(x+y+1,proof=False)
```
and this seems to hang (when I hit Ctrl-C, it says
`Interrupting Singular`)

Hi Paul,

a multivariate polynomial ring over GF(next_prime(2<sup>29</sup>)) uses libSingular, i.e., Singular via a Cython interface; while a multivariate polynomial ring over GF(previous_prime(2<sup>31</sup>)) uses the generic polynomial implementation in Sage. We followed the Singular manual for the maximum prime allowed (which is 2147483629 < previous_prime(2<sup>31</sup>)), while we apparently don't follow it when converting generic polynomials to Singular via the pexpect interface.

I think this is actually a bug and the Singular developers meant previous_prime(2<sup>31</sup>) when they chose a limit. 

I asked: http://groups.google.com/group/libsingular-devel/browse_thread/thread/885b21e6f8039cc

Martin, I asked Hans Schonemann last week at the MAGIX conference about this limit, and he
told about a 2<sup>28</sup> limit. Thus I'm not sure the Singular developers really know what the real
limit is...

All doctests pass except the following timeout with sage 4.7.1 (but this timeout also happens
before the patch):

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  devel/sage-11829/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py # Time out
```
Thus a positive review for me.

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  devel/sage-11829/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py # Time out
```

Guess you're on Ubuntu (10.04.3 for example); this is due to a known issue with its kernel and the PExpect interface. (You'll notice that the doctest idles most of the time.)
