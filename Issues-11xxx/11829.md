As far as I know, Sage calls Singular for multivariate factorization over finite fields. Currently Singular is limited to primes less than
2^29:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(previous_prime(2^29))[]
sage: factor(x+y+1,proof=False)
x + y + 1
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(next_prime(2^29))[]
sage: factor(x+y+1,proof=False)
...
NotImplementedError: Factorization of multivariate polynomials over prime fields with characteristic > 2^29 is not implemented.
```
However for larger primes we get:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(previous_prime(2^31))[]
sage: factor(x+y+1,proof=False)
```
and this seems to hang (when I hit Ctrl-C, it says
`Interrupting Singular`)

Hi Paul,

a multivariate polynomial ring over GF(next_prime(2<sup>29</sup>)) uses libSingular, i.e., Singular via a Cython interface; while a multivariate polynomial ring over GF(previous_prime(2<sup>31</sup>)) uses the generic polynomial implementation in Sage. We followed the Singular manual for the maximum prime allowed (which is 2147483629 < previous_prime(2<sup>31</sup>)), while we apparently don't follow it when converting generic polynomials to Singular via the pexpect interface.

I think this is actually a bug and the Singular developers meant previous_prime(2<sup>31</sup>) when they chose a limit. 

I asked: http://groups.google.com/group/libsingular-devel/browse_thread/thread/885b21e6f8039cc

All doctests pass except the following timeout with sage 4.7.1 (but this timeout also happens
before the patch):

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  devel/sage-11829/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py # Time out
```
Thus a positive review for me.

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  devel/sage-11829/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py # Time out
```

Guess you're on Ubuntu (10.04.3 for example); this is due to a known issue with its kernel and the PExpect interface. (You'll notice that the doctest idles most of the time.)
