Did you make `spkg-install` executable?

While `hg log` shows `spkg-install` had been modified, `hg diff` doesn't.




I think we should really set the `umask` in `spkg-install` (or `sage-spkg`), since otherwise changing the permissions of the upstream files and those in `patches/` doesn't help much in this case.

Otherwise positive review; the files that were previously only readable / executable by the user or group are now world-readable, and executable if appropriate (provided the `umask` doesn't prevent this).

`spkg-install` is sub-optimal btw.

Perhaps, I don't remember.

Where do you see this?

Well, I could have looked at the previous spkg. ;-)

`hg log -v` also shows which files have been touched in each changeset.
