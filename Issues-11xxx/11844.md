Fixed by #11616.

Depends on #11964

Nice.

Which version of MPIR are you referring to?

(I don't know whether the yasm version in our "recent" MPIR packages ever changed at all, or which one we currently use.)

FWIW, IIRC we did a lot of massively parallel builds of MPIR 2.1.x, because of the race condition in *MPIR's* `make install` (fixed in MPIR 2.1.3 or .4), but never ran into an error caused by yasm.

This is the mpir-1.2.2.p2.spkg from sage-4.7.2.alpha2. All versions of Yasm have the bug.

You probably didn't trip over the yasm bug because you were using a file system that allows you to open the same file multiple times for writing. Then you don't get the segfault, but you may get corrupted output. If you are extremely lucky gcc might even compile the clobbered output from re2c, and you'd just get mathematically wrong results for integer arithmetic.

The latter is apparently [fixed in MPIR 2.1.4](http://groups.google.com/group/mpir-devel/browse_thread/thread/04928454886f34ab/e29bf19c2590d2d0).

In the unlikely case that `tmpfile()` can't find a unique file name, it'll return NULL so at least the yasm build will fail with a clean segfault. There are probably many other things that would go wrong at build time if `tmpfile()` fails...

```
ERRORS
       EACCES Search permission denied for directory in file's path prefix.

       EEXIST Unable to generate a unique filename.

       EINTR  The call was interrupted by a signal.

       EMFILE Too many file descriptors in use by the process.

       ENFILE Too many files open in the system.

       ENOSPC There was no room in the directory to add the new filename.

       EROFS  Read-only file system.
```

So there are a couple of reasons why `tmpfile()`could fail (and these may be temporary, i.e., later calls at least from other processes may well succeed).

Letting `re2c` segfault is of course the pythonic way... ;-)
