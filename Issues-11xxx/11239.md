Trying to coerce a polynomial over a finite field into a polynomial ring over a bigger field gives a bogus result:

```
sage: Fq.<a> = GF(5^2)
sage: Fqq.<b> = GF(5^4)
sage: f = Fq['x'].random_element(); f
3*x^2 + (a + 4)*x + 2*a + 4
sage: Fqq['y'](f)
3*y^2 + (b + 4)*y + 2*b + 4
```
In this example, Sage simply replaces every ‘a’ with ‘b’, but a is not b.  If we coerce directly from Fq to Fqq, we get a `NotImplementedError`, which is unfortunate but in any case not incorrect. ;).

```
sage: Fqq(a)

> If we coerce directly from Fq to Fqq, we get a `NotImplementedError`, which is unfortunate ...

It is, however, difficult to see how this could be done, because there are, in this case, two embeddings of the smaller field in the larger, neither of which can be distinguished from the other:

```
sage: Fq.<a> = GF(5^2); Fqq.<b> = GF(5^4)
sage: Hom(Fq, Fqq).list()
[
Ring morphism:
  From: Finite Field in a of size 5^2
  To:   Finite Field in b of size 5^4
  Defn: a |--> 4*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 4*b + 3,
Ring morphism:
  From: Finite Field in a of size 5^2
  To:   Finite Field in b of size 5^4
  Defn: a |--> b^3 + b^2 + b + 3
]
```
since

```
sage: a.minimal_polynomial().roots(ring=F625, multiplicities=False)
[4*b^3 + 4*b^2 + 4*b + 3, b^3 + b^2 + b + 3]
```
As for the polynomial coercion, this is seriously damaged.  Bogus results are produced even when the characteristics are different.  I have tracked the problem down to the following, but haven't been able to get further.

```
sage: Fq.<a> = GF(2^4); Fqq.<b> = GF(3^7)
sage: PFq.<x> = Fq[]; PFqq.<y> = Fqq[]
sage: f = x^3 + (a^3 + 1)*x
sage: sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_zz_pex.Polynomial_ZZ_pEX(PFqq, f)
y^3 + (b^3 + 1)*y
```

It seems that everything that can be represented as polynomial is converted in that way. The phenomenon also appears with quotient rings:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: A.<a> = R.quotient(x^3+2); PA.<s> = A[]
sage: B.<b> = R.quotient(x^5+3); PB.<t> = B[]
sage: f = a*s^3 + a^2*s; f
a*s^3 + a^2*s
sage: PB(f)
b*t^3 + b^2*t
```
One way to solve this problem would be to check whether the coefficients of one polynomial rings can be converted (coerced) to the other...

I would strongly advice against the attempt to solve it on the level of conversion.

I know that at least some classes of polynomial rings are still following the old coercion model, and am preparing a patch that is supposed to fix that. According to the new model, there should be a method `_element_constructor_` that does the conversion, and a separate `_coerce_map_from_`, that determines whether there is a coercion (not just a conversion).

I think that it is ok to have that bogus conversion - as long as it is not used as a coercion. One could, of course, try to throw an error when doing a conversion in the case that there is no fixed embedding of the base rings. However, testing it *repeatedly*, that's to say testing it *for each individual polynomial to be converted*, sounds like a waste of computation time to me.

If in the example in the ticket description, one replaces

```
sage: Fqq['y'](f)
```
by

```
sage: Fqq['y']._coerce_(f)
```
one at least gets a sensible error:

```
TypeError: no canonical coercion from Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field in a of size 5^2 to Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Finite Field in b of size 5^4

I tried the same example using the compatible finite fields from #8335.  The problem (that the coefficients are converted in the stupid way) persists, both for conversion and for coercion.  This is surprising, because in that case there *is* a coercion map between the finite fields.

The problem lies in the *NTL implementation* of polynomials over finite fields.  (Edit: this was already discovered in [comment:2](#comment:2) above.)  This is the default implementation for polynomials over finite fields, even though the fields themselves are only implemented via NTL in characteristic 2, and via Givaro or PARI otherwise.

The following example demonstrates this (after applying #8335 plus a patch that I will upload shortly):

```
sage: K.<a> = GF(5^2, conway=True, prefix='z')
sage: L.<b> = GF(5^4, conway=True, prefix='z')
sage: type(K)
<class 'sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_givaro.FiniteField_givaro_with_category'>
sage: R = PolynomialRing(K, 'x', implementation='NTL')
sage: S = PolynomialRing(L, 'x', implementation='NTL')
sage: f = R.gen() + a; f
x + a
sage: type(f)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_zz_pex.Polynomial_ZZ_pEX'>
sage: S(f)
x + b
sage: R = PolynomialRing(K, 'x', implementation='generic')
sage: S = PolynomialRing(L, 'x', implementation='generic')
sage: f = R.gen() + a; f
x + a
sage: type(f)
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element_generic.Polynomial_generic_dense_field'>
sage: S(f)
x + b^3 + b^2 + b + 3

At this point there are two possible solutions:
- either fix the NTL polynomial constructor,
- or make the generic polynomial constructor coerce the coefficients if necessary, and make the NTL polynomial constructor raise an error if it is given a polynomial over a smaller finite field.
The first solution would be preferable in principle, but certainly harder and maybe even unreasonable, since the NTL polynomial constructor is a lower-level thing that should not have to care about maps between non-trivial finite fields.

Debatable as it may seem, this is the behaviour currently described in the documentation of `PolynomialQuotientRing_generic._element_constructor_()`.  Attempting a coercion (`PB.coerce(f)`) instead of a conversion (`PB(f)`) does lead to

```
TypeError: no canonical coercion from Univariate Polynomial Ring in s over Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in a over Integer Ring with modulus x^3 + 2 to Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in b over Integer Ring with modulus x^5 + 3

as expected.

Anyway, the coercion framework is already called in the previous test so efficiency is already potentially screwed up.

I've just made a git branch from the patch.

I think it is worth thinking about whether the "stupid" conversion should be allowed between different quotients of a polynomial ring.  However, for the problem addressed in this ticket, there is really only one sensible thing to do, namely applying the canonical map between the base rings.

I personally think that allowing `Fqq['y'](f)` to 'desperately' apply any available conversion, however nonsensical it may be, to the coefficients is a bad idea.

I completely agree, whence my previous positive review.
But the doc for coercion kind of make me think, humm, maybe some people want the stupid behavior as well...

>

I agree as well, I was just menitoning it because it's already mentioned here :)

Anyway, if nobody gives a strong opinion of why to keep conversions without any mathematical sense and confusing for naive users on sage-devel, then I'll put this back to positive review quickly as I think that the situation with this ticket is far better.
Note that maybe some efficiency could be gained by replacing the has_coerce_map_from by something else but I have no idea what to do now and no time to think about it, I'd just like to remove the stupid conversion unless someone convinces me to keep them of course.

I only know of one rule for conversion: If there is a coercion then conversion must coincide with it.

Given that a conversion needs to coincide with the coercion if the latter exists, one must check for a coercion before applying the "stupid" conversion (assuming the "stupid" conversion is desired at all).

In the situation of this ticket, there is a coercion map between the polynomial rings (assuming the finite fields know that they are compatible; see the doctests, not the ticket description).  The problem was that the element constructor didn't check for this and always applied the "stupid" conversion.  (The same problem arises when using `R.coerce(f)`, because the coercion map just defers to a conversion using the element constructor.)

I think the point in the above discussion was whether my solution of calling `has_coerce_map_from()` is expensive; I guess not, but even if it is, it is still necessary to guarantee compatibility of conversion and coercion.

> They don't need to be composable. They aren't even maps (only partially defined). It is perfectly fine to have a conversion for all elements of a ring R1 into a ring R2 and of all elements of a ring R2 into a ring R3, but only some elements (e.g.: polynomials of degree zero) of R1 convert into R3 without raising an error.

That is actually what I was trying to say on sage-devel in the context of polynomial ring quotients, but I wasn't very clear.  I agree that the existence of coercion doesn't have to be transitive, or to satisfy any rules; in the context of this ticket, I think it is perfectly fine if the "stupid" conversion is not used at all.

You mean, conversion, not coercion? Coercion must be transitive. That's one of the axioms.

I think I see what you mean, but am still not sure.  Are you suggesting that also the existing

```python
elif self.base_ring().has_coerce_map_from(P):
    return C(self, [x], check=True, is_gen=False,
    construct=construct)
```
in `PolynomialRing._element_constructor_()` should go away and that there should be custom coercion maps to replace this check and the similar one added by my patch?

> You mean, conversion, not coercion? Coercion must be transitive. That's one of the axioms.

Yes, I meant conversion.

Here is the way in which I think this bug should be solved conceptually.  It is motivated by the fact that if *A* is a commutative ring, the object *A*[*x*] in the category of *A*-algebras represents the forgetful functor to the category of sets.
- Implement a class `PolynomialRingMorphism` modelling ring homomorphisms *f*: *A*[*x*] -> *C*, where *A* and *C* are commutative rings.  Note that *C* is not required to be a polynomial ring.  Such ring homomorphisms correspond bijectively to pairs (*g*, *c*), where *g*: *A* -> *C* is a ring homomorphism and *c* is an element of *C*, where the bijection is given by *g* = *f*|<sub>A</sub> and *c* = *f*(*x*); cf. the above motivation.
- Have optimised code for the following special case: *C* = *B*[*y*] where *B* is an *A*-algebra (or: has a coercion map from *A*), *g* is the composition of the obvious maps *A* -> *B* -> *C*, and *c* = *y*. In this case, *f* is the map *A*[*x*] -> *C*[*y*] that we will declare as the coercion map.  Given an element *p* of *A*[*x*], the `PolynomialRingMorphism` in this special case should just take the list of coefficients of *p*, map them to *B* and hence construct the desired element *f*(*p*) of *B*[*y*].
- If *C* = *B*[*y*], where *B* has a coercion map from *A*, let `C._coerce_map_from_(A['x'])` return the `PolynomialRingMorphism` for the above special case.
- A general `PolynomialRingMorphism` could be implemented either in terms of this special case or independently from it.  The first approach would work as follows: given a general *f*: *A*[*x*] -> *C* as in the first point, represented by a pair (*g*, *c*), applying *f* to a polynomial *p* in *A*[*x*] can be implemented by first mapping *p* to *C*[*y*] (applying *g* to the coefficients as in the special case) and then substituting *c* for *y*.
This is probably not very difficult to implement.  This ticket could function as a temporary solution for the bug it fixes, until we have the real solution.

P.S. The current `_coerce_map_from_()`, in the case of univariate polynomial rings where there exists a coercion between the base rings, returns `False` unless the variable name is the same.  In the above, I chose the different letters *x* and *y* to clearly distinguish between the polynomial rings; they are not meant as Sage variable names.

P.P.S. It turns out that the special case already exists (in more generality) as `RingHomomorphism_from_base`.  In the above notation, it applies *g* elementwise to the `dict` of coefficients; for univariate dense polynomials a `list` would probaby be faster, but it looks like a good starting point.
