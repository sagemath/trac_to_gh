This would eventually need also to add html (#10652) and other file types as possible uploads, but I think that those could be additional enhancements to the Mac app.

I have to admit that some of the stuff in designable.nib I will never understand.  I see the "new option to automatically start the server when a sws file is opened" from #8473, but some of the things like "IBConnectionRecord" and the mysterious numbers everywhere I can only judge by their effects.  I am impressed by all the work bringing the double-click not just to the browser but to the mini-browser you built.

I'll be testing this shortly.

```

Notice the `file://localhost/Users` rather than `file:///Users` which we get at #8473.

From #8473:

```
The Mac app has a new option to automatically start the server when a sws file is opened. I'm not sure anyone would ever want to turn this off, so I can remove it if it's not useful.
```
But it does work as advertised. I can imagine one wanting to avoid 'accidentally' starting the server, so let's keep it.

The rest seems to work as it's supposed to, modulo the issues mentioned at #8473.

Now it seems to be more normal again, though I still got two copies of the worksheet, presumably from your !URLQueue.  Anyway, not something I'm really concerned with, since it's working nonetheless.

Well, it's a little tricky.  Double-clicking certainly opens the Sage app, and the notebook server opens, but I don't see it opening the file.  Yes, this is on a version of Sage with the sws-cmdline going, because if I open the terminal from within the little dropdown list, I get

```
sage: notebook(upload="/Users/.../Untitled.sws")
The notebook files are stored in: sage_notebook.sagenb
Another Sage Notebook server is running, PID 19872.
Opening web browser at http://localhost:8000/upload_worksheet?url=file:///Users/.../Untitled.sws ...
```
and it opens fine in its own thing.  But when I double-click, it just opens the worksheet list window, nothing else.

When I use the Sage app itself (not the little menubar item) and do `File -> Open File ...` then I get the "native" app browser with the worksheet I chose as its title, but nothing else (just a clank browser window.  It doesn't do anything, and the worksheet is not there when I check.

The only possible problem is that I built this as an Xcode project and then dumped in my Sage that has the sws-cmdline business.  But it functions fine otherwise, so I don't know what the story is with this.  Sadly, 'needs work'.

Also, I have a feeling that it doesn't wait long enough to upload in any case, but that would be a separate issue.

On an unrelated note, why does `sage-document-cython.icns` look so much bigger than the other icon files?

By the way, my menubar item never does become blue any more.  Maybe that is part of it.  I mean, the server is clearly working, so I'm not sure why not.  Any ideas?

Okay, I tried it against sage-5.2.beta0 and you are right (when you use the system browser).  The problem is the server detection.  They changed the (default) pid file of the notebook server.  I have fixed this and tested that it also works with the old pid file, and updated the patch.

Hmm, but it still looks bigger.  Probably this isn't a big deal.  I can't check what the icons actually look like because I have Xcode as the default to open .pyx files and it won't give me the icon even after saying Sage.app should open them.

Okay.  What was the change for this?

In `sage-is-running-on-port.sh`.  I think it's pretty obvious where the change is.  There is also a change in `AppController.m`, but since I uploaded the wrong patch you wouldn't have been able to see it.  :-)

Ok.  You could just make that functionality raise an error for the time being.

Of course.

What do you mean that txt files "aren't in the options"?

You mean that the window that logs you in and the window with the worksheet?  I agree.  I think that requires sagenb changes, but maybe not.

Hmm.  I can't reproduce this with Safari.

Where do you drag the sage executable?  To the preferences window?  If so I can confirm that if you do the following it doesn't save

1. Drag (or otherwise change) the sage executable in the preferences window
2. Quit `_without_` changing focus from the text entry code.

This is because some validation and saving of the value is done when focus is lost.  To see what I mean try changing it to a path which doesn't exist and then change focus (e.g. by hitting tab).  

I admit this is quite unfortunate, but I think another ticket should be opened for this issue.

I mean that when I right-click and choose "Open With" that for zip files Sage is in the list, for txt files it isn't.  Obvious for sws files it is.  But one can still surf through the mini-Finder window and use that, or drag a text file onto the Sage in the Dock (well, I didn't try that, and right now I definitely can't).

Fair enough.

That's my point.  In Safari it's fine, but go into Safari prefs and change the default browser to FF or Chrome, and they don't auto login when you click on a sws file.  (That might even be the case without the double click, just when opening Sage - I didn't think to check that.)

I can confirm that 
1. Changing the default browser while the Sage app server is running
2. Trying to use Sage.app by double-clicking an sws file
3. Leads to login requests at pages with the login screen like

```
http://localhost:8000/?next=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8000%2Fupload_worksheet%3Furl%3Dfile%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2FUsers...%2Ftest.txt
```
The only way I got it to log in by itself was by asking it to upload a worksheet; apparently that confused it enough that it logged me in for the "extra window" with the worksheet list, but not for the actual uploaded guy.  That only worked once, though.

But apparently it works ok if you turn off the server first.  I think?  What do you think, is this a bug?  At least I figured out what was going on.  Because of the way it works, I'm inclined to let it go for now, or at most to ask for some clarifying addition to documentation.

I think you've broken it pretty good.  :-)  I can't think of anything else to test, except perhaps zip files (if you haven't tested those already).  And of course on different operating systems.

Oh, and I did test these already.  Interestingly, when opening a zip from its icon, you get to see that they are added somehow, but they are just silently uploaded from the File -> Open dialogue.

This is really working great.  I'm very pleased.  Now if only we could get the same thing happening on Windows!  I don't think the virtual machine solution is quite ready for that yet.

You know, I thought of a reason for putting this Xcode project on bitbucket or something - it means I could just download that to test new things with it on an older machine, as opposed to having to build a Sage from scratch to do so.  For this I needed the new sagenb anyway, so the easiest way to do that is get 5.2.beta0 and build, but of course that isn't always so nice.  Also, it was really hard for me to tell what had changed between your different versions sometimes.

On Tiger, I do indeed need to do the universal cross-develop as I think the readme directs.  I get two warnings for implicit declaration of sleep, and two for webview perhaps not responding to isloading.  Whatever?

On the plus side, the new intro screen is nicer!  (I'm doing it with 5.2.beta0 on this computer.)  Asks for an executable well.

I'm having trouble even getting previously existing functionality to work this way, though.  I get, for `http://localhost:8000/new_worksheet`, "Not Found The resource /new_worksheet cannot be found." when doing "New worksheet" from the Sage menu item, and "Open Notebook" doesn't have the login.  (Though when I initially start the app it does do automatic login.)  I also had the trouble with the Mac app skeleton in the sage-5.2.beta0 binary conflicting with the one I built.

And now even trouble with the regular login, on clicking on an sws

```
Safari can’t open the page “http://localhost:8000/?startup_token=64130e35bb235d83b5337f2a920eae0f” because Safari can’t connect to the server “localhost”.
```
and

```
The resource /upload_worksheet?url=file://localhost/Users/crisman/Desktop/Untitled.sws cannot be found.
```

But then stopping everything, quitting Sage.app, and restarting (without double-clicking) gives me the Sage server - at port 8001!  And works ok.  But not the stuff on this ticket.

```
There was an error uploading 'file://localhost/Users/crisman/Desktop/Untitled.sws' (please recheck the URL). Return to Upload File.
```
which was from the URL

```
http://localhost:8001/upload_worksheet?url=file://localhost/Users/crisman/Desktop/Untitled.sws
```

I have to admit that because of the above problem with the phantom Sage.app I had two Sage servers running... so after killing both python processes, I tried *again* and got THREE open windows.  One with a normal worksheet list; one with a login token URL with an error message, and one with the error message in the browser about an invalid URL for the upload itself.

```

	Traceback (most recent call last):
	Failure: twisted.python.failure.DefaultException: Bad token
	
```
among other error message in sage.log.

The more I try, the weirder it gets, including a server running but with a gray menu icon, more stuff running on port 8001, ... anyway, it's certainly not behaving consistently, and I have yet to get it to upload a worksheet on Tiger.  It *could* all be because of having multiple Sage.apps, but this is even after I dump the phantom ones (skeleton) in the Trash.

Actually, this could be part or all of the program.  Supposedly the isLoading method is available on Mac OS X v10.4.11 and later.  I do check whether it's available, and if it's not available I just sleep for 1 second instead of waiting.  I think this might cause it to think the server has started when it really hasn't yet.

More worrisome to me is the warning for implicit declaration of sleep, because that means some header didn't get included and then even the sleep might not work.

You could try adding

```
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
```
to the top of `AppDelegate.m` and see if that fixes the sleep warning.

Anyway all this is related to detection of whether the server is running, but only if you are using Sage.app as the browser.  Now that I think about it, I don't think you can use Sage.app as the browser on Tiger, so that shouldn't be the problem.

Hmm.  I'm not sure what might cause a "Bad token" error.
There is #2935 which might or might not be related.  It seems to have about the same level of weirdness. :-)
There is a work around there.  Well, for whatever Jaap's problem was which is probably not the same problem you are having.

> The more I try, the weirder it gets, including a server running but with a gray menu icon, more stuff running on port 8001, ... anyway, it's certainly not behaving consistently, and I have yet to get it to upload a worksheet on Tiger.

Just a wild guess, but maybe you have something other than Sage running on port 8000.

Tiger doesn't have all of the capabilities of later operating systems.  For example it doesn't work to show up in the Dock (did I document that somewhere...).  So it's conceivable it's a Tiger only issue.

Thanks again for all the testing.  I really wish I had access to a 10.4 machine.

What if you quite Sage.app and start it again.  Does it recognize that a server is running?  Is one running?  If quitting stops both servers, then try holding Option when you quit to not kill the server and see if Sage.app recognizes the server then.  

What happens (i.e. does it work okay) if you start the server yourself from the command line, and then double click a sws file (without Sage.app being open)?  Does 5.2.beta0 use the new notebook?

> So we *could* add a very careful set of instructions to try to warn people to avoid this situation.  I mean, it *does* work.  Just not ideally.

I'd like to get this fixed since it's supposed to work, but I guess it depends on how long we have to wait for me to fix it.  It's not going into 5.2 though so we have some time.  I can't reproduce the problem so it might be a timing issue.  I'll try to look at the code and see if I can figure it out.

ok.

Just that it works.  I didn't bother checking all this, I'm sure it wouldn't be better.

If I click before starting Sage.app (this is the case we are talking about here), I get the two servers.  As far as I can tell, maybe even neither one is stopped when I quit!  But `ps` just gives one... anyway, when I then start Sage.app normally, I get the gray icon, but I get a new server starting on port 8001.

I think that what happens is that there shouldn't be *any* processes listed for me under `ps` because they are not owned by me in the Terminal.  But someone one is.  The 8001 process doesn't show up in `ps`.

As you can see, there are at least two full Sage servers going on now.

This seems to work okay.  There still is the extra worksheet list window opening late, but that is acceptable - no other server is started.  By the way, quitting the Sage server in the little menubar item stops it in the Terminal too, which is good (in this scenario).

I'm on OS X Lion.

This patch does start and stop the server.  Starting the server initializes three python2.7 processes.  Two of them are ~100MB and one is ~5MB.  Stopping the server or exiting Sage.app terminates the two larger of these, while leaving the ~5MB python2.7 process running.  This last running process is a problem for deleting/renaming Sage.app, and does not go away on its own.

Telling Sage.app to start a terminal session also spawns a ~5MB python2.7 process which persists after exiting both that terminal session and Sage.app.

Right-clicking a .txt file and selecting Sage.app to open it results in the text of the file being placed above the first input cell without linebreaks.  That is, a text file consisting of

"""Hello.  I'm a

sample text file in Sage.app"""

ends up being opened with the text "Hello.  I'm a sample text file in Sage.app", with the first input cell following the text.  I've not yet tried it with a proper text Sage worksheet.

Double-clicking a .sws file saved via Sage.app's File->Save As menu does activate Sage.app.  It pulls up an error page:

"There was an error uploading the worksheet. It could be an old unsupported format or worse. If you desperately need its contents contact the sage-support group and post a link to your worksheet. Alternatively, an sws file is just a bzip2 tarball; take a look inside!"

Instead using the in-browser's File->Save worksheet to file... does not appear to save anything.

Using Firefox instead, I can save an sws file and open it by double clicking.  I'm testing this functionality further right now.

I think that is a sage-cleaner process, and it `_should_` go away.  You can check what process it is by running in a terminal

```
ps aux | grep PID
```
where you can get the PID from Activity Monitor (left most column).  

Does this happen every time you start the server, thereby accumulating a new process every time?

> Telling Sage.app to start a terminal session also spawns a ~5MB python2.7 process which persists after exiting both that terminal session and Sage.app.

When I open a terminal session, I only see one python2.7 process, using about 113MB of memory.  After exiting the session the process terminates.  Maybe there is something about your system that causes sage-cleaner to hang around, or perhaps the difference is due to different Sage versions.  What version are you using?  I'm actually still using 5.4.rc2 with some patches e.g. for new ipython.

Cool.

This is because the `File -> Save As` doesn't work.  I have already removed it in another patch.  Sadly, it touches a nib file (which are virtually unmergeable) so I would rather not add that same change here since all further changes would have to be rebased.

> Instead using the in-browser's File->Save worksheet to file... does not appear to save anything.

I have opened #13931 for this.
 
> Using Firefox instead, I can save an sws file and open it by double clicking.  I'm testing this functionality further right now.

Awesome.  Thanks.

On OS X Lion, running Sage 5.5 compiled from source.

Notes on lingering process after stopping server:

` ps aux | grep (process id) ` reveals it's sage-cleaner.  The process persists for at least six hours.  I'm looking into this further, and think it's a separate issue from Sage.app: I had previously observed that running sage from a terminal did not spawn a lingering process, but that has changed.  Running sage from terminal also creates a sage-cleaner process.

About the opening of files:

On opening up documents by double clicking or right-clicking and selecting Open With..., I have found that compressed .sws (.sws.zip) files do not open.  Text files open fine... I had the enigmatic title "{{{id=9|" in my test case, but all the cells imported just fine.  Compressed text (.txt.zip) does the same thing as non-compressed text.

Opening with .sws format also preserves output cells, including graphics.  Opening .txt files preserves non-graphical output cells.

One issue I came across with the opening of files: With Sage.app running, but the server not active, opening a .txt file via Open With... -> Sage.app did not work.  I resolved this by noting that my sage.log complained "Worksheet admin/xx does not exist".  Deleting the ~/.sage/sagenb.../admin/xx folder fixed the problem and the text file opened fine.

Otherwise, when instructing Sage.app to open files, it does not matter whether the server is running, or Sage.app is running.  Sage.app will open and start the server as necessary and open up the files.

Uploading like this should work exactly like uploading from the interface.  I would have thought that `.sws.zip` files would work, but I can't swear that I tested it.  I will do it later tonight.

> One issue I came across with the opening of files: With Sage.app running, but the server not active, opening a .txt file via Open With... -> Sage.app did not work.  I resolved this by noting that my sage.log complained "Worksheet admin/xx does not exist".  Deleting the ~/.sage/sagenb.../admin/xx folder fixed the problem and the text file opened fine.

I have seen this before (complaining about worksheets not existing).  I don't know if it's related to Sage.app (I suspect not), but I haven't been able to replicate it reliably.  If you have a replication path that would be great (and probably a separate trac ticket).  

After you deleted that, were you able to open the text file with the server not active?

> Otherwise, when instructing Sage.app to open files, it does not matter whether the server is running, or Sage.app is running.  Sage.app will open and start the server as necessary and open up the files.

Excellent.

Is this reproducible?  I just tried it, and didn't see that behavior, so it may be a timing issue somewhere (which would be nice to find, but potentially quite hard).

I just checked the notebook code and it doesn't open the worksheet in a zip file because there can be many of them in the zip file so it doesn't know which one to open.

It was reproducible when I had the line

`export SAGE_ROOT="/Applications/Sage.app/Contents/Resources/sage"`

in my ~/.bashrc.  Changing the line to 

`export SAGE_ROOT="/Applications/Sage.app/Contents/Resources/sage/"`

resulted in different behavior: Server opens once and pops up a window with the error message mentioned previously.

My test case has one .sws file in it.

The second is what I saw.  However, unless I am mistaken, you should not be setting `SAGE_ROOT`.  You shouldn't need to, and IIRC it can lead to problems.

Yes, but the code is not that clever. :-)


I figured out the `sws.zip` file problem and created a [pull request](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/issues/76) for the notebook.

**Attachment:** [trac_11026-fix-parse-error.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11026/trac_11026-fix-parse-error.patch)

I found a problem where Sage.app could incorrectly determine if the server was running!  I was assuming that a string had a final null byte, but that wasn't guaranteed.  So depending on the contents of memory it would often work correctly but could fail.  I think it works more often when debugging which is partly why I hadn't noticed it before.  I have included it as a separate patch so there is less to review.

This should fix the problem of starting the server twice.

One way to get the server to start twice is as follows (with the extcode patch but no fix-parse-error patch and no sagenb fix for the .sws.zip business):

1. Attempt to open a .sws.zip file from Finder.
2. Quit Sage.app & all python2.7 processes.
3. Attempt to open the same .sws.zip file.

Applying the fix-parse-error patch indeed fixes the issue; the server starts only once and pulls up the "Error opening the worksheet" page after step 3.

With the extcode patch and the fix-parse-error patch, Sage.app:

* starts and stops the server properly,
* handles .txt, .txt.zip, and .sws files properly when they are opened from Finder,
* hasn't started the server twice in my testing.

My machine is so old and slow that this still causes problems.  Double clicking does indeed work to start Sage (as it has for a while) but I have no fewer than three open tabs for it.
* One asking to sign in, with a redirect to loading the worksheet (of course I have no idea what my login is! blanks, admin/sage, admin/admin all don't work)
* One asking to sign in, with the "startup_token" thing for logging in, perhaps, but it didn't log in yet
* One with a list of my active worksheets (!)

Once I am actually already started, it does upload as promised!  I think maybe you can add something to the README for the Mac app that says "user beware" on very old systems with little RAM and/or 10.4/10.5 and/or PPC, and I would be satisfied.

I think we *do* need someone to make sure it at least bdists and starts correctly on 10.8.  John, would you be willing to do the following?
* Add these patches to the extcode repo (data/sage/ext, I think)
* `export SAGE_APP_BUNDLE=yes`
* `./sage -bdist Sage-testing-doubleclick`
* Wait
* Move the bdist app somewhere and use it to double click an sws file
We just need to make sure this doesn't break something horribly.

As far as double-clicking, I already have this. Maybe I told the OS to use the Sage app to always open sws files before?

But nothing seems to be horribly broken.

These warnings (and the one noted by kcrisman) should be harmless.

We can remove this.  The file is for localizing some of the strings, but we don't do that anyway.  It used to be that it was an xml plist file, but I guess they changed it to be a binary plist file in order to save space.  The `^S` is an unrelated problem.

I'm adding a patch fixing the warnings and removing the `^S`.

Um.  What exactly does it do?  Until recently there wasn't a way to upload the sws file to the notebook server. Well, at least not easily.  So I would be surprised if it worked "correctly" for you, namely, creating a new worksheet from the sws file.  Double clicking other types of files has worked for a long time.

Oh, you're right. The file already had the correct icon, and when I double-clicked on it, the Sage app opened, but then it gave me an error message about some other ticket (which was closed as a duplicate of this one).

With the patches applied, it seems to work right.
