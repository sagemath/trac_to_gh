There are a lot places in the Sage library which use

```
except:
```
This is bad because it catches non-errors like `KeyboardInterrupt`.

---

Then the patch [attachment:11310_auto.patch] has ben auto-generated to replace all instances of

```
except:
```
by

```
except StandardError:
```
and all instances of

```
raise Exception
```
by

```
raise RuntimeError
```

**Apply** [attachment:trac_11310.patch] and [attachment:11310_auto.patch] and [attachment:11310_psage.patch].

Then what should it be? According to the [hierarchy of exceptions](http://docs.python.org/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy) I think `StandardError` encapsulates most of what can go wrong. It is at least better than a blank `except:`.

About the `RuntimeError`s I think some of them should be `ValueError` and I spotted one which should be an `AttributeError`.

I'm currently going though the auto-generated patch and fixing the obvious things by hand.  Note that the title of this ticket isn't "totally fix all exceptions inside Sage".

The main point is to not catch `KeyboardInterrupt` errors.
