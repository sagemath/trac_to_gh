There are a lot places in the Sage library which use

```
except:
```
This is bad because it catches non-errors like `KeyboardInterrupt`.

Then the patch [attachment: 11310_auto.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11310/11310_auto.patch.gz) has ben auto-generated to replace all instances of

```
except:
```
by

```
except StandardError:
```
and all instances of

```
raise Exception
```
by

```
raise RuntimeError
```
