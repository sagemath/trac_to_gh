It would be useful to copy a linear program, so that one doesn't have to recopy the constraints. Unfortunately, this crashes Sage, and pretty hard.

```
sage: eqs = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: eqs2 = copy(eqs)
sage: eqs2

------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

Copying works only if there are no constraints... that's said, it's not clear to me where the error here lies.


```
sage: lp = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: lp.add_constraint(lp[0]-lp[1],min=1)
sage: lp.add_constraint(2*lp[1] - lp[0] - lp[2],min=1)

Yo !

It actually only failed when using the lp[x] variables instead of creating new variables and using the to define the constraints `;-)`

Patch updated.

It is better to create a new ticket as this one already has a patch and fixes a nasty bug.

Instead of `free()` you should use `sage_free()`, just like you use `sage_malloc()`.

It turns out that changing this method was not a good idea though. Avoiding to use the C++ class was intended as a way to save on unseless computations, but it looks like the Coin library transforms the arrays into the same structure immediately when called, so everything is done twice, so I removed that part `:-)`

By the way, do you know what is the difference between sage_free and free, or between sage_malloc and malloc ? I always wondered `:-)`

Interrupts.  An interrupt during `malloc()` or `free()` will likely crash Sage but `sage_malloc()` and friends contain code to block interrupts.
