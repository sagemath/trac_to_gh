It would be useful to copy a linear program, so that one doesn't have to recopy the constraints. Unfortunately, this crashes Sage, and pretty hard.

```
sage: eqs = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: eqs2 = copy(eqs)
sage: eqs2

------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

Copying works only if there are no constraints... that's said, it's not clear to me where the error here lies.

Yo !

It actually only failed when using the lp[x] variables instead of creating new variables and using the to define the constraints `;-)`

Patch updated.

It is better to create a new ticket as this one already has a patch and fixes a nasty bug.

Did you provide the correct attachment? It has the same filename, and I'm getting the same error.

Yop !

It is indeed the new file. The difference with the former file is the line :

```
p._default_mipvariable = self._default_mipvariable

Okay, I'll try it again. I think I wrecked my sage installation anyway, so I'm reinstalling it.
