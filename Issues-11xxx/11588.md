It would be useful to copy a linear program, so that one doesn't have to recopy the constraints. Unfortunately, this crashes Sage, and pretty hard.

```
sage: eqs = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: eqs2 = copy(eqs)
sage: eqs2

------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

Yo !

It actually only failed when using the lp[x] variables instead of creating new variables and using the to define the constraints `;-)`

Patch updated.

It is better to create a new ticket as this one already has a patch and fixes a nasty bug.
