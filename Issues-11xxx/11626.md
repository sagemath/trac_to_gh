sage: n(erf(2),54)
...
NotImplementedError: erf not implemented for precision higher than 53
```
However, MPFR contains a multiple precision implementation of erf.
It should be straightforward to use.

Paul

PS: maybe this ticket is duplicate. It is not easy to search for `erf` in trac, a feature, like `grep -w erf` is missing,
and the [TracSearch](../wiki/TracSearch) help is not very useful...

Does #1173 solve this (it uses mpmath)?  It's certainly possible there to do `erf(2).n(54)` or such, not sure about your syntax as I don't have a Sage install with this patch currently.  But this should do it.

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A1):
> Does #1173 solve this (it uses mpmath)?

yes it does:

```

sage: n(erf(2),100)
0.99532226501895273416206925637
sage: erf(2).n(100)
0.99532226501895273416206925637
```

Thus as soon as #1173 is closed, we can close this ticket too.
