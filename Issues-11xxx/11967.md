(The problem has been solved -- see below -- though I haven't figured out what the right patch should be yet.  A solution to get Sage to startup without segfault is to delete local/lib/python2.6/config/libpython2.6.a and replace it by local/lib/libpython2.6.dylib, then rebuild the pynac spkg and the Sage library.)

After getting Sage to building (as explained at #11881), we get

```
$ sage -gdb
then "bt" for a backtrace:

I looked into this further, but haven't solved the problem.     I made an *empty* Cython file a.pyx with Extension description:

```
    Extension('sage.symbolic.a',
              sources = ['sage/symbolic/a.pyx'],
              language = 'c++',
              depends = ginac_depends,
              libraries = ["pynac", "gmp"]),
```

then I did "sage -ipython" and "import sage.symbolic.a", and I get exactly the same crash as when import sage.all. 
I looked at the traceback more carefully.   The line

```
#0  PyInt_FromLong (ival=Cannot access memory at address 0x0
) at intobject.c:91
```
occurs in the Python library in this code:

```
#if NSMALLNEGINTS + NSMALLPOSINTS > 0
	if (-NSMALLNEGINTS <= ival && ival < NSMALLPOSINTS) {
		v = small_ints[ival + NSMALLNEGINTS];
		Py_INCREF(v);                                      <------------------------ ***
#ifdef COUNT_ALLOCS
```

Thus the array small_ints -- this is some "object pool" (maybe) -- hasn't been initialized.
This was called from the Pynac library on startup where various constants (e.g., 1,2,3,4,5, etc., ) are defined.  In particular, this line in pynac's numeric.cpp causes the trouble:

```
    t = PYOBJECT;
    if (!(v._pyobject = PyInt_FromLong(x)))
      py_error("Error creating int");
```

This *feels* to me a lot like what would happen if two separate copies of the Python library were linked in.  One of them hasn't been initialized yet, so the object pool is nonsense.    However, I don't see a static libpython sitting around anywhere, so I'm not quite sure what happened.

I've put sage-4.7.3.alpha1, built from source on a 10.6 computer (bsd.math) and on a 10.7 computer (my laptop), then moved the 10.6 built one to the 10.7 computer.  The version built on 10.6 starts up on 10.7 just fine, but of course the version built on 10.7 crashes as explained above.    I looked at the file local/lib/libpynac-0.2.3.dylib in each install, and they are different:

```
10.6$ ls -l local/lib/libpynac-0.2.3.dylib 
-rwxr-xr-x  1 wstein  staff  3176552 Nov  2 18:15 local/lib/libpynac-0.2.3.dylib
10.7$  ls -l local/lib/libpynac-0.2.3.dylib 
-rwxr-xr-x  1 wstein  staff  5144444 Nov  2 18:27 local/lib/libpynac-0.2.3.dylib
```
Notice that the version that works is much smaller.  The bad one (on 10.7) has twice as many symbols:

```
10.6$ nm -o local/lib/libpynac-0.2.3.dylib|wc -l
4665
10.7$ nm -o local/lib/libpynac-0.2.3.dylib|wc -l
9526
```
Check out this:

```
10.6$nm -o local/lib/libpynac-0.2.3.dylib|grep -i Py_INCREF
but
10.7$ nm -o local/lib/libpynac-0.2.3.dylib|grep -i Py_INCREF
local/lib/libpynac-0.2.3.dylib: 00000000001a9750 T _Py_IncRef
```

This suggests again that the build of Pynac on OS X 10.7 is now broken and somehow accidentally links in another copy of Python.   

Looking at the build log, we find this during the pynac build (on 10.7):

```
-L/Users/wstein/sage/install/sage-4.7.3.alpha1/local/lib/python2.6/config -lpython2.6 
```
and in that -L'd directory we find only an "evil" static libpython2.6.a:

```
$ ls local/lib/python2.6/config
Makefile	Setup.config	config.c	install-sh	makesetup
Setup		Setup.local	config.c.in	libpython2.6.a	python.o
```

The same libpython2.6.a is in that directory in the 10.6 version.  The same build line appears there to.  So... I'm guessing that one of the changes in XCode 4.x is to make it so that -L works differently.  In fact, what now happens (that causes this problem) does seem pretty reasonable to me.

My first attempt to fix this is to rebuild the pynac spkg, but with libpython2.6.dylib simply copied into the local/lib/python2.6/config directory.   That one change was *not* sufficient to fix the problem, but I bet something related will work...

OK, I'm next rebuilding everything (pynac spkg + "sage -ba"), with that static library (mentioned in the previous comment above) *deleted* to avoid it accidentally getting linked in somewhere.    This did not help.  Starting Sage fails with this traceback now (different than before):

```

What's happening here is this code is run during pynac initialization and totally fails due to the `PyImport_ImportModule(...)` failing, returning an error pointer that is invalid, which again suggests that the PYthon library is somehow not properly initialized. 

```
PyObject* Integer(const long int& x) {
  if (initialized) 
    return GiNaC::py_funcs.py_integer_from_long(x);
  
  // Slow version since we can't call Cython-exported code yet.
  PyObject* m = PyImport_ImportModule("sage.rings.integer");
  if (!m)
    py_error("Error importing sage.rings.integer");
```

I don't see anything wrong with checking whether "$CC" is "gcc", as long as it's just a preliminary check, not the only check.
