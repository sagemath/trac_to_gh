Ubuntu 11.04 derivative Mint 11 and other newer Debian GNU/Linux derivatives fail to build the Python spkg.

This is a known issue in #11243 on Ubuntu 11.04, and any derivatives such as Mint 11 will suffer from this as well.

Jan, if you want to make sure someone sees a ticket, you will need to cc: them like I am doing with drkirkby now.

You could also put the person for whom it worked properly (as you mentioned on sage-devel) as a reviewer - why not?  They helped, after all, even if they can't check that the code is fine (which it certainly seems to me, but I don't know what etc/issue is for sure).

These should not be two '|' characters in the egrep expression. 


```
drkirkby@hawk:~$ echo foo | egrep "Ubuntu 11.04||Linux Mint 11 Katya"
egrep: syntax error
drkirkby@hawk:~$ 
```

There should be only one. 

You also need to create a new package, so we can test the complete package, but this looks pretty simple to me. 

It would be good if we could attempt to find other popular Ubuntu derivatives that will get the problem and include the patch for them too. But that's not important - just nice if possible to do easily.

Thanks Dave, new patch following. I made a typo with the pipe, but it 
did not throw a syntax error on Ubuntu (I think it parsed 
"Ubuntu 11.04" or "" or "Linux Mint 11 Katya". The empty string matched
every line though which is another problem. This is however why
the spkg compiled properly for the Linux Mint tester/reviewer.

I'm not sure he has a trac account (for reviewing).

Yes, it is hidden in the original thread which lead to ticket #11243.
http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/11243
http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/593b9a4124f5075d

If the way to check for Linux Release/Distribution it is suboptimal, do you know of a better way?
(It is a patch that Debian and Ubuntu and therefore all derivatives apply to their own python debs for python to build.)

It comes down to this http://bugs.python.org/issue9762 .
It may be fixed in python 2.7 http://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/bd0f73a9538e
but those are beyond my experience.

Well, it is dead simple: **don't** check the Linux Release/Distribution.  Would it make sense to apply the workaround on all Linux systems or could that break things?

The solution that's in Python 2.7 and in Debian's patches to Python 2.6 (patch deb-setup.diff attached) is to use `dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_MULTIARCH`.  These packages use this command to set the library paths correctly.

This requires that the optional package dpkg-dev is installed.  A wrapper should probably be written that complains if `lsb_release -i` is (Debian|Ubuntu|Mint) and `dpkg-architecture` is not present, otherwise the build will fail without the user knowing why...

11447-Python-Debian-multiarch.patch uses the solution from Python 2.7 to fix build on Debian and derivatives with multiarch.

The patch to python-2.6.4.p10/src/setup.py is applied on all hosts, not just Debian and derivatives, but the new code will end up doing nothing on non-Debian-derived hosts.  This is how the build is set up in Python 2.7.

Note that on Debian and derivatives, if the command dpkg-architecture, from the package dpkg-dev, is not available, the build will fail as before.  Again, this is how Python 2.7 is set up.

This looks like the best solution to me.

No, -lcrypt is not uncommented in Setup.dist on any system.

The library search directories are now set up in setup.py on Debian and derivatives to correctly find libcrypt automatically.  There is no change to the library search directories on other systems.  This is done by testing for the presence of the command 'dpkg-architecture'.

I don't see any side effects and this is how it is done in Python 2.7.

(Setup.dist is a work around for setup.py not automatically finding the libraries.)

Just to make it a bit clearer: The code also doesn't change the search paths on *older Debian / Ubuntu systems*, regardless if `dpkg-architecture` is installed or not, so won't break anything there.

(Tested with Ubuntu 9.04 and 10.04; `dpkg-architecture` there doesn't know `DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH` and therefore exits with a non-zero status such that nothing gets added to the paths.)




> Note that on Debian and derivatives, if the command `dpkg-architecture`, from the package dpkg-dev, is not available, the build will fail as before.


Again, of course the build will only fail on *newer* Debian derivatives which require a change (more precisely: additions) to the search paths.

Could someone please update the p11 / provide a new p11 spkg (by applying only [attachment:11447-Python-Debian-multiarch.patch] to p10 I guess)?

P.S.:

I think if the test importing the `crypt` module (in `spkg-install`) fails and `dpkg-architecture` isn't installed, the user should get a hint on installing it (i.e., `dpkg-dev`; maybe only on newer Debian derivatives, but this could also just be part of the message.)

Otherwise we should at least document this in the Sage Installation Guide, and perhaps also on one of the wiki pages.

So adding a note on installing `dpkg-dev` to the "Known Issues" / wiki page(s) is sufficient? (I can't judge how common it is to *not* have it installed.)

It's perhaps to specific to get into the Sage Installation Guide.

or

```

Mixed usage of `cp` of `patch`, better always use `patch`.

On SunOS, you first patch `setup.py` and then copy a different version over it.

Patching is better done using one `for` loop to prevent an error-prone laundry list of patches to be applied.

Why call `./configure` with arguments `CC="$CC $CFLAGS" CXX="$CXX $CXXFLAGS"`?  Any why only on certain systems?

```
MAKE=make; export MAKE
make -i install
```
should be

```
$MAKE -j1 -i install
```

Remove this:

```
# Do not exit script if there is an error, but instead print an
# informative error message. This is helps in determining why the
# configuration, compilation or installation failed. So put this before the
# build() function.
set +e # This is redundant here, but doesn't hurt to keep it... ;-)
```

Why this:

```
echo "Sleeping for three seconds before testing python"
sleep 3
```

I guess `EXTRAFLAGS` is only used inside the `spkg-install` script, so why export it?

On SunOS, do we need the configure flag `--with-gcc="gcc -m64"` given that `-m64` is already inside `$OPT`?  Or, if `$OPT` does nothing, why specify `$OPT`?

Yes, I mentioned on the ticket that I forgot it; minor.

Agreed, but didn't want to change too much, since it is a blocker and needs quick review.

Hmmm, depends on the situation. Order might matter, and not all patches are applied on all systems. You'd also have to delete (or rename) patches that [currently] don't get applied anymore. Having a bit of redundancy in `spkg-install` and `SPKG.txt` also isn't that bad, as it should reduce the risk of unintentional changes.

But we still have the `cp`s in there anyway, so this should be changed when all patches get real patches.



> Why call `./configure` with arguments `CC="$CC $CFLAGS" CXX="$CXX $CXXFLAGS"`?  Any why only on certain systems?


Guess that's some libtool issue, which sometimes drops e.g. `-m64`, but apparently not on all systems (or it doesn't matter on all).

I know. I always get beaten when I change such, as some people consider it to be a "dangerous change"... (I put a comment on that in.)

Orrr.

See above ("dangerous change"). I added a comment that this is certainly no longer necessary, on the other hand it doesn't hurt much.

> I guess `EXTRAFLAGS` is only used inside the `spkg-install` script, so why export it?


Typical stupidity. Only one of N instances of that.

> On SunOS, do we need the configure flag `--with-gcc="gcc -m64"` given that `-m64` is already inside `$OPT`?  Or, if `$OPT` does nothing, why specify `$OPT`?


That's again related to libtool I think.

---

If you come across such things and don't want to fix them immediately, it's IMHO best to simply put comments into the files or `SPKG.txt`. Comments don't hurt and don't have to be tested, so no reviewer should complain about them (as opposed to too many or "difficult" functional changes).

Also, the next one touching the spkg (or files in general) hopefully will take them into account, and doesn't have to search trac for older tickets with open issues.
