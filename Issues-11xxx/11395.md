On Gentoo we already did this, so here a little summary what to do:

- in sage/interfaces/gfan.py, we have to change `cmd = 'gfan'` to `cmd = 'gfan_bases'` because the earlier is deprecated. If we do not do this, gfan prints:

 This is the Gfan program for computing Groebner fans and tropical varieties.
 Use the command "gfan list" to view all subcommands.
 The command "gfan" is deprecate for computing all Groebner bases of an ideal.
 Please use subcommand "gfan _bases" instead. Awaiting input. <Ctrl>-D to end.

 This confuses the current error detection code which assumes every output before commands as an error.

- after adjusting the interface code, we have to review the failing doctests. On my box these are:
  - sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage-main/doc/fr/tutorial/tour_advanced.rst
  - sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage-main/doc/en/tutorial/tour_advanced.rst
  - sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage-main/sage/rings/polynomial/groebner_fan.py

 I did not have a closer look at them, but they look like gfan-0.5 reorders its output.

A candidate package is at 
[http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhampton/gfan-0.5.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhampton/gfan-0.5.spkg)

I will take your suggestion on patching the interface.  I am aware of some other issues that need to be fixed; I was going to put those on another ticket but if 0.5 changes its output anyway I suppose it makes sense to put both the update and interface patches in one ticket.

It is not obvious that the two answers are equivalent, I was going to submit it to the opinion of sage-devel on Monday. 

On another note, do you know what this section of the Makefile is all about

```
ifeq ($(sagepath),)
SAGE_LINKOPTIONS = 
SAGE_INCLUDEOPTIONS =
else
SAGE_LINKOPTIONS = -L$(sagepath)/ -lpython2.6 -lcsage -lsingular
SAGE_INCLUDEOPTIONS = -I $(sagepath)/
SAGE_OBJECTS = sage.o sage_link.so

sage_link.so: sage_link.pyx setup.py
       python setup.py build_ext --inplace --pyrex-include-dirs=$(SAGE_ROOT)/devel/sage/
endif
```
It is not build by default and the cython source is missing (the resulting .cpp is present) but it looks like someone is looking at producing their own sage-extension.

I hope to make some progress on this ticket for Sage-Combinat Days 40, July 9-13.
So far, I have a working spkg on my mac, but I need to figure out if the gcc-4.5.0 patches need to be rebased for portability.  I also want to add in some interface improvements (supporting symmetry for example).

In case anyone is interested in helping I will post my progress.

Patch works great but there are more instances of tests of gfan in the documentation:
