<a id='comment:1'></a>On Gentoo we already did this, so here a little summary what to do:

- in sage/interfaces/gfan.py, we have to change `cmd = 'gfan'` to `cmd = 'gfan_bases'` because the earlier is deprecated. If we do not do this, gfan prints:

 This is the Gfan program for computing Groebner fans and tropical varieties.
 Use the command "gfan list" to view all subcommands.
 The command "gfan" is deprecate for computing all Groebner bases of an ideal.
 Please use subcommand "gfan _bases" instead. Awaiting input. <Ctrl>-D to end.

 This confuses the current error detection code which assumes every output before commands as an error.

- after adjusting the interface code, we have to review the failing doctests. On my box these are:
  - sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage-main/doc/fr/tutorial/tour_advanced.rst
  - sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage-main/doc/en/tutorial/tour_advanced.rst
  - sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage-main/sage/rings/polynomial/groebner_fan.py

 I did not have a closer look at them, but they look like gfan-0.5 reorders its output.

It is not obvious that the two answers are equivalent, I was going to submit it to the opinion of sage-devel on Monday. 

On another note, do you know what this section of the Makefile is all about

```
ifeq ($(sagepath),)
SAGE_LINKOPTIONS = 
SAGE_INCLUDEOPTIONS =
else
SAGE_LINKOPTIONS = -L$(sagepath)/ -lpython2.6 -lcsage -lsingular
SAGE_INCLUDEOPTIONS = -I $(sagepath)/
SAGE_OBJECTS = sage.o sage_link.so

sage_link.so: sage_link.pyx setup.py
       python setup.py build_ext --inplace --pyrex-include-dirs=$(SAGE_ROOT)/devel/sage/
endif
```
It is not build by default and the cython source is missing (the resulting .cpp is present) but it looks like someone is looking at producing their own sage-extension.
