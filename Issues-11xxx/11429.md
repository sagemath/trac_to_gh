```
We want our own code to enumerate lattice points in polyhedra because:
* Going through the PALP pexpect interface is annoyingly slow. 
* no more compile-time bounds
* It seems like PALP uses a very unsophisticated algorithm:

    ```
    sage: v = [(1,0,7,-1), (-2,-2,4,-3), (-1,-1,-1,4), (2,9,0,-5), (-2,-1,5,1)]
    sage: lp = LatticePolytope(matrix(v).transpose()); lp
    A lattice polytope: 4-dimensional, 5 vertices.
    sage: lp.npoints()
  ```
  takes forever with PALP but only 500ms with my Python code.

Comparing timings, it seems that PALP always runs over the integral points of a rectangular bounding box. This is good for small polytopes (low overhead) but bad for large ones. To match PALP's speed for small polytopes, I implemented the same algorithm in Cython (the second patch) and use it for bounding boxes containing <50k points.

Hi Volker,

Would it make any sense to somehow unite these functions/classes with your PPL wrapper, which already has stuff for inequalities and their systems? Do you know if they (PPL-people) have plans on algorithms for point counts and point listing?

There are also functions without documentation or without full description of input/output...

I don't know the PPL future plans, but I don't think that some Cython code would fit into their project. Its also not functionality that fits with their core misson objective, I think.

I haven't used the usual standards of documentation for cdef'd functions since they aren't reachable from Python, so you'll never see the help. Nor can you write Python doctests for them. Also, I think documenting input/output is implicit when you have typed arguments.

Line numbers are for the new module in the big patch:
1. 224: should be `if A is not None:` for robustness (zero matrices evaluate to `False`)
2. 231: should be `if A is None:`
3. 273-275: Why there is a conversion to set? Is it expected that the output contains repetitions?
4. 293: shouldn't `translate_points` be used here?
5. 336: No description of input/output and what happens if the polyhedron is not specified.
6. In the code of this function: why is it necessary to use this permutation? It seems like an extra operation on all of the points, although I believe that there is some reason ;-) Perhaps it can be explained in the documentation or comments.
7. 421: Incomplete INPUT, missing OUTPUT, no real EXAMPLE.
8. 440: While this function is inaccessible from Sage directly, it still would be nice to have a comment on what it does and what is d.
9. 477: If I am correct, this condition is always true. In which case it can be removed, as well the next line, and 444 moved into the beginning of outer while. (Just for making code a little simpler.)
10. I didn't yet looked carefully at the rest, but just one more pick at 575: Is it really necessary to have `DEF INEQ_INT_MAX_DIM = 20`? I mean can't it be without hard-coded limits?

Will look over the second half of the new module in the next few days, I am fine with the rest of the code.

Speedwise PALP is still more efficient for small polytopes, but of course only if one can call PALP at once for a lot of them, which is not always possible:

```
sage: len(ReflexivePolytopes(3))
4319
sage: %time
sage: ps = [Polyhedron(vertices=p.vertices().columns()) for p in ReflexivePolytopes(3)]
CPU time: 83.87 s,  Wall time: 218.85 s
sage: %time
sage: for p, lp in zip(ps, ReflexivePolytopes(3)):                                    
...       if len(p.integral_points()) != lp.npoints():
...           print lp
CPU time: 10.10 s,  Wall time: 10.30 s
sage: %time
sage: lattice_polytope.all_points(ReflexivePolytopes(3))
CPU time: 2.90 s,  Wall time: 3.46 s
```
The last line is actually somewhat sad: PALP spends half a second to compute all the points and then Sage spends 3 seconds to read its output and convert into matrices. But hopefully objects of new generations will be more efficient ;-)
