We want our own code to enumerate lattice points in polyhedra because:
* Going through the PALP pexpect interface is annoyingly slow. 
* no more compile-time bounds
* It seems like PALP uses a very unsophisticated algorithm:

    ```
    sage: v = [(1,0,7,-1), (-2,-2,4,-3), (-1,-1,-1,4), (2,9,0,-5), (-2,-1,5,1)]
    sage: lp = LatticePolytope(matrix(v).transpose()); lp
    A lattice polytope: 4-dimensional, 5 vertices.
    sage: lp.npoints()
  ```
  takes forever with PALP but only 500ms with my Python code.

Comparing timings, it seems that PALP always runs over the integral points of a rectangular bounding box. This is good for small polytopes (low overhead) but bad for large ones. To match PALP's speed for small polytopes, I implemented the same algorithm in Cython (the second patch) and use it for bounding boxes containing <50k points.

Hi Volker,

Would it make any sense to somehow unite these functions/classes with your PPL wrapper, which already has stuff for inequalities and their systems? Do you know if they (PPL-people) have plans on algorithms for point counts and point listing?

There are also functions without documentation or without full description of input/output...

Line numbers are for the new module in the big patch:
1. 224: should be `if A is not None:` for robustness (zero matrices evaluate to `False`)
2. 231: should be `if A is None:`
3. 273-275: Why there is a conversion to set? Is it expected that the output contains repetitions?
4. 293: shouldn't `translate_points` be used here?
5. 336: No description of input/output and what happens if the polyhedron is not specified.
6. In the code of this function: why is it necessary to use this permutation? It seems like an extra operation on all of the points, although I believe that there is some reason ;-) Perhaps it can be explained in the documentation or comments.
7. 421: Incomplete INPUT, missing OUTPUT, no real EXAMPLE.
8. 440: While this function is inaccessible from Sage directly, it still would be nice to have a comment on what it does and what is d.
9. 477: If I am correct, this condition is always true. In which case it can be removed, as well the next line, and 444 moved into the beginning of outer while. (Just for making code a little simpler.)
10. I didn't yet looked carefully at the rest, but just one more pick at 575: Is it really necessary to have `DEF INEQ_INT_MAX_DIM = 20`? I mean can't it be without hard-coded limits?

Will look over the second half of the new module in the next few days, I am fine with the rest of the code.

Speedwise PALP is still more efficient for small polytopes, but of course only if one can call PALP at once for a lot of them, which is not always possible:

```
sage: len(ReflexivePolytopes(3))
4319
sage: %time
sage: ps = [Polyhedron(vertices=p.vertices().columns()) for p in ReflexivePolytopes(3)]
CPU time: 83.87 s,  Wall time: 218.85 s
sage: %time
sage: for p, lp in zip(ps, ReflexivePolytopes(3)):                                    
...       if len(p.integral_points()) != lp.npoints():
...           print lp
CPU time: 10.10 s,  Wall time: 10.30 s
sage: %time
sage: lattice_polytope.all_points(ReflexivePolytopes(3))
CPU time: 2.90 s,  Wall time: 3.46 s
```
The last line is actually somewhat sad: PALP spends half a second to compute all the points and then Sage spends 3 seconds to read its output and convert into matrices. But hopefully objects of new generations will be more efficient ;-)

    "body": "<a id='comment:12'></a>\n3. I added a `len(pts)` to the `len(set(pts))` to clarify - the doctests checks that all points are distinct.\n   6. The coordinates are permuted such that the largest edge of the bounding  box becomes the inner loop. The inner loop is optimized to run very fast, so we save wall time by doing the maximal amount of work there.\n   9. No `inc` will usually be `1`. Usually you'll only have to call `prepare_inner_loop` between two inner loops. Only if the \"odometer ticks over\" you need to call `prepare_next_to_inner_loop`. In terms of the coordinates `(x1,x2,x3,...)` of the box, the inner loop runs over `x1`. It suffices to only call `prepare_inner_loop` as long as only `x1`, `x2` change. You need to call `prepare_next_to_inner_loop` if more coordinates changed from one inner loop to the next. \n   10. The dimension limit is only used for the machine integer representation of inequalities. Its not a real limit, in higher dimensions the generic Python implementation is used.\n\nThere is some overhead to avoid integer overflows and the like, which is a good thing. Possible improvements are\n- don't permute coordinates (overhead) for really really small polyhedra, and\n- allow to just count points without enumeration (since we already find upper/lower bound in inner loop).",

3. I added a `len(pts)` to the `len(set(pts))` to clarify - the doctests checks that all points are distinct.
   6. The coordinates are permuted such that the largest edge of the bounding  box becomes the inner loop. The inner loop is optimized to run very fast, so we save wall time by doing the maximal amount of work there.
   9. No `inc` will usually be `1`. Usually you'll only have to call `prepare_inner_loop` between two inner loops. Only if the "odometer ticks over" you need to call `prepare_next_to_inner_loop`. In terms of the coordinates `(x1,x2,x3,...)` of the box, the inner loop runs over `x1`. It suffices to only call `prepare_inner_loop` as long as only `x1`, `x2` change. You need to call `prepare_next_to_inner_loop` if more coordinates changed from one inner loop to the next. 
   10. The dimension limit is only used for the machine integer representation of inequalities. Its not a real limit, in higher dimensions the generic Python implementation is used.

There is some overhead to avoid integer overflows and the like, which is a good thing. Possible improvements are
- don't permute coordinates (overhead) for really really small polyhedra, and
- allow to just count points without enumeration (since we already find upper/lower bound in inner loop).
