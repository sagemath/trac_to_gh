<a id='comment:3'></a>With the last patch numpy is not loaded in *./sage* and *./sage --startuptime*. Surprisingly this doctest fails, i.e., numpy is loaded in the doctests.

```
sage: import sys 
sage: 'numpy' in sys.modules 
False
```
I'll post something about the startup improvement once the full doctest run finished.
