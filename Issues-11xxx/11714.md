This might or might not be worth it.  Numpy is actually pretty fast these days (<.05 seconds), and the work needed to not import it is pretty scary.  The attached patch causes all kinds of subtle trouble.

With the last patch numpy is not loaded in *./sage* and *./sage --startuptime*. Surprisingly this doctest fails, i.e., numpy is loaded in the doctests.

```
sage: import sys 
sage: 'numpy' in sys.modules 
False
```
I'll post something about the startup improvement once the full doctest run finished.

This passes "make ptestlong" for me, except for the issue with 'numpy' in sys.modules.
