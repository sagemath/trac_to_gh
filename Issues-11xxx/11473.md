To keep track of the symbolic patches that we were working on at Sage Days 31:

**Merged in Sage-4.7.1.alpha3 but not yet in alpha2**

* #11320: deprecated_function_alias for Cython classes

**Positively reviewed and ready to be merged**

* #11377: Clean and harmonize module_list.py
* #9989: easier access to operands of a symbolic expression
* #10859: Add is_series() method and others to symbolic expressions


**Needs review**

* #7496: symbolic variable names should be valid identifiers
  * obsoletes #9724: Sage allows creation of variables with empty name



**TODO**


* #9880: Segfault in PyNaC 0.2.0.p4.
   * obsoletes #11415: update pynac to 0.2.3
   * obsoletes #11423: Make atan2(0,0) consistent
* #11339: Illegal use of `__deallocate__` in cython (pyx) code
