A common step in toric geometry is to construct the fan from some triangulation. This patch adds a `fan()` method to the triangulation class, so you can write:

```
sage: pc = PointConfiguration([(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (-1,-1)], star=0, fine=True)
sage: triangulation = pc.triangulate()
sage: fan = triangulation.fan(); fan
Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N
sage: fan.is_equivalent( toric_varieties.P2().fan() )
True
```

There were some doctest errors, I have fixed them and made fan construction more straightforward. As a pleasant side effect, fan rays should now repeat the order of points ;-)

If everything is OK, please switch to positive review!
