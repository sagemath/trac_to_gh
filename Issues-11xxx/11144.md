The doc for `is_auto_update` at [this page](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sagenb/notebook/interact.html) shows that there is an underscore that is formatting a 'u' incorrectly.  Probably this is a one-or-two-character fix, though I haven't checked it out.  Most likely someone used <code>\`\`</code> instead of <code>\`</code>?

You've patched the wrong file, `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/interact.py`.  Note that this file says at the top

```
# This file is part of the OLD Sage notebook and is NOT actively developed,
# maintained, or supported.  As of Sage v4.1.2, all notebook development has
# moved to the separate Sage Notebook project:
#
# http://nb.sagemath.org/
```
I've posted it instead as a patch for the sagenb project instead: see [https://code.google.com/p/sagenb/issues/detail?id=41](https://code.google.com/p/sagenb/issues/detail?id=41).

To the release manager: I think we should close this ticket as invalid, since it's for the Sage notebook, not the Sage library.  Do not apply the patch here.

It is still not at all clear to me whether there is even something as a "sagenb project" unfortunately.  I will attach a proper `sagenb` patch.

 The doc for `is_auto_update` at [this page](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sagenb/notebook/interact.html) shows that there is an underscore that is formatting a 'u' incorrectly.  Probably this is a one-or-two-character fix, though I haven't checked it out.  Most likely someone used <code>\`\`</code> instead of <code>\`</code>?

I am waiting for clarification on this situation at http://groups.google.com/group/sage-notebook/browse_thread/thread/5f8ee7606e0d94bd

The patch itself obviously gets positive_review.
