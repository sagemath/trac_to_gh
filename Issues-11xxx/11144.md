You've patched the wrong file, `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/interact.py`.  Note that this file says at the top

I've posted it instead as a patch for the sagenb project instead: see [https://code.google.com/p/sagenb/issues/detail?id=41](https://code.google.com/p/sagenb/issues/detail?id=41).

To the release manager: I think we should close this ticket as invalid, since it's for the Sage notebook, not the Sage library.  Do not apply the patch here.

It is still not at all clear to me whether there is even something as a "sagenb project" unfortunately.  I will attach a proper `sagenb` patch.
