You've patched the wrong file, `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/interact.py`.  Note that this file says at the top

```
# This file is part of the OLD Sage notebook and is NOT actively developed,
# maintained, or supported.  As of Sage v4.1.2, all notebook development has
# moved to the separate Sage Notebook project:
#
# http://nb.sagemath.org/
```
I've posted it instead as a patch for the sagenb project instead: see [https://code.google.com/p/sagenb/issues/detail?id=41](https://code.google.com/p/sagenb/issues/detail?id=41).

To the release manager: I think we should close this ticket as invalid, since it's for the Sage notebook, not the Sage library.  Do not apply the patch here.

It is still not at all clear to me whether there is even something as a "sagenb project" unfortunately.  I will attach a proper `sagenb` patch.
