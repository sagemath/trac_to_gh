```
If `K` is a finite field implemented through PARI (the default if q > 2<sup>16</sup>), then we try to find a multiplicative generator by first trying all elements of `GF(p)` (the prime field).  This means the following will never finish in practice:

```
sage: p = next_prime(10^20)
sage: K.<a> = GF(p^2)
sage: K.multiplicative_generator()
```

Also, a generator for the multiplicative group is often called a "primitive element" (or primitive root).  We should add a method `primitive_element` which returns the multiplicative generator.

While attempting to see what `.. WARNING::` is supposed to do by looking at how it renders in the reference manual, I found to my surprise that this docstring does not even appear in the reference manual! Maybe we should make our autodoc a bit more automatic...?

I'll doctest the patch on `sage.math`.
