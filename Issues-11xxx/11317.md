Here is the long awaited pynac update. It includes patches from upstream (ginac) which fix Sage bugs and should be easy to review.

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.2.2.spkg

This package fixes #9891, #9947 and #8943. Attached patch also adds some more doctests to the Sage library.

I hope this can get reviewed and merged soon. There will be an new release with more substantial changes like #9880.

```

static ex tanh_conjugate(const ex & x)
{
	// conjugate(tan(x))==tan(conjugate(x))
	return tanh(x.conjugate());
}
```
The method is correct, but the doc says `tan`, not `tanh`.

As for the other things, they are nearly all compiler improvements.  I'll just check these work on sage.math, but otherwise looks good to go.
