We should automatically build a `VirtualBox/VMware` image for each Sage release. This requires some script support to create a image and perform an unattended sage install.

Here is an example of the built virtual machine that is built by the attached scripts without user intervention:

http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/Sage-4.7.rc2.ova

The virtual machine starts up in text mode and automatically runs the Sage notebook server. At first startup you are prompted to enter a password, as usual. Once you set up your admin password you have to use your **host OS** web browser to open `http://localhost:8000`. 

At this point it would be nice if somebody could try it out on a windows machine (or any other machine).

I get a "403 Forbidden" error for that file. Interestingly, I can access all of your other files in that same directory.

I'll try this on a Windows 7 box, as soon as I figure out what is needed.

I got the latest VirtualBox (4.0.6) with no guest OS installed.
Do I need anything else, apart from the .ova - file, to have it running?

for the record, it does not work, perhaps because this Windows 7 installation is itself a VMWare virtual host.
