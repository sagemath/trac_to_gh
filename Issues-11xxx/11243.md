This patch is a fix for Ubuntu 11.04. Ubuntu already patch their python like this.  It is not a python bug. It is the Ubuntu+python combination, see the above thread for an answer I got from bugs.python.org. It potentially affects future multiarch Debian/Ubuntu and derivatives. (At some point python 2.7 series
may be patched upstream though.)

## Note for the release manager

Just merge http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/python-2.6.4.p10.spkg

ignore all the patches attached to the ticket, as they are all committed in the repository.

Hi Jan,
Could you please put the trac number in SPKG.txt, then create a new .spkg so it can be reviewed.

It is better if you attach a Mercurial patch showing your changes - normally something like

```
$ hg commit
$ hg export tip > $HOME/11243-Python-Ubuntu-issue.patch
```

then attach that file to the trac ticket. There's no need to have all the other files attached. 

You will need to put something like this in $HOME/.hgrc if you don't already have it - though obviously changing the name and email

```
drkirkby@hawk:~$ cat .hgrc
[ui]
username = David Kirkby <david.kirkby@onetel.net>

[extensions]
# Enable the Mercurial queue extension.
hgext.mq =
```

My biggest concern with this ticket is that it impacts every operating system, whereas the problem is only observed on one alpha version on one Linux distribution. 

Dave

Thanks Dave. I was still busy reading the developer guides.
I have now changed the patch to check it is running on Ubuntu 11.04,
only apply if so, tested it on Ubuntu 11.04, and hg exported the attached patch.
I hope I did it right.

Note I think this affects, according to http://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/bd0f73a9538e all future multiarch debian/ubuntu (and probably other derivatives of those). My immediate concern is Ubuntu 11.04, due for release in a week, but then this will be dormant for 6 months, and there may be upstream fixes in python 2.7 at that time, and sage may be using python 2.7.

The '`lsb_release`' is not portable. It is certainly not a POSIX command, and I have no idea if it will be found on all Linux distributions. 


```
drkirkby@hawk:~$ lsb_release -d
bash: lsb_release: command not found
```

You could perhaps change your test to:

```
if [ "x$UNAME" = xLinux ] && [ "x`lsb_release -d`" = "xDescription:       Ubuntu 11.04" ] ; then 
```

but I've no idea if that will work on all Linux systems.

Replying to [@pipedream](#comment:4):
> Does it matter if it fails? If the string doesn't match, no patch is applied, as it should be.

Yes it does. It is unprofessional to use a command which fails like this, as it is disconcerting to those who don't have the command. 

A better test is:

```
if [ `command -v lsb_release` ]  && [ "x`lsb_release -d`" = "xDescription:       Ubuntu 11.04" ] ; then 
```

Then the second part will only get executed if '`lsb_release`' exists. That should be safe on any platform, even Linux systems for which the command '`lsb_release`' does not exist. The program '`command`' will exist on any operating system conforming to the POSIX standard.

http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/command.html

While Linux does not conform to POSIX standards, any distribution I am aware of will have an executable called  '`command`'

As such, I think that would be a sensible improvement. 

The next issue is that the patch copies a revised version of '`patches/Setup.dist`'. While it is true the developers guide might still say to do that, it has been agreed to use '`patch`'. So you should create a unified diff patch and apply that patch. Not only does that save space, but it allows more than one patch to be applied easily, whereas the use of '`cp`' caused problems. You can guarantee that '`patch`' will be available, as there is a Sage package for that. 

Note also your Mercurial patch should have the contents of any patch you have.

Do you mean the p9 spkg builds correctly and the fix is not necessary? Or the p10 builds correctly? Did you have the problem before with p9 or just test the p10 spkg after it was uploaded here? Does lsb_relaese -d give the output (replace first space with a tab):

No: the p9 spkg *doesn't* work, and I need the p10 spkg you created to successfully build Python in Ubuntu 11.04.

I had the problem before.

That's what I get in my virtual machine.

Attachment: **[11243-crypt-module-Ubuntu11.04-issue3.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11243/11243-crypt-module-Ubuntu11.04-issue3.patch.gz)**

All three "issue" patches need to be applied, in order. 1) change to /etc/issue instead of lsb_release 2) remove square brackets from grep test, 3) fix so it exits when patch fails, not always. This spkg does build correctly now on Ubuntu 11.04:

As a general point, I would avoid the use of '-e' to test a file, as it's not portable. In this case it does not matter as the bash shell is invoked, but it would fail if you used a Bourne shell, so had:

```
#!/bin/sh
```

at the top.

From the man page on a Solaris system:

```
     -e file                     True if file exists. (Not avail-
                                 able in sh.)
```

Using '-f' is much safer as it will be found on far more shells.

The error checking you added is not working correctly. 

I tested this first on my OpenSolaris system - it worked OK. 

Then I spoofed my machine to appear if it was Ubuntu 11.04. Your patch detected that, patched the python package, then it built OK. (Really whether it built or not was pretty irrelevant here, as I'd applied a Linux patch on Solaris). 

Next as a test I corrupted the patch. When I try to install it, now I see:

```

Patching src/Modules/Setup.dist as this is Ubuntu 11.04
patch: **** Only garbage was found in the patch input.

See: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/8440

```

In other words, despite the fact that Patch has reported the patch as garbage, the build just continues. So the error checking is not working correctly. 

The man page for '`patch`' says the exit code is 0 in the case of no error. 

There is one other issue too, which is partially my fault. When I copied over the file you had corrupted, the time stamp on the directory has been changed. So it looks like the contents of {{src/Modules}}}' have been modified, even though they have not. It would be more sensible to copy the contents exactly, retaining all dates and times, so it does not leave anyone in any doubt the contents are unmodified. 

I sometimes wonder if the files below the 'src' directory should be made read-only. That would stop accidentally changing them.

For compatibility with more shells, changed -e to -f.
My previous error testing was in a subshell and I think exited that subshell only.
I changed that to be like the exit of the other patches with an if statement checking the return value following the patch (or cp).

Patch attached and updated http://users.aims.ac.za/~jan/python-2.6.4.p10.spkg
Builds on Ubuntu 11.04. Corrupted patch fails and exits correctly.

I'm not sure how to get the src/Modules/Setup.dist to the original timestamps. I tried untarring p9 and rsyncing -av Setup.dist but the date was not reset.

I need to eat now, so can't do anything just now. 

I think the best thing is to simply "move" the "src" directory from inside the python-2.6.4.p9.spkg package to the src directory in the new python-2.6.4.p10.spkg. That will preserve everything.

I've deleted '11243-crypt-module-Ubuntu11.04.2.patch' which you put by mistake. (I have admin rights, so can delete your patches). 

This looks good, apart from one small problem - the file `patches/Modules.Setup.dist.patch` was not committed to the repository: 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.7.rc0/spkg/standard/python-2.6.4.p10$ hg status
? patches/Modules.Setup.dist.patch
```

I'm adding that as a "reviewer patch". I'm in the process of uploading a revised package. Once that is done (which is going very slowly), I'll change to positive review.

A few test failures is quite normal on Python. I don't believe anyone has ever got them all to pass.

I don't know why these occur, but you can ask on the python list if you want. 

But it does not affect this ticket.
