Assignee: @williamstein

CC:  @mstreng

Keywords: magma interface number field element convert

Apply:

* [attachment:trac_11456_sage.patch] to the main Sage source
* [attachment:trac_11456_extcode.patch] to data/extcode

This adds the following conversion functionality.

From Magma to Sage:

* Absolute and relative number fields in one or more generators (previously not possible).
* Elements of absolute and relative number fields in one generator (previously not possible).

From Sage to Magma:

* Relative number fields (previously only absolute number fields).

Converting relative number field elements from Sage to Magma is more difficult (because of garbage collection) and is left for a later patch.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11456

Beware that number fields in Magma can have bases that are not power bases:

```
> K<a,b>:=NumberField([x^2-2,x^2-3]:Abs);
> Sqrt(K!6);   
-a*b
> Eltseq(Sqrt(K!6));
[ 0, 0, 0, -1 ]
> OK:=LLL(IntegerRing(K));
> L:=FieldOfFractions(OK); //this uses the basis of OK
> Eltseq(Sqrt(L!6));      
[ 0, 1, 2, 0 ]
```
Number fields can be relative too, but that is the same in Pari.
