Currently, we have

```sh
$ ./sage --sh -c "echo Hello"

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.
Be sure to exit when you are done and do not do anything
with other copies of Sage!

Bypassing shell configuration files ...

Hello
Exited Sage subshell.
$ 
```
which is IMHO odd.

And it's inconvenient if one wants to further process the output of some command run in a Sage subshell.

In `spkg/bin/sage`, we have:

```sh
if [ "$1" = '-sh'  -o "$1" = '--sh' ]; then
    # AUTHORS:
    #   Carl Witty and William Stein: initial version
    #   Craig Citro: add options for not loading profile
    cd "$CUR"
    shift
    echo ""
    echo "Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set."
    echo "Be sure to exit when you are done and do not do anything"
    echo "with other copies of Sage!"
    echo ""
    SHELL_NAME=`basename $SHELL`
    echo "Bypassing shell configuration files ..."
    echo

    ...

    $SHELL_NAME $SHELL_OPTS "$@"

    status=$?
    echo "Exited Sage subshell."
    exit $status
fi
```

So I'd propose to change `sage` to not print *any* messages if there are any further arguments to `sage --sh`.

Alternatively, all (or a reduced set of) messages should at least go to `stderr` instead of `stdout`, perhaps regardless of whether `-c` was specified or not.

In addition, if we dropped the "`Exited Sage subshell.`" (at least in the case of `-c`), we could (or should) also use

```sh
    exec $SHELL_NAME $SHELL_OPTS "$@"
```

(Actually, `exec` should be used in a couple of Sage commands which don't need any "post-processing", e.g. by `sage`.)

Looks ok, but I cannot tell (or test right now) whether all prompts, and shell options regarding not executing rc files are correct.

The code testing for `-c` could be moved up, since everything else (in the `case ... esac`) is useless in this case .

Also, if `exec` returns, this means an error, so we could print some according message in this case (although *hopefully*<sup>TM</sup> the shell itself did).

On my Mac, I was able to run "chsh" and then open up new terminal windows and run "sage -sh" to test the prompts.

Well, if you're running "sage --sh CMD", it should matter whether you're running "bash" or "bash --norc", right?  The `case ... esac` stuff sets shell options like `--norc` in addition to the prompt, and I think we want this.

Any shell called with `-c` **must not** execute any rc files.

:)

I rather meant something like

```sh
    ...
    SHELL_NAME=`basename $SHELL`

    if [ "$1" = "-c" ]; then
        exec "$SHELL_NAME" "$@"
        # If 'exec' returns, an error occurred:
        status=$?
        echo >&2 "Fatal error: 'exec \"$SHELL_NAME\" \"$@\"' failed!"
        exit $status # Always non-zero, but return the code the shell gave.
    fi

    case $SHELL_NAME in
    ...
```




Btw., any reason to call `$SHELL_NAME` instead of `$SHELL`?

The latter would IMHO be correct.

Second, please get rid of the double-line prompt.  I find that so confusing.  No need to print `SAGE_ROOT` on every prompt (maybe print it once in the "informative" messages).

Well, other options could be passed such that the shell would still be interactive.

In that case, the "informative messages" should probably still get printed.

I wouldn't mind shortening the prompt to one line, but I'd like to get more feedback, so I asked the question on sage-devel.

If it is shortened, should we do more to highlight that we're in a subshell?  The following shortens "(sage subshell)" to "(Sage)" and puts in reverse video.  We could use boldface if reverse video is too obnoxious.

On the other hand, other options (e.g. the name of a script) could be passed such that the shell would *not* be interactive.  I would say that any option passed qualifies as "advanced usage" meaning the user knows what he is doing and does not need "informative" messages.

If someone needs such, we could support `SAGE_SHELL_PROMPT` or whatever.

Here is version 3 of the patch.  This implements Leif's idea about ./sage/.sagerc, in a simple-minded way.  It also checks for the environment variable `SAGE_SHPROMPT`.

My opinion is that the prompt for the Sage shell should indicate **very clearly** that this is a Sage shell, so the default in this patch is for it to start with "(sage-sh)" in reverse video.  If you don't like it, you can override it by setting `PS1` in .sagerc or by setting `SAGE_SHPROMPT` anywhere.

This also doesn't print any warning message or even set the prompt if `sage -sh` is followed by more arguments.  I'm not sure I'm happy about that, in particular the potential lack of a different prompt.

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A32):
> Regarding the use of "exec", which was suggested by Leif, was in my version of the patch, and is in the current patch: if we want to be able to do something like `sage --norc -c ...` (as in #11932), then we want to be able to delete the temporary `DOTSAGE` directory after the Sage command finishes.  Using "exec" prevents this, doesn't it?

Using `exec` **here** doesn't prevent that.  It just means that we cannot implement `--norc` itself using `exec`, which is fine.

Example:
scriptA does

```
scriptB
cleanup
```

scriptB does

```
exec scriptC
cleanup2
```

The `exec` in `scriptB` doesn't prevent the `cleanup` in `scriptA`, it only prevents the `cleanup2` in `scriptB`.

Right, but suppose we do something like this:

```
if [ "$1" = '--norc' -o "$1" = '--nodotsage' ]; then
    export DOT_SAGE=`mktemp -d ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/dotsageXXXXXX`
    shift
    sage "$@"
    status=$?
    rm -rf "$DOT_SAGE"
    exit $status
fi
```
Then if you do `sage --norc --sh ...` (or any other option like `--sh` which uses `exec`), it will never reach the line `rm -rf "$DOT_SAGE"`.

That would be very surprising, are you sure about this?
