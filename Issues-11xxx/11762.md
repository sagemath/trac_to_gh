Importing all from `__init__.py` simplifies and stabilizes the import order. Unfortunately the current state of imports depends on packages being partially loaded at different points in time, but this patch changes things where it can without breaking sage.

Cool, could you explain (maybe with a small example if that is not a crazy amount of work) what the precise difference is this makes for importing. I might be ably to figure it out on myself, but since you probably already know it , I don't want to waste my time on thinking to much about the subtle differences between our recursive all.py structure, and just doing  
import all from init.py?

Or is there really not much of a difference and is this just a first step to better use of init.py?

Sorry I didn't see your comment earlier. 

Basically, when you do `import a.b.c` it first loads `a/__init__.py`, then `a/b/__init__.py`, and finally `a/b/c.py` (or `a/b/c/__init__.py`). 

Importing `all` imposes no restraint, so one can `import sage.rings.foo.fragile_module` without loading `sage.ring.all`. If `fragile_module` depends on `stable_module` being loaded first, then `sage.rings.all` can enforce this order, but only if `sage.rings.all` is loaded before `import sage.rings.foo.fragile_module`. Even when things aren't fragile, this ensures that the submodules of sage.rings get loaded in the order specified in all.py, greatly reducing the chance that a change in imports in an unrelated portion of code can trigger a chain reaction, import things in a different order, and have result in circular import errors. This will also help with performance, as one can see the actual load time of sage.rings.all without wondering about how many submodules were "preloaded." So it's both a cleanup and a prelude to further cleanup.

Also, for things like "sage.plot.plot" it could be confusing since if you just did "sage.plot.plot" it would be referring to the function (currently, "sage.plot.all.plot").  However, to import that function directly, it'd be "from sage.plot.plot import plot" which would also be the same as "from sage.plot import plot".
