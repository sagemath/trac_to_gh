When trying to contour_plot a function that can return non-real numbers, such as 

```
sage: contour_plot(log(x) + log(y), (-1000, 1000), (-1000, 1000))
```

the following error is returned:

```
TypeError: can't convert complex to float
```

Sage should print a warning and skip over the those points. This is the way R behaves.

Sure! I do know how to do this, but Mercurial queues are so aggravating that I'm going to have to put it off until I have time to re-learn them.

I did try several different functions. Attached is the example given in the description.

I'd say no, because those are very clearly labeled as "real part" and so forth, which we don't do.  As long as we aren't doing something *wrong*, I think that the picture you have and similar behavior is ok; it's understood that one doesn't plot complex values.
