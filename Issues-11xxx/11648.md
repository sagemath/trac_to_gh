When trying to contour_plot a function that can return non-real numbers, such as 

```
sage: contour_plot(log(x) + log(y), (-1000, 1000), (-1000, 1000))
```

the following error is returned:

```
TypeError: can't convert complex to float
```

Sage should print a warning and skip over the those points. This is the way R behaves.

I would rephrase:

```
-    Domain points in :trac:`11648` with complex output are now skipped::
+    Domain points where the function takes complex values are skipped
+    (:trac:`11648`)::
```
Please set to positive review on my behalf,
with or without this rephrasing.

Thanks. Your wording is more precise, but I really don't want to waste a few hours rebuilding sage if I re-checkout this branch to make the change. (Release manager, or anyone else, feel free.)
