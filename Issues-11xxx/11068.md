It was suggested that my patch for #7797 be split into several parts.

The first part shall be about ideals in non-commutative rings. Aim, for example:

```
sage: A = SteenrodAlgebra(2)
sage: A*[A.0,A.1^2]
Left Ideal (Sq(1), Sq(1,1)) of mod 2 Steenrod algebra
sage: [A.0,A.1^2]*A
Right Ideal (Sq(1), Sq(1,1)) of mod 2 Steenrod algebra
sage: A*[A.0,A.1^2]*A
Twosided Ideal (Sq(1), Sq(1,1)) of mod 2 Steenrod algebra
```

It was suggested to also add quotients by twosided ideals, although it will be difficult to provide examples before having letterplace ideals.

Apply:

* [attachment:trac11068_quotient_ring_without_names.patch]

Depends on #10961

The patch is incomplete, since proper examples are missing. Proper examples will be provided by #7797, but Nicolas promised to try and find some "small" example.

Really, all what we need is a non-commutative ring and something that inherits from `Ideal_nc` and provides a `reduce()` method yielding normal forms.

Also, that patch is preliminary, since it copies some code from sage/rings/ring.pyx to sage/categories/rings.py, rather than *moving* it.

Concerning examples.

I suggest to make a standard example out of the following emulation of a certain very simple ideals of a free algebra, *without* letterplace:

```
sage: from sage.rings.noncommutative_ideals import Ideal_nc
# mainly we need a 'reduce()' method. So, provide one!
sage: class PowerIdeal(Ideal_nc):
....:     def __init__(self, R, n):
....:         self._power = n
....:         Ideal_nc.__init__(self,R,[x^n for x in R.gens()])
....:     def reduce(self,x):
....:         R = self.ring()
....:         return add([c*R(m) for c,m in x if len(m)<self._power],R(0))
....:
sage: F.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, 3)
sage: I3 = PowerIdeal(F,3); I3
Twosided Ideal (x^3, y^3, z^3) of Free Algebra on 3 generators (x, y, z) over Rational Field
# We need to use super in order to access the generic quotient:
sage: Q3.<a,b,c> = super(F.__class__,F).quotient(I3)
sage: Q3
Quotient of Free Algebra on 3 generators (x, y, z) over Rational Field by the ideal (x^3, y^3, z^3)
sage: (a+b+2)^4
16 + 32*x + 32*y + 24*x^2 + 24*x*y + 24*y*x + 24*y^2
sage: Q3.is_commutative()
False
sage: I2 = PowerIdeal(F,2); I2
Twosided Ideal (x^2, y^2, z^2) of Free Algebra on 3 generators (x, y, z) over Rational Field
sage: Q2.<a,b,c> = super(F.__class__,F).quotient(I2)
sage: Q2.is_commutative()
True
sage: (a+b+2)^4
16 + 32*x + 32*y
```

I think I would be able to add this example as doc test tomorrow, also removing the whole ideal and quotient stuff from `sage.rings.ring.Ring` to `sage.categories.rings.Rings.ParentMethods`.

Apparently it took a lot longer. The problem is "moving the whole ideal and quotient stuff from `sage.rings.ring.Ring` to `sage.categories.rings.Rings.ParentMethods`. Namely, that involves a couple of methods with cached output (the cache being hand-written).

I think it should be part of this ticket to properly use categories and the new coercion model for

* quotient rings
* (free) monoids
* free algebras

That has not been done in #9138, but I think it fits here as well, since "quotients" is mentioned in the ticket title, and free algebras could provide nice examples, if they would use the category framework.

That's precisely the issue that stopped me starting the refactoring of
quotient, because there was a design discussion to be run first on
sage-devel to see which syntax should be prefered:

- that currently used in the category framework for sub quotients:

    P.lift     either a plain Python method, or better the lift
               function as a morphism
    P.lift(x)  lifts x to the ambient space of P

- or that used in sage.rings.quotient_rings:

    P.lift()(x) lifts x to the ambient space of P
    P.lift()    the lifting morphism

I personally prefer the former, first from a syntactical point of
view, and because it make it easy in practice to implement lift.

Note: at first sight, it seems easy to make the change in this
direction while retaining backward compatibility by just patching
sage.ring.quotient_rings so that P.lift(x) delegates the work to
P.lift()(x).

Do you mind running this dicussion on sage-devel?

Cheers,
			Nicolas

The term \"lifting morphism\" is used in the documentation as well. So, explicit being better than implicit, \"P.lift()\" as it is used in sage.rings.quotient_rings, should be renamed as \"P.lifting_morphism()\".\n\nSo, I tend towards using the notions from the subquotient framework.\n\n> Do you mind running this dicussion on sage-devel?\n\n\nNot at all.

I think the object oriented mantra implies that the correct syntax for lifting an element x of P to the ambient space of P is `x.lift()` (which is implemented). And I am not a fan of providing stuff by attributes (so, I wouldn't like `P.lift` being a morphism).

On the other hand, `P.lift(x)` could be understood as "P, please lift x!".

Moreover:

>      P.lift()    the lifting morphism


As you state, it is the "lifting morphism", not the "lift". The term "lifting morphism" is used in the documentation as well. So, explicit being better than implicit, "P.lift()" as it is used in sage.rings.quotient_rings, should be renamed as "P.lifting_morphism()".

So, I tend towards using the notions from the subquotient framework.

Not at all. I just hope that people will answer.

I just found one problem that should be fixed.

In unpatched Sage, we have

```
sage: R = Integers(8)
sage: R.quotient(R.ideal(2),['bla'])
Quotient of Integer Ring by the ideal (2)
```

Shouldn't the result rather be the same as `Integers(2)`?

With my patch as it currently is, the example fails with a type error. But I think I can make it work, so that the result will be "Ring of integers modulo 2".

Hi John,

Replying to [john_perry](#comment%3A22):
>   1. Now that I think of it, does the request to distinguish left, right, & two-sided ideals makes sense in `_ideal_class()`? This is a method for a ring, not an ideal.


Yes, _ideal_class is a method of the ring, not of the ideal. However, the returned class already depends (in some cases) on the number of generators (principal ideals versus general ideals). Theoretically, it could allso be made dependent on the sidedness of the ideal-to-be-constructed.

However, I think it is better to have a common class for ideals in non-commutative rings. Instances of that class can be left, right or twosided. But (I think) it is not necessary to have one separate class for onesided and another separate class for twosided ideals.

It is not so easy, because the Steenrod algebra has infinitely many generators (the number of generators is given by ngens). The Steenrod algebra can not provide a list of generator names either: The method variable_names() will not work, of course.

But when you want to construct a general ring quotient, the init method of the quotient ring expects that the ring you started with *knows* its variable names.

It may be possible to change the init method of quotient rings such that it will no longer be expected. But I think that should be on a different ticket.

Hint: You could start with a matrix algebra (say, 2x2 matrices over some field). Here, we have a finite list of generators (namely four matrices). And then, you could assign names to them when constructing the quotient, such as here

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(5),2,2)
sage: I = MS*[MS.0*MS.1,MS.2+MS.3]*MS
sage: MS.ngens()

sage: I
Twosided Ideal

  [0 1]
  [0 0],

  [0 0]
  [1 1]
)

sage: Q.<a,b,c,d> = MS.quo(I)
sage: Q
Quotient of Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Finite Field of size 5 by the ideal
(
  [0 1]
  [0 0],

  [0 0]
  [1 1]

It turns out that, although the variable names are available, Q does not know its generators. And that's clearly strange: MS knows its generators, and hence the quotient Q could simply be generated by the equivalence classes of the generators of MS:

```
sage: MS.gens()
(
[1 0]  [0 1]  [0 0]  [0 0]
[0 0], [0 0], [1 0], [0 1]
)
sage: Q.variable_names()
('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
sage: Q.ngens()
4
sage: Q.gens()
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (359, 0))

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: variable names have not yet been set using self._assign_names(...)
```

Actually, it seems that the problem simply is *printing* the elements:

```
sage: L = Q.gens()
sage: L[0]
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (359, 0))

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: variable names have not yet been set using self._assign_names(...)
```

Indeed, it seems that the printing method of quotient ring elements expects that the cover ring uses variable names in order to print its elemennts; the variable names of the quotient rings are used to replace the variable names of the cover ring.

However, the elements of MS are not printed using any variable names.

I think that's a bug that could be fixed here (I wouldn't open a new ticket for it).

Thank you for spotting it!

**Please apply the new patch from #11342 before installing the new patch from here!**

I resolved the problem with printing quotient ring elements of matrix spaces, and while I was at it, I also enabled the creation of quotients of the Steenrod algebras.

How's that?

__String representation__

The string representation of a quotient ring element is obtained from its representation in the cover ring. However, the variable names in the cover ring and the quotient ring may be different. That is taken care of by a local environment that temporarily changes the variable names in the cover ring.

However, that won't work if the cover ring has no variable names: If there are no names, they can't be changed. And similarly, if the quotient ring has no names then one wouldn't know how to change the names from the cover ring.

With the new patch, one can do:

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(5),2,2)
sage: I = MS*[MS.0*MS.1,MS.2+MS.3]*MS
sage: Q = MS.quo(I)
sage: Q.an_element()
[1 0]
[0 0]
```

__Cover rings with infinitely many generators__

With the patch, we don't require the list of generators of the cover ring at initialisation time of the quotient ring. Hence, we can form quotient rings of Steenrod algebras. Here is a case where one has no variable names. Thus, the string representation of a quotient ring element must coincide with the string representation of a corresponding element in the cover ring.

That's to say:

```
sage: S = SteenrodAlgebra(2)
sage: I = S*[S.0+S.1]*S
sage: Q = S.quo(I)
sage: Q.an_element()
Sq(1)
```

Note, however, that in order to be able to do *real* computations in the quotient ring, someone needs to implement a method `reduce()` for the involved ideal class!

__Coping with #11342 in conjunction with #9138__

#11342 is a dependency for #11115, which is a dependency for this ticket.

Since today, there is a new patch at #11342, that fixes a problem with the Pari interface: On some machines, that problem would result in a segfault.

The new patches at #11342 add a doctest, that needs to be modified if #11342 is combined with #9138 (reason: Some element class introduce at #11342 gets a different name when #9138 adds the category framework).

Since both are dependencies for the ticket here, the new patch fixes the test.

Needs review, again...

Since `QI = QA.ideal([i])` works, I'd prefer to keep it as is, and would consider `QA*i*QA` as syntactical sugar that might be added on a different ticket.

Could you please state precisely what you did?

When I start sage with the patches applied, I get

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(5),2)
sage: MS.0+MS.1

[0 0]
sage: MS.0*MS.1

What is Q?

It obviously does. We have

Sorry, I meant `x=MS.0` there.

Now I understand the problem.

Addition in Q works, but multiplication in Q doesn't. That is because the current multiplication of quotient ring elements relies on a generic implementation. Multiplication of `Q.0` with `Q.1` is essentially the same as

```
sage: Q(Q.lift(Q.0)*Q.lift(Q.1))
```

The problem is: `Q.lift(Q.0)` tries to call `Q.lifting_map()`, which should return the lift map - but fails. I guess the failure comes from a cdef attribute that can only take an instance of type `Ring`; so, one couldn't assign `MS` to it.

However, multiplication of `Q.0` with `Q.1` could also be done as follows:

```
sage: Q(Q.0.lift()*Q.1.lift())
[0 1]
[0 0]
```
The difference is that `Q.lift(Q.0)` is a generic method of quotient rings, whereas Q.0.lift() is a generic method of quotient ring elements.

Obvious solution: If `Q.lifting_map()` can not construct the lifting map via `sage.rings.morphism.RingMap_lift`, then it should try `sage.categories.morphism.SetMorphism`.

Thanks for spotting it! I hope I can soon provide a new patch!

I submitted a third patch, and I think it works now!

We have the new doctest

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(5),2,2)
            sage: I = MS*[MS.0*MS.1,MS.2+MS.3]*MS
            sage: Q = MS.quo(I)
            sage: Q.lift()
Set-theoretic ring morphism:
  From: Quotient of Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Finite Field of size 5 by the ideal
(
  [0 1]
  [0 0],

  [0 0]
  [1 1]
)
  To:   Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Finite Field of size 5
  Defn: Choice of lifting map
```

The tests in sage/rings/ pass (didn't run the other tests yet). Ready for review again!

I remember that I had the same problem with one of the alpha versions.

By the way: Four days ago, I had updated the patch at #9138. Do you use the new version? With the old version, one would get an error on sage.math.

Can you test at what point in the patch chain the test starts to fail, and report appropriately? That's to say, if it fails with  unpatched sage-4.7.2.alpha2 then report to sage-release; if it fails with #11115 or #11342 only, then report there.

There has been a short discussion on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/3635c832b051f9c6). The aim was to make quotient rings unique parents, which also means that a better framework should be provided for testing equality of ideals.

First, I thought it would be best to do it on top of #9138 and add it as a new dependency for this ticket.

On the other hand, #11342 already has a positive review, and I hope that #9138 will soon be off my plate as well. Hence, the only dependency left for this ticket is #11115. Probably it will be better to do the new stuff on top of this ticket.

The trouble with #11339 has been resolved: #11339 can in fact only be used in conjunction with #10903. The patches here can remain as they are now. #10903 should be added as a new dependency (#11339 is a dependency of #10903).

All doc tests succeeded with sage-4.7.2.alpha3 plus #11339, #10903, #11856, #11115 and #11068. So, I hope that it is alright that I now reinstate the positive review.

I gave the positive review, and I am fine with that. I can run the doctests on my own machine if someone likes, but since I'm working on something else, I'm unable to do it at the moment.

Out of curiosity, why was the milestone changed to 4.7.3?

There is an "inofficial" sage-4.7.3.alpha1, which actually contains #11068. So, you may test with this, if you like. If all tests pass with sage-4.7.3.alpha1, then (I think) it is justified to keep your original positive review.

The reduce function of the two doctests

All failures will probably be fixed if these three tests pass

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(5),2,2)
sage: I = MS*[MS.0*MS.1,MS.2+MS.3]*MS
sage: Q = MS.quo(I)
sage: Q.0*Q.1   # indirect doctest
[0 1]
[0 0]
```
 and

```
sage: S = SteenrodAlgebra(2)
sage: I = S*[S.0+S.1]*S
sage: Q = S.quo(I)
sage: Q.0
Sq(1)
```
Added by this ticket both do not satisfy the condition on `reduce` as documented in this ticket

```
In :trac:`11068`, non-commutative quotient rings `R/I` were
implemented.  The only requirement is that the two-sided ideal `I`
provides a ``reduce`` method so that ``I.reduce(x)`` is the normal
form of an element `x` with respect to `I` (i.e., we have
``I.reduce(x) == I.reduce(y)`` if `x-y \in I`, and
``x - I.reduce(x) in I``).
```
This issue is now tracked at #23621
