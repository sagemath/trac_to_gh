Let R be a ring with fraction field K.

```
When you create a R-submodule of K^n (with K!=QQ) the vectors 
are created in the ring R not the fraction field.  This breaks things 
when the submodule is not in R^n.
```

Fixed by #11751.

The new version adds a doctest (and is slightly modified to make the doctest work).

The only doctest failure I received was related to the startup time as checked by startup.py. Curiously enough, replicating the same test on my local machine returned True. (Replicating as in: not running the doctest itself as it always returns True when not on sage.math.)
