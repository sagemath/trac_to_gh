Sage will not build with gcc 4.6.0 due to a number of issues. These need to be resolved asap, as Fedora 15 will ship with gcc 4.6.0. 

At least some of the problems that prevent Sage building with gcc 4.6.0 are:

* #10892 (lcalc)
* #11083 (PolyBoRi)
* #11084 (Singular)
* #11168 and #11437 (Rubiks)
* #11226 (sympow)
* #11227 (Cliquer)

There may be others on specific platforms. 

When all these issues are resolved, the "Install from Source Code" section of the Sage Installation Guide needs to be updated to remove the notes about Sage not building with gcc 4.6.0. Also the Wiki at http://wiki.sagemath.org/SupportedPlatforms needs to be updated, as that now mentions that Sage will not build with gcc 4.6.0.

The lcalc, Singular and PolyBoRi issues have all been reported upstream.

I agree with you.  However, we have to undo some changes from #11159.  I propose to do that on this ticket.

sage: An error occurred while installing pycrypto-2.1.0
Please email sage-devel http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel
explaining the problem and send the relevant part of
of /opt/sage-build/sage-4.7.1.alpha4/install.log.  Describe your computer, operating system, etc.
If you want to try to fix the problem yourself, *don't* just cd to
/opt/sage-build/sage-4.7.1.alpha4/spkg/build/pycrypto-2.1.0 and type 'make check' or whatever is appropriate.
Instead, the following commands setup all environment variables
correctly and load a subshell for you to debug the error:
(cd '/opt/sage-build/sage-4.7.1.alpha4/spkg/build/pycrypto-2.1.0' && '/opt/sage-build/sage-4.7.1.alpha4/sage' -sh)
When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the
subshell.

I had the same issue when building sage-4.7.0 with gcc-4.6.0.

Apparently it is only the 32-bit version of sage that fails to build with gcc-4.6 as noted in the ticket referenced above (#11391).
