Sage will not build with gcc 4.6.0 due to a number of issues. These need to be resolved asap, as Fedora 15 will ship with gcc 4.6.0. 

At least some of the problems that prevent Sage building with gcc 4.6.0 are:

* #10892 (lcalc)
* #11083 (PolyBoRi)
* #11084 (Singular)
* #11168 and #11437 (Rubiks)
* #11226 (sympow)
* #11227 (Cliquer)

There may be others on specific platforms. 

When all these issues are resolved, the "Install from Source Code" section of the Sage Installation Guide needs to be updated to remove the notes about Sage not building with gcc 4.6.0. Also the Wiki at http://wiki.sagemath.org/SupportedPlatforms needs to be updated, as that now mentions that Sage will not build with gcc 4.6.0.

The lcalc, Singular and PolyBoRi issues have all been reported upstream.

I agree with you.  However, we have to undo some changes from #11159.  I propose to do that on this ticket.

I had the same issue when building sage-4.7.0 with gcc-4.6.0.
