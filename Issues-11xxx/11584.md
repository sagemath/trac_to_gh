This patch implements the ``DegreeSequence`` class which lets the user check whether a given integer sequence is indeed a degree sequence, and more importantly build the list of all degree sequences of length n.

I originally wrote this code because I attempted to test a conjecture on "all graphs up to isomorphism", to notice later that there actually was a *large* number of them. There actually was a nice upper bound on what I wanted to measure which only depended on the degree sequence, and here I am.

While it is already hard to enumerate all the graphs on 10 elements, with this code I was able to enumerate the degree sequences on up to 23 vertices (it has been running on the case 24 for two days now) `:-D`

I also spent a scary amount of time on the documentation, so as to explain how everything works. Let's make Sage's reference manual a math book `:-D`

Interesting.  A long time ago I was hoping one could have Sage create more than one graph from a given degree sequence.  Currently we just have H-H in one way:

```

    def DegreeSequence(self, deg_sequence):
        """
        Returns a graph with the given degree sequence. Raises a NetworkX
        error if the proposed degree sequence cannot be that of a graph.
        
        Graph returned is the one returned by the Havel-Hakimi algorithm,
        which constructs a simple graph by connecting vertices of highest
        degree to other vertices of highest degree, resorting the remaining
        vertices by degree and repeating the process. See Theorem 1.4 in
        [1].
```

```
        import networkx
        return graph.Graph(networkx.havel_hakimi_graph([int(i) for i in deg_sequence])
```
It would be great to be able to return all graphs created by this, at least it seems that way to me...

Hi Nathann,

I tried the patch on sage-5.0.beta8.

* Installation OK
* functionality OK (I can play with degree sequences and generate graphs,...)
* long tests (sage -t --verbose --long -force_lib sage/combinat/degree_sequences.pyx) OK
* docbuild OK

However, I have some minor comments:

* In the html doc, one `min` should be replaced with a `\min`


```
63	.. MATH:: 
64	    \sum_{j\leq i}d_j \leq j(j-1) + \sum_{j>i}min(d_j,i) 
65	 
```

* The inline doc is rather limited and doesn't look nice.


```
sage: DegreeSequences?

As soon as these minor comments are addressed, I think the patch will be ready to go.

Best,

D.

The patch is OK (docbuild, install, long tests,...) and the message is much better now.

Please change `For moe information` with `For more information`, and then the patch will be perfect ;-)
