This patch implements the ``DegreeSequence`` class which lets the user check whether a given integer sequence is indeed a degree sequence, and more importantly build the list of all degree sequences of length n.

I originally wrote this code because I attempted to test a conjecture on "all graphs up to isomorphism", to notice later that there actually was a *large* number of them. There actually was a nice upper bound on what I wanted to measure which only depended on the degree sequence, and here I am.

While it is already hard to enumerate all the graphs on 10 elements, with this code I was able to enumerate the degree sequences on up to 23 vertices (it has been running on the case 24 for two days now) `:-D`

I also spent a scary amount of time on the documentation, so as to explain how everything works. Let's make Sage's reference manual a math book `:-D`

        Graph returned is the one returned by the Havel-Hakimi algorithm,
        which constructs a simple graph by connecting vertices of highest
        degree to other vertices of highest degree, resorting the remaining
        vertices by degree and repeating the process. See Theorem 1.4 in

It would be great to be able to return all graphs created by this, at least it seems that way to me...

Hi Nathann,

I tried the patch on sage-5.0.beta8.

* Installation OK
* functionality OK (I can play with degree sequences and generate graphs,...)
* long tests (sage -t --verbose --long -force_lib sage/combinat/degree_sequences.pyx) OK
* docbuild OK

However, I have some minor comments:

* In the html doc, one `min` should be replaced with a `\min`


```
63	.. MATH:: 
64	    \sum_{j\leq i}d_j \leq j(j-1) + \sum_{j>i}min(d_j,i) 
65	 
```

* The inline doc is rather limited and doesn't look nice.


```
sage: DegreeSequences?
Type:           classobj

As soon as these minor comments are addressed, I think the patch will be ready to go.

Best,

D.
