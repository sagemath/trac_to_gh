```
In a multi-user environment, the user compiling Sage must run it at least once to run `sage-location` and generate `.pyc` files.

The proposed fix is: in the default `make` rule, run Sage when `local/bin/sage-started.txt` does not exist and create that file in `sage-location`.  Also run Sage after upgrading.

This patch also changes the error message when a spkg fails a build or test.  Example error message:

```

Good idea.  Make a temporary DOTSAGE, run Sage, remove the temporary DOTSAGE

Someone who is going to install Sage system-wide should run `make ptestlong` or similiar anyway (which also runs `sage`), just like one runs `make check` before running `make install`.

Also note that `sage` (or `sage-location`) should be run (at least) **after** it has been moved to its final installation location, which is likely to happen *after* having built Sage.

I think it does.  Currently, after `make build` (or simply `make`), Sage **does not work** for a different user.  I think `make build` should result in a proper Sage installation, which means that it should work for **every user**.

> it shouldn't be run from `spkg/install` but the `Makefile`

Why?  I like `spkg/install` better because it allows us to run Sage only if something was actually installed.  You don't want to run Sage everytime somebody does `make foo` for various values of "foo".  Also, IIRC, we run `spkg/install` on upgrading but not a top-level `make all` or `make build`.

> Or run `sage-location` from there if `make` did anything, but we should in principle run it from elsewhere.

Running `sage-location` is certainly not sufficient to generate all files needed to run Sage.

> Someone who is going to install Sage system-wide should run `make ptestlong`

Let the sysadmin decide whether they want to run `make ptestlong` or not, I want to give him the option of NOT doing it.

> Also note that `sage` (or `sage-location`) should be run (at least) **after** it has been moved to its final installation location, which is likely to happen *after* having built Sage.

I would think most people run Sage from the location where they installed it, or equivalently, install Sage in the location they want to run it from.  In any case, this does not invalidate the reasons for this ticket.

I'm somewhat tempted to add a new command-line option to Sage:

We should probably check exit codes for various things here, and of course this would need to be documented.  If we had this, then in `Makefile`, we could replace "sage --docbuild ..." with "sage --norc --docbuild ...".  We could possibly do the same with "make test", etc.

Let's discuss this in a different ticket: #11932.

I think I am going to revert the `DOT_SAGE` handling here and leave that for #11932, because currently it's very hard to avoid having a `$HOME/.sage` directory created when installing Sage.

s/succesfully/successfully/

Still, running `sage` (especially the full bunch of shell scripts) there is quite dangerous, as almost everything can happen.  Worse, there's no *"DO NOT INTERRUPT THIS"**, and error messages aren't even logged.

Better write some `install` target (and / or a `sage-first_time` script), and update the Sage Installation Guide, especially with respect to files that are created upon first start-up, hardcoded path etc. etc.

IMHO we should in general do certain things *upon installing Sage* (some actually *during* the build), rather than checking them and doing them *for the first time* when someone tries to start Sage.

* This message is btw. printed too late, as `install_moved()` already does some stuff before the script (eventually!) gets to this.

I don't see any problem, except that the current behaviour of Sage regarding on-the-fly creation or modification of files in the "static" installation tree is suboptimal and -- IMHO worse -- AFAIK not documented, at least not very well.

And the "problem" is all but new.

Sysadmins -- at least those that have installed Sage before (others will quickly notice) -- are likely to be aware of that; most other users don't care at all, so this is rather a non-issue.

Adding running `sage` at the end of every (perhaps partial re-) build is not the right way to solve this; in contrast, it is likely to obscure errors that don't show up during the build but when you try to start Sage, in addition with the potential to make the build hang (without any output).

So the minimal things to do are -- if you really want to run Sage *there*:

* Print a message that we're attempting to run `sage`.
* Disable keyboard interrupts during important operations (`sage-location`, maybe elsewhere, too), and issue a warning that this process must not be interrupted, at least for a few minutes.
* Perhaps set a reasonably long timeout for running `sage`.
* Log the output instead of redirecting it to `/dev/null`, such that we can print at least a reference to the error log in case of failures.




> I suggest we merge this now (once the typos are fixed, along with any other simple fixes), and consider a longer term solution separately.


There are various possible long-term solutions; the primary goal should be to *document* potential issues, i.e., at least prominently state that Sage should be run at least once at its final location for use in a multi-user environment, or more precisely, for a system-wide installation.




> I wouldn't object if this were implemented by adding a new target in the Makefile, but I think it should be run by default to address the issues Jeroen has raised here.


An `echo` statement at the end of the build, perhaps in the `Makefile`, would IMHO fully suffice for the moment; no need to hurry or for "quick [and dirty] fixes" (which btw. often cause more trouble than they solve).

Have there been any "error" reports regarding this?  Changing the permissions of *all* files in a couple of spkgs wasn't necessary either.

Note that "ordinary" users won't be able to install / upgrade spkgs anyway, so the `pkg-config` and `.la` files for example aren't an issue in a system-wide installation, nor will such users be able to move Sage, unless they copy the whole installation (in which case they're likely to gain ownership, or at least can change the owner, such that they'll have write permission on the copied installation).

In principle you are of course right but Sage is quite different from other software.  It currently has no `make install` rule, and it is not at all clear to me what `make install` should do anyway.  Also, Sage is special in that the source code is really in the installation.  Normally, you would have a source tree and a build tree, but with Sage this is one.

See #5155.

Leif: would you agree with the following: add a `make install` rule in Sage which simply runs Sage (and hence indirectly `sage-location`)?  And then not run Sage from `spkg/install`.

So the danger is there anyway.\n\n:D I didn't know that.  I only build Sage, but have never run it.\n\nSeriously, the difference is whether a user *intentionally* runs `sage` (for the first time after a build / upgrade / extraction of a binary distribution), and *sees* what's happening.

:D I didn't know that.  I only build Sage, but have never run it.

Seriously, the difference is whether a user *intentionally* runs `sage` (for the first time after a build / upgrade / extraction of a binary distribution), and *sees* what's happening.  Your new patch omits the redirection to `/dev/null`, but I think it would be better to log the output to something like <code>$SAGE_ROOT/first_sage_startup-\`date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M"\`.log</code>, which we *could* delete afterwards if apparently nothing went wrong, otherwise point the user to this file, e.g. for bug reports (also to sage-release btw.).

We have enough "error reports" where people claim something didn't work but couldn't provide error logs.




I'd also prefer running Sage from the `Makefile`; rather than changing the `build` target, we could modify the *default target* to run `sage` once after a successful build (or after building the documentation, but that's likely to fail in "weird" ways if `sage` itself doesn't work properly), perhaps just if no (recent) "first run" logfile exists.

There we should IMHO separate what's currently implicitly performed by `sage-location`, for example by adding an option to `sage-sage` for running just that.  For upgrades, running `sage-location` *afterwards* is not strictly necessary; although some parts should be run by `sage-spkg` anyway, such that they also get run upon e.g. `sage -i ...`.  If `SAGE_UPGRADING=yes`, we could add a message to `spkg/install` (or `sage-sage`, or `sage-update`) recommending to try to run `sage` *right now* (provided the build succeeded).  `make upgrade` (and `make rebuild`) are overdue anyway; if/when we drop the creation of `pipestatus`, we could also change `sage-update` to just *download* new files and then run `make rebuild`, i.e., make it use the top-level `Makefile` as well (which is now under revision control and hence subject to upgrades, too).

Either that, or there needs to be a different test in the Makefile to decide whether to run sage-starts.

How about having a *third* file besides the existing `sage-flags.txt` and `sage-current-location.txt`?  Say, a file `sage-started.txt` whose existence means Sage was run at least once successfully.

I think we could also use the non-existence of this file as a trigger in `sage-location` to force some actions.  For example, on upgrading, even if the Sage tree was not moved, it might make sense to call `update_library_files()` and `update_pkgconfig_files()`.

I would write the file `sage-started.txt` in `sage-location` and potentially delete it in `sage-starts` (that's what you proposed for `sage-flags.txt` instead).

Installation in a Multiuser Environment
---------------------------------------

This section addresses the question of how a system administrator
can install a single copy of Sage in a multi-user computer
network.

System-wide install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. After you build Sage, you may optionally copy or move the entire
   build tree to ``/usr/local``.

#. There are some initial files that have to be created the first time
   Sage is run. Try starting up Sage once as root (or, to be
   more thorough, try ``make test`` as root to run all the standard test
   code). You can stop the tests by pressing ``ctrl-z`` followed by
   typing ``kill %1`` (assuming you had no other jobs in the
   background of that shell).

The patch to `spkg/install` will conflict with #11959, so should be removed from the patch.  (The changes are irrelevant anyway.)

I don't think it's a good idea to write the "sage started" file from `sage-location`, as running `sage-location` doesn't imply that Sage will or will get run.

Btw., `.pyc` wasn't a typo; while the `.pyc` files don't get "regenerated" by `sage-location`, they get *deleted*, such that they'll indeed get regenerated the next time Sage is run.

(The `.pc` files don't get regenerated either; if at all, they get updated when necessary.)

```make
ifeq ($(MAKECMDGOALS),build)
        RUN_SAGE_REMINDER = echo "Make sure to run Sage once before ..."
endif

...

build: ...
        ...
        $(RUN_SAGE_REMINDER)
```

IMHO this ticket still needs work.

First of all, `doc` should also depend on `start`[sic], to avoid attempting to run both at the same time.

Second, the output of `sage-starts` still isn't logged, which is important for error reports at least.

Nothing wrong with running `doc` and `start`[sic] at the same time.

That's not true.  It is logged in `$SAGE_ROOT/start.log`, see the new `local/bin/sage-starts`.  If `sage-starts` fails, you get an error message pointing to this logfile.

Ok, I see it is in `$SAGE_ROOT/start.log`.  Not immediately clear from the `Makefile`, and having it in `install.log` as well wouldn't be bad either.

From `start.log` alone (which is always appended to), it isn't clear what happened inbetween (i.e., the relevant parts of `install.log`), and conversely, from `install.log` one doesn't necessarily see whether running Sage succeeded.

Yes.

But still `doc` should depend on `start`, such that one immediately gets *a single, meaningful* error message, not intermixed by repeated random tracebacks from Sphinx (after each of which the script btw. still unconditionally prints *"Build succeeded.  The built documents can be found in..."*).

And it would be far better to have the output of `sage-starts` also appended to `install.log`, for the reasons given earlier.




W.r.t. #11021:

Despite its current title, it involves a "major" rewrite of `sage-spkg`, i.e., makes changes all over the code, half of which were -- though already positively reviewed -- removed from another ticket for IMHO no reason (since at that point, they did apply and didn't break any other tickets).

So that ticket certainly drags (which mainly is my fault; I've returned to it many times, but then again had to work on too many other tickets), but it doesn't make things easier if other tickets do redundant changes to `sage-spkg`, thereby just causing tedious rebasing.

One can by the way search for other tickets before working on e.g. scripts or spkgs.  And there's btw. also a meta-ticket for changes to the `Makefile`, #11622.

I don't find it logical that `doc` would depend on `start`.  I still think the best solution would be to have `make build` run `sage-starts`.  So here, we have to agree to disagree.

If we are not allowed to make patches just because some other ticket makes changes to the same code, then we might as well stop Sage development.  Especially if the ticket gets "dragged" as you say.

The builder imports `sage.all`, hence `doc` requires that Sage can start.

Perhaps `sage --docbuild` should check once that it is functional (with `try: import sage.all ...`).

I was talking about *unnecessary*, unrelated changes.  Any developer should at least be aware of other tickets touching the same code.

It's also bad practice to bundle unrelated changes to different files into a single patch, just because they're in the same repo.

OK. I just completed my first ebuild of a sage-4.8 alpha this afternoon. The first I noticed about this is when I ran the doctests as a normal user. I do that straight away as this is the only validation test I have. A truckload of doctests just failed complaining that they couldn't find "sage-started.txt". Actually so many failed that I am almost wondering if there is something wrong with the ones that didn't.

I spent 3 weeks fixing bad fortran code and bad makefiles so I may have had a bit of a temper there but it just made my life difficult.

I am not sure how it helps with #5155 since it adds stuff that actually wants access to SAGE_ROOT.

I'll admit that I skimmed a bit on reading this thread so I won't attribute bad intent but using DOT_SAGE has been raised and apparently shot down as "system wide install" is not a normal install. You don't have to support the kind of stuff I do but it felt like making it more difficult knowingly.

I tried the following:

- build Sage ('make'), version 4.8.alpha2
- move the Sage installation and run 'sage' once, as per the multi-user installation instructions
- chmod a-w -R sage-x.y.z (so I don't have write access anymore)
- sage -tp 18 devel/sage

Almost all tests passed; the only failures were the ones reported at #5515.

```
The following tests failed:

	sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/modular/hecke/submodule.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/modular/abvar/abvar.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/lfunctions/sympow.py # 13 doctests failed
	sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/interfaces/qepcad.py # 3 doctests failed
	sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py # 17 doctests failed
```
So I think the approach on this ticket should work with a multi-user installation, but as I said earlier, I may be misunderstanding the problem.

Which helped clear my mind a little and take on board some comments properly. I, and am pretty sure that Mandriva does too, bypass the normal sage build system in our packages. You may have noticed the word ebuild (gentoo). So I didn't notice that you basically generated a file that was essential to start sage at the very end of the building process and outside of any spkg (that's a very crucial bit if you are packaging sage). I guess now that I have noticed and realized it is supposed to be there I could just add it and adjust the location.

My real mistake was to think it was created each time sage was launched - never mind that there is no process to remove it.
