(The summary actually is not completely accurate - there might be some Python object this works for that I'm not aware of.)

If the filename passed to `save()` contains a dot, `save()` assumes that the user doesn't just want to dump the (pickled) object, but instead wants to call the object's `save()` method. I guess this makes sense in situations like `save(g, 'mygraph.png')`, but the code should fall back to dumping the pickled version (e.g. via `try: ... except AttributeError: ...` - suggested via IRC by leif) if the object has no `save()` method.

leif also suggested checking if the file name extension is known - however I guess that we then should verify this with the object itself (e.g. it wouldn't make sense to save a graphics object to a `.wav` file) and not statically compare with a list of known extensions.


```
sage: save((1,1), 'foo2')
sage: save(Matrix(3,3), 'foo.bar3')
sage: save((1,1), 'foo.bar4')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'save'
```

Here's the culprit:

```python
    # Add '.sobj' if the filename currently has no extension
    if os.path.splitext(filename)[1] == '':
        filename += '.sobj'

    if filename.endswith('.sobj'):
        try:
            obj.save(filename=filename, compress=compress, **kwds)
        except (AttributeError, RuntimeError, TypeError):
            s = cPickle.dumps(obj, protocol=2)
            if compress:
                s = comp.compress(s)
            open(process(filename), 'wb').write(s)
    else:
        # Saving an object to an image file. 
        # XXX This of course fails for plain Python objects:

Finally...

The updated patch now adds another doctest and clarifies the description in the docstring. (I intentionally haven't changed it to enumerate all parameters as we normally do, as I think it is more readable as it is now, and `compress=True` should be self-explanatory. For some reason I don't get the correct default parameters shown when typing `save?` at the Sage prompt though.)

I originally wanted to add 

```python
    import os.path
    from sage.misc.misc import SAGE_TMP
    filename = os.path.join(SAGE_TMP, "foo.bar")
    ...
```
but then saw the other examples, so I guess *a lot of* doctests rely on
* having `SAGE_TMP` already imported (by `sage.all`), and also
* `SAGE_TMP` having a trailing slash (or `os.path.sep`),
the latter being perhaps a bit more dangerous than the former.

So I also just used `SAGE_TMP + "..."`.

At the sage: prompt, I get

```
Definition:       save(obj, filename, compress=None, **kwds=True)
```
Odd, the values are shifted right by one (filename should be None, compress should be True).  I wonder what's causing that.  Other functions in the same file seem to be okay.  I have some old copies of Sage around, and this behavior dates back to at least version 4.3.

As far as `SAGE_TMP` is concerned, you're right, it's sloppy.

I'm happy with the patch, basically as is.  I'm attaching a new version fixing one or two words in the docstring.  I'm marking it as "positive review"; if you don't like my changes, switch it back.

Oh, I did not notice the true keywords.

The most disturbing thing with `SAGE_TMP` is IMHO that it ignores settings of `TMP`, `TMPDIR` and `TEMP`, and -- worse -- does not even use `/tmp/` which is more likely to be on a local (usually auto-cleaned) file system than `$HOME/.sage/`, and I don't expect people to change `DOT_SAGE`  to live on a temporary filesystem. (Ok, one can still create a symbolic link from `~/.sage/temp` to whatever is desired, but who knows? Especially since there's also `~/.sage/tmp/` and of course `$SAGE_ROOT/tmp/`.) We furthermore had `SAGE_TMPDIR` and `SAGE_TESTDIR`, the former meanwhile changed to the latter. I'll perhaps open a `sage-devel` thread on that (to make William happy).

Ok. Regarding extensions, I'd consider `foo.png` having *one*, while `foo.baz` and `foo.bar` (non-exclusively) having *some*. :-)
