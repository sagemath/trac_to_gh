The import of sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_curve_isogeny.py (which happens on every startup of sage) takes a relatively big amount of time

```
$ time ./sage -startuptime|grep ell_curve_isogeny:
          ell_curve_isogeny: 0.133 (ell_field)

real    0m0.994s
user    0m0.810s
sys     0m0.154s
```
Lazily computing the constants in this file helps a lot (see the attached patch):

```
$ time ./sage -startuptime|grep ell_curve_isogeny:
          ell_curve_isogeny: 0.001 (ell_field)

real    0m0.849s
user    0m0.672s
sys     0m0.164s
```

You're right. I turned the comments describing how to compute the precomputed things into docstrings. Unfortunately they don't seem to work anymore. The line

```
sage: Psi5 = sum([X**i * f.coefficient({x:i})(X,t) for i in range(3)]).monic()
```
fails with

```
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular' object has no attribute 'monic'

Can this be fixed easily?

Sorry for the delay.  I'll document this better and make sure that the current documentation and description of the precomputation fits the existing code -- there are some choice to be made.  Meanwhile, here's a small amount of explanatory theory:

For l=2,3,5,7,13, the curve `X_0(l)` has genus zero, so its function field is pure transcendental.  The Fricke Module, denoted t, is a generator of the function field such that t=0 and t=oo lie above j=oo; the normalization here is completely classical, and the situation is fully defined by giving j as a degree l+1 rational function in t, which is what the Fricke_module dict in the code does (though not for l=2 which is simpler and handled entirely separately).

Next one writes down a "universal elliptic curve with l-isogeny", say `E_t`, as a curve over Q(t) with j-invariant j (viewed as an element of Q(t)).  This is not unique!

I am writing this up -- there's an old preprint of me and Mark Watkins which never got finished, and now there's more delay since with my student Kimi I am extending all this to the cases where `X_0(l)` is hyperelliptic.

The algorithm has been slightly simplified in the following ways:  it works with the Fricke polynomials which are ZZ[t] rather than the actual Fricke modules (which are rational functions with denominator t), thus avoiding the creation of rational functions.  Secondly, it uses a different model for the universal elliptic curve defined over Q(t), which is integral over Z[t] and has good reduction at as many places as possible.  This makes the generic kernel polynomials lie in Z[t][x] rather than Q(t)[x], and also makes them simpler.

The previous version was not incorrect at all, but this seemed to be the right time to replace the older models with new ones, since the code was being refactored anyway.

Thanks for fixing the typos;  I have set the ticket back to "needs review".

The documentation for Psi is missing some of the information from your comment above: It states the places of bad reduction of E_t but doesn't mention that E_t is a 'universal elliptic curve with l-isogeny' and that the model was specifically chosen for it's reduction behaviour. Shouldn't this information also be in the docstring?

Everything else looks OK (with the doctests still running).

I think that the docstrings already are very long too.

Is there maybe a reference one could add? Julian and I tried to understand this patch and didn't found many references. The preprint you mentioned above only has 'Fricke, Not sure which book'. I believe adding such a reference would be a lot of help for other people in the future.

I didn't mean to suggest that the code can not be accepted. It obviously is an improvement and I just wanted to know if the documentation could be improved by adding a reference.

I will give the patch a positive review now. Further improvements to the documentation will probably happen when your more general code arrives.
