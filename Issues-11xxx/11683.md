The import of sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_curve_isogeny.py (which happens on every startup of sage) takes a relatively big amount of time

```
$ time ./sage -startuptime|grep ell_curve_isogeny:
          ell_curve_isogeny: 0.133 (ell_field)

real    0m0.994s
user    0m0.810s
sys     0m0.154s
```
Lazily computing the constants in this file helps a lot (see the attached patch):

```
$ time ./sage -startuptime|grep ell_curve_isogeny:
          ell_curve_isogeny: 0.001 (ell_field)

real    0m0.849s
user    0m0.672s
sys     0m0.164s
```
**Apply:**

1. [attachment:trac_11683_ell_curve_isogeny_speedup_combined.patch]
2. [attachment:trac_11683_review.patch]

I would like to see the initial comments placed in context, and perhaps a doctest for the actual computation of Psi5 (even if it takes 4s). In any case, you do need doctests.

You're right. I turned the comments describing how to compute the precomputed things into docstrings. Unfortunately they don't seem to work anymore. The line

```
sage: Psi5 = sum([X**i * f.coefficient({x:i})(X,t) for i in range(3)]).monic()
```
fails with

```
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular' object has no attribute 'monic'
```

Can this be fixed easily?

Just a remark, it seems sage improved quite a bit on the underlying computation. It is quite a bit faster than 13 hours (that is what the docstring says) already:

```
sage: time a,b=Psi(13, use_stored=True),Psi(13, use_stored=False)
Time: CPU 178.47 s, Wall: 178.51 s
sage: a==b
True

The previous version was not incorrect at all, but this seemed to be the right time to replace the older models with new ones, since the code was being refactored anyway.

You may be right, but it's a docstring not a textbook or thesis...we are currently finishing similar (though more complicated) code for all the cases where X_0(l) is hyperelliptic, and also getting these genus 0 cases to apply in characteristics 2 and 3, so there will be a lot more to say then (at which point we'll move this code into a separate file too).
