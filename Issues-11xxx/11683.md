The import of sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_curve_isogeny.py (which happens on every startup of sage) takes a relatively big amount of time

```
$ time ./sage -startuptime|grep ell_curve_isogeny:
          ell_curve_isogeny: 0.133 (ell_field)

real    0m0.994s
user    0m0.810s
sys     0m0.154s
```
Lazily computing the constants in this file helps a lot (see the attached patch):

```
$ time ./sage -startuptime|grep ell_curve_isogeny:
          ell_curve_isogeny: 0.001 (ell_field)

real    0m0.849s

You're right. I turned the comments describing how to compute the precomputed things into docstrings. Unfortunately they don't seem to work anymore. The line

```
sage: Psi5 = sum([X**i * f.coefficient({x:i})(X,t) for i in range(3)]).monic()
```
fails with

```
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular' object has no attribute 'monic'
```

Can this be fixed easily?

I am writing this up -- there's an old preprint of me and Mark Watkins which never got finished, and now there's more delay since with my student Kimi I am extending all this to the cases where `X_0(l)` is hyperelliptic.

Just a remark, it seems sage improved quite a bit on the underlying computation. It is quite a bit faster than 13 hours (that is what the docstring says) already:

```
sage: time a,b=Psi(13, use_stored=True),Psi(13, use_stored=False)

The algorithm has been slightly simplified in the following ways:  it works with the Fricke polynomials which are ZZ[t] rather than the actual Fricke modules (which are rational functions with denominator t), thus avoiding the creation of rational functions.  Secondly, it uses a different model for the universal elliptic curve defined over Q(t), which is integral over Z[t] and has good reduction at as many places as possible.  This makes the generic kernel polynomials lie in Z[t][x] rather than Q(t)[x], and also makes them simpler.

The previous version was not incorrect at all, but this seemed to be the right time to replace the older models with new ones, since the code was being refactored anyway.

Thanks for fixing the typos;  I have set the ticket back to "needs review".

You may be right, but it's a docstring not a textbook or thesis...we are currently finishing similar (though more complicated) code for all the cases where X_0(l) is hyperelliptic, and also getting these genus 0 cases to apply in characteristics 2 and 3, so there will be a lot more to say then (at which point we'll move this code into a separate file too).

One reason the docstrings are long is that I was asked (e.g. on this ticket) to give an explanation.  So please do not now ask me to shorten them.

I feel I am going round in circles here.  This ticket was created because the old code was causing an unnecessary delay in Sage startup time, and the patch fixes that, and clarifies how the code works at the same time.

I didn't mean to suggest that the code can not be accepted. It obviously is an improvement and I just wanted to know if the documentation could be improved by adding a reference.

I will give the patch a positive review now. Further improvements to the documentation will probably happen when your more general code arrives.
