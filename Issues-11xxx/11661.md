```
Dear Jeroen,

Thank you for telling us about this. We will take care about this in 
the GAP 4.5.2 (aka 2nd beta) on which we're working now. 

Actually, these files only make sense in the Windows binary distribution,
so the source distro does not need to have them at all.

Best wishes,
Alexander
```

The spkg is a mess anyway.

Probably true, but I did not realize this when making this ticket.  I simply checked all non-world-readable files in the Sage install.  I can proudly say that now *all* installed files all world-readable (at least if the umask allows this).
