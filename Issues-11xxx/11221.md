```
var('x,y')
contour_plot(x*y,(x,0,10),(y,0,10),fill=False,contours=[2,3,8],labels=True)
```
This doesn't work according to the doc, which says

```
label_inline â€“ boolean (default: False if fill is True, otherwise True), controls whether the underlying contour is removed or not.
```
Not sure what the desired behavior is, but need to clarify and/or fix.
