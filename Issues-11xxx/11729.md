This ticket implements a cached module importer for Python. It compiles a list of all available files during build (when `sage -b` is run), hooks into the Python import framework and finds modules by the predetermined file list. 

Building the Sage library (`sage -b`) automatically creates the cache and the `sitecustomize.py` that is used to load the importer into the Python session. The cache is a standard Python dictionary in `sage/misc/modules_cache.py`.

```
[vbraun@volker-laptop-two hg]$ strace -e file -f sage -c quit |& grep ENOENT | wc -l
26327
[vbraun@volker-laptop-two hg]$ sage -b
...
[vbraun@volker-laptop-two hg]$ strace -e file -f sage -c quit |& grep ENOENT | wc -l
3785
```

If you encounter any problems while testing this patch, you have to 

```
rm $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python/site-packages/sitecustomize.py*
```
to not load the importer during Python startup.


Apply trac_11729_cached_importer.patch to the sage library and  trac_11729_import_cache_during_build.patch to the sage_scripts (`$AGE_LOCAL/bin`) repository.
