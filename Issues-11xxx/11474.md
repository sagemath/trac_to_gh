While elliptic curves are derived from `sage.structure.parent.Parent`, they violate the "unique parent" condition:

```
sage: K = GF(1<<50,'t')
sage: j = K.random_element()
sage: from sage.structure.parent import Parent
sage: isinstance(EllipticCurve(j=j),Parent)
True
sage: EllipticCurve(j=j) is EllipticCurve(j=j)
False
sage: EllipticCurve(j=j) == EllipticCurve(j=j)
True 
```

Some people on [sage-nt](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-nt/browse_thread/thread/ec8d0ad14a819082) originally agreed that it is a bug. Other people think it isn't...

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

My approach is:

A) Let `EllipticCurve_generic` inherit from `UniqueRepresentation`. If I am not mistaken, every other elliptic curve inherits from that, so, that should be fine.

B) The `__init__` methods should be uniform: *All* `__init__` methods should accept precisely one argument, namely an immutable sequence "ainvs" (in particular, the underlying field can be obtained from ainvs).

C) By `__classcall__` methods, make sure that the existing ways of constructing an elliptic curve will still work. In particular, it will create the immutable sequence "ainv".

One detail to consider: Sometimes an elliptic curve is taken from the Cremona database (see `sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_rational_field`). The database provides certain attributes. It is possible that an elliptic curve *with the same a-invariant* is already in the cache, ignorant of the additional attributes.

But the classcall method could very well assign those additional attributes to an elliptic curve found in the cache before returning it. So, it should still work.

Or should perhaps `ProjectiveCurve_generic` already be a unique parent? That's what elliptic curves derive from. Or even `AlgebraicScheme_subscheme`?  How far should one go?

The discussion on [sage-nt](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-nt/browse_thread/thread/ec8d0ad14a819082) shows that it is even not clear whether we want elliptic curves to be unique parents (yet).

Anyway, I posted a preliminary patch. There are some doctest failures -- a test log is attached as well.

Some of the errors are easy to understand: Previously, one had a "Generic morphism", but with unique parents one has a "Generic endomorphism". Others seem more tricky. For example one gets

```

    AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'ellwp'
```

Hence, first there is a (warning or error?) message "`// ** nInitExp failed: using Z/2^2`", and then something is a dict that ought to be a completely different object.

On the bright side, one has the following.

Elliptic curves are unique, even when they are created in different ways:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('5077a'); E
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 - 7*x + 6 over Rational Field
sage: E is EllipticCurve('5077a') is EllipticCurve(QQ, E.a_invariants()) is EllipticCurve(j = E.j_invariant())
True
```

If an elliptic curve is provided with some custom attribute and the "same" curve is found in the database with different attributes, then one has no uniqueness of parents; this is in order to prevent the database from overriding stuff that the user has computed:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0, 1, 1, -2, 0])
sage: E is EllipticCurve('389a')
True
sage: E._EllipticCurve_rational_field__cremona_label = 'bogus'
sage: E is EllipticCurve('389a')
False
sage: E.label()
'bogus'
sage: EllipticCurve('389a').label()
'389a1'
```

However, if the custom attribute is removed, then the data from the database are used to provide a value for that attribute:

```
sage: del E._EllipticCurve_rational_field__cremona_label
sage: E is EllipticCurve('389a') # uniqueness of parents again
True
# The label has implicitly been updated
sage: E._EllipticCurve_rational_field__cremona_label
'389 a 1'
```

I really like the idea, as I like the general idea of having the Abelian group of (rational?) points as a separate object.

There is already a very basic class in `sage.schemes.projective_homset`; you can do

```
sage: E=EllipticCurve('37a1')
sage: K.<a>=QuadraticField(57)
sage: E(K)
Abelian group of points on Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 + (-1)*x over Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 57
sage: type(E(K))
<class 'sage.schemes.projective.projective_homset.SchemeHomset_points_abelian_variety_field_with_category'>
sage: P=(0,0)
sage: E(P) == E(QQ)(P)
True
```
We could create a subclass of `SchemeHomset_points_abelian_variety` for groups of points of elliptic curves, and then separate subclasses of that for  different base fields (rationals, general number fields, finite fields, maybe the complex field, etc.)  Then we could start moving functionality so that `E.rank()` is defined as `E.group_of_points(E.base_field()).rank()`, etc.

(In the above example it looks as if `E(K)` is interpreted as the group of `K`-points of `E.base_extend(K)` rather than as the group of `K`-points of `E`, but this could probably be changed.)

Yes, I think we should.  To rephrase your point, an isogeny *is* a map f: E -> E' between elliptic curves over a field K (preserving 0), and *induces* group homomorphisms f(L): E(L) -> E'(L) for every extension L/K.  (In categorical language, E determines a functor from K-algebras to Abelian groups, and f determines a morphism [natural transformation] between two such functors.)

Of course, as a Sage user you should still be able to construct a point P from its coordinates (u, v) by typing `P = E(u, v)` as an alternative for `P = E(K)(u, v)`, and likewise you should be able to apply an isogeny f to P by typing either `f(P)` or `f(K)(P)`.

I think this sounds like a good plan.  It does have a certain the risk of becoming a big project, so be careful to split it into well-defined steps and to proceed one step at a time.

Just some thoughts about the first of your two points for now.  Before doing any coding, I would say it is essential to have a clear picture of both the mathematical objects and the Sage (or Python) objects representing them, and of the relations between them.  Currently, given an elliptic curve *E* over a field *K*, there are at least three kinds of objects to consider:
- the Sage object `E` representing the curve itself as a scheme (type `EllipticCurve_rational_field` or similar);
- the group of points `E(K)` (or more generally `E(L)` for an extension `L` of `K`), which does not care about the group structure but is the parent of (the Sage objects representing the) *K*-rational points of *E* (type `SchemeHomset_points_abelian_variety_field`);
- if *K* is a finite field, there is also `E.abelian_group()`, which returns an object of type `AdditiveAbelianGroupWrapper`.  This represents the group structure of `E(K)` concretely by returning a product of at most two finite cyclic groups and an embedding of this product into the "abstract" group `E(K)` (which in this case is an isomorphism).
This looks like the right framework for elliptic curves over number fields as well, since the group of *K*-points is finitely generated.  For general fields (e.g. **C**), it only makes sense to have the first two kinds of objects.  So writing a variant of `E.abelian_group()` for elliptic curves over number fields could be a logical first step.

It would indeed be nice to have a category of Abelian varieties, but this is probably largely independent of the rest of what you want to do.  The current implementation of `EllipticCurve_finite_field.abelian_group()` does not refer to categories either.  I would guess it is easiest to do the other things first without involving a category of Abelian varieties (in the code; you can of course always keep it in mind as the place where things live mathematically).  If you need to specify a category somewhere, `Schemes(K)` will probably be good enough for now, since this is the category in which elliptic curves over *K* currently live.

But if a group can be represented abstractly (by its elements and an algorithm for the group operation), then it seems to me that these two should be the same, with the generators computed lazily when the user asks for them.

Considering the EC part, we already have almost what we want isn't it?

Let `E=EllipticCurve(whatever)`, we "only" have to:
* make `E` unique : it is already almost done by Simon's patch, although this patch maintains the gens in `E`. Meanwhile, the files had been edited for other reasons; will nevertheless the automatic tools work or might I manually edit the files thanks to the diff in order to reuse Simon's work?
* turn `E(K)` into an actual group
* extend the support of `E.abelian_group(K)` when K is a number field (and move the method in E(K)?)
* move `.rank()`, `.gens()` and other non-canonical methods/attribute to `E.abelian_group(K)

I'm not sure to see the point. You would like to have the map `E(K) -> E.abelian_group()` which calculate calculate the generators, and also the map `E.abelian_group() -> E (or E(K)?)` which calculates the a-invariants of E (or anything which determines E uniquely) from the generators?

My point is that somewhere there has to be code which, given a point and known generators, expresses that point as a Z-linear combination of the generators.  Assuming that E.abelian_group was an abstract abelian group, this code would be used in mapping from E(K) to it.

My cremona_mini.db is up to date. The error doesn't seem related to the database. In a sage shell

With Simon's patch applied (using the `__classcall__` magic all over the place).

Either way, I don't understand how this line is supposed to work. I think we need help from Simon, if we want to resurrect his patch.

Probably not. Anyway, I gitified it, thus I'm pushing it, even if it doesn't work. At least, it will be easier to read Simon's proposed changes.

There were conflicts with #10999 (which is another bug related to uniqueness) in `ell_rational_field.py`. I hopefully merged them correctly.

If one uses a factory, then one can rather cleanly separate the creation of the cache key from the input data, additional data used to create the object (without being relevant to the cache) and the creation of the object to be returned.

`CachedRepresentation` is essentially equivalent to using a factory. In particular, it does **not** result in unique parents. Drawbacks:
- It can not be used on extension classes, since a metaclass is involved (which is not supported by Cython).
- It does not cleanly separate creation of the cache, additional arguments and object creation. You can write `__classcall(_private)__` so that it does exactly the same as a factory, it can look up stuff in a database, and so on. But the code is less clean and thus more error prone.

So, at this point, we have some kind of factory, but no uniqueness of parents. In order to add unique parent behaviour, one can simply add `WithEqualityById` to the list of base classes (and make sure that hash and comparison will not be overridden in the sub-class).

`UniqueRepresentation` simply is a ready-made combination of `CachedRepresentation` and `WithEqualityById`, there is nothing more to it.

I hope that these remarks help to assess whether it would be better to use a factory PLUS `WithEqualityById` on elliptic curves, or "simply" use `UniqueRepresentation`.

Something that I think you recently clarified to me elsewhere, and which might be worth emphasising here too, is that "unique parents" really refers to *two* conditions:
- equivalent input data (in the sense that we regard the resulting objects as being "the same", e.g. *a*-coefficients vs. Cremona label corresponding to the same curve) should result in identical parents;
- parents should compare equal if and only if they are identical.
I was thinking about the first point, which is the more difficult one here.  If we end up solving this by implementing a `UniqueFactory`, then the second point can be solved by simply inheriting from `WithEqualityById`, right?

Sounds like quite a big job, needing people who know enough about elliptic curves and also enough about UniqueFactories.   Perhaps we can recruit Nils Bruin to help?

I have been working on a branch that makes elliptic curves unique using `UniqueFactory`.  It simultaneously cleans up the elliptic curve construction code and the relation of Sage elliptic curves to the data in Cremona's database.

My approach removes the need for a separate "database curve" attached to an elliptic curve over **Q**.  With my branch, an elliptic curve constructed from the database is *identical* to the same curve constructed using Weierstrass coefficients.  Moreover, the curves returned by `E.database_curve()` and `E.minimal_model()` are now identical, and both of them are identical to *E* if *E* is already in canonical minimal form.

I have to add some documentation and will upload my branch soon.  There are unfortunately two remaining doctest failures, which are manifestations of #10665 and #16317.
