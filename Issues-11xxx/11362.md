Previously this ticket was for repairing "show for Cayley tables as MathJax does not support setlength".

While fixing that based on the latest Sage develop branch, I needed to augment `OutputHtml` rich output with latex whenever possible.

With the branch, Cayley tables are rendered correctly in Jupyter notebook. Moreover, because of the patch for `OutputHtml`, the notebook is exported as pdf correctly.

Checkout the uploaded Jupyterbook and try to export it as pdf. 

Please test the branch for possible unexpected side effects, though I guess there would be none. 

Below is the previous description of the ticket:

---

Define a finite group and its multiplication table:

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(3)
sage: T = S.multiplication_table()
```

The multiplication table can give latex code
to be copy-pasted in a paper:

```
sage: latex(T)
\setlength{\arraycolsep}{2\ex}
\begin{array}{r|*{6}{r}}
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\ast}&a&b&c&d&e&f\\\hline
{}a&a&b&c&d&e&f\\
{}b&b&a&d&c&f&e\\
{}c&c&e&a&f&b&d\\
{}d&d&f&b&e&a&c\\
{}e&e&c&f&a&d&b\\
{}f&f&d&e&b&c&a\\
\end{array}}
```
but is also used for showing the table in a notebook worksheet.

In Sage 4.8 with SageNB we used to have:

```
sage: show(T)
Unknown control sequence '\setlength'
```

In Sage 9.2.rc0 with  Jupyter, `show(T)` does
display a table but with `\setlength` displayed
in red instead of contributing to the rendering.

I thought this was on #10787, but now I see it is not.  I'm going to point it here.

I've been waiting on `MathJax` before tackling this, on the hope it has better support for tables.

The PR adds a variable `sage.misc.latex_macros.sage_configurable_mathjax_macros` that holds a list of macro definitions that `pretty_print` will include in all LaTeX code that is sent to `MathJax`. The PR then solves the problem on this ticket by adding `\multicolumn` and `\setlength` to this list as no-ops that swallow their arguments.

I don't like the proposed solution. It seems a bandage.

A general solution that would also solve possible future problems would be to introduce a new magic method obj._mathjax_() which provides latex code renderable by mathjax and defaults to an alias of obj._latex_() when it is not defined for obj.

`MathJax` is a javascript renderer for latex in html, and also sometimes means the subset of latex it supports. On the other hand `LaTeX` is a format for TeX which primarily targets printing.

It seems to me currently there is some unfortunate confused code in this respect in the rich output system in Sage. Perhaps straightening the confused code would give a natural solution of this ticket's problem. I will investigate more.
