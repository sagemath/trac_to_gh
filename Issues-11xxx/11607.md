Sometimes a user might want to read & inspect the constraints in a linear program. For example, some code of mine generates a **lot** of linear programs (I described the project to Nathann once), and it would be nice if I could read the constraints off one program so as to combine it with another. Example usage would be:

```
sage: lp = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: lp.add_constraint(lp[0]-lp[1],min=1)
sage: lp.add_constraint(2*lp[1]-lp[0]-lp[2],max=1)
sage: lp.get_constraints()
[(1.0, ([1, 0],[-1.0, 1.0]), None),(None, ([2, 1, 0], [-1.0, 2.0, -1.0]), 1.0)]

In my case, I have a program that generates constraints based on a polynomial system. I don't personally know what the constraints are, and in fact I want to read the generated constraints. For example, I might want to check in some easy circumstances that the program is generating the correct constraints.

> I think those method, if you think they may beuseful by themselves, would make more sense in the generic_backend module.


Would that be immediately accessible to someone who has a `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` object?

I didn't necessarily want the overhead of a dictionary. I could see adding that functionality, but if I were running a program where efficiency might be of some concern, generating a dictionary every time I do this seems a bit much.

Does that seem reasonable to you, or do you think I should generate the dictionary anyway? Efficiency here isn't an actual concern of mine at the moment, and might never be.

Yay :-)

Actually, such a program might very well have counted the number of constraints added to the program. :-)

In any case, we can add a method to obtain this information, say, `number_of_constraints()`. We could go beyond this, and add to `get_constraints()` an optional argument, `which_constraints`, which is a list of constraints the user desires, rather than the entire list.

This doesn't *feel* backend-ish to me.

I don't see why they shouldn't be exposed. As for the aim, IMHO it's always better to expose existing functionality that the user can use, at least if the functionality is read-only.

In my particular case, I might need to extend the constraints of one program by the constraints of another. This is probably not the only way to implement what I need done, but it is *one* way. Currently, I do it by building for each potential program a list of `libsingular` polynomials that correspond to each constraint, discard the programs after testing feasibility, then copying the equations of the best program into another one, using the `coeff` command.

Either, but mostly time.

> Is it the idea of having a new element (the dictionary) attached to the MILP structure that you find ugly ?


Here I think you're thinking I want this for #11606; that's not the case.

Helloooooo !!!

> In any case, we can add a method to obtain this information, say, `number_of_constraints()`. We could go beyond this, and add to `get_constraints()` an optional argument, `which_constraints`, which is a list of constraints the user desires, rather than the entire list.


I think "The Sage Way" would rather be something like "constraints()" instead of "get_constraints()" and an optional parameter, n for example, so that constraints(n = 10) returns constraint 10.

> This doesn't *feel* backend-ish to me.


Yeah, well. Sometimes, takes me one week to notice I've been stupid. You're perfectly right.

> I don't see why they shouldn't be exposed. As for the aim, IMHO it's always better to expose existing functionality that the user can use, at least if the functionality is read-only.


Right again. In my #687&%$&#687 of a head, they were exposed and useful in the GenericBackend class. Which was stupid, there's no way it would hurt to have them around in Python too.

> In my particular case, I might need to extend the constraints of one program by the constraints of another. This is probably not the only way to implement what I need done, but it is *one* way. Currently, I do it by building for each potential program a list of `libsingular` polynomials that correspond to each constraint, discard the programs after testing feasibility, then copying the equations of the best program into another one, using the `coeff` command. It's a fabulous bottleneck. The problem I'm working on generates a *lot* of programs.

I hope we'll find a way to make this MILP class more useful to deal with such problems. But you will have to explain them to me, your use cases are very different `:-)`

> Here I think you're thinking I want this for #11606; that's not the case.


> I'm perfectly open to any suggestions you might have; maybe we should take the discussion of the actual problem I'm working on into private email? I can send you a copy of the relevant sage code, but I don't know if you want to look at this monstrosity... `:-)`


Why not ? I will not need to understand it all, but just the part in which the LP is generated. And "understanding" the LP isn't needed either, just how it is built `:-)`

Hello again John !!!

I'm sorry for the time it takes to merge these patches, I'll be defending my PhD next month and I am crushed under the weight of the "urgent things" that should have been done already.

I read your patch again, and wondered at the terminology : "contraints" is used at some places, "row" at others. because I often mistake a row for a column I double-checked, but anyway your ``constraints`` method uses the ``row`` methods, so they are indeed returning the information on the constraints only, and not the variables as I had thought for a minute `:-)`

So, the thing is : what about having just one method ``constraints`` to do all the work ?

* ``constraints()`` would return all the constraints as a list, as it does now
* ``constraints(indices = [1,2,3])`` would return constraints 1,2,3 as a list
* ``constraints(indices = 1)`` would return only one constraint, as the triples you used before. This way, all the job is done by one function, we stick to the terminology "constraints", and all is well under the sun ? `:-)`

It is one of the nice features of Python : having no types let us play a bit `:-)`

Tell me what you think of it. I'll try to make my next reviews muuuuch shorter !

Helloooooooooooo !!!

Sorry for all this time spent on that ticket. Your patch is nice, though it required a bit of other modifications:

* The documentation mentionned a former ``n`` parameter
* I reformatted this a bit to fit with the other methods
* I thought it was more natural to return only one triple and not a list of only one triple when ``indices`` is an integer
* There was something bad with the doctests : the order in which the values are returned (the indices and the coefficient) depends on the solver, so running tests on your file with CBC or CPLEX installed returned new errors. For this reason, I rewrote a bit the documentation so that the examples are at first *not* tested.
