Sometimes a user might want to read & inspect the constraints in a linear program. For example, some code of mine generates a **lot** of linear programs (I described the project to Nathann once), and it would be nice if I could read the constraints off one program so as to combine it with another. Example usage would be:

```
sage: lp = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: lp.add_constraint(lp[0]-lp[1],min=1)
sage: lp.add_constraint(2*lp[1]-lp[0]-lp[2],max=1)
sage: lp.get_constraints()
[(1.0, ([1, 0],[-1.0, 1.0]), None),(None, ([2, 1, 0], [-1.0, 2.0, -1.0]), 1.0)]
```

Hello John !

I don't think the row and row_bounds method as they are implemented can be very useful to the user. They gave you access to the information of a constraint and take as an input the line number, but the user has for the moment no way whatsoever to know the number of a constraint. I mean, when would the user want to obtain the constraint corresponding to a constraint he does not know already, for instance obtained through your get_constraints method ?

I have a similar remark for the get_constraints method. It returns a constraint as a list of indices and coefficient, but the indices have no meaning for the user who only deals with symbolic variables.

In my case, I have a program that generates constraints based on a polynomial system. I don't personally know what the constraints are, and in fact I want to read the generated constraints. For example, I might want to check in some easy circumstances that the program is generating the correct constraints.

> I think those method, if you think they may beuseful by themselves, would make more sense in the generic_backend module.

Would that be immediately accessible to someone who has a `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` object?

I didn't necessarily want the overhead of a dictionary. I could see adding that functionality, but if I were running a program where efficiency might be of some concern, generating a dictionary every time I do this seems a bit much.

Does that seem reasonable to you, or do you think I should generate the dictionary anyway? Efficiency here isn't an actual concern of mine at the moment, and might never be.

No, in this case it would not, but this is my point exactly : should such functions be exposed, and if so in which aim ?

When you talk of overhead, do you have memory or time in mind ? I do not think the memory cost would be that important, but as you repeatedly want to check for the existence of a given constraint, the "Set" structure which yields a log(n) check for existence seems more fitting than linearly exploring the cases each time a constraint is added. 

Is it the idea of having a new element (the dictionary) attached to the MILP structure that you find ugly ? I have to admit it's not that sexy...

But then I try to keep in mind that we have different applications in mind, and that it can make much better sense in your situation `:-)`

If you think this would be a nice feature of the MILP class, however, I do think the dictionary trick is the best way to write it. `:-)`

Even the number of constraints is not available right now `:-)`\n\nActually, such a program might very well have counted the number of constraints added to the program. :-)\n\nIn any case, we can add a method to obtain this information, say, `number_of_constraints()`. We could go beyond this, and add to `get_constraints()` an optional argument, `which_constraints`, which is a list of constraints the user desires, rather than the entire list.\n\nThis doesn't *feel* backend-ish to me.\n\n> \n> > Would that be immediately accessible to someone who has a `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` object?\n\n> \n> No, in this case it would not, but this is my point exactly : should such functions be exposed, and if so in which aim ?\n\nI don't see why they shouldn't be exposed. As for the aim, IMHO it's always better to expose existing functionality that the user can use, at least if the functionality is read-only.\n\nIn my particular case, I might need to extend the constraints of one program by the constraints of another. This is probably not the only way to implement what I need done, but it is *one* way. Currently, I do it by building for each potential program a list of `libsingular` polynomials that correspond to each constraint, discard the programs after testing feasibility, then copying the equations of the best program into another one, using the `coeff` command. It's a fabulous bottleneck. The problem I'm working on generates a *lot* of programs.\n\n(Notice I'm contradicting myself on efficiency -- I had forgotten how I might use these methods.)\n\n> > I didn't necessarily want the overhead of a dictionary.

Replying to [@nathanncohen](#comment:5):
> I agree that in this case the MILP class should give you an easy way to check that, and to this end your get_constraints() method is a perfectly good answer.

Yay :-)

> I still feel that the row(int index) and row_bounds(int index) feel more like backend methods, as they require an information that the user does not have : the indices of the rows. Even the number of constraints is not available right now `:-)`

Actually, such a program might very well have counted the number of constraints added to the program. :-)

In any case, we can add a method to obtain this information, say, `number_of_constraints()`. We could go beyond this, and add to `get_constraints()` an optional argument, `which_constraints`, which is a list of constraints the user desires, rather than the entire list.

This doesn't *feel* backend-ish to me.

I don't see why they shouldn't be exposed. As for the aim, IMHO it's always better to expose existing functionality that the user can use, at least if the functionality is read-only.

In my particular case, I might need to extend the constraints of one program by the constraints of another. This is probably not the only way to implement what I need done, but it is *one* way. Currently, I do it by building for each potential program a list of `libsingular` polynomials that correspond to each constraint, discard the programs after testing feasibility, then copying the equations of the best program into another one, using the `coeff` command. It's a fabulous bottleneck. The problem I'm working on generates a *lot* of programs.

(Notice I'm contradicting myself on efficiency -- I had forgotten how I might use these methods.)

Either, but mostly time.

Here I think you're thinking I want this for #11606; that's not the case.

I think "The Sage Way" would rather be something like "constraints()" instead of "get_constraints()" and an optional parameter, n for example, so that constraints(n = 10) returns constraint 10.

> This doesn't *feel* backend-ish to me.

Yeah, well. Sometimes, takes me one week to notice I've been stupid. You're perfectly right.

Right again. In my #687&%$&#687 of a head, they were exposed and useful in the GenericBackend class. Which was stupid, there's no way it would hurt to have them around in Python too.

I hope we'll find a way to make this MILP class more useful to deal with such problems. But you will have to explain them to me, your use cases are very different `:-)`

Why not ? I will not need to understand it all, but just the part in which the LP is generated. And "understanding" the LP isn't needed either, just how it is built `:-)`

Hello again John !!!

I'm sorry for the time it takes to merge these patches, I'll be defending my PhD next month and I am crushed under the weight of the "urgent things" that should have been done already.

I read your patch again, and wondered at the terminology : "contraints" is used at some places, "row" at others. because I often mistake a row for a column I double-checked, but anyway your ``constraints`` method uses the ``row`` methods, so they are indeed returning the information on the constraints only, and not the variables as I had thought for a minute `:-)`

So, the thing is : what about having just one method ``constraints`` to do all the work ?

* ``constraints()`` would return all the constraints as a list, as it does now
* ``constraints(indices = [1,2,3])`` would return constraints 1,2,3 as a list
* ``constraints(indices = 1)`` would return only one constraint, as the triples you used before. This way, all the job is done by one function, we stick to the terminology "constraints", and all is well under the sun ? `:-)`

It is one of the nice features of Python : having no types let us play a bit `:-)`

Tell me what you think of it. I'll try to make my next reviews muuuuch shorter !

Should I be concerned about the lines in the doctests of your patch that say, "not tested"? For example,

```
    To obtain the list of all constraints:: 

            sage: p.constraints()          # not tested

That's my only concern with your patch (I haven't tested it yet though -- will do so in a second).
