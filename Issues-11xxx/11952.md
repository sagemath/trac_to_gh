Conversion of a Python `complex` to PARI fails:

```
sage: pari(complex(I))
  ***   Warning: unused characters: j.
1
```

Moreover, the conversion of other Python types to PARI can be improved by adding special code instead of using strings.  This also makes the conversion more precise, see the example below:

Without patch:

```
sage: f = float(4651990089563211/4503599627370496)
sage: f
1.0329493015522242
sage: pari(f)
1.03294930155000
```
With patch:

```
sage: f = float(4651990089563211/4503599627370496)
sage: f
1.0329493015522242
sage: pari(f)
1.03294930155222
```

Looks good to me (pending all doctests passing) and much cleaner. I checked the derivatives in lseries_ell.py to higher precision, the new values are correct. 

Nit:

```
if PyBool_Check(s):
    return self.PARI_ONE if s else self.PARI_ZERO
```
