Conversion of a Python `complex` to PARI fails:

```
sage: pari(complex(I))
  ***   Warning: unused characters: j.
1
```

Moreover, the conversion of other Python types to PARI can be improved by adding special code instead of using strings.  This also makes the conversion more precise, see the example below:

Without patch:

```
sage: f = float(4651990089563211/4503599627370496)
sage: f
1.0329493015522242
sage: pari(f)
1.03294930155000
```
With patch:

```
sage: f = float(4651990089563211/4503599627370496)
sage: f
1.0329493015522242
sage: pari(f)
1.03294930155222
```
