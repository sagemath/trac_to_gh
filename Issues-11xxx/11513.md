A fast way to check if an expression is zero is important in many places, see for example [#11143 comment:15](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/11143#comment:15). We should put the numerical check mentioned there in a method (`_is_numerically_zero()`) of symbolic expressions (`sage.symbolic.expression.Expression`).

Hi Paul, I wanted to ask you about this in Warwick. I got caught up in the linear algebra stuff and this slipped my mind.

`is_zero()` usually ends up calling maxima, which is very slow especially in the context of automatic evaluation of symbolic functions.

At the moment, many symbolic functions (see `sage/functions/generalized.py` for example) use code similar to the following to test if an argument is zero within a reasonable time: (BTW, this code should not initialize `CIF` on every call.)

```
        try:
            approx_x = ComplexIntervalField()(x)
            if bool(approx_x.imag() == 0):      # x is real
                if bool(approx_x.real() == 0):  # x is zero
                    return None
                else:
                    return 0
        except:                     # x is symbolic
            pass    
```

The reason for this ticket was to move this to a separate function to avoid code duplication. If this function can detect `pi + (pi - 1)*pi - pi^2 == 0` or `(pi - 1)*x - pi*x + x == 0` it would be even better. In this context, false negatives are not a problem. We should just avoid false positives. It's also OK if this test is not purely numeric. Any suggestions for a better name for this function is also welcome of course.

Dear Burcin,

> The reason for this ticket was to move this to a separate function to avoid code duplication.

ok I understand. But I don't like the proposed solution, since:

(1) it might say a number is zero whereas it is not (if the number is tiny, but due to rounding
    errors it gets numerically evaluated to zero, because the precision used is fixed)

(2) it might say a zero number is not (again due to rounding errors)

It should be the responsibility of the user only to make such approximations.

What happens if your function `_is_numerically_zero()` only checks for *exact* integer or
real or complex zero? Do many doctests fail?
