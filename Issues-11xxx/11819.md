```
The Python module 'new' is deprecated and has been removed in Python 3.0, so since it's not hard to avoid it, we shouldn't use it.  The attached patch removes all imports of 'new', tested with

```
sage: search_src('import', 'new', whole_word=True)
```
The file new.py (in `SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python/`) contains code like

```
from types import InstanceType as instance
```
so we just have to replace

```
import new
new.instance(...)
```
with

```
import types
types.InstanceType(...)
```

It appears I added some uses of 'new' in #11716. So your patch doesn't apply anymore. I'm trying to do something about it now.

The doctest 

```
    sage: sage0("'new' in sys.modules")
    False
```
fails for me.  It might be imported by IPython; if I do `sage --ipython`:

```
In [1]: import sys

In [2]: 'new' in sys.modules
Out[2]: True
```
Or more tersely:

```
$ sage --ipython -c "import sys; print 'new' in sys.modules"
True
```
