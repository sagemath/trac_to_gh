There should be a way to customize how a function is printed and how it is translated into Latex, as requested on [ask-sage](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/579/how-to-change-_latex_-of-log-to-ln).

I suggest, as a first step, to add methods `set_name()` and `set_latex_name()` that change the value of the cdefined attributes `_name` used for printing and `_latex_name` used for translation to latex. Then, the following would work:

```
sage: tan.set_name('tg')
sage: tan
tg
sage: tan.set_latex_name(r'\tg')
sage: latex(tan)
\tg
```

However, that can really only be the first step. Because, when I did so, I still got

```
sage: tan(x)
tan(x)
sage: latex(tan(x))
\tan\left(x\right)
```
Hence, in addition to that, the given latex name should be propagated to expressions.

Please upload that preliminary patch so others can work with it!  

The SR stuff does come from Ginac, as I thought I remembered.   Maybe Burcin will have a brief comment to put us on the right track for that; I don't quite understand how it works, though I think I once nearly figured it out :)

Patch's up.

With it, this works

```
sage: tan.set_latex_name(r'\tg')
sage: latex(tan)
\tg
sage: tan.set_name('tg')
sage: tan
tg
```
but this doesn't

```
sage: tan(x)
tan(x)
sage: latex(tan(x))
\tan\left(x\right)
```

For reference for anyone implementing this correctly, in [this thread on sage-support](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-support/wkzIydg95k8), Burcin recommends 

```
It needs to go through the 
registry of functions stored in Pynac and update the name or the 
printing functions there.
```
