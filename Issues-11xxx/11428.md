There should be a way to customize how a function is printed and how it is translated into Latex, as requested on [ask-sage](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/579/how-to-change-_latex_-of-log-to-ln).

I suggest, as a first step, to add methods `set_name()` and `set_latex_name()` that change the value of the cdefined attributes `_name` used for printing and `_latex_name` used for translation to latex. Then, the following would work:

```
sage: tan.set_name('tg')
sage: tan
tg
sage: tan.set_latex_name(r'\tg')
sage: latex(tan)
\tg
```

However, that can really only be the first step. Because, when I did so, I still got

```
sage: tan(x)
tan(x)
sage: latex(tan(x))
\tan\left(x\right)
```
Hence, in addition to that, the given latex name should be propagated to expressions.

Component: **symbolics**

Patch's up.

With it, this works

```
sage: tan.set_latex_name(r'\tg')
sage: latex(tan)
\tg
sage: tan.set_name('tg')
sage: tan
tg
```
but this doesn't

```
sage: tan(x)
tan(x)
sage: latex(tan(x))
\tan\left(x\right)
```

For reference for anyone implementing this correctly, in [this thread on sage-support](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-support/wkzIydg95k8), Burcin recommends 

```
It needs to go through the 
registry of functions stored in Pynac and update the name or the 
printing functions there.
