Please revert #9667, since PARI's hash_GEN hash's equal hermite normal forms to different values.  It does not have valid semantics for Python.   Alternatively, figure out what the bug is in hash_GEN.

This problem is very serious, because it leads to major mathematically incorrect problems/confusion, potentially all over the place, and is hard to track down.

For example, this caused #11611, and #11611 should be closed when this is done.

To this right will require a simple doctest illustrating the problem so this doesn't get broke again.  #11611 provides such a thing.

William, I have a patch for #11611.  The issue is not `hash_GEN()`, it is a problem with how integers are converted from Sage to PARI.  So I would close this ticket here as "invalid" unless you think there are further issues.

See #11854 for a follow-up (it turns out that #11611 does not fully fix the problem).
