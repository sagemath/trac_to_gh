```
The developer guide says:

```
To link together verbatim environments, use the .. link:: comment.
```
whereas the correct markup is `.. link` without `::`
same for `.. skip`

I also add a new markup `.. linkall` which doesn't split the various block anymore.

Sorry for my bad English and thanks for taking care of writing the regexp.  I
