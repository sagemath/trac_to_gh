The developer guide says:

```
To link together verbatim environments, use the .. link:: comment.
```
whereas the correct markup is `.. link` without `::`
same for `.. skip`

I also add a new markup `.. linkall` which doesn't split the various block anymore.

In more detail, replacing

```

```
by

```
    link_all = re.search(r'^\s*\.\.\s+linkall\s*$', F, re.M)
```
seems to work for me, and only catches ".. linkall" if it's on a line by itself, other than white space.

Sorry for my bad English and thanks for taking care of writing the regexp.  I
just submitted two new patches which should address your remarks.
