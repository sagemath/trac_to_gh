}
```
The developer guide says:

```
To link together verbatim environments, use the .. link:: comment.
```
whereas the correct markup is `.. link` without `::`
same for `.. skip`

I also add a new markup `.. linkall` which doesn't split the various block anymore.

Sorry for my bad English and thanks for taking care of writing the regexp.  I
just submitted two new patches which should address your remarks.

Here's a patch which modifies the wording in the developer's guide, plus it adds an example of using ".. linkall" (to a file in the tutorial).  Florent, I'm happy with your changes.  If you're okay with mine, you can give the whole ticket a positive review.
