In a remote notebook setup using ``server_pool``, all communication between the main Sage process and the workers goes through ``/tmp``.  I suggest to introduce an environment variable ``SAGENB_TMPDIR`` (with fallback to ``TMPDIR``) to configure this.

I have a succesful setup with one server node and two worker nodes using this, so it works.

shouldn't we use python's tempfile.gettempdir() as a fallback and never have hardcoded directories.

Also seems there are changes to the ulimit docs? Were they wrong?

Other than that the patch seems ok.

I'm concerned -- I think this would first time any environment variable is used to configure the notebook.   I think there is a much better and more standard way to implement this feature, which is unfortunately more work and requires knowing a lot more about how the notebook works.  However, it is better in the longrun, since it will be much less confusing to admins and easier to maintain. 
  
For the notebook, implementing the following would be much more natural:

```
   notebook(local_directory = '/path/you/want', ...)
```

This would involve modifying the notebook.py file by editing "new_worksheet_process" and run_notebook.py, etc.   Also, this new option would be part of the server configuration database (currently a pickle, but someday a SQL table), so it would automatically be something that can be edited graphically by the notebook admin from the notebook configuration settings webpage. 

So a big +1 to having this feature, but -1 to using environment variables in the longrun to implement it, since we already have a standard system for configuring the server, and it isn't via environment variables.  

Thoughts?

Well, using environment variables for temporary directories is not unusual, see the fairly standard use of `TPMDIR`.

On the other hand, you are right that it would be a new way to configure the notebook.  So my answer is "Yes, you are probably right but I'm not going to implement it".  I do think this is a very useful feature.

Unfortunately not yet fixed. 3 years ago William wrote in [comment:4] that my patch was no good. Given that there hasn't surfaced a better fix and given that I don't know much about the notebook, wouldn't it be possible to just apply my patch?

I have been using it in a production environment at my university and it hasn't broken anything.

I finally looked at this patch.  I really don't see how it can harm anything, though I will point out that on Macs at least this would mean a change of folder.

```
$ echo $TMPDIR

Can you make a branch upstream so I can review it?  I know you said somewhere that would make things easier for you, though I don't recall where...

Yes, but only when running a multi-user sagenb server using the `server_pool` option. Given that such a setup requires some non-trivial configuration anyway, I don't see this as a problem.
