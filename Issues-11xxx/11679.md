In a remote notebook setup using ``server_pool``, all communication between the main Sage process and the workers goes through ``/tmp``.  I suggest to introduce an environment variable ``SAGENB_TMPDIR`` (with fallback to ``TMPDIR``) to configure this.

I have a succesful setup with one server node and two worker nodes using this, so it works.

I think there is a much better and more standard way to implement this feature, which is unfortunately more work and requires knowing a lot more about how the notebook works.  However, it is better in the longrun, since it will be much less confusing to admins and easier to maintain. 
  
For the notebook, implementing the following would be much more natural:

```
   notebook(local_directory = '/path/you/want', ...)
```

This would involve modifying the notebook.py file by editing "new_worksheet_process" and run_notebook.py, etc.   Also, this new option would be part of the server configuration database (currently a pickle, but someday a SQL table), so it would automatically be something that can be edited graphically by the notebook admin from the notebook configuration settings webpage. 

So a big +1 to having this feature, but -1 to using environment variables in the longrun to implement it, since we already have a standard system for configuring the server, and it isn't via environment variables.  

Thoughts?

Well, using environment variables for temporary directories is not unusual, see the fairly standard use of `TPMDIR`.

On the other hand, you are right that it would be a new way to configure the notebook.  So my answer is "Yes, you are probably right but I'm not going to implement it".  I do think this is a very useful feature.

<a id='comment:16'></a>I wonder if the backup to `$TMPDIR` is okay...

```
$ stat $TMPDIR
234881026 42865026 drwx------ ...
$ stat /tmp
234881026 33176 lrwxr-xr-x ...
```
Would having fewer permissions cause problems for processes?  I know that is sort of the point, but I don't know what minimum permissions are needed.

By the way, you can just reference https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/issues/32 in said pull request.

Yes, but only when running a multi-user sagenb server using the `server_pool` option. Given that such a setup requires some non-trivial configuration anyway, I don't see this as a problem.
