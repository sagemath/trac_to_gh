This is bad:

```
    sage: atan2(0,0)
    0
    sage: atan2(0,0,hold=True)
    arctan2(0, 0)
    sage: atan2(0,0,hold=True).n()
    ValueError: arctan2(0,0) undefined
    sage: atan2(0,0,hold=True).simplify()
    -----------------------------------------------------
    TypeError: Error executing code in Maxima
    CODE:
    sage1 : atan2(0,0)$
    Maxima ERROR:
    
    atan2: atan2(0,0) is undefined.
     -- an error. To debug this try: debugmode(true);
```

Probably we should make sure that atan2(0,0) always raises an error.  Wolfram Alpha/Mathematica gives the interval from -pi to pi, which seems as good as any answer, and who knows what others do.

GiNaC probably got `atan2(0,0) -> 0` from Maple:

```
    |\^/|     Maple 12 (X86 64 LINUX)

> arctan(0,0);
                                       0
```

MMA prints an error like Maxima:

```
In[5]:= ArcTan[0,0]

ArcTan::indet: Indeterminate expression ArcTan[0, 0] encountered.

Out[5]= Interval[{-Pi, Pi}]
```

Titus points out that with Volker's patch, `arg(0)` in Sage also gives an error. All of MMA, Maple and Maxima evaluate that to 0 though.

Pynac 0.2.4 (#12950), includes the patch Volker mentioned in [comment:2](#comment:2). Attached to that ticket there is also a patch by Titus fixing failing doctests in symbolics related files and modifying the `arg()` function so that `arg(0)` still returns 0.

Apparently this change breaks some tests in 3d plotting. We should open a ticket with that and make this one depend on it. Titus, can you handle that?
