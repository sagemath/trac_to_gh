I asked about the Singular functions used here, in the Singular forum, post 2582 (https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=2582).  The answer (from "hannes") is quite clear:

```
p_Invers: is only a helper routine for the 3-argument forms of jet [...]
It should not be used otherwise: is a static routine in newer releases
Furthermore, the coefficients must be from a field.

p_IsUnit: is currently only used to simplify ideals,
and currently defined as: p is a constant polynomial and the constant is a unit.
I will try to extend that.....but it is of low priority.
```

So I think the specialized code in multi_polynomial_libsingular canniot be relied on, and we should stick with the generic code.  The Singular documentation offers no other functions that look useful here.

Indeed. So if Singular is that bad, remove the code. Do not put comments everywhere. You can keep a line or two of explanations

```
# Singular seems not able to invert non-constant polynomial.

It was not my point. My comment was about the two lines

```
    if v.parent() is not p.base_ring():
        raise NotImplementedError
```
This `NotImplementedError` does not appear in doctests.
