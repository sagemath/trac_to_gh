I asked about the Singular functions used here, in the Singular forum, post 2582 (https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=2582).  The answer (from "hannes") is quite clear:

```
p_Invers: is only a helper routine for the 3-argument forms of jet [...]
It should not be used otherwise: is a static routine in newer releases
Furthermore, the coefficients must be from a field.

p_IsUnit: is currently only used to simplify ideals,
and currently defined as: p is a constant polynomial and the constant is a unit.
I will try to extend that.....but it is of low priority.
```

So I think the specialized code in multi_polynomial_libsingular canniot be relied on, and we should stick with the generic code.  The Singular documentation offers no other functions that look useful here.

1) Because it is private, the function `_inverse_of_unit_polynomial` and its documentation will not appear in the reference manual. I would prefer to have it public and have pointers from the various methods (via `:func:XXX`) to this function. These are implementation details but which might be of importance for advanced users. The algorithm in only explained in the function.

2) Wouldn't be easy to fix the following?

```
sage: R(5).inverse_of_unit()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: <class 'sage.rings.polynomial.infinite_polynomial_element.InfinitePolynomial_sparse'>
has no attribute constant_coefficient
```

3) As far as I understand, singular call works in some cases. If this is the case, you would better keep it. You can easily make something like the following that is also done in other places in Sage

```
    def inverse_of_unit(self, algorithm=None):
        if algorithm is None:
             ... set algorithm to what is best ...

        if algorithm == 'singular':
             if self.base_ring().is_not_appropriate():
                 raise ValueError('does not work')
              ... singular imple ...
         elif algorithm == 'generic':
             ... what is provide in the branch ...
         else:
             raise ValueError('unknown algorithm %s' %algorithm)

Indeed. So if Singular is that bad, remove the code. Do not put comments everywhere. You can keep a line or two of explanations

```
# Singular seems not able to invert non-constant polynomial.

5) I do not see where the following error is tested

```
except AttributeError:
    v =  ~u # many rings don't implement inverse_of_unit
    if v.parent() is not p.base_ring():
        raise NotImplementedError
```

6) In order to avoid coercion, it would be better to define `mp1 = m + 1` and use it in the loop. In the same veine, change `while p*i != 1` to `while not (p * i).is_one()`

It was not my point. My comment was about the two lines

```
    if v.parent() is not p.base_ring():
        raise NotImplementedError
```
This `NotImplementedError` does not appear in doctests.
