Probably a good condition is if the domain is known to be an integral domain, then use the specialized code. You should also post a bug report to Singular if using this in general is expected to work (provided you can find such information).",

As I said, I would probably send it up to the generic case when the base ring is not something nice. Probably a good condition is if the domain is known to be an integral domain, then use the specialized code. You should also post a bug report to Singular if using this in general is expected to work (provided you can find such information).

I asked about the Singular functions used here, in the Singular forum, post 2582 (https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=2582).  The answer (from "hannes") is quite clear:

```
p_Invers: is only a helper routine for the 3-argument forms of jet [...]
It should not be used otherwise: is a static routine in newer releases
Furthermore, the coefficients must be from a field.

p_IsUnit: is currently only used to simplify ideals,
and currently defined as: p is a constant polynomial and the constant is a unit.
I will try to extend that.....but it is of low priority.
```

So I think the specialized code in multi_polynomial_libsingular canniot be relied on, and we should stick with the generic code.  The Singular documentation offers no other functions that look useful here.

```
sage: R.<x> = Zmod(32)[]
sage: inverse_of_unit_polynomial(1 + 4*x)
16*x^2 + 28*x + 1
sage: inverse_of_unit_polynomial(1 + 4*x) is R
True

5) I do not see where the following error is tested

```

It was not my point. My comment was about the two lines

```
    if v.parent() is not p.base_ring():
        raise NotImplementedError

This `NotImplementedError` does not appear in doctests.
