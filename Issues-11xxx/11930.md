Hyperelliptic curves are smooth curves mathematically. These patches add a check for this to the constructor and implement `is_singular` to always return `False`

Example

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(3))
sage: H=HyperellipticCurve(x^5+1)
sage: H.is_singular()
# used to return True, now returns False
sage: H.is_smooth()
# used to return False, now returns True
sage: HyperellipticCurve(x^5)
# used to return a curve y^2 = x^5, now raises an error
```

The cause is of course the computationally convenient, but mathematically inaccurate, ambient space. The curve is smooth and projective, but not in `P^2`:

```
sage: R.<x> = GF(3)[]
sage: H = HyperellipticCurve(x^5+1)
sage: H.ambient_space()
Projective Space of dimension 2 over Finite Field of size 3
```

There is a much faster way to get the same answer for fields of characteristic not 2:

```
sage: R.<x> = GF(3)[]
sage: H = HyperellipticCurve(x^5+1)
sage: timeit('H.is_singular()')
125 loops, best of 3: 5.14 ms per loop

Disagreement with Magma, there should still be some condition at infinity for this to be a nice hyperelliptic curve. We are now figuring out what that condition should be.

```
sage: P.<x> = GF(2)[]
sage: H = HyperellipticCurve(x^6+1, 1)
sage: H.is_singular()
False
sage: magma(H)
TypeError: Error evaluating Magma code.
Runtime error in 'HyperellipticCurve': Curve is singular at infinity
```

Also, it seems from the code in HyperellipticCurve that some partial check for singularity is performed there. Should that be a full check or no check at all?

Apply 11930_singular_hyperelliptic.patch and 11930_is_singular.patch

The first of these patches (written by Damiano and I) adds tests to the HyperellipticCurve constructor. It tests whether the input polynomials f(x) and h(x) really make sense. In other words, it checks if there is some g such that, when f and h are homogenized wrt x to degrees 2g+2 and g+1 respectively, one gets a smooth projective curve. We compared it with the independent implementation in Magma, and the test turns out to be equivalent to Magma's test for all input polynomials over GF(2) and GF(3) where deg(f) is 5 or 6 and deg(h) <= 3.

The second patch is Daniel's function, but with a simpler algorithm that uses the fact that only smooth curves are constructed.

To check whether a polynomial has repeated roots, this patch uses both GCDs and resultants. It tries the GCD first, because that is fastest. If that fails, it tries the resultant.

The reason for needing both gcds and resultants is actually quite funny: Qp has no gcd currently implemented in Sage, while extensions of Qp have no resultants in Sage!

With 4.8.alpha4, I get

```
sage: P.<x> = Qp(5,7)[]
sage: x.gcd(x)
# AttributeError: 'Polynomial_padic_capped_relative_dense' object has no attribute 'gcd'
sage: x.resultant(x)
# 0
sage: K.<a> = Qp(5,7).extension(x^2-5)
sage: P.<x> = K[]
sage: x.gcd(x)
# (1 + O(a^14))*x
sage: x.resultant(x)
# TypeError: no conversion of this ring to a Singular ring defined
```

I'm not happy with this:

 	51	    .. NOTE::

Hi David,

This "NOTE" is just a warning that we added about the code as it was. It is not about a change that we are making. We decided to leave support for conics and elliptic curves intact, as people may be running a loop over general double covers, or not care too much.

Removing support for conics and elliptic curves would be something for a discussion on sage-nt, and then a new ticket. I can remove this note if you'd like, and leave the rest of the patch as it is. Would that be an improvement?

Marco

I tested this on Sage 4.8.

There is a method is_smooth() which can be applied to a hyperelliptic curve. With the patches applied:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(3))
sage: H=HyperellipticCurve(x^5+1)
sage: H.is_singular()
False
sage: H.is_smooth()
False
```

Maybe these two methods should give consistent results. The is_smooth() method seems to be defined in the class AlgebraicScheme_subscheme_projective in algebraic_scheme.py.

These patches look good. I'll be back in a few days after having looked a bit more on the details.

In the meantime, here is a question/issue: when I apply 11930c.patch using Sage 5.0 (on OS X lion 10.7.3) I get the following:

`patching file sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_finite_field.py`\\
`Hunk #8 succeeded at 653 with fuzz 1 (offset 95 lines).`

I'm not sure what this means or how to get rid off the fuzz.

When applying the patch, mercurial will look for a certain block of code and replace it by another. The code to look for also has three surrounding unchanged lines on each side. Fuzz means that there is a slight mismatch in the surrounding code, due to changes in Sage between after I wrote the patch. More precisely, fuzz n means that a block can only be matched if the outermost n lines of the surrounding code are ignored. I've seen patches be rejected because of fuzz 2, but I think fuzz 1 is fine: there are still 2 lines unchanged around every patched line.

In this particular case, it means that a doctest nearby one of the changed doctests in hyperelliptic_finite_field.py has changed since I wrote the patch.

To get rid of the fuzz, the patch can be rebased (apply to latest version, then qrefresh and export), but I don't think it is necessary with fuzz 1.

I have a recurring doc-test failure (Sage 5.0 on Mac OS lion) so I can't really doc-test these patches locally without failures. But I interpret what the patch-bot has done on this ticket as sufficient for a positive review as far as doc-testing goes (it seems that all tests pass). Sounds reasonable?

The patch-bot's blue blob and the "plug-in failed" I believe is only about trailing white space, and therefore harmless. Sounds reasonable?

I'm not sure whether just using the patchbot is ok. According to the [developer's guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#reviewing-a-patch), you are supposed to run the tests marked "#long" as well, and I don't see where the patchbot does this.

As for your failing tests, any tests that fail on an unpatched Sage can be safely ignored, they are not due to the patch.

In this particular case, it is ok.

In detail: it seems that many people are very annoyed by trailing whitespaces on non-empty lines (see [here](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/f6a783b3a52bfa5d/30809dba7cfb13dd)), hence don't want any new ones to be introduced.

All tests pass except one which fails on an unaltered Sage 5.0 (on OS X 10.7.3). 

The failure was with "rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx" and the tests are not flagged # long time and so are covered by the tests run by the patchbot on this ticket.

This all looks good. If the other reviewers agree, we can change the status to positive review.

I only have two small comments on the patches:

About the example beginning with "A hyperelliptic curve should not be given by polynomials of degree greater than `2g+2`, where `g` is the genus." I'm not sure I understand what this means. The genus of what? It is slightly unclear since I gather that in this example there is no hyperelliptic curve whose genus we could be referring to. Is it the genus of the desingularization of the corresponding plane curve? The way I view this, the equation `y^2+hy=f`, where `h=x^100` and `f=x<sup>6+1-h</sup>2/4` (appropriately homogenized with `z`) defines a curve in weighted projected space `P(1,100,1)` but that curve is singular at the point `(x,y,z)=(1,-1/2,0)`.

About the example beginning "Input with integer coefficients creates objects with the integers as base ring, but only checks smoothness over `QQ`, not `ZZ`". Is this to be interpreted as saying that the example provided is not smooth as a scheme over `Spec(ZZ)`?
