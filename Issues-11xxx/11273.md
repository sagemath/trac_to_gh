This is a major upgrade of the riemann module. Features are:

Fixes and expansions to the docs, covering the issues in #10945.

I've added some test methods that compute the explicit map of an ellipse to a high degree of accuracy. The doctests for these methods contain tests that show that the numerical Riemann_Map values remain accurate. The precision of the normal doctests has been reduced accordingly, so hopefully they will no longer fail for different architectures/numpy versions. This covers #10957

The exterior Riemann map can now be computed, that is a conformal mapping of the exterior of a region to the exterior of the unit circle. The docs specify how this may be done.

I've added support for computing the spiderweb plot for multiply connected domains. This uses a different method than the simply connected spiderweb and is takes about the same time as a color plot of the same resolution. (It's worth noting that I don't think this has ever been done before.)

I've also fiddled around under the hood, cleaning up some code, moving things around for more efficiency and trying to add a few more helpful inline comments.

Because of the complexity of these changes, I decided I didn't want to deal with separating each batch out into its own patch. Hopefully that is acceptable.

As a result, this ticket should replace #10945 (some of the other issues there have already been addressed, this just hits the documentation) and #10957. Is there a good way to go about doing that?

Also, as a side note, let me know if there are any places where you would like to see more documentation or tests.

We should close those tickets as duplicates of this one. 

The patch looks good to me. There are a few minor formatting issues:

* lines should be <= 80 characters. The patch contains some lines with very aggressive wrapping, such as
 {{{
          q_vector = 1 / ( 
	                self.pre_q_vector - pt1) 
 }}}
 and some with almost none.
* There should be an empty line in the documentation after `::` to start a code block.
* I would appreciate it if there were more comments in the code to explain what it's doing, but this is not a requirement.
* attachment:trac-11273-riemann-upgrade-part2.patch cuts down the precision required in the doctests to 5 digits in some places. Is this code really so unstable? Would it help to use other functions for numeric approximation, other than those defined in python's `math` module?

I am leaving this as `needs_review` since I don't consider this a full review. Somebody more familiar with this code should comment on the changes and check if this ticket does indeed replace #10945 and #10957.

<a id='comment:3'></a>A few other comments.  

First, ones to make sure it replaces #10945.

* Presumably the redefinition of `I` is supposed to demonstrate it works with lots of different complex types.  I suggest the following.

```
        Can work for different types of complex numbers::

            sage: m = Riemann_Map([lambda t: e^(I*t) - 0.5*e^(-I*t)], [lambda t: I*e^(I*t) + 0.5*I*e^(-I*t)], 0)  # long time (4 sec)
            sage: m.riemann_map(0.25 + sqrt(-0.5))  # long time
            (0.137514137885...+0.876696023004...j)
+            sage: I = CDF.gen()  # long time
            sage: m.riemann_map(1.3*I)  # long time
            (-1.561029396...+0.989694535737...j)
-            sage: I = CDF.gen()  # long time
            sage: m.riemann_map(0.4)  # long time
```
* From #8867: "It now properly avoids failing with lambda functions, although it doesn't work optimally for them. I'll add some notes on that in #10945."

Then a few other comments.
* Incorrect indentation in the last couple functions (in addition to the empty lines Burcin mentioned).
* Some math things could be put in single backticks, like 2*pi.
* Commit messages should have the Trac ticket number in them, like ''Trac 11273, major additions"
* Commit message should have a short first line, then the rest of the information.

Hope to later do a better review of the content, which I think I will be able to do.  This does need some work due to all these formatting etc. issues, though.

<a id='comment:8'></a>Apologies. I posted the wrong bit of text above.

I am starting from a clean 4.7.2. First I apply the patch for ticket #11028.

```
sage: hg_sage.apply("trac-11028-modular-complex-plot.2.3.patch")
cd "/home/ethan/sage/devel/sage" && hg import   "/home/ethan/sage/trac-11028-modular-complex-plot.2.3.patch"
applying /home/ethan/sage/trac-11028-modular-complex-plot.2.3.patch
```

The patch applies correctly, and the tests run properly. 

I then try to apply the first patch from this ticket and get the following result:

```
sage: hg_sage.apply("trac-11273-riemann-upgrade-part1.patch")   
cd "/home/ethan/sage/devel/sage" && hg import   "/home/ethan/sage/trac-11273-riemann-upgrade-part1.patch"

I could not figure out from the .rej file why the patch is failing. There seem to be no incompatibilities in the significant hunks.

Current status is having rebased and fixed a few minor things along the way.

Need to:
* Actually review the substantive changes, though these look good at first

<a id='comment:11'></a>Okay, Ethan, here come the questions!  Notice I'm still in the middle of reviewing, so I intend to fix a lot of little things yet in followup patches.

* You say

```
The following inputs must all be passed in as named parameters:
```
  but they don't, since they already are named, not `**kwds` (I even tried).  Are you thinking of putting in extra arguments later or something?  You say something similar with the `int` argument in `get_theta_points`.
* There is a problem with the non-simply-connected plots.   Not a big one!  But for some reason they don't add properly - maybe you put them in the wrong zorder.  Check out these two.

```
        sage: f(t) = e^(I*t)
        sage: fprime(t) = I*e^(I*t)
        sage: hf(t) = 0.5*e^(-I*t)
        sage: hfprime(t) = 0.5*-I*e^(-I*t)
        sage: m = Riemann_Map([f, hf], [fprime, hfprime], 0.5 + 0.5*I)
        sage: m.plot_colored() + m.plot_spiderweb()  # long time
        sage: m.plot_spiderweb()+m.plot_colored()
```
  I have a feeling this is because of the direct use of a `ComplexPlot` in the "more difficult multiply connected" branch of the `plot_spiderweb`, when you already are using a `ComplexPlot` in the `plot_colored`, but I'm not sure exactly how this happens, and would rather not track it down.

Updated these descriptions to say "may be passed in". Technically the name isn't required, but it seems helpful to advise it for users less familiar with sage arguments.

Good catch. The plots don't add because they are both image type plots, rather than the line plot in the simply connected spiderweb case. To get a color+spiderweb plot you need to use the "withcolor=True" flag. I've updated the docs and doctests to accurately reflect this.

Added the appropriate doctests. Spiderweb plots don't work for exterior maps and are now checked for appropriately.

> * Why the difference in the initialization between `self.exterior` and `exterior`?  Sometimes you use one, sometimes the other, and it's confusing.


Fixed.

> * In general a few of the things for `exterior` are a little confusing.  For instance, `pre_q_vect.r` seems to be generated in the same way for both `exterior=True` and `False`, whereas nearly everything else is inverted through the origin.


Note the pre_q_vector is basically just a portion of self.cps which *is* adjusted for exterior,

I'm going to pass on this for now. I've tried to catch the less obvious gotchas, but testing all combinations of bad parameters seems like overkill.

Clarified. Let me know if it's still unclear.

I'm not sure what you mean by examples showing *how* it works.

This would help me check whether this is really doing the right thing, though I didn't really have any doubts, given the great pictures!

Done.

This meant that those portions were escaping the normal check to not draw external lines.

I've made the cutoff a parameter (min_mag) so that the user can make it higher if they're observing lines outside the domain. The only trade-off is that the lines will stop slightly farther from the "centers" of the domain. There is a doctest illustrating the increased cutoff.

At the request of the reviewer in correspondence, I've also added a fun example to the top level doctests.
