This is a major upgrade of the riemann module. Features are:

Fixes and expansions to the docs, covering the issues in #10945.

I've added some test methods that compute the explicit map of an ellipse to a high degree of accuracy. The doctests for these methods contain tests that show that the numerical Riemann_Map values remain accurate. The precision of the normal doctests has been reduced accordingly, so hopefully they will no longer fail for different architectures/numpy versions. This covers #10957

The exterior Riemann map can now be computed, that is a conformal mapping of the exterior of a region to the exterior of the unit circle. The docs specify how this may be done.

I've added support for computing the spiderweb plot for multiply connected domains. This uses a different method than the simply connected spiderweb and is takes about the same time as a color plot of the same resolution. (It's worth noting that I don't think this has ever been done before.)

I've also fiddled around under the hood, cleaning up some code, moving things around for more efficiency and trying to add a few more helpful inline comments.

Because of the complexity of these changes, I decided I didn't want to deal with separating each batch out into its own patch. Hopefully that is acceptable.

As a result, this ticket should replace #10945 (some of the other issues there have already been addressed, this just hits the documentation) and #10957. Is there a good way to go about doing that?

Also, as a side note, let me know if there are any places where you would like to see more documentation or tests.

Replying to [evanandel](#comment%3A1):

We should close those tickets as duplicates of this one. 

The patch looks good to me. There are a few minor formatting issues:

* lines should be <= 80 characters. The patch contains some lines with very aggressive wrapping, such as

 ```
          q_vector = 1 / ( 
	                self.pre_q_vector - pt1) 
 ```
 and some with almost none.
* There should be an empty line in the documentation after `::` to start a code block.
* I would appreciate it if there were more comments in the code to explain what it's doing, but this is not a requirement.
* [attachment:trac-11273-riemann-upgrade-part2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11273/trac-11273-riemann-upgrade-part2.patch) cuts down the precision required in the doctests to 5 digits in some places. Is this code really so unstable? Would it help to use other functions for numeric approximation, other than those defined in python's `math` module?

I am leaving this as `needs_review` since I don't consider this a full review. Somebody more familiar with this code should comment on the changes and check if this ticket does indeed replace #10945 and #10957.

A few other comments.  

First, ones to make sure it replaces #10945.

* Presumably the redefinition of `I` is supposed to demonstrate it works with lots of different complex types.  I suggest the following.

```
        Can work for different types of complex numbers::

            sage: m = Riemann_Map([lambda t: e^(I*t) - 0.5*e^(-I*t)], [lambda t: I*e^(I*t) + 0.5*I*e^(-I*t)], 0)  # long time (4 sec)
            sage: m.riemann_map(0.25 + sqrt(-0.5))  # long time
            (0.137514137885...+0.876696023004...j)
+            sage: I = CDF.gen()  # long time
            sage: m.riemann_map(1.3*I)  # long time
            (-1.561029396...+0.989694535737...j)
-            sage: I = CDF.gen()  # long time
            sage: m.riemann_map(0.4)  # long time
```
* From #8867: "It now properly avoids failing with lambda functions, although it doesn't work optimally for them. I'll add some notes on that in #10945."

Then a few other comments.
* Incorrect indentation in the last couple functions (in addition to the empty lines Burcin mentioned).
* Some math things could be put in single backticks, like 2*pi.
* Commit messages should have the Trac ticket number in them, like ''Trac 11273, major additions"
* Commit message should have a short first line, then the rest of the information.

---
Hope to later do a better review of the content, which I think I will be able to do.  This does need some work due to all these formatting etc. issues, though.

Therefore it seemed appropriate to try and match the tests to that precision so that if future tweaks change the results--maybe even making them more precise--that won't cause the tests to fail unnecessarily.

No need to rebase or something like that, that would be silly when this is so easy to fix.

As to review thus far, I have no problem with patch 2 as long as it passes tests, and patch 3 is clearly fine except for the issues mentioned above, which should be fixed.

So now I just need to make sure that the overhaul and new stuff in patch 1 is right :) Though I trust it is. I'm looking forward to this being in and at this level, even if I don't get to teach complex analysis for a while.

Apologies. I posted the wrong bit of text above.

I am starting from a clean 4.7.2. First I apply the patch for ticket #11028.

```
sage: hg_sage.apply("trac-11028-modular-complex-plot.2.3.patch")
cd "/home/ethan/sage/devel/sage" && hg import   "/home/ethan/sage/trac-11028-modular-complex-plot.2.3.patch"
applying /home/ethan/sage/trac-11028-modular-complex-plot.2.3.patch
```

The patch applies correctly, and the tests run properly. 

I then try to apply the first patch from this ticket and get the following result:

```
sage: hg_sage.apply("trac-11273-riemann-upgrade-part1.patch")   
cd "/home/ethan/sage/devel/sage" && hg import   "/home/ethan/sage/trac-11273-riemann-upgrade-part1.patch"
applying /home/ethan/sage/trac-11273-riemann-upgrade-part1.patch

Hunk #29 FAILED at 1051
3 out of 30 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/calculus/riemann.pyx.rej
abort: patch failed to apply
```

I could not figure out from the .rej file why the patch is failing. There seem to be no incompatibilities in the significant hunks.

Current status is having rebased and fixed a few minor things along the way.

Need to:
* Actually review the substantive changes, though these look good at first
* Remove a lot of whitespace

Okay, Ethan, here come the questions!  Notice I'm still in the middle of reviewing, so I intend to fix a lot of little things yet in followup patches.

* You say

```
The following inputs must all be passed in as named parameters:
```
  but they don't, since they already are named, not `**kwds` (I even tried).  Are you thinking of putting in extra arguments later or something?  You say something similar with the `int` argument in `get_theta_points`.
* There is a problem with the non-simply-connected plots.   Not a big one!  But for some reason they don't add properly - maybe you put them in the wrong zorder.  Check out these two.

```
        sage: f(t) = e^(I*t)
        sage: fprime(t) = I*e^(I*t)
        sage: hf(t) = 0.5*e^(-I*t)
        sage: hfprime(t) = 0.5*-I*e^(-I*t)
        sage: m = Riemann_Map([f, hf], [fprime, hfprime], 0.5 + 0.5*I)
        sage: m.plot_colored() + m.plot_spiderweb()  # long time
        sage: m.plot_spiderweb()+m.plot_colored()
```
  I have a feeling this is because of the direct use of a `ComplexPlot` in the "more difficult multiply connected" branch of the `plot_spiderweb`, when you already are using a `ComplexPlot` in the `plot_colored`, but I'm not sure exactly how this happens, and would rather not track it down.

More.  This first one makes it "needs work".  Best to just add another patch after my reviewer patch, which is coming after I finish reviewing.
* I see no doctest for the new `exterior` keyword.  This is important new functionality, so we need it.  I would add it myself, but

```
sage: f(t) = e^(I*t)
sage: fprime(t) = I*e^(I*t)
sage: m = Riemann_Map([f], [fprime], 0)  # long time (4 sec)
sage: m.plo
m.plot_boundaries  m.plot_colored     m.plot_spiderweb   
sage: m.plot_spiderweb()+m.plot_colored()  # looks good
sage: m = Riemann_Map([f], [fprime], 0, exterior=True)  # long time (4 sec)
sage: m.plot_spiderweb()+m.plot_colored()  # looks weird
```
  has a small colored square around a *black* interior regions, but long long spiderweb, and I'm not sure this is intentional.  The same thing happens for other ones made exterior.  Also, testing the `ValueError` raised would be good.

* You are a little inconsistent in use of your 'global'-ish names like `COMPLEX` - sometimes you use it, sometimes you don't.
* This was a little hard to understand.

```
#b/c the function is analytic, we know it's abs(derivative) is equal in all directions 
```
  It's not clear exactly what this means, as the derivative of a complex-valued function is a complex number.  And partial derivatives don't have to be the same in all directions.  I feel like I almost get it, but a little clarification of what you meant by this would be helpful.

Updated these descriptions to say "may be passed in". Technically the name isn't required, but it seems helpful to advise it for users less familiar with sage arguments.

Good catch. The plots don't add because they are both image type plots, rather than the line plot in the simply connected spiderweb case. To get a color+spiderweb plot you need to use the "withcolor=True" flag. I've updated the docs and doctests to accurately reflect this.

Added the appropriate doctests. Spiderweb plots don't work for exterior maps and are now checked for appropriately.

> * Why the difference in the initialization between `self.exterior` and `exterior`?  Sometimes you use one, sometimes the other, and it's confusing.


Fixed.

Note the pre_q_vector is basically just a portion of self.cps which *is* adjusted for exterior,

I'm going to pass on this for now. I've tried to catch the less obvious gotchas, but testing all combinations of bad parameters seems like overkill.

Clarified. Let me know if it's still unclear.

I'm not sure what you mean by examples showing *how* it works.

> * This is probably too much to ask... would it be possible to have the last three functions (for testing the ellipse example) take epsilon as a parameter instead of just .3?  This would help me check whether this is really doing the right thing, though I didn't really have any doubts, given the great pictures!

Done.

Done. Let me know if you didn't get the email.

These failures aren't new, but it would be good to fix them.

I will probably make this a friendly revision to the reviewer patch.

Well, there's at least *one* example with a lambda function, so let's let that pass...

In general, I'm happy here.  I still find this very interesting and useful.

Just one thing; I took an example from the paper and did some stuff.

```
ps = polygon_spline([(-4,-2),(4,-2),(4,2),(-4,2)])
z1 = lambda t: ps.value(t); z1p = lambda t: ps.derivative(t)
z2(t) = -2+exp(-I*t); z2p(t) = -I*exp(-I*t)
z3(t) = 2+exp(-I*t); z3p(t) = -I*exp(-I*t)
m = Riemann_Map([z1,z2,z3],[z1p,z2p,z3p],0,ncorners=4)
p = m.plot_spiderweb(withcolor=True,plot_points=500)
show(p,axes=false)
```
This one has some of the issues mentioned in the thesis in terms of some weirdness of the spiderweb (in particular, that all the correct stuff is there, but some additional webs as well).  I've sent the author an email - perhaps we will want to ask people to not use it with domains *too* far from being simply connected.

It seems that for some domains, particularly those with corners, the numerical integration outside the corners is bad enough to cause "bleed" so that the value outside the domain is farther from zero than desirable. This meant that those portions were escaping the normal check to not draw external lines.

I've made the cutoff a parameter (min_mag) so that the user can make it higher if they're observing lines outside the domain. The only trade-off is that the lines will stop slightly farther from the "centers" of the domain. There is a doctest illustrating the increased cutoff.

At the request of the reviewer in correspondence, I've also added a fun example to the top level doctests.
