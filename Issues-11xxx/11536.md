The documentation for TransitiveGroups is misleading.

```

       Warning: TransitiveGroups requires the optional GAP database
       package. Please install it with ``sage -i database_gap``.
    
       EXAMPLES:
    
          sage: TransitiveGroups(3)
          Transitive Groups of degree 3
          sage: TransitiveGroups(7)
          Transitive Groups of degree 7
          sage: TransitiveGroups(8)
          Transitive Groups of degree 8
```
Note these are not marked `# optional`.  The only one which is is one for degree 31!  

Further, the warning is buried by the error.

```

sage: TransitiveGroups(3)
Transitive Groups of degree 3
sage: for g in TransitiveGroups(3):
....:     g
....:     
verbose 0 (1182: permgroup_named.py, cardinality) Warning: TransitiveGroups requires the GAP database package. Please install it with ``sage -i database_gap``.
  1175             [Transitive group number 1 of degree 5, Transitive group number 2 of degree 5, Transitive group number 3 of degree 5, Transitive group number 4 of degree 5, Transitive group number 5 of degree 5]
   1176         """

   1178             yield self[n]
   1179 

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'
```
I'm not suggesting we change the behavior of `TransitiveGroups(3)`, since one can install the database from within an active Sage session.  But the errors need to be better, or the doc needs to make it clearer what will happen when you do it without the database (hard to test for *not* having an optional package, I know), or both.  Take your pick!

<a id='comment:5'>Comment 5:</a>
Is this ticket no longer relevant?

According to the current documentation (version 9.0), the optional GAP database does not seem necessary: http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/groups/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.html

The error shown in the ticket description also does not occur in sage 9.0

```
sage: for g in TransitiveGroups(3):
....:     g
....:     
Transitive group number 1 of degree 3
Transitive group number 2 of degree 3

```

An older version of docs found on another website seems to have it though:
https://www.math.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/~sorger/chow/html/en/reference/groups/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.html

Can this ticket be closed?
