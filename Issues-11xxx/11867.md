The next version of Singular does some major refactoring, in particular splits off polynomial handling into libpolys and introduces the coeffs struct that holds the coefficient ring (base ring) information just like the ring struct holds the information about polys.

The upstream source is developed here: https://github.com/Singular/Sources

Updated spkg: http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/singular-3-9-9.spkg (from September 2011)

WARNING: This is not working yet, major breakage in the Sage library needs to be fixed.

Hello,

in the meantime the fourth patch of Singular release 4.0 is available at 
http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/ftp/pub/Math/Singular/SOURCES/4-0-0/

Among the refactoring it contains a lot of bugfixes (and likely some new bugs)
