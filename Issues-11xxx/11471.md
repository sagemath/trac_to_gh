The Sageâ€“Maxima interface currently does not maintain precision:

```
sage: a = RealField(200)(8.987551787368175506591796875e9)
sage: a
8.9875517873681755065917968750000000000000000000000000000000e9
sage: var('y')
y
sage: b = (a * x).mul(y, hold=True)
sage: b
(8.9875517873681755065917968750000000000000000000000000000000e9*x)*y
sage: c = (b / (x * y)).simplify()
sage: c
8987551787.37
sage: RealField(200)(c)
8.9875517873681697845458984375000000000000000000000000000000e9

There are a couple of issues for this.  The first is converting to Maxima which is currently 

```
sage: a._maxima_init_()
'8.9875517873681755065917968750000000000000000000000000000000000e9'
```

should be done with something like:
calculus.symbolic_expression_from_string

```
sage: a._maxima_init_()
'8.987551787368175506591796875b9,fpprec:200'
```

Then, there is an issue going from Maxima to Sage.  In `sage.calculus.calculus.calculus.symbolic_expression_from_string`, `sage.rings.real_mpfr.create_RealNumber`, but does not pass it any precision.  This should try and detect the precision of the bigfloat.
