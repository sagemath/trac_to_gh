It seems that magma mode in the 4.7 notebook is broken. I observed the following session after verifying John Cremona's report about syncing problems. I suspect sync is lost due to the multiple commands. Note that none of the print commands seem to get executed (no output is observed) and that for "print 7;" the line "print 6;" gets echoed (this has probably very little to do with the "print 7;" command itself)

```
a:=1;
b:=2;

I guess it could be caused by its fix ... The cells there execute without problem for me in 4.7 and those cells do contain multiple commands that do not produce output. It seems that the input (in one cell)

```
a:=1;
b:=2;
```
reliably knocks the interface out of sync. So probably if someone who know how these interfaces work, looks at the strings that are passed back and forth, it will become apparent quite quickly.

I don't think the problem is confined to the notebook either. I observed:

```
sage: magma.execute("""
....: a:=1;
....: b:=2;
....: """)
'b:=2;'
sage: magma.execute("print 3;")
''
```

Because the example without newlines runs OK both with and without the fix of #9705, so the test is not verifying any change in behaviour. The problem described in #9705 arose when one magma statement was spread over multiple lines and one line was passed over stdin and another line via a "load" command. Without newlines, such splits wouldn't occur anyway.

If people can't find a fix for the "\n" in the tests, I guess we could write it in the following way:

```
sage: import commands
sage: newline=commands.getoutput("echo; echo")
sage: command=(
        "_<x>:=PolynomialRing(Rationals());"+newline+
        "repeat"+newline+
        "  g:=3*b*x^4+18*c*x^3-6*b^2*x^2-6*b*c*x-b^3-9*c^2 where b:=Random([-10..10]) where c:=Random([-10..10]);"+newline+
        "until Roots(g) ne [];")
sage: magma.eval(command)
```
