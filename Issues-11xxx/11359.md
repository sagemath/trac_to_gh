Keywords: ecl hardcoded paths

CPPFLAGS are recorded by ECL for future use as default values for `c::*cc-flags*`. But we want Sage to be relocate-able, so no build paths should be hardcoded. 

This ticket proposes various changes to the ECL spkg-install that may work.

See also #11348 and  this sage-devel thread.

One problem (perhaps the only one?) is that ECL uses the C compiler for compiling lisp (much like cython) and gives it include paths and library paths that it found out upon configuration. `local/bin/sage-location` is obviously not updating those. Example in a relocated "sage -ecl":

```
(defun f (x y) (+ x y))
(compile 'f) ;; fails
(setf c::*ecl-include-directory* (concatenate 'string (SI:GETENV "SAGE_ROOT") "/local/include/"))
(setf c::*ecl-library-directory* (concatenate 'string (SI:GETENV "SAGE_ROOT") "/local/lib/"))
(compile 'f) ;; now it works
```
There is a slight problem that the paths also end up in other variables (perhaps because of the way that sage calls configure when configuring ECL?):

```
> c::*cc-flags*

" -I/usr/local/sage/4.6.2-copy/local/include -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -g -O2  -fPIC  -Dlinux"
> c::*ld-flags*

" -L/usr/local/sage/4.6.2-copy/local/lib  -lecl  -lgmp -lgc -ldl  -lm "
```
Since it is a bit unsanitary to have references to old locations lying around (one might link to wrong versions of libraries if the old location still exists!), we should probably strip those variables as well.

Possible solutions:
- Patch ECL so that the above code is used to initialize these variables
- Wrap our invocation of ECL so that we always update the values of these variables
- equip `local/bin/sage-location` with the logic to update the relevant parts of ECL. That probably means recompiling (part of) ECL, because these values will be stored as a string in a ".fas"-file somewhere, which essentially a ".so".

Confirmed! This seems to be indeed the only problem. I did the following in `local/bin`

```
$ mv ecl ecl.bin
$ cat <<<EOF >ecl
#!/bin/sh
exec ecl.bin \
  -eval '(setf c::*ecl-include-directory* (concatenate '"'"'string (SI:GETENV "SAGE_ROOT") "/local/include/"))'\
  -eval '(setf c::*ecl-library-directory* (concatenate '"'"'string (SI:GETENV "SAGE_ROOT") "/local/lib/"))' \
  "$@"
EOF
$ chmod a+x ecl
```
after which rebuilding maxima succeeds in a relocated position.

Note that this piece of code does not scrub c::*cc-flags* or c::*ld-flags* yet.

The definitions for the default values of these variables seem to live in
spkg/build/ecl-*/src/src/cmp/cmpdefs.lsp
so that is probably what we need to patch.

so no paths in the flags variables anymore! That just leaves figuring out where best to change the values of the *ecl-...-directory* variables.

The following two fixes resolve the issues

## Cleaning paths from *..-flags* variables

In `<ECL-PACKAGE>/spkg-install` replace the lines

```
CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -I$SAGE_LOCAL/include"
LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L$SAGE_LOCAL/lib"
```
by

```
C_INCLUDE_PATH="$SAGE_LOCAL/include"
export C_INCLUDE_PATH
```
(web documentation indicates that Sun Studio and IBM compilers also support this variable, so although it's not POSIX (neither is CPPFLAGS), it doesn't seem to be GNU exclusive.)

## Making initialization of *ecl-...-directory* variables runtime

Patch `<ECL-PACKAGE>/src/src/cmp/cmpdefs.lsp` such that the lines

```
(defvar *ecl-include-directory* @includedir\@)
(defvar *ecl-library-directory* @libdir\@)
```
are replaced by

```

;;;   ".../local/lib/"  and  ".../local/include/"  in the above example.
;;; Since this substitution happens at runtime, these values get adjusted appropriately if
;;; the ".../local" tree gets relocated.
(defvar *ecl-include-directory* (namestring (make-pathname :directory (append (butlast (pathname-directory (translate-logical-pathname "SYS:")) 2) '("include")))))
(defvar *ecl-library-directory* (namestring (make-pathname :directory (append (butlast (pathname-directory (translate-logical-pathname "SYS:")) 2) '("lib")))))

Yes, that **and** patch ECL.

> and the relocation script


No changes to relocation script required. The patch to ECL means that the default values for the `*ecl-...-library*` variables are derived from a quantity that is already aware of ECL's runtime location.

So both changes are necessary and both are to the ecl spkg and both take effect at ECL build-time (well, the patch of course also changes ECL's runtime behaviour. Since a large part of building ECL consists of ECL compiling itself, the two overlap)

## Avoiding patching ECL in a future release

The development version of ECL has two configuration options that will allow avoiding patching ECL in the future. We'll be able to make a file `/path/to/sage.lsp`:

```
(in-package "SI")
(defun customized-boot ()
   (defparameter *ecl-include-directory* ...)
   (si::top-level t))
```
and then add the following options to ECL's configure:

```
--with-extra-files="/path/to/sage.lsp"
--with-init-form='(si::customized-boot)'
```
This option is not available in 11.1.1 yet.

Should we delay making a new spkg until it is released or do you think
we should still do it now with a note to check ecl at the next rev-bump?

I didn't check, but I assume these paths are still hardcoded and hence not adjusted by relocation.

We'd be better off letting the environment be so that these things are found automatically, e.g. via setting the appropriate link paths (already done) and include search paths (for instance via `C_INCLUDE_PATH`).

Failing that, we need to patch ECL so that these paths get set relative to `$SAGE_ROOT`, evaluated at ecl invokation time rather than during ecl package build.

As explained above, we can now also avoid patching sage and instead configure sage to include our own customized ecl boot routine to set up the environment with the appropriate path information during ecl invokation.

For the record:  In contrast to `C_INCLUDE_PATH` etc., `CPPFLAGS` (and `CFLAGS` etc.) are **never** read by the compiler / preprocessor;  their names are just *conventions* used in **Makefiles** (and `make`'s default rules).

It's pretty clear how you can make it fail:

- move sage to another location
- put a bogus file `<ORIGINAL>/local/include/ecl/config.h` (or whatever headers are required) in the old location

Fair enough, if you **intentionally want to break it** by providing a bogus `<ORIGINAL>/local/include/ecl/config.h`, you can.  But my spkg fixes the problem for people who don't intentionally break their setup.
