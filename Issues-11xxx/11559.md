```
To my surprise, computing the Chow group spends most of the time comparing cones instead of doing linear algebra. 3/4 of the time is spent in `PosetElement.__eq__()`:

```
   return self.parent() == other.parent() \
          and self.element == other.element \
          and self.vertex == other.vertex
```
Reordering this to first compare `self.vertex == other.vertex` speeds it up dramatically.

Patch has some other fixes. Changes the Chow group to use sparse matrices.

Can you clarify why `hermit_form` was replaced with `echelon_form`?

Also I don't like the very last change with forceful passing of `check=False` to the parent constructor. I think the correct way is to always pass whatever was received from the user and if it leads to a slowdown somewhere, then in that somewhere one should use `check=False`.

I took a look at this earlier, so I'll add my 2 cents worth.

`hermite_form` is a straight replacement for `echelon_form`.  Now that we have a `rref` command to obtain results over fields, I personally think it would be nice if "hermite form" went away, I think it confuses too many non-specialists.

I was going to vouch for the posets and linear algebra, but I don't know the Chow group stuff, so it is good that Andrey is on this one.

I agree that parents should be unique. The original code compared parents with `==` and I didn't change it.

My point is that the `PosetElement.element` comparison is potentially slow. In fact, I don't understand why `PosetElement.__eq__` compares both `vertex` and `element`, I am under the impression that there is a bijection between vertices and elements. 

The reordering does break comparison between `PosetElement`s and other classes, though I'm not sure if we care. The patch does conflict with #10998, so that one needs to be reviewed first.

If you do not want to check the parent first, you need to make sure that other has the attribute "vertex" !

This ticket needs benchmarking, to see if something significant is still gained in term of time or not.
