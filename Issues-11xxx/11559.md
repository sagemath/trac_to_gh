```
To my surprise, computing the Chow group spends most of the time comparing cones instead of doing linear algebra. 3/4 of the time is spent in `PosetElement.__eq__()`:

```
   return self.parent() == other.parent() \
          and self.element == other.element \
          and self.vertex == other.vertex
```
Reordering this to first compare `self.vertex == other.vertex` speeds it up dramatically.

Patch has some other fixes. Changes the Chow group to use sparse matrices.

Attachment [trac_11559_fix_Chow_group.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket11559/trac_11559_fix_Chow_group.patch) by @novoselt created at 2011-07-01 00:29:27

Can you clarify why `hermit_form` was replaced with `echelon_form`?

Also I don't like the very last change with forceful passing of `check=False` to the parent constructor. I think the correct way is to always pass whatever was received from the user and if it leads to a slowdown somewhere, then in that somewhere one should use `check=False`.

I took a look at this earlier, so I'll add my 2 cents worth.

`hermite_form` is a straight replacement for `echelon_form`.  Now that we have a `rref` command to obtain results over fields, I personally think it would be nice if "hermite form" went away, I think it confuses too many non-specialists.

I was going to vouch for the posets and linear algebra, but I don't know the Chow group stuff, so it is good that Andrey is on this one.

My point is that the `PosetElement.element` comparison is potentially slow. In fact, I don't understand why `PosetElement.__eq__` compares both `vertex` and `element`, I am under the impression that there is a bijection between vertices and elements.

If it's the hunk in the poset code that fails, that's normal. #10998 already integrates this change (in fact a slightly better one).
