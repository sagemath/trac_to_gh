```
To my surprise, computing the Chow group spends most of the time comparing cones instead of doing linear algebra. 3/4 of the time is spent in `PosetElement.__eq__()`:

```
   return self.parent() == other.parent() \
          and self.element == other.element \
          and self.vertex == other.vertex
```
Reordering this to first compare `self.vertex == other.vertex` speeds it up dramatically.

Patch has some other fixes. Changes the Chow group to use sparse matrices.

Can you clarify why `hermit_form` was replaced with `echelon_form`?

Also I don't like the very last change with forceful passing of `check=False` to the parent constructor. I think the correct way is to always pass whatever was received from the user and if it leads to a slowdown somewhere, then in that somewhere one should use `check=False`.

I took a look at this earlier, so I'll add my 2 cents worth.

`hermite_form` is a straight replacement for `echelon_form`.  Now that we have a `rref` command to obtain results over fields, I personally think it would be nice if "hermite form" went away, I think it confuses too many non-specialists.

I was going to vouch for the posets and linear algebra, but I don't know the Chow group stuff, so it is good that Andrey is on this one.

What kind of parents are you using. Normally they should be unique so that
parent comparisons should be done with is and thus instantaneous. Moreover, I
don't think your solution is correct because in some case you will end up
comparing things where eq will simply break. I'll try to cook an example.

I agree that parents should be unique. The original code compared parents with `==` and I didn't change it.

My point is that the `PosetElement.element` comparison is potentially slow. In fact, I don't understand why `PosetElement.__eq__` compares both `vertex` and `element`, I am under the impression that there is a bijection between vertices and elements. 

The reordering does break comparison between `PosetElement`s and other classes, though I'm not sure if we care. The patch does conflict with #10998, so that one needs to be reviewed first.

If it's the hunk in the poset code that fails, that's normal. #10998 already integrates this change (in fact a slightly better one).

If you do not want to check the parent first, you need to make sure that other has the attribute "vertex" !

This ticket needs benchmarking, to see if something significant is still gained in term of time or not.
