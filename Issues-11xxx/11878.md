The wrapper at #4539 originally tried to use Singular for computations in quotients of g-algebras. But for some reasons it did not work, and thus it was decided to temporarily use generic quotient rings, so that the ticket can be merged.

The purpose here is to use rings constructed by Singular from a "ring list", which should provide a more efficient implementation.

There should also be a proper implementation for the commutative case as well. Currently, generic code is used:

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: I = [x^2+x*y*z,y^2-z^3*y,z^3+y^5*x*z]*P
sage: Q = P.quotient(I)
sage: type(Q)
<class 'sage.rings.quotient_ring.QuotientRing_generic_with_category'>
```


Depends on #4539

It turns out that the code for the quotients from #4539 did not work properly, because comparison of elements of g-algebras did not take into account the relations.

Assume we are in a quotient ring Q (not sca) in Singular. As we know, the normal form of a polynomial p with respect to the defining ideal of the quotient ring is not automatically computed. But it can be obtained by NF(p,std(0)).

I tried to create a Gröbner strategy object G for the zero ideal in Q. However, G.normal_form(p) did *not* reduce p. G.normal_form relies on the function `redNF`, I guess from Singular's `kstd2.cc`. 

Is `redNF` the wrong thing to use in quotient rings? I see that `redNF` accepts several arguments, that seem to be undocumented (like many functions in Singular).

I broadened the purpose of the ticket: Implementing quotients of multivariate polynomial rings via Singular should be just as easy as implementing quotients of g-algebras via Plural.

There is a design problem for the elements, though. I see three approaches:

1. Have a single class of elements for quotients and non-quotients. Do a reduction with respect to the modulus (if there is any) when comparing, hashing or printing elements.
2. Have two separate classes, essentially copying the old `MPolynomial_libsingular`  class for creating a `NCPolynomial_plural` class. The change would mainly amount to replacing the strings `MP` and `_libsingular` by `NCP` and `_plural`, respectively.
3. Have two separate classes, but avoid code-duplication. For this to work, one needs to modify the arithmetic methods of `MPolynomial_libsingular`, such that for example `left._add_(right)` does not return a new instance of  `MPolynomial_libsingular`, but a new instance of  `left.__class__`.

All three approaches have disadvantages: The first approach may slow down the arithmetic of polynomials, since any call to hash, repr and cmp would involve a test whether the parent is a quotient ring. The second would imply a massive code duplication. The third may, again, slow down arithmetic, since (as in the first approach) arithmetic is spoiled by additional tests.

Modern editors are capable to copy-and-paste, and I prefer speed. Thus, I'll go for the second approach, unless one of you objects.

using
Singulars `reduce` generated by `singular_function`
should automatically deal with the quotients and still sufficiently fast (for generation of rings). Of course, similarly to the usual case where we attach the GB to an ideal as strategy,
we can attach the quotient ideal here to the ring.
Do not ask me about any internal Singular details at the moment.
I suggest repairing things in a most clean way (and do a performant patch later).
In fact using the later patch, we might be again be faster than Singular itself (as we can eliminate the repeated initialization of the strat object).
