As pointed out here: #11660 and here: #11664 archives have to be world-readable. sage-pkg does not enforce this.

The following patch adds options to `sage -pkg` which allow to force anonymous or world-readable file settings (or both).

I'd also say they should, but they don't have to. ;-)

It would be better to just change them in `sage-spkg` (including `umask`) if at all.

The proper way would IMHO be to fix the permissions of the **installed** files.

`sage-pkg` could issue a warning though.

This is not going to happen, unless you want to patch all upstream packages.

I am personally in favour of a warning, instead of forcably changing permissions.

I don't see the point why this information is useful, one would better look at the `hg log` or `SPKG.txt` for this.  With my current merge-script this information is lost anyway because every spkg is unpacked and repacked (in between changes are committed, a `hg tag` is added and the spkg is checked for some obvious mistakes).

Yep, in the Sage distros.

I won't object making both modifications optional, i.e. adding separate options to `sage-pkg` for changing the owner/group, and the file modes ("permissions").

The first could default to "yes" (or `True`), the second IMHO shouldn't.

Partially off-topic but highly important question: what does your "broken" filesystem do to executable permissions?  If it doesn't preserve permissions, it might also change the executable bit which is very bad anyway.

Could you please tell me which OS you are using, which filesystem it is precisely and what happens when you do

```
$ chmod 644 some_file
$ ls -l some_file
$ chmod 755 some_file
$ ls -l some_file
```
on that filesystem?  I'm just trying to understand the situation better so I can find out the best fix.

That's what I meant, though I might have said it wrongly.

It is Linux, in particular SuSE Enterprise 11, but that's not part of the problem. The file are on an standalone file server which caches a lot of things. It seems there is a bug in the fileserver's system or in the driver, so that permissions are sometimes "stuck", i.e. chmod doesn't to anything (resp. the changes last some minutes to become active).

But anyway, as I understand from #11664 the sources *must* be world readable in any case. So Sage should provides a tool to ensure this while packaging - at least optionally.  Alternatively, `sage-pkg` should test the permissions and give a warning if necessary.

FWIW, doing

```sh
$ tar -C /tmp -xvjf foo-x.y.z.pN.spkg &&
  tar -C /tmp --owner=0 --group=0 -cvjf foo-x.y.z.pN.spkg foo-x.y.z.pN
```
you can achieve the same.

The installation tree of that old spkg had always been sane, since PolyBoRi enforces the permissions on install. 

The permissions in the source tree were considered as buggy. But if you what specific permissions in the source, you need a tool to either enforce or check this. (That patch for checking would be trivial. I'll provide it, if there's a chance for a review.)

I'd rather set the `umask` in `sage-spkg`, and do a `chmod -R +rX` on the *extracted* spkg upon installation, if one wants to go triple-safe.

The added spkg "sanity check" regarding permissions is IMHO superfluous and rather annoying; as Keshav mentioned, we should in general leave the upstream alone, i.e., ship it really vanilla, and maybe fix individual permissions in the corresponding `spkg-install` file if necessary.

I meant security on your side, not on the user's who installs an spkg.

Signing spkgs, at least those officially shipped or made available, wouldn't be bad either, but that's a different issue.  Of course also every Sage developer could sign his spkgs; I usually provide md5sums for mine, although for a different reason.  But as far as I know Jeroen currently repackages all spkgs anyway before they get merged into a release, just like commit messages of patches get "beautified", regardless of whether they already contain the ticket number.

I didn't mean `sage -pkg` (i.e., a sanity check regarding permissions *there*, although you'd have the same problems unless you're upstream), but the *merger script* which complains about any "suspicious" permissions since -- as mentioned -- it's hard or impossible to do a *reasonable* check regarding this, i.e., to make sure all *installed files* have or will have the correct permissions.

So I wouldn't mind if `sage -pkg` issued warnings (to perhaps be disabled by some option), but the proper or safest way to avoid such issues is IMHO still to set the umask and do a `chmod -R` on `src/` at least (from `sage-spkg`), although this will in most cases be redundant or superfluous (e.g. if `install -c -m ...` is used by the spkg anyway, or all files to be copied with `cp -p` already have the proper permissions).  In fact, a sanity check should be made *on the Sage installation*, after one or more (or all) spkgs have been built and installed.
