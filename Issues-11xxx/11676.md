What is the desired resolution? `sage-pkg` should not modify the `src/` directory when making an SPKG.

I'd also say they should, but they don't have to. ;-)

It would be better to just change them in `sage-spkg` (including `umask`) if at all.

The proper way would IMHO be to fix the permissions of the **installed** files.

`sage-pkg` could issue a warning though.

This is not going to happen, unless you want to patch all upstream packages.

I am personally in favour of a warning, instead of forcably changing permissions.

Yep, in the Sage distros.

I won't object making both modifications optional, i.e. adding separate options to `sage-pkg` for changing the owner/group, and the file modes ("permissions").

The first could default to "yes" (or `True`), the second IMHO shouldn't.

Just another 2pence from me: in my current environment permissions and owners/groups are sometimes enforced by the file system. So the only way to reliably change is within the tarball. So: should I prepare a patch which makes enforcing optional?

Partially off-topic but highly important question: what does your "broken" filesystem do to executable permissions?  If it doesn't preserve permissions, it might also change the executable bit which is very bad anyway.

Could you please tell me which OS you are using, which filesystem it is precisely and what happens when you do

```
$ chmod 644 some_file
$ ls -l some_file
$ chmod 755 some_file
$ ls -l some_file
```
on that filesystem?  I'm just trying to understand the situation better so I can find out the best fix.

Well, in principle only files that are to be *copied* (with `-p`) into the Sage installation tree should have 0644 or 0755 permissions (one should usually use some BSD-like `install` where this isn't an issue at all), but it's of course nearly impossible to check that when doing an automatic "sanity" check on an spkg.




> BTW: For the second part of the patch - namely changing the user/group to root - this should be done for privacy reasons anyway. (This can only be done in the tar file)


FWIW, doing

```sh
$ tar -C /tmp -xvjf foo-x.y.z.pN.spkg &&
  tar -C /tmp --owner=0 --group=0 -cvjf foo-x.y.z.pN.spkg foo-x.y.z.pN
```
you can achieve the same.

(I personally don't think privacy really matters here, especially since you can fake arbitrary user/group names or IDs, and your e-mail address should be contained in the log anyway.

Right, but others could be trapped in the same way.

I'd rather set the `umask` in `sage-spkg`, and do a `chmod -R +rX` on the *extracted* spkg upon installation, if one wants to go triple-safe.

The added spkg "sanity check" regarding permissions is IMHO superfluous and rather annoying; as Keshav mentioned, we should in general leave the upstream alone, i.e., ship it really vanilla, and maybe fix individual permissions in the corresponding `spkg-install` file if necessary.

I meant security on your side, not on the user's who installs an spkg.

Signing spkgs, at least those officially shipped or made available, wouldn't be bad either, but that's a different issue.  Of course also every Sage developer could sign his spkgs; I usually provide md5sums for mine, although for a different reason.  But as far as I know Jeroen currently repackages all spkgs anyway before they get merged into a release, just like commit messages of patches get "beautified", regardless of whether they already contain the ticket number.

I don't agree (it would have helped to avoid #11664), but it seems there's no way to fix the ticket.

> I don't agree (it would have helped to avoid #11664), but it seems there's no way to fix the ticket.

I didn't mean `sage -pkg` (i.e., a sanity check regarding permissions *there*, although you'd have the same problems unless you're upstream), but the *merger script* which complains about any "suspicious" permissions since -- as mentioned -- it's hard or impossible to do a *reasonable* check regarding this, i.e., to make sure all *installed files* have or will have the correct permissions.

So I wouldn't mind if `sage -pkg` issued warnings (to perhaps be disabled by some option), but the proper or safest way to avoid such issues is IMHO still to set the umask and do a `chmod -R` on `src/` at least (from `sage-spkg`), although this will in most cases be redundant or superfluous (e.g. if `install -c -m ...` is used by the spkg anyway, or all files to be copied with `cp -p` already have the proper permissions).  In fact, a sanity check should be made *on the Sage installation*, after one or more (or all) spkgs have been built and installed.
