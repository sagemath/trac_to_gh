Arithmetic with symbolic vectors (addition, scalar multiplication) produces an instance of `FreeModuleElement_generic_dense` instead of a new symbolic vector:

```
sage: v = vector(SR, [1])
sage: w = vector(SR, [x])
sage: type(v)
<class 'sage.modules.vector_symbolic_dense.Vector_symbolic_dense'> 
sage: type(w) 
<class 'sage.modules.vector_symbolic_dense.Vector_symbolic_dense'> 
sage: type(v + w)
<type 'sage.modules.free_module_element.FreeModuleElement_generic_dense'>
```

As David Roe pointed out, the problem is due to the constructor in `FreeModuleElement_generic_dense` hard-coding the class, so that arithmetic operations with symbolic vectors ends up being a `FreeModuleElement_generic_dense` rather than an instance of `Vector_symbolic_dense`.

The current patch implements the modification in `_new_c` proposed in sage-devel, and adds an extra doctest to `Vector_symbolic_dense`.  Interestingly, this change also affects the formatting of `Vector_callable_symbolic_dense`: instead of 

```
sage: f(r, theta, z) = (r*cos(theta), r*sin(theta), z), f
(r, theta, z) |--> (r*cos(theta), r*sin(theta), z)
sage: f+f
((r, theta, z) |--> 2*r*cos(theta), (r, theta, z) |--> 2*r*sin(theta), (r, theta, z) |--> 2*z)
sage: 3*f
((r, theta, z) |--> 3*r*cos(theta), (r, theta, z) |--> 3*r*sin(theta), (r, theta, z) |--> 3*z)
```
 
we now have 

```
sage: f(r, theta, z) = (r*cos(theta), r*sin(theta), z), f
(r, theta, z) |--> (r*cos(theta), r*sin(theta), z)
sage: f+f
(r, theta, z) |--> (2*r*cos(theta), 2*r*sin(theta), 2*z)
sage: 3*f
(r, theta, z) |--> (3*r*cos(theta), 3*r*sin(theta), 3*z)
```

As far as I can tell, this is a purely cosmetic change, so I've taken the liberty of going ahead and adapting the doctests in `Vector_callable_symbolic_dense`.
