The attached patch changes functionality of the binomial function of a polynomial to return a polynomial over a fraction field of the base ring.

With the patch, we get the following behaviour:

```
sage: P=PolynomialRing(RR,'z')
sage: z=P.gen()
sage: binomial(z,2)                       
0.500000000000000*z^2 - 0.500000000000000*z

sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: binomial(x,3)
1/6*x^3 - 1/2*x^2 + 1/3*x
binomial(x,3).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
}}

Which is more like what we would expect.
