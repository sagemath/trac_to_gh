As was put on [the wiki for Cygwin](CygwinPort), 

```
The following files need to be copied:
  "libcliquer.dll -> libcliquer.so", 
  "libflint.dll -> libflint.so",
  "libntl.dll.a -> libntl.dll"
```
See the comments for why the third one is dealt with at #11635.

Anyway, I'm making the spkgs so that they have both.

This will depend on #11246 in the sense that the flint spkg will be based upon it, though obviously there is nothing needed other than to directly upgrade.

Sure, I just didn't think to do it because it was much less invasive.

I don't think so.  The lines were breaking in my editor, and it seems to be standard practice for the more conscientious Sage developers to fix them to have a more uniform line-width for easy viewing in a terminal session.  The SPKG.txt for NTL was particularly bad.

OK, this is Cygwin–only (no changes on other platforms; did a sanity check --- tested spkgs on macosx).

I've made a new FLINT p8 spkg based on the latest p7 from #11246.

**New FLINT spkg: http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/flint-1.5.0.p8.spkg**

**md5sum:** `bcd152d2f0e1d503ffd1e7e637c388ef  flint-1.5.0.p8.spkg`

Except for the removal of the `.svn` directories from upstream, I haven't made any further changes (not even replaced the other occurrences of `$CP` by `cp`):

```sh
leif@quadriga:~/Sage/spkgs/flint-1.5.0.p8$ hg diff --git -r flint-1.5.0.p7 -r flint-1.5.0.p8

Thanks for alerting us to that, Jeroen. 

Since that is a pretty big upgrade to NTL at that ticket, I'd prefer to split that off to another ticket - I think it would require retesting that the NTL package compiles on Cygwin and that the change still is necessary, for instance, though it almost certainly is.

That is now #11635.  If the other two could get merged asap, that would be wonderful.  I can't do anything about it until at least Monday, probably later (due to needing access to Windows machines!), which is why I am splitting it off.
