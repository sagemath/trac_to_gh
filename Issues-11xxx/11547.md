```
As was put on [the wiki for Cygwin](../wiki/CygwinPort), 

```
The following files need to be copied:
  "libcliquer.dll -> libcliquer.so", 
  "libflint.dll -> libflint.so",
  "libntl.dll.a -> libntl.dll"
```
See the comments for why the third one is dealt with at #11635.

Two spkg upgrades:
* [cliquer-1.2.p10.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/cliquer-1.2.p10.spkg) 
* [flint-1.5.0.p8.spkg](http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/flint-1.5.0.p8.spkg) (based on the latest p7 from #11246)
  md5sum: `bcd152d2f0e1d503ffd1e7e637c388ef`

Depends on #11246

Interestingly, both FLINT and cliquer spkgs currently make reference to needing to make dll's because they're on Windows... it looks like having both won't be a problem, but I wonder out loud whether in the long run we need only the so file.  

Anyway, I'm making the spkgs so that they have both.

This will depend on #11246 in the sense that the flint spkg will be based upon it, though obviously there is nothing needed other than to directly upgrade.

Could you post the diff for cliquer, too?
Also, in the future please refrain from unnecessarily reformatting files you are changing in spkgs (it's probably some over-eager editor you are using does it).

Sure, I just didn't think to do it because it was much less invasive.

I don't think so.  The lines were breaking in my editor, and it seems to be standard practice for the more conscientious Sage developers to fix them to have a more uniform line-width for easy viewing in a terminal session.  The SPKG.txt for NTL was particularly bad.

I've made a new FLINT p8 spkg based on the latest p7 from #11246.

**New FLINT spkg: http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/flint-1.5.0.p8.spkg**

**md5sum:** `bcd152d2f0e1d503ffd1e7e637c388ef  flint-1.5.0.p8.spkg`

Except for the removal of the `.svn` directories from upstream, I haven't made any further changes (not even replaced the other occurrences of `$CP` by `cp`):

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A15):
> The NTL spkg should be rebased to ntl-5.5.2 from #5731.

Thanks for alerting us to that, Jeroen. 

Since that is a pretty big upgrade to NTL at that ticket, I'd prefer to split that off to another ticket - I think it would require retesting that the NTL package compiles on Cygwin and that the change still is necessary, for instance, though it almost certainly is.

That is now #11635.  If the other two could get merged asap, that would be wonderful.  I can't do anything about it until at least Monday, probably later (due to needing access to Windows machines!), which is why I am splitting it off.

Note the newline at the end; removing this solves the problem.  I guess this didn't cause trouble on other systems, since these patches are applied universally.

But this fix was still needed, so I've opened #11727 for this.
