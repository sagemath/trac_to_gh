Ticket arises as a result of #10635. The methods factor() and roots() for generic univariate polynomial elements in rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx have a lot of ring-specific code that would be better suited as methods attached to each individual base ring.

To whit, patch #10635 allows for the creation of _factor_univariate_polynomial() and _roots_univariate_polynomial() as dundermethods on the base ring. This should now be done, and the relevant code from factor() and roots() should be moved to these methods.

Depends on #10635
Depends on #13272

Depends on #13275
Depends on #13276

I guess we still want to fix this for the four remaining cases for factor():

* IntegerModRing
* IntegerRing
* FiniteField
* NumberField

roots() is a bit harder to clean up as the `ring` parameter makes it less clear who should have ownership of the implementation, so I'd probably leave it in the current state.
