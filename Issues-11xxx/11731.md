Ticket arises as a result of #10635. The methods factor() and roots() for generic univariate polynomial elements in rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx have a lot of ring-specific code that would be better suited as methods attached to each individual base ring.

To whit, patch #10635 allows for the creation of _factor_univariate_polynomial() and _roots_univariate_polynomial() as dundermethods on the base ring. This should now be done, and the relevant code from factor() and roots() should be moved to these methods.

I started to work on moving the code out of `factor()`. I'm trying to split this into several small tickets to make this easier for me to write and for someone else to review.

I guess we still want to fix this for the four remaining cases for factor():

* IntegerModRing
* IntegerRing
* FiniteField
* NumberField

roots() is a bit harder to clean up as the `ring` parameter makes it less clear who should have ownership of the implementation, so I'd probably leave it in the current state.

A drawback of using `_*_univariate_polynomial` methods is that it typically creates a dependency from the module implementing the base ring to that implementing the polynomials, which can be a bit annoying, especially with Cython code. This is not to say we shouldn't use them more, I'm just wondering if there is a better option.
