<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
Volker,

Unfortunate - but at least it is fixed now.  Passes tests in the obvious places, I'll run long tests overnight.

Comments, in decreasing order of merit.

1.  Tests would benefit from a mention of the Trac ticket being fixed.

2.  Do you want to document the `transformation` keyword in the docstring?

3.  Internal logic of the echelon form code is a mystery to me, as is the code for creating/copying matrices.  Since we are both in the neighborhood, is there a faster method for copying a matrix than the following?

```
for c from 0 <= c < self.ncols():
    for r from 0 <= r < self.nrows():
        self.set_unsafe(r, c, d.get_unsafe(r,c))
```

I don't know, just seems inefficient to go entry-by-entry.  Not critical, just a thought.  Long weekend here in the US, but I'll stick with this.

Rob

Applies, builds, passes obvious tests on 4.7.1.alpha3.  And looks good.

I'll run full tests overnight and then flip this to positive review.
