<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

Volker,

Unfortunate - but at least it is fixed now.  Passes tests in the obvious places, I'll run long tests overnight.

Comments, in decreasing order of merit.

1.  Tests would benefit from a mention of the Trac ticket being fixed.

2.  Do you want to document the `transformation` keyword in the docstring?

3.  Internal logic of the echelon form code is a mystery to me, as is the code for creating/copying matrices.  Since we are both in the neighborhood, is there a faster method for copying a matrix than the following?

```
for c from 0 <= c < self.ncols():
    for r from 0 <= r < self.nrows():
        self.set_unsafe(r, c, d.get_unsafe(r,c))
```

I don't know, just seems inefficient to go entry-by-entry.  Not critical, just a thought.  Long weekend here in the US, but I'll stick with this.

Rob
