The script `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin/testcc.sh` checks to see what C compiler the environment variable `$CC` is. But currently the script always exits with a 0, even if an error occurs. 

This patch will correct that. 

Note some forms of error will not be detected. If CC is defined as `ls`, then the code will try to list the C file, which will succeed without error. But the changes will allow one to check if a compiler is installed or not.

Replying to [mariah](#comment%3A2):
> Where is test.cc used?  It does not seem to be used by prereq-0.9 in sage-4.7.rc4.


Some of the .spkg's use it. Not many I must admit, but a few do, mainly in an attempt to support the Sun (now Oracle) compiler, but it might be used for AIX/HP-UX too. 

It would be worth fixing this bug. It might be sensible to add support for 'clang' to this script later, although since that's supposed to be compatible with gcc, perhaps it's not needed.

I agree that this is invalid.

Currently, there is no use case for this ticket. We only use `local/bin/testcc.sh` to check whether or not a compiler is `GCC` or `Sun_Studio` or `HP_on_HP-UX`. It is never used to check whether or not a compiler is suitable for anything.
