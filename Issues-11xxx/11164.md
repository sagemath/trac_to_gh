In the future, be sure to pick a component (for instance, calculus or symbolics); that will help people find it more easily.

There are two problems here.
* The actual problem - the report unfortunately has a typo.

```
sage: integrate(eq,x,-1e-6,1e-6)
-3.14159065359
```
   This is definitely a problem.  However, it's fixed in the latest Maxima.  Here is the old one, in Sage:

```
Maxima 5.22.1 http://maxima.sourceforge.net
using Lisp ECL 10.4.1
<snip>
(%i2) keepfloat:true;
(%o2)                                true
(%i3) integrate(sin(x)/x,x,-1.00000000000000e-6,1.00000000000000e-6)
;
(%o3)                         - 3.141590653589793
```
   And here is 5.24.0.  I assume this isn't a problem of which Lisp we are using?

```
Maxima 5.24.0 http://maxima.sourceforge.net
using Lisp SBCL 1.0.24

rat: replaced 9.999999999999999e-7 by 1/1000000 = 9.999999999999999e-7
                                 %i                                %i

                               1000000                           1000000
```
* A problem revealed, but also fixed in the latest.   Old:

```
(%i4) integrate(sin(x)/x,x,-1e-6,1e6);

Maxima encountered a Lisp error:

 #<a FLOATING-POINT-OVERFLOW>

Automatically continuing.
To enable the Lisp debugger set *debugger-hook* to nil.

```
   New:

```
(%i10) integrate(sin(x)/x,x,-1e-6,1e6);

rat: replaced 9.999999999999999e-7 by 1/1000000 = 9.999999999999999e-7

rat: replaced -9.999999999999999e-7 by -1/1000000 = -9.999999999999999e-7

                                                                       %i

         %i gamma_incomplete(0, 1000000 %i)                          1000000
(%o10) - ---------------------------------- - -------------------------------
                         2                                   2
                                  %i
       %i gamma_incomplete(0, - -------)
                                1000000    %i gamma_incomplete(0, - 1000000 %i)

```

We'd need doctesting to test both of these once we upgrade Maxima.

The graph makes it very obvious the second (numerical) answer is correct.  Unsurprisingly, the other answer is off by exactly `pi`...

Presumably the first answer is "correct" in the sense that it is an alternate representation of the `Si` sine integral function.  But I think there are some branch issues - `Ei(I*x)` only has an alternate formula for `x>0`.  

So we still need to do something with this.  Or at the very least warn about branches.  But really, `sin(x)/x` shouldn't have to worry about this!

Does this work on the current maxima trunk now?

<div id="comment:5" align="right">Comment 5</div>

This is the previous version (5.25.1):

```

(%i5) integrate(sin(x)/x,x,-1/1000000,1/1000000);

(%o5) %i*gamma_incomplete(0,-%i/1000000)-%i*gamma_incomplete(0,%i/1000000)

```
W|A agrees that this is about `-pi`.  (To be precise, `2*Si(1/10^6)-pi`.)  

```

(%i4) display2d:false;

(%o4) false
(%i5) integrate(sin(x)/x,x);

(%o5) -(%i*gamma_incomplete(0,%i*x)-%i*gamma_incomplete(0,-%i*x))/2
```
Here is the issue; this function may or may not be the same as the sine integral.  The problem seems to be that although Maxima has the sine integral (`expintegral_si`), it isn't really connected with the rest of Maxima (?).

What do you think a good solution to this is?  I suppose we could open a ticket for it on the Maxima site, but I'm not sure whether the `Si` there is robust enough to handle all this yet.

In 6.3.beta4 (so with #13973), I get:

```
sage: eq = sin(x) / x
sage: integrate(eq, x, -1e-6, 1e-6)
-I*Ei(1/1000000*I) + I*Ei(-1/1000000*I)

sage: _.n()
3.14159265359179
```
Something bad happens with the integration computation when crossing over 0 as we have:

```

-1/2*I*Ei(1/1000000*I) + 1/2*I*Ei(1/1000000000000*I) - 1/2*I*Ei(-1/1000000000000*I) + 1/2*I*Ei(-1/1000000*I)

Drivel.  We could try this, though the branch problem is likely still there with incomplete gamma.

```
sage: maxima_calculus('integrate(sin(x)/x,x)')
-(%i*gamma_incomplete(0,%i*x)-%i*gamma_incomplete(0,-%i*x))/2
sage: maxima_calculus('integrate(sin(x)/x,x)').sage()
-1/2*I*Ei(I*x) + 1/2*I*Ei(-I*x)
```
because we do

```
        if x == 0:
            return -Ei(-y)
```
in sage/functions/other.py

But unfortunately

```
sage: i*CC(0).gamma_inc(-i/100000)-i*CC(0).gamma_inc(i/100000)
-3.14157265358979
```
So same problem there.  Yuck.  We really need Maxima to provide a proper `Si` function, or somehow magically translate such combos ourselves with pattern-matching, which sounds horrible too.

Replying to [@sagetrac-jakobkroeker](#comment%3A17):
> We really need Maxima to provide a proper `Si` function

Maxima has provided a proper Si function for a while called `expintegral_si(x)` which seems to fit the bill. Maxima doesn't seem to use it though, and the behavior you described still occurs:

`sage: maxima_calculus('integrate(sin(x)/x,x)')`
`-(%i*gamma_incomplete(0,%i*x)-%i*gamma_incomplete(0,-%i*x))/2`

Edit: upstream said this would be fixed [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3079/#94bd) in 2016.
