Given the creation of the Sage root repo (see #9433), the repository in `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base` should be combined with it.

1) apply [attachment: 11073_root_hgignore.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11073/11073_root_hgignore.patch.gz) to the root repo

2)

```
cd $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base
rm -rf .hg* stdint.h_Solaris9 sage-*
hg add *-install README.txt
mkdir ../bin
mv *.py sage-* *.sh text-* ../bin
cd ../bin
cp -p $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-env .
cp -p $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-spkg .
cp -p $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-sage sage
hg add . *
hg commit -m "Trac #11073: Move base repository to root repository"
```

4) apply [attachment: 11073_root_after.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11073/11073_root_after.patch.gz) and [attachment: 11073_prereq_install.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11073/11073_prereq_install.patch.gz) to the root repository.

5)

```
cd $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin
hg remove sage-env sage-spkg sage-sage
hg commit -m "Trac #11073: Move various scripts to spkg/bin"
```

5) apply [attachment: 11073_scripts.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11073/11073_scripts.patch.gz) to the scripts repo

6) apply [attachment: 11073_sagelib_misc.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11073/11073_sagelib_misc.patch.gz) to the main Sage repo.

7) apply [attachment: 11073_extcode.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11073/11073_extcode.patch.gz) to `data/extcode`.

The file `stdint.h_Solaris9` is not used and therefore deleted.  `sage-env`, `sage-spkg` and `sage-sage` (renamed to `sage`) are moved to `spkg/bin`, `sage-make_relative` to scripts (`local/bin`).

The script `sage-sage` is renamed to `spkg/bin/sage` and `$SAGE_ROOT` is no longer put in the $PATH, such that running "sage" after `sage-env` will run `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin/sage`.

Fixes #10970 (do not generate `pipestatus`), see also #12102 (make `bzip2` a standard package) and #12206 (install `sage_scripts` earlier), #12311 (stop copying testcc.sh and testcxx.sh).

> Dave: in the base repository, can you explain what the files stdint.h_Solaris9, testcc.sh, and testcxx.sh are for?  I know what the last two do, but are they actually used anywhere?  I can't find any reference to them in SAGE_ROOT/local/bin or SAGE_ROOT/spkg.  Are they called by various spkg-install files?

I'm not aware of what stdint.h_Solaris9 was supposed to do. I think Micheal added that. It's pretty dumb, as it forces a long to be 4 bytes with:

```
typedef unsigned long       int_fast32_t;
```

which is obviously invalid on 64-bit builds. I recall having to create a ticket to stop including that file, as it was screwing up attempts to build Sage 64-bit on Solaris. 

Given Solaris 10 came out in 2005, I don't think there's much point in worrying about Solaris 9 anyway.

As such, I think that stdint.h_Solaris9 should be deleted and if there is any issues it creates, we fix them. But I don't think it will create any problems. 

The testcc.sh and testcxx.sh scripts are used in a few .spkg files. There's several .spkg files which have tests for the compilers, which would be much simplified if replaced by those scripts.

I think the scrips repository will be ok. If nothing else, it is consistent with much of the rest of Sage. I don't think either of those scripts gets used before the sage-scripts package is installed, but I'm not 100% sure on that.

It is invalid, but not for the reason you state.

The problem is that `int_fast32_t` is supposed to be **signed**, while `unsigned long` is **unsigned**.  As for size, the type `int_fast32_t` is required to be *at least* 32 bits, not *exactly* 32 bits, so the following would be correct, both on 32-bit and 64-bit machines:

```
typedef long            int_fast32_t;
```

In fact, on my 64-bit Linux laptop, the types `int_fast16_t` and `int_fast32_t` are `typedef`ed to be 64-bit `long`s.

On Solaris the int_fast_32 remains at 32-bits, even on 64-bit code, so what actually caused Sage to fail to compile was certainly the size rather than the sign. 

That little bit of header file was included in Sage well after Sage built reliably 32-bit. It was only when I tried a 64-bit build of Sage that this became a problem. (I think a 64-bit Sage on Solaris is looking further away now, as we don't have a good solution for making sure modules are initialized properly before anything is imported from them.)

## Test program

```
drkirkby@laptop:~$ cat test.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/int_types.h>

int main() {
  printf("sizeof(int)=%d\n",sizeof(int));
  printf("sizeof(long)=%d\n",sizeof(long));
  printf("sizeof(int_fast32_t)=%d\n",sizeof(int_fast32_t));
  exit(0);
}
```
## Create a 32-bit executable and execute it

```
drkirkby@laptop:~$ gcc  test.c
drkirkby@laptop:~$ ./a.out
sizeof(int)=4
sizeof(long)=4
sizeof(int_fast32_t)=4
```
## Create a 64-bit executable and execute it

```
drkirkby@laptop:~$ gcc  -m64 test.c
drkirkby@laptop:~$ ./a.out
sizeof(int)=4
sizeof(long)=8
sizeof(int_fast32_t)=4
```

> In fact, on my 64-bit Linux laptop, the types `int_fast16_t` and `int_fast32_t` are `typedef`ed to be 64-bit `long`s.

As you can see, that's not so on Solaris, int_fast32_t remains 32-bits, even in 64-bit code. 

I recall using a Cray Y-MP with Unicos, where

```
sizeof(char)=1
sizeof(short)=8
sizeof(int)=8
sizeof(long)=8
```
The Cray is the only system I've come across where shorts are 64-bit. That tripped me up, as some code I'd written assumed shorts were 2 bytes.

Having thought about this more, I think it would be better if they were in the root repository.

Copying files between root and scripts repositories is horrible. We can't make relative symlinks from `$SAGE_LOCAL` to `$SAGE_ROOT` since they might be unrelated directories. I think the best solution is to have small shell scripts in the scripts repository that call the script in the sage root repository. It seems that this is only `sage-env` and the `testcc.sh`, `testcxx.sh` scripts.

Patch instructions:

1) remove everything but the tar archives from spkg/base

```
cd $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base
rm -rf .hg *-install README.txt sage-* test*sh stdint.h_Solaris9
```

2) apply trac_11073_remove_base_repo.patch to the root repo

3) apply trac_11073_stop_copying_stuff.patch to the root repo

4) apply trac_11073_stubs_for_base.patch to the scripts repo

Some notes about files formerly in the spkg/base repository:
* `stdint.h_Solaris9`: deleted
* `sage-spkg`: deleted from sage_scripts, should live in sage_root only. 
* `sage-env`: replaced by stub in sage_scripts. 
* `testcc.sh`, `testcxx.sh`: replaced by stub in sage_scripts
* `sage-make_relative`: was a Python script, but base doesn't have Python yet ?!?. Deleted.

I recall having changed this (such that `sage-make_relative` only gets called if Sage's Python is already installed), but it's not yet in 4.7.2, and I don't recall the ticket.

Anyway, `sage-make_relative` itself should be present from the beginning, although we could do the same thing (and a bit smarter) directly in `sage-spkg`, AFAIK the only script from where it's used.

There is no compelling need to upgrade the `base` packages: an old bzip2 and old prereq (which only does some checks AFAIK) should do just fine.

Any time I see an \"rm -rf\" in a script I'm very paranoid.  This is the sort of situation where Python would be better.  \n\n2. Many people -- e.g., me on the seemingly dozens of machines I have Sage installed on -- will have a \"sage\" script that is from before this patch.  That script will *not* be upgraded when we upgrade our Sage install, since that script is in local/bin/ (say), not in `SAGE_ROOT` (and it need not be a symlink).

COMMENTS:

1. In this code (and anything similar?):

```
        17	cd "$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base" 
 	18	rm -rf .hg* json_bundle.py stdint.h_Solaris9 sage-* text-* *.sh 
```
can we have an error check after the cd, before "rm -rf", since if something went wrong (even a control-c at the wrong moment, or the spkg/base directory is already gone!), then the "rm -rf" *will* cause some serious pain, e.g., deleting the .hg repo from SAGE_ROOT.   Any time I see an "rm -rf" in a script I'm very paranoid.  This is the sort of situation where Python would be better.  

2. Many people -- e.g., me on the seemingly dozens of machines I have Sage installed on -- will have a "sage" script that is from before this patch.  That script will *not* be upgraded when we upgrade our Sage install, since that script is in local/bin/ (say), not in `SAGE_ROOT` (and it need not be a symlink).  That older script explicitly calls "local/bin/sage-sage", so it will now be totally broken, since this ticket deletes sage-sage.     For this reason, I think it is absolutely essential that sage-sage not be deleted.  The sage-sage script needs to remain, but could either be a 1-liner that calls `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin/sage` *or* it could produce a nice useful error message explaining that the user must update their sage script by copying over the one from SAGE_ROOT, and edit the path, or create a symbolic link. 

3. As far as I can tell, I'm happy with everything else about the new scripts added 33 hours ago.  They fix the issue I reported on sage-devel.

When I use the app bundle, I see this in the log file:

```
/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage-5.0.pa1.app/Contents/Resources/start-sage.sh: line 41: ./local/bin/sage-env: No such file or directory
```
I wonder if there should be a place-holder script local/bin/sage-env which runs spkg/bin/sage-env.  Otherwise, the file `SAGE_ROOT/data/extcode/sage/ext/mac-app/start-sage.sh` will have to be changed. 

I do not see the wrong port, though: I see `8000`, not `0`.
