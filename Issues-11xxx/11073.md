Given the creation of the Sage root repo (see #9433), the repository in `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base` should be combined with it.

1) apply [attachment:11073_root_hgignore.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11073/11073_root_hgignore.patch) to the root repo

2)

```
cd $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base
rm -rf .hg* stdint.h_Solaris9 sage-*
hg add *-install README.txt
mkdir ../bin
mv *.py sage-* *.sh text-* ../bin
cd ../bin
cp -p $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-env .
cp -p $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-spkg .
cp -p $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-sage sage
hg add . *
hg commit -m "Trac #11073: Move base repository to root repository"
```

4) apply [and [attachment:11073_prereq_install.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11073/da71f4d1be71d5c90882db03c676d730.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11073/7d32d4ef6b64cfbff6306b295aaf9e32.patch)) to the root repository.

5)

```
cd $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin
hg remove sage-env sage-spkg sage-sage
hg commit -m "Trac #11073: Move various scripts to spkg/bin"
```

5) apply [attachment:11073_scripts.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11073/11073_scripts.patch) to the scripts repo

6) apply [attachment:11073_sagelib_misc.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11073/11073_sagelib_misc.patch) to the main Sage repo.

7) apply [attachment:11073_extcode.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11073/11073_extcode.patch) to `data/extcode`.

The file `stdint.h_Solaris9` is not used and therefore deleted.  `sage-env`, `sage-spkg` and `sage-sage` (renamed to `sage`) are moved to `spkg/bin`, `sage-make_relative` to scripts (`local/bin`).

The script `sage-sage` is renamed to `spkg/bin/sage` and `$SAGE_ROOT` is no longer put in the $PATH, such that running "sage" after `sage-env` will run `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin/sage`.

Fixes #10970 (do not generate `pipestatus`), see also #12102 (make `bzip2` a standard package) and #12206 (install `sage_scripts` earlier), #12311 (stop copying testcc.sh and testcxx.sh).

I'm not aware of what stdint.h_Solaris9 was supposed to do. I think Micheal added that. It's pretty dumb, as it forces a long to be 4 bytes with:

```
typedef unsigned long       int_fast32_t;
```

which is obviously invalid on 64-bit builds. I recall having to create a ticket to stop including that file, as it was screwing up attempts to build Sage 64-bit on Solaris. 

Given Solaris 10 came out in 2005, I don't think there's much point in worrying about Solaris 9 anyway.

As such, I think that stdint.h_Solaris9 should be deleted and if there is any issues it creates, we fix them. But I don't think it will create any problems. 

The testcc.sh and testcxx.sh scripts are used in a few .spkg files. There's several .spkg files which have tests for the compilers, which would be much simplified if replaced by those scripts.

It is invalid, but not for the reason you state.

The problem is that `int_fast32_t` is supposed to be **signed**, while `unsigned long` is **unsigned**.  As for size, the type `int_fast32_t` is required to be *at least* 32 bits, not *exactly* 32 bits, so the following would be correct, both on 32-bit and 64-bit machines:

```
typedef long            int_fast32_t;
```

In fact, on my 64-bit Linux laptop, the types `int_fast16_t` and `int_fast32_t` are `typedef`ed to be 64-bit `long`s.

On Solaris the int_fast_32 remains at 32-bits, even on 64-bit code, so what actually caused Sage to fail to compile was certainly the size rather than the sign. 

That little bit of header file was included in Sage well after Sage built reliably 32-bit. It was only when I tried a 64-bit build of Sage that this became a problem. (I think a 64-bit Sage on Solaris is looking further away now, as we don't have a good solution for making sure modules are initialized properly before anything is imported from them.)

## Test program

```
drkirkby@laptop:~$ cat test.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/int_types.h>

int main() {
  printf("sizeof(int)=%d\n",sizeof(int));
  printf("sizeof(long)=%d\n",sizeof(long));
  printf("sizeof(int_fast32_t)=%d\n",sizeof(int_fast32_t));
  exit(0);
}
```
## Create a 32-bit executable and execute it

```
drkirkby@laptop:~$ gcc  test.c
drkirkby@laptop:~$ ./a.out
sizeof(int)=4
sizeof(long)=4
sizeof(int_fast32_t)=4
```
## Create a 64-bit executable and execute it

```
drkirkby@laptop:~$ gcc  -m64 test.c
drkirkby@laptop:~$ ./a.out
sizeof(int)=4
sizeof(long)=8
sizeof(int_fast32_t)=4
```

> In fact, on my 64-bit Linux laptop, the types `int_fast16_t` and `int_fast32_t` are `typedef`ed to be 64-bit `long`s.

As you can see, that's not so on Solaris, int_fast32_t remains 32-bits, even in 64-bit code. 

I recall using a Cray Y-MP with Unicos, where

```
sizeof(char)=1
sizeof(short)=8
sizeof(int)=8
sizeof(long)=8
```
The Cray is the only system I've come across where shorts are 64-bit. That tripped me up, as some code I'd written assumed shorts were 2 bytes.

Having thought about this more, I think it would be better if they were in the root repository. 

There are lots of bits of code in Sage which are testing if the compilers are Sun or GNU. Those bits could be dramatically simplified by using the `testcc.sh` and `testcxx.sh` scripts. Look in rubiks for example. There are probably 20 or more spkg-install scripts which are using some test for the Sun compiler in one form or another.

Copying files between root and scripts repositories is horrible. We can't make relative symlinks from `$SAGE_LOCAL` to `$SAGE_ROOT` since they might be unrelated directories. I think the best solution is to have small shell scripts in the scripts repository that call the script in the sage root repository. It seems that this is only `sage-env` and the `testcc.sh`, `testcxx.sh` scripts.

Patch instructions:

1) remove everything but the tar archives from spkg/base

```
cd $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base
rm -rf .hg *-install README.txt sage-* test*sh stdint.h_Solaris9
```

2) apply trac_11073_remove_base_repo.patch to the root repo

3) apply trac_11073_stop_copying_stuff.patch to the root repo

4) apply trac_11073_stubs_for_base.patch to the scripts repo

Some notes about files formerly in the spkg/base repository:
* `stdint.h_Solaris9`: deleted
* `sage-spkg`: deleted from sage_scripts, should live in sage_root only. 
* `sage-env`: replaced by stub in sage_scripts. 
* `testcc.sh`, `testcxx.sh`: replaced by stub in sage_scripts
* `sage-make_relative`: was a Python script, but base doesn't have Python yet ?!?. Deleted.

I recall having changed this (such that `sage-make_relative` only gets called if Sage's Python is already installed), but it's not yet in 4.7.2, and I don't recall the ticket.

Anyway, `sage-make_relative` itself should be present from the beginning, although we could do the same thing (and a bit smarter) directly in `sage-spkg`, AFAIK the only script from where it's used.

I'm not sure what you mean.

There is no compelling need to upgrade the `base` packages: an old bzip2 and old prereq (which only does some checks AFAIK) should do just fine.

Because of #12311, we should still copy `testcc.sh` and `testcxx.sh` to `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`.  This can then truly be fixed in #12311.

1. In this code (and anything similar?):

```
        17	cd "$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base" 
 	18	rm -rf .hg* json_bundle.py stdint.h_Solaris9 sage-* text-* *.sh 
```
can we have an error check after the cd, before "rm -rf", since if something went wrong (even a control-c at the wrong moment, or the spkg/base directory is already gone!), then the "rm -rf" *will* cause some serious pain, e.g., deleting the .hg repo from SAGE_ROOT.   Any time I see an "rm -rf" in a script I'm very paranoid.  This is the sort of situation where Python would be better.  

2. Many people -- e.g., me on the seemingly dozens of machines I have Sage installed on -- will have a "sage" script that is from before this patch.  That script will *not* be upgraded when we upgrade our Sage install, since that script is in local/bin/ (say), not in `SAGE_ROOT` (and it need not be a symlink).

3. As far as I can tell, I'm happy with everything else about the new scripts added 33 hours ago.  They fix the issue I reported on sage-devel.

The point is really to test whether the "App" part works, not to "make (p)test(long)" or anything.

Just to clarify: we never remove the `spkg/base` directory.  Things like `prereq-0.9-install` would still live  in that directory, but now as part of the root repository.

It worked for me, but only after I realized that I could no longer use an older external sage distribution because of the `local/bin/sage-env` to `spkg/bin/sage-env` change.  I think we should load `spkg/bin/sage-env` or if it doesn't exist then source `local/bin/sage-env`.  Of course I'm probably the only one who uses external sage distributions so I won't insist. :-)

This works for me.  With an old version of Sage, a message about spkg/bin/sage-env not existing still shows up, but the server starts anyway, as it should.

Any objections to giving this a positive review?
