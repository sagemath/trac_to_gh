The following piece of `root-spkg-install` doesn't work as intented, because the `$?` refers to the exit status of the first `if` instead of `hg incoming`:

```
    # Merge the repository, rather than overwrite changes that the
    # user may have made.
    hg incoming "$CUR" 1> /dev/null
    if [ $? -eq 1 ]; then
        # No changes to pull
        exit 0
    fi
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Error with Sage root repository: 'hg incoming' failed."
        exit 1
    fi
```
