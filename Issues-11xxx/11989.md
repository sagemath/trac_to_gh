Did you search sage-devel?

For example, take a look at [this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/32710f229fbd129b/43d2fc054d3a3cc6#43d2fc054d3a3cc6).

I took a look at them, my chroot mounts
/dev/shm with the following command:

```
mount -t tmpfs shm "${working_dir}/dev/shm" -o nodev,nosuid,size=128M
```
/dev/pts with:

```
mount -t devpts devpts "${working_dir}/dev/pts" -o ptmxmode=666
```
Does this look like it should work?

Ok, so I found out the solution:

```
mount -t devpts devpts "${working_dir}/dev/pts" -o ptmxmode=666
```

needs an extra option: newinstance

```
mount -t devpts devpts "${working_dir}/dev/pts" -o newinstance,ptmxmode=666
```

I don't know why this is as I'm not very familiar with the inner workings of building sage's documents, but this is a pretty big obstacle for anyone building in a chroot.. perhaps a building sage in a chroot page would be nice to start?
