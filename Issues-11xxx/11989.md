I am building sage 4.7.2 in a clean chroot and I am experiencing the following error during `make doc-html`:

```
RuntimeError: Unable to start gap because the command 'gap -r -b -p -T -o 9999G /build/src/sage-4.7.2/data//extcode/gap/sage.g' failed.
```

This is in a clean chroot building on archlinux. I build with the following way:

I have attached the full build log.

Did you search sage-devel?

For example, take a look at [this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/32710f229fbd129b/43d2fc054d3a3cc6#43d2fc054d3a3cc6).

<a id='comment:3'></a>I took a look at them, my chroot mounts
/dev/shm with the following command:

```
mount -t tmpfs shm "${working_dir}/dev/shm" -o nodev,nosuid,size=128M
```
/dev/pts with:

```
mount -t devpts devpts "${working_dir}/dev/pts" -o ptmxmode=666
```
Does this look like it should work?

<a id='comment:4'></a>Ok, so I found out the solution:

```
mount -t devpts devpts "${working_dir}/dev/pts" -o ptmxmode=666
```

needs an extra option: newinstance

```
mount -t devpts devpts "${working_dir}/dev/pts" -o newinstance,ptmxmode=666
```

I don't know why this is as I'm not very familiar with the inner workings of building sage's documents, but this is a pretty big obstacle for anyone building in a chroot.. perhaps a building sage in a chroot page would be nice to start?
