At https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/gu0Al01k-3Y/discussion I noted that list_plot/matplotlib are confused when given a nearly-constant sequence:

```
sage: list_plot([[0, 0.7886751345948214], [0.01, 0.788675134595], [0.02, 0.788675134595], [0.03, 0.788675134595], [0.04, 0.788675134595], [0.05, 0.788675134595], [0.06, 0.788675134595], [0.07, 0.788675134595], [0.08, 0.788675134595], [0.09, 0.788675134595], [0.1, 0.788675134595]])
```
fails with

(with 4.7.1 on 64-bit Linux.)

Since the usual plot() function works with constant functions, there should be a way to get this working. (Or, we should decide that this is a matplotlib bug and properly report it.)

It appears that the major locator is giving back bad values (i.e., somehow it is giving back [0,1,2] as the major tickmarks, which is then trimmed down to just 1, giving the minor locator error since there is only one major tickmark).

I think the problem is somewhere in matplotlib.ticker.MaxNLocator.bin_boundaries function, but I'm not sure.
