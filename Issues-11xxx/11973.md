Keywords: list_plot, matplotlib, sd40.5

At https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/gu0Al01k-3Y/discussion I noted that list_plot/matplotlib are confused when given a nearly-constant sequence:

```
sage: list_plot([[0, 0.7886751345948214], [0.01, 0.788675134595], [0.02, 0.788675134595], [0.03, 0.788675134595], [0.04, 0.788675134595], [0.05, 0.788675134595], [0.06, 0.788675134595], [0.07, 0.788675134595], [0.08, 0.788675134595], [0.09, 0.788675134595], [0.1, 0.788675134595]])
```
fails with

```
...
/opt/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/matplotlib/axis.pyc in get_minorticklabels(self)
   1076     def get_minorticklabels(self):
   1077         'Return a list of Text instances for the minor ticklabels'
-> 1078         ticks = self.get_minor_ticks()
   1079         labels1 = [tick.label1 for tick in ticks if tick.label1On]
   1080         labels2 = [tick.label2 for tick in ticks if tick.label2On]

/opt/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/matplotlib/axis.pyc in get_minor_ticks(self, numticks)
   1190         'get the minor tick instances; grow as necessary'
   1191         if numticks is None:
-> 1192             numticks = len(self.get_minor_locator()())
   1193
   1194         if len(self.minorTicks) < numticks:

/opt/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/matplotlib/ticker.pyc in __call__(self)
   1424

   1427         locs = [l for l in locs if (np.abs(l - majorlocs) > diff).all()]
   1428

IndexError: index out of bounds
```
(with 4.7.1 on 64-bit Linux.)

Since the usual plot() function works with constant functions, there should be a way to get this working. (Or, we should decide that this is a matplotlib bug and properly report it.)

```

It appears that the major locator is giving back bad values (i.e., somehow it is giving back [0,1,2] as the major tickmarks, which is then trimmed down to just 1, giving the minor locator error since there is only one major tickmark).

I think the problem is somewhere in matplotlib.ticker.MaxNLocator.bin_boundaries function, but I'm not sure.

I think the next step would be to try to replicate it using only matplotlib.  If we can do that, we can move the bug report upstream.

I think we can bump this up:

pylab.savefig("works.png")
pylab.close()
pylab.plot([0, 1], [1, 1+1e-14])
