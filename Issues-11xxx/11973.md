At https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/gu0Al01k-3Y/discussion I noted that list_plot/matplotlib are confused when given a nearly-constant sequence:

```
sage: list_plot([[0, 0.7886751345948214], [0.01, 0.788675134595], [0.02, 0.788675134595], [0.03, 0.788675134595], [0.04, 0.788675134595], [0.05, 0.788675134595], [0.06, 0.788675134595], [0.07, 0.788675134595], [0.08, 0.788675134595], [0.09, 0.788675134595], [0.1, 0.788675134595]])
```
fails with

```
...

   1076     def get_minorticklabels(self):

-> 1078         ticks = self.get_minor_ticks()
   1079         labels1 = [tick.label1 for tick in ticks if tick.label1On]
   1080         labels2 = [tick.label2 for tick in ticks if tick.label2On]

   1191         if numticks is None:

   1193
   1194         if len(self.minorTicks) < numticks:

   1428

IndexError: index out of bounds
```
(with 4.7.1 on 64-bit Linux.)

Since the usual plot() function works with constant functions, there should be a way to get this working. (Or, we should decide that this is a matplotlib bug and properly report it.)

I suspect the last one has some clues, but I can't remember off-hand which of these *actually* fixed that before.  Note that the error message here is different, because it's now an mpl error.

It appears that the major locator is giving back bad values (i.e., somehow it is giving back [0,1,2] as the major tickmarks, which is then trimmed down to just 1, giving the minor locator error since there is only one major tickmark).

I think the problem is somewhere in matplotlib.ticker.MaxNLocator.bin_boundaries function, but I'm not sure.

pylab.close()
