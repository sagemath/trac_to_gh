At https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/gu0Al01k-3Y/discussion I noted that list_plot/matplotlib are confused when given a nearly-constant sequence:

```

Since the usual plot() function works with constant functions, there should be a way to get this working. (Or, we should decide that this is a matplotlib bug and properly report it.)

It appears that the major locator is giving back bad values (i.e., somehow it is giving back [0,1,2] as the major tickmarks, which is then trimmed down to just 1, giving the minor locator error since there is only one major tickmark).

I think the problem is somewhere in matplotlib.ticker.MaxNLocator.bin_boundaries function, but I'm not sure.

I think we can bump this up:

```
import pylab
pylab.plot([0, 1], [0, 1e-14])
pylab.savefig("works.png")
pylab.close()
pylab.plot([0, 1], [1, 1+1e-14])
pylab.savefig("fails.png")
pylab.close()

reproduces the problem in mpl 1.2.x.
