David Montminy reported that polynomial system generation does not properly work with `star=True`, e.g.

```
sage: sr = mq.sr.SR(10,4,4,8,star=True,gf2=True,polybori=True)
sage: F,s = sr.polynomial_system()
sage: F2 = F.subs(s)
```
would result in an inconsistent system! It's quite puzzling that he's the first one to run into (who reports it anyway).

Hi, can you do a full review?
* read the patch and check whether it looks good to you, does it solve the problem correctlu?
* does it add a doctest which shows that the problem is solved.
* does it apply (you already said yes) and do doctests pass (done mostly automatically these days so don't worry too much about this one)

If you're satisfied, add your name to `Reviewer` and set the 'positive review' flag.
