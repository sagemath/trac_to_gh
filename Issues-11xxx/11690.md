David Montminy reported that polynomial system generation does not properly work with `star=True`, e.g.

```
sage: sr = mq.sr.SR(10,4,4,8,star=True,gf2=True,polybori=True)
sage: F,s = sr.polynomial_system()
sage: F2 = F.subs(s)
```
would result in an inconsistent system! It's quite puzzling that he's the first one to run into (who reports it anyway).

Doctests pass but we need to add a test showing that the bug is indeed fixed. Will do so once my shiny new 4.7.1 is compiled.

Hi, can you do a full review?
* read the patch and check whether it looks good to you, does it solve the problem correctlu?
* does it add a doctest which shows that the problem is solved.
* does it apply (you already said yes) and do doctests pass (done mostly automatically these days so don't worry too much about this one)

If you're satisfied, add your name to `Reviewer` and set the 'positive review' flag.

dmont: you should add your real name as reviewer and it would also be good to add yourself to [http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/#AccountNamesMappedtoRealNames](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/#AccountNamesMappedtoRealNames).
