Noting what things could be enhanced in Sage when this is upgraded:

* tight layouts could be improved: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/tight_layout_guide.html#plotting-guide-tight-layout . This doc also indicates that we may want to revisit how we do colorbars

* Marker documentation should be checked (see http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/whats_new.html#markers )
* colormaps may need to be updated
* contour label formatters can now be functions as well---we may need to change our docs

It would be great if we supported the new animation api too.

Replying to [@jasongrout](#comment:2):
> Noting what things could be enhanced in Sage when this is upgraded: [...]

OTOH, people frequently also ask how to set axis labels, do logarithmic plots, change the font of `$something` etc.

Right yesterday:

```
<hiptobecubic> Can i make a 3dplot where the color is determined by the value of the function?
 or any arbitrary function?
 _leif, do YOU know how to specify colors to plot3d?
<hiptobecubic> i can't find any example anywhere of any kind of color functions
```
(That's just one example.  I could only point him to `complex_plot()`, but I'm not sure whether that's what he was looking for, as it's not really 3D.)

IMHO there should be some tutorial on plotting as well... :P

Except for the issue of how the heck to test it on a million different platforms?  

I do like the patch.  Can you explain why those are the only places you need `grid_spec`, and what that does?   Also, 

```
the figure.tight_layout() function provides prettier graphs.  This also necessitated a change in making colorbar axes
```
Can you attach a couple before/after on the `tight_layout` business?  

That said, I think our best bet is actually to just have the #9958 package *quickly* reviewed and then take more time on this, unless you really think the changes here will be trivial.  I definitely do not have time for a proper spkg review at this point.

"Meanwhile, use of pad at least larger than 0.3 is recommended".  Are we doing this?

"This is an experimental feature and may not work for some cases."  It looks like this just means that it might stay in the previous way otherwise, but experimental makes me nervous.

fig_tight is "documented" in an example in the save function: http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/plot/plot.html#sage.plot.plot.Graphics.save.  It's also documented in the show command: http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/plot/plot.html#sage.plot.plot.Graphics.show (along with the rest of the show options).

I'm just using the default padding, whatever that is.  I think it is 0.15.  I'm not sure why there seems to be a difference between that and what the docs say.

If it's controversial, we can remove that one line in the save function.

I just want to make sure it isn't going to do something bad to some plots.  Which is why I'd want to spend some real time reviewing it :)

I'm completely unaware of any such trend, this is the first spkg I see doing this.  All 128 packages *merged* since sage-4.7 do have a `SPKG.txt` entry.

If you want to change this, I think it should be discussed on `sage-devel` first.
