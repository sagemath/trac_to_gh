```
var('a b c x', domain='real')
A = (sin(a) * x^2+sin(b) *x + sin(c)) * exp(-x^2)
Aint = A.integrate(x,-infinity,infinity)
```

A.imag() is 0

Aint.imag() is a long expression, which doesn't simplify to 0. This surprising for the user.

A slightly different example, actually a generalization of the one above, just works:

```
var('a b c x', domain='real')
B = (a * x^2+b *x + c) * exp(-x^2)
Bint = B.integrate(x,-infinity,infinity)
```

<a id='comment:6'></a>
This seems to be a missing rectform simplification because

```
sage: Aint.expand().simplify_rectform()
1/2*sqrt(pi)*sin(a) + sqrt(pi)*sin(c)
```
The bug is then rather that Maxima does it not in all cases.
