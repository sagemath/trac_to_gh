See [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/614/how-to-properly-substitute-in-a-matrix).  The poster wants an example something like

```
f(x,y)=x^2*y+y^2+y
solutions=solve(list(f.diff()),[x,y])
the_solution=solutions[2]
H=f.diff(2);  # Hessian matrix
```
but showing this.

```
sage: solutions=solve(list(f.diff()),[x,y],solution_dict=True)
sage: solutions
[{y: 0, x: -I}, {y: 0, x: I}, {y: -1/2, x: 0}]
sage: H.subs(solutions[2])
[(x, y) |--> -1  (x, y) |--> 0]
[ (x, y) |--> 0  (x, y) |--> 2]
sage: H(x,y).subs(solutions[2])
[-1  0]
[ 0  2]
```
This seems like a reasonable request.

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

Added two examples in symbolic expressions on:

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/calculus/sage/symbolic/relation.html

One is substituting variables into matrices of symbolic functions and the other is solving a multivariate equation and substituting the solution into a matrix.

Hello,

Could you use `A = B` instead of `A=B`? You did it in the first example but not the second. Something like

```
sage: solutions = solve(list(f.diff()), [x,y], solution_dict=True)
```
is much easier to read.

Vincent
