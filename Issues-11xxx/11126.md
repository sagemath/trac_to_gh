```
The symbolic ring (`SR`) in Sage currently considers itself to be a field and therefore also an integral domain:

```
sage: SR.is_field()
True
sage: SR.is_integral_domain()
True
```
However, it is confused about its category:

```
sage: SR.category()
Category of commutative rings
sage: SR in PrincipalIdealDomains()
False
sage: SR in Fields()
True
```
The last command causes the category of `SR` to be refined, and running the same commands again gives a different output:

```
sage: SR.category()
Category of fields
sage: SR in PrincipalIdealDomains()
True
sage: SR in Fields()
True
```
This ticket makes `SR.is_field()` and `SR.is_integral_domain()` return `False`.

Because of this, one now has to indicate explicitly in the code when one takes the risk of treating the symbolic ring as a field.  This is currently only done for a couple of linear algebra methods and for points on elliptic curves over the symbolic ring.

A few constructions (which were mathematically meaningless anyway) are now disallowed:
- quaternion algebras over the symbolic ring
- converting a symbolic expression into a rational function over the symbolic ring
- minimal polynomials of matrices over the symbolic ring

I have little doubt it still is. I suspect that one should just be pragmatic with SR and just keep fingers crossed when trying computations with SR. If they succeed: great! The answer might even be correct. If not: formulate the problem in another way.

What I suspect is happening is that linear algebra over SR tries to use generic linear algebra code which wants to know some properties of the ring it's working over in order to know how to proceed (i.e., is it a field? an integral domain?). The symbolic ring doesn't really fit such a rigorous approach and I suspect that most of its benefits stem from that: It's just an algebra of "expression trees". If SR were honest, and report it's not a field and not an integral domain, hardly anything would work. There's a benefit to lying and a lot of things WILL sort of work, because zero-divisors are relatively hard to construct. However, they do exist in SR, so I suspect that you can construct linear algebra examples for which a wrong answer is generated, because the code runs into a zero divisor (which was promised to not exist by claiming it's an integral domain).

SR is just trying to be a bit too much to expect a rigorous algebraic approach to apply to it and still end up with something useful. Testing equality in it is known to be undecidable.

I certainly wouldn't want to stand in the way of an intelligent discussion to improve the situation. Great mathematics happens in the face of great problems. I just thought a word of caution to moderate expectations was in order.

A similar thing happens (for different reasons) with the "numerical" rings. RR and CC claim to be fields too, but due to the numerical nature of the representation of their elements, they are not. Operations aren't even commutative and any float operations that rely on true equality testing are inherently broken. Linear algebra there is really quite tenuous and we can't rely on the generic approaches at all.
How to deal with that is an entire field of mathematics.

(now note that SR in fact contains float arithmetic as well to see that you can't really hope that generic approaches are always safe for SR).

<a id='comment:9'></a>Hi!

Why not adding a subset of symbolic Ring which forms a Field?
I think a good choice would be the subset of all symbolic functions which are
meromorphic. 

The Meromorph functions form a field, and contain most of the symbolic functions in use. Additionally this could be handy if we want to introduce differential algebras for symbolic integration and differentiation.

<a id='comment:15'></a>Hello,

I really do not like the strategy. Starting to have special cases for the symbolic ring will be a nightmare to write and maintain. The symbolic ring is definitely an ugly (and very useful) piece of code but it should not be intrusive. Not speaking about the fact that a line like `from sage.symbolic.ring import SymbolicRing` takes time to be executed. The current situtation that makes SR thinks that it is a field looks much more natural to me: keep the bullshit in one place.

And do you really think that we should support elliptic curves over the symbolic ring? I saw that there is an example in the doc, but we could just ignore it. From my perspective, `SR` should not even be a ring.

Could you give more motivation of changing the current situation? I do not get it from the ticket description?

Vincent
