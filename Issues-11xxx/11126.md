Keywords: symbolic ring category

The symbolic ring (`SR`) in Sage currently considers itself to be a field and therefore also an integral domain:

```
sage: SR.is_field()
True
sage: SR.is_integral_domain()
True
```
However, it is confused about its category:

```
sage: SR.category()
Category of commutative rings
sage: SR in PrincipalIdealDomains()
False
sage: SR in Fields()
True
```
The last command causes the category of `SR` to be refined, and running the same commands again gives a different output:

```
sage: SR.category()
Category of fields
sage: SR in PrincipalIdealDomains()
True
sage: SR in Fields()
True
```
This ticket makes `SR.is_field()` and `SR.is_integral_domain()` return `False`.

Because of this, one now has to indicate explicitly in the code when one takes the risk of treating the symbolic ring as a field.  This is currently only done for a couple of linear algebra methods and for points on elliptic curves over the symbolic ring.

A few constructions (which were mathematically meaningless anyway) are now disallowed:
- quaternion algebras over the symbolic ring
- converting a symbolic expression into a rational function over the symbolic ring
- minimal polynomials of matrices over the symbolic ring

Hi!

Why not adding a subset of symbolic Ring which forms a Field?
I think a good choice would be the subset of all symbolic functions which are
meromorphic. 

The Meromorph functions form a field, and contain most of the symbolic functions in use. Additionally this could be handy if we want to introduce differential algebras for symbolic integration and differentiation.

The symbolic ring is definitely an ugly (and very useful) piece of code but it should not be intrusive.

Hello,

I really do not like the strategy. Starting to have special cases for the symbolic ring will be a nightmare to write and maintain. The symbolic ring is definitely an ugly (and very useful) piece of code but it should not be intrusive. Not speaking about the fact that a line like `from sage.symbolic.ring import SymbolicRing` takes time to be executed. The current situtation that makes SR thinks that it is a field looks much more natural to me: keep the bullshit in one place.

And do you really think that we should support elliptic curves over the symbolic ring? I saw that there is an example in the doc, but we could just ignore it. From my perspective, `SR` should not even be a ring.

Could you give more motivation of changing the current situation? I do not get it from the ticket description?

Vincent

I agree that my patch has to be improved.  However, I think that this can be done without globally pretending that the symbolic ring is a field.
