In #9623, lots of interacts were added to the library.  Unfortunately, one (based on [this wiki page by Pablo Angulo and Eviatar Bach](http://wiki.sagemath.org/interact/misc#Cellular_Automata)) was "optimized" a bit too much.  We need to replace 

```
        for k in range(N-j, N+j+1):
```
by

```
 for k in range(0,2*N):
```
as in the original.  

One can test this by making sure the outputs are the same as at [the MathWorld site](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html) for this.  Thanks to jhpalmieri for discovering this in unrelated testing at #9623.

There's also a typo - "callular" isn't an adjective I'm familiar with in Wolfram's work :) And N is not actually used in the rule in the documentation, which has no actual output for this function!  Any patch should fix those things as well.

This is fine, thanks a lot.

I guess doing the patch really is just following instructions of the reporter ;) but the math is definitely easier than, say, stable homotopy theory :) (reading [this](http://www.math.washington.edu/~palmieri/Papers/research.pdf) was a nice walk through memory lane in some ways, good times) and also kind of fun, you should try it.  You don't have to read ANKOS to get the gist, and indeed probably shouldn't.
