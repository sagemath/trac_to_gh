In #9623, lots of interacts were added to the library.  Unfortunately, one (based on [this wiki page by Pablo Angulo and Eviatar Bach](http://wiki.sagemath.org/interact/misc#Cellular_Automata)) was "optimized" a bit too much.  We need to replace 

```
        for k in range(N-j, N+j+1):
```
by

```
 for k in range(0,2*N):
```
as in the original.  

One can test this by making sure the outputs are the same as at [the MathWorld site](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html) for this.  Thanks to jhpalmieri for discovering this in unrelated testing at #9623.

There's also a typo - "callular" isn't an adjective I'm familiar with in Wolfram's work :) And N is not actually used in the rule in the documentation, which has no actual output for this function!  Any patch should fix those things as well.
