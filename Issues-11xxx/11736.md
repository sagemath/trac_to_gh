The current implementation of lex_BFS() is quadratic, which is not optimal. The usual way to do it in linear time is through a clever use of doubly linked lists, but in (1) there is a way with static arrays, which I coded in Python.

There is one thing, though: in (2) there is a new algorithm for is_interval() that avoids PQ-trees, and just uses various passes of lex_BFS() (implemented with doubly linked lists).
So maybe in the long run it would be better to do it with doubly linked lists in Cython.

Hello Diego !!!

Same comment (see #11738) for this patch about the "build/" folder. I also expect that this patch breaks doctests in Sage's library, so please check it too, correcting the doctests themselves if it makes sense `:-)`

On random interval graphs sometimes the is_interval function works, sometimes it does not... `^^;` 

I tested you patch after having applied #11738 and #11735 but I do not think this is where the bug comes from. Could you also add some comments to your code, along with a reference to the paper you are following for this implementation ? `:-)`

Hello,

This patch has been sleeping for very very long time.

I did a first git version of the patch with some corrections. This is far from final version and we have currently 2 implementations to ease tests. To use the new version, you need to set parameter `new_version=True`.

Since the code has no comments, it is hard to know whats going on. I have corrected at least one bug (a missing `j = l`), but I have the following issue:

```
sage: g = graphs.PathGraph(3).lexicographic_product(graphs.CompleteGraph(2))
sage: g.lex_BFS(reverse=True)
[(2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 0)]
sage: g.lex_BFS(reverse=True, new_version=True)
[(2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 0)]
sage: g.lex_BFS(reverse=False)
[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1)]
sage: g.lex_BFS(reverse=False, new_version=True)
[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1)]
```

The new version is more consistant (and also way faster). Furthermore, on this example, both reverse orderings are correct. 
However, when making the new version the default one, many tests for `is_chordal` and `is_interval` are broken.

Any help is welcome.

David.

New branch based on 9.2.beta8 with:
- corrected (hope so) version of previous trials for implementing the algorithm of Habib et al 2000. 
- several improvements of the existing code

Please test it extensively !

something wrong :(

```
File "src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py", line 13620, in sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.is_interval
Failed example:
    [sum(1 for g in graphs(i) if g.is_interval()) for i in range(8)]  # long time
Expected:
    [1, 1, 2, 4, 10, 27, 92, 369]
Got:
    [1, 1, 2, 4, 10, 27, 91, 374]
```

At least this graph is not recognized as interval graph (actually, not chordal) when using the new version: `Graph("ETzw")`.

The difficulty is that we may have several valid orderings, even with same initial vertex, and that the 2 algorithms may produce different orderings
For instance:

```
sage: for i in range(100): 
....:     G = graphs.RandomChordalGraph(10) 
....:     F = G.lex_BFS(initial_vertex=0, algorithm="fast") 
....:     S = G.lex_BFS(initial_vertex=0, algorithm="slow") 
....:     print(i, "fast", F) 
....:     print(i, "slow", S) 
....:     if S != F: 
....:         print(G.graph6_string()) 
....:         break 
....:                                                                                                                               
0 fast [0, 1, 5, 9, 6, 4, 7, 2, 8, 3]
0 slow [0, 1, 5, 9, 6, 4, 7, 2, 8, 3]
1 fast [0, 1, 4, 8, 2, 7, 9, 6, 3, 5]
1 slow [0, 1, 4, 8, 2, 7, 9, 6, 3, 5]
2 fast [0, 6, 7, 9, 8, 5, 1, 3, 2, 4]
2 slow [0, 6, 7, 9, 8, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4]
IAHSCEA_w
```
In this example, the last graph is not connected, but it's the same with connected graphs.
For instance, take a star with center 0. Then any permutation of the leaves lead to a valid lex BFS ordering.

One option could be to make an indirect doctest using `is_chordal` on a random chordal graph, but for that me must be able to specify the lex BFS algorithm to use in `is_chordal`. Not sure it's the best way.

But may be there is an other way to check that a lex BFS ordering is valid ?

I have added a method to check that a lexBFS ordering is valid in (directed) graphs.
I'm not yet 100% convinced that it is enough to check this property, so if you are aware of other tests, let me know.

Thanks! Here are two more small things:

First, in the documentation for `lex_BFS_fast_short_digraph` (and now `lex_BFS`), there's a LaTeX typo at

```
S = `{u | i \leq \sigma(u) \leq j\}
```
The opening curly brace isn't escaped, so the formula isn't showing up.

Second, in `_is_valid_lex_BFS_order`, it looks to me like you've figured out the correct directions for the edges to make things work with a digraph, namely `ca`, `cb`, `da`, and `db`. However the docs still have some of them in a different order from when the result was stated for an undirected graph:

```
if `a < b < c` and `ac \in E` and `bc \not\in E`, then there exists `d\in V`                                                                                             
such that `c < d`, `bd \in E` and `ad \not\in E`.
```
