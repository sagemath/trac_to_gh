In `devel/sage/sage/libs/ppl.pyx`, there are various tests of the form

```
(out, err, ret) = test_executable(['sage', '-c', sage_cmd])
```
It turns out that these commonly result in timeouts (much more often than the basic tests in `sage/tests/cmdline.py`).  The proposal is to increase the timeouts in ppl.pyx.

Yes, good point. I keep forgetting that not everybody runs on a solid state drive. Those tests don't take any time at all on my system, but if you run on NFS then the startup can be painful.

Positive review!

Actually I discovered the problem is not related to `test_executable` but it is instead #11849.
