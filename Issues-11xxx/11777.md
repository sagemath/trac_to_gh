A strange problem maybe cause by a coercion problem when coercing from a number field into a p-adic field. Upon printing, repr_spec (reps. repr_gen if in 'bars' mode) ends up receiving an element whose call _ext_p_list(True) returns an empty list which causes some errors to be raised. Reproducing source code below.

The following code:

  p = 53
 K.<zeta12> = CyclotomicField(12)
QQp = Qp(p, prec=1000000)
print QQp.has_root_of_unity(3)
QQq = Qq(p!^2, names='z', prec=1000000)
print QQq.has_root_of_unity(3)
print QQq(zeta12)
print z!^2
aaa=QQq(zeta12!^2)
print aaa._ext_p_list(True)
print aaa

produces the output:

```
False
True
z + O(53^1000000)
(4*z + 51) + (52*z + 52)*53 + (52*z + 52)*53^2 + (52*z + 52)*53^3 + (52*z + 52)*53^4 + (52*z + 52)*53^5 + (52*z + 52)*53^6 + (52*z + 52)*53^7 + (52*z + 52)*53^8 + (52*z + 52)*53^9 + (52*z + 52)*53^10 + (52*z + 52)*53^11 + (52*z + 52)*53^12 + (52*z + 52)*53^13 + (52*z + 52)*53^14 + (52*z + 52)*53^15 + (52*z + 52)*53^16 + (52*z + 52)*53^17 + (52*z + 52)*53^18 + (52*z + 52)*53^19 + O(53^20)

It seems like there's a problem coercing zeta12!^2, since it should give z!^2 (note that if using 'bars' as print_mode, repr_gen raises an index out of bounds error as it attempts to access index 0 of aaa._ext_p_list(True). I don't know exactly what's going on, but at the very least shouldn't is_inexact_zero test for ._ext_p_list(True) returning an empty list?

Wait, the coercion from K to QQq is just sending K.gen() to QQq.gen(). That shouldn't be happening.

The fallback mode for the `__init__` method of `padic_ZZ_pX_CR_element` is to try to convert the input to a list.  This is why the conversion (not coercion: you explicitly asked Sage to construct an element of QQq if possible) is just sending generator to generator.

The empty `_ext_p_list` is the result of a missing check in the method constructing a p-adic element from a `ZZ_pX`.  I've added that check in the attached patch.

The coercion map you want from K to QQq needs to wait until completions of number fields are supported: see http://wiki.sagemath.org/padics/Completions.

Thanks for catching the bug!

I looked at the patch (11777.patch).  It seems fine except that the exception message says that the polynomial degree must be at most that of the modulus; the test actually wants "less than".

I've attached 11777-ver2.patch, which should be used instead of the original.
