<a id='comment:7'>Comment 7:</a>
The patch looks good :). Didn't try it yet how it works with doctests and  yet but at least the code looks reasonable.

If this passes all test, then at least I want something like the following as a doctest:

```
sage: L=K^2
sage: R=L.span([[x,1/x]])
sage: R.basis()[0][0]
x
sage: R.basis()[0][0].parent()
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: R=L.span([[x,x^2]])
sage: R.basis()[0][0].parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```
Since if we are going to look at the parent of one specific element, then we certainly want that it depends in the right way of the other elements. 

A neater way to do this would be to actually store "coefficient_ring" in the parent, since I think that 

```
parent.basis()[0][0].parent()
```
Is way to many steps removed from parent to actually directly acces from the code. But this is just nitpicking. 

I'm now doctesting your patch.

I really don't like the way how this was fixed. First of all, why is this even a bug? If you need fractions, I think you should use the fraction field from the beginning.

Second, it causes the computation of a basis(!) every time that `vector()` is called.

I am working on initialization of vectors in #17561 and I would actually like to revert this fix and make

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[] 
sage: L = R^1 
sage: L.span([(1/x,)]) 
```
a `TypeError` again.
