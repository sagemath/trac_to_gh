Franco's reviewer patch looks real good.  So positive review on that part from me.

Franco also mentioned that we need to include the "diagonal relation", so the inner loop index has been adjusted to make that happen, and doctests updated.  Then I rolled up the original patch, the reviewer patch, and the "diagonal" changes all into a single v2 patch.
