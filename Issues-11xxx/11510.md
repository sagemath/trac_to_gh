When sdist-ing Sage, there is absolutely no reason to distribute the SAGE_ROOT hg repository (i.e. the top-level `.hg` directory).  The hg repository should still be in the SAGE_ROOT spkg, so after Sage is built, there will be an hg repository present.  But before the Sage build, the hg repository serves no purpose.

This hg repository was introduced by #9433.

Lots of small files on the mirrors, not sure whether this is a desirable situation.  I can imagine that mirrors are optimized for just a few very large files.

Well, one can always do a standard `patch -p1` but I agree that you have a point.

Don't know.  Have you changed your mind?

There are advantages and disadvantages of having it there "from the beginning", although I tend to prefer having it.

Whether we need a separate sage_root *spkg*, also updated on every release, is IMHO orthogonal.
