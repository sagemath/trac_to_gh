When sdist-ing Sage, there is absolutely no reason to distribute the SAGE_ROOT hg repository (i.e. the top-level `.hg` directory).  The hg repository should still be in the SAGE_ROOT spkg, so after Sage is built, there will be an hg repository present.  But before the Sage build, the hg repository serves no purpose.

This hg repository was introduced by #9433.

Two comments:

- I can think of one situation where it might be useful to distribute the repo: someone has downloaded Sage and wants to immediately apply a patch to "Makefile", "spkg/standard/deps", etc.  Without the root repo, this is inconvenient.

Lots of small files on the mirrors, not sure whether this is a desirable situation.  I can imagine that mirrors are optimized for just a few very large files.

Well, one can always do a standard `patch -p1` but I agree that you have a point.

The way I understood it, the root repo would be directly part of the Sage tarball and not wrapped into an extra spkg. Updating Sage could be done with a mercurial bundle. 

That way, a first install as well as updates could always assume that the root repo is of the newest version.

I noticed before that first building Sage, then applying patches, and then rebuilding Sage is somewhat annoying. +1 from me :-)

Don't know.  Have you changed your mind?

There are advantages and disadvantages of having it there "from the beginning", although I tend to prefer having it.

Whether we need a separate sage_root *spkg*, also updated on every release, is IMHO orthogonal.

It seems I have the minority opinion here and also it is not such an important ticket.
