Someone should have noticed this:

```
./spkg-install: line 185: [: missing `]'
Installing PARI/GP...
```

Here's the culprit:

```sh
build()
{
    ...

    $MAKE $PARI_MAKEFLAGS gp
    if [ $? -ne 0]; then
        echo >&2 "Error: building PARI/GP failed."
    fi
}
```
Note that also an `exit 1` (!) is missing there.

(Two patches apply with fuzz 2 btw.)

**md5sum: `fd153c3ee354402bb6fc835b9e8ecd9a  pari-2.4.3.alpha.p7.spkg`**

(This spkg is based on / includes the never merged p6 from #10240, see comments below and there.)

Oh, just came across #10240, which also provided a p6 spkg, but now is marked duplicate since the change made there (for Cygwin) should go into a new PARI 2.5.0 at #11130.

Maybe I should merge that patch (which had positive review already) into my spkg and rename it to p7.

As for the rest, it looks right, but I have not actually tested any of it, including the quoting etc.  I'm sure that someone even a little more advanced in shell script could give it an immediate positive review (or needs work if there is something obvious missed).

Thanks so much for merging the #10240 stuff, by the way!
