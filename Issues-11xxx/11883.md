Okay, I think I know how to fix this: add these lines to spkg-install:

```diff

diff --git a/spkg-install b/spkg-install
--- a/spkg-install
+++ b/spkg-install
@@ -39,6 +39,10 @@ if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    exit 1
 fi
 
+if [ "$RM" = 'rm' ]; then
+   unset RM
+fi
+
 make
 if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error building BoehmGC."
```
In Sage 4.5.3's version of `sage-env`, we used to have 

```
if [ "$RM" = "" ]; then
    RM="rm"  && export RM
fi
```
We no longer have these lines, and their presence in 4.5.3 is why the upgrade fails.  So forcibly unsetting `$RM` if it's set to 'rm' fixes the problem, at least for me.

I've posted a new spkg, listed in the ticket description, and a corresponding patch, for review.  (It's simple enough that maybe we don't need a new ticket.)
