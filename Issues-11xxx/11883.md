As the summary says.  A new spkg is available here:

- [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/boehm_gc-7.2.alpha6.p0.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/boehm_gc-7.2.alpha6.p0.spkg)

This also upgrades to version 7.2.alpha6. According to [the boehm-gc website](http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/), the current stable version (7.1, which is what is included in Sage) "is old enough that you are almost certainly better off going with the much more recent and only somewhat experimental version", namely 7.2.alpha6.

The home base for this ticket is the Lion ticket #11881.

Okay, I think I know how to fix this: add these lines to spkg-install:

```diff

diff --git a/spkg-install b/spkg-install
--- a/spkg-install
+++ b/spkg-install
@@ -39,6 +39,10 @@ if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    exit 1
 fi
 
+if [ "$RM" = 'rm' ]; then
+   unset RM
+fi
+
 make
 if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error building BoehmGC."
```
In Sage 4.5.3's version of `sage-env`, we used to have 

```
if [ "$RM" = "" ]; then
    RM="rm"  && export RM
fi
```
We no longer have these lines, and their presence in 4.5.3 is why the upgrade fails.  So forcibly unsetting `$RM` if it's set to 'rm' fixes the problem, at least for me.

I've posted a new spkg, listed in the ticket description, and a corresponding patch, for review.  (It's simple enough that maybe we don't need a new ticket.)
