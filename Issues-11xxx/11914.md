ppurka suggests prepending `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/build/sage/` to `PYTHONPATH` in `sage-env`. This indeed works, but I'm not sure what else it might break. Advice?

Related: #10192 (SageNB is broken if "`.`" is *explicitly* contained in `PYTHONPATH` **during installation** of it.)

Apply [attachment:trac_11914-sage-env-pythonpath.patch] to `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin`

CC:  @ppurka @nexttime

Keywords: notebook SageNB startup, crash, sage-env PYTHONPATH

Resolution: fixed

The subdirectory `./sage` was my guess...

```sh
$ cd $SAGE_ROOT

```
cd Installations/sage-4.7/tmp

Python interprets the empty entry as the current working directory ("`.`").

Thanks for the PYTHONPATH fix. Didn't know that empty paths resolve to current directory.

Hmmm.  In principle we should avoid bashisms whenever possible.  (One of the very few exceptions would IMHO be `set -o pipefail`, which is supported by bashs >=3.0, but we still officially require just 2.04 since this version is shipped with MacOS X 10.4 [which is a mess to support anyway], <flame> and its users are incapable of installing a more recent version </flame>.)

The main reason we use `bash` is that we can to some extent rely on it being functional; there are too many broken Bourne shells, or at least `/bin/sh`ells.

Nice service, thanks.

I just wonder how many parts of Sage (unconsciously exploiting it) break if we fix this bug.
