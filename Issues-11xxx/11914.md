ppurka suggests prepending `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/build/sage/` to `PYTHONPATH` in `sage-env`. This indeed works, but I'm not sure what else it might break. Advice?

```sh

Python interprets the empty entry as the current working directory ("`.`").

Hmmm.  In principle we should avoid bashisms whenever possible.  (One of the very few exceptions would IMHO be `set -o pipefail`, which is supported by bashs >=3.0, but we still officially require just 2.04 since this version is shipped with MacOS X 10.4 [which is a mess to support anyway], <flame> and its users are incapable of installing a more recent version </flame>.)

The main reason we use `bash` is that we can to some extent rely on it being functional; there are too many broken Bourne shells, or at least `/bin/sh`ells.




> I'll make an hg patch out of leif's diff.


Nice service, thanks.

I just wonder how many parts of Sage (unconsciously exploiting it) break if we fix this bug.
