ppurka suggests prepending `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/build/sage/` to `PYTHONPATH` in `sage-env`. This indeed works, but I'm not sure what else it might break. Advice?

```sh
$ cd $SAGE_ROOT
$ (mkdir -p tmp/sage/sage && cd tmp/sage && ../../sage -n)

in contrast works for me.

We could make it more nice of course.

This disturbed me for a while now...

Is sage-env even called from anywhere outside Sage scripts? It seems weird that all the sage scripts are called as `#!/usr/bin/env bash` but the scripts themselves are not written (most of the time) as bash scripts.

Thanks for the PYTHONPATH fix. Didn't know that empty paths resolve to current directory.

The main reason we use `bash` is that we can to some extent rely on it being functional; there are too many broken Bourne shells, or at least `/bin/sh`ells.

Nice service, thanks.

I just wonder how many parts of Sage (unconsciously exploiting it) break if we fix this bug.
