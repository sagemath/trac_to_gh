Adds a method to the partition class that returns the 01 sequence of the partition (the sequence of north or east steps taken along the boundary of the partition). Since this is really an biinfinite sequence starting with 0000000 and ending with 11111111, this should return a a finite list of 0s and 1s, starting for any (non-empty) partition with a 1 and ending with a 0.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Helloooooo !!!

Some remarks/questions :

* Is there really no name for this "0-1 sequence" in the litterature ? `:-/"
* We try to keep our lines to 80 characters at most
* The documentation of "from_zero_one" can not be found easily by the user : these informations should also be given in the documentation of the Partition class. If the user wants to build a partition this way, he/she first has to consult the help of Partition, then read the code, then load the from_zero_one" method manually, then consult its help `:-P`
* The "INPUT:" field is not a Sphinx field, so only one semicolumn is sufficient. Same thing for OUTPUT.
* I did not really understand of defining the 01 sequence as biinfinite to say just afterwards that it is equivalently defined by a finite sequence.
* I do not find the current definition "that clear". As it is easy to compute, would it be worth giving a formal definition of the transformation from partition to 0-1 sequence in the documentation ?

As for the patch, the `INPUT:` block in indented one too many times. Could you put some of the alternative names in the function's documentation? Also I feel like the formatting would be better in latex formatting ``1-0``.
