Adds a method to the partition class that returns the 01 sequence of the partition (the sequence of north or east steps taken along the boundary of the partition). Since this is really an biinfinite sequence starting with 0000000 and ending with 11111111, this should return a a finite list of 0s and 1s, starting for any (non-empty) partition with a 1 and ending with a 0.

Helloooooo !!!

Some remarks/questions :

* Is there really no name for this "0-1 sequence" in the litterature ? `:-/"
* We try to keep our lines to 80 characters at most
* The documentation of "from_zero_one" can not be found easily by the user : these informations should also be given in the documentation of the Partition class. If the user wants to build a partition this way, he/she first has to consult the help of Partition, then read the code, then load the from_zero_one" method manually, then consult its help `:-P`
* The "INPUT:" field is not a Sphinx field, so only one semicolumn is sufficient. Same thing for OUTPUT.
* I did not really understand of defining the 01 sequence as biinfinite to say just afterwards that it is equivalently defined by a finite sequence.
* I do not find the current definition "that clear". As it is easy to compute, would it be worth giving a formal definition of the transformation from partition to 0-1 sequence in the documentation ?

Here is a new patch, rebased on 5.7.beta3.

In my opinion, there remains one problem : the choice of the name.

If nobody comes with a better one, with **references**, then I think the ticket is good to go, if the light turns green.

`@`name: Richard Stanley (in "The Rank and Minimal Border Strip Decomposition of a Skew Partition", http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0109092.pdf) calls this the "Comét code" of the partition, probably referring to one of the encodings in Stig Comét's http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1955-09-052/S0025-5718-1955-0074954-0/ .

May I suggest implementing a similar back-and-forth conversion for skew partitions and biwords of 0's and 1's? Of course, one could take the Comét code of the inner rim and the outer rim, but then one would have to fumble around with their offsets to make them match, so an implementation in the library would be preferred.

Curiosity question: What is a difference between a normal and an "indirect" doctest?

It's for functions/methods that aren't explicitly called in the doctest. For example `Foo._repr_()` being called when you execute `sage: Foo`.

As for the patch, the `INPUT:` block in indented one too many times. Could you put some of the alternative names in the function's documentation? Also I feel like the formatting would be better in latex formatting <code>\`1-0\`</code>.

A math/documentation note, these also arise from affine permutations and have connections to `k`-Schur functions (see **k-Schur Functions and Affine Schubert Calculus**, pages 24-25, http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3569 and from this you could also justify calling these **plus-minus sequences**).

Finally could you rebase this on the (soon to be completed) #13605? I'll do the final review if you rebase it as soon as #13605 is done. Promise.

Thank you,

Travis
