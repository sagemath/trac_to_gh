Marking a doctest `# known bug` means that it is skipped unless the `--optional` flag is passed to `sage -t`.  This needs to be documented.

Also, many doctests in Sage are marked `# optional - requires PKG`, and this means that `sage -t -only-optional=PKG ...` does not run the test: the word "requires" is interpreted as a package name.  This is not ideal.  

The attached patch to the scripts repo removes the word "requires" (and also "needs") automatically.  It also allows a colon or comma instead of a hyphen, as in `# optional: requires PKG`.  It also converts tests marked as "known bug" to tests marked as "optional bug", so they are run when you do `sage -t -only-optional=bug ...`.  The attached patch to the main Sage library documents all of this.

By the way, the patch to the scripts library also fixes a bug: if you have a doctest marked

```
    sage: 2+2 # optional: pkg1 pkg2
    17
```
and run `sage -t -only-optional=pkg1,pkg2 ...`, the test would not be run: the function `only_optional_include` in sage-doctest would convert "pkg1 pkg2" to "pkg1pkg2" with no spaces, so it would only be run with `sage -t -optional` or `sage -t -only-optional=pkg1pkg2`.  With the new version, the string gets converted to `'pkg1,pkg2'`, and then split into `['pkg1', 'pkg2']`.

Previously, you could use the undocumented

```

I like this, and it still applies!

Here is something to ask.   Could have two `if` statements (instead of some sort of `elif` or something) cause trouble if a doctest was marked as optional *and* a bug?  I've tried to make something break, but I'm not sure if this is the "right" behavior or not.  Here is my example.

Adding doctest

```

            sage: 2+2 # optional -- known bug
            5
```
to a file gives

```

$ ../../sage -t -only-optional=known,bug ../../devel/sage/sage/symbolic/expression_conversions.py 
sage -t -only-optional=known,bug "devel/sage/sage/symbolic/expression_conversions.py"
	 [0.1 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 0.1 seconds
```
and the same happens with `-only-optional=bug`, but it fails (correctly) with `-optional`.

Otherwise the patch seems fine, and doc looks good (*naturally*!).

Good point.  I've changed the code. Now if I doctest this function:

```python
def testing():
    """

        sage: 2+2 # optional -- known bug
        5

        sage: 2+2 # optional

    pass
```
I get three failures with `sage -t ... --optional` and two failures with `sage -t ... --only-optional=bug`.

Okay, so it looks like `# known bug` is run by `sage -t --optional`.  I think this was clear before, but I didn't realize it for some reason.  I feel like this should be made more clear in the documentation in the other patch.  <code>\`\`sage -t --only-optional=bug ...\`\`</code> isn't the only way this can be revealed, that is.  Just 

```
-so it is also detected by ``--only-optional=bug``.)
+so it is detected by ``--only-optional=bug`` and also ``--optional``.)
```

Here is a very very corner case.

```
        sage: 2+2 # optional -- magma bug
        7
```
This only runs with `--only-optional=magma,bug`.  I guess that's ok.  

What do you think about these two things? Maybe neither one is an issue.

Otherwise I do think this is in pretty good shape.

I can do that.

> Here is a very very corner case.


 ```
         sage: 2+2 # optional -- magma bug
         7
 ```
> This only runs with `--only-optional=magma,bug`.

This is the old behavior: marking a doctest `# optional X Y Z` means it should only be run with `--only-optional=X,Y,Z`.  So I don't think we need to add anything about it.
