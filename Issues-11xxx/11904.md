This should be fixed:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 + 2)
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(K)
sage: pari(a*x)

PariError:  (5)
```

The reason is:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 + 2)
sage: a._pari_()
Mod(x, x^3 + 2)
```
Note that the variable `x` is used. Since polynomials prefer the variable name `x`, it might be better to use `y` by default (or any other name) for number field elements.

There is no good way to fix this for relative number fields, so we don't change that.

Also, the `_pari_()` methods for `NumberFieldElement_absolute` and `NumberFieldElement_relative` are exactly the same, so we should avoid code duplication.

Quick question?   What happens if I do:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 + 2)
sage: R.<y> = PolynomialRing(K)
sage: pari(a*y)
```

I would find out for myself, but with sage-4.7.2.alpha3, I get 13 hunks fail, so I can't apply the patch.  And I don't know which version of Sage this patch is against.


If the above fails, isn't this a pretty bad approach to this problem?    Wouldn't it be better to call the variable in PARI something like "__x" or "_x" (say), which is very very unlikely to class.   That would use the standard Sage/Python convention that one should not use stuff prefixed with underscores except in programming.

This fails by raising `PariError`.

The following *does* work (and it does *not* without the patch):

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 + 2)
sage: R.<y> = PolynomialRing(K)
sage: (a*y)._pari_with_name('x')
Mod(y, y^3 + 2)*x
```

Well, it should apply against sage-4.7.2.alpha3 (or more recent) if you apply all the dependencies.  But it is possible that I forgot a dependency.

No, this has to do with variable priorities and is not something which is easily fixed.  Besides, even if we do this, then you would still have problems again with polynomial rings in multiple variables or relative extensions.

So I'm not claiming this patch fixes all issues, it just *improves* on the existing behaviour.  My patch changes the `pari` function for number field polynomials from **never** working to **sometimes** working (it works if you use *x* as polynomial variable).

I also think this patch is important for the Sage library, since there we can easily take the PARI variable to be *x*.  For example, my patch changes

```
Kbnf = self.pari_bnf(proof=proof).nf_subst("'y")
coeffs = [ a._pari_("y") for a in relpoly.coeffs() ]
polrel = pari(coeffs).Polrev()
return Kbnf.rnfisnorminit(polrel)
```
to the much simpler

```
Kbnf = self.pari_bnf(proof=proof)
return Kbnf.rnfisnorminit(relpoly._pari_with_name())
```
