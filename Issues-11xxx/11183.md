This patch implements the local axioms for highest weight crystals of simply-laced types. This is a very useful test to check that a given crystal is actually consistent (for simply-laced types these tests are necessary and sufficient, for nonsimply-laced types only necessary). I tested this patch mathematically on several crystals.

sage -t on all relevant crystal code passes. If the buildbot gives green light for all tests, this is a positive review!

Currently, the tests in /sage/categories/examples/crystals.py do not pass and need to be updated. In addition, it would be good to provide an implementation of a simple "crystal" that does not pass the Stembridge tests in this file.

So I set this to "needs work".
