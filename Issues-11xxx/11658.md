Is this really an issue?

I guess the timeout simply sets a `SIGALRM`, which the `sleep()` function(s) override, but I may be wrong.

P.S.:

If you use `p_iter="fork"` (the only variant that's said to support `timeout`), apparently indeed only `ncpus`-1 child processes are created, so it seems to be as I guessed.

Depending on the selection / order of arguments, you may well get timeouts for [perhaps only some of] the child processes (i.e. they'll get killed), though not after the time you'd expect.

The behaviour is non-deterministic though, for whatever reason. (Try running the `time` command repeatedly, i.e. within a loop.)

Oh, this is a more funny one (and not due to what I first guessed).

Looking at the code, it **does** spawn `ncpus` processes, but there's a fat bug in the code (re)computing how long to wait the next time (the call to `signal.alarm()`):

```python

                    if timeout:
                        def mysig(a,b):
                            raise RuntimeError, "SIGALRM"
                        oldest = min([X[1] for X in workers.values()])
                        signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, mysig)
                        signal.alarm(int(walltime() - oldest)+1)
```
(`X[1]` is the wall time each child process was forked / started.)

This code is executed repeatedly; if `wait()` was interrupted by a `RuntimeError` triggered by `SIGALRM`, it is checked whether any of the child processes timed out, and if so, they get killed.

:D Just wondering if we should add a doctest for that, but now it has already positive review...

I was going to add one similar to Maarten's example (with some parallel sleeping processes, the default of `ncpus`, and a timeout of about 5 seconds), marking it `# long time`.
