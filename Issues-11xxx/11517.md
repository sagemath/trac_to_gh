Upstream of LiDIA has disappeared.

However, I maintain a version of LiDIA, with minimal changes so that it compiles with current C++ compilers, for the LattE project.
(We use a tiny piece of functionality of LiDIA in LattE. It is optional, but crucial for performance of some algorithm variants.)

How does one check that lattE knows about lidia? Does an executable link against it? I only see

```
config.status: creating code/lidia-include.h
```
in latteE log if I grep it for lidia.

Better grep -i for it. You should be seeing "checking for LIDIA >= 2.1... found" in LattE's configure output. Then LiDIA support will be compiled in.

To double-check after installation, invoke "count" with the command-line option "--smith-form=lidia". (This is the default when LiDIA is installed, but this option will signal an error if LiDIA is not installed.)

An example:

```
count --smith-form=lidia --irr --exp --maxdet=1000 $SAGE_ROOT/local/share/latte-int/examples/hickerson/hickerson-16
```

Also, you can check that "count" links dynamically to libLiDIA. (It does here on Mac OS X; I have not checked other platforms.)

no, on Linux it says "not found", even though LiDIA installs OK. I see

```

Ah, OK, it seems I need to install a fix for case-sensitive file systems that I need in the LattE-for-tea-too distribution scripts as well.
I will look into this later today.

LattE has its own tests in code/test-suite/test.pl.in; there we list 54 as the correct answer. I don't remember if there is a second source for this answer.

By the way, best to run both "make check" and "make installcheck"; the latter checks the binaries of latte installed by "make install". 

Also, I guess I should be "Author" rather than "Reviewer"?
