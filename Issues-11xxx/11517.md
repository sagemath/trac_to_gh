Better grep -i for it. You should be seeing "checking for LIDIA >= 2.1... found" in LattE's configure output. Then LiDIA support will be compiled in.

To double-check after installation, invoke "count" with the command-line option "--smith-form=lidia". (This is the default when LiDIA is installed, but this option will signal an error if LiDIA is not installed.)

An example:

```
count --smith-form=lidia --irr --exp --maxdet=1000 $SAGE_ROOT/local/share/latte-int/examples/hickerson/hickerson-16
```

Also, you can check that "count" links dynamically to libLiDIA. (It does here on Mac OS X; I have not checked other platforms.)

Ah, OK, it seems I need to install a fix for case-sensitive file systems that I need in the LattE-for-tea-too distribution scripts as well.
I will look into this later today.

LattE has its own tests in code/test-suite/test.pl.in; there we list 54 as the correct answer. I don't remember if there is a second source for this answer.

By the way, best to run both "make check" and "make installcheck"; the latter checks the binaries of latte installed by "make install". 

Also, I guess I should be "Author" rather than "Reviewer"?
