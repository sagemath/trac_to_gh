```
If a request in _eval_line of the gp interface cannot be executed due to lack of stack memory, the tmp file used to transfer results is blocked.

This is a workaround. We simple create a new file and trust in the system when it comes to cleaning the environement after GP has terminated.

See #11018 for a ticket for removing this workaround after finding a better solution (without reevaluating the GP code!)
