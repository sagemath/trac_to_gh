I was reading this code to understand a bit better how the SparseGraph backend worked (as it is the default one in Sage), and added comments while I was at it.
I also replaced some loops initializing values by a memset, as it is usually faster. This produces next-to-zero improvement in Sage, but well.. `:-)`

Before :

```
625 loops, best of 3: 1.26 ms per loop
sage: %timeit Graph(10000)
625 loops, best of 3: 1.25 ms per loop
sage: %timeit Graph(10000)
625 loops, best of 3: 1.47 ms per loop
sage: %timeit Graph(10000)
625 loops, best of 3: 1.25 ms per loop
sage: %timeit Graph(10000)
625 loops, best of 3: 1.25 ms per loop
sage: %timeit Graph(100)
625 loops, best of 3: 94.7 µs per loop
sage: %timeit Graph(100)
625 loops, best of 3: 98.8 µs per loop
sage: %timeit Graph(100)
625 loops, best of 3: 95.8 µs per loop
sage: %timeit Graph(100)
625 loops, best of 3: 95.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit Graph(100)
625 loops, best of 3: 96.6 µs per loop
sage: %timeit Graph(100)
625 loops, best of 3: 95.2 µs per loop
```

After 

```
sage: %timeit Graph(10000)
625 loops, best of 3: 1.15 ms per loop
sage: %timeit Graph(10000)
625 loops, best of 3: 1.15 ms per loop
sage: %timeit Graph(10000)
625 loops, best of 3: 1.15 ms per loop
sage: %timeit Graph(10000)
625 loops, best of 3: 1.21 ms per loop
sage: %timeit Graph(10000)
625 loops, best of 3: 1.15 ms per loop
sage: %timeit Graph(100)
625 loops, best of 3: 94.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit Graph(100)
625 loops, best of 3: 92.7 µs per loop
sage: %timeit Graph(100)
625 loops, best of 3: 93.5 µs per loop
```

By the way Robert, this is all mostly about touching your code and adding comments, and as I am trespassing I expect you may not like some of those `:-)`

<a id='comment:2'></a>Nathann,

I'm happy with this patch except for one thing: I'd like you to change each added occurrence of the word "edge" to "arc" in the SparseGraph code. The reason being that SparseGraphs are never directed as implemented, and I think using the word arc helps keep this clear throughout.

Otherwise it looks fine to me. Any extra explanation of the rather complicated SparseGraph structure will be helpful, I think.
