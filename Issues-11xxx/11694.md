When creating a graph from a list of edges, if the edges are not labelled they get doubled when multiedges are allowed.  It works fine if they are labelled.

```
sage: g=Graph([[1,2],[1,2,],[2,3]])
sage: g.num_edges()
6
sage: g=Graph([[1,2,'a'],[1,2,'b'],[2,3,'c']])
sage: g.num_edges()
3
```

See #11693.

This ticket definitely isn't needing a review as there is no patch attached. Should it be removed as a duplicated as was done before ?

I think I read somewhere that I should set milestone as duplicate and then make it needs_review so that someone else can actually close it.  It should be closed with extreme prejudice.
