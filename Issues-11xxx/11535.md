This routine is really intended for instructional use.  It makes it clear that linear independence is a property of a set of vectors from a vector space, thus its placement in the module code.  It is much quicker for the experienced user to just ask for a kernel, but I intend to make this available to students for discussions of vector spaces in their own right, before discussing subspaces such as the kernel of a matrix.  As a bonus, an empty set as a return value is equivalent to linear independence.
