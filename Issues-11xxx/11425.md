See [this sage-devel thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/2949ab8832386bf8) for several nasty things that happen because combinat methods mess with the lists involved.

```
sage: from sage.combinat.permutation import to_standard as pts 
sage: a = [1,2,4] 
sage: pts(a) 
[1, 2, 3] 
sage: a 
[5, 5, 5] 
sage: pts([1,1,3]) 
[1, 2, 3] 
```

Volker Braun also points out 

```
sage: Permutation([3,2])  # invalid one-line notation 
[3, 2] 
sage: _.cycle_string() 
<boom>
```

Now it makes a copy of the list and modifies that copy.

The second issue should be handled by #8392 since an invalid permutation is passed in.
