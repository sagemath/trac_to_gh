I just installed a fresh GiNaC on my computer and I've been able to reproduce the bug:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <ginac/ginac.h>

using namespace std;
using namespace GiNaC;

int main()
{
  symbol x("x");
  ex poly;

  poly = sqrt(x*x+1)*sqrt(x+1);

  cout << poly << endl;
  cout << poly.is_polynomial(x) << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
gives

```
sqrt(1+x^2)*sqrt(1+x)
1
```

So I subscribed to ginac mailing list and reported the bug here. I'm waiting for an answer.

From the Ginac mailing list:

```
Hi everybody,

GiNaC 1.6.0 is out and available. You can find the changes at the end
of this email.

Note:
This release is not binary compatible to the previous one.
Also, we changed the name of the library filename from libginac-1.5 to
libginac. The ABI versioning is now done in recommended libtool
manner. The dynamic library will be created as libginac.so.2.0.0 this
time.
We also stopped to create extra branches in the repository for ABI
compatible versions. The latest releases will from now on always be in
master.

Changes:
[...]
* Fixed a bug in is_polynomial().
[...]
```
So we now "only" need to upgrade ginac.

There is no "fixed upstream and released" tag... I'm not sure if the current tag is correct.
Florent
