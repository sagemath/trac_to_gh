Let C be a category. `C.all_super_categories()` starts with `C.super_categories()` and finds all super categories inductively. 

Unfortunately, the algorithm of `C.all_super_categories()` does not comply with the C3 algorithm, that is used by Python to determine the method resolution order for `C.parent_class` and `C.element_class`. 

The aim of this ticket is to be more consistent. Eventually, for any category C (perhaps with modifications for hom categories), one should have

```
sage: C.parent_class.mro() == [X.parent_class for X in C.all_super_categories()] + [object]
True
sage: C.element_class.mro() == [X.element_class for X in C.all_super_categories()] + [object]
True
```
and that test should become part of the test suite.

At #11900, the implementation of `all_super_categories()` has been changed, so, work should rely on #11900.

Unfortunately, it seems that the C3 algorithm can not simply be imported from Python, even though Python uses it internally, namely in `Objects/typeobject.c`. Looking at the implementation, it requires that one gets a list of types, while we want to use it on a list of objects.

Therefore, we need to implement C3 from scratch. Implementing C3 is easy, but if it shall be fast, one needs to be careful.

In particular, one needs to be able to `L.pop(0)` quickly, where L is a list. Unfortunately, `L.pop(0)` is slow, even in Cython. I found that, if the lists are not too long, it is best to revert L and do `L.pop()` instead, which is optimized in Cython. See the discussion at [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/317aecee64ddab48).

What my patch does:

* Provide the C3 algorithm in a new extension module `sage.misc.c3`
* Use it to compute `all_super_categories()`
* Add a test `_test_category_graph`, asserting that `self.parent_class.mro()` and `self.all_super_categories()` are compatible.

Thus, apparently, that category has never been used.

The problem is that the super categories of the category of algebra ideals should be the category of algebra modules. However, while the former accepts non-commutative algebras, the latter wants to see commutative algebras.

The clean way to proceed would be: Make algebra modules work over non-commutative rings. If that is too much of work, C.super_categories() should be `[]` if C is the category of algebra ideals over a non-commutative rings.

Patch's up!

To my surprise, the change in the order of super categories was relatively harmless. In few cases, a test involving all_super_categories had to change.

I added a test `_test_category_graph` to the Test Suite of categories. By that test, I found one bug in algebra_ideals, which I fixed. Hom categories can not use the new test yet, since it tests the mro of the parent class against the list of parent classes of all super categories - which is fairly inconsistent for hom categories. That is already a "to do", and should be part of the next category overhaule.

Apart from these small changes, all doc tests passed! In particular, I did not need to change `super_categories` (except for algebra ideals): The current category graph seems to be consistent!!

That was the good news.

The bad news is that we have a regression in the computation of `all_super_categories`. With #11900, we have

```
sage: L = [Algebras(GF(p)) for p in prime_range(10000)]
sage: %time X = [C.all_super_categories() for C in L]
CPU times: user 0.74 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.75 s
Wall time: 0.75 s
```
With the patches from here added, we only have

```
sage: L = [Algebras(GF(p)) for p in prime_range(10000)]
sage: %time X = [C.all_super_categories() for C in L]
CPU times: user 1.06 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 1.07 s
Wall time: 1.08 s
```

I tried hard to make my C3 implementation as fast as possible in the range we need: few lists (say, 4) of moderate length (not more than 60).

I think the performance should be improved. But a review can already be started.

+1. Actually my patch on #10963 is adding a TODO about it :-)

I am not so surprised, since most categories are actually used by some
parent (which detects any incompatibility). But it's very nice to
detect such incompatibilities earlier on and to catch them
systematically in the TestSuite!

I tried to track down the regression of `all_super_categories`. Recall that my patch from #11900 did improve the implementation of `all_super_categories`, but did not change the algorithm.

With #11900, the main work is done in `_all_super_categories_raw`. With the patch from here, the work is done in `c3_algorithm` - and according to %prun, *less* time is spent in `c3_algorithm` than it was in `_all_super_categories_raw`. However, more time is spent in the expression

```
C.all_super_categories() for C in self.super_categories()
```
I guess I have to improve the implementation of the recursion.

I have created a more invasive patch: It turns `C.super_categories()` and `C.all_super_categories(proper)` into lazy attributes, and it uses the C3 algorithm in a more efficient way.

The two patches are alternative. Personally, I prefer the second patch. If the reviewer disagrees and suggests to use the first patch, I'd like to add one improvement to the first patch. If the reviewer agrees with me, then eventually either this patch or the patch from #11935 needs to be rebased.

I just tested that all doctests pass, with sage-4.7.2.alpha3+#11900+the second patch from here.

And here are some timings:
With just #11900:

```
king@mpc622:/mnt/local/king/SAGE/rebase/sage-4.7.2.alpha3$ time ./sage elltest1.sage

real    0m18.089s
user    0m17.633s
sys     0m0.344s
king@mpc622:/mnt/local/king/SAGE/rebase/sage-4.7.2.alpha3$ time ./sage ellbsd.sage

real    0m5.578s
user    0m5.084s
sys     0m0.400s
```
and

```
sage: L = [Algebras(GF(p)) for p in prime_range(10000)]
sage: %time X = [C.all_super_categories() for C in L]
CPU times: user 0.72 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.72 s
Wall time: 0.73 s
```

With #11900+the second patch from here:

```
king@mpc622:/mnt/local/king/SAGE/rebase/sage-4.7.2.alpha3$ time ./sage elltest1.sage

real    0m17.799s
user    0m17.333s
sys     0m0.384s
king@mpc622:/mnt/local/king/SAGE/rebase/sage-4.7.2.alpha3$ time ./sage ellbsd.sage

real    0m5.408s
user    0m4.956s
sys     0m0.376s
```
and

```
sage: L = [Algebras(GF(p)) for p in prime_range(10000)]
# all_super_categories is lazy now, we are not calling it
sage: %time X = [C.all_super_categories for C in L]
CPU times: user 0.54 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.54 s
Wall time: 0.54 s
```

Note an additional doc test, demonstrating that the new version of all_super_categories can detect inconsistencies:

```
sage: class X(Category):
...    @lazy_attribute
...    def super_categories(self):
...        return [Objects()]
sage: class X(Category):
...    @lazy_attribute
...    def super_categories(self):
...        return [Objects()]
sage: class Y(Category):
...    @lazy_attribute
...    def super_categories(self):
...        return [Objects()]
sage: class A(Category):
...    @lazy_attribute
...    def super_categories(self):
...        return [X(),Y()]
sage: class B(Category):
...    @lazy_attribute
...    def super_categories(self):
...        return [Y(),X()]
sage: class Foo(Category):
...    @lazy_attribute
...    def super_categories(self):
...       return [A(),B()]
sage: F = Foo()
```
Python is not able to create a consistent mro for the parent class - and all_super_categories detects that inconsistency as well:

```
sage: F.parent_class
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Cannot create a consistent method resolution
order (MRO) for bases X.parent_class, Y.parent_class
sage: F.all_super_categories
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Can not merge the items Category of x, Category of y.
```

Of course, there still is the new consistency test for the category graph in the test suite.

So, it can really be reviewed now, and my suggestion is:

Apply trac11943_mro_for_all_super_categories_lazy.patch

There was no reply on sage-combinat-devel and only little reply on sage-devel: The only reply was Jason Grout stating that the use of attributes is often more pythonic than the use of a method.

So, the idea to turn super_categories and all_super_categories into lazy attributes is supported.

[Maarten](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/ab03a0d422810e73) suggested the following:

```
What I think would be the best solution in this case would be is:

make lazy attributes

_super_categories and
_all_super_categories

Make the functions super_categories and all_super_categories say in the
documentation that developers shouldn't use these but that they should use
the lazy attributes.
```

I think that this would be a very good solution indeed.

I think the following model is best for preserving backwards compatibility:

* If one wants to provide the super categories of a category, one should implement a method super_categories() - this is what one would currently do.
* There is a new lazy attribute _super_categories defined for the base class of categories. That lazy attribute calls the method super_categories(). Of course, calling the method happens only once, so that the speed is acceptable.
* In all *applications*, the method call super_categories() shall be replaced by getting the attribute _super_categories. That is explained in a note to the developers in the documentation of super_categories.
* There is a lazy attribute _all_super_categories and _all_super_categories_proper, and there is still a method all_super_categories(proper=False). The method returns the appropriate lazy attribute, and the documentation of the method states that one should better use the lazy attributes.

    "body": "<a id='comment:12'></a>\nI have changed my patch according to what I learnt from the discussion on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/ab03a0d422810e73). Namely:\n\n* I preserved the old methods `super_categories` and `all_super_categories`, so that the users can still work with them and can read their documentation. \n* In particular, if one wants to define a new category, one would still define a *method* (no need for a cached method) called `super_categories` that returns the immediate super categories. However, the documentation now also states that internally (i.e., for development), the new lazy attributes explained below should be used.\n* The patch introduces three lazy attributes `_super_categories`, `_all_super_categories` and `_all_super_categories_proper` that carry the lists of (immediate or all) super categories. If one asks for the super categories in code, the fastest way is to request these lazy attributes, not calling the old methods.\n\nAnyway, why do I see a need to make things faster? Recall that the purpose of this ticket is to order the list of all super categories according to Python's method resolution order, i.e., the C3 algorithm.

I have changed my patch according to what I learnt from the discussion on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/ab03a0d422810e73). Namely:

* I preserved the old methods `super_categories` and `all_super_categories`, so that the users can still work with them and can read their documentation. 
* In particular, if one wants to define a new category, one would still define a *method* (no need for a cached method) called `super_categories` that returns the immediate super categories. However, the documentation now also states that internally (i.e., for development), the new lazy attributes explained below should be used.
* The patch introduces three lazy attributes `_super_categories`, `_all_super_categories` and `_all_super_categories_proper` that carry the lists of (immediate or all) super categories. If one asks for the super categories in code, the fastest way is to request these lazy attributes, not calling the old methods.

Anyway, why do I see a need to make things faster? Recall that the purpose of this ticket is to order the list of all super categories according to Python's method resolution order, i.e., the C3 algorithm. I did my very best to implement the C3 algorithm as fast as possible. However:

* When I keep super_categories() what they are, then even my best attempt to implement all_super_categories based on C3 resulted in a mild regression.
* When I keep super_categories() what they are (namely cached methods) and use #11115, then there is neither a regression nor a speed-up.
* When I replace super_categories() by _super_categories (a lazy attribute), then I am getting a speed-up, even without #11115.

Here are the data. I've run `sage -t devel/sage/sage/schemes/` and found these total running times:

* 620.7 seconds with sage-4.7.3.alpha3
* 600.1 seconds with sage-4.7.3.alpha3 and #11943 (plus dependencies)

That's not much (3.3% speedup), but certainly better than a regression.

As for any reasonable programming language, Python allows to
completely disable assertion tests, to encourage the programmer to put
more safety guards and write programmatically his
preconditions/assertions/..., knowing that in production there won't
be any penalty.  Alas, this can't be done on the fly like in MuPAD for
switching between debugging and full speed computation modes inside a
given session (a feature I loved). Still this can be achieved in
principle on a new session by passing -O to the Python
interpreter. Maybe we should add this option to the Sage script
itself.

In that particular case, I guess I once met a bug where something was
passed to is_subcategory which was not a category, so I felt safer
with the assertion test.

I don't remember anymore why I did a special case for join categories,
so +1.

Hence, unexpected things can only happen if c is not a category but is equal to a category, or if `self.super_categories()` contains something that is not a category.\n \n> > So, my next patch version will remove these lines, provided that doc tests pass.\n\n> \n> I don't remember anymore why I did a special case for join categories,\n> so +1.\n\nI have just attached a new version of my patch. I used several techniques to speed up `is_subcategory`.\n\nIn particular, I rely on the hypothesis that if a category C1 has a base (ring) and is super-category of C2, then C2 must have the same base (ring). Hence, if the base rings differ or C2 has no base ring then we can very quickly conclude that C1 is not a super-categoriy of C2.\n\nThis turns out to be very helpful in elliptic curve computations.

Dear Nicolas,

But I think, in this particular case, nothing nasty can happen.

Ultimately, it is tested whether the argument c belongs to the list of all super categories of `self`. Hence, unexpected things can only happen if c is not a category but is equal to a category, or if `self.super_categories()` contains something that is not a category.

I have just attached a new version of my patch. I used several techniques to speed up `is_subcategory`.

In particular, I rely on the hypothesis that if a category C1 has a base (ring) and is super-category of C2, then C2 must have the same base (ring). Hence, if the base rings differ or C2 has no base ring then we can very quickly conclude that C1 is not a super-categoriy of C2.

This turns out to be very helpful in elliptic curve computations. Namely, it often suffices to study the base rings, so that it is not needed to construct the list of all super categories.

By consequence, I needed to introduce a `base()` method for various settings. For example, tensor products preserve the base. And for join categories, I argue: If `C = JoinCategory((C1,C2,...))` then `C.base()` should be the first answer that one obtains by walking through the list `C1.base(), C2.base(),...`.

I think this makes sense in the intended application: By #9138, polynomial rings over F belong to a join category of a base-free category (unique factorization domains) and a category with base F (F-algebras). 


The code of is_subcategory is now (with some comments added):

```python
# No cached method, currently
    def is_subcategory(self, c):
        if c is self:  # short path for a common case
            return True
        if isinstance(c, JoinCategory):
            return all(self.is_subcategory(x) for x in c._super_categories)
        try:
            # If the lazy attribute has already been computed, then we do not
            # need to bother about the categories having bases.
            # Here, the trick is that we look in self.__dict__, so that we do
            # not trigger computation of self._set_of_super_categories, if it has
            # not been done before.
            return c in self.__dict__['_set_of_super_categories']
        except KeyError:
            pass
        # In elliptic curves, one often has categories over different base rings.
        # Thus, as a short-path, we compare the base rings first, before we try
        # to compute the set of all super-categories.
        try:
            cbase = c.base()
        except (AttributeError, TypeError, NotImplementedError):
            cbase = None
        if cbase is not None:
            try:
                selfbase = self.base()
            except (AttributeError, TypeError, NotImplementedError):
                selfbase = None
            if selfbase is not cbase:
                return False
        # Now, the only remaining thing to do is to look at the super categories.
        # Looking it up in a (frozen) set is quickest:
        return c in self._set_of_super_categories
```

With the new patch, all long doctests pass - needs review!

I am now attending a lecture and will try to provide some timings afterwards.

False
```

`base()` provides a speed-up in an important application: Polynomial rings over F. In that situation, one has a join category that clearly should have a base, namely F. So, perhaps one should add an optional parameter `base=None` to the construction of a join category.

So, one could have something like

```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: P.category()
Join over Rational Field of Category of unique factorization domains and Category of commutative algebras over Rational Field
sage: P.category().base()
Rational Field
```
and at the same time

```
sage: C = Category.join([Algebras(GF(5)),Modules(ZZ)])
sage: print C.base()
None
```

What do you think?

And analysing it, using prun and so on, it turned out that really a lot of time has been spent on computing the list of all super categories. The problem is that caching the list of super categories does not really help, since one has many different categories (of algebras, for example) over different base fields.

But now that you mention it: It could be that the remark in the code above

        # Thus, as a short-path, we compare the base rings first, before we try

```
is misleading. 

The code is supposed to recognise very quickly that a category with base is not contained in a category with a different base. I am afraid I can not show you the original example that made me suggest this bit of code. However, here are some examples showing that it helps.

With the base test (each example being in a new session):

```
sage: L = [GF(p)['x','y'] for p in prime_range(5000)]
sage: C = CommutativeRings()
# here the test is not used - this is to show that there is almost no regression
sage: %time [X in C for X in L] 
CPU times: user 0.29 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.29 s
Wall time: 0.29 s
```

```
sage: L = [GF(p)['x','y'] for p in prime_range(5000)]
sage: D = Modules(ZZ)
sage: %time [X in D for X in L]
CPU times: user 0.06 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.06 s
Wall time: 0.06 s
```

With the base test commented out:

```
sage: L = [GF(p)['x','y'] for p in prime_range(5000)]
sage: C = CommutativeRings()
sage: %time [X in C for X in L]
CPU times: user 0.26 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.26 s
Wall time: 0.27 s
```

```
sage: L = [GF(p)['x','y'] for p in prime_range(5000)]
sage: D = Modules(ZZ)
sage: %time [X in D for X in L]
CPU times: user 0.28 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.28 s
Wall time: 0.28 s
```

So, if base rings are involved then the test is much faster, and if no base rings are involved, the test is not much slower.

> I am afraid I can not show you the original example that made me suggest this bit of code.

Now I remember the story.

By #9138, we have that the category of a polynomial ring is the join of a category of algebras with a base-free algebra, for example:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: P.category()
Join of Category of unique factorization domains and Category of commutative algebras over Integer Ring
```

Originally, that category has been computed via

```
sage: Category.join([UniqueFactorizationDomains(), CommutativeAlgebras(ZZ)])
Join of Category of unique factorization domains and Category of commutative algebras over Integer Ring
```

But that turned out to be a problem for elliptic curve computations:

* In the benchmarks discussed on #11900, polynomial rings over many different finite fields are constructed.
* For each of them, `Category.join(...)` was called.
* Internally, `Category.join(...)` tests whether the categories to be joined are sub-categories of each other.
* Hence, for each prime p, one had to compute `CommutativeAlgebras(GF(p)).all_super_categories()`, in order to test whether it is a sub-category of `UniqueFactorizationDomains()`.

In fact, that was the main reason for the speed regression from #9138.

For fixing it, I had (at least) the following two ideas:

1. Do not call `Category.join(...)`, but construct `JoinCategory(...)` directly. Advantage: `JoinCategory.__init__` does not test for sub-categories. So, no time is wasted.
2. When testing `UniqueFactorizationDomains().is_subcategory(CommutativeAlgebras(F))`, one does not need to waste time by computing `CommutativeAlgebras(F).all_super_categories()`. The fact that `UniqueFactorizationDomains()` has no base ring suffices  to recognise that it is not a sub-category.

In #11900, I went for the first approach. Here, I'd like to also add the second approach. It is not needed for fixing an existing regression, but I still think it is a good idea.

Here is an example for what I have explained:

We start with a list of categories of algebras over different finite fields. The aim is to compute the join with the category of unique factorization domains.

```
sage: L = [CommutativeAlgebras(GF(p)) for p in prime_range(5000)]
sage: C = UniqueFactorizationDomains()
```

With sage-4.6.2 (as an old reference):

```
sage: %time X = [Category.join([C,A]) for A in L]
CPU times: user 0.65 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.65 s
Wall time: 0.65 s
```

With sage-4.7.2.alpha3 (hence, with #9138, but without #11900):

```
sage: L = [CommutativeAlgebras(GF(p)) for p in prime_range(5000)]
sage: C = UniqueFactorizationDomains()
sage: %time X = [Category.join([C,A]) for A in L]
CPU times: user 0.76 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.77 s
Wall time: 0.77 s
```

With unpatched sage-4.7.3.alpha1 (which contains #11900):

```
sage: %time X = [Category.join([C,A]) for A in L]
CPU times: user 0.59 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.60 s
Wall time: 0.61 s
```

With sage-4.7.3.alpha1 plus the patch from here (thus, using base rings):

```
sage: %time X = [Category.join([C,A]) for A in L]
CPU times: user 0.39 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.39 s
Wall time: 0.39 s
```

Believe it or not, but that kind of differences had a noticeable effect, as I found out while working on #11900.

**__Conclusion__**

I still believe that one should exploit the base of a category for short-cuts in subcategory tests.

Replying to [@koffie](#comment%3A25):

I think it does, to some extent. If C is a category with a base B, then all its objects are supposed to have this base B as well. If you form a join J of C with another category, then all objects of J are also objects of C and thus have the base B.

It only starts to lack logic if you join categories with distinct bases.

But if you join a list of categories such that at least one of them has base B and all other categories on the list either have no base at all or have the base B as well, then I think it is alright to say that the join has base B.

> The second thing is that I don't like the way how the code is organized right now in is_subclass. ... I think it is better to provide a truly generic implementation in combination with something like a `__subclasshook__`

One could argue that `super_categories()` alreay plays the role of `__subclasshook__`: It determines how different categories are contained in one another, and is used in a generic method `Category.is_subcategory`.

But I agree that it is conceivable that `JoinCategory` or `Category_over_base` could benefit from using a specialised method for detecting subcategories.

Yes, you are right! Even though a while ago I did some experiments with the ABC module, I forgot that one is registering sub-classes, not super-classes. Sorry.

Let me see. When we do `A.is_subcategory(B)` then *with or without my patch* we make a special case when B is a join category. With my patch, we also make a special case when B has a base - and actually what we *really* want is a special case for `Category_over_base` (recall the original use case, where A is the category of unique factorization domains and B is a category of algebras). 

So, it seems like a good idea that both `JoinCategory` and `Category_over_base` and perhaps also `TensorProductsCategory` get a method `subcategory_hook`, and that `Category.is_subcategory` then looks as follows:

```python
def is_subcategory(self, C):
    try:
        return C.subcategory_hook(self)
    except AttributeError:
        return C in self._set_of_super_categories
```

Of course, one should add a comment about the new "magical" method into the docs.

Is that what you suggested?

I have added Maarten's idea of a `_subcategory_hook_` and documented it. The subcategory hook is used for `Category_over_base` (hence, it is not needed to check for the existence of a base() attribute).

Moreover, in order to keep the generic implementation of `is_subcategory` clean, I provided `JoinCategory` with a specialised `is_subcategory`.

The documentation looks fine to me, and all tests pass. Needs review!

I have replaced the `base()` method of Cartesian products by a `base_ring()` method. I think it holds true that if some category has a base ring then all cartesian products of its objects have the same base ring. This may be not so sure when doing the same with a general bases.

I did not run full doctests yet, but the original example that made me introduce the `base()` method in #11900 is still working:

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: P in Algebras(QQ)
True
sage: P.category()
Join of Category of unique factorization domains and Category of commutative algebras over Rational Field
```

Benchmark, for avoiding to return to the old regression:

```
sage: %time L = EllipticCurve('960d1').prove_BSD()
CPU times: user 3.78 s, sys: 0.08 s, total: 3.86 s
Wall time: 4.10 s
```
#11935 will make this even faster.

The patch is updated, and with it all tests should pass.

The patch uses the `_subcategory_hook_` mechanism, which will make it easier in #11935 to cope with the case of shared parent classes. However, for now, the default `_subcategory_hook_`, which tests whether one parent class is subclass of the other, is actually sufficient to determine subcategories, with the only exception of join categories.

Needs review, I'd say!

*If* this ticket is close to being finished, then merging the three together would be a good idea. I am not sure how much work needs to be done, in particular since Nicolas seems to have problems building sage-4.8.alpha3.

Anyway, it does need work since a couple of hunks do not apply when starting with sage-4.8.alpha3 and applying the latest patch version from #11900 (namely the one that does not use Category_singleton for Finite*, which Nicolas seems to prefer).

I have updated the patch.

Concerning the `base()` method for Cartesian products: If I remember correctly, Nicolas and I agreed that it is ok to have a `base_ring()` method for Cartesian products (meaning: If a category is defined over a base ring then the category of Cartesian products of objects in that category is defined over the same base ring). Thus, the patch renames the method.

The patch should work on top of the positively reviewed patch from #11900.

Not necessarily.

The main reason for having super_categories cached was speed: One wouldn't like to create the list of super categories repeatedly. However, with my patch, it is cached in a different way, namely as an attribute, and that's even faster than a cached method.

In fact, i is kind of courtesy: Before, if the user forgot to use `@`cached_method then it became slower. Now, it doesn't matter whether or not the user knows of `@`cached_method.

From that point of view, it doesn't matter whether the cached_method decorator is systematically removed or not. With perhaps one exception: Calling a cached method hundred times takes shorter than calling a non-cached method hundred times. But calling the cached method just once takes longer than calling a non-cached method just once.

Hence, I could imagine that in the following setting, using my patch without cached_method would be noticeable faster than using my patch with cached_method (but I hope that using cached_method with my patch will still be slower than using cached_method without my patch...):

- Create many different categories
- For each pair C1,C2, determine whether one is subcategory of the other

I intend to try and provide an example. But I am having trouble with my mercurial queue.

To my great surprise, using cached method seems to be *faster*, even with my patch:

```
sage: class MyCat1(Category):
....:     def __init__(self, R):
....:         self.R = R
....:         Category.__init__(self)
....:     def super_categories(self):
....:         return [Algebras(self.R)]
....:     
sage: class MyCat2(Category):
....:     def __init__(self, R):
....:         self.R = R
....:     @cached_method
....:     def super_categories(self):
....:         return [Algebras(self.R)]
....:     
sage: L1 = [MyCat1(GF(p)) for p in prime_range(10000)]
sage: L2 = [MyCat2(GF(p)) for p in prime_range(10000)]
sage: def test_cats(L):
....:     for A in L:
....:         for B in L:
....:             A.is_subcategory(B)
....:             
sage: %time test_cats(L1)
CPU times: user 3.53 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 3.56 s
Wall time: 3.58 s
sage: %time test_cats(L2)
CPU times: user 2.35 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 2.36 s
Wall time: 2.36 s
```

Of course, as soon as the super categories are obtained and put in the cache, there is no difference anymore:

```
sage: %time test_cats(L1)
CPU times: user 2.17 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 2.17 s
Wall time: 2.18 s
sage: %time test_cats(L2)
CPU times: user 2.15 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 2.16 s
Wall time: 2.16 s
```

So, after all: Yes, I do not insist on removing all cached_method decorators on the super_categories methods, but I still think removing them would be better aesthetically.

For the record: I have already slightly rebased your patch on top of #7980 (multiple realizations) which conflicted and is almost positive review.

Thanks for your comments. I'll see if I keep the cached_methods in there or not depending on how the conflict resolution goes.

Ah one thing: for all the attributes like _all_super_categories, shouldn't we use tuples rather than lists for safety?

Well, they used to be lists (and were cached).

If I remember correctly, I tried at some point whether a tuple would be better, but it was too slow. I think the reason was that during the creation of the list of all super categories, one would naturally operate with lists, and the transformation of the final list into a tuple was too time consuming in some elliptic curve computations.

If you like, I could try again, but probably only in a couple of days.

Ok; let's postpone this to a later patch. I'll just mention that the
lazy attributes will probably become tuples at some point.

On another note: why not systematically build _set_of_super_categories
as frozenset(_all_super_categories_proper) and
_all_super_categories_proper as _all_super_categories[1:]? Otherwise
it seems likely that C3 could often be called three times for a single
given category.

Besides C3_algorithm_set and the proper option would not be needed in
that case, and the overall logic be simplified a bit.

Cheers,
                Nicolas

Hi Simon,

I have finished my review. I'll push shortly my reviewer's patch on the Sage-Combinat queue

http://combinat.sagemath.org/patches/file/tip/trac11943_mro_for_all_super_categories_lazy_hook-review-nt.patch

Overall, I am happy with it, and it's almost good to go if you are happy with my changes. Thanks for your hard work!

Just two little details:

* in covariant_functorial_construction.py, the method is_subcategory is not documented, and I am not sure why it is required. Please remove, or add documentation and tests with a comment on the rationale for this method

* in the C3 algorithm: Cython knows that ``tails`` is a list, so one would assume that tails[i] is optimized. Is it really faster to use PyList_GET_ITEM(tails,i) rather than just tails[i]? Otherwise, please use the later which is more readable. Same thing for the other PyList_*.

Once those are done, and it is confirmed that all tests pass (I am running them), you can set a positive review on my behalf (I'll be away for the week-end).

Happy easter!
                                    Nicolas

As far as I remember, all I did to this patch was, as discussed, to remove the hunks that were removing "cached_method"'s on those super_categories methods that are going to disapear with #10963 anyway. That to make the rebase of #10963 easier.

On 5.0.beta13, I was getting a random doctest failure due to the order
of the classes changing in Python's error message about MRO's:

```
File "/home/nthiery/sage-5.0.beta13/devel/sage-combinat/sage/misc/c3.pyx", line 81:

The updated patch uses "..." instead of X and Y.
