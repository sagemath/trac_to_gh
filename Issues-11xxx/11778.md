The following code

```
from sage.parallel.use_fork import p_iter_fork

def f(n):
    print "Entering f with n=%s" % n 
    X = p_iter_fork(1, verbose=True)
    iter_result = X(g, [((n,), {})])
    result = list(iter_result)[0][1]
    print "Leaving f with n=%s" % n
    return result  # Which is just n
    
def g(n):
    print "Inside g with n=%s" % n
    return n
    
def test():
    X = p_iter_fork(2, verbose=True)
    inputs = [((n,), {}) for n in range(5)]
    iter_result = X(f, inputs)
    for n in iter_result:
        pass  

test()
```
gives this output (perhaps in a different order):

```
Entering f with n=1
Entering f with n=1
Inside g with n=1
Leaving f with n=1
Entering f with n=0
Entering f with n=0
Inside g with n=0
Leaving f with n=0
Entering f with n=2
Entering f with n=2
Inside g with n=2
Leaving f with n=2
Entering f with n=3
Entering f with n=3
Inside g with n=3
Leaving f with n=3
Entering f with n=4
Entering f with n=4
Inside g with n=4
Leaving f with n=4
```
The point is that stdout isn't flushed before the process is forked and therefore its contents are copied to the child process as well and thus lives in 2 processes.

There's a typo (which was already there):
In "Killing subprocess %s with input %s which took too long" there should be a comma between the second %s and "which".

Okay, that was "mierenneuken" (you may want to look up that word); I'll have a more serious look it later on (don't have much time right now).

I'd say a comma there isn't absolutely necessary, but I should have added periods... (I saw that of course<sup>TM</sup> *after* I had committed my changes.)

Well, since "which" refers to a single subprocess, it is unambiguous.

(But you're in principle right, omitting the comma might be considered a bit sloppy, as the clause is non-restrictive from a *grammatical* point of view. I'd say it *is* restrictive, or constraining, from a logical point of view though, as the subprocess wouldn't have been killed in that situation otherwise, i.e. if it had not taken too long.)

We could also change "*which* took too long" to "*because* it took too long"... :)
