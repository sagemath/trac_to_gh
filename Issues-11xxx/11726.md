At present, the implementation of univariate Laurent polynomials is (self-admittedly) in a sorry state:

```
    ############################################################
    # This should later get moved to an actual single variate  #
    # implementation with valuation tracking,                  #
    # but I don't want to right now.                           #
    ############################################################
    # We need to come up with a name for the inverse that is easy to search
    # for in a string *and* doesn't overlap with the name that we already have.
    # For now, I'm going to use a name mangling with checking method.
```

This should be fixed.

Here's a new version of the patch which applies on sage-5.12.beta5 and depends on #14261 (which is currently being reviewed). This also fixes many things that annoy me with when working with Laurent polynomials, it particular division and simplification in the fraction field.

For patchbot:

Apply: trac_11726-univariate_Laurent_polynomials-ts.patch​
