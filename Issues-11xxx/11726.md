At present, the implementation of univariate Laurent polynomials is (self-admittedly) in a sorry state:

```
    ############################################################
    # This should later get moved to an actual single variate  #
    # implementation with valuation tracking,                  #
    # but I don't want to right now.                           #
    ############################################################
    # We need to come up with a name for the inverse that is easy to search
    # for in a string *and* doesn't overlap with the name that we already have.
    # For now, I'm going to use a name mangling with checking method.
```

This should be fixed.
