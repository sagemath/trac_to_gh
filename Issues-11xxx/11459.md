This ticket concerns the following :

* Convert a ReST file into a worksheet file from the command line : `sage -rst2txt`.
* Convert a ReST file into a Sage worksheet from the command line : `sage -rst2sws`.
* Upload a ReST (.rst) file from the Notebook.
* Upload a .html file output from docutils rst2html on a ReST.
* Upload a `worksheet.html` file as those stored in the repository `~/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/home/admin` without having to change the extension to `.txt`.
* Add the class `docutilsHTMLProcessor` to the file `sagenb/notebook/docHTMLProcessor.py` which translates HTML file generated by docutils ``rst2html`` command into a worksheet text file. This class was inspired from the class `SphinxHTMLProcessor` already in the same Python file.
* Add the class `genericHTMLProcessor` to the same file which gathers all the common methods of the other two classes.
* Improve a lot the documentation of the file `sagenb/notebook/docHTMLProcessor.py` : it is now 100% doctest coveraged.

My motivation is that in general I wrote my own code using the Sage Code Convention where examples are formatted in ReST. The possibility of converting rst syntax to a worksheet would be nice. Also, ReST file is more fun to edit than the html/cells worksheet text file. It is also more versatile as it can be used to generate a web page or S5 presentation, etc. using docutils.

On my web page, I created a page [rst2sws](http://www.thales.math.uqam.ca/~labbes/Sage/rst2sws/) where I put an example of ReST file. Note that I managed to use MathJax to render the HTML output of docutils `rst2html` command.

Here is [my clone of the sage-flask-notebook](http://code.google.com/r/slabqc-flask/) where I my patch on the sage notebook will be available.

I am planning to make this script more clean during [Sage Days 31](http://wiki.sagemath.org/days31). I will upload patches as it gets better.

Related to : #10637 (Implement sage -sws2rst) and #10652.

I mentionned the idea on sage-devel in December 2010 [here](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/5d86874cd359e1a5/eda52be07a9fb994).

This is based on a script called `rst2notebook` I wrote in January 2011 available [on the Sage Combinat server](http://combinat.sagemath.org/hgwebdir.cgi/misc/file/ef17ccb37589/notebook2rst/).

By rst2notebook, I mean something different. I mean the worksheet txt file which is made of html code and `{{{`'s cells. I agree rst2notebook is confusing. Maybe `sage -rst2worksheet_txt` would be better?

By the way, I also implemented the `sage -rst2sws`. I still need to add some doctests and do some more testing before it needs review. I hope to get to that point by wednesday.

What about rst2txt?

Great! Except for the fact that I usually need to go the other direction - but of course those are also appearing.

Why BTW? I feel I am the only one that needs more the rst -> sws  way?! I write all my examples in ReST syntax in my personal code, that  might be why.

<a id='comment:16'></a>Salut!

Just to give an update about the status of the patches on this ticket :

1. trac11459_rst2notebook_sagenb-sl.patch : I was not able to export the patch once I qfinish it and pushed it on my branch on the sagenb google code. Hence, the patch available here do not have the very last modification I did just before I made qfinish. So if you are testing it, it would be better if you test my sagenb branch. Anyhow, I do not intend to change my sagenb branch. I believe it is ready for review.

Question for kini : How can I export the patch once it is qfinished (commited) so that I upload here the latest version?

2. trac11459_rst2notebook_localbin-sl.patch : The script needs work. I want to implement better options about escaping backslashes. I should be able to finish this in the next days during the week. Once this is done, I will change the status of this ticket to needs review.

I've rebased the scripts patch to Sage 5.0. Because the file formerly at `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-sage` is now at `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin/sage`, it had to be split into two patches.

The notebook patch will probably need to be rebased as well, but since we're doing development of sagenb on github now, it won't go here on trac. I'll see what I can do...

<a id='comment:27'></a>Hi Kini,

Thanks for looking at this!

I remember I wanted to remove the guillemets (") in the line of documentation of both scripts:

"..  escape-backslashes" 

Can you update your patch to do it, if you agree? I am sorry I never did it...

Is the new notebook now part of Sage ? If I want to test this ticket, should I install the latest sage-alpha or should I install the new sage-notebook?

Sébastien
