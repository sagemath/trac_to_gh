There is a long series of exercises on Sage Combinat queue which are used during Sage days. They should end in sage doc. Currently they need cleanup. 

**TODO**:

1. Check that we forgot no one in the list of authors

2. Put back the link to this tutorial in the object-oriented tutorial (see #8886)
