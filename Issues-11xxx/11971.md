Justin reports on sage-release:

```
Built from scratch on Mac OS X, 10.6.8 (Dual 6-Core Xeon) w/o problems.  Testing (ptestlong) yielded one failure:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The temporary doctesting directory
   /Users/justin/.sage/tmp/Zippo.local-33453
was not removed: it is not empty, presumably because doctests
failed or doctesting was interrupted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following tests failed:

sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/misc/getusage.py # 1 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
