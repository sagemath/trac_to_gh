Justin reports on sage-release:

```
Built from scratch on Mac OS X, 10.6.8 (Dual 6-Core Xeon) w/o problems.  Testing (ptestlong) yielded one failure:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The temporary doctesting directory
   /Users/justin/.sage/tmp/Zippo.local-33453
was not removed: it is not empty, presumably because doctests
failed or doctesting was interrupted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following tests failed:

sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/misc/getusage.py # 1 doctests failed

`EXAMPLES:` should now be `EXAMPLES::` (i.e., with a double-colon).

The program names (`prstat` and `top` etc.) should be typeset in monospaced / typewriter font, i.e. for example <code>\`\`prstat\`\`</code> instead of `'prstat'`.

I can't now reproduce the doctest failure; maybe cosmic rays are to blame.

In any case, the doctests all pass with the patch applied; the changes seem reasonable.
