I don't understand what is meant by ""explode" the solution". Is this a slider which would bring the size of the cube from 0 to 1 ? It doesn't not seem that nice to me.

Sebastien,

Sorry to be so tardy on this one.  Really just one "issue" that I think needs attention.  

Made a reviewer patch:  Changed some module and class links in documentation to be active, fixed a couple minor English language things.  Do **not** list me as an author for these.

The animations are great.  Can you do something to mark the end (like a few blank frames, for maybe a half-second)?  It goes so fast, it is hard to tell where the start is and where the end is.

Related Questions:
1.  Pentamino 8 (a yellow one) still has a hole in it.  Not a big deal, but perhaps a symptom of something that should be done more carefully?
2.  I feel bad to bring this up, since I suggested it.  The "size" parameter works fine for 0.5 < size < 1.0.  Proably size > 1.0 should raise an error.  Below size=0.5 the puzzle pieces seem to break into lots of individual cubes.  Also the hole in piece 8 seems to change according to size.  So I wonder if these first two items are related.
3.  In the 3D puzzle in the tiling module documentation, there are again holes in the pieces.
4.  Maybe each cube of a piece needs to be shrunk and translated, relative to some anchor point (the "corner" closest to the origin?).  I have not looked carefully enough to know if this what needs to be done.

Rob

No problem!

Good, thanks for those fixes! Is there a problem with one of the fixes ? Because there is a symbol tilde `~` that appears in front of one of the class path.

The delay between frames and the number of iterations are arguments of the method show (see `animate??`). I would keep the animation function as is, but add an exemple in the doctest of how to change those parameters and add blank frames at the end. What do you think?

Ok. I will think about it. Let me find a solution which will be better than the "cube in the middle" I am using up to now. Maybe using Simplicial Complexes of cubes, I could get the exact boundary of the piece? I take a look at it and comes back with a fix soon.

The tilde should suppress the `sage.combinat.tiling` prefix in the output.  Don't remember just why I did it that way there (I'm sure I had a reason at the time!) - but you should feel free to adjust it if you would rather have the fully-qualified name.

Perfect.

<a id='comment:23'></a>I just uploaded a new patch which applies over the precedent ones.

> The animations are great.  Can you do something to mark the end (like a few blank frames, for maybe a half-second)?  It goes so fast, it is hard to tell where the start is and where the end is.


I added a paragraph saying (copied from the animate doc string) :

```
    The ``show`` function takes arguments to specify the delay between        
    frames (measured in hundredths of a second, default value 20) and         
    the number of iterations (default value 0, which means to iterate         
    forever). To iterate 4 times with half a second between each frame::      
                                                                              
        sage: a.show(delay=50, iterations=4) # optional                       
```

I also fixed the methods `dlx_common_prefix_solutions` and `dlx_incremental_solutions` which were broken. That was maybe the reason why the animations were going so fast... So now, the following animation looks better and not too fast even with default parameters of the method show :

```python
sage: from sage.combinat.tiling import Polyomino, TilingSolver         
sage: y = Polyomino([(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0),(2,1)], color='cyan')     
sage: T = TilingSolver([y], box=(5,10), reusable=True, reflection=True)
sage: a = T.animate('incremental')
sage: a
Animation with 123 frames                 
sage: a.show()
```


>     1.  Maybe each cube of a piece needs to be shrunk and translated, relative to some anchor point (the "corner" closest to the origin?). 


Ok. So I implemented this solution (translation to origin, shrinked, translated back) and changed show2d and show3d methods accordingly. For the Quantumino, it looks great. The yellow pentamino number 8 do not have a hole anymore :

```python
sage: from sage.games.quantumino import show_pentaminos
sage: show_pentaminos()                                
```

Also, using size<0.5 does not create disconnected cubes :

```python
sage: from sage.games.quantumino import QuantuminoSolver            
sage: s = QuantuminoSolver(0).solve().next()
sage: s.show3d(size=0.3)
```

Although, I can not say that the proposed solution is perfect and always better than the precedent one. In the example below, there are no holes anymore which is good. But, the space between each piece is not uniform and it is even hard to find a size which will avoid the pieces to touch each other without being to far from each other:

```python
sage: from sage.combinat.tiling import Polyomino, TilingSolver              
sage: L = []                                                                
sage: L.append(Polyomino([(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)]))
sage: L.append(Polyomino([(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2)]))      
sage: L.append(Polyomino([(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,0),(1,1),(1,3)]))      
sage: L.append(Polyomino([(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,0),(1,3)]))            
sage: L.append(Polyomino([(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,0),(1,1)]))            
sage: L.append(Polyomino([(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,1),(1,2)]))            
sage: L.append(Polyomino([(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,1),(1,3)]))            
sage: L.append(Polyomino([(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,0),(1,1),(1,3)]))            
sage: L.append(Polyomino([(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2)]))            
sage: L.append(Polyomino([(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2)]))            
sage: T = TilingSolver(L, (8,8), reflection=True)                          
sage: solution = T.solve().next()                                          
sage: G = sum([piece.show2d(size=0.85) for piece in solution], Graphics()) 
sage: G.show(aspect_ratio=1)                                               
```

What do you think?

I change the way to show 2d polyomino. First, I reverted its drawing as it was before. Second, I added a boundary line. Thirdly, I made the edge between adjacent points smaller than before. This way, holes are more esthetic and natural : we accept them more easily.

You can see the result with this example :

```python
sage: from sage.combinat.tiling import Polyomino, TilingSolver                         
sage: L = []                                                                           
sage: L.append(Polyomino([(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)], 'yellow')) 
sage: L.append(Polyomino([(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2)], "black"))        
sage: L.append(Polyomino([(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,0),(1,1),(1,3)], "gray"))         
sage: L.append(Polyomino([(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,0),(1,3)],"cyan"))                
sage: L.append(Polyomino([(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,0),(1,1)],"red"))                 
sage: L.append(Polyomino([(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,1),(1,2)],"blue"))                
sage: L.append(Polyomino([(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,1),(1,3)],"green"))               
sage: L.append(Polyomino([(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,0),(1,1),(1,3)],"magenta"))             
sage: L.append(Polyomino([(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2)],"orange"))              
sage: L.append(Polyomino([(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2)],"pink"))                
sage: T = TilingSolver(L, (8,8), reflection=True)                          
sage: solution = T.solve().next()                                          
sage: G = sum([piece.show2d() for piece in solution], Graphics()) 
sage: G.show(aspect_ratio=1, axes=False)                                               
```

Or this animation :

```python
sage: a = T.animate()      #45 seconds     
sage: a                   
Animation with 328 frames 
sage: a.show()      # take some time like 2 minutes
```

Now, I am happy with the patch. Needs review!

I like all the changes (no holes!).  And the 2-D pieces look real nice.  I think this is ready to go - builds, passes long tests, nice documentation on 4.7.1.alpha4.  So positive review.

One patch needed a commit message, and since it was easy, I just rolled everything into one big "total" patch.  Still has Sebastian's name on it.

Nice work on a big project - this will be a great way to demonstrate backtracking (and dancing links).

No problem.  I knew Jeroen was busy merging patches, and I was busy rebasing some of my linear algebra stuff, so I wanted to "strike while the iron was hot."

My pleasure - it is a nice piece of work.  Feel free to cc me on other combinatorial goodness.

Best of luck with the upcoming addition to the family!

<a id='comment:37'></a>Just a note from my testing of 4.7.2.alpha2. I have no problem on a vanilla sage even with python 2.7 installed. However in sage-on-gentoo one test is failing

```
        .. NOTE::

            The DLX solver throws a Segmentation Fault when the
            number of rows is zero::

sage-on-gentoo goes BOOM at

```

With a SIGABRT 

```

We go BOOM in sage-on-gentoo for the reason stated in the notes (0 rows).

Would adding ` # not tested ` at the end of that line would be an acceptable fix ?

Should we open a ticket for it?
