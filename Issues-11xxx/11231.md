sage: R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', sparse=False)
sage: S = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', sparse=True)
sage: R
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: S
Sparse Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: R == S
True
sage: hash(R) == hash(S)
False
```

It's unclear what equality really means here...

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

In `5.5.rc0`, I get the following:

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', sparse=False)
sage: S = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', sparse=True)
sage: R
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: S
Sparse Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: R == S
False
sage: hash(R) == hash(S) # on a 32-bit VM
True
```
However this isn't a problem.

I've checked that, indeed, already Sage 5.4.1 gives this answer (different objects, same hash). And I would love to give a ticket a positive review (my first), so here we go...
