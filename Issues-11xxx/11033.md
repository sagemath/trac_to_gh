This ticket is motivated by #10994 and #11032.

The goals will be:

1. Remove automorphism_group_binary_code.

2. Fix permutation_automorphism_group as noted in #10994.

3. Use the dual code when appropriate.

Depends on #10871.

Applies fine to a 10.6.6 mac running 4.7.a1. Passes sage -testall. Code patches and docstrings in reference manual look good. 

Thanks Robert.
