As I remember we looked on it side by side looking on my computer, but I don't remember any patch. Also there isn't any trace of it in the log.

By the way, thanks for the review. 

Also please make sure not to break `trac_11407-list_clone_improve-fh.patch` in the queue. If reject happen, feel free to refresh the patch.
