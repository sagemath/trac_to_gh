If only you had cc'ed me... (I made my own "feature freeze" for the alpha3 by not looking at report 11 after I fetched all positively reviewed tickets, apparently right before these trivial documentation fixes got positive review; only watched the opening of new tickets.)

But I think I'll still get these two (#11801 and this one) into Sage 4.7.2.alpha3.

In case you're fixing further trivial / documentation issues during the next 36 hours (say), please cc me on such tickets.
