People are *always* asking how to get sequences of variables, like `a1,a2,a3,a4` or the like.  See [this ask.sagemath.org](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/611/implicitly-defining-a-sequence-of-variables) question, for example.

Jason Grout has an interesting possible solution that should find a home somewhere in Sage
(see [sage-support discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/GFJdjFvKCvo/discussion)).

Thanks, Burcin!  I must have missed this somehow.  

[Here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/indexed_expression.patch) is a link to the patch.

From that thread:

```
Note that GiNaC cannot take derivatives of indexed expressions. 
```
So that means one couldn't say that `diff(a[1],a[1])==1`?  That would seem to be unfortunate.

By the way, note that Jason was just trying to find a way to make lots of GiNaC variables.  I don't think that these approaches are necessarily that different - for instance, a class like Jason's for non-indexed, but still many, variables of similar names, would, be, useful. , , ,

Hi there,

As as said on sage-devel, I started to work on Burcin patch. My goal was to be
able to index a variable by **any** Sage object (eg: integers, group
element, matrices...). So I extended a little Burcin patch. Now I'm faced with
the problem that GiNaC indexed variable seems to have a not trivial semantic
that I don't understand at all. Moreover I don't know how to debug Cython /
C++ code so I'm quite stuck. Here is the problem I have.

To get it you should apply [attachment: indexed_expression-experimental-fh.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11576/indexed_expression-experimental-fh.patch.gz)
on a fresh Sage-4.7.2 install. Then I can

```
sage: m1 = matrix([1,2]); m1.set_immutable()
sage: m2 = matrix([2,1]); m2.set_immutable()
sage: a = x.ind[m1]; b = 2*x.ind[m2]
sage: a + a
2*x.[1 2]
sage: a + b
x.[1 2] + 2*x.[2 1]
```
which is, in my view very cool !

However strange thing has occurred under the hood, in particular for a strange
reason I don't understand Sage added the two matrices ! This is apparent in

```
sage: a = x.ind[Permutation([3,2,1])]; b = 2*x.ind[1]
sage: a+b
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To make thing crystal clear (I hope):

```
sage: class bla(SageObject):
...       def __add__(self, other):
...           print "Addition called"
sage: a, b = x.ind[m1],2*x.ind[m2]
sage: m1 = bla()
sage: m2 = bla()
sage: m1 + m2
Addition called
sage: m1*m2

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'bla' and 'bla'
```

WTF ! Why is it adding or multiplying my indices for nothing ! It is a problem
of Ginac ? of the wrapper ? or behind the chair and the screen ?

Any help greatly appreciated !

Cheers,

Florent

Allow me to throw my entry into the ring.

It's not nearly as ambitious as Burcin & Florent's patches, but it does scratch the itch that most people have, and it's working and tested already.

I just updated the patch, each of the individual class methods now have their own examples.




> A few questions, which may betray ignorance:  
> * Is it okay that we don't overwrite the global variables?  I like that in principle, but there is similar confusion at times with PolynomialRings that have an x which isn't in SR while `sage: x` still returns the symbolic `x`.  Just asking.



Having two different `x`-things floating around -- one a python variable and one a symbol name -- is a little bad, but clobbering them is in my opinion worse. Essentially what I'm trying to do is make this act like `SR.symbol()` instead of `SR.var()`.

The `symbol()` function leaves the variables alone:

```
sage: y = 7    
sage: SR.symbol('y')
y
sage: y
7
```

Now there's a symbol floating around somewhere called `y`, but it isn't the python variable. The alternative is, in my opinion, much worse:

```
sage: y = 7         
sage: var('y')
y
sage: y
y
```

You could argue that people expect that from `var()` these days, but they certainly wouldn't expect it from indexing some object. So this is what I **don't** want:

```
sage: y1 = 7             
sage: ys = SR.symbols('y')
sage: foo = ys[1]
sage: y1
y1
```

The user never even wrote 'y1' anywhere, so I think it's dangerous to overwrite it.




> * One thing I don't like, or need explanation for, is the confusion in multi-index situations between the string (not LaTeX) reps of `x_{1}_{1}` and `x_{11}`, which are apparently both `x11`.  It's almost *too* flexible, because you don't have to say how many indices there will be ahead of time - which is useful, of course, but there might have to be something with the reps.



You're right... my motivation was simply, "make it easy to create a bunch of symbols," but I don't like this:

```
sage: a = SR.symbols('a')
sage: bool(a[11] == a[1,1])
True
```

The next-best thing I can think of is to use underscores, like the latex representation. This makes everything a little uglier, but avoids the ambiguity. Thoughts?




> * Should `SymbolSequence` inherit from something?



I dunno. I think this is the first standalone class I've written for the sage library. Anyone know?

Yeah, I'm not sure either.  I'd appreciate input from people who actually *use* this stuff! I don't make such variable sequences in my own work.  I see your new patch, but it still looks like

a_1_2_3_4_5_6

Also, what do you know about the memory leak issue in [comment:4](#comment%3A4)?

Usually at least from `SageObject`, I guess.  Would `Symbol` be appropriate, or maybe not?  What generic methods would you want available to this class via inheritance that `Symbol` already has?  I guess each individual symbol has everything that `Symbol` has.

I'm not sure if anything is `_leaking_` here. Pynac stores a symbol lookup table, in order to give you the same variable if you ask for SR.symbol('x') twice. As you pass new strings to this function, the lookup table grows. Note that if you repeat the same loop, memory usage does not grow.

I agree that this is a good argument for using indexed variables from Pynac/GiNaC instead of trying to invent our own. Here are some numbers:

```

Apart from lack of documentation and tests, this patch provides the functionality discussed in this ticket. The main problem holding it up was the fact that it allows you to use arbitrary Python objects as indices, and these are not handled properly when the expression is being converted to Maxima.

> I just rebased the patch I was working on at the Sage days in Cernay.

With Sage 5.6.beta2:

```
patching file sage/libs/ginac.pxd
Hunk #2 FAILED at 101
```
The two lines with `dbgprint` are gone in beta2.

> Apart from lack of documentation and tests, this patch provides the functionality discussed in this ticket. The main problem holding it up was the fact that it allows you to use arbitrary Python objects as indices, and these are not handled properly when the expression is being converted to Maxima.

We could just disallow anything that didn't fit a number or regular expression with commas or something.

This patch is somewhat different also in that

```
raise NotImplementedError("don't know what to do with multiple indices yet!") 
```
and I have to say I do like being able to use slice notation directly on the variable.

Also,

```
sage: x.ind[2:6]
x.2
```
seems counterintuitive for a couple reasons - the dot suggests an attribute to me in Python, and where are the other indices?  I'm also not sure I like allowing indexing of non-variables, but that might be ignorance and fear speaking.  I just don't know what 

```
sage: ex.ind[p]
(x + 1).[2, 1, 3]
```
really means.

Oh, right. As Burcin pointed out, there's no leak, it's just creating symbols and they use up some memory. If you stick to the same symbols, memory usage won't grow.

I can see the value in being able to use arbitrary subscripts, but I also like being able to do the common case quickly and easily. `x.ind[1]` is a little weird, especially if we can't use multiple indices. I also don't think it makes much sense to subscript `SR(1).ind[5]` and have it display `1.5`.

Indeed. The issue is that once you can create sequences of symbols *easily*, people might start doing that more and hence memory footprint might become more of an issue.

Hence, a permanent memory cost for the creation of a new symbol is so hard to avoid that we should probably consider it unavoidable.

It would be nice if the permanent cost of a symbol sequence is only for the sequence, not for every member generated in it. Note that

```
for i in [1..10^8]:
    print sin(i)
```
does *not* explode in memory, because the entry `sin` in the symbol table gets combined with an *argument* `i` that varies. No further permanent entries are made. I bet that `Ginac` does something similar for its sequences of symbols (i.e., it probably stores a base symbol together with an index.

please see also the recent: #22813. the motivation is the 1st sentence of this ticket's description,

> People are always asking how to get sequences of variables, like a1,a2,a3,a4 or the like.

It has been suggested to not overwrite global variables as `var('a0 a1 a2')` would normally do, but instead return the tuple `a` without injection.

certainly less comprehensive than this ticket, but related. if i can partner with any of you, i'm willing to (try to) implement the updates needed for this one / to fix doctests.
