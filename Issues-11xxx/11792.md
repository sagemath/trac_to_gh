Also note #14202, which is orthogonal but also about qsieve, so it should be pointed out.

<a id='comment:5'></a>I think FLINT 2.3 provides a quadratic sieve implementation but only for two limbs integers.
See:
* https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/blob/trunk/qsieve/doc/qsieve.txt
So I guess the answer is currently no.
We'll have to wait until Bill or someone else ports the old code.

(FLINT 1.6 included a quadratic sieve to build as a separate executable, see:
* http://www.flintlib.org/flint-1.6.pdf, section 18, page 64;
as did FLINT 1.5.2 (latest version included in Sage):
* http://www.flintlib.org/flint-1.5.2.pdf, section 14, page 57.)
