```
sage: maxima(factorial(x) == 0).sage()
x != 0
```

Running the following two commands to change how factorials are printed in Maxima will fix this:

```
sage.calculus.calculus.maxima.eval(r":lisp (defun msize-factorial (x l r) (setq l (msize (cadr x) (revappend '(#\f #\a #\c #\t #\o #\r #\i #\a #\l #\() l) nil 'mparen 'mparen) r (list 1 #\) ) ) (list (+ (car l) (car r)) l r)) ")
sage.calculus.calculus.maxima.eval(r":lisp (defprop mfactorial msize-factorial grind)")
```

We should run these when the Maxima interface is started.

But wouldn't it be better to figure out a way to improve our interface rather than mess with Maxima?    After all, '!' only occurs in Maxima for factorial, so it should be possible to parse this correctly.  We'd have to grab whatever expression came before it, either in parentheses (which could have several levels) or a numeric type.   Hmm.

```
    def _equality_symbol(self):
        """
        Returns the equality symbol in Maxima.

        INPUT: none
        
        OUTPUT: string

        EXAMPLES::

             sage: maxima._equality_symbol()
             '='
             sage: var('x y')
             (x, y)
             sage: maxima(x == y)
             x=y
        """
        return '='

    def _inequality_symbol(self):
        """
        Returns the inequality symbol in Maxima.

        INPUT: none
        
        OUTPUT: string

        EXAMPLES::

             sage: maxima._inequality_symbol()
             '#'
             sage: maxima((x != 1))
             x#1
        """
        return '#'

```

Also, this is another good excuse to think about moving the Maxima parsing stuff out of the calculus file into one of the Maxima files where it belongs... like, it would make more sense to use the above code than do 

```

    s = s.replace("#","!=") # a lot of this code should be refactored somewhere...
``` 
like we currently do.

If you wanted to fix this on the Sage side of things, you'd need to make sage.misc.parser.Parser accept "#" as an inequality symbol.  This is because "x!=0" is ambiguous.

I posted the fix on the Maxima side since that was a change that the user could make to a running Sage and not have to patch it, etc.

Right.  But I was anticipating having the Sage translator in calculus.py turn "!" into " ! " or something like that.  

```
sage: x ! = 0
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<ipython console>", line 1
     x ! = Integer(0)
       ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
since in Maxima the exclamation point only means this.  Then one could somehow smartly turn "foo !" into "factorial(foo)", though as I say above it might be tricky determining what foo is.  

> I posted the fix on the Maxima side since that was a change that the user could make to a running Sage and not have to patch it, etc.

Yes, for ask.sagemath.org that is a good fix.  I'm just not sure I want to make such a change in Maxima - mightn't this change some internal behavior there?  Plus, we try not to fix upstream if it isn't really a bug.  More philosophical than practical, I agree :)

The proposed lisp function makes me cringe. Wouldn't

```
(defprop mfactorial nil grind)
```
be a bit more elegant? That simply removes `mfactorial`s special "grind" (maxima print) property, so that the default method of printing takes effect again.

This should be a quite safe change to make to maxima. We're doing much worse patching in the maxima_lib interface. Since "!" would be the only postfix operator, it's a bit of wasted effort to extend the parser to accept it.

However,\n\n```\nsage: sage.calculus.calculus.maxima.lisp(\"(remprop 'mfactorial 'grind)\")\n```\nand\n\n```\nsage: M=Maxima()\nsage: M.lisp(\"(remprop 'mfactorial 'grind)\")\n'\"\";\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n<sage-display>('\n```\nboth work, so there's a workaround.\n\nNote that we can use `remprop` to actually remove a property. In CL you have to work quite hard to see the difference between a NIL-valued property and a non-existent property. Most maxima symbols do not have a `GRIND` property, though, so perhaps removing it is the more proper thing to do. The `defprop` must be a Maxima macro, by the way. It's not standard CL. But then ... many parts of Maxima predate CL.",

Indeed. This only affects `display2d:false` printing. The nicer print modes (including latex) will print as usual:

```
(%i1) factorial(x);
(%o1)                                 x!
(%i2) :lisp (defprop mfactorial nil grind)
NIL
(%i2) factorial(x);
(%o2)                                 x!

```
Yes, maxima_lib doesn't perfectly mimmick the expect interface that way. Apparently we're not hooking into a part of the parser that accepts directives. However,

```
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.maxima.lisp("(remprop 'mfactorial 'grind)")
```
and

```
sage: M=Maxima()
sage: M.lisp("(remprop 'mfactorial 'grind)")
'"";\r\n\r\nT\r\n<sage-display>('
```
both work, so there's a workaround.

Note that we can use `remprop` to actually remove a property. In CL you have to work quite hard to see the difference between a NIL-valued property and a non-existent property. Most maxima symbols do not have a `GRIND` property, though, so perhaps removing it is the more proper thing to do. The `defprop` must be a Maxima macro, by the way. It's not standard CL. But then ... many parts of Maxima predate CL.

#14352 was a duplicate.  For reference:

```
sage: factorial(x) == 6                                                   
factorial(x) == 6
sage: _.simplify()
x != 6
bool((factorial(x) == 6).simplify().subs(x=2))
```

---

Since that put this on the radar again...  so, presumably all one would have to do is run

```
(remprop 'mfactorial 'grind')
```
at the same place we do other initialization, maybe after

```
ecl_eval('(defun principal nil (cond ($noprincipal (diverg)) ((not pcprntd) (merror "Divergent Integral"))))')
```
in sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py, and put a couple doctests in to verify these things work?  Actually, looks like we'd need something in maxima_abstract.py or maxima.py as well to fix the very first example.

I like this, but I still get

sage: sage: maxima(factorial(x) == 0).sage()
x != 0
```
because of course that is not using the library interface, and really both of them need to work, as I say in [comment:9](#comment:9).
> Actually, looks like we'd need something in maxima_abstract.py or maxima.py as well to fix the very first example.

You might as well also add your first example, Eviatar:

```
sage: var('y')
sage: (factorial(x)==y).solve(x)    
[factorial(x) == y]
```
But nice work on the whole just getting this in.

I like this.  Tried a few other things but it seems to work fine.  However, now I get

```
sage -t sage/calculus/calculus.py
**********************************************************************
File "sage/calculus/calculus.py", line 1743, in sage.calculus.calculus.symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string
Failed example:
    sefms("x != 3") == SR(x != 3)
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False

    [375 tests, 1 failure, 6.10 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t sage/calculus/calculus.py  # 1 doctest failed
```
That's because of the change

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string as sefms
sage: sefms("x!=3")
x != 3
```
to

```
sage: sefms("x!=3")
factorial(x) == 3
```
I'm not sure whether we should just remove this doctest or whether there is an appropriate "fix".  I've cc:ed Doug, who worked on #8969 and might have a comment about this (though I guess I was the one who originally proposed this test).

True
```
