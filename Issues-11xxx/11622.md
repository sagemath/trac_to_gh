This perhaps just gets a meta-ticket to collect various additions (or changes), to be discussed and implemented on their own tickets.

There are a few things I would like to have a `make` target for, partially just for convenience (at the moment random choice / incomplete, random order):
* `build-check`, perhaps also `all-check`, as an "alias" for

```sh
env SAGE_CHECK=yes make build
```
* `build-parallel` or something like that to build Sage in parallel with a default number of jobs (preferably the number of cores or hardware threads), or at least (currently just) setting `SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD=yes` and doing the usual thing
* similar things for `doc` and `all`

+* ...
+
+**Please add further suggestions (and the tickets implementing them).**
+
+---
+
+Related:
+
+* As of Sage 4.7.1.rc0, running `./sage -b` before running tests is currently not performed consistently. It's perhaps discussable whether we should do that in *all* test receipts or none of them, or provide *separate* targets which do that (which is a trivial task except for the choice of names).
+
+
+* The current behaviour of `devel/sage/setup.py` w.r.t. to parallel building is IMHO undesirable or sub-optimal:
+  * It uses the number of hardware threads even if `MAKE` isn't set (*of course<sup>TM</sup>* regardless of the system load). (If `MAKE` is set to e.g. `make -j`, which means an "unlimited" number of jobs, it uses twice the number of hardware threads.) 
+
+    One can of course circumvent that by setting `MAKE` to `make -j1`, but that's IMHO kind of odd.
+  * It complains about an *"impossibly large number of threads"* if the number of jobs (`-j...`) found in `$MAKE` exceeds twice the number of hardware threads, where the number of hardware threads is equal to the number of cores on processors without what Intel calls Hyper-Threading (HT), then falling back to (at most) the number of hardware threads.
+
+
+* We should stop unsetting `MAKEFLAGS` and setting `MAKE` to `make` whenever `SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD!=yes` in `spkg/install`, which is simply wrong for a couple of reasons:
+  * It invalidates e.g. `MAKE=gmake`.
+  * It clears all flags passed to `make` on the command line as well as those eventually added in `MAKE` (or to `MAKEFLAGS`), e.g. `-d`, `-k` (`--keep-going`), and even `-n` (`--dry-run`) and `-q`. 
+
+
+ It should instead (if at all) just add `-j1` to `MAKE` if `SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD!=yes`. 
+
+
+ Oh, just noticed this has meanwhile slightly changed (but don't want to rewrite all the above):
+
+```sh
+if [ "$SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD" = "yes" ] && [ -n "$MAKE" ]; then
+    time $MAKE -f standard/deps $1
+else
+    time make -f standard/deps $1
+fi
+```
+ So we do no longer clear `MAKEFLAGS`, but not using `$MAKE` there remains. (And this won't prevent a parallel build invoked through `-j` without a number of jobs.) Note that `MAKE` will always be set at that point, unless some user tries to call `spkg/install` directly (or doesn't use GNU `make`), which is an error condition by itself, to be catched separately. 
+
+
+   **Note:** This is meanwhile also fixed by #11959, i.e. `${MAKE:-make}` is now consistently used.
+
+
+* The sequence top-level Makefile (`make`) -> `spkg/install` (shell script) -> `spkg/standard/deps`, another Makefile run by a *different* `make` instance is IMHO bad and not necessary anyway, since it is possible to set all environment (or `make`) variables in `spkg/standard/deps` (ill name for a Makefile that isn't included by another one) itself. 
+
+  Changing this is of course a bigger task. (We have to keep the two-stage make procedure, i.e. two separate Makefiles, to support upgrading at least, which I think isn't bad since it is more modular.)
+
+---
+
+In case we disagree or have contrary opinions on / suggestions for some changes or in design, we can move the discussion of *individual aspects* to `sage-devel` (or `sage-release` :-) ) threads, but we IMHO shouldn't move the *whole* discussion there. There'll certainly be follow-up or "real" (non-meta) tickets anyway, so it should be possible to not mix up different aspects in a single thread.

+This perhaps just gets a meta-ticket to collect various additions (or changes), to be discussed and implemented on their own tickets.
+
+There are a few things I would like to have a `make` target for, partially just for convenience (at the moment random choice / incomplete, random order):
+* `build-check`, perhaps also `all-check`, as an "alias" for
+
+```sh
+env SAGE_CHECK=yes make build
+```
+* `build-check-ignore` once we support `SAGE_CHECK=ignore` to (build and) run all test suites without treating failed tests as fatal errors (since e.g. the Python test suite fails on many systems)
+* `build-parallel` or something like that to build Sage in parallel with a default number of jobs (preferably the number of cores or hardware threads), or at least (currently just) setting `SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD=yes` and doing the usual thing
+* `build-sequential` in case we one day default to a parallel build 
+
+  **Note:** #11959 now enables parallel spkg building by default, and adds a target `build-serial`.
+* similar things for `doc` (see below) and `all`
+* perhaps `library` as an alias for `./sage -b`
+* ...
+
+I could imagine to also have
+* different targets to build the documentation sequentially or in parallel (cf. #6495),
+* ...
+
+**Please add further suggestions (and the tickets implementing them).**
+
+---
+
+Related:
+
+* As of Sage 4.7.1.rc0, running `./sage -b` before running tests is currently not performed consistently. It's perhaps discussable whether we should do that in *all* test receipts or none of them, or provide *separate* targets which do that (which is a trivial task except for the choice of names).
+
+
+* The current behaviour of `devel/sage/setup.py` w.r.t. to parallel building is IMHO undesirable or sub-optimal:
+  * It uses the number of hardware threads even if `MAKE` isn't set (*of course<sup>TM</sup>* regardless of the system load). (If `MAKE` is set to e.g. `make -j`, which means an "unlimited" number of jobs, it uses twice the number of hardware threads.) 
+
+    One can of course circumvent that by setting `MAKE` to `make -j1`, but that's IMHO kind of odd.
+  * It complains about an *"impossibly large number of threads"* if the number of jobs (`-j...`) found in `$MAKE` exceeds twice the number of hardware threads, where the number of hardware threads is equal to the number of cores on processors without what Intel calls Hyper-Threading (HT), then falling back to (at most) the number of hardware threads.
+
+
+* We should stop unsetting `MAKEFLAGS` and setting `MAKE` to `make` whenever `SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD!=yes` in `spkg/install`, which is simply wrong for a couple of reasons:
+  * It invalidates e.g. `MAKE=gmake`.
+  * It clears all flags passed to `make` on the command line as well as those eventually added in `MAKE` (or to `MAKEFLAGS`), e.g. `-d`, `-k` (`--keep-going`), and even `-n` (`--dry-run`) and `-q`. 
+
+
+ It should instead (if at all) just add `-j1` to `MAKE` if `SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD!=yes`. 
+
+
+ Oh, just noticed this has meanwhile slightly changed (but don't want to rewrite all the above):
+
+```sh
+if [ "$SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD" = "yes" ] && [ -n "$MAKE" ]; then
+    time $MAKE -f standard/deps $1
+else
+    time make -f standard/deps $1
+fi
+```
+ So we do no longer clear `MAKEFLAGS`, but not using `$MAKE` there remains. (And this won't prevent a parallel build invoked through `-j` without a number of jobs.) Note that `MAKE` will always be set at that point, unless some user tries to call `spkg/install` directly (or doesn't use GNU `make`), which is an error condition by itself, to be catched separately. 
+
+
+   **Note:** This is meanwhile also fixed by #11959, i.e. `${MAKE:-make}` is now consistently used.
+
+
+* The sequence top-level Makefile (`make`) -> `spkg/install` (shell script) -> `spkg/standard/deps`, another Makefile run by a *different* `make` instance is IMHO bad and not necessary anyway, since it is possible to set all environment (or `make`) variables in `spkg/standard/deps` (ill name for a Makefile that isn't included by another one) itself.

We don't have `SAGE_CHECK=ignore` yet, so this isn't applicable.

>  * `build-sequential` in case we one day default to a parallel build
 
Well, we don't build in parallel by default.

>  * perhaps `library` as an alias for `./sage -b`
 
Very bad idea. We shouldn't encourage `./sage -b`, just run `make` or `make build` or `make sagelib` if needed.

>    * It complains about an *"impossibly large number of threads"* if the number of jobs (`-j...`) found in `$MAKE` exceeds twice the number of hardware threads, where the number of hardware threads is equal to the number of cores on processors without what Intel calls Hyper-Threading (HT), then falling back to (at most) the number of hardware threads.

Neither of this is still true.

I don't think so (or at least, I don't know how to do it). In any case, I don't see the point of *repeating* all environment variables in `build/make/Makefile`, what's wrong with keeping the use of `sage-env`?
