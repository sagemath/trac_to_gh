Cython's libcpp allows use of C++ container classes (aka STL), but using it from Sage is still challenging. A simple `from libcpp.vector cimport vector` (http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/wrapping_CPlusPlus.html#standard-library) does not work in a Sage extension class because `setup.py` will not find some of the dependencies.

This ticket aims to fix this and add an example to the Sage libary documenting its use.

My most important question about this is: 
what is the purpose of this code?  It looks like it is meant only as an example, since it has basically no features.  I'm not sure whether we want to put code into Sage which is *only* meant as example.  There is supposed to be `examples/` for this, but I realize that this is totally unmaintained (and therefore scheduled for removal).

Then some random thoughts:

1) Why

```
cdef vector[int] *data
```
and not

```
cdef vector[int] data
```

Considering that a `std::vector<int>` is essentially a pointer to an array, there is no need to declare a pointer to a pointer.

2) You should make the copyright statement consistent with the template at [http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files)

3) You should add an example of `__getitem__` failing.

As for why, right now Cython allows us to use stl classes but our `setup.py` is broken. This ticket fixes it and adds a testcase for future reference. I was very surprised that this issue was not reported before. My guess is that nobody figured out how to use it, which is why I want to have an example in the Sage library at least until it STL containers are used more often so that there are examples elsewhere.

1) Thats not allowed by Cython:

```
Error compiling Cython file:

        sage: v = stl_int_vector()

```

2,3) Done

> Did you forget to rebuild the Sage library (sage -b)?

C'mon, I'm not *that* dumb! `X-D` But just to be sure, I tried building & testing again, and I encountered the same errors.

I do think the following output from building is pertinent (slightly edited for readability):

```
setup.py:693: UserWarning: could not find dependency <string> included in
/Applications/sage-4.8.alpha4/local/lib/python/site-packages/Cython/Includes/libcpp/string.pxd.
I will assume it is a system C/C++ header.
  warnings.warn(msg+' I will assume it is a system C/C++ header.')
setup.py:693: UserWarning: could not find dependency <vector> included in

I will assume it is a system C/C++ header.
  warnings.warn(msg+' I will assume it is a system C/C++ header.')
```
The file referenced is definitely there, and includes a declaration of C headers. If I inspect the file, I see a declaration of a `cppclass` from `<string>` that should cover it. Yet, when I run the doctests, I get boatloads of errors of this sort:

```

and more just like it.

I suppose it's possible that this installation of sage is simply pooched, though that would seem very, very weird; other patches go in without a problem. It's a MacBook Pro running 10.6.8. On my Ubuntu box running sage 4.8.rc0, the installation passes.

I will run the full battery of doctests on the Ubuntu box, and also try a fresh install of 4.8.rc0 on the MacBook Pro. If it all works out, I'll give it a positive review.

That's really weird. I am in the correct path, and type

```

../../sage -b

```

So I don't know why it's doing that. I'll look at it later.

All tests passed! While I'm not an expert in Cython, what I see of the code makes sense, too. (& thanks for illustrating the use of !`string`.) I'm giving it a positive review, but there are two points I want to ask about (& which perhaps should prevent positive review, but I'm not sure):

1. You should probably change this in the comments:

```

Compare whith !``other!``.

```

  That should be "with" not "whith". :-)

2. The format opening the file is not quite in conformance with the format Jeroen requested. There is no list of authors, and the copyright notice is not quite the same. It's close enough that I'm okay with it, & I've seen other files that don't follow this pattern. Nevertheless, I should point it out.
