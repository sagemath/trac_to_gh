The version of Twisted currently used in Sage is old and obsolete; moreover it is buggy, as our extensive tests involving running  labs for 120 students show. The crashes of the notebook webapp go away after the upgrade to twisted 11.

The twisted package is now included in the flask sagenb (#11080), so this ticket just removes the twisted spkg.

See http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/98c53d17166da1b9 for the sage-devel vote.

**apply**:

1. [attachment:trac-11874-remove-twisted.patch] to the sage root repository
2. [attachment:sage-spkg-11874.patch] to the Sage library.

And **remove** the twisted spkg from the standard spkgs.

**CC:**  rkirov @kini @ppurka @kcrisman @jasongrout @strogdon

**Keywords:** twisted, notebook

**Reviewer:** Dmitrii Pasechnik, Jason Grout

**Author:** Radoslav Kirov, Jason Grout

**Merged:** sage-5.2.beta0

**Dependencies:** #12329, #11080, #10492

I think my updated patch addresses the dependency issue.

The fact that the Sage library needs Twisted is another argument for keeping the twisted spkg separate and not moving it into sagenb.  Or alternatively, the Sage library should be fixed such that it doesn't depend on Twisted.

Apparently twisted 12 is installed into Python 2.7.2 by default, at the time Python is built. I see

```
'/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.0.beta7/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Twisted-12.0.0-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg'
```
in my Sage's Python path. And

```
$ ./sage -python
Python 2.7.2 (default, Mar 10 2012, 23:33:53) 
[GCC 4.4.5] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import twisted
>>> twisted.version  
Version('twisted', 12, 0, 0)
>>>
```

I guess that during the upgrade to Python 2.7.2 it was overlooked that Twisted 12 is in it (not distributed, but getting pulled
during the installation. In my install.log I see

```
Searching for twisted>=8.2
Reading http://pypi.python.org/simple/twisted/
...

Downloading http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/T/Twisted/Twisted-12.0.0.tar.bz2#md5=cf49a8676c21c50faf1b42b528049471
```
By the way, it also pulls zope and a bunch of other stuff.
I don't know what will happen if the installation was running on a machine not connected to the net.

sage-5.0.beta7 doesn't do this on my machine, so it must be something with your setup.  Are you referring to vanilla sage-5.0.beta7 or did you install any extra packages?

> sage-5.0.beta7 doesn't do this on my machine, so it must be something with your setup.  Are you referring to vanilla sage-5.0.beta7 or did you install any extra packages?


Sorry, I can't reproduce this either, there was a fly in my vanilla, apparently :)

I tried Jason's suggestion to replace the twisted import with importing misc.fpickle, but it doesn't work:

```

```
when building sage spkg. Could it be due to fpickle being Cython? I don't know.

I tried this by doing `./sage -f spgk/standard/sage-5.0....`, but I realized that this doesn't work as expected
with sage-... spkg.
If I instead start from clean install beta8, apply the patch, remove twisted spkg, and in sage-... spkg apply the patch

nope, now I just think that we need misc.fpickle to be moved to an spkg that is built and installed before the Sage spkg.

well, you provided me a link to coding guidelines for Sage **library** code, and this file does not belong there, as it's basically a glorified installation script. Then there are `setup.py` and other files which have even less in the header than this new file, so I do not see why I should be holier than the Pope.

And the horrors of digging up the proper copyright notice for this piece of code are, well, horrors...

This is already [fixed "upstream"](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/commit/a6e1f2103880434b5f48c41d7c157cfdae9cc110). :)

"upstream", please remove twisted 11 from sagenb! Indeed, after all this is installed I see:

```
sage: import twisted
sage: twisted.version
Version('twisted', 12, 0, 0)
```

fair enough, the installation log of sagenb-0.9.0 spkg (see #11080) has the following lines:

```
...
Searching for Flask==0.8
Best match: Flask 0.8
Processing Flask-0.8-py2.7.egg
Flask 0.8 is already the active version in easy-install.pth

Using /usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.0.beta8/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Flask-0.8-py2.7.egg
Searching for Twisted==12.0.0
Best match: Twisted 12.0.0
Processing Twisted-12.0.0-py2.7-macosx-10.6-x86_64.egg
Removing Twisted 11.1.0 from easy-install.pth file
Adding Twisted 12.0.0 to easy-install.pth file
...
```
so Twisted 11.1.0 need not be bundled, and in fact I suspect that many installations of Sage that are thought of running twisted 11 are actually running twisted 12!

Thus, either remove twisted 11 from the sagenb bundle, or keep it (if there areny reasons?) and make sure that it gets used!

I got this two times, on Linux and on OSX. Please see http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/tmp/sagenb090install.log for how it went on my OSX system.

It could have happened that the machine you installed sagenb-0.9.0 was off the net, or easy_install was prevented from getting Twisted 12.0.0 in some other way.

And this is the (spkg) version currently included in Sage, not the system-wide one, since that is 10.0.0:

Oh, I just noticed Sage 5.0.beta8 ships SageNB 0.8.27, so this might be irrelevant anyway.

Doesn't the former suggest that Twisted 12.0.0 was installed prior to the install of sagenb-0.9.0? It would be interesting to know what version of Twisted is reported by an unpatched version of 5.0.beta8 with sagenb-0.8.27.

If you followed the instructions on this ticket then you would not have ANY twisted before installing  sagenb-0.9.0.
At least in theory. I didn't check this. I will, but not right now. It's past 2am here.

The mystery is solved :-) 
As sagenb-0.8.27.spkg was not removed, but twisted spkg was removed, during the installation of sagenb-0.8.27.spkg Twisted-12 was pulled from the net. Sorry for noise.

Thus, this needs to be coordinated with the removal of sagenb from Sage deps. Has this been already done in a patch?

You should download and then apply the patch to the sage-***.spkg,

I followed the installation instructions at #11080, but found that the "remove-twisted" patch from here fails to apply, at least to sage-5.0.prealpha0:

Does that mean "needs work", or are the instructions at #11080 misleading?
