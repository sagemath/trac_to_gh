At least the following image:
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/sage/osx/intel/sage-4.7-OSX-64bit-10.6-i386-Darwin.dmg
is defect. The build contains hardcode *absolute* paths the dynamic libs, e.g. something like `libpng12.dynlib` is looked up at `/Users/buildbot/build...`.

This makes it impossible to install spkgs which depend on libraries delivered by Sage. For instance, the spkg/patch from #11575 builds and installs, but is corrupted afterwards.

An ugly work-around is to create the original build directory (which ordinary users may not be able to), and make it a symbolic link to the new location (`$SAGE_ROOT`).

In principle all shared libraries should have relative `RUNPATH`s. AFAIK currently most just use the library name (i.e., no [absolute] path), but rely on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Darwin) instead.

For ELF on UNIX / Linux etc., there is a tool `chrpath` (*change run path*) to (partially) fix such things in already built libraries and executables; I don't know if there's something similar available on Darwin.

Replying to [@nexttime](#comment%3A4):
> (**Any** definition of `SAGE_ROOT` in `local/lib/pkgconfig/*.pc` can and should be removed.)

I'm meanwhile no longer sure about that, since (to me) it looks as if `pkg-config`'s behaviour has changed.

The following is definitely invalid and should be removed: 

(I've seen this as a result of a build from scratch; reinstalling e.g. `libpng12` cured this.)

```
SAGE_ROOT=${SAGE_ROOT}
```

The following are both ok (at least until the Sage installation moves, which `sage` will notice upon start-up, then correcting / updating the path in the `.pc` files):

```
prefix=/current/path/to/SAGE_ROOT/local
...
```

```
SAGE_ROOT=/current/path/to/SAGE_ROOT
prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}/local
...
```

---

Unfortunately, the correction of the paths in `.pc` files (as performed by `sage-location`) isn't fully reliable at the moment, as the first example above shows.

Furthermore, `sage-env` is broken in that it currently only **sets** (i.e., "overwrites") `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` to `$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/pkgconfig/` *if it is empty* / undefined, instead of also prepending Sage's `pkg-config` directory otherwise. 

This means that `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` should currently be unset (outside of the Sage environment) before installing or rebuilding any package.
