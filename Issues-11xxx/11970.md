I was having a hard time compiling sage on my ARM box : the R spkg, which until then hadn't given any issue, didn't even want to configure.

The reason was that if ncurses is detected, then termcap isn't searched for, and hence detecting rl_callback_read_char fails (missing -ltermacp means missing symbols) ; which means the configuration failed because --with-readline was given on the commandline, and it wasn't correctly detected.

I got around it by uninstalling the libncurses5-dev package from my system.

Looking at the configure.ac, I think the issue isn't ARM-specific ; perhaps that should be pushed upstream.

Fine.  Michael Anselmi also reported on [sage-release](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_thread/thread/0f779465055c9162/d8cb1f55c1cad522#d8cb1f55c1cad522):

```
Good news!  To have sage-4.7.2.rc1 build properly on Ubuntu 11.10, all I
had to do was replace $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/readline-6.1.pkg with
readline-6.2.p2.spkg (the spkg you provided) before running `make'.
```
(Although he did get an apparently unrelated doctest error, related to LaTeX.)

I'll commit the changes, update the spkg (in-place) and update the ticket's description later.

This is a different readline-6.2.p2 than the one leif posted above.  Installing leif's package, I was then able to build R.

I'm bumping the priority of this ticket up to BLOCKER, since we can't release Sage with it not even building on the current version of the most popular Linux distribution.

That's the kind of output you get with the failure from matrix_modn_float if you don't start sage with "-gdb" see my own follow up in that thread. alpha3,4,5 is irrelevant here. And this is not related to R or readline but #4260.

Is this one of the blockers for 4.8 release?  In which case some concerted effort to get it reviewed is surely urgent?

Using readline-6.2.p2.spkg I just helped my colleague Bruce Westbury build Sage on an old laptop on which he had installed ubuntu 11.10 (which is still building) but realised later that he was building 4.7.2 and not any 4.8.alpha.  The only ubuntu 11.10 machine I have is a slow netbook on which I built 4.7.2 before upgrading from ubuntu 11.04.  I can try this patch out on that but it may take a few days.

Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.

Before building Sage (or [re-]installing **Sage's** readline), you need to

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```

(The latter depends on the former, so you actually have to specify only one of them).  You **do not** have to install any *libreadline* package, as Sage builds and uses its own -- the one we're talking about here.



> Bruce also tells me that although he installed all the ubuntu packages listed on the installation web page, he also had to install dpkg-dev before Sage would build.


I'm pretty sure the instructions on the web page are still outdated (and by the way have been wrong anyway), as discussed with Harald on sage-release a while ago.

`dpkg-dev` is needed since Ubuntu 11.04, in order to make Python build (because the locations of some libraries were changed in Debian/Ubuntu).

Can you track this further down?

I tried `tgetent(NULL, NULL)` on `sage.math` (with GCC 4.2.4), which doesn't segfault but properly returns 1.  Could you try setting `TERM` to something else (rather than unsetting it) in `sage-sage`, as suggested at #12263?

<a id='comment:29'></a>Here is a first interesting data point:

Let `tgetent_test.c` be following file:

int main(int argc, char** argv)

Libraries should in general be specified **after** the modules that use (parts of) them.  This is (again) mandatory with newer Linux distros as you will know (cf. the Symmetrica and Singular changes for Ubuntu 11.10).

Some linkers seem to make a difference w.r.t. whether they find a *static* library [only] (or depending on whether `LIBRARY_PATH` is set? -- which `sage-env` does).




> However, the same gcc command with the Sage environment variables gives

{{{
$ ( source local/bin/sage-env; gcc -ltermcap tgetent_test.c -o tgetent_test )
/tmp/ccwDi3Oi.o: In function `main':
tgetent_test.c:(.text+0x27): undefined reference to `tgetent'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
}}}

This problem vanishes if you
* put `-ltermcap` last (as one would expect), or
* `unset LIBRARY_PATH` after sourcing `sage-env` (in which case Sage's `libtermcap.a` of course isn't used), or
* both.

Anyway, I don't think this is related to our problem; Sage's readline *shouldn't*<sup>TM</sup> use *Sage's* termcap library at all; on Ubuntu, libtermcap* is a symlink to libncurses*.

Anything else that might affect this (besides #12263, which was merged into rc0), i.e., does the same happen with 4.8.alpha{5,6} + #12263 (with GCC 4.2.4 on Ubuntu 08.04 / `sage.math`), and does my change (on top of readline-6.2.p1) make the difference?

My current internet connection is quite poor, so I don't know if I can fully build Sage and experiment on `sage.math` myself.

Otherwise you could try unsetting `LIBRARY_PATH` in readline's `spkg-install` (with the same configuration as above that segfaulted) and see whether that makes any difference.  I didn't know that `sage-env` sets `LIBRARY_PATH`, so didn't expect that *Sage's* libtermcap might get picked up despite us intentionally *not* using `-I$SAGE_LOCAL/include` nor `-L$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` in readline's `spkg-install`.

<a id='comment:40'></a>I think I got to the bottom of the `tgetent()` segmentation fault: it is a bug in the termcap library.  Under normal circumstances, `strcmp()` can be called with a NULL pointer argument.

You just have to:
1. `sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev` as mentioned above
2. (Re)install the readline spkg: 

   `./sage -f /path/to/readline-6.2.p{2,3,4}`
3. **Reinstall the Python spkg:** 

   `./sage -f spkg/standard/python-*` (or `./sage -f python-2.6.4.p13`)

Which spkg got the positive review?

I'd prefer also unsetting `LIBRARY_PATH` in readline's `spkg-install` (which the p4 does), since in any case we don't want to use Sage's static libtermcap there.

The p3 version (the spkg mentioned in the ticket description).

Why not?  The **fixed** one from #12282 should be fine.
