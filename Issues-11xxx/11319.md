Consider K = QQ(sqrt(337)).  The prime 5 is inert in K and the prime 13 splits.  We'll start with 13 to see what goes wrong:

```
sage: K.<w> = QuadraticField(337)
sage: pp = K.ideal(13).factor()[0][0]
sage: RF13 = K.residue_field(pp)
sage: RF13.gens()
(1,)
sage: RF13.hom([GF(13)(1)])
...
TypeError: images do not define a valid homomorphism
```
However, for residue fields that aren't prime fields it does work:

```
sage: RF5 = K.residue_field(5)
sage: F25 = GF(25, names='a', modulus=RF5.polynomial())
sage: RF5.hom([F25.0])
Ring morphism:
  From: Residue field in wbar of Fractional ideal (5)
  To:   Finite Field in a of size 5^2
  Defn: wbar |--> a
```
Btw, this is in sage 4.6.2. on Mac OS 10.6.7.

I was trying out the patch, and the following example didn't work out like I expected:

```
sage: K
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 - 2
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3-2)
sage: P = K.ideal(7)
sage: P.factor()
Fractional ideal (7)
sage: k = P.residue_field()
sage: k.order()
343
sage: F.<b> = GF(343)
sage: F.order()
343
sage: k
Residue field in abar of Fractional ideal (7)
sage: F
Finite Field in b of size 7^3
sage: k.hom([F(1)])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

     53     def _coerce_impl(self, x):

```

Should this patch fix this as well?
