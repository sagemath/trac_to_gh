Ok, now I get (with #11130 and 11836.patch):

Ok, so here's something that really puzzles me:

```
sage: P

Fractional ideal (49582667258207098257547477827105364096774*a + 402403512193607551973543413116828658131543)

```
I get the warning twice, indicating that something isn't cached!

In fact, if I do

```
sage: trace('P.is_principal()')
```
twice, then I get the following each time:

```
-> 1068             self.__ideal_class_log = list(v[0])
```
So you're setting `self.__ideal_class_log`, but the next time, `if not hasattr(self, "__ideal_class_log")` is False again!

What `bnfisprincipal()` tries to do is to write an ideal as C_1 <sup>e_1</sup> * ... * C_n <sup>e_n</sup> * (a), where (a) is a principal ideal and C_1, ..., C_n are fixed generators of the class group (these are determined by `bnfinit()` or `pari_bnf()` in Sage).

The warning is never about potentially incorrect results, it essentially means "we could not easily compute (a), so we didn't bother".  `__ideal_class_log` should always be correct, regardless of the flag.

My code uses `flag=1` first because sometimes we might not care about (a).  For example, if the ideal is non-principal or the user wants to know `I.is_principal()` without actually needing the generator.

One thing could be improved: if we know that the class group is trivial, some shortcuts can be made.

Hi Jeroen,

Thanks for the explanation. I understood all of that, except for `__ideal_class_log` always being output and always being correct. If it is, then what is the difference between flag=0 and flag=2? Are you saying that there is no difference? The documentation of bnfisprincipal from pari 2.5.0 seems to confirm what you are saying. I just realised that I was reading the documentation from 2.3.5, which suggested otherwise.

I guess that leaves only my other reason for removing flag=1:

The warning disappears if you replace flag=1 by 0, 2 or 3. This is because you only get the warning when you ask for a generator, but don't get it and don't demand it (i.e., if you choose flag=1 and the ideal is too big). The warning is confusing and worried me as a user. So I would like to either have it extensively documented in this patch, or removed. And it can be removed simply by never using flag=1, but always 0, 2, or 3.

If you simply replace flag=1 by 0, 2 or 3, then that slows your patch down in some cases. However, you could do flag=3 if gens_needed=True, and flag=0 otherwise. In other words, call bnfisprincipal only 1 time during `__cache_...` with the flag directly depending on gens_needed. That would not slow things down. In fact, it would speed things up in case of gens_needed=True and a big ideal.

I'm afraid I don't have a copy of the old patch.

The only parts which changed w.r.t. the old patch are:
1. removing some underscores.
2. the implementation of the `_cache_bnfisprincipal()` function, lines 1060--1076.
3. added doctests for `ideal_class_log()`, lines 1123--1148.
