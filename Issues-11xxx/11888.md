Maxima returns solutions to some exponential equations in terms of the `lambert_w` function. Sage is missing a conversion for this function:

```

sage: solve(e^(5*x)+x==0, x, to_poly_solve=True)
[x == -1/5*lambert_w(5)]
sage: S = solve(e^(5*x)+x==0, x, to_poly_solve=True)
sage: z = S[0].rhs()
sage: z
-1/5*lambert_w(5)
sage: N(z)

`mpmath` can evaluate the `lambert_w` function, so it should be easy to add a new symbolic function to Sage that will fix this issue.

I don't see any obvious problems, but the random expression usually doesn't change much with these new functions and this one is *really* different.

I spread it across lines because 1) I was trying to keep within the recommended PEP 8 guidelines for line length, and 2) because of this

```

stuff started happening to vim
[2012-01-10 22:55:02] <kini> I thought my terminal had frozen or something
[2012-01-10 22:56:02] <kini> but it turns out that apparently opening a new line
after a line with a 1800-character-long Sage symbolic expression on it causes
vim to take a full 12 seconds to compute the correct indentation level for the
next line
[2012-01-10 22:56:20] <benjaminfjones> ha!

[2012-01-10 22:56:39] <benjaminfjones> wow
```

What is inappropriate about adding line breaks?

As for the length of the expression, it seems to be a fluke. With the patches applied, starting with random seeds other than `2` gives expressions of a more "normal" length.

Ping.  I'd love to review this but sounds like Fredrik's point is good and if it's pretty easy for you to add that, we might as well.

Yes, it should be easy; just add an optional branch parameter, lambertw(z, branch=0).

Another suggestion is to use scipy.special.lambertw for evaluation over RDF and CDF. The SciPy implementation is a Cython translation of the double precision version in mpmath; it supports all branches and has excellent numerical stability, and runs quite a bit faster.

```
import scipy.special
import mpmath
timeit("mpmath.lambertw(-35.0r+4.6jr,2r)")
timeit("mpmath.fp.lambertw(-35.0r+4.6jr,2r)")
timeit("scipy.special.lambertw(-35.0r+4.6jr,2r)")
print repr(complex(mpmath.lambertw(-35.0r+4.6jr,2r)))
print repr(mpmath.fp.lambertw(-35.0r+4.6jr,2r))
print repr(scipy.special.lambertw(-35.0r+4.6jr,2r))

After looking at this a bit more, it may be more involved than I initially envisioned to implement arbitrary branches of the lambert_w function in one symbolic function. Right now, the patch from SD 35.5 implements a subclass of !`BuiltinFunction`. The underlying assumptions about subclasses of BuiltinFunction include: (from sage/symbolic/function.pyx)

```
We assume that each subclass of this class will define one symbolic function.
```

One issue is that there isn't a way (as far as I can see) to pass a branch parameter to !`BuiltinFunction`'s `_call_` method. (Perhaps burcin or other authority on Sage symbolics can comment on this.)

Changing the evaluation numerical eval to use SciPy would be an easy change, that's for sure. I can do that quickly and upload a patch that implements the principle branch only. 

Another idea I just had was to do something like what we have for the Bessel functions, in particular the !`Bessel` class in sage/functions/special.py which is just a basic python class returning one of the Bessel (I,J,Y) functions of a given order.

Ok, that makes sense.   I feel like there should be a way to do that nonetheless - see `incomplete_gamma`, with

```
        BuiltinFunction.__init__(self, "gamma", nargs=2, latex_name=r"\Gamma",
                conversions={'maxima':'gamma_incomplete', 'mathematica':'Gamma',
                    'maple':'GAMMA'})
```
and then use `_eval_` and `_evalf_`, but I don't have time to try looking into whether that would work here now.

Based on Fredrik's comment, make sure to only use SciPy for RDF/CDF - hopefully there is a good model elsewhere to use for that.

Do we really want to call this function `lambert_w_branch()`? Can we name it `lambert_w()`? I would even suggest to add custom printing methods (`_print_()` and `_print_latex_()`) to avoid printing the branch argument if it is 0.

If the function is named lambert_w, you can remove the wrapper function `lambert_w()` and the manual manipulation of the symbol table. In this case, a custom `__call__()` method would take the place of the wrapper method.

BTW, we should either open a new ticket to add known exact evaluations to `_eval_()` or do this here:
- 0 -> 0
- e -> 1
- -1/e -> -1

I've written a new patch that includes significant changes compared to the last one. I think I've included all of burcin's suggestions and I think it's much improved now. All tests pass with the patch applied on 5.0.beta4 + #12507.

One thing I haven't managed to figure out is how to get integration to work, e.g.

```
sage: integrate(lambert_w(x), x)
...
RuntimeError: ECL says: Error executing code in Maxima: lambert_w: wrong number of arguments.
```

I guess that's because there isn't a two-argument version of lambert_w defined in maxima. The conversion maxima -> Sage works (as shown in one of the doctests) but it looks like the other way doesn't. Another example:

```
sage: maxima(lambert_w(5))
Maxima ERROR:
	
lambert_w: wrong number of arguments.
 -- an error. To debug this try: debugmode(true);
```

Q: How do I get around this?

Numerical integration also fails unless I pass a lambda function:

```
sage: numerical_integral(lambert_w(x), 0, 1)
Exception TypeError: "function not supported for these types, and can't coerce safely to supported types" in 'sage.gsl.integration.c_ff' ignored
...
(0.0, 0.0)
```

but ....

```
sage: numerical_integral(lambda x: lambert_w(x), 0, 1)
(0.33036612476168054, 3.667800782666048e-15)
```

Q: How do I fix this?

You need to define `_maxima_init_evaled_()`. See line 895 of `sage/fuctions/other.py`:

It seems that adding `_maxima_init_evaled_()` solves one issue, converting to Maxima with `_maxima_()`,

```
sage: lambert_w(x)._maxima_()
lambert_w(x)
sage: lambert_w(1,x)._maxima_()
...
NotImplementedError: Non-principal branch lambert_w[1](x) is not implemented in Maxima
```

but integration still doesn't work (same error is raised as before). Looking closer it seems that the issue is here:

```
sage: z = lambert_w(x)
sage: z.operands()
[0, x]
sage: z.operator()
lambert_w
```

because when `sr_to_max` is called in the integration code, I get:

```
sage: from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import sr_to_max
sage: sr_to_max(lambert_w(x))
<ECL: ((%LAMBERT_W) 0 $X)>
sage: sr_to_max(lambert_w(1, x))
<ECL: ((%LAMBERT_W) 1 $X)>
```

and Maxima barfs because it doesn't know what to do with `((%LAMBERT_W) 0 $X)`.

I've posted my latest patch in case anyone wants to play around with getting integration of `lambert_w` to work. 

This issue could be a new ticket. One solution I can see is to add `lambert_w` to the `special_sage_to_max` dictionary in `sage/intefaces/maxima_lib.py`. There are a few other special functions listed there (like `Ei` and `polylog`) that need special conversions to maxima.

So, I propose that we either:
a. Review patch [attachment:trac_11888_v6.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11888/trac_11888_v6.patch) and open a new ticket for the integration issue
b. Agree on a simple workaround like adding `lambert_w` to `special_sage_to_max` and I'll add it to the patch.

Success! 

Symbolic and numerical integration now work as expected for the principle branch. I added doctests to indicate what is and is not implemented. 

---

One other comment, to indicate what causes errors, I want to add doctests to `lambert_w` such as: 

```
sage: integral(lambert_w(1,x), x)                                                                   
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input                                          
...                                                                                                 
RuntimeError: ECL says: Error executing code in Maxima: lambert_w: expected exactly 1 arguments.   
```

and 

```
sage: numerical_integral(lambert_w(x), 0, 1)                                                        
Exception TypeError: "function not supported for these types, and can't coerce safely to supported types" in 'sage.gsl.integration.c_ff' ignored                                                    
...                                                                                                 
(0.0, 0.0)
```

but the doctest framework doesn't recognize the `Exception TypeError` and it seems to automatically fail if a `RuntimeError` is raised. If I put the latter 4 lines in the docstring for `lambert_w`, it fails doctesting, the framework only sees the `(0.0, 0.0)` part at the end. Is there a way around either of these issues?

No problem, OK by me.

Is it more convenient to simplify W_0(z) instead of W(z) ? If not, then
it seems reasonable to just go ahead and simplify it.

If you decide against automatically simplifying W_0(z) to W(z), I guess
I hope you don't make it controlled by a flag; flags cause trouble,
because one can't guess by looking at some code how it's going to turn
out. How about a function to carry out the simplification.

After some real-world discussions, I'd prefer to avoid falling into Python ints for (some of) the special values:

```
sage: parent(lambert_w(0))
Integer Ring
sage: parent(lambert_w(e))
<type 'int'>
sage: parent(lambert_w(-1/e))
<type 'int'>
sage: parent(lambert_w(SR(-1/e)))
<type 'int'>
sage: parent(lambert_w(SR(0)))
Integer Ring
```

Mysteriously enough, instrumenting it reveals that `_eval_` is actually returning SR(1) which then in some part of the code I don't understand becomes int(1) before we get it back.  If we explicitly return Integer(1) then it seems to stay as Integer(1).  This isn't the biggest deal in the world but there have been several bug reports caused by something falling out of Sagespace into Pythonspace.

New changes look good; good catch about the derivative w.r.t. branch. All relavent tests pass for me on sage-5.0. I would say this is ready to go in! Thanks for the very thorough review, Doug.

This patch is awesome!  It's also a great example of how to make a well-documented new symbolic function that illustrates many issues. Here are a few trivial nitpicks:

* What is "simplication"?

```
When automatic simplication occurs, the parent of the output value should be 
```

* This docstring should start with r" since it contains a backslash:

```
        646	        """ 
 	647	        The derivative of `W_n(x)` is `W_n(x)/(x \cdot W_n(x) + x)`. 
```
(check for similar instances throughout).

* Don't use periods at the end of exceptions (also don't capitalize).  Many instances of this being wrong, e.g., 

```
 	679	            raise ValueError("Derivative not defined with respect to the branch number.") 
```
Here's a good example of what an exception string should look like (built into python):

```
>>> 1/0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
```
