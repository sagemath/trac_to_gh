A doc string from an extension module typically starts with embedding information, such as here:

```
sage: cython("""
....: def testfunc(x):
....:     'some doc string'
....:     return x
....: """)
sage: print testfunc.__doc__
File: _mnt_local_king__sage_temp_mpc622_13356_tmp_0_spyx_0.pyx (starting at line 7)
some doc string
```

There are two functions in `sage.misc.sageinspect` that retrieve doc strings: `sage_getdoc` and `_sage_getdoc_unformatted`. The latter returns the doc string as it is, the former is supposed to remove the embedding information.

However, before doing so, sage_getdoc runs `sage.misc.sagedoc.format` on the output of `_sage_getdoc_unformatted`. That is a problem, because the formatting may insert line breaks, thereby destroying the embedding information, so that it can now not be correctly stripped from the doc string.

I suggest to modify `sage.misc.sagedoc.format`, such that the first line is preserved, if it contains embedding information. In that case, directives are searched in the second line of the doc string, not in the first line (currently the only recognized directive is `nodetex`).

Example, without the patch:

```
sage: from sage.misc.sagedoc import format
sage: r = 'File: _local_user_with_a_very_long_name_that_would_normally_be_wrapped_sage_temp_machine_name_1234_tmp_1_spyx_0.pyx (starting at line 6)\nnodetex\nsome doc for a cython method\n`x \\geq y`'
sage: print format(r)
File: _local_user_with_a_very_long_name_that_would_normally_be_wrapped
_sage_temp_machine_name_1234_tmp_1_spyx_0.pyx (starting at line 6)
nodetex some doc for a cython method x >= y
```

The same example with the patch (it is a new doc test):

```
sage: r = 'File: _local_user_with_a_very_long_name_that_would_normally_be_wrapped_sage_temp_machine_name_1234_tmp_1_spyx_0.pyx (starting at line 6)\nnodetex\nsome doc for a cython method\n`x \\geq y`'
sage: print format(r)
File: _local_user_with_a_very_long_name_that_would_normally_be_wrapped_sage_temp_machine_name_1234_tmp_1_spyx_0.pyx (starting at line 6)
<BLANKLINE>
some doc for a cython method
`x \geq y`
```

The good new is that now the patchbot manages to apply the patch.


The bad new is that the patchbot states:

```
The following tests failed:

	sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage-11815/doc/fr/tutorial/programming.rst
```

The good news is that the patchbot is actually not showing any error in the log. So, why does it state that it fails?

```
sage: cython("""

sage: print testfunc.__doc__

    nodetex
    This is a doc string with raw latex

    `x \geq y`
    
```
Hence, one should strip empty lines at the beginning of a string resp. after the embedding information.

I updated the patch, and there is now a new doc test:

```
sage: cython_code = ["def testfunc(x):",
... "    '''",
... "    nodetex",
... "    This is a doc string with raw latex",
... "",
... "    `x \\geq y`",
... "    '''",
... "    return -x"]
sage: cython('\n'.join(cython_code))
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getdoc
sage: print sage_getdoc(testfunc)
<BLANKLINE>
    This is a doc string with raw latex
<BLANKLINE>
    `x \geq y`
<BLANKLINE>
```

The trick is to strip leading empty lines (after the embedding information), and also to strip blank space around the directives.
