This patch solves it !

Patch also applies clean to Sage 4.7.2.alpha4.

IMHO all patches should in general be based on the latest *devel* release (or at least still apply to it); an attachment comment stating on which version a patch is based is of course not bad, especially as time goes by.

I really don't understand why the patchbot still uses 4.7.1; as such, it is almost useless.  Worse, it reports failures for patches that apply (and work) well.  (And often hangs such that the HTTP connections for trac pages are kept open...)

Passes all (long) tests in `sage/numerical/`, and Peter Mueller's example (at first glance) doesn't eat up memory as it did before.

Haven't looked at the code though.

The patch installed fine in sage-4.7.2alpha, and passed all the tests in sage/numerical/

I ran my original program again which goes through thousands of different small ilp problems. The memory usage was basically constant, so the memory leak apparently is fixed.

As this patch just fixed a bug and didn't add new features, I guess it is save to close the ticket.
