I can't believe we haven't done this before, nor that someone hasn't requested it.  See [this ask.sagemath post](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/503/can-sage-find-the-poles-of-a-complex-function-and).

```
sage: f(x)=1/x
sage: f.maxima_methods().residue(x,0)
1
f(x)=1/(x^2+1)
f.maxima_methods().residue(x,i)
-1/2*I
```
This should be a little easier to do than that.

Also, when we do this, we should probably point out the bug that [apparently is in Maxima](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3541292&group_id=4933&atid=104933) there.  I don't see a point in making a ticket for that until we actually wrap it, though.
