Do people have some lower level scenario in mind where it's sufficient for the students to play around with a crypto "black box"?

I don't mind if it gets included for a good reason, but if the code here isn't going to be used properly and frequently in teaching I'd rather not have it in there, because it will take away from the excitement that students get from implementing their own RSA if there's already such an implementation available in sage.

Nils' argument presumably applies to nearly all the stuff in the `crypto` folder, though, doesn't it?  Certainly the only current public-key one.

I guess it depends on whether you are going to ask students to *code* things like DH or RSA, or only to "do" them.

<a id='comment:23'></a>`@`vdelecroix, thanks for bringing the `__init__` and `__eq__` methods to my attention. I copied the implementations from ajeeshr, who had copied them from `BlumGoldwasser`, the other `PublicKeyCryptosystem`. The reason `BlumGoldwasser` implements them is to override the `PublicKeyCryptosystem` implementations, which is necessary because `BlumGoldwasser` doesn't initialize its superclass properly (it may be helpful to read the code for the Cryptosystem class's `__init__` and `__eq__`, which can be found on lines 104-212 in cryptosystem.py). 

I modified `__eq__` to fix the issue you identified. Now, the method just compares the class of the two objects being compared. This is a change that should also be made to `BlumGoldwasser`. 

However,  `__init__` will be trickier to fix properly. According to the `Cryptosystem` class, which `RSACryptosystem` inherits through `PublicKeyCryptosystem`, I should be passing the following arguments to my superclass's `__init__` method: `plaintext_space, ciphertext_space, key_space, block_length=1, period=None`. Without fixing this, inherited methods like the following will fail: 

```
  sage: rc = RSACryptosystem()
  sage: rc.key_space()
  AttributeError: 'RSACryptosystem' object has no attribute '_key_space'
```
The following values seem to make the most sense to me, but I'm not certain: 
* plaintext_space = group of all integers
* ciphertext_space = group of all integers
* key_space: I have no idea how to specify this one as a group. 

Ideally, I would give plaintext_space and ciphertext_space as integers mod n, instead of the group of all integers. However, this would require giving the RSACryptosystem class state, recording public and private keys internally. This would have the effect of making it more opaque, since users wouldn't need to explicitly pass keys to encrypt and decrypt. Thus, I think it makes sense to keep plaintext_space and ciphertext_space as the groups of all integers. Comments on this would be appreciated. 

Side note: `__init__` will also need to be fixed in `BlumGoldwasser`:

```
  sage: from sage.crypto.public_key.blum_goldwasser import BlumGoldwasser
  sage: bs = BlumGoldwasser()
  sage: bs.key_space()
  AttributeError: 'BlumGoldwasser' object has no attribute '_key_space'
```

Also, as suggested by kcrisman, I corrected several formatting issues with the documentation. Thanks to vdelecroix, I removed unnecessary redeclarations of variables in my tests, except where redeclaring improved readability.
