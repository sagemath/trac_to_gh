Just a few quick observations:

- What is the intended use of the code one included in Sage? If it's for teaching you would probably want to expose more of the details. In fact, for educational purposes it's probably better to do the whole construction "in the open" instead of wrapping it in a class, unless the educational part is wrapping things in classes. For actual cryptographic use, one would probably prefer a whole protocol library. The algorithm is a very small part of deploying cryptography in a secure manner.

- In your code you call `euler_phi(n)` to compute the private key d from e. Since the public key is (n,e), anyone could do that same calculation. That means that if it is doable for you to compute the private part of the key, then it is also doable for anyone. You don't have an advantage. (HINT: the key is that euler_phi computes the factorisation of n. If you would make sure that 2**p-1 and 2**q-1 are actually prime, you would know the factorization of n and hence euler_phi(n). But you should not call euler_phi(n), because that throws away your advantage).

In the associated branch, I've added RSACryptosystem to the global namespace. Is there any reason why this is a bad idea? 

BlumGoldwasser, the public key system already included with Sage, has a very similar API to RSACryptosystem. There are a few differences: 

* In RSACryptosystem, I combined the `public_key` and `private_key` methods into a single `calculate_keys` method. This is because the exponent `e` would have had to be calculated independently (and identically) in the two methods. In BlumGoldwasser, the keys can more naturally be calculated independently. 
* I am missing a `random_key` method. This would be an easy addition, but I'm not sure how valuable it is; for RSACryptosystem it would only need to find two primes, and plug them into `calculate_keys`.

1. If `__init__` is empty, you can just **avoid** it.

2. What is the point of having the comparison implemented?! Moreover, the way you did is completely wrong

  ```

   ```
   The following will return `True`

  ```
  sage: rc1 = RSACryptosystem()

  sage: rc1 == a
   ```

3. In the function `encrypt` in the section `TESTS` you repeat many times the definition of `rc` as well as the computation of the keys. Just remove all these duplication.

Before people spend too much time on the code here: Is there a reasonable scenario that justifies having this in the library? We're not going to use it for industrial encryption applications, so I think people think it's for teaching. However, when I teach RSA, the students have to *see* the exponentiation and the construction of the moduli. At that point, the fact that you can do square-and-multiply to do the exponentiation efficiently is already a worthwhile revelation for them.

So having that all wrapped up in library routines is no help at all. They're going to have these things in front of them on a worksheet.

Do people have some lower level scenario in mind where it's sufficient for the students to play around with a crypto "black box"?

I don't mind if it gets included for a good reason, but if the code here isn't going to be used properly and frequently in teaching I'd rather not have it in there, because it will take away from the excitement that students get from implementing their own RSA if there's already such an implementation available in sage.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:23'></a>\n@videlec, thanks for bringing the `__init__` and `__eq__` methods to my attention. I copied the implementations from ajeeshr, who had copied them from `BlumGoldwasser`, the other `PublicKeyCryptosystem`. The reason `BlumGoldwasser` implements them is to override the `PublicKeyCryptosystem` implementations, which is necessary because `BlumGoldwasser` doesn't initialize its superclass properly (it may be helpful to read the code for the Cryptosystem class's `__init__` and `__eq__`, which can be found on lines 104-212 in cryptosystem.py). \n\nI modified `__eq__` to fix the issue you identified. Now, the method just compares the class of the two objects being compared. This is a change that should also be made to `BlumGoldwasser`. \n\nHowever,  `__init__` will be trickier to fix properly. According to the `Cryptosystem` class, which `RSACryptosystem` inherits through `PublicKeyCryptosystem`, I should be passing the following arguments to my superclass's `__init__` method: `plaintext_space, ciphertext_space, key_space, block_length=1, period=None`. Without fixing this, inherited methods like the following will fail: \n\n```\n  sage: rc = RSACryptosystem()\n  sage: rc.key_space()\n  AttributeError: 'RSACryptosystem' object has no attribute '_key_space'\n```\nThe following values seem to make the most sense to me, but I'm not certain: \n* plaintext_space = group of all integers\n* ciphertext_space = group of all integers\n* key_space: I have no idea how to specify this one as a group. \n\nIdeally, I would give plaintext_space and ciphertext_space as integers mod n, instead of the group of all integers. However, this would require giving the RSACryptosystem class state, recording public and private keys internally. This would have the effect of making it more opaque, since users wouldn't need to explicitly pass keys to encrypt and decrypt. Thus, I think it makes sense to keep plaintext_space and ciphertext_space as the groups of all integers. Comments on this would be appreciated. \n\nSide note: `__init__` will also need to be fixed in `BlumGoldwasser`:\n\n```\n  sage: from sage.crypto.public_key.blum_goldwasser import BlumGoldwasser\n  sage: bs = BlumGoldwasser()\n  sage: bs.key_space()\n  AttributeError: 'BlumGoldwasser' object has no attribute '_key_space'\n```\n\nAlso, as suggested by kcrisman, I corrected several formatting issues with the documentation. Thanks to vdelecroix, I removed unnecessary redeclarations of variables in my tests, except where redeclaring improved readability.",

The reason `BlumGoldwasser` implements them is to override the `PublicKeyCryptosystem` implementations, which is necessary because `BlumGoldwasser` doesn't initialize its superclass properly (it may be helpful to read the code for the Cryptosystem class's `__init__` and `__eq__`, which can be found on lines 104-212 in cryptosystem.py). 

I modified `__eq__` to fix the issue you identified. Now, the method just compares the class of the two objects being compared. This is a change that should also be made to `BlumGoldwasser`. 

However,  `__init__` will be trickier to fix properly. According to the `Cryptosystem` class, which `RSACryptosystem` inherits through `PublicKeyCryptosystem`, I should be passing the following arguments to my superclass's `__init__` method: `plaintext_space, ciphertext_space, key_space, block_length=1, period=None`. Without fixing this, inherited methods like the following will fail: 

```
  sage: rc = RSACryptosystem()
  sage: rc.key_space()
  AttributeError: 'RSACryptosystem' object has no attribute '_key_space'
```
The following values seem to make the most sense to me, but I'm not certain: 
* plaintext_space = group of all integers
* ciphertext_space = group of all integers
* key_space: I have no idea how to specify this one as a group. 

Ideally, I would give plaintext_space and ciphertext_space as integers mod n, instead of the group of all integers. However, this would require giving the RSACryptosystem class state, recording public and private keys internally. This would have the effect of making it more opaque, since users wouldn't need to explicitly pass keys to encrypt and decrypt. Thus, I think it makes sense to keep plaintext_space and ciphertext_space as the groups of all integers. Comments on this would be appreciated. 

Side note: `__init__` will also need to be fixed in `BlumGoldwasser`:

```
  sage: from sage.crypto.public_key.blum_goldwasser import BlumGoldwasser
  sage: bs = BlumGoldwasser()
  sage: bs.key_space()
  AttributeError: 'BlumGoldwasser' object has no attribute '_key_space'
```

Also, as suggested by kcrisman, I corrected several formatting issues with the documentation. Thanks to vdelecroix, I removed unnecessary redeclarations of variables in my tests, except where redeclaring improved readability.

A few comments on this:
* You can open a separate ticket for the `BlumGoldwasser` stuff, no need to fix it here.
* You should use the `TestSuite` functionality, I guess, to ensure that all such possible errors are caught.
* One possible option would be to make those spaces be `NotImplementedError` or something, and then document it as such.  
* Another one is that, considering

```
class PublicKeyCryptosystem(Cryptosystem):
    r"""
    The base class for asymmetric or public-key cryptosystems.
    """
```
  is the entirety of the constructor for `PublicKeyCryptosystem`, and that several of the systems in the `crypto/` folder don't even inherit from `Cryptosystem`, one could just ignore this altogether and not inherit from it if there seems to be no reason to.
* Or you could use integers. 
* Or you could build it in but then `RSACryptosystem(n)` would be needed. That's sort of like how the other ciphers require you to put in the alphabet, so it isn't totally farfetched.
