Posted to sage-support by Robin Hankin,

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/1209ff5cb106d99c


Actual result:

```
sage: f = (x^2)*exp(x) / (1+exp(x))^2
sage: integrate(f, (x, -infinity, infinity))
0
```

Expected result:

```
sage: from mpmath import *
sage: mp.pretty=True
sage: quad(lambda x:(x^2)*exp(x)/(1+exp(x))^2,[-inf,+inf])
3.28986813369645
```


Depends on #12094

The original bug is fixed in maxima-5.24, but the stack overflow that William reported is not. I've opened #12377 separately to deal with that.

This patch applies on top of #11483, not because we need abs_integrate, but because they both add doctests in the same spot.
