From time to time people state that a good introduction to the category framework and Sage's coercion system is missing (at [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/bbcb3574c5317cfa), for example).

I suggest to include a thematic tutorial.

Note that it may relate with #8821, which is about adding a section on coercion (but not categories) in the guided tour.

Depends on #14084

I suggest to base a thematic tutorial on [this worksheet](http://flask.sagenb.org/home/pub/82/). 

It covers base classes for parents and elements, category framework for parents and elements, uniqueness of parents, coercion maps, construction functors, and test suites.

The didactical approach is to explain the theory and illustrate each theoretical bit by showing how it can be implemented. Step by step, one obtains an alternative implementation of fraction fields.

There are also several texts in the combinat branch, and I suggest to add these as well. The style of these texts is very different from the style of my worksheet, and I hope that the user will benefit from diversity.

A thematic tutorial in the documentation is a rst file.  See $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/ for examples.  A worksheet is probably pretty straightforward to convert to a rst file.

So I would think the patch would be an rst file in that directory and a one-line addition to the index.rst file in that directory.

Using #10637 and some manual work, I have translated the worksheet into a thematic tutorial in .rst format.

One of the example needs #14084 to work, hence, this is a dependency.

The tutorial links to the reference manual, which is only possible with #6495; however, I don't think this should be considered a dependency, because in the worst case the links are not available.

Needs review! After applying the patch, do `sage --docbuild thematic_tutorials html`.

Apply trac11490-coercion_tutorial.patch

Hello,

I was wondering for such a patch to come! I read it because I am interested but by far not an expert. Here are some comments for trac11490-coercion_tutorial.patch, line numbers refer to the patch.

* you may write "and" or "respectively" instead of "resp." (line 34)
* at lines 195-198 there is a kind of magic to test the pickling. You shoud add few words to explain what's happening.

OK.

> * at lines 195-198 there is a kind of magic to test the pickling. You shoud add few words to explain what's happening.

Well, in the lines in front of it, I write

```
    However, for
    making the example work in the Sage's doctesting framework, we need to
    declare our class as an attribute of the ``__main__`` module.
```
I thought this is an explanation? Technically, the doctest framework finds that the classes are defined in the module `__main__`, but apparently (for a reason that is not clear to me) it can not find it in `__main__`---although this perfectly works in an interactive session.

Similar case is around line 1433 and 1572.

> * I do not like the `class MyFrac(MyFrac)` at lines 462, 812, 882 (but do not have better option)

The didactic idea is that it is more easy to understand what is happening, when only small changes are made. Hence, I certainly would not like to repeatedly give a full definition of `MyFrac`, each time changing or adding a small detail, because the reader would then be more likely to lose track.

> * I would like to know why test at line 494 fails while I was able to add some elements at line 294

At this point, we *can* add elements (visible in line 294), but `P.zero_element()` does not work yet, because this tries to return `P(0)`, but conversion is not available at this point.

Shall I add the explanation at line 494, or better at line 539, when I made the summation work?

> * line 678: write "P1 == P2" instead of "P1==P2" (ie add whitespaces on both sides of "==")

OK.

> * I do not like your example at line 687 because of

There is a coercion from P2 to P1, but not from P1 to P2 (note the different base rings).

> I expected that are natural coercions in both directions then the parent of elements `a+b` is determined by the parent of `a`.

That's correct, but there is no bi-directional coercion here.

OK, I'll post an update a bit later.

<div id="comment:11" align="right">comment:11</div>

I also have the following comments:

- There's a typo on line 100: `This base class provides a lot mor methods than a general parent::` (mor -> more).

- On line 133: `Declaring the base or base is easy` -- should that be "the base of base ring"?

- On block starting at line 141, I would set the `_repr_` and like functions in code formatting (double back ticks)

- In the `__cmp__` block, it might be worth noting that if `__cmp__` is not implemented, bad things can happen when calling `cmp` (ex. #14065)

- The double colon on line 312, I believe it will not show up in the documentation since I believe the newline will be treated as a whitespace.

- The block starting at line 319, the last sentence is `It not even gives a wrong answer, but results in an error::`. I believe there should be a "does".

- The `but they are *required* or *optional* methods` sentence on lines 435-436 sounds strange to me. I would recommend "so they are either *optional* or *required* methods."

- The `.. note::` on line 580 should have a blank line following it

- On line 655, I think it should end with a bang `So, *don't be afraid of using categories!*` (sorry couldn't resist the pun)

- I believe the title `Not any conversion is a coercion` on line 696 should be "Not every conversion is a coercion"

- For the 5 axioms starting on line 725, shouldn't everything align (the blocks are one space less than the first line) for proper formatting?

- On line 793 there is a typo: `We have seen above that some onversions into our` (onversions -> conversions)

- Note block on line 935 needs a newline

- The `.. warning::` block on line 1536 needs a newline

For the record, I was reading it from the patch file and didn't look at the compiled doc, so some of these might be invalid.

One last thing, this is more from my personal taste, but I think the note/warning blocks should be capitalized as `.. NOTE::` and `.. WARNING::` to be consistent with the dev guide.

I'm sorry this turned into a bit of a laundry list of things. Thank you for this nice tutorial!

Best,

Travis

Didn't know that!

You mean "It does not even give a wrong answer, but results in an error"?

Really? But the html output looks fine in that location.

Looks fine in html.

Looks fine in html

That said, if it is sphinx convention to have a blank line, then I'll insert one.

On some ticket (don't remember which one), I recall that both look the same in the output, but I don't recall whether we want it capitalised or not. So, if you say the dev guide recommends capitalisation, then I'll change it.

Yes...

I'm just following [the conventions page](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html:) and that the `TESTS::` and `EXAMPLES::` blocks didn't format properly (although it might be because they are special).

You don't give negative examples in #14065. Do you mean things like the following?

```
sage: class Foo(Element):
....:     def __init__(self, x, parent=None):
....:         self.x = x
....:     def _repr_(self):
....:         return "<%s>"%self.x
....:     
sage: a = Foo(1,parent=ZZ)
sage: b = Foo(2,parent=ZZ)
sage: cmp(a,b)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: BUG: sort algorithm for elements of 'None' not implemented
```

Yes, in addition if you implement `__lt__` and like operators, it still breaks (for a easy version, inherit from `CombinatorialObject`, but then remove the `Element` inheritance and everything works).

```
This tutorial explains Sage's category and coercion framework by means of a
detailed example, namely a toy implementation of fraction fields and fraction
field elements.
```
belongs to the part above Outline. (and it's **detailed** with one 'l'). 

And then in "The parent" part you can say

```
Since we wish to implement a special kind of fields, namely, the fraction fields, it makes
sense to build on top of the base class :class:`sage.rings.ring.Field` provided by Sage.
```
(notice **namely, the fraction fields** that I added.)

PS: I just think that actually we only have *four* axioms for coercion, not five. What I give as first axiom ("coercion is defined on all elements, while a conversion could be a partial map") is technically a consequence of the second axiom ("coercions are morphisms").

So, shall I combine the two statements?

But I *explicitly* state in the text

```
You are encouraged to make your parent “unique”. That’s to say, parents should only evaluate equal if they are identical. Sage provides frameworks to create unique parents. We use here the most easy one: Inheriting from the class sage.structure.unique_representation.UniqueRepresentation is enough. Making parents unique can be quite important for an efficient implementation, because the repeated creation of “the same” parent would take a lot of time.
```

Do you really think this is not enough?

OK. The didactic approach is to develop the example step by step. But I think having the complete code in the appendix would be nice. Is there an automated way to typeset the code with linenumbers?

Note

UniqueRepresentation automatically provides our class with pickling, preserving the unique parent condition. If we had defined the class in some external module or in an interactive session, pickling would work immediately.

However, for making the example work in Sage’s doctesting framework, we need to assign our class as an attribute of the __main__ module, so that the class can be looked up during unpickling.

The confusion comes from the fact that you explain the code **before** showing the code (or at least saying that it is coming). There is also an inconsistency in the exposition, as you have the line 

```
sage: from sage.rings.ring import Field
```
but no similar line for `UniqueRepresentation`. I guess I might have waited for `sage.structure.unique_representation` to show up in the code, but it didn't.
Call me dyslexic :-).

After some trial and error upon reading [Sphinx manual](http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/code.htm), 
I found that the following will work with sphinx in Sage:

```
.. highlight:: python
   :linenothreshold: 2

::

   x = 2
   y = [1,2]
   x = y

.. highlight:: python
   :linenothreshold: 22222

```
the 1st `highlight::` turns on line numberings for fragments with 2 or more lines, and the 2nd `highlight::` effectively turns it off.

I explicitly imported Field, because this is what one needs to do when writing a module. So, I agree I should do the same with `UniqueRepresentation`.

By the way, it is a bit ironical:

```
sage: Q.gen()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: NewFrac(Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring) still using old coercion framework
```

I think that this error is totally misleading. Clearly, the new coercion model is used, is it not?

The test against the old coercion model simply asks whether `P._element_constructor` is not None: 

```
cdef inline check_old_coerce(parent.Parent p):
    if p._element_constructor is not None:
        raise RuntimeError, "%s still using old coercion framework" % p
```

Since `P._element_constructor` now seems to coincide with `P._element_constructor_`, this test is simply wrong. Similarly:

```
sage: def check_old_coerce(p):
....:     if p._element_constructor is not None:
....:         raise RuntimeError, "%s still using old coercion framework" % p
....:

sage: check_old_coerce(SymmetricFunctionAlgebra(QQ))
Traceback (most recent call last)
...

```

I think it is time to remove this test. But not on this ticket, of course.

Does this mean that one has to change some code here to take care of Volker's remark on [sage-devel](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.devel/64533) ?

I just see that I forgot to answer.

No, I believe using sage.rings.ring.Ring and friends as base classes is correct. If one wants to use generators (which I don't, in this tutorial), then one must implement it. Namely, the gen() method inherited from `ParentWithGens` belongs to the old coercion model.

So, no need to change the code here! Still needs review.
