For the latest patch, all doctests pass, and coverage is at 100%.

But, I think there will be a problem building the documentation unless the following line in algebra.rst is updated appropriately: 

```

Thanks Franco for the report! This should be fixed now. 

Chris, I also modified the documentation of the k_schur_noncommutative_variables, since it now only works for affine type A, but the documentation had not been updated.

I set it back to positive review since all issues were fixed.
