The mpi4py spkg relies on 
* either the optional openmpi spkg, or
* a standard mpi compiler wrapper (like `mpic++`) in the path
If neither is installed, the installation of mpi4py fails. The error message should be amended to point the user to the openmpi spkg, or explain how to use the `MPICXX` etc. environment variables.
