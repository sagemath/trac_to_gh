This is NOT the same as #11260, as far as I can tell.

```
test -d binary-ecl || mkdir binary-ecl
ecl -norc -eval '(progn (load "../lisp-utils/defsystem.lisp") (funcall (intern (symbol-name :operate-on-system) :mk) "maxima" :compile :verbose t) (build-maxima-lib))' -eval '(ext:quit)'
;;; Loading */home/.../build/maxima-5.23.p2.p0/src/src/../lisp-utils/defsystem.lisp"
An error occurred during initialization:
Filesystem error with pathname #P"SYS:CMP.NEWEST".
Either
 1) the file does not exist, or
 2) we are not allow to access the file, or
 3) the pathname points to a broken symbolic link.
```
and then the build quits.

A similar bug was reported at one point on #6517, though it seems to have been resolved without that occurring again.

A very similar problem was reported at [this Maxima list thread](http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2009/017432.html), and it was resolved by updating defsystem.lisp.  We have defsystem 3.4 interim 3 in our current spkg.

A similar, but probably not that closely related, problem is also reported [here](http://compgroups.net/comp.lang.lisp/ECL+Windows+MinGW32), where it seems to be related to mismatched versions of something as well.

The bug report for that report ([here](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2803755&group_id=4933&atid=104933)), by the way, was closed after no one followed up on it and Maxima had upgrade a fair amount in the meantime.  But it's not clear that particular issue was resolved.  

Also, it's very hard to find defsystem.lisp.  Apparently it's still being developed, but it's very hard to find out where...

Weirdly, I also now have a successful build of Maxima on Cygwin on the same XP machine.  It even works from `./sage -maxima`!  

This is not a positive review or anything; probably the error once in a while doesn't happen.  Just reporting.

Well, I first have to get a working Cygwin on XP again, which will take at least another week.    Let's say if I don't by the new year, we close the ticket.

Mike, do you think you could start a Sage build from scratch with the new (Lion, #11884) Maxima package on the XP image you have access to and see what happens?

With sage-4.7.2 and the newest Cygwin and the new Maxima and ECL packages for Lion, I didn't have problems getting this to work.

I didn't have any problems with this on Sage 4.7.2 with the latest Maxima and ECL spkgs.
