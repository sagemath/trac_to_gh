... unless asked to do so.

I am talking about the line 687 in sage.scheme.elliptic_curves_ell_local_data  which reads

```
        principal_flag = P.is_principal()
        if principal_flag:
            pi = P.gens_reduced()[0]
            verbose("P is principal, generator pi = %s"%pi, t, 1)
        else:
            pi = K.uniformizer(P, 'positive')
            verbose("P is not principal, uniformizer pi = %s"%pi, t, 1)
```

While it can be useful, especially when one wants a global minimal model, it is often very harmful. If the class group of the field is huge or difficult to compute, one will not be able to determine the fibres of the Neron model, simply because of this line.

One should add a switch which is by default set to use the second case and only if needed to the first case.

Of course, in an ideal world Tate's algorithm should be implemented for any elliptic curve over a local field, rather than a number field.

That is a sensible suggestion, and if you write a patch I'll review it!  Ideally I would like the code to say "if you know that P is principal and have a generator, the use it, otherwise...", but I suppose that is what the uniformizer function might do anyway.

I think that even if we did have a version for Tate's algorithm which applied directly to an elliptic curve over a local field, I would still want a global version -- which used generators of prime ideals for fields of class number 1 at least!

This patch does what I suggested + it also changes global_minimal_model. This function was only implemented when the class number was 1, now it tries to change to a global minimal model in any field.

The patch should be applied after #11540.
