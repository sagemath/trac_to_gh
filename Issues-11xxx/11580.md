Hi Nils,

Can you add 

```
sage: R.<x,y,z>=QQ[]
sage: f=x^2+3*y
sage: magma(f).sage()        # optional - magma
x^2 + 3*y  # or whatever
```
as a doctest in interfaces/magma.py or somewhere?

This patch breaks conversion of finite field elements from Magma to Sage.

Without patch:

```
sage: magma(GF(2)(1)).sage()
1
```
With patch:

```
sage: magma(GF(2)(1)).sage()
...
Segmentation fault
...
Magma crashed executing `_sage_`[3], `_sage_`[4] := Sage(_sage_[2]);
```
With patch:

```
sage -t -only-optional=magma devel/sage/sage/rings/finite_rings/element_givaro.pyx
(same crash)
```

When converting finite field elements from Magma to Sage, they are first converted to a `SeqEnum` of finite field elments. In particular, a proper implementation of conversions of `SeqEnum` to Sage sets of an infinite loop. This was fixed in #11456, so we should rebase this patch on top of #11456.
