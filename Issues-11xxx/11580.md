<a id='comment:9'></a>This patch breaks conversion of finite field elements from Magma to Sage.

Without patch:

```
sage: magma(GF(2)(1)).sage()
1
```
With patch:

```
sage: magma(GF(2)(1)).sage()
...
Segmentation fault
...
Magma crashed executing _sage_[3], _sage_[4] := Sage(_sage_[2]);
```
With patch:

```
sage -t -only-optional=magma devel/sage/sage/rings/finite_rings/element_givaro.pyx
(same crash)
```

When converting finite field elements from Magma to Sage, they are first converted to a `SeqEnum` of finite field elments. In particular, a proper implementation of conversions of `SeqEnum` to Sage sets of an infinite loop. This was fixed in #11456, so we should rebase this patch on top of #11456.

Rebased on top of #11456.

Removed the function `"intrinsic Sage(X::SeqEnum) -> MonStgElt, BoolElt"`, because it was equal (modulo documentation) to the one in #11456.
