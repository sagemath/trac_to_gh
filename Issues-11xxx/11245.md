on Windows 7 tar does not unpack cddlib spkg correctly, symbolic 
links get broken. See
http://groups.google.com/group/sage-windows/browse_thread/thread/d4965bfbc83a9bf8 and http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.os.cygwin/127433

A remedy is to replace them with files, i.e. use tar with -h option to recreate the spkg---on a machine where tar works, certainly. Works for me. Something along the following
lines:

```
/* on a Unix, with good tar: */
$ tar xjf foo.spkg
$ tar chjf foo.spkg foo/
$ tar xjf foo.spkg
$ sage -spkg foo
$ scp foo.spkg win7cygwinhost:/sageroot/spkg/standard/
```

This is a list of all spkgs containing symbolic links:
1. cddlib
2. iml
3. libm4ri
4. networkx
5. r
But it seems only cddlib and networkx are affected.

Using

tar -format=posix

might be more reliable. Sun's tar command can't extract the archives created in Sage.

It's a different story here. Actually, it is a GNU tar ported to create some kind of Windows symlinks. It does not untar files it itself creates correctly...

I can confirm that this enables building of cddlib on Windows 7.  

While waiting to try for other things, I have a question.  The process is 

1. Untar
2. Tar with links followed
3. Untar again
4. Use `sage -pkg` to create the new spkg

So does that mean that the untarred one the second time does have the followed links, not just symbolic ones?  I guess I am curious as to why steps 3 and 4 are needed, though I assume it is in order to get the correct spkg checking.

right, 1,2 and 3 replace links by file copies, and 4 makes a kosher spkg.
This must be done on a system with working tar, not on Win7, obviously... 

In fact, hopefully Cygwin will have a patched tar soon, patch supplied by Dan Grayson (yes, the K-theorist!), and this won't be needed.

Yes, I saw that on your thread :)

But until that time (which would also fix some of our other problems, iirc) we might as well have this option.

I wonder if most spkgs just don't have symlinks?  It would seem weird to me, in a source package, but maybe it's normal.

Any ideas on how to make this 'portable', or would we just have a special Cygwin-only version of the spkg?

Cygwin developers finally managed to reproduce the problem:
http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.os.cygwin/127433

it boils down to a bug/feature introduced in 1.7.9, and not really related to tar itself; so apparently it will be fixed soon.

My sense is that Dima wouldn't have made the networkx package still if it was working properly.  I didn't even try without it, though, and am having other problems with my build currently, so I'm not going to be able to in the immediate future.

> cddlib needs to be rebased to #12131.

I understand the prerogative to merge a massive spkg bomb by the release manager.  But considering that this has had positive review for 10 days - *since before #12131 even existed!!!* - it seems like it would have been reasonable to merge this first.  

It's just not that easy to test that things still work on Cygwin, and now I will have to wait until I (or someone else) gets access to make sure this new spkg from #12131 still works there, and to do Dima's little trick to it, and make that a p10.  And by then I'm sure something *else* will happen to networkx and we'll have to change that one.

Sorry, just had to get that out.  I understand that OpenSUSE is more important than Cygwin for now.  Though hopefully if we ever get Cygwin going, we'll have several orders of magnitude more downloads of it than any Linux other than Ubuntu...

I understand the prerogative to merge a massive spkg bomb by the release manager.  But considering that this has had positive review for 10 days - *since before #12131 even existed!!! * - it seems like it would have been reasonable to merge this first.

Why is this specific to `cddlib`?  *Any* of the 29 packages merged in #12131 could be broken in Cygwin.

Haha!  Good point... maybe I need to start another build of the "proto" alpha5 tonight.

Except that mpir doesn't work because of the yasm business (if not other things) - #12115.  And going all the way up to 2.5 looks like a big deal, one I don't want to do without the experts who actually use those big integers on a daily basis.

I'd feel most comfortable actually trying this out on a Win 7 box (where the problem is) but I won't have access to one for quite some time now, afaik. But this is the part I was most worried about - I don't quite understand why this change makes the difference (Dima does, of course) and so I was hoping to test it.  I guess if Volker vouches that he carried out the "special instructions" we can be reasonably confident.  :)  Thanks.

I find the date order of the SPKG.txt info amusing as well.
