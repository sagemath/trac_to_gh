The attached patch adds to the Sage testsuite most examples appearing Chapters 6 and 8 (Polynomials, Polynomial Systems) of the French book [Calcul mathématique avec Sage](http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/). See #9395 for some background.

All tests pass with sage 5.5.

Sure, I can take a look:

* Please rename the patch to have the ".patch" suffix.
* There might be an issue with the UTF-8, but we should try and wait if anybody complaints.
* Do you really want to include an autogenerated file without any manual post processing? ("This file was *autogenerated* from sagebook.tex with sagetex.sty")
* Please add your full name to the author field here on Trac.
* I get some numerical noise errors:

Martin, on which platform do you get numerical noise errors? With Sage 4.7 on a 64-bit Core 2,
I get no difference.

I wonder why we get different results for `x`. If all computations are based on IEEE 754, we should get the same (wrong) value. Is it possible to know which components of Sage are used for `J.variety(RDF)` on each platform? On mine I get:

```
sage: get_systems('J.variety(RDF)')                          
['MPFI', 'Singular', 'numpy', 'ginac']
```
Since MPFI is based on MPFR, MPFI should be architecture independent, but I wonder if the same applies to Singular, numpy and ginac...

yes, or with a different rounding precision. Anyway, it might be worth tracking down this issue. Jeroen, is there a way to trace the calls to the different Sage components (MPFI, Singular, numpy, ginac)?

Well, the test obviously indicate that there is a problem somewhere, and I tend to believe that we should keep the test and track the problem.

Either your computation is ill-conditioned, and the test should be removed from Sage (and probably also from the book), or there is a component of sage that misbehaves. We should understand what the situation is, and act accordingly. These tests have been there for 1.5 years, so we are not in a hurry.  Maybe we could compare intermediate results on different machines?
