Martin, please could you review this? This will help our book to be more stable with future
versions of Sage. Thank you in advance (as a coauthor of the book, I'm quite reluctant to

Sure, I can take a look:

* Please rename the patch to have the ".patch" suffix.
* There might be an issue with the UTF-8, but we should try and wait if anybody complaints.
* Do you really want to include an autogenerated file without any manual post processing? ("This file was *autogenerated* from sagebook.tex with sagetex.sty")
* Please add your full name to the author field here on Trac.
* I get some numerical noise errors:

```python
File "/mnt/usb1/scratch/malb/sage-4.7.2/devel/sage/sage/tests/french_book/mpoly.py", line 373:
    sage: [CDF['x'](p(y=ys[0][0])).roots() for p in J.gens()]
Expected:
    [[(-0.6 - 1.30624677741e-16*I, 1), (0.6 + 1.30624677741e-16*I, 1)],

Martin, on which platform do you get numerical noise errors? With Sage 4.7 on a 64-bit Core 2,
I get no difference.

Well, the test obviously indicate that there is a problem somewhere, and I tend to believe that we should keep the test and track the problem.

Either your computation is ill-conditioned, and the test should be removed from Sage (and probably also from the book), or there is a component of sage that misbehaves. We should understand what the situation is, and act accordingly. These tests have been there for 1.5 years, so we are not in a hurry.
