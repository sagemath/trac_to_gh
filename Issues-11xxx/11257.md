In the generic structure of element, a coercion is called to compute an element z to the power of 0 : z^0

The goal of this ticket is trying to replace all call of Parent(1) by Parent.one() to avoid the coercion. (and hope Sage is ready for a such change...)

Before :

```
sage: K = CyclotomicField(46)
sage: z = K.gen()
sage: %prun z^0
         11 function calls in 0.000 CPU seconds

   Ordered by: internal time

   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 number_field.py:4871(_coerce_non_number_field_element_in)
        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 <string>:1(<module>)

        4    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {isinstance}
        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 number_field.py:4210(absolute_polynomial_ntl)
        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 gap.py:1299(is_GapElement)
        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'disable' of '_lsprof.Profiler' objects}

sage: %prun z^3
         2 function calls in 0.000 CPU seconds

   Ordered by: internal time

   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 <string>:1(<module>)
        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'disable' of '_lsprof.Profiler' objects}
```

And for the speed :

```
sage: timeit('z^0')
625 loops, best of 3: 28 µs per loop
sage: timeit('z^3')
625 loops, best of 3: 7.78 µs per loop
```

depends on #9138

Bonjour Nicolas!

Thanks for your work on that. Please investigate the test failure reported by the patchbot, and double check that TestSuite is run on every parent that you modified. While we are at it, we probably want to implement ``.one()`` as a cached_method. I am not sure about the deletion of trailing whitespaces outside of the lines you change anyway, as this is subject to making conflicts.

Ah, and do we want to do the same for .zero()?

Amitiés,
                         Nicolas

But if you mean to make .zero() and .one() a cached method of the parent class of a category, then in fact #11115 is needed in order to make the cache work on those parent structures that do not allow attribute assignment.",

Hi Nicolas,

Replying to [@nthiery](#comment:4):
> While we are at it, we probably want to implement .one() as a cached_method. I am not sure about the deletion of trailing whitespaces outside of the lines you change anyway, as this is subject to making conflicts.  
> Ah, and do we want to do the same for .zero()?

I suspect that question is partially addressed to me, as it may relate with #11115?

I didn't look at the patch. But if you mean to make .zero() and .one() a cached method of the parent class of a category, then in fact #11115 is needed in order to make the cache work on those parent structures that do not allow attribute assignment.

Oops, this is going far beyond what I expected! I just meant to add
TestSuite, and skip tests not related to zero / one. Now, this is not
wasted time, so thanks! One should just be careful that this does not
overlap with changes by Simon.

Cheers,

I don't have the time to verify whether there is an overlap. But: *If* there is an overlap then it is with #9944 or #9138. These two tickets try to make all rings use the category framework properly, and in some cases it also provides them with the new coercion model.

If what you do is about something else but rings, then it is very likely that there is no overlap.
