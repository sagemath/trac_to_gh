In the generic structure of element, a coercion is called to compute an element z to the power of 0 : z^0

The goal of this ticket is trying to replace all call of Parent(1) by Parent.one() to avoid the coercion. (and hope Sage is ready for a such change...)

Bonjour Nicolas!

Thanks for your work on that. Please investigate the test failure reported by the patchbot, and double check that TestSuite is run on every parent that you modified. While we are at it, we probably want to implement ``.one()`` as a cached_method. I am not sure about the deletion of trailing whitespaces outside of the lines you change anyway, as this is subject to making conflicts.

Ah, and do we want to do the same for .zero()?

Amitiés,
                         Nicolas

I suspect that question is partially addressed to me, as it may relate with #11115?

I didn't look at the patch. But if you mean to make .zero() and .one() a cached method of the parent class of a category, then in fact #11115 is needed in order to make the cache work on those parent structures that do not allow attribute assignment.

    "body": "<a id='comment:8'></a>\nI tried to do the best... Fix the TestSuite on old parents is not a simple job. Especially when one doesn't know enough about old category system... I fix properly the categories of affected parents, but I do not know how to do for the elements (especially when there is some facade with a separate implementation of the elements).\n\n(((\nsage: w = SymmetricGroup(2)([2,1])\nsage: G = ArithmeticSubgroup_Permutation(w, w)\nsage: G.category()\nCategory of facade groups\nsage: TestSuite(G).run(skip=['_test_elements'])\n)))\n\nI think I passed already a lot of time on these parents (major part of today of trying to understand what they represent mathematically speaking...). Especially for the FreeMonoid feature. In the new category framework, the example of monoid (i.e. \"Monoids().example()\") is the free monoid. And the one coming from the category framework inherit of a LOT of top level methods. I try to fix FreeMonoidElement in sage/monoid with categories but if the choice was mine, I would just overwrite the 2005 version with these coming from category...\n\nHoping the patchbot will be happy this time! The patch does already much more than the ticket!",

I tried to do the best... Fix the TestSuite on old parents is not a simple job. Especially when one doesn't know enough about old category system... I fix properly the categories of affected parents, but I do not know how to do for the elements (especially when there is some facade with a separate implementation of the elements).

(((
sage: w = SymmetricGroup(2)([2,1])
sage: G = ArithmeticSubgroup_Permutation(w, w)
sage: G.category()
Category of facade groups
sage: TestSuite(G).run(skip=['_test_elements'])
)))

I think I passed already a lot of time on these parents (major part of today of trying to understand what they represent mathematically speaking...). Especially for the FreeMonoid feature. In the new category framework, the example of monoid (i.e. "Monoids().example()") is the free monoid. And the one coming from the category framework inherit of a LOT of top level methods. I try to fix FreeMonoidElement in sage/monoid with categories but if the choice was mine, I would just overwrite the 2005 version with these coming from category...

Hoping the patchbot will be happy this time! The patch does already much more than the ticket!

Oops, this is going far beyond what I expected! I just meant to add
TestSuite, and skip tests not related to zero / one. Now, this is not
wasted time, so thanks! One should just be careful that this does not
overlap with changes by Simon.

Cheers,

I don't have the time to verify whether there is an overlap. But: *If* there is an overlap then it is with #9944 or #9138. These two tickets try to make all rings use the category framework properly, and in some cases it also provides them with the new coercion model.

If what you do is about something else but rings, then it is very likely that there is no overlap.

Simon
