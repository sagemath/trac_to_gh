------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.

I don't understand why you have both stopped the discussion without concluding on the status of this patch.

I have no problem when installing the patch and building the documentation.
The function tests correctly that the parameter is or is not a vertex of the graph.

For me the patch is correct, so I give a positive review. 

Best,
David.

Hello,
It would be nice if the KeyError method could take an extra argument to describe the error. For instance KeyError(key, 'You should add some tests to your algorithm!'). 
Unfortunately, I'm not able to find the documentation of the KeyError function.

However, according to the documentation of Python, the raise method can handle multiple arguments: 
`raise_stmt ::=  "raise" [expression ["," expression ["," expression]]]`
See: http://docs.python.org/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise
It may help satisfying both of you ;-)

Best,
David.
