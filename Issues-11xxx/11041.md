I agree that there should be native 2-descent implemented which would work over number fields (and be an alternative to mwrank over Q).

There is a good description of the method in Simon's LMS JCM paper, and rather a lot of it has been implemented by various people.  I also have my own Magma version which might be a useful starting point.
