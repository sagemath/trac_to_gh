There are many concerns about simon_two_descent().
See tickets: #5153, #9322, #10735, #10745, #10832, #11005, #15483.

As a step toward implementing a general framework for Selmer group computations as discussed in #11039. A native implementation of the "number field method" for computed 2-Selmer groups should be produced.

I agree that there should be native 2-descent implemented which would work over number fields (and be an alternative to mwrank over Q).

There is a good description of the method in Simon's LMS JCM paper, and rather a lot of it has been implemented by various people.  I also have my own Magma version which might be a useful starting point.
