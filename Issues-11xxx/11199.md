It would be convenient if quotient ring elements would be callable like polynomials. This is currently not the case:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: I = R.ideal(x)
sage: Q = R.quotient_ring(I)
sage: Q
Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field by the ideal (x)
sage: Q.inject_variables()
Defining xbar, ybar
sage: p = xbar + ybar
sage: p(1,1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/vbraun/opt/sage-4.7.alpha4/devel/sage-main/<ipython console> in <module>()

TypeError: 'QuotientRingElement' object is not callable
```

The attached patch implements this functionality by handing the argument through to the lift. 

Arguably, it should check that the result does not depend on the presentation. Pro: catches errors; Con: potentially slow, ideal membership test necessary if arguments are polynomials.

Even with the extra warning in the docstring, users could very easily be misled.
For to make the evaluation independent of the lift it is necessary
for the ideal defining the quotient to annihilate the argument.

I think it would be sensible to have a parameter 'check' with default True, and a 
clause like:

```
if check and any(g(args) !=0 for g in f.parent().defining_ideal().gens()):
    raise ValueError, "argument not in the zero set of the ideal"
```
That way an unthinking user is not going to be caught out, while someone who 
knows what they're doing can speed things up by setting 'check=False'.
