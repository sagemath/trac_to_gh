When reading a question on ask.sagemath I realized that %hide doesn't work properly when printing.  This is the same bug as #5718 which was fixed 2 years ago. 

If you add %hide to a cell then the output is hidden in the notebook just fine, but when printing the worksheet the entire cell is displayed as if it were not hidden (e.g. it's not even greyed out).   This was on sagenb.org with Safari 5.1.1.

Can you try this in vanilla Sage 4.7.1, Ivan?   Just in case it happened during the migration to flask, it would be good to identify that.
