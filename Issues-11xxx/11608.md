As the summary says, this patch improves eigenvalues of matrices with double-precision floating-point entries.

1. Uses SciPy's `eigh` routine for symmetric and Hermitian matrices.
2. Allows grouping of "equal" eigenvalues, based on a tolerance parameter.

**Apply:**
1. [attachment: trac_11608-eigenvalues-symmetric-multiplicity-rebase.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11608/trac_11608-eigenvalues-symmetric-multiplicity-rebase.patch.gz)

The `algorithm='symmetric'` keyword is meant to allow the routine accomodate both base rings (RDF/CDF) while also allowing a user to specify that a matrix is known to be symmetric.  In this case, the conversion from CDF to RDF is made by the routine and then the SciPy behavior that Volker notes will take place.

Any suggestions on making the docstring clearer?  Maybe saying "then applies the algorithm for Hermitian matrices" should be stated differently?

ATLAS is from Fedora, CPU is a Sandy-Bridge i7 quad-core. 

Minor nitpicks while we are at it:
* Can you return a tuple (=immutable) instead of a list?
* the symmetric docstring, how about: "converts `self` to a real matrix and applies the algorithm for Hermitian matrices". Note: technically you convert (explicit), not coerce (implicit).
* in the hermitian docstring, how about: "uses the :meth:`~scipy.linalg.eigh` method from SciPy, which applies only to real symmetric or complex Hermitian matrices. Since...". This would make it clear that the `syevr` implementation is used if possible.
* the ".. warning::" block is not indented, so it is not typeset correctly.

Thanks, I'll increase the tolerance and that should work better across platforms.  You'd think I'd get the hang of this numerical stuff...


> Minor nitpicks while we are at it:

I'm not opposed, but other eigenvalue routines return mutable objects.  I'd prefer to do one grand change across all matrix types, on a single-purpose ticket of its own.

```
sage: A = matrix(QQ, [[1]])
sage: ev=A.eigenvalues()   
sage: type(ev)
<class 'sage.structure.sequence.Sequence_generic'>
sage: ev[0]=5
sage: ev
[5]
```

Thanks for the nits.  I'll make some changes right now.

Thanks, Volker!

This was built on various 5.0-beta's, so I just double-checked that it applies, tests and builds on 5.0-rc0.

I thought this was OK and I just triple-checked, and I think it is OK.  One change: made "warning" all capital letters, this is the only change to the v2 version of the update patch.

The HTML documentation renders the warning blocks as they should.  I'm going to move this back to positive review.
