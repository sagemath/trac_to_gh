This ticket adds 3 functions to the NumberField class, 1 function to the RelativeNumberField class, and modifies 1 function of the NumberFieldElement class. For number fields, there's now a function that checks if self is a CM field, a function that returns the complex conjugation map of self (if self is contained in a CM field), and a function that finds the maximal totally real subfield of self. In the relative case, there's a function that checks if self is a CM extension. Finally, the conjugate function of NumberFieldElement is enhanced giving it the ability to compute the complex conjugate of any element in any totally real or CM field.

This is a useful enhancement which seems to work well.  I have one suggestion for improving the code and a few minor niggles.

It seems to me that rather than computing the conjugate of elements of a CM field by doing a separate calculation for each element, it would be better to define the conjugation automorphism of the field.  The following draft code seems to do the job:

```
    def conjugation(self):
        """
        Returns the conjugation automorphism for a CM field.
        """
        if self.is_absolute(): 
            K = self
        else:
            K = self.absolute_field('z')
        phi = [phi for F, phi, _ in K.subfields(K.degree()/2) if F.is_totally_real()][0]
        K_rel = K.relativize(phi, 'z')
        z0 = K_rel.gen()
        z0_conj = -z0 - K_rel.defining_polynomial()[1]
        z0_conj_abs = K_rel.structure()[0](z0_conj)
        if self.is_absolute(): 
            return End(self)([z0_conj_abs])
        else:
            return End(self)(K.hom([K.structure()[0](z0_conj_abs)]))
```
The above draft is, of course, lacking
* doctests,
* caching,
* checking that `self` is  indeed a CM field, and 
* dealing with the special cases of totally real, quadratic and  cyclotomic fields.  

If `conjugation` is defined, `conjugate` could be defined as:

```
    def conjugate(self):
        return self.parent().conjugation()(self)
```
A number of other, minor things:

In the docstring for `is_CM`

```
       The following is a non-cyclotomic CM field.
       
       ::
           
           sage: M.<a> = NumberField(x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1)
```
the wording is a bit misleading since `M` is (isomorphic to) a cyclotomic field.

The lines

```
           sage: P.<y> = PolynomialRing(E_0)
           sage: E.<b> = E_0.extension(P(y^2 + 1)) 
```
can be more simply written as

```
           sage: E.<b> = E_0.extension(x^2 + 1) 
```
Similarly for the `K.<j>` example in `conjugate`

In the code for `is_CM`, the lines

```
        try:
            return self.__is_CM
        except:
            pass
```
ought to be

```
        try:
            return self.__is_CM
        except Attribute_Error:
            pass
```
see  [Developer's Guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_in_python.html#exceptions).

Thanks to Francis Clarke for the review and comments. It's a great idea to have the complex conjugation map, so I've set it up that way. Also new is that I added a function is_CM_extension to the relative number field case, as well as a function maximal_totally_real_subfield to the number field class.

The problem with naming relativized extensions is, of course, a (minor) bug in `relativize`.  But it is probably best left for now.

The code looks good, and doctests pass.  

One or two little things (all except the first are really questions of style):

* The line break in lines 1933-34 of `number_field.py` introduces unwanted space (scroll across to see it):

```
sage:  NumberField(x^3 - 2, 'a').complex_conjugation()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: Complex conjugation is only well-defined for fields contained in CM                fields.
```

* At line 2038

```
        self.__max_tot_real_sub = self.subfield(zeta + zeta**(-1))
```
 is simpler, and quicker except in small cases.

* Lines 2052 to 2055 could more simply be replaced by

```
        for i in d.divisors()[1:]: 
```

* I personally find doctests such as

```
sage: Q.<a> = NumberField(x - 1)
sage: Q.is_CM() 
False 
sage: K.<i> = NumberField(x^2 + 1) 
sage: K.is_CM() 
True 
sage: L.<zeta20> = CyclotomicField(20) 
sage: L.is_CM() 
True 
```
 more readable as

```
sage: NumberField(x - 1, a).is_CM() 
False 
sage: NumberField(x^2 + 1, i).is_CM() 
True 
sage: CyclotomicField(20).is_CM() 
True 
```

I don't think this does the job.  The second example

```
        sage: d = a^253 
        sage: (d+d.conjugate()).is_real_positive() 
```
 will take just as long if the first one isn't executed.  It's only quicker after the first because conjugation has been cached.

But computation of the conjugation automorphism can be greatly speeded up by a minor change.  What's taking the time is the following step:

```
sage: %timeit K.hom([a^-1])
5 loops, best of 3: 29 s per loop
```
But checking can be turned off, since we know that this does define an automorphism.  Thus

```
sage: %timeit K.hom([a^-1], check=False)
125 loops, best of 3: 3.28 ms per loop
```
Several speed-ups of this kind occur in the patch to #10843 (still waiting a review).

So I conclude that the long-time patch is unnecessary, but that a minor change should be made in the new line 1926 of the definition of complex_conjugation.

 > (just mention the review in the comments, don't change the status).

I haven't changed the status, but I believe that "needs work" is where it should be.

Could you make that change, since you obviously understand what's going on in this patch.
