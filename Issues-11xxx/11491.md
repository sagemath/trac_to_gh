This looks fine, though you must have fixed a lot of other newlines. 

For some reason I can't get this to update the doc.  The patch is correct, but seems to not be working right in terms of getting Sage to "see" it.  I've had this problem other times with Sphinx, so I am tempted to give it positive review anyway.  Currently building pdf doc to see what happens.
