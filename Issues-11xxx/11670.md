For example, these are all wrong:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 - x - 1)
sage: loads(dumps(K)) is K
False
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - x - 1)
sage: loads(dumps(K)) is K
False
sage: K.<a> = CyclotomicField(7)
sage: loads(dumps(K)) is K
False
```


NOTE: To keep this project manageable for now, this ticket does *not* address similar issues for relative number fields, if there are any. 

This is related to #10448.

When working on this ticket, I also found a potentially serious bug, which is that the parameters `assume_disc_small` and `maximize_at_primes` of a number field were both lost upon pickling and unpickling. This ticket fixes that.   We used to have this bug:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3-2, assume_disc_small=True, maximize_at_primes=[2], latex_name='\\alpha', embedding=2^(1/3))
sage: K._assume_disc_small

sage: K._maximize_at_primes

sage: L = loads(dumps(K))
sage: L._assume_disc_small

sage: L._maximize_at_primes  # None
```

Attached patch fixes that.

If I can fix it then I'll post a patch here, not at #10667.

```
sage: N = NumberField(x^12 - 4*x^11 + 6*x^10 - 5*x^9 + 5*x^8 - 9*x^7 + 21*x^6 - 9*x^5 + 5*x^4 - 5*x^3 + 6*x^2 - 4*x + 1, 'a')

sage: M
Number Field in a6 with defining polynomial x^12 - 4*x^11 + 6*x^10 - 5*x^9 + 5*x^8 - 9*x^7 + 21*x^6 - 9*x^5 + 5*x^4 - 5*x^3 + 6*x^2 - 4*x + 1
sage: N is M.change_names(names='a')
False
sage: N == M.change_names(names='a')

```

I guess it can be fixed in the `change_names` method.

Aha, it boils down to one line in `N.absolute_field`:

```python
        try:

        except KeyError:
            pass

Why is the option `cache=False` used in that method?

I see a potential work-around. In my example, we have

```
sage: N = NumberField(x^12 - 4*x^11 + 6*x^10 - 5*x^9 + 5*x^8 - 9*x^7 + 21*x^6 - 9*x^5 + 5*x^4 - 5*x^3 + 6*x^2 - 4*x + 1, 'a')
sage: M = N.optimized_representation()[0]
sage: K = M.change_names(names='a')
sage: N == K
True
sage: N is K
False
sage: N.structure()
(Ring Coercion endomorphism of Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^12 - 4*x^11 + 6*x^10 - 5*x^9 + 5*x^8 - 9*x^7 + 21*x^6 - 9*x^5 + 5*x^4 - 5*x^3 + 6*x^2 - 4*x + 1, Ring Coercion endomorphism of Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^12 - 4*x^11 + 6*x^10 - 5*x^9 + 5*x^8 - 9*x^7 + 21*x^6 - 9*x^5 + 5*x^4 - 5*x^3 + 6*x^2 - 4*x + 1)
sage: K.structure()
(Isomorphism given by variable name change map:
  From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^12 - 4*x^11 + 6*x^10 - 5*x^9 + 5*x^8 - 9*x^7 + 21*x^6 - 9*x^5 + 5*x^4 - 5*x^3 + 6*x^2 - 4*x + 1
  To:   Number Field in a6 with defining polynomial x^12 - 4*x^11 + 6*x^10 - 5*x^9 + 5*x^8 - 9*x^7 + 21*x^6 - 9*x^5 + 5*x^4 - 5*x^3 + 6*x^2 - 4*x + 1, Isomorphism given by variable name change map:
  From: Number Field in a6 with defining polynomial x^12 - 4*x^11 + 6*x^10 - 5*x^9 + 5*x^8 - 9*x^7 + 21*x^6 - 9*x^5 + 5*x^4 - 5*x^3 + 6*x^2 - 4*x + 1
  To:   Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^12 - 4*x^11 + 6*x^10 - 5*x^9 + 5*x^8 - 9*x^7 + 21*x^6 - 9*x^5 + 5*x^4 - 5*x^3 + 6*x^2 - 4*x + 1)
```

Would it make sense to declare two number fields different if they have different `structure()`?

With the branch I just pushed, I got rid of ``_set_structure``. The structure of a number field is now always set when it is created. I know that unpickling of old objects is currently broken, I'm working on a fix. Anyway, maybe somebody already wants to have a look at what I have done so far? Any comments would be appreciated.

Should I now add old number field pickles to the pickle jar? I could not find out how to do this from the reference manual. Or is this somehow done automagically?

Pickling of old and new number fields should work now. I found these issues though.

Absolute number fields used to forget about their structure, this is fixed now (of course the structure can not be recovered for old pickles):

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: L.<b> = K.change_names()
sage: M=loads(dumps(L))
sage: M.structure() # old behaviour
(Ring Coercion endomorphism of Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 - 2,
 Ring Coercion endomorphism of Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 - 2)
sage: L.structure() # this is what M.structure() returns now
(Isomorphism given by variable name change map:
  From: Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 - 2
  To:   Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2,
 Isomorphism given by variable name change map:
  From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2
  To:   Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 - 2)
```

Relative number fields also used to forget about their structure. Since I have not touched the pickling of relative number fields, I would rather put this into a separate ticket:

```
sage:             sage: Z = var('Z')
sage:             sage: K.<w> = NumberField(Z^3 + Z + 1)
sage:             sage: L.<z> = K.extension(Z^3 + 2)
sage:             sage: M.<u,v> = L.change_names()
sage:             sage: M.structure()
(Isomorphism given by variable name change map:
  From: Number Field in u with defining polynomial x^3 + 2 over its base field
  To:   Number Field in z with defining polynomial Z^3 + 2 over its base field,
 Isomorphism given by variable name change map:
  From: Number Field in z with defining polynomial Z^3 + 2 over its base field
  To:   Number Field in u with defining polynomial x^3 + 2 over its base field)
sage:             sage: M = loads(dumps(M))
sage:             sage: M.structure()
(Ring Coercion endomorphism of Number Field in u with defining polynomial x^3 + 2 over its base field,
 Ring Coercion endomorphism of Number Field in u with defining polynomial x^3 + 2 over its base field)
```

I think it is indeed important that if one considers fields equipped with a `structure` (in the sense of this ticket), then (1) the `structure` should be fixed once and for all at the time of construction, and (2) no two fields with a different `structure` should be considered as equal.  Given (1), it would be good to to have a clear picture of what sort of things one can specify as a `structure`, and I would be interested in finding out how flexible this concept of `structure` is.

For example, it would be nice to be able to equip a number field *K* with an additional "piece of structure" *z* such that there is a category (in the mathematical sense) in which the objects are such pairs (*K*, *z*) and in which there exists at most one morphism between any two objects.  Then (a suitable finite representation of) *z* could be taken as an especially nice type of `structure` in the above sense.

One particular "piece of structure" that comes to mind is an embedding *z* of *K* into a fixed algebraic closure of **Q**.  In Sage, this means an embedding into `QQbar`.  Since `QQbar` encodes field elements (roughly speaking) by a polynomial and a complex root, represented by a sufficiently small complex region to determine the root uniquely, specifying *z* really means giving a small complex region representing a root of the defining polynomial of *K*.

Now it is already the case that one can specify an `embedding` parameter when creating a number field.  Hence (finally) the following question: does the concept of a `structure` in the sense of this ticket allow the existing `embedding` parameter to be implemented as a special case of a `structure`?

Doesn't "unique parents" mean precisely that parents are equal if and only if they are identical (see the third paragraph of [this page](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/coercion_and_categories.html))?

<a id='comment:31'></a>
I see what you mean.  Maybe one could try to formalise the notion of "unique parents" more precisely as follows.

We have some Python callable `NumberField()` that takes as input some key (defining datum) `d` and outputs some Python object `K` depending on `d` and representing a number field.  This `NumberField()` uses (implicitly) some algorithm, say `same(d, e)`, that given two keys `d` and `e` decides whether `d` and `e` define the same number field.  (The meaning of "the same" is a bit vague; one could either use a mathematical definition involving extra structure on the number field, or one could take "the same" to mean by definition that `same(d, e)` returns True.)

Of course, `same` should behave like an equivalence relation (`same(d, d) == True`, `same(d, e) == same(e, d)`, and transitivity holds).  I think that "`K` and `L` were created using the same arguments" should be interpreted as `K` and `L` being names assigned to the objects returned by `NumberField(d)` and `NumberField(e)` for some `d` and `e` for which `same(d, e)` is True.  I'm not sure if we have to assume any implication between `same(d, e)` and `d == e`; it is possible that `same(d, e)` is actually implemented as `d == e`.

Now consider the following boolean-valued statements about possible keys `d` and `e`:
1. `d is e`
2. `same(d, e)`
3. `NumberField(d) is NumberField(e)`
4. `NumberField(d) == NumberField(e)`
Clearly, the implications 1 => 2 and 3 => 4 are automatic, and 2 => 4 probably holds already.  It seems that saying "number fields are unique parents" is the same as saying that the implementation of `NumberField()` ensures that the implications 2 => 3 (hence 2 => 4) and 4 => 3 both hold, and maybe even 3 => 2.

If I understand correctly, this ticket makes sure that 2 => 3 holds, but not necessarily 4 => 3.  From that perspective it makes sense to have a separate ticket to implement the "other half" of the unique parents property.

If you want two fields generated from the same arguments to be identical, then you can either use `CachedRepresentation` or `UniqueFactory`.

If you additionally want unique parent behaviour (which means you cannot have two distinct instance of your class that evaluate equal), you can use `UniqueRepresentation`, or you can add `WithEqualityById` (it could be that I wrongly remember the name, but it is something similar to this) as a base class.

sage: K = NumberField(x^2 + 1); K
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
```
I don't like this; since the name is part of the defining data, I think we should insist on the user specifying the name.  If you think this should be changed, I think it is better to create a new ticket so this interface issue can be discussed separately from the technical changes made in this ticket.

Thanks.  I made a reviewer patch to fix some typos, formatting and Python 3 compatibility things; I changed the error message for `name=None` back to what it was to fix one failing doctest.
