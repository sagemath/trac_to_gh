<div id="comment:0"></div>

The import of *twisted.persisted.styles* takes a significant amount of time on sage startup:

```
$ time ./sage -startuptime|grep twisted.persisted.styles:
 twisted.persisted.styles: 0.093 (sage.all)

real    0m1.422s
```

Most functionality from that module seems not to be used in sage. The attached patch removes everything but the needed functionality:

```
$ time ./sage -startuptime|grep twisted.persisted.styles:

real    0m1.280s
```

Attachment: **[trac_11716_twisted_persisted_styles.proper.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11716/trac_11716_twisted_persisted_styles.proper.patch.gz)**

I've attached a `*.proper.patch`, which is identical except that I removed the "garbage" before "`# HG changeset patch`", i.e., I deleted the first line "`exporting patch:`", since Jeroen's current merger rejects such patches.

For now, please make sure all your patches start with "`# HG changeset patch`", i.e., have it on the first line without any preceding messages or whatever.

I've relaxed that in *my version* of the merger, but Jeroen and maybe others are likely to use his more restrictive one.
