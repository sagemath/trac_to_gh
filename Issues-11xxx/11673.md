sage: OK(13).is_unit() # should be false!
True

This does not seem to be limited to quadratic fields.

<a id='comment:2'></a>This is because order elements are a subclass of number field elements and hence inherit various generic methods from `sage.structure.element.FieldElement` that give total nonsense. E.g.

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 - x - 1)
sage: OK = K.ring_of_integers()
sage: OK(12).divides(OK(13))
True
sage: gcd(OK(12),OK(13))
1
sage: OK(12) // OK(13)
12/13
```

It's not clear to me what the right solution is here, given that we need `OrderElement` to inherit a great deal of its functionality from `NumberFieldElement`.
