Comparisons in the infinity ring are broken, mostly because it does not correctly coerce infinities from other rings into it. It also needs to be updated for the new coercion framework.

Also, `sage/rings/infinity.py` has no author or copyright notice.

Comparisons with SR or complex fields are still sometimes weird as 
* SR doesn't coerce to the infinity ring, since we want symbolic comparisons with infinity
* Complex numbers have phases, but the infinity ring only supports +/- 
* CC/CDF have a weird model for their own infinity representation:
These shall be dealt with elsewhere as they can't be fixed on the side of the infinity ring.

Depends on #13125

Some progress as of `5.7.beta3`:

```
sage: InfinityRing(RR(oo))
+Infinity
sage: InfinityRing(CC(oo))
+Infinity
sage: oo == RR(oo)
True
sage: float('inf') * unsigned_infinity
Infinity
sage: oo == CC(oo) # This is okay because we want an unsigned infinity
False
```

But still more to go:

```
sage: CC(oo) == unsigned_infinity # This is not
False
sage: CC(oo) * CC(oo) # Worse case, I think it should be "+infinty - 0*I" (consistent with python), best would be "+infinity"
+infinity - NaN*I
sage: InfinityRing(SR(oo))
TypeError: 
```
And some even more fun:

```
sage: oo*i - unsigned_infinity
Infinity
sage: oo*i + unsigned_infinity
Infinity
sage: oo*i   
(I)*Infinity
sage: oo*i + oo
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div id="comment:7" align="right">Comment 7</div>

The following is an extremely serious error:

```
sage: Infinity in RR
True
```
This is mathematical nonsense.

Less polemically phrased, it has the potential to be dangerously confusing.  It reflects the *implementation choice* that multiprecision reals are also able to represent infinity.

Besides, it contradicts the documentation of the infinity "ring", the parent of `Infinity`, which states that the infinity "ring" does not have a coercion map to any actual rings.

`Infinity in CC` does correctly return `False`.

> Besides, it contradicts the documentation of the infinity "ring", the parent of Infinity, which states that the infinity "ring" does not have a coercion map to any actual rings.

Let me argue for the same thing as you, but more precisely and technically based on the internal design decisions in Sage.

First note that there is no implicit coercion map from `InfinityRing` to RR, where coercion is as defined http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/tour_coercion.html. 

```
sage: RR.has_coerce_map_from(InfinityRing)
False
sage: InfinityRing.has_coerce_map_from(RR)
True
```

However, there is a *conversion* map:

```
sage: f = RR.convert_map_from(InfinityRing); f
Conversion map:
  From: The Infinity Ring
  To:   Real Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: f(oo)
+infinity
sage: oo.parent()
The Infinity Ring
```

Conversion (not coercion) paired with equality testing (see below) is what is used for "in" testing systematically throughout Sage.  For example, the following uses conversion:

```
sage: 2/1 in ZZ
True
```
The above would be false if it used only automatic coercion, since there is no automatic coercion from the rationals (parent of 2/1) to ZZ.    "In" works by applying the conversion map, then testing *equality* between the original object and the converted object, e.g., :

```
sage: ZZ(2/1) == 2/1
True
```
However, this equality test does use implicit coercion. 


In the case of "+infinity":

```
sage: RR(oo)     # fine
+infinity
sage: RR(oo) == oo  # that this is true is what is really wrong....
True
```

That `RR(oo) == oo` evaluates to True is the real bug, since == is supposed to mean *equal* under an implicit coercion map, e.g.:

```
sage: 2/1 == 2       # coerce both to QQ
True
sage: 2 == Mod(2,7)  # coerce both to Z/7Z
True
sage: 2/1 == Mod(2,7)      # FALSE!  As it should be -- no *implicit* coercion to a common parent, so they can't be equal
False
```

With CC things work right:  `CC(oo) != oo`:

```
sage: CC(oo)
+infinity
sage: f = CC.convert_map_from(InfinityRing); f
Conversion map:
  From: The Infinity Ring
  To:   Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: f(oo)
+infinity
sage: f(oo) == oo
False
sage: CC(oo) == oo  # good
False
```


> This is mathematical nonsense.

For the record, I'm a little uncomfortable with this way of arguing, since we're talking about numerical analysis and numerical computation here, in actual software, which is something that numerical analysts, IEEE committees, etc., have thought about these issues for a while.  They have very good reasons to represent various infinities as special cases, and have well defined rules about their behavior. 

Nonetheless, I have to agree with your conclusion.  I think the fix is to make it so `RR(oo) == oo` returns False.  When that is sorted out, then `oo in RR` should return False as well, as explained above.  One can *explicitly* construct `a = RR(oo)` if needed, and for this infinity, `a in RR` will be true.

<div id="comment:9" align="right">Comment 9</div>

Here is a more systematic list with things that work correctly and things that don't (compiled from earlier comments, with various additions).  We should probably have several tickets instead of trying to solve all problems at once.

Most basic operations in the signed and unsigned infinity rings work as expected:

```
sage: infinity.parent()
The Infinity Ring
sage: unsigned_infinity.parent()
The Unsigned Infinity Ring
sage: oo is infinity
True
sage: oo is Infinity
True
sage: infinity == unsigned_infinity
True
sage: -infinity == unsigned infinity
True
sage: infinity == -infinity
False
sage: oo * oo    
+Infinity
sage: oo * unsigned_infinity
Infinity
```
The coercion maps also work as expected:

```
sage: UnsignedInfinityRing.has_coerce_map_from(InfinityRing)
True
sage: InfinityRing.has_coerce_map_from(UnsignedInfinityRing)
False
sage: UnsignedInfinityRing.has_coerce_map_from(RR)
True
sage: UnsignedInfinityRing.has_coerce_map_from(CC)
True
sage: InfinityRing.has_coerce_map_from(RR)
True
sage: InfinityRing.has_coerce_map_from(CC)
False
sage: RR.has_coerce_map_from(UnsignedInfinityRing)
False
sage: CC.has_coerce_map_from(UnsignedInfinityRing)
False
sage: RR.has_coerce_map_from(InfinityRing)
False
sage: CC.has_coerce_map_from(InfinityRing)
False
```
The following is debatable, since it makes the arbitrary choice that unsigned infinity is "more positive than negative":

```
sage: InfinityRing(unsigned_infinity)
+Infinity  # this should probably raise an error
```
The following wrongly suggests that `UnsignedInfinityRing` is ordered:

```
sage: UnsignedInfinityRing(0)
A number less than infinity  # should be "A finite number"
```
A seemingly arbitrary typographical inconsistency (upper-case I vs. lower-case i):

```
sage: oo
+Infinity
sage: RR(oo)
+infinity
```
Conversion to `InfinityRing` and `UnsignedInfinityRing`:

```
sage: InfinityRing(RR(oo))
+Infinity  # OK
sage: InfinityRing(CC(oo))
+Infinity  # should raise an error (complex infinity is unsigned)
UnsignedInfinityRing(CC(oo))
A number less than infinity  # should be Infinity
UnsignedInfinityRing(CC(oo))
A number less than infinity  # should be Infinity
```
Arithmetic in `RR`:

```
sage: RR(5) * RR(oo)
+infinity  # OK
sage: RR(oo) * unsigned_infinity
...
ValueError: oo times number < oo not defined  # should be Infinity
```
`CC` currently contains many infinity elements, whereas it should contain at most one (the point at infinity in the Riemann sphere):

```
sage: RR(oo) * CC(oo)
+infinity - NaN*I  # should be "complex infinity"
sage: CC(5) * CC(oo)
+infinity - NaN*I  # should be "complex infinity"
```
Conversion from `InfinityRing` and `UnsignedInfinityRing`:

```
sage: RR(oo)
+infinity  # OK
sage: RR(unsigned_infinity)
+infinity  # should raise an error
sage: CC(oo)
+infinity  # should be "complex infinity"
sage: CC(unsigned_infinity)
+infinity  # should be "complex infinity

sage: f = RR.convert_map_from(InfinityRing); f
Conversion map:
  From: The Infinity Ring
  To:   Real Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: f(oo)
+infinity  # OK
sage: f(InfinityRing(0))
...
TypeError: Unable to convert x (='Zero') to real number.  # should be 0.000000000000000
sage: f(InfinityRing(1))
TypeError: Unable to convert x (='Apositivefinitenumber') to real number.  # OK
sage: f(InfinityRing(-1))
TypeError: Unable to convert x (='Anegativefinitenumber') to real number.  # OK

sage: f = CC.convert_map_from(InfinityRing); f
Conversion map:
  From: The Infinity Ring
  To:   Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: f(oo)
+infinity  # should be "complex infinity"
sage: f(InfinityRing(0))
TypeError: unable to coerce to a ComplexNumber: <class 'sage.rings.infinity.FiniteNumber'>  # should be 0.000000000000000
sage: f(InfinityRing(1))
TypeError: unable to coerce to a ComplexNumber: <class 'sage.rings.infinity.FiniteNumber'>  # OK
sage: f(InfinityRing(-1))
TypeError: unable to coerce to a ComplexNumber: <class 'sage.rings.infinity.FiniteNumber'>  # OK
```
Comparison:

```
sage: RR(oo) == oo
True   # might be OK; William Stein (comment:8) disagrees
sage: RR(oo) == unsigned_infinity
False  # True might be acceptable
sage: CC(oo) == oo
False  # OK
sage: CC(oo) == unsigned_infinity
False  # True might be acceptable
sage: CC(oo) == RR(oo)
True   # OK
```
Membership testing:

```
sage: Infinity in RR
True  # should be False
sage: Infinity in CC
False  # OK
sage: unsigned_infinity in RR
False  # OK
sage: unsigned_infinity in CC
False  # OK
```
Problems with the symbolic ring:

```
sage: InfinityRing(SR(oo))
...
TypeError:  # should be +Infinity
sage: oo*i   
(I)*Infinity  # should probably be Infinity
sage: oo*i + oo
...
RuntimeError: indeterminate expression: infinity - infinity encountered.  # OK
sage: bool(SR(oo) > 5)
False  # should be True
sage: oo*i - unsigned_infinity
Infinity  # OK
sage: oo*i + unsigned_infinity
Infinity  # OK
```

<div id="comment:19" align="right">Comment 19</div>

I mostly agree with the changes made; they fix some bugs and don't seem to introduce new weirdness.

I still don't believe that `Infinity in RR` is a good thing; I don't think the arguments for it are strong enough to justify what to me feels like a huge pain in the eye.  But it's not too directly related to the other points addressed in this ticket, so let's leave it at that for now.

Also, in my opinion, having one complex infinity for each argument is really just as arbitrary as the current situation of having complex infinities where the real and imaginary parts can each be a real number, or positive or negative infinity.  But this too is something for another time.

Now here is something that to me looks like a bug even if you believe that `RR` should contain `+Infinity` and `-Infinity`:

```
sage: unsigned_infinity in RR
True
```
This is because of the following two circumstances: `RR(unsigned_infinity)` is defined (as `RR(infinity)`, to be precise), and `RR(infinity) == unsigned_infinity` returns True.  I would prefer making `RR(unsigned_infinity)` raise an error, if this can be done without breaking too much.

And here is a strange inconsistency:

```
sage: unsigned_infinity - oo*i
...
ValueError: oo - oo not defined
sage: unsigned_infinity + oo*i
Infinity
```
I think this is best resolved by making the second example raise a `ValueError` like the first one; it seems to me that neither addition nor subtraction makes sense in the unsigned infinity "ring".

<div id="comment:20" align="right">Comment 20</div>

`unsigned_infinity in RR` returns true because there are coercions RR -> signed infinity ring -> unsigned infinity ring:

```
sage: get_coercion_model().explain(unsigned_infinity, RR(oo), operator.eq)
Coercion on right operand via
    Conversion map:
      From: Real Field with 53 bits of precision
      To:   The Unsigned Infinity Ring
Arithmetic performed after coercions.
Result lives in The Unsigned Infinity Ring
The Unsigned Infinity Ring
```
We could disallow the conversion RR(unsigned_infinity) but it would not change anything.

I agree with you that the infinity representation in CDF and CC sucks, but thats another ticket...

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A20):
> `unsigned_infinity in RR` returns true because there are coercions RR -> signed infinity ring -> unsigned infinity ring:

Yes, and I think that isn't a problem.
> We could disallow the conversion RR(unsigned_infinity) but it would not change anything.

Well, if I'm not mistaken, at least it would make `unsigned_infinity in RR` return False (because the conversion needs to succeed for this to return True), which was my point.

It seems my last point wasn't very clear, so here an equivalent example without complex infinities:

```
sage: unsigned_infinity + unsigned_infinity
Infinity
sage: unsigned_infinity - unsigned_infinity
...
ValueError: oo - oo not defined
```
I think we should raise an error for addition, i.e. make the code of `_add_()` work in an analogous way to that of `_sub_()`.  (Not that this was caused by your patch; the thing with the `+i` and `-i` just led me to this inconsistency.)

There is also a coercion RR -> RIF. IMHO there ought to be a pushout, and right now its the infinity ring. Arguably it should be a better structure that also knows about semi-infinite intervals. But until you write one we only have the infinity ring.

It is more coarse to certain extent; on the other hand `RIF` does not in general specify whether an element is positive, negative, zero, plus or minus infinity.

> There is also a coercion RR -> RIF. IMHO there ought to be a pushout, and right now its the infinity ring. Arguably it should be a better structure that also knows about semi-infinite intervals.

Indeed, something like a `InfinityIntervalRing` (although we may want a less silly name); its elements should be intervals in the ordered set

```
-infinity < -finite < 0 < +finite < +infinity
```
[Edit: we don't necessarily have to create a new structure, maybe we can just let the existing infinity ring have such intervals as elements and regard the existing elements as one-element intervals.]

Would there be anything against not trying to implement conversion `RIF` -> `InfinityRing` in this ticket at all (i.e. letting it raise an error like it does now), and fix comparison in a better way (and on a different ticket) by implementing this "infinity interval ring"?

Conversion from `RIF` to the current `InfinityRing` is already broken anyway, even when there are no infinities involved; do you convert the interval [-1, 1] into "a negative finite number", "zero", or "a positive finite number"?

`RIF` is definitely not a field (and neither are `RR` and `RDF`).  They are Sage objects that approximate the field **R** of real numbers in different ways, but none of these Sage objects satisfies the axioms of a field.

I don't understand this.  Addition of `+Infinity` and `-Infinity` is undefined in the infinity ring, or is this what you mean by "less structure"?

No, the operation `4 // 2` is defined in `ZZ`, but not after coercion to `Zmod(8)`, for example.

Since there is `oo` in `RIF`, I agree with you, it's actually not a field. Although I would say that if we remove `oo`, I would say it is a field. But this is a separate point, because the break is in the addition, not the multiplication. So would you say `RIF` is an additive abelian group?

I also found some strange behavior with `RIF`:

```
sage: oo in RIF
True
sage: RIF(oo)
[+infinity .. +infinity]
sage: RIF(oo) / RIF(oo)
[.. NaN ..]
sage: RIF(oo) / RIF(0)
[-infinity .. +infinity]
sage: RIF(oo) * RIF(0)
0
```

> I don't understand this.  Addition of `+Infinity` and `-Infinity` is undefined in the infinity ring, or is this what you mean by "less structure"?

Yes (another example would be the tropical semiring).

> No, the operation `4 // 2` is defined in `ZZ`, but not after coercion to `Zmod(8)`, for example.

In this case, division is not a part of the structure of `ZZ`, so perhaps I should amend my statement above to when you can *always* do operation `#` (i.e. it is guaranteed by the category). For `RIF`, subtraction is guaranteed to work.

As Volker pointed out, it isn't, even if we remove infinity.  And since it isn't an additive Abelian group, it certainly isn't a field either.  Moreover, the set of non-zero, non-infinite elements is not a group under multiplication.  For example, the interval [-1, 1] has neither an additive nor a multiplicative inverse.

I still don't get your point.  The tropical semiring is a semiring, while `InfinityRing` is not a semiring.

That depends on what you mean by "work":

```
sage: RIF(oo) - RIF(oo)
[.. NaN ..]
```
Maybe this should return `[-infinity .. +infinity]`, then it would cooperate nicely with the future support for "intervals in the infinity ring" (comments 29 and 30 above).

From my understanding, elements in RIF aren't intervals as sets, they are a single point that's guaranteed to be within in the interval. Thus if we fix a real element `x` in an interval, say `[-1, 1]`, then `x - x == 0` should be true (which I would say that it does not is currently a bug). However doing something like `RIF(-1,1) - RIF(-1, 1)` gets two (essentially) random numbers in the interval `[-1, 1]` and subtracts them and `RIF` tells us the result is guaranteed to lie in `[-2, 2]`.

Well...at least if we throw out the exact values of `+/-oo` and the `NaN`...(and it's essentially a field to the average user)

We also have this behavior with the current branch:

```
sage: InfinityRing(RIF(oo) - RIF(oo))
A positive finite number
sage: InfinityRing(float("NaN"))
A negative finite number
```
At least it maps this over. So to add to the question list, how do we handle this too? Keep it as is?

> I still don't get your point. The tropical semiring is a semiring, while InfinityRing is not a semiring.

Okay, I'm going to take a deep breath and try to make I'm not missing any cases or over simplifying things.

In `RIF` (with `[.. NaN ..]`), we have an additive abelian semigroup as we have an associative binary operation.

For `InfinityRing`, we have 5 elements: `[-oo, n, 0, p, oo]` where `n` and `p` are finite negative and positive numbers respectively. The following additions are defined (up to commutation):

```
-oo + [n, 0, p] -> -oo
n + [n, 0] -> n
p + [0, p] -> p
oo + [n, 0, p] -> oo
```
but none of the others (and multiplication is worse). So it doesn't have any fully defined binary operations on the entire set.

I didn't miss any cases, right? If so, then this is when I say "less structure".

<div id="comment:49" align="right">Comment 49</div>

However `cmp` is for totally ordered sets and `RIF` is not, so I don't trust it here (plus it's deprecated in python3):

```
sage: P = Poset([['a', 'b'], []], facade=False)
sage: a = P('a')
sage: b = P('b')
sage: a < b
False
sage: b < a
False
sage: a > b
False
sage: b > a
False
sage: cmp(a, b)
0
sage: a == b
False
```
So what's happening is in `cmp(a, b)`, because neither `a` is less/greater than `b` nor vice versa, it's saying they must be equal (because it is supposed to be a totally ordered set).

I'd be okay with a big warning in the doc and a printed warning when coercing (semi)infinity intervals into the infinity ring.

<div id="comment:58" align="right">Comment 58</div>

I am a bit late to comment on this, but let me add my 2 cents about what `infinity in RR` should return and related questions.
The way I understand it:
* `RR` essentially is an interface to MPFR. It is not, has never been and cannot be the right model for the field of real numbers in sage.
* `RIF` being based on MPFI, its elements are sets. As a general 
  rule, operations on these elements are required to return 
  over-approximations of the image of their operands, period. Note that this 
  could apply to boolean predicates: in an ideal world, `[1,3] = [2,4]` would 
  return something like `{True, False}`. But some compromises are necessary, in 
  part because sage keeps abusing Python's equality and comparison operators 
  instead of defining its own "mathematical" equality.
So I think the problems raised by Peter and Travis are mostly due to 
unfortunate name choices and cannot be solved without 
breaking lots of existing code. The best plan I can come up with would be 
something like this:
* Deprecate `RR`, `Reals()`, and `RealField()` (`Reals(p)`, `RealField(p)` can probably stay). Replace `RR` by `RFP`.
* Make it clear in the documentation that these parents represent sets of floating-point numbers—particular subsets of the dyadic rationals, augmented with special values such as ±∞ and equipped with well-defined, if peculiar, operations—, not the field of real numbers.
* While we're at it, deprecate `RIF` and `RealIntervalField`. Rename them to something like `IR` (a common notation in interval analysis) and `RealFloatingPointIntervals`.
* Stop pretending any of these are fields (or even semigroups). Perhaps introduce a category of "approximate fields" (for lack of a better name).
* After the deprecation period, consider making `RR` and `Reals` refer to/return `RLF` (or perhaps some new implementation that better models the "true" reals).
* Idem for `CC`, `CIF` etc.
