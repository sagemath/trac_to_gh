Patch under development on the Sage-Combinat queue:

http://combinat.sagemath.org/patches/file/tip/trac_11109-stable-grothendieck-polynomials-nt.patch

The current implementation currently gives incorrect results, due to a missuse of the Pieri factors. It will be fixed by adding another feature there.
