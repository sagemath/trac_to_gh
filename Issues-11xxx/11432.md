The function Q.lll() where Q is a QuadraticForm is a one-line wrapper around LLL_gram(), which in turn calls Pari.

The description of Q.lll() is that it returns an LLL-reduced quadratic form. However, the function LLL_gram() returns a change of basis matrix, not the resulting quadratic form.

In my opinion this requires a one-line patch, which I can do if someone confirms that this is the problem.

I was wrong. When (3 years ago!) I opened the ticket, I failed to realize that one can evaluate a quadratic form on a matrix, and indeed this is what the lll() (rightly) does. I am closing the ticket.
