```
Consider the following (Sage 4.7alpha1) :

```
sage: P.<a> = QQ[]
sage: P.ideal([])
Booom!
```

The issue is twofold: The ideal method in rings/rings.py is called and does not accept an empty list. But also the univariate polynomial rings should call a specialized method just like the multivariate ones do.

It worked in earlier versions (like 4.2 or so) and is a construction that easily comes up as a corner case.

I'm happy with this.  Here's a new patch with a few doctests illustrating that the problem has been fixed.

I'm going to mark this as "needs review"; it wouldn't hurt to have someone else look it over.

```
R.<x> = QQ[]
R.ideal((x for _ in range(2)))

Any experience with similar code at other places in Sage?
