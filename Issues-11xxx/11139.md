Consider the following (Sage 4.7alpha1) :

```
sage: P.<a> = QQ[]
sage: P.ideal([])
Booom!
```

The issue is twofold: The ideal method in rings/rings.py is called and does not accept an empty list. But also the univariate polynomial rings should call a specialized method just like the multivariate ones do.

It worked in earlier versions (like 4.2 or so) and is a construction that easily comes up as a corner case.

I'm happy with this.  Here's a new patch with a few doctests illustrating that the problem has been fixed.

I'm going to mark this as "needs review"; it wouldn't hurt to have someone else look it over.

I think that indeed the logic is much better. Though it might be confusing to beginners. But this improvement brings my attention to a problem, that has been there before:

```
R.<x> = QQ[]
R.ideal((x for _ in range(2)))
```

This is an instance of GeneratorType, that is called with len.  So either we exclude the GeneratorType (no change to the situtation before) or correct it.  Also, mind that a ring element might be an instance of GeneratorType.  In that (very exceptional) situation, the new logic would cause trouble.

Any experience with similar code at other places in Sage?
