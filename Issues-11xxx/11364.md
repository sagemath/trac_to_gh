This has been lying around on trac for a while; thought I could review it.

The code looks excellent and all tests pass. There seems to be a sufficient number of doctests. It was also a good decision to split the implementation into a "hidden" function `_cyclic_subspace` and the user-facing function `cyclic_subspace` with a friendlier interface.

The only remark I have is that I think that coercions could be handled a little better. For example, a call to `cyclic_subspace` now fails on matrices with integer coefficients, even though there exists a coercion ZZ to QQ. I patched it to try calling R.fraction_field(). 

I also moved the `generator = False` outside of the try block, because it is intended as a default value in case anything inside the try block fails.

If you agree with my changes, then by all means, mark this as a positive review.

Dear Timo,

Thank-you very much for looking at this.  Yes, it is old, so I am surprised it has not bit-rotted in some way.

I will be offline for the next two weeks as part of the semester break here, so I'll have to take a close look later.  But the changes in your patch certainly look like good improvements.  I'll be back in a bit.

Thanks,
Rob

Dear Timo,

Sorry to be so very long on this one - life got crazy there for a while.  Your changes look very good to me.  Thanks for the review and the great improvements.

As suggested above, I'll mark this "positive review" and we can finally get it in.

Looks like a `TypeError` is the only possibility for the naked try.  Thanks for catching that, Jeroen.

I made the change on the reviewer patch, which still has Timo's name on it (now named v2).  I updated the summary line in the patch, since Trac numbers get prepended automatically now.

Timo - can you bless the changes?

Rob
