We're missing some conversions from Maxima.  Like exponential integrals of various kinds.

```
sage: f(x) = e^(-x) * log(x+1)
sage: uu = integral(f,x,0,oo)
sage: uu
x |--> e*expintegral_e(1, 1)
```
See [this ask.sagemath post](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/488/calculating-integral) for some details.

# Summary of missing conversions

## Special functions defined in Maxima
(http://maxima.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/en/maxima_16.html#SEC56)

```
bessel_j (index, expr)         Bessel function, 1st kind
bessel_y (index, expr)         Bessel function, 2nd kind
bessel_i (index, expr)         Modified Bessel function, 1st kind
bessel_k (index, expr)         Modified Bessel function, 2nd kind
```

* Notes: bessel_I, bessel_J, etc. are functions in Sage for numerical evaluation. There is also the `Bessel` class, but no conversions from Maxima's bessel_i etc. to Sage.

```
hankel_1 (v,z)                 Hankel function of the 1st kind
hankel_2 (v,z)                 Hankel function of the 2nd kind
struve_h (v,z)                 Struve H function
struve_l (v,z)                 Struve L function
```

* Notes: None of these functions are currently exposed at the top level in Sage. Evaluation is possible using mpmath.

```
assoc_legendre_p[v,u] (z)      Legendre function of degree v and order u 
assoc_legendre_q[v,u] (z)      Legendre function, 2nd kind
```

* Notes: In Sage we have `legendre_P(n, x)` and `legendre_Q(n, x)` both described as Legendre functions. It's not clear to me how there are related to Maxima's versions since the number of arguments differs.

```
%f[p,q] ([], [], expr)         Generalized Hypergeometric function
hypergeometric(l1, l2, z)      Hypergeometric function
slommel
%m[u,k] (z)                    Whittaker function, 1st kind
%w[u,k] (z)                    Whittaker function, 2nd kind
```

* Notes: `hypergeometric(l1, l2, z)` needs a conversion to Sage's `hypergeometric_U`. The others can be evaluated using mpmath. `slommel` is presumably mpmath's `lommels1()` or `lommels2()` (or both?). This isn't well documented in Maxima.

```
expintegral_e (v,z)            Exponential integral E
expintegral_e1 (z)             Exponential integral E1
expintegral_ei (z)             Exponential integral Ei
expintegral_li (z)             Logarithmic integral Li
expintegral_si (z)             Exponential integral Si
expintegral_ci (z)             Exponential integral Ci
expintegral_shi (z)            Exponential integral Shi
expintegral_chi (z)            Exponential integral Chi
erfc (z)                       Complement of the erf function
```

* Notes: The exponential integral functions `expintegral_e1` and `expintegral_ei (z)` are called `exponential_integral_1` and `Ei` resp. in Sage. They both need conversions. The rest need `BuiltinFunction` classes defined for them with evaluation handled by mpmath and the symbol table conversion added. Also, `erfc` is called `error_fcn`, so also needs a conversion.

```
kelliptic (z)                  Complete elliptic integral of the first 
                               kind (K)
parabolic_cylinder_d (v,z)     Parabolic cylinder D function
```

* Notes: `kelliptic(z)` needs a conversion to `elliptic_kc` in Sage and `parabolic_cylinder_d (v,z)` does not seem to be exposed at top level. It can be evaluated by mpmath.

As far as I can tell, the general `exponential_e` function isn't available directly in Sage or in PARI (which is used to evaluate the `exponential_integral_1` function in Sage). 

Also, it's possible to get maxima to rewrite the exponential integrals in terms of gamma functions like so: 

```python
sage: maxima.eval('expintrep:gamma_incomplete')
'gamma_incomplete'
sage: maxima.integrate(exp(-x)*log(x+1), x, 0, oo)
%e*gamma_incomplete(0,1)
sage: N(e*gamma(0,1), digits=18)
0.596347362323194074
```

But as you see, `gamma_incomplete` isn't defined in Sage either, but the table `sage.symbolic.pynac.symbol_table['maxima']` lists the Sage equivalent `gamma`. Anyway, it should be possible to have the maxima interface (with the help of maxima itself) rewrite any exponential integral that Sage doesn't have in terms of gamma functions. 

By the way, the owner on the ticket is @burcin, does that mean they are working on it currently?

Interesting.

That should be ok; the whole point of the table is to convert into the Sage equivalent.

No, that is an automatic thing that happens.  It is possible to be designated an 'owner' of a ticket in a given component, which basically means you automatically get updates.  If you want to 'own' it, please do!  We really have plenty of special functions in Sage, but they are not always well exposed at the top level.

Incidentally, once you comment on a ticket, I believe the default is to copy you in on all replies.  So you didn't have to cc: yourself specially :)

Incomplete gamma is defined in Sage. You can access it directly though `incomplete_gamma()` or `gamma_inc()`. The top level function `gamma()` behaves like incomplete gamma if you give it two arguments. IIRC, this is similar to maple.

I am not working on it. The ticket status `assigned` is supposed to indicate that the owner is working on the problem, but we don't use that much either.

I guess the point of this ticket is to define symbolic function in Sage to represent exponential integrals, etc. The symbolic function class handles adding stuff to the conversion table automatically.

Can we replace this ticket with several beginner tickets? One for each function we are missing.

It's not clear to me why some functions are Ginac and some are Builtin.

Questions: 

* For the purposes of this ticket, what is recommended? @kcrisman 's comment leads me to believe that inheriting from the `BuiltinFunction` class and using `mpmath` for evaluation is preferable.

Those are good questions.  

I think the most important thing is to make sure that whatever is implemented has

* good numerical evaluation (perhaps via mpmath)
* translates back and forth to Maxima properly (for integration and limits)

My sense is that BuiltinFunction would be best.  GinacFunction probably is only good for things that in fact evaluate in Ginac.  This explains trig.py.  [This Ginac page](http://www.ginac.de/tutorial/Built_002din-functions.html) shows that the ones which are GinacFunctions are exactly the ones which Ginac in fact has.      I don't think it has most of these other functions.

As for MaximaFunction, it seems to inherit from BuiltinFunction and lives in the special functions file.  This dates from the days when Sage had very few options for symbolic stuff and evaluation, and so it just does a few extra things.  If we moved to mpmath for a given function, we would probably use BuiltinFunction and then add evaluation options for Maxima and add to the conversion dictionary as needed.  

In fact, it wouldn't be a bad idea to have two different eval procedures if possible...

As for where such things go, probably it would make sense to separate a lot of these special functions out into a separate file.  The distinction between transcendental and special is not totally obvious, for instance :)

By the way, we certainly want fewer of the wrapper functions!  But that will take a lot of tedious work.

I've uploaded a first shot at a template for the functions we want to add in this ticket. The patch exposes the general complex exponential integral function `En` also called `Function_exp_integral_En` by adding a class to `sage/functions/special.py` (I can change where it goes later on if needed / desired). Numerical evaluation is handled by mpmath and symbolics are handled by Sage (e.g. the derivative) and Maxima (e.g. the antiderivative).

One of the docstring examples shows that the integral of `e^(-x) * log(x+1)` from the ticket description is now evaluated properly. 

Any comments or suggestions?

The tests similar to `if z == 0` in `_eval_` do make a big difference. I guess this is well known, but I didn't realize how big the speed difference is. 

I made a little table below of some timings. In the first table , `_eval_` includes tests `if z == 0 and n > 1` and `if n == 0`. In the second table, there are no such if statements (so the special cases are not implemented). In the third table, the special cases are implementes as in `sage/functions/generalized.py` where an approximation of `z` (or `n`) is produced and checked instead of the symbol.

```rst
with ``if z == 0``

=============================================	========
  Test											 Time
=============================================	========
sage: timeit("f = exp_integral_e(n,z)")			 1.44 ms
sage: timeit("f = exp_integral_e(n,0)")			 929 µs
sage: timeit("f = exp_integral_e(0,z)")			 1.41 ms
sage: timeit("f = exp_integral_e(1.0,1.0)")		 158 µs
=============================================	========

without ``if z == 0``

=============================================	======
  Test											 Time
=============================================	======
sage: timeit("f = exp_integral_e(n,z)")			541 µs
sage: timeit("f = exp_integral_e(n,0)")			300 µs
sage: timeit("f = exp_integral_e(0,z)")			299 µs
sage: timeit("f = exp_integral_e(1.0,1.0)")		161 µs
=============================================	======

with:

.. code-block:: python

	try:
	    approx_z = ComplexIntervalField()(z)
	    # if z is zero and n > 1
	    if bool(approx_z.imag() == 0) and bool(approx_z.real() == 0):
	        if n > 1:
	            return 1/(n-1)
	except: # z is symbolic
	    pass
	# if n is zero
	try:
	    approx_n = ComplexIntervalField()(n)
	    if bool(approx_n.imag() == 0) and bool(approx_n.real() == 0):
	        return exp(-z)/z
	except: # n is symbolic
	    pass

=============================================	======
  Test											 Time
=============================================	======
sage: timeit("f = exp_integral_e(n,z)")			570 µs
sage: timeit("f = exp_integral_e(n,0)")			576 µs
sage: timeit("f = exp_integral_e(0,z)")			1.05 ms
sage: timeit("f = exp_integral_e(1.0,1.0)")		160 µs
=============================================	======
```

Timings in tables 2 and 3 are close except in the case where ``exp(-z)/z`` is
returned, whereas table 1 is anywhere from a factor of 3 to 5 slower than in table 2 when a symbolic argument is passed. Anyway, I thought I'd include the above for other beginners such as myself.

---

Another thing I discovered is that these two special cases that I was
implementing are known to Maxima:

```
sage: f = exp_integral_e(0,x)
sage: f
exp_integral_e(0,x)
sage: f.simplify()
e^(-x)/x

sage: nn = var('nn')
sage: assume(nn > 1)
sage: f = exp_integral_e(nn, 0)
sage: f
exp_integral_e(nn, 0)
sage: f.simplify()
1/(nn - 1)
```
	
So I think in the interest of speedy evaluation it's best to leave the special
cases out, but point out in the documentation that Maxima knows about them.

I've uploaded a new patch. I'll start implementing the other exponential integrals using this as a template.

I think your timings show that using the CIF approximation is not such a big penalty. Note that your timings also reflect the construction of the result and not just including that change. It is better if Sage can do the evaluation automatically without having to pass through a `simplify()` call. I'd like them in, with the approximation approach.

Since this approximation is being called so often, we should make it a method of symbolic expressions. I opened a new ticket for this: #11513. This ticket should depend on that.

I will provide a preliminary patch for #11513 soon.

======================================================  =======
  Test                                                   Time
======================================================  =======
sage: timeit("f = exp_integral_e(n,z)")                 535 µs
sage: timeit("f = exp_integral_e(n,0)")                 482 µs
sage: assume(n > 1); timeit("f = exp_integral_e(n,0)")  3.56 ms
sage: timeit("f = exp_integral_e(0,z)")                 968 µs
sage: timeit("f = exp_integral_e(1.0,1.0)")             160 µs
======================================================  =======
```

I realized that in row 2 of the previous timings I neglected to assume n > 1 so those timings aren't giving much information since the expression is left unevaluated like in row 1. The new row 3 includes that assumption so that the simplified result ``1/(n-1)`` is created and returned. 

I'll update the timings above and move these tables to the wiki.

Trying to finish up the patch, I've run into a problem evaluating any of my new functions at python floats. For example, apply the patch and try:

```
sage: exp_integral_e1(float(1))

The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (690, 0))

```

You also get the error if you try to plot any of the exponential integral functions as they are written unless you wrap the input with `RDF` or something similar.

The error is being raised inside the `call` function in `sage/libs/mpmath/util.pyx`. I've looked through that code and thought about what would happen if the `prec` option is not specified (as in my code) and the parent is `None` (as when a python float is passed), but I can't figure out why it doesn't work to pass a float.

On the other hand, changing the lines in the `_evalf` method

```
import mpmath
return mpmath_utils.call(mpmath.e1, z, parent=parent)
```

to 

```
import mpmath
if isinstance(parent, Parent) and hasattr(parent, 'prec'):
    prec = parent.prec()
else:
    prec = 53
return mpmath_utils.call(mpmath.si, z, prec=prec)
```

fixes the error. 

What do people think? Is this a bug in the `call` function (which claims it will accept any type that mpmath handles natively like python floats) or is there something wrong with my code?

I've changed the names of the functions in the new module `sage/functions/exp_integral.py` according to my proposal in comment [comment:36] and added top-level aliases `li, si, ci, shi, chi`.

This came up while preparing for a Sage talk today - I tried 

```
sage: integrate(log(x-1)*e^x,x)
e*expintegral_e(1, -x + 1) + e^x*log(x - 1)
```
and of course it doesn't LaTeX very nicely.  

I'll try to look at this soon.  I already know that we would need to make `si` into `Si`, etc., because that *is* the standard notation (first letter capitalized, see all the references above), but I can make a reviewer patch which does this.  But it sounds like this should be finally ready to go.  Sorry for the long process here!

Hi guys. I don't know if this even applies, because I discovered this behaviour on version 4.8, with the patch applied (And it seems to apply to limit rather than anything else.)
However, if I enter the following code:

```
def fracintegral(func,n, xsub=x,a=0):
    t = var('t')
    assume(t > a)
    assume(x > a)
    return integrate(((x-t)^(n-1))*func(t),t,a,x)/gamma(n)
a = fracintegral(sin(x),1/2);a
```

I get the following returned:

```
-1/2*(sqrt(x)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*x) +
sqrt(x)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*x) +
I*sqrt(x)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*x) -
I*sqrt(x)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*x) -
2*limit(1/2*sqrt(-t)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*t) +
1/2*sqrt(-t)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*t) -
1/2*I*sqrt(-t)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*t) +
1/2*I*sqrt(-t)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*t), t, 0, minus))/sqrt(pi)
```

If I copy/paste this into a new sage notebook cell, I get the following error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):    1/2*I*sqrt(-t)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*t) +
  File "", line 1, in <module>
    
  File "/tmp/tmpbIxhPU/___code___.py", line 10, in <module>

NameError: name 'minus' is not defined
```

If I fix up the minus by doing this,

```
-1/2*(sqrt(x)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*x) +
sqrt(x)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*x) +
I*sqrt(x)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*x) -
I*sqrt(x)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*x) -
2*limit(1/2*sqrt(-t)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*t) +
1/2*sqrt(-t)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*t) -
1/2*I*sqrt(-t)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*t) +
1/2*I*sqrt(-t)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*t), t, 0, 'minus'))/sqrt(pi)
```

I get this error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):    1/2*I*sqrt(-t)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*t) +
  File "", line 1, in <module>
    
  File "/tmp/tmpI2jAGB/___code___.py", line 10, in <module>
    _sage_const_1 /_sage_const_2 *I*sqrt(-t)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(_sage_const_1 /_sage_const_2 , I*t), t, _sage_const_0 , 'minus'))/sqrt(pi)
  File "/home/joal/bin/sage-4.8-linux-64bit-ubuntu_10.04.3_lts-x86_64-Linux/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/calculus/calculus.py", line 1131, in limit
    raise ValueError, "call the limit function like this, e.g. limit(expr, x=2)."
ValueError: call the limit function like this, e.g. limit(expr, x=2).
```

Then if I write it up in correct limit syntax like so:

```
b = 2*limit(1/2*sqrt(-t)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*t) +
1/2*sqrt(-t)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*t) -
1/2*I*sqrt(-t)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*t) +
1/2*I*sqrt(-t)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*t), t=0, dir='minus'); b
```

I get literally nothing from the notebook cell. If I then enter b and evaluate in the next cell I get this:

```
2*limit(1/2*I*sqrt(t)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*t) +
1/2*I*sqrt(t)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*t) +
1/2*sqrt(t)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*t) -
1/2*sqrt(t)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*t), t, 0, minus)
```


This is all with Pretty Printing turned off. If I turn on Pretty Printing, then the reply from the fracintegral call (on trig functions and exponents) is this:

while looking in the sources for the old name `expintegral_e` I found the following
instance:

```
sage: search_src("expintegral_e")
functions/exp_integral.py:393:        x*log_integral(x) - expintegral_ei(2*log(x))

That should be fixed too.

Looks good!  A few quirks I've noticed:

(1) li behaves a little differently with respect to autoevaluation at 0:

```
sage: Si(0)
0
sage: Shi(0)
0
sage: li(0)
log_integral(0)
sage: li(0).simplify()
0
sage: li(0).n()
0.000000000000000
```

(2) In the (probably semi-deprecated; it works with Python floats) exponential_integral_1, we should special-case 0:

```
sage: exp_integral_e1(0.01)
4.03792957653811
sage: exponential_integral_1(0.01)
4.037929576538114
sage: exp_integral_e1(0)
exp_integral_e1(0)
sage: exp_integral_e1(0).n()
+infinity
sage: exponential_integral_1(0)

(3) There's something going on with integration I don't understand:

```

sage: integrate(sinh_integral(x), x)
x*sinh_integral(x) - cosh(x)
sage: integrate(sinh_integral(x), x, 0, 1/2)
-cosh(1/2) + 1/2*sinh_integral(1/2) + 1

sage: 
sage: integrate(sinh_integral(x), x, 0.0, 0.5)
0.125872409703 + 1.57079632679*I

```

IOW, somehow we pick up a pi/2 I, and it probably happens on our side:

```

In [7]: quad(lambda x: shi(x), [0, 0.5])
Out[7]: mpf('0.12587240970345281')

```

Thanks, kcrisman.  Since after real-world discussions it appears that the integration difficulty is another Maxima quirk, I don't think we should hold up approving this, especially because it can be worked around.  I do think it's worth warning the user, and the example will serve as a reminder to us that it can be removed when we update to a version of Maxima which finally fixes it, 'cause the doctest will fail.

So I propose adding the following to EXAMPLES for sinh_integral:

```

    Note that due to some problems with the way Maxima handles these
    expressions, definite integrals can sometimes give unexpected
    results (typically when using inexact endpoints) due to
    inconsistent branching::

        sage: integrate(sinh_integral(x), x, 0, 1/2)
        -cosh(1/2) + 1/2*sinh_integral(1/2) + 1

I don't like this.

```
sage: li(0)
0
sage: type(li(0))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: Si(0)
0
sage: type(Si(0))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```
The reason is 

```
        # special case: z = 0 
	        if isinstance(z, Expression): 
	            if z.is_trivial_zero(): 
	                return z 
	        else: 
	            if not z: 
	                return z 
```
type code, because of course the zero `z` we input is not an expression, but is `not z`, so we return the **Integer** zero instead of the **symbolic** zero.

Of course, we're inconsistent here:

```
sage: sin(0)
0
sage: type(sin(0))
<type 'int'>
```
Oops.  But under the philosophy of

```
sage: f(x) = x^2
sage: f(0)
0
sage: type(f(0))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```
I think we should return an `Expression`.

With the patches applied to 5.0, my fractional integral code works on sine functions, but I still get the following error if pretty printing is on. Is there a trac post for this?

```
def fracintegral(func,xsub,n,a=0):
    t = var('t')
    assume(t > a)
    assume(x > a)
    return integrate((x-t)^(n-1)*func.subs({xsub:t}),t,a,x)/gamma(n)
a = fracintegral(sin(x),x,1/2)
a

```
Returns this on the call to a (but not on the assignment of a =):

Incidentally, this is apparently now fixed.  Is this something we should test for (not in this ticket) as well, since we use mpmath for it?  I really hate how there is no link on the Maxima bugtracker as to the actual change in the code.  Makes it harder for new folks to jump in.

Keep in mind this is a Maxima output, not one we currently can even easily access without using Maxima, since this ticket uses mpmath to evaluate these functions, and we don't (yet) have different algorithm parameters for all these special functions.
