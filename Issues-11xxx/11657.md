I was shocked by this:

```

sage: timeit('vector(ZZ,100)')
625 loops, best of 3: 302 µs per loop
sage: timeit('(ZZ^100)(0)')
625 loops, best of 3: 24.9 µs per loop
sage: timeit('(ZZ^100).zero_vector()')
625 loops, best of 3: 21.8 µs per loop
```

I didn't realize that the special case of the zero vector is incredibly slow for the `vector` function.  This needs to be fixed.

<a id='comment:1'></a>The vector constructor has to do a fair amount of checking to accomodate all of its flexibility.  There is a numpy type check that could probably go away due to a subsequent call to Sequence() in prepare(), though it does not appear this is the problem (verbose() says 0.0 seconds, is it granular enough?).

I think this Sequence call is used to find a common parent for the types of the entries.  However, it is about 1/3 of the time.

```
sage: timeit('vector(ZZ,100)')
625 loops, best of 3: 231 µs per loop
sage: timeit('(ZZ^100).zero_vector()')
625 loops, best of 3: 11.2 µs per loop
sage: timeit("Sequence(v)")
625 loops, best of 3: 69.5 µs per loop
```

It would be possible to have the routine return the zero vector sooner, since there is no type checking involved.  With a crude fix that passes all tests in sage/matrix, sage/modules, there is an improvement, but still slower.

```
sage: sage: timeit('vector(ZZ,100)')
625 loops, best of 3: 43.9 µs per loop
```

Trouble is we need to support two-argument calls like

```
vector(range(5), ZZ)
```

and so need to do *some* type-checking on the arguments, though maybe it could be reduced slightly.

Patch generally improves speed of conveniences (constructors) for creating zero vectors.  Fastest route seems to usually be the `.zero_vector()` method of a module, which just barely beats coercing a zero scalar into the module most of the time.

The `zero_vector()` *constructor function* now uses the `.zero_vector()` *method*, and the `vector()` method short-circuits to return a zero vector just as soon as possible.  The multi-format capabilities of the `vector()` constructor require some necessary overhead, which seems to be a constant 30 micro-seconds on my machine.

Additions to documentation provide advice for the truly speed-hungry.

Yes, I've got it.  Looks good and *nearly* optimal.  Nothing much to add in the way of performance.

Comments:

Line 127 - typo in comments  "slowedue"

Line 447 - return statement with zero vector should now be dead code - at least we want it to be.  Commenting-it out and running tests confirms.  The comment preceding needs adjustment.

Line 665 - is the whole discussion about "or" now moot with the super-fast ``is_Ring()`` defined earlier?

Line 670 - error message: can we say  "first argument must be a ring" rather than "arg0 must be a ring"?

Reactions?  I can make a follow-up patch for you to review, or vice-versa?

"edits" patch addresses all four comments above.  Needs review.

Combination of two patches passes all tests.  Timings are now very similar for all four ways to get a zero vector - within about 3 microseconds difference in overhead.
