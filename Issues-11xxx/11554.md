The problem really is that Sage only supports the zero ideal and fractional ideals of number fields.  Sage simply does not know about the ideal `(1)` in a number field.

So proposing to close this as "wontfix".

Huh?  Obviously, the denominator ideal of 0 should be the unit ideal, just at the denominator if 0 is 1:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 1)
sage: K(0).denominator()
1
```

The statement "Sage only supports the zero ideal and fractional ideals of number fields. Sage simply does not know about the ideal (1) in a number field." sounds like nonsense to me.   The ideal generated by 1 is a perfectly good fractional ideal.  That's why people say "the *group* of fractional ideals" -- groups have an identity element. 

```
sage: K.maximal_order().ideal(1)
Fractional ideal (1)
```

What I believe Jeroen meant here is not the OK-submodule OK of K, but the K-submodule K of K -- the unit ideal of K in the purely ring-theoretic sense. This is indeed an object Sage genuinely doesn't know about -- we special-case the zero ideal, but not the whole-of-K ideal.

This is just FYI; I'm not trying to dispute your decision to give the patch a positive review. Frankly I'm not convinced that the denominator of 0 is worth losing much sleep over.

Please **DO NOT** reopen tickets!

If you disagree with me closing the ticket, that's fine, just state it in the comments.

But **DO NOT** reopen tickets!

You can totally disagree with me about closing a ticket.  I am a reasonable person and will very likely listen.  But it's very annoying if my idea of which tickets are open/closed does not correspond to reality.

Hello,

In response to Jeroen's comment, I opened a new ticket -- [https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/12046](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/12046) -- with a proposed change to the numerator_ideal function. Sorry if it's confusing having two tickets dealing with a similar issue.
