You can totally disagree with me about closing a ticket.  I am a reasonable person and will very likely listen.  But it's very annoying if my idea of which tickets are open/closed does not correspond to reality.

This is what I meant, yes.  But it is indeed mostly matter of definition.

I don't understand why the patch changes the documentation of the function.  I think the old documentation is more clear and I think it also justifies better the choice that the numerator of (0) is the fractional ideal (1).

However, if you want to define the `denominator_ideal` of zero to be the fractional ideal (1), then certainly the `numerator_ideal` of zero should be (0).  So this still needs work.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Hello,

In response to Jeroen's comment, I opened a new ticket -- [http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12046](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12046) -- with a proposed change to the numerator_ideal function. Sorry if it's confusing having two tickets dealing with a similar issue.
