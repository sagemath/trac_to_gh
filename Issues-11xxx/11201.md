Many users of of the solve() function complain that Sage can't solve some simple equations, when in fact it can if the `to_poly_solve=True` option is passed. See, for example:

[http://ask.sagemath.org/question/506/solving-complex-equation](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/506/solving-complex-equation)

```
sage: z = var('z')
sage: solve(sin(z) + cos(z) == 2, z)
[sin(z) == -cos(z) + 2]
```

I propose that when Maxima returns an implicit solution, solve() should display an informative message to the user about the existence of the `to_poly_solve` parameter.

it gives the user a clue when explicit results are not found. Specifically, it points the user to the to_poly_solve option, per benjaminfjones's request. I don't know if this should be included, as it gets monotonous to see the message over and over again very quickly.

I started looking at the patch and I have a couple of comments. First, I tried running doctests on `sage/symbolic/expression.pyx` and there are a lot of new failures due to the unexpected info message that's been added. For example,

```

    [(a, 1), (-I, 1), (I, 1), (1, 3), (-1, 3)]
```

There might be other doctest failures besides ones related to the new message, I don't have time to look through them all right now.

I'm still not sure what exactly setting `to_poly_solve='use_grobner=true'` does. Consider the following Sage-5.0.beta12 session (with your patch applied):

Here is what Maxima (5.26.0) does:

```
sage: maxima('load(to_poly_solver)')
"/Users/jonesbe/sage/sage-5.0.beta12/local/share/maxima/5.26.0/share/contrib/to_poly_solver.mac"
sage: maxima('to_poly_solve([x^2+y^2=2^2,(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2=2^2],[x,y]);')
%union()
sage: maxima('to_poly_solve([x^2+y^2=2^2,(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2=2^2],[x,y],use_grobner=true);')
%union([x=-(sqrt(7)-1)/2,y=(sqrt(7)+1)/2],[x=(sqrt(7)+1)/2,y=-(sqrt(7)-1)/2])
```

Here is what Sage does (same system of equations, same options):

```
sage: solve(x == sqrt(x+1), x)
For explicit results, try setting the 'to_poly_solve' keyword to True.
[x == sqrt(x + 1)]
sage: solve(x == sqrt(x+1), x, to_poly_solve=True)
For explicit results, try setting the 'to_poly_solve' keyword to True.
[x == 1/2*sqrt(5) + 1/2]
sage: solve(x == sqrt(x+1), x, to_poly_solve='use_grobner=true')
For explicit results, try setting the 'to_poly_solve' keyword to True.
[x == 1/2*sqrt(5) + 1/2]
```

So it seems like `use_grobner` has no effect, despite it having an effect in Maxima. Is it always set to true when `to_poly_solve=True` is specified? If so, we should really get rid of this confusing solve option. If there is a good example where it actually has an effect, that should be added to the EXAMPLES:: section in the solve docs. The example illustrating it right now doesn't change if you set `to_poly_solve=True` instead of `to_poly_solve='use_grobner=true'`:

```
sage: solve(x == sqrt(x+1), x)
For explicit results, try setting the 'to_poly_solve' keyword to True.
[x == sqrt(x + 1)]
sage: solve(x == sqrt(x+1), x, to_poly_solve=True)
For explicit results, try setting the 'to_poly_solve' keyword to True.
[x == 1/2*sqrt(5) + 1/2]
sage: solve(x == sqrt(x+1), x, to_poly_solve='use_grobner=true')
For explicit results, try setting the 'to_poly_solve' keyword to True.
[x == 1/2*sqrt(5) + 1/2]
```

Last comment: I think the info message should not be printed when I do give `to_poly_solve=` a value (see last two commands in the last session).

<a id='comment:8'></a>Replying to [benjaminfjones](#comment%3A6):
> Here is what Sage does (same system of equations, same options):

Using the same system of equations in sage does this:

```
sage: y=var('y')
sage: solve([x^2+y^2==2^2, (x-1)^2+(y-1)^2==2^2], [x, y], to_poly_solve=True)
[[x == -1/2*sqrt(7) + 1/2, y == 1/2*sqrt(7) + 1/2], [x == 1/2*sqrt(7) + 1/2, y == -1/2*sqrt(7) + 1/2]]
```

I'm sure this is what you meant :-)

Which makes is seem that use_grobner *is* set to true automatically if to_poly_solve is set to true.
I think we should forget about printing a message and just focus on fixing the documentation, but I ran into a bit of a dead end with #12809. I guess the failing doctests could be rewritten, or a shorter message could be added in the documentation (e.g. "If you don't get explicit results, try setting to_poly_solve to True.")
