However, if the optimisation level is changed from -O2 to -O1, the program behaves properly.

```

Similar problems have been observed on other platforms too. A revised package, which works around the gcc 4.6.0 bug by adding the flag -fno-ivopts:

Reported upstream to gcc: [http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48702](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48702)

The patch is very simple.  The new spkg builds on both hawk (OpenSolaris on x86, with gcc 4.5.0 and gcc 4.6.0) and t2 (Solaris on sparc, with gcc 4.5.1 and 4.6.0), and tests pass in all cases.  With the old version, tests failed on both machines using gcc 4.6.0 (but everything worked fine with the earlier version of gcc).

Note: to build with gcc 4.6.0 on t2, I had to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH and unset LD_OPTIONS; I couldn't get LD_OPTIONS to work.  But I don't really know how to properly use these variables anyway...

It should be noted that there are quite a few Sage patches applied - some directly to the source code, which should not have been done, but has been done. This package has been patched 13 times already!

I've now changed this so instead of reducing the optimisation on Solaris, it does it on all platforms with gcc 4.6.0. First it tests for gcc using `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/testcc.sh`, then if we are using gcc, a second test is performed for gcc 4.6.0 by adding the '`dumpversion`' option to gcc. 

The following is the critical bit of new code.

```
OPTIMIZATION_FLAGS="-O2"
if [ "x`$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/testcc.sh $CC`" = xGCC ] && [ "x`$CC -dumpversion`" = x4.6.0 ] ; then 
   echo "Warning: Reducing the optimisation level to -O1 due to a bug in gcc 4.6.0"
   OPTIMIZATION_FLAGS="-O1"
fi
```

There are some typos corrected too - see the attached patch.

I think my test

if [ "x`$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/testcc.sh $CC`" = xGCC ] && [ "x`$CC -dumpversion`" = x4.6.0 ] ; then  
```

for the version is preferable. I can't see the point in calling a C compiler with --version then greping the output, where there is a documented option (-dumpversion) to show just the version, 

Also, this could well fail for another compiler with a version of 4.6.0 - I think its safer to test for gcc first.

My test *does* test for gcc in the `--version` output.

If I change the gcc test to use your original test code, would the rest of my patch get positive_review?

I need to be doing something else now (gardening), so don't have chance to do much with this, but a few quick notes.

If it does not, then I would consider that a compiler bug. The Intel compiler supports '`-dumpversion`' - see\n\nhttp://software.intel.com/sites/products/documentation/hpc/compilerpro/en-us/cpp/lin/main_cls_lin.pdf\n\nClang does too:\n\nhttps://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project/cfe/trunk/include/clang/Driver/Options.td?sortby=date&r1=106956&r2=106955&pathrev=106956&diff_format=s\n\n*GCC For Sun Systems* uses the gcc front end and takes the GNU options. It actually uses the GCC source code, so I assume that would take the '`-dumpversion`' option too. \n\nI'm not aware of any other GCC compatible compiler.

> > * My test does not use the -dumpversion option unless the compiler is first confirmed to be gcc, since the second part of the test (the version) will not be executed unless the first part (the type of compiler), is confirmed to be GCC. So I don't really see the need to send stderr to /dev/null, but I'm not bothered about that fact.

I think if any compiler is going to aim to be GCC compatible then it would need to support the '`-dumpversion`' option. If it does not, then I would consider that a compiler bug. The Intel compiler supports '`-dumpversion`' - see

http://software.intel.com/sites/products/documentation/hpc/compilerpro/en-us/cpp/lin/main_cls_lin.pdf

Clang does too:

https://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project/cfe/trunk/include/clang/Driver/Options.td?sortby=date&r1=106956&r2=106955&pathrev=106956&diff_format=s

*GCC For Sun Systems* uses the gcc front end and takes the GNU options. It actually uses the GCC source code, so I assume that would take the '`-dumpversion`' option too. 

I'm not aware of any other GCC compatible compiler. But if they really are GCC compatible, they should take the '`-dumpversion`' option. 

I've just checked gcc 3.4.3, and that takes the '`-dumpversion`' option. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~$ /usr/bin/gcc -dumpversion
3.4.3
drkirkby@hawk:~$ /usr/bin/g++ -dumpversion
3.4.3
drkirkby@hawk:~$ 
```

Just out of interest, I checked on t2.math (a SPARC system), and that supports `-dumpversion`' too.

```
kirkby@t2:32 ~$ /usr/sfw/bin/gcc -dumpversion
3.4.3
```

I would use more caution if it was the Fortran compiler we were testing, as the option gave a different output (same as --version) in older versions of gfortran. But that bug was fixed a year or two ago, so that now '`gfortran`' gives just the version number if given the option '`-dumpversion`'. But that test in the rubiks package only tests the C compiler, so it's immaterial what `gfortran` does. 

I would also note we are using the `-dumpversion`' compiler option already. The 'prereq' script uses two autoconf macros (`ax_gcc_version.m4` & `ax_gxx_version.m4`) which use the option. That is run to check the versions of gcc and g++ are the same. So I think if there was a problem using the `-dumpversion`' compiler option, we would have known about it before.

Why?

There already exist pre-release versions of gcc 4.6.1 manifesting the same problem.

I think that having the workaround for all versions 4.6.x doesn't really hurt.  It is certainly a safer alternative than applying the workaround only for gcc 4.6.0.  If at some point, this bug is fixed in a later gcc 4.6.x, then we can still change the spkg accordingly.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment:35):
> Can somebody please review?  Thanks.

Sure:

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.7.rc0$  ./sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/interfaces/rubik.py
sage -t -long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/rubik.py"
	 [25.5 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 25.6 seconds
```

so that option is working to resolve the bug on OpenSolaris too. This looks good to me.
