The error message of the call to random_matrix(QQ, 4, 8, rank=5) is quite cryptic.
It should be easy to check that the rank is greater than min(nrows,ncols) and throw a ValueError with a meaningful message.

A patch, which also fixes a similar small fly in random_subspaces_matrix, is attached.
The cumulative patch incorporates more doctests, the fix for rank==1 problem described in the comments, and puts a cup on the number of iterations in various while loops, so that they fail meaningfully.

v2-patch is Dima's original, but with a Trac number in the commit message.

There was one doctest failure on the subspace routine (the fly), since `None` is an allowed value for the rank, and it seems `None < 0` is `True`.  I moved a hunk of code that checks the `rank=None` case to happen early, and removed a pointless else-clause.

I like doctests that exercise error-conditions, so I added 3 new doctests.  Original patch is a positive review from me, whoever wants to review my patch (Dima?) can flip this whole ticket to positive review if my patch is OK.

I've used the function *all the time* the past year, so that is indeed a surprise.  Looks like it is just the `rank=1` case, based on very limited testing.

How would you like to proceed?

the function in question has in general quite suspiciously looking code: e.g. it has

```
if upper_bound==None:
            upper_bound=50
            size=False
```
but then, when `size==False`, `upper_bound` is not used; that whole `size` thing can (and should, in a clearly written code) be replaced by if-else...

My understanding of the code is that it first gets `matrix` of specified `rank`, and then uses it to create the
result, of the same `rank`, but taking random vectors of the row space of `matrix`.
WIth the `upper_bound` set (and `size==True`, I don't even see how it always succeeds to terminate!
If I set `upper_bound=4`, I run into cases that look non-terminating. E.g. try running

```
 for i in range(100):
    rk=randint(2,13)
    print rk,i
    m = random_matrix( QQ, 13, 13, algorithm='echelonizable', rank=rk,   upper_bound=4)
```
I bet it will never finish, or at least I usually see it printing only 1 row of output, and then basically going into
an infinite loop. It seems that `matrix` itself should have well-controlled absolute values of entries, to begin with, 
but it's not done.

I'd say this has either to be re-done, or scrapped...

The current code is just a dirty hack, and it should at least have a limit on the number of tries done before giving up!

If you ask for `upper_bound=1`, then I think you get what you deserve.  ;-)

So I would definitely like to see this feature kept - in other words, I would like to see the interface stay stable, with changes to the code.  I'd be happy with throwing an exception after some number of attempts.

I'm taking a break from most Sage work for a few weeks to get caught up on other things, so won't be able to address this immediately.

our servers don't deserve being trashed by 120 undergrads, running never ending loops, executing seemingly innocent Sage commands. :)

Yes, ball is in my court.  So are lots of other balls.  ;-)

I have not forgotten this one, but for months now have not been in a position to get too into Sage work.  I use this routine all the time, and it never fails me.  That is not an excuse, it should be fixed as Dima has noticed, but it has not been a high-priority item for me.

Reviewer patch:

1.  Removed debugging print statements.
2.  Code for sanity tests on inputs from the very first "v2" patch were missing, so the corresponding doctests were failing.  Code has been restored, doctests function properly now.
3.  Passed `max_tries` through the unimodular routine, since it has an `upper_bound` keyword.

WeBWorK homework system can now query the Sage cell server.  The `random_matrix()` function is very appealing, but it absolutely must return every time or some poor undergrad will just get a system hang rather than a homework exercise.  So I have added three prominent warnings about requesting upper bounds.

I need to fix the randomness in these functions, see #10122.  GSL is to blame, and I have a working fix.  Then the doctests will need a total overhaul, so I'm tempted to do some other things here (document `max_tries`) but want that to wait.

I'm fine with Dima's code contributions.

Dima - I apologize for sitting on this for such a very long time.  If you like my changes/contributions, would you flip this to positive review?  If so, then I will build more onto it on other tickets.

Thanks, Dima!  You are much more conscientious than me.  ;-)

I'll try to get my GSL-random-seed patch up sometime tomorrow night.  Busy all day tomorrow.

no, if you ask me to referee a paper, I might sit on it for a year easily...

Good that this patch didn't bitrot completely :–)
