The latest gcc 4.6.0 fails to compile lcalc - something the Sun compiler has always refused to do. #7065 shows the problems reported by the Sun compiler. 

GCC 4.5.0 and 4.5.1 compile *lcalc*, though they give lots of warnings. Hopefully GCC is becoming stricter about the code it accepts, which can only be a good thing IMHO. 

This problem was noticed on a Sun Ultra 27 running OpenSolaris 06/2009. This has a 3.33 GHz Intel Xeon W3580 CPU, not a SPARC processor. Part of the error message is below. 

A full log is attached. As you can see, this code generates tons of warnings. 

I've set the component to "solaris" as this is the only system on which I know this is failing to build, but can someone please change it to "build" if it fails to build on OS X or Linux with gcc 4.6.0. I rather suspect the same issue will apply on Linux and OS X.

Oops, I should have checked. Can the release manager close this.

I don't see any point in this having a positive review myself. There was never anything to review.
