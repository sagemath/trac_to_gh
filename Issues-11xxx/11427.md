Do you mean installing the spkg leads to the failure? We have observed that exact same test failure since #10334 was introduced for the first time in the 4.7 release cycle in sage-on-gentoo https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/50

As far as we can see gap just seem to be very fussy in its behavior.

It could be interesting to find out exactly which dataset cause the failure and why. But if the test is that sensitive it should be changed. I'll copy Mike Hansen and Nicolas Thi√©ry who did most of the work on #10334.

I also tested that with the optional spkg installed the doctest now works.

```

sage -t -long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 15.1 seconds
