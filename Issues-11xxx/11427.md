Do you mean installing the spkg leads to the failure? We have observed that exact same test failure since #10334 was introduced for the first time in the 4.7 release cycle in sage-on-gentoo https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/50

As far as we can see gap just seem to be very fussy in its behavior.
