Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A6):
> How is this related to #12750 and #12655?

The spkg here should get rebased on that of #12750, to a p3.

If #12655 (currently needing work) gets merged before this one, this ticket can be closed, as upgrading to 0.8.1 would also fix the issue, if I'm not completely wrong.
