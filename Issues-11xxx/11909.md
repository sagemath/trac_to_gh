After #11575 was positively reviewed the PolyBoRi 0.7.1 spkg was improved in #11906. 

So we have to merge the recent changes from http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/polybori-0.7.1.p7.spkg into http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/polybori-0.8.0.p1.spkg

### Current patches/spkg
* **Install** http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/polybori-0.8.0.p2.spkg.0

Depends on #12750
Depends on #12655

Upstream: **Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.**

The spkg here should get rebased on that of #12750, to a p3.

If #12655 (currently needing work) gets merged before this one, this ticket can be closed, as upgrading to 0.8.1 would also fix the issue, if I'm not completely wrong.
