    See the function :func:`sage.misc.cython.cython` for documentation 
    for the other inputs.
```

which leads to `TODO`... :)

I'm almost ok with your changes, will test them shortly, so we should have a positive review then.

I think `compile_and_load()` should also take keyword arguments, but that's for another ticket. Perhaps just add another `TODO`.

After applying this patch `make ptestlong` ends with

```
...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The temporary doctesting directory
   /home/dima/.sage/tmp/spms_banana-30578
was not removed: it is not empty, presumably because doctests
failed or doctesting was interrupted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following tests failed:

        sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/interfaces/sage0.py # 11 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 2884.8 seconds
make: *** [ptestlong] Error 128
```

The test in question gives the following:

```

sage -t -long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/sage0.py"

Yesterday I had duplicated it like 5 or 6 times, and today it doesn't want to be duplicated.
