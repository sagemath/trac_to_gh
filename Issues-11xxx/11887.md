    See the function :func:`sage.misc.cython.cython` for documentation

which leads to `TODO`... :)

I'm almost ok with your changes, will test them shortly, so we should have a positive review then.

I think `compile_and_load()` should also take keyword arguments, but that's for another ticket. Perhaps just add another `TODO`.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The temporary doctesting directory
   /home/dima/.sage/tmp/spms_banana-30578
was not removed: it is not empty, presumably because doctests
failed or doctesting was interrupted.

The following tests failed:
