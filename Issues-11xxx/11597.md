This patch adds a method `dimension_singularities()` to toric varieties that computes the dimension of the singular set. This is usually one of the first questions one has, so I find it rather convenient to have a method for it. It also adds an optional `fan.is_smooth(codim=d)` argument for expert use, though in practice I think its easy to get confused with dimension and codimension so I did **not** add a similar optional argument to `toric_variety.is_smooth()`.
