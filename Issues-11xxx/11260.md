```
The problem is specific to Windows 7, and (most probably---untested) other newer than XP Windows releases, like Vista, etc. 
On these systems Cygwin has still some glitches related to fork etc... 
Note that it builds fine under WinXP. 

Symptoms - dreadfully looking errors on address spaces of DLLs with temporary names, and dead or dying forks...

dimpase reports on [this sage-devel thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/1a3ddc6dd70fa8aa) (at the very end) that Maxima now compiles on Windows 7 with the new ECL spkg for Lion at #11884.

My guess is that if Dima positively reviews as sage-invalid, that would be sufficient.  This would not close #11502 since that is an XP problem, though likely we will simply just forget about XP soon.
