The problem is specific to Windows 7, and (most probably---untested) other newer than XP Windows releases, like Vista, etc. 
On these systems Cygwin has still some glitches related to fork etc... 
Note that it builds fine under WinXP. 

Symptoms - dreadfully looking errors on address spaces of DLLs with temporary names, and dead or dying forks...

My guess is that if Dima positively reviews as sage-invalid, that would be sufficient.  This would not close #11502 since that is an XP problem, though likely we will simply just forget about XP soon.
