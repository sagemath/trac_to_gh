The documentation of Singular is in a different format than the documentation of Sage. Hence, if a singular_function happens to be included into the reference manual then there will be numerous errors.

Example:

```
sage: from sage.libs.singular.function import singular_function
sage: f = singular_function('NF')
sage: f?
    ...
    This function is an automatically generated C wrapper around the Singular
    function 'NF'.

    ...

    The Singular documentation for 'NF' is given below.
    
    5.1.111 reduce
    --------------
    
    `*Syntax:*'
         `reduce (' poly_expression`,' ideal_expression `)'
         `reduce (' poly_expression`,' ideal_expression`,' int_expression
    ...
```

The back tick is interpreted as the beginning of a Latex expression, the indentation is not as it should be, and the header is very likely out of place.

My suggestion is to indent the documentation of Singular and prepend it by `::`, so that in the reference manual the Singular documentation simply appears as a block quote.

With the patch:

```
sage: from sage.libs.singular.function import singular_function
sage: f = singular_function('NF')
sage: f?
    ...
    This function is an automatically generated C wrapper around the Singular
    function 'NF'.
    ...
    The Singular documentation for 'NF' is given below.
    
    ::
    
        
        5.1.111 reduce
        --------------
        
        `*Syntax:*'
             `reduce (' poly_expression`,' ideal_expression `)'
             `reduce (' poly_expression`,' ideal_expression`,' int_expression
```
