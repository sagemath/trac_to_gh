We use Maxima's [radcan](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/en/maxima_9.html#Item_003a-radcan) (warning - link may change) for `simplify_radical`.  The documentation claims 

```
Simplifies expr, which can contain logs, exponentials, and radicals, by
converting it into a form which is canonical over a large class of expressions
and a given ordering of variables; that is, all functionally equivalent forms
are mapped into a unique form. For a somewhat larger class of expressions,
radcan produces a regular form. Two equivalent expressions in this class do
not necessarily have the same appearance, but their difference can be
simplified by radcan to zero.

For some expressions radcan is quite time consuming. This is the cost of
exploring certain relationships among the components of the expression for
simplifications based on factoring and partial-fraction expansions of
exponents. 
```
but it can be really hard to tell exactly what this all means.  See [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/767/simplification-errors-in-simple-expressions) and #8497, to which this is a followup.

The plan is to rename `simplify_radical()` to `radcan()` to match the upstream name. We can then alias `simplify_radical()` to `radcan()`, and deprecate the `simplify_radical()` name.

Afterwards we can attempt to clarify the docs, and provide more examples of `radcan()`'s usage. We should provide both cautionary examples from our tickets, and some of the use cases that Dr. Fateman has described.

Why would we use the Maxima name? It doesn't match any Sage convention. I suggest `radical_canonicalize()` or `canonicalize_radical()` in anticipation of other `canonicalize_*()` methods.

I just pushed another commit adding the example from #3520. I'm against adding `canonicalize_exp` and `canonicalize_log` methods, since they don't seem to serve a purpose and can cause bugs. For example, see the change I made in relation.py:

```
 #Try to apply some simplifications to see if left - right == 0
- simp_list = [difference.simplify_log, difference.simplify_rational, difference.simplify_exp,difference.simplify_radical,difference.simplify_trig]
+ simp_list = [difference.simplify_log, difference.simplify_rational,difference.canonicalize_radical,difference.simplify_trig]
```

Both `simplify_exp` and `simplify_radical` were being called, wasting cycles, because they're the same thing!

I can see the benefit for things like `full_simplify()` where we're mimicking the Mathematica name so that new users can find it through tab completion. But for `canonicalize_*` I don't think it's going to do us any good.

I'm happy to add these. I've been meaning to add `simplify_rectform()` to `simplify_full()` once I stop making changes all over expression.pyx. Maybe in that ticket, or #14630 is probably where it's most appropriate since it adds yet another `simplify_*` method.

That code is adding methods to a class -- if we remove `simplify_radical` entirely, it will break code that attempts to call `simplify_radical` on a vector. Instead I leave it there to throw the deprecation warning.
