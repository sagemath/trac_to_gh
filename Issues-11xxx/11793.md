The script `sage-maketest` is supposed to test everything in the Sage library, but it says

```
"$SAGE_ROOT"/sage -t -sagenb "$@" "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage/doc/common "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage/doc/en "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage/doc/fr  "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage/sage 2>&1 | tee -a "$SAGE_TEST_LOG"
```
The relatively new directories .../doc/de and .../doc/ru are not there.  We should autogenerate this list.  The same goes for the script `sage-apply-ticket`.

Why not

```sh
"$SAGE_ROOT"/sage -t -sagenb "$@" \
    "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage/doc/common \
    "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage/doc/?? \
    "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage/sage 2>&1 | tee -a "$SAGE_TEST_LOG"
```
or use `[a-z][a-z}` instead of `??`.

These should always be two-letter country codes, ASCII.

I mean that gives you a list of the languages, without the full path.

Omit the `cd` and prepend the path to `??` if you need the full path.

If you want to avoid trouble with spaces in `$f`, use

```sh
docdirs="$docdirs '$f'"
```

But that's not necessary if you just use the shell's file pattern matching as given above.
