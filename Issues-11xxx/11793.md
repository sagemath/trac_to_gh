The script `sage-maketest` is supposed to test everything in the Sage library, but it says

```
"$SAGE_ROOT"/sage -t -sagenb "$@" "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage/doc/common "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage/doc/en "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage/doc/fr  "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage/sage 2>&1 | tee -a "$SAGE_TEST_LOG"
```
The relatively new directories .../doc/de and .../doc/ru are not there.  We should autogenerate this list.  The same goes for the script `sage-apply-ticket`.

Why not

```sh
"$SAGE_ROOT"/sage -t -sagenb "$@" \
    "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage/doc/common \
    "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage/doc/?? \
    "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage/sage 2>&1 | tee -a "$SAGE_TEST_LOG"
```
or use `[a-z][a-z}` instead of `??`.

These should always be two-letter country codes, ASCII.

I mean that gives you a list of the languages, without the full path.

Omit the `cd` and prepend the path to `??` if you need the full path.

If you want to avoid trouble with spaces in `$f`, use

```sh
docdirs="$docdirs '$f'"
```

But that's not necessary if you just use the shell's file pattern matching as given above.

Why do we need `sage-maketest` in the first place?  All other test targets (`testall`, `testlong`, `ptest`,...) simply use the top-level `Makefile`.  Why does `make test` need to be special?

In any case, needs_work because the `Makefile` patch should be rebased to #11926 + #11959.

I'm okay with trac_11793-makefile.patch and trac_11793.v2.patch.  I've added trac_11793-main.patch which should apply to the main repo and autogenerate LANGUAGES in build_options.py 

John, could you look over this.  Assuming that's okay, I think we can give this a positive review.
