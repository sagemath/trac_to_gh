non_surjective() docstring incorrectly states that it's inconclusive and often wrong for p=2. The function it calls, is_surjective, is correct for p=2.

The docstring states that "[the] list of primes p such that the mod-p representation *might* not be surjective... usually contains 2, because of shortcomings of the algorithm..." However, non_surjective calls is_surjective, which should always be correct for p=2,3 because it computes the Galois group of the 2-division polynomial. (More precisely, its helper, _is_surjective, does this.) I suspect this caveat may have been written before the special cases for p=2,3 in _is_surjective had been written.

All that really needs to be done is to remove the phrase "(this list usually contains 2, because of shortcomings of the algorithm)" from the docstring.
