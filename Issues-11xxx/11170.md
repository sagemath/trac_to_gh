The attached patch allows you to do this:

```
sage: a = animate([sin(x + float(k)) for k in srange(0,2*pi,0.7)])
sage: a.ffmpeg('output.mpg')
```
or

```
sage: a.ffmpeg('output.avi')
```
Also, calling

```
sage: a.save('output.mpg')  # or a.save('output.avi')
```
for example will work, calling the ffmpeg method.  If ffmpeg is installed, it is also used to construct animated gifs, since it's faster than convert.

There was some discussion of this here: [https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/TdQ29S32K9k/discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/TdQ29S32K9k/discussion).

This also clean up some doctest flags, using `# optional -- ImageMagick` and `# optional -- ffmpeg` to mark the appropriate tests.  For me, tests pass with each of the following combinations, and there are no stray graphics files created:

```
sage -t -long -optional animate.py    (with convert and ffmpeg installed)
sage -t -long -only-optional=imagemagick (with only convert installed)
sage -t -long -only-optional=ffmpeg (with only ffmpeg installed)
sage -t -long
```

I think somewhere, at some point, we should try to document what packages would be useful to have with Sage. We say LaTex is *highly recommended*, but it would be worth documenting things that are useful like *FFmpeg* and *ImageMagick*. But that of course is for another ticket.

Nice!  Here are a few things I noticed in the patch:

line 334: "neither ffmpeg or ImageMagick is not installed...": needs to be cleaned up

line 458: "Returns an mpeg showing...": this is from the docstring for .ffmpeg -- should it be reworded to include other video formats?

line 527: "saving an animation to an mpg file..." : this error message is shown even if another format is chosen -- could be confusing if a user misunderstands and thinks that mpg format is the underlying problem.

My point was that even if the exact details of the animation changed from version to version, I would not expect the size to vary much. So perhaps checking the number of KB (or even MB of the file) would give a reasonable confidence the program is producing an mpeg file of about the right length.

That would be quite platform dependent. It would not work on some systems like AIX, where such files are likely to be under /pware. Neither would it work if someone wanted to install ImageMagick, but did not have root access, so had to build it under their home directory.

Fair enough. Perhaps for another ticket, we could consider making use of one of the more obscure program names in ImageMagick for a test.

As you are aware, I'm not a Python guru, so don't feel able to give this a proper review, but there was something else that I found a bit odd. I don't know if there is any standard for specifying if optional tests get run. Take a look at for one example for Mathematica

```
    sage: mobj = mathematica(x^2-1)             # optional - mathematica
```

in the file

```
./devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/mathematica.py
```

and now compare that to yours on this ticket. 

```
sage: a.show() # optional -- ImageMagick 
```

Two obvious things are different can be seen. 

* The Mathematica example uses two hypens, your example uses one. 
* The Mathematica example uses all lower case, despite Wolfram Research use an upper case M at the start. Your example uses the proper case for ImageMagick

**IF** this means that one needs to specify how to run the Mathematica and ImageMagick tests differently, then I think that's a bad idea. But I've got no idea what is considered "right" in sage, but I think we should at least be consistent. 

I suspect the most robust solution is for the code to accept either case - i.e. convert all to lower case, then accept that. Then it would not matter what the user typed. Again outside this ticket, but if it has been agreed to use all lower case, then perhaps you should use that).

<gripe>It does rather annoy me Sage refers to Matlab, despite MATLAB (with all capital letters) is a registered trademark, I actually wish we would stick to how the upstream developers use the term.</gripe>

For either ffmpeg or ImageMagick by themselves, this might be right, but ffmpeg produces GIFs which are larger (by a fair amount) than ImageMagick does, it seems to me in my limited testing.
