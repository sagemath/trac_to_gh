Currently the methods core and quotient returns respectively a list and a list
of list:

```
sage: Partition([7,7,5,3,3,3,1]).core(3)
[1, 1]
sage: type(Partition([7,7,5,3,3,3,1]).core(3))
<type 'list'>

sage:  sage: Partition([7,7,5,3,3,3,1]).quotient(3)
[[2], [1], [2, 2, 2]]
sage:  type(Partition([7,7,5,3,3,3,1]).quotient(3)[0])
<type 'list'>
```
Mathematically, those lists are partitions and moreover list are not
hashable. As a consequence, in most use we have no choice but to change them
to partitions. So after the patch, core should returns a partition and
quotient a tuple of partitions.
