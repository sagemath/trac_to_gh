Since sage does not have any boolean satisfiablity support, we should change this :-)

Implement a simple interface to SAT solvers:

Ideas:
1) Data structures
- clauses
- cnf formulas (implements DIMACS converting...)
- results
2) Additional features to CNF class
- various implementations of at most k variables are true
3) Some examples
- e.g., Sudoku, vertex cover via binary search
4) Solver shell/string parsing interface for:
- MiniSAT
- RSAT
- Berkmin
- Siege
- zChaff

Further ideas:
5) direct C++ Interface (suggested by Martin)
- MiniSAT
- RSAT
- CryptMiniSat


Some ideas are attached:
- sat.py implements 
    - Clause (set of integers inherits from set)
    - CNFFormula (list of Clauses)
        - features:
        - create DIMACS
        - read from DIMACS
        - is_satisfiable (calls sat solver)
        - solve (calls sat solver and returns additional information), next step: obtain satisfiable assignments from solvers
        - is_horn (do we have HORN clauses only)
        - is_2cnf (do we have 2 CNF clauses only)
        - at_most_k_variables_true (adds clauses such that at most k variables are true)

- backend.py
   - SolverResult (simple result class, needs improvement)
   - Solver (call SAT solver, process string solver result)

Given recent activity there, is this a dup?  Of course, there is code here (and #11479) which could be useful, so I won't make that call.
