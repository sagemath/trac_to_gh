I am of the opinion that control-backspace should delete the previous word.  Since this is what it does everywhere else on my system, I constantly find myself combining notebook cells that have no business being combined.  All in all it would be nice to have some way to customize the keybindings in the notebook (ideally per user).

Attachment: **[trac_11009-sagenb.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11009/trac_11009-sagenb.patch.gz)**

Until the day of enlightenment comes we can at least execute a config file in DOT_SAGE which allows customization via something like

```
js.keyhandler.key_codes['join_cell']=[]
js.keyhandler.add('join_cell', key = "KEY_BKSPC", alt=True)
```

Tom,  William said that you knew about this part of the code and so if there is a better way to do this, don't hesitate to make me change it.

This is essentially the use case we planned on.  My only complaint is that the format of .keys is a bit obnoxious, and this utterly lacks the documentation necessary to make it configurable.

A preferable alternative is to implement a keybinding portion of user preferences.  Unfortunately, the specific order that keybindings are tested in is highly sensitive to the keys that are pressed.

I realize my patch is crappy :-)  It was the bare minimum that I could figure out.  I'm happy to add documentation and make the keys file more sane if that's a good approach.

I'm not familiar with the notebook at all.  How difficult would this be and where would I begin?  Or should I let an expert do it?

I think this should be closed since the notebook is now a separate project and in any case, there is work on a completely new frontend.
