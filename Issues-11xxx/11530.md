My patch completely avoids the string replacement.

If a variable name is given, it replaces `self.parent()._finite_field_ext_pari_modulus_as_str()` by `repr(self.parent().modulus()._pari_with_name(var))`, and `self.polynomial()` allows to change the variable name as well, so, I use `self.polynomial(var)` instead.

Of course I added a test, and the tests of `sage/rings/finite_rings/element_givaro.pyx` pass. I didn't run full tests, yet, but I think it is ready for review.

There is also a `_finite_field_ext_pari_modulus_as_`str() method for the NTL finite fields of characteristic 2, which in my patch was just as easy to fix.  Not sure why Jeroen's error shows up for order 127^3.  My patch does string replacement, but passes all long tests.

Have to go for a bit, I'll post more details in a few hours, but right now I'd say a second ticket is probably not needed.

v2 patch is a tweak of Simon's nice patch.  Passes all tests in sage/rings.  I think this will allow totally removing the two versions of `_finite_field_ext_pari_modulus_as_str()`.  I am going to test the removal with a test of the full Sage library.

Without search and replace, we get a 2x speedup.  I have not posted my search/replace patch since it seems useless now.

Timings, all in microseconds, of the two commands below.

```
sage: F.<a>=GF(3^5)
sage: a._pari_init_()
sage: a._pari_init_('b')

                        var=None       var='b'
4.7 status quo            779            780
Rob search/replace        782            787
Simon                     781            381
Simon + Rob (v2)          369            381
```

So it appears better coding will get us speed improvements.  Imagine that!

The `_pari_init_()` method of `sage.rings.finite_rings.element_ext_pari.FiniteField_ext_pariElement` is not designed to take a new variable.  Should it be?

I found this problem originally when trying to factor a polynomial with coefficients from `GF(3^5)`.  It looks to me like a factorization of a polynomial over `GF(127^3)` takes a different path, since the polynomial is of a different type, and therefore does not call `_pari_init_()` to change a variable name.

Is this failure a non-issue?

With v2 patch, and both instances of `_finite_field_ext_pari_modulus_as_str()` commented-out, all long tests pass.

(a) Does the v2 patch look acceptable?  It is uniformly faster and seems to fix the original problem.

(b) Do we need to address Jeroen's annoyance above?

(c) Should we trash both `_finite_field_ext_pari_modulus_as_str()`?

I can manufacture a final patch, with Simon's name on it, if desired.  We could then call on Jeroen for a review.

Yes, please. I am currently unable to work.

Done in v3 patch.  Patch has Simon's name on it, but I've added myself as an author.  

Highlights:

1.  Some expansion of the docstring - trying to be sure to test fields of characteristic 2 and elements that are not just the generator alone.
2.  Eliminated two versions of `_finite_field_ext_pari_modulus_as_str()` since they are not needed and comments indicate they are not even very desirable.

Patch passes all long tests on 4.7.1.alpha2.

Rob

Wow, nice catch!

OK, I'll make it so, and fix about 4 doctests (and perhaps more code fixes will become obvious via the failing doctests).

I haven't spent enough time with this code to know that the coefficients *must* be hit by Mod - thanks for the advice.

Probably have something up this evening (Seattle time).
