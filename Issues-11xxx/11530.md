My patch completely avoids the string replacement.

If a variable name is given, it replaces `self.parent()._finite_field_ext_pari_modulus_as_str()` by `repr(self.parent().modulus()._pari_with_name(var))`, and `self.polynomial()` allows to change the variable name as well, so, I use `self.polynomial(var)` instead.

Of course I added a test, and the tests of `sage/rings/finite_rings/element_givaro.pyx` pass. I didn't run full tests, yet, but I think it is ready for review.

There is also a _finite_field_ext_pari_modulus_as_str() method for the NTL finite fields of characteristic 2, which in my patch was just as easy to fix.  Not sure why Jeroen's error shows up for order 127^3.  My patch does string replacement, but passes all long tests.

Have to go for a bit, I'll post more details in a few hours, but right now I'd say a second ticket is probably not needed.

Appears "big" fields do not have a _finite_field_ext_pari_modulus_as_str() method at all.

I have a tweak to Simon's patch that may be just a bit cleaner and work for all fields.  In a bit.

v2 patch is a tweak of Simon's nice patch.  Passes all tests in sage/rings.  I think this will allow totally removing the two versions of `_finite_field_ext_pari_modulus_as_str()`.  I am going to test the removal with a test of the full Sage library.

Without search and replace, we get a 2x speedup.  I have not posted my search/replace patch since it seems useless now.

Timings, all in microseconds, of the two commands below.

```
sage: F.<a>=GF(3^5)
sage: a._pari_init_()
sage: a._pari_init_('b')

                        var=None       var='b'
4.7 status quo            779            780

The `_pari_init_()` method of `sage.rings.finite_rings.element_ext_pari.FiniteField_ext_pariElement` is not designed to take a new variable.  Should it be?

I found this problem originally when trying to factor a polynomial with coefficients from `GF(3^5)`.  It looks to me like a factorization of a polynomial over `GF(127^3)` takes a different path, since the polynomial is of a different type, and therefore does not call `_pari_init_()` to change a variable name.

Is this failure a non-issue?

With v2 patch, and both instances of `_finite_field_ext_pari_modulus_as_str()` commented-out, all long tests pass.

(a) Does the v2 patch look acceptable?  It is uniformly faster and seems to fix the original problem.

(b) Do we need to address Jeroen's annoyance above?

(c) Should we trash both `_finite_field_ext_pari_modulus_as_str()`?

I can manufacture a final patch, with Simon's name on it, if desired.  We could then call on Jeroen for a review.

Done in v3 patch.  Patch has Simon's name on it, but I've added myself as an author.  

Highlights:

1.  Some expansion of the docstring - trying to be sure to test fields of characteristic 2 and elements that are not just the generator alone.
2.  Eliminated two versions of `_finite_field_ext_pari_modulus_as_str()` since they are not needed and comments indicate they are not even very desirable.

Patch passes all long tests on 4.7.1.alpha2.

Wny not make lines 370--371 more consistent and write

```
g = str(self.parent().modulus()._pari_with_name(var))
f = str(self.polynomial()._pari_with_name(var))
```

I guess you could even omit the "str()" since that will be done anyway in the formatting on line 372.

Wow, nice catch!

The current behaviour is totally wrong, the coefficients **must** be hit by a `Mod`, otherwise we can get wrong results!  I remember fixing another instance of this bug (#10486).

v5 patch:

Consistent commands, as suggested.

Dead code removal ("modulus_as_str" routines).

Corrected doctests.

Upgraded docstrings.

Passes tests in sage/rings.

Will likely run full tests over dinner and report back.
