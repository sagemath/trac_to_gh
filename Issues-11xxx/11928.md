This patch is working correctly with the default algorithm "Cliquer".
For the "MILP" algorithm, the result is also correct.

However:
* it should be written that path 11846 (maximum independent set using MILP) should also be installed
* the description of the method needs work:
** line 3610: ``cliquer`` -> ``Cliquer`
** line 3610: add ``MILP``
** line 3617: it is written ``algorithm == "MILP"`` but previous lines are only ``Cliquer`` ``networkx``. Please unify.
** line 3652: "algorithm = algorithm" is confusing. Is this the standard notation ?
** Please unify spaces before/after "=" and "==" 

That's all for the moment ;-)

Hello !!!

The patch is updated !

* About the "algorithm = algorithm" : writing algorithm = "MILP" is equivalent, the goal is just to forward the parameter to the next function. It happens a lot in the code, and it's less trouble for later if the parameters need to be changed.
* I also fixed the alignment of the ``cliques`` entry in the documentation. The HTML was badly formatted because of that.

Thanks for the comments ! `:-)`
