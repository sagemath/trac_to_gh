Attachment [trac_11234_ideal_class_order.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket11234/trac_11234_ideal_class_order.patch) by fwclarke created at 2011-04-24 09:49:23

The root cause of this defect is that the coordinates of class group elements were Pari integers.Â 

The problem wasn't detected before because only generators were tested in the doctests for `sage.rings.number_field.class_group.FractionalIdealClass.order` .

The attached patch fixes the problem and alters one doctest.
