I experienced a problem in the Mandriva sagemath 4.7.1 that was causing sage to exit with the this somewhat funny message:

sage: from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import maxima_lib

`/usr/share/sage/local/bin/sage-sage: line 178:  7177 Power failure           sage-ipython "$@" -i`

The problem is the logic in ecl.pyx that saves all signal handlers, initializes ecl and restores them, but this has the nasty side effect of messing with Boehm GC thread handling, that uses SIGXCPU and SIGPWR to stop/restart threads during gc.The attached patch corrects the problem for me, but is just a suggestion, and may need proper testing on non Linux systems, but on other systems Boehm GC should use a signal number larger than 32. Or, maybe add some comments about what those numbers are (SIGPWR = 30 and SIGXCPU = 24).

---

Solution turned out to be: tell ECL not to create a separate signal-handling thread (which it won't do if threads are not enabled, as in the standard Sage build of ECL).

In principle the proposed change should be OK. Restoring the 32 signal handlers was just a general approach to avoid ECL's interrupt handlers.

Note however that sage's ECL and Boehm GC are normally built with threading disabled, and then they don't touch or use SIGPWR and SIGXCPU. ECL has some quite advanced features for dealing with threads, but I recall that the approach taken with signal handlers when threads are enabled is quite incompatible with sage.

Currently, to make SIGINT work in long-running ecl code, the signal handler simply gets swapped to the ecl one and swapped back to the sage one upon exit of the ecl code. This approach is obviously incompatible with multiple threads.

The approach taken in ecl, have one thread receive all asynchronous signals and let that distribute them over the other threads is a sound one, but in order to make that work in sage we would have to have such a thread in sage and make it aware of any ecl threads running.

So in practice, if the fix here is necessary you run the risk that you are running a configuration that handles signals quite poorly. You may want to test this.

You'll at least have to restore the SIGINT handler.

The `ecl_set_option(ECL_OPT_SIGNAL_HANDLING_THREAD, 0)` is completely uncontroversial. There is a remote possibility that specifying this option might be enough to dissuade Boehm GC from using SIGPWR etc. Given that this fixes something that shouldn't occur in standard Sage configurations, such a minimal fix would be preferable. If that's enough, I can give your amended patch a positive review right away.\n\nIf it doesn't, I think SIGPWR and SIGXCPU are such exotic signals (and Sage doesn't do anything special with them anyway) that I think it should be acceptable to relinquish them to ECLs handlers. You could add them to `cdef extern int SIGINT, SIGBUS, SIGSEGV` (line 48 in ecl.pyx) to refer to them by name.\n\nIf they do need to be given to ecl, they probably need treatment in `ecl_sig_on` and `ecl_sig_off` as well. That doesn't make it thread-safe yet (imagine 2 sage threads, one of which executing ECL code that triggers a GC. What's the other thread going to do with the SIGPWR?). Perhaps jdemeyer can give some advice what to do in that case.",

Replying to [@sagetrac-pcpa](#comment:8):

> Thanks! This indeed appears to correct the problem.

Wonderful. The `ecl_set_option(ECL_OPT_SIGNAL_HANDLING_THREAD, 0)` is completely uncontroversial. There is a remote possibility that specifying this option might be enough to dissuade Boehm GC from using SIGPWR etc. Given that this fixes something that shouldn't occur in standard Sage configurations, such a minimal fix would be preferable. If that's enough, I can give your amended patch a positive review right away.

If it doesn't, I think SIGPWR and SIGXCPU are such exotic signals (and Sage doesn't do anything special with them anyway) that I think it should be acceptable to relinquish them to ECLs handlers. You could add them to `cdef extern int SIGINT, SIGBUS, SIGSEGV` (line 48 in ecl.pyx) to refer to them by name.

If they do need to be given to ecl, they probably need treatment in `ecl_sig_on` and `ecl_sig_off` as well. That doesn't make it thread-safe yet (imagine 2 sage threads, one of which executing ECL code that triggers a GC. What's the other thread going to do with the SIGPWR?). Perhaps jdemeyer can give some advice what to do in that case.

The attached patch fixes something for non-standard Sage configurations. The change cannot possibly affect standard sage configurations negatively because we really do not want a separate signal handling thread in ECL (that messes thing up in exactly the way the author was observing). So: positive review from me.

Thanks to Paulo for tracking this down.

Please use proper URLs (in this case to the raw attachment) or trac wiki mark-up ("`[attachment: here_comes_the_filename](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11752/here_comes_the_filename.gz)`") when referring to patches (or spkgs) in the description.

Also, an attachment comment *"Apply only this patch."* can make life easier.
