Assignee: @williamstein

I experienced a problem in the Mandriva sagemath 4.7.1 that was causing sage to exit with the this somewhat funny message:

sage: from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import maxima_lib

`/usr/share/sage/local/bin/sage-sage: line 178:  7177 Power failure           sage-ipython "$`@`" -i`

The problem is the logic in ecl.pyx that saves all signal handlers, initializes ecl and restores them, but this has the nasty side effect of messing with Boehm GC thread handling, that uses SIGXCPU and SIGPWR to stop/restart threads during gc.The attached patch corrects the problem for me, but is just a suggestion, and may need proper testing on non Linux systems, but on other systems Boehm GC should use a signal number larger than 32. Or, maybe add some comments about what those numbers are (SIGPWR = 30 and SIGXCPU = 24).

---

Solution turned out to be: tell ECL not to create a separate signal-handling thread (which it won't do if threads are not enabled, as in the standard Sage build of ECL).

---

Apply only [attachment:11752_ecl-nothread.patch] to the Sage library.

In principle the proposed change should be OK. Restoring the 32 signal handlers was just a general approach to avoid ECL's interrupt handlers.

Note however that sage's ECL and Boehm GC are normally built with threading disabled, and then they don't touch or use SIGPWR and SIGXCPU. ECL has some quite advanced features for dealing with threads, but I recall that the approach taken with signal handlers when threads are enabled is quite incompatible with sage.

Currently, to make SIGINT work in long-running ecl code, the signal handler simply gets swapped to the ecl one and swapped back to the sage one upon exit of the ecl code. This approach is obviously incompatible with multiple threads.

The approach taken in ecl, have one thread receive all asynchronous signals and let that distribute them over the other threads is a sound one, but in order to make that work in sage we would have to have such a thread in sage and make it aware of any ecl threads running.

So in practice, if the fix here is necessary you run the risk that you are running a configuration that handles signals quite poorly. You may want to test this.

This does not test asynchronous signal handling at all. The easiest way to do so is to start up a time-consuming job and send some Ctrl-C signals to the process (I don't think there are many other async signals Sage is required to handle properly).  See #10818 for some relevant tests and ideas.

You'll at least have to restore the SIGINT handler.

Absolutely! This is very useful work.

Some observations:
- the fact that you land in ECL's break-loop is indeed a sign something is broken, because we run the equivalent of a "try ... expect" in ecl_eval, so the interrupt should be caught and propagated up. I suspect this breaks because you are running it in a thread-enabled ECL. Perhaps the ctrl-C arrives at a different thread that is not running under such protection? There has to be a thread-aware option in ECL to change the handling of SIGINT, though. We could adjust that
- You should exit ECL's break-loop with ":q", not "(quit)". The latter terminates the ECL session, but because ECL is not running its top-level (it's embedded), it cannot really do this and hence leaves the system in an inconsistent state. So the memory corruption you are observing is probably not due to erroneous signal handling.

Thank you for testing this! It looks like for now we should really advise people against running ECL in thread-enabled mode inside Sage. Unfortunately, it seems enabling/disabling threads is something done at configure time, not at ECL run time.

Sorry, the patch is  formatted for the procedure I use to rpmbuild sagemath. I am not much used to mercurial... Based on log, it should be something like "hg import -p4 sage-4.7.1-ecl_module.patch".

I will edit the patch to look like patches from raw mode view of commits to hg.sagemath.org, and add a description to the "patch header".

Thanks! Patch applied but it still didn't quite look like a "mercurial" patch (things like date and author missing) so I reexported the patch with "hg export qtip". I hope this patch is OK.
