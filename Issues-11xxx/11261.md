There was a small bugfix release of PolyBoRi.

Perhaps we can revert #11019.

I added a small patch, that makes PolyBoRi compatible with upcoming M4RI release: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/polybori-0.7.1.p1.spkg

It also fixed the issue that the while site-packages directory was recompiled.
(Both backported from upcoming PolyBoRi 0.8.)

Probably not the proper place to report this but I have tried to compile polybori against m4ri-20100817 and it doesn't work:
