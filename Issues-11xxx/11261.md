I added a small patch, that makes PolyBoRi compatible with upcoming M4RI release: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/polybori-0.7.1.p1.spkg

It also fixed the issue that the while site-packages directory was recompiled.
(Both backported from upcoming PolyBoRi 0.8.)

Probably not the proper place to report this but I have tried to compile polybori against m4ri-20100817 and it doesn't work:

Anyway in most case sage -b will suffice, sage -ba if you want to be sure for the one with real widespread use (pari for example). One thing that sage -b(a) doesn't do is rebuild dependent packages I think. So if update numpy I should also rebuild scipy. If I am not mistaken sage -b(a) won't do that for you.\n\nIf your comment was aimed at the problems I mentioned I have in sage-on-gentoo on macos, don't worry that's irrelevant to the present issue.

Replying to [AlexanderDreyer](#comment%3A17):
> I have often several times that installing one package breaks some completely unrelated tests, while replacing the spkg and building all Sage from scratch works fine. Does `sage -ba` always suffice?


You are not entirely coherent there. Anyway in most case sage -b will suffice, sage -ba if you want to be sure for the one with real widespread use (pari for example). One thing that sage -b(a) doesn't do is rebuild dependent packages I think. So if update numpy I should also rebuild scipy. If I am not mistaken sage -b(a) won't do that for you.

If your comment was aimed at the problems I mentioned I have in sage-on-gentoo on macos, don't worry that's irrelevant to the present issue. Just expect me to mention it on bitbucket.
