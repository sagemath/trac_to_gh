There was a small bugfix release of PolyBoRi.

Perhaps we can revert #11019.

I added a small patch, that makes PolyBoRi compatible with upcoming M4RI release: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/polybori-0.7.1.p1.spkg

It also fixed the issue that the while site-packages directory was recompiled.
(Both backported from upcoming PolyBoRi 0.8.)

Probably not the proper place to report this but I have tried to compile polybori against m4ri-20100817 and it doesn't work:

I should do some test on vanilla sage but I shamelessly decided to skip 0.7 altogether in favor of that one for sage-on-gentoo for sage-4.7 and over. Works a treat on x86 and amd64. Still an annoying problem on macos that is not mirrored in the vanilla version for some reason.

You are not entirely coherent there. Anyway in most case sage -b will suffice, sage -ba if you want to be sure for the one with real widespread use (pari for example).
