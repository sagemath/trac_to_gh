When creating several layers that interpolate between two surfaces, only one layer is output when accumulating the layers via a loop.  No problem if the layers are explicitly coded.

In the looped version, it appears that the plot3d commands are only executed at show() time and therefore only use the final value of the loop parameter.  All of the layers are created on top of each other at that final parameter value.

This works:

P += plot3d(lambda x,y: H(x,y,tiers[2]/10),(x,-1,1),(y,-1,1),opacity=0.2)

P += plot3d(lambda x,y: H(x,y,tiers[5]/10),(x,-1,1),(y,-1,1),opacity=0.2)

P += plot3d(lambda x,y: H(x,y,tiers[8]/10),(x,-1,1),(y,-1,1),opacity=0.2)

show(P)

This does not:

for r in ratios:

    P += plot3d(lambda x,y: H(x,y,r),(x,-1,1),(y,-1,1),opacity=0.2)  # layer

show(P)

Example worksheet is attached.
