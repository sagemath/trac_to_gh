After trying to build Sage with gcc 4.6.0 on OpenSolaris, I find it fails when building Singular, despite Singular (and all of Sage) builds with gcc-4.5.0.  The same issue occurs on various other systems.

```

A full log is attached. 

A revised package, which reduces the optimisation level, which at least allows this to build on OpenSolaris may be found at 

New spkg, based on #9497: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/singular-3-1-1-4.p8.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/singular-3-1-1-4.p8.spkg)

This needs further testing on other platforms. 

Other problems related to gcc 4.6.0 can be found on #11216

I've set the component to "solaris" as that is the only confirmed system on which this fails to build. Can someone change the component to "build" if this fails on Linux or OS X.

Thank you. 

Burcin has already reported it on the mailing list, but there has been no response from any developers. Having it submitted to the bug database, as you have done, can only be a good thing. 

I've updated this to 'critical' as I think it's a pretty important bug to solve. Not that the priories seem to mean very much - e.g. #9739 has been opened for 8 months and has been a blocker for 5 months.

With gcc 4.5.0 the same version builds ok on the same computer, so it does appear to be an issue with gcc 4.6.0.

I would suggest it would be worth trying to build this with Sun Studio (which is a free download)

 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solarisstudio/downloads/index.html

on a Linux system. The Sun (Oracle) compiler is much stricter than the GNU compilers, so will show up problems that current versions of GCC may not. It goes without saying this will not build with Sun Studio. (I tried this on a Solaris system, but you should get the same on a Linux machine).

Reduced optimisation probably solves the problem. Changing to -O2 allows Singular to build with gcc 4.6.0 on at least OpenSolaris, but I have not yet verified if the doctests pass. I will start a fresh build of Sage, then run all the long doctests. 

If one looks in spkg-install, one find that compiling at -O3 has caused problems in the past, so on one platform -O0 is used. 

So I suspect this is solved. I've placed a package at 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/singular-3-1-1-4.p5.spkg

We will need to verify if this builds and passes the tests properly on Linux, OS X, Solaris 10 (both x86 and SPARC) with gcc 4.6.0 before I will mark this for review. For now I'm setting to "needs info"

Dave 

PS.

I reported about an hour ago to the Singular developers that I believe they are using reserved words in Singular too (http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/333).

Agreed. 

>  IMHO it can *never* be "the right solution".  It means that either the compiler or the code has a bug.  Maybe dropping the optimization to `-O2` covers up any issues, but I think one should really investigate what the true problem is.



Well, a lot of the code in Sage is very difficult to navigate. Sage developers did not write it. Much is incomprehensible. Most gives a lot of compiler warnings. Sorting out if a gcc bug or a bug in the code is difficult. Then if it is a bug in the code, finding where is often very very difficult. One could spend ages on it.

Given this code has caused many issues on many platforms with optimization issues, then I think not increasing it is worthwhile. It should also be realised that -O3 does not necessarily run faster than -O2. The higher optimization level invokes more speculative optimisations, which may cause the code to run slower. See this point from a GCC developer.

http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-help/2010-07/msg00190.html

*The -O3 optoin should be safe for correct code. An important difference between -O2/-O3 and -O1 is that -O2 and -O3 enable strict aliasing and strict overflow. Those options provide better optimization for correct code, but are far more likely to cause unexpected code generation for incorrect code. See the -fstrict-aliasing and -fstrict-overflow options.*

*The main difference between -O3 and -O2 is that -O3 enables more speculative optimizations. These should not miscompile your code, but they may cause your program to run more slowly. *

---

So in summary
* The upstream developers use -O2
* Both -O2 and -O3 can cause problems with bad code. 
* -O3 can be slower than -O2
* Previous attempts to use -O3 have caused problems on numerous platforms
  * Fedora
  * OpenSUSE on Itanium
  * gcc on any platform
* Just for good measure, the code can't be compiled with the Sun compiler, as it has hard-coded uses gcc-specific flags, so we can't even get a second opinion about doggy lines of code. 
* Finding whether it's a gcc bug or a bug in Singular would take quite a bit of effort, and IMHO would be better spent elsewhere. 

There seems to be little appetite among the Sage community for investigating (and possibly fixing) the **thousands** of compiler warnings - some of which look potentially serious to me. To me at least, permitting -O3 on code which has caused numerous issues in the past is unwise.

Of course, I meant a solution for now (let's call this workaround).

I also wanted to point out, that upstream Singular uses different optimization levels for different parts of the system. Some parts are actually compiled with -O3 (not the one which causes problems). 
So I had wanted to suggest, that the spkg should not increase the optimization level over the levels, respectively, intended by the upstream developers. (It's known that -O3 sometimes yields performance issues.)

For some reason the Sage-package forces a unified optimization setting for all parts of Singular. Avoiding this would be the best of course.

BTW: I'm pretty sure, the issue is a compiler bug: It complies without problems, but the linker looks for a (C++) function, whose mangled name doesn't fit what the linker expects.

I will make it less strong, but I feel it needs to be a bit stronger than just mention gcc 4.6.0. 

How about

It's not unreasonable, but a lot of fuzz about nothing.  What do you think of the following comment from my spkg:

```
# By default, parts of Singular are compiled with -O2 and parts
# with -O3.  If we do set any CFLAGS, this always overrides the
# default CFLAGS set by upstream.  In order to be compatible, we
# set the optimization to -O2.
```
I think it's most important to explain **why** we use `-O2`.  Since there is a good reason to use `-O2`, of course one should not randomly increase the `-O` level.

But my point is that this package does appear to have had the optimisation randomly increased several times, which for Singular is a particularly bad idea, as it has caused numerous problems. Your wording gives no hint of the dangers. We are not being compatible for the sake of it - we are doing so as it is dangerous to do otherwise.
