Originally, this ticket was about the following memory leak when computing with elliptic curves:

```
sage: K = GF(1<<55,'t')
sage: a = K.random_element()
sage: while 1:
....:     E = EllipticCurve(j=a); P = E.random_point(); 2*P; 
```
This example is in fact solved by #715. However, while working on that ticket, another leak has been found, namely

```
sage: for p in prime_range(10^5):
....:     K = GF(p)
....:     a = K(0)
....:     
sage: import gc
sage: gc.collect()
0
```
So, I suggest to start with #715 and solve the second memory leak on top of it. It seems that a strong cache for homsets is to blame. I suggest to use the weak `TripleDict` instead, which were introduced in #715.

After looking at #10548, I might have a better idea of the culprit:

```
sage: import gc
sage: from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_finite_field import EllipticCurve_finite_field
sage: K = GF(1<<60,'t')
sage: j = K.random_element()
sage: for i in xrange(100):
....:     E = EllipticCurve(j=j); P = E.random_point(); 2*P;
....:     
sage: gc.collect()
440
sage: len([x for x in gc.get_objects() if  isinstance(x,EllipticCurve_finite_field)])
100
```

This is definitely #715.

Resetting the coercion cache and calling gc.collect() deletes the cached elements.

I guess weak refs should be used in the different TripleDict objects of CoercionModel_cache_maps.

So this should be closed as duplicate/won't fix.

As far as I'm concerned, this is nothing but a concrete example of the vague #715.
So I guess I put it to "needs review" so that it could be closed as "duplicate/won't fix".
Not sure it was the right way to do it.

I seem to remember that I had some workarounds to delete some parts of the cache (so that I could perform my computations), but not all of them.
In fact there are several dictionnaries hidden in different places.
It was quite a while ago, but I'll have another look at it at some point.
Anyway, using weak references for all these dictionnaries seems to be a quite non trivial task.
Moreover it should also not slow things down too much to be viable...

for the computations I need to perform, which need to create about 200000 prime fields, this
memory leak makes it impossible to perform it with Sage, which eats all the available memory.

I would be satisfied if I had a magic command to type to explicitly free the memory used by
every `k=GF(p)`.

I'm having a look at your problem right now. Here are some hints to study the problem, mostly stolen from [#10548](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/search/opensearch?q=ticket%3A10548).

I put it here for the record, and so that i can go faster next time.

First, if I only create the finite fields and do nothing with them, I do not seem to get a memleak. Some fields are not garbage collected immediately, but calling gc.collect() does the trick.

```
sage: import gc
sage: for p in prime_range(10**5):
....:    k = GF(p)
....:
sage: del p, k
sage: gc.collect()
1265
sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_prime_modn import FiniteField_prime_modn as FF
sage: L = [x for x in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(x, FF)]
sage: len(L)
1
sage: L
[Finite Field of size 2]

```
Of course I guess you actually do something with your finite fields.

So here is a small example causing the fields to stay cached.

```
sage: import gc
sage: for p in prime_range(10**5):
....:    k = GF(p)
....:
sage: del p, k
sage: gc.collect()
0

```
The zero here is bad and indeed

```
sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_prime_modn import FiniteField_prime_modn as FF
sage: L = [x for x in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(x, FF)]
sage: len(L)
9592 

```
If you want to know where it comes from you can use the objgraph python module (on my debian I just installed the python-objgraph package, updated sys.path in Sage to include '/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages')

```
sage: sys.path.append('/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages')
sage: import inspect, objgraph
sage: objgraph.show_backrefs(L[-1],filename='/home/jp/br.png',extra_ignore=[id(L)])

```
And look at the png or use

```
sage: brc = objgraph.find_backref_chain(L[-1],inspect.ismodule,max_depth=15,extra_ignore=[id(L)])
sage: map(type,brc)
[<type 'module'>, <type 'dict'>, <type 'dict'>,...
sage: brc[0]
<module 'sage.categories.homset'...

```
So the culprit is "_cache" in sage.categories.homset which has a direct reference to the finite fields in its keys.

The clean solution woul be to used weakref in the keys (let's say something as WeakKeyDirectory in python).

However, resetting cache should be a (potentially partial) workaround (and could kill your Sage?).

```
sage: sage.categories.homset.cache = {}
sage: gc.collect()
376595

```
It also seems to be enough if I do "a = k.random_element(); a = a+a" in the for loop, but not if I add "a = 47*a+3".

I'm currently investigating that last case.

First, the second example above is missing the line "k(1);" in the for loop, otherwise it does nothing more than the first example.

Second, I guess the remaining references to the finite fields are in the different lists and dictionnaries of the integer ring named _coerce_from_list, _convert_from_list etc.

You can not directly access them from Python level, but there a function _introspect_coerce() (defined in parent.pyx) which returns them.

In fact, everything is in _*_hash.

And to conclude, I'd say that right now you can not directly delete entries in this dictionaries from the Python level.

So for minimum changes, you should eitheir avoid coercion, or make the dictionaries "cdef public" in parent.pxd to be able to explicitely delete every created entries (be aware that it could be written in different places for example in ZZ but also in QQ and CC and I don't know where...).

And I could also have missed other dictionaries used by Sage.

Did you "apt-get install python-objgraph" on your system?

If yes, is it a version for python 2.6 ?

<a id='comment:20'></a>
I think we have a different problem here.

The finite fields themselves should be cached. The cache (see `GF._cache`) uses weak references, which should be fine.

Also, there are special methods `zero_element` and `one_element` which should do caching, because zero and one are frequently used and should not be created over and over again.

However, it seems that *all* elements of a finite field are cached - and that's bad!

```
sage: K = GF(5)
sage: K(2) is K(2)
True
sage: K.<a> = GF(17^2)
sage: K(5) is K(5)
True
```

I see absolutely no reason why all `17^2` elements should be cached.

Fortunately, we have no caching for larger finite fields:

```
sage: K.<a> = GF(17^10)
sage: K(5) is K(5)
False
```

In the following example, there is no memory leak that would be caused by the `sage.categories.homset` cache:

```
sage: len(sage.categories.homset._cache.keys())
100
sage: for p in prime_range(10^5):
....:     K = GF(p)
....:     
sage: len(sage.categories.homset._cache.keys())
100
```

However, when you do a conversion `K(...)` then a convert map is created, and apparently is cached:

```
sage: for p in prime_range(10^5):
....:     K = GF(p)
....:     a = K(0)
....:
sage: len(sage.categories.homset._cache.keys())
9692
```

The homset cache does use weak references. Hence, it is surprising that the unused stuff can not be garbage collected. Apparently there is some direct reference involved at some point.

I am very stronglyagainst removing the cache of `sage.categories.homset`. Namely, elliptic curve code uses finite fields and maps involving finite fields *a lot*, and killing the cache is likely to cause a massive regression.

However, since we actually have coercion maps (not just any odd map), I expect that the direct reference comes from the coercion model. I suggest to look into the coercion code and use weak references there.

By the way, I don't know why the status is "needs review". I think it clearly is "needs work".

On the other hand, it could be that using weak keys in the homset cache will not work: The keys are triples: domain, codomain and category.

What we want is: If either the domain or the codomain or the category have no strong reference, then the homset can be garbage collected.

Hence: Why don't we use a dictionary of dictionaries of dictionaries?

What I mean is:

* The keys of sage.categories.homset._cache should be weak references to the domain
* The values of sage.categories.homset._cache should be dictionaries whose keys are weak references to the codomain.
* The keys of these dictionaries should be weak references to the category, and the value a weak reference to the homset.

Hence, if there is no strong reference to either domain or codomain or category, then the homset can be deallocated.

The idea sketched in the previous comment seems to work!!!

With it, after running

```
sage: for p in prime_range(10^5):
....:     K = GF(p)
....:     a = K(0)
....:     print get_memory_usage()
```
ends with printing 825.45703125

Without it, it ends with printing 902.8125

I don't know if we should ban caching of field elements?

How could fixing that memory leak be demonstrated by a doc test?

Anyway, I will post a preliminary patch in a few minutes (so that you can see if it fixes at least part of the problem for you), while I am running `sage -tp 2 devel/sage`.

That said: I am not working on top of vanilla sage, but I use some patches. In particular, I use #11900, which introduces so called `Category_singleton`, which has a specialised and very fast containment test.

I would not like to change #11900, but prefer to change my patch from here so that it works on top of #11900.

Cc to Nicolas, since it concerns categories:

Do we want that `Hom(1,1)` is still supported?

I think it does not make sense at all to talk about the homomorphisms of the number 1 to the number 1. The problem (for my patch as it is posted here) is the fact that one can't create a weak reference to the number 1.

At least one of the errors in polynomial rings is due to a wrong order of initialising things: There is some information missing, and by consequence a weak reference can't be created.

I fixed this problem in the new patch version.

I put it as "needs info", because of my question on whether or not we want to consider an integer as object in a category.

I was told by Mike Hansen why weak references to integers and rationals do not work.

I see three options:

#. Drop the support for `Hom(1,1)` (which I'd prefer)
#. Add a cdef'd attribute `__weakref__` to `sage.structure.element.Element`, which would create an overhead for garbage collection for elements, and also a memory overhead.
#. Use two category.homset caches in parallel: One (the default) that uses weak references, and another one that uses "normal" references if weak references fail.

FWIW:

With the latest patch, the tests in polynomial_singular_interface and in multi_polynomial_ring pass.

There remain the following problems:

So, essentially this is just a single test that comes in two versions and is repeated three times - and I would actually say that *not* raising an error was a bug.

It seems that `Hom(1/2,2/3)` and similar nonsense is not used in Sage. Hence, I think these tests should be removed. I'll ask sage-devel.

Without the patch:

```
sage: def test():
....:     for p in prime_range(10^5):
....:         K = GF(p)
....:         a = K(0)
....:         
sage: m0 = get_memory_usage()
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 7.75 s, sys: 0.08 s, total: 7.83 s
Wall time: 7.84 s
sage: get_memory_usage() - m0
80.234375
```

With the patch:

```
sage: def test():
....:     for p in prime_range(10^5):
....:         K = GF(p)
....:         a = K(0)
....:         
sage: m0 = get_memory_usage()
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 7.59 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 7.60 s
Wall time: 7.61 s
sage: get_memory_usage() - m0
8.53515625
```

So, the memory does mildly increase, but it seems that most of the leak is fixed.

I think that a test of the kind

```
sage: get_memory_usage() - -m0 < 10
True
```
might be used as a doc test.

Yes, that looks good. With my patch, the test would be like

```
sage: for p in prime_range(10^5):
....:     K = GF(p)
....:     a = K(0)
....:     
sage: import gc
sage: gc.collect()
1881                                                                                                     
sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_prime_modn import FiniteField_prime_modn as FF           
sage: L = [x for x in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(x, FF)]
sage: len(L), L[0], L[len(L)-1]
(2, Finite Field of size 2, Finite Field of size 99991)
```

The people at sage-devel somehow seem to agree that objects of a category should be instances of `CategoryObject` (which elements aren't!), and that we should thus drop the `Hom(2/3,8/1)` test.

In addition to that, I suggest to provide a better error message, something like

I think I need help with debugging.

When I have sage-4.8.alpha3 with #9138, #11900, #715 and #11115, then all doctests pass.

When I also have #11521, then the test sage/rings/number_field/number_field_rel.py segfaults. When I run the tests in verbose mode, then all tests seem to pass, but in the very end it says

```
4 items had no tests:
    __main__
    __main__.change_warning_output
    __main__.check_with_tolerance
    __main__.warning_function
69 items passed all tests:
...
660 tests in 73 items.
660 passed and 0 failed.
Test passed.
The doctested process was killed by signal 11
         [15.0 s]
```
So, could it be that not one of the tests was killed, but the test *process* itself?

What is even more confusing: When I run the tests with the option -randorder, then most of the time the tests pass without a problem.

Can you give me any pointer on how those things could possibly be debugged?

Dear Simon,

Thanks a lot for taking care of all of this !

I'm just back from vacation and will have a look at all your patches in the following days.


I must point out that even if the memory leak was small, it did still mater because I used a LOT of them and after several hours of computations it ate all the available memory the piece of code in the ticket description is just a minimal example, in my actual code I used different curves and similar simple computations on them)...

And to make things clear, I must say I put that ticket as need review in order to get it closed as wont fix/duplicate because I thought it could be seen as a concrete example of ticket [ticket:715] and all the work could be done there.

Of course youre the one currently doing all the wok, so do as you want :)

Cheers,

JP

Hi Jean-Pierre,

Replying to [jpflori](#comment%3A51):
> I must point out that even if the memory leak was small, 


It isn't small.

> And to make things clear, I must say I put that ticket as need review in order to get it closed as wont fix/duplicate because I thought it could be seen as a concrete example of ticket [ticket:715] and all the work could be done there.


I am not sure whether it would be good to do everything on one ticket, as the topics are related, but clearly disting: #715 is about weak "`TripleDict`" for coercion, #12215 is about a weak version of cached_function, and the ticket here is about the cache of homsets.

On the other hand: I am about to post a new patch here, with #715 as a dependency. It will use the new version of `TripleDict` from #715. So, one could argue that there is a common tool for both tickets, and they belong together.

Anyway. The new patch will fix the leak, but it will not suffer from the segfaults.

Cheers,

Simon

I have attached another patch under a new name, using a new approach: The weak `TripleDict`, that I introduce at #715, is an appropriate tool for the cache of homsets. The key is the triple `(domain, codomain, category)`, and the value is a weak reference to the corresponding homset.

There is a new test (the same as in the other patch), showing that the leak is fixed. And all tests in sage/schemes, sage/rings, sage/categories and sage/structure pass.

Hence: Needs review!

Apply trac11521_triple_homset.patch

It depends on what you call "the" leak.

At least, the patch fixes *one* leak, namely the one that is doctested against. I am not sure whether it is enough to fix the leak exposed in the ticket description:

```
sage: K = GF(1<<55,'t')
sage: a = K.random_element()
sage: get_memory_usage()
872.26171875
sage: while 1:
....:     E = EllipticCurve(j=a)
....:     P = E.random_point()
....:     Q = 2*P;
....:     print get_memory_usage()
```
The memory usage does climb, but it climbs a lot slower than, for example, in sage-4.6.2.

```
sage: from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_finite_field import EllipticCurve_finite_field

LF shows that one leak is fixed. However, the curves in LE, which are all defined over the same finite field, can not be collected.

My 2 cents: Isn't it somehow related to the fact that elliptic curves are not unique parents?
In some of my original tests, I used different curves and depending on the cache where they were stored "equality" testing was made either with "is" or with "==".
In the former case, the "same" elliptic curve would be stored several times making the "leak" even bigger.

I think we can go your way and stop working on this ticket now (or rather once I've taken the time to go through your patches to properly review them).
Thus we can already some non negligible improvements merged.

Anyway the problem of uniqueness of elliptic curve is highly non trivial and deserves its own ticket.
I guess #11474 would be a right place to treat that problem.
An alternative would be to make this ticket depend on #11474.

Hi Jean-Pierre,

indeed, you found the correct ticket.

And there is no need to ask on sage-nt, since I already did before opening #11474: [Sage-nt](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-nt/browse_thread/thread/ec8d0ad14a819082/049bfad6fd0680d1) first seemed to agree that uniqueness is good, so I opened the ticket. But then, they became convinced that much of the elliptic curve stuff depends on choices (generators), so that we should consider elliptic curves to be mutable objects, for which we wouldn't like to have uniqueness.

Considering the discussion on sage-nt, #11474 probably is "wontfix".

I am not sure whether we should really stop work right there. After all, it is still not 100% clear to me why the elliptic curve E, that is created in the loop in an increasing number of copies, can not be garbage collected.

First, E is created, and some coercion into it is created. The coercion is cached. By #715, some key of the cache provides a weak reference to E. In addition, the coerce map refers to a homset, and the homset refers to its codomain, which is E. I wonder whether there is a chain of strong references from E to the homset (one could try to find out using objgraph, I guess). If there is, then we would have a reference cycle. If that was the case, then we needed to find a `__del__` method that prevents the cycle from being garbage collected.

Hi Jean-Pierre,

The thing with the _action_hash is a good finding. I thought it would be a `TripleDict`, but it is just a usual dict. And this could indeed be a problem. I don't know if this is visible to objgraph.

But also I think that in addition we have the problem of strong references to the values of `TripleDict`. In principle, one could use weak references for not only the keys but also to the values -- perhaps this could be done in #715.

Or one could leave `TripleDict` as it is currently in #715, but explicitly use weak references to functors for coercion (which needs to be enabled first). _action_hash then has to use weak references as well.

There might be a speed problem, though.

For info, resetting ZZ._action_hash to {} is not sufficient to let the IntegerMulAction be garbage collected.

Objgraph shows 3 objects pointing to the abelian group of points of the curve (itself pointing to the curve):
- the IntegerMulAction
- the point at infinity (?)
- a dict of size 11 which is in fact an attribute (_Scheme__ring_point_homset) of the curve (as a scheme) itself.

I'd be happy to test a weakref for values version of your patch regardless of the spedd impact.

I guess you're solution should be the right one because resetting the coercion cache solves the problem, so dealing with it should be enough for the example in the ticket description.

Only one copy gets cached in _action_hash because the curves are equal (==) but not identical (is). However, if one uses (really) different curves, one of each gets also cached in _action_hash

Here is  small piece of code to test the effect of clearing different caches (the code to clear the ZZ cache is left as an exercise, anyway we should use weakrefs there):

Don't forget the last copy of E that was defined in the loop!

Since I think that a weak reference to the values of `TripleDict` won't work: What else could one do? Or perhaps I should try again: It could be that the errors came from the wrong choice of a callback function.

In the new code I posted I explicitely added "del P; del E;" to the loop so no copy should be left.
What's even stranger is that this remaining copy appears after the second loop (with random j invariants so different curves) but not after the first one (with constant j invariant so only one curve)!
>Since I think that a weak reference to the values of `TripleDict` won't work: What else could one do? Or perhaps I should try again: It could be that the errors came from the wrong choice of a callback function.

Mmm, have to think more about all of that...

I think I should describe the problem in more detail.

Currently,

* There is a strong reference from `__main__` to the action and coercion caches that are stored in the coercion model. That's fine.
* Parents store actions as well. Some of these parents (the integer ring, for example) will always stay in memory.
* There is a strong reference from any action and homset back to domain and codomain, which are used as keys in the cache. I think that's fine: If a homset is alive then its domain and codomain must remain alive as well.
* The action and coercion caches have a strong reference to the values.
* There is no direct reference from domain and codomain to the homset.

Hence, if an action is stored in the action cache, then there will always be a chain of strong references from `__main__` via the cache to the action, and further to domain and codomain, so that it can not be collected.

On the other hand, if weak references to the values of the action and coercion caches are used, then an action or a coercion could die even when domain and codomain were still alive. That's probably not good. To the very least, it would imply that actions would be needed to be re-created over and over again.

How could that be solved?

If I understand correctly, the keys to all these dictionaries are triples and what you've done is that ift elements in that triple are weakrefs to non strongly refed objects, the key-value pair gets deleted so that garbage collection occur for these only weakrefed objects?

Therefore, if ZZ._action_hash gets deleted, only weakrefs to the abelian groups of points of the curve should be left in the coercion model (in the second triple dict _action_maps) and it should not prevent garbage collection...

I guess you're right.

Here is a piece of code emphasizing the problem.

```
sage: K = GF(1<<60, 't')
sage: a = K.random_element()
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1, 0, 0, 0, a])
sage: P = E.random_point()
sage: 2*P
...
sage: ZZ._introspect_coerce()['_action_hash']
{(<type 'list'>, ...} # No Abelian group of points of the curve!!!
sage: get_coercion_model().get_cache()[1]
{(Integer Ring, Abelian group of points on Elliptic Curve defined by ..., <built-in function mul>): <weakref at ...; dead>, ...} # the "dead" are bad

```

Yes, and note that we have two locations for storing the actions:

* in the coercion model
* in the attribute `_action_hash` of parents.

I found that having weak references in the coercion model is enough for fixing the leak - even if one has strong references in `_action_hash`. That is something I don't fully understand.

I was thinking of that, too. However, in addition to `_action_hash`, the parent also has a `_action_list`. And that might be a bigger problem.

As I posted above in ZZ._action_hash equality is tested with "==" (rather than identity with "is") so in the code of the ticket description where only "one" curve is used, only one curve gets stored in _action_hash.
If you try the code posted some comments above where (really) different curves are used, you'll see that the leak is not fixed if you dont use a similar approach for _action_hash as for the coercion model.

The weakref domain and codomain in functors problem could be tackled by adding an optional parameter for the use of weakref.

By default, the behavior of functors would be as before with strong refs (and the option to false).

For the coercion models we would set the option to True and use weakref whenever possible.

Yes, but then I don't understand why there is no error: In some places, the coercion model tests for identity, and raises a big fat "coercion BUG" otherwise.

Again, I believe that it must not be up to the user: "Evidently" (for a human), the different copies of E in the while loop can be garbage collected. It is our job to hammer the "evidence" into Sage. We shouldn't simply say "let the user decide" whether he wants a leak or a potential disaster: I would call it a disaster if one has an action and suddenly its codomain is gone.

I'll have a look at it, I'm not completely up to what the coercion model actually does :)
I guess the doc could also be extended on that :)

That would not really be up to the user if by default the functor does not use weakref, but if we change this behavior for the coercion model by switching the option. 
It would be fatly documented not to set the option to True for general use, so normal use would not lead to problems.
Of course it all depends on what you mean by "up to the user".
One could still intentionally set the option to true, and then cry that its codomain disappeared...

The old `TripleDict` didn't - I changed that only in #715. Perhaps it is debatable whether that change is fine. But:

> What do yo think? Have you any good reason to justify such a choice that I might have missed?


See sage/structure/coerce.pyx:

```
            if y_mor is not None:
                all.append("Coercion on right operand via")
                all.append(y_mor)
                if res is not None and res is not y_mor.codomain():
                    raise RuntimeError, ("BUG in coercion model: codomains not equal!", x_mor, y_mor)
```

That is why I think one should test for identity, not equality.

On the other hand, we also have

```
        # Make sure the domains are correct
        if R_map.domain() is not R:
            if fix:
                connecting = R_map.domain().coerce_map_from(R)
                if connecting is not None:
                    R_map = R_map * connecting
            if R_map.domain() is not R:
                raise RuntimeError, ("BUG in coercion model, left domain must be original parent", R, R_map)
        if S_map is not None and S_map.domain() is not S:
            if fix:
                connecting = S_map.domain().coerce_map_from(S)
                if connecting is not None:
                    S_map = S_map * connecting
            if S_map.domain() is not S:
                raise RuntimeError, ("BUG in coercion model, right domain must be original parent", S, S_map)
```
in the same file. These lines apparently cope with the fact that there are non-unique parents, and they suggest that `==` is the right thing to do in the coerce caches.

But I think this is a discussion that belongs to #715.

I agree to move the discussion for "==" and "is" to #715 (and also agree with your solution).

So, what about the original problem here and your thoughts about moving the weakref from the action itself to its domains and codomains?

If you really dislike the idea of having an option switched off by default (and a priori only on in the coercion model and not outside it unless one knows what he is doing), we could mimick what you wanna do with the TripleDict and have the usual Functor and a Functor_weakref version (or you can go the other way around and add an extra arg to the TripleDict constructor taking the equality operator as argument :) rather than having two classes)?

Interestingly, the experimental patch for #715 that I have not submitted yet (need more tests) seems to be almost enough to fix the memory leak from the ticket description!

Namely:

```
sage: <the usual loop>
Traceback
...
KeyboardInterrupt: 
sage: import gc
sage: gc.collect()
585
sage: from sage.schemes.generic.homset import SchemeHomsetModule_abelian_variety_coordinates_field
sage: LE = [x for x in gc.get_objects() if  isinstance(x,SchemeHomsetModule_abelian_variety_coordinates_field)]
sage: len(LE)
2
```

And the experimental patch is *not* using weak references to the values of the `TripleDict` - only to the keys! Perhaps this ticket will eventually be a duplicate of #715?

Anyway, I need more tests and will probably submit the patch to #715 later today.

If you used "==" for equality testing for actions in the coercion model (as in the parent caches) and let "j=j" in the "usual piece of code", this is not surprising because for "==" all the curves are equal, so there will be no duplication nor memory leak.

To perform a better test, you should replace j=j by j=K.random_element() in the constructor of the elliptic curve (as I did a few tickets up) to get really different curves (i.e. for "is" and for "==").
I fear the memory leak is still there with this second example...

I see. And I also found that I was originally responsible for not making it a duplicate.

The reason was that I found another leak: It is the strong cache for the homsets, and that is not addressed in #715.

So (question to the release manager), what shall we do? Mark this as a duplicate and open a different ticket for the cache of homsets? Or change the ticket description such that it is only about homsets, not about elliptic curves?

before tagging that ticket as a duplicate of #715, I'd like to check the leak is indeed
fixed with the (upcoming) patch of #715.

It turns out that the failing test had in fact a wrong design. It was:

```
            sage: import gc
            sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular import MPolynomialRing_libsingular
            sage: from sage.libs.singular.ring import ring_refcount_dict
            sage: n = len(ring_refcount_dict)
            sage: R = MPolynomialRing_libsingular(GF(547), 2, ('x', 'y'), TermOrder('degrevlex', 2))
            sage: len(ring_refcount_dict) == n + 1
            True

            sage: Q = copy(R)   # indirect doctest
            sage: p = R.gen(0) ^2+R.gen(1)^2
            sage: q = copy(p)
            sage: del R
            sage: del Q
            sage: del p
            sage: del q
            sage: gc.collect() # random output
            sage: len(ring_refcount_dict) == n   
            True
```

Hence, before n is defined, no garbage collection takes place. This is, of course, not correct: The ring_refcount_dict may contain references to a ring created in another doctest, that is only garbage collected in the line before `len(ring_refcount_dict)==n`.

In other words: The test did not fail *because* there was a memory leak.

When I insert a garbage collection right before the definition of n, the test works, and in addition the warning about `AttributeError` being ignored vanishes.

The patch fixes the memory leak caused by a strong homset cache (which was not addressed by #715):

```
sage: for p in prime_range(10^3):
....:     K = GF(p)
....:     a = K(0)
....:     
sage: import gc
sage: gc.collect()
3128
sage: LE = [x for x in gc.get_objects() if  isinstance(x,type(K))]
sage: LE
[Finite Field of size 2, Finite Field of size 997]
```
The patch adds a new doctest demonstrating that it is fixed.

Needs review!

When applying the new patch from #715, all tests pass. But when also applying the patch from here, `make ptest` results in

```
sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/libs/singular/ring.pyx # 6 doctests failed
```

The failing tests concern `ring_refcount_dict` - and it is perhaps not surprising that a patch enabling garbage collection of rings has an influence on refcount, such as:

```
   sage: ring_ptr = set(ring_refcount_dict.keys()).difference(prev_rings).pop()
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/simon/SAGE/sage-5.0.prealpha0/local/bin/ncadoctest.py", line 1231, in run_one_test

        compileflags, 1) in test.globs
      File "<doctest __main__.example_8[9]>", line 1, in <module>
        ring_ptr = set(ring_refcount_dict.keys()).difference(prev_rings).pop()###line 452:
    sage: ring_ptr = set(ring_refcount_dict.keys()).difference(prev_rings).pop()
    KeyError: 'pop from an empty set'
```

Anyway, I need to analyse what happens, and provide a new patch after catching some sleep.

Jean-Pierre, I hope you like the new ticket title!

Ive look at the patch and has nothing to say except for weakref being imported twice, I'll provided a reviewer patch for that.

Ha, maybe we should mention the caching system in the doc as well, I'm ready to do that in a reviewer patch as well.

However, I'll wait for #715 to be closed before positive reviewing this one, just in case the changes there have consequences here (which should not be the case).

While finally looking at this ticket seriously and adding some doc, I remarked that if you run

```
sage: V = VectorSpace(QQ,3)
sage: H = Hom(V,V)
sage: H is Hom(V,V)
False

```
With this tickets patches but also WITHOUT them.

Is this a consequence of #9138 ?

What's strange is that V does not break the unique parent assumption:

```
sage: V is VectorSpace(QQ, 3)
True

```
Is that intended because there is a ? It does not look very right to me.

The same "problem" occurs playing for example with finite fields...

With more classical stuff, the cache seems to work as intended

```
sage: H = Hom(ZZ, QQ)
sage: H is Hom(ZZ, QQ)
True

```
This last point let me think that we can discuss and fix the VectorSpace situation elsewhere if this is indeed a problem.

My concern here is that it's hard to provide a "smart" example where the hom set is cached and where it can be garbage collected when its domainand codomain are.

Id on't think deleting ZZ and QQ is a good idea :) (and they would be refed elsewhere anyway)

Here is a reviewer patch added a little doc.

I hope you will find it satisfactory.

If so, feel free to set the ticket to positive review, I personnally feel happy with youre code.

My above rant, if it should be addressed, should be elsewhere.

I have created a combined patch, by folding the two patches (i.e., mine and Jean-Pierre's reviewer patch).

With #715 and this patch, all doctests pass on my machine. So, from my perspective, it is a positive review, but we should wait for Jean-Pierre's results on 32 bit.

Unmerged because unmerging #12313 while keeping #11521 gives on OS X 10.6:

```
$ ./sage -t --verbose devel/sage/sage/misc/cachefunc.pyx
[...]
Trying:
    P = QQ['a, b, c, d']; (a, b, c, d,) = P._first_ngens(4)###line 1038:_sage_    >>> P.<a,b,c,d> = QQ[]
Expecting nothing

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.

I think at some point #12969 must be used (which has fixed an error that depends on the order in which tests are executed), so, I made it a dependency. See the list of patches in my previous comment.

What sporadic errors did actually occur, and on what system? I did one test run on bsd.math. Since the errors were sporadic, it might be good to test different variants (serially, parallely, with make test or with sage -pt) and multiple times.

I have run the tests on bsd.math in different ways. There has been no error.

According to old logs of the patch bot,

```
sage -t  -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_number_field.py"
```
used to crash sometimes. I repeated that test about 20 times both on my `OpenSuse` laptop and on bsd.math. Everything was fine.

Hence, I am confident that #12969 is indeed enough to solve the problems that were revealed by the other bunch of patches (#12215, #715, #11521, #12313).

**sage/categories/homset.py**:

```
_cache = TripleDict(53)
```
I guess this 53 is a tuned parameter. Can you comment on the choice?

line 214

```
    try:
        H = _cache[key]()
    except KeyError:
        H = None
    if H:
```
Could it happen that bool(H) is false if H is not None? Perhaps safer to test
`H is not None`? I'm not saying that you should. Just comment please.

line 247 (same thing)

line 263

```
    _cache[key] = weakref.ref(H)
```
Can you clarify the following: The way I read this is that H will not be
protected against GC (good!), but that `_cache` will be be storing a strong(?)
reference to `key`, meaning that the entry in `_cache` under `key` will linger
with a dead weakref afterwards. Shouldn't there be a callback registered here
with the weakref that contacts `_cache` to remove the `key` entry when `H` gets
collected? It may be that your #715 changes already make `_cache` into essentially a
`WeakKeyDict`, but it seems to me that `_cache` should still have a callback
registered on the `weakref` to `H` as well, to remove the entry if `H` gets GCd.

I haven't done extensive testing myself, but you have and the bot happy, so I don't think me running tests would change much.

My patch in #715 is, of course, based on old code. In the old code, there were comments on the choice of the parameter, that I summarise here. The parameter gives the initial number of buckets in a `TripleDict`. Thus, in order to ensure a good distribution of the items into the buckets, the parameter should be prime and should certainly not be even; there actually is a doc test that shows what happens if the parameter is even. It should not be too big, because it determines the number of empty buckets that are created during initialisation of the `TripleDict`. And it should not be too small, because otherwise the `TripleDict` would soon be resized (which is a costly operation).

I thought that 53 is a good choice, given these comments. However, it is not tuned by experiments.

That line is old code that has not been introduced by my patch, right? I think one *should* test `H is not None` - mainly for speed, but also for preventing that bool(H) is false even though H is not None.

Correct, at least theoretically.

The reason for the code was that at some point one needed to break a chain of strong references. In the memory leak fixed here, there was a reference from H back to the keys under which H is stored in the `TripleDict`. Hence, practically, when H gets collected, the item in the `TripleDict` becomes collectable as well. Hence, the dead weakref will soon vanish.

At least, that's what *should* happen. But:

Yes. A `WeakKeyDict`, but not a `WeakValueDict`. That's why I am using a weak reference to H.

Recall that each `TripleDict` has an eraser. I think, at least with the new patch at #715 that I have posted today, such a callback would be easily possible.

> I haven't done extensive testing myself, but you have and the bot happy, so I don't think me running tests would change much.


Well, in an ideal world, a different brain will be able to invent different stress tests, thus, find different bugs...

Anyway. I think I should turn `if H:` into `if H is not None:` and should introduce a callback to the weak reference.

Now I wonder: Why did I explicitly put a weak reference to the category as a key for the `TripleDict`? Would the `TripleDict` not use weak references to *all three* parts of the key?

I think the reason for the "weakref.ref(category)" was that in older versions of `TripleDict` I did indeed not use a weak reference to the third part of the key.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:2'></a>\nAw, this weakref caching stuff is very headache-inducing. My sincere apologies. I'm afraid I have to withdraw my positive review due to a previous failure in my logic. As I see it now, the current patch reduces the caching of coercion maps to near uselessness. The fact that it DOES seem to work to some extent might give a lead to why other things are going wrong. Let me try:\n\nIgnoring the weakref on H for now, the coercion cache here consists of a TripleDict, stored on Y, indexing\n\n```\n(X,Y,C) : H\n```\nor\n\n```\n(X,Y,C): None\n```\nHere `H` is a map from `X` to `Y` wrt to the category `C`, so it stores strong references to `X`,`Y`,`C`. That means that as long as `H` is alive, no component of the key will die, so the fact that this is stored in a `TripleDict` is irrelevant: The value `H` would keep the key alive anyway. The only exception is the value `None`. There the `TripleDict` does exactly what it should.\n\nThis cycle problem is fixed by weakreffing `H`. But the whole point of the cache is to keep `H` alive as long as all of `X`, `Y` and `C` exist, so that we can look it up. Since the normal use for coercion would be to discover the coercion map and forget about it as soon as it has been applied, one would expect the cache to be empty all the time!\n\nI don't immediately see a canonical way to solve this problem. Here are some ideas that may mitigate it:\n\nWe're caching coercions on the codomain, which I think is the right place for the following reason. Long-lived parents such as `ZZ` tend to have a lot of coercions *to* other parents, but very few *from*. As observed above, we are caching the absense of coercions, but those don't involve an `H` that might keep the codomain alive. So, we could cache the absense of coercions in a `TripleDict`. In fact, we could make that a `TripleSet` if we really want.\n\nThe PRESENCE of a coercion should probably be cached with a strong reference to the coercion. That's the point of caching the thing!\nThis should be keyed on `(X,C)` (the `Y` is implied by the cache we're looking in). Storing the key weakly has no effect with the present design of coercion.\n\nThat means that discovering those impose a memory cost on Y. However, usually there tend to not be too many of those (is that true in the p-adics with all those different precisions floating around?

Aw, this weakref caching stuff is very headache-inducing. My sincere apologies. I'm afraid I have to withdraw my positive review due to a previous failure in my logic. As I see it now, the current patch reduces the caching of coercion maps to near uselessness. The fact that it DOES seem to work to some extent might give a lead to why other things are going wrong. Let me try:

Ignoring the weakref on H for now, the coercion cache here consists of a TripleDict, stored on Y, indexing

```
(X,Y,C) : H
```
or

```
(X,Y,C): None
```
Here `H` is a map from `X` to `Y` wrt to the category `C`, so it stores strong references to `X`,`Y`,`C`. That means that as long as `H` is alive, no component of the key will die, so the fact that this is stored in a `TripleDict` is irrelevant: The value `H` would keep the key alive anyway. The only exception is the value `None`. There the `TripleDict` does exactly what it should.

This cycle problem is fixed by weakreffing `H`. But the whole point of the cache is to keep `H` alive as long as all of `X`, `Y` and `C` exist, so that we can look it up. Since the normal use for coercion would be to discover the coercion map and forget about it as soon as it has been applied, one would expect the cache to be empty all the time!

I don't immediately see a canonical way to solve this problem. Here are some ideas that may mitigate it:

We're caching coercions on the codomain, which I think is the right place for the following reason. Long-lived parents such as `ZZ` tend to have a lot of coercions *to* other parents, but very few *from*. As observed above, we are caching the absense of coercions, but those don't involve an `H` that might keep the codomain alive. So, we could cache the absense of coercions in a `TripleDict`. In fact, we could make that a `TripleSet` if we really want.

The PRESENCE of a coercion should probably be cached with a strong reference to the coercion. That's the point of caching the thing!
This should be keyed on `(X,C)` (the `Y` is implied by the cache we're looking in). Storing the key weakly has no effect with the present design of coercion.

That means that discovering those impose a memory cost on Y. However, usually there tend to not be too many of those (is that true in the p-adics with all those different precisions floating around? Still, that should be managable relative to creating all finite fields up to size 10<sup>9</sup> and storing strong references on `ZZ` to them to record the absence of a coercion from them, which I think was the problem in the example that started this ticket)

For permanent objects with coercions *from* lots of objects (like the symbolic ring, real/complex fields, [number fields with declared embeddings], `QQbar` [number fields again]) we have a big problem.

One solution would be to turn off caching for those (which needs infrastructure ... I guess a flag `Y.no_coercion_caching_on_me_please=True`, which needs checking any time you're about to cache something. Or, if that is too drastic, an optional parent method
`Y.is_this_a_coercion_cachable_domain(X)` or`Y.is_this_a_coercion_cachable_domain_type(type(X))`

Another would be to warn people that mixing parents makes the "larger" parent remember the "smaller" one, so if you let lots of "smaller" parent interact with a "larger" one, you'll be using memory for the lifetime of that "larger" one.

The "proper" solutions below would force coercion maps to be different from normal homomorphisms, fit for users. That's because if a user keeps a reference `h` to an element of `Hom(X,Y)`, he/she rightfully expects that to keep `X` and `Y` alive. 

we'd have to weakly key the cache, but still strongly store the coercion map.

The "proper" (but possibly too expensive) option is to not store `X` on coercion maps. If we have `H=Y.coercion_map_from(X)` and `H` is used correctly, then `H(x)` can get access to X via `x.parent()` anyway, so `H` doesn't strictly need a reference to `X`.

So the object we store in the cache could be a map-like object `cH` that doesn't store its domain. Upon calling `Y.coercion_map_from(X)` we could wrap `cH` into a proper `Hom(X,Y)` member that does have a strong reference to X. This might be too expensive for something so fundamental as coercion.

**TL;DR**: Do not store a `KeyedRef` to `H` but store `H` itself in the cache. We won't solve the leak completely, but at least we're not leaking on the *absence* of coercions as we were before.

How eagerly does the system use the `self._convert_from_hash`? It is quite likely that even with #12313 in place,

```python
for p in prime_range(1,1000):

```
would still leak, due to the conversion `GF(p)->ZZ` being cached on `ZZ`.
That would make me believe we should probably not cache conversions. There are too many of them, so it's too easy to let sage discover enough of them that all objects in memory are in one connected component.

For coercion things are a little brighter because objects with lots of inbound arrows (near-universal codomains?) are rarer.

You definitely already had a look at #12313, sorry about that.

Trying to summarize the action of the different coercion patches, here is what I remember:
* in #715, see http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/715#comment:75 and http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/715#comment:86
  * we now store weakref to the set acted upon in Actions.
  * parents use a TripleDict for _action_hash where the Actions they implement are stored with a strong ref.
  * there is another TripleDict _action_maps in the coercion model with a strong ref as well.
  * so if a parent acted upon dies, it will only be weakrefed in the Action itself and in the TripleDicts so that it will get garbage collected with the Action as well, but as long as both of them are alive, there should be no garbage collection.

* but then #11521 comes in because we also have a global cache for homset which prevented parents to die. So only there the tripl dicts store weakrefs to Action to enable gc back again. (just saw you just posted...)

Before #12313, the coercions from X to Y were stored in a strong dictionary in Y, strongly keyed with X. Hence, as long as Y survives, there would be a strong reference to X. But with #12313, a weak dictionary is introduced for that purpose. Hence, even if Y persists and a coercion has been cached from X to Y, X remains collectable.\n\nNow, back to caching `H = Hom(X,Y,category=C)` (H is a set of maps). You are right, having just a weak reference to H sounds like it would be immediately collected. If I recall correctly, my reasoning for introducing the weak reference to H has been as follows:\n\n* Let T be the cache for the Hom function. T is a `TripleDict`. and T is in fact available under sage.categories.homset._cache. Hence, we have a strong permanent reference to T.\n* T provides some buckets, and of course T has strong references to its buckets.\n* With #715, the buckets contain some memory addresses representing the keys, and then strong references to the values.\n\nBy consequence, defining T[X,Y,C]=H means that we have a chain of strong references, starting with T (T is permanent), from T to its buckets, from the buckets to H, and from H to X, Y and C. Hence, X,Y and C will never be garbage collected, even though T itself only has weak references to X,Y and C.\n\nNow, only define T[X,Y,C]=weakref.ref(H) (or any other kind of weak reference to H). Why is H *not* immediately garbage collected, in usual applications?\n\nUsual application means: You will not just create H, but you will also create an element of H, say, phi. We have a strong reference from phi to H, because H is the parent of phi. If you do not store phi, then H remains collectable. But in a usual application, you would store phi, say, because it is a coerce map from X to Y.\n\nBy now, we assume that phi is a coercion, which is cached in Y. To be precise, we have Y._coerce_from_hash[X] = phi.\n\nPrior to #12313, Y._coerce_from_hash is a usual dict. Hence, the existence of Y keeps X, phi and thus H alive.\n\nWith #12313, Y._coerce_from_hash is a `MonoDict`, which only has a weak reference to X. However, Y._coerce_from_hash has a strong reference to its buckets, the buckets have a strong reference to phi, phi has a strong reference to its parent H, and H has a strong reference to X. Hence, we have the reference cycle (with -> weak and => strong references)\n\n```\n* => T -> H\n\n   Y -> X\n   Y => phi => H => X\n               H => Y\n               H => C\n```\n\nIn conclusion, an external reference to Y will keep X alive (which is bad). But if there is no external reference to Y nor to X, then Y,X,H and C remain collectable (assuming that no `__del__` method makes the cyclic garbage collection impossible), which is good enough to fix a memleak.\n\n**__Summary__**\n\n* If H=Hom(X,Y,C) and the homset cache keeps a strong reference to H, then H, X, Y and C will never be collectable. That's why I introduce the weak reference, strange as it may look.\n* If H=Hom(X,Y,C) is created as the parent of a coercion or conversion map phi, which is stored in Y._coerce_from_cache, then:\n   - An external strong reference to Y keeps phi, thus H, thus X and C alive (*).\n   - An external strong reference to X does *not* prevent Y, H or C from being collected.\n\nIn an ideal world, (*) would be improved: An external strong reference to Y would *not* be enough to keep X alive.

I this post, I clarify some notions and explain why the weak reference to a homset introduced here does *not* imply that the homset will immediately be garbage collected. Sorry, while I wrote that post, you clarified things for yourself, making my post redundant. Anyway, here it goes...

Replying to [nbruin](#comment%3A152):

No, it is a homset. But yes, it has strong references to X,Y,C.

Yes. But that should happen in a way that domain and codomain remain collectable. And that is a problem; see below.

But I think there is a lot of confusion now between coercion, homset, `TripleDict` post and prior to #715, and the way how coercion maps are cached. Let me try to straighten things a bit:

The original purpose of `TripleDict` was to store ACTIONS (not coercions). When you have an action of X on Y, then you would store the action in an attribute of X, addressed by the key triple that is formed by Y, the information what operation is considered (+ or *), and the information whether the action is on the left or on the right.

The original `TripleDict` did so by strong references to both keys and values. By #715, `TripleDict` got changed so that one has weak references to the keys.

Before #11521, that was the *only* application of `TripleDict`. But here, I suggest a second application, namely: Use it to store homsets. A "homset" from X to Y in the category C is the parent that contains all morphisms from X to Y in the category C (regardless whether these morphisms are coercion maps or conversion maps or anything else).

Let me emphasize again that #715, #12215 and #11521 do not change the way coercions are stored.

How are coercions stored? Before #12313, the coercions from X to Y were stored in a strong dictionary in Y, strongly keyed with X. Hence, as long as Y survives, there would be a strong reference to X. But with #12313, a weak dictionary is introduced for that purpose. Hence, even if Y persists and a coercion has been cached from X to Y, X remains collectable.

Now, back to caching `H = Hom(X,Y,category=C)` (H is a set of maps). You are right, having just a weak reference to H sounds like it would be immediately collected. If I recall correctly, my reasoning for introducing the weak reference to H has been as follows:

* Let T be the cache for the Hom function. T is a `TripleDict`. and T is in fact available under sage.categories.homset._cache. Hence, we have a strong permanent reference to T.
* T provides some buckets, and of course T has strong references to its buckets.
* With #715, the buckets contain some memory addresses representing the keys, and then strong references to the values.

By consequence, defining T[X,Y,C]=H means that we have a chain of strong references, starting with T (T is permanent), from T to its buckets, from the buckets to H, and from H to X, Y and C. Hence, X,Y and C will never be garbage collected, even though T itself only has weak references to X,Y and C.

Now, only define T[X,Y,C]=weakref.ref(H) (or any other kind of weak reference to H). Why is H *not* immediately garbage collected, in usual applications?

Usual application means: You will not just create H, but you will also create an element of H, say, phi. We have a strong reference from phi to H, because H is the parent of phi. If you do not store phi, then H remains collectable. But in a usual application, you would store phi, say, because it is a coerce map from X to Y.

By now, we assume that phi is a coercion, which is cached in Y. To be precise, we have Y._coerce_from_hash[X] = phi.

Prior to #12313, Y._coerce_from_hash is a usual dict. Hence, the existence of Y keeps X, phi and thus H alive.

With #12313, Y._coerce_from_hash is a `MonoDict`, which only has a weak reference to X. However, Y._coerce_from_hash has a strong reference to its buckets, the buckets have a strong reference to phi, phi has a strong reference to its parent H, and H has a strong reference to X. Hence, we have the reference cycle (with -> weak and => strong references)

```
* => T -> H

   Y -> X
   Y => phi => H => X
               H => Y
               H => C
```

In conclusion, an external reference to Y will keep X alive (which is bad). But if there is no external reference to Y nor to X, then Y,X,H and C remain collectable (assuming that no `__del__` method makes the cyclic garbage collection impossible), which is good enough to fix a memleak.

**__Summary__**

* If H=Hom(X,Y,C) and the homset cache keeps a strong reference to H, then H, X, Y and C will never be collectable. That's why I introduce the weak reference, strange as it may look.
* If H=Hom(X,Y,C) is created as the parent of a coercion or conversion map phi, which is stored in Y._coerce_from_cache, then:
   - An external strong reference to Y keeps phi, thus H, thus X and C alive (*).
   - An external strong reference to X does *not* prevent Y, H or C from being collected.

In an ideal world, (*) would be improved: An external strong reference to Y would *not* be enough to keep X alive. Do you have any idea how this can be implemented?

This is not completely clear, do you mean:
* #715 without the strong cache + #11521 (which is highly unprobable because of the bsd segfault, but let's mention this solution)?
* #715 with strong cache + #11521?
* #715 + #11521 + #13447 (assuming the strong cache is removed either from #715 directly or by means of a second reverse patch in #13447)?
> Plus, we *know* why a strong cache prevents the problems observed.

I guess you mean the bsd bug.
Not the memory leaks problems these tickets try to tackle, is that right?

This isn't a solution, because of the segfault.

Yes. Do the tests pass in that setting?

> * #715 + #11521 + #13447 (assuming the strong cache is removed either from #715 directly or by means of a second reverse patch in #13447)?


That would be the long term aim, from my perspective. But getting the refcount right turned out to be trickier than I originally thought. Hence, for now (again: *IF* the tests pass) I'd prefer #715+#11521 with the ugly strong cache for polynomial rings.

Yes and no. A strong cache for polynomial rings would mean that my current Sage applications would eat too much memory - hence, yes, a strong cache is opposite to the spirit of these tickets. However, for all other parents, the tickets would still fix some memory leaks.

Thanks, Simon.
I just hope (and expect) Nils to give a similar clarification.

I'm aware that the strong cache does induce (or prevents solving) leaks,
so obviously #13447 is the next issue to tackle, especially for your own work as it seems.

As far as tests are concerned, all tests used to pass on my machines without the strong cache for polynomial.
If Nils reconfirms that (i assumee that's what he meant earlier), maybe correcting the ticket desciption by removind the reference to #13447 and helping the patchbots to apply the patches correctly and letting them do their job should be enough now?

As far as I know, they do.

To be clear, the strong cache there is supposed to make things *not worse* for Singular rings. It's simply reinstating strong references that #715+#11521 removes (that's the idea at least), until we figure out how to properly collaborate with singular's (lack of) ref counting.

As it stands, this should make things *better* for many other parents. At this point the most important bit is to get to a point where parent deallocation code actually does get excercised.

I guess this is expected, because of the newly introduced strong cache for polynomial rings at the latest version of #715.

Same as above: This test was supposed to show that garbage collection for polynomial rings happens, but it doesn't, with a strong cache.

I guess that is more serious. IIRC, it comes from code in polynomial_template.

Anyway. If that kind of problems persist, then I guess we need #13447.

The new patch looks fine. Hence, it is a positive review.
