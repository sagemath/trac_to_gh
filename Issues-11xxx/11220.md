This email thread says it all:

```

Hi David,

Do you have a list of the CM j-invariants over Q(sqrt(5))?

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/cm.html

 -- William

Hi William,

I don't understand the comment (attribution to me) in the doc file.
I think it is a typo -- replace "field" with "functions" [on modular
curves of higher level].  In order to solve the problem (as a
precomputation) over an extension field F, it suffices to factor
the Hilbert class polynomials.  In this case the class number can
be up to 2 (degree [F:Q]).  The attached Magma and Sage code output
these values for F = Q(sqrt(5)).

Cheers,

David

The imaginary quadratic orders of class number 2 are the maximal orders in Q(sqrt(-d)) for d in [-5,-6,-10,-13,-15,-22,-35,-37,-51,-58,-91,-115,-123,-187,-235,-267,-403,-427] and the order of index 2 in Q(sqrt(-15)).

I read the patches and I think this is now good.  When reading, I missed Cremona's comment on this ticket, which made it harder to read the code, so I added his argument as a comment in the code.  Otherwise, I changed nothing, except flattening the patches and making the authors both John and Robert. 

Positive review (imho).
