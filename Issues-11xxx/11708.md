I'll ask about this on the Maxima devel list.  Maybe there is some little configuration thing that needs to be set.

Here's a huge log file

   http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/days/32/silius/install.log-20110818.txt

It is huge due to building ATLAS, etc.  So, just search in it. 

It looks like maybe *everything* ends up building except Maxima (and Tachyon, which is fixed by another ticket).

Hmmm, there are a couple of warnings already, including

```
make[3]: warning:  Clock skew detected.  Your build may be incomplete.
```
but comparing the log to what I have doesn't look very different.

How about installing the Maxima spkg with `strace -f [...] ./sage -i ...`, to see which file `ecl` apparently doesn't find?

It would also perhaps be better to first try to build on a local filesystem (if that wasn't the case, which I assume).

```
Maxima probably isn't supported on this platform because probably no
developer normally works on PPC Linux.  I might be wrong about that.

On the other hand, I have built maxima just fine using a 64-bit version
of ecl on Linux (x86) and Solaris (sparc).  So I would guess that the
problem you are seeing is due to ecl.
```
If there are any other responses, I'll update here.

Did Dave ever manage to build Sage in 64-bit mode on *SPARC*?

As far as I know the only big-endians we build / test on are (or just use) 32 bits.

I also noticed that silius doesn't have `libffi`, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Do you want an account on the machine?   Then you can try all this and maybe fix the problem!

I've been banging my head on this for a while now at Sage Days 32. I've tried the following so far:
* building ECL 11.1.1 independent of Sage and then building Maxima 5.25.0 (latest) on top of that (failed: same "redefining NIL" error that mhansen reported)
* building latest CVS version of ECL, then Maxima 5.25.0 on top of that (failed: same error as above) 
* making a new .spkg for the latest ECL, then using that to try building the maxima .spkg (failed with "not a lisp data object" error)

Just tried this on silius, here is the part of the log just before the error message is printed:

```

The full log is here: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/bjones/strace_maxima.log.gz (It is VERY large)

I've tried building the maxima .spkg (and Sage overall) both on my NFS mounted home folder and on the local /tmp on silius with no difference.

Other things I'm trying:

* running the ECL test-suite and comparing to another architectures (sage.math and skynet/eno)

I found Clozure CL project distributes binary images for ppc64 linux. I tried this out, but ran into yet more problems. Maybe this is going off on a tangent....

```
bjones@silius:/tmp/bjones/ccl-1.7> ./ppccl64
remap spjump: Invalid argument
```

Now I read through the platform notes [here](http://trac.clozure.com/ccl/wiki/PlatformNotes) and see that there is an issue with 16-bit memory references for functions like `NIL` (that sounds familiar...) not being accessible by non-root processes. This has to do with a parameter set by the OS: `mmap_min_addr`.

```
The parameter in question is called mmap_min_addr; one can cat the file /proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr to see what the current setting is.
```

On skynet/silius, 

```
bjones@silius:/tmp/bjones/ccl-1.7> cat /proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr
65536
```

and according to the platform notes, it *should* be 4096.

In light of this, it might be worth changing this parameter on silius (which requires a reboot, see the platform notes above) and then try Clozure CL (run test suites, etc) and THEN try building Maxima. Also, it would be worth trying to reproduce Mike Hansen's reported error about redefining `NIL` [here](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/11705#comment:10) after the `mmap_min_addr` parameter has been changed.

Well, this would probably prevent us from testing other, perhaps better solutions... ;-)

Similar machines will likely have the same problem, and I'm not sure whether everybody would lower the mmap min address since this is considered a security hole, at least in theory. And not every Sage user having access to such a machine will be able to do that, or to persuade a sysadmin to do so.

If `mmap()` is really the problem, one should be able to perhaps tweak / patch `configure`, or convince ECL in a different way to not (try to) use such low addresses. Furthermore, if that's really the cause, it is certainly a bug *how* (or when) ECL fails.

I don't think ECL uses fixed mappings (in that range) at all.

Even if it did, `mmap()` should return `MAP_FAILED`, which is, as far as I can see, always catched, and the *returned* address used rather than the one passed. (You can of course test whether the kernel is buggy... :) )

I also tried your fix and ran into the same old error at the UNARY part of Maxima's build. Here's exactly what I did.

0. starting with sage-4.7.2.alpha2 on skynet/silius
1. unpacked ecl-11.1.1.p1.spkg in a tmp directory
2. modified the line in src/c/main.d, changing the 16 to a 64
3. repacked the modified ecl-11.1.1.p1.spkg and put it in SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard
4. then ran make from SAGE_ROOT

The ECL build finishes without error, but the Maxima build fails at the same point as before. 

So you were saying that you were building a new spkg of maxima (or maybe of ECL). That could be the difference that John and I are seeing.

The following tests failed:

That's an expected failure with maxima-5.25.{0,1}.

I'll try to rebuild from scratch and make a ecl spkg that is not a hack.

Karl-Dieter, which upstream do you have in mind (now)? ;-)

Did you play with optimization flags when building the ECL spkg?

By default it uses `-O2`; if you set `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`, it will be built with `-O0`.

`spkg-install` looks quite ugly [again?] btw., the following for example is definitely wrong:

```sh
CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -I$SAGE_LOCAL/include"
LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L$SAGE_LOCAL/lib"
```
(The order has to be changed in both cases.)

a problem appeared with altivec and I caouldn't make a new spkg myself due to time

I haven't tried GCC 4.6.2 yet, although I downloaded it the day it had been released ;-) (but hadn't had the time to build it on Silius)

Perhaps they've fixed some things, although my impression was that something with ECL is wrong.

Note that I've previously built ECL and Maxima "successfully" (modulo lots of doctest errors) with `-mcpu=power4 -mtune=power4` (Maxima uses the `CFLAGS` from ECL anyway), and Sage with GCC 4.6.1 and GCC 4.4.6 (the other parts with `-mcpu=power7 -mtune=power7`).




> I see that mpir is a dependency of ecl; could the new mpir spkg have fixed the problem with maxima?  If so, we can close this ticket.


No, it just triggered the rebuild of ECL with GCC 4.6.2.

(I did build Sage 4.7.2.alpha3 which has [almost] the same MPIR spkg, i.e., the p4; the p7 just fixes a `configure` regression introduced by the p5/p6.)

I wouldn't close this ticket unless you know that none of the doctest errors is related to / caused by Maxima.

Unless a couple of doctest failures are caused by ECL and/or Maxima...

Maybe François can tell better.

I don't know right now what Maxima/ECL/GCC version you are referring to, but at least [with] GCC 4.6.x [ECL] seemed to produce buggy or invalid code for POWER7; `-mcpu=power4` in contrast "worked", at least better, i.e. did build and produced less test failures.  [Note that Maxima uses those `CFLAGS` specified when configuring ECL.]
