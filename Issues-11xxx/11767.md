I am doing a project to compute Chow-Heegner points with Darmon, Rotger, et al., and am using Sage's `elliptic_logarithm` function with high precision points as input.  Unfortunately, it completely hangs on many input points over number fields.  Here is an example below, where computing to precision 500 works fine, but precision 600 hangs Sage forever:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + x + 5)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K, [0,0,1,-3,-5])
sage: P = E([0,a])
sage: L = P.curve().period_lattice(K.embeddings(ComplexField(600))[0])
sage: time L.elliptic_logarithm(P, prec=500)

-0.842248166487739393375018008381693990800588864069506187033873183845246233548058477561706400464057832396643843146464236956684557207157300006542470428494 - 0.571366031453267388121279381354098224265947866751130917440598461117775339240176310729173301979590106474259885638797913383502735083088736326391919063211*I
Time: CPU 0.08 s, Wall: 0.09 s
```

BUT:

```
sage: L.elliptic_logarithm(P, prec=600)
HANGS FOREVER
```

Hitting control-c and using the debugger suggests that the termination condition is impossible.  You end up in this line `if (r.abs()-1).abs() < eps: break` with actually having `(r.abs()-1).abs() == eps`, so the strict inequality isnt' satisfied, and maybe for some reason it can't be???

```

Changing `< eps` to `<= eps` in two spots in the relevant file seems to fix the problem for me.

FWIW, using

```python

        C = ComplexField(prec2+1)
```
instead also works for (and seems a bit cleaner to) me, though of course a bit more expensive.

Attachment: **[trac_11767a.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11767/trac_11767a.patch.gz)**

I have added a 2nd patch (to be applied after the first one) which solves the typo, and
modifies the termination condition.

As far as I understand, the termination is when the (complex) variable `r` becomes 1.
We compute the complex norm of `r`, subtract one from it, and compare to `eps`
which is `2^(-prec2)`.

If `r` is near one, typically `r.abs()` will be 1, or one of the floating-point numbers
near from 1, which are `1-2^(-prec2)` and `1+2^(1-prec2)`. The subtraction of 1 is exact,
and the only case where the comparison `r.abs()-1 < eps` can be true is when `r=1`.

What I've done is that I've changed the termination condition to also check whether the
relative difference `r.abs()-1` does not change from one step to the next one.
Since `r.abs()-1` converges to one, this should catch cases where it stays at say
`1-2^(-prec2)` due to rounding errors. However it will not catch cases where it oscillates
between two different values near from 1.

ok, after looking again, it seems that using `prec2 = 2*prec` is overkill.
Usually, what we do in MPFR is that we use as internal precision prec + log2(prec) + a few bits.
To avoid computing a log(), I suggest using `prec2 = prec + 40` which should be large enough.
With this change, William's example with prec=600 runs ok. John, if you agree with that, I can

Well, I think even I can review this. ;-)

By the way, I guess the double "the" should have read "then the", i.e., an "n" was missing rather than a word duplicated, but it's ok as is, too.

So I think we have a positive review.

Of course William could again stress-test this, but at least there should no longer be endless loops, and the algorithm converges fast (with an *unmodified* termination condition, except that epsilon is now larger for high precision inputs), such that I don't expect very different or much less precise results w.r.t. the previous version either. Note that epsilon will now even be smaller for *lower* precision inputs.

Leif,

you didn't hit "positive review" thus you are waiting for William's review?

Note that William's example seems to exercise only the case where `r` is real in the
code. Maybe one should check that there is at least one example where `r` is complex
with large precision, or add one if it is not the case.

That is a *very* good observation.  The real case algorithm has been known for a very long time, but the complex case (using a generalised complex AGM) is still in preprint form!  I will come up with an example.

Thanks for testing.  Paul, could you add the new example to the tests?  You can use exactly the code I provided though the line

```
sage: L = P.curve().period_lattice(K.embeddings(ComplexField(1000))[0])
