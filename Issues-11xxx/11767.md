I am doing a project to compute Chow-Heegner points with Darmon, Rotger, et al., and am using Sage's `elliptic_logarithm` function with high precision points as input.  Unfortunately, it completely hangs on many input points over number fields.  Here is an example below, where computing to precision 500 works fine, but precision 600 hangs Sage forever:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + x + 5)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K, [0,0,1,-3,-5])
sage: P = E([0,a])
sage: L = P.curve().period_lattice(K.embeddings(ComplexField(600))[0])
sage: time L.elliptic_logarithm(P, prec=500)

BUT:

```
sage: L.elliptic_logarithm(P, prec=600)
HANGS FOREVER
```

Hitting control-c and using the debugger suggests that the termination condition is impossible.  You end up in this line `if (r.abs()-1).abs() < eps: break` with actually having `(r.abs()-1).abs() == eps`, so the strict inequality isnt' satisfied, and maybe for some reason it can't be???

Changing `< eps` to `<= eps` in two spots in the relevant file seems to fix the problem for me.

FWIW, using

```python
        R = RealField(prec2+1)
        C = ComplexField(prec2+1)
```
instead also works for (and seems a bit cleaner to) me, though of course a bit more expensive.

John will certainly know better.

I cannot fix this now and maybe someone else should anyway, since my numerical analysis expertise is clearly lacking -- apologies.  The underlying algorithm here is very good indeed (double exponential) but the stopping condition needs to be handled properly.

In the function elliptic_logarithm, first of all the working precision is doubled (prec2 is 2*prec)!  Overkill perhaps but with this algorithm the number of correct digits doubles with each step anyway.  The stopping condition (line 1366) is that the relative error is < eps where eps is `2^-prec2`.  In the loop, a and b are sequences of complex numbers which converge to a common limit and we ant to stop when a/b is close to 1.  Similarly on line 1400 where a,b are real.

I think that the right thing to do would be to replace eps by `2^-(prec2-1)` or something similar.  Also, replacing "while True" by something else so that infinite looping is impossible?

I'm glad this function is useful, by the way -- there is no other software which can take complex elliptic logs!

I have added a 2nd patch (to be applied after the first one) which solves the typo, and
modifies the termination condition.

As far as I understand, the termination is when the (complex) variable `r` becomes 1.
We compute the complex norm of `r`, subtract one from it, and compare to `eps`
which is `2^(-prec2)`.

If `r` is near one, typically `r.abs()` will be 1, or one of the floating-point numbers
near from 1, which are `1-2^(-prec2)` and `1+2^(1-prec2)`. The subtraction of 1 is exact,
and the only case where the comparison `r.abs()-1 < eps` can be true is when `r=1`.

What I've done is that I've changed the termination condition to also check whether the
relative difference `r.abs()-1` does not change from one step to the next one.
Since `r.abs()-1` converges to one, this should catch cases where it stays at say
`1-2^(-prec2)` due to rounding errors. However it will not catch cases where it oscillates
between two different values near from 1.

I agree, that is fine.  I put in 2*prec for testing and it worked (well, for several months!) and the algorithm was fast enough that I never bothered to work out a more sensible increase.

Well, I think even I can review this. ;-)

By the way, I guess the double "the" should have read "then the", i.e., an "n" was missing rather than a word duplicated, but it's ok as is, too.

So I think we have a positive review.

Of course William could again stress-test this, but at least there should no longer be endless loops, and the algorithm converges fast (with an *unmodified* termination condition, except that epsilon is now larger for high precision inputs), such that I don't expect very different or much less precise results w.r.t. the previous version either. Note that epsilon will now even be smaller for *lower* precision inputs.

you didn't hit "positive review" thus you are waiting for William's review?

Note that William's example seems to exercise only the case where `r` is real in the
code. Maybe one should check that there is at least one example where `r` is complex
with large precision, or add one if it is not the case.

That is a *very* good observation.  The real case algorithm has been known for a very long time, but the complex case (using a generalised complex AGM) is still in preprint form!  I will come up with an example.

FWIW, 11767b+c also passes doctests here.




P.S.:

There are various ways to make one patch out of two. E.g., take a fresh branch, import the first with `--no-commit`, and the second with `-f`(orce), then commit the cumulative changes.
