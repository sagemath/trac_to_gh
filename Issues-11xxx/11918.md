As reported on the IRC, running `sage --valgrind` (alias `sage --memcheck`) is apparently broken because the suppressions file is missing (and its directory, `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/valgrind/`, doesn't exist).

Both `sage-valgrind` and `sage-doctest` seem to hardcode `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/valgrind/sage.supp`.

---

Unless we again(?) create and ship this file, we could at least add

```sh
if [[ ! -f "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/valgrind/sage.supp ]]; then
   mkdir -p "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/valgrind
   touch "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/valgrind/sage.supp
fi
```
to `sage-valgrind`.

Using variables (perhaps also specifiable by the user) for both the directory and the filename would be better of course.

And / or only pass `--suppressions=...` if the file really exists.

sage.supp is part of the optional valgrind package which BTW is out of date.


According to http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/1657cccac33c9dd7
  The suppression file gets rid of a bunch of annoying issues introduced by zlib and Cython.

Is this still necessary?

Replying to [@a-andre](#comment%3A3):
> sage.supp is part of the optional valgrind package which BTW is out of date.

Yes, but it's IMHO pointless to install an (almost always) obsolete spkg just to get a file which consists of only a few lines.  It should be part of the standard distribution.

(More recent `valgrind` versions are either already installed or at least available as a "native" package in any reasonable distro.  Moreover, I don't think one would *only* use it for Sage.  Note also that usually `valgrind` has to be updated each time new processor instructions / ISA extensions come up.)

Not testing for its presence (btw. without any meaningful error message from Sage's side) is certainly a bug.

I think so, but it should be kept up-to-date anyway.

Is there a way to find out what singular_function or what cached method are involved?

You should be able to look that line up: `(function.cpp:11924)`. I suppose that's a cython generated file, so the context there will tell you which function this is in the corresponding `function.pyx` file.

I have no experience with valgrind myself. However, I think Python's memory management can confuse valgrind quite a bit. I was actually more hoping for a "double free" or "access to freed memory block" type error (i.e., illegal use of a pointer value.)

It may well be that my SIGILL is indeed a matter of mpfr on Corei7 compiling to something that's too fancy for valgrind and not a pointer to an error.

No, it isn't. It just tells that it is a singular_function (as defined in sage.libs.singular.function), but it could be any function of Singular (std, slimgb, reduce, system, ...)
