There are currently a couple of issues with `sage-env`; approximately ordered by importance:

* The definition of `UNAME` (currently on line 458) has to be moved up, preferably right before `PATH` etc. get set / modified (currently around line 135), and `$UNAME` should be used consistently.
* We should save the original, unmodified `PATH` (to `SAGE_ORIG_PATH`), analoguous to `SAGE_ORIG_LD_LIBRARY_PATH` etc., and perhaps record this in `SAGE_ORIG_PATH_SET`. This should also be done close to the top, of course before modifying `PATH`. (#10202 also suggests / introduces this.)
* There's partially useless code like

```sh
if [ "$LDFLAGS" = "" ]; then
    LDFLAGS=""          && export LDFLAGS
fi
```
* *All* variables that are expected to be either "`yes`", "`no`" or empty / unset should be checked for [in]valid settings, and perhaps normalized (i.e., for example set to "`no`" in case they're empty or not set). 

  We currently only do this for `SAGE64`
* The *default* for `CFLAG64` (`-m64`) and similar should be set in `sage-env`, not each and every `spkg-install`.

---

We should IMHO also save the original settings of `CC`, `CFLAGS`, `LD`, `LDFLAGS`, `MAKE` etc., since it is otherwise impossible for scripts (like the `spkg-install`s) to determine whether or which parts of the current settings were made by Sage, and which originate from the user (intentionally or not, e.g. from system-wide or default `.*rc` files).

A better approach would be to have and use `SAGE_CC` etc. instead, but this would require changes to all spkgs and other build-related files.

---

Some of the rather minor issues can be fixed on their own / follow-up tickets, but it would be odd to have a dozen "concurring" tickets all modifying `sage-env` at the same time.

We could also define (and export) `PKG_CONFIG_TOP_BUILD_DIR`, namely to `${SAGE_ROOT}/local`, and use

```
prefix=${pc_top_builddir}
```
or, a bit more flexible, define it to just `${SAGE_ROOT}` and use

```
prefix=${pc_top_builddir}/local
```
in all `pkg-config` (`*.pc`) files, which avoids wrapping `pkg-config` just to add `--define-variable=SAGE_ROOT="${SAGE_ROOT}"` to each invocation.

This is even safer than using

```
prefix=$${SAGE_ROOT}/local
```
though I haven't [yet] encountered problems with the latter. (The `$$` has the same meaning as in Makefiles, i.e. escapes the `$` such that the resulting environment variable will be interpreted -- or substituted -- later, by the shell.)

Currently sorting out what to fix where and in which order.

#11021 doesn't change much, and I intended to attach a couple of small patches to `sage-env` here for independent issues, so that they should all apply in almost random order, with just line numbers changing.

We can then leave out individual patches here in case other tickets already fix things.

I'll hopefully return to #11021 today and [try to] finish it, though I originally planned other things... ;-)

 There are currently a couple of issues with `sage-env`; approximately ordered by importance:
 
-* `BUILD` (used by `sage-spkg`) isn't exported, which wasn't really a problem until we started to (fully) source `sage-env` only once (#10469, cf. #11021 and #4949 for the impact on `sage-spkg`).
-* `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` is only changed if it is empty / undefined. We have to *prepend* `$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/pkgconfig` in case it is not. (Cf. #11681, #11686; #10202). 
- **#11765 addresses this issue.**
 * The definition of `UNAME` (currently on line 284) has to be moved up, preferably right before `PATH` etc. get set / modified (currently around line 135), and `$UNAME` should be used consistently.
 * The following (starting on line 348) has also to be moved up, since we return from `sage-env` earlier above (line 238) in case `"$1" = "-short"`:

 ```
-* `sage-env` has a bug w.r.t. "guessing" the value `SAGE_ROOT` should be set to, which leads to annoying or confusing warnings "`Attempted to overwrite SAGE_ROOT ...`", see [comment:ticket:11021:24 this comment] at #11021; thanks to John Palmieri for tracking this down.
 * The *default* for `CFLAG64` (`-m64`) and similar should be set in `sage-env`, not each and every `spkg-install`.
-* We could also source `~/.sagerc` (or `$DOT_SAGE/[.]sagerc`), if one of it exists, at some point in `sage-env`, to allow setting up typical variables (like e.g. `SAGE64`, perhaps depending on `hostname`, and other Sage-specific variables) automatically in a flexible and generic way.

I guess you meant "are". ;-)

Progress!  (Although I'd just add "Fixed by #.....", so one immediately sees where something got fixed and whether the corresponding ticket is already merged, e.g. if a problem reappears.)
