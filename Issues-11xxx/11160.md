I think the fix should be the same as at #10244, but for the GraphicsArray class.

Related tickets: 
* #10656 - Graphics Arrays should be able to become Graphics objects
* #10657 - options should be passed to all graphics, and they should be set separately if desired

Adding the suboptions we usually send to save to the normal !Graphics class matplotlib removes the error, but does the following - see attached graphic.  I don't have time to do any more with this now, though.

I should add that my code was slightly simpler:

```
sage: p = plot(x,legend_label='f')
sage: G = graphics_array((p,p))
sage: G

This is a bug which might be related:

```
sage: g = Graphics()
sage: g += plot(x,legend_label='f')
sage: g.set_legend_options(title="Nice")
sage: G = graphics_array((g,g))
sage: G.show()
...
KeyError: 'font_family'
```

It seems that this part of the problem might be completely solved by adding the suboptions usually added when show()'ing a graphics object.

Yes the doctests relevant to this ticket are included in #27865; in Sage 8.9.beta6, you can find them in lines 3481 - 3499 of `src/sage/plot/plot.py`:

```
        sage: L = [plot(sin(k*x), (x,-pi,pi)) for k in [1..3]]

        sage: ga.show(figsize=[5,7])  # tall and thin; long time

        sage: ga.show(figsize=4)  # width=4 inches, height fixed from default aspect ratio
```
as well as in lines 555-613 of `src/sage/plot/multigraphics.py`:

```
        sage: g1 = plot(sin(x^2), (x, 0, 6), axes_labels=['$x$', '$y$'],
