This is reported at [this sage-support thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/3bcc16c312bc0561/0cf76194c424c4e3?show_docid=0cf76194c424c4e3).

I think the fix should be the same as at #10244, but for the GraphicsArray class.

Related tickets: 
* #10656 - Graphics Arrays should be able to become Graphics objects
* #10657 - options should be passed to all graphics, and they should be set separately if desired

I should add that my code was slightly simpler:

```
sage: p = plot(x,legend_label='f')
sage: G = graphics_array((p,p))
sage: G
```

Yes the doctests relevant to this ticket are included in #27865; in Sage 8.9.beta6, you can find them in lines 3481 - 3499 of `src/sage/plot/plot.py`:

```
        sage: L = [plot(sin(k*x), (x,-pi,pi)) for k in [1..3]]

        sage: ga.show(figsize=[5,7])  # tall and thin; long time

        sage: ga.show(figsize=4)  # width=4 inches, height fixed from default aspect ratio
```
as well as in lines 555-613 of `src/sage/plot/multigraphics.py`:

```
        sage: g1 = plot(sin(x^2), (x, 0, 6), axes_labels=['$x$', '$y$'],
