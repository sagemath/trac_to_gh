This variable is not documented nowhere: it's in the installation guide.  But I agree that it's a good idea to put it in the top-level README, also.

A few comments: in other parts of the README file, we use "spkg" instead of "SPKG".  Also, at the end of line 182, the word "the" should be deleted.  I think we should also mention that using `SAGE_CHECK=yes` almost always causes a failure when building Python.  I've attached a referee patch making all of these changes.  (Sorry for the length of the first chunk: it just adds the phrase `"spkg" stands for "Sage package"`, but then the linebreaks for the paragraph needed reworking.)

<a id='comment:10'>Comment 10:</a>
Setting `MAKE` without setting `SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD=yes` can (currently) have strange effects, so in principle one shouldn't set one without setting the other.

`-j` is an option to GNU `make`, which isn't mentioned in the `README.txt` at all. (Sage is unlikely to build with any other `make`.)

Btw, `SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD` *is* documented in the [Sage Installation Guide](http://sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html#environment-variables), which is referenced from the `README.txt`, though not prominently.

Also, the Sage library is built in parallel even if `MAKE` is **not** set (which I consider a bug).

Cf. #11622.
