I notice that your example does not have a list of lists, but rather a list of sequences :)

Also (not for this ticket), I think it would be nice to have a matrix constructor type option - something like you give it 16 entries and `n=4` and it turns that into a four-column table.  What do you think?

Could you replace `if header is not False` with `if header`?  Just a quibble.

By the way, apparently this file is not in the reference manual?
