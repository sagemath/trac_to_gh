Expressions involving RealIntervals do not compare properly, returning a TypeError. For example,

```
sage: bool(RealInterval(4,5)*x==RealInterval(4,5)*x)
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1006, 0))
TypeError:

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
I think that this is invalid.  Here is the relevant documentation:

```
Comparison operations (==,!=,<,<=,>,>=) return true if every value in
the first interval has the given relation to every value in the
second interval. The cmp(a, b) function works differently; it
compares two intervals lexicographically. (However, the behavior is
not specified if given a non-interval and an interval.)
```

So,

```
sage: RIF(3,4) == RIF(3,4)
False
sage: RIF(3,3) == RIF(3,3)
True
```

Oh, I see. The second bug is still valid though, so I will edit the ticket to reflect this.
