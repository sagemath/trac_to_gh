```
The following code

```
K.<t> = NumberField(x^2+17)
I = K.ideal(3,t+1)
S = K.primes_above(11)
A = K.S_class_group(S)
A(I)
```

produces the error

```
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Ambient free module
of rank 1 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring' and 'Full
MatrixSpace of 0 by 0 dense matrices over Integer Ring'
```

The same error can be obtained by

```
A.identity()
```

The problem seems to arise only when the abelian group is trivial.

I imagine this is not a problem of the class group implementation, but one of (trivial) abelian group.

This is no longer a problem in 5.9. This ticket can be closed now:

```
sage: K.<t> = NumberField(x^2+17)
sage: I = K.ideal(3,t+1)
sage: S = K.primes_above(11)
sage: A = K.S_class_group(S)
sage: A(I)
Trivial S-ideal class
sage: A.identity()
Trivial S-ideal class
