The following code leads to about a one minute hang for me (reproducibly in a fresh session).  Keshav Kini (via IRC) had the same experience.

```
sage: A = matrix(QQ, 4, 4, [1, 2, -2, 2, 1, 0, -1, -1, 0, -1, 1, 1, -1, 2, 1/2, 0])
sage: e = A.eigenvalues()[3]
sage: K = (A-e).kernel()
sage: P = K.basis_matrix()
sage: x = P.list()[3]
sage: remap = {}
sage: remap.has_key(x)
```

This behavior hangs the creation of a string version of a matrix.  If you comment-out `sage/matrix/matrix0.pyx` at lines 1695-1696, the problem goes away.  To see the effect, run the first four lines of the code above and then just print P, with and without the two lines mentioned.

I have a workaround in mind that may solve the problem in many cases.  Root issue is at #11543.

I tested this for speed, but forgot to do even minimal doctests.

It affects a lot of QQbar output in minor ways, so several doctests need fixing.

v2 patch includes doctest fixes.

Just one line of code changes in sage/matrix/matrix0.pyx, the rest is documentation.

Previous behavior was to hash entries while printing, this caused the precision of an entry to increase, thus slightly greater precision in subsequent computed (printed) results.

This probably needs a bit more explanation.

One feature of #10627 is to replace specific matrix entries by a symbol.  To look up this translation in a dictionary, entries of a matrix are hashed.  For QQbar, this hash is expensive (#11543).

This patch prevents a look-up if the translation dictionary is empty.
